Chapter that but little preface is needed  Its main object is to acquaint young people with the  structure and habits of the lower forms of life and  to do this in a more systematic way than is usual in  ordinary works on Natural History and more simply  than in textbooks on Zoology  For this reason I have adopted the title Life  and her Children to express the family bond uniting  all living things as we use the term Nature and her  Works to embrace all organic and inorganic pheno  mena and I have been more careful to sketch in  bold outline the leading features of each division  than to dwell upon the minor differences by which it  is separated into groups  I have made use of British examples in illustration  wherever it was possible and small specimens of most  of the marine animals figured may be found upon  our coasts at low tide  In conclusion I wish to express my great obligation to Mr R Garnett of the British Museum for his  most kind assistance in finding works of reference on  the special subjects and to many men of science  especially Mr Lowne FRCS and Mr Haddon Demonstrator of Comparative Anatomy at Cambridge  for their valuable criticisms on the proofsheets  The Illustrations of the marine animals have been  drawn by Dr Wild artist of the Challenger Expedi  tion and those of the insects by Mr Edwin Wilson  to both of whom my thanks are due for the care  and assiduity with which they have carried out my  instructions  CONTENTS  CHAPTER I  PAGE  LIFE AND HER CHILDREN i  CHAPTER II  LIFES SIMPLEST CHILDREN HOW THEY LIVE AND MOVE  AND BUILD 14  CHAPTER III

AND HER CHILDREN  CHAPTER I  Wisdom and Spirit of the Universe  Thou Soul that art the Eternity of Thought  And givst to forms and images a breath  And everlasting motion WORDSWORTH  WONDER whether it ever  occurs to most people to con  sider how brimful our world is  ju of life and what a different place  it would be if no living thing had  ever been upon it From the time  we are born till we die there is  scarcely a waking moment of our  lives in which our eyes do not  rest either upon some living thing  or upon things which have once  been alive Even in our rooms  the wood of our furniture and our  doors could never have been with  out the action of life the paper on our walls the  carpet on our floors the clothes on our back the  cloth upon the table are all made of materials which  life has produced for us nay the very marble of  our mantelpiece is the work of once living animals  and is composed of their broken shells The air we  breathe is full of invisible germs of life nor need  we leave the town and go to the country in search  of other living beings than man There is scarcely  a street or alley where if it be neglected for a  time some blade of grass or struggling weed does  not make its appearance pushing its way through  chinks in the pavement or the mortar in the wall  no spot from which we cannot see some insect creep  ing or flying or spinning its web so long as the  hand of man does not destroy it  And when we go into the quiet country leaving  man and his works behind how actively we find life  employed Covering every inch of the ground with  tiny plants rearing tall trees in the forest filling the  stagnant pools full of eager restless beings anywhere  everywhere life is at work Look at the little water  beetles skimming on the surface of the shady wayside  pool watch the snails feeding on the muddy bank  notice the newts putting their heads above water  to take breath and then remember that besides these  and innumerable other animals visible to the naked eye  the fairyshrimp and the waterflea and other minute  creatures are probably darting across the pond or  floating lazily near its surface while the very scum  which is blown in ridges towards one corner of the  pool is made up of microscopic animals and plants  Then as we pass over plain and valley and  mountain we find things creeping innumerable both  small and great some hidden in the moss or the thick  grass rolled up in the leaves boring into the stems  and trunks of trees eating their way underground or  into even the strongest rock while others such as  the lion the tiger and the elephant roaming over  Africa and India rule a world of their own where  man counts for very little Even in our own thickly  peopled country rabbits multiply by thousands in  their burrows and come to frolic in the dusk of  evening when all is still The fieldmice land and  water rats squirrels weasels and badgers have their  houses above and below ground while countless in  sects swarm everywhere testifying to the abundance of  life Not content moreover with filling the water  and covering the land this same silent power peoples  the atmosphere where bats butterflies bees and  winged insects of all forms shapes and colours  fight their way through the ocean of air while birds  large and small sail among its invisible waves  And when by and by we reach the sea we find  there masses of tangled seaweed the plants of the  salt water while all along the shores myriads of  living creatures are left by the receding tide In  the rocky pools we find active life busily at work  Thousands of acornshells many of them scarcely  larger than the head of a goodsized pin cover the  rocks and wave their delicate fringes in search of food  Small crabs scramble along or swim across the pools  sandskippers dart through the water feeding on the  delicate green seaweed which in its turn is covered  with minute shells not visible to the naked eye and  yet each containing a living being  Wherever we go living creatures are to be found  and even if we sail away over the deep silent ocean  and seek what is in its depths there again we find  abundance of life from the large fish and other mon  sters which glide noiselessly along lords of the ocean  down to the jellymasses floating on the surface and  the banks of rocky coral built by jelly animals  in the midst of the dashing waves There is no  spot on the surface of the earth in the depths of  the ocean or in the lower currents of the air which  is not filled with life whenever and wherever there is  room The one great law which all living beings  obey is to increase multiply and replenish the  earth and there has been no halting in this work  from the day when first into our planet from the  bosom of the great Creator was breathed the breath  of life the invisible mother ever taking shape in  her children  No matter whether there is room for more living  forms or not still they are launched into the world  The little seed which will be stifled by other plants  before it can put forth its leaves nevertheless thrusts  its tiny root into the ground and tries to send a  feeble shoot upwards Thousands and millions of  insects are born into the world every moment which  can never live because there is not food enough for  all If there were only one single plant in the whole  world today and it produced fifty seeds in a year  and could multiply unchecked its descendants would  cover the whole globe in nine years But since  other plants prevent it from spreading thousands and  thousands of its seeds and young plants must be  formed only to perish In the same way one pair  of birds having four young ones each year would if  all their children and descendants lived and multi  plied produce two thousand million in fifteen years f  but since there is not room for them all but a very  few must die  What can be the use of this terrible overcrowding  in our little world Why does this irresistible living  breath go on so madly urging one little being after  another into existence Would it not be better if  only enough were born to have plenty of room and  to live comfortably  Wait a while before you decide and think what  every creature needs to keep it alive Plants it is  true can live on water and air but animals cannot  and if there were not myriads of plants to spare in  the world there would not be enough for food  Then consider again how many animals live upon  each other if worms snails and insects were not  overabundant how would the birds live upon what  would lions and tigers and wolves feed if other  animals were not plentiful while on the other hand  if a great number of larger animals did not die and  decay what would the flesh feeding snails and  maggots and other insects find to eat And so we  see that for this reason alone there is some excuse  for the overabundance of creatures which life thrusts  into the world  But there is something deeper than this to con  sider If in a large school every boy had a prize  at the end of the halfyear whether he had worked  or not do you think all the boys would work as  hard as they do or learn as well If every man  had all he required and could live comfortably and  bring up his children to enjoy life without working  for it do you think people would take such trouble  to learn trades and professions and to improve them  selves so as to be more able than others Would  they work hard day and night to make new inven  tions or discover new lands and found fresh colonies  or be in any way so useful or learn so much as they  do now  No it is the struggle for life and the necessity  for work which makes people invent and plan and  improve themselves and things around them And  so it is also with plants and animals Life has to  educate all her children and she does it by giving  the prize of success health strength and enjoyment  to those who can best fight the battle of existence  and do their work best in the world  Every plant and every animal which is born upon  the earth has to get its own food and earn its own  livelihood and to protect itself from the attacks of  others Would the spider toil so industriously to  spin her web if food came to her without any  exertion on her part Would the caddis worm  have learnt to build a tube of sand and shells to  protect its soft body or the oyster to take lime from  the seawater to form a strong shell for its home if  they had no enemies to struggle against and needed  no protection Would the bird have learnt to build  her nest or the beaver his house if there was no need  for their industry  But as it is since the whole world is teeming  with life and countless numbers of seeds and eggs  and young beginnings of creatures are only waiting  for the chance to fill any vacant nook or corner  every living thing must learn to do its best and to  find the place where it can succeed best and is least  likely to be destroyed by others And so it comes to  pass that the whole planet is used to the best advan  tage and life teaches her children to get all the good  out of it that they can  If the ocean and the rivers be full then some  must learn to live on the land and so we have for  example seasnails and landsnails and whereas  the one kind can only breathe by gills in the water  the other breathes air by means of airchambers  while between these are some marsh snails of the  tropics which combine both and can breathe in both  water and air We have large whales sailing as  monarchs of the ocean and walruses and seals fish  ing in its depths for their food while all other  animals of the mammalian class live on the land  Then again while many creatures love the bright  light others take advantage of the dark corners  where room is left for them to live You can scarcely  lift a stone by the seaside without finding some  living thing under it nor turn up a spadeful of  earth without disturbing some little creature which  is content to find its home and its food in the dark  ground Nay many animals for whom there is no  chance of life on the earth in the water or in the  air find a refuge in the bodies of other animals and  feed on them  But in order that all these creatures may live  each in its different way they must have their own  particular tools to work with and weapons with  which to defend themselves Now all the tools and  weapons of an animal grow upon its body It  works and fights with its teeth its claws its tail its  sting or its feelers or it constructs cunning traps  by means of material which it gives out from its own  body like the spider It hides from its enemies  by having a shape or colour like the rocks or the  leaves the grass or the water which surround it It  provides for its young ones either by getting food for  them or by putting them even before they come out  of the egg into places where their food is ready for  them as soon as they are born  So that the whole life of an animal depends upon  the way in which its body is made and it willlead  quite a different existence according to the kind of  tools with which life provides it and the instincts  which a long education has been teaching to its  ancestors for ages past It will have its own peculiar  struggles and difficulties and successes and enjoy  ments according to the kind of bodily powers which  it possesses and the study of these helps us to under  stand its manner of existence  And now since we live in the world with all  these numerous companions which lead many of  them such curious lives trying like ourselves to make  the best of their short time here is it not worth  while to learn something about them May we not  gain some useful hints by watching their contrivances  sympathising with their difficulties and studying  their history And above all shall we not have  something more to love and to care for when we  have made acquaintance with some of Lifes other  children besides ourselves  The one great difficulty however in our way is  how to make acquaintance with such a vast multitude  Most of us have read anecdotes about one animal or  another but this does not give us any clue to the  history of the whole animal world and without some  such clue the few observations we can make for our  selves are very unsatisfactory On the other hand  most people will confess that books on zoology where  accounts are given of the structure of different classes  of animals though very necessary are rather dull  and do not seem to help us much towards under  standing and loving these our fellowcreatures  What we most want to learn is something of the  lives of the different classes of animals so that when  we see some creature running away from us in the  woods or swimming in a pond or darting through  the air or creeping on the ground we may have an  idea what its object is in life how it is enjoying  itself what food it is seeking or from what enemy  it is flying  And fortunately for us there is an order and  arrangement in this immense multitude and in the  same way as we can read and understand the history  of the different nations which form the great human  family spread over the earth and can enter into their  feelings and their struggles though we cannot know  all the people themselves so with a little trouble we  may learn to picture to ourselves the general life  and habits of the different branches of the still  greater family of Life so as to be ready by and by  to make personal acquaintance with any particular  creature if he comes in our way  This is what we propose to do in the following  chapters and we must first consider what are the  chief divisions of our subject and over what ground  we have to travel It is clear that both plants and  animals are the children of Life and indeed among  the simplest living forms it is often difficult to say  whether they are plants or animals  But it is impossible for us to follow out the  history of both these great branches or Kingdoms  as naturalists call them so we must reluctantly turn  our backs for the present upon the wonderful secrets  of plant life and give ourselves up in this work to  the study of animals  First we meet with those simple forms which  manage so cleverly to live without any separate  parts with which to do their work Marvellous  little beings these which live and move and  multiply in a way quite incomprehensible as yet to  us Next we pass on to the slightly higher forms  of the second division of life in which the members  have some simple weapons of attack and defence  Here we come first upon the wonderful living sponge  building its numerous canals which are swept by  special scavengers these form a sort of separate  group hovering between the first and second division  and from them we go on to the travelling jellyfish  with their rudiments of eyes and ears and their  benumbing sting and then to the seaanemones with  their lassocells and to the wondrous coralbuilders  Already we are beginning to find that the need of  defence causes life to arm her children  The third division is a small yet most curious one  containing the starfish with their countless suckerfeet  the seaurchins with their delicate sharp spines and  curious teeth and the sea cucumbers with their  power of throwing away the inside of their body  and growing it afresh This division goes off in  one direction while the next or fourth though start  ing with creatures almost as simple as the coral  builders takes quite a different line having for its  members mussels and snails cuttlefish and oysters  and dividing into two curious groups the one of  the shellfish with heads and the other of those  without any  The fifth division starting also in its own line by  the side of the third and fourth includes the creeping  worms provided with quite a different set of weapons  and working in their own peculiar fashion some living  in the water some on the earth and some in the flesh  of other beings feeding upon their living tissues An  ugly division this and yet when we come to study it  we shall find it full of curious forms showing strange  habits and ways  The sixth division is a vast army in itself with  four chief groups all agreeing in their members  having jointed feet and subdivided into smaller  groups almost without number The first group  including the crabs and their companions live in the  water and their weapons are so varied and numerous  that it will be difficult for us even to gain some  general idea of them The other three groups the  centipedes spiders and six legged insects breathe  only in the air This sixth or jointedlegged division  contains more than four fifths of the whole of the  living beings on our globe and it forms a world  of its own full of interest and wonders In it we  have all the strange facts of metamorphosis the  wondrous contrivances and constructions of insect  life and at the head of it those clever societies of  wasps bees and ants with laws sometimes even  nearer to perfection than those of man himself  Lastly we come to the seventh and vast division  of backboned animals which will claim a separate  volume to itself This division has struggled side  by side with the other six till it has won a position  in many respects above them all Nearly all the  animals which we know best belong to it the fishes  toads and newts amphibia the reptiles the birds  and the mammalia including all our fourfooted  animals as well as the whales seals monkeys and  man himself  Under these seven divisions then are grouped the  whole of the living animals as they are spread over  the earth to fight the battle of life Though in many  places the battle is fierce and each one must fight  remorselessly for himself and his little ones yet the  struggle consists chiefly in all the members of the  various brigades doing their work in life to the best  of their power so that all while they live may lead  a healthy active existence  The little bird is fighting his battle when he  builds his nest and seeks food for his mate and his  little ones and though in doing this he must kill the  worm and may perhaps by and by fall a victim  himself to the hungry hawk yet the worm heeds  nothing of its danger till its life comes to an end  and the bird trills his merry song after his break  fast and enjoys his life without thinking of perils  to come   While ravening death of slaughter neer grows weary  Life multiplies the immortal meal as fast  All are devourers all in turn devoured  Yet every unit in the uncounted sum  Of victims has its share of bliss its pang  And but a pang of dissolution each  Is happy till its moment comes and then  Its first last suffering unforeseen unfeard  Ends with one struggle pain and life for ever  So life sends her children forth and it remains  for us to learn something of their history If we  could but know it all and the thousands of different  ways in which the beings around us struggle and  live we should be overwhelmed with wonder Even  as it is we may perhaps hope to gain such a glimpse  of the labours of this great multitude as may lead us  to wish to fight our own battle bravely and to work  and strive and bear patiently if only that we may  be worthy to stand at the head of the vast family of  Lifes children  CHAPTER II  LIFES SIMPLEST CHILDREN HOW THEY LIVE AND  MOVE AND BUILD   The very meanest things are made supreme  With innate ecstasy No grain of sand  But moves a bright and millionpeopled land  And hath its Edens and its Eves I deem  For love though blind himself a curious eye  Hath lent me to behold the heart of things  And touched mine ear with power Thus far or nigh  Minute or mighty fixed or free with wings  Delight from many a nameless covert sly  Peeps sparkling and in tones familiar sings  LAMAN BLANCHARD  HO are Lifes simplest children  and where are they to be found  Let us try to answer the second  question first and rubbing the  scales from off our eyes peer into  the hidden secrets of nature and  when we have tracked to their  home the tiny beginnings of life  we will examine them and try to  understand how they live  How calm and lovely and  still the sea looks on a warm  sunny breezeless day of summer  and how happy we can imagine  the myriads of creatures to be  that float in its waters We know many of them  well especially those which come close up to the  shore The small fry of the fish the shrimp arid the  sandhopper the large jellyfish and the tiny trans  parent jellybells see 3 Fig 2 2 only to be seen by the  keenest eye as we dip out the water carefully in a  glass Surely these minute jellybells with their in  visible hanging threads must be some of the simplest  and lowest forms of life Not so they are really  very high up in the world compared with the forms  we are seeking  If indeed we come out late some autumn evening  when after the sun has set and the sky is dark the  sea in some sheltered bay appears all covered with  a sheet of light we may see some of the beings  of the lowest order of life with the naked eye for  when we dip the liquid fire out in a glass vessel and  examine it we find in it hundreds and thousands of  tiny bags of slime giving out the bright specks of  light and these little Noctilucae or nightglows 2  Fig 3 are as we shall presently see some of Lifes  simplest children although not by any means the  most simple of the order  No to begin at the very beginning and find the  first known attempts at a living being we must  search long and carefully not merely with our  own eyes but with the microscope Then we may  perhaps be fortunate enough to discover some won  drously small creature like that on the next page  which Professor Haeckel took out of the sunny blue  waters of the Mediterranean near Nice in 1864  The largest specimen to be found will be smaller  than the smallest pins head yet when seen under  the microscope this tiny speck appears with out  stretched threads a living animal see tfFig i floating  in search of food Examine it how we will we can  find in it no mouth no stomach no muscles no  nerves no parts of any kind It looks merely like  The Threadslime Haeckel  a In its natural round shape immensely magnified b spreading itself  over a small animal c Ceratium to suck the soft body out of the shell  a minute drop of gum with fine grains in it floating  in the water sometimes with its fine threads out  stretched sometimes as a mere drop and if we take  it out and analyse the matter of which it is made  we find that is much the same as a speck of white  ofegg Is it possible that it can be alive How can  we be sure In the first place it breathes If it be  kept in a drop of water it uses up the oxygen in  it and makes the water bad by breathing into it  carbonic acid then it moves and as we shall see  presently can draw in and throw out its fine threads  when and where it chooses again it eats feeding on  the minute jelly plants in the water or even on  animals higher in the world than itself and lastly it  grows and increases for when it is too large to be  comfortable it splits in two and each half goes its  way as a living animal  Let us see how one behaved which Professor  Haeckel took out of the sea and kept in a watch  glass under a microscope When he first looked at  it he found that it was drawn up in a lump with a  minute animal and a plantcell in the middle of its  slime and close by it in the water lay a small living  animal called a Ceratium c Fig i which has a  hard case or shell After a while as he watched  he saw the threadslime put out its fine threads on  all sides a Fig i Soon the threads on the right  side touched the shell of the Ceratium Here was  food and the body of the Threadslime evidently  became aware of it at once for all the little grains in  the slime began to course to and fro and the threads  touching the Ceratium lengthened out and stretched  more and more over it while all those on the other  side which had not found any food were drawn in  b Fig i Six hours later when Dr Haeckel looked  again to his astonishment the thread slime had  disappeared but on examining more closely he  discovered it completely spread in patches over the  shell of the Ceratium It had drawn its whole body  after the pioneering threads and wrapped itself round  its prey Next morning when he looked again lo  it was back in its original place and by its side lay  the Ceratium shell quite empty together with the  skeletons of the other two forms which had been  inside the Threadslime  This little drop of slime without eyes or ears or  parts of any kind knew how to find its food without  muscles or limbs it was able to creep over it without  a mouth it could suck out its living body without a  stomach it could digest the food in the midst of its  own slime and throw out the hard parts which it  did not want  This is the history of one of Lifes simplest  children  Here is another Fig 2 which lives not only in the  sea but also in pools and puddles and in the gutters  of our streets and of  our housetops Any  where that water lies  stagnant these little  drops of slime will grow  up and make it their  home Sometimes few  and far between some  times in crowds so that  The Finger SVaoRHaeekd the whole pond would  a At rest b Feeding on minute seem a lj ve jf we CQU d  slimeplants  see them they live and  multiply and die under our very feet Can any  thing be less like an animal than this shapeless  mass a Fig 2 Yet under a strong microscope it  may be seen moving lazily along by putting out a  thick slimy finger and then letting all the rest of its  body flow after it When it touches food it flows  over it just as the Threadslime did and dissolving  the soft parts sends out the hard refuse anywhere it  does not matter where for it has no skin over its  body being merely one general mass of slime  And now before we go on to other forms let me  ask you to pause and think what these little slime  specks tell us about the wonderful powers of Life  Can you guess at all how these creatures do their  work We are obliged to have eyes to see our food  nerves and muscles to enable us to feel and grasp it  mouths to eat it stomachs which secrete a juice in  order to dissolve it and a special pump the heart to  drive it into the different parts of our body But in  these tiny slimeanimals life has nothing better to  work with than a mere drop of living matter which  is all alike throughout so that if you broke it into  twenty pieces every piece would be as much a living  being as the whole drop And yet by means of the  wonderful gift of life this slime drop lives and  breathes and eats and increases shrinks away if you  touch it feels for its food and moves from place to  place changing its shape to form limbs and feeling  threads which are lost again as soon as it no longer  needs them  Nor have we yet learnt onehalf of the marvels  which can be wrought in living specks of slime For  on further inquiry we find these simple forms de  veloping two quite different modes of life In the  one case the slime is moulded itself into delicate  forms making creatures with mouths with suckers  and with delicate lashes to drive the body through  the water while in the other case remaining a simple  drop with delicate threads it has learned to build a  solid covering of the most exquisite delicacy  To the first class belongs our little Noctiluca and  the forms drawn by its side in Fig 3 To the second  belong the microscopic shells Fig 4 which form our  chalk Look at the little wriggling creatures at I  Fig 3 small as they look here they are drawn many  thousand times larger than they really are in life  and yet they are much more perfectly formed than  either the thread slime or the fingerslime They  have actually a kind of skin and do not throw out  threads here and there but are provided with a little  whip of slime which they lash to and fro and so drive  themselves through the water These microscopic  forms called monads grow up in water in which flowers  have stood for many days till their stalks begin to de  cay and in infusions of hay or straw made by pouring  hot water upon them and letting it stand and for  this reason the little beings are called infusoria In  such impure water under a powerful microscope you  may see them darting along by thousands But the  whip does not only serve them as an oar it also sends  the food they meet with into a tiny opening one of  lifes first attempts at a mouth With a little jerk  when the creature is still or fixed to the bottom the  whip drives still smaller beings than the monad itself  into its wideopened cavity and there they are digested  in a little watery bubble which may be clearly seen  in its body The Noctiluca or nightglow 2 Fig 3  s much larger being often as large as the head of  a small pin and just below the outer rim of its slimy  bag the sparks of light are given out It has been  reckoned that there are as many as 30000 Noc  tilucae in one cubic inch of phosphorescent water  and it is almost impossible to grasp the idea of the  millions upon millions of these tiny forms which  must be floating over a sea which is giving out a  glow of liquid fire for miles and miles And it is only  because of this light that we realise that they are there  There are just as many other forms in the water on  every side of us while we dream nothing of this  teeming life in the midst of which we live  We cannot stop here to speak of the tubesucker  and all his relations which have a mouth at the end  of every tube nor of the beautiful little bellflower ft  which may be seen in any pond or in seawater with  its hanging bells whirling the food in by their little  fringe of hairs a Fig 3 or shutting up with the  food inside and starting back by curling up their  slender stem b or splitting in two c and sending  off buds d d which swim away to form new colonies  elsewhere All these wondrous little beings are some  of lifes simplest children and one and all are made  of nothing but slime while yet they live and move  and seek their daily food  But all these are naked and homeless and to a  great extent unprotected Gulped down in thou  sands and millions by each other and by other  animals they are defenceless and weak against  attacks It would certainly be better for them  if they could have solid shells to cover their soft  bodies and to protect them in many dangers And  so we find that even in this lowest stage of life  necessity is the mother of invention and drops of  slime no higher than the threadslime Fig i have  learned to build shells around their delicate bodies  These shellbuilders live chiefly in the sea and  there you may find them if you search carefully by  the help of a strong magnifying glass in the ooze of  oysterbeds or under the leaves of the delicate green  seaweed or in the muddy sand of the seashore  The most common forms will be those shown at a e   and g in Fig 4 and though they are so very  small you may if you are fortunate see them clinging  by their fine slimethreads to the weeds or the mud  These animals are as I have said simple slime  drops like the threadslime but they add to the list of  wonderful things that such slime can do for they take  out of the seawater particle by particle the lime  which is dissolved in it and build around their soft  bodies the solid shell or skeleton in which they live  Nor is this all even if they all built the same simple  shell it would be very puzzling to imagine how they  do it bul they do much more They build shells in  many different shapes often with the most beautiful  and complicated patterns upon them All but the  simplest shells have several chambers in them a new  one being added as soon as the animal outgrows the  last one and in the partition between each chamber  there is a minute hole through which a thin thread of  slime passes into the next chamber so that the whole  body is joined together throughout the shell On  account of these holes these limebuilders have been  called Foraminifera from foramen a hole fero I bear   This name is now often defined as meaning that the outside of  the shell is perforated with holes but the earlier use of the word as  given here is more correct because it applies equally to the perforated  and nonperforated Foraminifera  Let us now take one of these shells a Fig 4 and  see how it was built up The grown animal as he  looks when the shell is taken off him is shown in  Fig 5 In the beginning when he is quite young he  F is merely a round drop i Fig 5 with  a delicate transparent shell and an  opening out of which he puts his  threads of slime Then as he out  grows this first chamber he draws  his slime threads together and forms  a bud 2 outside the shell and  round this bud he builds a second  The jelly body of r  the Miliolite a Fig 4 chamber out of the end of which  showing the buds of he again puts his threads Then he  3 Uich 3 Sci fs the next bud 3 and goes  chamber is built on thus till he has built a com  Carpenter pj ete ell generally of seven cham  bers and as each new compartment is so placed  as to overlap the one before it the whole when  finished has the curious form a Fig 4 altogether  not larger than a millet seed from which it takes  the name of Miliola These miliolite shells may  be found by the help of the microscope in the  damp sand of almost any seashore and while some  of the shells will be empty others will still be filled  with the darkyellow animal slime  Think of the constant manufacture of such delicate  shells as these going on all over the world and the  makers but a drop of slime And lest you should  be inclined to think little of it as a mere mechanical  process the miliolite himself tells us another story for  from time to time we find miliolites with shells made  not of lime but of grains of sand and tiny broken  pieces of shell a Fig 4 which the little architect  has used to build the walls of his house when for  some reason the ordinary material was deficient It  seems to me that the power of this living drop to  choose its own materials is one of the most wonderful  facts in the history of lifes simplest children  These miliolites and other Foraminifera when  found clinging to seaweed are easily placed in a salt  water aquarium and they will then thrust their  threads out of the mouth of the shell and crawl on  the sides of the glass Professor Schultze even saw  a number of young miliolites born in an aquarium  and this was how it happened He noticed one day  that several of his miliolites had covered the outside  of their shells with their brown slimy body and a  few days later he could see through the microscope  a number of darklooking specks gradually loosening  themselves from this slime  There were as many as forty of these specks on  one shell and after a time he could distinguish that  every speck was a tiny miliolite having only one  chamber i Fig 5 to begin life in the shell of  which was so pale and transparent that he could  see the slime within it As soon as each one  shook himself free from the rest of the slime he  put out his threads and crawled away on the glass  to get his own living and now when Professor  Schultze examined the shell of the parent miliolite  he found it almost empty The mother had broken  herself up into her little children  A miliolite builds generally only six or seven  chambers but other forms such as c Figure 4 build  hundreds of separate apartments This particular  form c which is called an Orbitolite has often as  many as fifteen rings each with its numerous  chambers even when the whole shell is only as  large as the head of a small pin and in ages long  gone by the larger Orbitolites had a far greater num  ber of rings and thousands of chambers in one single  shell The animal builds these in the same way as we  have seen the Miliolite do it only after he has made  one round of chambers with a hole in each he puts  out slimethreads at every hole and joins them into a  ring with swellings in it like beads upon a string and  round these he builds the next row of chambers So  he goes on increasing his home till he reaches his full  size and then Professor Parker tells us that the slime  of the outer row often breaks up into myriads of young  Orbitolites just as the body of the Miliolite did At  the same time these forms can also multiply by merely  breaking in half as the naked Fingerslime does and if  by accident a piece of an Orbitolite is broken off it  can form a new and complete shell of its own  If you have now understood how the Orbitolite  grows you will see that the only communication it  has with the outer world is through the minute threads  which stretch out of the holes of the chambers in the  last ring see c Fig 4 and that the slime in all the  middle chambers can get food in no other way than  by its passing from the outside right through all the  other rings This is a tedious way of getting food  and we shall find that some of the forms shown in  Fig 4 have escaped from it in a most ingenious way  These forms d to h Fig 4 have hit upon the plan of  keeping their thin threads stretched out like the thread  slime a Fig i all the time they are laying down their  limehouse The consequence of this is that wherever  a thread has been there a minute hole like a pinprick  is left in the shell and while the animal can draw  itself quite in out of danger it can also come out all  over the shell and take in food Here then we have  another stratagem taught by life to these her infant  children The slime which builds the Globigerina a  or the Rotalia g is exactly the same as far as we  can see as the slime which builds the Miliolite and  yet those drops of slime have learnt a new lesson  and each one as it is born stretches out its fine threads  before constructing its shell thus providing a thou  sand openings for the entrance of its food in a house  not bigger than a grain of sand  And now it only remains for us to ask how long  these wondrous limebuilders have been upon the  earth We ask and ask in vain for we have no  means of counting the vast ages during which they  have lived and built One of the largest and most  complicated forms called the Numnmife from nummus  a coin which it resembles lived  and died in such millions before Fig 6  the Alps or the Carpathians had any  existence that whole beds of lime  stone thousands of feet thick and  stretching over hundreds of miles  are made entirely of its shells  while the little Globigerina d Fig  4 and its friends were living and A Nummulitewith  multiplying in still more dim and openowLgAe  distant periods till their shells accu chambers Life size  mulated into vast beds of chalk  When the ancient Egyptians raised the pyramids  of Egypt they little dreamed that every inch of the  stone they used was made of the shelly palaces of  the Nummulite constructed by little drops of slime  with a skill and ingenuity far surpassing their own  As little do most Parisians think now that the lime  stone of which their houses are built is almost entirely  made up of Orbitolite shells And still less does the  country boy as he strolls over the chalk downs of  Sussex or Hampshire suspect that the chalk under  his feet is largely composed of shells of the Globi  gerina and the other minute forms shown in Figure  4 yet so it is These minute slimebuilders have  been patiently living and building for untold ages  and are doing so still at the bottom of the Atlantic  where the Globigerina lives in such great numbers  that the falling of the shells through the water down  to the bottom must be like a constant shower of  snow as is proved by the freshness of those brought  up in the dredge  When a little of the chalky mud was taken up from  the bottom at the time when the Atlantic telegraph  was laid down it was found to be almost entirely com  posed of Globigerina shells and this led naturalists  who had long known that chalk was formed of shelly  matter to rub down some ordinary chalk and examine  it under the microscope and there again was our little  Globigerina often crushed and worn but still plainly  recognisable So that astounding as it may seem  it is nevertheless true that the vast beds of chalk  stretching from Ireland to the Crimea from Sweden  to Bordeaux are in great part formed of the dead  shells of these little drops of slime  We have paused so long over the limebuilders  that we can only glance at those minute specks of  slime which build their skeletons of flint instead of lime  These animals are  a little higher in  the world than the  lime builders for  their body has with  in it a small bag or  capsule buried in  the middle of the  slime see Fig 7  and in this bag  the solid grains lie  very thickly and  have sometimes  small crystals a  mong them while  in the slime round  it there are often  little oil globules floating If you dip a glass  into the quiet bays of Nice or Messina you may be  fortunate enough to bring up one or more of these  little sunslimes but they are so tiny and transparent  that even when the light falls upon them you will  only distinguish them as bright specks in the water  Their threads stick out stiff and straight and for this  reason they are all classed under the name Radiolaria  or raylike animals  Let us look for a moment at Fig 8 and study the  solid skeletons which these Radiolaria build with the  flint or silex which they find in minute quantities in  the water We saw that the limebuilders construct  The SunSlime Haeckel  Immensely magnified its real size being not  larger than a mustard seed  shells into ivhich they can draw back entirely if they  are attacked but the flintbuilders seem very careless  in this respect for they have large holes all over their  flinty skeletons But then on the other hand notice  how they send out sharp spikes which must be un  comfortable for any animal trying to snap at them  although as we have seen p 16 the soft thread  slime manages to suck their bodies out of the shells  Still these hard spiky outside skeletons must be a  great protection to them and we find every kind of  shape devised by these wonderful architects in the  construction of their tiny houses though these are so  small as to look like a grain of sand when seen by  the naked eye Perhaps the most wonderful of all is  the one shown at Fig 8 It is broken open to show  the three balls one within another each kept in its  place by rods of flint passing through the whole  This beautiful little shell looks just like the carved  balls of the Chinese yet instead of being the work of  intelligent man it is built by a mere mass of slime  We have now learned to know the simplest of all  animals how they live and move and the homes  they build All the forms are not quite equally  simple for some of the higher ones have a solid  spot or nucleus in the middle of the slime and some  times a small wateiy bubble as in the Monad or the  Bellflower which contracts and expands at intervals  and in these forms the outside of the slime is rather  thicker than the inside so that we might say that  they are on the road to having a skin while the  shellbuilders have a uniform slimy body But both  classes alike belong to that first and lowest branch  of the children of life called by scientific men the  Protozoa protos first zoon animal or first animals  The still water everywhere is swarming with them  though we may see and know nothing of them Yet  we owe them something for not only do the dead  shells of many of them form our solid ground but  those now living purify our waters by feeding upon  the living and dead matter in them These tiny  slime animals are the invisible scavengers of the ocean  and the pools and in earning their own living they  also work for others When you look upon a still  pond in some quiet country lane the insects you see  swimming about in it and the plants which cover it  are not the only inhabitants but on its surface and in  its silent depths minute specks of slime are living and  working though no eye can see them Beautiful and  wonderful however as these forms are they are yet  very low in the scale of life they live and increase  in multitudes but in multitudes also they die and are  devoured Delicate and frail and helpless they are  as it were but first attempts at the results which  life can accomplish Let us pass on and see the  next step towards higher and in many ways more  ambitious creatures  CHAPTER III  HOW SPONGES LIVE  And here were coral bowers  And grots of madrepores  And banks of sponge as soft and fair to eye  As eer was mossy bed  Whereon the woodnymphs lie  With languid limbs in summers sultry hours  SOUTHEY  HERE are certainly very few  people from the little child in  the nursery to the artist in his  studio or from the lady in her bed  room to the groom in the stables  who do not handle a sponge almost  every day of their lives and yet pro  bably not one in a hundred of these  people has ever really looked at  the sponge he or she is using or  considered what a curious and beau  tiful thing it is  Yet there are at least two things  in even the commonest sponges  which ought at once to attract attention If you  take a piece of ordinary honeycomb sponge in  your hand and look at it you cannot help being  struck by the large holes few and far between upon  its surface and the numberless small holes scattered  about between them and on looking carefully down  one of the large holes you will see that it leads to a  long tube into which a number of small tubes open  while on the other hand if you try to follow out any  of the smaller holes in the same way you will find  that they soon come to an end and branch out side  ways into each other so as to form an irregular net  work of short tubes Lastly if you cut the sponge open  and follow out this network you will discover that  it always ends by leading sooner or later into one  of the large tubes What is the reason of this com  plicated arrangement of holes all opening into each  other and by whom has it been planned and carried  out  Again an examination of the material of the  sponge will show that it is not a mere structureless  mass but is made up of delicate silkfibres woven  Fig 9 together into a kind of fine fluffy  gauze By putting a thin slice of  the sponge under a microscope  it is possible to distinguish this  gossamer tissue very clearly and  to see that it is quite loosely  woven and that it is only because  the texture is so fine and the  A thin fragment of a la y erS fit SO cl Sel y ne ab VC  bathsponge seen under the other that when looked at  the microscope f rom aDO ve it appears a solid sub  stance There is scarcely a more curious object under  the microscope than a thin slice of fine sponge though  it is almost impossible in a picture to show its curious  nestlike appearance How has this web been woven so  delicately What architect has laid the fibres so  skilfully and formed such a wonderful and intricate  structure  The architect is one of Lifes children whose his  tory we must next consider for though the sponge  was long thought to be a plant we now know that  it is the skeleton or framework of a slime animal  a little higher than those spoken of in the last  chapter When the sponge which you hold in your  hand was alive growing on the rocks in the warm  deep waters of the Grecian Archipelago or the  Red Sea it did not consist merely of the soft fibre  you now see but was covered all over the outside  and lined throughout even along the smallest of its  tubes with a film of slime This slime though it  appears to be all one mass with specks of solid matter  here and there is really made up of Amoebae or finger  slime beings see Fig 2 and if any little piece is torn  off it floats in the water and puts out fingers exactly  as the Amoeba does Nevertheless in the sponge  all these separate cells are not independent creatures  but form the flesh of one single sponge animal  which lives breathes feeds grows and gives forth  young ones in its ocean home  At the bottom of the warm seas on the Mediter  ranean coast or in the Gulf of Mexico these sponge  animals live in wild profusion sometimes hiding in  submarine caverns sometimes standing boldly on the  top of a slab of rock or often hanging under ledges  Some are round like cups some branched like trees  some thin and spread out like a fan while there is  scarcely a colour from a brilliant orange to a dull  dingy brown which is not to be seen among them  The floor on which they grow is often as beautiful  as they are themselves with its covering of tangled  seaweeds among which live the many shelled  creatures of the sea while fish swim hither and  thither and the whole region is teeming with life   Of seaborn kinds ten thousand thousand tribes  Find endless range for pasture and for sport  Such is the Spongekingdom and the whole colony  of sponges of every shape and size flourish like  monarchs in their domain So long as they are  alive few can attack them and fewer conquer or  destroy them Only the spongefisher diving down  into the rich colony disturbs its peace and tearing  the living sponge ruthlessly from its rocky bed  wrings out the living slime and destroys the animal  for the sake of its skeleton  Every three years this destroyer visits the  spongecolony for he knows that in spite of his having  carried off all the best and richest specimens this  interval is enough for new spongeanimals to have  grown up so as to weave large and perfect skeletons  What secret then has Life taught to the sponge  animal that while it is still only slime it can grow  into such large masses and protect itself so well against  the other inhabitants of the sea We will answer  this question by tracing the growth of a sponge from  its birth and reading its history  If you wish to watch a living sponge yourself  you have only to keep one in a saltwater aquarium  for small sponges are easily found alive on our  English coast though they will not look like those  we use In this description however we will ima  gine that we can visit one of the sponge colonies  in the Mediterranean Sea  or the Gulf of Mexico  where the rocks from fifty  to a hundred and fifty feet  below the surface of the  clear blue water are covered  with sponges of every size  and shape and texture  If we could visit these  sponge beds during the  summer or autumn months  and examine carefully the  slimy lining of one of the  big tubes of a living  sponge we should find that  minute bags of slime  i a Fig 1 1 are begin  ning to appear in it either  scattered through the  sponge or collected in heaps  These are spongeeggs out  of which young sponges  are to grow and in many  ways they are very like a hens egg Within  as may be seen through their transparent cover  ing is something which answers to the yelk of  an egg with a solid spot or nucleus in it This  yelk begins soon to divide into two cells or separate  masses of slime and these again divide into four  these four into eight and so on till the egg is a  globe of small round cells the beginning of the  young sponge And now a change may be seen to  A British sponge found at  Brighton lifesize  take place in those cells which lie all round the  outside of the rest each one of them puts forth a  minute whiplike lash called a cilium from cilium  an eyelash so as to form a fringe round the whole  body and then the young sponge being ready to  make its own way in the world bursts through the  skin of the bag and wav  ing its lashes swims out  an oval shaped body 2  Fig 1 1 into the sea  Here you will notice  we have a body not   made as in the simplest  The birth of the Sponge Adapted  from Carter slimeanimals of a mere  1

like a colony of monads see Fig 3  surrounding the animal  By means of these it swims along and feeds and  as it grows a small nipple c afterwards to become a  hole appears at the tip while a group of larger cells d  collect at the hinder end By means of these cells  the little animal attaches itself to the spot where it is  to spend the rest of its life sometimes to a pebble but  generally to the solid rock Small sponges often fix  themselves to living shells and Dr Johnstone tells us  that he met with a sponge on the back of a crab  which walked about quite unconcerned with its light  burden though it was many times larger than itself  Having settled the young sponge now spreads  itself out upon the rock and grows and builds up its  fibrous skeleton while its surface becomes irregular  and full of large and small holes and the true sponge  appears  And now comes the curious part of the story  As the sponge grows larger it is clear that the cells  in the middle of its body must be more and more  Fig 12  Development of a young English sponge Adapted from Carter  3 The swimming sponge of Fig 1 1 which has now fixed itself 4  The same with water squirting from the hole now formed 5 The  same further developed 6 The perfect sponge with small holes  where the water enters and large holes out of which it is squirted  shut out from the surrounding water out of which  food can be taken and yet these cells want feeding  as much as those outside In order to bring this  about the spongeanimal instead of growing up as a  solid mass of slimecells arranges the silky fibres of  its skeleton in such a manner as to leave a number of  small canals or passages throughout its body and these  open as we have seen sooner or later into large canals  or main thoroughfares while the slimy spongebody is  spread out as a thin film along them all In this  way it is possible for the seawater to reach right  throughout the whole body of the sponge along the  various canals But if this water only lay still from  day to day no fresh food could be brought and the  whole vould become stagnant and bad The animal  cannot feed or even breathe unless a constant fresh  supply of water full of oxygen and living beings is  driven through the canals  How is this to be done  At first sight it seems as if the young sponge  were behaving very foolishly in this matter for no  sooner has it settled down than it draws in all the  whip like hairs outside its body which we should  have thought would be useful for driving in food and  becomes a mass of smooth slimecells with large and  small holes scattered here and there Still as the  water goes on pouring out at the big holes see Fig  1 2 it is clear that it must be going in somewhere and  on cutting open the living sponge and watching it  at work the secret appears Here and there through  out the narrow canals of the skeleton are to be found  little chambers like two saucers face to face iFig I 3  and in these are arranged in rows a number of whip  like cells exactly like those which were before outside  the sponge It is the whips in these cells which do  the work required Waving ceaselessly to and fro  they drive the water before them always in one direc  tion so that it is drawn in at the small holes a a  Fig i 3 and driven out at the large ones b ti By  means of this wonderful contrivance fresh seawater  full of oxygen and living plants and animals is  always pouring along the small canals bringing air  and food to each cell along the road while the bad  water out of which the slime has taken all the oxy  gen and into w r hich it has thrown the hard parts and  refuse of its food is driven out at the large holes  carrying away with it all that is hurtful and useless  And now we can understand why the sponge  though a mere slimeanimal is classed as the pioneer  of the second division of living animals because in it  quite a new plan of structure has begun Starting from  one eggthe whole sponge is one single individual yet  when grown up it is not a mere mass all doing the same  work as in the simplest animals for it has learnt the  secret of division of labour and while one set of cells  those forming the smooth slime are busy taking in  food the other and whiplike cells are foraging for this  same food and sweeping away the refuse and be  tween these two a special layer of smooth cells is  employed in building up the skeleton which supports  the whole body  If we knew only the grownup sponge we might  look upon it as a society of two kinds of slime  animals living together and building a common house  But when we consider that each whole sponge comes  from a single egg growing and dividing like one of  the eggs of the higher animals and that any piece  of a spongeanimal is able to settle and grow up  into a perfect sponge with the two kinds of cells we  see that these animals have made a great step never  again to be forgotten by the children of Life They  have learned to form in one body two kinds of cells  with different duties which by their mutual labour  carry on in one being the work of life  We are now I hope able to picture to ourselves  the sponge growing upon the rocks in deep water or  sometimes in shallow pools or between the tide  marks looking like a smooth mass of slime of  different shapes with holes invariably open as long  as it is under water but closed as we shall find on  the English shores if the sponge is by chance left  high and dry by the tide We can imagine to our  selves the small fountains of water spouting from  the larger openings and carrying off the refuse from  the inside of the sponge and we can fancy we see  the small chambers buried in the canals with their  active inmates lashing the water onwards in its course  through the whole mass  But we have yet to consider the skeleton of the  living animal and why so much time and labour  should be spent in forming it There are two  reasons why a solid framework is useful to the  spongeanimal First it supports the large mass of  soft slime and enables it to spread itself out in thin  layers so as to touch the water in the canals and  secondly it protects it from enemies  There are a few sponges made entirely of slime  the canals and thoroughfares being in the slime itself  and in these when the animal dies and decaysnothing  solid is left behind But such sponges have probably  become degraded and have lost their skeleton and they  are clearly under a disadvantage for the walls of slime  are forced to be much thicker and food cannot reach  them so easily and besides this when we remember  how many seaanimals feed on living slime we can  not but see that these sponges offer a very tempting  feast Comparatively large animals such as shrimps  and fish will take big mouthfuls out of them while the  waterfleas and smaller seaworms which are carried  through their canals are quite as ready to eat the  slime as the slime is to eat them But if the sponge  can offer a very tough and unpalatable mouthful or  can prick its enemies mouths with a sharp point  they will not be so ready to take a second bite and  so it comes to pass that we find in sponges some of  the most curious weapons imaginable  The sponges we use are by no means the first  attempts at spongeskeletons on the contrary they  represent the highest art in spongebuilding The  simplest kind of sponges build their skeletons of  lime and flint as did the earlier slimeanimals Fig  14 is a picture of a lime sponge Here the outer  layer of sponge flesh has taken in lime and built  up with it a number of little pointed spikes or  spicules which lie buried in the  slime The rest of the sponge is  composed entirely of the sponge  animal the outer cells being smooth  and the inner ones whiplike so  that water and fojod are drawn in  at the small holes in the sides  while the refuse is driven out at the  large hole in the top  Now suppose that a fish attacks  this sponge instead of a mouthful   of soft slime he will bite upon a  number of minute sharp points   which he will carry away sticking  to the soft lining of his mouth  and the next time he sees such a  sponge growing he will hesitate  before touching it In some  Sponge with lime sponges these limethorns are so  spicules forming the arranged that they lie flat against  a complete hedge of spikes round  the holes when it is taking in water showing that it is  not only against the fish that it is protecting itself  but against the smaller but dangerous animals which  might be washed into it In another sponge the spic  ules point towards the mouth at the top so that any  creature which has got in can be easily thrown out  but one trying to get in would be spiked directly  Lime sponges  are to be found in  most parts of the  world and some of  them are very beau  tiful from the ar  rangement of their  spicules But these  look after all like  mere rough attempts  at spike building  when compared with  the wonderful spic  ules which are made  by the flint build Spicules of flint found in the flesh of  ing sponges flint sponges Real size a mere speck  Fig I5 shows almost invislble to the naked e y e  only a very few of the forms of flint spicules which  are known They look under the microscope as  if the sponge animal were an artist trying how  many curious patterns he could invent and yet  Dr Bowcrbank has shown that each of these  shapes has some special use either in keeping out  enemies in supporting the sponge or in spiking and  entangling the smaller animals which form the food  of the spongeanimal Often as many as from three  to seven different shapes may be found in one single  sponge forming by their combinations intricate and  beautiful patterns Yet each one of these spicules  perfect and complete in form as it is is so small as  to be barely visible as a speck to the naked eye and  so transparent that when mounted on glass for the  microscope it is impossible to detect even a group of  them without a lens  In Fig 1 6 may be seen three kinds in their natural  position in the flesh of the sponge the large ones  binding the sponge together and the small feathery  and anchorshaped spicules protecting the flesh and  jr ig j6 small as these last appear  yet they are even now  magnified 100 times  Lastly in the higher flint  buildingspongesthe archi  tect gets

that the flintlace of which it is made  has been constructed by an animal with no eyes to see  the beautiful pattern it was weaving and no machinery  in its body with which to direct the web and that out of  mere slime cells has arisen a fairy structure such as the  most skilled human artist might try in vain to rival  These sponges live chiefly in very deep water In one  of them called the glassrope sponge the animal is  anchored to the bottom by long flint threads often  several feet long looking like the finest spun glass  And now we find the  spongeanimal advancing  yet a step farther and  beginning no longer to  build entirely with lime  and flint taken from the  water but to manufacture  its own material We all  know that the spider spins  its web of threads of  gum formed in its body  and that the silk of the  silkworm is made in the  same manner and now we  have to learn that the  sponge animal with its  simple slime cells can do  this too For all the  sponges which we use are  made of fine fibres which  prove when examined to  differ very little chemically  from the silk of the silk  worm These fibres have  been secreted by the slime  animal out of its food and  by crossing and recross   y Venus Basket The skeleton of a  ing them in all directions flintsponge  it forms the soft elastic  skeleton of the toilet sponge Yet they are not woven  carelessly or without purpose for we have seen that they  are so arranged as to build up the small canals and  the large tubes in their right positions and though all  may look confused to us yet there is no part which the  water cannot reach in its passage through the sponge  At first in the coarser sponges the fibre is thick  and loosely woven and though it is toughand almost  impossible to bite or  digest yet it leaves  such large openings as  to afford but a poor  protection In these  sponges flint spicules  are still built in with  the fibrescattered about  in all directions and  because of the sharp  ness of the spicules  their skeletons are of  very little use to us  But little by little in  sponges of a finer web  in which the tough silky  Cupsponge growing in the sea Real cu v 1  size about a foot high Fignicr fibres are so ctosely  matted together as to  repel all intruders we find the spongeanimal begin  ning to neglect the formation of spicules and content  ing itself with building in fragments of sand making  those gritty sponges so disagreeable to handle And  by and by it ceases even to do this and in the fine  soft Turkey sponge we find the holes so small that  no enemy large enough to do harm could enter while  the densely woven fibres offer a most unpalatable and  indigestible morsel to any creature which might have  the strength to tear it away and these needing no  further protection are made entirely of soft fibre  Here we must leave the history of sponges and  their lives We have left much unsaid for to tell  how sponges may increase by dividing or by budding  as well as by eggs would have taken us too far into  detail neither could we give space to trace the  wonderful way in which the various spicules are used  as weapons of defence and for special examples of  the different kinds of sponges you must consult works  on natural history We have had one chief object in  view namely to see how Life in this new form has  advanced beyond the earliest slime animals The  sponge with its two forms of cells and its division of  labour stands already far above the microscopic  beings of our last chapter Rooted to the rocks and  large enough to invite the attacks of enemies it has  yet learnt to protect itself by wonderful structures  to distribute its food throughout a large body and  last but not least no longer to form its skeleton  merely f flint or lime but to manufacture in its own  body the material with which it builds  It has indeed succeeded so well that Dr Bower  bank one of the best authorities on sponge life came  to the conclusion that sponges are able to escape  almost entirely during their lifetime from becoming  the food of other animals It is only after their  death that their slime serves to nourish myriads of  minute creatures and then the wonderful rapidity  with which the living matter is devoured is quite  enough to prove to us how well the living sponge  must have used its weapons to protect itself while  still it was one of Lifes living children  CHAPTER IV  THE LASSOTHROWERS OF THE PONDS AND OCEANS   Transparent forms too fine for mortal sight  Their fluid bodies half

rearing  A new creation in the secret deep  MONTGOMERY   F among all the children of  life we wished to choose out  the most brilliant graceful and  sylphlike creatures whose histories  are more like fairy poems than  sober reality we could scarcely do  better than select those which we  are now going to study under the  name of the lassothrowers and  strange as this name may appear  I hope to show that it is not too  fanciful to be accurate  Every one knows that the long  cord or thong called the lasso is  the peculiar weapon of the South  From his earliest childhood the  American hunter  THE LA SSO THRO WERS  young Gaucho learns to play with the lasso and  almost as soon as he can walk amuses himself by  catching young birds and other animals round his  fathers hut throwing out the long lash so skilfully  that the noose falls over their bodies and brings them  to his feet As soon as he can ride he carries the  sport farther galloping wildly over the plains swing  ing the cord round his head and letting fly at the  ostriches the wild cattle and horses or when he is  a man even at the jaguar or the puma Such is the  lasso as man uses it consisting of a long cord or  thong thrown with exquisite skill  Now among animals as we have already seen any  weapons they are to Fi  use must be such as i 2  grow upon the body  and we should little  suspect that a simple  jellyanimal could be  provided with a lasso  ready grown within  its flesh Yet so it  is In that division  of lifes children  standing in rank just  above the sponges The freshwater hydra hanging from duck  we find a weapon of weed in a pond  i i i I The longarmed hydra feeding aw  this kind as simple small animals caught in its arms 2 Short  as deadly and far armed hydrat throwing off young hydra  more wonderful in buds b b  its action than the lasso of the American hunter  In almost any wayside pond in England it is pos  sible to find either hanging from under the leaves  of the common duckweed or clinging to pieces of  floating stick or rooted to stones at the bottom  of the pond a little greenish being Fig 19 about  a quarter of an inch long looking like a tube with a  circlet of feelers at the end which are waving in the  water This creature is the common pond hydra and  it is in fact nothing more than a tube or sac with a  sucker at one end to hold on with and a number of  jellyarms or tentacles at the other which serve to  catch its food and to tuck it into the sac where it  is digested The walls of the sac are firm and mus  cular and the creature can stretch itself out or draw  back at will can move along slowly by means of its  sucker and even float upon the water but the most  remarkable thing about it and the one we wish to  study now is the power which it has of overcoming  animals stronger and more active than itself  Groping about with its flexible arms which are  covered with fine jelly hairs by which it seems to  feel it touches perhaps a water flea a water worm  or even a tiny newly born fish passing by in the  water Instantly it twists its arms round whatever  it finds and though its prey may struggle vigorously  while the hydra remains almost still yet little by  little the struggles cease and the victim is drawn  into the fatal sac  Now why is this It is because those fine  tender feelers of the hydra are full of lassos which  it can use with as good effect as any skilled hunter  Although to the naked eye each tentacle looks but  little more than a fine hair yet when examined  under a strong microscope it is seen to be crowded  with hundreds of clear transparent cells l Fig 20  so small that 200 of the largest of them would lie  side by side in an inch while many are not more  than xsVftth of an inch long and each of these  cells contains a formidable weapon Within the cell  lying bathed in a poisonous fluid is coiled a long  delicate thread barbed at the base 2 3 Fig 20  and this thread  may well be call  ed a lasso since  it is always many  and often from  twenty to forty  times as long as  the cell itself and  only waits for the  bag to burst to  fling itself out to Piece of one of the hydra s arms showing  its full length the cells crowded in it 2 One of the cells  Now lookup 3 The same cell after bursting open 4 Lasso  cell of an anemone  at the hydra Fig  19 picture to yourself that each of its delicate  threadlike tentacles is crowded with hundreds of  these lassocells only waiting the word of command  to discharge their weapons By and by the two  worms a a come within reach and rub against the  tentacles instantly every cell that is touched bursts  open and with a spring its lasso is set free and  shoots out piercing through the skin of the worm  And now we can see where the hydras strength  lies He has no need to struggle for his victim is  pierced by a number of darts and the poisonous fluid  from the cells is pouring into him And there is  great reason why the hydra should take it so quietly  he does not wish to waste his lassos for a cell once  burst cannot be used again and he will have to  grow a new one for each one that he exhausts So  he waits patiently for the spell to work and does  not hug his victim too close until he is half conquered  and then he draws him gently in  So the hydra lives and catches its food without  needing to move far from the place of its birth All  the summer through it puts out buds see b b Fig  19 from its side and these buds as soon as their  tentacles are grown drop from their parent and settle  in life for themselves so that any pond may contain  hundreds of them and when the winter comes and  before they all die an egg appears near the base of  the tubes of those which are then living and these  eggs lie till next spring when they are hatched and  produce a new generation of hydras  This is the simplest lassothrower and I think  you will allow that his lasso is both wonderful and  deadly so that though these hydras are the only  lassothrowers to be found in fresh water it is easy  to understand that his relations in the wide ocean  should have made good use of the new weapon with  which life has provided them and secured homes and  restingplaces throughout the whole world of waters  and under all kinds of strange shapes and forms  From the North Sea to the Tropics from the  pools on the shore at low tide to the depths of the  wide ocean we meet everywhere with this division of   lassothrowers Now in the shape of large jellyfish  covering the sea for miles and miles so that a ship  may sail through them during many days the sailors  watching their transparent domes by day and being  illuminated by the light of their phosphorescence by  night Now as tiny jellybells floating like glistening  specks by millions in some quiet bay and breaking into  light as they are dashed upon the beach Or again  in the form of horny animaltrees often two or three  feet in height waving their gracefully arched branches  over the rocks in the deep water or creeping like  delicate threads over shells and stones and seaweed on  the shore where they are often mistaken for plants  There is scarcely a nook or cranny in the bed of  the ocean where some of these tree like forms are  not to be found associated with the beautiful sea  anemones with their brilliant colours of emerald  green crimson glowing purple and vivid orange  which belong to this same division as does also the  living coral nestling in the bosom of the warm Medi  terranean Sea or struggling boldly against the waves  of the Pacific as branch after branch is added to its  stem by the constant labours of the tiny jellypolyps  spreading their gaily coloured tentacles out of every  cup of the coral tree  All these beautiful creatures are lassothrowers  Scientific men call them Ccelenterata or hollowbodied  animals because of the large cavity within their  bodies and divide them into Hydrosoa water  animals and Actinozca raylike animals such as  the anemone but for us it is sufficient to know that  with very few exceptions they all seize their prey by  means of the lasso and we can pass on to learn  something of how they pass their lives  It is scarcely possible to collect seaweed on any  coast without finding upon it what look like minute  plants Fig 2 I with frequent joints Some of these  which are formed of chalk are true plants but others  which are yellowish and horny are no less certainly  animals and you may soon detect these by means of  a magnifying glass for they will bear at each joint  a little cup c c and if you could watch these cups  I The animaltree growing of the natural size 2 A piece of one  branch enlarged showing the animal b stretching out of the horny cup  c and one of the eggsacs s  when the creature is alive you would see out of each  one from 12 to 1 6 transparent tentacles b fr sweep  ing round in search of food  This treelike stem is in fact the home of a hydra  of the sea The creature itself is like the pond hydra  only that its buds do not fall off but continue to live  all together each enclosed in a cup made of a pecu  liar substance called chitin which is nearly allied to  horn and which also forms the skin of insects The  whole stem is only one individual for a fine living  thread passes down through the bottom of each cup  and meets all the others within the stem so that the  food digested in each tiny stomach goes to feed the  whole animal  Here then we have hundreds of tiny lassothrowers  acting as mouths and stomachs to one Sertularia as  this specimen is called Each mouth or polypite is  so small as scarcely to be seen even as a speck by  the naked eye yet it has sixteen tiny arms and each  arm is crowded with lassocells  And now in the summer months between May  and September small round bags S 2 Fig 2 i appear  scattered along the branches of this animaltree and  each one of these is full of eggs and by and by when  the eggs are hatched young sertularians swim out as  little round jelly bodies and settling down on some  stone or seaweed grow up into new stems of lasso  throwers  It is scarcely possible to conceive the number of  minute beings which are feeding in this way at the  bottom of the sea This particular sertularia or sea  oak coralline Fig 21 covers the seaweed of our  coasts with miniature animal forests and yet it is  one of the smaller kinds sometimes not more than  halfaninch high Others grow on shells forming a  fleecy covering which looks only like a little white  moss but which is really a group of living animals  Every child must be familiar with a kind of rough  crust frequently to be seen outside old shells but pro  bably few have ever thought that this is often the  remains of the home of a lasso thrower any more  than they would connect the tubelike branches on  the seaweed with a living animal  Try for one moment to picture to yourself some  quiet spot in the oceanbed where the whole floor is  carpeted with such forms and every shell and sea  weed carries some hundreds of tiny beings all  stretching out their waving tentacles and flinging out  their miniature lassos to strike their prey You would  see here and there among them tall graceful animal  trees such as the seafir which often grows up into  a brown upright tree more than three feet high with  branches bearing as many as a hundred thousand  cups each with its pure white polypite stretching out  and looking wonderfully delicate against the dark  stem while side by side with it may be standing  the tubehydraf which has single yellow pipes  out of each of which a brilliant scarlet creature is  waving its graceful tentacles All this life is active  and busy and yet it is all made up of beings so  insignificant to us that we have hardly any idea of  their existence  And while you were watching these thousands of  tiny arms you might perhaps witness a strange sight  if your eyes were sharp enough to see it From  an animal tree very like the sertularia i Fig 22  except that its horny cups are borne upon stalks  you might see escaping some little beings looking  like green shining bubbles and these if seen under  the microscope turn out to be the most beautiful  fairy jellybells 3 Fig 22 like pure crystal domes  swimming gaily along in the water by driving in and  out the jelly veil v 3 spread across their rim  Anything to exceed the delicacy and beauty of  these tiny jelly globes can scarcely be imagined and  1 Natural size of the animal tree s Natural size of the sac con  taining the jellybell 3 Natural

microscope all the different parts of the body as  shown at 3 Fig 22 can be clearly made out For  this bell is a true and delicately organised living  being It is a new instrument which Life has  invented for carrying the eggs of the animal  tree far away over the sea While the mouths  a a are busily catching food for the whole animal  by their lassos there has been growing on part  of the stem a bag S in which this little bell has  been formed and when it is ready to start on its  journey the bag opens at the tip and the bell  struggles out How gracefully it now drives itself  along by shooting water in and out of the hole in its  thin veil as it contracts and expands its rim and  from the water thus driven in its mouth m takes  the minute living beings and digesting them in its  tube t sends the nourishment down the canals to the  rim and so over the whole bell while in the little  bags o in the canals it forms and carries the eggs to  be dropped down on some distant spot to grow up  into a new animaltree  Thus this minute bell is a living active creature  with all the necessary parts for swimming and feed  ing and also for forming eggs to give birth to young  ones by and by Its whole body is crowded with  lassocells though it does not seem greatly to need  them and what is much more interesting in many  cases it even bears on its rim the first attempts at  eyes and ears  Often the passage of these tiny bells through the  water can only be traced by some bright spots like  coloured gems set in its rim b b 3 Fig 22 Blue  scarlet orange all the most vivid colours seem chosen  to give them brilliancy and inside the spots are in  some cases to be found little grains of lime which  roll to and fro and probably form the simplest hear  ing apparatus in nature while some crystals which  refract light are the first beginnings of eyes  Is it too much to say that these minute jellybells  are fearfully and wonderfully made and that our  imagination sinks appalled when we have to believe  that such complex beings have sprung from the tiny  buds on the animaltree i Fig 22  In the early summer the sea is full of these little  bells rising like constant bubbles from the animal  forest below Some are mere microscopic specks  others as large as thimbles while some look like  glass cups floating in the sea They are all more or  less tinted with lovely and delicate colours and though  an unpractised eye cannot distinguish them yet they  may be caught in a fine muslin net swept through  the water and examined under a microscope or in  an aquarium while on a calm evening when the sea  breaks in ripples on the sand their presence is  betrayed by the glow of phosphorescence fringing  the shore   Figured by hand Divine theres not a gem  Wrought by mans art to be compared with them  Soft brilliant tender through the wave they glow  And make the moonbeams brighter where they flow  And now we will rest our eyes from straining to  c co the microscopic lassothrowers and turn to some  of the large jellyfish of the sea for after watching  the floating bells we cannot doubt that those enor  mous jelly masses which we see sailing along in the  ocean are their near relations Indeed those who  swim and bathe in the sea can testify feelingly to the  power of the poisonous lassos for to be stung by a  jellyfish is no slight matter and this sting is given  by the lassocells  Though jellyfish however are uncomfortable to  meet in the water they are most interesting to watch  from a boat or the head of a pier as they move  along dome foremost with a regular movement as if  by clockwork We scarcely realise how large they  are till coming close to them we lay an oar over  them and find perhaps that the dome measures a  foot and often two or three feet across while their  tentacles stretch from the head to far beyond the  stern of an ordinary boat From spring to late  autumn they may be seen when the weather is calm  sailing on the water not by means of a veil like the  jellybells for they have none but by the movements  of their huge umbrella which they contract when  storms arise and so sink down into the depths  What is the history of these huge soft masses  First we must notice how very little solid matter  life has to use in building up their bulky forms for  when a jellyfish of four or five pounds weight is cast  on shore and dried up by the sun a film weighing a  few grains is all that remains the rest was all water  Yet the creature is wonderfully made Take for in  stance the jellyfish shown in Fig 23 Its tawny  jellowish umbrella is full of canals carrying the  nourishment over the whole animal In its margin  THE LASSO THROWERS  rudimentary eyes and ears are covered with a delicate  hood to shield them from harm Powerful muscles con  tract and expand  the rim of the um  brella guided by  nerves lately dis  covered in these  animals while the  rnouth of the hang  ing stomach itself  hidden under the  umbrella has long  tawny lips which  trail behind it like  ribbon sea weed  and are most for  midable weapons  for they are crowd  ed with powerful  and poisonous las  socells A creature  which this jellyfish  has once seized in  its lips must die  for even if it can  get loose from the  strong grasp the  poison works and  it soon floats dead  on the water  Shrimps barnacles  even the strong  animals of the sea are devoured by this ferocious  lasso thrower as he moves lazily through the  water expanding and contracting the rim of his dome  and if it were not that he and his fellows are the  chief food of whales and porpoises they would com  mit terrible havoc in the ocean as they travel in  shoals of thousands together  And now at certain seasons of the year when at  night the sea glows with their phosphorescence some  of these large wanderers drop from under their huge  umbrella something which looks like a shower of  dust This shower is composed of a number of  minute jellybodies a Fig 24 swimming by means  of lashes or cilia and something like those which come  from a sponge see p 38 They have been hatched  from eggs within the umbrella of the jellyfish and are  setting off into life for themselves After a few days  four curious knobs b Fig 24 begin to appear upon  them and these increase every day till at last the  swimming animal settles down on a rock and becomes  a small hydra feeding peacefully upon minute sea  animals by means of its tender threads  This then is the young of our jellyfish a common  hydra like that of the pond Moreover this young  hydra seems to forget all about its wandering parent  age and often goes on for several years budding into  other hydras and living as though it had never had  anything to do with a jellyfish  But at last one day a change comes over some of   The phosphorescence is due to a glutinous fluid exuded from the  umbrella This fluid when squeezed from a large jellyfish into twenty  seven ounces of cows milk made it so phosphorescent that a letter could  be read by the light at a distance of three feet  the hydras of the colony which may be greatgreat  grandbuds of the hydra which settled down  They lengthen out and their bodies divide into  rings c and d Fig 24 and as these rings grow  deeper and deeper the tentacles fall away from the  Fig 24  a Swimming jellybody b The same fixed to a rock which may  go on

top a complete saucer   and turning over so that the domed part is upper  most begins to contract and expand its rim and sails  away a minute jellyfish Other rings follow in its  path and the descendant of the fixed hydra has again  become a group of wandering lassothrowers  And now the floating domes begin to grow rapidly  in each one the umbrella thickens the stomach with  its huge lips begins to lengthen and expand the  eyespots develop under their hooded covering the  tentacles sweep out into the sea and the shoal of  terrible monster jellyfish is abroad again  all in motion  Far away upon the ocean  Going for the sake of going  Wheresoever waves are flowing  Wheresoever winds are blowing  And here we must leave them The history of all  jellyfish is not exactly alike for they do not all go  through the strange transformations just described  The beautiful purple Portuguese manofwar with its  rosetinted jellysail is born a wanderer like its parent  and so are also the lovely HangingBells which  have from ten to twelve and even sometimes as  many as sixty clear transparent bells hanging from  their stalk like blossoms on a flower while a clear  bubble shining like quicksilver serves as their float  These and many others have each their special history  for those who care to study them and even this brief  glance at the wandering lassothrowers will surely  lead us to look with more interest on the shapeless  dying lump of jelly on the seashore now that we  know it to have been an active living animal with  powerful weapons sensitive nerves and jewelled eyes  After following the free adventurous life of a  travelled jellyfish it seems almost like visiting some  quiet little country village to turn to the dreamy sea  anemones living from day to day in their rocky  pools How still and beautiful they are with their  brilliant greens and reds and yellows when after  lying closed like mere lumps of jelly they open out  into gorgeous flowers  The sea anemone really stands higher in life  than the hydra and its companions for the tube  of its body is double one  end being doubled back  within the other so as to  make a small sac hanging  within a large one while  a hole at the bottom of the  little sac or stomach opens  into the bodycavity below  The wall of the body be  tween thetwobagS is divided Section of a SeaAnemone  into a number of narrow having special darts d  which shoot out when it is at  partitions j Fig 25 upon tacked m Mouth s Stomach  the Sides of which the eggs showing the partitions on the   sides of which the eggs are  of the young anemones are f ormeL ff Co il of lassothreads  formed and OUt of which in the stomach t Tentacles  the tentacles spring as hoi f are crowded with lass  low tubes  Yet it is more in the way of fleshy growth than  in sagacity that the anemone has advanced for in  sensitiveness to light and power of movement he is  far behind the floating jellyfish This is indeed to  be expected for in his quiet stayathome life he  needs a strong muscular body but not active senses  and so we find that while his lassos are powerful and  many his sight is only enough to lead him to move  towards the light and he shifts slowly along when he  wishes to change his place or floats with his disk  upwards without being able to choose his own path  His fishing and feeding powers on the contrary  are very great Any one who has placed his finger  among the tentacles of a seaanemone will have felt  how they cling to it so that it is not always easy  to draw it away The touch has in fact burst a  number of lassocells and the threads have pierced  the flesh though they are too fine to give pain Mr  Gosse once cut off a piece of his own skin with a  razor and put it to the tentacles of the dahlia  anemone Tealia crassicomis and when he afterwards  examined it under the microscope he found it full of  lassothreads standing up like pins in the skin and  showing what wounds an anemone can inflict Now  when we reflect what a large number of tentacles  many anemones have a fullgrown daisy anemone has  more than seven hundred we see that they must  possess an almost countless number of lassocells  and that small sea animals such as shrimps worms  mussels seaslugs and young fish must fall easy  victims to the poisonous threads Even if any crea  ture is so well protected by its shell as to escape the  darts it is encircled by the numerous arms and thrust  into the stomach at the bottom of which it meets  with another thick coil of lassothreads c Fig 25  which are soon fatal  In this way the seaanemones obtain abundance  of food and they seem able to devour an almost  unlimited amount But they in their turn are evi  dently very open to attack having such soft defence  less bodies and in fact thousands of them must be  devoured every day by seaslugs and other animals for  they multiply so very rapidly that otherwise the whole  shore would be covered with them A seaanemone  can increase in three ways either by splitting in half  or by throwing out buds or as is most common by  hatching the young from eggs within its body It is  most curious to see in an aquarium how quickly a  crop of young seaanemones springs up round the old  ones Mr Holdsworth found that daisy anemones  sometimes throw out as many as 146 160 and even  300 in one day It is very difficult to see the young  anemones born because they are at first so small  but by careful watching they may be seen coming  out through the mouth of their parent sometimes in  the shape of little hairy or ciliated swimming bodies  but more often as perfect tiny anemones which have  lived inside their mother till their tentacles have  grown After they have been hatched among the  partitions in the anemones body they generally travel  into her hollow tentacles and from there they are  passed out through the mouth Then after walking  about a little while on the tips of their tiny arms  they settle down and begin their life  The first thing they learn to do is to expand to  find food and this they do by taking in water at  their mouth or through their skin and so swelling out  the whole body But should an enemy come by  they soon force the water out again and become a  small lump very difficult to seize It is most  interesting to watch an anemone when it wishes to  expand gradually filling itself with water and  stretching its tender skin till each tentacle falls in its  place as a graceful flexible tube and then again in a  moment if you touch it the water is squirted out and  every delicate part drawn in within its tough hide  But if you touch a daisy anemone or a cave  dwelling anemone in this way you will find that it  has another weapon of defence hidden in the body  tube itself All the members of this family of  anemones Sagartiadcz have minute slits scattered  over the outside of their tube and if you offend them  these slits open and long white threads d Fig 25  are shot out to strike you These threads come from  the coil of lassos within the body they are not them  selves lassos but long darts crowded with lassocells  and after they have punished the enemy that attacks  them they can be drawn in again to be used next  time By far the larger number of British anemones  have these darts called Acontia so that we find even  these sluggish stayathomes well able to fight the  battle of life  But mingled in among these soft lassothrowers  even on our English shores we find small examples  of a still more wonderful race whose history in the  warm depths of the Mediterranean and amidst the  stormy surge of the Pacific is like a fairy poem Who  has not heard of the groves of lovely red coral seen  through the clear blue waters off the coasts of Corsica  and Sardinia or read of those islands which are built  in the midst of the stormy Pacific by the delicate  coral animal There in the midst of violent foam  ing breakers strong circular stony reefs crowned with  delicate white sand and shaded by the cocoanut  palm enclose those peaceful lagoons where   Life in rare and beautiful forms  Is sporting amid the bowers of stone  And is safe when the wrathful spirit of storrm  Has made the top of the waves his own  And the coralanimal which builds alike the blender  pink stem of the coral ornament and whole islands  of rock in the midst of the sea is a lassothrower  In the Mediterranean he is a delicate dainty  being beginning life as a little jellybody thrown out  of the mouth of a pure white polyp growing out of a  red coral branch This jellybody soon settles down  on the seabottom a Fig 27 and spreading out its  tentacles b Fig 27 to feed takes carbonate of lime  from the water and colouring it we scarcely know how  begins to build with it red spikes or spicules into its  jelly flesh only into its mouth and stomach it lays no  spicules but leaves them soft and white Then after  a while it begins to throw off buds as we have seen  the hydra do and some anemones and each of these  buds remains on the stem pure and white while the  jelly full of red spicules joins them all together  c Fig 27 And then as more and more buds are  formed

water over their heads is all they ask in order  to flourish happily and send out plenty of young ones  to keep up the colony and though they have their  enemies in the seaworms and in the fish which nibble  at their tender flesh yet by means of their spicules  they hold their own while with their lassos they catch  their prey  A far hardier and more sturdy animal is the  builder of the white coral as he stands out in the  midst of the wild Pa  cific the stormy sea  dashing against his  home while he has  nothing but the power  of life and growth  to bring against it  Nevertheless he not  only lives but builds  strong stony barriers  which shut out the rest  less waves and enclose  calmstill salt lagoons  in whose depths more  delicate corals can  nestle and flourish  To understand how  the white coral builds  its skeleton we must  look back to the sea  anemone and to the  partitions in the wall  of its body p 67  The white coral is in  fact a group of sea  anemones all growing together and throwing out  buds which remain on the stem and each bud as it  takes the carbonate of lime out of the water builds  it up in solid layers between those partitions in its  body If you can find at the seaside the little Devon  shire cupcoral Fig 30 which is a single coral of this  kind you will be able to see clearly these solid par  titions entirely enclosing the body In this way the  animal is fairly shut in only the stomach with its  mouth and tentacles remaining free and as it buds  and buds feeding greedily with its lassos and laying  down lime particle by particle out of the restless  sea it builds a firm skeleton sometimes branched  see Fig 29 some  Fig 30  times solid as in  the brain coral  according to the  way in which the  buds are given off  one from the other  And

the sea carried down the dead coral as a solid  wall is a story which belongs to geology Here we  have only to picture the living animal tiny and tender  yet strong in its two great powers the power of  catching and feeding on the creatures of the sea and  the power of building a solid skeleton with the grains  of lime In this way day by day stretching out  their tender arms and flinging their lassos by millions  and millions in the midst of the wild Pacific the  coral animals live and grow In the midst of winds  and storms they struggle on the rough and strong  builders without in the open ocean the more tender  and delicate ones with their bright coloured orange  crimson scarlet and purple tentacles within the shel  tered lagoons they all make good use of the weapons  with which life provides them and flourish in countless  numbers enjoying the warmth of the tropical sea and  laying the foundation of solid rocks for ages to come  This brings us to the end of our brief sketch of  the lassothrowers of which the sea is so full Though  we have scarcely been able to glance even at the  leading forms we can understand how they are able  to maintain their ground in the struggle for life  One and all they sweep the waters with their tiny  arms and whether as animal trees jellyfish ane  mones or corals multiply in great numbers and fill  the sea with beautiful active life If only as food  for other animals they have their great use in the  world for the huge whale is greatly dependent for his  nourishment upon the shoals of jellyfish which throng  the Arctic ocean and many shellfish and other sea  animals feed upon the anemones and delicate polypes  on the seabottom But beyond their use to others  is the great fact that they live and flourish themselves  like the rest of Lifes children they crowd into the  world and as we watch thm during their brief career  we cannot but think that there is enjoyment in these  fragile existences as they open out so freely and  eagerly in the depths of the quiet ocean and that  from them too rises the silent hymn of praise for the  gift of life even if it have its struggles and its dangers  CHAPTER V  HOW STARFISH WALK AND

their nation  SPENSER  NCE upon a time in a quiet  seabay on the south shores of  Great Britain five curious little  oval jelly bodies were swimming  about by their jellylashes in  the depths of the smooth water  They had one and all been   hatched from eggs not long be  fore and their business and duty  in life was to grow up into some  form in which they could gain their  living and protect themselves from  harm  As each one came from a parent  of a different shape and character it was natural that  they should follow different roads although they all  worked much upon the same general plan and though  they were so small as to be scarcely visible they soon  began to put on each their own peculiar shape  No I had not swum about for many hours before  some limeplates began to form in his body arrang  ing themselves in the shape of a cup a A Fig 31  and below these other and smaller plates took up  the form of a stalk b  This went on for several  days while the jellybody  fed and swam about like  any other living animal  but it proved after all to  be only the cradle of the  real creature for after a  time the jellybody began  to shrink up and the  whole sank to the bottom  of the sea and a strong  limeplate was formed  which fastened the lime  A The jelly animal swimming Stalk to the rock where  by its lashes The cup b The the an j mal re mained  stem c The fixing plate of

spread  over the stem and cup The jellyanimal had in  fact become transformed into a Crinoid or Stone  Lily about halfaninch high which soon put out  jointed arms from its cup and fed in the water and

to float and feed in this shape for a  considerable time Meanwhile just within his mouth  some small cells appeared which gradually formed  themselves into a round disc By and by it was  clear that a trelliswork of lime was forming over this  disc b Fig 32 and five tiny stony arms c began  to grow out of it like the rays of a star Still how  ever the jelly animal continued to feed through its  jelly mouth like any other living being Then after  a time during which there was built up within the  disc a stomach a mouth and a set of tubes for taking  in water the disc with its sprouting arms all at once  dropped off its rods and swallowed up the jellybody  drawing it in till only a thin film was left over the  stony star Then after swimming about for a little  time it settled down upon the rock and wriggled  about a tiny Brittle StarFish B Fig 32  A Jellyanimal swimming about and the starfish forming within it  A The starfish settling down B The same assuming its true shape  No 3 followed much the same course as No 2  except that his jellybody had no rods in it but  took a number of curious shapes and swam about  briskly while within was formed a young creature  with a network of lime over his back A Fig 33 and  a number of small soft transparent tubes under his  body After a time the whole fell to the bottom of  the sea and this little creature also swallowed his jelly  body and becoming a tiny yellow rosette with five  knobs sticking out of it glided quickly away over  the rocks carried along by the little tubes under the  rosette It went on growing for two or three years  lengthening the five knobs into pointed rays and  became the common Five Fingered Starfish  that had gone before him He  too had long thin rods in his  body all pointing one way  so that his body looked like  a painters easel and at the top  of the easel a number of fine  plates of lime began to form  in the shape of a tiny round  box b Fig 3 4 A with prickles  all over it and by and by this  box sucked up the jellybody  leaving only a thin film over its  shell and sinking to the bottom  a tiny SeaUrchin burrowed  a hole for itself in the sand  Lastly No 5 did not form  anything

shall understand better presently let us first visit  the common starfish after his arms are full grown  as we sometimes find him on the sand of the sea  shore thrown up by the waves A strange and   The jelly animal does not always swim about in the water  while forming its future body Some starfishes and seaurchins carry  their young in a kind of pouch or tent till they have taken shape  t Echinodermata or hedgehogskinned  weird life he leads clinging to the wet roofs and sides  of caverns or hiding under large stones or wandering  over the sand at low tide with the water rippling  gently over his body the sea must appear to him  in a very different light from what it does to the  coralbuilders or jellyfish as they wave about their  soft tentacles and bathe them in the element they  love  For the real interest of the starfish is not in the  sea above but in the solid ground below He cares  for the water only that he may get oxygen out of it  to breathe for though he can swim when it is neces  sary yet he is really a creeping animal and loves to  climb over the rocks or poke about the sandy bottom  with his mouth down to the ground feeding on mus  sels and other shellfish wherever he can find them  No ghost could glide more smoothly or with less  noise than he does as he wanders dreamily along  and when he comes to a wall of rock or a hollow in  the sand he does not avoid them but bends his body  over the one or slides down the other hugging the  ground closely as he goes And yet the machinery  by which he moves is nowhere to be seen nor will  you be able to guess how it works till you pick up the  first living starfish left upon the shore as the tide  goes down and put it into a glass pan or jar of salt  water Then you will be able to watch this curious  movement through the glass At first he will lie  helplessly at the bottom but very soon although as  you look down upon him you will not see any special  part move the whole body will begin to glide slowly  along Now lift the jar and look at the under part  of the body You will see hundreds of tiny trans  parent tubes moving in the groove under each of his  five rays A Fig 36 and 1 1 Fig 37 The whole of  the under part of his body will be waving like a field  of corn as each tubefoot in its turn is stretched out  bent forward and fastened to the glass Then after  drawing the body a little on it will loosen again and  collapse into a mere knob while another will lengthen  out and take a hold In this way as tube after tube  draws it forwards the body of the starfish will be  A The common fivefingered Starfish The dark round spot  between the lower rays is the waterhole B The Brittle Starfish t  carried easily along the bottom or up the sides of the  glass like a canopy resting upon the heads of more  than two thousand bearers  And now if you look in the centre of the under  part of his body you will see a small opening with  the skin puckered up round it This is his mouth  m Fig 37 and if ycu place a small mussel or lim  pet against the glass on his road you will see a curious  sight He will glide gently over it as though it were  a mere stone till his mouth is just above it then the  middle of the body will rise a little and the feet all  round the mouth fixing themselves firmly to the  mussel will draw it into the opening where it will  remain till all its soft body is sucked out and then  the empty shell will return  If however the shellfish is too large to go into  the mouth the starfish will apply its lips to it and  often push its stomachbag S Fig 37 out at the  opening and half cover its victim and after a time  when it draws back the soft animal will be gone and  only the shell remain  A The central body S The stomach m The mouth h Per  forated hole

v Vesicles or waterbags supplying the tube feet with  water i Liver  The starfish then is a kind of walking stomach  borne along by hundreds of tiny feet ceaselessly  moving in each of its five rays and it is the working  of these feet which we must now explain To picture  to yourself the inside of a starfish imagine a round  central dome covered hall A Fig 37 in the floor  of which is a trap door m the mouth and out of  which open five stately arched corridors one of which  is shown in Fig 37 which begin as lofty galleries  and end in a point where a tiny window e vs set  The roof and floor of the corridors are built of deli  cate white columns and arches of lime joined by soft  ligaments while the walls are inlaid with starlike  plates and within the dome and stretching right  out into each corridor lies the soft body of the ani  mal S z Fig 37 with its digestive organs The  delicate telegraph of nerves and the watercanal  starting from the central hall pass like the wires  and pipes of our houses under the floor of each cor  ridor while the numberless little waterbags which  move the regiment of feet pierce the floor and lie in  the corridor itself  And now how does this apparatus work Remem  bering as we do that the anemone spreads out its  tentacles by filling them with water we shall expect  that something of fhis kind also happens here only  that we require besides to explain how the feet cling  so firmly to the ground for in some cases they will  even break off from the body sooner than release  their hold  If you look carefully at the back of a starfish  you will find a little round spot see A Fig 36 and  i Fig 37 lying at one side in the angle between  two of the rays This spot is a little plate of lime  pierced with fine holes just like the rose of a water  ingpot and through it seawater carefully filtered  passes down a tube into a hollow ring r round the  animals mouth and this ring opens again into canals  which pass along under each of the rays Here then  we have a regular watersupply taken in at the porous  plate and carried along all the five rays But we  want next a separate cistern for each tubefoot for  we have seen that they move separately and so can  not all be filled with water at the same time These  separate cisterns we find in a number of elastic bags  or vesicles v v Fig 3 7 placed along the watercanals  and opening into them on the one hand and on the  other into the tubefeet Now when water is taken  in at the grating h above the canals are filled and  they fill the vesicles and each vesicle is able to con  tract and force its water down into its own foottube  thus stretching it out Then the foottube while  stretched at full length can by drawing in its walls a  little force some water back and so draw up the  centre of the round cushion at the end of its tube  making a sucker just as a schoolboy does with wet  leather on a pavement then the foot holds fast  Lastly by drawing up the muscles which run down  the tube the body is drawn on the sucker released  and the foot pulled back to begin again  This is how the starfish walks and when we re  member how many hundreds of feet he has how  firmly each one holds and how slightly it moves we  cease to wonder that he glides so smoothly and clings  so firmly to the rock He is a greedy creature whose  whole care is his stomach and he will eat any animal  food he can find from small crabs shellfish and  other seacreatures to mere garbage and decaying  matter so that he is very useful as a scavenger of the  sea He in his turn is eaten by the cod the haddock  and other fish but he is better protected from smaller  This grating is called the Madreporiform tubercle  enemies than would appear at first sight His thick  skin contains a network of hard scales which will  turn the edge of a knife if you try to cut it while  pointed spines j stand in ridges on his back and  on the sides of the rays thus protecting the tubefeet  But the most curious weapons he possesses are a  number of minute claws like birds beaks mounted  on stalks V Fig 37 which stand round his spines  and twist and snap continually as long as he is  alive The only use that has yet been found for  these curious weapons is to clear the skin of the  starfish from the seaweeds and small animals which  would certainly fix themselves on such a sluggish  animal if they were not picked off We shall see  presently in the seaurchin that they are sometimes  very active in this work  And now as the starfish plods on his way along the  seabottom thinking only of the creatures over which  he can spread his capacious mouth what has he to  tell him of coming danger How shall he be warned  if the shadow of an enemy is passing over him or if  he is venturing too rashly into the broad sunlight  where his bright colours might attract dangerous  attention If you notice any starfish when it is  alarmed or finds itself in strange quarters you will  see it curl up the tips of its rays and there under  the point of each ray e Fig 37 may be seen with a  magnifying glass a thick red spot seated on the ex  tremity of a nerve and having in it as many as from  100 to 200 crystal lenses surrounded by red cells  Here then we have a far better eye than that which  we found in the jellyfish and it is no wonder that  the starfish is so quick in finding food or enrages the  fishermen by discovering the bait which they put for  other animals for it turns out that this heavy stupid  looking animal is much more wideawake than he  appears In many cases a soft lid or feeler hangs  over the eyespot giving to it a curiously intelligent  look and Professor Forbes relates how once when a  beautifully delicate starfish called the Lingthorn fell  to pieces as he tried to lift it out of the water this lid  at the end of one of the arms opened and closed with  something exceedingly like a wink of derision  Our first walking animal then is by no means a poor  or feeble creature he has chainarmour woven into his  leathery skin with sharp spikes and snapping claws to  protect him a good digestion and a capacious mouth  to feed his greedy stomach a good array of nerves  quick feeling and eyesight together with a wonderful  apparatus for moving over the ground and when we  add to this that if he loses any of his rays he can  close over the wound and grow a new limb we see  that his powers of living satisfactorily are very great  We must not suppose however that the curious  walking apparatus of the starfish is perfect in all his  relations or that they all walk by means of suckers  any more than all spongeanimals can build a toilet  sponge or all slime animals make fine chambered  shells The rosy featherstar for example Fig 3 8 as  it sits clasping the rock or a bunch of seaweed with  the fine strong tendrils which grow out of its back  waving its arms like a group of brilliant red plumes  spotted with bright yellow has no need to use any  feettubes though it is a starfish and those which  it has probably serve merely as a help in breathing  You will at first be puzzled to think how this  featherlike fixed animal can be a starfish at all but if  you examine it carefully you will find that it is indeed  one only turned upside down Its back which is  held down to the rock by some claws c which grow  upon it forms a cup in which lie the soft parts of its  body with a mouth m in the middle of course  turned upwards and surrounded by tentacles Its  five arms have divided each into two making ten  stony jointed rays r and on these a number of  finer jointed filaments give the appearance of feathers  Within a groove of each arm lie the feettubes but they  have no suckers for the featherstar rarely walks and  then only wriggles in a clumsy manner something  like a brittlestar It usually remains anchored feed  ing on the minute beings in the water which it drives  into its mouth by hundreds of cilia or jellylashes  which line the grooves of the arms  It does not care to move at any time though it  can swim gracefully through the water when disturbed  from its hold But in its infancy it was not even  free to do this for the lovely featherstar is nothing  more than the cup of the little stonelily A Fig 38  and Fig 31 which has broken from its stem and  grown up into a free animal In the early spring you  may find it in its infant state in the quiet bays of our  west coast or of Ireland like a white or yellow stony  flower growing on fronds of seaweed or on small stony  corals Its stem of jointed plates is covered with a  film of living matter and its cup has the stony threads  hanging down from it which afterwards serve as  claws to hold it to the rock In the autumn you will  find it so no more The cup a Fig 31 p 78  floating off its stem will have emancipated itself  from the race of fixed stonelilies and joined the  free starfish thus forming a curious link between  these two groups of animals It still however keeps  much of its old habits and while it can swim grace  fully from place to place loves better to cling to the  nearest rock or weed feeding upside down as com  pared to its new companions and waving its deep  red plumes a harmless thing of beauty  Not so the brittlestar B Fig 36 which as we  saw in Fig 32 was a free being from the first and is  as voracious as the common starfish and much more  active In some ways however it is like the feather  star for it has strong jointed suckerless arms and  feet which it never uses for walking although it  fills them through a porous plate like the starfish  Its soft body too is all contained within the round  cup in the centre and its arms do not open out of  it as in the starfish but are joined on and this may  partly explain why it so often flings its arms into a  hundred pieces when frightened for it can afford to  part with them and can soon form them again  As tools and weapons however they are most  useful and the reason why the brittlestar does not  use its tubes as feet is that its arms are quite  sufficient to carry it along Made of a number  of small plates joined together by elastic muscles  and fringed with hooks and spines these stony rays  serve both as walking and feeding apparatus The  animal twists them to and fro in all manner of  contortions and in this way is carried over the rocks  at a surprising pace while it can bury itself in the  sand and mud with the greatest ease or wriggle into  the smallest crevices if it fears to be attacked  If the starfish is remarkable for its smooth gliding  motion the brittlestar is the prince of wrigglers and  must escape many dangers by its bewildering activity  Indeed we may almost fancy that its enemies may  be as startled at its wild contortions as the fishermen  were who dredged the brittlestars up for Professor Ed  ward Forbes and begged to be allowed to throw them  back saying the things werent altogether right  On the other hand there is little doubt that they  use their arms to carry food to the mouth and one  of this family called the BasketFish has its rays  so branched and curled that they interlace forming  a stony network in which crabs and small fishes are  entangled and so caught for food  Here we have then three types of pricklyskinned  animals all bearing rays and all having the same pecu  liar watertubes yet each of them has his own differ  ent life the featherstar scarcely yet caring for his  freedom feeding almost in the same way as the  polyps do among the lassothrowers the brittlestar  with his active restless arms wriggling into cracks  and seizing young crabs and shellfish in his grasp  and the gliding starfish with its thousands of tube  feet creeping over its victims and carrying havoc  wherever it goes  But we have by no means yet exhausted the  quaint designs of this ray like structure on the  contrary we come now to the most fantastic and  whimsical creatures not only among the tubefooted  animals but perhaps among all the inhabitants of  the sea  Is it because the seaurchins know themselves to  be as grotesque as the goblins of fairy tales and as  uncanny as rolled up hedgehogs seen in the dim  moonlight that they hide themselves so persistently  in the cracks of rocky pools or bore holes in the  limestone in which to hide their prickly bodies or  wrap themselves up in seaweed packed deftly between  their spines Or is it not more likely that they  know too well the brittleness of their formidable  looking spines and either keep out of the way of the  rolling waves and currents or protect themselves from  their violence by a padding of soft seaweed  Be this as it may they are not always easy to  find alive unless by those who know their haunts  under large stones on the sand or who fish for them  in deep water yet they are plentiful on all our  coasts and most people have picked up fragments of  their shells upon the beach When they are found  however and placed in salt water they well repay  the trouble of a search if only because they are so  different from anything we have seen before  Imagine a hedgehog rolled up tightly into a ball  and beginning to walk along not on his feet but on  the tips of his spines as if on stilts and putting out  here and there long fine tubes like threads of gutta  percha to anchor himself on his road and you will  have a fair picture of a walking echinus or seaurchin  as he moves slowly along an aquarium or over the  rocks on the seashore There is something singu  larly whimsical in the  movement of this prickly  ball as it gravely lifts  some of its sucker feet to  plant others guiding it  self the while by its  movable spines Each  spine looks so knowing  turning itself round by  its ballandsocket joint  apparently making its  own little excursions  ASeaUrchinwalkingonarock w i t h OU t regard to what   Walkng tubes the other spines are doing  and in large specimens  where the little claws can be seen round the spines  twisting and snapping incessantly the effect is more  comical than can be expressed in a description  But our seaurchin is something more than amus  ing he is a most wonderful example of how animals  can be built upon the same plan and yet so altered to  suit their life that we should scarcely recognise them  as relations Looking at a seaurchin who would be  lieve that it has anything in common with the star  fish Yet if you examine it without its spines a rough  description will soon explain how alike they are  Suppose you were to take a dead starfish and  bend its rays backwards till they meet round the  disc of the back sew the  tips there and then sew  the five rays together up  the sides so as to form a  ball flattened in the mid  dle you would then have  the mouth of the animal  m Figs 37 and 40 un  derneath the ball and the  five rows of feet A Fig  36 A Fig 40 running A Sea Urchin after its spines have  Up it While the edge of been rubbed off  each ray where there are m Mouth fh Foot holes  no feet would touch throu g h which the alkin g tubes  pass wn The water hole e Eyes  the edge of the next S Sockets of larger spines  ray making two rows of  footless strips between each group of suckers If  you could now blow out this ball so that the mouth  and back were some distance apart and the whole  was round this would roughly represent our sea  urchin without its spines  We see then that the tiny urchin which came out  of the jellyanimal No 4 grew up strictly according  to the true raylike or radiate plan and yet what a  change he has made and what a snug home he has  formed round his body  By laying down plates of lime within his soft flesh  he has built a strong box in which all his soft parts  are enclosed and at the same time has managed to keep  a complete communication with the outer world His  suckerfeet which act exactly like those of the star  fish lie safely within the box till he needs them and  then each one is put out at a tiny hole like a pin  prick in one of the rows JK The porous plate  wJi supplying them with water is at the top of the  shell in the back where it would be in the starfish  and in the other plates near it are the openings out  of which it passes its eggs But where are its eyes  Consider for a moment where they ought to be upon  the star fish plan At the tip of each ray and  therefore when the rays are turned up so that the  tips meet round the back they will be at the top of  the shell where you will find five small holes contain  ing eyes e not so perfect as those of the starfish  but sufficient to see light  Could a stronger or safer fortress have been  designed even by the most ingenious engineer No  single soft spot is left bare to attack except the skin  round the mouth and this is always turned to the  ground and defended by the spines projecting on all  sides The mouth itself is a most complicated piece  of mechanism with five strong teeth set in powerful  jaws which lie inside the shell  And now how is this box to grow The tiny  seaurchin left nestling in the seaweed has to grow up  to a large animal sometimes as big as a pomegranate  and yet its body is tightly shut in within lime walls  Look again at the shell after it is stripped of its  spines Fig 40 and you will see that it is made of  more than a hundred separate plates While the  animal is living these plates are covered within and  without by a slimy film and this film passes also  between each plate Now as the animal grows it  takes fresh lime from the seawater into this film  and places it atom by atom evenly on the edges of  the plates and so the shell grows with the body with  out disturbing any part and if this does not give  sufficient room it can also add some plates to the  top of the shell at the end of each ray  So the seaurchin lives and grows wandering over  the seaweed beds and grazing with his powerful jaws  as a sheep grazes in a meadow Though the shells  of animals are sometimes found in his stomach they  are not his proper food for he is a vegetarian and  might probably almost be said to chew the cud in  his powerful jaws which Aristotle called by the  curious name of lantern from their peculiar shape  He has many powerful enemies and his shell is  often found in the stomachs of large fish and other  seaanimals so that besides his strong box he has  great need of his spines for protection and he can  give very sharp pricks with them from out of his  hidingplaces when he is interfered with His spines  however serve many other purposes They guide  him when he walks they help him to burrow in the  sand they have even been seen passing seaweed and  other objects over his body and they help the little  snapping claws to clear away any refuse which may  gather on the shell Lastly the seaurchin which  like the starfish often protects its young ones in their  soft infancy will sometimes gather the spines together  at the top of its house and so form a tent for the  tender young urchins till they are fit to go alone  The snapping claws which we found before in the  starfish exist in numbers on the shell of the Echinus  and are very puzzling they are so very active and  yet seem to do so little work They have often  however been seen passing away the little pellets of  refuse food which come out of a hole in the top of  the shell These pellets are handed down from claw  to claw till they can be dropped into the water and  so got rid of In the same way small worms and  seeds of plants and other living things are cleared off  the bristling shell by these busy little snapping beaks  The spines by their constant movement help as we  have seen in this cleaning process and have probably  many uses not known to us  Who will say when he examines the structure and  studies the habits of the Echinus that this child of  life is not a quaint clever wonderful and skilful  piece of mechanism as it lives and breeds by  thousands in the depths of the sea Any handful of  seaweed out of a pool at low tide will contain some  so small as hardly to be noticed while from the  rocky depths of the Mediterranean the fishermen  bring up large ones in order to sell their bunches  of eggs for food Yet as they stand in the Italian  markets feebly moving their spines round and round  in search of some of the old familiar objects in their  sea home how few people stop to examine the  curious box or to think of the history of its dying  architect  And now what has been happening all this time  to the small wormlike creature No 5 which we left  hidden in the rocks You will have to search well  in the crevice of some dripping cavern only lately  deserted by the tide and there you may perchance  find him bathing himself in a rocky pool a large  soft satiny sausage purple white or brown with five  delicate stripes down his body see Frontispiece and  a wreath of beautiful purple tentacles like fine sea  weed waving round his mouth What connection can  this wormlike creature have with the rayed animals  Wait awhile and look more closely Sluggish  though he is the Seacucumber does care to move  sometimes if only to fill his body with sand and so  get the particles of living matter which form his sole  food As he begins to glide along see from the  five stripes running along his body there appear a  number of tiny tubes with suckers see Frontispiece  by which he draws himself along Here then are  again our five rays of tubefeet but this time not  forming a star or gathered into a ball but stretched  out along a soft fleshy tube  It would seem almost as if here life had neglected  to arm the poor soft Sea cucumber or tired of  inventing prickly defences had fallen back again  upon a soft jellyanimal But the creature is not so  helpless as he appears for in his thick transparent  skin are strong muscles by which he can draw his   In some of the seacucumbers the rows of feet are all drawn  together on the under side of the body and this is the case in the form  which the artist has represented on p 82  body in and out much as a worm does and some  species have sharp hooks buried in their flesh which  both help them in moving and in wounding those  who attack them But his great safeguard is his  power of contraction Try some day to find a sea  cucumber in a crevice on the seashore and then  set to work to get him out You will feel him slip  through your fingers like an eel as he squeezes the  water out of his body and forces himself into a nar  row crack from which he cannot be dislodged with  out breaking the rock There is a safety in pliability  which is sometimes surer than a stout resistance and  where the prickly seaurchin might fall a victim the  seacucumber effaces himself and escapes  A curious mixture he is of the savage and the  cultivated animal Though he gorges himself with  sand which seems after all but a coarse way of  getting a living yet his body is more delicately  formed than that of any other pricklyskinned ani  mal and this makes it all the more strange that he  should have the power of throwing out nearly the  whole of his inside and yet living and growing it  again Sir John Dalyell found that a seacucumber  which had lost its tentacles its throat its network of  bloodvessels its intestines and its eggsac and had  literally nothing left but an empty tube lived and in  three or four months had regrown all the inside of  its body An animal which can exist like this and  is scarcely ever found with all its parts complete  because it has parted with some of them and yet is  healthy and strong need surely not envy the brittle  star its stony case and wriggling arms nor the sea  urchin its strong box  And now we have followed our five little jelly  bodies out into life and have found that they have  as much a real history as you or I have with real  struggles and difficulties which they can only over  come by using all their powers The varieties of  these five forms are far too many for us even to  glance at them There are the fixed stonelilies of  the deep sea which do not become free like the  featherstar There are brittlestars from a tiny star  with a disc as small as a pins head and arms like  fine threads to others measuring a foot and a half  across There are starfish large and small some  like stars others like fivesided plates others with the  rays turned back like a folded dinnernapkin There  are seaurchins round eggshaped wheelshaped and  flattened and from the size of a pea to that of a childs  head while there are others from warm seas with  three edged spines as thick as a little finger and  twice as long A visit to any good museum will  show these varying forms and though the seacucum  bers will not be so well represented because they  are soft animals yet you will find the Trepangs of the  Chinese with their black leathery coats and others  which are covered with plates of lime The beauti  ful Synapta which lives in our English Channel with  its lovely rosecoloured tube and its anchorbearing  shields you will not so easily find for it is so brittle  that it is very difficult to preserve This lovely  creature often a foot and a half long shelters itself  by a tube of sand built in rings by its tentacles and  passed down over its body by the microscopic anchors  buried in its soft flesh and by these anchors it also  draws itself in and out showing a new expedient used  by an animal in which the tubefeet are wanting  These and many other wonderful adaptations are  open to all to study but we must not linger over  them here One marked step we have made in this  division we have advanced from mere floating or  fixed animals to creatures able to wander freely over  the floor of the ocean The children of life have  now got their feet upon the ground but not yet  their heads above water In fact they have as yet  no heads to put anywhere Eyes ears mouths and  feet we have met with but no heads nor have any  of these animals been able to live out of their watery  home  But soon a new prospect opens before us and in  the mollusca or softbodied animals and the worms  we shall begin to enter upon earthlife Not sud  denly however for all new powers are of slow growth  and through many chapters yet we shall find the  largest number of each group clinging to their old  ocean home and only here and there airbreathing  and headcrowned forms mingling in the throng  CHAPTER VI  THE MANTLECOVERED ANIMALS AND HOW THEY  LIVE WITH HEADS AND WITHOUT THEM  See what a lovely shell  Small and pure as a pearl  Lying close to my foot  Frail but a work divine  Made so fairily well  With delicate spire and whorl  How exquisitely minute  A miracle of design  The tiny cell is forlorn  Void of the little living will  That made it stir on the shore  Did he stand at the diamond door  Of his house in a rainbow frill  Did he push when he was uncurled  A golden foot or a fairy horn  Thro his dim water world  TENNYSON  F all our many playthings  when we were children were  there any we loved better or  cherished longer than the shells  which we brought home from the  seaside and each of which we knew  not perhaps by name but as a shep  herd knows his sheep so that no  single one could be missing without  our detecting it  They may have been only com  mon shells such as the small pink  tinted scallops variegated topshells  small cowries or spiral turrets with  here and there a delicate razorshell treasured espe  cially because so easily broken Yet we felt in  stinctively that they were more beautiful than any  artificial toys and though probably we scarcely  thought of the animal which formed them yet the  delicate marking and tints of colour which each had  left upon his house pleased our eye more than gaudy  pictures or painted playthings  And even amongst older people is there any place  in the world where shells are not admired The  savage strings them into necklaces and so does the  refined lady of fashion while there is probably not  a house even the poorest in England where they  do not figure as ornaments from the giant conchs  and cowries of the South Seas brought home by  some sailor son to the little boxes made of our  common coast shells  Now each one of these millions of shells pre  served in all parts of the world as well as of the  countless multitudes which lie crushed and broken  on the seashore and at the bottom of the sea has  once been the home of a living animal which was  born wrapped in a transparent mantle endowed with  the wonderful power of extracting lime from the sea  water which it has taken into its body tinting it with  beautiful colours and building it up into a solid  house  This wonderworking mantle which life has given  to these softbodied mollusca mollis soft may easily  be seen in any common shellinhabiting animal such  as the oyster or the periwinkle When an oyster is  BrackiopoJa are purposely omitted in this chapter because although  familiar objects yet their structure is too difficult and their true position  too uncertain for them to be dealt with in a book of this kind  opened you may see two transparent flaps with  thickened edges one lying above and the other  below the oyster in its shell in Fig 41 p 108  and these two flaps are the two halves of the mantle  which when they touch enclose the animal between  them In the periwinkle the mantle is equally visible  but this time it is all in one piece and forms a com  plete transparent tube out of which the animal pokes  its head and its crumpled foot bearing the horny lid  or opercuhun which closes the shell  When the periwinkle was very young he was not  larger than the head of a small pin and his shell was  like a minute transparent bead But as his body  grew larger it was necessary for his home to be both  larger and stronger Then he stretched out his  mantle till it reached over the edge of the tiny shell  and gave out from it a thin film in which were grains  of lime which had been passed through his body into  the mantle This film clinging to the inside of the  shell and stretching over its edge formed a fresh  internal layer and a new rim to the mouth The  rim however was not white but coloured by little  cells of dark paint or pigment secreted in the border  of the mantle The shell was now a little larger and  a little thicker and the mantle was drawn in till a  still more roomy house was needed and then the  same thing took place again and so the building  went on till the shell was completed the lines round  and round it marking the rims which had each in  their turn formed its mouth  In this way the mantle not only of the periwinkle  but of all the mollusca builds up the shell for the  animal to live in In the oyster each half of the  mantle lays down its own separate valve and this is  the case with all those mollusca which have no  heads they all grow bivalve or twovalved shells  while those which have heads such as periwinkles  snails and whelks have their mantle all in one piece  and consequently grow single or univalve shells  Nor is this all for the shape colour and pecu  liarities of all the different shells come from pecu  liarities of the mantle If this is crumpled at the  edge or drawn out in hornlike folds then the shell  will have a crumpled form like the scallop or horns  like the murex while the sunlight falling upon the  mantle seems to help it in forming the bright pig  ment with which it paints its home so that shallow  water shells and those of the tropics are more brightly  coloured than those from the deep sea or from dull  climates Again in the inside of the shell if the  mantle leaves a smooth layer this will be white but  when the film is crumpled in very fine folds these  reflect the light in such a way as to give the beautiful  colours known as motherofpearl while if the mantle  be irritated at any point it will form in the oyster  or the mussel a little bead of lime afterwards to be  increased into a pearl  And now with this picture in your mind of the  mantle at work visit any good collection of shells  such as that at the British Museum and look at the  giant Strombs and Volutes of the Indian Ocean the  Pinnas from the Mediterranean half a yard long  with their erect curled scales the prickly Murex  with its delicate pinktinted lining and the gorgeous  purple Mussels Notice the rainbowcoloured cham  bers of the Nautilus the pearly lining of the Haliotis  and the lustrous transparent shell of the floating  Carinaria and then say whether the work done by  the mantle of the softbodied animals does not surpass  that of any sculptor or artist in the world  Yet this is not the chief object of the shell which  is meant to shield the delicate creature within and  does it so successfully that though the soft bodies  of the mollusca offer the most tempting morsels to  birds and insects on the land and to almost all the  inhabitants of the sea yet protected by their shelly  covering they spread into every nook and corner of  the globe giving birth to such multitudes of young  that in spite of all the havoc which thins their ranks  they flourish in abundance Even the   Poor patient oyster where it sleeps  Within its pearly house  although it is the most helpless of all the headless  mollusca would overspread all the deepsea banks  round our coast if we would let it alone The oyster  fishers have only to visit their wellknown haunts  about halfamile or a mile from the shore in Essex  Kent Wales and elsewhere to rake them up by  hundreds If you could dive down there to the bottom  of the sea you would find the oysters cemented firmly  to the rocks and to each other by the under part of  the largest valve which is cup like in the centre  where the body lies while the flatter valve is gaping  open and a stream of water is gently flowing over  the oyster within  The shells stand naturally open because they have  an elastic cushion c something like a thick piece of  guttapercha fixed within the hinge which acts like  a spring of a jackinthebox and drives the covering  valve up unless it is forcibly pulled down This  however can be done by  a strong muscle ms  which lies within the  valves and has one end  fastened to the upper and  the other to the lower  valve so that by con  tracting this muscle the  oyster can pull its shell  together with a snap  when danger is near  Close round this muscle  lies the body of the ani  mal between the two  flaps of the mantle m m   b O J y anc j growing to the  mantle a delicate transparent frill g of four striped  bands these are his gills or breathing apparatus   The fringes that circle its body  Which epicures think should be cleared  Are the animals lungs for tis odd he  Like a foreigner breathes through his beard  The stripes are tubes which run up and down  each fold and through them flows the sluggish  colourless blood of the oyster so that as the gills lie  bathed in water the blood takes in oxygen through  the delicate membrane and flows back to the body  purified and refreshed The remainder of the oyster  consists of its stomach digestive tube and dark  coloured liver Iv an ovary where the oyster eggs are  formed and a heart i with two chambers which  pumps the blood through the channels of the body  while fine nerves spread in all directions not yet  arranged in pairs along a cord as we shall find them  afterwards in insects but straggling to the various  parts from two chief centres  But where is the mouth Placing the oyster with  its deep shell downwards and the rounded part to  wards you you will find an opening o in the right  hand corner near the hinge and over it four thin lips  lp If you could watch the oyster alive you would  see that all the water passing over the gills flows  towards this mouth and the reason is made clear if  you put a small piece of a gill in water under the  microscope for then you will see a whole forest of  lashes waving over the surface of the gills like reeds  in a stream and striking strongly in one direction  namely towards where the mouth would be By  means of the action of these lashes or cilia the oyster  as he lies gaping in the water has a constant current  flowing over him which not only provides him with  breath but drives the helpless microscopic plants  and animals past his thin lips to be drawn in and  swallowed  But though the oyster has little trouble in obtain  ing his food he has much in preserving himself from  danger When he first comes out of the egg he re  mains for some time lying safely between the gills of  his parent but by and by he is cast out to make  room for others for one oyster may lay as many as  two million eggs in a year and swims away by means  of a number of lashes which extend beyond his thin  transparent shell Woe betide him then if he comes  near to a hungry fish or crab or seaanemone for  millions of young oysters are swallowed by these  animals yet he is not quite without help for at this  time he has two little red eyespots and can see his  danger whereas he loses these after he is fixed to  the rock Still even then his nerves seem sensitive  to light for his valves are said to close at once when  a boat passes over him in clear water and his sense  of touch is very acute all round his mantle and as  he builds his shell firm and strong he can show fight  against many intruders and live sometimes for ten  twelve or fifteen years  But it is amid many perils for the starfish can  apply his greedy mouth to the valves and stifle him  in his grasp and annelids or seaworms can work  their way into his shell while the whelk with his  rasping tongue bores right through it and feeds on  his tender flesh and if he escapes all these the  boring sponges destroy hundreds of his race by  riddling the shells with holes and growing upon the  graves of their victims Even his own children often  cause his death by settling down upon his upper  valve so that when a bank becomes densely popu  lated those underneath are stifled in a living grave  From the oyster which lives on banks at many  fathoms depth we will pass on to the mussel anchored  nearer to the shore on the mudbanks and groynes  which are uncovered at low water Here the waves  THE MANTLECOVERED ANIMALS  in  beat roughly and to be safe it is necessary to with  stand them But the mussels M Fig 42 do not  like oysters cement themselves down for life They  have a different stratagem which enables them to get  free if they wish They have below their body a  muscular flap which goes by the name of a foot  and is made up of layers of muscle crossing and  recrossing each other In this foot there is a deep  groove out of which they force a milky fluid which  hardens into threads f and anchors them to the  rock Any one who has tried to wrench mussels  from their bed knows how strongly these threads  hold and if you remove the mussels carefully and  put them in an aquarium you may see them anchor  themselves As soon as they grow a little accus  tomed to the place they will begin feeling about with  their foot to find a spot and then pressing the tip  firmly against it will draw it back after a time  leaving a thread behind The huge fanmussel or  Pinna common off Plymouth forms threads so silky  that they have actually been woven into gloves  The mussel then has the power of spinning new  threads and settling in new spots but he is prac  tically a stationary animal providing himself with  plenty of food by the rapid motion of his fringed  gills so that even young shrimps in spite of all their  efforts are carried into the whirlpool Then when  the tide goes down he closes his shell shutting in  enough water to last till the sea returns and it is  while he is left high and dry that the seabirds often  wrench him from the rocks and devour him  In the scallop S Fig 42 we get a step farther  for though he too forms a slight cable and anchors  himself to the rock yet he can in most cases with  draw it at will and dart through the water in long  rapid leaps so that a group of young scallops look  as if they were performing a dance Mr Gosse who  watched this in an aquarium saw the scallop draw as  much water as it could hold within its mantle and  then closing the edge squirt it out at one corner so  as to drive itself along in the opposite direction The  lima which is nearly related to the scallop and has a  lovely orange fringe to its mantle often builds a nest  with its threads working in pieces of coral gravel  and shells and fastens it to the seaweed lining it  with a smooth layer of slime and taking refuge in it  out of the way of crabs and fishes But the scallop  goes boldly out into the sea and you will not wonder  at its activity when you see its beautiful jewelled eyes  e set all round the rim of its mantle like precious  stones set in a ring You may easily see these eyes  peeping out at you through the halfopened shell in  any fishmongers shop and a pretty sight it is  The life of the cockle C Fig 42 is very different  True he can leap to a great distance by bending his  long foot and straightening it with a jerk but  he uses it chiefly to burrow in the soft sand and then  he draws his body down till only the tip of his shell is  uncovered and there he takes in water and food  Some cockles have the two flaps of their mantles  joined together and drawn out on the side opposite  the foot into two short tubes si Fig 42 down one  of which the water enters while it is thrown out at  the other  Lastly the razor fish whose shells we find so  often but whose bodies we rarely see scarcely ever  come above ground at all but burrow with their thick  foot till only the two siphons si are uncovered and  throw up jets of water by which the fishermen find  them when they dig them up for bait  We have bivalves then lying fixed in the deep  water anchored on the stormy shore and buried in  the sand nay more if we search at low tide we may  often find the rocks riddled with holes and on break  ing them open see within a Pholas an animal like the  razorfish but much shorter and with a beautiful deli  cate shell The Pholas has learnt to find a home in the  solid rock while the groynes of our shores and the  bottoms of our ships are destroyed by another true  bivalve the Teredo which is miscalled a shipworm  Then we can trace these headless mollusca from  their oceanhome gradually up into the fresh water  some forms living in the brackish water at the rivers  mouth others like the freshwater mussel buried in  the mud of rivers and these do not spin threads  since they have no rude waves to meet but put out  two short siphons to the pure water above All  kinds of different forms with their habits we may  study on the coasts and in the ponds and rivers  but we never find a bivalve either on the land or  sailing in the open ocean  Molluscs with heads Vegetablefeeders  L Limpet walking and attached P Periwinkle t walking and  closed Foot o operculum s snout g place where gills lie  under the shell  These regions they are obliged to leave to the  more highlygifted mollusca with heads and when  we have examined the little periwinkle grazing on  the seaweed among the rocks we shall I think be  able to imagine how it was possible for some of his  THE MANTLE COVERED ANIMALS  distant relations to venture into new hunting grounds  and become land animals  Watch a periwinkle some day in his home among  the rocks and see him gently lift his shell open his  horny door p Fig 43 and put out his head He has  two delicate tentacles to  feel with and just behind  these on very short stalks  are set two tiny but keen  eyes the nerves of which  join the great nervous  mass now for the first time  chiefly centred in a head  The under part of his  body is a flat crumpled  disk or foot as it is called  composed of muscles and  this when lengthened out  first on one side and then  on the other draws him  gently along the under  side being moistened from  time to time by slime  from a gland within On Th e ins d eofaPeriwinkle  account of this foot Foot OT musc le for drawing  being under the body back into the shell g spittle glands  the periwinkle and his

44 enable him to shorten or lengthen his  body at will If undisturbed however he finds his  way to a mass of seaweed pushes out his snout  s Fig 43 and moves very slowly along scraping  fine shavings off the weed as he goes so as to leave  minute dents behind him  This he does by means of a very curious instru  ment If you could look into his mouth which  opens on the under side of his head you would find  it paved with sharp teeth just as if a number of  nails had been driven into it point upwards and it is  with these that he rasps the seaweed as he rubs his  jaw along it  But this rough file wears away rapidly with con  stant use and to meet this difficulty he has a com  plete provision hidden within The rasp within his  mouth is only the end of 600 rows of teeth three in  a row growing on a long gristly strap like pins stuck  in a pincushion and this strap often two and a half  inches long closes its edges together at the back of  the mouth so as to wrap over the rough points  and is then rolled up into a coil and stowed away  in a fold of the neck r Fig 44 As the front  teeth wear away this strap comes gradually for  wards on the floor of the mouth the new teeth  grow up and are sharpened ready for use This  curious strap is generally called the tongue  though a rasp radula is a much more appro  priate name  And now as our periwinkle walks and feeds he  must also breathe and strange as it may seem to  us no creature below the backboned animals ever  breathes through its mouth Look back to the  earlier groups and you will see that the sponges  jellyfish and corals breathe through the skin while  the starfish takes in water not through his mouth  but through the perforated plate in his back the  oyster breathes by means of gills fringing his body  and we shall find by and by that insects breathe  through holes in their sides We must look then  for the gills of the periwinkle and we find them  safely lodged in a fold of his mantle over his neck  just within the broad part of his shell br Fig 44  There they are bathed in water drawn in by their  waving lashes and when the periwinkle is left high  and dry by the tide he pullsto his lid shutting in a  supply of water  The same is true of the limpet not that he has  any door to close but he clings so closely to the rock  that water is shut in all round his gills which fringe  his body just above the foot You would hardly  imagine at first that a limpet has a head like a  periwinkle but when he is covered by the water and  not afraid that the birds will peck at his tender foot  and carry him off for food you may see him lift his  shell and put out his head with its horns and make  a track off to the nearest seaweed where he grazes  steadily But when the tide goes down you will  find him back again in exactly the old spot where  he has worn a little basin for himself to lie in to  which he fits so closely that sometimes his shell will  have even grown a little deeper on one side than on  the other to fit some dent in his nook  These are the peaceful vegetablefeeders and the  margins of their shells when unbroken have always  unnotched rims but if you pick up a shell which  has a notch n Fig 45 in the margin as in a cowry  or whelk shell you may be almost certain that its  owner fed on other animals for fleshfeeders have  their mantle folded right round their gills and drawn  out into a tube or siphon through which the water  is taken in and the notch in the shell marks the place  where the siphon protrudes  Now these flesh feeders have to work much  harder for their living than the grazing limpet or  periwinkle Though they sometimes devour fish  and other soft animals yet their chief food is shell  fish and they have to reach them through their  closed houses The hungry whelk therefore has to  bore a hole through a solid shell before he can take  his meal and for this he is provided with a boring  instrument such as any engineer might envy His  snout which can be stretched out like the trunk of  an elephant contains a toothed rasp like the peri  winkles but much more formidable and this rasp is  moved up and down by powerful muscles so as to  act like a fine saw drilling a neat round hole even in  the hardest shell through which he can suck out the  soft body it contains It is curious that he does not  always know when he will find food within for he  will sometimes drill a hole not only in an empty  shell but even in a shelllike stone  While the periwinkle and his relations then are  grazing on the seaweed the whelks and cowries  and their tribe are finding means to attack the  oysters and cockles limpets and periwinkles and so  to establish a successful huntingground where there  would be no room for more vegetablefeeders and  you can scarcely pick up a handful of shells without  finding some pierced with the holes made by these  marauders They people the shores of the ocean all  over the world some carrying their eggs till they are  hatched some glueing them down in safe nooks others  such as the whelk laying them in a bunch of horny  bags E Fig 45 in each of which the young whelk  may be seen moving if you can pick them up fresh  from the sea And when the little ones are born  they are able to swim about as the young oyster  was and while myriads are borne away on the sea  and devoured by other animals the remainder settle  down and feed on the seabottom  This is the history of the seaforms and we have  now to glance at those on the land First we must  notice in passing the watersnails in the ponds and  rivers feeding on decayed leaves and travelling often  from place to place floating shell downwards on the  surface of the water or hanging from the waterplants  by slimy threads Some of these have and some have  not the horny door while some breathe by gills and  others are airbreathers Then we have not much  difficulty in recognising the landsnails as being very  like the periwinkle only breathing by air instead of  by water The way this is done is very simple If  you watch a snail when its head is out of its shell  you will see a little slit opening and shutting steadily  in the top of the neck and through this hole air is  passing into a closed chamber made by a fold of  the mantle The walls of this chamber are covered  with a network of bloodvessels through which the  blood flows taking oxygen this time from the air  instead of from water By this simple arrangement  the snail no longer confined to the sea and rivers is  able to spread over the fields and woods and gar  dens feeding on the delicate juicy leaves of plants  on mosses and fungi and all the rich vegetation of  the country But it has many dangers for birds and  hedgehogs and even insects prey upon it greedily  Therefore it feeds chiefly in the dusk of the evening  while it has sharp eyes e Fig 46 set upon long stalks  which can see on all sides when it is out of its shell  Now in order to retire safely into its shell it must  be able to draw in these eyes and also the two ten  tacles or feelers below and here we find a beautiful  machinery If you watch a snail drawing in its  horns you will see that the eye disappears down the  tube just as the tip of a glovefinger does when you  draw it down from inside the glove These horns  are in fact hollow tubes and a special muscle pulls  them in from the top downwards and when the eye  is wanted again it is only necessary for the muscles  round the tube to contract and so to squeeze the tip  gradually out  Most of the landsnails have lost the horny door  not having any need for it but in winter when they  sleep without food in the cracks of old walls under  the bark of trees and in other sheltered spots they  pour out a layer of slime which hardens and shuts  them into their shell till spring returns  Slugs C Fig 46 on the other hand bury them  selves in the ground for winter safety At first sight  you might imagine that a slug had no shell at all  but if you examine carefully you will find a small  shell s under its black skin just behind the neck  and the small breathing hole b at the side will show  you that this shell covers the breathing organs This  is in fact the only part of a slugs body which is  covered by the mantle and if you alarm him you  will see him draw his head in under it as though he  expected it to shield him from danger No doubt  the absence of a large shell enables the slug to creep  into many places where a snail cannot go and the  havoc worked by these creatures in our gardens  shows how rapidly and successfully they feed The  great gray slug has a supply of 2 8000 teeth so  that he can use them without scruple and if it  were not for the birds which devour both slugs and  snails at their work and some insects which destroy  their eggs the whole land would be eaten up by  them for they hide their eggs so cunningly in  the roots of plants in crevices and well sheltered  nooks that they multiply by millions  A Garden snail B B Testacellat one disappearing into the  ground and only the tail showing C The Great Gray SlugJ  s Shell tentacles t eyes b breathinghole  Yet even kept down as they are there is not vege  table food enough for all kinds and many feed on  other animals as for example the little testacella B  Fig 46 a queer little fellow which follows the worms  down into their holes and drags them down his  throat by his rasp of barbed teeth so that often  several worms may be found torn and mangled  within his body His breathing chamber has found  its way nearly to the end of his tail so that he can  breathe when the front of his body is buried while  the little shell s which covers it looks very comi  cal but is useful nevertheless in protecting it from  attack behind  All these many forms of watersnails and land  snails and slugs have taken possession of the land  and its waters and now if we go back to the sea we  find that the world has still room for other kinds  only they must fit into gaps that are not occupied  For wonderfully beautiful mantlecovered creatures  may be found there lurking under stones and in dark  corners if a careful search is made at low tide These  are commonly called seaslugs and by scientific  men the nakedgilled mollusca because they have  no shell or covering over their feather like gills   Fig 47 but carry them erect on their backs  like tufts of moss or delicate seaweed Yet in their  babyhood these naked animals lived in a tiny curled  shell and swam about by lashes like the young of all  the stomachfooted animals and we can still recognise  their nationality by their feathery gills and their  coiled rasping tongue Like the landslugs they can  creep through many a narrow opening not possible  for shelled animals and though their eyes are not  powerful they have very sharp ears a quick sense of  touch and sensitive nerves Especially their smell  is very acute probably in order to prevent them from  venturing into bad water where their delicate and  unprotected gills would be unable to work well  Though they are so fragile looking yet they eat  ravenously feeding on young corals sertularias and  sponges and often digging a good piece of flesh out  of a seaanemone with their scooplike rasp Some  of them are protected by spicules set in their flesh  but most of them are very tender and escape obser  vation by the wonderful resemblance of their colours  to those of the seaweed over which they wander and  whether floating or hanging by slimy threads or  crawling with their beautiful plumes outspread they  select chiefly the dark sheltered spots neglected by  the hardier children of Life  And now that the seashore the ponds and the  rivers are overrun with stomachfooted animals there  remains but the wide ocean And even there they  have made their way for sailors in the Atlantic Ocean  meet with the oceansnail lanthina with its float  of aircells floating in myriads over the sea and  feeding on the small jellyfish and with the lovely  I lanthina the oceansnail f Foot r raft of airbubbles with  eggbags hanging down C Carinaria Foot s shell covering the  breathinggills g

miles  with their swarms as they graze on the floating  seaweed  Life then has spread her mantlecovered children  far and wide over sea and land where each by  different devices finds food and shelter But it is not  with such tiny beings as these that we are to end  the history of the mantlecovered animals for lurking  in the holes and tidepools of the sea there are  much larger creatures with sac like bodies green  staring eyes horny beaks and waving arms which  unlike as they are to the ordinary shell animals are  nevertheless true mantlebearers  Who would imagine on seeing a cuttlefish with  its large pathetic eyes thrown up on the seashore or  an octopus shooting across its tank that these intelli  gent active creatures had any connection with the  helpless oyster or timid periwinkle Yet so it is  only while the oyster is one of the lower and feebler  forms the cuttlefish the octopus the argonaut and  the nautilus are the monarchs of the mollusca pro  vided with as powerful weapons for their work as  the dragonfly is among insects or the tiger among  beasts  Go some day and look at an octopus in one of the  aquariums Its baglike body appears to be a mere  mass of flesh yet it has really a most complicated  internal structure and a gristly framework more like  a true skeleton than any other animal without a back  bone Its mantle covers the body and forms a ring  round the neck often fitting so closely that its edge  can only be seen where there is a hole for taking in  water In a fold of this mantle are hidden the gills  and a short funnel si Fig 49 sticking out of its neck  is a tube for shooting out the refuse water which has  been taken in at the mantlerim Here we have the  secret of the rapid movements of the octopus for by  taking in a supply of water at the rim of his mantle  and sending it out in jets through the funnel he shoots  himself backwards just as a boat is sent through the  water by a stroke of the oar Nay more if he is  flying away from an enemy he has an additional  mode of defence for within his body is a gland which  secretes an inky fluid and this he squirts out through  the funnel making a thick dark cloud behind him  which baffles his pursuer at the same time that it  helps himself to dart away   Th endangered mollusk thus evades his fears  And native hoards of fluid safety wears  A pitchy ink peculiar glands supply  Whose shades the sharpest beam of light defy  Pursued he bids the sable fountain flow  And wrapt in clouds eludes the impending foe  Fishermen assert and Mr Darwin and others confirm  their opinion that the octopus and cuttlefish often  take deliberate aim at an enemy when they squirt out  this unpleasant fountain  But the chief and most powerful weapons of the  octopus are his socalled arms and his horny beak  Just below his large penetrating eyes is spread out a  crown of eight long tapering ribands a Fig 49 and  these are in fact his foot answering to that crumpled  muscular disk upon which the snail walks In the  octopus this foot has grown round the neck and then  divided up into segments and for this reason he and  the cuttlefish and nautilus are called headfooted ani  mals Cephalopoda The foot of the cuttles has ten  segments instead of eight and two are nearly three  times as long as the others  Now watch the octopus lurking in the rockwork of  the tank his round body squeezed into some nook  and his arms some grasping the rock others flapping  idly in the water If a large fish or crab pass by  instantly he is on the alert the arms in the water no  longer listless dart out and fasten on the luckless  animal which is dragged in to the strong beak stand  ing out in the centre of the arms and crunched in a  moment even the crabs shell cracking like a nut  while his flesh is devoured and carried down into the  stomach of the octopus by his fleshy tongue armed  with horny hooks But what gives the arms of the  octopus such power If you look at the under  surface of them you will find arranged in pairs along  each arm suckers s Fig 49 large near the mouth  and growing small as the strips taper to a point and  crowded so thickly that an ordinarysized octopus  with arms about a foot and a half long will have  nearly 2000 of them Each of these suckers is a  perfect little airpump with a piston in the middle  and the moment the octopus lays an arm upon any  creature a muscle draws the piston in each sucker  back This causes it to cling like a cuppingglass  and the more the victim struggles the tighter is the  grasp wnile the octopus holding by the suckers of  his other arms to the rock has a firmer and firmer  hold the stronger the resistance  One would almost imagine at first sight that long  experience would have taught the fishes and crabs to  keep out of the way of such a monster but the  octopus has another and almost unfair advantage  He carries in his transparent skin cells of colour  yellow blue red and brown and has the power like  the chameleon of changing colour and assuming the  tint of the rock under which he hides  New forms they take and wear a borrowed dress  Mock the true stone and colours well express  As the rock looks they take a different stain  Dappled with gray or blanch the livid vein  By this means he not only lies safely in wait to  pounce upon his prey but may himself escape the  notice of the dolphins or the conger eels which are  too strong for him to conquer and who in their turn  feed on his fleshy arms  With such advantages and weapons of attack can  we wonder that not only the octopus but also his  tenarmed relations the cuttles and the squids are  to be found of different sizes and kinds all over the  sea There is the little Sepiola often caught off our  coasts in the nets of the shrimpers whose body is  only about half an inch long with small flaps or fins  on the sides He like the cuttlefish so far clings to  the old habits of the mollusca as to form a long thin  shell on his back under his mantle and this shell we  call a pen when we find it on the shore because it  is shaped like one He makes himself a shelter by  blowing a hole in the sand with jets of water from  his funnel and uses the suckers of his arms to  remove and arrange the small stones Then he sits  in his hole with his large goggle eyes peering out  and catches the shrimps and smaller crabs as they  pass by There is the common cuttlefish which  forms in its mantle the white chalky shell known  as the cuttle bone It generally floats about or  creeps over the bottom of rocky pools till fright  ened or wishing to attack some animal it shoots  out suddenly a jet from its funnel and flies back  wards through the water clutching its prey on the  road The dark horny grape like bunches which  we find on the shore are the eggs of the cuttle  fish There are the Calamaries whose shell is a  horjiy pen and some of which living in the open  ocean have sharp hooks in the centre of their  suckers making cruel weapons of attack against  the unfortunate fish who have the sharp hooks  planted in their flesh and held fast by the cups  around them  Then there is our friend the Octopus with his body  squeezed between the rocks and nothing but his bright  gleaming eyes to betray him while his wife in another  sheltered nook is watching over her eggs e Fig 49  arranged in clusters on a stalk like a huge catkin  of a nuttree A loving mother she is sometimes  dandling the eggs in the hollow web of her arms or  cleaning them by spouting water from her funnel  over them as a gardener washes his plants with a  hose Week after week she will watch them for  though they do not need hatching yet if she did  not keep them clean they would be addled by living  things growing over them then as each little bag  bursts a tiny perfect octopus about the size of a flea  darts out uses his funnel at once and frolics to and  fro in the water his body blushing now with one  colour and now with another  In our seas an octopus scarcely ever has arms  more than two feet long and a body about the size  of an ordinary lemon but in the Mediterranean they  have been caught with arms four feet long and are  Yiuch dreaded by the bathers and in the British  Tuseum there is an arm of a Calamary nine feet  n length so that the creature which carried it and  which probably lived on the coasts of South America  must have been formidable indeed  But if there are ugly and dangerous headfooted  inimals there are among them two lovely forms  The Argonaut though she does not really sail on the  water with her two arms raised as sails as the poets  imagined yet forms such a lovely cradle for her eggs  which she carries with her that it makes her a thing  of beauty as she drives herself backwards through  the water The shellbearing Argonaut is the mother  for the father is like an ordinary octopus and has no  covering and indeed that which the mother carries  is not a true shell but a chalky nest built up by the  ends of two of her arms which are spread out into  broad webs and folded back over her body where  they lay down that beautiful delicate film of lime  the Argonaut shell Under this shell still keep  ing it covered with her arms she places her bunches  of eggs and stretching out the other six arms can fly  backwards through the water carrying her brood with  her or can like the cuttlefish float quietly or creep  along the bottom  But perhaps the most beautiful shell of all is that  of the Nautilus which it must be remembered is  totally different from the Argonaut shell being the  animals real home and not a mere nest The  Nautilus is different in many ways from the octopus  and the cuttle He has four breathing gills instead  of two his eyes are much less perfect than those of  the other headfooted animals he has no inkbag for  having a strong protecting shell he has less need for  it and he has no suckers on his feet He is the last  remnant of a once great family that of the huge  Ammonites and Nautiluses which we find buried in  the rocks of ages past and like many a remnant  of a once noble race living retired in their own  domain while younger and less sensitive branches  are fighting their way to eminence in the world the  nautilus creeps in the shallow waters of the Indian  Ocean or floats about when all is still but hides  himself persistently from view and has very rarely  been seen alive He builds his beautiful and refined  house chamber by chamber deserting one after  another as he grows too large for them and leaving  only a thin tube through the middle by which he is  supposed to fill the shell with air when he wishes  to float  Year after year beheld the silent toil  That spread his lustrous coil  Still as the spiral grew  He left the past years dwelling for the new  Stole with soft step its shining archway through  Built up its idle door  Stretched in his lastfound home and knew the old no more  He allows very few however to investigate his  habits wrapped in his proud reserve he lives his  solitary life and it is only after his death that his  beautiful shell with its pearly chambers is found and  brought to decorate our homes  And here we must take leave of the mantle  covered animals We have followed them though  very imperfectly from the poor patient oyster  through their gradual rise in power till we leave  them as dreaded conquerors in the sharp beaked  octopus and the terribly armed calamary We might  if we had ventured on the dangerous sea of conjecture  have started still earlier and linked their simpler forms  to those of the lower worms But till more is known  this course might have led us astray and it is safer  to content ourselves with marking how life has  gradually filled the ocean and the land with specially  fitted forms of mollusca having all a distinctive  nationality which separates them from the other  divisions of Lifes children so that the octopus the  cuttlefish and the nautilus stand as undoubtedly at  the head of one great plan of animal life as the ants  do at the head of the insects or man at the head of  the vertebrates We shall now have to hark back  again and in inquiring of the worm whence he  comes and how he lives start on a totally different  track which will lead both by land and water  through the forms of the shrimp and crab and  lobster to the aerial and fairy like insects which  form so large a portion of the life upon our globe  CHAPTER VII  THE OUTCASTS OF ANIMAL LIFE AND THE  ELASTICRINGED ANIMALS BY SEA AND BY LAND   And ever at the loom of Birth  The Mighty Mother weaves and sings  She weaves fresh robes for mangled earth  She sings fresh hopes for desperate things  KlNGSLEY  E have now traced the history of  four out of the seven divisions  of animal life and have seen how  each by taking a different road  has managed to get a footing for its  members in various nooks and spaces  in the world We must next try to  gain some idea of that small fifth  division containing the Worms in  which is shadowed forth as it were  that ringed structure which we shall  find so remarkable in the sixth and  largest division which follows But  before arriving at the true ringed  worms we must pause for a moment  to glance at that curious wandering and outcast  population of our globe which finding no shelter in  the earth or sea or air have taken up their abode  within their fellowcreatures and live upon them  Although we have as yet studied only the lowest  and by no means the most numerous of Lifes  children yet we begin to see that our earth is full  very full of life and that the creatures in it are  jostling each other and driving into dark and  dismal corners those which cannot get a living in  the open sunshine Millions serve as food for  others and millions die a speedy death from want  of space and food but we cannot expect that any  will give up their lives while they can find a means  of struggling on What way is there beyond those  which we have found already  There is still the novel device of a creature find  ing shelter by making another living being carry it  and of obtaining food by making another living  being nourish it And so we find that among the  low forms of many classes of animals there are  always some which prey upon their neighbours just  as in our great cities there are always some of the  most degraded and miserable our street Arabs and  our thieves who live on refuse and plunder  And this is true to such a large extent in the  animal world that there is probably scarcely a single  creature that does not carry many other creatures  upon or within its body  Some of these merely come to it for shelter as  for example the tiny peacrab which is constantly  found living in the shell of the horsemussel catching  its own food and being probably rather helpful than  otherwise to the mussel by leaving him the scraps  of his meal Others such as ticks and watermites  fix themselves on the bodies the one of sheep and  dogs the other of waterbeetles and sucking the  blood of their hosts find both food and shelter  And others finding no place for them at all in the  outer world burrow into the very body of their  victim and feed upon the soft parts within  Among these last the greater number are a low  race of softbodied worms whose ancestors when the  other forms of life the star fish mollusca ringed  animals and insects found new ways of gaining  their livelihood remained behind groping in the  mud and sand of rivers and seas and flapping about  by the broad margins of their flat bodies Some of  the descendants of these softbodied worms still  manage to live a free and independent life One  set called the wheelworms because of the curious  whirling appearance of their lashes as they swim  about may be seen under the microscope in almost  any stagnant water Another group with tiny red  eye specks and a trumpet shaped mouth in the  middle of their bodies live on the seashore or in  ditches and may be found as little jellylumps upon  watercresses before they have been washed An  other set known as the ribbonworms with elastic  bodies which stretch sometimes to an enormous  length are armed with a tiny dagger in the head  with which they pierce the soft bodies of animals  and suck out their juices One of these called the  longworm which looks like a dark strip of india  rubber as it lies coiled up under stones on the shore  has been known to be as much as twenty feet long  though only as broad as the blade of a penknife  These are the more fortunate of the softworms  which have found a place in the outside world but  there are others which unable to get a living in  the mud and sand were forced to work their way  into the bodies of snails caterpillars or grubs and  now make them their natural home Unpleasant  as it may be to think of these parasites yet when  we look at the question from their point of view  they are after all only doing their best to get  a living and they have many curious weapons to  help them in doing it nor do they always injure the  animal upon which they live unless they are in great  numbers  Thus for example one of the flukes a minute  flat worm shaped like a tiny flounder has a most  strange succession of changes in its life Firstly  The mother lives within the intestines of some  waterbird holding on firmly to her host by two  rows of tiny hooks round her head while her mouth  is firmly applied like a sucker secondly the eggs  are thrown out and fall into the water or moist mud  and out of them comes thirdly the embryo or  imperfect animal surrounded with lashes but it  does not long remain free for out of it again comes  a fourth form a small baglike animal which at once  seeks out a watersnail Paludind and clings to it  Nor are the transformations yet ended Within this  hanging sac which is called the nurse of the fluke  there appear fifthly a number of little tailed ani  mals like tadpoles and by and by the nurse bursts  and all these little creatures come swimming out  once more free in the water But the snail is not  rid of them either upon her or upon some other  snail like her a number of these little creatures fix  themselves and each one boring into her foot drops  off its tail and forming a transparent bag round its  body begins to grow a crown of hooklets In this  state it remains till the snail gobbled up by some  waterbird passes into its stomach and there the  gastric juice digesting the snail dissolves the bag  and at last the fluke becomes a perfect animal again  fixing itself by hooks and suckers in the same kind  of home from which its mother came  And now consider what a number of chances  occur to this animal during its short life any of which  may destroy it Their eggs are not placed in a fit  spot by a careful mother but fall wherever the bird  may chance to drop them and twice in their lives  they have to find a snail in which alone they can live  and grow Many fail and clinging to stones or  weeds die for want of their home And even if they  succeed in these first attempts the last step of all is  entirely out of their control for unless they are car  ried down the throat of the waterbird they can  never grow and lay eggs But they exist in such  myriads that this is of no consequence to the race  You can scarcely cut open any snail without finding  some of these curious creatures within it different  species living in different snails and in most cases  the worm must pass into another animal to become  complete The liverfluke of the sheep for example  which causes the rot when too abundant lives its  early life in a snail which is licked up by the sheep  as they eat the damp grass  The bladderworm however which gets into the  brain of the sheep and causes it to hang its head  belongs to another and perhaps more dangerous  tribe These are the socalled tapeworms which  can only grow to their full strength in warmblooded  animals and are armed with both hooks and suckers  on the head Now while the front part of this head  is firmly fixed buds are given off continually from  the other end making a long tail with many joints  each of which carries eggs and often has its own  separate suckers and hooks to hold firmly to its host  These creatures have no mouths or stomachs but  take in the fluid food all over their body as it passes  by them on its way through the animal they inhabit  Tapeworms wander just as flukes do thus the tape  worm of the dog begins its life in the sheep that of  the cat lives first in the mouse that of the fox in the  hare or rabbit that of the waterbird in the fish  Nor is it only flat worms which have become  parasites the little wriggling round worms live many  of them in the grubs of beetles and insects and from  these pass on into the bodies of rats and mice  squirrels and birds or fishes The little threadworm  MermiSy for example as soon as it is hatched in the  moist earth in spring time uses a sharp dagger  hidden in its head to pierce a road for itself into the  body of a grub and lives upon its juices till either  the caterpillar becomes a butterfly or is eaten or  the mermis is ready to lay her eggs and then she  pierces her way out again to lay her young in the  soft earth  Another little round worm hangs on by its suckers  inside the throat of the chicken givingit the gapes  which can be cured if the worm is brushed out with  a feather while the Trichina so dangerous in half  raw pork or ham is another round worm living in  the muscles of the pig All these and hundreds  of forms like them belong to that wandering band  of outcasts which have been driven from the face of  the earth to feed upon the strength of others They  are not a pleasant band but they teach us most  surely the truth that the children of Life are sown  broadcast over the earth to make the utmost use of  it that can be made We have even examples where  a parasite upon some animal has another parasite  within it as when by cutting open a snail worms  are found within and these worms when cut open  are found to be the home of some tiny infusorian or  slime animal so that even within the body of one  animal we have a little world of life  Another truth it teaches us which we have noticed  before namely that where a creature has little use for  its powers these diminish and it becomes degraded  and feeble for the parasitic worms with their low  structure their want of eyes and ears and often of  mouths and stomachs are most of them poor miser  able creatures at best Yet still we find even here  that each must do some work The most shiftless  of worms passed on passively from one animal to  another must find its way to the liver or the muscle  or the intestine which is its natural home and in  the hooks and suckers and daggers so admirably  fitted for opening a path and clinging firmly when  the right spot is found we see a proof that even  these poor debased parasites have acquired some  weapons in the struggle for life  But we must not stop here in our history of the  worm tribe for these parasites have distant relations  of a far higher structure who have managed to gain  a much better position in the world In each of our  groups of animal life we have found some special  advantage which has enabled them to spread their  children over the world the sponges had their  cooperative life and their protecting skeletons the  lassothrowers their poisonous weapons the prickly  skinned animals their tube feet and stony casing the  mollusca their wonderworking mantle but among  them all we have not yet met with that power of  moving quickly without which no creature is ever  very intelligent It is true that the octopus can  shoot rapidly through the water and is at the same  time the most intelligent animal we have yet learned  to know but its quick movements are all in the  water when it scrambles along the shore it is slow  and awkward while the other crawlers the sluggish  snail or the creeping starfish are not any more rapid  And yet it is clear that the power of getting quickly  over the ground must be an advantage in the struggle  for life and we shall see that it is this power and  the intelligence accompanying it which has raised  the most advanced animals in the sixth division to  such a high position as that of the bee and the ant  Nothing however is learnt in a moment and  therefore you must not be surprised that the worm  and the leech which you would probably consider  rather slow animals are the first examples of the  more active creatures Nevertheless if you could  start either of these animals on a fair race with a  snail though they might not appear to hurry yet  you would find they would beat him hollow The  accompanying picture is one given by Sir Emerson  Tennent of the landleeches as he saw them in the  low ranges of the hill country of Ceylon He tells us  that these little leeches about an inch long fixing  themselves by their tail suckers raise their heads in  the grass to watch for passers by and as soon as  they see man or beast they start off Now stretched  out at full length now drawing up the hind sucker  so as to form a loop then forward again they ad  vance at an astonishing pace till they reach their  LandLeeches of Ceylon racing to attack some creature  victim when they cling to ankle or leg or even if  these are protected are soon up at the neck where  they hang in groups like bunches of grapes as their  skins swell out with their meal  Now if we wish to learn the secret of the leech  and how he can move so fast we must look for it in two  things I st in the muscles by means of which he moves  his ringed body and 2dly in the chain of nerves  which give the order for the muscles to move He  has three layers of muscle in his skin in the first  nearest the outside the fibres run round and round  the body in rings in the second they cross each  other making a diamond shaped lattice work like a  netted purse in the third they run along the body  from head to foot When the  leech wishes to lengthen his body  he contracts the round rings and  so forces the long cords to stretch  making himself long and thin  when he wishes to shorten his  body he contracts the long cords  and forces out the rings making  himself short and stout while the  crisscross muscles help to modify  these movements  So much for the muscles and  now for the telegraph which go  verns them If you were to lay a  dead leech on its back and open it  you would see running from end  to end of its body a white cord c  with little swellings of white mat  ter g at intervals upon it and  from these swellings very fine  white threads n are seen branch  After MoqvinTandon ing out into the body The Cord  Section of a Leech to j r i j v  show the nervecord c ls made of nervethreads clinging  with the ganglia or knots closely together and is so to  TL s P eak the line of tekgaph  off from them j walls swellings are masses of nervous  of segments of the body matte r called ganglia and are the  A pockets of slime  telegraphic stations the white  threads are simple nerves carrying messages to the  muscles while round the neck of the leech is a collar  of nerves with two large ganglia the head telegraph  offices Now it is this system of nerves which enables  the leech to give orders to its muscles so rapidly  and throughout all the ringed animals this same  system is found growing more and more perfect up  to the ants  When the leech is alive and uninjured all the  telegraphic stations work together and you will notice  that in the middle of the body which is divided into  segments s each has its own station or ganglion  and though all these usually work together yet each  segment is so active that if the cord is cut in half in  the middle the stations in the tail end of the leech  will work on their own account and the two halves  will often try to pull different ways We see then  that we have here a very powerful machine and when  we remember that the leech has eight or ten simple  eyes set in its back near the head and two strong  suckers to cling with within one of which is a mouth  armed with three sawlike jaws which can easily pierce  the skin of its victim already made tight by the  sucker we can understand that he is well fitted for the  battle of life He is essentially an aquaticbreathing  animal and though he can live for some time out  of the water he can only do so in very damp air  and his body is always covered with slime which  oozes out from some little round pockets in the  sides of his body  So the leeches live in ponds and ditches and  marshes and some even on damp land and the eggs  out of which the young leeches come are laid in co  coons of gummy slime placed in the holes and clay of  the banks Fish snails limpets and grubs are their  usual food though they by no means despise warm  blooded animals when they get a chance to fasten  upon them  The elasticringed animals are not however con  fined to fresh water on the contrary though they  cannot breathe in perfectly dry air yet they have  found their way underground in the common earth  worm and there are many of them in the sea from  which probably they first came and where they are  protected and armed in many very curious ways  The common earthworm which we all know so  well is a curious example of a wateranimal adapted  to live under the earth He breathes as the leech  does and he must have moisture for perfectly dry air  is useless to him and he dies quickly in very dry  places where he cannot keep his body moistened  with slime Eyes would be of no use in his under  ground journeys and he only comes above ground  at night so we find that these organs are wanting  suckers too would be a hindrance to him and his  body ends in a fine tapering point which he can push  into the earth like a shoemakers awl  But how is he to force his way through the earth  If you pass your hand along his body from the tail  to the head you will feel a gentle resistance for  every ring bears four pair of hooked bristles pointing  backwards so fine as not to be easily seen but strong  enough for his work When he has pushed the front  part of his body a little way into the earth he then  draws it up by shortening the long muscles and the  bristles make no resistance because they point towards  the tail then he contracts his ring muscles and so  forces his body to lengthen again but this time it  cannot lengthen backwards because the bristles being  rubbed the wrong way will not yield but stick into  the earth so that the whole movement is forwards  and he makes his way  He often assists himself too in another way by  eating the earth through which he passes he has  no hard jaws like the leech but a long upper lip with  which he shovels the earth into himself sending it  out afterwards at his tail and making those curious  coils of earth which we find on lawns and garden  paths His usual food is the animal and vegetable  matter in the earth which he absorbs out of it as it  passes through his body though it is possible he may  also sometimes eat the leaves which he is so fond of  dragging with him underground leaving the stalks  sticking out above The young earthworms are  hatched underground in cocoons made of earthy mat  ter and slime and as they have no eyes or tentacles  or other tender organs they become at once fearless  miners Yet they often fall victims at all ages to  the hedgehog and the mole and even to their rela  tions the leeches if they venture near the water while  birds are their mortal enemies Even if a bird can  not succeed in catching a whole worm yet he will  often nip off his tail as he is disappearing into the  earth in the early morning after his nightly rambles  As however the worm can grow the tail again with  out any difficulty the loss is perhaps not of much  consequence and from his living underground he  is certainly exposed to fewer dangers than our next  examples the seaworms which are obliged to protect  themselves in many ingenious ways  Very few people as a rule are acquainted with  the seaworms in their homes but every one who has  handled oysters or scallops must have noticed the  curious round tubes often firmly clinging to their  shells These tubes were once the home of a sea  worm which has built them of chalk and slime The  worm itself is quite loose within the tube and stretches  its body out scrambling up the sides by the help of  its bristles and of a number of little comblike plates  which grow upon its rings If you can get a shell  covered with these tubes from the sea at low tide and  put it in salt water you will see a beautiful sight  After a time a small scarlet stopper Fig 53 will  creep up and out of the tube and as it rises on a  long stem there will follow it a splendid scarlet plume   arranged like a double fan and waving in the  water The stopper with its stem is one of the  tentacles of the worm enlarged at its end so as to  shut the animal safely within the tube while the  other tentacles have become the beautiful plume  which is the breathing apparatus of the animal It is  easy to understand that being in a tube the Serpula  as this worm is called cannot breathe through its  skin like the leech or worm and it needs these deli  cate gills to provide air for its body while at the  same time its sensitive nerves and apparatus of  muscles enable it to draw them in like lightning when  danger is near  There is an almost endless variety of these tube  building worms You can scarcely pick up a piece  of dark seaweed without finding upon it what look  like very tiny shells Sp Fig 5 3 but which are really  coiled wormtubes Again you cannot search long  among the sandy pools at low tide without finding  some long tubes made of sand and broken pieces  of shell wedged between the stones and rocks and  having forked sandy threads at their end These  tubes are the house of the Terebella or shellbinding  worm which selects particles of shell and sand with  its tentacles and places them round its soft body  cementing them together as a mason cements the  stones of a wall till it forms a tube often a foot long  so firmly wedged into the beach that it is almost  impossible to get one out perfect while you will  rarely find the worm itself as it draws back to the  farthest end of the tube directly it is alarmed  These are the fixed scaworms but there are  others as active as any animal in the sea and the  first step towards these is the common higworm which  fishermen use for bait This worm which makes the  round coils of sand we meet with on the coast moves  freely about but is not very active for it has no eyes  and lives much underground glueing together the sand  as it passes along and forming a tunnel for itself  through which it can pass Its gills are no longer round  its head as among the fixed worms but it carries them  on its back as thirteen pairs of lovely scarlet tufts  And now we come to the wonderful defensive  weapons which life has bestowed upon these wander  ing worms The lugworm safely hidden in its tunnel  does not need any but the lovely Nereis N Fig  54 which has a well developed head with eyes  tentacles and sharp jaws leads a much more active  and precarious life It hides under stones and shells  or moves about rapidly in the water and can use  its bristles not only as oars to swim with but also as  swords sabres and hooks For these fine bristles  are not simple hairs as they appear but have sawlike  edges and hooked tips and are really formidable  weapons both of attack and defence although the  smaller specimens of the creature which you find on  the shore often look like mere threads unless seen  under a magnifying glass  But if the Nereis is beautiful and terrible how  much more so is the marvellous seamouse A Fig  54 which we sometimes see thrown up on the shore  while small ones may be found by turning up stones  on the sand No one would believe at first sight  that this creature is a worm covered as it is with  broad scales and bristling with tufts of hair Yet if  you lift the scales and brush aside a thick coating of  felt which covers the body or if you look underneath  the creature as it crawls along you will be able to dis  tinguish the rings and also to see that the tufts of hair  spring each from a separate ring like the hairs of the  earthworm The broad scales are a curious breathing  arrangement peculiar to the seamouse for when they  are lifted the thick coating of felt is filled with water  which in this way flows all over the outside of the  body and when they are shut they force it out again  making room for a fresh supply of water to pour in  when they rise In this way the whole body of the  animal is bathed in water out of which the oxygen  can be taken through the delicate skin  But it is above all the tufts of hair which are so  beautiful and wonderful beautiful because each  bristle being marked with the finest possible  scratches reflects light of all the colours of the rain  bow crimson scarlet orange yellow green blue  and lilac according to the angle at which the light  falls upon it so that the creature looks as if it carried  a forest of prisms upon its back Wonderful because  each of these hairs is a sharp lance by which the  worm can protect itself from attack In one of the  seamice the Aphrodite hispida these bristles are per  fect harpoons with barbed points at their tip and  delicate teeth all along the edges and they can be  thrust out when the animal wishes to defend itself  But how then can the worm avoid cutting itself  with these sharp instruments To prevent this each  barbed spine has a smooth horny sheath which closes  upon it as it is drawn in and prevents it from tearing  the tender flesh Such a creature as this deserves  indeed to be called the king of worms being at the  same time so beautiful and so formidably armed  He lives in deep water and is only to be found  when thrown on shore where he is very helpless  though in his own element he is a dangerous neigh  bour as he feeds greedily upon all living animals  not sparing even his own brothers when they are  weaker than himself He is a timid creature hiding  under stones and in dark corners and shunning the  light of day which gives him all his beauty yet in  bidding adieu to the wormtribe we must acknow  ledge that none of them can compare either in deli  cacy of structure or in their weapons of attack and  defence with the little seamouse or as he is often  called the porcupine of the ocean  CHAPTER VIII  THE MAILED WARRIORS OF THE SEA WITH RINGED  BODIES AND JOINTED FEET   Strong suits of armour round their bodies close  Which like thick anvils blunt the force of blows  In wheeling marches formd oblique they go  With harpy claws their limbs are armed below  Fell shears the passage to their mouth command  From out their flesh their bones by nature stand  Broad spread their backs their shining shoulders rise  Unnumberd joints distort their lengthened thighs  With stony gloves their hands are firmly cased  Their round black eyeballs in their bosom placed  On eight long feet the wondrous warriors tread  And either end alike appears a head  These mortal wits to name as Crabs agree  The gods have other names for things than we  BATTLE OF THE FROGS AND MlCE  W  AVING now arrived at the sixth  and largest division of the whole  animal kingdom we are going to  leave behind us those low and  scattered tribes which live as it  were in a dreamy unconscious  way tossed hither and hither by  outward circumstances and having  but feeble nerves to guide them  and for the future shall have to do  with beings gradually struggling  into active intelligent life  No one can watch the beautiful  transparent prawn with his bright  eyes gleaming and his antennae  trembling in the water without feeling that we have  here a creature much more alive to everything around  him than the groping starfish or the creeping worm  while the active little crab as he peers out from the  seaweed and scrambles across the shallow pools or  buries himself in an instant in the wet sand shows  a lightness and agility which we look for in vain in  the sluggish snail or the slowly grazing limpet  And when we learn that the prawn and the crab in  the sea are formed on the same plan as the centipedes  spiders and insects of the land we see that we are  on the road to even more intelligent and more active  creatures such as the busy bee and the thrifty ant  But how can this be that the heavy armourcovered  crab and lobster which are called Crustacea from their  hard crustlike shells should belong to the same type  as the delicate hovering butterfly and the buzzing  gnat Let us pause and master this for till we  have done so we cannot understand the wonderful  way in which the creatures of each group in this divi  sion have been adapted to the life they have to lead  In Fig 55 we have four animals a prawn a  centipede a spider and a caterpillar together with  the butterfly into which it turns Now all these  animals wear their skeleton or the hard part of their  bodies not inside as we do with soft flesh growing  over it but outside so that if you grasp any of them  when dead the skin as we should call it will bend  or crack like a piece of thin horn Moreover this  hard outside skeleton is arranged more or less in  rings with softer skin between them as you may see  in the centipede and caterpillar and in the hind part  of the prawn and butterfly and they are to be traced  in many spiders though as a rule they have disap  peared These rings remind us of the worm only  that in the animals of which we are now speaking  they are more marked and whereas the worm has  only hairs for legs these animals have manyjointed  limbs which are of great use in running leaping  and seizing prey It is because of these jointed  limbs that the Crustacea centipedes spiders and  insects are all called Arthropoda or jointed footed  animals Linnaeus called them all Insects because  their bodies are cut into divisions in into secta cut  and although naturalists now generally confine the  word insect to those which have wings and six  legs yet a good English name is so much wanted  which will take in centipedes and spiders as well as  beetles and butterflies that I shall follow Mr Ray  Lankesters suggestion and call all the ringed and  jointedfooted animals Insects  In this sense the prawns and their relations which  are both jointedfooted and cut into parts have been  called the Insects of the Sea and this name helps  to remind us how much they are like the great body  of insects on the land  This likeness is very evident when we compare  the four types in Fig 5 5 Thus we have first the  butterfly whose body you will notice is cut into three  distinct parts the head with one pair of feelers or  antenna on its forehead a pair of eyes on the side of  the head and mouthjaws below the thorax or chest  on which grow the six legs and two pair of wings  and the abdomen or hinder part of the body which  never possesses any limbs The butterfly thus is a  sixlegged winged insect Then we have the centi  pede whose ringed body reminds us of the caterpillar  from which the butterfly springs but which has  jointed feet on every ring Next we come to the  spider and here we find the head and shoulders  joined into one strong piece and bearing four pair of  legs while the abdomen has nearly lost the traces  of rings The antennae are bent down over the  forehead and have been turned as we shall presently  see into pincers hooks and poison fangs while the  short feelers in front of the head which look like  antennae are really a part of the mouth Lastly we  have the prawn with his head and shoulders joined  into one like the spider in the lobster you may see  a curved line marking the spot where these are  joined with five pair of legs while some of its rela  tions have many more and the usual ringed abdo  men which in this case has little paddles under it  for swimming  Now just as when we feed part of our food goes  to make phosphates which form and strengthen our  bones or internal skeleton so do all these animals  make out of the food in their bodies a substance  called cJdtine something like horn and this is  deposited in the outer layer of their skin and  makes a firm skeleton all over the body and eyes  and antennae and legs and within this firm skele  ton the soft animal lives much as a soldier in olden  times was enclosed in his jointed armour But if a  soldier had been placed in armour as a baby he  would have had to change his suit many times before  he became a man and this is also the case with  insects Their covering is not like that of the sea  urchin which we saw could be added to at every  point it is made once for all like the soldiers  armour and the creature must throw it off when it  becomes too small for its body Thus the prawn the  centipede the spider and the caterpillar alike creep  out of their armour many times in their lives leaving  it often standing so perfect that it looks like the  creature itself  We see then that the prawn and his relations  although they live in the sea belong to the ringed  and jointedfooted division and are formed on the  same plan as the landinsects which have spread so  far and wide over the globe These are an active busy  multitude which if they could think and speak would  have far more right to call this earth their world than  we have to call it ours for whether in the sea or in  the rivers and ponds in the fields forests or marshes  at the tops of mountains or in underground caves  and passages in our gardens our cellars our houses  or about our persons anywhere everywhere all over  the world their hosts are to be found  We are accustomed to attach great importance to  the backboned animals the fishes reptiles birds lions  elephants and monkeys because they are compara  tively large and conspicuous but in truth if we ex  cept the human race they are as nothing either in  number or in activity and ingenuity as compared with  the insects and their allies  If we could take one of each species of all the  backboned animals and add to them all the species  of worms mollusca pricklyskinned animals lasso  throwers sponges and lime and flint builders all  these together would only make up 50000 species  or onefifth of the animals on the globe the other  fourfifths or 200000 species belong to the ringed and  jointedfooted animals and of these I 5 0000 are the  sixlegged insects Now we have learnt that if crea  tures succeed in the battle of life it is because they  can hold their own and fight bravely and therefore  we are prepared to find that life has taught these her  active children many new lessons and armed them  with many useful tools and weapons differing greatly  according to the lives they have to lead  And first of all we must turn our attention to the  great group of Crustacea the insects of the sea  For though some of this group as the waterflea and  crayfish live in rivers and ponds while a few such  as the woodlouse and even some kinds of crabs  crawl upon the land yet the chief home of the crus  tacea is the ocean where having scarcely any enemies  so powerful as themselves except their own relations  they run riot both as to numbers and size Think  for a moment of the multitudes of sandhoppers to be  seen leaping on a dry sandy shore in the evening  or which rise like a cloud of dust out of the half  rotten seaweed if you stir it with your hand Try  to reckon up the myriads of shrimps and prawns  which must be caught daily to supply all England  and which are nothing to those that remain behind  Look at the large crabs and lobsters in the fish  mongers shops and think that in London alone  25000 lobsters are often sold in the season in one  single day Then call to mind how you cannot  walk a step on the shore at low tide without seeing  some tiny crab scuttling along in a hurry to catch  something or to escape being caught himself or  how constantly you come across a hermit crab with  a periwinkle or whelk shell on his back making  tracks in the sand as he wanders along Try and  count some day the number of acorn shells Fig 61  p 174 which grow on one single piece of rock or  the groyne of a pier For these too are crustaceans  as are also the barnacles Fig 61 which hang from  floating timber or gather on the bottom of ships  When you have gained some idea of the multitudes  of these creatures on our own shores you will not  have reckoned one millionth part of the crustaceans  which live in the sea for not only are there strange  forms of all kinds on distant shores but there are  oceanic crabs which swim in the open sea for days  without resting just as the albatross flies over it  while smaller crustaceans swarm under the ice in  the Arctic regions and there is scarcely a fish which  has not an animal of this class living on some part  of its body  Of all the many forms however there is probably  not one more beautiful than the delicate transparent  prawn as he paddles along lazily in sea pools or  through the still water of an aquarium His horny  Fig s6 skeleton is so clear  and glasslike that it  looks like crystal while  the formidable toothed  saw protectinghis head  is scarcely visible in  the water and his  delicate antennae and  tapering limbs look as  Common Prawn r  if they would snap at  a Large antennae a 2 antennules or  small antenna b front leg with small a touch AS he SWims  claw bearing a brush t carapace you will notice that it  j i u u u 2 i is not his ten true lesrs  ringed abdomen S swimmerets t in the front part of his  body which row him  along but the little hairy swimmerets S which lie under  the hinder part or abdomen while if anything alarms  him he darts rapidly backwards by a smart stroke  of his fanlike tail t His long antennae or feelers a  are streaming over his back while a pair of shorter  antennae or antennules a 2 as these are called each  bearing three branches move gently to and fro in  the water Why do they do this Because in their  last joint where they touch the head is a little bag  beset with hair and having in it a thick fluid and  some tiny particles of sand and this is the ear of the  prawn from which a nerve passes to the main nerve  mass in his head so that as he moves the antennules  in the water he is as it were listening without ceasing  to all sounds that may pass through it Just above  these hearing organs a pair of gleaming eyes stand  out upon short stalks and if you examine these  under the microscope you will see that they are  composed of a number of sixsided facets arranged  in a hemisphere so that the prawn can keep a sharp  lookout on all sides Here then we have an animal  with a keen power of sight of hearing and of feel  ing and if you have ever watched a prawn hunting  over the scent of a piece of meat which has been  dropped into an aquarium you will not doubt that  he has also the sense of smell though it is difficult  to point out exactly where the smelling organ is  And now suppose that he has scented or caught  sight of his prey whether it be a piece of dead  flesh or a soft tender living shrimp he darts down  upon it and seizing it with his second pair of feet  cl Fig 56 which have large pincers picks it to  pieces with his mouth and claws and eats it much  as a child eats a biscuit held in its hand but not  with the same kind of mouth If you will get hold  of a prawn and try to make out its jaws you will  be terribly puzzled with the number of pieces in  them for you will find no less than six pairs The  outer pair are evidently altered feet which are folded  right over the others so as to cover them in safely  much as you might put your hands before your  mouth under these lie two more pairs with little feelers  attached to them under these again are two other  pairs rather differently shaped and lastly under these  a stout pair of jaws with sharp edges for biting and  a surface for grinding the food These jaws do not  work up and down as ours do but from side to side  like the jaws of a bee or ant and they are most use  ful to the prawn in tearing its food  But how can he have come by so many Let us  look back for a minute to the worm which you will  remember had no true head but only a long upper  lip and a line of rings on its body each bearing its  own pair of bristles Now the prawn also is a ringed  animal only that in his head the separation between  the rings is lost and in his thorax they have grown  closely together so that we can only count them by  the lines under his body and by the limbs which grow  one pair to each ring Thus wherever there has been  a ring there a pair of jointed limbs remains altered to  suit the wants of the animal and as the head is made  up of many rings these come close together and  form the eyestalks the antennae antennules and the  mouthpieces while the five rings of the thorax bear  the five pair of jointed legs and the swimmerets and  tailpieces spring from the rings of the abdomen  While all the Crustacea keep to this rule of a  pair of jointed limbs to each ring the changes are  endless by which these rings and these limbs have  been modified to suit their lives Thus for example  while the prawn uses his second pair of feet for  catching and holding his prey it is the front feet of  the crab and lobster which carry the large strong  claws and in the shrimp these front feet have a kind  of broad hand at the end with a hook attached  Again the skeleton of the prawn remains clear and  transparent but the warlike crab and lobster secrete  layers of lime in their skeleton forming a stony coat  Then again if you look at the nimble sandhopper  T Fig 5 7 with eyes flat in its head instead of being  raised on stalks you will notice that all its body is  ringed right up to its head so that it can bend itself  almost into a circle and flinging back its tail with a  jerk spring about in the sand  In the skeleton shrimp C Fig 57 which crawls  about among the weeds under water the body has  become so thin that it looks like a mere chain of bony  rings with legs hanging on to them In this curious  shrimp I want you particularly to notice the little  baglike flaps g hanging down where the legs join  the body These are its breathing gills in which the  colourless blood of the veins takes up oxygen as they  lie bathed in the water Now when you next eat a  prawn or shrimp lift up the shield or carapace c Fig  56 covering the thorax and you will find a row of  curious bodies b Fig 58 looking something like  curled feathers lying against its sides and fastened  to the legs These are the breathing gills of the  prawn and they will remind you of the ladies  fingers which we clear away in a lobster before  eating it Though both in the lobster and prawn the  shield has grown over and covered these gills yet  you will see that they are really on the outside of  the body at the top of the legs as in the skeleton  shrimp and that water can easily get to them under  the shield In the oyster you will remember that  hairs or cilia swept the water over the gills see p 1 09  but here by a most beautiful arrangement too com  plicated to explain the movement of the feet near  the mouth empties the water out and so draws in  fresh constantly from the back And here again  notice that animals without backbones do not breathe  through their mouths but through their sides  Meanwhile our prawn has been swimming and  feeding and you will scarcely wonder at his activity  or his quick senses when you learn that the same  double chain of nerves which we saw in the leech  runs also under his body g Fig 58 only that  whenever two rings are quite lost in each other two  nerve masses or telegraph stations are also joined  into one so that in the head for example a large  number have come together and make powerful  headstations Jig Fig 58 of nervous power His  muscles too are firm and strong and fill nearly the  whole of his ringed abdomen and of his legs and  claws so that though he looks so transparent and  fairylike he is stronger than he appears  But now there comes a time when he grows  restless and uneasy and ceases to care for food as he  wanders about the rocks on the tips of his toes seem  ing rather to be seeking some particular spot The  fact is that it is nearly a fortnight since he has changed  his armour and as he is young and growing fast it  begins to be very tight for him At last he finds  a spot to his liking and taking hold firmly by his  feet he begins to sway to and fro so as to loosen his  body inside its covering Then all at once a slit  opens between his shield and the skin of his abdomen  and gradually his shoulders and head back out bring  ing with them antennae and eyestalks legs and feet  as perfect as before and having even their tiny spines  and hairs upon them then with a sudden jerk he  pulls out his abdomen and leaves his clear transparent  shell so perfect with the coverings of the eyes anten  nas legs hairs and spines nay even with the lining  of his stomach and digestive tube that you might  believe the real prawn still stood upon the rock  But no the creature himself is rolling helplessly  over his soft body being scarcely able to keep itself  in position and if any animal were to seize him now  his deathhour would have arrived He knows this  well and soon begins to strike out his abdomen and  work his swimmerets which are gradually stiffening  and strengthening and so manages to swim or creep  into some sheltered nook where his inner coat which  has long been forming hardens and he is a valiant  prawn again  He is now quite clean and bright and beautiful  and he loves to remain so and is most particular  about his toilet in fact the prawn is one of the few  Crustacea which has been seen to brush himself up  with great care though probably many others do it  We have noticed that his strongest claws are not  on the front pair of feet as in the crab and lobster  but on the second pair The front claws are fine  and delicate and carry little brushes on their tips  and the prawn has been seen standing on his four  hinder pair of legs with his tail tucked under him  and using his front pair to brush his swimmerets  afterwards passing them through his footjaws to  clear the dirt off the brushes  Not so the large crabs the backs of which we  so often find covered with weed and shells and small  tubeworms which have settled upon them so that  when a crab is old and does not change his shell  he often carries a perfect colony of life about with  him If the prawn is the crystal fairy of the sea  surely the crab when big is the lumbering armed  giant who destroys and devours without mercy  glaring out of his coat of mail and not fearing any  creature except a stronger crab than himself He  spares no animal whether fish mollusc crustacean  or worm that comes in his way as he sidles along  on his strong muscular limbs but seizing them in  his powerful claws he cracks their shells if they have  any and tears their flesh to pieces tucking it greedily  into his mouth which looks as if it were in the  middle of his body He even makes no difficulty of  breaking the shell of one of his own kind and feeding  upon it from behind while it in its turn is eating  some smaller and weaker brother  To devour and be devoured seems to be the main  mission of crabs and they feed so greedily that we  shall not be surprised to learn that besides their  array of outer jaws they and many of the other  Crustacea have hard teeth in their stomach j Fig  58 which help to grind down the food You may  see these teeth well in the stomach of the lobster  where children often call them the lady in her  chair  At first sight it is difficult to understand how a  crab can belong to the ringed animals but if you  lift up the tail which is tucked under the body  you will see that this is ringed like the abdomen of  the prawn and if you break off the legs carefully  you will find under them the fingerlike gills showing  that the body of the crab answers to the head and  thorax of the prawn only that the shield over its  back is much broader and is fastened down firmly  at the sides while the tail is tucked under instead of  standing out  Moreover if you could see the crab when he is  first hatched from the egg i Fig 59 you would see  his tail stretched out and jointed as distinctly as that  of the prawn and at this time with his flat eyes and a  curious spine sticking out of his back he is as unlike  a crab as can well be In this state he swims about  vigorously and in seven or eight days having cast  off his coat several times he loses his spine his back  becomes broader and he becomes a tailed crab 2  Still he goes on swimming and clinging to seaweed  or anything he can find till after moulting a few  more times his tail is folded under and he sinks to  the bottom a true walking crab 3  A change or metamorphosis of this kind takes  place in nearly all the Crustacea during their growth  though it is different in the various forms  After the crab has assumed his real shape he  lives on the bottom of the sea generally in deep  water and in the holes of the rocks and fights  bravely for his life among his companions Only  about four times in the year while he is young a  season of fear and anxiety comes upon him for his  shell will not allow him to grow any larger and he  must part with his strong armour Then he creeps  into the darkest hole he can find and throwing him  self upon his back swells out his body till he forces  his covering shield to break away from the under  part and so he creeps out He does this with much  pain and difficulty for his claws are much larger than  the joints through which they have to be pulled and  they are often cut and lacerated in the process  He could not in fact get out at all if it were not  that his flesh becomes watery before he casts his  shell Every housekeeper knows and avoids buying  a watery crab in which the flesh is poor and thin  and the shell is half filled with fluid When his  shell is cast the crab waits trembling in his hole for  a new layer of lime to form before he can venture  boldly out again It is said that at these times  when a mother crab loses her shell and becomes soft  her mate will watch the hole where she is lying and  keep her safe till her shell has hardened  But how then is it with the hermitcrab He  poor fellow never loses the long tail which all young  crabs have when they are born and moreover the skin  which covers his abdomen is quite soft thus always  offering a tempting morsel to hungry sea animals  One would think that here was a disadvantage very  unfair to the half naked animal But wait a mo  ment and consider how many thousands of hermit  crabs of all sizes feed on the dead fish and garbage  of every seashore and how well they are protected  by the strong winkle and whelk shells which they  choose for their houses so that they can hold their  own when the tiny crabs wearing only their own  brittle coats would soon be cracked and eaten  Evidently the hermitcrab has found stolen houses  an advantage to him and the way in which his tail  has become adapted to his home while keeping all  the usual parts of a crab is most curious  One of his claws c i is much bigger than the  other and closes the opening of the shell after the  rest of the body is drawn in thus barring the door  against most intruders although the fiddler crab  sometimes manages to thrust in his thin pincers and  pinch the hermit to death His next two feet are  strong though pointed and are able to take a firm  hold on the sand as he walks and to bear the weight  of the shell while the two comparatively thin pairs  which follow serve to shift his body in its house His  swimmerets no longer needed are stunted and small  and his soft abdomen follows the winding of the shell  in which he lives while the tail fin no longer broad  and flat is turned into a kind of grappling hook  which takes hold so firmly that he is scarcely ever  dragged out alive So there is but little danger for  him except when he is changing his shell for a larger  one and this he does wonderfully quickly never  leaving his old house till he has found a new one  In fact the hermit succeeds so well in life that he is  extremely pugnacious and will soon make great  havoc in an aquarium Moreover he often feeds two  other animals besides himself for a parasitic anemone  often lives upon his shell and a beautiful worm 55  shelters within it and has been seen to tear the food  out of the crabs mouth  So each in their several ways the prawns lobsters  and crabs struggle for their livelihood Brave hardy  and voracious they spare scarcely any creature of the  sea of moderate size whether dead or living and  they fight so madly that fishermen sending lobsters  alive to London are obliged to run a piece of wood  in the joints of the claws to prevent them from  maiming each other on the road  They care but little for lost limbs for these will  grow again and when wounded so that they might  bleed to death they throw off the shattered limb  at the next joint where a new skin quickly forms  and the danger is averted No doubt hundreds die  both in youth and age yet the multitudes never  diminish for one lobster alone will produce 20000  eggs which she will carry patiently for six months  under her abdomen fastened together by gluey  threads Even after she has broken open the eggs  by the movement of her tail and released the baby  lobsters she will still carry them till their coat is  hard and firm and only then leave them to wander  alone The crab and the prawn on the contrary  turn their little ones out at once to swim as scarcely  visible specks in the open sea where they feed and  grow till their strange changes of shape are worked  out  The crab family however are not satisfied with  one kind of life the velvet fiddlercrab of our shores  has its hind feet broad and flat and may be seen  swimming when the common crab can only creep  while the oceanic crab has taken to the open sea  and can swim for days without resting feeding the  while Then on the other hand there are crabs  living on the land The racing crab of Ceylon  which will outstrip the swiftest runner burrows in  the dry sand and though it likes to have its gills  moist dies if held under water The frogcrab of  the Indian ocean climbs on the roofs of houses  the robber crab of the Mauritius lives in holes lined  with cocoanut fibre at the roots of the cocoanut  palm and breaking open the nuts feeds upon the  fruit while the landcrab of the West Indies burrows  in the ground and goes only once a year to the sea  to lay her eggs Still all these crabs retain enough  of their old habits to like to have their breathing  gills wet and most of them visit water daily for this  purpose while some of them have a curious way of  keeping the water enclosed and freshening it with  air while others use the water till it is exhausted  and then raise their shield or carapace and breathe  as land animals  And now after hearing of these land crabs we  shall not find it so difficult to believe that the little  woodlouse of our gardens which curls itself up like  a ball and is the only form we have remaining like  the huge trilobites of ages gone by is a true crus  tacean adapted for breathing air though still loving  moist places  But we must return to the sea where a most  curious and interesting group still remains for us to  study We have heard of old families among men  who having met with misfortune have had the good  sense to set to work and earn their daily bread in  quiet obscurity and among the lower animals we  have seen that  Fig 6 1   many like the  sponge and oy  ster give up the  free roving life of  their childhood  and settle down  upon one spot  But who ever be  fore heard of a  creature which  after swimming  about in a ra  tional manner  with an eye or  eyes to see with  and antennae to  feel with behav  ing like an ordi  nary and respect  able individual  should put its  forehead down to  a rock and ce  ment it there by  means of glue from its antennae and should remain  thus all the rest of its life with its head downwards and  its heels in the air kicking its food into its mouth Yet this is the true history of the barnacles and  acorn barnacles of our coasts and nothing can  explain such extraordinary behaviour except the  overcrowding of the sea and the struggle for life  which drove these curious creatures to prefer feeding  upside down in places where others left room for  them to starving in an upright position  It is worth while to spend a short time sitting  by a seaside pool or on the steps of a pier to watch  the animals within the white shelly cones called  acornshells Fig 61 foreground feeding in the sea  water Each little cone is made of a number of  shelly pieces and in the middle of these you will see  from time to time two valves v open through which  a tuft of feathery transparent fingers c is thrust out  looking like a curl of delicate hair Then after  opening out in the water the curl is drawn up again  just as you are beginning to admire it and the valves  close Not for long however for almost imme  diately they open again and the same process is re  peated so that in a group of acorn barnacles all is  in motion as one after another sweeps the sea for  food  These tufts are in fact the fringed legs of the  balanus as the creature is called and looking at  him as he is fastened down inside the shell you will  see that he is something like a rough attempt at a  shrimp lying on its back mouth uppermost so as to  be able to seize and devour the minute creatures of  the sea drawn in by the fringes of the legs  In this way safely ensconced in his jointed shelly  carapace of carbonate of lime it is easy to see that  the balanus lives more securely than if he had re  mained a freely roving creature as we see him at  port  And here we must take leave of the Crustacea  We have really only made acquaintance with three  branches 1st the tenfooted and stalkeyed crus  taceans the prawns and crabs 2d those with eyes  fixed in the shell and breathinggills fixed to the legs  the sandhoppers and skeleton shrimps and 3d the  barnacles But these by no means represent even  the chief forms The Kingcrab of the Moluccas  with his horseshoe carapace and spiked tail repre  sents a whole race which flourished long before the  coalforests grew The beautiful little fairyshrimpsf  of our ponds are another type whose feet are used as  breathinggills while the tiny waterflea J and cypris  of our ponds are true crustaceans though they have  twovalved shells like a scallop  The histories of these little beings are as yet not  much known and in truth it is impossible to follow  out all the strange vagaries of the Crustacea with  out making them a life study Even when we have  exhausted those which live independent lives there  remains a whole mass of parasites which fix them  selves on the backs and in the gills of fishes and  even under the tails of their distant relations the  crabs and lobsters  Thus we find that these insects of the sea  have spread everywhere where there is water and  have even found their way on to the land Yet  they are scarcely likely ever to make much way on  dry ground for we have seen that they have always  a lingering tendency to breathe water and therefore  they are at a disadvantage among the myriads of  insects fitted for the air Meanwhile though we  may know more of the habits of the spider and ant  than of the crabs and the barnacles which hide from  us in the ocean yet those who love to study compli  cated family history will find no class in the animal  kingdom with such an interesting and involved  genealogy as that of the Crustacea or crustcovered  animals  CHAPTER IX  THE SNAREWEAVERS AND THEIR HUNTING  RELATIONS  So dangles oer the brook depending low  The spider artist till propitious breeze  Buoy her athwart the stream From shore to shore  She fastens then her horizontal thread  Sufficient bridge and traversing alert  Her finespun radii flings from side to side  Shapes her concentric circles without art  And all accomplished couches in the midst  Herself the centre of her flimsy toils  HURDIS  T was a hot spring night on  the coast of the Mediterranean in  the south of France and the hum  of the night insects filled the air  The nightbeetles were flying hither  and thither and the crickets on the  terraces of the olive groves were  loudly chirping their lovesongs  One in particular whose dark brown  body could scarcely be distinguished  against the bank even by nocturnal  enemies was working his wingcases  with a will and sending out a clear  and piercing cry He little thought  that he was sounding his own deathnote but so it was  for behind him from under a large stone in a damp  corner in the side of the bank an enemy was stealthily  approaching  Any one who had been lately studying prawns and  lobsters in the sea on this same shore would almost  have fancied that this enemy was a curious small lob  ster which had come upon the land for two large  claws were stretched on each side of his head and  with them he felt his way as he crawled along his  jointed feet were cased in horny armour and so was  his whole body which had a shield over the head  and shoulders as a prawn has while his tail which  dragged heavily behind him was covered with the  same kind of horny rings Two large eyes with  some smaller ones near them shone in the front of  his head and he was slowly but surely advancing  upon the unconscious cricket And now he was  close upoji him and in a second almost too quickly  for the movement to be seen the long claws were  thrown forward and the cricket was seized and held  up in the air But our friend had no intention of  yielding so easily he was strong and he struggled  violently in vain for his captor briskly curled up  the long tail which had till now seemed such a  burden to him and from the tip of it thrust a  poisoned dart into the body of his victim So the  sturdy cricket died in the grasp of the Scorpion  Nor was his captor long in devouring his prey  Bringing the cricket down to his mouth he pierced  his skin with the sharp pincers p Fig 63 which  take the place of antennae on his head and soon  sucked out the juices of his body then dropping the  empty skin he went dragging slowly on his way in  search either of fresh food or to find some mate  wandering like himself  Plenty of these fierce little Scorpions which hide  under stones by day and come out by night may be  found in the warm sunny south and though they  look so like crustaceans they are true land animals  They have no means of spinning and have a poison  dart in the tail quite peculiar to themselves yet they  belong to the spider family as may be seen by their  eight pairs of legs their sharp pincers which take the  place of the antennae of insects their claws which  are part of their mouthpieces and are fixed to the  jaws and the narrow slits under the abdomen  through which they take in air to breathe They  lead but a lonely life for whether in the sandy  plains of Africa where they are often as much as a  foot long or in the burning heat of South America  or on the warm bright shores of Italy each scorpion  burrows under his own protecting stone rarely having  any other with him Even in summer it is only  at night that they seek companionship while in the  winter they burrow deep in the ground and sleep  till the warmth comes round again  While the spider is the industrious and skilful  snareweaver of its class the scorpion is the fierce  bandit knowing well the power of its sting and the  terror it inspires and like the bandit it lives in a  state of perpetual warfare flinging its tail over its  head and extending its claws at the least alarm and  either fighting till death or running rapidly back  wards facing its foe till it reaches a place of safety  And in like manner as the robbers wife shut out from  the companionship of the rest of womankind will  love and defend her children with wild devotion so  the female scorpion will carry her young brood for  many weeks after they are born clustering all over  her back till they are able to fight for themselves  We must not however pause long over these  solitary and dangerous creatures for a far more  interesting group of the spider class flourishes here  in our own country where all who wish may study  its members  Instead therefore of lingering in the warm south  let us return to England where in the cracks of  some old paling or under the leaves of a shrub on a  summers evening after some days of thunder and  rain we may find a common garden spider lying  crumpled up as if half dead Her web long ago  destroyed by the wind and the rain has left her no  means of getting food for many long hours and she  is waiting patiently till the weather will allow her to  spin fresh snares How mean and shrivelled and  helpless she looks any one will know who has ever  found a spider in this deplorable condition and cer  tainly no one at first sight would imagine that this  crumpled looking object could have the ingenuity  and skill to weave the web which a few hours later  will be stretched across the bushes And yet as set  free from your hand she hurries away scrambling  over the ground in the twinkling of an eye or  dropping nimbly by means of her almost invisible  thread there can be no doubt that she is both active  and intelligent and a little patient examination will  show that the poor despised spider which for some  unknown reason is so often disliked by mankind is  one of the most industrious and cleanly skilful and  patient of lifes children while she carries upon her  body some of the most curious implements ever de  vised for doing her work in the world  Look at her limbs in their jointed casings Fig 64  and you will see that here is the same outside horny  skeleton as in the prawn and the scorpion with  elastic skin between the joints but her abdomen a  has almost entirely lost the traces of rings and is  often covered with fine down while her head and  shoulders welded like theirs into one piece t are  sturdy and strong giving her great advantage in  attacking and devouring the numerous insects which  fall victims to her bloodthirsty appetite  Perhaps you will think at first that she has  antennae for two short feelers p p Fig 64 stand  out in front of her head But these like the claws  of the scorpion are part of her jaws and are  fastened on to them None of the spider family have  any true antennae In the scorpion we found them  turned into pincers p t Fig 63 in the spider they  have become most dangerous and powerful fangs i  and 72 Fig 64 which hang down over her mouth  and while the scorpion carries her poison in her tail  the spider bears it in her head and as we shall pre  sently see pours it into her victim through these  pointed weapons  But now while we are talking of her our friend  the spider is beginning to grow restless for as even  ing draws on and the temperature of the air and  other signs promise a fine night she is anxious to  spin a new web so as not to go supperless to bed  Have you any idea how she does this for she has  nothing but her own body both to supply the  material and the machinery for the work  Look carefully under her abdomen and near the  tip you will find six little nipples s looking some  thing like miniature copies of the teats of a cow  Under these nipples inside her body there are special  glands in which a kind of gum is secreted and this  dries when it comes into the air and forms the silken  thread from which the spider hangs and out of which  she forms her web And now comes the almost  incredible part of the story These nipples which  are called spinnerets have not merely one opening  like a cows teat but each one tiny as it is is pierced  with at least a hundred holes and when the spider  begins her web more than six hundred separate  strands go to make the one slender thread which  you see stretched out from her body The four  spinnerets nearest the tail give out the long threads  the two above moving from side to side weave the  whole into one connected line Nor is this all for  the spider can close any of the holes at will and a  fine or a coarse a dry or a spangled thread comes  from her body according to the use she wishes to  make of it  But when the thread is made how is it to be  drawn out and guided on its way Under the  microscope her feet are seen to be formed of three  claws the middle one longer and bent so as to grasp  the threads as she runs and the other two toothed  liked combs With these combs and the spines  and hairs upon her legs she manipulates the tender  thread as it oozes from her body and does with it  what she will  And now let us watch her at her work Running  hither and thither she first selects a spot c to start  from and pressing her spinnerets against it leaves  there a little lump of sticky silk Then standing  quite still she gives out from her spinnerets a light  floating thread Longer and longer it grows and  floats in the evening air and by and by the end  catches on some bush let us say at the point d  Instantly the spider feels the pull and fastening the  end out of her own body to the sticky lump c she  runs along the line c d strengthening it with silk as  she goes That line being firm she can use it as her  tightrope and running from bush to bush may either  let fresh threads float or carry them with her from  point to point till she has made a square or triangle  of threads c d e f anchored here and there to  the leaves and stems And now she must make  the cross lines so going to the middle a of the  highest line she drops down and swinging to and fro  catches the lower line and stretches a vertical  cord a 8  Then she is ready to begin the web Up to this  time she has been obliged to work slowly and with  many difficulties but from this moment the work  goes on apace Running to the middle of the line  a b she fixes her thread there and then goes on to  the other side carrying the line with her and keeping  it carefully with her feet from clinging to the one on  which she runs Arrived at the stretched line she  fastens this loose thread to it at I and so makes one  of the spokes of the wheel Then moving a little  farther along she fixes another end at 2 and running  back to the centre forms another spoke and so on  through 3 4 etc till all the spokes are made  Then she goes back to the middle and walking care  fully round and round the spokes lays down a  winding thread from the centre to the outside fixing  it to each of the spokes by a minute drop of gum  At first this thread is dry and hard but when the  spider is at a short distance from the centre she  changes her material and gives out a beautiful fine  thread spangled at every point with minute drops of  gum which will not harden in the air so that by  the time she has reached the end of the spokes she  has left behind her a glorious spangled web closely  woven and wonderfully elastic because the drops of  gum yield gently as the web sways while they are  so sticky that no insect flying against the web is  likely to get away again  In this manner in about threequarters of an  hour the nimble little spider has woven a snare  measuring perhaps half a yard across and spangled  with more than a hundred thousand gumdrops and  there is yet time for some of the late flies to be  caught before night comes on She has left the  middle of the web with its dry scaffolding thread  because it is there that she hangs head downwards  waiting for her prey Sometimes however she will  prefer hiding herself under some leaves in a bush  and then she will carry with her a strong thread g  attached to the middle of the web to give her warning  of any disturbance And now a goodsized fly comes  buzzing along and running its body against the web  gives it a shake Instantly   The spiders touch how exquisitely fine  Feels at each thread and lives along the line  and almost before you can see her she has darted  from her hidingplace to the centre of the web  Here she herself gives it a shake to find whether it  will be answered showing that a live object is causing  the disturbance The unfortunate fly quivers in the  toils betraying its whereabouts and straight the  spider darts upon it and with one sharp bite ends its  life It is not however strictly speaking with her  mouth that she has bitten it but with those two  poison fangs which we spoke of just now which hang  down over the mouth While she was spinning her  web or patiently waiting under the leaves these fangs   were shut into the cases above them h z just  as a clasp knife is shut into its handle but directly  she seized her prey they were opened and the sharp  points driven into the flys body gave out poison from  their tips and quickly put an end to its life  And now being hungry she seizes the dead fly  with the two feelers or palpi of her jaws and hold  ing it to her mouth sucks out its tender juices and  she has no need to pause for breath for you will  remember that she does not breathe through her  mouth It is under her abdomen that you must  look for the two narrow slits b through which air  is taken into sacs within her body  But another interruption occurs While she is  still busy with her meal a fresh shake of the web  informs her that a new victim is caught and she  hastens to the spot This time it is a strong night  beetle which is caught in the toils and she cannot  grapple with him so rashly as with the fly while his  struggles threaten to break the net In this dilemma  she has a stratagem ready Pressing her spinnerets  against the web she begins to weave round him a  covering of silk and going closer and closer as his  legs are entangled she twists him round and round  with her feet till quite enveloped he can struggle no  longer and receives his deathblow  But if by chance it had been a wasp and she  dreaded its sting she herself would have torn the  strands of the web and let it fly away sooner than  run the risk of being the conquered instead of the  conqueror  So the garden spider lives spreading her snares  with wonderful skill and care running and dropping  from her thread with agility and precision and  making great havoc in the insect world with her  poisonous fangs and if you ask what apparatus she  has within to guide all these wonderful actions we  must go back again to the knots of nervous matter  which we found in the body of the leech For here  in the spider we find that many of these knots are  clustered thickly together in the head and neck  forming what might almost be called a brain and  connected with the line of knots running along in  the under part of the abdomen Thus while the  spider is endowed with many tools and weapons upon  her body she has also a strong battery of nerve  power within to govern them  Nor can we doubt that she owes to the stern  lessons of life much of her skill and intelligence  She has to undergo sad privations and in bad  weather when starvation stares her in the face she  is often driven to wander in search of such insects  as she can catch while long experience has taught  her race never to spin a web when it would be  destroyed by wind or rain but to fast patiently or  trust to seizing any small insects coming within her  reach rather than to use the small stock of silk  which cannot be replenished till she gets fresh food  You may perhaps wonder that all this time we  have spoken of the spider as she but the truth is  that the female spiders do most if not all of the  work for the male spiders are much smaller and  very rarely spin webs They seem to live much at  the expense of their wives and sad to relate are  very often killed by their spouses when these are  tired of their company  And now if the female spider succeeds in getting  a living and escaping the birds and other enemies  until the autumn she spins a strong cocoon of  yellow silk which she secures under some stone or  into a crack in the wall and though it measures  scarcely halfaninch across yet she manages to pack  into it from six to eight hundred eggs and then  leaves it and next spring when the warm weather  comes the young spiders struggle out of the eggs  and working themselves free from the skin which  hampers their limbs cling together in a ball for  about a month and then separate and begin to spin  webs as their mother did before them They cast  their skin many times before they are grown up and  even afterwards they creep out of it once a year and  begin again with a fresh bright coat  From this garden spider we have learnt to know  roughly the manner of life of the spinning spiders  and the tools with which they work but their  devices for gaining a living the nature of their webs  and the different nooks and corners they find for  shelter are almost endless Look at the common  housespider instead of carelessly sweeping her web  away and you will find that she lays her threads  roughly in all directions in the corner of the room  running from one to another till she has filled it up  with a fine web not sticky but so entangled that  the flies catch their feet in its meshes In one  corner you will find a little silken tube like a  thimble which she has made as a house to hide  in out of sight of her prey Her web will last  for many weeks while the gardenspider must spin  afresh or mend her web every twentyfour hours but  on the other hand the housespider is less likely to  have an abundant supply of insects and her web is  often ruthlessly destroyed She will sometimes live  from six to eight years and each year she lays her  eggs in a cocoon and hides them in a tuft of silk  thickened with scraps of whitewash and plaster and  broods over them till the young ones are born In  the walls of some outhouse or warm greenhouse you  may often find small spiders webs in the summer  time with three or four cocoons in them and  numbers of tiny spiders creeping out upon the web  Then look carefully on a summers morning  among the gorse and heath of a common and you  will find delicate webs spread almost on the surface  of the ground Instead of trampling these under foot  seek out the centre of each web and there in many  cases you will find a hole leading straight into a  tunnel in the ground This tunnel will be lined by  a tough web while at the bottom the little spider will  be crouching her feet resting on the threads and  ready in a moment to dart out when the toils are  shaken This spider has learnt how to hide herself  from the birds the squirrels the frogs and the toads  which devour her neighbours while at the same time  she spreads her nets and catches the beetles or the  Nest of one of the Trapdoor Spiders Moggiidge  D The door which closes naturally by its own elasticity and weight  m marks of the spiders claws where she has held it down from inside  midges for her daily food If when wandering along  the country lanes you look carefully in the loose soil  of the bank or the crevices of old stone walls you can  scarcely fail to find some of these tiny webs leading  into silklined holes where the spider is waiting for  her prey  Yet even these are not the most clever of all  spiders for on the shores of the Mediterranean you  may find some which not only live in silklined  tunnels but actually make doors to their houses see  Fig 66 These doors are made of layers of web  and earth and they shut down naturally by their  own weight so as to be quite hidden by the grass  growing over them but if by chance they are dis  turbed the spider herself will often rush to the top  of the tube and sticking her claws into the door  D m Fig 66 will hold it down with all her might  as she presses her body against the sides of her  home  Now see how this spider gains her living A  naturalist named Erber once sat out for many hours  on a moonlight night watching her doings and soon  after nine oclock he saw two of these spiders come  out each from their holes and pushing open their  doors fasten them back by fine threads to the blades  of grass near and then spin a web round the open  hole and go back into their tunnels By and by two  nightbeetles were caught one in each web and in  an instant the spiders darted out and pierced their  victims with their poisoned fangs sucked out their  soft flesh and then carried the empty bodies away  to some distance from their holes Then Erber left  them and in the morning the spiders had cleared  away all trace of the webs and were shut down  snugly in their hidden homes  Which among us works more cleverly or with  more industry for daily bread than these little  spiders and they do it too among many difficulties  and dangers for the birds and lizards are watching  above ground to make a meal of them and the  centipedes and other crawling insects creep into  their holes to attack them Some of them have  learned a means of escaping even this danger for  they make a second tunnel branching out of the first  and build a doorway between the two so that they  can retreat into the second passage in case of attack  and setting their back against the door baffle the  intruder  So in the air and on and under the earth the  spiders spin their webs and since they must try  every means of gaining a living in this struggling  world there are some such as the wolfspiders which  instead of spinning webs and waiting for their prey  to come to them search for it among the low bushes  and leaves and grass and use their spinners chiefly  for letting themselves drop from a height or for spin  ning their cocoons and lining the holes in the walls  where they retire for their winter sleep You may  find these running about in the woods and on heaths  and if you catch them about June you will find  each one carrying a snowywhite ball under her body  This is her cocoon containing about a hundred  eggs and if you try to take it away she will fight  for it as courageously as any human mother I  took away one three times from a mother on Keston  Common last summer and each time she seized it  again and went off gaily with it at last none the  worse for the struggle  Then there are the leapingspiders which pounce  upon their prey creeping slowly along a wall and  sliding nearer and  nearer till sudden  ly they leap and  seizing the victim  kill it and return  by the silken thread  which connects  them with the wall  above and saves  them if they fall  too far These  spiders often roll  up their cocoons  in the leaves of  some bush where  you may find them  in the early spring  The hunters and  leapers can often A Hunting Spide  find food which  does not come in the way of the webspinners and  when all the domains of earth and air are overrun  then there are other kinds which take to the water  How few people think as they walk through quiet  countrylanes that in the deep watery ditches often  to be found near rivers which run in low ground  a little waterspider may be living coming to the  top to breathe as a diver does and carrying down  air bubbles entangled in the fur which covers her  body and between her legs and so filling a curious  domed hall which she has built in the water below  It is worth some trouble to find this wonderful  little creature which has often been seen in the fens  of Cambridgeshire and in the ditches near Oxford  and also in Ireland and which though fitted to  breathe in the air has learnt to take refuge in the  water and find there her food and her home She  fixes her house on the stem of some waterplant  spinning there a thimble of delicate silk into which she  carries air shaken off as bubbles from her body and  this air rising up to the top of the thimble gradually  displaces the water and fills the whole chamber  And so in peaceful but not entirely stagnant water  On light sprays hung  By silk cords slung  Oerarched by a silken dome  Is the airy hall  With waterproof wall  Where the spider makes her home  and there she lives quite dry and spins her silken  cocoon with its hundred eggs out of which come  the young spiders which begin at once to build  and live as she does Even when she makes her  journeys to the surface to catch waterflies and  other insects or to take breath the water does not  wet her for the bubbles of air which glisten over  her body making it shine like quicksilver keep her  skin dry  And here we must take leave of the true spiders  which roam all over the world and range in size from  the huge hunting spiders of South America and  Ceylon whose legs will cover a foot of ground and  who have been seen to prey upon young birds and  lizards to the tiny red moneyspinner which is so  light that like others as small as itself it is often  carried up in the air as its thread is caught in the  light breeze It is probably from the threads of  these tiny spiders that the gossamer webs are  formed which may be sometimes seen on a bright  summer morning hanging in the air entangled in  each other either empty or with their owners within  them  Whether they are large or small however we  find in all spiders the same poison fangs the same  complex thread and the same scrupulous neatness  and cleanliness which makes them keep every joint  and hair of the body free from dust and dirt and  leads them to avoid any dead and decaying food  with disgust and a quickness of intelligence which  leads them to the most curious expedients for holding  their own in the world  But as in other classes so here too we may be  sure that lower kinds are filling nooks and corners  left by their more advanced relations and our  history of the spider family will not be complete  unless we cast a glance at the tiny insignificant  mites and ticks which swarm on the land and in  the water and live chiefly on the bodies of other  animals  These curious little creatures live that double life  which we shall find afterwards in the true insects  for while young spiders are born like the mother  and only grow larger as they cast their skins the  mites run about for some time on six legs only and  then hiding themselves in some crack in the ground  lie motionless for many days and then come out  with eight legs as minute spiders only that their  body is not divided but is all one round mass and  they breathe by means of curious airtubes like the  true insects  It is these tiny creatures which destroy the  leaves of our trees by burrowing into them and  sucking the liquid sap leaving little yellow and  faded blotches wherever they have been Some  times you may find a leaf with a fine almost invisible  web spread over its under surface and there you  may be sure that a complete colony of mites are  feeding and bringing up their little larvae or young  ones which when the leaves fall to the ground will  hide themselves under stones or in the earth and  come out perfect mites to take to fresh trees and  form new colonies Whenever you see the leaves  of a vine spotted with red there the red mite has  been taking up its home and the gardener knows  very well how the rosetrees and acacias will pine  away when the mites assert their right to live upon  them Then too there are the water mites which  swarm in the snug shallows of the wayside ponds or  sit on the smooth leaves of the waterplants in which  they pierce holes for their eggs These eggs by and  by hatch into young larvae some of which feed on  plants while others plunge their suckers into water  insects and only roll off to the bottom when they  wish to hide themselves before turning into the  perfect mites which again swim about in company  Then there are the innumerable mites and ticks  which live in the feathers of birds or on beetles and  bees and even on their relations the spiders while  others burrow in the flesh of mice dogs and cattle  holding on by sharp hooks attached to their mouth  and sucking the blood of their victims and most  of us have suffered from the bite of the harvestbug  which is a true mite and burrows under the skin of  animals and of man himself Among these mites  we find just as we did in the parasitic worms that  the more these tiny creatures live within and upon  other living beings the more do they become degraded  and lose their active powers  Thus the eight legged insects swarm in the  fields on the trees and in the water in our cheese  our flour and upon other animals and with their  tiny weapons make good their right to live and  though we scarcely recognise their existence unless  they annoy us or spoil and destroy what we value  yet the lifehistory of the scorpions the spiders and  the mites is full of interest and if we could watch  them all in their daily labour we should find them  probably quite as active and industrious as man him  self and in many cases struggling far more bravely  and patiently against the thousand dangers and  privations which threaten them at every moment of  their lives  INSECT SUCKERS AND SITERS  CHAPTER X  INSECT SUCKERS AND BITERS WHICH CHANGE  THEIR COATS BUT NOT THEIR BODIES  Yet hark how through the peopled air  The busy murmur glows  The insect youth are on the wing  Eager to taste the honeyed spring  And float amid the liquid noon  Some lightly oer the current skim  Some show their gaily gilded trim  Quick glancing to the sun GRAY  F any of us were asked the  question What is the use of plants  I think there is little doubt that we  should answer To make the world  beautiful the air pure and to provide  food for man and beast But if the  same question could be asked of the  little green aphis clinging on to the  stem of a rosetree see Fig 69 he  would know nothing of the beauty  or the pure air nor would he think  of man or beast but he would pro  bably answer that plants are made  for plantlice And from his point  of view he would be right for there is probably not  a single herb or shrub or tree in the world which  has not its own peculiar insect sucking the sap and  living upon the sweet juices We cannot do better  than begin our history of the sixlegged insects  by these little plantsuckers which we all know so  well calling them blight insects when we find  them covering our rosetrees or our geraniums in  the greenhouses or our appletrees in the garden  You may easily find them huddled together on a  stem or bud raised on their six slim legs with their  heads close down to the plant and looking sleepily  out of their two little brown eyes Yet they are by  no means asleep but very busy for their mouth  which like that of all other insects is composed of  six parts is so formed that they can plunge it deep  into the stem and suck and suck all day filling their  round green bodies with sweet sap A wonderful  little mouth it is the two lips being joined together  into a kind of split tube out of which are thrust the  four jaws in the shape of long thin lancets to pierce  the plant When once these insects have fixed  themselves they never seem to tire of sucking but  take in so much juice that after passing through the  body it oozes out again at the tail and the tips ot  two curious little tubes Fig 69 standing up on  their backs This juice falling on the stems and  leaves of the plant covers them with those sticky  drops often called honeydew  It cannot be said that these little insects lead  very exciting lives for they make no homes neither  do they take any care of their young ones and only  move about when they wish to fix upon some new  spot and yet they are very interesting both because  the ants visit them to sip their sweets as we shall  see in Chapter XII and also because they manage  to live in such numbers in spite of being so helpless  and stupid  The secret of this is that they have a special way  of sending young ones into the world If you look  at a stem covered with plantlice towards the end of  the summer you will find among the wingless sucking  insects some larger ones straggling about the plant B  Fig 69 which have delicate transparent wings These  are the fathers and mothers whose wings have grown  gradually under their splitting skins and they will  lay the eggs to be hatched next year But if you  look in the early spring you will find no winged  plantlice or aphides but only the little roundbodied  green forms and yet new ones are constantly appear  ing Where do these come from  Do you remember how the hydra of the jellyfish  went on budding and budding for years before another  true eggbearing jellyfish appeared see p 64 Now  we have an insect doing the same thing for as soon  as one of these wingless aphides is about ten or twelve  days old there come from her body not eggs but  young living aphides like herself three four or even  seven a day which struggle over the backs of their  companions till they find a clear spot on the stem  where they fix their mouths and suck like the others  only moving to struggle out of their skins about  three or four times a day till they are full grown  Then these young ones begin to bud in the same  way in their turn so that in a very short time from  two or three mothers a whole plant is covered In  fact it has been reckoned that a single aphis  may give rise in one summer to a quintillion  i 000000000000000000000000000000 of  little ones  After this we shall not be surprised that the  plantlice have taken possession of so many of the  green things in the world and the only wonder is  that they have not destroyed them all This they  would certainly have done if it were not for their  enemies but the birds delight in them as dainty  morsels beetles and earwigs devour them and flies  lay eggs in their bodies while the ladybird eats no  other food and the blind grub of a fly Musca  aphidivord glides about on the stems see g Fig 69  seizing the aphides in his mouth sucking out their  juicy bodies and dropping the empty skins by  hundreds  And now if once your eyes are open to see these  tiny juicesuckers you may find numbers of different  kinds living their little lives in the fresh country air  Have you never picked up an appleleaf or elm  leaf covered with something looking like tufts of  white cotton so sticky that you cannot clear your  fingers of it If so look carefully at it next time  you find it and under each white tuft you will see  an insect struggling along which is like a roseaphis  only without the little tubes on its back In fact  this fluffy stuff is a kind of wax which oozes out  with the sweet liquid all over the body of the insect  protecting it from the sun and from enemies as it  feeds and making it look like a lady in a feathery  white ball dress Some species of these fluffcovered  aphides fasten on to the stems of appletrees and  have been known entirely to destroy them Then  again there are others which eat their way into the  leaves of trees making rosy bladders upon them  while others attack the wheat or the hops In mild  seasons when these insects increase rapidly they have  been known to destroy a whole hopharvest  Nor are the aphides the only plantsuckers Look  at the bushes in summer and you cannot fail to see  little clusters of froth here and there Fig 70 known  as cuckoospit because they first appear at the time  when the cuckoo sings Move this froth carefully  and in the middle of it you will find the cuckoospit  grub c which has given out this froth in bubbles  from its tail to shelter it from the burning sun and  hide it from the birds as it sits and sucks the sap  But in the autumn the spit if not dried up will be  empty for the insect after losing its last coveringskin  has come out with wings a little brown froghopper  F Fig 70 which pats down upon your hand and is  gone again in a moment before you have time to  examine the wonderful beauty of its wings Then  again there are the numberless little scaly plantlice  which spend their lives flattened against the stalks  and branches of shrubs looking like little lumps upon  the stem so that while the cuckoospit is protected  by its froth the scaly plantlice often escape by their  likeness to the colour of the shrub on which they are  It is to these animals that the beautiful cochineal  insect of Mexico belongs and also the lac insect of  India which gives out the red lac used in the manu  facture of sealingwax  Al these are plant suckers and rarely move  any distance from their home but there is another  group which has learnt to run actively in search  of food of which some suck the juice of plants  while others have made use of their sharp lancet  mouths to steal the blood of animals These active  suckers are the airbugs and waterbugs and though  we dislike the name because one ugly wingless  species haunts our own rooms when we do not keep  them clean yet many are very beautiful creatures  Look among the cabbages in the garden and you  will scarcely fail to find a pretty little red and black  bug P Fig 70 running over them and piercing the  leaves for their juice while a grey one with black  red and yellow spots is busy at work on the rasp  berry fruit If you touch or frighten these plant  suckers the disagreeable smell which they will give  out from their bodies will suggest to you at once  that they belong to the bug family  Then there are those curious thinbodied insects  which skim over the ponds in the summer actually  running on the top of the water for which reason  they are called water measurers m Fig 71  because their legs when stretched out seem to mea  sure off the water as they go along These ghost  like looking insects are waterbugs whose mouths are  made for sucking like the landbugs and woe betide  the little waterflies which come in their way Pro  tected themselves from the water by a thick coating  of plush under their bodies they glide along silently  and rapidly and seizing their prey hold it in their  forelegs while they suck out the juices Thus these  active little creatures have learnt to find food on  the water which their land relations cannot reach  while a still bolder race the waterboatmen B  Fig 71 which lay their eggs on the leaves of the  waterplants dive into the water carrying their air  with them and feed upon the tadpoles and water  grubs below  In any pond in the summer time you may see  these agile insects rowing themselves along underside  uppermost by their two long hind legs and poking  their tails out of the water to take in air under their  wings Then as they row themselves down again you  can see bubble after bubble escaping from the tail till  they come up for more You might think they were  waterbeetles but their strong wings which they use  to leave their ponds by night are all four made use  of in flying whereas in beetles the two front wings are  only stiff covers to preserve the delicate ones under  neath Moreover these bugs have the same lancet  mouths as the plantlice with which they pierce the  skins of the tadpoles soft grubs and other water  animals near the bottom of the pond and suck out  their bodies leaving nothing but the empty filmlike  skins They are most voracious animals and will  attack even small fish Their habit of moving up  side down is of great use to them in feeding for  many of their victims have hard backs so the water  boatmen dive down and come up under their prey  thus attacking them on their soft side  Thus we see that the sucking lice and bugs with  their beaklike mouths have bored their way into all  kinds of living food into plants shrubs and trees in  all countries and into the flesh of men and animals  both on the land and in the water for many of  the lice on birds and other creatures belong to this  class  And yet in spite of their numbers they are not  nearly so destructive as the next class of insects we  must speak of namely the straightwinged insects  the grasshoppers crickets locusts and cockroaches  which are not content with sucking but tear and  devour the grass and leaves with their strong jaws  These greedy devourers are a very ancient race of  landinsects and in fact if we attached importance  to pedigrees they should have come first in order  for at the time when the piece of coal you put on  your fire today and which has been lying for untold  ages in the earth was part of a living forest grass  hoppers crickets and cockroaches were already creep  ing leaping and chirping in the dense jungle of ferns  and reeds where they left the remains of their bodies  among the decaying plants so that we find traces of  them now in our coalmines From that time till  now they have struggled on and while the crickets  have learnt to burrow long tunnels underground to  hide themselves in and have homes in the cracks of  walls and in company with the cockroaches in the  nooks by our firesides the locusts and the grass  hoppers have contented themselves with the open  fields and protection of the trees  When all the birds are faint with the hot sun  And hide in cooling trees a voice will run  From hedge to hedge about the newmown mead  That is the grasshoppers he takes the lead  In summer luxury he has never done  With his delight for when tired out with fun  He rests at ease beneath some pleasant weed  Let us look closely at him Fig 72 for he is so  large that he will help us to understand the general  structure of a sixlegged insect better than we could  have seen it in the tiny bugs  We see at once under his wings that he has a  ringed body like the prawn but his head is separate  from his shoulders and carries only one pair of  antennae while the prawn has two His mouth with  its two little palpi sticking out is strong and power  ful and is made of six parts an upper and lower  lip with a pair of biting jaws within them which  g Very young grasshopper g the same older straggling out of its  skin G Fullgrown female grasshopper laying her eggs in the earth  o Her ovipositor or egg laying sheath s one of the spiracles or  breathingholes  move to and fro sideways to hold and cut their food  and within these again are a pair of chewing jaws to  masticate it These six parts however much they  may be altered we shall find in all sixlegged insects  and whether for piercing sucking or gnawing they  are powerful implements  Next behind the head of the grasshopper cones  his chest or thorax formed of three rings each of  which bears a pair of legs and the two hinder ones  two pairs of wings while the shoulders are covered by  a shield Behind this again comes the ringed abdomen  which he can curve and bend at will Now on looking  carefully along the sides of these rings you will see a  dark spot s on each and a magnifying glass will  show that this spot is a round plate with a slit in the  middle s Fig  73 These are  the breathing  holes or spiracles  of the grasshop  per and if you  S Spiracle or breathingplate s Fig 72 were to Cut his  with the slit in the centre which opens to take body Open under  in air  T Part of the breathingtubes or trachea water you would  showing the spiral thread which keeps the see hundreds of  tubes in their round shape minute glistening  tubes called trachea T Fig 73 running in all  directions and ending in larger tubes each of which  is joined to one of these breathing holes These  tubes are formed of two layers between which is  wound round and round a stiff wiry thread see Fig  73 which keeps the tube in shape just like the spiral  wire which they put into indiarubber tubing The  glistening is caused by the air which has been taken  in at the breathing holes and fills all the tubes  If instead of cutting open the grasshopper you  keep him alive under a glass you may watch his  abdomen moving up and down and pumping the air  in at the slits and that air will pass all through his  body along these infinitely fine branching canals  Here we have the secret why insects leap and  fly and run so easily Think how beautifully light  a body must be which instead of containing solid  flesh is full of channels of air Lyonnet counted  1572 tubes in a caterpillars body and even then  left many smaller ones unnoticed while some  insects such as the bee and the grasshopper have  not only airtubes but actual bladders of air filling  large spaces in the body Nor is it only lightness  which insects gain by this network of air tubes  for their blood being bathed in air is always full of  oxygen and therefore active and vigorous supplying  their nerves and muscles with strength quite beyond  what we should expect for their size and helping us  to understand why they have been so successful in  the battle of life  So the grasshopper with his large fixed eyes with  many hundred windows in them for structure see p  224 his delicate feelers his strong jaws his long  muscular hind legs and his light body is an active  powerful insect and an especially greedy feeder  Indeed he has between his throat and his stomach  an apparatus called a gizzard with more than 200  teeth in it for grinding the food which he has stripped  off the bushes and meadows with his cutting jaws  Even our little grasshoppers in the meadows and the  large green grasshopper living in the trees devour  greedily all that comes in their way but their ravages  are as nothing compared with those of the large  migratory locusts with short antennae which multiply  at an incredible rate in favourable seasons and move  in swarms over the south of Europe darkening the  sky for miles and devouring every green thing upon  their road  Onward they come a dark continuous cloud  Of congregated myriads numberless  The rushing of whose wings is as the sound  Of a broad river headlong in its course  Plunged from a mountain summit or the roar  Of a wild ocean in the autumn storm  Shattering its billows on a shore of rocks  and as they move they leave desolation behind them  Every leaf on tree and bush every blade of grass  every ear of corn vanishes under their attacks In  I 866 in Algeria they not only destroyed the vege  tables figtrees vines and olives but fell into the  canals and brooks in such numbers that the stench  became horrible and the French troops were called  out to destroy them and collect their bodies in heaps  to burn them and similar locust plagues cause great  devastation in America  These locusts put their eggs into the earth and  cover them up and the young locusts come out ready  at once to begin eating and exactly like the mother  only without wings which appear later when the last  loose skin is cast off Our little green grasshoppers  are locusts with short antennae and drop their eggs  in this way but crickets and true grasshoppers of  which our large green grasshopper Fig 72 is one  have a very curious and interesting implement for  laying their eggs in the earth safe from harm The  mother has a pointed egglaying sheath or ovipositor  o Fig 72 at the end of her body made of several  thin plates touching at the edges and with this she  bores a hole in the ground and then opening the  sheath drops egg after Ggg in to lie till next spring  INSECT SUCKERS AND BITERS 215  when they are hatched if they escape being devoured  by underground creatures Then as each mother has  perhaps laid between two or three hundred eggs it  is not surprising that the ground and bushes are  covered with tiny grasshoppers leaping and feeding  but without wings At this time they will all be  silent and as they go on growing will cast skin  after skin till when the sixth skin is being thrown  off g t Fig 72 their wings appear and then the  young male grasshoppers begin to rub their front  leathery wings sharply against each other so that  from their base where they have a talc like plate  with strong ridges upon it that shrill cry arises by  which they call to their friends  The crickets on the other hand will not be seen  in the daytime for they hide in holes in the ground  till night falls and then come out for food and  enjoyment The only way to entice one out by day  is to tickle the hole with a straw when they will  seize it and so can be pulled out  In the same way the house cricket hides in its  hole behind the oven where it first came from the  egg and only ventures out to leap and fly about the  kitchen at night when it steals the breadcrumbs and  flour and sips the milk and beer Often it will begin  its chirp long before it comes out and   On a lone winters evening when the frost  Has wrought a silence from the stove there thrills  The crickets song  for the warmth keeps him awake and alive But if  you leave the room through the winter without fire  then he will sleep in the cracks of the chimney till  the warm weather comes back  All these are leaping straightwinged insects  and like the plantlice they feed on vegetable food  But the cockroach which is not a black beetle as  people call it nor a beetle at all but one of the  Cockroaches  straightwinged insects has its legs formed for run  ning instead of leaping and eats all kinds of food  whether animal or vegetable not even sparing our  dishcloths if they have any grease upon them  Though we have most of us had cockroaches at one  time or another in our houses few people know any  thing of their history of the fact that the mother  has only imperfect wings while the father can fly  about or that when a cockroach changes its skin it  comes out white and soft and is some time before it  regains its dark reddish brown colour Nor is it  likely that many people will have found the curious  little horny cases of eggs c Fig 74 shaped some  thing like a bean and divided inside into separate  compartments which the mother carries about with  her half out of her body till the eggs are nearly  hatched when she hides it in the cracks of the boards  and mortar of the ovens These cases contain about  sixteen eggs ranged neatly in two rows and the  edges of the case are strongly cemented together  As soon as the eggs are hatched the young  cockroaches give out a fluid which loosens the  cement and they come out into the world small  wriggling creatures j Fig 74 with all the rings  of their body conspicuous because their wings are  not yet grown  But above all few people probably would give  cockroaches credit for being intelligent animals and  yet an escape of cockroaches which happened in the  house of a friend of mine shows them to be more clever  than is generally supposed The house being infested  with these anrmals the cook laid a trap to catch them  made of a box with two strips of glass sloping in  wards from the sides and it happened that the edges  were only about an inch from the bottom of the  inside of the box In this trap she caught many  cockroaches for after getting in they could not mount  on the glass again to get out But one evening  having noticed that the trap was nearly full before  she went to bed she was surprised in the morning to  find that all the bait was eaten and every single  insect had escaped This happened several nights  and at last she resolved to watch On doing so she  saw one of the larger cockroaches stand upon his  tail and so reach up with his front feet to the edge  of the glass and then all the other cockroaches ran  up his back out of the box he dragging himself up  last and escaping with the rest In the open country  cockroaches have many enemies which keep them in  check birds and hedgehogs devour them and bees  ants and wasps especially the sandwasps hunt them  down but in our houses nothing but cleanliness and  killing every one we meet with can rid us of this  terrible pest  And now we must pass over the other straight  winged insects the Earwig which uses its pincers to  fold its wings neatly under its wing cases and watches  over its eggs with a mothers care the Mantis or  snatching insect which in warm countries creeps along  the branches of trees with its forelegs up as if pray  ing but really in readiness to snatch any passing fly  or insect and the Leaf and Stick insects which feed  on green leaves and are protected from the birds by  looking so exactly like the leaves and stems of the  trees they crawl upon that you may touch them  without dreaming that they are living animals All  these are wonderful examples of the tricks which life  has taught to her children for protection and attack  but with the exception of the earwig the creatures  employing them belong to other countries than ours  and we cannot dwell upon them for we must turn to  another group the nervewinged insects 5 which we  meet with every day and whose history is perhaps one  of the strangest among insects  In the time of those ancient coalforests of which we  have spoken when the grasshoppers and cockroaches  lived upon the land another race of insects belonging  half to the water and half to the air were spending  their youth in the ponds and marshes and hovering  over them in their riper age These were the ances  tors of our Mayflies and dragonflies and from that  day to this they have kept up this strange existence  hunting and chasing their prey at the bottom of  ponds until the time comes for their wings to grow  and then climbing up the waterplants and bursting  forth into glorious winged animals which   To the sun their insect wings unfold  Waft on the breeze or sink in clouds of gold  Transparent forms too fine for mortal sight  Their fluid bodies half dissolved in light  Every one who has been on a warm summers day  near the borders of a lake or pond must have seen  those delicate and fragile flies called Mayflies mf  Fig 75 which dance in the sunshine flag as the sun  goes down and die in the night They are not difficult  to know with their widespread unequal wings their  short delicate antennae and their bodies ending in  three long fine bristles and they do nothing but rise  and fall in and out in a mazy dance for they have  but a few hours to live and their mouths are too soft  for them to take food In fact the whole end and  aim of their winged life is to form and lay eggs in  little packets on the water to hatch into future young  ones And yet they are not really mere creatures  of a day as they have been called for before they  obtained their wings they lived for nearly two years  at the bottom of the pond over which they now fly  Their real life is that of a waterinsect ing which  as soon as the eggs are hatched dives to the bottom  of the pond and burrows in the ground or under  stones and feeds upon all passing insects seizing  them with strong spiny jaws and devouring them  greedily At this time the May grub does not  breathe through holes in the side but has its body  fringed with gills or delicate folds of skin which take  in air out of the water and there is nothing in its  appearance to lead any one to believe that it could  ever live in the air But as it grows up and loses one  loose skin after another the rudiments of wings are  seen through the transparent covering and then the  end of its life is beginning It creeps out upon some  plant or stone overhanging the water the skin cracks  down the back and the flying insect comes out with  its wings perfectly visible Still it cannot use them  for a fine film covers the whole body and it is only  a few hours after when this has dried and split that  the perfect Mayfly soars away an airbreathing insect  to lay its eggs and die  We need not then pity these frail delicate eph  emera on account of their short life for they have  had a long and merry one feeding in the pond below  and when we see them they are taking their last  enjoyment before night falls  The same thing is true of the caddisflies or water  moths cf Fig 75 which anglers use as bait for  they too cannot feed after they get their wings but  their life in the pool below has been rather different  Their tail is soft like that of the hermitcrab and they  need to liide it in some strong covering And for  this purpose they build themselves tubes of silk into  which they weave pieces of wood and grass or of  sand and stone and even sometimes shells with living  creatures in them and dragging these tubes about vith  them they put out their strong head and shoulders  and feed on plants and insects Then when the time  comes for their change they draw back into their case  and closing it with a grating of silk at each end so  that water can get in while enemies are shut out  they lie still for a fortnight like a caterpillar in its  chrysalis and then swim out and creeping up some  plant burst their covering skin and hover over the  pond or rest upon the bushes till their eggs are laid  and they die  Thus the Mayfly and Caddisfly live chiefly in  the water finding plenty of food during all their  growing time while they have but a short glimpse  of the pleasures of the air Not so however the  gorgeouswinged Dragonfly He manages to make  the most of both worlds and whether he is crawling  in the water below or flying in the air above is one  of the most voracious and bloodthirsty of insects  Even when he is a watergrub though he moves  very slowly yet the quickest of insects cannot escape  from him for he has a peculiar under lip in Fig 76  very long and with two sharp hooks at its broad  end with which he seizes them This lip folds back  by a kind of hinge and is called a mask because  it covers the lower part of his face and makes  him look an innocent and harmless creature The  moment an insect comes by the lip is shot out and  the pincers grasp the prey throwing it into his mouth  as the mask again closes So gliding stealthily  along the bottom the greedy creature seizes all that  comes in his way grubs worms waterslugs and  even small fish are all attacked by him and though he  is sometimes devoured in his turn by other animals  yet he often escapes for he breathes by taking in  water at his tail and when he wishes to get out of  the way he shoots this water out and drives himself  along much as we saw the octopus do only that the  dragonfly grub goes forwards instead of backwards  So in a year he grows big and strong and short  wings begin to appear under his skin Then he  crawls listlessly to the top of a plant and there  dragging himself out of his covering he gradu  ally expands his large gauze wings filled with  delicate air channels and shaking free his sharp  clawed feet is at once ready for new victims His  large gleaming eyes with their thousands of windows  often 12000 each with its  own i ens an d cone and rod  see Fig 77 espy a butterfly  or a moth and in an instant  he is pursuing it flying  upwards downwards and  sideways without turning  by means of the peculiar  muscles by which his wings  work upon his bulky shoul  Section of an Insects Eye ders while his long body  a Nervemass of the eye b serves as a rudder And  nerves springing from it c when he hag caug h t his prey  the retina d threadlike rods r J  by which the picture is formed he tears it savagely with  e glasslike cones lenslike n j s horny jaws scattering  facets of which each eye may  have from 10000 to 20000 lts shattered wings upon  the ground Much as we  admire the beautiful colours and magnificent wings of  the dragonfly we must admit that when he reckons  back his ancestors through the dim ages to those  distant coalforests he must look along a line of the  most greedy and cruel marauders of the insect world  Nor has he been content with ravaging the  water and the air only for one of his very near  relations the antlion JVfyrmeleon formicarius  which is to be found in France and most warm coun  tries and which when it has its wings might be  mistaken for a dragonfly lives its early life in dry  sand in which it twists round and round till it has  made a funnelshaped hole at the bottom of which  it lies see plate p 135 This it does near an ants  nest and when an ant running on the edge of the  funnel slips in the antlion flings sand upon it so  that it tumbles to the bottom and he can devour it  Thus in the water on the land and in the air the  dragonflies have a good time of it if they can only  escape the swallows and other quick flying birds  which pounce down upon them and the scorpion  flies which though much smaller than themselves  sting them to death  And now we come to the most interesting of  all the nervewinged animals the Termites or white  ants the plagues of India and Africa Every one  has heard of these destructive creatures which feed  so cunningly out of sight eating their way from the  ground beneath up the middle of posts beams  woodwork and furniture and even sometimes prop  ping up with hardened mud and slime the build  ings they are eating away so that no one finds  them out till all at once some part falls down and  exposes the rottenness within They are so clever  and have so many habits like true ants that they  have been called by their name and most people  think that they are their near relations But this is  not so on the contrary while the ants stand at the  head of the most highly developed insects and have  a helpless infancy and a true chrysalis state before  they are fit for work the termites have come along  quite a different line and belong to those ancient  nervewinged insects which work from their earliest  age and have no time of rest to prepare for their  grownup life So when we find these white  ants living together and building houses and having  workmen and soldiers besides the true king and   Termes bdlicosus  queen of the nation we see that they must have  learned these habits quite independently of the true  ants with which they have nothing to do  A strange and wonderful thing a termite com  munity is Perhaps in India you find one day that  the sill of your window or the post of your door  is rotten and then when you begin to cut it you  find it completely hollowed out into little cham  bers the wood being eaten away At first these  chambers are empty but as you go on you find  small soft white insects with six feet running hither  and thither These insects are quite blind and  wingless and always work in the dark Even if  they come out on the surface of the wall or the  ground they cement wooddust together or carry up  clay to make a tunnel under cover of which they  travel up and down In a single night a tube may  appear all up your wall which is a termite tunnel  built to enable the insects to reach some fresh store  of woodwork If you watch you may see the tunnel  grow at its open end as one little white grub after  another comes to the opening and laying on its little  bit of mudwork goes back to make room for the  next Mingled with these workers are much larger  insects also blind and wingless with huge heads and  jaws shaped like jagged stilettoes These are the  soldiers they do not work but defend the labourers  hanging on to any enemy with their sharp pincers  and allowing themselves to be torn to pieces rather  than give way  And now as you penetrate farther and farther  through the woodwork and probably down into the  ground belcw the small chambers begin to be filled  with little white eggs and with snowwhite young  workers and soldiers which feed on a kind of mouldy  fungus growing on the walls of their rooms At last  in the midst of these you come upon a large cell with  a long soft whitishbrown lump in it as big as your  finger and looking something like an uncooked  sausage Figs 78 and 79 At first you would  think this was a mere bag but looking at one end  you would see three rings each with a pair of legs  and a head if Fig 79 with eyes and feelers and  mouth This white lump then is part of a living  creature it is the abdomen of a termite queen  swollen to nearly 2000 times its natural size and  full of eggs There she lies with her husband k y  Fig 78 who is much bigger even than the soldiers  but nothing as compared to his queen crouching by  her side and while the working termites feed her and  caress her she goes on laying eggs incessantly about  60 a minute These the workers carry away as fast  as she lays them and store them in the nursery  chambers around but the holes through which they  pass out of the queens cell o Fig 79 are far too  small for either of the royal pair to escape  The history of this curious community has been  as follows About two years ago before the heavy  autumn rains began this king and queen with thou  sands of others were born from the eggs of another  huge queen and when they had cast their skin  they came out each with four gauzy wings and flew  into the country or often into the houses if their  nest was in a town But their bodies were heavy  and their wings weak and so they soon fell to the  ground where nearly all their companions were eaten  by birds and ants and other creatures They how  ever chanced to escape and losing their wings were  found by a party of working termites At once these  active wingless workers carried the royal pair into  their tunnel and built a clay chamber round them  with only small openings in it Fig 79 not large  enough for them to get out There they fed them  carefully and by and by the abdomen of the queen  began to swell and from that time her whole mission  was to lay eggs As her size increased the workers  enlarged her chamber and meanwhile were toiling  busily making nurseries for the eggs and storehouses  for the shavings of wood and masses of vegetable  gum which they collected by burrowing in every  direction through living trees or beams or wood  work of any kind  You may imagine how many nurseries must be  built besides new rooms for grownup workers if  80000 eggs are laid every iay and besides these  nurseries there are innumerable galleries and passages  which are all so arranged that air passes through the  whole building The work goes on in perfect order  some tend the queen and all show her the utmost  attention and affection some store the eggs some  look after the young while others enlarge the build  ing or tunnel for long distances underground to get  food And all this is done by blind workers in pitch  darkness with a regularity and precision which is  most marvellous and can probably only be accounted  for by the supposition that their antennae are far more  delicate and useful implements than we can as yet  understand  There are many species of these Termites Some  live in buildings and the town of La Rochelle in  France where they have probably been brought from  the West Indies has been sadly damaged by them  Others in Africa build enormous mounds of clay and  earth see Fig 78 as much as from twelve to twenty  feet high and so strong that the buffaloes stand  upon them to look over the plains and inside these  are innumerable galleries and floors of storehouses  and nurseries If an attempt is made to destroy  these mounds the soldier termites which are about  one in a hundred as compared to the workers swarm  out and fall upon the enemy while the workers begin at  once to repair the damage Other species build nests  in tall trees driven there no doubt to escape from the  true ants which having hard bodies can attack the  soft termites and destroy them easily Lastly there  are some which come above ground and march from  place to place like a regular army and these are the  most remarkable for not only have the soldiers and  workers eyes so that they see their way but Smeath  man who studied them in Africa saw the workers  marching in regular streams or columns twelve or  fifteen abreast guarded by the soldiers while sentinels  were placed on plants along the road These  soldiers struck the leaves every now and then with  their jaws making a ticking noise to which the  workers answered with a hiss and then quickened  their pace  And here we must end our history There is pro  bably nothing more curious in the whole insect world  than the termite communities for these children  of Life have learnt lessons far above any of their  near relations while the necessity of preparing for  and tending the eggs which the queens lay at such a  prodigious rate makes the whole nest a constant  scene of activity and contrivance The study of  their habits and customs is one of the greatest  possible interest but here we must content ourselves  with a mere general glimpse and with establish  ing firmly in our minds the fact that the white  ants of India and Africa are quite a different race  and beloig to a totally different order of insects  from their darker namesakes in England They  belong to the nerve winged insects and together  with all those included in this chapter they are born  in the same shape as their parents only without wings  For we shall notice that the aphides and the  bugs the grasshoppers and cockroaches the may  flies and dragon flies as well as the termites change  their coats as they grow too small for them creeping  out of their skins many times in their lives But  they do not change their bodies as we shall see in  the next chapter is done by the caterpillars and  butterflies Neither have they with the exception of  the caddisflies any time of trance as the caterpillar  has in its chrysalis They are active from birth to  death and though when their time for laying eggs  comes they put forth wings to carry them to their  mates and to suitable spots for laying still they have  not yet fallen upon the expedient of taking a time  of rest and forming a new and beautiful body  CHAPTER XL  INSECT SIPPERS AND GNAWERS WHICH REMODEL  THEIR BODIES WITHIN THEIR COATS  And many an antenatal tomb  Where butterflies dream of the life to come  She left clinging round the smooth and dark  Edge of the odorous cedar bark  THE SENSITIVE PLANT  MONG all the strange and  puzzling facts in the history  of living things there is per  haps none which has at  tracted so much attention as the  complete metamorphosis or change  in the bodies of insects by means  of which a creature begins its life  in one form then hangs itself up  in a hard skin or a silken shroud  or buries itself out of sight and  comes out at last so totally differ  ent in appearance that if we had  not watched it passing from the one  shape to the other we could never  have believed it to be the same creature  Who would believe at first sight that a butterfly  or moth had once been a creeping caterpillar or  that the hurrying busy beetle and the active fly had  burrowed as maggots or grubs in decaying matter or  in the trunks of trees or in the fruits and flowers of  plants or still less that each active hopping flea  once rolled about helplessly as a little hairy grub  and span a tiny silk cocoon in which its present  body was formed  To those who have only paid attention to the  higher animals such as birds fishes and quadrupeds  which when they are born have already assumed a  fairly settled form this springing up of one being  out of the husk of another apparently quite unlike it  seems strange and unnatural and in olden times all  kinds of fanciful ideas were connected with the  metamorphosis of insects But if we begin as we  have now done by Lifes simplest children and see  how in each successive group the necessity for  making the best of everything causes many creatures  to alter their form and habits at different periods of  their lives then these curious changes in insects have  a real meaning and we can set to work patiently in  the hope of discovering what advantage they are to  the creature which undergoes them  Thus for example we have already found the  sponge beginning as a swimming animal see p 38  and then drawing in its lashes and settling down to  build a solid skeleton clothed with a colony of cells  while the lassothrowers begin by swimming go on  as stationary branching and budding animals and  end by throwing off eggbearing jellybells quite as  unlike the animal tree as a butterfly is unlike a  caterpillar In the starfish and seaurchins the  transformation scene is still more curious for the  jellyanimal is swimming about and feeding with its  special mouth and stomach see p 78 while a  second and differently shaped form with a mouth  and stomach and feet of its own is growing up  inside yet both these beings are part of one single  creature and when the form within is ready to get  its own living it swallows its earlier self and goes its  way So too the headless mollusca such as the oyster  and cockle swim about in their young life and have  eyes which they lose when they settle down while the  crab undergoes such complete changes see Fig 59  p 167 that no one would recognise parent and child  if they saw them together  We learn then that it is not the exception but  in many cases the rule for a creature to take on  different forms at different times of its life and the  chief novelty in the metamorphosis of insects turns  out to be that they have learnt to do one thing at a  time and after passing their early life in incessant  feeding and storing up of material for a more perfect  body they retire from the world to spend all their  energy in building up those new and beautiful bodies  which we admire so much in the lovely painted  butterfly or the gorgeous metallicwinged beetle  Nor shall we wonder that this quiet is necessary  when we understand the marvellous change which  takes place in them The cockroach and the cricket  only gain wings by their last change of skin and  though the Mayfly alters its apparatus for breathing  so as to be able to live in the air still the greater  part of its body remains the same But the cater  pillar and the grub have actually to remodel every  part of their bodies in order to become the butterfly  or the beetle and we can scarcely say that any  portion of them remains as it was except that  mysterious lifepower which brings to them from past  generations the experience to guide them in their  development and their work Yet so true is this  experience so well has the lesson been learnt by the  countless ancestors which have gone before that  among the thousands of different kinds of grub  and maggot and caterpillar each follows its own  peculiar road as its forefathers have done before it  and wrapping itself in its own special form of covering  goes through its curious change and comes out as  fly butterfly moth or beetle with those weapons  and ornaments which it needs for the rest of its  existence  Of all the marvels of life surely this is one of the  most marvellous and why or how each one puts on its  peculiar dress we can scarcely ever hope to know But  we may gain some slight idea of the general process  by which a creeping worm is changed into a winged  insect and to do this let us sketch out the life of  the common Tortoiseshell butterfly which Mr New  port watched through all its changes nearly fifty  years ago  It is under the fresh green shoots of the common  nettle that the tortoiseshell butterfly mother lays  her cluster of eggs in the early summer after she has  crept out of the crack in the wall or paling where  she had remained hidden for her long winter sleep  Coming out with worn wings and faded colours she  enjoys a short flight in the sunshine with others of  her kind and then leaves her eggs where the young  will find food and goes her way to die And in a  week or two when these eggs are hatched there creep  out little yellowishgrey caterpillars and these give  out at once a fine silken thread from their under lip  and spin a slight web over a leaf This done they  crawl away in company and travel from leaf to leaf  feeding busily all day but always returning to their  silken tent at night They have no thought beyond  eating as they move along on their ten cushion feet  two at the tail and four under the abdomen cf Figs  80 and 8 1 which are not true feet at all but foldings  in the skin each bearing a circle of spines which  help it to cling to the twigs Their six real jointed  feet f Fig 81 p 239 near the head they use  both for walking and for grasping the leaf while  they cut it with their horny mandibles or outer jaws  m Fig 80 which work horizontally between their  lips and then pass the pieces on to be chewed by the  real jaws within whose palpi or feelers are seen at  Thus they feed and feed alway guided probably  chiefly by touch and taste though they have tiny  simple eyes They do not need to pause for breath  since that is taken in through the holes in their  sides b Fig 81 and they eat so greedily that after  a time their skin becomes too tight for the food they  are packing into it Then they pause and turn pale  and remain still for a while after which each one  bends up his back swells out his rings and so splits  the inconvenient coat along the back Then drawing  out first his head and then his tail he comes out fresh  in colour with every joint and hair in its place and  begins gorging once more This they do as many  as five separate times and at the end of these  changes their new form is already growing within  them for if you cut open a caterpillar just before it  casts its last skin you may see the outline of the  wings and antennae of the future butterfly in a  watery state each in its transparent sheath  And now they must shut themselves up from the  outer world for each one has to make a sipping  mouth instead of a biting one and to gather up his  muscles to make his shoulders strong to bear his  wings and above all he has to draw together the  line of nerve knots which in the caterpillar are  stretched along his body as we saw them in the  leech p 143 but which in the butterfly must be  concentrated so as to make great central nerve  stations in the head for the use of the large eyes and  sensitive antennas which are coming and other sta  tions under the shoulders to supply his wings with  energy  So each caterpillar again leaves off eating and  finding some firm spot on the trunk of a tree or a  post or a stem of a plant makes there a little hillock  of silk and clinging to it by his hind feet lets him  self swing head downwards Fig 8 1 Then his head  and shoulders begin to swell the nervous knots within  his body to draw together the airtubes to expand  and the skin to crack so that by vigorous efforts he  can push his whole body covering back to his tail  where at last it drops off leaving him hanging by  some small hooks at the end of his body A curious  fellow he looks now as each part of the future butter  fly is dimly seen in its protecting sheath His tiny  wings his six true feet his antennae and his sipping  trunk have all begun to form but are far from com  plete and to keep them safe till they are full grown  a clear fluid oozes out and flows over all hardening  into a firm transparent case and as in some butterflies  the reflection of light from the under surface of this  case has a golden tint the name of chrysalis chrysos  gold has been given to the still and quiet form  but the word pupa doll is perhaps better because  many have not this golden hue  It is within this sheath that in about three weeks  the butterflys body is gradually formed and all the  fat which the caterpillar had stored in the spaces of  its body is worked up into muscle and nerve and  eggproducing parts At last all is complete the  head shoulders and abdomen have taken on their  real shape the delicate tinted scales which cover the  wings and deck them with gorgeous colours are  full grown the wings themselves made of two layers  of skin between which are the airtubes and the  veins presently to be filled with colourless blood are  all ready while the little pockets in the body which  make the fullgrown insect so much lighter than  the caterpillar are waiting to be expanded with air  The nerves begin to send messages to the limbs to  move and the perfect butterfly splitting its trans  parent covering creeps out into the world slowly but  surely inflates its body and wings and letting them  dry in the sun soars off to sip the flowers and find  a mate  But what a different creature we have here from  the creeping gnawing spinning caterpillar The two  lips of the caterpillar with the silkspinning tube sp  Fig 80 in the lower one are reduced to mere frag  ments the horny mandibles m m no longer needed  now the chief feeding time is past have almost dis  appeared while the two inner jaws are drawn out into  long hollow channels and fit together so as to form  the delicate tube which is to suck honey from the  flowers The tiny eyes e of the caterpillar if they  are still to be found in the forehead are quite in  significant when compared with two large many  windowed eyes e e which now stand out on each side  of the head to warn the rapidlyflying insect of danger  from all directions The tiny stunted antennae of the  caterpillar have become long and delicate The  shoulders grown firm and strong carry the six slender  legs and two pairs of wings which are worked by  powerful muscles and over these wings is spread a  carpet of beautiful scales each one fitting by means of  a little tube into the wing and the whole making a  brilliant pattern to attract the eyes of the mate  which the butterfly now wishes to find The abdomen  has lost on the outside the cushion feet which are no  longer needed while within the long digestive tube  which it had as a caterpillar has become quite small  making room for an apparatus for forming and laying  eggs  And yet though such a total remodelling has  taken place there has been no such thing as death  and new life between the caterpillar and the butterfly  Though the chrysalis hung in such a still and death  like form it was the same living insect breathing  almost imperceptibly and able to move slightly if  touched Only the life within it which in the first  stage was busy storing up material in the caterpillar  was entirely occupied during this second stage in  moulding that material into the future butterfly  which in the third stage as a perfect insect completes  the history  We see then that one of the great questions in  all creatures which remodel their bodies must be  how they can keep themselves from danger in this  second stage when they are so helpless Some go  through their changes quickly and then they are  comparatively careless of anything but to choose  a secluded spot Our tortoiseshell butterfly for  example hangs very insecurely by the slender thread  of her chrysalis But then she is generally but little  more than a fortnight or three weeks completing  her change and even when born in the autumn she  becomes a butterfly before the winter and goes to  sleep in this form hiding in the chinks of walls or  palings or in the bark of trees till the warm spring  comes round unless indeed some mild day in  January wakes her before her time when she gener  ally dies as the penalty for mistaking the season  But the common cabbage butterfly if born late  in the year often remains as a chrysalis from Sep  tember to April and would hang very unsafely  exposed to the rough winds if merely attached by  the tail So the caterpillars of this butterfly as of  many others bind themselves firmly to the paling or  wall by a narrow band of silk If you can catch  sight of this caterpillar just when beginning its  change you may see it first make a little tuft of silk  t Fig 82 in which it plants its tail and then  turning back its head pass the silk from its tip  across and across the body b so that by and by  when the skin is shed the chrysalis remains firmly  tied to the paling  One of these two ways of fastening themselves  are followed by almost all the caterpillars of butter  flies except a few which roll themselves in leaves or  bind themselves in slender webs But the moth  Fig 82  Caterpillar and Chrysalis of Cabbage Butterfly bound to a paling  t Tuft of silk holding the tail b b Silken band securing  the chrysalis  caterpillars are much more clever at hiding and in  many ways are more interesting than those of butter  flies  Naturalists are in the habit of dividing the Lepi  doptera or scale winged insects into moths and  butterflies and although there is no real distinction  between them yet in a general way it is not difficult  to tell them apart  A moth as a rule lays its wings down upon its  back when at rest while a butterfly folds them up  back to back against each other and though some  moths copy the butterflies in this they are not many  Again most butterflies have their antennae thick  at the tip while those of moths are more generally  fine at the end and thicker in the middle and are  often beautifully feathered but this rule also is not  without exceptions Again the wings of moths are  fastened together by a kind of hook which makes  them work much more strongly and not with the  irregular movement which we find in butterflies  lastly the shoulders of moths are broader than  those of most butterflies and less distinctly divided  by a waist from the abdomen By some of these  characters as well as in many cases by their noc  turnal habits moths may be generally known al  though it must be remembered that they are such  near relations to the butterflies that no clear line can  be drawn between the two  But in their habits and devices the moths far  outstrip the butterflies It is their caterpillars which  among the sphinx moths remain motionless for  hours on twigs with the head bent down so as  to look like part of the bush thus escaping the  notice of the birds which would eat them and of the  ichneumonflies which would lay their eggs on their  bodies And these same caterpillars when the time  of their rest comes burrow into the ground and line  their home with varnished silk so that no water can  creep in Here safe and sound from wet and cold  they cast off their skin for the last time and lie as  pupae during the long winter till the warmth of June  wakes them into moth life  It is the caterpillars of moths too which spin  those silken cocoons which hang from tree or bush  or under walls and palings homes so delicate and  yet so dry and snug that the tender pupa lying  freely inside them is like a child in its warm bed at  night Any one who has kept silkworms will  know how cleverly the caterpillar bending its head  back towards its tail so that its feet are outside  begins its outer eggshaped layer of silk by moving  its head to and fro in some nook or corner and  leaving a bed of fluff within which it spins the coil  of finer silk You may watch the cocoon growing  for a time as the caterpillars head moves round  and round in an oval form leaving its silken trail  behind it But gradually the meshes grow finer and  finer and you can no longer see through them while  still the industrious creature goes on till its head has  been round the oval at least three hundred thousand  times and it has made a stout cocoon  Once safe inside its silken house it pushes off its  caterpillar skin and remains a protected pupa for a  fortnight or more Then if you have not already  robbed it of its silk the moth after it has crept out  of the pupa skin must work its way through the  cocoon This it does by giving out a liquid which  is contained in a little bladder in its head and  soaking the silken wall so as to separate the threads  and make a path for itself to the outer air But  curiously enough it will not attempt to fly far for the  silkworm moth belonging as it does to a genus  already feeble in flight and having besides been  kept in confinement for generation after generation  makes scarcely any use of its wings  Out of just such cocoons as this but of coarser  make with a tiny hole left at one end come the  beautiful emperormoth the night peacock and the  curious Oakeggar moth whose caterpillar sleeps  all through the autumn and winter before beginning  to feed and spin its cocoon while the Burnet moths  Fig 83 often spin very thin cocoons covered with  a kind of varnish which makes them as strong as  parchment With a little trouble you may often find  the empty cases of these and other moths left on the  grass and bushes in July and August when the insects  are fluttering over the gardens and fields But the  cocoons of the Processionmoths which climb the  oaktrees at night to feed you will find all enclosed  in one large nest of silk for these caterpillars live  in companies in a hanging web and when they are  ready to remodel  their bodies they  strengthen the web  with their moulted  skins and lie all  together each spin  ning his tiny cocoon  round his body  Again there are  many caterpillars  which have not suf  ficient silk to spin  a whole cocoon and  they have learnt  other devices Thus  some of the sphinx  caterpillars make  cocoons of dried  leaves woven to Psyche graminella  Cther and lined g Front part of the caterpillar with the  Infli cilt anH rnllrl six true feet C Case f Straw and S raSS  with silk and rolled covering the rest of the caterp iiiar and in  Up in these they lie which it will hide as a chrysalis m perfect  under the cover of moth  some stone or bush The hairy caterpillars also many  of them use their hairs for the cocoons binding them  together with a little silk while a group of moths  called Psyches Fig 84 because they are so small and  light come from caterpillars which as soon as they are  born take pieces of straw or leaf or grass and bind  them together into cases in which they live feeding  under cover of the little house which they enlarge  from time to time and use later on to shelter their  chrysalis It is worth noticing that these cater  pillars living in a case do not need broad falsefeet  to clasp the stems so these are reduced to quite small  cushions with a ring of strong hooks to hold fast  to the case Then there are the leafrolling cater  pillars which twist up the margins of leaves and use  their silk to bind them into tubes for their resting  places while the huge caterpillar of the Goatmoth  gnaws its way into the old trunks of willows and  elms and after feeding and tunneling there for three  years creeps just under the bark and gums together  a cocoon of powdered wood lined with soft silk in  which it lies safe and snug till transformed into the  large and beautiful moth  It would require a whole volume to trace out the  many devices of the mothcaterpillars to escape their  enemies and to find shelter from wind and weather  during their retreat from the world in some cases of  weeks and in others of many months But with  the exception of the Goatmoth all those of which  we have spoken feed openly as long as they are  caterpillars on the leaves of trees and plants and  have no special means beyond their green or brown  colour or sometimes their nauseous flavour for elud  ing their persecutors It remained for the tiny Leaf  miners to find out the plan of living between the  two sides of a leaf and so eating their way peacefully  in covered galleries These little caterpillars coming  out of their eggs on the under side of a roseleaf or  honeysuckle leaf bore at once into it and creep  along eating the flesh of the leaf between the two  surfaces till they are full fed and then they pierce  through the upper skin and creeping out spin those  curious little orange cocoons which you may find in  the summer clinging to the stems of roses If you  haveonce looked for the tracks of these tiny insectsyou  may easily find them  showing as pale wavy  lines on the honey  suckle and other leaves  So you may also  trace lines something  of the same kind but  more unpleasant in  our eyes on our own  woollen clothes which  have been laid by for  the summer These  are made by cater  pillars of the same  family as the leaf   J L The ClothesMoth  miners but as there are   g Grub feeding in its woollen tube  no covering skins here t nake d grab taken out of the  between which they can tube pupa hanging in the tube  lie the clever little fel m moth  lows build tubes for themselves t Fig 85 out of the  wool which they tear off the clothes They live in  these just as the Psyche caterpillars live in the grass  tubes and when they are going to remodel their bodies  they close one end of the tube and fasten it to the  side of the box or cupboard p Fig 8 and then  turning themselves with their head to the open end  are ready to come out when they have developed  into those little grey moths we know but too well  And here we must leave the butterflies and moths  without touching upon those mothcaterpillars which  live in the water or those which steal the honey from  the bees or the tiny butterflycaterpillars which live in  the clover and grass and whose eggs we tread upon  as we walk Each little butterfly or moth which we  watch gamboling in the sunshine or disturb from its  sleep in the hedges or on the mosscovered walls has  its own habits and history its favourite plant on which  it feeds and to which its caterpillar feet are often spe  cially adapted its time for flying and for resting its  special hidingplaces for its pupa and its own lovely  markings on the wings which when open attract its  mates and when closed often shelter it by making it  look like the plants upon which it alights while many  moths which fly at night have even a peculiar scent  by which they find each other in the dark And one  and all have their object in life the male butterflies  to find a mate and the mothers to find the plant on  which they themselves fed as caterpillars there to lay  their eggs Moreover they are unconsciously doing  useful work for as they pass from flower to flower  sipping the honey they carry the pollen dust on  their bodies and fertilise the lovely blossoms which  enliven our fields and hedges and in so doing help  to make the seeds which grow up into fresh plants  for those which come after them  But as these delicate children of Life flutter  through the world innumerable dangers meet them  on their way as caterpillars pupae and butterflies  hundreds are destroyed by birds and by other insects  while the pitiless wind and soaking rain of our English  summers often batter their tender wings before they  can creep under shelter In this respect they are far  worse off than our next group the Beetles which are  gnawing insects during both the active seasons of their  life and whose front wings are not used in flying but  form those beautiful sheaths called elytra 7 which so  often make these insects look like brilliant jewels  These elytra in many beetles are very hard and  strong and serve to cover up safely the pair of large  transparent hind wings which are used in flying  There can scarcely be any doubt that the beetles  are especially well provided with weapons for fighting  the battle of life for they have not only managed to  spread into every country on the globe but are by  far the most numerous of all insects From the huge  Goliath beetle of Africa five inches long down to the  minute rove beetles which give such sharp pricks  when they fly into our eyes on summer evenings  beetles are of all sizes and live in almost all con  ceivable ways While many feed on plants others  are fierce hunters and even cannibals devouring  each other in the most cruel manner while a very  large number feed on dead and decaying matter and  are most useful scavengers and not a few feed on  animals when young and plants after they awake  from their long sleep For beetles like butterflies  have three lives first as grubs or maggots secondly  as helpless pupae or swaddled insects and it is only  when they come to the third stage that they are true  beetles with wings and the power of laying eggs  The cockchafer or Maybug which blunders up  against us as he flies heavily in the night air began  his life underground more than three years ago  His mother groping down into the earth in the early  spring hid herself there and laid from thirty to forty  eggs which at the end of about five weeks were  hatched and became blind white grubs g Fig 86  with six slender black legs and hard horny jaws  After a short time these grubs set to work to gnaw  the tender roots of the young summer plants and  during the next three years fed vigorously under  ground eating first what was near them and then  making galleries in all directions and devouring the  roots of strawberry plants or rosetrees oats or corn or  clover till many were devoured themselves by moles  and hedgehogs or if they ventured too near the  surface of the ground by rooks crows and magpies  which sit upon the clods and pick them out of the  loose ground Those which escaped and they are  usually many burrowed down deep in the winter  out of the way of frost and wet to come up agan  in the spring to feed afresh But at the end of the  third year after having shed their skins several times  they laid themselves down to rest in the earth and  giving out a kind of sticky froth which they bound  with threads of silk into a cocoon c Fig 86 they  split their last grub skin and remained as pupae or  swaddled insects with their imperfect wings  folded over their legs and antennae Then early in  the fourth year about April the true cockchafer  began to stir in the cocoon and crept out of the  ground hungry with its long fast and flying up to  the trees began to gnaw and eat for the short two  months remaining of its life and it is then that we  meet with it flying from tree to tree and browsing  with its strong mandibles on the leaves of the oaks  and beeches and maples  The history of the cockchafer is that also of many  other beetles The grubs of the beautiful golden  green rosebeetle and many others live underground  feeding on the roots of plants and the great stag  beetle whose sharp jaws as a grub enable him to  eat into solid wood only makes this difference that  he spends his three or sometimes even six years of  childhood in the trunk of an old oaktree gnawing  away at it for his daily meal and only sees day  light when he eats his way out as the perfect beetle  But the little weevils with their curious snouts  Fig 87 which they use for piercing holes in which  to place their eggs love best the centre of flowers or  tender leaves or especially fruits and nuts of various  kinds for their nursery When we crack a nut and  find a fat white maggot inside we have disturbed  the forerunner of one of these little weevils which  if the nut had remained on the tree would by and  by have worked its way out m Fig 87 and fallen  to the ground where it would have gone to sleep all  through the winter to wake with a long thin snout  and a pair of delicate wings hidden under its beauti  ful brown wingcases The peamaggot on the other  hand would if we had left it alone have lain down  just within the delicate skin of the pea and there  been transformed into a tiny brown beetle spotted  with white  Many of the weevils do indeed eat the bark and  wood and roots of trees for they are a very numerous  family and must find food where they can but the  greater number of them feed on fruits buds flowers  and grains of all kinds so that you need only hunt  among the acorns and wheat and rape and turnips  to make acquaintance with these tiny beetles or if  you seek out the faded dingy brown blossoms on  an appletree which remain when the other bright  blossoms are turning into fruit there you may find  either a tiny chrysalis or a short snouted weevil  which has lived all its life in this blossom since its  mother laid the egg in the early spring and whose  food as a maggot has been the tender centre of the  flower  These are all plant eating beetles and they or  some of their comrades may be found on every plant  or tree nay you may even shake a shower of them  out of the folds of a large mushroom though they  are so small you must get a microscope to see them  But the Tigerbeetle with its brilliant golden green  wingcases the Bombardier beetle see Plate II  p 135 which shoots out a vapour from its tail  when it is attacked the common garden beetle or  Carabus which pours a black fluid on your fingers  when you catch it and even the delicate little Lady  bird which is a true beetle are all animal feeders  and they destroy a whole host of insects such  as aphides caterpillars weevils cockchafers centi  pedes and flies The young wingless ladybird  creeps after the aphides eating them one by one  up the stem as we saw the blind grub of the fly  doing in Fig 69 while the grubs of the tigerbeetle  have a most cunning way of catching their food for  they bury themselves in the soil with their mouths  just above the ground so that the ants and small  insects run heedlessly into their jaws  These and many other beetles feed greedily upon  living creatures and are quite as eager hunters of  small animals as lions and tigers are among large  ones You need only watch the ugly cocktail beetle  Plate II p 135 scampering after some insect or seiz  ing upon one of its weaker brethren as it cocks up its  head and tail and snaps its sharp jaws to understand  how aggressive these creatures can be Among the  waterbeetles too though some such as the black  water beetle are vegetarians yet many are most  voracious and c ucl the true waterbeetlef Fig 88  which dives and swims so powerfully with its broad  hind legs and carries air under its closed wingcases  is one of the most greedy of water animals both as a  grub and beetle Not only does it devour the gruds  of mayflies dragonflies and other pond insects  but it feeds on snails tadpoles and fish taking  care however to burrow deep in the earth out of  the way when its helpless season comes lest some  of these creatures should return the compliment  This beetle is strong and powerful and looks like  a dangerous enemy but who would think that the  tiny bronzecoloured vhirligig beetles t which look so  bright as they dance on the top of the pond are  also voracious insect feeders Watch a group of  these bewildering little animals carefully and you  will see one here and one there dart up to catch  a passing fly or down rapidly to seize some  tiny water insect or to escape an enemy that is  approaching For in fact these beetles have an  unfair advantage in life having each of their eyes  divided in two parts one half looking down into the  pond below and the other half up into the air so  that they can literally keep half an eye upon any  suspicious creature in either element Theirs is a  life of many experiences for after beginning their  existence on the surface of waterplants where the  mother places the eggs they dive down as grubs to  the bottom of the pond breathing by hairy gills and  leaping actively here and there by four curious little  hooks on their tails feeding vigorously all the while  then they creep up into the air and spinning fine  cocoons upon the leaves of a waterplant remodel  their bodies and finally as tiny beetles they lead a  giddy life on the pondsurface darting here and  there as fancy guides them  But quick as these and many other water and  land beetles are both in catching and escaping other  animals it is a curious fact that it is among the  scavenger and filthfeeding beetles that we must look  for the highest intelligence these creatures possess  It is the dungfeeding beetle the sacred Scarabaeus  of the Egyptians which rolls up a ball of dung  with her hind legs and then sometimes alone some  times in company with another beetle which hopes  to share or steal the booty rolls the ball to a con  venient place and digging a hole by means of the  large spines on her front legs buries it and herself  with it so that she may feed upon it in safety  Then later on in the year she hollows out a closed  chamber and fills it with prepared dung in which to  lay her egg It is again among the carrion beetles  that we find the Sexton burying dead animals care  fully under the soil and then laying her eggs in them  The history of these sexton beetles is most extra  ordinary They hunt in couples male and female  often many couples together and wherever they find  a dead bird or mouse rat or frog they first feed till  they are satisfied and then drag the body to a soft  place in the ground Here the male beetles set to  work and with their strong heads dig a furrow all  round the animal then another and another till little  by little the carcass sinks down so that actually in  about twentyfour hours it is below the ground and  they can cover it with earth burying the mother  beetles with it Then the fathers too burrow down  and all is quiet and still but not for long for no  sooner has the mother beetle laid her eggs in the  dead body safe out of sight of all enemies than both  mother and father make their way out of the earth  and fly away Meanwhile the eggs left in the de  cayed body are soon hatched and the grubs feed for  three or four weeks and then each building a cell  lies down to undergo its change and comes out of  the earth a perfect sexton beetle  At first sight it seems almost impossible that  such small creatures can bury others so much larger  than themselves yet Miss Staveleyt a good authority  states that four of these beetles have been known to  bury in fifty days four frogs three small birds two  fishes one mole two grasshoppers the entrails of a  fish and two pieces of oxliver Which among us  works harder than this to provide food for the little  ones who come after us Or who can say that  these little beetles do not do their share of good in  the world when they clear away masses of decaying  matter which would poison the air burying it in the  best of all purifiers our mother earth  So feeding on plant or animal in the land or in  the water the beetles with their strongjointed legs  and powerful jaws make their way in life You  have only to watch a beetle forcing its way under a  clod of earth to see how powerful their muscles are  indeed it has been estimated that a cockchafer can  draw a weight fourteen times as heavy as itself  while the beebeetle can draw forty times its own  weight and many of the feats of beetle life beat  those of any athlete among men Yet we find that  they are not wanting in cunning too for who has  not seen the common skipjack beetle drop on the  ground when alarmed and drawing in its legs and  antennae lie on its back and pretend to be dead  till the danger is past and then with a sudden click  of its breastplate spring up in the air and come  down upon its legs But we must pass by many of  these curious histories such as that of the parasitic  beetles which introduce the eggs of their young into  the bees nest where they feed upon the honey and  of the blind beetles which live among the ants and  must even neglect the softskinned glowworms with  their phosphorescent light in the last three rings  of the abdomen and the beautiful fireflies of warm  tropical countries which are near relations of the  skipjack and have two bright shining spots upon  their shoulders We might trace out in the lives  of many of these beetle families the peculiar shape  of jaws les antennae and the peculiar colours of  their wingcases which fit them for the work they  have to do but such knowledge is the work of a  lifetime and at least a few words at the end of this  chapter must be given to the third group of animals  which remodel their bodies namely the t wo winged  flies and gnats  Does it not seem strange that while butterflies  and beetles dragonflies and grasshoppers and even  bees and wasps have all two pairs of wings yet our  common housefly and bluebottle in many other  ways so like bees have only one pair This how  ever will not seem quite so strange if you look care  fully just behind the wings of the fly for there you  will find on each side a little stalk with a knob at the  end which the creature uses to balance itself as it flies  These two stalks are the remains of the second pair of  wings which for some reason unknown to us must  have been a disadvantage to the ancestors of the fly  and this is all that remains of them If you cannot find  them easily in the fly where they are concealed under  some little winglets you will see them clearly in a  gnat or better still in a daddylonglegs in which  they are so distinct that you may examine them  without catching or hurting him by simply putting a  tumbler over him where he stands and slipping a  piece of paper underneath  These balancers tell us that the twowinged  flies the gnats mosquitoes midges bluebottles house  flies and cattleflies are not made on a different  plan from the fourwinged insects but are merely  flies whose hind wings have lost their size and power  while the front ones have become stronger and larger  This has evidently been no disadvantage in their  case for they have flourished well in the world and  myriads are to be found in every town and country  while their different ways of living are almost as  various as there are kinds of fly Some such as  the daddylonglegs suck the juices of plants some  suck animal blood some live on decaying matter  while in not a few cases as among the gadflies the  father is a peaceable sucker of honey while the mother  is bloodthirsty  Among the gnats and mosquitoes the father dies  so soon that he does not feed at all while the mother  has a mouth made of sharp lancets with which she  pierces the skin of her victim and then sucks up the  juices through the lips Among the botflies however  which are so much dreaded by horses and cattle it is  not with the mouth in feeding that the wound is  made In this case the mother has a scaly pointed  instrument in the tail which she thrusts into the  flesh of the animal so as to lay her eggs beneath its  skin where the young grub feeds and undergoes its  change into a fly  For we must remember that every fly we see has  had its young maggot life and its time of rest Our  common housefly was hatched in a dust heap or a  dung heap or among decaying vegetables and fed in  early life on far less tasty food than it finds in our  houses The bluebottle was hatched in a piece of  meat and fed there as a grub and the gadfly began  its life inside a horse its careful mother having placed  her eggs on some part of the horses body which he  was sure to lick and so to carry the young grub to  its natural warm home  But of all early lives that of the gnat is probably  the most romantic and certainly more pleasant than  those of most flies When the mother is ready to lay  her eggs she flies to the nearest quiet water and  there collecting the eggs together with her long hind  legs glues them into a little boatshaped mass and  leaves them to float In a very short time the eggs  are hatched and the young grubs swim briskly about  whirling round some tufts of hair which grow on  their mouths and so driving microscopic animals and  plants down their throats Curiously enough they  g Grub breathing air through the tube pupa breathing air  through two tubes t in the back b floating boat formed of the pupa  skin gn t gnat rising out of it above the perfect gnat is on the wing  These figures are all magnified to give clearness  all swim head downwards and tail upwards g Fig  90 and the secret of this is that they are airbreath  ing animals and have a small tube at the end of their  tail which they thrust above water to take in air  This goes on for about a fortnight when after they  have changed their skins three times they are ready  to remodel their bodies Then on casting their  skin for the fourth time they come out shorter and  bent and swathed up but still able to swim about  though not to eat Meanwhile a most curious change  has taken place The tail tube has gone and two  little tubes p t Fig 90 have grown on the top of the  back and through them the tiny pupa now draws in its  breath as it wanders along At last the time comes  for the gnat to come forth and the pupa stretches  itself out near the top of the water with its shoulders  a little raised out of it Then the skin begins to split  and the true head of the gnat appears and gradually  rises drawing up the body out of its case This is a  moment of extreme danger for if the boatlike skin  were to tip over it would carry the gnat with it  and in this way hundreds are drowned but if the  gnat can draw out its legs in safety the danger is  over Leaning down to the water he rests his tiny  feet upon it unfolds and dries his beautiful scale  covered wings and flies away in safety  With the gnat we must take our leave of the two  winged flies although if we could study their whole  history we should find them so intelligent that we  should not be surprised at Mr Lownes statement  that although a fly is not onefourth the size of a  beetle its brain is thirty times larger In fact it is  among these creatures which undergo metamorphosis  that we begin to reach a point of intelligence which  of its kind is quite as remarkable as that of the back  boned animals But it is not among the butterflies  beetles or even the twowinged flies that the highest  instincts are found There exists an immense order  called the Hymenoptera or membranewinged insects  hymen membrane pteron wing including the gall  flies sawflies ichneumons burrowers bees wasps and  ants in which instinct and intelligence exists to such  a great degree that all naturalists are lost in wonder  at the ingenuity of the wasp or the bee and the  almost incredible sagacity of the ant  And here comes a curious fact which we find  equally among the insects and the backboned animals  As Life endows her children with more intelligence  with quicker brains governing active bodies we find  them becoming more and more dependent upon  others in their infancy and youth Just as the large  and manlike orangoutang remains as helpless as a  human baby for the first few months of its life while  the lower and less intelligent monkeys have long  before that age begun to fight their own battles so  while the grubs of the frivolous butterfly the thought  less gnat and even the more intelligent sawfly are  active and can take care of themselves from the time  they come out of the egg the cellbuilding bee and  wasp on the contrary and the thoughtful contriving  ant have a real babyhood during which others watch  and tend them and when they must perish just as  a child would if it were not for the care and atten  tion of their grownup friends And this helplessness  of infancy increases with the intelligence of the  grownup creature as we shall see on reading the  next chapter For no one will deny that the ant  stands first in mental capacity among insects and its   For an amusing account of the difference between an orangoutang  baby and a young harelip monkey of about the same age see Wallaces  Malay Archipelago p 45  children are more helpless even than those of bees  A young bee eats its own food placed for it in its  cell but the ant can take nothing but what is actually  put into its mouth  It is most tempting to try and trace out this  gradual progress to increased intelligence in age and  helplessness in youth among the membranewinged  insects Thus we should begin with the caterpillars  of the sawflies placed within their proper plant by  the sawlike instrument of their mother and creeping  over it in their youth then pass on to the grubs of  the gallflies which lie helplessly within the gallnuts  eating the food which their mother has prepared for  them by leaving an irritating liquid which causes a  lump to grow up around them on the plant Next  would come the grubs of the cunning Ichnuemon fly  which though feeding on honey herself pierces the  skin of the caterpillar or the beetle and leaves her  eggs in their flesh where the young ones live as  parasites during their sluggish infancy  From these we should go on to the still more  wonderful burrowing insects such as the Cerceris the  Sphex and the Sandwasp which after laying their  eggs in a hole pierce beetles grasshoppers or cater  pillars with their sting not killing them but paralysing  them and then storing them up with their eggs as  fresh healthy living food for the young when they are  hatched two or three weeks later Then we should  come to the true wasps with their beautifullycon  structed paper nests built of wood fibre moulded into  paste and their helpless infants each in its cell tended  with the utmost care and we should learn almost  to have an affection for these industrious creatures  which in some ways show even greater intelligence  than the bees Then these last would claim our  attention with their frugal habits their industry in  storing up honey their wonderful cities in which  each citizen has his duty and their love for their  queen And lastly we arrive at the ants and to  these we must devote the next chapter since to  speak of the others would need a whole book and  the bees we have dealt with elsewhere In the ants  we shall find that life has worked out her masterpiece  among insects and in them we can best learn to  understand how far we have travelled since we started  with the Amceba passing gradually from mere living  feeding and dying atoms of life to active intelligent  beings whose life depends quite as much and even  more upon the inward work of the brain than upon  the outer weapons of the body  CHAPTER XII INTELLIGENT INSECTS WITH HELPLESS CHILDREN  AS ILLUSTRATED BY THE ANTS  So when the emmets an industrious train  Embodied rob some golden heap of grain  Studious ere stormy winter frowns to lay  Safe in their darksome cells the treasured prey  In one long track the dusky legions lead  Their prize in triumph through the verdant mead  Here bending with the load a panting throng  With force conjoined heave some huge grain along  Some lash the stragglers to the task assigned  Some to their ranks the bands that lag behind  They crowd the peopled path in thick array  Glow at the work and darken all the way  VIRGIL  DARE engage said the King of  Brobdingnag as he took Gulliver  on the palm of his right hand and  stroked him gently while his learned  men examined this strange pigmy  through their magnifying glasses   I dare engage that these diminu  tive creatures have their titles and  distinctions of honour they con  trive little nests and burrows which  they call houses and cities they  make a figure and dress in equi  page they love they fight they  dispute they cheat they betray  Now Gulliver was a man made in the same  fashion as the Brobdingnagian king only in smaller  proportions and therefore it was not so wonderful  that the king should suppose him to be living a life  like his own But the little ant which we may take  in like manner on our hand is fashioned quite differ  ently from ourselves and is only an insect and yet  strange to say almost all the things asserted of Gul  liver and many more which seem almost human  may be said with truth about these tiny creatures  For ants make nests and burrows which are real  houses and cities and even clear roadways to and  from their settlements If they do not dress in  equipage they perform their toilet with the greatest  care as well as that of their friends and of the help  less infants of their city They can dispute and  hold communication with their fellows they fight  both singly and in well disciplined armies they  betray in some cases their fellow ants and carry  them into slavery they keep domestic animals  having beetles and other insects living in their nests  as we have dogs and cats in our houses and some  of them provide food for their community by keeping  herds of Aphides as we keep cows Moreover they  form very large societies such as can only succeed  by all the members working together in harmony  In one ants nest made up of several separate homes  there maybe from 50000 to 200000 ants and though  each ant is free to build or hunt or milk or fight  or go where she will it seems to create no confusion  In this way they are much more independent than  bees and wasps whose combs are all built mechani  cally one exactly like the other whereas any ant  may start a gallery or chamber in a new direction  and others soon joining her will add fresh nurseries  and homes to the nest according to their own ideas  Yet there is order in this vast multitude Some  invisible bond makes each and all labour for the  good of the whole and this is the more curious as  there is no special leader or governor among them  In all complicated work which has to be done the  feeding of the queenmother the nursing carrying  and feeding of the young the building of new  chambers the tending of their flocks and herds the  defence of the nest or the formation of new colonies  all labour amicably together without any apparent  government and yet without confusion or disorder  Now before we can understand how it is that  these little insects have advanced so far beyond  others of their class we must first inquire what are  the chief weapons with which life has provided them  and to what use they are put Although ants are  such common insects that there is scarcely a garden  without them and even many of our houses are  overrun by them yet probably very few people have  ever examined one carefully or tried to understand  its very peculiar shape and if you can catch one  wandering about the garden or feeding in the store  cupboard and put it under a magnifying glass you  will be astonished to find how much there is to learn  about it  First notice the ringed abdomen common to all  insects and the very fine stalk by which it is joined  to the rest of the body allowing it to bend easily in  all directions If you have taken the gardenant  this stalk will be made of one knob or ring as it is  also in the hillant F Fig 91 while if you have  the tiny reddishyellow houseant t M there will be  two knobs and by this you may know at once that  the houseant has a sting while the garden one has  not for in England all the ants with one knob ex  cept one single genus have no sting Next notice  the threeringed thorax bearing the six legs On  each side of this are three breathing holes which  however you cannot see without a very strong lens  But even with the naked eye you may discover the  tiny spur s F Fig 91 which sticks out from the  third joint of each leg and a magnifying glass will  show that this spur on the two front legs is larger than  on the others and bears on its edge more than fifty  five elastic teeth c Fig 9 2 while another set of similar  teeth on the leg itself Ic face it and can be rubbed  up against it These are the toiletbrush and comb  of the ant and when  ever she has been  doing any dirty work  she will pause and  use them to brush off  the dust or mud  which has clung to  the delicate hairs and  bristles of her body  Then she will after  wards pass the brush  and comb through  her mandibles and so Head eet eyes  It is however the  head of the ant which is above all remarkable  You will be struck at once with its curious  triangular shape its large size and its flatness while  the small eyes e Fig 92 and the antennae a  bent like the elbow of an arm are very different  from what we have seen in other insects It seems  strange at first that active intelligent creatures like  ants should have such small eyes as many of them  have and still more so that the eyes of the workers  should be smaller than those of the males and females  which do no work But when we remember the  blind Termites p 225 and how they build intricate  homes without any eyes at all we are prepared to  find that it is the antennae which are chiefly used by  ants to guide them in their work  What the true history of these antennae is and  how the ants communicate by means of them we  shall probably never know for though it is almost  certain that they use them for feeling and smelling  and perhaps even for hearing yet there seems to be  some other sense in them by which one ant can tell  another of danger or food or work to be done  For instance Sir J Lubbock who is unwearying  in making careful and accurate observations on the  habits of ants has lately tried the experiment of  pinning a fly or a spider to the ground so that the  ant which found it could not drag it away On  nearly all occasions the ant returning to the nest  brought friends to help her seven twelve and in  one case fifteen came and as she did not carry any  thing with her to show that she had found a prize  it is almost certain that she must have told them of  it in some way The ants which she brought often  came slowly and reluctantly wandering hither and  thither so as to be halfanhour in reaching the dead  insect and once the first ant growing impatient  started off again to the nest and brought a second  body of recruits who after most persevering efforts  carried off the spider piecemeal These ants then  had some means of telling the other ants that they  wanted help and how much they wanted and numer  ous observations show that it is by touching their an  tennae that they make these communications Now  though at first this may appear almost incredible yet  if we think for a moment we shall acknowledge that  it would seem still more strange to a being who  knew nothing about speech to see two men stand  at a distance from each other and only move their  mouths and then go and do something which showed  that one knew what the other wanted so that it may  after all be only our ignorance of antlanguage which  puzzles us  Next to the antennas the most useful implements  of an ant are her mandibles in ni which do the  greater part of the work to which the antennae guide  them Looking in the face of an ant you see these  two outer jaws with their toothed edges resting against  each other but if you make her angry she will open  them wide to seize you with all her tiny might  Does she want to excavate a gallery Then she  will tear out the earth with these toothed spades and  carry it in pellets above ground Is she cleaning a  cocoon She will then use her mandibles tenderly  and neatly to pick out morsels of dirt and afterwards  will lift the tiny ball with them and carry it without  injury up or down the nest Or she may perhaps be  cutting a blade of grass to lay as a rafter in the roof  of a chamber again she saws off the leaf with her  mandibles while she holds it with her front legs Or  lastly if she is fighting to the death in a pitched  battle she will fix these strong pincers so firmly in  the throat of her enemy that even if she is killed  her head will often remain for days hanging on to  the conquerors body  There is however one thing she does not do with  her mandibles she does not chew with them but  uses them to tear and press the food so as to obtain  the juices and ojls in it It is true many ants feed  upon other insects and even on grains but in the  first case they pierce the skin with the mandibles  and then lap up the liquid within and the seeds they  tear to fragments and lick or rasp off the starch with  their tiny tongue Fig 92 helped by the inner jaws  C7  Such then is roughly the structure of the working  ant which is an imperfect female and when we ask  how it is that so small a creature with a body not  onetenth part as strong as many of the beetles and  without the power of flying has made its way so well  in the world we learn that within that curious  shaped head is collected a larger and more complex  mass of nervematter than in other insects so that in  the two large hemispheres of an ants brain life has  prepared a powerful machine for guiding the little  creature on its road In all social insects such as  the bees and wasps the nervemasses in the brain  are larger than in those insects which do their work  alone and one great secret of the success of ants  is that they form the most perfect societies in the  whole animal world  And now how shall we study antlife For  there are as many different races of ants each with  its special habits and customs as there are races  of men and one description will by no means do  for them all The best way will be to speak first  of some one race well known to all of us and then  to say something of others It would seem most  natural to take the little garden ant which is the  one we most often come across But it lives a  great part of its time underground and though it  comes to the surface to sun itself and wander about  it does not do much work above ground except  when it is visiting its cows see p 287 It will be  better therefore to take another common ant the  hill ant or horse ant as it is often called which  lives a more outdoor life  You can scarcely walk through any English wood  without coming across lines of these reddishlooking  ants which are often of very different sizes and have  for ants rather large eyes Their nests are easily  found forming large leafy hillocks at the foot of oak  trees or sometimes in the open ground Even in  England they are often two feet high and on the  Continent they are much larger At an early hour  in the morning all will be still and quiet on these  hillocks for the ants close their doors at night with  leaves or bits of stick and straw but as soon as  the sun rises and flings its beams across the leafy  wood warming the air you may see a few ants  creep out of cracks in the dome and by and by  if the day be fine many large openings will be made  and soon all is alive and active Some ants are  dragging in bits of wood and straw and leaves to  add to the dome others are carrying in bits of insects  young grasshoppers or worms or caterpillars whose  juices they will feed upon in the nest others creep  into the blossoms of plants to steal their honey while  others again seek out the stems covered with aphides  or plantlice and beg of them their sweet juice  It will be remembered see p 203 that the  aphides plunge their trunks into plants and suck all  day long filling their bodies with juice Now when  the ant comes running up the stem in search of  food she comes behind the aphis and strokes it  gently with her antennae and the little creature  gives out from the end of its body or sometimes from  the little horns a drop of sweet liquid which the  ant licks up and it is probable that this is pleasant  to the aphis which in any case always gives out  juice from time to time The ant on her side pro  tects these plantlice keeping off the ladybirds or  other insects which might attack them and even  taking care that for a certain distance round her  own nest no ant from a strange community shall  poach upon her grounds  And now as these wellfed ants with their crops  filled with two or three drops of aphis juice hurry  home again they meet with others those that have  been collecting leaves or those which have been  sweeping out the galleries of the nest and have had  no time to get food These hungry ants run up to the  fullfed ones and stroke them with their antennas  asking for food and then lifting up their mouth they  receive the juice which the others squeeze out of  their crop for one of the principal rules in antcities  is for every member to help another for the general  good  Busy however as every one seems to be outside  the nest they are still busier within If you could cut  one of these anthills in half downwards you would  find that the nest extends often a foot or more into  the earth and everywhere it is a maze of narrow  galleries leading into rooms with vaulted ceilings  see Fig 93 In the top part of the nest made  chiefly of sticks and leaves together with dried seeds  and often little stones and shells these galleries  appear very confused though with a little care they  may be traced by the tiny beams of wood and the  blades of grass and leaves forming the rafters of the  ceilings but down below where the ground is firm  though still mixed with other material the roads are  clearer and the chambers larger  Here active busy work is going on Deep down  almost at the bottom of the nest the queenant is  wandering about with her train of followers dropping  tiny eggs as she goes which the workers pick up  and arrange in little heaps in the chambers In  other apartments are packets of eggs many days  old and these are being licked all over and carried  several at a time by the workers up into higher cham  bers where the air is warmed by the morning sun  Again in other chambers are heaps of little white  legless blind grubs with twelve soft rings to their  bodies Fig pi Fig 9 3 and narrow mouths with  soft mouthpieces ending in a pointed lip These  little helpless creatures can do no more than just  turn their heads to receive the drops of food which  the nurses squeeze out of their crops down the infant  throats They are spotlessly clean for they too  are licked all over daily and every speck of dirt is  picked off by the mandibles of the worker ants  which not only feed and clean them but carry them  as they did the eggs up for warmth in the day and  down at night to escape the chilly air Sir John  Lubbock has observed that these grubs are sometimes  even sorted and arranged in groups according to  their size and age for they live and grow in this  state for various periods according to the time of year  and sometimes remain as grubs for many months  In another chamber quite a different process is  going on for here the grubs have arrived at the  time when they are ready to remodel their bodies  and each little grub moving his head to and fro is  laying down silken threads within which he spins  his soft cocoon Still here also the workers are  busy for as soon as each cocoon is finished they  loosen the outer threads clinging to the earth and  smooth and clean the cocoon till it is a pure oval  ball which they can carry up and down in the nest  though they can no longer feed the little creature  within It is these cocoons c Fig 93 which people  mistake for eggs when they see the ants hurrying  away with them when their nest is disturbed for  the nurses guard their sleeping children with zealous  care and many a workerant has died sooner than  leave a grub or a cocoon in the hands of an enemy  Lastly in other chambers the final act of the baby  ants history is being carried on for after clean  ing and carrying and watching over the cocoons till  the perfect ant is ready to come forth the workers  have still to help it out of its silken prison This  they do by tearing the cocoon gently with their  mandibles two or three of them at a time Then  carefully drawing the ant out of the hole and licking  it all over to clear it of its pupa skin they feed it  and leave it to go to its work which for some little  time will be all within the nest till its coat has be  come hard and firm and its limbs strong When  once it is grown up it may live through many seasons  for Sir J Lubbock tells me that he has ants which  have lived in his room since 1874 and they must  therefore be now at least six and probably seven  years old  All this different work of nursing and feeding  may be going on at one time in a nest some  times in different chambers sometimes pellmell  eggs grubs cocoons and young ants all in the  same room But this is not all which the workers  have to do for if it be summer time a number of  winged ants will be wandering about which have  also to be cared for These are the male ants and  the young females which have not yet begun to lay  eggs They have come out of cocoons rather different  in size and shape from those of the wingless worker  ants and we do not yet know what decides this  difference There is no jealousy in an ants nest  as there is in a beehive between the queenmother  and the young princesses indeed in some nests several  queen mothers live amicably together But still  the workers have to feed and watch all these winged  ants and though the young princesses are allowed  to go outside on the dome of the nest and sun them  selves the workers never leave them and towards  evening may be seen taking hold of them by the  mandibles and dragging them gently home to bed  By and by later in the year all these winged ants  will come out of the nest in a swarm and rise and  fall in the air like the Mayflies over the pond Then  the males will never return to the nest but will  wander about and soon die or be devoured in num  bers by birds or other insects The same thing  will happen to many of the princesses but some will  be seized by the workers and dragged back to the  nest where their wings are pulled off and they settle  down into queens and lay eggs Others which have  fallen at a distance will pull off their own wings  which are fastened very lightly to their shoulders  and will begin to dig a hole and lay eggs in the  earth Whether these solitary queens are able to  found a new nest or whether it is only when two or  three workers join them that they live and flourish  is not yet certain but Sir John Lubbock has shown  that in one case at any rate a queen which he kept  artificially Myrmica ruginodis did bring up some  young workers from her eggs  There is another way however in which new  nests begin and this is when an old nest is over full  or when the leaves and sticks begin to decay and  the carcasses of insects and of dead ants which have  been thrown out of the nest make the home un  healthy In either of these cases some worker sets  off and finds a spot for a new nest this found she  comes back and seizing another ant in her mandibles  carries her off to the chosen place These two again  return each carrying another and so a little band of  workers is collected  Then they set to work One ant begins to dig a  hole with her front legs throwing out the dirt behind  much as a dog does another and another follow in  her train and the work goes on merrily while others  are still going to and fro to the old nest and carry  ing in new recruits As soon as the tunnel becomes  too deep for the earth to be kicked out the exca  vators bite out pieces with their mandibles and carry  them in little pellets outside the hole to form the  upper part of the nest Meanwhile others are fetch  ing sticks and leaves to prop up the galleries and  roof the chambers and so the dome rises above as  the firmer part of the nest is being scooped out below  And now the migration goes on apace no ant  seems to leave the old nest willingly but as soon as  she is carried to the new one the general enthusiasm  seizes upon her and she sets to work to dig and  build or runs back to carry another as eagerly as  any of those that have been long at work In this  way a complete train of ants going and coming are  to be seen those which are emptymouthed going  back to the old nest the others each with her burden  going to the new one M Forel once counted from  forty to fifty in a minute passing each way so that  36000 newcomers would be carried in one day  At first it is only workers that are brought but  when chambers are prepared then the eggs larvae  and cocoons princesses males and queens are all  carried to the new home and the migration is com  plete  The next step if the community be large is to  clear roads to the nearest plants where aphides may  be found and to do this the workers carry away  dead leaves and refuse matter and saw off the living  blades of grass and soon lay bare a narrow path  along which they travel in search of food Now  while all this is going on it will often appear as it  any one ant was wasting a great deal of time running  hither and thither in an aimless kind of way But  it must be remembered that ants see but a very short  distance and that it is by means of their antennae  and probably chiefly by scent that they find their  way Moreover the blades of grass among which  they are moving are to them like tall trees so that  we must look upon them as travellers in pathless  woods following a track and not expect them to go  direct to their point Many too will seem to stand  idle while others look as if they were merely playing  together This is because they not only rest from  time to time but are very particular to clean their  bodies carefully from the earth which clings to them  and when they appear to be playing together one ant  is often performing this kind office for another Still  in spite of wandering and resting and cleaning them  selves it is marvellous what an amount of work  these little creatures do so that in a short time their  new domain is adapted for their life  It may happen however that all does not go  so smoothly the new colony may chance to en  croach upon the territory of some other ants nest  and then comes dire disaster for no two nations can  fight more relentlessly for a province or a frontier  than these little ants do for their plots of ground  No sooner does one community find that another  is taking possession of any part of its domain or  has given offence in some way unintelligible to us  than the workers pour out by thousands marching  close together in battle array eager for the attack  Meanwhile those belonging to the other side advance  to defend themselves and when the two armies meet  they fall upon each other two by two taking hold  with their mandibles and raising themselves up on  their hind legs so that they can turn the abdomen  under the body This is in order that they may  squirt out from the tail that strong acid called formic  add which acts as a poison so that often the com  batants fall dead locked in each others arms When  ever these ants are excited the scent of formic acid  is very strong so that you may smell it in passing  the nest  If one ant succeeds in disabling the other remain  ing unhurt herself she tries to drag her victim off to  the nest there to be killed and devoured Now  although all these ants are exactly alike each army  knows its own followers and it is very rarely indeed  that a friend is attacked If this does happen the  onslaught is almost instantly changed to a caress and  the two friends turn against a common enemy At  night each army returns home but at daybreak the  battle begins again and may rage for many days till  either the inhabitants of one nest are destroyed or  routed or bad weather puts an end to the fighting  And when the war is over the dead and mangled  are not left on the field for these terrible cannibals  carry them off to their nests to suck the juices from  their bodies  Such are the battles of the hill ants but the  mode of attack is very various among the different  races The red ant see p 277 for example is  much more wily and given to stratagem and does  not fight in such large masses Again there are  tiny ants which when attacked by larger ones hang  on the legs and jump upon their backs biting them  and tearing them to pieces while the larger ant tries  to strangle them in her mandibles One particular  slavemaking ant has especially pointed mandibles  and she drives them right into the brain of her  enemy throwing her into convulsions and paralysing  her On the other hand those ants which have  stings make use of them in fighting rather than of  their mandibles while as we have seen the hillant  is remarkable for the force with which she can squirt  out formic acid over her adversary  But in whatever way they are carried on these  antbattles are fierce and bitter for ants have very  few enemies but those of their own kind so that  they swarm everywhere and have great struggles for  their homes and their flocks of aphides Indeed  among ants as among uncivilised human races each  member is faithful to his tribe and bitterly hostile to  any stranger Sir J Lubbock has found that after  a separation of fifteen months an ant belonging to  the nest was recognised and welcomed while a  stranger was hustled and turned away and what  is still more curious when ant eggs were taken to  another nest and the young ones hatched there and  brought up by strange nurses yet their own people  recognised and received them when they were re  turned to their home  The little black ant of our gardens has learnt a  cunning way of keeping out of the way of quarrels by  hiding her honeycows Instead of going out to seek  them every day she carries them home and keeps  them close to her nest where she sometimes surrounds  the stem on which they live with a tube of earth or  visits them by covered galleries or even puts them on  the roots of plants underground in her own home  You may discover this little ant climbing the plants  and tempting the aphides to give out their sweet  drops and by carefully digging up the plants near  her nest you may find the plantlice clinging to the  roots which run through her galleries and her cham  bers Only it may be well to put them back again  to their industrious keepers and you will probably be  rewarded by seeing the ants take them up and carry  them down for safety to a lower part of the nest  The small yellow meadowant keeps her aphides  entirely on the roots of plants fetching and placing  them near to her nest and tending them with the  greatest care even watching over their little black  eggs so as to secure fresh broods In this way she  rarely needs to come above ground and has no  regular openings to her nest  Now when these ants are attacked they do not  come out of their nest to fight on the contrary  they defend it like a fortress hiding themselves in  the lower galleries barring the way with pellets of  earth and disputing every inch with the enemy  Indeed if the struggle becomes very hopeless they  will escape with their cocoons and grubs along their  labyrinth of passages and closing up the road will  raise a new anthill at some distance from the first  These ants work at their nests by night for as they  build entirely with earth they need the damp and dew  to moisten the pellets as they plaster their walls  The ants we have mentioned the hillant and the  meadowant have workers of very different sizes and  there is very little doubt that the larger workers do  most of the fighting indeed in South Europe and  America there are in some species special large  headed workers which are the soldiers of the commu  nity But if you will search carefully in the banks  of the fir woods or in the stumps of the decayed trees  of Hampshire Surrey or Sussex you may chance to  come across a much more curious sight than mere  difference of size for you will find large red ants  and smaller black ones t living in one nest and  working happily together  Yet these black ants were not born among the  red ones their eggs were laid by their own black  mother in the nest at home and they were stolen  the summer before some time between the months  of June and August when they were lying wrapped  up in their cocoons by an army of red ants which  attacked the nest in which they lay  The first alarm was probably given by the appear  ance of a few scouts wandering round the nest and  as soon as the black ants saw them there was terrible  consternation Some swarmed out to face the enemy  others rushed to seize the eggs grubs and cocoons  to carry them to the other side of the nest for  safety where the princesses followed them while  others blocked up the doors to defend the fortress  Meanwhile the red army kept growing in numbers  more and more ants crowding round the poor black  ant city till a semicircle of hundreds of warriors  was formed all standing with their antennae thrown  back and their mandibles wide open Then the  attack began the black ants fought bravely clinging  to the legs of their cruel foes biting them and  striving to drive them off and to bear their little  ones away in safety In vain overcome by the  strength and number of their assailants they had  to give way and soon the conquerors were swarming  over the dead bodies of the defenders and carrying  off their cocoons  From this moment the red ants did not attempt  to fight except with those of the black ones  which tried to escape with their young They  hurried past all the others pushing them aside and  occupied themselves entirely in making their way  into the galleries out of which each red ant came  with her stolen treasure in her mouth and set off  with it at once to her own nest In this way the  whole red army travelled to and fro carrying away  cocoon after cocoon and delivering them over to the  care of other black ants in the nest at home which  had been captured in the same way the year before  and had now settled down as nurses of the establish  ment These ants took the cocoons and watched  and tended them and by and by when they were  opened the black children took to the redant nest  as their home and worked with the rest Except  that they are forcibly seized in their infancy these  black ants can scarcely be called slaves for master  and servant live together like equals only that the  black ants generally remain more indoors while the  red ones go out to seek food  But how have these red ants which are in many  ways some of the cleverest of their kind learnt to  steal young black ones to help them in their  work Mr Darwin suggests the answer It is a  common practice with ants to carry the cocoons  of their enemies into their nests to eat them and  they tear open the cocoon to feed on the insect  within Now nothing is more likely than that  some of the black ant cocoons thus carried in  should be neglected till the ants within them were  perfect and then when they came out active and  vigorous they would be well received as ants born  in the nest generally are and would mix with the  red ones and prove very useful Is it too much  to imagine that thus by degrees the intelligent red  ants should come to understand that it was better to  have the help of the black ants than to eat them  and should learn to fetch them in numbers to help  them in their work One thing is certain that they  know their own interest now for if by chance a  female winged ant comes out of the stolen cocoons  she is killed at once by her red masters who know  that if she lived and laid eggs these would be tended  by the slaves and the nest would soon become a  blackant city  But now see how true it is even among insects  that those who always look to others to save them  trouble become weak useless and contemptible for  though the slave making ants which we have in  England work with their slaves there are others  living abroadt which have become so dependent  upon their black servants that they can neither build  their nests nor tend their young nor even feed them  sjlves It is a mockery to call the neuters of these  ants workers for they can do no work any more  than the males and females but they are soldiers  for the one thing they can do is to go in great  hordes and fight the black ants and steal their  cocoons Here their pointed mandibles which have  lost their toothed edge and are of no use for other  work come into play as deadly weapons in crushing  the brains of their enemies see p 286 and their  warlike expeditions are bold and successful For  the rest they are quite helpless it is the negro ants  which fetch provisions feed the grubs take care  of the princesses build the rooms and galleries and  even feed their lazy masters Huber once took  thirty of these red ants with their grubs and cocoons  and put them in a box with a supply of honey but  though the food lay close to them they made no  attempt to eat and many died At last taking pity  on them he put one little negro ant into the box  and at once she set to work made a chamber in the  earth fed the grubs attended to the cocoons and  even saved the lives of those few fullgrown red  ants which remained Sir J Lubbock has lately  repeated this experiment keeping one of these red  ants alive for months by putting in a slave for two  or three hours a day to clean and feed it  Even when it is necessary to migrate to a new  nest these red ants will not trouble themselves to  walk there but lie on their backs and are carried by  the faithful blacks who never seem to lose their  temper or to mind the work which falls upon them  The only time that we ever hear of the blacks being  angry was once when Huber saw the red ants return  from a slavemaking expedition without any cocoons  This was too much that the only one thing they ever  did for the community should be neglected The  exasperated slaves hustled them and dragged them  out of the nest again but after a few moments re  lented and allowed them to come home  And now from ants degraded by indolence let  us turn to those which have become so industrious  as even to lay up stores for the future Our English  ants being in a cold climate sleep through the winter  deep down in their lower chambers and in this way  have no need of food though the yellow meadow ants  show great forethought according to Sir J Lubbock  by carrying aphides eggs down into their nest early  in October and tending them with the utmost care so  as to secure a crop of young ones which they bring  out the next March and place on the daisy stalks  which are their natural home In warm countries  however such as the shores of the Mediterranean and  the Southern States of North America there is no  chilling influence to make the ants hibernate while  at the same time for some part of the year they  cannot find their accustomed food in the fields and  meadows And so in these warm countries it comes  to pass that the ant provideth her meat in the sum  mer and gathereth her food in the harvest although  many writers have denied the truth of this because  they had only studied the ants of colder countries  It was among the lemon terraces of the warm  sheltered valley of Mentone that Mr Traherne  Moggridge during the last years of an invalid life  set himself to watch these little harvesters which all  belong to the twoknobbed ants see p 271 There  they were to be found in the early spring as soon  as any seeds were ripe hard at work on the rough  slope of the terrace tearing off the seedvessels of  the Shepherds Purse and the Chickweed and plun  dering Peaflowers Honeyworts and grasses of their  seeds and then carrying them in their mandibles to  the nest Sometimes a young and foolish ant  brought in rubbish and not a few were deceived by  some small white beads strewn by Mr Moggridge on  the path But these no sooner reached the nest than  they were hustled out by their elders to throw the  useless burden away so that in a very short time  they all learnt to leave the beads alone  Meanwhile another set of workers within the  antcity were busy stripping off the husks of the seeds  and casting them out of the nest and as in many  cases whole seeds are either thrown out by mistake  or dropped on their way in one of these ants nests  may be found by noticing the little crop of oats  chickweed and other grasses which spring up round  the refuseheap  By cutting a nest open or taking a good piece  out of it with a trowel the little granaries in which  these seeds are stored may be laid bare They are  about the size of a gentlemans gold watch and  are connected by narrow galleries It is a curious  fact that though these seeds grow easily when they  are sown yet in the granaries it is very rare to find  one sprouting This is probably owing to the care  which the ants take to keep them dry making the  roof and sides of the granaries firm and hard and  bringing the seeds out on a warm day and spreading  them round the nest so that any moisture is drawn  out of them Mr Moggridge even saw the ants  after a shower of rain had made the seed germinate  bite off the point of the little root which was begin  ning to show itself  In this way the ants store up seeds in the summer  having often a large series of galleries and granaries  so that from half a pint to a pint of seeds has been  taken from one nest and in the winter when food  is scarce the starch in these seeds supplies them with  nourishment  And now one vexed question still remains have  these clever little insects yet learnt to sow seeds as  well as to gather them This still remains to be  proved but if we travel to Texas we find that one  thing is certain namely that they have learnt to  ANTS AND THEIR HELPLESS CHILDREN 295  clear the ground round their nests even among the  toughest grass and to allow nothing to spring up on  these cleared disks except the needle grass or ant  rice which they store up in their granaries  We have already seen that the English hillant  will clear a path but what labour it must be to clear  and keep clear round spaces measuring from seven  Cleared disk of the agricultural ant with a central mound and  seven roads MCook  to twelve feet across on wild meadow ground covered  with rank weeds two or three feet high some of them  having stems as thick as ones finger Yet this is  done by the agricultural or bearded ants t of Texas  which swarm in such numbers and clear so many  spaces that they actually injure the farms on which  they establish themselves They keep the circular  space round their nests perfectly clean never allowing  a weed to encroach upon it except where at the  edges crops of needle grass grow of which they  harvest the seed Underground their galleries and  chambers often extend under the whole disk and  there can be little doubt that it is chiefly in order to  get air and ventilation about which they are very  particular that they clear the weeds away But  their work does not end here for they make from  three to seven roads according to the size of the  nest branching out into the forest of grasses so that  they can go far afield to collect seeds These roads  are often more than fifty feet long and it sounds  strangely like our own country places when we hear  that they grow weedy in the winter when little used  and are cleared afresh in the spring  When we think however of the small size of the  ants in comparison with the vegetation they have to  destroy the history becomes much more astonishing  Many of the larger and thicker grass stems which  they saw through with their mandibles to clear their  disk must be to them like the trunks of trees measur  ing six feet across while the round spaces they keep  clear are in relation to their size equal to a piece of  country a quarter of a mile in diameter  These ants make their nests entirely underground  only sometimes having a small dome see Fig 94  with one or two openings in the top Their granaries  are very large and yet they are not entirely vege  tarians for Mr M c Cook saw them laying in a com  plete store of male and female termites which fell  round their nest after swarming  Central America can however boast of at least  one purely vegetarian ant namely the leafcutting  ant These active little creatures devastate whole  forests by tearing the leaves with their mandibles  and carrying off pieces about the size of a sixpence  into their nest and Mr Beltf found that these  leaves are probably used for manure upon which  a minute fungus grows inside the nest and forms  the ant food These ants are decidedly clever  for when they were changing their nests once and  had to get their cocoons down a slope Mr Belt saw  one set of workers bring them to the top and roll  them down while another set picked them up at the  bottom Another ant which is housed and fed in  a most peculiar manner inhabits the Bulls horn  thorntree This ant lives in the hollow thorns of  the tree sipping the honey which exudes from a  gland at the base of the leaves and in return as it  stings terribly it protects its friend the tree from the  attacks of the leafcutting ant  The foraging or army ants of Central America  on the other hand subsist entirely on insects and  other animal food and travel in great hordes from  place to place clearing the country as they go and  living in hollow trees and fallen trunks on their road  Cockroaches crickets spiders locusts wood lice  centipedes and scorpions all fall a prey to this huge  moving army often three or four yards wide and  the natives call it the blessing of God because  the ants swarm into their houses and by the time  they leave every insect is cleared away The army  consists not only of dark workers and soldiers with  enormous heads and powerful jaws but nas also at  intervals of about two or three yards lightcoloured  officers which touch the ants with their antennae  and seem to give the orders directing the march  So the column moves on each ant probably guided  chiefly by scent and the other senses of its antennae  for these ants are almost and sometimes entirely  blind Scouts are sent out on all sides to bring  intelligence of booty and the army swarms to the  right or the left according to information given  following the scent of their comrades  And now we must take leave of these intelli  gent little beings though we have not even glanced  at many of their curious habits such for example  as the storing up of honey in the abdomen of ants  hanging from the roof of the nest as is practised by  the Mexican honey ant But we have learnt enough  to be convinced of their intelligence and it only  remains to inquire whether amongst all their work  they have any feeling of sympathy for each other  The truth is they seem to care for the members of  their own nest but more as parts of the community  than as individuals There are many cases in which  ants have gone to help a comrade but this is gener  ally though not always when she is still able to  share in their work as for example when Mr Belt  tells us that the foraging ants never rested till they  had released a comrade which he had covered over  with a lump of clay Sir J Lubbock it is true  gives one case of a poor ant born without antennae  which was roughly handled by some enemies and  was afterwards most carefully carried home by  a friend But these incidents seem rare and upon  the whole the great guiding principle in ant life  appears to be devotion to the community much more  than to each other With them the mother has no  interest in her children after they are born and the  workers take care of all alike so that no special  ties of affection are formed and while we admire  the wonderful mechanism of antlife we must not  expect to find in it that love and personal devotion  which is developed in quite another branch of Lifes  children  We have travelled far since we started with the  shapeless and sluggish Amceba and have surely  justified the statement with which we began that by  giving the prize of success to those who best fight  the battle of existence Life educates her children to  fill their place in the world  Much as we admire the tiny limebuilders and  their beautiful shells we must confess that the slime  animal itself is a frail and helpless being with but  feeble enjoyment of life and the first advance which  we perceive in the sponges is one rather of architec  ture than of individual existence But in the lasso  throwers we already begin to detect the rudiments  of those senses which afterwards become so keen  the nerves eyes and ears of the jellyfish enable it  at least to begin to appreciate the world around it  and to live a free and independent life In the star  fish and his companions we advance still further  Here is movement by walking as well as by swim  ming a keen eye keeps a lookout on all things  around a battery of nerves complicated muscles  and other parts give a far more distinct individuality  and glimmerings of intelligence to the pricklyskinned  animals than to the floating jelly driven hither and  thither by the currents of the sea In fact these  creatures stand at the head of a small but peculiar  branch of lifes children while we have had to travel  along another road to reach higher intelligence  This road led us from the oyster so low in percep  tion yet so perfect in his internal mechanism through  a long chain of beings to the cunning octopus and  cuttlefish Here we have the quick eye the rapid  movement and the power of adapting things to the  benefit of the animal as when the little Sepiola blows  a hole in the sand and arranges the stones round  his body we have the quick instinct of selfdefence  directing the inky fluid against an enemy the capa  city for changing colour for protection or attack and  the maternal care of the eggs In a word we arrive  here at the head of one great division specially  adapted for marine life though some of its forms  gain a footing upon the land Still this division is  incapable so far as we can see of advancing into  successful competition with yet higher forms which  arising in the dim past almost from the same centre  as these mollusca have branched out on sea and  land into crustaceans and insects We need scarcely  follow this branch through its ramifications for the  past chapters have shown the gradual progress of  intelligence accompanying concentration of nervous  power till we arrive at foresight prudence and or  ganisation among the ants  Still we must feel that something is wanting and  that something is mutual sympathy and help between  any two beings independently of mere duty as citi  zens This we shall not find to any extent among  the invertebrata or animals without back bones which  are those we have dealt with in this book Among  the higher mollusca we find something like maternal  care in the cuttlefish and the scorpion and earwig  care for their young But even among insects the  large majority never live to see their children born  and those which do generally leave the care of them  to others We must turn for the development of  fuller sympathy to that other branch the keynote of  whose existence is the relation of parents to child  ren of family love If at a future time we are able  to trace out the history of the vertebrate animals it  will be our great interest to watch the rise of this  higher feeling Then we may perhaps learn that  the struggle for existence which has taught the  ant the lesson of selfsacrifice to the community is  also able to teach that higher devotion of mother to  child and friend to friend which ends in a tender  love for every living being since it recognises that  mutual help and sympathy are among the most  powerful weapons as they are also certainly the most  noble incentives which can be employed in fighting  the battle of lifeHALF HOURS WITH INSECTS BY aIS JR AUTHOR Ol GUIDE TO THE STUDY OF INSECTS LIFE HISTORIES COMMON INSECTS ETC mo BOSTON ESTES

organized world The zoologist and the botanist ordinarily travelling in separate realms seem to meet on common ground while studying the lowest represen tatives of their respective groups Indeed some one has com pared the animal and vegetable kingdoms to two mountain peaks of unequal height whose adjoining bases rise from an elevated table land The naturalist discerns below a won derful simplicity and agreement in the scenes around him for life is there manifested in the simplest geometrical forms and there is no distinction between animals and plants But as he mounts farther up one or the other of tiie ascents his interest is continually excited by the numberless modifications of the simple forms beneath him and while he finds the loftier ele vation teeming with the myriad forms of animal life yet there constantly occur to him hints and analogies connecting the most complex and highly endowed organizations with the humblest forms he left below The question whether animals may not be spontaneously produced still remains an open one while the discovery of the aquarium wiiich reveals to us the delicate balance exist ing between animal and vegetable life and also the alleged necessity of the direct agency of insects in the fertilization of many plants are but examples of the multitudes of ways in Avhicli this dependence of plant and animal exhibits itself The theory of the science of agriculture now so far per fected seems adequate to the end Every year adds to the perfection of the seed to be sown as agriculturists are paying more attention than formerly to a careful selection of the best fruits and seed The chemistry of plants of nutri tion and absorption all the daily routine of plant life has been mapped out by Liebig and his followers The care of flocks and herds and their improvement have made our far mers actually better acquainted with the princiijles of inand in breeding or the secrets of natural selection than many naturalists Indeed the facts already brought out by prac tical writers on this subject are important contributions towards a theory of the method and permanent effects of specific variation a point now so interesting to naturalists Agricultural mechanics in its constant endeavor to lighten toil and economize time thus leading to the increased intel ligence of the laborer is daily enlarging its borders New inventions of reaping and ploughing machines and labor saving machinery of every description are constantly devised so that we may consider the theory of agricultural science far advanced toward perfection Now come in some disturbing agencies such as tempests prolonged rains severe droughts rust mildew and injurious insects Their appearance cannot be prognosticated their direful effects once experienced cannot be immediately reme died nor the remedies Avhen discovered be always seasonably applied The last mentioned cause of disturbance will now engage our attention Nearly ever one can recall the sudden and simultaneous uprising of the army worm in New England during the summer of 1861 Its ravages have been known and dreaded yearly in the western states where at intervals it has done wide and extensive damage Though in a local history a catcrpillivr answering to the description of the array worm had been noticed in New England at long intervals since 1743 its appearance in 1861 took all by surprise as hosts of them appeared full grown and busy at tlieir work foraging upon our wheat and cereals cutting down field after field of grain as they marched their columns in dense black masses over stone walls and through fences often bridging ditches filled with tar or burning straw with the dead bodies of their comianions while tlieir ranks were thinned by hosts of do mestic fowls and other birds which followed hard upon their rear or disputed their onward march They had hardly be gun their work ia New York when their appearance was heralded in the vicinity of Boston But a few days elapsed and their simultaneous appearance in Bangor at the Forks of the Kennebec and tlie limits of civilization on the Penob scot River was announced in the papers and the cry of their coming was caught up on the river St John Millions of dollars worth of grain were lost to the country by the rav ages of this one species of caterpillar The same season the appearance of the grain aphis in hosts which blackened the tops of waving grain ripening for the harvest was no less marvellous as the insect had been comparatively unknown before The range of the grain aphis was still greater than that of the army worm Though hundreds of plant lice pitted against one army worm might produce less visible effects yet the continual depletion by these pygmies in drawing out the sap of the giain stalk must have told upon the quality of the grain and of the seed for several jears succeeding The strange history of the locust its wide spread migra tions its sudden appearance and departure the mysteries of its birthplace the ruin consetiucut on its devastations are familiar to every reader of the Uible and are repeated in ancient and modern accounts of oriental travel These scourges of mankind these insect Vandals and Goths have their family relatives in this country Rumors arc jcarly heard of immense flocks of grasshoppers Fig 1 a Caloptc nus spretus devastating immense tracts of soil in the farthest west and the racilic slopes of the Rocky Mountains In Nev England and the Canadas our most common grasshopper Fig 1 6 Caloptenus femurruhrum has at times emulated the bad fame of the eastern locust In Williamsons His tory of Maine it is stated that in 1749 and 1754 the common redlegged grasshoppers were very numerous and voracious no vegetables escaped these greedy troops they even devoured the potato tops and in 1743 and 1756 they covered the whole country and threatened to devour Fig 1 everything green Indeed so great was the alarm they occasioned among the peo ple that days of fasting and ¦ prayer were appointed on account of the threatened calamity Dr Harris thus quotes from P r e s i d c n t Dwights Travels Their h voracity extends to almost Destructive Grasshoppers i ii i every vegetable even to the tobacco plant and the burdock Nor are they confined to vegetables alone The gaiments of laborers hung up in the field while they are at work these insects destroy in a few hours and with the same voracity they devour the loose par ticles which the saw leaves upon the surface of pine boards and which when separated are termed sawdust The ap pearance of a board fence from which the particles had been eaten in this manner and which I saw was novel and sin gular and seemed the result not of the operations of the plane but of attrition At times particularly a little before their disappearance they collect in clouds rise high in the at mosphere and take extensive flights of which neither the cause nor the direction has hitherto been discovered I vas authentically informed that some persons cmplojed in raising the steeple of the church in NVilliamstown were Tvliilc stand ing near the vane covered by them and saw at the same time vast swarms of them flying far above their heads It is to be observed however that they customarily return and perish on the ver grounds which they have ravaged In the western plains the longwinged Caloptenus C sjyretus Fig 1 a is still more destructive I might also cite the annual loss sustained by the attacks of the wheat midge and Hessian fly the state of New York having lost according to Dr Fitch 812000000 worth of wheat in one jear 100000 bushels of wheat could be raised annually in the state of JMaine if it were not for these two insects Among the more formidable pests in the south and west are the cotton boll worm army worm and the chinch bug from which farmers annually lose thousands of dollars For the greater or less abundance of insects as one 3ear succeeds another one can readily understand that the vicis situdes of the climate the abundance of a particular kind of food the temporary absence of iarasites and external enemies are sufficient to account But for the vast numeri cal increase of insects which are ordinarily sehlom observed and whose lives at the most span but a few months or weeks ve cannot so satisfactorily account Moreover there are great injuries received from the long sustained attacks renewed annually of insects such as the wheat fly and farm and forest insects A late report of a committee of the French Senate which we find translated into the Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal states that the wire worm consumed £100000 worth of corn in one department alone and was the cause of the deficient harvests which preceded 1856 Out of 504 grains of colza gathered at hazard at Versailles all but 29G had been ren dered worthless by insects The reduction of yield in oil was 328 per cent lu Germany according to Latreille the larva of a species of moth Psilura vionacha consumed whole forests In Eastern Prussia three years ago more than 24000000 cubic inches of fir had to bo cut down because the trees were attacked by insects In view of these facts let us now look at some points in the life of an insect Thougli the process of building up the tissues of the body by cell growth had not been distinctly enunciated Ilcrold had given in the remarkable plates to his Disquisitiones clear representations of the gathering of the cells and as the result the faint line of tissues just entering upon the threshold of life in outlines too vague to admit of a guess as to what the future animal might be Then the division of the elongated body into distinct rings and the gradual though but partial evolution of organs when antenna jaws and legs are all alike to the eye of the beholder leave it yet a question whether any further development is to be arrested here and the creature remain the lowest of its type or still pass on to higher grades following unerringly the law impressed upon its being The embryo itself sets the question at rest when it eats its way through its shell and after devouring its former habitation as it often does settles down quickly upon the leaf it is born upon and forthwith begins its riotous life Before Von Siebold had published his tract upon a parthe nogenesis among bees and moths it was currently believed that the bee grub was developed into a drone queen or neuter according to the quality of the food or bee bread it was fed with But this acute and painstaking ih3siologist by the aid of intelligent and scientific bee masters in Germany brought out these astonishing facts in the generation of in sects that the queen bee after her marriage flight far up in the air laid two sorts of eggs that while some of the eggs were at the will of the queen fertilized and produced Avorkers That is the production of young from a virgin insect others were deposited as barren eggs which however were found to hatch out drones It is also known that one of the 3oung worker larvae when phiced in a separate cell and fed upon a peculiar kind of bread became eventually a queen bee These facts give some clew to the anomalies in the gene ration of plant lice Fig 2 Bonnet ascertained that the spring brood of aphides were virgins which throughout the summer brought forth young alive In the fall of the year however winged individuals of both sexes appeared and during the winter the species was represented by eggs It has since been discovered by able anatomists with the aid of the microscope that these springborn aphides so wonderfully prolific throw off from a budstock by a Fig 2 Aphis or Plant Louse process analogous to the budding and leaving out of plants or to the dropping off of hydroid medusa3 from their polp stalks whole multitudes of young plant lice which mature rapidly without passing through the intermediate stages of egg larval and pupal life common to most insects As if nature in her exceeding haste to fill up her quotas of millions of ready made sappers and miners of vegetable life for the summer campaign had disregarded all rules in her otherwise well regulated house In this connection we may refer to Dr Fitchs enumeration of the number of the Cherry Aphis produced between the 15th and 23th of June and how these immense numbers are reduced by insect enemies This species commences to appear as soon as the leaves begin to put forth in the spring They bring forth their young alive during the continuance of warm weather These huddle around their parents upon the under surface of the leaves as closely as they can crowd themselves indeed they often are found two deep a portion of the colony standing upon the backs of the others requiring only suffi cient space between them to insert their beaks into the leaves to suck their juices The numbers which thus make out to stow themselves within a narrow compass are almost incred ible Upon the under surface of a small leaf threefourths of an inch long and half an inch wide I have counted upon one side only of the midvein one hundred and ninety of these lice Yet this leaf was not more densely covered than many others The surface of a small leaf but an inch long would therefore furnish ample space to accommodate a thousand of these insects Among the cherry trees alluded to above was a row of seven joung ones which had attained a height of about ten feet By counting the number of leaves upon some of the limbs and the number of limbs upon the tree I find a small cherry tree of the size above stated is clothed with about seventeen thousand leaves And at the time alluded to these leaves could not huxe averaged less than five or six hundred lice upon each and there were full a third more occupying the stems and the tips of the twigs Each of these small trees was therefore stocked with at least twelve millions of these creatures And yet so vigilant so sharp sighted and voracious were their enemies that at the end of a few das the whole were exterminated This maj help us to explain why males of certain species of gall flies have never been discovered though a German entomologist has examined over two thousand females of one species and not a foreign element occurred in this nation of Amazons Mr Walsh has however discovered that in an American species of gall fly the spring brood consists of both sexes while the autumnal brood is composed exclu sively of females Again in some species of moths where the two sexes are of equal abundance Von Siebold found that it Avas no unusual thing for individuals to be hatched from eggs known to be laid by a previous virgin generation Fairly entered upon the duties of active life the young larva is capable of doing wonders in gastrodynamics It would seem with most insects as if all the eating for their lives were concentrated into this stage of their existence For there is a period coming of long cessation from activity when in external immobility and seeming lethargy wonder ful transformations pervade neive and muscular tissues a new body wonderfully differentiated for a new existence in a far more extended sphere than formerly is taking on its form beneath the rough and often unsightly pupa After the last moulting the power and desire of eating are lost increased stores of fat are laid up for the sustenance of the pupa and the wings and legs of the future fly are forming The worm seeks a shelter and often spins a cocoon of silk and there in quiet and away from the light its functious of animal life suspended and a very slow vegetative existence barely sustained as a chrysalis the insect spends a portion of its life The knowledge of the fact that all animals pass through some sort of a metamorphosis is very recent in physiology moreover the fact that these morphological eras in the life of an individual animal accord most unerringly with the grada tion of form in the type of which it is a member was the discovery of the eminent physiologist Von Baer Up to this time tlic true significance of the luxuriance and diver sity of larval forms had never seriously engaged the atteu tion of systematists in entomology What can possibly be the meaning of all this putting on and taking off of caterpillar habiliments or in other words the process of moulting with the frequent changes in orna mentation and the seeming fastidiousness and queer fancies and strange conceits of these young and giddy insects which seem hidden and mysterious to human observation We can only answer that tlie changes in form are neces sary stages in the growth of the animal and correlated with certain habits enabling it to hold its own in the struggle for existence We should appl our knowledge of the larval forms of insects to the details of their classification into families and genera constantly collating our knowledge of the immature forms with the structural variations that accompany them in the perfect state The simple form of the caterpillar seems to be a concentration of the characters of the perfect insect and presents easj characters by which to distinguish the minor groups and the relative rank of the higher divisions would seem to be definitely settled only when the form and method of transformations are thoroughly known The pupa state is the threshold upon which the young insect pauses before it enters upon the iinal stage of its ex istence Though called chrysalides because the pupae of cer tain butterflies are gaily ornamented with golden and sil very spots the most of them are dull and ugly Whether it is owing to their uninteresting appearance or the difficulty of finding them entomologists have very generally over looked the consideration of their forms and have underesti mated the value of the differences that the puiDe of different insects present There is in them more than in the cater pillar or perfected state a constant form by which we can readily recognize the family to which they belong and even in the slight modifications of that persistent facies together with the slight attempts at ornamentation which Nature seems always to be striving for in the rudest of her works the student whose mind is upon the watch for the meanings of these slight variations Avill be richly rewarded Just as insects have been classified by their larval characters which have ahvays agreed Avith those drawn from the imago can they again be arranged in a natural method by the sole con sideration of tlieir chrysalid characters When the insect breaks fortli from its clirsalis we can then see how wonderfully complex is the outer crust that gives form to the creature and protects its vital parts At first sight we see the body divided into three portions to which naturalists give the name of head thorax and abdo men terras borrowed from the anatomj of man himself and to be retained in science only until more appropriate names are suggested It is as if we should take a wormlike cylin drical figure consisting of successive rows of cylinders and should constrict it in two places thereby dividing the whole bod into three sections or regions Of these regions the first is the smallest and most unlike the two others in shape and besides organs of special sensation is provided with chewing organs while within is an enlarged pair of nerve knots serving as some sort of a brain though hardly larger than those snppl3ing the remainder of the body This re gion constitutes the head Larger than the head inasmuch as it is to support the organs of locomotion is the middle region or thorax which supports the legs and two pairs of wings while the largest portion of the body is the lulky abdomen which retains very much of the original wormlike form of tlio larva and is the seat of the reproductive system But weie the contour of tlie rings that make up these sections of the hard outer crust still continuous and unbroken we should have the poor victims enclosed in jackets of the straitest kind Whence comes theli all the grace and freedom of action that the but terfly and ichneumonfly possess It is in the fact that the whole outer crust is subdivided into portions finely hinged together by tough membranes and forming points of attach ment to thousands of little muscular fibres within thus giving it a surprising degree of flexibility Besides these pieces of which there is a definite number to each of the thirteen segments or rings that compose the body of every insect exclusive of the head which is supposed to consist theoretically of four segments we have to consider the numerous joints of the antennae of the mouth parts wliich consist of three pairs of appendages and of the legs We see therefore that descriptive entomology has to take account of several hundred distinct pieces which by changes in their relative size and position produce the immense range of vari ation in the half a million species which are found living or dead upon the earth Thus the idea of articulation upon which Cuvier founded this branch of the animal kingdom wiiich begins so simply in the worm and grows more complex in the crab and its allies in the insect is carried out with a richness and profusion of detail that is almost bewildering It is like comparing a boat dug out of a log to the Great Eastern or an Indians wigwam to the cathedral of Milan Our frontispiece conveys an idea of the metamorphosis of a butterfly a moth and a beetle The butterfly is the pretty Melitcea Phaeton which flies in June and July Its cater pillar feeds on the golden rod and when it transforms into the pretty white chrysalis fastens itself b the tail to the stem of the plant and hangs head downwards awaiting its final change into the butterfly The moth whose transformations are represented on the left of the plate is the Ctenucha Virginica It is a dark blue insect which flies in the hottest sunshine contrary to the habits of the majority of moths Its caterpillar which feeds on grass is like the Hairy Bear of our gardens and constructs under stones a jjretty cocoon of hairs which it plucks from its own body The water beetle is the common Gyrinus or whirligig beetle so commonly seen gyrating in small parties over the surface of our ponds Its singular larva is long and slender with long fringed breathing appendages along the sides of the body After all the insects interest us most when we study their psjcholog and habits From what little Ave know of their lS3chical endowments we see enough to convince us that as physicalh they occupy a middle ground between ourselves and the lowest and simplest of animals so in their instincts they seem to maintain a corresponding relation Tliey have what is the common property of all animals enough intelli gence to meet the exigencies of life They possess apparently like passions with ourselves so much so that we find our selves unconsciously judging of their actions by our own feelings Hence to our senses they hate and love show fear and revenge enjoy their moments of repose from toil engage in sports cany on wars live a hermit life or are gathered into commonwealths and are capable individually of some degree of education All this great diversity among insects in form and accom panying adaptation of instinct and reason are subservient to the part these animals are to play in natiuc There are no neutral noncom mittal characters among insects The agriculturist classifies them into two categories the friends and foes of his crops accord ing 13 Ihcy arc carnivorous cr herbivorous and it i necessary for him to di tinguish carefully between them This is often a diflicult matter for as we descend in the scale of animal life we find those broad lines of demarca tion which separate animals of different habits growing less distinct In some tribes which resemljle each otlier so closely that only educated eyes can distinguish them we have spe cies of totally different habits Thus the Hessian fly Fig 3 13 Fig 3 llcssiaa Ily a larva b pupa which swarms over our wheatfield might easily be mistaken by the farmer for what seems to him to be merely small or young mosquitoes so similar are the mature stages of the two though vhen a larva the one preys upon our crops and the other does service to mankind as a scavenger of our ponds and pools So also the bed bug which we can with safety pronounce to be essentially a bloodsucker has many allies which are innocuous sapsuckers Indeed our wonder is continually excited at finding insects of very similar form with habits of life most strikingly opposed Any account of the natural history of an insect would be very imperfect were the habits and description of the pecul iar parasites that check the increase and diffusion of the species left unrecorded All animals and many trees and llants are exposed to annoyance from the continued attacks of other species without having their actual existence en dangered but among insects the term parasitism has an other and extraordinary meaning since besides those minute forms of lowly organized life which only harass without inflicting more serious injur we have an immense number of insects high in the scale of organization which subsist upon other insects only to kill and destroy them utterl Thus of the ordinary parasitic plants and animals which always live on insects Dr Leidy has given us in his Flora and Fauna within Living Animals published in the Smith sonian Contributions to Knowledge some representations of remarkable delicacy and beauty of miniature forests of microscopic plants which line the alimentary canal of sev eral sorts of groundinhabiting insects There are not wanting here even divers sorts of low and exceedingly mi nute worms part of whose ofllce it may be is to restrain and keep within bounds the vegetation which luxuriates in those strange passage ways In the other form of parasitism the insect devours all the soft parts of the body of its victim leaving but the empty 14 crust ill its place Now there are two conditions to be ful filled in this act of parasitism for the insect preyed upon must maintain its hold upon life feeble as it may be long enough to enable the enemy lurking within to build up its tissues and add to its own strength by daily depleting from Fig 4 Ichneumon Muerocentrus the stores of vitalized food about it and on the other hand the parasite must carefully avoid touching the vital parts of its host It must content itself with feeding upon the fatty portions alone of the body That family of the Hymenoptera of which the ichneu monfly Fig 4 is a type and many species of true flies Fig 5 bearing a close resemblanco to the common house fly are devoted to this work of parasitismextraordinary The process is thus the parent fly lays its eggs within or upon the body of its victim most commonly a caterpillar which is fullgrown and about to enter upon its transforma tions The young worm hatches and feeds upon the large stores of fatty tissues which surround the vital organs of its host How very nice must be the adjustment of relations between the two animals when in the case of the parasite the slightest deviation from its path involving any injury to the neighboring nerves or vessels of its host will bring Fig 5 Tachina and larva eventual ruin to itself b hastening the death of the cater pillar This delicate balance between the growing parasite and wasting victim may continue through the chrjsalid state of both insects until just as we think the butterfly will break its prison walls lo the trim neat form of its unrelenting enemy steps forth from its body ready armed and equipped for active service The late Mr Ilerrick some years ago announced the dis covery of the fact that the eggs of the canker worm were preyed upon by a minute ichneumonfly Here is an anom aly an egg nourishing its inhabitant and immersed in the contents of another egg We have had the pleasure of watching the labors late in autumn of this little insect whose length measures not over three hundredths of an inch as it was busily engaged upon a bunch of eggs under our object glass Avith a restless anxiety to rid itself of its burden of infinitesimal eggs by pushing them through the walls of those upon which it stood Each egg developing perhaps simultaneousl we can imagine the race and struggle for ex istence in that tiny enclosure The germ of the larger worm rapidl collects and arranges the elements of its own form but it is in vain for the smaller being of a more rapid growth is stealthil and unawares as constantly pulling Fig 6 Antlion down that structure of cells and tissues The race is not always to the strong It often happens that several species of these parasites feed upon a single kind of caterpillar Thus upon the arm worm six species of ichneumons are known to exist and a Tachina fly is extremely destructive to it Baron Humboldt tells us in tlie Views of Nature that Bombyx Pini the Pine Spinner the most destructive of all the forest insects in Purope is infested according to Ratzeburg by no less than thirtyfive species of parasitical Ichneumonidaj AVe have incidentally alluded to the agency of carnivorous insects in diminishing the numbers of vegetable feeders The appellation of antlions Fig 6 antlion in its hole Fig 7 adult apliislions tiger beetles water tigers Fig 8 and dragonflies names borrowed from their fierce four footed namesakes are significant of the fierce passions and insatiable appetites of their sixfooted copyists We were one autumn reminded of the great value of having Fir 7 Antlion ailult a brood of martins or swallows about the farm and garden when a storm prostrated a martin box and one of its com jjQ g partments was found literally packed with the dried remains of the little yellow and black squash beetle The great and efficient aid of birds is too apparent to be passed over lightly We quote again from the Report of the French Commissioners upon this subject The commission excludes birds of prey such as magpies ravens etc with the exception of buzzards and rooks from the benefit of its pro tection because the buzzard consumes about six thousand mice yearly The Water Tiger rooks eat an incalculable amount of white worms Sparrows once thought harmful as eating grain are restored and their usefulness shown by reference to the fact that when their destruction was attempted in Hungary winged insects increased so rapidly that rewards for the destruction of sparrows were suppicssed and others given for bringing them back Frederick the Great ordered the destruction of sparrows because they ate his cherries but in two years time he found his cherries and all other fruits consumed by caterpillars In a sparrows nest on a terrace in the Rue Vivienne were found the remains of seven hundred cockchafers Owls and birds of that class which agricultural ignorance pursues as birds of ill omen ought to be welcomed They are ten times more useful than the best cats and not dangerous to the larder The martins that were killed were found to have in their stomachs the remains of five hundred and forty three insects The commission recommended a prohibition of birdnesting and the destruction of eggs or young birds We must not kill any birds even those that in the late summer pilfer from our orchards at other times eat multi tudes of worms It will not do to destroy the balance of nature The stud of insects has been too much confined to their classification and the synonymy of the species It is only occasionally that we see naturalists whose dispositions and opportunities lead them to study habits exclusivel or to combine the two departments of study DcGeer and Reau mur of the last centur whose ponderous tomes arc packed with observations of insect econom many of which have never since been repeated laid the foundation of these in quiries The labors of the Swedish Count and French nat nral philosopher are monuments of patient research and curious inquiry Here also should be noticed Ratzcburgs great work on forest insects In the elaborate and beautiful plates fifty seven in all that enrich the two volumes of this distin guished entomologist is reproduced the tree as it stands ia the forest gnarled and distorted by one set of insects its leaves curled and turned jellow or red by the attacks of others with certain branches stripped by still others and not only are certain trees and shrubs thus represented in colors but some of the plates represent parts of a forest showing the injury done in the mass by one or two species of insects with the changes in the form of branches and leaves for several years succeeding the defoliation and the after growth of branches depending on the different degrees of hijury with transverse sections of the twigs and micro scopic sections illustrating the pathological anatomy of the tree In England Cuitis Farm Insects and in our own country Harris Treatise on the Injurious Insects of Massa chusetts together with Fitchs reports on tho injurious in sects of New York and Walshs on those of Illinois Rileys on those of Missouri LeBarons on those of Illinois Trim bles work on the insects injurious to fruit trees and the reports of the writer on the insects of Massachusetts all elucidate the subject of applied or economic entomology Indeed the study of economical entomology is of growing importance Every passing year witnesses the attacks of new enemies of our crop that appear as the forests are cut down and their natural food plants destro3ed The wanton killing of insecteating birds also tends to a steady increase in the number of noxious insects More knowledge of en tomology should be diffused among agriculturists tliat they may be made acquainted with these pests and be forewarned against their attacks and thus save a fair percentage of their crops We begin in this number an account of the insects of the garden and as their name is legion we shall have to select a few of the most noxious and portray as clearly as possible their forms and briefly sketch their habits Were we to enumerate all the insect pests which gather about our flowers garden vegetables ornamental shrubs and fruit trees the list would extend to several hundreds A few of these such as the imported cabbage butterfly apple barklouse the vaporer moth the gooseberry sawfly and others are importations from Europe while the still more injurious canker worm tent caterpillar apple tree borer pear slug and more that could be mentioned are natives and before the apple and pear were introduced prob ibly fed on the species of wild cherr thorn and other rosaceous plants common in our woodlands In speaking of the great number of injurious insects which infest certain plants I may be pardoned for quoting as follows from my first Annual Report on the Injurious and Beneficial Insects made to the Massachusetts Board of Agriculture We should not forget that each fruit or shade tree gar den shrub or vegetable has a host of insects peculiar to it and which 3ear after year renew their attacks I could enu merate upwards of fifty species of insects which prey upon cereals and grasses and as mau which infest our field crops Some thirty well known species ravage our garden vegetables There are nearly fifty species which attack the grape vine and their number is rapidly increasing About scAcntyfive species make their annual onset upon the apple tree and nearly an equal number may be found upon the plum pear peach and cherry Among our shade trees over fifty species infest the oak twentyfive the elm seventyfive the walnut and over one hundred species of insects prey upon the pine Cut Worms Among those general pests which have no special foodplant and from their omnivorous tastes do infinite mischief in gardens are certain sl nocturnal crea tures the cut worms They have the well known habit of cutting off with their jaws the young succulent plants of the cabbage turnip bean tomato corn and various cultivated flowers These caterpillars are usually cylindrical the body taper ing slightly towards each end with a horny crescentshaped plate on the segment preceding the head They are usually livid greenish or ash gray with darker stripes along the body which is either smooth or slightly warty At rest they may be found curled up under sticks or stones in the grass or under boards etc left carelessly in he garden They transform within a rude earthen cocoon or chamber under the ground into a brown chrysalis which may often be found at the roots of corn grass etc The worm may be found late in spring and early in summer The parent moths fly late in summer and in September and while most of the family Noctuidaa fly only by night these Dart Moths as riQ 9 they are called from their rapid headlong flight may be seen in the hottest days about the flowers of the golden rod Our commonest species is the Gothic Dart Moth Agrotis subgothica Fig 9 The youBg of this modest moth is said by IVir liiley who has reared it to be an inch and a quarter long of a dirty white or ash gray with sometimes a yellowish tinge Along the back is a whitish line edged on each side with a dark one On the side are three lateral dark broader stripes the lower one the widest Another common but still larger Dart Moth is the Lance Bearer Agrotis suffusa of European authors or A telifera of Harris Fig 10 Mr Riley calls its caterpillar the Large Black Cut Worm It is an inch and a half long dull brown above with a distinct pale line on each side of the middle of the back Between these lines and the row Lance Bearer of breathing holes are two more pale lines There are eight black shining minute warts on each segment each wart bearing a short hair A third species of cut worm whose parent was called by Harris tlie Clandestine Moth Noctua clandestina is next to the Gothic Dart Moth our yj jq most common species and ma be found by day hiding under boards etc It flies only by night It is a blackish moth with obscure markings Its caterpillar is called b Riley the Wmarkcd Cut Worm It is an inch and an eighth long and is ash graj inclining on the back and upper sides to dirty yellow it is speckled all over with black and brown spots He adds that besides the usual lines on the side tho distinguishing feature is a row of black velvety marks along each side of the back on all but the thoracic segments i e the three succeeding the head bearing a general Fig 11 resemblance look ing from tail to head to the letter W These may be re garded as examles of the group of cut worms of which we have numerous forms All how ever seem to agree in the special mode of attack The cut young plants square off near the ground and then luxuriate on the soft pulpy centre of the stalk One species in the west Agrotis Cochrani Fig 11 ascends pear and apple trees and gvap vines eating off the fruit buds while another larva not of a true Agrotis however in New England cuts off the soft fresh shoots of the currant Mr Cochrane says that the western moth alwa3s prefers to lay her eggs near the hill or mound over the roots of the trees in the orchard and if as is many times the case the trees have a spring dressing of lime or ashes with the view of preventing the operations of the May Beetles this will be selected with unerring instinct by the miller thns giving her larvae a fine warm bed to cover themselves with during the day from the observation of their enemies It is probable that the females of all the Dart Moths deposit their eggs at the roots of grass stubble etc in the sum mer and early autumn and sometimes in the spring It is a weighty reason for burning all stubble or ploughing it under as deeply as possible that the eggs of many insects and indeed various insects themselves are thus destroyed Nearly all these moths frequent grass lands and rise from the ground on being disturbed fly off in their headlong course a few yards and drop down towards the roots of the grass According to Riley the eggs hatch out and the larvas acquire twothirds their size when winter overtakes them they then descend below the reach of the frost there re maining torpid until the warmth of spring calls them to the surface In a few species the winter is passed in the chrs alis state Cut worms hide by day under stones boards or sticks or in gardens burrow into the dirt to avoid the light and heat At dark they come up to the surface and usually according to Mr Coleman American Naturalist June 1873 appear regularl those that he watched coming up at nine oclock lie observed that the worm fed upon the grape in the follow ing manner The wormAvould come out of the ground at its usual timo ascend the vine till it came to a new shoot gnaw tliiit off and fasten itself to the stump of the branch so gnawed and suck the sap of the vine till it was so full that it seemed almost ready to burst then descend to the ground and bury itself out of sight It is well known that a roll of paper or tin surrounding the plant and its roots is the best preventive against the insidious attacks of the cut worm Mr Cochrane in deal ing with the Applebud Cut Worm sajs there is no known remedy salt has no properties repulsive to them they burrow in it equally as quick as in lime or ashes Tobacco soap and other diluted washes do not even pro voke them but a tin tube six inches in length opened on one side and closed around the base of the tree fitting close and entering at the lower end an inch into the earth is what the lawyers would term an effectual estoppel to fur ther proceedings The lest remedy is then to watch for the worms at dark or dig around the roots by day and kill by pressure under foot The next best remedy is to surround tlic plant with a roll of paper or pasteboard and avoid the use of nostrums recommended to kill he worm It is also a good plan to set Ijoards under wliich the worms are inclined to hide they should be examined every day and the worms if found killed Riley suggests that many cut worms may be entrapped by making smooth holes with a stick and examining tlieni the next day when the worms may possibly be found at the bottom The Mure Worm Another universal plague in gardens is tlie wire worm It is omnivorous in its tastes feeding on the roots of grain lawn grass various flowers and vegeta bles and in some cases attacking fruits and flowers They occur in all sorts of places but more abundantly tlian else where under the bark of trees and stumps where they feed on the deca3ing wood and thus are not harmful We have between one and two hundred species in this country The accompanying figure 12 taken from the Report of the En tomological Society of Ontario Canada for 1871 represents the larva and pupa of a common form Agriotes mancus which is very injurious to wheat The wire worm is readily known by its smooth slightly flattened cylindrical hard red dish body Mr Johnson Pettit who has made us fully ac quainted with the habits of the wheat wire worm says that it lives three years in the larval state He obtained a knowl edge of its habits by planting wheat in flower pots He found the grubs in the autumn with the first cold weather they ceased to eat and were then placed in a sheltered situa tion until the return of warm weather in the spring when they were restored to the breeding cages They soon gave evidence of being alive and possessing unimpaired appetites 1 Larva cnlargecl 1 little over three times n a transverse section 2 Un der side of the head and three succeeding

ftcr Horn their rapid consumption of the wheat plants rendered it nec essary to renew the supply quite as often a3 before They were fed in this way until the month of fiq 13 July On the 2Gth of August one of the grubs changed into a pupa and on the 3rd of September the first beetle appeared It is a pale reddish brown insect This insect and its allies are called click or snapping beetles from their power of throvving themselves up in the air in order to right themselves whenever placed by accident on their backs Figure 13 represents the grub and snapping Beetle and larva beetle of another wire worm which Fig 14 according to Mr Walsh lived in decaying wood in his breeding jar for a period of two years Figure 14 enlarged four times repre fig 15 sents a small slender wire worm found b Mr

Fig IG which has two largo luminous eclike spots on cacli side of the thorax and another at the base of the hind body beneath AYe have in New England even a phospliorescent wire worm Fig 17 Melanactes which sends out a dull greenisli light at night We cannot in speaking of remedies do better than quote from Mr Bethunes report Lime and ¦° T soot to be applied to the soil before sowing any grain are highly recommended by some but arc of doubtful efEcacy Salt on sandy soils is considered to be efficacious but not on heavier clay lands In a garden or small field they may be got rid of by strewing about slices of potato turnip or apple and examining the under sides every morning vhen numbers AVill usually be found feeding upon the bait Fig iG Moles are very useful in destrojdng them in meadows and a large number of our small birds devour them with avidity ducks turke3s and fowls will pick them up in ploughed fields and toads are not averse to making a meal upon them Our advice then is break up and fallow the infested wheatfields ploughing often and burning up the rub bish and encourage in every wa the farmers best friends the small birds Make it an absolute law of the household that not one of Fire Fly them is to be shot or stoned get your neighbors to do the same and believe us not many years will pass before you will find your insect plagues enor mously diminished The concluding remarks apply with much force in dealing with all our noxious insects The May Beetle Fig 18 larva pupa and beetle after Riley Our readers may recognize old acquaintances in the insects here figured The grub or white worm is abun dant in gardens lawns and grass lands and the parent beetle or Dorbug is the insect which so pertinaciously taps against our windows at night and if successful in effecting an entrance wheels its droning flight about the room to the terror and confusion of those within The grub is a large softbodied flesh Avliite worm as thick as the little finger about an inch and a half long with a honey yellowish or pale horncolored head Its skin is so thin and trans 28 Luminous Wire Worm parent that the air vessels and viscera can be seen through it and though it has three pairs of rather long legs it is so May Beetle ami young gross and unwieldy that it lies flat on its side when dug oit of its retreat in the soil In this state the grub lives three jears The series of changes the insect passes through in its whole existence is as follows in the months of May or June the yig 19 beetles pair and the females lay from forty to fifty eggs in loose dirt below the surface These eggs according to Mr Riley hatch in the course of a month and he adds that the grubs growing slowly do not attain full size till the early spring of the tliird year when they construct n ovoid chamber lined with a gela tinous fluid This fluid hardens we may add forming a glazed inner wall The chrysalis or pupa Fig 19 may be found in these cells about six inches under the surface in May and rarely in the autumn During the latter part of May and early in Juno iu New England namely for about a month the beetle flies about at night being most active in warm damp weather especially before thunder storms a period when most insects are restless By day our beetle in its sober garb of chestnutbrown hides in the foliage of trees especially the apple clinging to tlic under side of the leaves by its long curved claws which are admirably adapted for the purpose During winter the grub descends below the reach of frost and at the approach of warm spring weather wriggles up towards the surface The European Cockchafer has much the same habits as our Maychafer and when we say that in 18G6 the grubs of the Cockchafer destroyed in the department of the lower Seine over 5000000 worth of garden vegetables we fear we are prophesying a state of things that may ensue in America when our population becomes as densely crowded as in the old countries of Europe M Rciset see American Naturalist vol ii 209 says that this insect is three 3ears in arriving at its perfect beetle state The larva3 grubs hatched from eggs laid by the beetles which appcaicd in 18G5 passed a second winter that of 1867 at a mean depth in the soil of nearly a foot and a half The thermometer placed in the ground which was covered with snow at this mean depth never rose to the zero point or 32° Fahr of the Centigrade thermometer as minimum Thus the larvje survived after being perfectly frozen probably most subterranean larvce are thus frozen and thawed out in the spring In June 18G7 the grubs having become fullfed made their way upwards to a mean distance of about thirteen inches below the surface where in less than two months they all changed to the pupa state and in October and November the perfect beetle appeared The immature larvjB warned by the approaching cold began to migrate deep down in the soil in October vbon the tcmperaturG of the earth wis ten degrees above zero Centigrade as soon as the siov melted they gradu ally rose towards the surface The mischief done by the grub of the May beetle is at times almost incalculable In lawns and grass lands it cats the roots of grass Dr Harris in his well known Treatise sajs that in many places the turf may be turned up like a carpet in consequence of the destruction of the roots We have lately ascertained that it seriously damages strawberr plants being undoubtedly introduced in the manure It cats the main roots and so large and voracious is this worm that the roots of one plant must form a light meal for them and a dozen or so of the worms would be enough to ruin a small bed of strawberry plants It is obvious j oq then that if we observe a plant to wilt and suddenly die the white worm is at the roots It should be dug up and crushed be neath the foot It also eats in a still more summary manner 3oung squash plants when the have thrown out three or four leaves so that gardeners have been obliged to plant tlie seed over once or twice As to remedies against this grub the careful gardener will in the first jhice de Caiosoma caiidum stroy every grub turned up by the plough or spade When the top dressing is spread over the bed he would do well to examine it carefull for these conspicuous worms When a vine is seen to die down suddenly in summer he must then dig around the roots and search for the aggressor It is better to spend much time and money for two or three 3ears in suc cession in endeavoring to exterminate these grubs than to yield passively to the scourge It is Avell known that crows and small birds feed upon them in corn fields Skunks and moles are etncient aids in killing both grubs and beetles and the larger carnivorous beetles such as the Caiosoma Fig 20 devour the beetle itself In certain favorable 3ears the May beetle is fcarfull abundant It is then necessarj to resort to hand picking If the French take the pains to practise picking their chafers off the plants b hand so that in one instance about 80000000 were collected and de stroyed in a single portion of the department of the Lower Seine our gardeners can afford to take similar care The Goldsmith Beetle Fig 21 Of very similar habits is an ally of the May beetle the beautiful woolly yellow jj beetle which is as varied in its tastes as the May beetle The insect in the beetle state feeds on the young ten dor leaves of the pear elm hickoiy poplar oak sweet n guui and black berry while the Goldsnith Beetle and larva mischief to the roots of strawbeny plants The grub is white with a 3ellowish head and closeh resembles that of the May Beetle simply differing in having longer antennae and feet Rev Dr Lockwood has made us acquainted with the habits of this dcstructiAe chafer In the middle of June in New Jersey the beetle lays in the night about fourteen eggs in the soil each egg being deposited singly and at different depths In about a month i e the middle of July they hatch In other resjects its habits are much as in the May beetle In one instance tvro acres of plants were irrotriev abl ruined Dr Lockvrocd adds that the Goldsmith grub can be taken at any hour of the day simpl by scratch ing the earth from around the roots of those plants whose dark shrivelled leaves tell of the enemys presence The Seventeen Year Cicada Fig 22 a pupa b the same showing the rent in the back out of which the adult c creeps d hole made by the ovipositor for the eggs e after Rilej in its earl stages injures the roots of fruit trees by sucking the sap with its beak while the fly in its peri odical visits deserts the oak trees its natural food plant and invades our orchards causing by the deep stings of Seventeen Year Cicada eggs and piipa its large powerful ovipositor the 3oung twigs ¦ and small branches to wither and break off The most remarkable fact about this insect is that while so far as we know the other species of Cicada pass but two or three years in attaining the winged adult state the present one lives under ground over sixteen years assuming towards the end of the seventeenth the winged state AVe The European specics of Cicada live three years according to Ilaldcinan have seen that the May beetle is about three years in attain ing the beetle state and the wire worm and boring beetles such as the apple borer may be three or four years in the larval condition but no other insects are as yet known with this sole remarkable exception to be so long lived in their immature state The eggs of the Seventeen Year Cicada to the number of five hundred are laid in June and about the middle of Jul in the Middle States the grubs Fig 23 greatly enlarged are hatched They escape into the ground from the twigs on the trees and make their way to the smaller roots of the tree burrowing a foot or two below the surface When about to change to the winged state they ascend to the surface making cylindrical burrows firmly cemented and varnished so as to be water proof It should be here men tioned that certain broods T « r » A r i of this species appear once Larva of Seventten 1 ear Cicada ¦ in thirteen years and this indicates that the ancestors of the present species went through their round of existence in two years as in the other species How the wonderful divergence in habits was brought about would form an exceedingly interesting subject of inquiry We are indebted to Dr W I Burnett for an interesting suggestion concerning the chances of life in this insect and this may give us some hints regarding the enormous waste so to speak of life though after all it is an example of the economy of nature involved in the struggle for existence among animals Says our author in a paper read at a meet ing of the American Association for the Advancement of Science Albany 1851 The female has about five hundred eggs which from certain relations of the other sex which I have made out microscopically are probably all or nearly all fecundated We have then for every two individuals which have appeared this year a deposit of five hundred embryos for the generation to appear seventeen jcars hence Now from what has just been stated about the uniformity of their numbers each time it apixars that from the liabili ties of destruction during the long term of seventeen years out of these five hundred embryos only two appear certain of life and appearance iu their perfect state that is just re placing the two parents The chances of life therefore with this iusect are in round numbers two in five hundred This calculation may seem strange to some but if we reflect it can scarcely be otherwise for suppose the chances were double that is four in five hundred then we should have at each time just double the numbers of their last time which observation has shown to be untrue and which would augur much evil for the future condition of the vegetable world in the localities of their appearance Even if their chances were three in five hundred or half again the original stock agriculturists would quickly perceive the difference To sum up the matter then we have here an insect whose economy and conditions of life are so unique that it is almost entirely isolated from human destructive agencies and which is obliged to deposit five hundred chances for the certainty of securing two The ovaries have been formed with this capacity and the whole internal economy is of a correspond ing character The sluill noise made by the male Cicada for says Anacreon they all have voiceless wives originates in two kettledrumlike organs situated under the wings at the base of the hind body The Aphis Fig 24 We should not be doing justice to the subject of garden pests if we omitted a special notice of that Avonderful creature the Aphis or Ilant Louse Tl e first to appear in spring as the buds unfold the very last to desert their leafy homes in autumn iufesting every shrub tree and herb and not content to pre upon tlie leaves and bark but even attackino the roots of annuals and trees alike these little plagues are well nigh omnipresent The naturalist Bonnet as we have preiously intimated discovered in 1742 the singular mode of reproduction in these insects by which we are enabled to account for their enormous numbers He discovered that the summer brood of wingless individuals or larvie were born of virgin mothers that their progeny gave birth to similar aphides and so on through the summer for nine generations until the original maiden aphis counts her children and grand children by millions This large family thus launched into the world are abundantly able to provide for their own wants without the slightest anxiety to the maternal heart They at once on being ushered into the world plunge their long beaks into the leaf or twig on which they crowd and there remain through their lives leading a gluttonous existence indeed for when their stomachs are full they do not have to rest awhile and sharpen their appetites for the next meal or resort to emetics as in the palmy days of Roman epicurism but nature has provided them with two safety valves being two little tubes situated on the end of the body The liquid food or sap after passing through the alimentary canal in part overflows through these tubes as a sweet exudation called honey dew It may be seen drop ping on leaves and sometimes solidifies into a solid whitish sugar Aphides are thus a great source of attraction to ants and other insects which visit them for the sake of this honoy Frequently the ants will stroke them and urge them to give out their honey more rapidl hence they seem to milk them and the aphides are regarded as the ants cows Some utili tarian ants treat them as domestic cattle herding them and even carry this care of their flocks so far as to take them up in their jaws and carry tliem to a place of safety in their nests if clanger threatens The injury done by aphides is incalculable The Wheat Fig 25 aphis at certain seasons when extremely abundant by its punctures and the consequent loss of sap causes the crop to dimin ish the kernel being partly remphigus shrivelled and lessened in weiglt The leaves of the elm apple tree and currant are curled up and the tree disfigured by them while other Fig 213 Fig 38 Larva of Syrphus Fig 2Ga Syrphus Fly Fig 27 Ladybird and young Aphiseating Mite forms Pemphigus Fig 25 produce galllike swellings on leaves and the roots of trees An instance where the same species forms galls both on the roots and leaves of the same plant is shown in the Phylloxera vastatrix of the grape vine that fearful scourge of the vine3ards of Europe and America Fortunately they have many enemies The maggot of the Syrphus Fly Fig 2G 2G a the fly Lady birds Fig 27 larva pupa and beetle prey upon them ver extensively and certain small ichneumon flies Aphidius as well as other insects ceitain mites such as the form here figured Tromhidium hidbipes Fig 28 and also some birds must diminish their numbers The Scale Insect Closely allied to the plant lice are the bark lice or scale insects on which we will dwell for a moment Imagine an animated 03ster shell or shallow basin walk ing about on six slen der legs and we have the young bark louse Let age effect its changes the insect becoming stationary the legs disappearing and its basinlike form glued to the bark of the tree and it be comes still more like an oyster shell fas tened to its native insect Male eulaiged rock Now compare with this bizarre form assumed b the female the winged active male and what a striking diflTercnce and yet both were exactly alike in the larval state What are the causes which have produced such a remarkable divergence between the two sexes They are for the most part mysteri ous and beyond our comprehension and yet by compaiing the scale insects with other members of the family to which they belong such as the mealy bug of our hothouses or Cochineal insect of tropical countries and the Aleurodes in which the sexual differences are less marked and then com paring them with the aphides on the one hand and on the other the Ps3lla a member of another family closely allied we are en abled to see that the changes »cpj inform have been undoubtedly induced by differences in habits the kind of surface to which the scales are attached the species i of tree to which they belong as well as to the different degree of mobility of the female for the more she is fixed and immov able the more active and lively is the male just as in St3dops Femaiestyiops b ecp ar asi te the female Fig 30 is remarkably different from the agile volant male Fig 31 We may see in the aphis where the two sexes are alike that in their 3 couitships the male finds its active partner in the ordinary move 1 ments of life while since the female scale V ¦¦ul insect is immovable xl Eirfi its winged partner needs to be far more restless and swift in its movements than 1 1 Male Stylops the male aphis so that its chances of encountering its mate in the course of its travels and thus providing for the continuance of the species are greatly iucroascd We know from personal ob servation that these male scale insects do travel far from the trees on which their partners occnr This leads us to regard this almost unnatural activit of the male scale insect as tending to prevent too close inandin breeding in the species Nature in her wise and prudent forethought thus instead of confining the sexes to one tree so that cousins intermarry and the stock deteriorates scat Pine Scale Insect ters these twowinged atoms bearing them along on the wings of the wind and landing them in other groves and orchards where they ma intermarry with different races and tlius the species be restrained within the proier limits Here wc have another cause by which these sexual differences may have been produced Any one who has noticed these female scale insects clus tering on an orange or iv or oleander leaf knows how much their form varies with that of the surface to which they are fittachcd In the Pineleaf Scale insect Fig 32 a the leaves with the scales of natural size male scale c female Fig 29 the male greatly enlarged after Riley the scale marked d is much wider than in the one marked c which lives on a narrower needle of the pine Indeed so great is the range of variation that when we regard the larvalike females it becomes difficult to draw the limits between the species Nearly every tree of the orchard and our hard Avood de ciduous trees harbor one or more kinds of scale insect The oyster shell scale insect of the apple tree is an unfailing at tendant and to young trees is extremely pernicious The orange trees of Florida have been at times grievously afflicted by another species while our ornamental shrubs and vines Fig 33 Parasite of Scale Insect and hothouse plants suffer greatly from their attacks The injury they do is the result of their vast numbers since they cluster on the leaves and stems of plants puncturing the skin or bark and sucking the sap flowing beneath Happily they have their parasites certain exceedingly small ichneumon flies such as CoccopJiagus and Aplielinus Fig 33 antcnnre c larva all greatly enlarged after LcBaron which prey upon them It is not rare to find a scale insect with a large round hole in the top of its bod through which the ichneumon has escaped Mites are also known to prey upon their eggs The Imported Currant Saio Fly This dreadful pest of currant and gooseberry bushes affords an excellent example of the mode in which an imported animal flourishes far beyond its natural limits when introduced into a new coun tf where its native insect parasites and bird enemies if such there be cannot reduce its numbers It was imported from Europe into nurseries at Rochester New York during the year ISGO It seems since that time to have spread westward and eastward arriving in eastern Massachusetts about 18G5 and since tlien has been very destructive in gardens in New England including the east ern part of Maine The parent of this worm is a saw fly so named from bear ing a sawlike sting or ovipositor with which it pierces the leaves or stalks of plants cutting a gash in which it deposits an egg the egg passing out from the ovarj through the oviduct and thence through the blades of the ovipositor into the wound made in the plant While most of the mem bers of this family cut a gash in the leaf into which an egg is pushed a few as in the present insect simply place them on the under surface of the leaf as seen in Fig 34 The fly has four wings and belongs to the group of insects Hymen optera that comprises the bee wasp and ichneumon fl The following account of its habits is taken from the writers Guide to the Study of Insects There are about fifty species of Nematus in this country of which the most injurious one the gooseberry saw fly has been brought from Europe Professor Winchell who has studied this insect in Ann Arbor Mich where it has been very destructive ob served the female on tlie IGth of June while depositing her cylindrical whitish and transparent eggs in regular rows along the under side of the veins of the leaves at the rate of about one in fortyfive seconds The embryo escapes from the egg in four days It feeds moults and burrows into the ground within a period of eiglit days It remains thirteen das in the ground being most of the time in the pupa state Avhile the fly lives nine da3s The first lrood of worms appeared May 21st the second brood June 2oth It Figure 34 i shows the eggs deposited along the under side of the midribs of the leaf 2 the holes bored by the very 3oung larvie and 3 those eaten by the larger worms Figure 35 a enlarged represents the worm when fully grown It is then cylindrical pale green with a pale green head while the segment next behind the head and the third segmcxit from the end of the body togetlier with the last or anal segment are yellow the sixteen false or abdominal legs are also ellow the six thoracic legs are horncolored The body is transversely wrinkled especially on the back and is slightly hairy The eyes and jaws man dibles are black and on the inner side of the edge reddish It is about threequarters of an inch in length Previous to the last moult however and before it has gained its full size preparatory to passing into the adult or winged condition the body is covered with black tubercles from each of which arises a stiff black hair There is also a supraanal or dorsal black patch on the last segment of the body from which arises a pair of black spines On the back of the false caterpillar the tubercles become smooth and trans versely oval and arranged in two regular rows Moreover a still more important characteristic of the worm in this state is the jetblack head which in the fully grown insect is pale peagreen In the region of Salem they may be found late in May or 12 Eggs of Imported Currant Saw Fly the first week in June feeding on the currants iiu 1 by th 8th of June they spin their cocoons which are of silk tough dense like parchment and at first green then becoming blackish and covered Avith particles of dirt and attached to the leaves in the breeding box Here they remain between two or three weeks in June the adult flies in Salem appearing June 2oth At nearly the same date June 29th the worms of the second brood were spinning their cocoons Larva of Imported Currant Saw Fly These cocoons belonging to the second rood remain under ground or on the leaves about the roots through the winter the flies appearing in the spring and laying their eggs as soon as the leaves unfold Not having specimens of both sexes of this saw fly at hnnd I coniile tie following description ften using their own words from Messrs AValsh and Rileys account in the American Entomologist Vol 2 p IG from which these illustrations Figs 36 a and 36 h are taken The female Fig 36 6 is a quarter of an inch long and is of a bright honeyjellow color The head is black with all the parts between and below the origin of the antennco except the tip of the mandibles jaws dull honeyycllov The antennae are brownblack often tinged with reddioli above except towards the base and beneath entirely dull reddish except the two basal joints They are fourfifths as Fig 3c long as the body the tliird joint wlien viewed side wise is four times as long as wide the third fourth and fifth joints are equal in length the remaining joints slowly diminishing in length On tlie thorax are four conspicuous black spots and other smaller ones The legs are bright honeyyellow the basal or hip joints coxjb and tro chanters whitish while the extreme tips of the hind shanks tibise and the Importca Currant Saw Fly whole of the hind toc joints tarsi are blackishbrown The wings are glossy with dark veins and expand a little over half an inch She is known in Europe to lay eggs which have not been fertil ized and from wliich young caterpillars are hatched as is sometimes the case with the silkworm and other moths as well as other kinds of insects including the honey bee The male Fig 36 a is rather smaller a fifth of an inch in length and is black The head is dull honcyyollow The antennjB are brownblack often a little reddish beneath except towards the base they are as long as the body and while longer than in the female are also somewhat flattened out The thorax has the wingscales and the prothorax or collar honeyyellow The under side and tip of the abdo men are honejyellow The injury done to currant and gooseberry bushes is very great They strip the bushes eating the leaves down to the leafstalk myriads clustering upon the branches The birds evidently do not feed upon them and thus in dealing with this insect we are deprived of one of the most powerful agencies in nature for restraining a superabundiince of insect life We can scarcely realize the amount of good done to the farmer and gardener by insectivorous birds As this is an important and practical subject let us digress for a moment to notice some facts brought out by Mr J J Weir a member of the London Entomological Society on the insects that seem distasteful to birds He finds by caging up birds whose food is of a mixed character purely insecteating birds could not be kept alive in confinement that all liair caterpillars were uniformly uneaten Such caterpillars are the yellow bears Arctia and Spilosoma the saltmarsh caterpillars Leticarctia acrjed the cater pillar of the vaporer moth Orgyia and the spring larva of butterflies with these may perhaps be classed the European currant saw fly He was disposed to consider that the flavor of these caterpillars is nauseous and not tliat the meclianieal troublesomeness of the hairs prevents their being eaten Larva which spin wels and are gregarious are eaten by birds but not Avith avidit they appear very much to dislike the web sticking to tlicir beaks and those com pletely concealed in tlie web are left unmolested WhcMi branches covered with the wel of Ijponomenta evonymcUa a little moth of the Tinea family Avere introduced into the aviarj those larvae only which ventured beyond the protection of the Aveb were eaten Smoothskinned gail colored caterpillars such as the Currant Abraxas or span worm which never conceal themselves but on the contrary appear to court observation were not touched by the birds He states on the other hand that all caterpillars whose habits are nocturnal and are dullcolored with fleshy bodies and smooth skins are eaten with the greatest avidit Every species of green caterpillar is also much relished All Geometras whose larvse resemble twigs as they stand out from the plant on their anal prologs are invariably eaten Mr A G Butler of London has also found that frogs and spiders will not eat the same larviB rejected by birds the frogs having an especial aversion to the currant span worms Abraxas and Halia The natural enemies of the Currant Saw Fly are three kinds of ichneumon flies of which one is a minute eggpara site Mr Lintner of New York states that of fifty eggs laid by the parent saw fly only four or five hatched out the currant worm VVe see then that though the birds appar rently destroy none an immense number are carried off even before they have a chance of doing any mischief by minute insects of their own order One of the best remedies next to picking them off by hand and which is really the most practicable method of getting rid of them is to dust powdered white hellebore over the bushes by sprinkling it from a muslin bag tied to a stick as it otherwise excites violent sneezing Used in this small quantity it is not poisonous This is the remedy used with most success in the west and recommended by Messrs Walsh and Riley A solution consisting of a pound of copperas to six gallons of water has been used with much success It blackens the leaves but does not injure them permanently Also suds made of carbolic soap is perhaps a better remedy Dr E Worcester of Waltham according to the Boston Journal of Chemistry finds that this worm may be fully and almost immediately destroyed by the use of carbolate of lime The doctor tried the powder in many instances during the jjast summer and found that while it was fully as effective as hellebore it was less disagreeable less costly and perfectly safe The method of using it is to sprinkle it over the bushes as coon as the worm makes its appearance bringing it well in contact with the leaves and soon the insect is dcstroed It will need but two or three applica tions and the work is done This worm attacks the gooseberry as well as the currant though in Massachusetts its ravages have been more confined to the latter shrub As a preventive measure against its farther spread in buying or transporting gooseberry and currant bushes Walsh recommends that the roots be care fully cleaned of dirt so that the cocoons may not be carried from one garden or nursery to another The Native Currant Sato Fly As this species maybe confounded with the European saw fly though belonging to Fig 37 Native Currant Saw Fly a different genus Pristiphora the following brief account of it is extracted from my Guide to the Study of Insects This saw fly Fig 37 a larva 6 female from the Amer ican Entomologist P grossidaricB of Walsh is a widely diffused species in the northern and western states and injures the currant and gooseberry The female fly is shin ing black while the head is dull yellow and the legs are 17 honeyyellow with the tips of the six tarsi and sometimes the extreme tips of tlie hinder tibije and of the tarsal joints pale dusky for a quarter of heir length The wings are partly hyaline with black veins a honeyyellow costa and a dusky stigma edged with honeyyellow The male differs a little in having black coxae Mr Walsh states that the larva is a pale grassgreen worm half an inch long with a black head which becomes green after the last moult but with a lateral brown stripe meeting with the opposite one on the top of the head where it is more or less confluent and a central brownblack spot on its face It appears the last of June and early in July and a second brood in August They spin their cocoons on the bushes on which they feed and the fly appears in two or three weeks the speciniens reared by him fl3ing on the 26th of August This worm may at once be distinguished from the imported currant worm by the absence of the minute black warts that cover the body of the latter The same remedies should be used against this worm as were recommended for the imported saw fly The Currant Sjictn Worm Fig 38 moth Fig 39 i 2 caterpillar 3 pupa Many persons in speaking of the Pio 38 currant worm confound the cater pillarlike saw fly larva with the wellknown geometer caterpillar which is a native species and was long since described by Dr Fitch under the name of Abraxas ribearia Wfc «iXrf As soon as the leaves of the cuirant Currant Span Worm Moth fjj expanded late in May or early in June the young caterpillars scarcely thicker than a horsehair may be found eating little holes in them In about three weeks after hatching it becomes fully grown it is about an inch long and bright yellow in color the body being covered with large blade dots The chrysalis is shining reddishbrown about half an inch long and may be found late in June either upon the ground or just under the surface In two weeks after entering the chrysalis state the moth may be obseived fl3ing about the garden or resting upon the leaves during cloudy weather The moth is yellow ochreous with dark often nearly transparent blotches on the wings Fig 39 Currant Span Worm and Pupa It is not easil mistaken for any other moth Mr Rilej in an article on this insect in the American Entomologist states that by sprinkling powdered hellebore upon the leaves or appljang a solution of eight or twelve ounces to a bucket ful of water the caterpillars will be killed Handpicking assiduously followed up and a vigorous shaking of the bushes over a sheet or newspaper repeated twice a day will keep this insect within moderate bounds The EiirGpean Cabbage Butterfiy It is interesting to compare tlic habits of the imported butterfly witli tliose of our native species TVe have two kinds of vvhitc Cabbage butterflies which have never done much harm to our cabbage and turnip crops The first of tliesc is the common white Northern Cabbage Butterfly Pieris oleracea of Harris Fig 40 a larva We have found the larvae of this species ou turnip leaves in the middle of August at Chamberlain farm in northern Maine Thc are of a dull green and covered with dense hairs When about to transform they suspend themselves by the tail and a transverse loop and their chrysalides are angular at the sides and pointed at both ends Harris The butterfly is white with the wings dusky next the body the tips of the fore wings are yellowish be neath and the hind wings are strawcolored beneath The yellowish pear shaped longitudinally Native Cabbage Euttcifli i ii i ° ribbed eggs are laid three or four on a single leaf In a week or ten days the larvae are hatched They live three weeks before becoming full fed The chrysalis state lasts from ten to twelve days There is an early summer May brood and a late summer July brood of butterflies While this kind feeds on the leaves of the cabbage and turnip the Southern Cabbage Butterfly Pieris Protodice when in the caterpillar state feeds on the outer leaves of the cabbage plant It is often destructive in market gardens in the middle and southern states But the injury done by our aboriginal butterflies is slight indeed compared with that resulting from the European species which is usually unchecked by its ichneumon parasites or by birds which are preserved iu Europe where with us they are either brutally murdered or neglected if allowed to Jive The European Cabbage butterfly Pleris rapce Schrank is however a hundred fold more formidable insect as it is fearfully abundant where it occurs and the caterpillar feeds inside of the cabbage head when forming It was introduced from Europe to Quebec about the year 1857 having been captured in 1859 by Mr Bowles of that city It rapidly spread into New England along the differ ent railroads leading in from Canada and is now common about Boston and New Yorlc and has reached Washington About Quebec it annually destroys 250000 worth of cab bages according to the Abbe Provancher It is evident that in this newly arrived insect we have another formidable pest added to our list of imported insects The male butterfly Fig 41 is white with the tips of the fore wings black dusted with white while on the fore wings is a single and in the female Fig 42 there are two large black spots situated twothirds of the distance from the base to the outer edge of the wing It expands about two inches The female lays her eggs singly on the under side of the leaves The caterpillar Fig 43 a is green and so densely clothed wdth minute hairs as to be velvety it has a yellowisli stripe down the back and another along each side the belly being of a paler brighter green it is often more than an incli long and about as thick as a large crowquill It changes in September under some board or stone to a chrysalis suspended by a thread spun over the back as rhown at Fig 43 b It is of a pale fleshbrown colcr freckled witli black It does not appear to have been very destructive in Europe but like other introduced species it suddenly becomes a fearful scourge The best remedies arc eidently handpicking when the caterpillars can be seen iind the capture of the butterflies by means of a light gauze net mounted on a wire ring a foot in diameter and attached to a short pole Affected cabbage heads should be carefully examined and if mvich infested by worms be burnt for if they are suffered to lie about the garden after being pulled up the caterpillars will attack the other plants A correspondent of the American Agriculturist for November 1S70 states that it is estimated that the loss from this insect will in the vicinity of New York cit Fig 41 Tig 43 Imported Cabbage Butterfly male Fig 42 Imported Cabbage Butterfly female Caterpillar and Chrysilis alone exceed half a million of dollars and already the price of cabbages has advanced He says that Mr Quinn the owner of a large plantation has found carbolic powder superphosphate and lime together to destroy them The carbolic powder appears to be sawdust impregnated with car bolic acid Salt has been recommended but Mr Quinn did not find dry salt efficacious though lime has been reported by others as useful Mr C S Miuot in an interesting article entitled Cab bage Butterflies in the American Entomologist vol 2 strongh recommends destroying the chrysalis which may be found under chips boards stones etc and advises that boards raised two inches above the surface of the ground be placed among the plants to attract the caterpillars when about to change to a chrysalis Mr Curtis has described and figured several parasites of the three species of cabbage butterflies found in England and he shows how thoroughlj they keep in check these trou blesome worms Certain minute ichneumon flies Chalcids lay their eggs in those of the butterflies Another Chalcid fly Pteromalus brassicce lays its eggs on the outside of the chrysalis of the White Cabbage Butterfly Pieris brassicce and sometimes two or three hundred of the little Chalcid maggots have been found living riotously within a single chrysalis They turn into minute brilliant flics which mul tiply in excessive quantities Mr Curtis remarks that some species of this extensive genus PieromaZws prob ably comprising nearly one thousand species swarm even in our houses especiady in the country where in October and November I have seen immense numbers inside of the windows and I believe that they hibernate behind the shut ters in the curtains etc Fortunatelj for the prospects of American gardeners we have a parasite Fig 44 a male 6 female c larva d pupa which already carries off large numbers of the caterpillar Lately in the middle of September Mr F W Putnam handed me one hundred and ten chrysalides of the butterfl all lut two of which wore infested by these parasites in both the larval and pupa states while from other chrysalides the adult Chalcid flies were emerging They continued to emerge until late in the autumn The infested chrysalides of tlie butterfly could le easily distinguished by the livid and otherwise discolored and diseased appearance of the body while those unattacked had preserved their fresh color and the tail moved about readily the diseased ones becoming stiff and more or less dried Mr Putnam thinks that at least twothirds of the chrysalides of this butterfl3 hundreds of which had in the early autumn suspended themselves about his house and fences had been attacked by these useful allies On opening the bod of the infested chrysalides I found about thirty parasites in different stages of growth in one case thirtytwo in another only twelve We can readily see Fig 44 Parasite of Cabbage Butterfly how efficient these minute insects become in reducing the numbers of their hosts A large proportion of the Ptero mali undoubtedly winter over in the body of the chrysalis the adult insects appearing in the spring In England Mr Curtis found the fly in June so that evidently there is an autumn and spring brood of Chalcid flies The male of this Pteroraalus is a beautiful palegreen fly with the body finely punctured and emitting metallic tints the abdomen or hind body is flat in dried specimens with a deep crease along the middle of the upper side and it is much lighter in color and Avith more decided metallic reflections than on the rest of the body The antennte are honeyyellow Avith narrow black wings The legs are pale honey yellow It is from onetwelfth to onetenth of an inch in length The body of the female which would be thought at first to be an entirely different kind of insect is much stouter broader with a broader oval abdomen ending in a very short ovipositor while the underside of the body near the base has a large conical projection It is much duller green than the male and the body is more coarsel punctured The scu tellum of the metathorax is regularly convex not keeled in both sexes The antennas are brown and the legs brown becoming pale towards the ends the ends of the femora thighs being pale the tibij£ are palebrown in the middle much paler at each end while the tarsi aie whitish though the tip of the last joint is dark It is from a line to a line and a third in length It differs from Harris Fteromalus vanessce in the little piece known as the scutellum of the metathorax being smooth not keeled and by its darker legs The larva is a little white maggot about a sixth 17 of an inch in length The body consists of thirteen segments exclusive of the head and is cylindrical tapering rapidly towards the head while the end of the body is acutely pointed The chrysalis is whitish the limbs being folded along the under side of the bod the antenntu reaching to the end of the wings the second pair of legs reaching half way between the end of the wings and end of abdomen while the tips of the third pair of feet reach halfway between the second pair of feet and the eud of the abdomen It is from a line to a line and a third in length This invaluable ally of the gardener is one of the chalcid family of Iljmenoptera and was long ago described by Linnajus under the name of Itcromalus imparum from tlie fact that it inhabited the pupae or chrysalides of butterflies This insect has been known to inhabit this country since 1844 as there are sjiecimens in tlie Britisli Museum taken in Hudsons Bay Territory in that jear so that it is probably indigenous to both countries while its present host in North America is the imported cabbage butterfly introduced in 1857 I have found that another parasite attacks this insect as the larva of a species of Tachina Fig 45 occurred n the body of a caterpillar Doubtless others Avill eventually be found to take up their abode in the body of this insect It would be interesting to learn whether the birds prey upon the butterfly or caterpillar and whether they assist in reduc ing the number of these pests We can but hope that the present enormous numbers of these worms will as soon as the insect becomes fully domesticated be held in check by the united efforts of gardeners and the natural ene mies of the insect As the worm eats the interior of the cabbage or cauliflower it is difficult to deal with Some Tachina larva thing can be done by showering the heads with a solution of carbolic acid or strong soap suds but it is better to employ hand picking and when the plants are hopelessly infested to throw them on a hot fire If fed to animals the worms will manage somehow to escape The Cabbage Webmotli Another destructive insect which is almost cosmopolitan in its distribution is a little green caterpillar which at times so abounds on the outer leaves as to threaten the destruction of whole fields of cabbages It is most abundant in a warm and unusually dry season Dr Fitch was the first to observe it in Illinois during the year 1855 He named it Cerostoma brassicella but it is un doubtedly the well known European Plutella xylostella and first described by Linnaeus Though the insect has been observed in this country only late in the summer and in Sep tember when the cabbages have headed yet these worms as Dr Fitch suggests probably belong to a second brood Mr H T Stainton in his excellent Manual of British But terflies and Moths states that the moths fly in May and August while the caterpillars appear in June July and a second brood again in September Dr Fitch suspects that the first brood of caterpillars maj feed on the5oung cabbage plants in early summer and thus do more mischief than in the autumn when the heads are fully formed The caterpillar is a little pale green worm with small stiff dark hairs scattered over the body it is a quarter of an inch long When about to transform it spins a beautiful open network of white silken threads forming a cocoon Fig 46 open one at end it is a third of an inch long The moth itself Fig 4G a is pale gray with the head palpi and antenna white but the lat ter are ringed alternately with 1 1 1 Cabbage Webmoth and cocoon white and gray on the outer half The rest of the body is gray except on the under side and on the middle of the thorax where there is a broad white longitudinal band which when the wings are folded is continuous with the white band along the inner side of the wings The two front pair of legs are gray with the tarsal joints ringed narrowly with white the hind legs are whitish and hairy The fore wings are gray with a conspicuous broad longitudinal white band along the inner edge and extending to the outer third of the wing this band sends out three teeth towards the middle of the wing the third tooth being at the end of the band There is a row of dark dots Tlii8 and flsnre 41 arc from my Report on the Injurious Insects of Massachufctts anil are kindly loaned by Mr C L Flint Secretary of the Massachusetts Board of Agriculture along the outer edge of the stripe a row of blackish dots along a pale shade just outside of the front edge of the wing and two rows of blackish dots diverging upon the tip or apex of the wing The fringe is marked with a few dark spots The middle of the wing next the white band is darker than the front edge while a faint jcllowish shade runs along the middle of the outer half of the wing towards the tip enclos ing a few black dots It expands a little over half an inch Should 3oung plants be attacked by the worms the best remedy would be to shower them with soapsuds For the autumnal brood of worms the plants should be plentifully showered and if this is not efficacious the worms should be picked off by hand the cocoons especially The Garden Leaf Roller One of the most intelligent and industrious of our garden pests is the leafrolling cater pillar which as soon as the leaves unfold in the spring begins to draw them together in an ingenious manner by silken threads in order to make a rude sort of domicile where it may live hidden from the sharp ejes of its featliered and insect enemies By the first of June its presence in the terminal shoots of the apple the rose and other shrubs together with the strawberry may be detected by the crum pled and distorted mass of leaves at the end of the shoot or if the strawberry plant by the leaves being sewed together in a tangled head How is the following problem in mechanics to be solved How does the tiny worm pull the leaves together and sew them into a rude sort of tube or tent The little creature begins by spinning a thread and attaching one end to some fixed point and then attaching the other to tiie loose leaf By means of the powerful muscular movements of the front part of the body and like a sailor except that our caterpil lar uses its teeth it is doubtful if the fore legs assist in the operation it hauls away on the rope of silk slowly pulling it up to the desired point where it is held in place by a new an 1 shorter thread Finally after much labor the joung caterpillar for it begins its work soon after hatching from the egg spins a number of threads each of which adds new strength to the tubular structure until a tent arises the whole the work of perhaps but a few minutes In this tent it resides enlarging it as its body grows and eating out the interior adding new stores of food by sewing new leaves to the outside of the tent until when about to pass into the chrysalis state it stops eating It does not now desert its home Its tent serves it as a rude cocoon the caterpillar having previously lined it with silk and we often find the end of the chrysalis protruding out of the door of the tent after the moth has flown away p This species of leafroller called Lozotcenia rosa ceana by Dr Harris Fig 47 enlarged twice is rather large compared with others of its family its body rather plump and pale livid green its head is black as is also the ring following while the other segments are transversely wrinkled above with a few scattered fine hairs The moth itself usually appears about the last of June From its eggs laid at this time a new brood of worms appear in August The af pupa or chrysalis is pointed on the top of the head and on the hinder edge of each abdominal ring are two rows of spines The moth is pale brown with two broad oblique darker reddish brown bands across the fore wings and a tri angular spot of the same color near the tip The hind wings are ochreous yellow The wings expand abont an inch and the caterpillar is a little less than an inch long There are many other leafrolling caterpillars Avhich roll up leaves much more perfectly than the Garden Leafroller No one has described their mode of building their tubular houses letter than the celebrated French philosopher and naturalist Reaumur VVe may find on some of our trees leaves rolled up much like those here figured from Reau murs work entitled ¦¦Memoires pour servir a VHistoire Natii relle des Insects and which are copied from Figuiers work The Insect World Figure 48 represents an oak leaf which has been partially Fig 48 Fig 49 Oak leaf rolled perpendicularly and sidewise rolled np transversel We can see with what care the leaf has been rolled up and how at each step the roll has been secured by bundles of silken strands A similar roll is seen Fig 50 Sorrel leaf cut by a caterpillar at figure 49 where the leaf has been rolled sidewise or lon gitudinally to the leaf with the same painstaking Another species Reaumur found to roll a portion of a sorrel leaf cut ting it away from the side of the leaf and then deftly rolling it up into a slender cone which stands up nearly on its base Fig 51 Fig 52 Willow leavcs rolled by a caterpillar and section Fig 50 An example of a less perfect roll and one inter mediate in perfection between the foregoing nests and the tent of the common garden Tortrix is shown in the accom panying figure 51 of a number of willow leaves rolled up by a caterpillar wliile figure 52 gives a transverse section of the same compound roll with the outer threads binding the simple rolls into a bundle Our garden leafroller can be best subdued by hand picking It is easy to detect the tents and a simple matter to remove the worm arid crush it under foot The Leaf Cutter Bee The leaves of the rose bushes in the garden are sometimes strangely cut into as if some fairy had overnight deftly cut them with her wanton scissors To Fig 53 The Leaf Cutter Bee and nest many this fact is a sore puzzle It is due to a leafroller of quite a different sort from any we have before considered The figure 53 after Figuier represents the Loaf Cutter Bee cutting out a circular piece of leaf with her scissorslike jaws while the nest composed of numerous pieces variously folded and pressed together attests her wonderful skill and forethought IN continuing these halfhour talks about insects some remarks upon the more direct relations of these little beings to human interests may not be inappropriate We may from our moral and intellectual heights look down upon the lower world of insects as did the gods and demi gods of old frona Olympus upon their halfbrothers and cousinsgerman on the plains below For physically are we not related to the insects Remotely it is true but still wc have perhaps branched off from a common stock the starting point some monad Our blood differs in qual ity and not in kind our muscles are but repetitions in structure of the flesh of insects and finall an insect at the outset is but a drop of oil and albumen or proto plasm and from what else does man originate Allied as he is also to the beasts and lower animals in being at times under the control of fierce passions and animal propensities while morally and intellectually the noblest work of the Creator one effect of the recent advances in the science of man which indicate that his animal origin is a matter of strong probability will be to draw out his interest in the humbler creatures to lead him to deal with them more sym pathetically to love his domesticated animals more wisely and truly while he may not the less by worship of his Cre ator and work for humanity strengthen the diviner impulses of his nature lie priyeth well who lovcth well Both niaa and bird and beast Every true naturalist is an exofficio member of the Society for the rrevcntion of Cruelty to Animals He will not lcat his horse or dog any more than his own children Rather will he endeavor to train them by the power of kindness than by the force of blows So in the dealings of civilized with savage man the legiti mate results of a proper study of anthropology or the science of man while teaching us that there are different grades of intellect and moral sense in tlie different races of man as in the members of our own families where each may re quire a different mode of education though all are eiually loved by their parents will lead us to observe the primary law of international behavior the law of love Each may require a different mode of treatment while all must be re garded as men and brothers Though one race under a favoring heaven and superior mental organization stands superior to another yet if many naturalists are right all have had a common monkey origin and the European or American of today need not despise his Bushman or Australian brother who is perhaps but a few removes nearer his simian ancestors than himself So all the animal creation is of a piece part and parcel of one grand Divine plan Some philosophers and theologians even ascribe immortality to the animals and believe that in the hereafter we shall hear the song of the mosquito the hum of the bee and the shrill rolling drumbeat of the ci cada Insects are related to us in a thousand ways and some how either by themselves or through their products they are more than we should at first imagine constantly in our daily thoughts Beau Brummels cravat which historians tell us absorbed no small proportion of his thoughts in his waking moments was spun by a silkworm A spiders web tradi tion says saved King Robert Bruce in his sleep Thou sands of peole in the P2ast are dependent for life on locusts and wild honey Is the potato beetle an unimportant per sonage in the west And in the south are not hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of cotton annually devoured by the arm worm In the New England states is not the face of nature almost transformed by the ravages of the canker worm How life to many would be glorified and this world seem a brighter one if the flea the louse and the bedbug were removed from its surface How much difference would it make to the world of insects were man to be llotted out of existence We imagine the insects would look with as much indifference upon his re moval as we in turn regard the demise of a mosquito Have not through the ages past from the time when the first grasshopper chirped upon a tree ferns leaf in the Devonian forests of New Brunswick millions of species of insects had their day and died with no human being to witness them Imagine the eons and eons of measured eternity through Avhich by day and night the busy hum of insect life has risen and fallen with no human ear to listen But on the other hand blot out those busy servants of ours the bees the mjri ads of insects that aid in fertilizing our vegetables and fruit trees the silkworm whose products form so large an item in the commercial greatness of the East and of Southern Europe the lac and dye insects those that produce galls for making ink the myriads of grubs and flies that act as scavengers and purify the air saving us from pestilence all working so quietly and effectively that few appreciate how much we owe to them blot out all of these and the world would be a poor home for its owner man He would be forced then if never before to appreciate the place of man in creation and would be taught that as an animal his life touches at many points the lives and interests of the humlle creatures about him We naturall divide insects into friends and foes but our senses are still quite uninstructed in distinguishing them and few but the trained entomologist can go into the field or garden and mark this insect as a true friend and that so much like the other that ordinary e3es cannot distinguish them apart as an enemy of our comfort or crops Moreover there are Insects which are friendly in but a Piclv wickian sense There are certain parasitic insects that sticlv to us closer than a brother and yet with the moral qualities of fiends Man is a sort of treasury or bank to these crea tures and they are happily few in number who draw upon him not only at sight but who go it blind And when through carelessness or idleness the bank is too attrac tive and liberal in its discounts the audacious vermin congre gate in teeming hosts and make a run upon it Parasitic insects seem in many cases to be actually blind through ava rice as amaurosis is not an uncommon affection Fig 54 among articulated parasites It would seem as if the gods struck blind all such beings for their greed in sucking our blood There is the louse Fig 54 the most intimate of these friends forsooth of ours Ugly and repulsive in itself it is tenfold more so in its associations Though its legs are well devel oped the beak wonderfully adapted for its use vet it lives in a Stygian twilight its eyes re Louse duced to a simple pomt a little depression on the side of its head forming but a single isolated facet the simplest kind of eye when there are 25088 such facets in the eye of a certain small beetle Mordella and 4000 in that of the house fly whose head is all eyes If we look at the beak of the louse Fig 55 we shall at once perceive that the creature does not bite but that it in reality sucks onr blood so the mosquito introduces its bladelike jaws and sucks our blood It is incorrect to say that a mosquito bites Those organs that in allied insects are jaws in the lice lose their biting function and are converted into a fleshy extensible tube the true jaws forming ribbonlike bands strengthening the tube When looking about for a weak place in the skin of his host the creature alights upon a sweat pore Into this he plunges his sucker and anchors it there iig 5 by a number of hooks Fig 55 ee After they have firmly grasped the surrounding flesh the first pair of bris tles the real mandibles transformed are protruded we are quoting Prof Schiodte here almost word for word as given in the American Naturalist vol iv p 86 These bristles are towards their points united by a mem brane so as to form a closed tube AVhen the whole instrument is exserted we perceive a long membranous flex ible tube the portion from ef and including the end hanging down from the under lip labium and along the walls of this tube the bristlelike jaws in the form of narrow bands of chitine In this way says Schiodte the suck ing tube can be made longer or shorter as required and easil adjusted to the thickness of the skin in the particular place where the animal is sucking whereby access to the capillary system is secured at any part of the body It is apparent from the whole struc ture of the instrument that it is by no means calculated for being used as a sting but is rather to be compared to a delicate elastic probe in the use of which the terminal lobes probably serve as feelers As soon as the capillary system is reached the blood will at once ascend into the narrow tube after 5 MouUi of a Louse which the current is continued with increasing rapidity by means of the pulsation of tlie pumping ventricle and the powerful peristaltic movement of the digestive tube Fig 55 shows this tube and adjacent parts of the head magnified one hundred and sixty times aa the end of the head bb the chitinous band and c the base of the under lip d the under lip protruded with the hooks ee and the sucking tube with a few blood disks passing through it How a louse breathes is perhaps as practical a question as how it bites All insects inliale air through a row of holes stigmata in the side of the body which connect by a series of tubes tracheae within ramifying throughout the body no air is taken in through the mouth Now grease and oil when in contact with the sides of the body tend to close up these breathing holes and then the creature suffo cates Thus oil or pomatum is an antidote A woid to the wise is sufficient Not only personally but also indirectly through those kinds which swarm on his domestic fowls and quadrupeds is man affected by these creatures Those species which live for the most part on birds have true jaws enabling them to nibble and thus irritate the skin of their host While we are upon this harassing theme we should not pass over that kindred subject the bedbug This insect with a body so flat that an ordinary punch with the thumb only seems to tickle it seems preordained for a life in cracks and crannies First noticed in literature by Aristotle it was also mentioned by Dioscorides and Pliny It was first met with in Germany in the eleventh or twelfth century and was mentioned as an English insect by Mouffct in 1503 It is possible that its original haunt was the nests of doves and swallows and the most effective way should it seem desirable to ensure an abundant harvest of these pests is to keep a number of these birds about our houses Whether it actually lives under the feathers of doves or not could be easily ascertained If so tlien they are as truly bird para sites as the lice to which they are especially Avhen young not remotely allied in form and structure That they or a closely allied species sometimes swarm in the nests of swallows we have been informed by a gentleman in Iowa who found a nest of swallows as stated in the Guide to the Study of Insects on the outside of a court house which swarmed with bedbugs and they were not conGned to the nest but flocked in the apartments frequently serving well pointed bills of ejectment against the legal gentlemen within They continued to trouble the occupants year after jcar until the stream of hemipterous life was traced to its fountain head the swallows nests The opinion that the bedbug originally lived under the feathers of house haunting semidomestic birds is strengthened by the fact that a European species of Cimex lives on the body of the swallow another on the bat while a third is found in pigeon houses and is named from that fact the Cimex of dove cotes Cimex columbarius We have in this country a flat bodied red bug closely allied to the true bedbug but its habits are quite unknown We need not tell harrowing tales of the disgusting habits of this scourge for are there not fresh experiences in the minds of those who travel most in the more unsettled portions of our country as well as the other parts of the globe A word or two on some less known traits of this creature may give some useful hints in dealing with it The parent lays white oval eggs and when tlie young bug is fully formed within it escapes by pushing off the end like a lid as one pushes up a trap door The young are at first whitish and transparent the stomach being visible usually red from being filled with blood and at this time it bears a striking resem blance to a louse Westwood sa3s that it is eleven weeks in attaining its full size The adult is hard lived in a double sense its tenacity of life is only equalled by its viciousness The Swedish Count Degeer ia his classic Memoires pub lished a century ago says that he kept full sized individ uals in a sealed bottle for more than a year Avithout food Dr Landois has recently ascertained how these insects are enabled to fast so long He observed that as in the flea and louse the blood drawn in from their victims collecting in the small intestine loses its cells and forms a blackish mass which remains for months unaltered Thus after the bug has fully gorged itself it has Avithin its small intes tine a reservoir on which it may live a long time But happily though few may be aware of it the bedbug has a natural enemy the cockroach whose mission it Fig 56 Fig 57 Keduvius pupa and young seems to be to keep this and other insects in check What then if the cockroach nibbles our towels and clothes occa sionally when driven through stress of hunger The cock roach is particularly valuable on shipboard by reason of its insectivorous habits The Eeduvius Fig 56 pupa is also said to prey upon the bedbug Degeer tells us that the wingless young Fig 57 have the instinct to en velop themselves in a thick coating of particles of dust and so completely adds Westwood do they exercise this habit that a specimen shut up by M Brulle and which had undergone one of its moultings during its imprisonment divested its old skin of its coat of dust in order to recover itself therewith Does the bedbug poison us when it bites So we may ask whether the flea mosquito and black fly convey a drop of poison into the punctured wound they make This is a disputed point Dr Landois however the latest writer on this subject thinks that when the creature is sucking a part of the salivary fluid can easily pass into the wound and it is not unlikely that the red stains that we often see appearing after a sting on the hands of sensitive persons originate from the saliva which flows into the wound and acts as a poison Other hemipterous insects he adds are dreaded on account of their sting ¦Cimex nemorum accord ing to Kirby stings as powerfully as a wasp and Notonecta glauca stings with a burning sensation St Pierre found in the Mauritius bugs whose sting was as poisonous as that of a scorpion giving rise to swellings the size of a doves egg and which lasted for five days Another sort of bug is sometimes according to Mr Riley found in beds in the western states It is the Conorhhius sanguisuga It is much larger than the common bedbug and its bite is much more painful It belongs to quite a different group of hemipterous insects and is allied to the Reduvius of wliich we have spoken Passing by the flea and the itch mites which end the list of human parasites and whose habits and appearance are so well known we will dwell fur a few moments on the poison ous insects which trouble man The ioison of all insects judging from the chemical comiosition of that of a few kinds which has been analyzed is alkaline in its nature and has for its main ingredient formic acid a substance peculiar to the secretions of insects The sting of the bee is simply a modified form of the ovi positor of the ichneumon fly Fig 58 from Ilguier and the saw of the saw fly It is composed of three pairs of slender blades the innermost forming the sting proper being barbed at the end so that when darted into the flesh of its victim it often remains and the bee stings but once The poison gland or bag empties into the sting the poison ous fluid being forced by the pressure of the walls of the body upon the sac there being apparently no special muscles Ichneiinioa Fly adapted for the purpose The sting of the wasp is like that of the bee The celebrated Reaumur as quoted by M Tandon thus discourses on the effect of the sting of wasps on himself and his servant Being stung by a wasp I thought I might gain something from his infliction by bear ing it with a good grace I allowed the animal to wound me at his leisure when he had withdrawn his sting of his own accord I irritated and jjlaced him on the hand of a domestic who Avas not expecting to be stung but the wound did not cause him much pain I then made the wasp sting me a second time when I scarcely felt it The poisonous fluid was nearly exhausted by the former experiments and I could not induce the wasp to make a fourth wound This experiment and others which people will probably not care to repeat have taught me that where the animals are undis turbed the sting is never left in the wound The sting is flexible and is not driven straight in but forms a curved or zigzag wound If the insect is compelled to withdraw it suddenly the friction is sufficient to retain the sting which is somewhat hooked and tears it off On the other hand if the animal is not disturbed it withdraws the sting grad ually There is quite a difference in the poisonous qualities of different kinds of bees as well as wasps and in the size and strength of the sting We have been used to catching wild bees and wasps without being stung by firmly grasping the hind body or abdomen with our fingers rendering the sting powerless How useful the sting is to bees is shown in the honey bee which uses it as a weapon of offence as well as defence in stinging the caterpillars of the bee moth Avhich are careful to run concealed galleries in the wax to avoid their thrusts and in killing the drones The term waspish is derived from the irritable nature of those insects whose brusque and defiant manners are doubt less in large part due to the consciousness that they are well armed But in many wasps the sting is not only a weapon of defence but of prime importance in maintaining the ex istence of their young and consequently of the life of the species We have spent hours watching a Sphex wasp Sphex ichneumonea Fig 59 a large rustred species covered with dense golden hairs busily engaged in digging its hole in a gravelly walk Away it worked in a lusty hearty manner literally tooth and nail removing the larger bits of gravel with its large curved sicklelike jaws and as it finally tunnelled itself out of sight it would often back up out of its hole and scratch and shovel the dirt out with its fore and hind legs pushing back the dirt from the mouth of its hole with its long hairy hind legs As soon as its hole was a few inches deep perhaps four or five it flew off to the grassy bank close by and immediately returned with a green Fig 59 Sphex Wasp grasshopper which it had evidently stung and paralyzed as it did not kick and struggle It disappeared for a few min utes in its hole long enough apparently to lay an egg in the bod of the grasshopper which was destined only to awake from its deathlike lethargy to find itself the prey of the young Sphex That the sting of the wasp is so wonderfully guided as to pierce one of the nervous centres ganglia of the grass hopper so that the insect is paralyzed is proved by the ob servations of a French naturalist Fabre who has given us a charmingly written account of his experiences with a wasp called Cerceris which had been known to sting and conse quently paralyze its prey consisting of the larva or grub of a certain weevil M Fabre waylaid a Cerceris returning with her booty and substituted a fresh uninjured weevil grub for the one paralyzed This experiment succeeded to admiration As soon as the Cerceris perceived her prey to have slipped from her grasp she struck the earth with her feet and turned impatiently hither and thither then sud denly perceiving the living curcullo placed close to her by M Fabre pounced upon it and proceeded to carry it off Instantlj however discovering it to be still uninjured she placed herself face to face with it seized its rostrum be tween her powerful mandibles and pressed her fore legs heavily upon its back as if to cause the opening of some ventral articulation Quickly then she slid her abdomen beneath the curculio and struck her venomous dart sharply twice or thrice into the joint of the prot4aorax between the first and second pair of legs In one second without a con vulsive movement without those twitches of the limbs which generally accompany the death agony of any animal the victim dropped motionless struck as if by lightning The Cerceris then turning the apparently lifeless insect on its back embraced it as before described and bore it away in triumph Three times did M Fabre repeat this interesting experiment each time with precisely similar results It must be clearly understood that on each occasion he re stored to the Cerceris her original captive and took pos session of that which he had himself provided in order to examine it at his leisure Greatly did he marvel at the dex terity with which the fatal stroke had been dealt Not the slightest trace of a wound was to be found not the least drop of vital liquid spilt The puncture made by the sting of the Cerceris is indeed so microscopic that chemistry can furnish no poison sufficiently powerful to produce with so small a quantity so startling an effect and it is in fact not so much to the Aenom of the dart as to the phjsiological im portance of the exact point at which it enters that we must ascribe the cessation so complete so instantaneous of all active life In most insects there are three ganglia which furnish the nerves of the wings and legs and on which the power of movement principally depends The first that of the pro thorax is distinct from the others in all Coleoptera but the last two those of the meso and metathordx though generally separate are in some species united Now it is a wellknown fact that in most cases the more closely the nervous sjstem is united centralized as it were tho more perfect are the animal functions and also of course the more easily vulnerable Therefore the Cerceris whose instinct teaches her at one stroke to annihilate these functions chooses her victims precisely from the species in which this centralization is most complete In order completely to establish his opinion it remained for M Fabre to prove that he could by similar means pro duce a similar result And this he found himself able to psrfoira with perfect ease by puncturing the insect with a needle dipped in ammonia at the prothoracic joint behind the first pair of legs Any corrosive liquid applied to the thoracic medullary centre would have the same effect His experiments were made upon the grubs of various beetles In the case of Scarabaii Buprestes and Curculionldn the effect of his experiments was instantaneous all motion ceased suddenly without a single convulsion at the instant the fatal drop touched the medullary centre Not the dart of the Cerceris herself could have a more prompt or last ing effect Notwithstanding their complete immobility M Fabres victims remained alive for tSree weeks or a month preserving the flexibility of all their joints and the normal freshness of their viscera My own observations on finother wasp Ochjnerns aIbo2JIia leratus which makes its round cells of clay placing them for safety in the 1 ose nest of the American Tent Caterpillar have shown me that Fabres account must be correct On opening these cells they were found to be filled with minute caterpillars which were in various stages of growth between the fully formed caterpillar and the chrysalis The were alive but benumbed and in some cases with life enough to finish their transformations into the chrysalis state Here they were waiting patiently each for his turn to be devoured by the young wasp What a marvellous instinct on the part of the wasp and how much more wonderful when we remem ber that this is a habit of but certain groups of wasps and that it must have been acquired by fig 60 them from some ancestor which had to find out for itself the secret of sting ing its victim so as to simply paralyze and not kill outright the luckless subject of the experiment Again was the discovery made by accident or did our ancestral wasp go about it like a philosopher and after conducting a series of experi ments guided by the scientific use of the imaginatioti alight finally upon just the weak siot in its victims harness in which to insert its sting This thought may be consid ered as twaddle by some but in all seriousness Ave would say that nature must have had that insect in training Anj one who has observed a wasp building its nest or a Chr3sis wasp Fig 60 exploring the nail holes in a post with its inquisitive sting combining the terrible qualities of a poisoned dagger with the delicate touch of a finger and then imagines the series of deductions following each trial of the sting the momentous result attending the exploita tion to the future weal of the Chrysis family and the ulti mate good to the species how can he say that there we have not a reasoning being under the tuition of natures laws In like manner the Tarantula Killer Pompilus formosus Fig Gl according to an exceedingly interesting account published by Dr Lincecum in the American Naturalist May 1SG7 attacks that immense spider the Mygale Ilevt zii Fig 61 paralyzes it with its formidable sting and in serting an egg in its body places it in its nest dug to the Fig 61 Tarantula Killer depth of five inches There are hundreds of other species of wasps thus solely dependent on the adroit use of their stings for the means of providing for their offspring The poison of the spider which is seldom fatal to man is lodged in a little gland or sac situated in the headthorax and Avhich opens into the jaws which are hollow perforated at the end so as to allow the poison to flow into the wound made by the mandible But very few spiders are poisonous 16 to man Hentz our best American authority after twenty years of study declare that spiders were not poisonous to man Bhickwall the English authority says that none in England are poisonous as he allowed them to Lite him ou Fig C2 Trap door Spider Mygale different parts of his person without any harm resulting Occasionally we see deaths reported from the bite of spiders A late number of Nature contains a notice of the Katipo or venomous spider of New Zealand Its bite is occa 6 17 sionally fatal and certainly very painful and distressing This spider belongs to the genns Latrodectus and AValck onaer says the same journal writing of the Latrodectus malmignatics an allied species common in Sardinia and Cor sica and parts of Italy remarks This spider is certainly poisonous its bite they sa causes in man pain lethargy and sometimes fever A species of the same genus which lives in Georgia is said by Ilentz and not Abbot as ISiature says to have an undoubtedly venomous bite As regards the bite and habits of the scorpion the testi mony of Anderssen the African traveller may be cited as the common experience of inhabitants in the tropics lie says Tlie instant the scorpion feels himself in contact with any part of tlic body of a man or beast he lifts his tail and with his horny sting inflicts a wound which though rarely fatal is still of a painful nature Like the snake the scoriion is fond of warmth and it is not uncommon on awakening in the morning to find one or two of these horrid creatures snugly ensconced in the folds of the blanket or under the pillow On one occasion I killed a scorpion measuring nearly seven and a half inches in length that had thus un ceremoniousl introduced itself into my bed The poison gland of the scorpion as everybody knows is lodged in the tail The scorpion is a timorous creature and only uses its sting when alarmed Dr Lincecum has published in the American Naturalist an interesting account of the scorpion of Texas a figure of which we reproduce Fig G3 He says that it dwells under old logs rocks in old stumps under the bark of dead trees under old fences Itetween the shingles on housetops and par ticularly about the jambs and hearths of fireplaces In tem per they are hasty and will employ their weapons on slight occasions The pain caused by their venom when injected into ones flesh is very quickly felt and quite severe giving the idea of a burninghot fluid thrown into the system It does not last long nor does it swell much and is not so pain ful nor does it produce so much iuconvenience as the sting of the honey bee In countries where they abound people do not regard them with much terror Chickens are very fond of them and voraciously devour every one they can find The scorpion brings forth its young alive The centipede is an annoying and even dangerous insect the poison glands are lodged in the head opening into the Fig C3 American Scorpion channelled jaws as in the spiders The bite of the larger species is most formidable Few are aware how painful and anno3ing is the irritation set up by the hairs of certain caterpillars The hairs of many kinds are finely barbed such are those of the Ctenucha figured in our frontispiece The caterpillar feeds on grass and I extract from my notes an account of the mode in which it constructs its cocoon tearing its slender barbed 10 84 hairs from its body and dextrously weaving them into a firm texture without the aid of silken threads the hairs being held firmly in place by the barbs June 13th the Ctenucha larva began to construct its co coon Early in the morning it described an ellipse upon the side of the glass vessel of hairs plucked from just behind the head From this elliptical line as a base it had by eight oclock built up rather unequally the wall of its cocoon in some places a third of the distance up by simply piling upon each other the spinulated hairs which adhered firmly to gether At four oclock in the afternoon the arch was com pleted and the larva walled in by a light thin partition Soon afterwards the thin floor was made No silk is spun throughout the whole operation I afterwards carefully ex amined portions of the cocoon under the microscope and could detect no threads of any kind From this it will appear that aside from their defensive nature these barbed hairs come into play when the insect prepares to lay aside its caterpillar skin like an old garment and go into retirement as a chrjsalis So also the hairs of the woolly bear caterpillar Arctia Isabella and of the common Vanessa butterfly Vanessa Antiopa are poisonous to children The caterpillar of another moth the Emietla stimulea is said by Dr Clemens to be very annoying The spines with which the horns are supplied produce an exceedingly painful sensation when they come in contact with the back of the hand or any portion of the body in which the skin is thin The caterpillar of the lo moth Tlypercheiria lo Fig G4 65 a 6 c spines which feeds commonly on corn in the southern states though in New England it feeds on the maple is covered with stinging hairs which are often pain ful when detached The caterpillar of the Maia moth Hemileuca Maia Fig 66 a caterpillar is armed with still more annoying spines We are indebted to Mr J A Lintner for an excellent ac count of certain experiments with this caterpillar which Fig G4 Caterpillar of lo Jloth after Kiley we copy from his paper in the Report of the New York State Cabinet for ISGO He remarks that a larva was 21 8G dropped three or four times from a height of about ten inches upon the bacli of the first joint of the thumb The sensation did not differ materially in kind from the sting of the nettle but was more acute In a few minutes the sur face became reddened and in a short time numerous sliglitly elevated whitish blotches made their appearance accompa nied with a burning and itching The following day the thumb could not be bent without experiencing a sensible Fig CG 3y a ¦ i Caterpillar and Pupa of Maia Moth after Riley degree of pain which was materially increased by an attempt to bring the joint to a right angle This stiffness of the joint continued for four days When the blotches subsided small purplish spots of coagulated blood appeared in their place which by degrees became more circumscribed until after the lapse of a few days when they presented an appear ance similar to that of grains of gunpowder burned beneath the skin These gradually disappeared those nearer the surface by a scaling of the skin above theni those deeper removed by the slower process of absorption were visible at least two weeks When the larva was permitted to fall upon the thicker skin of the palm of the hand a slight stinging sonsation was experienced and minute purple dots wcre developed continuing a shorter time than the above The sting is doubtless the result not of broken tips of the spines remaining in the flesh for none such could be observed by careful scrutiny with a lens but of a poison secreted by the larva and probably injected through a mi nute aperture in the tip of the spine Whether its excretion is voluntary or involuntary was not determined it not having occurred to institute the simple experiment by which that point could readily have been ascertained A slight motion of the larva apparently a contractile one was fre quently observed to accompany the sting but this may have been either defensive or simply the consequence of alarm at being rudelj touched Some tips of the spines clipped off and placed between slides under a high magnifying power showed under varying pressure a motion of fluid within them but no apical opening could be discovered for its escape The ability to inflict a sting does not belong to all the spines of the larva but ordy to those of the two subdorsal rows on segments three to ten and the dorsal spine on seg ment eleven These differ from those elsewhere on the body in their fascicular arrangement their lesser length the regular taper of the branches and their tawny color as ap pears in detail in the description given of the mature larva With tills interesting structural peculiarity in mind the larva may be handled with impunity as was repeatedly done with the fift or more individuals composing the colony from which these notes were drawn in the frequent transfers which tliey That a poison is secreted seems to us improbable required as they approaelied maturity to fresh food and cleansed quarters With proper care the thumb and fingers could safelj be passed along their sides and beneath them slowly raising them from the leaf or stem to which they were attached but if attempted too hastily the larva throws it self in a circle projects its defensive armor and inflicts a sting which effectually releases it from the grasp Now while nature has protected these caterpillars from their insect enemies though certain ichneumon flies prey upon them they seem whether by reason of their spiny hairs or stiff bristles or other cause to be distasteful to birds We are not aware how different are the tastes of birds for different food as with us so with birds de gustibus non dis putandum We observe how different and arbitrary are the tastes of the dog or horse or cat so wild animals including birds have their individual preferences and dislikes for cer tain kinds of food Certain it is that there are many kinds of caterpillars which birds will not eat The false cater pillar of the cherry sawfly Selandria cerasi is said b Pro fessor Winchell to be never eaten b birds The currant saw fly worm now so destructive in our gardens is not eaten by birds In my First Annual Report on the Injurious and Beneficial Insects of Massachusetts 1871 occur the follow ing remarks on this point As this is an important and practical subject let us digress for a moment to notice some facts brought out by Mr J J Weir of the London Entomological Societ on the insects that seem distasteful to birds He finds by caging up birds whose food is of a mixed character purely insecteating birds could not be kept alive in confinement that all hairy caterpillars were uniformly uneaten such caterpillars are the yellow bears Arctia and Spilosoma the saltmarsh caterpillars Leu carctia acraca and the caterpillar of the vaporer moth Orgyia and the spring laivre of butterflies with these may perhaps be classed the European currant sawfly was disposed to consider that the flavor of all these cater pillars is nauseous and not that the mechanical trouble someness of the hairs prevents their being eaten Larvte which spin webs and are gregarious are eaten by birds but not with avidity they appear very much to dislike the web sticking to their beaks and those completely concealed in the web are left unmolested When certain branches cov ered with the web of Iluponomeuta evonymella a little moth of the Tinea family were introduced into the aviary those larvaj only which ventured bejond the protection of the web were eaten Smoothskinned gayljcolored caterpillars such as the currant Abraxas or span worm Fig 39 which never con ceal themselves but on the contrary appear to court obser vation Avere not touched by the birds He states on the other hand that all caterpillars whose habits are nocturnal and are dullcolored with fleshy bodies and smooth skins are eaten with the greatest avidity Every species of green caterpillar is also much relished All Geometrae whose larvae resemble twigs as they stand out from the plant on their anal prolegs are invariably eaten Mr A G Butler of London has also found that frogs and spiders will not eat the same larvse rejected by birds the frogs having an especial aversion to the currant span worms Abraxas and Halia Before leaving the subject of poisonous insects we maj refer to those which are indirectly so Professor Leidy has as we find in the American Naturalist vol vi p C94 entertained the opinion that flies are probably a means of communicating contagious disease to a greater degree than was generally suspected From what he ob served in one of the large military hospitals in which hos pital gangrene had existed during the late rebellion he thought flies should be carefully excluded from wounds Recently he noticed some flies greedily sipping the diflhient matter of some fungi of the Phallus impudicus He caught 25 90 TACKkKD several and found that on holding them by the wings tlioy would exude two or three drops of liquid from the proboscis whicli examined by the microscope were found to swarm with the spores of the fungus The stomach was likewise filled with the same liquid swarming with spores Among other insects which frequently annoy travellers in the southern states and in the tropics are the ticks Fig G7 It is the habit of these beings to climb up bushes and stalks of grass and attach themselves by means of their outstretched legs to whatever animal passes by whether a Fig G7 CatUe Tick enlarged beast or lizard or snake as they occur on all creeping ani mals Having attached themselves by their jaws to the skin they burrow beneath it causing a painful tumor It is difficult to pull them out as they are anchored in the flesh by their manybarbed tongue We turn again to Anderssens narrative for an account of the plague this tick ma be to the wanderer in Africa Besides rajriads of fleas our encampment swarmed with a species of bushtick whose bite was so severe and irrita ting as almost to drive us mad To escape if possible the  horriblo persecutions of these bloodtliirsty creatures I took refuge one night in the cart and was congratulating myself on having at last secured a place free from their attacks But I was mistaken I had not been long asleep before I was awakened by a disagreeable irritation over my whole body which shortly became intolerable and notwithstand ing the night air was very sharp and the dew heavy I cast off all my clothes and rolled on the icycold sand till the blood flowed freely from every pore Strange as it may appear I found this expedient serviceable On another occasion a bushtick but of a still more poi sonous species attached itself to one of my feet and though a stinging sensation was produced I never thought of examining the part till one day when enjoying the unu sual luxury of a cold bath I accidentally discovered the in truder deeply buried in the flesh and it was only with very great pain that I succeeded in extracting it or rather its body for the head remained in the wound The poisonous effect of its bite was so acrimonious as to cause partial lameness for the three following months The bushtick docs not confine its attacks to men only for it attaches itself with even greater pertinacity to the inferior animals Many a poor dog have I seen killed by its relentless persecutions and even the sturdy ox has been known to succumb under the poisonous influence of these insects Sometimes also while one bivouacs on the ground these ticks will enter the ear and become exceedingly troublesome These and other insect intruders can be made to leave their retreats by pouring a drop of oil into the ear Fig G7 gives an excellent idea of the common cattle tick of the south when gorged with blood The lower figure represents the tick when younger and after fasting The upper figure is of the natural size the lower several times en larged Fig G8 adult and sixlcggcd young Fig GD shows the mouth parts much enlarged with the spiny tongue 27 92 HALF HOUES WITH INSECTS Ticks are gigantic mites The smallei mites are in some rare cases found even in the veins and arteries of Aarious birds Among the mites belong the itch mite and an allied Fig G8 Fig C9 Tick and sxlegged young form the Acaropsis Ilerfcourti was found in the pimples on the skin of a French officer who had been in Havana Cuba and was afflicted with an exanthematous eruption M Tan no 70 clou who figures the mite thinks that it is a kind peculiar to this exanthema We haAe seen a simi VC lar though probably different mite taken from the nose of a person in New Orleans We might before leaving this subject draw attention to the accompa nying figure of a long slender mite Fig 70 Demo dex folUcidorwii sometimes found in the follicles of the face But there is a brighter side to the picture In sects are not all leagued together to destroy our com fort and rob our pockets There is the honey bee one of our domestic animals if well treated patient and kind ceaselessly at work for our benefit Ilcr life is a con stant lesson of thrift and industry Thanks to Messrs  Langstroth Quimby and AYagner bee culture has become with us oue of the fine arts iu agriculture and a few hives are necessaiy adjuncts to a well conducted farm The pro duction of honey and wax has enormously increased in this countr and it is to be hoped that out of the thousands who keep bees one or two at least may arise who like Iluber Siebold Leuckart Dzierzon and Berlepsch in the old world nia advance our knowledge of the economy of the bee and its modes of reproduction so intricate and wonderful and thus lay still broader and deeper the foundations of scien tific bee culture We need not here speak at length on a subject so familiar to many as the structure and habits of the honey bee and of the various other kinds of bees which store up honey One point however and an important one has quite recently been cleared up by a German naturalist Professor Claus The production of wax is a most important part of bee culture especially in Catholic countries where so nian candles are used in churches It is well known that the secretion of wax is carried on during the time when the workers are engaged in building their combs We are all familiar at least through pictures with the festoons of bees hanging from the top of their hives During this time of repose the secretion of the little disks of wax goes on IIow is the wax secreted The best authorities have diftered on this important point On the one hand MilneEdwards the distinguished French naturalist supposed that the wax secreting apparatus consisted of special glands while an equally eminent German Von Siebold thought that no such glands existed A countryman of Von Siebold however Prof Claus has from special investigations of his own confirmed MilneEdwards suppositions I quote from a translation of a part of Claus article in the Guide to the Study of Insects The waxsecreting apparatus consists of special dermal glands as MilneEdwards supposed Claus has shown sec Gegcnbaurs Vergleichenden Anatomic that 29 94 HALF HOURS WETH JXSECTS IPacicatd these minute glands are mostly unicellular the external opening being through a fine chitinons tube on the outer sur face of the integument In the waxproducing insects the glands are developed in great numbers over certain portions of the body In the Aphides whose bodies are covered with a powder consisting of fine waxy threads these glands are collected in groups Modifications of them appear in the Coccidse In the waxproducing Hjanenoptera the apparatus is somewhat complicated The bees secrete wax in thin transparent membranous plates on the under side of the abdominal segments Polygonal areas are formed by the openings of an extraordinarily large number of fine pore canals in which surrounded by very numerous tracheal branches the C3dindrical gland cells are densel piled upon each other These form the wax organs over which a fatty lajer spreads In those bees which do not produce wax the glands of the wax organs are slightly developed Wax organs also occur in the humble bees I find in the Academy for Feb 13 1873 that Dr Von Schneider is of the opinion that wax which he thinks is undoubtedly a secretion of the honey bee is formed chiefly at the ex pense of different kinds of sugar but he considers that the production of wax from sugar cannot be maintained without simultaneous access to food containing nitrogen As regards the mode of production of honey which we are much in the dark about as we haAe heretofore only known that it is elaborated by some unknown chemical proc ess from the food contained in the crop and Avhich is re gurgitated into the honey cells Von Siebold throws more light upon it by his able anatomical researches aided by tlie chemist Von Schneider From the Academy we learn that at the annual agricultural meeting held in Oc tober 1871 at Munich a well known apiarian Ilerr Meh ring exhibited a peculiar kind of honey that he named KunstHonig artificial honey and which he had produced by feeding his bees exclusively with malt This honey excited great interest and the question was raised whether this substance was real honey and whether consequently the bee was able to change maltsugar in its stomach into honey Dr Von Schneider arrived at the conclusion that the carbohydrates sucrose and dextrose contained in the malt are actually changed by the bee into honey sugar and that Mehrings honey only differs from other honeys in the absence of the specific aroma which is imparted to them by the flowers from which the bees have been gathering Now adds the Academy in quoting the account from the Bienen Zeitung after the fact had been established that honey and wax are not substances found as such by the bee but are productions which hae undergone chemical change through contact with the secretions of the insect Prof Von Siobold directed his attention to the investigation of the se creting organs a branch of anatomy which indeed had not been entirely neglected but which is now treated for the first time with regard to the special functions those organs appear to perform in the preparation of the products of the bee Prof Von Siebold distinguishes three entirely distinct and very complicated sjstems of salivary glands tivo of which a lower and upper are situated in the head and the third in the anterior part of the thorax the latter having been erroneously regarded by Fischer as a hing Each of them has separate excretory ducts and is distinguished by a specifically different form and organization of the vesicles secreting the saliva Each consists of a right and left glandular mass with right and left excretory ducts For the detailed account of their minute structure we must refer to the paper itself and the late accompanying it It may liowever be mentioned that this extraordinary development of the salivar organs has been observed by Prof Von Siebold in the workers only The queen possesses only a rudiment of the lower cephalic system in the form of the 3 two orifices of the ducts while the ducts themselves as well as the glands are absent and the two other systems are much less developed than in the workers In the drones not even the orifices of the lower cephalic sjstem could be found We maj now consider the other waxproducing insects whose products at first found in such minute quantities go to swell the wealth of nations as in Great Britain alone about 1000000 worth of wax is used While there is true vegetable wax formed on the berries of our Candlemas bush or Bayberry Myrica jet the pela wax of China is se creted by a certain kind of Coccus or barklouse Westwood in his Modern Classification of Insects vol ii p 449 tells us that the Coccus ceriferus Fabr described by An derson in his letters from Madras 1781 and b Pearson in the London Philosophical Transactions 1794 is employed in the production of a white wax the body of the female being enveloped in a thick and solid coat of it We have with us certain kinds of bark lice which secrete a woolly mass which envelops their body Such is the mealy bug found upon our house plants and to which we shall again refer in subsequent pages We have glanced at some of the relations of insects to ourselves and if some memories not altogether of an agree able nature have been awakened yet upon the whole it will be felt that these little beings serve some good purpose in the world and minister in many ways to our personal com fort 32 INSECTS OF THE PLANT HOUSE 07 i JitTsots of iht lUmt Jjlotxse HAVING glaiiccd at some of tlie more common insects to be observed in our walks around the garden we shall in this chapter confine ourselves to a more restricted field of observation and be content simply with some glances around the plant house a look at what may be found on the flowers in the parlor or a survey of the insects of the petunias and geraniums in the cottage window Every rose has its thorn and it may be added its Aphides the lily and azalea their Thrips and the orange and oleander their scale insects Few are the insects which afflict our house hold plants but a great deal can be said of those few He who would know something of the marvels of biolog the origin of life and of specific forms he who cares to trace anew the steps which Bonnet Chamisso Steenstrup and Owen trod in building up that wonderful theory of parthen ogenesis and learn how one insect ma through a simple budding process cast off a thronging host of young pro duced like the leaves which bud out from the tree can in his room watch the Aphides of his roses or geraniums He who would follow Herold Kiilliker Zaddach Claparede

summer we are mayhap too much diverted by the attractions which draw us from one side to another and distract our thoughts In the winter one is forced to be more of a specialist and no one but a specialist need hope to obtain a farreaching knowledge of natural phenomena The great need of this country is educated specialists We boast that everybody knows a little of everything Let every one endeavor to learn a good deal of something So good reader provide yourself with a microscope a Zentmeyers students stand we like best with an inch and a half a onehalf and a onefifth inch objective such as IMr Tolles makes a Tolles triplet and stand for holding it for ceps delicate scissors and needles mounted in handles good strong eyes a large stock of patience and fingers that are not all

creature We learn to observe much more iapidly and accuratcl b drawing the object while our thoughts are more aroused by the deliberate use of the pencil Observe the long slender feelers or antennoi those deli cate tactile organs which act at once as feelers as ears and sometimes as in the case of the carrion beetles as noses since it is b means of the sense organs lodged in the broad clubshaped feelers of these insects that they are enabled to scent their wa to the carrion in which they lay their eggs That the are delicate organs of touch any one can convince himself who observes the aphis or other insects while walk ing Scarcely a step is taken until the air and ground or twig on which it treads has been thoroughly explored by these divining rods which never fail in imparting knowledge on which their owner may be said to stake its life No one however slight his knowledge of the habits of insects will deny that the antcnne are rightly called feelers That the delicate sense of touch with which the antennai are endowed sometimes serves insects in the absence of all the other senses is shown in the case of the cave insects in some of which the eyes are entirely wanting It is not unfrequently the case that the antennte of cave insects arc much longer and more delicate than those of their fellows which live an outofdoor life Here the loss of sight has been made up to the insect by the increased sensibility of the feelers Writers on the habits of cave insects I refer particularly to the papers of the Danish naturalist Schiodte describe the extreme caution with which they explore the ground over which the arc about to walk feeling and groping in the dark for their pre or watching the movements of their adver saries in this game of llinl mans buff among the coUunns and stalactites of their grotto antennse besides being feelers are also ears has l5een proved by Prof A M Mayer At a late meeting of tiie National Academy of Sciences held in New York he made a series of exceedingly ingenious experiments which confirm the theorem of Fourier as applied by him in his propositions relating to the nature of a simple sound and to the analysis b the ear of a composite sound into its ele mentary pendulumvibrations and which elucidate the Iw pothesis of audition of Helmholtz Placing a male mosquito under the microscope and sounding various notes of tuning forks in the range of a sound given by the female mosquito the various fibres of the antennae of the male mosquito vibrated sympathetically to these sounds The longest fibres vibrated sympathetically to the grave notes and the short fibres vibrated sympathetically to the higher notes The fact that the nocturnal insects have highly organized antennre while the diurnal ones have not and also the fact that the anatomy of these parts of insects shows a highly developed nervous organization lead to the highly probable inference that Prof Mayer has here given facts which form the first sure basis of reasoning in reference to the nature of the auditory apparatus of insects These experiments were also extended in a direction which added new facts to the ph3siology of the senses If a sonorous impulse strike a fibre so that the direction of the impulse is in the direction of the fibre then the fibre remains stationary But if the direction of the sound is at right angles to the fibre the fibre vibrates with its maximum in tensity Tims when a sound strikes the fibrils of an insect those on one antenna are vibrated more powerfully than the fibrils on the other and the insect naturally turns in the di rection of that antenna which is most strongly shaken The fibrils on the other antenna aie now shaken with more and more intensity until having turned his body so that both antennas vibrate with equal intensity he has placed the axis  of his body in the direction of the sound Experiments under tlie microscope show that the mosquito can thus detect to within five degrees the position of the sonorous centre To render assurance doubly sure Prof Maer having found two fibrils of the antennae of a mosquito which vibrated pow erfully to two different notes measured these fibrils very accurately under the microscope He then constructed some fibrils out of pine wood which though two or throe feet long and of the thickness of small picturecord had exactly the same proportion of length to thickness as the fibrils of the antennae of the mosquito He found that these slender pine rods or fibrils had the same ratio of vibration to each other as the fibrils of the mosquito Here a question arises The song of the mosquito is un doubtedly a sexual call Does the male detect the presence Fig 71 Ocean Gntt of its female charmer by the different tones of her voice Certainly the ears of the male with its feathered antennae arc far more acute than those of the opposite sex the an tcnujie in her case mostly wanting those long vibratile hairs that give to him his acuteness of hearing In this case 5 102 HALF HOUKS WITH INSECTS certainly the longest ears give the greater wisdom however it may be among certain higher animals with a less number of feet than our mosquito boasts The bushy antennae of the feathered gnats Chironomus are perhaps still more acute organs of hearing than those of the mosquito and here the great difference between the antennce in the sexes may be seen by a glance at the accompanying figure 71 of the common ocean gnat of our harbors the lower figure representing the antennae of the female with their few short scattered hairs while those of the male are very bushy The feelers of many moths are delicately feathered those of the males being invariably with longer branches than in the other sex They are particularly well developed in the males of the silkworm moths as for example in the large handsome Luna moth see PI 2 representing however the female The females of this group particularly are quite stationary while the more active restless males may be seen sailing majestically through the air in the twilight If a female of this family be confined in a room or in a box out of doors numbers of suitors for her hand and heart will come from far and wide Collectors of insects take advan tage of this trait which they call assembling It is stated in an English work that an entomologist while walking out with a female Emperor moth in a box in his pocket Avas at tended by twenty or thirty males fluttering anxiously about his person They have also been known to seek their part ners held captive in the city of Manchester from a distance of ten miles out of town Now what is the faculty by which these sparks with their antennae gayly feathered and plumed and wings if not hearts fluttering wildl seek the presence of those undemonstrative if not stolid damsels It is not by the sense of sight because it is in the darkness of the night and the darker and more foggy the night the better Moreover moths cannot see through the walls of houses nor into the collecting bos in the pocket of the insect hunter 6 PACKAUD rSECTS OF THE PLANT HOUSE 103 It is not by the sense of hearing as in the mosquito for these lepidopterous damsels have not the gift of song Tiiey are silent as the Sphinx It is not 1 the sense of touch as they wing their way from places miles distant Unless it is by the sense of smell a modification it is true of the sense of touch we are unable to account for this trait of assembling That burying beetles perceive carrion at great distances through the sense of smell is not a matter of doubt and it is not unreasonable to suppose that undulations of odoriferous particles moving like waves of sound and light strike the delicate branches and hairs of the male antennae causing them to vibrate in unison and thus powerfully excite the amatory nature of these ardent suitors So much for the feelers of insects in general and those of our Aphis Fig 72 in particular Now as we are drawing Fig 72 Aphis the legs we ma notice that there are six of them attached to the sides of the middle region of the bod the thorax The number is invariably six in all winged insects The thorax consists of three segments or rings and to the side of each ring a pair of legs is attached Now the legs are tubelike jointed at intervals ending in two short toe joints In most insects there are five such joints in the toe and ten joints in all The last joint ends in a pair of long and slender claws The hind body or abdomen is full and rounded alder manic in its proportions and provided with two tubes which 7 104 HALF HOURS WITH ISECTS rACKARD project out from near the end of the body From these two tubes issues the socalled honey dew the delight of the sweet toothed ant When a brood of aphides are busily engaged in tapping the stems of some plant and the honey dew is dropphig upon the ground or leaves below a procession of sable ants enliven the scene This sweet fluid is also designed to afford nourislunent for the young as soon as hatched Both Bonnet and the Belgian naturalist Morren observed that the young Aphides as soon as born sucked up the fluid with their beaks and thrived upon that for awhile before attacking the juices of the plant itself It has been a matter of curiosity to us how this thin fluid is secreted Moiren has demonstrated that these tubes are in reality modified respirator organs as Bonnet had sup posed They are simply tubular elongations of the skin with a hole at the end into which the air enters while the sweet fluid escapes from the same hole On dissecting the little creature a task requiring much time and patience Morren found a network of air tubes tracheae near the base of each tube This tube he says is onl a prolonged stigma and it becomes evident that it is the air of these tra cheae which forces out the fluid with which this appendage is often filled At the base of the tube he also found a gland which secretes the sweet liquid The latter passes into the tube or excretory canal at the same time as the air within picsses out The viscous liquid is thus thrown out during expiration Morren tells us that he has several times seen the 3oung Aphides suck the end of these tubes while holding their beaks near it This always happened whenever I was able to have the females bring forth their young in vials Mithout any leaves to serve as food for either the young or its mother Now a gland situated on the sur face of the bod provided with an excretory canal and se creting a sweet fluid intended to nourish the young is in fact Aiiiales des Snences Nuturelles Tome P Second series ISM Paris 8 INSECTS OF THE PLANT HOUSE 105 a mammary gland and he then compares these insects in this respect to the mammals Now upon pressing the body of the Aphis placed in a drop of water in the animalcule stage we readily squeeze out the contents of the abdomen including the ovaries Instead of a numerous mass of eggs in various degrees of maturit we are astonished to see a series of young Aphides in va rious stages of development The creature brings forth its young alive Moreover the parent as Bonnet observed is a virgin No males are in existence The first brood hatch ing out in the spring are all females As soon as the leaves unfold the virgin rears its brood of young these in turn produce their spinster offspring and the number of broods is only limited by the approach of frost Finall after from eight to ten broods males and females appear the latter lay fertilized eggs by which the species is represented during the winter Such are the powers of multiplication of these Aphides that a sringborn virgin ma become tlie happy mother of a luintillion daughters and granddaughters At least such is the belief of M Fougard as quoted by Prof Morren in his well known paper Sur le Puceron du Pecher A certain species which Fougard calls Puceron lanigere produces ten viviparous generations and one oviparous gen eration PLach generation produces from ninety to one hun dred and

Regarding this estimate of what one Aphis can do to pop ulate the world Prof Huxley makes the following state ment I will assume that an Aphis weighs onethousandth of a grain which is under the mark a quintillion will on this estimate weigh a quadrillion of grains He is a very stout man who weighs two million grains consequently the tenth brood alone if all its members survive the perils to which they are exposed contains more substance than five hundred million stout men to say the least more than the whole population of China That the individual with the potential ability to produce such A mass of young only suc ceeds in leaving perhaps two eggs to represent its species at the beginning of winter all its offspring dying off is a sig nificant fact illustrating forcibl the teirible struggle for ex istence going on in the animal world I scarcely know how to present in a popular way the mode of growth of the embryo Aphis It has been Avell described by Huxley and in a more exhaustive manner by the Russian naturalist Metznikoff This study of the earliest phases in the life of an insect or in fact any animal leads us up to the very threshold of the m3sterious portals of life The problem given is a sac full of protoplasm a drop of jelly like the jelly in the cell of a plant to our eyes the same so far as our finite analysis at present extends and 3et poten tially an animal even representing the initial point of man himself How is this result attained This drop of oily jelly contains another sac filled with albumen called the nucleus Now when that mysterious act the mingling of the contents of a sperm cell with the ovarian cell or as in the virgin Aphis the act of budding the simplest genera tive process known has occurred let us with the practised eve of our Russian guide watch the behavior of the two ele ments the general oily contents of the cgg or yolk and the albuminous nucleus The original protoplasmic mass has prior to the union with a sperm cell increased in size and 10 Packaud insects of  become filled with 3olk cells or granules After fertilization the nucleus subdivides into smaller cells These seek the outer region of the egg They multiply a thousand fold become iressed together lose their character as distinctive cells and form a pale band partly or wholly surrounding the yolk mass This is the primitive band the germ which grows at the expense of the jolk cells Finally feet and jaws and antenna bud out from the band until tiie form of an Aphis is rudely sketched out Mark the fact one of the most interesting in the morphology of animals that at first the only difference between the antennaB and jaws and the legs are in their position Identical in form the antennie and jaws differ from the limbs fig 73 simpl in the fact that they are situated in front of the legs Now as each pair of appendages whether legs or jaws or antennae indicate a segment or ring we at once get a clew by which we can easily settle the question of the number of segments in the head of the winged insects Here following one another in orderly succession are four pairs of protrusions like the fingers of a glove beginning with the antenune the foremost and ending with the labium the pair next the legs So we have four segments in the head In after life the segments clearly to be seen in the embryo become so coalesced that it is impossible to define their limits In most books the head is quite wrongly counted as one segment An important point clearl demonstrated by MetznikofiT is one bearing on the question of the origin of sex It is maintained by some that wellfed caterpillars for example produce female butterflies while starved ones produce males 1 antcnnw 2 mandibles 3 flrst pair of maxilla 4 aecoud pair 57 legs 11 12 3 4 5 6 7 Embryo of Dragon Fly 108 But it is generally and correctly thought that sex is deter mined at the time of conception Now in the Aphis embryo at a stage long before even the rudiments of feet appear Metznikoff figures certain cells which are destined to form eggs and soon after the germ has acquired limbs a mass of these eggs may be plainly seen So the egg is to our eyes feminine almost as soon as it begins to grow It is interesting to watch the finishing strokes Nature puts to her master pieces Shortly before hatching the embryo so far as regaixls the mouthparts resembles that of a fly or beetle or bee nearly as much as a bug and it is to be remem bered that the beak of the Aphis is really a verj complex affair It is composed of jaws mandibles and the front pair of maxillaj which form two pairs of bristlelike organs ensheathed within the labium or under lip second maxillifi INIctznikoffs figures show us how this wonderful transforma tion of parts takes place How the mandibles and first max illae suffer an arrest of development while the second pair of maxillae are greatly enlarged and joined together to form the socalled labium or under lip until finally the parts as sume the beaklike form of tlie mature insect Thus from the simplest of beginnings the most complex results follow Give me a point on which to rest my lever said Archimedes and I will lift the world Give me a drop of protoplasm sa3s the biologist and I will con struct the world of animals and plants Let us remember that all animals as well as plants except oneceiled ones result from the subdivision of a single primitive cell and that simple as this process is yet mystery upon mystery accompanies each process What is the power that urges on the self division of cells that arranges them into forms so varied as the world presents Is life a function of proto plasm What is the difference between these sacs of pro toplasm that one becomes a plant another a monad another a fish and another to speak in the concrete a Shakspeare   or a Humboldt Simple as the process appears to our eyes the determinuig cause is still an uufathomed myster3 The humble truthseeking observer can only ponder and work on hoping that the solution may be possible to his race Cer tainly all is not known when with some naturalists and phi losophers we attempt to settle the question by saying that life is a Iunction of protoplasm though it is granted that life on this globe does not exist without it For protoplasm is po tentially a very variable substance and life a problem quite beyond the science of our day to settle whatever may be the flood of light thrown upon the question by modern science The life force existing in protoplasm is powerless witliout an Infinite intelligence and will urging it on in its destined channels just as muscular force is subject to the finite will that calls it forth Though muscular force is a function of muscle that does not account for a muscular act nor does the nerve cell or fibre account for a nervous act both are impelled by a will force not of themselves as INIatthew Arnold would say So at the outset all life may have been the re sult of chemicophysical forces producing from its elements and acting upon the compound thus produced which we call protoplasm Still this act of spontaneous generation was none the less under the guidance of an allpervading intelli gence and will Sontaneous generation is not selfcreation So the study of our little Aphides ends in starting a series of questions that haunt us each step we take some of them the largest that baffle the human reason Certainly the mind of the naturalist need not grow rusty Problems of matter and life and spirit assail him on every side and the calm ness patience and breadth of conception their consideration involves are a fitting preparation for encountering the prob lems of his own existence Our studies over now arises a practical piestion How shall we exterminate these troublesome pests In dealing with these insects in the hot house where there are no insect 13 no enemies we are left solel to our own resources so feeble compared with natures The best remedy against plant lice is to fumigate the plant house with tobacco Shirley Hib bard says that the best fumigator is one with a revolving fan or a revolving cage containing the tobacco by means of which the smoke is blown out in a rapid dense killing cloud but an effectual instrument may be extemporized by knocking a liole in the side of a large flower pot and then having put some hot cinders and damp tobacco in it the nozzle of a bellows is placed against the hole and ejection promoted by gentle puffing Drenching the leaves with a syringe or Fig 74 Fig 75 INIealy bug female Scale insect young hose throwing hot water 150° F on them is the best remedy against all plant house pests After the drenching sprinkle powdered tobacco over the leaves Scale Insects If we take an imaginary wingless Aphis flatten the bod shorten and weaken the limbs elongate the beak into threads and endow it with a still more sluggish disposition we shall have a scale insect in its simplest form the Mealy bug of our conservatories Fig 74 enlarged It may be seen on comparison with the immature or larval form of the true scale insects Fig 75 enlarged that the female Metriy bug is but little more advanced in organization than these larvje though greatl exceeding them in size The male meal bug Coccus adonkhiin Linn is like the male scale insect Fig 76 enlarged and still more nearly resembles that of the cochineal Avhicli is twoAvinged with two long caudal wax threads While the female Coccus undergoes no transformations the male does spinning a cocoon Here we have a wonderful difference in form and Fig 7G Pine Scale Insect male habits ctvccn the sexes the female attaining the adult state b simple increase in size of the larval form while the male passes through a well marked metamrihosis This shows conclusively that metamorphosis is an accjuired mode of growth Tlie Coccus is a tenth of an inch long covered with a white cotton mealy substance The young are rather narrower than the old ones The latter when about to lay its eggs adheres by the long slender beak to the surface of the leaf and secretes from the abdomen a large cottony mifss of fine particles of wax which surrounds and partiallycovers tlio

insect the pale portion the cottony or woolly clown enveloping the eggs and young larvae The female is flat and scalelike while the male is twowinged All these scale insects are closely allied to the wax producing Coccus Professor Silliman informs us in the American Natural ist that it may be interesting to nonchemical readers to know that this insect Avax is a definite compound somewhat resembling spermaceti in appearance but not in compo sition being a cerotic ether known as cerotatc of ceryl of the formula C W° 0 It is crstalline and of a dazzling whiteness like spermaceti but more brittle and of a more fi brous texture It does not completely saponify by boiling in potash water but is completely decomposed when melted with potash yielding cerotate of potassium and hydrate of ceryl It is consumed in China for candles and also as a medicine It melts at about 118° F Prof Silliman quotes from a recent book by C C Cooper Travels of a Pioneer of Com merce in Pig Tail and Petticoats etc London 1871 the following interesting account of the cultivation of this wax insect On the third day we entered the white wax coun try so named from its producing the famous white wax of Szchuan which has been erroneously called vegetable wax This district was less undulating than that of the tea gardens and presented to the e3e a view of extensive plains sur rounded by low hills The plains were all under wax and rice cultivation the wax trees being planted round the embankments of the small paddy fields which were at most thirty yards square The country thus presented to the pass ing traveller the appearance of extensive groves of tree stumps each as thick as a mans thigh and all uniformly cut down to a height of about eight feet without a single branch The cultivation of wax is a source of great wealth to the province of Szchuan and ranks in importance second only to that of silk Its production is not attended with much labor or risk to the cultivator The eggs of tlic insect which produces the wax are annually imported from the districts of Ilochin or Iloking and AVliylitzou in Yunnan where the culture of the eggs forms a special occupation by mer chants who deal in nothing else but palatan white wax eggs The egg clusters which were described to me as about the size of a pea are transported carefully packed in baskets of the leaves of tlie palashu white Avax tree which re sembles a privetshrub and arrive in Szchuan in March where they are purchased at about twenty taels per basket The trees by the middle of Marcli have thrown out a number of long tender slioots and leaves and then the clusters of eggs enclosed in balls of the young leaves are suspended to the shoots by strings About the end of the month the larvai make their appearance feed on the branches and leaves and soon attain the size of a small caterpillar or rather a wingless house fly apparently covered with white down with a delicate plumelike appendage curving from the tail over the back So numerous are they that as seen by me in Yunnan the branches of the trees are whitened by them and appear as if covered with feathery snow The grub proceeds in July to take the chrysalis form burying itself in a white wax secre tion just as a silkworm wraps itself in its cocoon of silk All the branches of the trees are thus completely coated with wax an inch thick and in the beginning of August are lopped off close to the trunk and cut into small lengths which arc tied up in bundles and carried to the boiling houses where they are transferred without further preparation to large caldrons of water and boiled until every particle of the waxy sulstance rises to the surface The wax is skimmed off and run into moulds in which shape it is ex ported to all parts of the empire It would seem that the wax growers find that it does not pay them to reserve any of the insects for their reproductive state and hence the necessity of importing the eggs from  Yunnan In the district of Hochin and AVhylitzou where the culture of the eggs is alone attended to both frost and snow are experienced so that it would not be difficult to rear the insect in Europe and considering its prolific nature the production of white wax might repay the trouble of accli matizing this curious insect A near relation of the wax is the cochineal insect which affords us such an invaluable d3e carmine This insect Fig 78 showing the Avingless female natural size and en larged and the twowinged male is now abundant on the prickly pear in one corner of our Union Key AYest where we have found both sexes in great abundance The grain is the female Coccus dried So much has been written about this useful in sect of its mode of life and the methods of collecting and preparing it that we will not Aveary our readers with a repetition of it Its value however in commerce is very great In 1855 before red garments became fashionable says Dr Lankester in his Uses of Animals Great Britain imported 1400 tons of cochineal it takes 70000 of these in sects to make a pound which was valued at about £700000 and since then their consumption has probably greatly in creased Carmine he adds is one of the most powerful of coloring matters one grain of it it is said will dye a single silk fibre upwards of three thousand yards in length Other kinds of Coccus produce a carmine dye and our own species were the individuals sufficiently abundant could be used for this purpose Before cochineal was introduced into Europe the bodies of another kind of Coccus known as grains of Kermes wore used in Europe especially about the shores of the Mediterranean Lankester says that it is found extensively in Algeria anl the red Fez caps which 10 Cochineal Insect 116 HALF nouns WITH insects Packaijd find their way into the European markets are dyed Yith Kermes Carmine is also made from it Manna is said to be produced by the stings of the Coccus manyiiparus first described by Ehrenberg who found it at Sinai growing on the tamarix The lac insect so valuable a commercial prod uct is a bark louse which lives in the East Indies on the Ficus religiosa This insect by its beak punctures the bark especially of the branches From this puncture exudes a quantity of vegetable matter which eventually surrounds the lac insect and her eggs and larvae and produces on the branch an irregular brown mass which encircles it and whicli when broken has a resinous aspect This is gum lac Lankestcr When found on the twigs it is called stick lac but after it has been pounded and the greater part of the coloring matter extracted by water it is called seed lac when melted down into cakes after it has been strained and formed into thin scales lump lac and shell lac The most troublesome scale insect found on

universal pest in hot houses and in dry seasons abounds on the peas etc in gar dens Its eggs and Aoung may be found on the rose and other plants of the conservatory all the year round Its presence may be detected by the blotched and withered ap pearance of the leaves and the small Aveb Frequent show erings will reduce its numbers Sulphur dusted frequently over the leaves is an excellent remedy THE Crustacea afford in the northern lobster the spiny lobster of the tropics and numerous kinds of shrimps and crabs many choice bits for our larder Whether however any of the insects or their allies the spiders or even the worms will ever afford food to civilized man is a matter of grave doubt While the bulk of our animal food is given us by the vertebrated animals the ox sheep fowl and game being our main dependence the mollusks afford us the delicious oyster which we shall never be able to give up the less aristocratic clam handed over to the Pilgrim Fathers by tlie sagamores and their followers the delicious though rare scallop and the quahaug while mussels snails and whelks regale our transatlantic friends Honey is uni versally sought and that is an insect product but the flesh of insects is upon the whole repugnant to our feelings This is certainly unreasonable for multitudes of the locust or grasshopper of the East are eaten by Arabs and the savages in other jiarts of Africa We look with repugnance upon a roasted grasshopper but an Arab is said to have expressed his abhorrence at our eating raw oysters While in their sudden flights the grasshoppers cover the ground and eat up every green thing the natives adopt the sensible course of devouring them in turn The Bushman who is no farmer sings Yen even the wasting lociistswarm Which mighty nations dread To me nor terror brings nor liarm I mike of them my bread He collects them according to Andersson by lighting large fires directly in the path of their swarms As the insects pass over the flames their wings are scorched and they fall 24 Pacicaru EDIBLE INSECTS 121 Fig 87 lielpkssl to the ground They arc also he says collected by cartloads when the have retired to rest The locusts after being partially roasted are eaten fresh or they are dried in the hot ashes and then stored away for future emer gencies The natives reduce them also to powder or meal by means of two stones or a wooden mortar which powder when mixed with water produces a kind of soup or stir about I have tasted locusts prepared in various ways but I caraiot sa that I have found them very palatable But they must contain a vast deal of nourishment since the poor people thrive wonderfully on them He also states that ¦ the Cape Colony has been particularly subject to this dreadful scourge which is invariably followed by fam ine The inroads of the locusts are periodical ac cording to Pringle about once every fifteen years In 1808 after having laid waste a onsiderable portion of the country they disap peared and did not return until 1824 They then re mained for several years but in 1830 took their departure The locust is truly migratory the undeveloped partially winged young moving from one region to another lie quotes from Barrow who says that the larvie at the same time were emigrating to the northward The column of these imperfect insects passed the houses of two of our party who assured me that it continued moving forward without any interruption except by night for more than a month Of very similar habits is our redlegged grasshopper Caloptenus femiirrubrum Fig 87 b It appears at inter vals in immense swarms In 1871 it was ver destructive to grass in northern Maine seriously damaging the hay crop Destructive Grastehopiievs Lacicard It has also swarmed in Canada Dr Harris enumerates its visitations in New England in the last century when it de voured every green thing The habits of this species are not well known except that it appears in midsummer in the winged state The wingless larvae appear in June and as Harris recommends hay crops should be mown early before the insects fly in swarms The last of summer they couple and lay their eggs in holes in the earth Avhere they are hatched in the spring As Harris suggests this insect can only be kept under by concerted action on the part of farmers In the south of France the people make a business at certain seasons of the year probably in the autumn and late in the spring of col lecting locusts and their eggs the latter being turned out of the ground in little masses cemented and covered with a sort of gum in Avhich they are enveloped by the insects Various forms of dragnets can be invented for collecting them in large numbers and run if necessary through a field by horsepower The inventive genius of our farmers will easily suggest methods of gathering these insects by the bushel when they can be thrown into hot water and fed to swine An entomological friend has found by his own ex perience that roasted grasshoppers are excellent eating better than frogs Only let some enterprising genius of the kitchen once set the example of offering to his customers roasted grasshoppers raredone and fricasseed canker worms for we have it on the word of an entomologist that cater pillars are pleasing to the palate of man and these droves of entomological beeves will perchance supplant their ver tebrate rivals at the shambles and instead of cattle fairs we shall have grasshopper festivals and county caterpillar shows The Caloptenus spretas of Uhler Fig 87 a appears in immense numbers in the country between the Mississippi and the Rockj Mountains and extending from the Saskatch 26 Packakd edible IXSECTS 123 ewan river on the North to Texas Mr Scuddcr states that a third whether belonging to the same species or not is still uncertain has invaded at different times nearly all the country lying within the boundaries of the United States between the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific Ocean Dr Lincecum thus describes the ravages of C spretus in Texas Last spring the young were hatched from the egg in the early days of March by the middle of the month they had destroyed half the vegetation although the insects were wingless and not larger than a housefly The first winged specimens were seen high in the air at about three in the afternoon as a light northerly breeze sprang up millions dropped to the earth covering the ground in an hour and destroying every green thing with avidil Dur ing the night they were quiet but at daybreak commenced to eat and continued until ten in the morning Avhen they all flew southward At about three oclock in the afternoon of the same day another swarm arrived ten times as numerous as the first these again took flight the following day and thus they continued coming and going day after day devouring the Ibliage and depositing their eggs At first they selected bare spots for this purpose but finally the whole surface of the earth was so broken up by their borings that every inch of ground contained several patches of eggs This visitation was spread over many hundreds of miles Of other insects eaten by man we may instance the hum ble bee whose body is often sacrificed to the love of boys for sweets who since Shakspeares time have searched for the well bestratted bees sweet bag while in Cejdon bees are eaten bodily as food Some kinds of ants are eaten ly the Indians of the Gulf coast of IMexico Sumichrast says see our Guide to the Study of Insects p 187 that the natives eat the females after having detached the tho rax and Humboldt tells us that ants are eaten by the Indians of South America Kirby speaks from his own Pacicaud experience he says that auts have no unpleasant flavor they are very agreeably acid and the taste of the trunk and abdomen is different He refers to the fact that in some parts of Sweden ants are distilled along with rye to give a flavor to tlie inferior kinds of brandy Certain galls are esteemed in Constantinople for their aromatic and acid taste and Reaumur sajs that the galls of the ground ivy have been eaten in France but he thinks it doubtful if they ever rank with good fruits Kirby Reaumur has suggested that the numbers of injurious caterpillars might be judiciously lessened by our using them as food Kirby and Spence in their admirable Introduc tion to Entomology give a list of the lepidopterous larvae eaten by man Amongst the delicacies of a Boshiesmans table Sparr man reckons tliose caterpillars from which butterflies pro ceed The Chinese who waste nothing after they have unwound the silk from the cocoons of the silkworm send the chrysalis to table they also eat the larva of a hawk moth Sphinx some of which tribe Dr Darwin tells as are in his opinion very delicious and lastl the natives of New Holland eat the caterpillars of a species of moth of a singular new genus to which my friend Alexander MacLeay Esq has assigned characters and from the circumstance of its larva coming out only in the night to feed has called it Njcterobius A species of butterfly also Eublaxi Jiamata MacLeay as we learn from Mr Bennett congregates on the insulated granitic rocks in a particular district which he visited in the months of November December and January in such countless myriads with what object is unknown that the native blacks who call them Bugong assemble from far and near to collect them and after re moving the wings and down by stirring them on the ground previously heated by a large fire and winnowing them eat the bodies or store them up for use by pounding and 28 EDIBLE IXSECTS 125 smoking them The bodies of these butterflies abound in an oil witli the taste of nuts and when first eaten produce violent vomitings and other debilitating effects but these go off after a few days and the natives then thrive and fatten exceedingly on this diet for which they nc 88 have to contend with a black crow which is also attracted by the Bugongs in groat numbers and which they despatch with their clubs and use as food Kirby Among beetles the grubs of the gigantic palm weevil are roasted and eaten by natives in the tropics and the larva of the large Prionus much like the one here figured Fig 88 is eaten at Surinam in America and in the West Indies both by whites and blacks who empty wash and roast them and find them delicious Mr Hall informs me that in Jamaica this grub is called Macauco and is in request at the principal tables A similar insect is dressed at Mauritius under the name of 3Ioutac which the whites as well as negroes eat greedily and IMr Kirb from whom I have quoted thinks with Dr Darwin that the grub of the com mon cockchafer might be added to our entremets Who will Fig 89 set the example on this side of the Atlantic of eating the common white grub or young of the May beetle Fig 89 so destructive to our strawberr beds The Cicada or harvest fly to which Anacreon inscribes an ode was eaten by the Greeks Aristotle says that the pupoD are most delicious and after they change to the winged state the males at first have the best flavor while the females are better on account of the eggs Athentieus also and Aristophanes 29 Prionus May Beetle grub 126 HALF HOURS WITH IXSECTS mention their being eaten and lian is extremely angry with the men of his age tliat an animal sacred to the muses should be strung sold and eagerly devoured Kirby from whom we quote cites Peter Collinson as saying that the winged form of the seventeen year Cicada was in his time 1763 eaten by the Indians of North America Lastly the gravid enormously distended female of the white ant is regarded as a delicious morsel by the Hottentots and Smeathman thought them delicate nourishing and wliole some being sweeter than the grub of the weevil of the palms Roasted spiders are eaten by the natives of New Caledo nia Kirby says that even individuals amongst the more polished natives of Europe are recorded as having a similar taste so that if you could rise above vulgar prejudices you would in all probability find them a most delicious morsel If you require precedents Reaumur tells us of a young lady who when she walked in her grounds never saw a spider that she did not take and crack upon the spot Another female the celebrated Anna Maria Scherman used to eat them like nuts which she affirmed they much resembled in taste excusing her propensity by saying that she was born under the sign Scorpio If you wish for the authority of the learned Lalande the celebrated French astronomer was as Latreille witnesses equally fond of these delicacies Even the centipedes are not neglected as Humboldt records the fact that he has seen the Indian children drag out of the earth centipedes eighteen inches long and more than half an inch broad and devour them Even the eggs of certain insects are eaten In Mexico the eggs of the Corixa or water boatman are often used as food and in the same country the Indians prepare a liquor from the Cicindela of which we figure a species by mac erating it in water or spirit which they apparently use as a stimulating beverage Druggists are indebted to insects for the Spanish fly or blistering beetle Cimtharis for an important article in the pharmacopoeia Our native species of Cantharis Fig 90 a Lylta cinerea b L vitirina of which four are common all over the country when dry and powdered afford a good vesicant Were we living in the middle ages or even as far back as the eighteenth century our materia medica would be swelled Fig so Lytta or blistering beetle by a long list of entomological nostrums of which Kirby and Spence aflJbrd us an amusing list As we are indebted to the ant for lessons of prudence and thrift so has this humble creature given one of the gieatest boons to poor suffering humanit To the ant we are indebted for the discovery of chloroform How the dis covery of this prince of anodjncs came about Dr Lankcster tells us in his little work on the Uses of Animals p 243 Some years ago whilst editing the correspondence of John Ray I was amused by the letters which passed between this great naturaliit and Dr Martin Lister of York on the subject of the acid liquid of pismires It had been ob served that when ants were bruised their juices afforded an acid secretion Avhich substance was afterwards known as formic acid The attention of modern chemists being thus called to formic acid Dumas discovered that it contained a base a compound radical which he called formylc This 31 128 Packakd base with three atoms of oxjgen forms the formic acid Now Dumas not only made this out but he further discov ered that the three atoms of oxygen might be replaced with three atoms of chlorine He thus obtained terchloride of formyle It so happened that when etlier had been em ployed as an aniiesthetic Dr Simpson of Edinburgh was induced to look for some agent that might act even more beneficially than ether in this Iespect He tried the terchlo ride of formde and found it to succeed and this is the agent which under the name of chloroform has been the means of alleviating a vast amount of human misery and if occasionally it has destroyed life it has saved so much that mankind owes a deep debt of gratitude to those who have successfully introduced it into practice Such then are some of the relations in which insects stand to us They feed ns clothe us and lull us to sleep The gorgeous hues and lines of grace of some fill our minds with visions of beauty others master pieces of ugliness turn us to loathing They are our companions by day and alas also by night Finally a thorough comprehension of their origin structure and habits forms a part of that grand science biology which great intellects have through the centu ries since the time of Aristotle gradually and with much pains built up and the end and aim of which is to seek the answer to the question What is life thus bringing the mind of the inquirer into closer relations with the Source of all Life A HISTORY of the insect inhabitants of a pond or AA stream would deal largely in the tragic The biog raphy of one aquatic insect from the time of its birth till its death provided it completed the usual round of exis tence allotted to its species would be a long and perhaps tedious record of escapes from its enemies of its methods of avoiding or repelling their attacks while on the other hand the pages of its biograph would be largely occupied with a list of those it had killed and wounded not from the mere love of carnage but from the simple necessity of main taining its own existence If we reflect for a moment on the fact that out of about one iiundred eggs laid by the dragon fl perhaps only one pair survive the following summer and that the remaining ninetyeight 3oung have afforded food for other dragon flics and insects of other species and then consider the amount of insectfood required to maintain the pair of dragon flies from tlie larval to the winged state we shall be impressed with the fact that the majority of insects are born to serve as food for the few that survive Life among tlie lower animals as in human affairs is an intense struggle for existence resulting in a triumph of the favored few over the masses These few perpetuate the qualities which gave them success and so we have a con stant progress upwards of life from lower to higher forms a survival of those best fitted by physical and intellectual qualities to maintain themselves in the world There is genius or preeminence in intellectual qualities among in sects Ants choose generals and master workmen whose lead the follow in their wars and public works The queen bee is mistress of the kingdom over whic she rules 9 1 130 It is not however simply a record of the triumph of brute force Intelligence is everywhere guiding the operations of these unconscious or possibly conscious agents The great interest in studying the habits of insects results from this fact of the immanence of mind in the animal world Insects and animals generally are not mere animated machines with a blind instinct alone operating under the rule of socalled inflexible physical laws for these very laws as we call them are in a state of unstable equilibrium There was a time before life originated when the world was form ing by the agency of cosmical laws the biological laws became developed with the rise of animal and plant life The laws of life the processes of evolution have changed and become more complex as forms of life beginning with the Vibrios Moners and Amoebas became differentiated into the grand groups of the animal and vegetable kingdom So the life of the individual of the species of the animal world collectively is a long record of feats of strength of mere animal courage opposed to cunning skill and sagacity The strong are saved by their size and strength while on the other hand as in the parasitic species the very weakness of the weak is often their defence In past ages insects were gigantic and low in intelligence judging by their sur viving relations while the insects of the present day as a rule have smaller more compact bodies with their appen dages more under the control of their intelligence The most fitting have survived The families and orders of the Neuroptera which are least numerous at the present day are those which have succumbed in this struggle for existence The Hymenoptera and beetles comprise the most intelligent of insects and they are perhaps the most numerous in species Had one been born in the Silurian period he would be excused for being a materialist of the Biichner school but man of the Quaternary period ie of the present day who 2 Packaro insects of THE POND AND STREAM 131 is able to reflect on this progress of life as the beneficent result of the struggle mental and physical for existence of his own and other species such an one unless his faculties are quite unequally developed cannot avoid a rational com bination of materialism and spiritualism in his intellectual makeup The very faculty he possesses of making this retrospect and studying his own mental operations and of appreciating the Infinite Power working in material laws separates him from the animals and should teach him that he is not subject alone to physical material laws So if in looking back the picture of the animal world evolving from a mere drop of protoplasm of humanity struggling up from some apelike Fig 91 form seems sad tragic and gives a shock to the sensibilities of many the final result is liopeful and inspir ing In connection with tliese pro found problems of our own existence the study of the halits economy structure and embryology of animals their various contrivances for the maintenance of life their evident en jojment of life as long as it lasts the gleams of intellect flashing out in their daily acts all derive a fresh and startling interest Among aquatic insects there are marvels of mechanical skill displayed in the construction of the bodies of tiie swim ming and diving forms The Gerris or Wherrjman Fig 91 of our streams ages ago anticipated our racing boats and wherries Our diving macliines whether known to their inventors or not are modelled on the principle of the diving beetle and the diving spider Tlie mechanism of swimming in the Dytiscus engaged the attention of StrausDurchheim the famous French anatomist Models of scissors straight and curved that would give new ideas to a Sheffield mnnu 3 132 HALF HOUKS WITH ENSECTS facturer may be studied in the jaws of the young of these same diving beetles The hirval Corethra a fly allied to the mosquito is an excellent areometer and other philosophical instruments have their counterparts in the special organs of insects adapting them for an aquatic life Cases of protective mimicry are afforded by the Caddis flies Fig 92 which move over the bottom carrying about with them a movable chevaux de rise of sticks behind which lurk a nimble pair of jaws or they mimic innocent sticks or build their cases of bits of moss and move about Fig 92 Different forms of Case Worms bearing as it were subaqueous Birnam forests or when their tubes are built of sand imitate the irregularities of the bottom over which they creep and thus living in ambush all the while are protected in their turn by these disguises As the Ranatra Fig 93 is noticed moving about slowly at the bottom of a pool it would be easily mistaken for an ear of wheat moved accidentally It is not so harmless as it looks for its fore legs are held up in an attitude that will at least be deemed by its victims a striking one When it strikes out those legs the long claws close with a firm grasp ESTSECTS OP THE POND AND STREAM 133 on the struggling worm which is nailed to the leg by a spine opposite the end of the claw Why its bod is so long and linear in shape we cannot imagine unless for the purpose of concealment and protection as its movements are labored and slow as are those of Belostoma its near ally which as Fig 93 Ilanatra has been remarked by others closely resembles a dead loaf as it lies at the bottom of the pond in wait for its prey So small a proportion of insects arc aquatic that the question arises whether those that do live in our ponds and streams may not be the descendants of terrestrial forms The ocean is the parent of all life ultimately but only a very few insects live in salt water and it is easy to see that a maritime life is not a normal one to them So in a less degree with the fresh water forms The aquatic insects are representatives of scattered families and though all are in various ways modified by their aquatic surroundings 3et so much do they differ in their modes of development and structure among themselves that it is easy to see that they belong mainly to terrestrial types which have adopted an aquatic life after the t3pe to Avhich they had belonged had become fixedly terrestrial For example many beetles ¥lG 94 Fia 95 Fig 90 Dytiscus A Carabid Amphizoa which are aquatic are allied to the carnivorous ground beetles The Dytiscus and its allies are essentially aquatic Carabidfe the family comprising the ground beetles The larvffi of these water beetles have the same kind of feelers and mouthparts as the land Carabids the structure of the adult beetle is on the Carabid type the body being how ever more ovate and modified for swimming Both types Figs 94 and 95 may have been derived from ancestors of terrestrial habits As proof of this we have the Cali fornian Amphizoa Fig 96 which is said by Dr Horn to 6 INSECTS OF THE POND AND STREAM 135 be subaquatic and in its structure and habits connects the Carabids with tlie Dytiscidre Out of the immense number of species of butterflies and moths but three or four genera are known to be aquatic The larvjB of Hydrocampa Cataclysta and Paraponyx small moths of the family of PyralidiB live in the water on the leaves of aquatic plants the caterpillar of Paraponyx being provided both with branchite and spiracles M Bar has lately discoered in French Guiana a hairy caterpillar which Fig 97 A Tardigrade lives in the water and resembles that of our Arctia or woolly bear It has no tracheal branchiae and all the spiracles except those on the segment behind the head and a pair on the end of the body are smaller than usual There uic no truly aquatic Hjmenoptera or Orthoptera The aquatic Ileniiptcra such as Gerris Notonecta a Corixa and a few other forms all breathe atmospheric air though the stigmata may be elongated and otherwise modified for the purpose One spider the Argyroneta of Europe is 7 136 HALF HOUKS WITH INSECTS aquatic We know of no other water spider Certain mites are aquatic but do not differ from land species in tlieir mode of respiration Tlie Tardigrades Fig 97 Macrohiotus Americanus are low microscopic mites which live in water and are called water bears They have no spiracles nor air tubes and respire solely through the skin The Pycnogo nids which live at all depths of the ocean from low water to several hundred fathoms and which are probably related to the mites also breatlie through the skin It is among the twowinged flies Diptera andNeuroptera Fig 98 Ephjdia and pupa case that we find insects with gilllike appendages penetrated by air tubes which supply fresh air to the blood There are quite a number of aquatic larvae of flies but with few excep tions such as those of the mosquito and black fl they belong to families which also contain closely allied genera which live in the earth For example most crane fly larvae are terrestrial a few are adapted for aquatic life some lar val horse flies live in mould some are known to be aquatic 8 Packakd tNTSECTS OF THE POND AND STREAM 137 most of the Syrphidae are Aphiseaters in the larval state Of that immense family MuscitUe of which the house fly is a t3pe which are almost purely terrestrial Eplndra Fig 98 fly and pupa case is aquatic It may be said on the whole that the aquatic larvie of the Diptera were originally terrestrial insects which have adopted an aquatic life and are exceptions to the rule In the Neuroptera however there are whole families which are aquatic both in the larval and pupal state having exter nal gilllike appendages in both stages and in the case of Fig 99 Pteronarcys which is closely allied to Perla Fig 99 from Figuier they are retained in the winged fly The Neurop tera arc par excellence water insects and yet it is doubtful even whether they have not originally assumed this excep tional mode of life and while the earliest of all insects were not at first terrestrial This is speculation and guesswork but facts seem to point to this conclusion Now the changes in structure fitting the insect for a life in ponds and streams are to be found in the organs of loco motion and the breathing apparatus and in this essay I 9 138 Fig 100 Trachcti shall endeavor to show how insects primarily adapted for breathing atmospheric air are enabled to breathe in the water then I shall notice the various modes of swimming in aquatic insects In the first place how are insects fitted to live under water It will be remembered that all insects breathe by means of air tubes called tracheae Fig 100 tiachea Fig 101 section of spiracle These are tubes composed of three coats the inner a tube of mucous membrane sur rounded by a spiral thread formed orig inally out of a homogeneous membrane which ultimately splits up into these spiral threads giving rigidity and toughness to the tube There is a third loose investing membrane the socalled peritoneal coat A trachea originates from a spiracle or breathing hole of which there are usually nine on each side of the body These spiracles or stigmata Fig 101 act open by a slit into an inner chamber eh guarded by a muscle m The air thus admitted is carried into every part of the body by the numerous fig loi fine subdivisions of these tubes which form a beautiful network of silvery threads when filled with air They are bathed by the blood which is everywhere oxygenated by the air in these fine tubes Numerous beetles and water bugs have no special apparatus for breathing in the water The Dytiscus when it wishes to breathe rises to the surface tail foremost bends the end of its abdomen so as to allow the air to pass into the spiracles under the eljtra and scuttles down to the bottom in great apparent haste with a bubble of air attached to the tip of the body When its supply of air is exhausted 10 Spiracle it is forced to rise for more In tlie travels of Colymbetes a near all of Dytiscus around the jar in which we have watched its movements it often makes a squeaking sound which we have heard at night as often as by day This noise can be readily produced artificially by rubbing the end of the abdomen against the elytra or wing covers In this beetle there are six pairs of abdominal spiracles but the basal pair are nearly three times as large as the others and into these most of the air probably enters In handling this beetle one is apt to be pricked by the sternal spine which extends back of the insertion of the hind legs and is as sharp as a needle How useful it may be to the insect in pusliing its way through any obstacle may be demonstrated b holding it tightly between the fingers here even it man ages to push its way out and drop to the ground All the water beetles fly about in the night exchanging one pond for another and they sometimes enter our Avindows Siebold says that Hydropliilus jnceus Fig 102 from Piguier the largest of all the water beetles and belonging to a different gronp from Dytiscus when it breathes pro trudes only its antennae out of water and bending them backwards thus establishes a communication between the external air and that adhering to the under surface of the body In our Notoneda undulata Fig 103 the mode of taking aboard its supply of air before diving is most admirable The deck of the boat ie the under side of the body for the insect swims oii its back has a longitudinal ridge in the middle a broad gutter between this ridge and the sharp edge of the bod is bridged over from the head to tlie end of the abdomen ly a layer of dark coarse oblique hairs and a layer of less obliciue hairs arises on each side from tlie middle of the ridge These hairs thus form a false upper deck Tlie creature rises to the surface the end of the body projecting slightly out of water the air passes up on each 11 140 side along the tunnel under the hairs and collects in bubbles above the base of the legs Along the bottom of this Fig 102 Hydrophilus piceus eggs and larva tunnel are six pairs of spiracles into which the air passes The air in the specimens we observed did not adhere to the hairs of the hind legs as Siebold says it does nor as he states in his Comparative Anatomy trans lated by Burnett does the air for respiration as a rule pass under the elytra since the spiracles arc not situated on the upper side of the body but on the under and quite a distance from the edge of the body Nor does this insect breathe at all as Westwood states like Dytiscus in which the spir acles are situated on the upper side of the body so that the air enters readily under the elytra When it takes in the air the tip of the abdomen is thrust up just above 12 Notonecta water and an orifice is formed by the separation of the liairs at the end of the keel Avhich form the larger part of the mouth of the orifice the remainder being composed of the hairs fringing the movable terminal plates of the body The air thus passes in between the false deck of hairs and the under side of the body When the insect is taken out of the water the hairs cling to the sides of the body reveal ing very distinctly the breathing holes Some air occasion ally penetrates under the elytra and remains there most of the time Often the whole under side of the bod between the pairs of legs is a continuous bubble like a mass of quick silver or molten lead The Notonccta often rises for a new supply of air before the old is exhausted While handling Notouecta thoughtless of its reputed sting in a quiet businesslike way it inserted its beak in my thumb the pain almost as severe as the p sting of a Avasp and lasting for five minutes The pain was too acute and benumbing not to be the elTect of a poison If no poison sac will yet be found in the head then the saliva must be an acrid poison By this poisonous sting it must para lyze its victims Another water bug the Co rixa Fig 104 enlarged is less tame and does not come to the surface nearly as often as Notonccta It receives its suppl of air in an instant and darts down to the bottom It does not swim in an inverted position It takes in the air so suddenly that it is impos sible without long and patient observation to see the mode which we have been unable to find described It rises to the surface in a horizontal position and no sooner is the sur face reached than it darts to the bottom and in one instance 13 Corixa 142 L remained there for ten minutes by the watch and then darted up again leaving an air bubble in its wake which rose to the top afterwards It carries down with it a broad silvery streak along the side of the bol3 The air is really introduced under the head and front thorax The head is large and very movable as well as the prothorax It slides back and forth on a tliin membrane from the surface of which it can be raised So with the hinder edge of the pro thorax which rides over the membranous hind thorax which it nearly conceals When the Corixa rises to the surface it floats in a horizontal position the hind edge of the head and the prothorax rising slightly above the surface Now slightly raising the back of the head and the hind edge of the prothorax a space appears in front of and behind the prothorax by which tlie air passes into the breathing holes beneath This is proved by the small bubbles of air re maining in these two cracks Two minute spiracles may be detected in deep pits one on each side just above the inser tion of the legs and from which the trachcce arise each one dividing into three irregular short branches as may be seen by detaching the segment and holding it up to tlie light So much for tliose insects which simply rise to tlic surface and take in air without any special modification of the spir acles We now come to a second group of adult insects which by a change in the number position and form of the spiracles are provided with a special respiratory contrivance A striking example is seen in Ranatra the water stick bug The end of this creatures body terminates in two thin tubes nearly as long as the insect itself at the end of which are two spiracles each connecting with a trachea These lono appendages which are simply elongated spiracles it thrusts out of the water takes in its supply of air and then goes on in its deliberate ramble The Nepa of Europe has much shorter respirator3 tubes than Ranatra while those of Belos toma scarcely project beyond the body though in B annec 14 PACKAun INSECTS OF THE POXD AND STREAM 143 tens from Nicaragua the are a quarter of fin inch long and two tracheal branches can be distinctly seen in each of them The other abdominal spiracles are wanting in these three forms though thiee pairs according to Schiodte are present on the thorax There are a number of aquatic larvse which breathe by similar respiratory tubes Such is the young of Dytiscus Eristalis larva Fig 107 Dytisous larva Mcrodon and larva It has to rise to the surface for air which is inspired through the bristlelike tubes at the end of Ihe body So with the larval Eristalis Fig 106 and its ally Merodon hardus ¥g Q1 a larva and Ilelophilus Fig lOS These maggots frequent the most loathsome ditches thick with mud and putref3ing matter Here they lie acting as scavengers and doing all they can to aid the State Board of Health They wave their long flexible respiratory tubes aloft and drink in the pure air of heaven not unmixed per haps with the less than spicy odors emanating from their native puddle Some of the Ilelophili frequent strongly brackish water in fact almost purely salt water while 1Epliydia with its rather short thick tubes and fleshy feet clambers over green sea weeds in salt pools removed above the reach of ordinary tides or lives in the brine pools of Illinois or the salt lakes of the West The aquatic larva of one of the Tipulids or crane flies Ptychoptera has a long respiratory tube while in the pupa there is one attached to the head and much longer proportionally than in the lar val Helophilus Among those larval flies which are obliged to ascend to the surface to breathe is the young Mosquito Fig 109 a Fig 108 Helophilus larvae after Figiiier larva b pupa a paddles at end of body of pupa Its body is beautifully adapted for going through its aquatic evolutions The head and thorax are so large and bulky that it cannot ascend and lie motionless in a horizontal position as in the young Anopheles which lies before us in a dish as we are writing but it hangs head downwards and breathes by means of a spiracle lodged in one of the large tubes into which the end of the body subdivides the position of this tube being maintained bj a pencil of radiating hairs attached to a shorter projection at the end of the bod The air is rapidly absorbed b the unusually large trachea nearly filling the longer tube After taking a fresh breath it often swings its head around mouth upwards its tail being the pivot mowing the surface of the water if clouded with decaying matter with its jaws The young Anopheles the fly of which is the fourspotted mosquito found in houses late in autumn and early in spring is a surface breather But the head and thorax are scarcely heavier than the hind body and along its whole length are tufts of hairs which spread out and act as floats to the body The mouthparts are tufted more distinctly than in the Fig 109 A B Mosquito larva and pupa young mosquito In this larva the lody ends in four flesh fingerlike appendages in wliich the tracheae may be dis tinctl seen In its pupal stage the mosquito is quite a different being Its life is regulated by a new code It scorns food of all sorts and like some religious devotee lives ou air alone and that in homeopathic doses The enormous thorax is almost a deformity and now instead of breathing through its tail it bears two clubshaped respiratory tubes on its back Fig 109 I These are situated on the site of the future tho racic spiracles of the fly Of those insects whicb extract air from the water in which they live and are not obliged to ascend to the surface is the young of the plumed gnat Fig 110 CJdronomus oceanicus male and beneath head of female a larva and head en larged These worms are very abundant in every mud puddle but the species here figured lives at all depths in Fig 110 Ocean Gnat a larva and head enlarged the sea down to over a hundred feet Some larvte of an other species were dredged in Lake Superior by Mr S I Smith at a depth of one hundred and fiftyfive feet They are usually provided with two pairs of fleshy filaments perme ated by one or two slender tracheal twigs connecting with a slender pair of tracheae running through the body and enlarging towards the head So slightly developed how ever is the tracheal system in Chironomns and so thin are the walls of the body that I am inclined to think that these nearl transparent larvae breathe in part through their skin Now we have in the singular ghostlike larva of Corethra another plumed gnat a being which has no spiracles nor tra cheae and which breathes as NYeissmann sajs through the skin The air thus absorbed is contained in four reservoirs forming swimming bladders and thus the density of the water is measured by this living hydrostatic apparatus Two of these kidneyshaped bladders are lodged in the tho rax and are larger than the two near the end in order to support the heavier front end of the worm These singular larvie may be found in winter in ponds by breaking through the ice as well as the Belostoma and various water beetles and can be kept alive in jars of water The fingerlike appendages we have described in the larva of the plumed gnat afford the simplest form of tracheal gill Did the blood penetrate into them and accompany in closed vessels the air tube it would be exactly comparable with the gills of fishes and larval amphibious reptiles but it does not it is not a true gill and the term false gill or tracheal gill has been applied to this organ From the young Chironomus with its four tracheal finger shaped gills attached to the extreme end of the bodj we may pass to a singular larva of a European crane fly called Cylindrotoma which according to DeGeer breathes by means of numerous hollow flexible filaments scattered over the body and which as Westwood says appear to be traversed by trachcic A similar looking creature is the caterpillar of Paraponyx which respires under water by means of a number of fasciculate filaments situated on the sides of the abdominal rings In fact this caterpillar has been anticipjited by the case worms the young of the Caddis flies in which the caterpil 19 148 Fig 111 larlike body is provided with white slender filaments aris ing in groups of from two to five and crossing over the back of the worm When the case worms are about to transform they close up the mouth of their case with a grating or as in the snaillike caseworm Helicopsyche wliose case Fig Ill is made of grains of sand they close the aperture by a dense silken lid pierced by a slit through which the water enters The only exception known to this mode of respiration in the large family of Caddis flies is Enoicyla which is terrestrial living in moss at the roots of trees and consequently has no respiratory Fig 112 Nemoura and pupa filaments Notwithstanding the submerged life of these case worms they are attacked by ichneumon flies when in the larval state How the young ichneumon lives in the submerged body of its host is not known The branchial gills in the Perla and its allies Nemoura Fig 112 and pupa and Pteronarcys etc which are flat bodied insects living under stones in streams have been in vestigated by Newport the famous English anatomist and quite recently by Dr Gerstaecker of Berlin Mr Newport made the astonishing discovery that the Avinged adult Pteronarcbjs retains its larval tracheal gills and Dr Gerstaecker has lately liscovered that this is also the case with a species of Dianiphipnoa from Chili and a European species of Ne moura This is analogous to certain Tritons or Salamanders which retain their gills in adult life The larva of Ilydrophilus the large water beetle Fig 102 breathes by means of spiracles but is probably aided by the lateral filaments along the abdomen One would hardly suspect that the whirligig beetle which gyrates almost unceasingly on the surface of everj roadside puddle or eddy of the stream had 3oung of such a singular appearance They differ from all known coleopterous larvae in the posses sion of eight pairs of large long thick hair appendages permeated by tracheae They would by some be mistaken for caddis worms but their head is much larger and jaws much longer and sickleshaped In August the mature larvae are said to creep out of the water and spin an oval cocoon at tached to some plant and then dropping their tracheal gills witli their larval skins lreathe through siiraclcs After remaining a month in the upa state it appears as a beetle which lays its eggs in regular rows on the leaves of water plants and in about a week after tlie larvre are hatched An interesting chapter might be written on the sense of sight in aquatic insects In Notonecta and Corixa the eyes pass under the water level so that they can see above and below at the same time So with Gyrinus Fig 113 Its eyes are divided by the portion of the head that carries the antennae so that as Wood says the portion under the sur face may be compared with a water glass used by fishermen for observing objects at the bottom Our Gyrinus larva repeats with great exactitude the form of the young Cory 21 Gyrinus and larva 150 Fig 114 dalns Fig 114 which transforms into the large netveined insect Fig 115 so formidable in appearance and yet so harmless A singular chapter in biology would be the life of this insect The gigantic carnivorous larva with its large head and enor mous jaws is provided with eight pairs of long rather stiff respiratory filaments Dr Ilagen has called attention to the spiracles of this crea ture which are not usu ally present with tracheal gills and to the reason for their existence It seems that like the Euro pean Sialis Fig 116 larva and pupa it lives some weeks out of water before its transformation into the pupa which rests in an earthen co coon in the banks of streams above water The eggs Fig 114 a are very large and are deposited In a squarish mass on the steins of water plants There is no more beau Corydalus larva and egg tifnl object for low powers of the microscope than the larval May fly Fig 117 The body is so transparent that the movements of the heart the play of its valves the circula tion of the blood the distribution of the tracheae the diges tive canal and its movements as well as the action of the 22 IXSECTS OF THE POND AND STREAM 151 muscles controlling the jaws and other parts of the mouth can all be watched with ease The tra cheal gills like pad dles either round or long and leaflike are arranged in pairs along the hinder re gion of the body and the tracheae in them can be readily seen These beauti ful respiratory leaves are also paddles and by their aid as well as by the undulations of the body the 3oung May fly moves rap idly and gracefully through the water It lives two years while tbe winged fly Fig 118 but a day rarely over twenty four hours The winged fly throws off the pupa skin in an instant While holding a pupa in my hands the im ago slipped out sud denly with wings fully formed This Fig 115 The Horned Corydulus was the socalled subimago after a few hours if it had not been placed in the collecting bottle it would have thrown off a thin pellicle and then been sexuall mature It then Fig 116 Fig 117 Fig lis Larva and Pupa of Sialis Larva of Palingenia May Fly las its eggs in a round mass and dies Some of the larvae live in burrows at the bottom of ponds while others swim free Coming lastly to the family of Dragon flies we find among the larvae the most diverse means of respiration In the young of Agrion Fig 119 a respiratory leaf of larva the body ends in three large leaves through the middle of which runs a trachea which sends off a number of smaller branches These larvai when quite small are beautiful objects for the microscope their bodies then are so transpar ent Now iu the young of the larger dragon flies such as Diplax Cordulia Fig 120 iEschna Fig 121 and Ma croinia Fig 122 the breathing process is carried on within the body The terminal portion of the di gestive tract is provided with ridges of mucous mem brane Into these folds or ridges numerous tracheal twigs penetrate Fig 123 x The water is admitted through the conical valves at the end of the body there it is deprived of its air which is absorbed by the trachea and ejected in a gentle stream or if the Agnon anl Kespimtovy Leaf of Larva creature is startled it is driven out as if by a force pump Fig 120 or syringe sending the insect forward several times its own length Returning again to the Ma flies Walsh has described a mode of respi ration unique in that group but which reminds us of the internal lunglike apparatus of the larval dragon fl This curious form is otherwise an ex ception to all insects in that its three thoracic rings above are instead of Coidiiiia lateralis being separate consolidated into one plate which extends back halfway over the abdomen Fig 124 III shows the position of the tracheal lungs in the end of the abdomen AVe need further observations to show how the animal takes in and expels the water 25 154 No Myriopods are aquatic but a number of mites and allied forms live in water and extract the air mechanically mixed with the water without having to rise to the surface They have two spiracles and air tubes but how they extract the air in the water is not known Such are the Hydrachna and Atax which live in their early stages as parasites be tween the gills of fresh water clams while some species attach themselves to water insects Of the various modes of swimming among insects the Fig 121 Fig 122 schna Maciomia transversa simplest though not the most graceful is wriggling By a series of contortions of the body the young Chironomus moves about without much apparent purpose The twist ings and turnings of the larval mosquito are anticipations in nature of the most laborious and complicated feats in gym nastics of the circus clown The latter realizes the amount of muscular exertion and nervous strain expended in a two minutes circumtorsion of the ring The young mosquito through its life of such violent undulations knows no fatigue A study through the transparent skin of the arrangement Fig 123 of the muscles of the body shows their wonderful adapta bility for the production of these complicated movements Many aquatic insects are either side wheelers or pro pellers The larval Ephemera aided by the beautiful pad dlelike tracheal gills along the sides of the body moves through the water b a series of exceedingly grace ful undulations while the young Agriou pro pels itself partly at least by its large terminal respiratory leaves How by a strange economy of nature the dragon fly larva combines the functions of digestion locomotion and respi ration in an organ which like a force pump ejects a power ful stream and like a flash propels the creature many times its own length over the bottom of its pond we have seen above One important result of the metamorphosis of the 3oung mosquito into a pupa is that it is promoted from a wriggler to a paddler padilling being a higher mode of aquatic loco motion Our figure of the pupal mosquito shows in a rude way the two beautiful thin rounded paddles at the end of 27 DijilMx larva x mass of trachere 156 Fig 124 the body By dexterous strokes aided h a graceful but rapid bending of tlie body it seeks the surface and inspires air through its thoracic respiratory tubes In the same way it descends to the bottom The Corethra larva alters the specific gravity of its body during the course of its wriggling but as a pupa all this is changed It now resembles the mosquito pupa has exter nal thoracic respiratory tubes and well developed tracheae it loses its air bladders and swims by means of two terminal paddles like those of the mosquito We now come to the water beetles and bugs whose move ments in the water are as graceful as they are awkward on land Their whole organization bodily and psychical as thoroughly adapts them for tlie water as that of the seal or whale for tlie same element They are the Amphibia of the insect world Born as sailors they take to the water on being hatched and there remain through their lives only leaving one pond to seek another im pelled by a restless love of change which unconsciously to tliemselves results in good to their race preventing too close inandin breeding and the conse quent deterioration of the stock Look at the body of the Djtiscus Fig 125 so perfectly adapted for its aquatic life Remember that it is in reality a modified ground bee tle such as Harpalus the mouthparts much the same and that the changes in form are mostly if not whoU such as adapt it to its aquatic life Tlie body is oval both ends alike as in a boat while the legs are perfect oars The hind legs instead of being broad and spiny towards the claws as in the running ground beetles taper to a point and are articulated by an exquisite mecliauism to tlie body They are edged on tlie inner side witli a dense long fringe of exceedingly fine white hairs forming with the flattened leg itself the blade of the oar and thus by a series of rapid strokes the body is propelled onwards The fore legs are short and thick and in the males modified into a clasp ing organ the three basal joints of the tarsus being broadly dilated and consolidated into a large disk covered with many minute funnelshaped suckers two or three of which are much larger than the others The Grinus is less a Fig 125 Male and Female Dytiscu3 diver than a surface swimmer It is a very sociable insect forming little swimming parties on the surface of the water In the course of its gyrations it manages to pick up a com fortable livelihood of small beetles and flies which fall into the water When disturbed it dives to the bottom Unlike the other water beetles it has very large fore legs and re markably short middle and hind legs and Hies about in the night at daylight slipping quietly into some pool On being handled it emits a disagreeable whitish milky fluid which is probably distasteful to its enemies All the other 2 J 158 water beetles so far as we have observed secrete a similar fluid but in less abundance Equally if not more perfect in its adaptability to aquatic life is the Notonecta which as its name implies swims on its back Now look at the form of the body The back usually broad and flat in the Hemiptera is here rounded like the keel of a canoe while the under side is flat forming the deck of the boat to which the oars are attached by a set of automatic rowlocks The head is bent over and submerged in front the eyes are partly above and partly beneath the water so that a double outlook into two worlds is secured The antenuje are tucked away out of sight in a groove under the eyes The end of the body is pointed affording no re sistance to the water and Fig 126 the posterior half of the body is fringed with long spreading hairs which aid in buoying the body up The adjoining cut 12G gives an idea of the atti tude of the Notonecta xotonecta when at rest at the sur face of the water back downwards The hind feet are beautifully fringed and while swimming it feathers its oars the hairs of the blade being pressed to the leg as it is drawn forwards and again spreading out with the backward stroke of the limb In this insect as well as in Corixa as Schiodte observes the hind legs are moved both together as in Dytis cus In Belostoma and probably Ranatra they are moved alternately When about to fly from its pool which it does by day as well as by night as is the case with Corixa it dives a little way down and then leaps suddenly straight up out of the water and spreads its wings flying rapidly off All the water bugs and beetles are careful to keep them selves clean and smooth Particularly necessary is it for  the Notonocta to keep its keel smooth and it may often be seen brusliing its back with its hind legs or wliere the will not suffice using the middle and front legs for this purpose It la3s its long cylindrical eggs on the stems and leaves of plants The 3oung hatch in about fifteen das appearing in spring The differ from their parent chiefly in wanting wings Corixa is in its form more like the slow moving punt being rounded nearly alike at both ends The head is still more bent and prolonged beneath partly overlapping the thorax Its beak is minute and hidden from sight So much for the swimming insects of which we have men tioned the principal forms There are a few of what may be called sJcaters They move like the AYherryman or Gerris on the surface of the water their feet being so constructed as to enable them to run upon the surface without wetting them The middle pair of feet are longer than the hinder and they mostly perform the work of skating being covered with fine hairs which repel the water and thus the insect skims over the surface with great rapidity making very short twists and turns like a practised skater The under side of the body is covered with short hairs like plush form ing a repellent surface to the water The fore limbs are much shorter and used at times in re taining their prey Some of these Whcrrymen will be found minus the hind wings and are condemned to a life of com parative seclusion though it is said that the winged indi viduals seldom take flight Far out in mid ocean in the tropics are found the oceanic waterskaters the Ilylobatos Their fore legs are short outstretched with thickened thighs They are also wing less the wingcovers alone being present They course over the surface of tiie ocean in large swarms and are seen from vessels many hundred miles from land They are the true toilers of the sea among insects 31 160 The only possible way to study the aquatic insects is to keep them in glass jars and bowls where their habits can be carefully studied An aquarium may thus be improvised which will last for several weeks without care though it is better to add a few water plants such as the water cress the Valisneria Callitriche Duckweed and other plants to keep the water ox3genated By stocking the aquarium with the larvoe and pupse of certain neuropterous insects at the time when the Avinged forms are most abundant the immature forms can easily be kept long enough for us to determine the winged species into which they pass In the autumn as cold weather and short days keep us indoors much profit and solid amusement may be gained by these studies of pond life within the house Even in winter after the snow is on the ground one can break through the ice of roadside ponds and with a small net capture nearly all the insects we have spoken of in this number and keep watch upon their habits and study their anatomy with the aid of the needle and lens He can also turn to the lower forms such as the water fleas rotifers infusoria and rhizopods with which the waters teem winter and summer and find with a few dips of tlie net material for weeks of observation and study 32 THE POPULATION OF AN APPLE TEEE IGl 7 The Jfopulatmn of an JJpple Tree A FRENCH author has written a very pleasant little book entitled the Population of a Pear Tree Of the population of an apple tree a ponderous tome could be written but in this essay on the insects injuring this facile princeps of our fruit trees we shall confine our selves mainly to the more injuiious kinds giving a brief and condensed account of the most important species About seventyfive species in all are known to prey upon the apple tree We may first consider those kinds found PREYING UPON THE ROOTS TJie Pear Blight or Eriosoma ivjri Fig 127 a the gall 6 larva c female c leg e beak antenna of female Fig 127 Blight Insect 7 of larva after Riley sometimes causes a good deal of disturbance to the health of the tree lessening the vigor of its growth and causing the leaves to turn of a paler and more yellowish hue than usual If there is no borer under  the bark nor any other apparent cause and if it be a young tree it may be found on removing the soil from tlie roots that a number of galllike excrescences sometimes a couple of inches in diameter are attached to them On opening the galls a number of small wingless plant lice with larger winged ones will be observed in the crevices Their bodies are covered with a woolly exudation whence their common name woolly blight Dr Fitch who has given us the best account of this anno3dng blight insect says that the parent insect at the end of autumn works her way down along the side of the root there depositing her stock of eggs and then the grand aim of her life accomplished she dies When the ground becomes warm in spring the 3oung appear and forthwith plunge their beaks into the bark The beak thus inserted acts like a seton in the flesh of an ani mal and keeps up a constant irritation An abnormal cellgrowth sets in bringing about a permanent enlargement which undermines the health of the tree It is especially injurious in nurseries of young trees Dr Fitch wisely recommends that when the tree is found to be infested it should not be thrown away but the roots should be dipped in soap suds and when replanted a shovel ful of ashes should be mixed with the dirt This insect is a near ally of the famous Phylloxera of the vine Another insect not usually suspected of injuring the apple by suckiuG the sai of the Fig 128 j o i roots is the 3oung of the Ci cada Fig 128 enlarged which lives for sixteen 3ears sucking the roots usually of the oak but is sometimes Young Cicada attack the roots of the apple It may be imagined that sixteen years drainage of the sap of the tree is a pretty serious matter The vouno insect lives a foot or two beneath the surface of the JO 2 PACKAitD THE POPULATION OF AN APPLE TPtEE 103 ground The Cicada also at times breaks off the twigs of the apple in lajing its eggs in them INFESTING THE TRUNK OP THE TREE The Apple Tree Borer It is not particular creditable to our fruit growers that the apple tree borer still maintains such a sway in our orchards and that we pa an annual tribute of trees and apples Which were its value set forth in figures would appall the orchardist The borer is the most widely extended and wholesale in its destruction of all the insects which prey upon the apple The canker worm is local and even then less injurious taking only the leaves and apples but leaving the trees So with the tent cater pillar and bud worm but the borer has almost finished its work of destruction and the tree is doomed ere we have read its deathwarrant The history of this beetle is as fol lows during the night and sometimes in the hottest da3s of the first week of July in New England and in May and June in the western states the female beetle flies around the trunk of the tree and during this period she deposits her eggs in the bark near the root of the tree How many eggs she lays at one time is not known but she deposits one agg in a place upon the bark low down at or very near the surface of the earth but when these beetles are numerous some of their eggs are placed higher up particularly in the axils where the lower limbs proceed from the trunk Fitch Aliout a fortnight after the eggs are laid the 3oung grub hatches and immediatcl begins to eat its way upwards according to Harris or downwards according to Fitch This grub is a little footless white worm with the segment next to the head large and thick and only differs in size from the fully grown worm Fig 129 pupa c beetle after Ililey Says Dr Fitch If the outer dark colored surface of the bark be scraped off with a knife the last of August or forepart of September so as to expose tlie clean 3 164 white bark beneath as can easily be done without any injury to the tree wherever there is a joung worm it can easily be detected A little blackish spot rather larger than a kernel of wheat will be discovered wherever an egg has been de posited and by cutting slightly into the bark the worm will be found It gradually works its way onwards through the bark increasing in size as it advances until it reaches the sapwood here it takes up its abode feeding upon and con suming the soft wood hereby forming a smooth round flat cavity the size of a dollar or larger immediately under the bark It keeps its burrow clean by pushing its excrement out of a small crevice or opening through the bark which it Fig 129 Apple Tree Borer makes at the lower part of its burrow and if this orifice becomes clogged up it opens another This excrement resembles new fine sawdust and enables us readily to de tect the presence of tlie worm by the little heap of this substance which is accumulated on the ground commonly covering the hole out of which it is extruded and by par ticles of it which adhere around the orifice when it is higher up or in the fork of the tree the outer surface of the bark also often becomes slightly depressed or flattened over this cavity When half grown it sinks into the solid heart wood of the tree and obliterates the flat cell filling it up with its casting1G5 and lives in a cylindrical hole it then ceases to eject its castings simply pushing them behind it According to Riley it is within a few da3s of three years old before it is ready to change to a pupa instead of two as generallj stated Before it becomes fully grown it leaves the heart of the tree and makes its way to the bark just beneath which it transforms making a rude cocoon of chips eight or ten inches from its starting point It pupates late in the spring in May and appears in June and early in July The beetle Fig 129 c is a brown beetle with long antennas with two distinct white stripes Its primitive home is the June berry and mountain ash while it also infests the haw thorne wild apple the quince and sometimes the pear Having become acquainted with the habits of the insect we are prepared to deal in an intelligent way with it When the tree is found to be badly infested the readiest way is to cut the worms out or pour in boiling water In the autumn the bark should be carefully examined and the young worms be dug out The best preventive measure is to apply soap to the trunks of young trees in June or in May in the western states and surround the trunks with tarred paper This will baffle the beetle in laying her eggs The Buprestid Borers Two beetles of this family infest the trunk of tlie apple in their larval stage They have hard bodies with a rough exterior fjg 130 and have the power of snapping up in the air when placed on their backs The most common is Chrysohothris femorata Fig 130 natural size a larva The grub is much flattened behind the liead forming a rounded expansion behind which the bod is Chrysobothns slender and cylindrical This is the characteristic form of the larvie of this extensive group of borers The grub lives a year under the bark of the apple and oak The beetle is 5 166 greenish black above with a brassy hue especially on the raised transverse spots It may be seen from May until July sunning itself on the bark of the trees in the crevices of which it inserts its eggs As in the common borer just described it gnaws its way into the heart of the tree but it only lives over one summer From the flattened form of its body it makes a broad flat and not a cdindrical hole like that of the common borer the gallery a little over an inch in length leading upwards from where the young larva began to work A very similar species C Harrisli or Harris apple borer is sometimes very destructive to the apple though the red maple seems to have been its original home The same remedies should be applied in dealing with these borers as with the young of the striped beetle The rvJdteUned Psenocerus Though this beetle in the larva state is more commonly found tunnelling the stems of currant bushes and sometimes boring into arane Fig 131 o I stems yet it has been known to be injurious in apple orchards The beetle is a lougicoru witli a very round cylindrical body It is dark red dishbrown with a swelling at the base of the wingcovers an oblique yellowish white line on the basal third and a broad curved white line on the outer third of the Avingcover Tlie arub Psenocerus Fig 131 enlarged about three times is nearly half an inch in length with a honey jellow head scarcely half as wide as the bod while the segments of the body are rather convex each having two rows of minute warts It devours the sap wood and inner portion of the bark and also the pith of the branches thus locally killing the termi nal twigs and causing the bark to shrivel and peel oflf leaving a distinct dead line Each grub lives in a burrow about an inch and a half long and five such burrows occur in a portion of the branch five inches long The grubs lie come fully grown during the middle of August Dr Fitch says that about the first of June the female deposits her eggs The grubs change to chr3salides early in the spring and in New York the beetles appear earlj in May The Cylindrical Bark Borer or Tomicics maU produces a disease like fireblight causing the bark to shrivel and peel off and killing the branches Dr Fitch states that young thrift trees when attacked by this beetle soon after putting forth their leaves in the spring suddenly wither as though scorched by fire the bark becoming loosened from the wood and soon after numerous perforations like pin holes appear revealing the secret of the sudden destruction befalliug the tree All these bark boring beetles have a common form that of a C3linder squarely docked at the end looking as though they had been made by the inch and then cut up into lengths of about a line each The body is cov pjq 132 ered over with fine hairs so that it acts as a brush like those used for cleaning lamp chim neys The end of the body is sometimes scooped out like a gouge so that the little beetle can shovel out the dirt from its house in a true Mile sian fashion The use of the hairs undoubtedly is seen when the insect lajs its eggs The female Toinicus beetle tunnels a hole in the bark and makes little notches at intervals in which it deposits an egg On her returu by means of the short stiflT hairs projecting from her bod she brushes the dirt into the little notches thus covering up and protecting her eggs Figure 132 represents the Tomicus XTjlofjraphits enlarged several times Tills is a timber beetle and there are several allied forms but all are much like the apple bark borer It seems from the observations of JM Ferris as quoted by Dr Fitch that tlie bark boriug beetles ie those infesting fruit trees differ from the timber lcetles in an interesting peculiarity In the bark beetles there is a division of labor the males doing most of the work There are commonly several males in company with Ijut 7 168 HALF HOUES WITH INSECTS Packakd one female and the former appear to perform the chief part of the labor in the excavation of their galleries With the timber beetles on the other hand the females are much the more numerous and probably mine their galleries without any assistance from the other sex M Ferris states of one of the species that upwards of fifty females were met with in the burrows they had excavated without a single male being found there As the young hatch out they run galleries either at right angles to the original one or branching out in every direc tion though never intercrossing In this way those that confine themselves entirely to the sap wood and inner bark loosen it interrupt the circulation of sap and kill the branch affected The Apple Tivig Borer or AmpMcerus bicaudatus Fig 133 is an exceedingly annoying beetle in the middle and Fig in3 western states It somewhat resembles the bark boring beetles but belongs to a different family The grub is not known with certainty to burrow in the apple but the beetles late in the summer bore into the twigs of the apple beginning ac Amphiceius cording to Rile just above a bud or fork whence it bores downwards an inch and a half into the twig usually in wood of the previous jears growth Both the male and female beetles bore these holes and may always be found in them head downwards during the winter and spring months The holes are made for food and protection and not for breeding purposes As a preventive measure the infested twigs should be cut off and burned the trees being looked over in the autumn The PricMy Leptostylus is the last borer which we have on our list of boring beetles Dr Fitch says that the grubs are like the young of the apple tree borer and sometimes occur in multitudes under tlie bark forming long narrow winding tracks upon the outer surface of the wood these THE POPULATION OF AN APPLE TPEE 169 tracks becoming broader as the worm has increased in size The beetle appears late in August in New York It is a brown beetle its wingcovers prickly whence the name Lep tostyhis acuhfenis and with a white curAed or Vsliaped band behind the middle of the wingcovers and a black streak on their hind edge It is about a third of an inch long The Apple LeiojJus Fig 134 is a new comer in our or chards having lately been found in all its stages of growth Fig 134 Fig 135 Apple Leiopus Leiopus of Prickly Ash in the rotten limbs The grub is so closely allied to that of another species Leiopus xanthoxyli Fig 135 beetle 13G a larva h head yiq i30 seen from above and c seen from beneath that a woodcut draw ing will answer for both It differs mainly in hav ing a smaller head and a slenderer body It seems from what little we know of the halits of these insects that there is probably but Larva of Leiopus xantloxyli one brood of beetles a 3car and that they fly about and lay their eggs on the bark of the tree late in June and probably 9 170 HALF HOUES WITH INSECTS during July Upon hatching the young larvae boie in under the bark and become fully grown in the autumn spending the winter under the bark probably both in the fig i37 larva and pupa states the beetles appearing during midsummer The Scale Insect Mytilaspis pomonim Bouche or Aspicliotiis conchiformis of different authors Fig 137 This next to the borer is by far the most prevalent and destructive enemy of the apple tree The scale surrounds the body of the female while the male is twowinged and flies about ac tively It closely resembles the Pine scale insect figured on page 39 The female lays her eggs Fig 138 1 in August under the scale protecting her body and the young 2 hatch out in June when they may be found running over the bark By the middle or last of the month they become anchored by their long hairlike beak and the Sie insect day after as Riley states a white waxy secretion begins to issue from the body as seen in 3 During a period from the 6th to the middle of July the larva loses Fig 138 Apple Scale Insect its legs and feelers and assumes the form of the adult female 5 Soon after the insect moults and its cast skin remains attached to tbe insect as at 4 By the first of August the growth of the scale insect is completed and it has the appearance of an ojster shell as seen at 7 By the middle of August in the western states where Mr Riley studied its habits the female lays her eggs which do not hatch till the following June It will be seen that the best method of warding off the attacks of this pest is to thorouglily scrape the bark of the tree in the early autumn and again in the beginning of June when the 3oang are swarming over tlie surface of the bark At this time the bark should be washed with whale oil soap But it is to the natural insect parasite when reared and set loose in the orchard that we are to look for the means of restraining within proper limits this insect This is the minute ichneumon fl Aphelinus figured on page 42 The majority of the insects injurious to the apple are found FEEDING ON THE LEAVES The American Tent Caterjnllar or CJisiocampa Americana is known to every farmers boy from the social habits of the caterpillar which lives protected from the hot sun or inclem ency of the weather under a broad tent of white silk Not very creditably to orchardists and farmers the are a con spicuous object at the beginning of summer whether in the New Eigland Western or Middle states The caterpillar is easily recognized by its large size being about two inches in length and by the long brown hairs and bright colors of the body which is yellow with numerous fine eiinkled black lines forming low down on the sides of the body a black band with a blue spot on the side of each ring Along the middle of the back is a conspicuous white stripe It becomes full groAvn by the first or middle of June the period varying with its geographical position When about to make its cocoon it stops eating and wanders restlessly about in search of a suitable place in which to spin Under 11 172 HALP HOURS WITH INSECTS a board or overhanging piece of bark or in any nook or cranny it settles and spins in tlie course of a day or two a dense white cocoon often of a yellowish color which is much like that of the common Chinese silk worm except that it is more pointed at the ends Our tent caterpillar is not a remote ally of the silk worm belonging to the same natural family The supply of silk is by no means exhausted after it spins its cocoon for if it be removed from its silk house after a few hours it surrounds itself by a fresh one and even attempts a third if compelled to by the curiosity of the ex perimenter It remains in its cocoon through the remainder of the month the moth appearing early in July when it enters our rooms with a headlong flight and dashes in a peculiar confused manner upon the table The moth is un usually thickbodied and hairy It is reddishbrown with two oblique dirty white lines on the fore wings and ex pands about an inch and a quarter The female immediately lays her eggs in a mass of three or four hundred standing up side by side around a twig and covered by a gummy secretion These bunches of eggs form conspicuous objects and it is easy to pick them off after the leaves have fallen Before the winter opens the embryo caterpillars are formed and lie in the egg shell all ready to hatch In the spring they hatch out just as the leaves are beginning to unfold and it is curious to watch the habits of the young caterpillais as they gather in colonies and gradu ally spin a silken tent in a fork of the branch They lay down silken paths in every direction over the branches over which they travel back and forth their journeys becom ing longer as the leaves disappear before their ravenous jaws They work in the forenoon and afternoon in pleas sant days taking a siesta at noon or in stormy weather huddle up together upon or under their silken canop This caterpillar so large and conspicuous is easily dealt with as the nests can be easily removed by a brush or mop dipped 12 Tackvrd the POPULATIOISr OF AN APPLE TREE 173 in strong soap suds or a weak solution of coal oil or carbolic acid The original home of this moth is the wild cherry An other closely allied species sometimes found on the apple for which it deserts its favorite foodtree the oak is the Forest tent caterpillar It differs from the other species in having a row of spots along the back instead of a continuous line The moth differs in the wings being more pointed at the apex and in the transverse lines being rust brown Not only do certain carnivorous beetles and a parasitic fly Tachina prey upon the caterpillar but we have also found a small chalcid fly lurking under the mass of eggs in which it was undoubtedly parasitic TJie Canker Worm The traveller through eastern Mas sachusetts particularly in the neighborhood of Boston is often struck during the early weeks of June by the desolate appearance of the orchards which look as if a fire had passed through them There is not a green thing on the trees but all the branches are hung with a multitude of skeleton ized leaves rusty sere and fluttering feebly in the breeze This is not the work of fire but an evidence of the industry of the canker worm This scene has been repeated ever since the apple has been raised or at least for a century and is liable to be repeated for a hundred years to come unless a law is enacted to compel negligent farmers and gardeners to properly protect their trees When the buds of the apple leaves are opening we shall on careful examination find a few little dark worms scarcely thicker than a horse hair nibbling the exposed edges of the opening leaves Before people are aware of it these tiny caterpillars become nearly an inch long and defoliate the tree One can stand near the tree and hoar the nibbling of thousands of little teeth No one attempts to arrest tlic progress of the de stroers and their advent is looked upon with disma min gled however with a large proportion of fatalism No one 13 174 HxLF HOURS WITH rNSECTS seems to attempt to remove them The loss of the leaves does not kill the trees but prevents the growth of any apples When these canker worms are fully grown ie about four or five weeks after they are hatched between the 17th and 27th of June about Boston they will be found to vary exceedingly in color some individuals being blackish others greenishyellow The average style of coloration is an ash color on the back beneath yellowish with a black stripe on the sides It has a less number of feet than most caterpillars which gives it a halting looping gait as if carefully measuring the ground over which it is walking hence the name geometer Deserting its tree top it either creeps down tlie trunk of the tree or lets itself down after the manner of most caterpillars by means of a silken thread spun from a little opening in its under lip It doesnt wan der about but immediately burrows from two to six inches in the loose soil under the tree and then forms a rude loose earthen cocoon fastening the particles of dirt together with silk Twentfour hours after the cocoon is finished the worm changes to a chrjsalis which is rather pointed in front and light brown in color Here the insect remains until after the October frosts when on warm days between the cold snaps late in October and in November and December and even in some exception all warm days during the rest of the winter the adult insects come forth Nature has endowed the sexes quite difierentl the male is winged and flies about in a modest Quaker garb of gray fluttering with broad weak wings about the trunks of the trees and paying court to the grublike wingless females which are less flighty than their mates A larger propor tion of individuals appear in the spring than winter This provision of nature that a part of the brood shall appear in the autumn and a part in the spring ensures the life of the species since if it were not represented in part by the eggs and clnysalides a severe winter might destroy the latter 14 THE POPULATION OF AN APPLE TKEE 175 and cut off the brood The eggs have so thick a shell that it seems impossible that even great extremes of tem perature should destroy them They are laid in broad patches of from sixty to a hundred or more standing up side by side They are glued together and to the bark or paling by a grayish varnish secreted by a gland in the end of the bod In dealing with this caterpillar the obvious preventive measure is to keep the females from ascending the trunks of the trees and laying their eggs on the branches This is done in a cheap and efficacious way by surrounding the trunk of the tree with a band of tarred paper and anointing it with printers ink If the ink is daily applied this is a cheap and sure preventive Another one involving more expense but less time and trouble is to surround the base of the trunk with a wooden trough kept filled with oil or ink or it may be raised and made of zinc and filled with whale oil But all these methods are useless unless the shiftless and careless are compelled to cooperate with those who take pains to keep their trees free from the caterpillars We have ventured to suggest in our first Report on the Injurious and Beneficial Insects of Massachusetts that it is only by combination between farmers and orchardists that these and other pests can be kept under As we then said The matter can be best reached b legislation we have fish and game laws why should wc not frame a law provid ing that farmers and all those owning a garden or orchard sliould cooperate in taking preventive measures against inju rious insects such as early or late planting of cereals to avert the attacks of the Wheat midge and Hessian fly the burning of stublle in the autumn and spring to destroy the joint worm the combined use of proper remedies against the canker worm the various cut worms and other noxious caterpillars A law carried out by a proper state entomo logical constabulary if it may be so designated could com 15 176 HALF HOUPtS WITH INSECTS pel the idle and shiftless to clear their farms and gardens of noxious animals We trust that those interested will not suffer this matter to drop but that a law correcting this abuse of privilege in letting these destructive insects run riot may be framed and passed Among the natural enemies of the canker worm is the Calosoma scrutator Fig 139 a beautiful ground beetle which ascends the trunlis of the trees and devours the cater pillars Certain wasps particularly the Eumenes store up the caterpillars in their nests The Tachina fly and an icli Pjq jgg neumon fly are also said to prey on them while hogs and fowl devour the chrysalides Next to the parasitic ichneu mons however the smaller birds aie the most efficacious in destroying them I extract as follows from a paper in the American Naturalist May 1874 important testimony on this point I am indebted to Mr C J Maynard of Ipswich for the Calosoma scrutator following information upon the birds which devour the canker worm He informs me that in the course of his investigations he has opened the stomachs of some three thousand birds In answer to your questions relative to birds eating can ker worms and the larvae of other injurious insects I would say that upon examining my notes I find that I have taken canker worms from the stomachs of the following species redeyed vireo Vireo oUvaceus song sparrow 3Ielospiza melodia chickadee Parus atricapillus scarlet tanager Pyranga rubra robin Turdus migratorius black

blackbird Agelaius plioiniceus cow blackbird Molothrus pecoris bobolink Dolichonyx oryzivorus Baltimore oriole Icterus Baltimore Possibly this list may be increased Besides these birds those species which occur in orchards during autumn and winter such as the ruby crowued wren brown creeper nut hatches and titmice doubtless eat laxgely of the eggs of canker worms and other insects which destroy or injure the trees Winter birds of the above species which I have shot at this time have their stomachs crammed with insects of some kind As I remarked to you the other evening the Baltimore oriole will eat largely of the tent caterpillar and is the only bird which will do this All the thrushes will eat wire worms The swallows de stroy multitudes of dipterous insects gnats etc In fact to sum the matter up there is scared a bird which will not eat largely of insects at certain seasons when these pests are most abundant It is a noticeable fact that many species inhabiting woods and meadows as may be seen by the list given leave their 12 17 178 HALF HOUliS WITH INSECTS usual haunts and visit the fruit trees wliich are covered with canker worms and kxrgely devour them In reference to the currant saw fly worm Nematus ventri cosus I am not certain that I have seen an birds eat them 5et I think the truly insectivorous species will do this That the Baltimore oriole sometimes eats large quantities of the American tent caterpillar Clisiocanvpa Americana since tliey have been found in the stomach of this bird by Mr Maynard is an interesting fact for birds as a rule do not relish hsdvy caterpillars and the Anaerican tent caterpil lar is covered with long hairs though they are not so dense as in some other larvae In Europe the closely allied tent caterpillar C neustria and those of the Cnethocampa and Liparis chrysorrhasa are said by Perris and others to be almost untouched by birds I have been told by Dr T M Brewer of Boston that the English sparrows upon the com mon devoured all the caterpillars of the tussock moth Or gyia which were injuring a fine tree These caterpillars are very hair being adorned with pencils and tufts of long hairs Mr John H Sears of Danvers Mass who has paid much attention to the habits of our birds informs me that the cuckoo which breeds near houses is an exceedingly useful bird as it devours the canker worms in large num bers It is well that this should be known as there is a popular prejudice against this bird from its habit of suck ing the eggs as well as laying its eggs in the nests of other birds Among the birds which he has himself ob served in the act of eating canker worms are the king bird the Baltimore oriole the cat bird the common fl catcher the least flycatcher or wood pewee the red eyed vireo and a few other small birds such as certain war blers and flycatchers The king bird in the month of May feeds on May beetles as stated by Mr J L Hersey in this journal IS THE POPULATION OF AN APPLE TREE 179 I also quote from a letter on the subject for which I am iiulebted to Dr T M Brewer Tlie most noticeable of all the destroyers of the canker worm is the common cedar bird which devours them to an extent perfectly enormous Next is the purple grakle which also feeds on them as long as they last The house pigeon if in any numbers is an invaluable bird See for instance a garden corner of Summer and Chestnut streets Salem where the pigeons make canker worms a thing unknown Among the other birds all excellent so far as they go are the chipping sparrow the song sparrow the purple finch all the vireos whiteeyed redeyed yellowthroated solitary and warbling the king bird the cat bird the downy wood pecker the summer yellow bird Maryland yellow throat the bluebird The bluejay eats their eggs in the winter so does the chickadee The latter eats their grub also and the worm too The common gray creeper which is with us onl in the winter eats the eggs Last summer I had a nest of goldenwinged woodpeckers breeding on my place at Hingham Some of them dug into my barn and passed the winter Only a part of my trees were protected by a belt of printers ink and some of them were partially eaten but this winter very few grubs have as yet shown themselves and I give my friend Colaptes aura tus the credit of all this I know tliis I gave tlie young ones a lot of worms myself and they ate them as if they were used to them The old birds were too shy to permit me to sec their good deeds I think the golden robin feeds its young with them as long as they last but I am not sure that they eat the tent caterpillar I nearly forgot the two cuckoos yellowbill and blackbill They eat every form of caterpillar canker worms included 1 do not think the robin feeds any to its joung because it would never do they are too small and its brood want a big lot I have known the robin to feed its younfr 19 180 for entire days as fast as they could bring tliem with the moth of the cutworm That is about as much as we could expect any bird to do at one time At the rate they went they must have caught and given their young ones about five hundred of these moths in a da Before that I had supposed that the robin did me more harm than good but I had to give in My indebtedness to that pair was worth all the cherries I could raise in many years So the robin and I are fast friends From the facts already presented it may be inferred how useful birds may become in the work of reducing the num ber of injurious insects Undoubtedly we have suffered greatly by our wanton killing of the smaller birds We are far behind European nations in caring for the insect eating kinds and providing nests for them about our houses and gardens The Swiss and French have been the most farsighted in this matter of the protection of the smaller insectivorous species The English Scandinavians and Germans foster them while in our country teeming as it is with hosts of ravaging insects the smaller birds are hunted and persecuted or if let alone there is no effort made on any extended scale to invite them to our houses and gardens The Apple Sphinx This modest gray hawk moth rather smaller than the generality of the species appears in June and lays scattered eggs on the leaves from Avhich the cater pillars hatch They are large peagreen worms with seven oblique violet stripes along each side and a horn on the end of the body It is the Sphinx gorcllus The larva of another hawk moth with a rough granular skin a bluish horn and seven yellowish white streaks on the side is also found on the apple The moth is fawn colored with the wings notched the hinder pair bearing a large black eye spot centred with blue It is the Smeriyithus exccucatus The Swalloiv Tail Butterfly The caterpillar of Pcqnlio Turnus is occasionally found on the leaves of the apple It 20 THE POPULATION OF AJST APPLE TEEE 181 is a smooth fat green worm ¦with two eyelike spots beliind the head It changes to a chrysalis in August These three caterpillars do little or no harm to the tree and are only mentioned on account of their large size and curious appearance The Apple Nola We have not ourselves identilled the caterpillar of this well known moth It is said by Di Fitch to be a rather thick cylindrical light green worm an inch long with five white lines and numerous white dots and was observed eating notches and lioles in the leaves It changes to a cocoon in a curved leaf The moth appears in Julj and also hibernates flying about in spring It is gray crossed by three zigzag black lines It is the Nola vicdana The Bud Worm One of the most injurious insects of the apple tree nesit to the canker worm that we have is a small reddishbrown larva which during certain years threatens in some localities the extinction of our apple crop It was described by Harris in his Treatise on the Insects injurious to Vegetation under the name of Penthina ocidcnia and should now be named Grapholitha oculana The caterpillar is a small cylindrical naked worm about a third of an inch in length and of a uniform reddishbrown with small warts from which aiise short fine hairs while tlie head and upper side of the prothoracic ring or segment next the head is black On May 16th I noticed this caterpillar on the apple and also the pear and cherr perforating the half expanded leaf and flower buds They were very abundant on these buds and afterwards when the leaves had partially expanded they had folded them It seems to hatch out about the time that the canker worms and American tent catorpiUars leave their eggs that is about the first daj of Ma when the buds unfold The last of May and the first week of Ji«ic they were swaxmiug in orchards throughout eastern 21 182 HALF IlOUPtS WITH rNgECTS Massachusetts man persons noticing their attacks and it seems to be a common insect all over New England When fully grown it crumples the leaves disfiguring the whole tree and doing great damage to the fruitbuds and flowers thus directly lessening the apple and pear crop About the first of June the cease eating and make a loose delicate silken cocoon in the folded leaf They remain several days sometimes nearly two weeks in this condition before assuming the chrysalis state about the IGth of June and the moths are seen flying about and entering houses attracted by the light within during the last week of June and the first of July The chrysalis is brown and of the usual shape and as Hanis states has but a single row of teeth along the dorsal side of each abdominal segment After the moth has slipped out of the pupa case the empty shell re mains attached by the tip of the abdomen to the surface of the leaf The moth is of a dark ash color the fore wings being usu ally paler in the middle The basal third of the wing is dark ash mottled with paler scales the outer edge of the dark area being angulated just behind the middle of the wing The costa is marked with light and dark bands On the outer third the wing is nearly as dark as on the base near the outer edge and halfway between the costa and hind edge are four wellmarked longitudinal black spots or short lines running parallel with the costa or Iront edge of the wing the one nearest the costa is simply an elongated dot the second and largest is an oblong spot and twice as wide as the third spot while the fourth again is much smaller There are three similar black marks situated on the inner edge at the outer third of the wing When the wings are folded over the back these black marks collec tively make a rudely triangular figure The outer third of the wing is also variously banded and mottled with leaden blue and tawny brown scales The fringe is brown ud 22 THE P0PULATI0N OF AN APPLE TREE 183 leaden blue The hind wings are dark ash biown Beneath the fore Yings are not mottled but uniformly dark ash brown and a shade lighter than the upper surface of the hind wings It expands about 55 of an inch It varies in the distribution of the black spots and in the degree of angularity of the outer edge of the basal dark portion of the fore wings and in some specimens the middle of the wing is concolorous with the other parts and the peculiar leaden blue scales are scattered over the whole wing with a black patch on the inner third of the Aving near the inner edge In some specimens there are more than four dots near the outer edge of the wing forming a trans verse row As these worms attack the fruit and leafbuds it is diffi cult to pick them off by the hand without injuring the buds nor is it easy to apply whaleoil soap or a weak solution of carbolic acid Both of these remedies however should be tried especially showering the terminal branches of the tree with soap suds or a very weak solution of carbolic acid A faithful application for one season of these and other remedies will materially lessen the numbers of this formid able pest The Palmer Worm During the latter part of June as observed on the Hudson River the leaves of the apple be come badly wormeaten with the remnants carelessl sewn together with fine silken threads Wlieu the bunch of leaves is disturbed out scrambles a pale yellowish green catrpil lar with a dusky stripe along each side edged above witli a narroAV white stripe and drois a few inches hanging sus pended by a thread This is the Palmer worm described under the name of ChoitocJiibcs pometellas Harris This insect has not been of late years at all common in our orchards We »avc had no personal acquaintance with it and the following account of it is condensed from Fitchs admirable description There are insect years as well as  Pacicaed apple years Seasons when through favoring causes certain species appear in extraordinar numbers The causes would not seem to be wholly climatic for during seasons that may seem to be peculiarly favorable to insect life every species does not abound in equal numbers It seems more probable that the increase in a species is owing to a decrease in the numbers of the ichneumons attacking it though the causes leading to the partial extinction of the ichneumon may be unknown How full of interest would be a study of such phenomena as the periodical or unusual abundance of certain animals No subject could be more attractive to the biolo gist while none is of more practical importance to the gar dener or farmer and it is just such studies as these that our young students should take up In the year 1791 says Fitch the orchards and forests of New England were overrun by this worm and the leaves of the apple oak and other trees were devoured by it It was at this time that it received the name Palmer worm by which it has since been currently designated This name was evidently derived from our English translation of the sacred scriptures Another insect which a month or two before had devastated the fruit trees to an extent never pre viously known appears simultaneously to have received the name which it still retains the canker worm for previously to this date we find this name given to what is now called the army worm Leucania unipunctata Another re markable visitation of these insects occurred in the 3ear 1853 unparalleled by any event of this kind within tlie mem ory of the present generation It appeared suddenly in excessive numbers from Maine to eastern New York The Palmer worm appears about the middle of June about the time the canker worm is entering the earth and continues till the close of the month It strips off the foliage thus emulating the gastronomical feats of the canker worm Dr Fitch says that should after a Aisitation from these worms the weather during the month of July prove to be dry and hot as it frequently is the damage is much more extensive whole orchards and forests perishing In 1853 the worms continued in full force until the night of the 23d of June when brisk showers occurred accompanied with heavy thun der terminating the drouth which had prevailed and with this the worms suddenly disappeared In one orchard a thousand bushels of apples were destroyed that being the usual yield When they are young these worms eat only the green pulpy tissues of the leaf leaving its network of veins entire But as they become larger and more robust the consume the whole of the leaf except the coarse veins It is the 3oung and tender leaves however which grow at or near the tips of the limbs which they prefer the older and tougher leaves are commonly eaten only at their tip ends and have irregular holes of various sizes gnawed in them some of these holes being no larger than a puncture made with a pin The green succulent ends of the twigs are also frequently eaten off And the young apples which were nearly as large as wahiuts when these worms made their appearance almost without exception had either round holes or larger irregular cavities gnawed in their surface Thus wounded they wilt and fall from the tree a few only having the wounds so slight that they recover and remain upon the tree until they ripen The moth into which the Palmer worm transforms closely resembles the Gelechia of the granaries It is of an ash gray color with six or seven equidistant black dots at the base of the fringe on the outer edge of the wing In the middle of the wing are four larger dark dots which are placed olliqucly with regard to each other the wings ex pand between a half and threequarters of an inch It belongs to the family of Tineids which have small narrow wings with long silky fringes The common clothes moth is a tyie of the family Fitch recommends showering the 25 186 HALP HOURS WITH IjSTSECTS trees with whaleoil soap diluted with water Frequent drenchings natural as well as artificial are extremely nseful in ridding trees of caterpillars and turning the hose on infested trees is an excellent remedy against all sorts of caterpillars particularly the bud worm and Palmer worm The Twin Spotted Leaf Miner Another of that exquisite family the Tineids often infests the apple in immense num bers mining the leaves leaving a serpentine blotch to mark the site of its gallery It bears the sesquipedalian name of Litliocolletis geminateUa It is figured in all its stages on plate 8 of the Guide to the Study of Insects The little caterpillar is slightly over a line in length 14 inch of a pale livid reddish hue with a black head the segment behind the head being also blackish When it becomes fully fed it transforms into a chrjsalis within its mine When dis turbed it crawls rapidly out of its domicile and hangs sus pended by a thread unwittingly open to the attacks of the smaller birds to whom all these minute leafiolling and mining caterpillars are a dainty tit bit Indeed were it not for the Ivind offices of these feathered friends of ours these tiny thieves would leave no food for their giant friends the canker worms and tent caterpillars The worms occur throughout the last of summer and early autumn Avhile the moths first appeared in Salem on the 19th of August flying in doors during the niSht attracted by the light It is a beautiful creature with long narrow delicate wings fringed with long lashes with a yellowish tuft of hairs on the top of the head It is of a dark slate gray color with an eyelike spot at the end of the fore wings pupilled with black like the eye in a peacocks tail The Apple Biicculatrix Closely rcscmljling in its general appearance the preceding moth this beautiful form is much paler almost whitish with jellowish scales and a curved black line curving around to the apex of the wing ending in an eyelike spot on the outer edge in the middle of the 26 Packaed the POPULATIO OF AN apple tree 187 Fig 140 wing is a bhick oval spot The caterpillar I have not de teoted It is described however ly Dr Clemens as being dark 3ellowish green tinged with reddish in front with a brown head ft was found feeding externally on the leaves late in September Early in October it changes to a chrysa lis within a long wdiite cocoon slenderer but about as long as a grain of rice it is tough and thick and ribbed exter nally It is a common object found attached to the bark of the tree in May as well as the autumn and winter These little moths are not exempt from parasitic ichneumons of exceeding minuteness which send them to an early grave Indeed the mortality among moths is greatest during their childhood when they are in the chrysalis state While a few caterpillars like very many hu man children die of overeating the greater number of deaths are due to causes beyond the control of the cat erpillar In Europe twelve hundred species of minute chalcid ichneumon flies are known to exist and of tliese many prey on tlic Tineids I have found a most singular form preying on the Bucculatrix of the cedar B thiciella Fig 140 enlarged a co coon natural size which closel resembles the apple moth In endeavoring to rear the moth from the cocoon I found that nearly half of the cocoons gathered from a cedar tree in mj 3ard failed to give out their appropriate tenant but instead rendered account in the form of minute beautifully brilliant green flies with golden metallic tints The antennae branched out like the antlers of a reindeer each having at the end five branches somewhat resembling a Jaianese comb These little flies are wortli far more than their weight in gold and were their worth duly appreciated our gardeners would look upon the 27 Bucculatinc tluiielhi 188 HALF HOUES WITH INSECTS cultivation of ichneumon flies as tlie rigiit arm of tlie ser vice in an enlightened agriculture The Apple MIcropiteryx The most abundant leaf miner of the apple so bus a laborer that for several jears past nearly every other leaf on the apple trees in my garden wit nesses their plodding patient work is the Micropteryx po mivorella nearly all these minute slenderwinged moths have monstrously long names The caterpillar is a minute dark peagreen flat worm the body thickest in the middle and very soft It is about a line in length It eats its way in the interior of the leaf between the upper and the under side feeding on the soft pulp Its burrow is marked by a broad waved dark line on the leaf which widens at the farther end and is somewhat puflTed out owing to the presence of the fully fed caterpillar In this little terminal chamber the worm rests and when anxious to leave it in order to spin its cocoon effects its escape through a slit which it has had the instinct or com mon sense previously to cut with its jaws So abundant is it that multitudes of these little green worms may be seen hanging helplessly from the leaves of the tree Suspended by this thread they swing to and fro until they strike some twig whence they go to the bark of the trunk and laiger branches Here in warm days late in September and early in October the worms spin a peculiar flattened round silken jellow cocoon about a line in diameter In con finement I have noticed that it will spin its cocoon on the leaves but in nature it is careful to deposit them on the branches where it remains through the winter The larva completes the cocoon at least all that is visible within the space of one hour The moth was found in considerable abundance resting on the under side of appleleaves the 19th of June The bodj and wings are of an uniform dark bronze hue with purple and metallic reflections the fringe is

body is 07 and of the body including the folded wings onetenth of an inch Tlie Sac Bearer Another winged gem with a still more curious childhood than the Micropterjx is a sac bearer as the Germans call it Like a boy in a meal sack with his arms sprawling about and pulling himself along the little caterpillar pokes its head out of its case extends its six fore legs like so many hands and pulls itself over the leaf its little world The worm is flattened green and no thicker than a small knitting needle The case or sac is oval open at each end much flattened and roomy enough for its inhab itant to turn around in How the case is constructed we have been unable to observe While some sac bearers cut an oblong slit in the leaf fold it over and then cutting a corresponding slit remove the folded portion fasten together with silk the open side wriggle into this straight jacket and walk off as if they had been born with their houses on their backs others probably construct their cases out of fine bits of leaf stuck together Avith tlie silken glue secreted frona the glands emptying into their mouths The material of such cases resembles a thick feltlike cloth and that of our sac bearer is of this nature By the end of August the caterpil lar becomes mature and ready to transform into a chrsalis It does not desert its old coat but hangs it by a few threads to the bark of the tree and contracts its body lies quiet through the winter until early in summer the cluysalis breaks through a rent in its skin and soon after the moth appears It is now one of the most beautiful objects in nature It is very small the head finely dusted its softly 29 190 fringed wings expanding only a fifth of an inch Its fore wings are of a light slate gray color on their inner half and be3ond bright orange enclosing two white bands one situ ated on the front edge and the other arising from the inner edge both nearly meeting in the middle of the wing and edged externally with black

about the house when the apple trees are in blossom and again in the middle of August when the apples are half formed Many may recall the appearance of the repulsive little whitish caterpillar or worm occurring in wormy apples who are not at all acquainted with the moth It is rather smaller than the apple leaf roller with narrower wings and grajdsh ashcolored Across the wings pass slightly marked numerous darker transverse lines with a prominent curved black line edged with a coppery tint near an eyelike patch on the inner angle The wings expand over half an inch She lays her eggs in the calyx of the blossoms of the apple just as the petals are falling The worm hatches in a few days burrowing into the core In three weeks the caterpillar becomes fullsized the apple pre maturely drops the worm deserts it creeps up under the bark of the tree cocooning and in a few da3s after a brood of moths appear They are the parents of the worms which may be found through the winter and early spring under the bark housed in their cocoons Taking advantage of this habit of cocooning in crevices the best plan in dealing with these insects is to wind cloths and bands of straw around the trunks During the last half of summer and the autumn they can be removed every few days and burned and others put in their place When the fruit is stored in the cellar the maggots of three kinds of flies emulate the example of the caterpillar of the coddling moth and further despoil the orchardist and wound the feelings of the lover of good apples 32 INSECTS OF THE FIELD 193 8 Iu86tt8 ni ilxB fwia WE will now

When a tree is separated from its fellows and left stand ing in a field it becomes the centre of attack of many different varieties of insects If an oak its twigs are hung with countless galls the flies as sembling 3ear after year stinging the leaves and branches as surely as the season comes around The same kind of caterpillars annually receive their tribute of leaves and the Fig lis Plusia Chain moth and caterpillar symmetry of the oak is maintained by the judicious pruning of boring beetles and other insects while its boughs afibrd rest and shelter to the birds which in their turn judiciouslj check the too great increase of the insect plunderers and instal a reign of conservative agencies which maintain the oak in its pristine vigor and hands it down from generation to generation of landed proprietors The growth and main tenance of field crops are almost wholly regulated by the insects now that the birds are not allowed a fair chance of restraining the undue increase of these pests Our potato crops are becoming dependent on the number of insects rather than the excellence of artificial fertilizers we may topdress our wheat fields and till the soil never so sedu lousl but the fact is well known that the wheat crop in the eastern states is nearly cut off by the Hessian fly the wheat midge and the joint worm Our corn fields in the far West are dependent on the will of the grasshopper and the chinch bug The losses annually sustained by the assaults of the armies of injurious insects are almost beyond calculation and so quietly and neatly is the work done that few are the farmers who realize the extent of the loss and how it has been effected Not until they study the daily life of these insects and watch them bj day and night and fig U9 know something of their life history until they recognize the fact that as caterpillars and chrysal ides and winged insects they lead different lives have quite different means of livelihood can they appreciate the extent of the powers for mischief in the little beings they trample on unconsciously or in contempt What meaning is there in the bustle and hum ° ® of insect life to which the ears of most of us are deaf The only way to answer this question is to sit down for oneself and watch the daily doings of some one insect and make a record of them by which others may profit The busiest man can devote a few minutes each day to a study of the common insects that enter his window or visit the flowers in his garden He can readily train the ladies of the house hold or the children to aid in the work of observation and by thus combining the aid of several observers test their several results All this does not require a scientific knowl edge of the anatomy and physiology of these creatures only a little patience and interest in the subject of inquiry An 5 19I example of what one may do whose time is occupied with multifarious duties is afforded by the results obtained by Sir John Lubbock and published in a paper entitled Observa tions on Bees and Wasps read at a late 1874 meeting of the Linniean Society of London In order to ascertain how a honey bee fills out the measure of a day he kept some bees in a hive in his room and marked some of them and watched their goings in and out A bee between 7 am and 1252 PM made twentythree visits from the hive to the honey During an hour and twenty minutes of this time access to the honey was cut off Another bee between 723 AM and 1251 pm made nineteen visits to the honey the door being closed for thirty minutes of the time Still another bee between 919 am and 154 pm made twenty visits to the honey Other data are given showing the close application of these bees to their business and that the popular notions as to their busy ways are well founded They apparently work after noon as well as before noon rrru e «r Ouc of Lubbocks marked bees whitefaced Wasp made twentyeight visits be tween 1215 PM and 614 pm Similar experiments made on wasps Fig 150 whitefaced wasp show that they emu late the busy ways of their cousins the bees Indeed it is perhaps not too rash a conclusion to draw from these and observations on other insects that a ceaseless activity per vades the members of the republic of insects and that their moments of rest only result in still greater activity Were it not for this unremitting toil in providing for the welfare of their progeny which in bees especially consists in extracting honey from flowers many species of plants would become extinct Nay it is safe to state that many 6 Packaud insects or THE FIELD 199 kinds of plants would never have been brought into exis tence at all had it not been through the modifying influence of bees and moths The interdependence of insects and plants latel shown to exist b various observers is one of the most striking in nature Many gardeners are aware that bees aid greatly in the fertilization of the flowers of the melon cucumber and squash by conveying the pollen of one flower to another and to those of adjoining gardens This ensures the production of fruit where otherwise many a flower would be barren It is known that a larger crop of apples is raised when a hive of bees is stationed in the or chard The bees visit every flower busily flying from one to another and then passing to an adjoining tree Their bodies dusted over with the pollen rub against the pistils of hundreds of flowers which thus become fertilized In the same manner the moths bobbing their heads into the tubu lar flowers of the orchids and other plants probe them with their long tongues and Avithdraw them with a packet of pol len attached which they leave on the pistil of some other plant In this way the plant maintains its existence and there is no deterioration in the stock since the pollen is conveyed from plants afar off by the bees and too close inandin breeding a thing nature abhors is prevented Now this sort of work is going on far more extensively than was suspected before Mr Darwin called the attention of naturalists to the matter It seems from the studies of Sprengel Darwin Hermann Miillor and others that on the other hand many of the strange modifications in the form of flowers are due to insects Not only are clianges in form produced by the different kinds of insects and their varying mouthparts but it has been boldly suggested that origin ally the scent and color and even the honey of flowers are due to the influence of insects On the other hand any one On Britisli Wild Flowers considered in Relation to Insects By Sir John Lubbock MacmUlan Co 1875 uUUfii ALP HOURS WITH INSECTS Hbyeading the admirably lucid statements of Miiller and Lubboclv can for himself realize how dependent the form of the insect particularly the form of the mouthparts and legs are on the form of the flower As Lubbock remarks there has thus been an interaction of insects upon flowers and of flowers upon insects resulting in the gradual modification of both The transfer of pollen from plants of different varieties or species results in hybrids which are much larger than the original forms Cross fertilization as this is called is an advantage to the plant and is resorted to constantly as ever body knows by horticulturists Lubbock quotes Dar wins remark that all experimenters have been struck with the wonderful vigour height size tenacity of life precocity and hardiness of their hybrid productions Mr Darwin was the first to show that if a flower be fertilized by pollen from a different plant the seedlings so produced are much stronger than if the plant be fertilized by its own pollen Lubbock from whom we take this statement saw these ex periments of Mr Darwin and remarks that the difference was most striking It is moreover remarkable that in many cases plants are themselves more fertile if supplied with pollen from a different flower a different variety or even as it would appear in some instances in the passion flower for example from a different species Nay in some cases pollen has no effect whatever unless transferred to a different flower Fritz Midler has recorded some species in which pollen if placed on tlie stigma of the same flower has not only no more effect than so much inorganic dust but which is perhaps even more extraordinary in others he states that the pollen placed on the stigma of its own flower acted on it like a poison This he noticed in several species the flower faded and fell off the pollen grains themselves and the stigma in contact with them shrivelled up turned brown and decayed while other flowers on the LN SECTS OF THE FIELD 201 same branch which were not so treated retained their fresh ness Now as we have said the great agencies in nature in performing this act of cross fertilization are llie wind and insects principally the latter The stamens and pistils of the pines birches poplars grasses corn and other cereals are so arranged that the Avind fertilizes them but in a largo nnmber of flowers the stamens are so situated in relation to the pistils that the ovule in the latter can only bo fertilized by the agency of insects For this end the plant must hold out some inducement to the bees and moths in order to attract them something besides bright colors and sweet smells which are known to attract insects Flowers how ever sweetsmelling or beautiful would not be visited by insects unless they had some inducements more substantial to offer These advantages are the pollen and the honey although it has been suggested that some flowers beguile insects hy holding out the expectation of honey which does not really exist just as some animals repel their enemies by rcsemlling other species which are either dangerous or disa greeable That many insects arc attracted b smells wg well know but Lubbock has been the flrst to show that bees and wasps are attracted by and can distinguish colors I placed he says slips of glass Avith honey on paper of various colours accustoming different bees to visit special colours and when they had made a few visits to honey on paper of a particular colour I found that if the papers were transposed the bees followed the colour The bright streaks of different hues which adorn the petals of flowers serve the most utilitarian purpose namely as guiding lines to show the bee the way down to the deposit of honey At figure 151 indicates the bright col ored guiding lines which lead down to the nectary Lub bock remarks that he did not realize the importance of these guiding lines until by experiments on bees he saw how 9 202 mucli time they lose if lioney which is put out for them is moved even slightly from its usual place With good rea son therefore he adopts Sprengels suggestion that the lines and bands by which so many flowers are ornamented have reference to the position of the honey Lubbock observes that these honey guides are absent in night flowers where of course they would not be visible and would therefore be useless as for instance in certain English flowers as Lychnis vespertina or Silene nutans it is a curious fact that the for mer flower is white while Lychnis diurna which flowers by day is red In some cases bees baffled in their attempts to find the honey take a short cut and perforate the corolla with their jaws The first and only instance yet known of this curious Fig 151 Geiardia perforated bj bees trait in this country is that given by Mr W W Bailey in the American Naturalist 1873 He noticed that the flowers of Gerardla edicularia were perforated by the bees at the point indicated by p in figure 151 also seen at a where the corolla is split open Mr Bailey writes I have seen bees approach the front for a moment and then retire 10 INSECTS OF THE FIELD 203 as if bafilod Most of them however begin operations at the back at once The alight with the tail towards the open end of the flower and at once insert the head into tlie little hole I have never seen them make the apertnre although it is difficult to find a blossom without one Even the buds are often penetrated out of a large number of flowers plucked at random from different plants in different localities I can not find one flower without the slit The bees alluded to were humble bees In Europe they are known to perforate the flowers of the bean and similar plants Lubbock in concluding a chapter on the importance of insects to flowers says that to insects flowers are indebted for their scent and colour nay for their very existence in their present form Not only have the present shape and outlines the brilliant colours the sweet scent and the honey of flowers been gradually developed through the unconscious selection exercised by insects but the very arrangement of the colours the circular bands and radiating lines the form size and position of the petals the relative situations of the stamens and pistil are all arranged with reference to the visits of insects and in such a manner as to insure the grand object whfch these visits are destined to effect It will be seen from these facts and suggestions that the distribution of insects depends largely on that of plants A field of clover will attract humble bees for miles around the night flying moths are attracted long distances to those flowers which are open at dusk at night or in the early morn ing such as the honeysuckles pinks scarlet runners petu nias and other tubular flowers Indeed Lubbock remarks in this connection that flowers which are fertilized by night flying insects would derive no advantage from being open by day and on the other hand that those which arc fertilized by bees would gain nothing by being open at night Nay it would be a distinct disadvantage because it would render them liable to be robbed of their honey and pollen by in 11 204 HALP HOURS WITH INSECTS sects which are not capable of fertilizing them I would venture to suggest then that the closing of flowers may have reference to the habits of insects and it may be ob served also in support of this that windfertilized flowers do not sleep and that some of those flowers which attract insects bj smell emit their scent at particular hours thus Hesperis matronalis and Lychnis vespertina smell in tlie evening and Orchis hifolia is particularly sweet at night The tongue of the hawk moth is often of great length adapting it for probing the deep corollas of various orchids etc For example the tongue of the moth of the tobacco worm Fig 152 a caterpillar 6 chrjsalis with its large tongue case reaching to the middle of the body is very long but still moderate in its proportions compared to that of a Madagascar species in which it attains a length of nine and a quarter inches and as there are said to be orchids with flowers as deep as this there is evidently a relation of cause and effect between the two facts Some moths such as the silk worm moths have the tongue undeveloped and they are not known to visit flowers Other modifications in the palpi and legs of insects are correlated with the different methods insects take to collect and bear away pollen and honey It is a significant fact which has been alluded to by authors that in the arctic regions many flowers are wanting which elsewhere are fertilized by insects also absent from circumpolar lands If plants were introduced they would become extinct possibly not on account of the severity of the climate but because there would be no insects to render the flowers fertile and capable of producing seeds The advent of mauy if not nearly all the flowering plants in past geological periods undoubtedly went hand in hand with the appearance of insects Now the bees and moths and butterflies particularly the bees are among the most highl developed of insects and were the last to appear in the later geological periods What a striking exemplification of the 12 IXSECTS OF THE FIELD 205 Fig Ir2 The Tolacco Worm Cliiysalis and ftfoth 13 206 HALF HOUKS WITH INSECTS harmonies of nature this coeval birth of flowers and insects each modifying the other new forms of animals giving rise to new floral creations But in this utilitarian age and country it will not do to speak of field insects without mentioning those which ravage our field crops as well as those which aid introducing them Perhaps no insect in this country except the cotton worm has carried more consternation among farmers than the plumpbodied phlegmatic welltodo looking beetle which from living a quiet harmless life on the wild useless species of Solanum in the valleys at the base of the Rocky Moun tains has suddenly invaded our potato fields and robbed our farmers of hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of this important crop Not a European importation this insect has made its home in a region of our country differing far more in its ph3sical and climatic features from its native territory than does Europe from the northeastern states It is an example to use the language of the botanists of a prepotent insect which lilce a weed when introduced into a new country increases far more rapidly than at home and crowds out the native insects asserting itself everywhere in our farms and highways and byways Mr B D Walsh late state entomologist of Illinois has given us an interesting history in the Practical Entomol ogist of the first appearance of this insect He shows that the original home of this beetle was in the valleys of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado Territory where for nearly fifty years it has been known to feed upon a wild spe cies of potato Solanum rostratum When these vallejs became settled and the potato planted there this beetle adopted it as its food and then began a new chapter in its history It should be remembered that the potato is also a species of Solanum and the change in the nature of the beetles food not great By 1859 it had spread eastward to within a hundred miles of Omaha Nebraska In 1861 it 14 IJSrSEOTS OF THE FIELD 207 passed into Iowa and in 18G4 and 1865 it crossed tlie Mis sissippi a thing whicli never ought to have been allowed It invaded Illinois on its western border crossing over from northeastern Missouri and Iowa Mr Walsh predicted that it would advance eastward at the rate of fifty miles a year In 1868 it appeared in Ohio Mr Riley states that its aver age annual progress towards the east has been upwards of seventy miles At the same rate of progression it Avill touch the Atlantic Ocean in about ten years from now or AD 1878 But in fact it has travelled faster than that and the year 1876 will witness the arrival of this pilgrim from the west in the potato patches of the descendants of the Pilgrim Fathers This beetle belongs to the family of leafeating Coleoptera or Chrysomelidse of which the common striped squash Fig 153 Fig 154 Doryphora juncta D 10lincata beetle is a familiar example It lays its eggs on the leaves of the plant it inhabits in the larva or

habits In the latitude of St Louis there are three broods during the 3ear the last brood wintering over in the beetle state under ground They are usually dug up in the spring of the 3ear in land that had been planted to potatoes the jear before The beetles issue of their own accord from the ground about the first of Ma and the last brood of beetles enters the ground to hibernate during the month of October Though in general terms this beetle may be said to be threebrooded yet it may be found at almost any time of the year in all its different stages This is owing to the fact that the female continues o deposit her eggs in patches from time to time covering a period of about forty das and also from the fact that among those laivae which all batch out in one day some will develop and become beetles a week and even ten dajs earlier than others Thus it ma be that some of the late individuals of the third brood pass the winter in the pupa state though the normal habit is to first transform to beetles Each female is capable of depos iting upwards of a thousand eggs before she becomes barren and in from thirty to forty da3s from the time they were deposited they will have produced perfect beetles These beetles are again capable of depositing eggs in about two weeks after issuing from the ground and thus in about fifty days after the egg is laid the offspring begins to propagate This insect should not be confounded with a closely allied species D juncta Fig loo which feeds upon the horse nettle Solanum CaroUnense a wild plant common in the southern and western

lajs from twenty to thirty eggs in a crease in tlie leaf of the young plant Four days after if the weather be favor able the young pale red maggots may be seen crawling down the leaf until arriving at a joint in the stalk of the plant they remain head downwards as at figure 167 c Fig 107 Hessian FI7 and young under the base of the leaf where by the simple pressure of their bodies they become embedded in the side of the stem Two or three maggots thus embedded are sufficient to cause the plant to Avither and die In five or six weeks they ma ture and by the first of December their skin hardens and becomes of a chestnutlrown color This is the socalled flaxseed state The outer larval skin encases the larva or maggot whose body is contracted and somewhat changed in form In this state it remains through the winter Towards the end of April or early in May the pupa becomes perfected and by the middle of May in New England escapes from the  pupacase in which it has been wrapped like a mummy This occurs just as the wheat is coming up For a period extending over three weeks they lay their eggs and then disappear The maggots hatched by the eggs laid by the spring brood assume the flaxseed form in June and July and are found unchanged in the autumn most of them re maining in the stubble This is a most important fact of which the farmer may take advantage Now if the stubble be

stayed As it is now we are almost wholly Fig 168 Parasite of Hessian Fly dependent on natures means of preventing their too great increase Figure 168 shows much enlarged a parasitic fourwinged Chalcid fly which has the instinct to thrust its ovipositor through the sheath of the leaf under which the maggot of the Hessian fly lurks and deposit an egg in its body Dr Fitch has suggested that the European parasite of this and the wheat midge should be imported and bred by the quantity so as to stop their ravages It would be a simple thing to do A quantity of stubble from an English or French wheat field could be imported and scattered over the wheat fields of southern New England and the Middle 22 ESrSECTS OF THE FIELD 215 States and in this way the parasites with but slight expense be had by the quantity Why have not commissioners before this been appointed by the several state authorities to attend to this important matter While the Hessian fly attacks the root the wheat midge adopts the ear as its point of attack When the wheat is in blossom the females lay their eggs in the evening in clusters of from two to twenty by means of the long retractile tubelike extremity of the body within the chaffy scales of the flowers The orangecolored maggots appear in from eight to ten days after and when fully grown are oneeighth of an inch long They crowd around the germ of the wheat Fig 169 Parasite of the Wheat Midge which by pressure becomes shrivelled and aborted About the first of August it casts the skin either while in the ear or after it has descended to the ground After descending to the earth it spins an earthen cocoon smaller than a mustard seed and remains through the winter about an inch under ground The midge appears the next June and July Figure 169 represents its most deadly parasite In dealing with this midge it is obvious that if the wheat field is ploughed after the stubble is burnt off either in the autumn or spring great numbers will be cut off for when buried five or six inches the fly is unable to reach the surface of the ground Another method is to sow grain late in the season 23 216 HALF HOURS WITH INSECTS for example in New England after the 15th or 20th of May By early sowing the 3oung wheat will have got the start of the flies and too large and strong for them to kill it For a third and often still more destructive insect which sometimes succeeds in cutting off a half and sometimes nearly the whole of a crop of wheat oats or barley we must turn to the very family of parasitic chalcid flies which are as a rule beneficial to agriculture A few of them make galls in the stems of plants and the maggots instead of feeding on the juices of living insects which serve as their hosts prey on the juices of plants Such is the famous joint worm or Eurytoma hordei This is a native insect It is a little shining black fourwinged fl a little over a line in length with the knees and feet pale yellow The hind body is attached by a slender pedicel to the thoiax and the male antennae are provided with tufts or verticils of fine hairs When the wheat or barley is about eight or ten inches high their growth is often checked the leaves turn jellow and irregular galllike swellings arise between the second and third joints of the stalk or in the joint itself In November in New England the worms transform into the pupa state living through the winter unchanged in the straw or remaining in the stubble in the field In Virginia where the joint worm has been fearfully destructive the maggot does not transform until late in February or early in March From early in May until the first week in July the flies issue from the galls in the dry stubble and are sup posed to immediately lay their eggs in the stalks of the young wheat or barley plants From a knowledge of the habits of this insect it is evident that the prudent farmer by cooperating with his neighbors can successfully cope with this insect if he and they are careful to burn the stubble in the autumn and spring and carry on the process for several successive years over a large 24 INSECTS OF THE FIELD 217 tract of countr Ploughing in the stubble in this case does not injure the insects as with their hard bodies they can work their way out of the earth The joint worm has several parasites members of its own family and it must be a pleasant sight to the agriculturist however it may strike the moralist to see the members of this large family falling upon and destroying one another and in such an atrocious way too Indeed our sole dependence for protec tion against noxious insects is the literally intestinal wars by which their numbers are kept down to a moderate figure The Army worm of the north is essentially a field insect It is not usually a common object but at long intervals it swarms in immense numbers cutting off acres of wheat barley oats and grass This worm is the caterpillar of the Leucania unipuncta one of the family of nightflying moths represented by the cut worms Agrotis see Figs 9 10 11 and Cucullia etc The present moth is rusty grayish ochre ous brown with the wings free from the usual markings and only a few dark dots forming a row parallel to the outer edge of the wing with a single white dot near the centre of the wing She probably lays her eggs near the roots of grasses such as the timothy and red top about the middle of June In the Middle and Western States the eggs arc probably laid in April and May and the moths lay their eggs for a second brood in June and Jul while in New England the moth appears in October and probably then lays eggs which do not hatch till the spring The caterpillars on hatching feed for alout four weeks until nearly fully fed when they stray oif to seek fresh pas tures Usually their numbers are inconsiderable but several times during the last and the present century they have ap peared in immense armies In New York and Now England they have occurred in great numbers in 1743 1770 1790 and 1817 In southern Illinois they abounded in 1818 or 1820 In 1842 they were very destructive In 1856 they 25 218 HALF HOUES WITH HNSECTS appeared in such numbers as to attract general attention but in 1861 the year in which the writer first made their acquaintance they were a grievous plague A writer in Danvers Mass says They were seen in great numbers through the entire field of several acres climbing up the stalks of the barley eating the blades and cutting off the heads of the grain The day after these worms were discovered the barley was mowed in order to preserve it when they dropped to the ground throwing themselves into a coil a habit of the insect when disturbed Many of them soon commenced a march for the neighboring fields and gardens while others blindly pushed forward a column across the highways over a stone wall where they were crushed by travellers on the road But the main body marched to the adjoining gardens and enclosures where the proprietors were waiting to receive them in their entrench ments which had been thrown up a foot wide and two feet deep The worms as they fell in their advance into the trenches were assailed in various ways by eager combatants some spreading over them lime tar or ashes while others resorted vigorously to pounding them In this way count less numbers of them were destroyed The rear guard composed principally of those of smaller growth kept in the field where they were picked up by a troop of fifty young redwinged blackbirds I also noticed the robins feeding on these vermin Again In adjoining lots they were commencing their devastation upon the corn turnips cab bages weeds and grass They leave the grass ground com pletely clean and white so that it has the appearance of having been scorched in the sun The cabbage and turnips they destroy by eating the tender parts of the plants while they attack the corn by descending the spindle and conceal ing themselves in large numbers among the leaves where the corn is to make its appearance Corn thus attacked looks wilted and drooping In some hills the stalks were stripped 26 Packabd insects of the FIELD 219 of all their leaves There were no worms upon the potato tops though they have killed all the grass to the borders of the field The name Army worm is suggestive of the regular trained way in which myriads of these caterpillars march together in long deep columns side by side steadily over every obstacle wherever their food or instinct may lead them Unlike the cut worms which move by night singly from field to field and secrete themselves by daytime at the roots of the plants they attack the Army worm feeds in the forenoon as well as the evening They may be seen scat tered over fields of grain or grass either devouring the leaves or cutting off the heads and letting them fall on the ground They will thus eat theirway across a field wan tonly mowing off the heads of the grain In this way in Plymouth county Mass they destroyed an acre and a half of wheat in one night and then attacked a corn field in the same ruthless manner This caterpillar appears first in July in Massachusetts and a month later in Maine where we saw it at Bangor and northward between the first and middle of August It is about an inch and a half long like the cut worm in shape It is dark with a light interrupted threadlike line along the middle of the back on the sides a light line edged with two threadlike lines and a light colored waved line just above the legs About the middle of August it descends into the earth and there constructs a rough earthen cocoon or contents itself with making a rude cell of dry grass just below the surface in a day or two after assuming the chrysalis state Lying here for ten days or a fortnight the moth flies about at the end of August In dealing with this insect the best remedy is of a pre ventive nature If the grass lands and wheat fields are buint over in autumn multitudes of the moths or chrysal 27 220 I ides will be destroyed The natural enemies are birds and ground beetles which collect about the rear and van of the moving army Six species of ichneumon flies prey upon them among which is a kind of Ophiou Fig 170 These parasites either attach an egg to the outside of the body of the caterpillar or insert it beneath the skin Mr Walsh who discovered most of these parasites also found that a Tachina fly an insect somewhat like the ordinary house fly was in Illinois so destructive that out of nearly sixty worms all but two had the eggs of these flies stuck in groups of Fig 170 Parasite of the Army Worm from one to six on the upper side of the body From these caterpillars he bred fiftyfour Tachinas and only two moths Such is the effective warfare waged upon one insect by an other In this way the balance of nature is preserved As to their mode of attack he states that Jefferson Russell an intelligent farmer had repeatedly on damp cloudy morn nings watched a large bluish green fly about the size of a blowfly attacking the army worm and depositing its eggs on the shoulders of the victim as he ascertained by a 28 DiSECTS OF THE FIELD 221 double lens As they were attacked the army worms kept dropping to the ground and gathering in clusters or hiding under clods until finally the wheat on which they occurred was entirely free from them The Army worm of the south or cotton worm is quite a different sort of caterpillar from its northern namesake It loops in its gait and may thus be distinguished from the boll worm also found upon the cotton Its body Fig 171 moth and larva natural size egg much enlarged is rather thick in the middle tapering towaixls both ends and it is green covered with short hairs and dotted with black along a yellowish line situated on each side of the back and with black dots beneath The moth fig ni is reddish brown the wings quite free from the markings usual in the group to which it belongs the fore wings are triangular with two indistinct dark zig zag lines with a conspicuous dark spot near the centre of the wing in the middle of which are two white dots She lays from four to six hundred low flattened greenish eggs ornamented with vertical ribs placing them upon the under side of the leaf In from two to ten days the young worms hatch and begin to feed on the pulpy portion of the leaf but as they grow larger they devour the entire leaf as well as the buds and blossoms During their life as cater pillars which only lasts from fifteen to twenty days they cast tlieir skins five times As regards the habits of the cotton worm I cannot do better than to quote from Mr Rileys second Report on the Noxious Insects of Missouri in which he says that there are three different broods of worms during the year the first appearing in June or July and the last which does the most damage appearing in 29 Cotton Worm egg and moth 222 August or September or even later Mr Lyman in the little work already referred to says That nature has made no provisions by which either the fly the worm the chrysa lis or the eggs can survive the winter or exist for any length of time where the cotton plant is not a perennial But this is surely an error which Mr Lyman would never have made had he possessed a better knowledge of insect life and as Mr Glover found that the chrysalis was killed by the slightest frost the insect evidently winters over in the moth state as do many others belonging to the same tribe Mr W B Seabrook gives strong evidence that this is the case in a Memoir on the Cotton Plant read in 1843 before the State Agricultural Society of South Carolina wherein he says That the Cotton Moth survives the winter is nearly certain An examination of the neighboring woods espe cially after a mild winter has often been successfully made for that purpose And Dr Phares states positively that the moth hibernates in piles of cotton seed under shelter under bark and in crevices of trees in dense forests and other secluded places and that it may often be seen on pleasant days in winter While this worm is young and small it does not seem to attract attention but early in the autumn it suddenly be comes abundant and at certain years extremely destructive One of these visitations which fell under the observation of the eminent botanist Professor J Darby of Auburn Ala bama is thus described in a letter to the writer Saturday September 19th I was in the field examining the forms buds before flowering and the young bolls fruit after the floral organs have fallen off I examined all carefully with no signs of eggs or worms On Sunday I did not see it On Monday I passed it as usual and observed nothing unusual On Tuesday morning I passed it and noticed nothing unusual On Tuesday noon every plant in the field was stripped of all its upper leaves not one remaining as far as could be seen and the plants were covered with mil lions of worms I counted on one plant fortysix worms They commence at the top of the plant eating every leaf When the leaves were gone they attacked the young bolls eating through the perianth and consuming the young cot ton In the course of four days the work was done They did not touch the grape or any other plant in the field so far as I have been able to see Many left the field and thousands were in the road and on the fences but not one in a thousand thus escaped Today September 23d there is scarcely one to be seen Their disappearance is as mys terious as their coming They have left no signs that I can see either on the stalks or in the ground They have ex tended over hundreds of miles and nothing has proved a barrier to them having been as destructive on islands in the river as elsewhere Onethird of the cotton crop has been destroyed Nothing of the kind has occurred in thirty years past to my knowledge After the caterpillar has become fully grown it draws a leaf around it and then changes to a chrysalis It remains in this state for one or two weeks when the moth escapes In dealing with this insect the only practicable way to diminish its powers of doing mischief is for all the cotton planters to combine and employ handpicking looking over the leaves for the eggs when the moths lay them and again picking off the worms when they are detected The use of carbolic acid cresylic soapsuds and other washes have been recommended This insect seems to appear wherever cotton is raised It is very destructive in the West Indies and in South Amer ica and either this or a similar insect occurs in Egypt It is also sometimes found in New York and I have taken several specimens late in the summer on an island in Salem harbor Massachusetts Mr Grote thinks that away from the Gulf States the whole brood dies every year and that 31 224 the caterpillars of the next summer come from eggs laid by moths which have flown north from the Gulf States This is not however in accordance with the habits of moths gen erally and we shall expect to find that the moth winters over in the middle and northern states where it is a straggler as well as in the southern states It will be interesting to know on what plant the caterpillar feeds north of the cotton states The boll worm Fig 172 moth and larva is more like the cut worm in appearance It feeds on the boll of the cotton plant the moth laying her eggs singly up to the num FlG 172 Boll Worm and Larva ber of five hundred on the calyx of the plant The cater pillars appear in three or four days They pierce through the calyx and destroy the flower buds When fully fed it makes an oval cocoon just under the surface of the soil where it iemains in the pupa state three or four weeks There are two broods of this worm in the Middle States « three in Geoigia The last brood issue as moths in Novem ber though unlike the Army worm some remain under ground through the winter Itxsccts nt the Fur est THE insects of the forest comprise a large proportion of the entomological riches of the world Those coun tries which have the most extensive forests have the greatest number and variety of insects The tropics par ticularly Brazil and the East Indies sustain the richest assemblage of insect forms in the world Their number and beauty diminish as we go north or south Luxuriance of forests with great heat and moisture produces the widest diversity of forms and richness of hues A large proportion of the insects sent home by collectors from tropical coun tries are the butterflies and large showy moths with boring beetles the Scarabeids preying on rotten trees timber bee tles of all descriptions and the parasitic or predaceous forms which keep them in check In the tropics when a tree dies it must be removed to make room and supply food for the growth of others A wound made by some accident such as the fall of an adjoining tree tiie browsing of deer or bears the gnawing teeth of mice or rats leaves a scar a weak place which is immediately utilized by some boring insect as a place to deposit its eggs Borers and timber beetles of many different kinds witli varied modes of attack run their galleries under the bark or bore into the sap wood or straight into the heart of the tree Their presence invites a horde of smaller invaders Tlieir parasites seek them and fall upon them until the tree and perhaps its neighbors are thoroughly worm eaten

the trees Nature lavish of her ornaments in the tropics hangs her stateliest trees with climbing vines creepers and strange bizarre orchids which attract multitudes of hawk moths and butterflies whose gay colors light up the sombre glades of the primitive forests Thus the forests are populated with hundreds of tliousands of insect forms So luxuriant and rapid is the growth of foresta in the trop ics that they apparently are in the aggregate little affected by the ravages of insects The latter on the whole rather serve to prune and check the growth of portions of the tree to weed out the weaker imperfect individuals and aid in the development of the stronger and when a tree shows signs of decay to at once raze it to the ground and convert it into the soil from which it sprang Not so in the temperate regions of the earth where man in subduing the forest exceeds his commission and well nigh exterminates it leaving but scattered patches of the original forest primeval In travelling through the pine forests of northern Maine where the lumberers have made great gaps in the ranks of sturdy trees which formerly crowded the banks of tlie Kennebec Penobscot Alleguash and St John one may walk through the woods for miles and be struck with the poverty of insect life Let him in a warm July or August day come out into a clearing where the lumberers camp or lonely farm house is shaded

Buprestis the pine weevils the russet geometrid moth and others If the destruction of forests goes on as rapidly as at pres ent all these forest insects will soon have lost their occupa tion We shall then have to plant new forests as they have and are doing in portions of northern Italy in Austria Ger many and Great Britain When this is done and the young trees are growing in extensive plantations the danger aris ing from the ravages of destructive insects will be very great As in Europe we shall have to make chairs of for estry in our agricultural colleges and appoint commissioners of forests Then if not at the present daj a thorough and practical knowledge of forest insects will be one of the guarantees to success in the cultivation of trees At pres ent Germany leads the civilized world in the intelligent care of her replanted forests How carefully the trees are nur tured how intelligently their diseases are studied and with what pains the habits and forms of the destructive insects are described and drawn is well known The elaborate and beautifully illustrated works of the late Dr Ratzeburg have made his name famous and they form a perpetual witness to the intelligence and forethought of the people who encourage by their patronage the publication of such expensive and 228 richly illustrated works Such a work as that of Ratzeburg entitled Animals Injuring Forests has a double value Not only is it of high practical importance but the minute information therein contained regarding the habits of the destructive insects and their many parasites the relation of the trees themselves to the animal world the peculiar diseases resulting from their attacks the deformities and changes wrought not only in single trees but extended through laigo tracts of forest all bear on theoretical points in biology such as the supposed struggle for existence in organized beings the origin of sports strains races varie ties and species which combine to lend the highest interest to such stores of facts as are to be found in the works of this learned German Let us now walk through the pine woods and notice the work of some of the more remarkable insects I could take the reader by a favorite walk in the pine woods of Maine and show him among a splendid growth of tall straight white pines one enormous tree whose girth twenty feet from the ground is between fifteen and twenty feet Above that the trunk divides into four branches curved outwards at their base forming a double crotch In another walk I could show him several large trees all within a few rods of each other variously gnarled and distorted either with single curved trunks or double or tripleheaded monsters specimens of vegetable monstrosities which would delight a Geoffrey St Hilaire or Dareste What is the origin of this deformation It is a common little weevil which has the habit of laying its eggs late in the spring in the terminal shoots of white pine bushes Sev eral grubs hatch out and burrow in various directions under the bark As they grow apace they sink into the wood as far as the pith and by the end of the second summer according to Professor Peck as quoted by Harris they have each made a little cell in the wood cleverl lined with pine 4 INSECTS OF THE FOREST 229 chips in which the grub changes into a chrysalis It is easy to find a stem of the pine containing a dozen or more of these cells situated at quite regular intervals under the bark now loosened or peeling off If we examine it in the autumn we shall find the grubs their pupa3 or chrysalides together with the beetles The accompanying excellent figures 174 of the pine weevil its young and chrysalis or pupa the two latter magnified three times will give an ex cellent idea of the different stages of growth of this weevil The footless grub is white with a honeyyellow head The white pupa has a mummified look with its eyes partially concealed by its wings and its legs folded on its breast In this attitude it lies in its cell or sarcophagus awaiting the Fig 174 Piuc Weevil a grub b pupa dawn of a new life in the outer world It either presses out from under the bark and seeks some other hiding place or lies in its cell until some warm day in April when with a troop of its fellows it flies about in the sunshine busied with the care of providing for the continuance of its race Now this work of tunnelling and mining causes the death of the terminal shoot of the young tree The bush sends out lateral shoots more or less ciooked One can see plenty of them in the course of any walk in the edges of the woods Thus deprived of flieir leading shoot such dwarfed and gnarled bushes grow up and vastly injure the appearance of the forest and its value as lumber Dr Fitch says that young thriftygrowing pines are its favorite resort and among these it selects those that are most vigorous and whose topmost shoot has made the great est advance the preceding year But I have seen it so nu merous that not only the topmost shoots of every tree in the grove but many of the lateral ones also were invaded and destroyed by it The tree that is attacked con tinues its growth upward during the fore part of the season as usual sending out from the summit of the shoot that is infested a leading shoot with a number of lateral branches around its base But the growth of these new succulent twigs is arrested and they begin to wilt and wither about the middle of July the worms having by this time become so large and mined and wounded the stalk below to such an extent that its juices are exhausted and it fails to transmit any nourishment to these tender green shoots at the summit which consequently dry up and perish Here again the forester is aided by his best ftiends the birds which pick out the grubs and eat them There are also several parasitic insects which further reduce their ranks Another pine weevil equally abundant and often as de structive is the Hylobius It is a larger beetle and darker less reddish than the white pine weevil Pissodes strobi It is particularly destructive to the pitch pine so much so in the southein states that Wilson the ornithologist thus speaks of its depredations near Charleston South Carolina as quoted by Harris Would it be believed that the larvifi of an insect or no larger than a grain of rice should silently and in one season destroy some thousand acres of pinetrees many of them from two to three feet in diameter and a hundred and fifty feet high Yet whoever passes along the high road from Georgetown to Charleston in South Carolina about twenty miles from the former place can have striking and melancholy proofs of the fact In 6 INSECTS OF THE FOEEST 231 some places the whole wootls as far as 3011 can see around you are dead stripped of the bark

remedy can be devised against these insects and their larvaB I would humbly suggest the propriety of protecting and receiving with proper feelings of gratitude the services of this and the whole tribe of woodpeckers letting the odium of guilt fall to its proper owners Not remotely allied to the weevils which are distinguished by their more than Roman noses are the little snubnosed cylindrical timber beetles Their hard bodies short legs and strong jaws admirably adapt them for boring in the bark and solid wood of trees They are some Fig 15 times called woodengravers They may well be styled animated gimlets as they bore straight even and true holes as if driven by the hand of a carpenter There are several species which have different modes of assault Tlie first is the Tomicus xylo graphus Fig 175 the true wood engraver It is quite small chestnutcolored about a line in length its wingcovers are bevelled off at the tip the edges of the declivity being armed with four or five teeth on each side The female mines the outer surface of the sap wood and inner layer of the bark lengthwise to the tree Curi ously enough there are more males than females and they help their partners each working in turn This is one of the few cases among insects in which the two sexes unite in the work of providing for the welfare of their future offspring The female is said by Dr Fitch from whose admirable observations I am compiling this account to make little notches at intervals along the burrow In each of these notches from one to four eggs are placed As the beetles 7 232 HALP HOURS WITH INSECTS clothed with the short stiff hairs which cover their bodies pass backwards and forwards in their burrow they brush the dust and chips into the notches thus covering the eggs up When they hatch the young grubs gnaw their way straight out for two or three inches from the primary tunnel which may be from four to eight inches in length It has been noticed that the burrows are alwa3s separate never touching or crossing each other When about to pupate i e change to a pupa the grub sinks deep into the wood at the outer end of the burrow This species attacks the pine wdien in perfect health Another wood engraver nearly two lines in length is the Tomicus cdlligraphus It makes short large irregular bur rows and is common in the yellow pines of the Carolinas as well as the pitch pine of the northern states The burrow of the Tomicus pini is like a birds claw or the fingers of a hand As the beetle is a line and a half in PiQ 170 length its burrows are rather II I I f I I f I Iisfi than usual i i The smallest form known is Tunnel of Timber Beetle TomicuS pusillus slightly more than half a line in length It mines extremely fine slender wavy passages in every di rection mostly in the wood The eggs are laid so that the 3oung grubs mine outwards travelling awaj from each other In the bark beetles there are several males to one female at work in a mine We now come to the true timber beetles which sink their tunnels deep into the wood Here the fe males are most numerous and are probably not aided in their work by the males The Tomicus materarius is aline and a half long and red dish3ellow in color It makes a straight burrow with regu lar secondary tunnels running out at right angles to the main one somewhat as in Fig 176 Its presence may be known by the clean white piles of borings it throws out of its hole Tackard INSECTS or TIIE FOREST 233 Fig 177 Fig 178 Wine cask borer enlarged Chrysobothris larva Fig 179 Avery slender form is the wine cask borer Fig 177 which

attacked by multitudes of the young of carnivorous beetles such as Staphylinus and Hister and their allies Often in walking through the woods ones attention is attracted by large flakes of bark peeling off the trunks of pines They are loosened by the gnawing teeth of grubs such as are figured here Fig 178 a Chrysobothris larva and 179 9 A giant borer natural size the larva of Euchroma columbica from Central America It Avill be noticed that the body is broad and flattened just behind the hard horny head while behind the en largement the body becomes narrow and cylindrical It thus bores broad shallow grooves between the bark and the solid wood consuming the sap wood the vital part of the tree Our largest and most abundant borer of this group is the Chalcophora Virginiensis It is an inch or more in length the body rough and hard and dark steel brown with a brassy or coppery hue It may be observed flying about on hot days in May and June or sunning itself on the trunks of pine trees The grub forms a long shallow groove more or less ser pentine in its course As the young borer grows its track increases in width which is stufled with chips finely packed behind it Finally when fully grown and ready to transform it bores a large oval hole deep in the wood where the insect reposes during its pupal sleep The insect lives one year as a larva Another species C liberta is rather smaller but very similar to the Virginian Chalcopliora and when at rest resembles the young fruit cones The beetle itself eats the 3oung buds of the pine Pine saplings are much injured by the larval Chrysobothris which girdles the trunks and branches When passing in our strolls among the pines some vet eran tree whose days of usefulness have departed and which already show signs of deca our ears are often saluted with a harsh creaking noise issuing from the tree The strain is intermittent and sometimes several voices join in a chorus of harsh crepitant sounds It is difficult at first to fix upon the exact site of the choristers but on pulling off a piece of the bark out tumble two or three large shining white worms which tell the story They are the young of the common 10 INSECTS OF THE FOREST 235 pine borer Monoliammus notatus whose creaking noise we often notice in passing by piles of white pine wood and sometimes hear issuing from some chair or table or chest of drawers in Avhich it has remained while they are passing through the saw mill and carpenters shop on their way to the chamber or kitchen Its mysterious creaking noise nat urally occasions a good deal of speculation as to its source One sometimes finds the beetle in sawn and planed lumber lying in its cell or it may issue from the leg of a table or bureau drawer with its long legs and horns like a ghost from another world when its advent causes nearly as much of a flutter in the heart of the housekeeper as would the ap pearance of a veritable spirit I have found these larvae in July in abundance when they were a little over an inch long and had apparently com pleted their first year I was unable to find any beetles or ehrsalides and am disposed to think that they produced the noise by rubbing their hard smooth horny heads or jaws against the sides of their burrow Dr Fitch however states that the beetle itself makes the noise and it is evi dent that both larva and beetle produce a similar sound I will quote his statement entire On a still summers night the peculiar grating or crunching noise which the larvoe make in gnawing the wood may be distinctly heard at a distance of eight or ten rods That the insect does not open a passage out of the wood whereby to make its exit until it attains its perfect state I infer from tlie fact that several of these leetles gnawed their way out of one of the pillars of the portico of a newly built house in my neighbor hood some years since the noise being heard several days before they emerged and whilst tliey were still at some dis tance in the interior of the wood The grub is nearly cylindrical white and soft with nu merous fine reddish hairs The second segment of the body is flattened and larger than the others the succeeding rings 11 236 HALF HOUBS WITH INSECTS are very short with a transverse oval rough space in the middle of the upper and under side of the body Its burrow is large and winds around under the bark finally sinking into the wood where the grub undergoes its transformations into a beetle which has remarkably long feelers and is of a granite gray color By its habit of tun nelling logs it is an annoying insect to lumberers who remove the bark from the logs in order to free the wood from its attacks Similar to this beetle with antennae twice as long as its body is a beautiful olive green species with a white spot on Fig 180 Orthosoma grub with heid and thoracic Iings enlarged the scutel at the base of the wingcovers It ma be seen flying about white pine bushes in June when it lays its eggs It is

whose grub may often 12 rSECTS or the forest 237 be found in rotten pine stumps The beetle itself occasion ally enters our houses at night Pine stumps are excellent breeding places for this and the borer of the large black Prionns beetle Fig 181 beetle and pupa which occasion ally leaves its native pine and cuts down our young plums pear trees and grape vines As an example how forest insects may by their widespread ravages change the entire appearance of a landscape I may cite the case of the injury committed one season in a growth of young pine saplings or rather bushes about six Fig 181 Prionus and pupa feet high For several square miles their tops had turned yellow as if they were dying at the roots But near the tops were exudations of pitch forming large masses On cutting these off a little caterpillar was found in a hole be neath the pitch and this was without much doubt the secret of the mischief It seemed at the time impossible for one or two little caterpillars to do such injury to a large and flourishing bush I have not since seen such an unusual fatality in joung pitch pines nor this caterpillar and am now inclined to think that the mischief was produced by the 13 238 little caterpillar the more since similar damage is caused to pine bushes in Europe by a little Tortrix with similar habits A not uncommon sight in isolated pine trees is a nest of sawfly caterpillars whose sawdustlike castings form a large mass collected among the leaves These false caterpillars as they are called are social and live huddled up together on the end of a pine branch Small trees are often ruined by them It always seems as if artificially planted forests suflTer the most from the attacks of injurious insects One of these saw flies before unknown to science has been found ravaging a plantation of young pitch pines on Cape Cod By means of the sawlike ovipositor these curious flies are able to cut slits in the leaves and stems of plants The present species Lophyrus pinirigidi thus slits and inserts an Qgg in each side of the needle of the pine The males are easily distin guished from all otlier sawflies by the beautifully pectinated antennae and shining black bodies We could go on describing the insects injurious to our pine trees but the enumeration would be tedious to the reader About a hundred different species are known to prey on our native pines and a number of them attack the imported ornamental pines and flrs of our lawns They attack the roots the trunk the leaves and the seed in the cones M Perris a French naturalist has written an ex tensive work on the insects of the maritime pine of France describing with care a hundred species found on that tree alone and not only the destructive kinds but all the nu merous parasitic and carnivorous forms which take up their abode beneath the bark of the tree and wage a ceaseless warfare against the primitive occupants If au one would like to look behind the scenes and witness the struggle for existence going on under the bark of a pine tree let him go to the woods for himself and study the various insects in 14 ESTSECTS OF THE EOREST 239 eluding many spiders mites and thousandlegs which con gregate in these retreats Now turning our steps towards tlie hard wood growths we shall find that the oak harbors a great number of insect inhabitants We could enumerate from thirty to forty dif ferent kinds injurious to the oak in tlie northern states The walnut is infested by a still larger number fully seventy species The elm struggles against the attacks of about twentyfive diflTerent kinds while the locust and maple have a less number of species specially injurious The oak suffers from the attacks of numerous gallflies which not content with deforming the branches and leaves With unsightly tumois sting even the roots producing excres cences like ground nuts on the smaller rootlets These little root gallflies are wingless and look lilie little black ants They are strange to sa found only early in winter on the snow They are rare and more curious than destructive If one will examine a pile of freshly cut red oak wood he will find the sticks of cord wood pretty thoroughlj riddled with large holes and tunnels nearly half an inch in diame ter This is the work of a large fleshy caterpillar the young of the Cossus It is the most destructive of all the insects feeding upon the oak as after the worm is hatclied and there are a good many of thom since tlie female lays about three hundred eggs they bore directly into the heart of the tree leaving a passage for the rain and moisture which aid iu the work of destruction The caterpillar is thought to be three years in attaining its full size its life being an unusually long one as few caterpillars are known to live longer than one season It also infests the locust tree If a favorite shade tree has been attacked the best way to prevent farther mischief is to soap the trunk in June and July and thus prevent the moth from depositing its eggs or after the holes appear to plug them up in order to keep the water out 15 240 HALF HOURS WITH LNSECTS Another borer is the Brenthian weevil Eupsalis miniita Fig 182 By means of its long snout armed with short stout jaws at the end it bores a hole through the bark in serts an egg and the grub hatching out bores into the solid wood finally making a burrow about a tenth of an inch in diameter Mr Riley has described and figured in his Sixth Report on the Noxious Insects of Missouri the transformations of this interesting beetle He draws attention to the combative nature of the males in the following words The males of the Brenthians are known to fight desperately for the female and as it has been remarked by Mr A R Wallace it is interesting as bearing on the question of sexual selection F G 182 case as in the stag beetles when the males fight together they should not only be better armed but also much larger than the females The eggs are deposited during the months of May and June and perhaps later the female boring a cylindrical hole with her slender snout and therewith pushing her egg to Eupsalis jg bottom of the hole as is the habit of all snout beetles Mr Howard thus describes his own observations on these insects It requires about a day to make a punc ture and deposit the egg During the time the puncture is being made the male stands guard occasionally assisting the female in extracting her beak this he does by stationing himself at a right angle with her body and by pressing his heavy prosternum against the tip of her abdomen her stout forelegs serving as a fulcrum and long body as a lever When the beak is extracted the female uses her antennae for freeing the pinchers or jaws of bits of wood or dust the antennae being fuinished with stitf hairs and forming an excellent brush Should a strange male approach a heavy contest at once ensues and continues until one or the other The Malay Archipelago p 482 is thrown from the tree The successful party then takes his station as guard These contests sometimes last for hours and are always repeated if the pioper male is defeated though not often if he is successful I think it is by mere happen so that the stranger passes by or runs across the busy couple and if successful in routing his rival he takes the same care of the female as did the vanquished indi vidual The habits of these insects are much like those of the Curculio family When disturbed they fold themselves up as well as they can and drop to the ground where they Fig 183 Oak weevil and young feign death They will soon come to and hide beneath pieces of bark stones or other rubbish Curculiolike Another weevil which may be found in all its stages of larva pupa and adult early in May under the bark of decay ing oaks is the fagdalinus olyra Fig 183 a larva pupa enlarged tluee times The most interesting and intelligent of all the borers is the oak Pruner Stenocorus putator Fig 184 a larva b pupa lying in its hole The ectle appears in June and deposits its eggs near the axilla of a leaf stalk or small twig or in the bark of larger branches The grub hatches and sinks into the centre of the twig Now comes the strange part of its history in which this grub evinces a most unusual trait in these boring insects When lialf grown it nearly cuts the brancli off It then withdrawsPackakd into the hole in the portion of the branch beyond the cut and plugs up the opening behind it before the limb is broken off by some strong wind and falls to the ground But as I am alread indebted to Dr Fitch for most of the facts regarding this intelligent insect I will let him tell them in his own words The worm being about half grown is now ready to cut the limb asunder But this is a most nice and critical oper ation requiring much skill and calculation for the limb Fig 184 h Oak Pruner must not break and fall whilst he is in the act of gnawing it apart or he will be crushed by being at the point where it bends and tears asunder or will fall from the cavity there when it breaks open and separates To avoid such casual ties therefore he must after severing it have time to with draw himself back into his hole in the limb and plug the opening behind him before the limb breaks and falls And this little creature accordingly appears to be so much of a philosopher as to understand the force of the winds and their action upon the limbs of the tree so that he can bring them into his service He accordingly severs the limb so far that it will remain in its position until a strong gust of wind strikes it whereupon it will break off and fall But the most astonishing part of this feat remains to be 18 ESrSECTS OF TIIE FOREST 243 noticed The limb which he cuts off is sometimes only a foot in length and is consequently quite light sometimes ten feet long loaded with leaves and very heavy A man by carefully inspecting the length of the limb the size of its branches and the amount of foliage growing upon them could judge how far it should be severed to insure its being afterwards broken by the winds But this worm is impris oned in a dark cell only an inch or two long in the interior of the limb How is it possible for this creature therefore to know the length and weight of the limb and how far it should be cut asunder A man moreover on cutting a number of limbs of different lengths so far that they will be broken by the winds will find that he has often miscalcu lated and that several of the limbs do not break off as he designed they should This little Avorm however never makes a mistake of this kind If the limb be short it severs all the woody fibres leaving it hanging only by the outer bark If it be longer a few of the woody fibres on its upper side are left uncut in addition to the bark If it be very long and heavy not more than threefourths of the wood will be severed Having cut the limb asunder so far that he supposes it will break with the next wind which arises the worm with draws himself into his burrow and that he may not be stunned and drop therefrom should the limb strike the earth with violence when it falls he closes the opening behind him by inserting therein a wad formed of elastic fibres of wood He now feeds at his leisure upon the pith of the main limb hereby extending his burrow up this limb six or twelve inches or more until he attains his full growth quietly awaiting the fall of the liml and his descent therein to the ground It is quite probable that he does not always sever the limb sufficiently in the first instance for it to break and fall Having cut it so much as he deems prudent he with draws and commences feeding upon the pith of the limb 19 244 above the place where it is partially severed until a high wind occurs If the limb is not hereby broken as soon as the weather becomes calm he very probably returns and gnaws off an additional portion of the wood repeating this act again and again it may be until a wind comes which accomplishes the desired result And this serves to explain to us why it is that the worm severs the limb at such an early period of his life For the formidable undertaking of cutting asunder such an extent of hard woody substance we should expect he would await till he was almost grown and had attained his full strength and vigor But by entering upon this task when he is but half grown he has ample opportunity to watch the result and to return and perfect the work if he discovers that his first essay fails to accom plish the end he has in view Thus the first part of the life of this worm is passed in a small twig branching off from the main limb This is so slender and delicate that on being mined as it is by the worm and all its green outer end consumed it dies and be comes so decayed and brittle that it is usually broken off when the limb falls whereby it has escaped the notice of writers hitherto The remainder of his larval life is passed in the main limb first cutting off this limb sufficiently for it to break with the force of the winds and then excavating a burrow upwards in the centre of the limb both before and after it has fallen to the ground feeding hereon until he has grown to his full size Fitch adds that not only the limbs but small joung trees at least of the white oak are sometimes felled by these insects in which cases the worm instead of cutting the wood off transversely severs it in a slanting or oblique direction as though it were aAvare the winds would prostrate a perpendicular shoot more readily by its being cut in this manner The larvo3 become fully grown in the autumn and some 20 INSECTS OF THE FOEEST 245 change to pupoe in the autumn while others wait till the fol lowing spring The beetle appears in June Now in the remarkable habits of these insects we find a variation in their mode of working corresponding to some difTerence in the size and nature of the branch in which they live This is something quite different from the blind unva rying instinct usually ascribed by the unthinking to the lower animals The oak pruner selects a fitting place in which to la its eggs and because it does so for generation after generation no one can deny that there was not a time when this habit was in process of formation and gradually established after a course of experiments continued through perhaps many generations Again the borer itself is not entirely the creature of circumstances there is some room left for the exercise of what we may call judgment The incision it makes in the branch varies in depth with the size of the branch and it must exercise a certain be it a mini mum amount of reason to adjust its life vvith the ph3sical forces about it in order that the life of the species may be maintained Doubtless it makes many mistakes many branches falling too soon or not falling at all many deaths occurring from these mistakes Unfavorable seasons calm weather a too dry or too moist atmosphere its parasites all conspire to reduce its numbers and render its struggle for bare existence exceedingly precarious But this is the history of every species of animal The life of each species is a record of mistakes and disease and often death in con sequence of those mistakes And turning to the human species the philosophic historian of his race is forced to confess that it is often by their misfortunes that races as well as individuals of marked individualism have moulded their characters We submit then that these unusual instinctive acts of the oak pruner have been in all probability gradually acquired after many trials mistakes and failures until the peculiar habits distinguishing this species from its allies 21 246 HALF HOUKS WITH INSECTS Fig 185 have become moulded into a comparatively inflexible mode of life when the creature is governed by what commonly goes under the name of instinct a term too frequcntlj used to cover our ignorance and stifle free inquiry into the origin of the different psychological traits of different races of ani mals The leaves of the oak are often ravaged by the young of the sen atorial moth a gayly caparisoned caterpillar with two horns arising directly behind the head It is nearly two inches in length black with four yellow stripes along the back and two on each side It lives in clus ters on the trees some times well nigh

numbers when the can be plucked off and destroyed In the middle states the locust which there tlnivcs better than in the north is often defoli ated by a leafmining eetle a kind of Hispa But the pride

pests than any other deciduous tree some seventy species are already known to draw their supply of food from these noble trees Our black walnut wood comes from the western states particularly Indiana where the tree grows in the greatest perfection It is estimated that within so short a period as ten years from the present date the supply of black walnut lumber will be materially diminished It is even now time to be planting groves of these precious trees in the western states When they are in course of cultiva tion we can in the imagination if a scientist may be allowed to use that potent

earlier The hickory girdler Oncideres cingulatus Fig 194 par tially repeats in its singular habits those of the oak pruner I will not attempt to condense Professor Haldemans account of this insect simply begging to differ from the writers belief that the habit unusual as it is could never have been acquired Until we know more of the habits of these Oncidc res and there are a number of other species of this and closely allied beetles in Central and South America we are hardly in a posi tion to deny but that there may be other spe cies with quite similar habits which in their turn may be related to still other forms which may exhibit traits intermediate between the girdler and the average longicorn beetle It is only by comparing the intellectual acts of a long series of closely allied species that we shall be able to ascertain what is excejtional and pos sibly be able to get a glimpse at the origin of such excep tional habits It is for this reason that the study of the habits of

the fact and the operator is an insect whose instinct was implanted by the Almighty power who created it and under such circumstances that it could never have been acquired as a habit The effect of girdling is unknown to the insect whose life is too short to foresee the necessities of its prog eny during the succeeding season This insect may be seen in Pennsylvania during the two last weeks in August and the first week in September feed ing upon the bark of the tender branches of the young hick ories Both sexes are rather rare particularly the male which is rather smaller than the female

eggs she then proceeds to gnaw a groove of about a tenth of an inch wide and deep around the branch and below the place where the eggs are deposited so that the exterior portion dies and the larva feeds upon the dead wood and food which is essential to many insects although but few have the means of providing it for themselves or their progeny by an instinct so remarkable Where this insect is

into the tree the male for food and the female mostly for the purpose of laying her eggs In thus entering the tree they bore slantingly and upward and do not confine them selves to the trunk but penetrate the small branches and even the twigs The entrance to the twig is usually made at the axil of a bud or leaf and the channel often causes the leaf to wither and drop or the twig to die or break off The female in depositing confines herself to the trunk or larger limbs placing her eggs each side of a vertical cham ber as described by Mr Bryant Here she frequently dies and her remains may be found long after her progeny have commenced working The larvae bore their cylindrical chan nels at first transversely and diverging but afterward lengthwise along the bark always crowding the widening burrows with their powdery excrement which is of the same color as the bark The fullgrown larva is soft 3cllowish and without trace of legs The head is slightly darker with brown jaws and the

the mordant tooth of time Beetles have in fact well earned the right to have engraved on the escutcheon of their order the old saying Scarabceus aquilam qucerit 10 Insects as mimics MAN especially in his savage state is as a rule obliged to vesoit to various subterfuges to provide himself with animal food The hunter tracks his quarry through the woods his dress of hides or his naked skin harmonizing with the dusky hues of the forest his step is wary and light his weapons are noiseless the deer falling dead from his arrow the bird from his blow gun without startling their fellows or he hunts them by traps from behind screens or while hidden by the foliage of trees At times he disguises himself and stalks the deer dressed in the head and skin of one of their ovn kind He mimics their voices calling the moose by means of a birch bark horn and whistling to the woodcock or snipe The civilized sportsman if he would be successful in the chase adapts his hunting suit to the colors of the field or woodland wearing gray or green some color harmonizing with the landscaie through which he ranges Even his pointers or setters are protected by their tanbrown hue lie makes decoy ducks and tolls in a flock of ducks or geese flying overhead or feediug offshore beyond the reach of his gun The fact that birds and quadrupeds are so easily deceived is a good proof that the use of disguises among animals in a state of nature is an actual fact If some birds can be deceived Iy clumsy painted wooden decoys others may mistake a caterpillar for a twig a weevil for a bud or an edible butterfly mimicking one which they gen erally discard as too nauseous to their taste All this mimicry on the part of man is conscious What is often necessary with man is still more essential with animals In the animal world there is an unconscious mim 17 1 258 iciy The manifold disguises are worn unwittingly by the brute the bird or insect or moUusk but there is no less an underlying design in nature and some useful end subserved That everything which exists lias some use in the world may be regarded as an axiom The savage knows that himself and his offspring will starve unless he by strategem and through some disguise can kill his game Unless the insect protects itself from harm b imitating some natural object or other insect whicli enjoys immunity from the enemies pe culiar to the mimic it and its species will die out All the disguises in nature are then for a manifest utilitarian pur pose and we shall see that each species is by some pecu liarity in its form or color or movements at one or another critical period in its life protected and preserved in the struggle for existence It often happens that the weaker species are overlooked by their enemies while on the other hand the predaceous species are as often enabled to approach their prey through the disguise they have assumed But it will be seen that the ultimate fact in this matter of mimicry is as insisted on by Messrs Darwin and Wallace the advantage to the species It will not unlikely occur to the unbiassed reader that the result of this law of mimicry is rather tlie lireservation of forms already established than the origin of new ones I shall assume as true that quadrupeds birds and insects and the lower animals as well are deceived and protected in turn b the disguises thc assume and that the end is a utilitarian one while I disagree with the conclusions of those who believe that species originate from mimicry as suming that if some species owe their preservation to this cause they may have originated from the same natural causes as their unsuccessful fellows whom mimicr or rather the want of it failed to preserve The fossiliferous strata of our globe are filled with the remains of organisms which have perished in unsuccessful attempts to survive in the struggle for life in a vvorlcl existing in a state of constant incquiiihriuni It is the changes in the conditions of life the revolutions in the physical surroundings of organisms which have induced the transformation of one species into another while protective mimicr has often acted as a con servative agency in preserving the species Both sets of causes have then been factors in the origination of animals and plants as we see them and Darwinism is perhaps as essential as Lamarckianism in explaining the present condi tions of life on the globe But to come at once to the subject of protective mimicry we will study in the first place Insects mi7nicking other natural objects The examples under this head illustrate some of those harmonies in nature which the distinguished Bernard de Saint Pierre saw so clearly Tiie adaptive coloration of animals the harmony in tint and form with the trees on which they live or the rocks among or under which they hide the sand over which they run arc a part of the general harmony in nature A desert animal is of a sandy complexion a silkworm moth is brown a grasshopper is duskytfor much the same reason that the grass is green the sky seems blue or the rocks are gray These harmonics in form in color are as striking in the world as a whole as in isolated portions of it or isolated species of the animals or plants growing on its surface These harmo nies extend to other worlds and systems of worlds and are cosmical in their nature So the causes that lead to the origination of life of a new species are perhaps of a piece with tliose resulting in the origin of a planet We must remember that life at first resulted in all probability through the action of cosmical laws Before animals and lants had multiplied to an extent where was the material for the laws of natural selection to act upon There was once a time when some of the mills of the gods failed to run for the reason that there was nothiu to jrrind Tiger Beetle Among the insects adapted by their peculiar style of col oration to live on the sand or soil are the tiger beetles They are most commonly seen running over sands by the river or on the Avarm light colored soil of wood or forest paths The Cicinclela generosa Fig 196 is ornamented more conspicuously than usual with broad light bands and spots It is found on the white sands of Cape Cod and the beaches southward But a more decided case of protective mimicry is the whitebacked tiger beetle Cicindela dormlis Here the wing covers and front of the head cl3pcus are white while the back part of the head and the prothorax are dark so tliat as the beetle lies on the white sand in wait for its prey it would be easily mistaken for a hole or dark spot or pebble On the other hand the bright green six spotted Cicindela C sexguttata is adapted for its life in the grass in which it runs and flies and in its flight would be mistaken by its enemies or victims for a large green fly Miisca vomitoria The beautiful Cicinclela gloriosa of a very deep velvety green color was only taken upon wet mossy stones in the bed of a mountain stream wheie it was with the greatest difficulty detected A large brown species C hems was found chiefly on dead leaves on forest paths and one which was never seen except on the wet mud of salt marshes was of a glossy olive so exactly the color of the mud as only to be distinguished when the sun shone by its shadow Where the sandy beach was coralline and nearly white I found a ery pale Cicindela wherever it was volcanic and black a dark species of the same genus was sure to be met with Wallace The black or reddish ants are protected from observation by their dark colors in climbing the trunks of trees while 4 IACKAitD INSECTS AS MIMICS 261 the smaller lighter species frequent the sandy light paths about our dwellings Within doors the Reduvius Figs 56 57 covers itself with dust a good disguise in approaching its prey and escaping its enemies Ground spiders by their hues simulate the inequalities of the dark soil over which they run The trap door spiders Mygale Fig 62 are col oied like the soil in which they excavate their nests The desert Mantis Erernophila is of a sandy hue and is easily confounded with the sands of the Sahara An example of protective coloration is probably afforded by a moth of the silk worm family Eideucophceus tricolor Fig 197 Avhich inhabits New Mexico Instead of the dark brown hues of its allies it has a faded appearance adapting it for conceal FlG 197 Eulcucoplitcus ment while resting on the dry parched ground It will be interesting to learn whether its exceptional style of color ation adapts it for a life in the deserts of New Mexico Here the change is evidently induced by the dry climate The grasshoppers nearly always harmonize in color with the general hue of the fields in which they abound They are most abundant towards the last of summer when the fields have lost their freshness and the grass has turned brown at this time the russet garb of the Carolinian locust and the redlegged grasshopper admirably conceal them when at rest I have noticed the sulphurwinged grasslK per Arpliid sulphurea flying about dry hillsides and in northern IVIaine the crackling grasshopper Trimerotropis 5 262 Packakd verruculata is especially abundant on burnt lands and ele vated hill tops or in mountain valleys where it harmonizes well with the soil The maritime grasshopper Trimero tropis maritima is lilce the maritime tiger beetle specially adapted for concealment pn thio sea shore as observed by Mr Scudder who says it so closely resembles the color of the sand on a sea beach that it is difficult to see it when alighted It differs remarkably from its inland allies by the white or pale bands and spots How protective mimicry may affect the different species of a genus is shown in the common redlegged grasshoppers The spretus of the west and the femurrubriwi of the east harmonize in color with the brown hues of the grass lands in August and September but the large twobanded one Caloptenus bivittatus so abundant during the same months in our gardens in its green coat with yellow stripes agrees with the green and 5ellow tints of our garden vegetables among the leaves of which it lives From its comparatively sedentary habits it grows larger and much more clumsy than its lean and agile congeners There are numberless little froth or spittle insects such as the green Helochara communis and the russet Ptyelus Uneatris our commonest spittle insect which pass their youth in concealment in masses of froth on the stems of grass in June These masses of bubbles would be easily mistaken for drops of dew or at least not suspected of con taining any living beings The bright peagreen leaf hopper abounds late in summer with others of its ilk in the highly colored grasses of damp places which retain their freshness late in the autumn On the other hand the Ptyelus in its brown dress harmonizes with the hues of the upland fields which have turned brown by the summer droughts Many other hemipterous insects however gayly colored after they fly about in their early wingless stages are green like the herbage in which they hide The common squash bug is of the exact color of the garden soil it is only seen about the roots of the plant near the ground while the little yellow beetle Fig 199 is a frequent visitor of the yellow flowers Among the moths which hide on the surface of the ground or in the grass are the numerous species of owlet moths Noctuidic The Agrotis and Mamestra and many others of this family as caterpillars show many pecu jg liar adaptations in color to the soil on which they live The dusk livid cut worms would be easily overlooked as the crawl over the soil when disturbed from their retreats under sticks and stones They move about at night and nocturnal insects are usually dull colored On the other hanl the pretty green cinnamon ° hiiiuish Bug spotted Leitosia L concinnimacula flies by day in the short grass When the larger dull brown moths such as that of the army worm of the north are disturbed they quickly dart into the dry rusty stubble and it is almost impossible to detect them if they remain quiet as they often have the instinct to do when an enemy is close at hand Lichencovered rocks are frequented by certain moths and Fig 190 butterflies which aflord some of the most remark pw Jille cxamiles of protective coloring I have ever V observed This is particularly noticeable in Arc vIliK tic and Alpine Lepidoptera The cranberry fields and barren moors of Labrador abound in little Squash gjjy jjjj imj colored leafrolling moths which Beetle o 7 are impossible to detect until the are startled Some geometrid moths are called carpet moths in England from the large number observed carpeting the lichen and mossgrown rocks of the hills of Scotland I have captured within an hours time as many as seventyfive of the Polar Glaucopter3x on Table Rock at the mouth of the Straits of Belle Isle As they rested on the lichened rocks it was 7 2G4 extremely difficult to detect them so well did their pepper andsalt and greenish hues agree with the gray and green rocks On another occasion while entomologizing on some peculiar light gneiss rocks overgrown witli gray lichens a couple of hundred miles farther north on the Labrador coast I found it impossible to detect the Anartas though resting almost under my feet so closely did these owlet moths re semble the rocks over which I clambered Again on the hills above the Moravian settlement of Hopedule thousands of the beautiful duntinted Chionobas of different species fluttered feebly over the lichenclad rocks the underside of their wings corresponding exactly in color with the ground Fig 200 Fig 201 tinonobaa Buiiiidia Grapta progne on which they rested This scene is iepeated on that bit of Arctic landscape the extreme summit of Mt Washington where the Chionobas semidia Fig 200 from Tennoys Zool ogy occurs as well as in other Alpine peaks of Europe and the Rocky Mountains A georaetrid moth Marmopteryx strigularla which inhabits the mountainous regions of the eastern states from Vermont to AVest Virginia has the same peculiar marbled under surface of the hind wings and also an allied species found in the Sierra Nevada The under side of the Grapta butterflies Fig 201 Grapta progne right side have the color of dead leaves and as they sit in paths with their wings folded over their backs would Packakd INSECTS AS MIMICS 265 be readily mistaken for a dead leaf All these Graptas with Vanessa Antiopa are among the most abundant of our but terflies The most perfect resemblance to a leaf with its stalk is afforded by the well known case of the Kallima figured and described by Mr Wallace in his interesting book entitled The Malay Archipelago The caterpillars which feed on herbage or the leaves of trees are almost universally protected from the attacks of birds by their adaptive coloration Those caterpillars which feed on the pines have a family look though belonging to Fig 202 Fig 203 m Pine Lyda Honeysuckle Abia different natural families For example the larva of the Eu ropean pine Fidonia our native Cleora of the pine the pine Trachea the iine hawk moth EUema and other caterpillars have markings very much in common having as a ground color the peculiar green of fresh pine needles with red stripes and bars corresponding in tone to the red sheaths of the needles The leaves of the Austrian iine are devoured by a saw fly larva Lyda Fig 202 which is reddish olive green with reddish and purple patches and lines The Abia jf the Tartarean honeysuckle Fig 203 is of a peculiar 9 266 pale bluish green color somewhat resembling the peculiar glaucous green hue of the leaf on which it feeds It is gen erally overlooked until the bushes are striped This worm does not seem to be eaten by birds probably on account of the fluid which is suddenly poured out through the pores in the sides of the body when it is disturbed The false cater nillar of the currant saw fly is rarely eaten by birds and enjoys an unusual immunity so also the pear slug Fig 204 perhaps if not on account of its resemblance to a slug for slugs are greedily devoured by birds possibly on Fig 204 Fig 205 Fear Slug Cimbex Larva account of some disagreeable taste The larva of the Cim bex Fig 205 when coiled upon a leaf has a tolerable like ness to the common Helix alholahris Returning again to the grasshoppers the species of the family of Locustarians to which the Katydid belongs are modified for a life hidden among the leaves of trees Nearly all the species are green In their youth tiiey hop about in the grass and are better protected from harm than the young Acrydians which are usually dark though some are green 10 INSECTS AS MIMICS 267 Some species remain in the grass througliout their lives but most of the Katydids and others which produce a loud cry reside in the trees Here it is difficult to detect them their green hues matching so well the hues of the leaves forming their covert Moreover the fore wings are inclined to be broad and oval as seen in those of the Katydid Fig 20G It will be noticed in this insect how closely the veins resem ble those of the leaves There are in the Museum of the Peabody Academy of Science a number of Brazilian species Fig 206 Katydid allied to the Katydid which have very broad thick fore wings some oval in shape like orange or lemon leaves others with jagged outlines somewhat as in the holly leaf Others are of the color of a dead leaf Such is the Cyrto phyllus perspicillatus which bears a close resemblance to a withered leaf There is in Brazil a grasshopper of this fam ily which represents the East Indian Megalodon figured by Wallace on page 5b0 of The Malay Archipelago There are some insects which resemble anything but thera 11 268 HALF HOUKS WITH INSECTS Packaku selves This paradox may be explained by a glance at a Selandria larva Fig 207 which sometimes occurs on the chestnut Its body is entirely concealed by a cottony secre tion which rises half an inch above the body A group of these sluggish caterpillars could feed exposed on a leaf with impunity The bark lice such as Eriosoma cover them selves with a cottony exudation which serves as a disguise Many bright colored flower beetles are protected by their resemblance to the tints of the flowers in which they hide The Galeruca and Clytus almost invariably found on the golden rod in September are thus protected Why butterflies are so much more commonly seen than their caterpillars is not known It is probabl due to the jjQ 207 latter are often of the color of the leaves on which they feed The caterpillar of the Colias Philodice our common sul phur yellow butterfly which lives on clover is rarely found owing to its peagreen tint so much like Selandria Larva ijt of the clover leaf on which it feeds It is possible that the caterpillar is so well protected that the butterflies can aftbrd to have their numbers thinned out by predaceous insects and birds So with tlie caterpil lars of the white cabbage butterflies whose dark green vel vety coats so thoroughly assimilate them with cabbage or turnip leaves or stalks The caterpillar of Vanessa Antiopa is one of the most conspicuous objects in nature large clus ters of these black spiny creatures feeding exposed on the leaves of the willow and other plants It is probable how ever that bristling as they are with spines birds do not fancy them but the butterflies as well as the chrysalides assume the tints of dead leaves and old wood and the but terfly may be easily confounded with the trunks of the trees on which it rests as it does not settle on the ground as in 12 INSECTS AS MIMICS 269 the Graptas Mun geometric moths rest on the bark of trees where they eseape the observation of the entomologist whose eye is trained at loolving for them and perhaps also of the birds The white pine trees often shelter the Tcphro sia Canadcuia which I have found in no other position The Red Under wings or Catocalas spend their days on the bark of deciduous trees and only expose themselves to the attack of birds when they show their gorgeous red and yellow hues in flight The Arctian moths so brightly painted with strong con trasts of black and vermilion or red can afford to be snapped up by the birds which allow their spiny hairy larvae to go scotfree It is possible that the bright colors of the Arc tians and other Bombycidj as well as the butterflies are needed to ensure the meeting of the sexes as by their bright colors they can detect each other afar off though the acute sense of smell possessed by these moths whose antennae are broadly pectinated may be sufficient for ensuring the prompt recognition of each others presence That the white colors of the Spilosoma Virginica and the moth of the fall web worm Ilyphantria textor serve the same purpose of mutual recognition as the conspicuous white Pieris seems probable Mr Darwin Descent of Man i 387 Apiletons edition 1871 states that the common white butterfly as I hear from Mr Doubleday often flies down to a bit of paper on the ground no doubt mistaking it for one of its own spe cies The owlet and geometrid motlis fly in such large numbers that there is a greater chance of their encountering one another in the night particularly as they feed on com mon objects of attraction i e the honey of flowers But all these points need to be thoroughly investigated Many statements and assertions on the subject of mimicry need reexamination and confirmation and some of the Aicts I give here arc simply hints for future observation and ex periment 13 270 The most wonderful cases of protective mimicry among caterpillars are afforded by the geometrids or spanworms I have never seen a better example than that afforded by the larva of Drepanodes varus Fig 208 which feeds on the Fig 208 Fig 209 Drepanodes and Larva and Pupa Stick Insect juniper It would be difficult in the accompanying figure as well as in life to tell where the caterpillar begins or the juniper twig ends The body of the larva holds itself out stiff and rigid after the manner of its tribe with warts over U INSECTS AS MIMICS 271 its back exactly like tlie leaf scars of the juniper and the entire worm concolorous throughout with the bark is a per fect imitation of the twig Nearly every bush has its distinct kind of inch worm or geometer which resembles a broken branch or twig when it is at rest and holds itself out stiff by its muscular hind legs Most caterpillars remain quiet by da when they need protection and feed at night The stick insect Fig 209 from Tenneys Zoology is so obviously a mimetic form that we need only speculate how it came to differ from its allied forms unless the intermediate forms have become extinct through the want of similar adaptation This and the celebrated leafinsect are the two insects which first come to mind when the subject of mimicry is mentioned The Phyllium is broad and flat with leaflike dilatations on the legs Avhile the broad wings are provided with a midrib and vein exactly like a dried leaf Other remarkable stick insects of the group of Phasmids are figured by Professor Westwood in his Tiiesaurus Euto mologicus Oxoniensis Such as the Extatosoma bufonium from Australia Ileteropteryx Castehiandii from Tringany Malacca and Ceroys laciniatus from Nicaragua They are much alike in form though inhabiting different quarters of the globe and are slender with long legs with flattened tubercles and spiny expansions resembling the young and spiny twigs on which they possibly rest The caterpillars of the leafrolling and Tineid moths often live in rolledup leaves where they are protected in a great measure from their enemies thougli the insec tivorous birds attracted perliaps b the deformation they cause in the foliage feed uiCn them and their insect parasites particularly the minute chalcid flies have the requisite instinct to find them out and oviposit in their bodies No insects hoAvevcr protected by these disguises arc ever thoroughly safe from the attacks of enemies cspe 15 272 TPackare cially created to gain their livelihood by preying upon them One of the most striking cases of mimicry is afforded by the caterpillar of the Tohjje Velleda as avcU as that of its ally the lappet moth which is found on apple trees and would easil when at rest be mistaken for a swelling or can kered spot on the bark Harris Treatise on the Injurious Insects of Mass 1862 p 379 Miss Dix as quoted by Harris on the same page states that when at rest the re semblance of its upper surface was so exact with the young bark of the branch on which it was fixed that its presence might have escaped the most accurate investigation and this deception was the more complete from the unusual shape of the caterpillar which might be likened to the ex ternal third of a cylinder The sides of the body were cloaked and fringed with hairs It was of a pale seagreen color above marked with ash blended into white and beneath of a lrilliant orange spotted with vivid black When in motion its whole appearance Avas changed it ex tended to the length of two inches and twothirds of an inch in breadth its colors brightened and a transverse open ing was disclosed on the back twothirds of an inch from the head of a most rich velvetblack color It was sluggish and motionless during the day and active only at niglit The gray color and roughened surface of many longicorn and Buprestid beetles which rest in the daytime on the bark of trees are undoubtedly protective though why multitudes of these two groups of insects are on the other hand among tlie most highly colored and brilliant of any in exis tence needs further investigation Mr Wallace observes that these brilliant beetles would not be eaten by birds on account of their very hard dense tegument but this will equally apply to the gray and dull colored species which are evidently protected by these adaptive colors The bright colored species are the exception in the temperate regions 16 INSECTS AS MIMICS 273 and more the rule in the hot and moist forests of the tropics Here the ph3sical environment of the animal is nndoubtedly the primary cause of its higli colors The buds of plants and trees are imitated by many kinds of weevils whose oval often rough bodies and sluggish natures protect them Such is the plum weevil Fig 210 which looks like a dried plum bud The small cones of the pine are simulated by the Chalcophora liberta a Buprestid beetle Early in June wlien the brown Elaters are coming out of the ground and are found resting on the low maple bushes I have observed some to resemble closely the long leaf buds of that tree Certain small weevils resemble the seeds of plants AVal FiG 210 ¦ Fig 211 Plum Weevil ami Larva Young Clilaniy and case lace quotes Kirby and Spences statement that the small weevil named Onthojihilus sulcatus looks like the seed of an umlelliferous plant Wallace also quotes Bates as saying that some tropical spiders are exactly like flower buds and take their station in the axils of leaves where they remain motionless waiting for their prej Some beetles like the little tliick rounded oblong Chla mys have been noticed by Bates and also by Wallace to resemble the castings of large caterpillars and the case of the larva of this beetle Fig 211 which is not uncommon in the United States is black and oval in shape and would be readily mistaken for a pellet of birds dung Wal lace quotes the statement of an observer who had more than once mistaken an English moth Cilix compressa a little white and gray moth for a piece of birds dung dropped upon a leaf and vice versa the dung for a 110th Wallace also tells us that there are in the oast small bee tles of the family Buprestidse which generally res ca the midrib of a leaf and the naturalist often hesitates before picking them off so closely do they resemble pieces of birds dung The same might be said of the little dark brownish bronzed Brach3s often seen in midsummer resting motion less on the leaves of the oak Some carrion beetles are dark like the decaying bodies under which they live and so are their larvte but why ether Fig 212 Fig 213 Attageiuis Larva Anthrenus and joung forms like the Necrophori and Necrophili are banded sj conspicuously with red or 3ellow does not seem clear to us Many of the small Catops the Nitidulae the Staphylini are dark red or brown or black these colors harmonizing with the sombre tints of the decaying substances on which they Tve I have noticed that the Antherophagus ochraceus a duix ochreous reddish beetle is uf the same hue as the cells of the humble bee in which they are often exceedingly common The Dermestes Attagenus Fig 212 larva and 18 INSECTS AS MIMICS 275 Anthrenus Fig 213 b larva and a pupa all enlarged assinilate in color the dried skins and decaying matter in which they luxuriate Tlie larvre especially are so densely clothed with gray or reddish brown hairs that it is difficult to detect them when at work in dried insects and bird skins Their stealthy ways also favor their protection and these beetles like the weevils and man others when disiturbed feign death How this mimicry of death so common among insects came to be such a universal habit would form a curious sub ject of inquiry It can scarcely perhaps be regarded as anything more than instinctive in the insects of the present day but in the earlier ages of the world Avhen the insects were schooling themselves in the arts of life such acts as these must have been in a degree conscious and only became habitual after many mistakes and trials resulting in the extinction of many individuals and incipient species When one looks at the beds of fossil beings of the earlier geologic periods he peers into the tombs of millions which could not adapt themselves to their constantly changing surroundings No fossil being is known to us which could not have been as well adapted to its mode of life as the animals now living but the conditions of life changed and the species as such could not withstand the possible influx of new forms due to some geological change which induced emigration from adjoining territories or to changes of the contour of the surface with corresponding climatic alterations Let one look at the geological map of North America before the Cretaceous period ere the Rocky Mountains appeared above the sea and reflect on the remarkalle changes that took place to the northward the disappearance of an Arctic continent the replacement of a tropical climate in Green land and Spitzbergen by Arctic cold Are there not here changes enough in the phjsical aspects of our country to warrant such hypotheses of migrations with corresponding 19 276 extinctions and creations of new faunas out of preceding ones as are indulged in by naturalists of tlie present day in the light of the knowledge pouring in upon them from Arctic explorers and western geologists Granted these extraordi nary changes in the phjsical surroundings of the animals whose descendants people our land do not a host of ques tions arise as to the result in the beings of our day of these changes in the modes of life the modes of thought so to speak the formation of peculiar instincts arising from new exigencies of life which have remodelled the whole psychol og as it were of the animals of our country Instincts vary with the varying structure and form of the animals Change the surroundings and at once the mode of life and psjchology of the organism begin to undergo a revolution These changes may result in the gradual extinction of Mhole assemblages of animals which are as gradually replaced by new faunas Many indeed most insects are in our northern hemisphere represented in the colder months of the year by the chrysa lis or eggs These are eagerly sought after by the smaller birds and are in most cases protected by their colors or by their resemblance to the bark of the trees on which they may be laid The eggs of the canker worm are gra like the bark of the tree or paling on which they are deposited The eggs of the tent caterpillar are covered over with a coating of gum so that the bunch looks like an excrescence on the tree The chrjsalis of Vanessa Antiopa is exactly of the color of old wood and it is often found hanging from fences and outhouses while before houses were built for this butterfly belongs to an ancient family it assimilated in hue the bark of trees The cocoons of many of the silk moths like those of the Promethea moth are covered with leaves drawn around them in the process of weaving and hang all winter on the wild cherr having the semblance of a dead leaf Those of the Polyphemus Fig 214 which fall  to tlie ground among the leaves of the oak are covered with dead leaves and the color of the cocoon when bare harmo nizes with that of the soil or leaves Aquatic insects are often nearly colorless like the water they inhabit Many water larvsB are pale green like the plants in which they hide What excellent mimics the cad dis worms and Ranatra and Belostoma are we have previ ously adverted to in the chapter on Insects of the Pond and Stream To the cases there given might be added certain sluggish larvaB like Psephenus Fig 215 and others which Fig 2U Fig 215 Cocoon of the American Silk Worm Psephenus adhere to the under side of pebbles and are thoroughly as similated in color to the mud of streams and the shores of the sea Much light may be thrown upon this subject by a study of cave animals Here the harmony in color and often in form to surrounding objects is most striking and the causes are quite apparent The cave insects becoming blind from the darkness of their subterranean abode lose their colors and are assimilated to the colors of the stalactites on which they walk or the walls of the cave to which they cling The ground beetles instead of being dark like their outofdoor relations here fade out to the color of the limestone sands over which they run The hurmon in form and color with the environments of their subterranean abode is as apparent as tlio cause All the cases hitherto given are examples of unconscious mimicry and in man if not most cases the effect of cli matic and other physical causes resulting in a general har mony of hue and form which adapts all animals to the world in which they live But there are a few cases known in which it is difficult not to believe that at some time in the life of the species there was a conscious intention to deceive I refer to the trap door spiders and other forms which curi ously conceal the entiance to their holes with the manifest design of hiding it from their enemies or of using it as an ambuscade I would refer the reader to Moggridges capital work on Harvesting Ants and Trap Door Spiders for much curious and reliable information regarding the habits of these spiders Like our trap door spider Mygale Fig 62 its allies in southein Europe excavate deep tunnels in the earth they seem to take unusual pains to conceal the entrance from their enemies The hole is usually situated in moss and small ferns etc After the door is made the top is actually planted with bits of moss and small plants so that it is often impossible for the practised e3e to detect the trap door Moggridge remaiks that the moss thus transplanted by the spiders grew as vigorously and had in every way the same appearance as that which was rooted in the surrounding earth and so perfect was the deception that I found it impossible to detect the position of the closed trap even when holding it in my hand There can be no doubt that many nests escape observation in this way and the artifice is the more surprising because there is strong reason to believe that this beautiful doorgarden is deliber ately planted with moss by the spider and not the effect of a mere chance growth The evidence he adduces is strongly confirmatory of this view In the nests of other spiders he tells us that it is rare to find any of the larger mosses or lichens growing upon them but as if to compen sate for this deficiency a variety of foreign materials are employed which are scarcely ever found in cork doors such as dead leaves bits of stick roots straw of grasses etc and I have seen freshly cut green leaves apparently gath ered for the purpose spun Fig 210 into a door which had re centl been constructed We have in this coun try a species of Tarantula Lycosa which as if by design covers its hole with a mass of dead and dry leaves as indicated in Fig 2IG after Emer ton In an article in the American Naturalist vol iv Mr Enierton tells us that his attention was drawn to these nests by Mr J A Lintner who noticed on the sandy hills west of Albany N Y a number of holes about half an inch in diameter each surrounded by a ring of sticks and bits of leaves loosely fastened togetlier by fine threads The larvse of Cassida the helmet beetle and Lema which live exposed IW 1 1 i ii Lycosa in it3 nest to the sight of their ene mies on the niper side of loaves arturd examples of what at some period in tlie life of the species may have been a conscious attempt at deception The larva of Cassida is broad flat and oval edged with long sharp spines By 23 280 means of the two long terminal spines terminating its up turned extremity it holds the old cast skin over its body like an umbrella The beetle itself in its resplendent golden hues has been compared by Wallace to glittering dew drops upon the leaves In another form Chelymorpha cri hraria Fig 217 a inpa whicli is considerably larger than Cassida and feeds very much exposed on the silk weed and sometimes on the raspberry is also protected by its cast skin though in a less degree The larva of the common potato beetle of the eastern states Fig 218 a larva c pupa rf eggs covers its dull gray soft body with a black mass of its excrement Fig 217 Fig 218 Helmet Beetle and Pupa Young Potato Beetle which is at once a protection from the heat of the sun and the attacks of birds wiiich probably regard them as any thing but living and edible insects It would seem then that while in the generality of cases insects harmonize in color and often in form with suiTound ing objects or even distinctly mimic natnral objects this is owing in all probability mainly to the physical environment of the animal in a few cases however there is an appear ance of design and natural selection has been the means by which the mimicry has been effected and the species preserved 24 Packakd LNSECTS as MIMICS 281 Mimicry of other Insects We now come to instances wliere insects resemble others of different genera families and orders They are exceedingly numerous and entomolo gists have been familiar with some of them for at least a century Struck with the fact that as a rule the insects which were mimicked were higher in the scale than the mim ickers tlie writer attempted in an essay published in 18G3 to classify some of the known facts adding some supposed to be new and to give a partial explanation of them In the light of the facts published a year previous to this by Mr Batest and afterwards by Mr Wallace J and JMr Darwin § I am inclined to the belief that the resemblance in pattern and color between insects belonging to different groups is probably due to causes more fundamental than natural and sexual selection and reaching possibly farther back in geo logical time I will quote the following passage from my essay If we consider the Hymenoptera Lepidoptera and Dip tera by themselves in the order in which Latreille has placed them we shall find these three groups full of reciprocal anal ogies Certain forms in the one suborder leap over their neighboring suborder to find their analogues in one a tliird removed or again we see analogous forms between the two higher groups leaving the lowest for a while isolated or on the other hand the two lower groups are thus united leaving the highest one standing by itself For example the clear winged Sesia imitates the

to the buzz which is if anything still louder Also there is the strong est resemblance in some Syrphi to Vespa and especially to different species of Crabro But while the Lepidoptera and Fig 219 Diptera resemble the Hmenoptera we cannot say that Hymenoptera ever assume the form of any flies and moths They seem isolated and resemble only themselves In tlie case of the Laphria the plump beelike form and tlie dense geria yellow and black hirsuties which cause them to be mistaken for humblebees by persons unacquainted with their structural differences are just those features that are exceptional iu the Diptera and are normal in the Hymenop tera Tlie fly to get tliem has to pass over one suborder to obtain a bizarre form which is a prevalent and common attribute of the Apidae There is a similar parallelism of analogous forms between the Coleoptera Hemiptera Orthoptera and Neuroptera which seem bound together by affinities such as those that unite by themselves the bees moths and flies Thus there are certain Hemiptera Corixa that resemble the coleop terous genus Brachys Forficula is analogous to the Staphj linidffi and Blatta may be said to resemble some Lampyridoe The close affinities between the Orthoptera and Neuroptera hardly admit of these analogous forms though we find them 26 INSECTS AS MIMICS 283 still Here again we see the isolation of the Coleoptcra from the other suborders with which it is connected The suborders below it by an exact parallel with the case above mentioned reach up and connect themselves by these re markable analogies with the Coleoptera which do not in turn assume any of their forms Some Orthoptera are very coleopterouslike and some Hemiptera are very coleopter ouslike The reverse cannot be said So the Diptera and Lepidoptera as they advance in their family forms are con stantly throwing out hints and suggestions of forms that seem very strange to them but become generalized in the group that tops them Thus in the broad irregular net veined neuropterous fore wing which becomes smaller and thicker in the orthopterous Blatta and still more coleopter ous in the hemipterous Corixa we arrive at the perfected elytron with its regular obsolete veins and new protective function Most of the examples above mentioned are familiar to entomologists and others will occur no doubt to illustrate the subject more fully IVIan authors hae agreed that the suborders of insects can be arranged into two series or groups often called Man dibulata and Haustellata though disagreeing as to the rela tive rank of these two divisions and the true places the suborders should occupy within them It is enough for my purpose to assume that there are two such series though believing that the two culminate in the llymenoptera and Coleoptcra respectivel in the succession that I have indi cated above What have we now in common with both and which shall reunite this seeming polarity in the two series of sub orders There is needed a group which while retaining its own strong fundamental features and maintaining an equal footing with its equivalent groups shall have besides the strongest analogies to those groups farthest removed by 27 284 Pacicard affinity in order tliat tliese two series may be virtually brought together while the successive forms in the several families shall afford us some conception of the larger cate gories these minor groups foreshadow Such a group Pro fessor Agassiz has pointed out in the class of Selachians which combine the characters of all the other classes of fishes existing during the same period and also by their being the earliest in time afford what he calls jfojhetic types Fig 220 Fig 221 Lepisma Campodea of all the coming classes of vertebrates The former case affords what he calls synthetic types In endeavoring to show that a similar synthesis as marked as in the fishes or reptiles or other groups of animals occurs in the different nonropterous families of insects the case of the Lejnsma Fig 220 L quadrlseriata or bristle tail may be cited which is closely allied to the Campodea Fig 221 Essay on Classification 28 INSECTS AS MIMICS 285 supposed to be a stem form of all the insects and which is a remarkable synthetic type combining the characters of the sixfooted insects and the Mriopods The two families of May flies and dragon flies do not have any species with marked analogies to other insects In an FlG 222 Adult of the Ant Lion other famly however of which the adult of the ant lion Fig 222 is an example we have the Ascalaphus which was regarded by Scopoli as a Papilio the wings being large and broad and the antennai knobbed The neuropterous Mantispa Fig 223 in its fore legs adapted for seizing its prey mimics the orthopterous Mantis The Panorpa Fig 224 the type of another family of netveined insects assumes the shape of the crane flies Tipula Bittacus has its analogue in the fly named Bittacomorpha The large lacc winged fly called Polystoechotes has some features reminding us of the Hepialus Fig 225 The Cdddis flics imitate the Tineid moths so closely that excellent entomologists have confounded them The species of Psocus mimic the Aphides so closely that they are often 2d Mantispa 286 HALF llOUKS WITH ENSECTS mistaken for each other and the wingless Atropos or death tick reminds us of the louse The ants have among the Neuroptera their well known analogues the Termites or white ants Like the true ants they live in large colonies and have wingless workers of two sorts Now these and certain peculiarities in structure which place the white ants at the head of the Neuroptera are just those which make them so much like the true ants which are among the most highly developed insects ranking near the honey bee From the facts here and elsewhere given it may be re garded as quite well proved that some if not the majority of mimics among insects belong to groups lovver in the or ganic scale than the insects they mimic Moreover the paleontological record shows that the Neuroptera were the Fig 224 Fig 235 Panorpa Hepialus first to appear The fossil forms discovered were also S3n thetic types combining the characters of other neuropterous and some orthopterous families These fossil insects it should be olserved were remarkable mimics but we have no proof that the living insects they resemble were then in existence Wo can only explain the matter by regarding ihem as prophetic tjpes anticipating in nature the coming of whole families and even orders of insects They repre sent ancestral or stem forms from which arose lines of de scent resulting in the present insect creation The original Devonian May flylike insect and the Xenoneura and Ilomo thetus as well as the Carboniferous Miamia and Hemeristia and Eugereon possessed features which they have perhaps transmitted through different sources resulting in families whose distinguishing marks are based on the primordial traits united in tlie same insect but now scattered in differ ent families For example the raptorial fore leg and form of the head of the singular neuropterous insect Miama the peculiar veining of the Avings form characters now existing in two very different families Just as the embryo dog passes through a fish and a reptile stage before attaining its canine physiognomy have the Neuroptera of the jresent day in the process of building up new groups based on a modification of a single character thrown aside the characters united in the more embryonic and primitive t3pes We would thus expect to find among the fossil insects the most startling anticipations of types not yet called into existence The scanty paleontological record we have shows that the grasshoppers and their allies appeared after the Neuroptera that the bugs Hemiptera appeared still later tliat the moths and butterflies were very late in their arrival that the flies probably preceded the Ilymenoptera and that the bees and wasps the most highly developed structurally and intellectually of all insects were the latest to be developed It is a startling fact that the white ants which foreshadow so wonderfully the true ants appear in great force in the coal formation while tiie ants do not occur fossil before the Tertiary period Now as an example of mimicry any one ignorant of the geological record would rcgaid the case of the white ants as one of the best but the fiict is the white ants were nearly as perfect and doubtless as wonderful in their colonizing instincts in the Carboniferous period as in the age of man Clearly then mimicry in the sense of being a factor in the origin of species does not as a rule exist thougli there may be exceptions and it is not improbable that a large iroportion of socalled mimics are so by virtue of their similar physical surroundings There have been cycles of creation as if the  same thought were taken up in successive geological periods and worked out in different ways but with the same funda mental plan The plan is the result of an unbroken line of forms transmitted by genetic descent the variations in the typical forms have been induced by changes in the soil and air These lines of development from socalled archetypal forms suddenly stop and we have to follow them back before we can again take up the thread of development of other lines There is not a continuous chain of being but lines of development sometimes parallel but more often diverging and connected by cross ties and branches linking the animal creation into a whole all converging to a primordial ances tor perhaps no more highly organized than the structureless Moner a drop of living moving selfreproducing proto plasm Turning now to the cases of mimicry in the butterflies described by Messrs Bates and Wallace and Trimen from South America the East Indies and South Africa respec tively all agree that the Heliconidae are mimicked by other butterflies which are ver unlike the members of their own families and cop in form and color the HeliconidiB which probably owing to a bad odor are not eaten by birds and thus multiply in great abundance The object of the mimic is claimed to be a utilitarian one It flies about in the dis guise of a Heliconia and were it not for this protection it and its offspring would become extinct This resemblance moreover has probably these authors claim been brought about by natural and sexual selection In the beginning some butterfly through the tendency to variation assumed by Mr Darwin had a remote resemblance to a Heliconia this favored it above its fellows and the character growing more strongly marked became perpetuated until after a great number of generations the similarity of form became perfected Mr Darwin adopts the view and regards the mimicry as brought about by natural and sexual selection 32 INSECTS AS MIMICS 2 Bates sajs that a large number of the species of Ileli couklae are accompanied in the districts they inhabit by otner species whicli counterfeit them in the way described The imitators belong to the following groups Papilio Pieris Euterpe and Leptalis family Papilionidse Proto gonius Nymphalidie Ithomeis Erycinidne Castnia Cast niadae Dioptis Pericopis Iljclosia and other genera Bom bycidae moths I conclude that the Heliconidie are the objects imitated because they all have the same family facies whilst the analogous species are dissimilar to their nearest allies perverted as it were to produce the resemblance from the normal facies of the genus or family to which they severally belong The resemblance is so close that it is only after long practice that the true can be distinguished from the counterfeit when on the wing in their native for ests I was never able to distinguish the Leptalides from the species they imitated although they belong to a family totally different in structure and metamorphosis from the Heliconidne without examining them closely after capture They fly in the same parts of the forests and generally in company with the species they mimic In the United States we have a similar example the only one known in this country The Danmis Disijnis is one of our most common butterflies It is closely copied by the Limenitis Archippxis Fig 226 from Tenneys Zoology which is unlike in color every otlier known species of its genus The Archippus enjojs immunity frfm the attacks of birds on account of its pungent odor which is supposed to be disagreeable to them hence it is vorj abundant Tiie Disippus butterfly on the other hand which is inodorous is supposed to be mistaken by tlic birds for the Archippus and thus multiplies in as great numbers as the pattern it copies Such are the opinions of these distinguished writers It will be noticed that tlie Ileliconidre are regarded by Mr Bates and in this respect Mr Trimen agrees with turn 19 1 gyu as standing at the head of the group of butterflies the Papi lio usually being assigned to this position Here then the mimickers are possibly lower in rank than the butterflies they mimic This is certainly the case with the Castnia and the moths mentioned by Mr Bates and bears out our idea that the mimickers may have been produced in an age ante rior to the origin of the Heliconidic and that the causes which produced the one perhaps originated the other The Fig 22G Limeiiitis Archippus mimickers created in a former geological period may have been preserved by virtue of their resemblance to butterflies originating at a later date Many of the Bombycid moths are remarkable mimics of other moths and this group with tlie wide gaps in it may be compared to the Neuroptera witli their isolated genera and families I regard the Bombycids as an ancient family in which time has made many inroads and the relics which have come down to us may have owed their preservation largely to the protective mimicry of tlie caterpillars anil co coons to leaves and other objects and of the moths to other moths Assuming then that protective mimicry has been an im puriant lactor in the preservation of species we will exam 2 INSECTS AS MIMICS 291 ine a number of cases some of which are not recorded so far as the writer is aware but which any one can see for Iiimself in his rambles out of doors The humble bees are mimicked bj the Apathus which takes up its abode in their nests The peculiar relations existing between the Apathus and its host are not well understood The Apathus is closely related to the humble bee only differing fiom it in the structure of the jaws and hind legs disabling it from gathering honey and pollen and caring for its young Another well known mimic of humble bees is the Volucella a large plump hirsute fly in form and color closely copying the bee Protected by this resem blance they enter the nests of their hosts and their young devour the young bees Bees fiq 227 are also mimicked by certain Syrphus flies see Fig 107 and by Laphria flies The wasps are imitated often very closely by certain Srphus flies Fig 26 a The most extra ordinary case of this kind is a Syrphus fly called Spilomyia I Vespa maciilata I once noticed this fly resting on a leaf in northern Maine and involuntarily drew back supposing it to be a white faced wasp Vespa maculata Fig 227 It is smoothbodied with the abdomen nearly cylin drical and thoroughly wasplike The position and form of the markings are almost exactly as in the wasp the face is white and the eyes are banded with white in imitation of the white orbits of the Avasps Even the abdomen or hind body is banded only towards the tip as in the wasp while the legs are slashed with white much as in the wasp An otlier Syrphus Epopter vittatxs with a cylindrical body is banded with bright yellow and resembles the Vesjya vulgaris while there are other species such as Doros hahjras which 3 292 HALF HOUKS WITH INSECTS resemble the Odynerus wasp Other forms recall the mason bees Osmia and two green species Srrjjhus ohscurus and Sargus obscurus recall Ceratina the little green bee which tunnels the blackberry and syringa The Euglossa a bee with a remarkably long tongue is mimicked by Pangonia equally favored with a long beak Wasps are also mimicked by lower Hymenoptera as the large Chalcis fly Leucospis Fig 228 which is so unlike others of its family The Trypoxylon wasp with its clubshaped body is copied by the Conops even to the peculiar hue of the front edge of the wings Descending the scale of hymenopterous life we come to the Pompilus Fig 61 which is mimicked by the large black Mydas fly whose antennae are unusuall loig and hymenopterouslike Certain ants are mimicked by species Fig 23 Clerus beetles which are colored in the same manner and run rapidly on the branches of bushes very much like ants A certain beetle is called Formicomus from its resemblance to Formica the ant Among butterflies the Papilio or swal lowtailed butterfly is very closely mim Leucospis 1 1 1 n icked both in form and color by the highly colored swallowtailed geometrid moth Urania and there is another geometrid moth that recalls the tailed The cla The Thyris moth is copied by the Desmia a little black P3ralid moth with large white spots on the wings On the otlier hand there are some moths which resemble so closely those of families below them that to this day in some cases entomologists have been mistaken in regard to them The Doryodes with its feathered antennoe is in reality an owlet Noctuid moth but has until recently been re gaxded as a geometrid moth allied to Aspilates So with Boletobia and Pachycnemia which are also Noctuid moths with analogies to the geometrid moths Among the Bomby cid moths are such forms as Euphanessa and Crocota which 4 IXSECTS AS MIMICS 293 remind us of geometiid moths and they fly by day associated with them The wingless flics nearl always show a tendency to re semble spiders from the wingless gnatlike Chionca Fig 229 a down to the sheep tick the bat tick Fig 229 c and the bee louse Fig 229 h I do not regard these however as cases of protective mimicry but interesting Fig 229 Chionea Bat tick Bee louse analogies resulting from the loss of wings and other dcgra dational characters induced by their usually parasitic mode of life A singular case of mimicry may be olserved in the moth Lycomorpha so named ly Dr Harris from its resemblance when at rest to Lycus which possesses broad wingcovers elytra The fore wings of the moth are shaped like the elytra of the beetle the veins being mucli raised like the ridges on the beetles wings while the arrangement of the colors is almost identical and the antenna of the moth are broad and flattened like those of the beetle The burrows of the mole cricket arc in North Carolina as I have been informed by Mr Slnite tenanted by a large bug which has fore feet somewhat like those of the mole 5 294 HALF HOUKS WITH INSECTS Packakd cricket Here the change in form has been evidently in duced by its fossorial life and we should not perhaps regard this as a case of protective mimicry There are other bugs of large size with the legs provided with flattened expan sions like some longhorned beetles 6 INSECTS AS ARCHITE A N historical sketcli of human architecture would scarcely begin Avith a description of the capitol at Washington or of Westminster Abbey or the still incomplete catliedral of Cologne but would rather extend back to the earliest forms of human shelter even to the pile dwellings of prehistoric Switzerland nor would the historian disregard the rock shelters of Europe and this country or tlie caves of Dordogne In his accounts of the rise of the art of building he would be obliged to treat the subject after the method of tlie paleontologist and recon struct the primitive dwellings of the men of the reindeer period from the scanty relics of their age with the aid of the huts and wigwams of savage tribes now living Work ing out these problems he would then reconstruct in the imagination the vast structure of Stonehenge the palaces of the Aztecs and would then be prepared to deal with the rise of architecture in Egypt India and Greece So we may study the subject of insect architecture in the light of paleontology and finding in the rocks the remains of lost tribes judge what manner of builders they might have been by the work of their survivors of the present day vhose forms for aught we know are little superior to those of their ancestors of Devonian times just as the sav age of today is perhas scarcely a step in advance of the wearer of the skull of Tuolumne valle or the cave of Neanderthal Without much doubt the first cavedweller was some Po duran Fig 230 or a Campodealike being if such lived in Presilurian times They were tlie troglodytes of that misty period living in holes in the earth which wound their devi 7 296 HALF HOUKS WITH INSECTS PAcnAKT ous way under stones There have been found in rocks of the coal period spiderlike forms supposed to be allied to our modern harvest men or the cave dweller of Vfyandotte Cave Fig 231 after Cope whose outofdoor relatives are said b Simon a French entomologist to burrow several feet deep in the porous soil of southern Europe Associated with these fossils are found the remains of undoubted spi ders and in all likelihood they spun silken nests and thus Fig 230 Fig 231 Podura Erebomaster anticipated eons ago the light graceful iron work of our suspension bridges crystal palaces and mammoth railroad stations But as early as the Devonian period the time which ushered in the Coal epoch when the ferns and land plants made their appearance and the huge ganoids and sharks disported in the seas at this early date insects resembling the May fly but much larger fluttered over the low shores and sluggish streams of our continent Since they must have had the same organization as the modern Ephemera see Figs 117 118 it is reasonable to suppose that they had the same habits The first architects then so far as fossil evidence goes in their larval stage lived in burrows con 8 INSECTS AS ARCHITECTS 297 structed in the mud or in rude tunnels beneath stones at the bottom of streams and ponds or they supported their arched ways on the stalks of aquatic plants These builders of Devonian times in a way unconscious to themselves tried the strength of their rude building material practised the art of the mason and applied the principles of the geome trician in their rough and ready mechanics In the Coal formation we find wings of fossil insects closely resembling our white ants and belonging perhaps in the same family Now some species of tliese insects are among the most skilled architects in the insect world We shall see farther on how remarkable their large roomy dwell ings are Otiiers construct tunnels in deca3ed trees Our common white ant Termes Jlavipes is known either to mine the roots of grape vines the trunks of elms pine stumps or to run secret galleries in the sills of houses or to live under flat stones with nests apparently like those of ants found in the same situations Different species so far as we know have quite different habits For example the nests of Termes arborum are described by Smeathman as surrounding the branch of a tree at the height of seventy or eiglity feet and though but rarely of so large a size as big as a very great sugar cask They are composed of small particles of wood and the various gums and juices of trees combined witli ierhaps those of the animals and worked by these little industrious creatures into a paste and so moulded into innumerable little cells of very different and irregular forms These nests are very compact and so strongly attached to the boughs on which they arc fixed that there is no detaching them but by cutting them in pieces or sawing off the branch The nest communicates with the ground by covered wa3S leading to the roots of the trees Again he describes some nests that resemble the complex nests of Tennes heUicosus but are smaller and of simpler construction They are built in sandy plains and 9 298 are composed of a black mud which is brought from a few inches below the white sand and are built in the form of an imperfect cone or bellshaped having their tops rounded These nests are generally about four or five feet high Smeathman Other nests are built in the form of a mush room The most elaborate architectural works perhaps under taken by any insects are the nests of the Termes bellicosus observed by Smeathman Our figure from Figuier after Smeathman will give an idea of the nest and its interior with the Termes family grouped in the foreground Smeath man a traveller in Guinea who published his account of these insects in 1781 claims and we think with reason that the Termites resemble the ants also in their provident and diligent labor but surpass them as well as the bees wasps beavers and all other animals which I have ever heard of in the arts of building as much as the Europeans excel the least cultivated among the savages It is more than prob able they excel them as much in sagacity and the arts of government it is certain they show more substantial in stances of their ingenuity and industry than au other ani mals and do in fact lay up vast magazines of provisions and other stores a degree of prudence which has of late years been denied perhaps without reason to the ants The nests or termitary of this white ant are more or less conical or sugarloafshaped rising from ten to twelve feet above the surface of the ground Indeed they are said to be still higher by Jobson in his History of Gambia quoted by Smeathman as follows The Ant hills are re markable cast up in those parts by Pismires some of them twenty foot in height of corapasse to contayne a dozen men with the heat of the sun baked into that hardnesse that we used to hide ourselves in the ragged tops of them when we took up stands to shoot at deere or wild beasts Purchass Pilgrims vol ii p 1570 Smeathman tells us 10 Packakp insects as ARCHITECTS 299 that on those he saw four men eoukl stand with ease The nests are ornamented with numerous conical turrets some times four or five feet high Tlie walls of this dome are exceedingly hard and form a sort of shell protecting an inte rior building divided into an amazing number of apart ments for the king and queen and the nursing of their numerous progeny or for magazines which are always found well filled with stores and provisions These colos sal hills begin as little turrets a foot high others are built near them the highest one being built in the middle until the spaces between are filled up and the whole built together into a single dome This outer shell or dome not only pro tects and shelters the rooms within but maintains an equi table temperature and moisture within very necessary for hatching the eggs and cherishing the young ones In the centre of the inner building near the base is the ovenlike royal chamber which is enlarged from an inch to six or eight inches or more in the clear as the queen in creases in size Here the king and queen are kept willing prisoners as the entrances are only large enough to admit the workers which are much smaller The ro3al chamber is surrounded by multitudes of smaller apartments which con nect with the larger magazines and nurseries The maga zines are filled with provisions consisting of the gum of trees in small tears resembling the sugar about preserved fruits The nurseries containing the eggs and young are built of wooden materials seemingly joined together with gums and situated around the royal chamber All these apartments lead by arched passages into an open area or rotunda under the dome which is compared by Sineathman to the nave of a cathedral This nave is surrounded bf three or four very large Gothicshaped arches which are sometimes two or three feet high next the front of the area but diminish very rapidly as they recede from thence like the arches of aisles in perspectives and are soon 11 ¦SOO »¦ ¦ lost atepnthe innumerable chambers and nurseries behind tliera This nave is covered with a roof sufficient to keep the room dry during the heavy rains This roof is not ex actly flat because the Avorkers are always adding to it by building more chambers and nurseries so that the divisions or columns between the future arched apartments resemble the pinnacles upon the fronts of some old buildings and demand particular notice as affording one proof that for the most part the insects project their arches and do not make them as 1 imagined for a long time by excavation The floor of the nave is very tliick and forms the roof of the royal chamber though containing several nurseries and magazines It is likewise water proof and contrived as far as I could guess to let the water off if it should get in and run over by some short way into the subterraneous pas sages which run under the lowest apartments in the hill in various directions and are of an astonishing size being wider than the bore of a great cannon I have a memoran dum of one I measured perfectly cylindrical and thirteen inches in diameter These subterraneous passages or galleries are lined very thick with the same kind of clay of which the hill is com posed and ascend the inside of the outward shell in a spiral manner and winding round the whole building up to the top intersect each other at different heights opening either immediately into the dome in various places and into tlie interior building the new turrets etc or communicating thereto by other galleries of different bores or diameters either circular or oval From these large galleries smaller ones extend to various parts of the building and a great many run three or four feet under ground where the Ter mites obtain the fine soil with which they build their nests Other galleries adds Smeathman ascend and lead out horizontally on every side and are carried under ground near to the surface a vast distance for if 3ou destroy all 12 INSECTS AS ARCHITECTS 301 the nests within one hundred 3ards of your house the in habitants of those which are left unmolested farther off will nevertheless carry on their subterraneous galleries and in vade the goods and merchandizes contained in it by sap and mine and do great mischief if you are not very circum spect Smeathman then remarks that the galleries are neiessarily large as they are the great thoroughfares for all the laborers and soldiers going forth or returning upon any business whatever whether fetching clay wootl water or provisions and they are certainly well calculated for the purposes to which they are applied by the spiral sloie which is given them for if they were perpendicular the laborers would not be able to carry on their building with so much facility as the ascend a perpendicular with great difficulty and the soldiers can scarce do it at all It is on this account that sometimes a road like a ledge is made on the perpen dicular side of any part of the building within their hill which is flat on the upper surface and half an inch wide and ascends gradually like a staircase or like those roads which are cut on the sides of hills and mountains that would otherwise be inaccessible by which and similar contri vances they travel with great facility to every interior part This too is probabl the cause of their building a kind of bridge of one vast arch which answers the purpose of a flight of stairs from the floor of the area to some opening on the side of one of the columns which support the great arches which must shorten the distance exceedingly to those labourers who have the eggs to carry from tlie royal chamber to some of the upier nurseries wliich in some hills would be four or five feet in the straightest line and much more if carried through all the winding passages which lead through the inner chambers and apartments Whether the work of these white ants is due to the opera tions of a blind instinct or unconscious automatism may well be doubted It should be borne in mind also that the 13 302 HALF HOUKS WITH INSECTS insects belong to the lowest division of the winged insects and even geologically speaking to a very ancient stock It is significant to find developed in them such a high degree of architectural skill The mechanical ingenuity of the case worms is shown in the construction of their cases Tliese are ancient types of insect forms thought to be in some respects similar to those occurring in the coal formation while undoubted caddis flies occurred in the Wealden strata of the Lower Creta ceous formation Sir Charles Lyell assures us that a large species of caddisworm which swarmed in the Eocene lakes of Auvergne in France was accustomed to attach to its dwelling the shells of a small spiral univalve of the genus Paludina It must have resembled the cases of the British Limnophilus Jlavicornis whose case Fig 232 is covered Fig 3 with little fresh Avater snail shells Other examples of the work of these interesting insects are given on page 132 They gather bits of leaves or sticks or particles of gravel Avith their jaws and arransje Case worm » j i o them around tlieir bod covering their hind body first and then building on to the anterior end gluing the particles together by means of a silky secretion They probably do not use their fore legs in this process at least the clothes moth does not in constructing a similar case Other cases are made by rolling up a strip of leaf deftly cut out of the required length and width as seen in Fig 92 while others more careless attach broad irregular pieces to their cases Another netveined insect which shows much ingenuity in the construction of its dwelling and mucli low cunning in providing itself with food is the ant lion This is the larva of the Myrmeleo Its body is broad and flat armed with enormous scissorlike jaws which project straiglit out from the head It lives in colonies sometimes numbering over 14 INSECTS AS ARCHITECTS 303 six liiinclrecl individuals eacli Ijing at the bottom of its hole Mr Emerton has described in the American Naturalist iv p 70 the habits of our Mijnneleo immaculatiis Fig 233 with the larva seen from beneath and the pupa It digs a pit in the sand an inch deep and two inches iu diam eter Mr Emerton thinks the ant lion begins its hole by making a circle and afterwards throwing out the sand from the centre In digging he used his flat head and jaws which were pushed under several grains of sand and then jerked upwards throwing their load sometimes as far as six inches and alwa3s far enough to avoid leaiug a ridge around the pitfall When the pit was finished he was en tirely concealed beneath it as in Fig 233 except his jaws Fig 233 Ant Lioii and its pit which were spread apart horizontally at the bottom The surface of the pit being as steep as the sand could be piled up was very easily disturbed and when an insect ventured over the edge the antlion was apprised of it at once by the falling sand lie immediately began to throw up sand from the bottom deepening tlie pit and so causing the sand to slip down from the sides and the insect with it The ant lion seized it with his long jaws and held it above his head until he had sucked all he wanted from it when he threw the remainder out of the hole and repaired the trap After eating he became more timid and sometimes would not take a second insect If however several were 15 304 put into the pit at once lie would bite one after the other until all were killed before deciding on which to begin While the grasshoppers do not construct nests they have various methods of securely depositing their eggs either in the earth or in rotten wood or on the surface of leaves Tiie wingless grasshoppers avail themselves of rocks as shelters a notable example being the wingless grasshopper of Mam moth and other caves in Kentucky Fig 234 The English cricket is said by White in his Natural History of Selborn to form burrows in the earth but this habit has not yet been discovered in our American species The mole cricket however is known to burrow in damp places in this country Fig 234 Cave Grasshopper as well as Europe where it forms an ovenlike chamber in which it deposits about a hundred eggs It also constructs extensive galleries similar to but smaller than those of tlie mole The tunnel runs just under the surface of the soil and may be detected by the slightl raised ridge of soil like that made by the mole Among the bugs Hemiptera the only species we can now recall as constructing a domicile is the young of tlie seventeenyear Cicada Our figure 235 after Rile repre sents the conical nests raised above the surface of the soil in wet and damp places rising from four to six inches above 16 Packaud INSECTS AS ARCHITECTS 305 the ground with a hole e at the base Mr Rathvon who observed this fact says that the pupae await in the upper end of these chambers their time of transformation into the wiiiied state and wlien about to come from the ground move backwards down the tube to below the level of the earth as at d and issuing forth from the orifice would attach themselves to the first object at hand and undergo their transformations in the usual manner Many plant lice allied to the Aphis by their punctures cause the adjacent parts of the leaf to curl over and conceal Fig Younpr 17vcar Cioaila and its nest them or even give rise to the true galls as elaborate as those of the gull lly A kind of Peniijhigus forms on the sumac the irregular growth represented by figure 23G after Riley The cockscomb elm gall Fig 237 after Riley often occurs in great numbers on the leaves of the white elm By the end of June or the beginning says JMr Walsh the gall becomes full of winged plantlice when the slit on the upper side of the leaf through which the mother plant louse built up the gall early in tlie spring gapes open and 20 17 306 HALF HOURS WITH IXSECTS allows the insects to escape into the open air These galls can scarcely be regarded as evidences of architectural skill as they are indirectly due to the simple punctures of the beak of the insect not to an intellectual act Among the beetles we shall not find evidence of any con siderable skill in building Tlie habit of the Chlamys of building a compact little case has already been referred to Its case is black and appears to be formed of little pellets of excrement with a seam along the middle of the under Fig 236 Sumac grail side which readily spreads open when the sac is pressed The case is slightly contracted at the entrance where the pellets are a little larger than elsewhere The weevils are the lowest of the beetles and yet they display in some cases great

folded together Before beginning to roll up the leaf she gnaws the stem nearly off so that after the roll is made and has dried for perhaps a day it is easily de tached by the wind and falls to the ground Then folding the leaf she tightly rolls it up with her jaws and legs neatly tucking ill the ends until a compact cylindrical solid mass Fig 217 Fig Cockscomb gall Attelabns is formed Before the roll is completed she deposits a single egg rarel two in the middle next to the midrib where it lies loose in a little cavity While she is thus engaged her partner a little smaller may often be seen watching her from the otlier end of the leaf but never lending his aid as in the case of the timber beetles The roll serves as a mass of food for the young grub to feed upon and may be ie garded as an artificial bud The larvfE of the Tiger beetles have the requisite instinct to make deep tubular pits in which they lie in wait for their 19 308 HALF HOUKS WITH INSECTS prey The construction of their nests does not require so much intelligence as is shown by the ant lion The larva is a hideous being with a large horn on its back by which it is enabled to prop itself up in its hole None of the flies are architects Some involuntarily form galls of various shapes in which the maggots are domiciled For example the gallfly of the willow forms the familiar pineconelike swelling Fig 239 found on willow twigs while another kind forms a mass of willow leaves like the Fig 239 Willinv gall Cabbnge willow gall sprouts on a cabbage Fig 240 The manychambered gall of the gallgnat of the grape vine is represented by figure 241 this and the two preceding figures from Riley and Mr Riley has delineated the filbert gall which grows in large masses on the grape vine Fig 242 representing a mass of them

which it feeds sticks them together by means of a silky secretion and thus forms a close dense sac As it grows instead of throwing away the sac it has outgrown it makes a slit on each side fills in the rent with new material and adds more to the mouth thus enlarging and refitting its house Certain small caterpillars of the Acrobasis and other allied genera economize their excrement constructing

the tent caterpillars which spin from their mouths an immense quantity of silk out of which they build large tents between the branches of trees and run rope walks along the upper side of all the branches leading away Fig 242 Filbert Grape Gall from their tent The nest of a species of Tortrix which lives on the wild cherry consists of a large mass of leaves sewed together with silk forming a shelter from the heat and rain and a protection from the birds There are numberless modifications of leafrolling habits among the smaller caterpillars but after all no insects with 22 IJNSECTS AS ARCHITECTS 311 the exception of the Termites present such evidences of mechanical skill as the bees and wasps and ants The Hymenoptera of which they are the most familiar examples were among the latest insects to appear on the surface of the earth The lower forms so far as the scanty records show appeared first in the Jurassic rocks while the ants are first found in the amber of the Tertiary period so that the ants and wasps and bees were in all probability among the latest insect creations This inference is borne out by the fact that the individuals and species are ver abundant Did they belong to an ancient stock their numbers would have been thinned out The lowest hymenopterous insect which lives in a house of its own not however made with its own hands is a kind Fig 243 Clothes Mth

orbitalis lives is at first a bud vhich is enlarged two or three times its natural size l»cfore it unfolds in spring In the autumn it bores through the walls of its dwelling and descends to the ground burrowing an inch deep below the surface Here it 23 312 HALF HOURS WITH IXSECTS Packakd spins a thin silken whitish cocoon Other species take up their abode in galls made by twowinged gall gnats and are hence called guest or inquiline sawflies These galls are sometimes inhabited also by a caterpillar so that we have a sawfly caterpillar a true caterpillar and a maggot making use of the same kind of gall They do not however crowd into the same domicile at once In this case at any rate nature does not set the laws of hygiene at defiance and crowd two or three fiimilies in a single room The necessi ties of modern civilization or an outgrowth from it in our cities crowd several families in a single room Is not a human life of as much accouut as a caterpillars The sawflies with their exceptional gallmaking habits anticipate in nature the true gall flies those singular beings Fig 244 whom a gall is their world and the gall of bitterness a perennial foun tain of nectar To these little white maggots the young gall flies the poor scribbler who is obliged like Douglas Jerrold to feed his family out of an inkstand owes his all Quite uncon Basket Worm scious of the responsibility

grain of sand lies passively in its cell while the growthforce of the plant erects a house over and around this foreign body No more intellectual act is needed on the part of the guest than in its unconscious host the plant The case of the gall maggot is an excellent example of unconscious automatism while I imagine the reader will agree with me that the case of the white ant or the true ants as well as many bees and Avasps is of an entirely dif ferent order and oarries us into a sphere where tlie sensibili ties the will and the intellect exert at least some force 24 PACKAun INSECTS AS ARCHITECTS 313 The largest gall we have is made b the Cijnips confluens found on the scrub oak It sometimes attains a diameter of two inches It begins to form as soon as the leaves unfold It is at first gicen and pulpy and has a central kernel in wliicli the maggot resides When tlie gall is ripe the shell becomes hard and dr and after the fly has es caped which occurs in June and again in October the de serted shell is often tenanted by wasps Some galls as the bedeguar of the rose are covered with vegetable hairs and the variety of form in others is very great On the rasp berry and blackborr as well as the blueberry occur differ ent sorts of galls All are the result of the sting of the female which is thought by some to convc a poison into the wound though it is a question whether the egg introduced by the sting or ovipositor docs not act as an irritant body causing an excessive flow of sap and accumulation of cells resulting in the formation of a tumor Passing by the ichneumon flies which after all have the best of it as they are tenants of living homes supplied with the choicest of food at no trouble and expense to themselves we come to the cuckoo flies The Chrysis Fig 245 is not a true wasp but is in some re spects allied to it Its integument is very hard and tliick and beautifully tinted with green and blue and vari ous metallic colors When assailed it rolls itself into a ball in the manner of a pill bug Its sting is large and exceedingly painful but not ioisonUs Tle Chrysis is called a cuckoo fly as it has the ichneumon trait of living at the expense of other insects This fly may often be seen flying about posts and hollow stalks of plants exploring the holes of wasps and bees wlure they lay their eggs The young hatch out some time after the larval bee or wasp anil then attack the latter sucking its 25 314 blood The patience and perseverance under great natural difficulties the danger to which they are exposed from the attacks of their unwilling hosts would form an interesting chapter but we must come now to the true builders The ants are their own architects their own masons and laborers I shall not now speak of their colonies and com plex mode of life It is well known that the workers carry on the labors of the colony and to these beings which have not the power of transmitting their qualities but inherit them from their parents has been imparted a high degree of skill in fact somewhat of those qualities which charac terize the highest types of human civilization for Avhile ants are fully capable of defending themselves and as every Fig 246 body knows are bold and aggressive to a fault the also excel in the arts of peace As bridgemakers they have anticipated our civil engineers The driver ants Anomma Fig 24G which are blind are said by Dr G A Perkins who has observed them in Western Africa to often bridge narrow streams of water when these come across their path by going in large numbers upon a flexible plant on one side of a stream until river n jj jjgit causes it to bend to the other side This ant is certainly equal in this respect at least to the monkeys which are said to cross streams in a similar manner But it is in the construction of underground tunnels that ants aie preeminent The late Gideon Lincecum so well known for his acute powers of observation in an account of the CEcodoma Texana states tliat they often carry their subterranean roads for several hundred yards in grassy dis tricts where the grass would prove an impediment to their progress On one occasion to secure access to a gentle mans garden where they were cutting the vegetables to pieces they tunnelled beneath a creek which was at that place fifteen or twenty feet desp and from bank to bank 26 INSECTS AS ARCHITECTS 315 about thirty fe5t Another species in Brazil according to Rev Hamlet Clark will tunnel a ditch and he adds Indeed I have been assured again and again by sensible men that it has undermined in its progress through the country the great river Paraiba as broad as the Thames at London Bridge at any rate without anything like a natural or arti ficial bridge it appears on the other side and continues its course It would be exceedingly interesting to watch the succes sive steps of this tunnelling process to learn how they plan their work how the mine is run under the stream with such true engineering skill from one side to the other how the danger of undermining and flooding are overcome Here we have a slight anticipation of the Thames tunnel though this is said to have been suggested by the tunnel of the ship worm which lines its hole with limestone Ants also dig wells The same Texan CEcodoma we are told by Dr Lincecum needs water as much as cattle or men and like the latter tiey dig their own wells In one case where a man dug a well reaching water at a depth of thirty feet the ants dug a well to the same depth with a diameter of twelve inches As mound builders the ants are indefatigable With the aid of their jaws they carry out grain after grain of sand and from being primarily tunnellers they become mound builders An ant hill common object as it is is a marvel of patient and untiring labor Think of the toil and mus cular exertion spent by these ants in climbing from the depths below up the perpendicular walls of their nests with their burdens and busy as they appear to us by day they are said to do the greater part of their work by night In clayey countries in Mexico the Oicodomas build enormous ant hills so that one perceives them from afar by the pro jection which they form above the level of the soil as well as by the absence of vegetation in their immediate neighbor 27 316 hood These nests occupy a surface of many square metres and their depth varies from one to two metres Sumichrast The exact height of these ant hills is not stated The largest earthen nests of which we have any account are those described by the Jesuit Dobrizhoffer and alluded to by West wood in his Introduction to the Modern Classification of Insects The conical nests of these ants which abound in the plains of Paraguay are said to be as hard as stone and three or four ells high A Flemish English and French ell are three five and six quarters of a yard respectively which measurement is intended by the Portuguese writer or Prof Westwood is not stated By English measurement the hills would be about twelve feet high This is the only case where the hills of the ants emulate in size those of the Termites Our largest native nests are made by the For mica sangicijiea or common large red ant and consist of sand or claj according to the nature of the ground Un doubtedly the object of the ants in making the hills is to keep the water out of their burrows but in Labrador where it rains nearly every other day I have observed that this or an allied species makes no hillocks but lives exclusively in underground passages Another kind of ant attains a still higher degree of civili zation The Agricultural ant of Texas studied for so many years by Dr Liucecura is said by him in the American Naturalist to build paved cities and construct roads In a year and a half from the time the colony begins the ants previously living concealed beneath the surface appear above and clear away the grass herbage and other litter to the distance of three or four feet around the entrance to their city and construct a pavement consisting of a pretty hard crust about half an inch thick formed of coarse sand and grit These pavements would be inundated in the rainy season hence at least six months previous to the coming of the rain they begin to build mounds rising a 317 foot or more from the centre of the pavement Within these mounds are neatly constructed cells into which the eggs young ones and their stores of grain are carried in time of rainy seasons In another place he adds that some old settlements have a pavement fifteen feet in diameter and a mound in the centre a foot high The roads extend for half a mile from the formicar or ant hill One kind of Mexican ant Pseudomyrma flavidula is known to live within the spines of the Mimosa the hole for the entrance and exit of the ants fig 217 being made near the end Fig 247 a In India a greenish ant CEco phylla smaragdina is said by Jer don to form a nest sometimes a foot in diameter by drawing living leaves together without detaching them from the branch and uniting thcin with a fine white web An other Indian ant like the paper wasp makes a small nest about Ant nest in thorns half an inch or rather more in diameter of some papyra ceous material which it fixes on a leaf Jcrdon The ants belonging to the genus Crematogaster and which from their resemblance to a wig are known bj the popular name of Negrohead in Brazil according to IMr F Smith construct their nests on the branches of trees suspending them in the same way as wasps to the nests of which they have a close resemblance on removing the outer covering however they exhibit a very different construction being composed of multitudinous curved intricate ramifications all leading to the interior chambers and galleries There are many sand wasps which excavate holes in the ground and deposit at the bottom of their burrow living but paralyzed insects among which they lay their eggs A 29 318 typical example is the Spliex Fig 59 whose habits have already been doscribecl The mud dauber PelopcBus Jlavi pes is a slender form brightly banded and spotted with yellow and is found all over the country Her cells of pel lets of mud plastered on the wall of a house are common objects known to every school boy These cells are built of la3ers of mud of unequal length the pellets being placed in two rows diverging from the middle Tliey are a little over an inch in lengtli and about half as wide and arc seen in section to be triangular in outline Tiie larva within spins a brown silken cocoon after eating up the store of paralyzed spiders whose remains may often be found tucked away at one end of the cell Several cells usually occur together covered over with a common layer of mud Tliis habit of collecting materials for their nests is shown more distinctly in the black Sphex S tibialis which forms its nest in the tunnels previously made by the carpenter bee in a piece of pine board In an example described in my Guide to the Study of Insects the hole was six inches long and the oval cylindrical cocoons were packed loosely either side by side where there was room or in a single row The interstices between them were filled with bits of rope which appeared as if they had been bitten in pieces b the wasp itself while the end of the cell was filled for a dis tance of two inches with a coarse sedge arranged in layers as if rammed in like gun wadding Another exception to the burrowing habits of the sand wasps is afforded by a Brazilian species of Larrada which according to Mr Bates builds a nest composed apparently of the scrapings of the wooll texture of plants it is at tached to a leaf having a close resemblance to a piece of German tinder or a piece of sponge In thus availing itself of the scrapings of the bark of plants we have a slight anticipation of the papermaking wasps The wood wasps evince fully as much if not more architectuial skill 30 Packaud insects as ARCHITECTS 319 than the sand wasps The different species of Crabro with their hxrge cubical heads tlie Philanthus Fig 248 and Cerceris refit old nail holes and tunnel rotten wood filling their holes Avitli aphides caterpillars beetles and spiders etc The European Philanthus apivorus has the unfortunate habit of provisioning its nest with hone bees so j 243 also with a species of Cerceris The smaller blackish species have the most interesting habits In Europe according to Prof West wood the prey of a species of Oxybelus con sists of flies which it has a peculiar mode Philanthus of carr3ing by the hind legs the while it either opens the aperture of its burrow or else forms a new one with its anterior pair A Tr3pox3lon wasp was detected in England frequenting the holes of a post preoccupied by a species of Od3nerus a solitary wasp closely allied to the social paper wasps into which it conveyed a small round ball or pellet con taining about fifty individuals of a species of Aphis this the Odyncrus upon her return invariably turned out flying out with it held ly her legs to the distance of about a foot from the aperture of her cell where she hovered for a moment and then let it fall and this was constantly the case till the Trypoxylon had sufficient time to mortar up the orifice of the hole and the Odyncrus was then entirely excluded for although she would return to the spot repeatedly she never endeavored to force the entrance but flew off to seek another hole elscwiierc The stems of the syringa elder black berry and other pithy shrubs are also favorite nesting places of these wood wasps Several species have been found by Mr Angus nesting in the stems of the syringa all their nests have a family resemblance being simple tunnels with out any pretensions to architectural skill The stems of the blackberry or syringa arc often tenanted by the little green Ceratina bee Figure 249 represents a 31 320 Fig 250 Fig 249 syringa stem containing the cells of this bee separated at regnlar intervals by little parchment partitions tlie spaces between them being filled with dirt The cells are filled by the parent bee with pollen a store of food for the grub A great step in advance is the home of the carpenter bee Fig 250 which is bored in solid pine wood or even hard wood sometimes for a foot or more The work is done by the jaws of the bee and the hole is bored as evenly as by an anger After boring the hole it is partitioned off by chip walls a pellet of pollen on which the larva feeds having been previously placed in each coll Here is a specimen of mechani cal ingenuity and architec tural skill which is cer tainly surprising and in dicates some forethought Nest of and a certain degree of Ceratina reasoning power In the succeeding chapter the

like the coral polyps some ascidians and mossanimals are compound with even as in the latter possibly a common nervous sjstem forming a colonial system of organs which simultaneously minister to the

set of indi viduals directly minister to the wants of others all are dominated by their interest and devotion to tlie head of the colony the queen and all work together for the common good of the entire community Let us turn again to Smeathmans work for a general view of the indoor life of this busy people this model republic whose domes rose above the tall reeds of the low Guinea coast centuries before Plato wrote his Republic Of every species says Smeathman there are three orders first the working insects which for brevity I shall generally call labourers next the fighting ones or soldiers which do no kind of labour and last of all the winged ones or iierfect insects which are male and female and capaljle of propagation These might very oppositely be called the nobility or gentry for they neither labour nor toil nor fight being quite incapable of either and almost of selfdefence These only are capable of being elected kings or queens and nature has so orderetl it that they emigrate within a few weeks after they are elevated to this state and either establish new kingdoms or perish within a day or two 21 1 322 HALF HOUIIS WITH INSECTS LPackaud Fig 251 Female worker

with that of the soldier of the same species c in which the body is nearly twice as large while the head is enormous and armed with long scissorslike jaws for purposes of attack and defence There are about one hundred laborers to one soldier The winged females are found flying about at the begin ning of the rainy season After being on the wing for a few hours they descend to the ground where they are at once attacked by the true ants which drag multitudes of them into their nests so that Srneathman remarks that it is won derful that a pair should ever escape so many dangers and get into a place of security Some however are so fortu nate and being found by some of the labouring insects that are continually running about the surface of the ground under their covered galleries which I shall shortly describe are elected kings and queens of new states all those who are not so elected and preserved certainl perish and most probably in the course of the following day The manner in which these labourers protect the happv pair from their innumerable enemies not only on the day of the massacre of almost all their race but for a long time after will I hope justify nic in the use of the term election The little industrious creatures immediately enclose them in a small chamber of cla suitable to their size into Avhich at first they leave but one small entrance large enough for themselves and the soldiers to go in and out but much too 324 HALF HOUKS WITH INSECTS Packakd little for either of the royal pair to make use of and when necessit obliges them to make more entrances they are never larger so that of course the voluntary subjects charge themselves with the task of providing for the offspring of their sovereigns as well as to work and to fight for thera until they shall have raised a progeny capable at least of dividing the task with them It is not until this time that the nuptials of the royal pair take place The queen then lays her eggs to tlie amount of sixty in a minute or eighty tliousand and upward in one day Meanwhile the laborers having construted a small wooden nursery as before described carry the eggs and lodge them there as fast as they can obtain them from the queen These nurseries may be in some cases four or five feet distant in a straight line and consequently much farther by their winding galleries Here adds our author the young are attended and provided with everything necessary until they are able to shift for themselves and take their share of the labours of the community As an illustration of the wonderful intelligence of these social Termites as compared with that of solitary insects Smeathman in speaking of their numerous underground gal leries by which thej go about in the neighborhood of their nests with the utmost security in all kinds of weather says that if they meet a rock or any other obstruction they will make their way upon the surface and for that purpose erect a covered way or arch still of the same materials continu ing it with many windings and ramifications through large groves having where it is possible subterranean pipes run ning parallel with lliem into which they sink and save them selves if their galleries above ground are destroyed bj any violence or the tread of men or animals alarms them When one chances by accident to enter a solitary grove where the ground is pretty well covered with their arched galleries they give the alarm by loud hissings which we hear 4 THE SOCIAL LIFE OF INSECTS 325 distinctly at eveiy step we make soon aftei which we may examine their galleries in vain for the insects but find little holes just large enough for them by which they have made their escape into their subterraneous roads These galleries are large enough for them to pass and repass so as to pre vent any stoppages though there are always numerous pas sengers and shelter them equally from light and air as well as from their enemies of which the ants being the most numerous are the most formidable How Avell the soldiers perform their duty and the laborers theirs is described by Smeathman who says that if you make a breach in a slight part of the building and do it quickly with a strong hoe or pickaxe in the space of a few seconds a soldier will run out and walk about the breach as if to see whether the enemy is gone or to examine what is the cause of the attack He will sometimes go in again as if to give the alarm but most frequently in a short time is followed by two or three others who run as fast as they can straggling after one another and are soon followed by a large body who rush out as fast as the breach will permit them They then attack in their blind rage whatever object they come in contact with whether the leg or foot of the curious naturalist who has made the disturbance all the time making a crackling noise with tlieir jaws beating them on the sides of the building AVhen all is quiet and before the soldiers are all inside you will see the labourers in motion and hastening in various directions towards the breach every one with a burthen of mortar in his mouth ready tempered This they stick upon the breach as fast as they come up and do it with so much dispatch and facility that although there arc thousands and I may say millions of them they never stop or embarrass one another and you are most agreeably deceived when after an apparent scene of hurry and confu sion a regular wall arises gradually filling up the chasm Other instances are given by this excellent observer in illus 5 326 tration of the wonderful exactness of the division of labor in these insects Smeathman well observes that by tiie soldiers being so ready to run out upon the repetition of the attack it appears that they but just withdraw out of sight to leave room for the labourers to proceed without interrup tion in repairing the breach and in this instance they shew more good sense than the bulk of mankind for in case of a conflagration in a city the number of people who assemlle to stare is much greater than of those who come to assist and the former always interrupt and hinder the latter in their efforts The sudden retreat of the labourers in case of an alarm is also a wonderful instance of good order and disci pline seldom seen in populous cities where we frequently find helpless people women and children without any ill intention intermixing in violent tumults and dangerous riots Smeathman then speaks of the obstacles thrown in his way while examining the nests by these intelligent crea tures in addition to the brittleness of the works inside They fight to the very last disputing every inch of ground so well as often to drive away the negroes who are without shoes and make white people bleed plentifully through their stockings Neither can we let a building stand so as to get a view of the interior parts without interruption for while the soldiers are defending the outworks the labourers keep barricading all the way against us stopping up the different galleries and passages which lead to the various apartments particularly the royal chamber all the entrances to which they fill up so artfully as not to let it be distinguishable while it remains moist How faithfully the queen is watched over by the laborers who have so many other duties to perform is very striking and is a puzzling problem to those who would take the ground that these social insects are guided alone by blind instinct or an unconscious automatism Read Smeath mails account of their doings when the rojal chamber is finall laid bare He sa3s tliat these faithful subjects never abandon their charge even in the last distress for whenever I took out the royal chamber and as I often did preserved it for some time in a large glass bowl all the attendants continued running in one direction around the king and queen with the utmost solicitude some of them stopping in every circuit at the head of the latter as if to give her something When Ihc came to the extremity of the abdomen they took the eggs from her and carried them awaj and piled them carefully together in some part of the chamber or in the bowl under or behind any pieces of broken clay Yhich lay most convenient for the purpose It is the reserve mental power shown by these insects in rising to extraordinary occasions such as these that excites our astonishment Blind instinct will serve for the per formance of the most ordinary routine work of tlieir social life but even instinct is often at fault and unless there is sometliing in these beings akin to reasoning powers one is at a loss to account for their readiness in dealing with unex pected emergencies as seen in their manner of repairing their houses IIow insects came to be social is difficult to conjecture The whole course of nature is opposed to concentrated effort on the part of animals Nature from their birth scatters them The few species of insects which are social are the exceptions to the rule as the ancient civilizations of As syria pgypt and America are phenomena exceptions to the isolated tribes and families of savage peoples existing around them The whole course of human progress tends to show that man at first lived in scattered families which gradually assembled in scanty triles drawn together for mutual protection At first the fact tliat colonies of insects exist so highly differentiated as the white ants seems one of the most potent arguments against the development hypoth 7 328 esis but on reflection Ave cannot account for their origin witliout supposing that tliey have resulted through natural laws such as have acted in building up human societies And the fact that there are all grades of complexity of social life among the Termites down to species which are nearly solitary almost on a par socially with other insects shows that these clans powerful from their superiority in numbers and intelligence have been organized in consequence of pre eminence in physical and mental qualities in the veiy face of the disorganizing forces of nature This steady advance seen in certain lines of animal life the degradation and retrogression in many others show that there is something working through and above the ordinary laws of nature which evince Infinite Power and Willforce not of the world of matter Fritz Mijller who has observed the white ants of Brazil has discovered that besides the four kinds of individuals first made known by Smeathman there are wingless males and females as well as winged ones so that the complexity of the social life of these insects is still farther increased In a published letter to Mr Darwin he remarks For some years I have been engaged in studying the natural his tor of our Termites of which I have had more than a dozen living species at my disposition The several species differ much more in their habits and in their anatomy than is gen erally assumed In most species there are two sets of neuters viz laborers and soldiers but in some species Calotermes Hag the laborers and in others Anoploter mes the soldiers are wanting With respect to these neu ters I have come to the same conclusion as that arrived at by Mr Bates viz that diflTerently from what we see in social Hymenoptera they are not modified imagos sterile females but modified larvae which undergo no further met amorphosis This accounts for the fact first observed by Lespes that both the sexes are represented among the sterile packaud the social life of IXSECTS 329 or socalled neuter Termites In some species of Caloter mes the male soldiers may even externall be distinguished from the female ones I have been able to confirm in almost all our species the fact already observed by Mr Smeathman a century ago but doubted by most subsequent writers that in the company of the queen there lives always a king The most interesting fact in the natural history of these curious insects is the existence of two forms of sexual individuals in some if not in all of the species Besides the winged males and females which are produced in vast numbers and which leaving the termitary in large swarms may intercross with those produced in other communities there are wingless males and females which never leave the termitary where they are born and which replace the winged males of females whenever a community docs not find in due time a true king or queen Once I found a king of a species of Eittenaes living in company with as many as thirtyone such complemental females as they may be called instead of with a single legitimate queen Termites would no doiibt save an extraordinary amount of labor if instead of raising annually myriads of winged males and females almost all of which helpless creatures as they are perish in the time of swarming without being able to find a new home they raised solel a few wingless males and females which free from danger might remain in their native termi tary and he who does not admit the paramount importance of intercrossing must of course wonder why this latter manner of reroduction b wingless individuals lias not long since taken the place through natural selection of the production of winged males and females But the wingless individuals would of course have to iair always with their near relatives whilst by the swarming of tlie winged Ter mites a chance is given to them for the intercrossing of indi viduals not nearly related Among the ants the colony arises in the following manner 9 330 Packaed The workers hibernate rarely the females and in spring take care of the eggs and larvse produced the previous autumn In the course of the summer the males and females appear and late in summer on warm days they fly in the air in swarras After the nuptial flight the females may be seen running about on the ground biting their wings off They enter tlie ground sometimes the old holes and lay their eggs and then die The nests of some species of ants contain several thousand individuals There are no species of true ants which construct such complex nests as the Termites but in the sociability displayed by them their love for their own kind and interest shown in other insects they far surpass their prototypes the white ants and evince a psychological development that has a human element in it which apears to be superior and superadded to the usual law of selfpres ervation and selfish instincts controlling the lower animals I shall not dwell on the ordinary life of the colony as the history of the formicarium is given in entomological works It may be observed however that the ants simply place their 3oung in underground holes not building cells for them as do the wasps and bees and that the workers are undevel oped females while in the Termites the laborers are unde veloped individuals of both sexes We will now glance at some of the liabits of ants which are the result of their living in crowded communities but are not characteristics necessary for the preservation of each and every species One trait sometimes manifested in a prosperous and rich community of men is the oppression and enslavement of their weaker neighbors So welltodo luxurious colonies of ants go on foraging expeditions and each member of the party brings home in his jaws a sable ant Our common red ant Formica sangninea which builds high hills in the woods is known to enslave a negro ant How in one instance this operates on the captors is seen in the case of the Pohjergus 10 THE SOCIAL LIFE OF INSECTS 331 rufescois ¦which is said by Mr Frederic Smith to enslave four secies of ants These slave hunters are totally unable to perform their own labor as they are incapacitated as La treille tells us on account of the form of their jaws and the accessory parts of their mouth either to prepare habita tions for their family to procure food or to feed them The sole motive says Kirby for their predatory excur sions seems to be mere laziness and hatred of labor Tliey will not move or feed themselves Iluber shut up tliirty of the slavemaker ants in a glazed box supp3ing tliem with joung of tlieir own kind and hone Many of them died of hunger and the rest seemed likely to when he introduced a single negro which restored order making a cell in the earth in which it placed the young slaveholder brood and then saved the lives of the survivors Here we have two colonies united each consisting of three sets of individuals but the complicated work of the formicary goes on without any apparent disorder such is the perfect division of labor Tliesc Ilelots build or repair the common building make excursions to collect food at tend uion the females feed them and the hirvre and if the weather be suitable daily sun the eggs larvre and pupaj The love of acquisition so common a trait with ants as seen in their storing uj seeds and enslaving other species extends to the keeping of herds of cattle namely the docile Aphides which receive the Caresses of the ants and yield up their honey dew with true bovine meekness Some under ground Aphides live in ants nests The Aphides living pri marily on the roots of vegetables it is a question whether the ants excavate their nests around the root to which the Aphides are anchored by their long beaks or whether they are introduced by tlic ants These social creatures also go so far as to keep dilTerent sorts of beetles in their nests either on the surface of the ant hill under stones or down stairs in the basement of their dwellings When alarmed 11 332 the ants may sometimes be seen running down their holes with these entomological poodles in their arms If horses and dogs fraternize and institute Platonic loves why should not the ants Such patterns of all the domestic virtues have their pets This is a bright side to the ordinary selfishness and utter absence of an moral attribute in these beings and is a makeshift for goodness of heart which should draw out our sympathy towards these creatures The ants work day and night with occasional intervals of rest and we are told by Kirby that the actually amuse themselves with sports and games A colony of ants was observed by Bonnet enjoying the sunlight one of their amusements consisting in their carrying eacli other on their backs the rider holding with his mandibles the neck of his horse and embracing it closely with his legs Huber also saw a numerous colon of Formica rufa at play I approached one da he says one of their formicaries exposed to the sun and sheltered from the north The ants were heaped together in great numbers and seemed to enjoy the temperature which they experienced at the sur face of the nest None of them were working this multi tude of accumulated insects exhibited the appearance of a boiling fluid upon which at first the eye could scarce fix itself without difficulty But when I set myself to follow each ant separately I saw them approach each other mov ing their antennte with astonishing rapidit with their fore feet they patted lightly the cheeks of other ants after these first gestures which resembled caresses they reared upon their hind legs by pairs they wrestled together they seized one another b a mandible by a leg or an antenna the then let go their hold to renew the attack they fixed themselves to each others trunk or abdomen they embraced the turned each other over or lifted each other up by turns He compares these sports add Kirby and Spence to the gambols of two puppies and tells us that he not only  333 often observed them in this nest but also in his artificial one Surel these ants exhibit nearly as much intellect as the monkeys and other animals though perhaps not so intelli gent as the domestic animals which have been educated by their intercourse with man Tlie Qcudohia Mexicana Fig 252 female has two sorts of workers the common one with a small head and the Fig 252 Fig 23 Female CEcodoinu major workers with enormous heads Fig 253 Sumi chrast says that the intelligence of these ants is wonderful They are seen in immense numbers transporting leaves to place in their nests and this is done by the same principle of the division of labor so marked in the white ants A part of these workers cut off the leaves and others collect them and carrying them off to their nests march in long processions each with a leaf over its shoulder like an umbrella hence they are sometimes called um brella ants Sumichrast says that if the tree is not too lofty one can satisfv J vorkcr CEcoiomu himself that a party of foragers which have climbed the tree occupy themselves wholly in the labor of cutting them off while at the foot of the tree are the carriers which make the journeys between the tree and the nest 13 334 HALP HOURS AVITH INSECTS Packakd Bates previously made similar statements regarding the Brazilian CEcodoma ceplialotes They have he says reg ular divisions of laborers numbers mounting the trees and cutting off the leaves in irregularly rounded pieces the size of a shilling another relay carrying them off as they fall The largeheaded individuals do not work and are only to be seen on disturbing the nest An important part of the work in some ant colonies is the storing up of seeds An East Indian ant Pheidole provi dens collects so large a store of grass seeds as to last from January and February the time of their ripening till October We have in this country an agricultural ant whose histo rian the late Dr Lincecum of Texas declares has the instinct to sow the grass from which the seeds are gathered by it He is a reliable observer and studied this ant Myr mica molefacieiis for a period of eighteen jears The asser tion that the ants actually plant the grass may be confirmed or not by future observation He makes the statement however that at the site of their nests there were little patches of the same grass scattered about on the little glade which had doubtless been planted there by some experienced ant for it had been neatly cleared of all other vegetables in fact cultivated b them He subsequentl states in the same connection American Naturalist vol viii 51G that this species of ant subsists almost entirely on small seeds great quantities of which it stores away in its gran arycells to supply food for winter During rainy seasons in the autumnal months it happens right often that the ground becoming saturated the water penetrates their gran aries and swells and sprouts their seeds In this emer gency they bring out the damaged grain the first fair daj and exposing it to the sun until near night they take in all that is not actuall sprouted I saw them in G W Gentrys farm one day have out on a flat rock as much as a gallon of 14 PACKAKu THE SOCIAL LIFE OF INSECTS 335 wheat sunning I wanted to see how the would manage to get so much back again and returned again tliat evening just in time to see tlieir hosts come out and carry it in in five minutes But Mr Moggridge the autlior of tliat entertaining book Harvesting Ants and Trapdoor Spiders lias quite dis pelled whatever doubts have arisen in the minds of modern naturalists respecting the frugal irovidcnt habits of certain ants fulh proving the accuracy of Solomons words Go to the ant thou sluggard consider her ways and be wise which having no guide overseer or ruler provideth her meat in the summer and gathereth her food in the harvest Again The ants are a ieople not strong yet they prepare their meat in the summer Our author also juotes Hesiod Horace and Virgil as rclerring to this habit of the ants But il21ian who lived in the time of Hadrian supplies full details Moggridge quotes him as follows In summer time after harvest while the ears are being threshed the ants pry about in troops around the threshing floors leaving their homes and going singly in pairs or sometimes three together They then select grains of wheat or barley and go straight home by the way they came Some go to collect others to carry away the burden and they avoid the way for one another with groat politeness and consideration espe cially the unburdened for tlie weight carriers Now these excellent creatures when they have returned home and stored their granaries with wheat and barley bore through each grain of seed in the middle that which falls olf in the process becomes a meal for the ants and the remainder is unfertile This these worthy housekeepers do lest when the rains come the seeds sliouhl sprout as the would do if left entire and thus the ants should come to want So we sec that the ants have good share in the gifts of nature in this resect as well as others Northern observers have denied that ants lay up seeds IT 336 HALF liOUJlS WITH INSECTS Now two of these species of harvesting ants noticed by Mr Moggridge inhabit France and Switzerland as well as Italy but are not known to have this habit north of the Alps so that it appeared probable to him that they do store in the south but not in the north Here we have one of the most striking cases on record of an entire change of habit in the same species in different climates One would think that the seeds stored up in this way would germinate and be a source of trouble to the ants They treat them however in such a way as to prevent their germination Tiiousands of seeds from twentyone nests were examined and only twentyseven in seven nests sliowed traces of germination though our author on removing the seeds from the granaries and planting them found that they readily grew When he says the seeds do germinate in the nests and it is my belief that they are usually soft ened and made to sprout before they are consumed by the ants it is ver curious to see how the growth is checked in its earliest stage and how after the radicle or fibril the first growing root of dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous seeds has been gnawed off they are brought out from the nest and placed in the sun to dry and then after a sufficient exposure carried below into the nest The seeds are thus in effect malted the starch being changed into sugar and I have myself witnessed the avidit with which the contents of seeds thus treated are devoured by the ants While everything may go on harmoniously in one colony ants are nevertheless extremel sensitive to the code of honor and protracted duels take place between different colonies of the same species as well as of different species Moggridge says that the most savage and prolonged con tests which he has witnessed were those in which the comba tants belonged to two different colonies of the same species Atta barbara will carry on the battle day after day and week after week I was able to devote a good deal of time to watching the progress of a predatory war of this kind waged by one nest of barbara against another and whicli lasted for fortysix days from January 18 to March 4 These wars are usually the result of thieving expeditions Tliis Atta barbara is said b IMoggridge to drill holes in the rock a fact not known to me until after the last chapter on Insects as Architects was printed In two cases sa3s our author I have found nests oi Atta barbara at Mentone which were carried far into the living rock in places where it happened to be of an even grain and not gritty or pebbly as it frequently is It was quite by chance that I first discovered this very interesting fact having tracked a train of seedbearing workers to a part of the sandstone rock where steps had quite recently been hacked out leading to some terraces At one point where the rock was almost entirely solid and without tlaw or crev ice and where it was clear that the passages were entirely the work of the ants we measured a tunnel b worming a straw down into it and found it to be ten inches in lengtli He subsequently traced this tunnel or rock gallery down until it communicated with a chamber filled with Avinged ants and seeds of several kinds This granary was horizon tal and merely an enlargement of an ordinary galler of compressed spindle shape flattened from above downwards measuring as nearly as I could estimate three inches in length by a trifle less than an inch in breadth and half an inch in height The walls were tolerably smooth but not prepared or glazed in the way that certain small terminal cells which I shall shortl describe were IMany more facts afforded by competent observers might be adduced to throw light on the interior life of these ant repullics How perfecth each one does the work allotted to it how equally the division of labor is carried out with what admirable harmony and unity of purpose all work for the common end that end the preservation and maintenance 22 17 338 of the species we have seen The subject has by no means been exhausted Over a thousand species of ants have been already described The published observations relate to but a few of this legion of specific forms In this country no observers have yet occurred except Dr Lincecum and Mr J A Allen who have published anthing worthy of note on the habits of our native species Here is a rich nnworked mine of knowledge which will afford the most interesting results to the younger naturalists of the country AVhen the good time comes that millennium of American biological science when all our species of animals shall have been classified we shall hope for good work in the field of the observation of habits The wasps are both social and solitar3 The latter build separate cells of sand or mud sometimes placing several together These cells are filled with the paralyzed bodies of caterpillars and other insects and closed up The young wasp begins life with a living supply of food at hand The larvffi at least help themselves Not so with the newl born young of the social wasps They are daily fed by the parent or worker wasp Here we come again to insects where a large part of the duties of the hive those maternal cares only evinced in other insects by the mothers themselves devolve upon a spinster race who have apparently all the labors and anxieties with out the realities of maternity What a strange phenomenon this possession of the mental traits of the softer sex if that term will apply to these insects for the Avorkers sting while the males are harmless without the ower of transmitting them The simplest form of nest in the social wasps which we have in the United States are those of the Polistes which consist of a number of cells attached by a common stalk to the branch of some bush the entire nest being large enough to cover a third of ones hand the cells being placed mouth 18 THE SOCIAL LIFE OF INSECTS 339 downwards I have noticed in Virginia during the last week in April three species of Polistes beginning their nests and working in the same manner I never saw the nests at an earlier stage than when consisting of three cells but it was easy to see tliat the first cell was only partially built before the other two were begun and that virtually the wasp builds the three cells almost simultaneously Tlie outer edges of the incipient cells are said by Waterhouse to be perfectly circular but at the time I saw them they were slightly angular on the outer edge and by the time the cells are nearl completed the hexagonal form of the cells is attained The wasp thus changes her plan of working be ginning to build them saucershaped then cupshaped and finally forming them into deep hexagonal tubes But one wasp a female which has hibernated builds a cell Now this act of building the sixsided cell is in the wasps of the present day purely instinctive but I firmly believe that when nature had the ancestors of these wasps in training the built rude solitary more or less silierical cells and only as the force of surrounding circumstances made them social did they build more than one cell and put them together when they were obliged partly by the necessity of mathe matical laws acting in a degree under the control of their reason to build them in hexagons There are social bees such as the humble bees in which the cells made by the larvie are oval though closely pressed together Wh do not they assume a hexagonal form if this is due simply to mechanical pressure But look at the adult honey ee or the Meliiona or Trigona wliich build hexagonal cells They are not wholly the instruments of mechanical laws but prob ably had in the earlier histor of the species sulllcient intel lect to enable them to build their cells in hexagons I am induced to take this view from seeing the wasp change its plan of building from a circular to a hexagonal one as the cells grow higher and become more numerous These crea 19 340 tures are in a sense free agents and are able to make a slight use of physical laws through the exercise of reason It is probable that after thousands of generations these habits at first slowly and painfully acquired have become moulded into instincts sometimes even nowadajs at fault For wasps and bees may make mistakes as well as men My assertions would assume the form of arguments could I lay before the reader the multitudes of shapes in which wasps and bees build their nests The gradations from the simple nests of the solitary wasps up to the complicated enormous nests of some species of Vespa are manifold and are evidences that their different styles of architecture are outgrowths of a single simple spherical cell each kind dif fering according to the intellectual traits of its builder and the peculiar exigencies of its life The cells of these wasps though for the most part con structed of bits of wood and the bark of trees gnawed off by the wasp are in their earliest stages largely composed of silk secreted in the salivary glands of the wasp Perhaps chewing this woody matter promotes a freer flow of the se cretion At any rate the silk is plastered on thickly bj the wasp She is very careful to have the common pedicel by which the cells are suspended of great strength it must therefore consist almost entirely of silk I have watched a Polistes by the hour plastering the pedicel with silk going over it with its tongue and proving its work with its sensi tive antennae which rapidly patted the work as if they were fingers By the time three cells are perhaps onehalf made the wasp lays an egg at the bottom of two of them by the time the fifth cell is partly completed the four others each con tain an egg As the cells increase in number through the industry of the parent more eggs are laid The young hatch from the eggs first laid and now the duties of the parent wasp are doubled She feeds the young with flies 20 THE SOCIAL LIFE OF INSECTS 341 and other insects often aiding tlie butelier by flying off with the blowflies that spoil his meat Here is a field for the exercise of the wasps reasoning powers impelled and guided as they are by her primary parental instincts It is in the minor doings the accidents of life so to speak that their reasoning powers are brouglit into action Most of mankind live by their instincts rather than their reason They labor in the same fashion as their grandfathers as for instance in farming men till the ground in the same fashion as their forefathers and when quickwitted persons those who use their perceptive and reasoning faculties endeavor to improve upon the customs of the olden time everybody knows how hard it is to have them changed Their primitive mode of farming from becoming habitual becomes instinctive and often nothing but the love of money the selfish principle stronger in some men than the love of their kind gets them out of the ruts when from being qiasi creatures of a blind instinct unconscious automata they with others aid in the advancement of their race So there are philosophers and reformers who do the thinking for the masses And some thing of this kind must go on in the animal world or there never would have been progress upwards in the animal scale Some new exigency due to a change in their ihysical en vironment arises when a new line of action is begun re sulting in a new set of habits new instincts and new species the physical embodiments of the novel intellectual qualities characterizing the new creations In about a month a brood of workers appear Thoy at once aid the old queen in building more cells and now the nests incicase more iapidly in size The material for them is mostly taken by the workers from the bark of trees or the palings of fences the wasp gnawing them off with her large heavy jaws In this way the great hornets within the last ten or fifteen 3ears in the vicinity of New York have actu ally scraped off the bark of lilacs so as to disfigure them 21 342 Packaud But nature has prohibited them from rearing offspring of their own They feed the 3oung and watch over them until a new brood apiears late in the summer The famil circle is now completed A few females and males appear and linger on until the early frosts of autumn kill the latter when their wives take shelter under leaves or in cracks under the baik of trees there to await the warmer days of spring The paper making wasps various species of Vespa as soon as a tier of cells is partially built begin to build out a wall of paper from near the base of the pedicel This grows more and more as the cells iucrease in number when arranged in several tiers sup ported by pedicels they are completely walled in by the intelligent wasps The nests of the common wasp which Vespa maciilata builds about houses are seldom larger than ones fist but the nests of the Vespa maculata Fig 254 are twice as large as ones head All wasps are not makers of paper The oriental wasp Vespa orientalis builds its cells of cla and according to Waterhouse the work is exceedingly beautiful and true Another species sajs Mr Frederic Smith of the British Museum makes its nest of sandy loam the exterior being so hard that a saw used in opening one of its sides was blunted Among the social wasps there are two series and it is difficult to say which is the higher in fact the Hymenoptera as a group may be compared to a tree the topmost branches no one more preeminent than the others representing the social species The ants are fully as intelligent their social life as fully if not more complex than that of the wasps or 22 PuicAui THE SOCIAL LIFE OF INSECTS 343 liecs We may siiy that there is a parallelism in the intel lectual life as well as physical forms of these insects In the tioics there are social wasps with exceedingly numerous colonies Such is the Nectarina a plumpbodied visp which in Mexico huilds a large nest externally like that of a wasp but more irregular and with the walls con sisting of but a single layer The interior of the nest is ver dilferent the galleries of cells instead of being parallel being arranged in concentric spheres The papiermache wasp as we may call it or Chartergns chartarlns makes a nest of the consistency of the densest pasteboard which is attached by a broad base to the bough of a tree and is about twice as long as thick ending in a cone in which is the entrance from which is a passage from the middle to the basal gallery while the other galleries are formed ly a con tinuation of the sides of the nest and arranged in a conical plane The Tataa morio of Cayenne builds a nest somewhat like tliat of the 2Kpiermache wasp but the galleries form a flat floor and each gallery has a separate entrance from the outside of the nest The nest of the social Synoica cyanea is formed b a single layer of cells fixed against the trunk of a tree and protected by a dense covering made from the bark of dead trees some nests being three feet long There are numerous less social species belonging to the genera Apoica Icaria etc which luild uncovered nests of but few cells but those distinctly hexagonal tliese form a connect ing link between the populous nests we have just described and the solitary mud cells of the Oduerus and Kumenes Turning now to the bees we find an attempt at sociability in the nests of the Aiulrana viciiia a common bee in the northern states which ma best be described by saying that it is of the size and general appearance of the hone bee Mr Emerton has observed its habits quite closely and made the accompanying drawing of its cells The nest may be 23 344 L Fig 2 detected by its resemblance to an ants nest as the bee in burrowing throws up a small hillock of sand First she burrows straight down for two or three inches and then turn ing off a little forms a cell as at a Fig 255 where she deposits a mass of pollen as large as a pea and lays an egg upon it By the time this has hatched and the larva has passed into its pupal sleep as at a several other cells have been excavated the lowest one of course being the most recent In the figure the low est cell contains only the freshly laid pollen cell at e an egg is represented as laid by the bee on the upper surface of the mass while the partly grown larva is repre sented at I lying on its side devouring the pollen Avhich has as seen at b been eaten up the grub now being fully grown and ready to pass into the pupa state The little mason bee may be said to be social in some degree She builds her urn shaped earthen cells of clay or fine mud in tunnels or holes sometimes in empty snail shells The little green Osmia sim illima our commonest species of mason bee sometimes places four or five of her clay cells in deserted galls as in Fig 256 24 Audiena vicma packaijd the social life of ensects 345 The leaf cutter or tailor bee is also partly social in so far that it makes a munber of cells and places them close together in the hollow of the branch or stalk of some pithy plant such as the elder but like the Andrena and mason bee there is no combination of two or more indiviiluals as in the trul social wasps and bees The leafcutter bee some times builds as many as thirty cells arranged end to end Usually however but a few cells are made Fig 257 repre sents three such cells in the stem of an elder stalk I am not aware that there is any other bee which at all Fig 256 Cells of Mason Bee iu a srall approaches the tailor bee in the unique habit of cutting out circles from rose leaves and so adjusting them as to form a cartridge like cylinder Fig 258 represents the bee in the act of cutting out these circles The act is as deliberate and methodical as that of the Attelabus the weevil which so caie fully cuts and rolls up the leaf into a solid carliidgelike mass in which to deposit its eggs It also invariably so far as I am aware selects the rose A single bee in one in stance as observed by Mr F W Putnam cut out at least 25 346 Fig 257 a thousand such leaves with which to construct her cells The cell is filled with pollen and an egg is deposited on the mass before it is finally closed Another species of Megachile M hrevis in Canada ac cording to Mr E B Reed cuts circular pieces from the leaves of the plum tree and also rolls up the leaves of the tree as a covering for its nest Mr W M Davis Jr tells me that he has observed a leaf cutter bee cutting pieces out of the leaves of the sassafras and during his residence in Cordoba South America he found several nests of a Megachile in a bank the cells of which were formed of the 3ellow petals of a species of poppy In India besides certain species of Megachile which build cells of rose leaves one species M proxima cuts the leaves of the Clitoria creeper there are others which form them of mud According to Messrs Home and Smith the MegacliUe Janata builds in different objects within or about houses Both sexes appear to labor The mud is car ried under the head and in part sup ported by the fore legs and these authors believe that when the cla having been first prepared at the water is brought into use it is inspissated with some glutinous substance ejected by the insect It is certainly very carefully kneaded again by many of the claycellbuilders The Megachile disjuncta has the same habits as the Woolly Megachile A large proportion of the wild bees nest in the ground like the Andrena a few bees like the cuckoo live a parasi tic life in the cells of other bees It is not well understood what their young feed on but it seems most probable that 26 CeUs of Leaf Cutter Bee pacivakd the social life of insects 347 Fig 258 they do not attack the larva of their hosts but steal their beebread The bumble or humble bee is truly social and yet in a manner quite its own Besides the males and queens there are a large number of workers but they do not assist in building any cells as the larvae in part make their own cells The habits of the humble bees in this country have been studied with much attention by Mr Putnam He shows b independent observation that the queen which has hiber nated after selecting a site for her nest in an abandoned mousesnest or stump collects a small mass of pollen mixed with honey and in this deposits from seven to fourteen eggs grad ually adding to the pollen mass until the first brood is hatched Now it seems that as soon as the grubs begin to eat they make cavi ties in the mass and when fully grown spin an oval cocoon about them Thus the act of building these oval cells is a purely mechan ical one These grubs are in truth unconscious automata They how ever are in a degree aided by the queen who strengthens the thin walls of the cell by covering them witii a thin layer of wax The cells form an irregular mass but however thickly crowded together always retain tiieir oval form Fig 259 2 showing eggs laid in a pollen mass on one end of a cell It is this fact which leads us to believe that the wasp or honey bee in building its sixsided cells did so in the begiitning from design however instinc tive the act now is and that the are not compelled to do so unconsciously and in obedience to certain laws of me chanics which they are forced to follow The mechanical theory of the formation of the bees cell 27 Leaf Cutter IJee at work 348 HALF HOUKS WITH INSECTS Fig 259 Ccliri of Humble Bee has been most ably advocated by the Rev Samuel Haughton His view is that the hexagonal form of the cell may be accounted for simply b the mechanical pressure of the in sects against each other during the formation of the cell In consequence of the instinct that compels them to work with reference to a plane and of the cylindrical form of the insects body the cells must be hexagonal Now this view would scarcely apply to the hexagonal cells of the Avasps nests at the period when only three cells have been made and a single wasp is the builder nor to the nest of Icaria giMatipennis where six cells are arranged in a single row and attached to a branch by a slender stalk at one end of the row In this instance also there is no crowding together of several indi viduals working simultaneously but a solitary wasp freely building her hexagonal cells without being subject to me chanical constraint If there was not the agency of mind in the operation super added to the reproductive instinct which primarily impels all the insect world to action we should never have had an ad vance beyond the humble bee stage So among the wasps if they had alwa3s solely lived on the principle of each one pro viding for itself if the reproductive and selfish instincts alone held sway we should never have seen wasps building cells in common under a common shelter and working together for the common good of all The whole course of nature tends to establish the fact that in the early history of the sport or variety which gave rise to the species as we now find it some bees more quickwitted than others struck out in new directions took a step in advance of their fellows See the figure in my Guide to the Study of Insects Pi 5 and hit on a plan of building which proved advantageous to the species when Nature stamped her approval of the reform by preserving the species in the condition we now behold When the workers appear they aid in bringing home sup plies of pollen and hone but do not build and in fact the humble bee is not much of an architect In the stingless bees Melipona and Trigona of the trop ics however we have a high degree of architectural skill shown in the construction of their cells The domestic Melipona of Mexico constructs combs of hexagonal cells smaller though like those of the honey bee but they also have large irregular roundish cells an inch in diameter which serve as honey pots According to Fritz Mijller who has observed these bees in southern Brazil the wax is secreted on the upper side of the abdomen instead of the under as in the hive bee The wax is usually darkcolored but sus ceptible of bleaching He also states that while the larvae of the hone bee are fed ly the laborers at first with semi digested food and afterwards with a mixture of pollen and honey and while the cells are closed only where the larva aiC fullgrown the Melione and Trigonre on the con trary fill the cells with semidigested food before the eggs are laid and they shut the cells immediately after the queen has dropped an egg on the food With hivebees the royal cells in which the future queens have to be raised differ in their direction from the other cells this is not the case with Melipona and Trigona where all the cells are vertical Avith their orifices turned upward forming horizontal or rarely spirally ascending combs The colonics of these bees are exceedingly populous the workers being numbered by the thousands Smith says that Mr Stretch who lived at Panama described a hive that he saw occupying the interior of a decaying tree that meas ured six feet in length and the multitude of bees he com pared to a black cloud This colony belonged to a species 29 350 HALF HOURS AVITH INSECTS of Trigona Both this and Melipona are supposed to have more than one queen in a colon The mode of nesting in tiiese bees is very unlike in dif ferent species Many species build in the hollow trunks of trees others in banks some suspend their nests from branches of trees whilst one species constructs its nest of clay it being of large size Gardner It is but a step from the stingless bees to the hive bee and the wild species of which there are at least five The economy of the hive bee is so well known that I shall here only notice some of the habits of the wild species of the East Indies the home of all the species of Apis Wallace says that true honeybees are found in the west ern half of the Archipelago and in the southeast as fir as Timor where however it is possible that they may have been introduced Ajyis dorsafa and A testacea both con struct large combs suspended from the underside of the branches of lofty foresttrees They sting very severely yet the natives ascend the trees and with nearly naked bodies take away the combs protected only by a smoulder ing torch the smoke from which in some degree keeps off the insects The Dyaks of Borneo ascend the trees by driving strong pegs of bamboo into the trunk which they connect with an upright bamboo and thus form a good lad der The people of Timor literally walk up the trees by means of a long piece of creeper put round them and the extremities held in the hand It is a wonderful sight to see a man ascend thus a vertical trunk one hundred feet high and then creep out upon a horizontal branch and coolly brush away the myriads of bees from a comb a yard in diameter and become immediately enveloped in a cloud of anory insects while he cuts off the comb and lets it down to his companions below by a slender cord In this manner many tons of wax are annually collected the immature bees and honey supplying a luxurious feast to the beehunters 30 IACKAKD THE SOCIAL LIFE OF IISECTS 51 How the domestic liivebee builds its cells lias been dis cussed by Mr Darwin in the Origin of Species His theory seems to combine the iurel3 mechanical views of Haughton and Walcrhouse with the view that the bee un consciousl takes advantage of modifications of simple primitive architectural instincts such as many other insects possess If I understand his theory aright it implies that the bee by the very act of taking advantage of the simple instincts must in the nature of the case act as an intelligent agent He thus sums up the leading points in his theory Thus as I believe the most wonderful of all known in stincts that of the hivebee can be explained by natural selection having taken advantage of numerous successive slight modifications of simpler instincts natural selection having by slow degrees more and more perfectly led the bees to sweep equal spheres at a given distance from each other in a double layer and to build up and excavate the wax along the planes of intersection the bees of course no more knowing tliat they swept their spheres at one particular distance from each other than they know what are the several angles of the hexagonal prisms and of the basal rhombic ilates the motive power of the process of natural selection having been the construction of colls of due strength and of the proper size and shape for the larvie this being effected with the greatest possible economy of labor and wax tliat individual swarm which tlms made the best cells with least labor and least waste of honey in the secretion of wax having succeeded best and having trans mitted by inheritance their newly acquired economical in stincts to new swarms which in their turn will have had the best chance of succeeding in the struggle for existence IMr Darwin has noticed the objection to such a theory in the fact that bees have a capacity of laying down under certain circumstances a rongii wall in its proper place be tween two justcommenced cells which is important as it 31 35 l3ears on a fact which seems at first quite subversive of the foregoing theory namely that the cells on the extreme margin of waspscombs are sometimes strictly hexagonal This seems to me as already stated in the Guide to the Study of Insects a fatal objection to any purely mechanical theory and I cannot but regard the method of building in hexagons as demanding in the first bee which built its cells in this fashion as much reasoning power as the beaver exerts in planning its dams and who will affirm after reading Mr Morgans work on the beaver that this animal is guided purely by a blind instinct or is an unconscious machine  IT is almost invariably the case that those who have closely observed and recorded the habits of animals nenrl always express their surprise at the high degree of intelligence exhibited by them and do not hesitate to state their opinion that animals are provided with some degree of reasoning power while others still more confi dent declare that this intelligence differs only in degree from that of man himself The works of DeGeer Reaumur Huber Bonnet and of later eminent observers of the habits of insects express the view that they exhibit more or less of a reasoning power On the other hand there are many generally those who have not personally observed the doings of animals and are biassed by considerations to which it is needless here to allude who are very strong in the faith for it is not with them a matter of observation or experiment that animals act simply by blind instinct that they are machines automata When asked how animals sometimes act in a manner so akin to that of man the only reasoning beino according to their view in existence the answer that they are taught by Divine Power This with them Is the end of the matter except that they seem indignant that any lower animal should for a moment be regarded as in any way allied to themselves as if the intellectual and moral standino of man is at all compromised by allowing that the animals possess intelligence and at periods act as if influenced by reason We have no controversy with those who believe that the instincts of animals have been implanted by the Creator as we are of the same opinion The question simply is 23 1 354 what is the kiiicl of mind possessed by animals have they a slight degree of reasoning power are they in some degree free agents And how did the instincts which all agree they possess originate We shall attempt to answer these ques tions speaking on this occasion simply in behalf of the insects As to the domestic animals the horse dog and others which by association with man have undergone a certain amount of education there are few people exercising their perceptive and reasoning faculties who do not ascribe to these animals a degree of reasoning power which they do not confound with their ordinary instinctive acts Confining our attention to the insects let us in an unprej udiced way examine this matter and ascertain what faculties resembling those of man they possess Our conclusions will have a degree of uncertainty and be based mainly on proba bilit so that there is little occasion for dogmatism Our space is not extended and in laboring to be brief we may seem but not intentionally to be dogmatic Those who observe the ways of insects have noticed their extreme sensitiveness to external impressions that their mo tions are ordinarily rapid and nervous Look at the ichneu mon fly as it alights on a leaf near a caterpillar With what rapid motions it walks and flies about how swiftly its feelers vibrate how briskly it walks up and down surveying its vic tim Look at a mud wasp as it alights near a pool of water to moisten its mouth How nervous are its motions how nimbly it flies and runs about the edge of the water The ant is a busy active dapper little creature a nervous brusque ness pervading its movements How susceptible insects are to the light may be tested on a damp dark night by opening the windows In dart a legion of insects of all sorts each with a different mode of entrance some beetle boldly flying about the room in its blundering noisy flight or a Clisio campa moth enters with a bound and series of somersaults over the table like the entree of a popular clown into the 2 Packaud mental powers OF INSECTS 355 ring of a circus though the latter may have the most self possession of the two In his Observations on Bees and Wasps Sir John Lub bock says that though bees do not come out at night they seem to be much affected by light One evening I lit a small covered lamp to go down to the cellar A bee which was out came to it and flying round and round like a moth followed me the whole of the way there Insects are like most animals extremely sensitive to elec trical phenomena Just before a thunder shower they are particularly restless flying about in great numbers and with out an apparent object The appendages of insects their feelers and their legs must be provided with exquisitely sen sitive organs to enable them to receive impressions from without Everybod knows that insects have acute powers of sight That they also hear acutely is a matter of frequent observa tion Often in walking through dry bushes the noise of ones feet in crushing through the undergrowth starts up hosts of moths disturbed in their noonday repose If insects did not hear acutely why should the Cicada have such a shrill cry For whose ears is the song of the cricket designed unless for those of some other cricket All the songs the cries and hum of insect life have their purpose in nature and are use less unless they warn off or attract some other insect We know with a good degree of certainty that some insects have an acute sense of smell The carrion beetles scent their booty afar off the ants the moths all the insects attracted to flowers b the smell of the honc in them evi dently have well developed organs of smell Insects evidently have like man perceptive faculties Let us now examine the organs of sense and the nervous system of insects and thus approach the subject of the instinctive and reasoning powers of these animals from the side of anatomy and physiology 356 HALF IlOUPtS WITH IXSECTS Fig 260 copied from a drawing by Prof Leidy repre sents the nervous system of a neuropterous insect the Coiy dalus figured on page 151 The central nervous system is a double cord enlarged at intervals forming nerve centres or ganglia of which there are sometimes thirteen pairs A Fig 260 Russian anatomist OfTsianni koff has found that the gan glion of a spiny lobster Pali mirus is composed of nucle ated cells from which arise ver long fibres which are gath ered into bundles forming the nerves ramifying tluoughout the bod There is thus a direct physical communication telegrnphic Avires as it were loading from all parts of the body to these nervecentres Of these there are two pairs lodgctl in the head the most anterior those situated in the top of the head are the larger and are for convenience called the biain but it will be seen that though thc are a little larger they do not differ from the other pairs of nerve cen tres From this socalled brain are distributed nerves to the Nervous System of Corydaius antenuffi the palpi and jaws a large thick nerve sent to the eye is the optic nerve a From the other nervecentres filaments are thrown out to the wings legs muscles and vessels in the body We shall see that these centres are really so many brains and that insects differ in this respect from the vertebrate animals in 4 Packakd mental powers OF IXSECTS 357 which there is a true brain or mass of ganglia lodged in the skull or brainbox though it may be added that the spinal cord is in a degree a nervous centre in itself The large e3es of insects are made up of a great number of simple eyes the optic fibres from each one of these simple ecs indicated externally by facets uniting to form a com mon nerve connecting with the brain How large may be sometimes the number of simple eyes united to form this composite eye is seen in a certain butterfly which has 17355 of them The eye of the dragon fly consists of 12544 while the eye of the common house fly has 4000 fiicets or cornese In these insects the composite eyes are exceed ingly large sometimes as in the house fly or dragon fl forming the greater part of the bulk of the head Tliere is every reason from the complicated structure of the eye which we will not here describe and from the movements of these insects to infer that they have acute powers of sight Even certain low insects and the young of the higher ones in which the eyes are rudimentary and single have it is known from experiment the power of distinguishing light from darkness a matter of considerable importance to these insects which mostly move about at night While the eyes in insects are invariably situated on the head this is not the case with a large number of little sense organs which are found in the antennae and the palpi or feelers attached to the accessory jaws maxillae and the under lip labium These minute organs consist of a little cavity covered by a membrane which is supposed to act as a tympanum In connection with the cavity is a nerve which runs to a gang lion When there are a number of these microscopic sense organs placed together the nerves iroceeding from them unite to form a common fibre as in the antennal nerve This sense apparatus is supiosed to be usually auditory in its function as it is in some form or other almost invariably 5 358 HALF HOUKS WITH INSECTS found in the antennae Similar organs also occur at the end of the palpi I have found a similar isolated sac on the under side of both the labial and maxillary palpi of a Perla Fig 99 It is probable that this is an olfactor organ and placed on the under side of the feeler next to the mouth so as to enable the insect to select its proper food by its odor giving an additional sensory function to the palpi of insects which are supposed to be organs of touch In the blow fly there are a number of these organs situ ated at the base of the wings and near tiie spiracles or breathing holes Similar organs are found in the wings of the carrion beetles and are supposed to be olfactory in their function There are also sense organs probably ears on the fore legs of certain species of grasshoppers Sense organs even occur in tiie jointed appendages of the hind body or abdomen Our attention was first called to this fact by the discoverj by Dr Dohrn of sense organs in the jointed appendages of the mole cricket Stimulated by this I examined the long slender jointed feelers of the cockroach and to my great joy found ninetyfive of these little pits on one and one hundred and two on the other It is evident that the crea ture is provided with a double set of antennae one on the head and another on the tail True abdominal antennae seem also to occur on the abdomen of the Mantis I have also found sense organs similar in appearance on the abdominal appendages of a fly Chrysopila and it is not improbable that these organs will be found in similar situations in other insects They are thus scattered at ran dom as it were over the surface of the body No wonder that insects are so alive to impressions from without Without much doubt the nerves distributed to tliese or gans are nerves of special sense and as the ganglia from which they arise may be situated near the end of the abdo men or in the thorax as well as in the head it appears that 6 MENTAL POWERS OP INSECTS 359 this chain of ganglia is really a series of brains so that if insects think at all the process is carried on in the abdomen as well as the trunk or the head This accounts for the fact that when insects are deprived of their head or abdomen they will sometimes continue to live for man hours They still have a few pairs of brains left 80 also when the sand wasp stings the caterpillar or spider in the thorax its whole body is paralyzed Probably the brain proper is never injured as the sting is not known to penetrate the head The hairs of insects found scattered over the body par ticularly those on the feelers and the more exposed parts of the bod are often provided with a nerve and are exceed ingly delicate tactile organs Mr R Beck suggests that spiders are capable of distinguishing sounds to some extent by means of very delicate waving hairs which are found on the upper surfaces of their legs During life they move at their peculiarly cupshaped bases with the least motion of the atmosphere but are immovable after death It is well known that sound is due to vibrations which are generally conveyed by undulations of the air now I am perfectly satisfied that if these undulations are of a certain character the hairs I am alluding to upon the spiders leg will move and I wish you particularl to notice that they are of differ ent lengths so that some might move whilst others would not and also that the longest is at the extremity of the leg and therefore can receive an undulation which miglit die away higher up I may thus mention that there is a group of these peculiar hairs on the flea The legs of a siider are most sensitive organs of feeling if they do not also embrace those of hearing The reader is by this statement reminded of the interesting discovery of Dr Johnson confirmed and extended by Professor A M Mayer regarding the sense of hearing in the mosquito which we have already referred to in a previous chapter 360 We have endeavored to establish the fact that insects are extremely sensitive to impressions made by external objects upon the senses Using the language of the mental philoso phers who divide the human mind into the sensibilities the will and the intellect any one will grant that insects are certainly endowed with sensibilities the first subdivision of the intellect Having perceived an object or received an impression on its organs of smell or hearing such as the odor of deca3ed carrion or of a flower the carrion beetle or bee immediately flies to the object How strong impulses arise from this acuteness of the sense of smell in the carrion beetle is shown by the following fact mentioned by Kirby and Spence A German naturalist Gleditsch relates that he one day spitted a toad on a stick which he fixed upright in the ground A number of burying beetles Necrophoriis ves pillo came around it but as they could do nothing with the toad while in the air they mined under the base of the stick till it fell and then buried toad and stick together Some insects are found in the flowers of plants which have the smell of carrion and frequent no oilier plants Here is certainly a power of choice an act of volition the insect rejects pleasant smelling flowers for bad smelling ones This act involves however not only powers of the will but of the intellect also as the very fact of its making a clioice proves that different odors affect it and that it selects a certain odor in preference to another The flesh fly has been known to be so misled by the odor of bad smelling plants that it has laid its eggs in the flowers of Stapelia hir suta instead of carrion Kirby and Spence If any one should have the hardihood to deny that insects exercise powers of volition that in other words they do not follow the lead of their senses acute as we now know they are let him catch an humble bee between his fingers and see if the creature hesitates to use its sting He will very soon 8 MENTAL POWERS OF INSECTS 3GI realize that the bee has a will of its own and that her will acts with a promptness and decision which at once appeals to the sensibilities of tlie experimenter But bees sometimes attack persons whom they seem to dislike or cluster as it were lovingly about one for whom they have some sort of regard Is not this an act of volition of the exercise of a will added to an operation of the intellect In illustration of this power of discrimination between their friends and enemies I borrow the following anecdote from the Rev J S AVatsons work on the Reasoning Power of Animals It may well be considered an indication of reason in bees that they know as is confidently asserted their master or the person who chiefly attends to them A singular state ment to this effect is given in Stedmans Voyage to Suri nam I was visited at my hut says Mr Stedman whose words I abridge by a neighboring gentleman who had no sooner entered than he leaped out again ioaring like a madman with pain and ran off to the river to plunge his head into the water The cause of his distress was that being a tall fellow he had struck his head against a large nest of wild bees which had built in the thatch I apprehen sive of a similar attack withdrew immediately from the hut and ordered the slaves to demolish the bees nest without delay They were just going to do so when an old negro came up and declared that tlic bees would never sting me personally offering to undeigo any punisliment if one of tliem ever did so Massa said the negro the would have stung you long ago had you been a stranger to them but being your tenant and allowed to liiill upon your premises they know both you and yours and will never hurt eitiier you or them This Mr Stedman found to be the case for even after shaking the nest the bees would sting neither him nor his negroes The same old negro told Mr Stedman that he had lived on an estate on which there was 9 362 a large tree in which there had been as long as he could remember a society of birds and another of bees living together in the greatest amity for if an strange birds molested the bees the birds on the spot drove them off in a body and if strange bees came near the birds nests the native bees attacked them and stung them to death The family of the owner he said had so much regard for the harmonious colonies that they considered the tree sacred Aside from mere physical stimulation such as the recep tion and appreciation of sounds smells and changes from light to darkness to which nearly all insects are subject close observers have told us that insects sometimes give every appearance of being subject to the passions Tiiey not only have strong reproductive instincts but undoubtedly a hungry tiger beetle is a very cross creature a maddened ant is a terror to a barefoot boy who treads carelessly on its hill and a terrified or angry humble bee buzzes with an intensit that proves that it has suffered a considerable shock to its feelings That bees do become angry is indicated by a different pitch to their hum Landois calculating the rapidit of the vibrations by the sound produced thereby states that the fly which produces the sound of F vibrates its wings 352 times a second and the bee which makes the sound of A 440 times a second On the contrary a tired bee hums on E and therefore vibrates its wing only 330 times in a second This difference is probably involuntary but the change of tone is evidently under the command of the will and thus offers another point of similarity to a true voice A bee in the puisuit of honey hums continually and contentedly on A but if it is excited or angry it pro duces a very different note Thus then the sounds of in sects do not merel serve to bring the sexes together they are not merely love songs but also serve like au true lan guage to express the feelings Sir John Lubbocks address 10 rACKARu MENTAL POWERS OF INSECTS 3G3 before the London Entomological Society 1868 But be sides all this we know that ants engage in sports that they wrestle and toss each other about in a playful wa as evi dently so as that young dogs or cats play with one another Insects of all animals must experience pleasure or pain in accordance with extremes of cold or heat They play only when stimulated by the rays of a hot sun Bees as Lubbock observes have a variable temper Generally they allowed me to handle them without an sign of irritation while at other times without an reason which I could discover the stung me sometimes several times in a day they seemed the more prone to do so the hotter the weather If it were not for their sensitiveness to pleasure and pain the instinct of selfpreservation so powerful with animals and which would cease to operate unless their willforce was strongly developed would cease to be exerted Kants expression Pleasure is the feeling of the furtherance pain of the hindrance of life applies to insects as well as men Tiie fact that insects must at times enjoy a warm sunny day that they have what we call animal spirits is a proof that they have not only feelings and will but possess intelligence and possibly in a slight degree self consciousness Having seen that insects have acute sensibilities that they see hear smell and feel witli sudicient acutcness to enable them to maintain their existence we have the foundations laid b wliich their will may operate That insects have a certain amount of willforce that they can act with energ and decision when their feelings are shocked that when pleasurable sensations arise they indulge those emotions for a longer or shorter time seems to be susceptible of proof Now granted that insects have sensibilities and will how Quoted by Mr 5ain in liis INIinil and ISody Aiipletond lutcrnational Sei entiflc Series are we to prove that they have an intellect Simply by observing whether they make a choice between two acts On entering a closet ants unhesitatingly direct their steps to the sugar bowl in preference to the flour barrel one sand wasp prefers beetle grubs to caterpillars to store up as food for her young In short insects exercise discrimination and this is the simplest of intellectual acts They try this or that method of attaining an object In fact an insects life is filled out with a round of trials and failures That they have the quality of perseverance in a high degree is proved ly the statements of many observers In building her nest how many unsuccessful attempts the spider often makes before she finally succeeds in properly fastening her threads the frame work of her web Robert Bruce is said to have admired the perseverance of a spider after repeated failures indeed the persevering labors of the ant ihe bee or the fly are matters of daily observation As an illustration of the perseverance shown by ants combined with the faculty of the communication of ideas which they possess to such a high degree is the experiment performed by Mr Jesse I have often put he says a small green caterpillar near an ants nest jou may see it immediately seized by one of the ants who after several ineffectual efforts to drag it to its nest will quit it and go up to another ant and they Avill appear to hold a conversa tion togctlicr by means of their antennne after which they will return together to the caterpillar and bj their united efforts drag it where they wish to deposit it Another fact in illustration of the same qualities is af forded by Kirby and Spence A German artist a man of strict veracity states that in his journey through Italy he was an eyewitness to the following occurrence He ob served a species of Scarabaeus Atetichus pilularius busily engaged in making for the reception of its egg a pellet of dung which when finished it rolled to the summit of a small hillock and repeatedly suffered to tumble down its side ap parently for the sake of consolidating it by the earth which each time adhered to it During this process the pellet un luckily fell into an adjoining hole out of which all the efforts of the beetle to extricate it were in vain After several in effectual trials the insect repaired to an adjoining heap of dung and soon returned with three of his companions All four now applied their united strength to the pellet and at length succeeded in pushing it out which being done the three assistant beetles left the spot and returned to their own quarters That the bee makes a choice is seen in the perforation of a flower when she cannot or will not reach the nectary by walking into the corolla The case observed by Mr Bailey already referred to on page 202 is in point lie observed humble bees which were baffled in their attempts to find the hone take a short cut and perforate the corolla with their jaws Here is an act of the will carried on under the stim ulation of the organs of smell Now as regards the act of choosing between two alternatives some bees are more intel lectual than otliers and the fact that there is a decided dif ference between two bees in this respect is additional proof that they have a reason In an article on the fertilization of various flowers by in sects in the Popular Science Review Dr Ogle refers to tliis well known habit of both humble and hive bees of either perforating the flowers of the bean or getting at the honey by entering the mouth of the corolla He noticed that while some bees visit the blossom in the natural way and in so doing take pollen from the anthers of one flower to the stigma of the next others avail themselves of the shorter cut but tliat an individual bee visiting a succession of boan flowers uniformly does one or the other It would thus appear that the habit is not an instinct belonging by inheri tance to the whole species but is in each case the result of 13 366 individual experience As with tlie same experience some bees liave acquired tlie habit and otliers liave not we must admit not only that these insects are intelligent but that they differ from each other in their degrees of intelligence some being slow in acquiring knowledge others quiclver The scarlet runner when the bloom is covered with gauze to keep off insects is wholly sterile and so indeed habitually are a good many of the uncovered blossoms The latter is probably owing to the observed fact that most bees have learned to get at the nectary by nipping the tube Were all bees equally clever there would be an end of scarlet runners unless indeed either nature or artifice were to induce some modification of structure by which the tube might be pro tected and the bees again driven to the mouth The following instances are taken from Kiiby and Spence and are we believe the earliest cases of this habit on record M P Huber in his valuable paper in the sixth volume of the Linnean Transactions states that he has seen large humble bees when unable from the size of their head and thorax to reach the bottom of the long tubes of the flowers of beans go directly to the calyx pierce it as well as the tube with the exterior horny parts of their proboscis and then insert their proboscis itself into the orifice and extract the honey They thus flew from flower to flower piercing the tubes from without and sucking the nectar while smaller humble bees or those with a longer proboscis entered in at the top of the corolla Now from this statement it seems evident that the larger bees did not pierce the bottoms of the flowers until they had ascertained by trial that they could not reach the nectar from the top but that having once as certained by experience that the flowers of beans are too straight to admit them they then without further attempts in the ordinary way pierced the bottoms of all the flowers which they wished to rifle of their sweets M Aubert du PetitThouars observed that humble bees and the carpenter bee Xylocopa violacea gained access in a similar manner to the nectar of Antirrhinum Linaria and majus and Mirah ilis tTcdappa as do the common bees of the Isle of France to that of Canna nidica and I have myself more than once noticed holes at the base of the long nectaries of Aquilegia vulgaris which I attribute to the same agency Another instance of change of habit by the individuals of a species is afforded in the same work we quote the fol lowing statement from Sturm It is the instinct of Geo trupes verncdis to roll up pellets of dung in each of which it deposits one of its eggs and in places where it meets with cow or horsedung onl it is constantly under the necessity of having recourse to this process But in dis tricts where sheep are kept this beetle wisel saves its labor and ingeniously avails itself of the pellet shaped balls ready made to its hands wdiicb the excrement of these animals supplies Another instance where choice is made between two alter natives is stated by Mr Darwin In liis Origin of Species he gives the following account One of the strongest instances of an animal apparently performing an action for the sole good of another with which I am acquainted is that of aphides voluntarily yielding as was first observed by Iluber their sweet excretion to ants that they do so voluntarily the following facts show I removed all the ants from a group of about a dozen aphides on a dockplant and prevented their attendance during several hours After this interval I felt sure that the aihides would want to excrete I watched them for some time through a lens but not one excreted I then tickled and stroked them with a hair in the same manner as well as I could as the ants do with their antennae but not one excreted Afterwards I allowed an ant to visit them and it immediately seemed by its eager way of running about to be well aware what a rich Hock it had discovered it then began to play with its antenniu on 15 368 the abdomen first of one aphis and then of another and each as soon as it felt the antennae immediately lifted up its abdomen and excreted a limpid drop of sweet juice which was eagerly devoured by the ant Even the quite joung aphides behaved in this manner showing that the action was instinctive and not the result of experience It is certain from the observations of Huber that the aphides show no dislike to the ants if the latter be not present they are at last compelled to eject their excretion But as the excre tion is extremely viscid it is no doubt a convenience to the aphides to have it removed therefore probably they do not excrete solely for the good of the ants Although there is no evidence that any animal performs an action for the exclusive good of another species yet each tries to take advantage of the instincts of others as each takes advan tage of the weaker bodily structure of other species That there is much difference among individual ants Dr Lincecum has affirmed in his article on the Agricultural Ant in the eighth volume of the American Naturalist I have recently discovered he sas a great difference in their mental operations and capacities Individuals there are which possess great intellectual superiority to the com mon laboring classes which is manifested in the fact that they assume the leadership in all their important public works and army movements Some are much more saga cious and cautious in avoiding traps and dangerous contri vances set for them by the scarcely superior human genus One of our Germans invented a very destructive ant trap It is set over the entrance to their city and is so contrived that going or coming it is sure to entrap them but not all of them Occasionally a well formed fellow is observed to arrive at the top of the precipice where he stops and gravely and cautiously suiveys the awful abyss below filled with frantic and terribly distressed thousands who have incau tiously precipitated themselves into inevitable ruin and after viewing the dreadful and disastrous condition of liis fellow laborers he seems to understand the true nature of the mis fortune and turning from tlie irremediable calamity hastens down tiie inclined plane into the grass weeds le3ond the reach of further observation Quite a number of them were seen to examine and hastily fly from tlic entrance of this destructive trap That this story is not overdrawn is proved ly a similar experience of Mr J D Hague of San Francisco related in Nature April 10 1873 Being annoyed ly thirty or forty ants on a shelf he killed some and maimed others The effect of this was immediate and unexpected As soon as tliose ants that were approaching arrived near to where their fellows lay dead and suffering they turned and fled with all possible haste In half an liour the wall alove the mantelshelf was cleared of ants During the space of an hour or two the colony from below continued to ascend until reaching the lower beveled edge of tlie shelf at which point the more timid individuals although unable to see the vase somehow became aware of trouble ami turned about without further investigation while the more daring advanced hesitatingly just to tlie upper edge of the shelf where extending their antennae and stretching their necks they seemed to peep cautiously over the edge until beholding their suffering companions when they too turned and followed the others expressing by their ehavior great excitement and terror An hour or two later the path or trail leading from the lower colony to the vase was almost entirely free from ants I killed one or two ants on their path striking them with ray finger but leaving no visible trace The effect of this was that as soon as an ant ascending towards the shelf reached the spot where one had been killed it gave signs immediately of great disturbance and returned directly at the highest speed possible 24 17 370 A curious and invariable feature of tlieir behaAior was that wlieu such an ant returning in fright met another ap proaching the two would always communicate but each would pursue its own way the second ant continuing its journey to the spot where the first had turned about and then following that example ¦For several days after this there were no ants visible on the wall either alove or below the shelf Then a few ants from the lower colony began to reappear but instead of visiting the vase which had been the scene of the disaster they avoided it altogether and following the lower front edge of the shelf to the tumbler standing near the middle made their attack upon that I repeated the same experi ment here with precisely the same result Killing or maim ing a few of the ants and leaving their bodies about the base of the tumbler the others on approaching and even before arriving at the upper surface of tlie shelf where their mutilated companions were visible gave signs of intense emotion some running away immediately and others advanc ing to where they could survey the field and then hastening away precipitately Occasionally an ant would advance towards the tumbler until it found itself among the dead and dying then it seemed to lose all selfpossession running hither and thither making wide circuits about the scene of the trouble stopping at times and elevating the antennoe with a movement sug gestive of wringing them in despair and finally taking flight After this another interval of several days passed during which no ants appeared Now three months later the lower colony has been entirely abandoned Occasionally however especially when fiesh and fragrant violets have been placed on the shelf a few prospectors descend from the upper nail hole rarel almost never approaching the vase from which they were first driven away but seeking to satisf their desire at the tumbler To turn back these stragglers tind keep tliem out of sight for a number of das sometimes for a fortniglit it is sufficient to kill one or two ants on the trail whicli they follow descending the wall This I have recently done as high up as I can reach three or four feet above the mantel The moment this spot is reached an ant turns abruptly and makes for home and in a little while there is not an ant visible on the wall Sir John Lubbock who has studied the ways of ants remarks that it is wonderful how much individual ants appear to differ from one another in character Instinct is known in a few cases among insects as well as other animals to be variable This is probably due to their power of discrimination such as the higher animals un doubtedly possess It has been asked sa3s Mr Darwin that if instinct be variable why the ability to use some other material when wax is deficient has not been granted to the bee But he answers what other material could bees use They will work with and use as I have seen wax hardened with vermilion and softened with lard Andrevv Knight observed that his bees instead of laboriously collect ing propolis used a cement of wax and turpentine with which he had covered decorticated trees It has lately been shown that bees instead of searching flowers for their pollen will gladly use a ver different substance namely oatmeal These instances seem to show that insects take the most advantageous means offered to them by nature for the ac complishment of their ends that the individuall exercise a choice and that instinct varies in different individuals of a species Within an exceedingly limited range insects exer cise choice and are free agents They adapt themselves to new circumstances and while there is perhaps little or no progress in the minds of individual animals they somehow as a class keep pace with a changing progressive world No one will deny that creation has not been tending up wards that higher forms of animal life have not on the 19 372 HALF HOURS WITH rNTSECTS whole succeeded the lower How could this have been brought afbout unless animals were provided with a variable instinct Indeed those who deny animals reason admit as an alternative that instinct is not always invariable But how can instincts vary unless insects have in a slight degree the power of discrimination Mr George H Lewes in an article on Instinct in Na ture April 10 1873 has well summed up this subject of choice or discrimination in the following words To con clude when there is no alternative open to an action it is impulsive where there is or originally was an alternative the action is instinctive where there are alternatives which may still determine the action and the choice is free we call the action intelligent It follows that if insects do choose between two courses of action they have the power of perceiving the likeness between two objects For example a white butterfly has been seen to suddenly change its course and fly down to a piece of white paper It perceives a similarity between the paper and one of its own species or perhaps to a cruciferous flower on the leaves of which it lajs its eggs If it were not for this principle how could insects recognize others of their own species It is obvious that insects have this prin ciple of similarity strongl developed Were it not for this mental quality the species would die out By means of this power the bee recognizes its companions and also by this power of identification or recognition it finds its hive after leaving it out of sight for a long time It is well known that bees and other insects may be lost When they first begin to fly from the hive they go but a little distance and act as though fixing the landmarks in their mind Making longer flights they familiarize themselves with the ground over which they fly until to those who have not known how this power of finding their way home has been attained the act seems purely instinctive and not one of individual odueation Whether this is not the basis of the viigratonj sense as we may call it of birds is worth inquiry As an illustration of this power of recognition in the crabs tlie next class below insects the following statement of Mr Robert Fox of Falmouth England is contributed by Mr P W Cox to Nature April 3 1873 The fisher men of Falmouth catch their crabs off the Lizard rocks and thoy are brought into the harbour at Falmouth alive and impounded in a box for sale and the shells are branded with marks by which eevy man knows his own fish The place where the box is sunk is four miles from the entrance to the harbour and tliat is above seven miles from the place where they are caught One of these boxes was broken the branded crabs escaped and two or three days afterwards tlie were again caught by the fislierman at the Lizard rocks They had been carried to Falmouth in a boat To regain their home they had first to find their waj to the mouth of the harbour and when there how did they know whether to steer to the right or to the left and to travel seven miles to their native rocks But bees could not find their way home from a distance of several miles unless they possess memory the third divi sion of the intellect Unless insects possess memorj which consists in storing up in the mind possibly through some change in the struc ture of the nervous system the results of external impres sions we are at a loss to conceive how they can discriminate or perceive the points of resemblance between two objects aficr having been out of sight of them for a greater or less length of time We arc therefore a priori led to suppose that all insects have memor Bain defines memor acqui sition or retention as being the power of continuing in the mind impressions that arc no longer stimulated by the same agent and of recalling them afterwards by purely mental forces This definition will hold in insect as well as human 21 374 L psychology How a bee can return to its hive from afar unless it remembers the way back we cannot understand It does not explain the fact to say that it is instinctive or due to some impulse The impulse is present but it simply urges the insect to start on tlie road memory aided by dis crimination and the sense of similarity show the bee how to perform the journey and select its own hive from among the others near it We may with Kirby and Spence not believe that the bee is guided liome by varied scents but in llogers fine lines can exclaim Who guides the patient pilgrim to her cell Who bids her soul with conscious triumph swell With conscious truth retrace the mazy clue Of varied scents that charmd her as she flew Hail Memory hail I tliy universal reign Guards the least link of IJeings glorious chain No automaton could find its way back to a point from which it had once started however well the machine had been originally wound uj Nor does the common notion of an inflexible instinct meet the case Memory is often due to a repetition of certain experiences and experiences lay the foundation for instinctive acts it is the sum of these inherited experiences which make up the total which passes under the name of instinct That bees previous to flying away for long distances ob serve closely the surrounding objects wliich serve as land marks or guideposts seems proved by the statement of Huber that if a hive be removed out of its ordinary posi tion the first da after this removal the bees do not fly to a distance without having visited all the neighboring objects The queen does the same when flying into tlie air for fecun dation Does not the bee act in the same manner as we would do on leaving for the first time a hotel in a strange city We mentally construct a topographical map as we walk away from the house in order to readily find our way 22 MENTAL POWERS OF ENSECTS 375 back Are not the mental processes the same in kind how ever different in degree But sa3s our author from wliom we have borrowed the suggestions just made the most striking fact evincing tlie memor of these last mentioned insects has been commu nicated to me by my intelligent friend Mr William SticI ne of Ridgcmont Ilolderness About twenty years ago a swarm from one of this gentlemans hives took possession of an opening beneath the tiles of his house Avhence after remaining a few hours they were dislodged and hived For many subsequent years when the hives descended from this stock were about to swarm a considerable party of scouts were observed for a few days before to be reconnoitring about the old hole under the tiles and Mr Stickney is per suaded that if suffered they would have established them selves there He is certain that for eight 3ears successively the descendants of the very stock that first took possession of the hole frequented it as above stated and not those of any other swarms having constantly noticed them and as certained that they were bees from the original hive by powdering them while about the tiles with yellow ochre and watching their return And even at the present tiuie there are still seen every swarming season about the tiles bees which Mr Stickney has no doubt are descendants from the original stock Had Dr Darwin been acquainted with this fact ho would have adduced it as proving that insects can convey traditionary information from one generation to another and at the first glance tlie circumstance of the descendants of the same stock retaining a knowledge of tlie same fact for twenty years during which period there must have been as many generations of bees would seem to warrant the iufer ence But as it is more prolable that the party of survey Dr Erasmus Darwin Uie graiulfatlier of the author of tlic Origiu of Species 23 376 ing scouts of the first generation was the next year accom panied by others of a second who in like manner conducted their brethren of the tliird and these last again others of the fourth generation and so on I draw no other conclu sion from it than that bees are endowed with memory which I think it proves most satisfactorily The daily acts of a bee are quite complicated if we take into account all the journeys it makes the pollen and honey it collects the complicated process of loading itself with the mass which it collects with its tongue rearranges by means of its jaws transfers from the fore to the hind feet and piles up on its shallow honeybasket Then think of the far more difficult operations that it carries on within the hive How are the impressions gained in its first days flight pre served and not only this but transmitted to its descendants I am now speaking of the queen humble bee or wasp The only theory that seems to account satisfactorily for these acts is the physical theory of some physiologists as Beale that every mental act is accompanied by a change in the cells of the nerve centres This is largely a matter of spec ulation and must be regarded as such Professor Bain has from the facts afforded by Beale been led to make a hypo thetical comparison between as he says these two things our acquisitions on the one hand and the nervous elements of the brain on the other He supposes that with a total of 200000 acquisitions of the assumed types which would certainly include the most retentive and most richlyendowed minds there would be for each nervous grouping 5000 cells and 25000 fibres Now this is hypothesis mere guess work as the author avows but based on anatomical facts Using this hypothesis simply for the purpose of illustration if these figures represent in a rude and meagre way the number of cells and acquisitions in the brain and mind of man how exceedingly small must be the number of cells and acquisitions in a bees brain and mind We know from  anatomical investigations that the number of nerve cells in the small ganglia of the bee must be very small perhaps a few hundreds at the most on this hypothesis the number of acquisitions must be correspondingly small Now there is not the differences between the brains of insects that there is in vertebrate animals There is a great uniformity in the size of the nerve centres of different insects and on ana tomical grounds there would seem to be a reason for assert ing that insects can never progress in intellect much beyond their present status We are only endeavoring to prove that insects have the primary intellectual divisions of the human mind but the chasm that still separates man from the lower animals is vast in its width and depth If we approach the subject fiom the side of anatomy and physiology the method is far less materialistic than that of him who advocates the view that animals are automata and act through instinct alone Having attempted to show that insects have a mind in its threefold divisions of the sensibilities will and intellect and supported in this view by the opinions of the ablest natural ists and philosophers let us look at some secondary mental characteristics resulting from the mutual operation of all these primary deiartments of the mind and which insects seem to have in common with ourselves From some facts previously stated it seems well estab lished that antG and a few other insects have the highly com plicated mental power of communicating their ideas to one another Dr Franklin believed that ants had this power and to put the matter to a test he put a little earthen pot containing some treacle into a closet where a number of ants soon congregated and began to prey on the contents When it was all eaten the Doctor cleared the pot of the ants and putting some fresh treacle into it susiendcd it by a string from a nail in the ceiling By chance a single ant remained in the pot which ate as long as it thought proper  but when it wanted to get away it could not for some time find the means It ran about the outside of the pot in per plexity but at last it found the way up the string to the ceiling along which it ran to the wall and so to the ground It had scarcely been half an hour gone when a numerous swarm of ants came into the closet climbed up the wall to the ceiliug and then descended by the string into the pot There they continued to eat till the treacle was all devoured each taking his departure when he was satisfied and one party running up the string and the other down Wat sons Reasoning Power in Animals There are other anecdotes on record more or less founded on observation and experiment which confirm the prevalent idea regarding this complicated mental process Sir John Lubbock has called in question in his Observations on Bees and Wasps the statements made by other observers that bees and wasps have this facult3 He made a number of experiments which in opposition to the statements of Huber and Dujardin seem to show that wasps and bees do not convey to one another information as to food which they may have discovered This does not necessarily oppose the view that these insects may communicate to one another the presence of danger In a later communication to the Linnifian Society of London as reported in Nature but not yet published in full Lubbock has recorded a number of experiments on ants which certainly seemed to show that whatever may be the case with bees ants do possess the power of communicating detailed facts to one another How insects can exist in colonies without this power is a pertinent question That individual insects undergo a process of education seems to be established from the fact that the social bees can be domesticated The honey bee is the only domestic insect we have Besides the AjjIs mellijica the Apis clorsata A inclica and A nigrocincta of India and the Apis fasci 26 MENTAL POWERS OP INSECTS 379 ata of Egypt arc domesticated in those countries and there are two or three other species not domesticated whose lioney and wax are used by the natives of the countries they in habit The Melipona doniestica is said b Iluber to be as its specific name indicates domesticated by the Mexicans Huber in his entertaining paper figures a long cylindrical clay nest which the natives of Tepic keep hanging up in their houses some of these nests are known to be over a century old so that it seems probable that the bees have for several centuries been in a state of domestication Another trait of much interest Avhich seems to result from its social life is that the honey bee ventilates its hive by fanning its wings This may be regarded as a simply in stinctive process but it appears to us an unusual act and one resulting from some degree of ratiocination Many animals are excellent mimics and it is a question whether the faculty of imitation is not very well developed in social insects Indeed were it not for this trait how could ants and bees act with that unanimity of iurpose which distinguishes their insect republics and which is the chief bond of action among them Were it not for this principle the life of the colony and of the species would soon come to an end After having in an imperfect manner gone over some of the obvious mental traits of the insects and which seem to our apprehension to be only properly classified as reasoning processes the question arises whether in performing some of the more unusual feats of mental strength such for example as communicating their ideas to one another they may not have a dim consciousness of what tliey are doing To talk of communicating their ideas without some degree of con sciousness during the act would seem illogical Whether insects are wholly dominated by an unconscious intelligence I leave for others better qualified than myself to judge meanwhile one in view of known psychological facts cannot 27 380 help suspecting that at times even insects know what they are doing while performing extraordinary superinstinctive acts Locke and Dugald Stewart says Brodie in his Mind and Matter do not allow that brute animals have the power of abstraction Now taking it for granted that abstraction can mean nothing more than the power of comparing our conceptions with reference to certain points to the exclusion of others as for example when we consider color without reference to figure or figure without reference to color then I do not see how we can deny the existence of this faculty in other animals any more than in man himself In this sense of the word abstraction is a necessary part of the process of reasoning which Locke defines as being the per ception of the agreement or disagreement of our ideas Brodie then observes that Dugald Stewart does not mean to deny that brute animals are capable of the simpler forms of reasoning Watson says that Locke was not unwilling to allow beasts a portion of reason for though he says they have no power of abstraction or use of language to increase their ideas yet if they are not mere machines we cannot deny them to have some reason and for his own part he adds it seems as evident that they do some of them in certain cases reason as that they have sense Now all that has been said regarding the intelligence of insects serves simply to pave the way for a consideration of the nature of instinct While engaged in collecting the material for this chapter and putting it in form this thought has often recurred if insects have sufficient intelligence to meet the extraordinary emergencies of their lives why may not their every day their socalled instinctive acts requiring a minimum of intellectual work have originated in previous generations and thus the instincts of the present genera tion be the sum total of the inherited mental experiences of former generations Indeed can there be any other rational explanation of that complex of mental processes we call instinct Insects in the first place act from impulse urged on b their appetites thus far they arc unconscious automata These automatic actions are due probably to reflex nervous acts and to the stimulation of their reproductive and other animal appetites upon meeting with the objects of their desires These reflex actions of the nervous ganglia arc essential for the maintenance of the life of the individual and of the species They do not come properly under the head of purely instinctive acts There are a great many acts however to which tlie term instinctive will appl3 As an example to show how many different instinctive acts may be performed by the individuals of a single species I will avail mself of the enumerations made by Kirbyand Spence occasionally condensing his language Beginning then with the formation of the colony By one instinct bees are directed to send out scouts previously to their swarming in search of a suitable abode and by another to rush out of the hive after the queen that leads forth the swarm and follow wherever she bends her course Having taken pos session of their new abode whether of their own selection or prepared for them by the hand of man a third instinct teaches them to cleanse it from all impurities a fourth to collect propolis and with it to stop up every crevice except the entrance a fifth to ventilate the hive for preserving the purit of the air and a sixth to keep a constant guard at the door In constructing the houses and streets of their new cit or the cells and combs there arc probably several distinct instincts exercised but not to leave room for objection I shall regard them as the result of one onl 3ct the opera tions of polishing the interior of the cells and soldering their angles and orifices with propolis which arc sometimes not undertaken for weeks after the cells are built and the 29 382 obscure but still more curious one of Aarnishing them with the 3ellow tinge observable in old combs seem clearly referable to at least two distinct instincts In their outofdoor operations several distinct instincts are concerned By one they are led to extract honey from the nectaries of flowers by another to collect pollen after a process involving very complicated manipulations and requir ing a singular apparatus of brushes and baskets and that must surely be considered a third which so remarkably and beneficially restricts each gathering to the same plant It is clearly a distinct instinct which inspires bees with such a dread of rain that even if a cloud pass before the sun they return to the hive in the greatest haste and that seems to me not less so which teaches them to find their way back to their home after the most distant and intricate wanderings When they have reached the hive another instinct leads them to regurgitate into the extended proboscis of their hungry companions who have been occupied at home a por tion of the honey collected in the fields and another directs them to unload their legs of the masses of pollen and to store it in the cells for future use Several distinct instincts again are called into action in the important business of feeding the young brood One teaches them to swallow pollen not to satisfy the calls of hunger but that it may undergo in their stomach an elabor ation fitting it for the food of the grubs and another to regurgitate it when duly concocted and to administer it to their charge proportioning the supply to the age and condi tion of the recipients a third informs them when the young grubs have attained their full growth and directs them to cover their cells with a waxen lid convex in the male cells but nearly flat in those of the workers and by a fourth as soon as the young bees have burst into day they are im pelled to clean out the deserted tenements and to make them ready for new occupants 30 MENTAL POWEKS OF INSECTS 383 Numerous as arc the instincts I liave already enumerated the list must yet include those connected with that m3steri ous principle which binds the working bees of a hive to their queen the singular imprisonment in which they retain the 3oung queens that are to lead off a swarm until their wings be sufficiently expanded to enable tliem to fl the moment they are at liberty gradually paring away the waxen wall that confines them to their cell to an extreme thinness and only suffering it to be broken down at the precise moment required the attention with which in these circumstances they feed the imprisoned queen by frequently putting honey upon her proboscis protruded from a small orifice in the lid of her cell the watchfulness with which when at the period of swarming more queens than one are required they place a guard over the cells of those undisclosed to preserve them from the jealous fury of their excluded rivals the exquisite calculation with which they invariably release the oldest queens the first from their confinement the singular love of monarchical dominion by which when two queens in other circumstances are produced they are led to impel them to combat until one is destroyed the ardent devotion which binds tliem to the fate and fortunes of the survivor the dis traction which they manifest at her loss and their resolute determination not to accept of any stranger until an interval has elapsed sufficiently long to allow of no chance of the return of the rightful sovereign and to omit a further enumeration the obedience which in the utmost noise and confusion they show to her wellknown hum I have now instanced at least thirty distinct instincts with which every individual of the nurses amongst the work ingbees is endowed and if to the account be added their care to carry from the hive the dead bodies of any of the com munity their pertinacity in their battles in directing their stings at those parts only of the bodies of their adversaries which are penetrable by it their annual autumnal murder 31 384 HALF HOTJKS WITH INSECTS of the drones etc etc it is certain that this nnmber might be very considerably increased perhaps doubled Most though perhaps not all of these acts are as purely instinctive as any one can imagine all bees do them in nearly the same inanner and as readily the moment they leave their cells as a few days or weeks after Such acts may be called automatic though not so much so as the process of walking flying running and biting their pre They may be accomplished by the reflex action of the nerve centres in the insects of the present generation though in the beginning secondarily reflexive As regards the ordinary instinctive acts one may quite agree with Descartes that insects are automata But the matter does not rest here There is a history we beaevc yet to be written in the light of facts which remain to be discov ered by patient observation of the origin of animal instincts and which will tend to prove that instincts ma be regarded in most cases at least as the sum of inlieritcd experiences Lamarck believed that instincts were due to certain inhe rent inclinations arising from habits impressed upon the organs of the animals concerned in producing them INIr Darwin combats Lamarcks view which he calls the well known doctrine of inherited habit as advanced by Lamarck Rev J J Murphy in his Habit and Intelligence leads us to infer that he regards instinct as the sura of inherited habits lie well remarks and this is the sum of the whole matter reason differs from instinct only in being con scious Instinct is unconscious reason and reason is con scious instinct This is tantamount to sajnng that the instinct of the present generation of insects is unconscious automatism but that their ancestors who first learned by experience how to build for example hexagonal cells were taught by reason were conscious intelligent agents and this is where we would leave the subjectCONTENTS

CHAPTER L 



ON BOARD THE " STARTLER." 



The dose of a hot day on board Her Majesty's ship "Startler," 
whose engines kept up a regular pulsation as the screw-propeller 
churned the water astern into golden and orange foam. The 
dappled sky and the rippled sea were a blaze of colour; 
crimson, scarlet, burnished copper, orange chrome, dead, and 
flashing gold, ¡ª all were there, on cloud edge and wave slope, 
mingled with purples, and greens, and blues, as the sun slowly 
descended to his rest. 

There had been a general disposition all day long to lie under 
awnings, and pant "like tired dogs," so Bob Roberts the mid- 
shipman said ; but now officers and men, in the lightest of gar- 
ments, were eagerly looking for the cool evening breeze, and 
leaning over the bulwarks, gazing at the wondrous sunset sky 
and gorgeous sea. 

The deck of the clean, smart-looking vessel had a very pic- 
turesque aspect, dotted as it was with groups of officers and 
men ; for in addition to the crew, the " Startler " carried four 
companies of Her Majesty's ¡ª th foot, the escort of the British 
Resident and his suite, bound for Campong AUee, the chief town 
of Rajah Hamet, on the Parang River, west coast of the Malay 
peninsula. 

The Resident was to be the help and adviser of the Moham- 
medan potentate, who had souglu the protection of the British 
Government ; and to fix him in his position, and save him from 
the assaults of the various inimical petty rajahs around, the cor- 
vette was to lie for some months in the river, and the residency 




was to be turned into a fort, garrisoned by the troops under 
Major Sandars. 

Bob Roberts, a fair, good-looking, curly-headed lad of sixteen, 
was standing with his back leaned against the bulwarks, his cap 
thrust back, and his hands deep in his pockets, staring defiantly 
across the deck at a lad of about a year or so older, who, as he 
stood very stiff and upright by the cabin ladder, returned the 
stare with interest 

The latter had just buckled on his sword, and, in spite of the 
heat, buttoned up his undress coatee to the chin, ready for the 
short spell of drill which he knew would take place before the 
officers dined ; and after giving the finishing-touch to his gloves, 
he rather ostentatiously raised his sword, then hanging to the 
full length of its slings, and hooked it on to his belt 

" What a jolly shame it is that we should only carry a beggarly 
little dirk," said Bob Roberts to himself, as he tried to look 
sneeringly at the young ensign before him ; for the latter came 
across the deck with rather a swaggering stride, and stood be- 
fore the midshipman. 

" Well, young Jack tar/' he said, with a touch of contempt in 
his tone, 

" Well, young Pipeclay," retorted the middy. " I say, how 
tightly youVe laced your stays to-day. Mind where you go, or 
you'll get some pitch on your lovely unifonn. My word, how 
handsome you look I " 

" I tell you what it is, Master Bob, or Robert Roberts," said 
the young ensign, flushing, " if I did not feel that I was stoop- 
ing by so doing, I should tell you that you were an impudent 
puppy of a boy, and give you a good caning.'* 

" No, no ! please pray don't do that, Mr Ensign Long, or Tom 
Long, or Long Tom, or whatever you call yourself," retorted 
the middy, assuming an aspect of mock terror. " You frighten 
me into fits almost ; and if you did try to cane me you'd split 
that coatee of yours all up the back, or break your staylace, or 
do yourself some mischief, and ¡ª " 

Just then there was the sound of a bugle, followed by the 
tramp of feet ; and the young officer, scowling fiercely, turned 
half-right, and as he did so let his sword down, so that the end 
of the scabbard might clatter against the white deck as he 
marched ofif" to where the men were assembling, while the middy 
burst into a hearty laugh. 

** You two gents is alius a quarrelling," growled a wonderfully 
copper-faced old sailor, giving his lower jaw a twist " Yoa puts 
me in mind of the gamecocks as the Malay niggers we're going 





amongst keeps, to strut up and shake out their hackles afor? 
they has a set to." 

" Well, he is so cocky, Dick," said the middy, " and struts 
about, and ¡ª " 

" That's what I say, sir," said the old sailor, leaning his arms 
on the bulwark, "just like a gamecock" 

"And assumes such an air of superiority," continued the 
middy. 

"Just like you do, sir, to'rds us common sailors," said the man, 
chuckling. 

" Don't you tell lies, Dick," said the lad sharply. " I always 
treat the sailors as an officer and a gentleman should." 

" So you do, sir, so you do ! and it was only my gammon. 
But you do wish you was a swaddy now, and wore a red coat in- 
stead of a blue." 

" No I don't, Dick," said the lad colouring ; " but I do think 
we naval officers ought to wear swords, the same as those boy- 
soldiers." 

" So you ought, sir ; " said the sailor, winking to himself ; 
*' but never you mind about that, sir. If so be as it comes to a 
brush with the niggers, I'll grind you up a cutlash, with a hedge 
so sharp as you might shave yourself with it. Perhaps you'd 
like me to do it now, sir, if your razor is feeling a bit dull ? " 

" Now, look here, old Dick Dunnage," said the middy ; " that's 
cheek ; and I won't have cheek from you, so I tell you." 

"Cheek, sir," said the old sailor, with assumed innocence. 
" I didn't mean to shave only your cheek, sir, but your chin as 

well." 

" Now that'll do, Dick, I'm not ashamed of having no beard, 
and I'm not ashamed of being a boy, so now then." 

"Course you ain't, sir. There, I didn't mean nothing dis- 
respectful. It was only my fun. This here 'bacca as you give 
me, sir, baint the best I ever had. Lor I how hot them poor 
fellows do look, buttoned and belted up as they is," he con- 
tinued, as the soldiers fell into line. " It's a deal better to be a 
sailor, Master Bob." 

" Ever so much, Dick," said the middy. " How long is it 
since you were out here, Dick ? " 

" How long, sir ? " and the sailor thoughtfully, as he sprinkled 
the sea with a little tobacco juice ; " six year." 

" And have you been more than once, Dick ? " 

" Four times altogether, sir. Let's see : I was at Singapore, 
and at Penang, and Malacky, and up the country at a place they 
called Bang, or Clang, or something or another." 




** And what sort of a country is it, Dick ? " said the boy 

eagerly. 

"Wonderful country; all palm trees and jungles, and full of 
rivers and creeks, where the long row-boats, as they call prahus, 
runs up." 

" Those are the pirates' boats, Dick ? " 

" That's right, sir ; and precious awkward things they are to 
catch. Lord love you I I've been after 'em in cutter and pinnace, 
firing our bow gun among them, and the men pulling like mad 
to get up alongside ; but they generally dodged in and out of 
some of these mangrove creeks till they give us the slip, and 
we had to pull back," 

"Shouldn't I like to be in chase of one of the scoundrelly 
prahus ! " cried the lad, with his eyes flasliing. 

"That you would, sir, I'll lay," said the old sailor; "and 
wouldn't you lay into 'em with that very sharp-edged cutlash I 
touches up for you ! " 

" Now look here, Dick, youVe chaffing," said the lad ; " now 
just drop it." 

" All right, sir," said the man, with* a laugh twinkling at the 
corner of his lips. 

" It is a very fme country though, isn^ it, Dick ? " 

"Wonderful, sir. There's gold, and tin, and copper, and 
precious stones." 

** Did you ever find any, Dick ? " 

"Well no, sir ; but I've known them as has found gold in the 
rivers. The Chinees gets most on it" 

"There now you're chaffing again, Dick," cried the lad. 
" Chinese indeed ! Why we're not going to China." 

"'Course we aint, sir, but the Chinees swarm in the place 
we're going to. I aint chaffing now; this here's all true ¡ª as 
true as that the chaps all wears a dagger sort of a thing with a 
crooked handle, and calls it a crease." 

Yes, I know they all wear the kris," said the lad. 

" Yes, sir, and a plaid kilt, just like a Scotchman." 

"What?" 

"A plaid kilt, like a Scotchman, sir, and they calls it a say 

rong; and the big swell princes has it made of silk, and the 
common folks of cotton." 

" Is this gammon, Dick?" 

" Not a bit on it, sir. They wears that crease stuck in it ; 
and they carries spears ¡ª limbings they calls 'em ¡ª and they can 
throw *em a wonderful way." 

" They poison the kris, don't they, Dick ? " 





" No, sir, I don't think they do," said the sailor. " I asked 
one man out there if they didn't; and he pulls his*n out of its 
sheath, and it was all dingy like, and as sharp as a razor, and 
he says in his barbarous lingo, as a man put into English for 
me, as his knife would kill a man without poison." 

" What sort of wild beasts are there, Dick ? " 

" Tigers, sir." 

" Honour bright, Dick?" 

" Honour bright, sir ; lots on 'em. They feeds 'em on 
Chinees." 

** Feed them on Chinese, Dick ? " 

" Well sir, the tigers help theirselves to the coolies when 
they're at work.*' 

" Anything else, Dick ? " 

*' Lor, bless you ] yes, sir; there's elephants." 

** Are 3-ou sure?" 

"Sure, sir. I've seen 'em, heaps o' times; and rhinosseress, 
and hippypotimies, and foreign birds, and snakes." 

"Are there snakes, Dick?" 

"Are there snakes! He says, are there snakes?" said Dick, 
apostrophizing the sea. "Why the last time as ever I was 
there, they caught a boa- constrictor as was ¡ª " 

" Don't make him too long, Dick,*' said the boy laughing. 

"I won't make him too long," said the sailor solemnly, "Let's 
see, sir ; this here ship's 'bout hundred and fifty foot long." 

"Yes, Dick, but the boa-constrictor was longer than that," 
said the lad, laughing. 

"I won't go to deceive you, Mister Roberts," said Dick, "no 
more than I did when I was learning you how to knot and 
splice. That there boa-constrictor was quite a hundred foot 
long." 

" Get out I " 

"Well, say fifty, sir." 

" No, nor yet fifty, Dick." 

"Well, sir, not to zaggerate about such things, if that there 
sarpent as I see with my own eyes ¡ª " 

"Why you couldn't see it with anybody else's, Dick." 

" No, sir, but I might have seen it wi' a spy glass. This 
there sarpent as I see it lying down stretched out straight was 
a good twenty- five foot." 

"Perhaps that may have been, Dick," said Bob Roberts, 
thoughtfully. 

" Yes, sir, it were all that ; and when it was alive it must 
have been fifty foot at least." 



''Why, Dick?'' 

"Cause they stretches out so, sir, just like wonns in the 
garden at home do.*' 

"Gammon, Dick, Serpents don't stretch." 

" Don't stretch, sir ! Just you wait till you get a thirty-footer 
twissen and twining round you, and see if they don't stretch," 

" All right, Dick ; and when he does, you come and pinch 
his tail, and make him open his mouth ', and when he does that 
you pop in a bit of your nasty tobacco, and he'll leave off, and 
go like a shot." 

The old sailor chuckled, and said something about Mister 
Bob Roberts being a nice boy, while the party in question 
walked aft to see the company of soldiers on deck put through 
half-an~hour*s drill, making a point of staring hard and derisively 
at the young ensign, who saw the lad's looks, grew angry, from 
growing angry became confused, and incurred the captain's anger 
by giving the wrong order to the men, some of whom wxnt right, 
knowing what he ought to have said, while others went wrong, 
and got the company hopelessly confused. 

The result was that Ensign Long, of her Majesty's ¡ª th foot, 
was severely snubbed, just as Mr Linton the resident, and his 
daughter Rachel Linton, were looking on. 

" I wouldn't have cared if they had not been there," said 

Ensign Long to himself; "but if I don't serve that little wretch 
of a middy out for this, my name is not Long." 



CHAPTER II. 



INTRODUCES MORE FRIENDS; WITH A FEW WORDS ON 

THE RIVER PARANG. 

The men were dismissed, and gladly got rid of coatee, rifle, and 
belt, to have a lounge in the cool of the evening ; the dinner 
was ready in the captain's cabin, where lights already appeared ; 
and soon after the tropic night came on, as if with a bound. The 
sky was of a purple black, studded with its myriads of stars, 
which were reflected with dazzling lustre from the smooth sur- 
face of the sea. But not only were the bright star shapes there 
to give splendour to the wave, for as far down as eye could reach 
through the clear water it was peopled with tiny phosphorescent 
atoms, moving slowly here and there, and lighting up the depths 
of the sea with a wonderful effulgence that was glorious to 
behold. 

Under the vessel's prow the divided waters flowed to right 
and left like liquid gold, while where the propeller revolved 
beneath the stem the sea was one lambent blaze of fire, ever 
flashing right away, covered with starry spots that glistened, and 
rose, and fell, on the heaving wave. 

As the evening crept on, the various lights of the ship shone 
out clear and bright, notably that from the binnacle, which was 
like a halo round the face of the sailor at the wheel There was 
a faint glow from the skylights too, and a lantern was hung here 
and there about the quarter-deck, where soon after the officers 
assembled to chat and smoke, while their men in turn enjoyed 
their ease. 

The ship rushed swiftly on its way, having passed Penang 
the previous day; and it was expected that on the next they 
would be at the mouth of the river, a native city upon which 
was to be the home of all for many months, perhaps for years. 

The officers were discussing the character of the rajah, some 
being of opinion that he was a bloodthirsty tyrant and uphoMer 
of slavery, whom the British Government were making a great 




mistake in protecting, while others declared that according to 
their experience the Malays were not the cruel treacherous race 
they had been considered, but that they were noble, proud, and 
thorough gentlemen by nature, and that if they were properly 
treated the life of an Englishman amongst them was perfectly 
safe. 

" Well, gentlemen," said a little fat man, who seemed to do 
nothing but perspire and mop his forehead, " they say the proof 
of the pudding is in the eating. I know one thing, however. 
Parang is a glorious country for botanical specimens," 

" Just the thing for you, doctor," said Mr Linton, the resident 

" But it won't be just the thing for you, gentlemen," said the 
little man, " for as sure as my name's Bolter, if you don't 
strictly follow out my orders some of you will be losing the 
number of your mess." 

" Come, that sounds well," said a quiet-looking man in white 
jacket and trousers ; " we are going to Parang to help to put 
down slavery, and we are to be put into a state of slavery by 
the doctor here." 

"He'll deal gently with you sometimes,** said the grey-haired 
major in command of the troops. *' Never turn a deaf ear to 
his discourses on plants, then you will be indulged." 

"What a nice revenge I could have on you, major!'* said 
the doctor, laughing, and rubbing his hands. " Ha, ha, ha ! and 

I could double your dose." 

" Yes," laughed the major ; " and after all it is the doctor who 
really commands these expeditions." 

" Ah, well," said the little gentleman, " 1*11 do the best I can 
for all of yoiL But don't be rash, my dear boys. You must 
avoid night dews, and too much fruit, and over-exertion.*' 

"There, there, doctor," said the major, laughing; "you 
needn't trouble yourself about the last. I'll undertake to say 
that none of my fellows will over-exert themselves." 

" Unless, sir, they are called upon to fight," said a rather im- 
portant voice. 

** Oh, I beg your pardon, I'm sure, Mr Long,'* said the major 
seriously. ** Of course we shall not study trouble then." 

The officers smiled, and looked from one to the other, greatly 
to Mr Tom Long's annoyance. In fact he felt so much aggrieved 
at the way in which his remark had been received, that he pro- 
ceeded to light a very large cigar before rising to seek another 
part of the deck. 

" If you smoke that big strong cigar you'll be ill, Mr Long," 
said the doctor quietly. 





'* VA cut it in half, Long," said Captain Smithers, "and give 
the other half to young Roberts." 

" I know what I can smoke, sir," replied the youth haughtily. 
"Perhaps you will take one." 

" I 1 No, thanks. They are too strong for me." And with 
what was meant for a very haughty, injured look, Ensign Long 
strode slowly away. 

" Thank you, doctor,*' said Major Sandars. " It's just as well 
to snub that young gentleman sometimes. He*s a fine young 
fellow, and will make a splendid officer ; but really there are 
times when I get wondering whether we have changed places, 
and he is in command." 

" Oh, all boys go through that stage," said the resident quietly. 
" He has just arrived at the hair-brushing, make-yourself-look-nicc 
age, and feels at least eight-and-twenty." 

" When he is only eighteen," said Captain Smithers. 

" He is only seventeen, I believe," said the major, *' and the 
youngest ensign in the service. By the way, Linton, I believe 
Long has formed a desperate attachment for your daughter." 

" Yes, 1 had noticed it," said the resident drily ; " and as 
Ensign Long is seventeen, and my daughter twenty-three, it will 
be a most suitable match. But he has a rival, I see." 

Captain Smithers started slightly as the major exclaimed, ¡ª 

" Who may that be ? " 

" Our dashing young friend, Mr Bob Roberts." 

There was a bit of a scuffle here as the whole party burst into 
a roar of laughter. 

" Oh, I beg your pardon, Roberts," said the resident. " I did 
not know you were there." 

Bob Roberts felt red hot with shame and annoyance, as he 
made a rush and retreated from the group by whom his presence 
had been unperceived. 

" I hope, Linton," said Captain Horton, in command of the 
" Startler," " that my youngster there has not been behaving 
impertinently to Miss Linton." 

*' Not at all," said the resident quietly ; " both Mr Long 
and Mr Roberts have been full of respectful admiration for the 
young lady, who has sufficient common sense to behave to the 
silly young gentlemen as they deserve. It is all connected 
with the hair-brushing stage, and will, I have no doubt, help to 
make them both grow into fine manly young fellows by-and-by." 

"Why, I can see through the mill-stone now," said the doctor, 
laughing. 

" What mill-stone, doctor ? " 

" Why, I have been puzzling myself as to why it was those 




two boys were always squabbling together. I see now ; they're 
as jealous as can ba I say, Mr Linton, you ought not to bring 
such a bone of contention on board as that daughter of yours, 
and her cousin," 

" Seriously, my dear doctor," said the resident, " I do some- 
times feel that I am to blame for bringing those two motherless 
girls out into the jungle ; but Rachel declared that she would 
not be separated from me ; and Miss Sinclair, my sister's child, 
seems more like one of my own, and shared her cousin's feelings." 

** They are two ladies, Linton,'* said the major, " for whom we 
feel the deepest respect ; and, speaking selfishly, I am only too 
glad that my wife has a couple of such charming companions." 

" Yes," said Captain Horton ; " and if 1 had known what I 
know now, I should have let Mrs Horton have her wish, and 
accompany me." 

" Well, gentlemen," said the resident, rather sadly, " I don't 
know, but I have a sort of presentiment that it would have been 
better if we had been without ladies, or soldiers' wives, if you 
come to that ; for I cannot conceal from myself that we are 
bound upon a very risky expedition, one out of which I hope we 
shall all come safely." 

** Oh, we shall be safe enough,'* said the major. 

" Do you think there is really any danger, Mr Linton ? " said 
Captain Smithers, rather hoarsely. 

"Why, you are not afraid, are you, Smithers? Come, you 
must not show the white feather ! " 

" I am not afraid for myself. Major Sandars," said the young 
captain, quietly ; " and I hope I shall never show the white 
feather; but when there are women and children in an expe- 
dition¡ª" 

*' Oh, come, come," said the resident, gaily ; " I am afraid I 
have been croaking. There may be danger ; but when we are 
surrounded by such brave men as the officers and crew of the 
* Startler,' and her Majesty's ¡ª th foot, I see, after all, nothing 
whatever to fear." 

" Fear ? no ! " said Captain Horton. " Why, we could blow 
the whole place to Cape Horn with my guns \ and the Malays 
would never face Sandars' boys, with their bayonets." 

*' Did you notice that sentry, Smithers ? " asked the little 
doctor, in a low voice, of his companion, as the conversation 
now became less general. 

" Sentry ? which one ? " 

" This one," said the doctor. " Don't speak aloud, or hell 
;hear you." 





" Private Gray ? No, I did not notice anythbg. WTiat do 
you mean ? " 

" The light of that lantern shines full on his face, and he made 
a movement that drew my attention when we were talking of 
there being danger." 

" Indeed?" said the captain, 

" Yes ; he was evidently listening to the conversation, and 
I saw him start so that he nearly dropped his piece ; his face 
was quite convulsed, and he turned of a sickly pallor. The 
light was so strong upon him that I could see his lips whiten." 

"Or was it fancy, doctor?" 

" Fancy ? No, my lad, that was no fancy ; and I hope we 
have not many more like him in the regiment." 

" Well, for my part," said Captain Smithers, quietly, " J have 
often wished that my company was composed of Adam Grays." 

"Adam, eh? To be sure; I remember the fellow now. Well, 
he's a poor descendant of the first Adam, for if that fellow is 
not an arrant coward my name isn*t Bolter." 

" Really, doctor, I think you do the man an injustice. He 
is a very superior, well educated fellow; and it has often puzzled 
me how he became a private soldier." 

" Scamp ! " said the doctor, shortly. " Some runaway or 
another. The ranks of the army are made a receptacle for 
blackguards 1 " 

" Hang it, doctor 1" cried the young captain, warmly, " I can- 
not sit here and listen to such heresy. I confess that we do get 
some scoundrels into the army ; but as a rule our privates are 
a thoroughly trustworthy set of fellows, ready to go through 
fire and water for their officers ; and I only wish the country would 
make better provision ioi them when their best days are past" 

'* Ah, that's right enough," said the doctor; " they are all what 
you say, and they do deserve better treatment of their country. 
I mean, ha, ha, ha ! to make teetotallers of them this trip, I*m 
not going to have the men poisoned with that red hot country 
arrack, I can tell them." 

"It is terrible stuff, I believe." 

"Terrible? It's liquid poison, sir! and I don't know that I 
sha'n't try and set up a private brewery of my own, so as to 
supply the poor fellows with a decent glass of beer." 

" Poor fellows ! eh, doctor ? Why, you said just now they 
were a set of scoundrels." 

" Well, well, well ; I didn't mean all. But look at that fellow 
Sim ¡ª there's a pretty rascal for you ! He's always on the sick- 
list, and it's nearly always sham." 





" I'm afraid he is a bit of a black sheep," said Captain Smithers. 

" Inky black, Smithers, inky black. I shall poison that fellow 
some day. But I say, my dear boy, the brewery." 

*' What about it ? " 

" What about it ? Why, it would be splendid. I mean to say 
it is a grand idea. I'll get the major to let rne do it." 

" My dear doctor," said Captain Smithers, laughing, " I'm 
afraid if you did brew some beer, and supply it to the men, 
fancy would go such a long way that they would find medicinal 
qualities in it, and refuse to drink a drop." 

*'Then they would be a set of confoundedly ungrateful 
scoundrels," said the doctor, angrily, "for I should only use 
malt and hops." 

" And never serve it as you did the coffee that day, doctor ? " 

" Well, well, I suppose I must take the credit of that I did 
doctor it a little ; but it was only with an astringent corrective, 
to keep the poor boys from suffering from too much fruit." 

"Poor bo3^s ! eh, doctor? Come, come, you don't think my 
brave lads are a set of scoundrels then ? " 

" I said before, not all ¡ª not all," replied the doctor. 

'' Ah, doctor," said Captain Smithers, " like a good many more 
of us, you say more than you mean sometimes, and I know you 
have the welfare of the men at heart." 

" Not I, my lad, not I. It's all pure selfishness ; I don't care 
a pin about the rascals. All I want is to keep them quite well, 
so that they may not have to come bothering me, when I want 
my time to go botanizing ; that's all." 

" And so we have fewer men on the sick list than any regi- 
ment out here ? " 

" Tut ! tut ! Nonsense I " 

Just then the ladies came up from the principal cabin, and 
began to walk slowly up and down the quarter-deck, evidently 
enjoying the delicious coolness of the night air, and the beauty 
of the sea and sky. 

Captain Smithers sat watching them intently for a time, and 
then, as he happened to turn his head, he caught sight of the 
sentry, Adam Gray, and it struck him that he too was atten- 
tively watching the group of ladies. So convinced did the 
young ofhcer become of this, that he could not refrain from 
watching him. 

Once or twice he thought it was only fancy, but at last he 
felt sure ; and a strange angry sensation sprang up in his 

breast as he saw the sentry's countenance change when the 
ladies passed him. 





" An insolent scoundrel ! " he muttered. " How dare he ? " 

Then, as the ladies took their seats at some distance, he 
began thinking over what the doctor had said, and wondering 
whether this man, in whom he had heretofore taken a great 
deal of interest, was such a coward ; and in spite of his angry- 
feelings, he could only come to the conclusion that the doctor 
was wrong. 

But at the same time what he had heard and seen that even- 
ing had not been without its effect, and he found himself irritable 
and vexed against this man, while his previous good feelings 
seemed to be completely swept away. 

At last he rose impatiently, and strolled towards where the 
ladies were sitting, and joined in the conversation that was going 
on round a bucket of water that the doctor had just had dipped 
from over the side, and which he had displayed, full of biilliantly 
shining points of light, some of which emitted flashes as he 
stirred the water with his hands, or dipped glasses full of it, to 
hold up for the fair passengers to see. 

" All peculiar forms of jelly-fish," he said aloud, as if he were 
delivering a lecture, "and all possessing the power of emitting 
that beautiful phosphorescent light. There you see, ladies, if I 
had a spoon I could skim it off the top of this bucket of water, 
just like so much golden cream, and'pour it into a glass. Very 
wonderful, is it not?" 

" Look, look, doctor 1 " said one of the ladies, pointing to the 
sea, where a series of vivid flashes rapidly followed one another. 

"Yes, my dear, I see," he replied ; " that was some fish dart- 
ing through the water, and disturbing the medusae. If you 
watch you can see the same thing going on all round." 

So glorious was the aspect of the sea that the conversation 
gradually ceased, and all on the quarter deck watched the ever- 
widening hnes of golden water that parted at the stem of the 
corvette and gradually died away, or were mingled with the 
glistening foam churned up by the propeller. 

For the sea seemed to be one blaze of soft lambent light, that 
flashed angrily wherever it was disturbed by the steamer, or the 
startled fish, that dashed away on every side as they swiftly ran 
on towards the land of swamp and jungle, of nipah and betel 
palm, where the rivers were bordered by mangroves, the home of 
the crocodile ; a land where the night's conversation had roused 
up thoughts of its being perhaps the burial-place of many a one 
of the brave hearts throbbing within the timbers of that stout 
ship ¡ª hearts that were to play active parts in the adventurous 
scenes to come. 



CHAPTER IIL 



DOCTOR BOLTER CURES ONE PATIENT, AND IS LEFT WITH 

ANOTHER, 

" Is that Parang, that dim light out yonder, captain?" said the 
major, pointing to what looked like a cloud touching the water. 

*' Oh, no,'* was the reply. " That is part of Sumatra. Our 
destination lies off the other bow, due east from where we are 

lying now." 

It was a glorious morning, and the sun at that early hour had 
not yet attained to its greater power. The ladies were on deck, 
enjoying the morning air; the soldiers were having morning 
parade, and looked clean and smart in their white clothes and 
puggarees. The sailors were giving the last touches to brass 
rails and cabin windows, and were coiling ropes into neat rings ; 
and altogether the deck of the "Startler," with its burnished 
guns, presented a bright and animated spectacle, every one 
seeming to have some business on hand 

There was a little bit bustle about the steerage ladder, where 
four sailors were hauling a sick man up on deck ; and as soon 
as they had him lying in the sunshine upon a mattress, the 
doctor bustled up ¡ª Bob Roberts, seeing Ensign Long at hand, 
going up and looking on, after the two youths had exchanged a 
short distant nod. 

" Well, Sim," said the doctor, briskly, *' how are you this 
morning ? " 

"Very ¡ª very bad, sir," replied the invalid, a big bony-faced 
man, who looked very yellow. 

" Put out your tongue," said the doctor. 

Private Sim put out such an enormously long tongue that Bob 
Roberts gave his trousers a hitch, and made believe to haul it 
forth by the yard, very much to the ensign's digust 

* * That'll do," said the doctor, feeling the patient's pulse, and 
then dropping the hand, " Now what am I to prescribe for 
you, Sim, eh ? You feel a terrible sense of sinking, don't you ? " 





"Yes, sir; terrible." 

" As if you needed strengthening food ? " 

" Yes, sir." 

" And some kind of stimulating drink ¡ª say wine ? " 

" Yes, sir," said the patient, rolling his eyes. " I feel as if a 
little wine would Ao me good." 

" Has the buzzing sensation left your head ? " 

"Very nearly, sir." 

" And you don't feel so much pressure on your chest ? *' 

'* Well, sir, not just now." 

'* Less pain too, under your left shoulder ?'* 

The major walked up just now. 

"Yes, sir; it's not quite so painful." 

" But you slept well ? " 

"Pretty well, sir, for me; I should think I had quite an 
hour's sleep last night." 

" A whole hour, eh ? " 

' Yes, sir." 

"Well, doctor," said the major, "what do you think of your 
patient ? I hope you are better, Sim ? " 

" Thanky kindly, sir," said Private Sim, screwing up a terrible 
face. 

" I was thinking which I ought to prescribe," said the doctor, 
very seriously. "Sim's is a peculiar case. There's pressure 
on the brain, and also congestion of the vascular system of the 
spinal column." 

" Indeed 1 " said the major, 

" Yes, sir," replied the doctor, pursing up his lips, " and I'm 
hesitating between two courses." 

"Try *em both, doctor," said Bob Roberts, laughing with his eyes. 

" Right, youngster," said the doctor, clapping him on the 
shoulder, " I will. We'll have the moist application first, and 
the warm dry application after." 

Private Sim screwed up his face a little tighter. 

" If I might make so bold, sir," he said in a whining voice, 
" I think what you've given me*s done me ever so much good, 
and all I want now is rest." 

" Rest, my man 1 " said the doctor. " Nonsense man ! You 
want the most brisk and active treatment Yours is a sluggish 
system, but we*ll soon put you right. Here, my lads," he 
continued to the sailors, ** bring a stout rope, and lash it round 
his chest. We'll give him four dips overboard for the head 
pressure, and then four dozen on the back to increase the 
circulation." 





" Oh, doctor 1" groaned the man, looking round for sympathy; 
but only to see everyone within hearing on the grin. 

"Don't you be afraid, Sim; 111 soon put you right," said the 
doctor kindly. " I'll make a man of you." 

'* I don't think I could bear it, doctor. I mean I do really 
feel better, sir." 

" Let*s see if you can stand, Sim," said the doctor. 

The man rose groaning, and held on by one of the sailors, 
who, at a word from the doctor, slipped away, and left the 
invalid standing. 

" You are better, decidedly, Sim, You couldn't have done 
that two days ago." 

"No, sir." 

" There, now walk across the deck." 

" If I'm able to walk, sir, shall I have to be dipped ? " 

** Walk away, and go below to vour mess, you idle, shamming 
scoundrel," cried the doctor. 

Private Sim opened his lips to speak, but the look he received 
was too much for him, and he slowly walked off, trying hard 
to appear ill-used, till he reached the companion ladder, down 
which he shuffled to the intense delight of the men. 

There was no land in sight, but the sea was glorious in the 
brilliant sunshine ¡ª so clear and blue that the darting fish could 
be seen far below ; and before long, Bob Roberts had borrowed 
a fishing-line from Dick, the old sailor, baited the hooks, and was 
trailing it behind the vessel, in the hope of catching enough fish 
for a dinner for his mess. 

At first his sport was not very good ; but after a time he 
captured a large glistening fish, evidently, from its silvery skin, 
belonging to the mackerel family ; and this so excited Ensign 
Long, who had been looking on rather contemptuously, that he 
borrowed a line of the boastwain, and was also soon at work fishing. 

The lads had such good sport that the officers looked on 
quite amused, and the ladies under the awning asked from time 
to time to be shown the glistening captives that had been taken. 

Soon after the doctor joined the party, to discourse learnedly 
about the various fishes, which he classified as he pointed out 
their peculiarities, assuring his fair hearers that far more 
beautiful specimens might yet be taken. 

Rachel Linton, a fair, very intelligent looking girl, was much 
interested in the doctor's descriptions, as was also her cousin, 
Mary Sinclair, a dark, handsome, but delicate brunette, of 
nineteen, full of questions, which the doctor took great delight 
in answering. 





Bob Roberts and the young ensign vied one with the other 
in hunying up with their fish, as they were successful, Ensign 
Long looking hopelessly disgusted as he saw the middy catch 
and carry three fish in succession beneath the awning, while he 
could not get a bite. 

Soon, however, his turn came, and with a look of triumph he 
bore a long silvery fish with bars of azure blue across its scaly 
armour, to where the ladies were seated, Bob Roberts biting his 
lips as he heard the exclamations of pleasure uttered by each of 
the cousins in turn, 

" Never mind," he muttered, " I shall have a startler directly, 
see if I don*t," and he fished away, changing his bait, or replac- 
ing it as it was lost in consequence of the rapid motion of the 
steamer through the water ; but all in vain ; not a single fish 
came to his side, while on the other side Ensign Long was hav- 
ing tremendous luck 

Wearied out with trying, the lad sat at last holding his line in 
one hand, but paying no heed to it, for his eyes were directed 
beneath the awning, where all looked dim as compared with the 
sun-glare outside j and here from time to time he saw Long 
enter with some new prize, which the doctor took, and held up 
to the ladies, the more brilliantly coloured being consigned to 
one or the other of a couple of buckets of water, which one of 
the soldiers in undress uniform, whom the middy recognized as 
the sentry of the previous night, kept replenishing with fresh 
water dipped from the sea. 

" He isn't a bad-looking chap," said the young midshipman, as 
he sat on the bulwarks in a very insecure position, " I wish I was 
filling the buckets and holding up the fish for the ladies to see." 

He glanced once at his trailing line, and saw the bait flash in 
the water, then he glanced back at the party beneath the awning. 

** How black Captain Smithers looks," he said- " That soldier 
must have splashed him, or something, for he looks as if he was 
going to have him tried by court-martial. Here I think I shall 
drop it. Hang it all ! if that fellow Long hasn't caught another. 
What did she say ? " he cried, drawing in his breath with a hiss. 
'* * You are ever so much more fortunate than Mr Roberts.' Oh, 
I'd give something to have her say that to me, and ¡ª murder ! 
I've got him this time." 

He made a convulsive grasp at a rope, and just saved himself 
from falling overboard, for a vigorous snatch made by a large 
fish at his bait had been quite sufficient to disturb his equilibrium, 
his activity alone saving him from a terrible ducking, if not firom 
being drowned. 




He recovered himself though, and thought no more of his 
escape in the excitement of finding that he had hooked a heavy- 
ish fish, and which took a good deal of playing ; for just as it 
seemed exhausted, there was a fierce, furious snatch at the line, 
and the captive appeared to have grown heavier. 

" He's almost too heavy to lift out, Dick," he cried to the old 
sailor who came up. 

" Ease him then, sir, and take it easy," said Dick ; " tire him 
quite out, and then haul in quickly." 

Bob Roberts obeyed, and to his intense delight, gradually 
hauled his fish to the surface, where he could not make out what 
it was by its shape, only that it was a blaze of blue, and gold, and 
silver, flashing in the sun. 

*' Hi, doctor ! I've got such a beauty ! " he shouted, dragging 
at the stout line, till with a rush he hoisted his fish on to the 
deck. 

** Well, that's a rum 'un, sir," cried the sailor. " Why it's a 
young sea sarpent." 

" What have you got ? " said the doctor eagerly, as the lad 
hurried excitedly beneath the awning with his prize. 

" I don't know, doctor," said the lad, " But look. Miss 
Linton ¡ª Miss Sinclair, isn't it curious ? " 

The lad's cheeks flushed, and his eyes sparkled with delight, 
as he held up by the line what seemed to be a good-sized fish, 
of five or six pounds' weight, with a very long brilliantly-coloured 
eel twined tightly round and round it, in a perfect spiral, several 
feet in length. 

" Why, you've caught a fish, boy," said the doctor, examining 
the prize through his glasses, " and it has been seized and con- 
stricted by a sea snake. Dear me ! bliss my soul ! that's very 
curious. Look here, Captain Smithers, and ladies. Gray, a 
fresh bucket of water. Most singular thing ! " 

" I thought he got precious heavy all at once, doctor," said 
the lad, looking from one to the other. That chap darted at 
him then," 

" Ye ¡ª es, I suppose so," said the doctor. ** Lovely colouring, 
to be sure ! See how tightly it has constricted the fish, ladies. 
Just like a piece of woodbine round a stick, only the coils are 

more close." 

" It is very beautiful," said Miss Linton, approaching more 
closely, so that she could feast her eyes on the vivid colouring 
of the water snake, which was about ^\e feet in length, but whose 
coils seemed to grow more close as the fish ceased to flap as it 
nas held up by the middy. 




" I'm glad you like it, Miss Linton," he said, darting a tri- 
umphant glance at where Ensign Long was now fishing in vain. 
" He didn't catch two at once," the boy muttered to himself. 

"I wouldn't go too close, Miss Linton," said the doctor, "for 
some of these sea snakes are reputed to be poisonous. Lovely 
thing, isn't it, Smithers ? " 

" Very," said the young captain drily ; " but pray take care, 
Miss Linton." 

" I am not afraid," said the lady, looking up at him with a 
quiet air of confidence, just as Private Gray bore in a fresh 
bucket of limpid sea water, and set it down at her feet. 

*'Now then," said the doctor; "hold still, Roberts." 

"All right, sir; but it's jolly heavy/' said the boy. 

" Then give the line a shake, and the snake will fall into the 
bucket. Or stop; I will." 

But he was too late, for the lad had already given the line a 
quick shake, with the result that the snake uncoiled like light- 
ning, and darted at the nearest object, that object being Miss 
Linton's arm, round which it coiled with the rapidity of the 
thong of a whip round a stick. 

The resident's daughter was brave and strong minded, but as 
she felt the contact of the creature*s cold scales upon her bare 
arm she could not forbear from shrieking aloud ; but even as she 
uttered the cry, the young soldier, Gray, had caught the snake 
round the neck, causing it to loosen its hold, but only to coil 
round his own bare arm, round which it twisted, and twice seized 
the wrist with its little mouth. 

" The snake has bitten me,'' said the young man, hoarsely, as 
he dashed its head rapidly against one of the chairs, and then 
cast it, broken but \\Tithing, upon the white deck. 

All this took but a few moments, and then Private Gray stood, 
gazing with a strange wild longing look at Miss Linton, as the 
doctor exclaimed, ¡ª 

" Quick, Roberts, to my cabin ; the ammonia. Ladies, go 
away, please, quickly." 

He caught the young soldier, and forced him back in one of 
the chairs as he spoke, for already a ghastly pallor was over- 
spreading his countenance. 

" Is it ¡ª is it poisonous, doctor ? " whispered Miss Linton, as 
she darted a horrified look at Gray. 

"Deadly! my dear young lady," he replied hastily. "The 
poor fellow has saved your life. And only last night," he 
thought, " I said he was a coward," 



CHAPTER IV. 

DOCTOR BOLTER RUBS HIS HANDS, AND CAPTAIN SMITHERS 

LOOKS GREEN. 

As soon as Bob Roberts returned with the ammonia, and realized 
what was wrong, he pulled out his pocket-knife, placed his foot 
on the reptile's neck, as it still writhed feebly, and cut off its head. 

He had hardly completed his task though, before he was 
summoned by the doctor to assist him. Here, however, he 
was forestalled by Miss Linton, who, ignoring the request to go, 
had in the most business-like way helped to lower the fainting 
man upon the deck, and supported his head while the stimulant 
was administered. 

" Pray go away, Miss Linton," exclaimed Doctor Bolter then; 
" this is only a task for a trained nurse/' 

"I am a trained nurse,*' said Rachel Linton, quietly; and 
drawing a cushion from a chair, she placed it on the deck, 
lowered the injured man's head upon it, and then, seeing the 
doctor's intention, held the patient's arm while he freely used a 
lancet about the tiny marks made by the serpent's teeth, and 
rubbed in the ammonia. 

Captain Smithers meanwhile had not spoken, but stood watch- 
ing Miss Linton, with a strange look upon his countenance, 
shuddering, though, once or twice, as he saw the ghastly face of 
the injured man, and his fixed half-closed eyes. 

"What can 1 do next, doctor? " said Miss Linton, in a quiet, 
eager voice. 

" Nothing at present, my dear young lady," he said, looking at 

her admiringly. " Why, what a brave-hearted girl you are I " 
" Brave ? " she said. " What, to do this for one who saved me 

perhaps from death ? But tell me, doctor, will he live ? " 

" I don't know ; I hope so ; it is impossible to say. It is such 

a rare thing for a man to be bitten by one of these creatures. I 

never had such a case before, and I ought to have known better ; 

but I did not know it was a dangerous species of snake." 




He held the soldier's pulse as he spoke, and then frowned, and 
mixing more ammonia and water, raised the poor fellow's head, 
and poured the liquid between his half-clenched teeth. 

"Try and swallow it, Gray, my good fellow." 

The young man opened his eyes as if awakened from sleep, 
stared about till they rested on Miss Linton, when they closed 
again, and he drank the stimulant with difficulty. 

"Stand back, please. Captain Smithers keep every one away, 
and let us have all the air we can." 

Thus appealed to, the young officer motioned back those who 
pressed forward, the news of the accident having spread through 
the ship, and all who dared ascending to the quarter-deck. 

'* How provoking 1" exclaimed Major Sandars. *'One of my 
best men too, doctor. Really, Bolter, I must put a slop to your 
natural history researches." 

" Confound it all, major ! " cried the little doctor, angrily ; " it 
was an accident That young dog caught the snake, and ¡ª no ¡ª 
no ! it's all right, Roberts. It was my fault ; I ought to have 
foreseen what would happen." 

Ensign Long had begun to congratulate himself on the fact 
that Bob Roberts was about to have a good wigging, but found 
out that he was wrong, and felt annoyed to see how important a 
part the lad played in the proceedings to fight back the effects of 
the deadly poison. 

" Take my coat off, Roberts," said the doctor. " Gently, boy, 
gently. That's right. Now the ammonia ; good. Raise his 
head a little. Poor fellow, we mustn't let him slip through our 
fingers. That's it. Miss Linton. Miss Sinclair, will you get a 
big fan, and give him all the air you can ? " 

He was obeyed to the letter ; while Captain Horton and the 
resident stood near, ready to help in any way they could, for the 
news had caused the deepest concern throughout the ship. 

" Yah ! " cried Private Sim, with an ugly snarl ; " there's yer 
nasty favouritism. See how they're all a-cuddling and messing 
that there Gray up, orficers and women and alL Might ha' died 
afore they'd ha' done anything for me." 

'*Why, you caulking, miching lubber," growled old Dick, 
" you had ten times as much trouble 'stowed on you as you 
deserved. Tell you what, my lads," he continued, addressing a 
crowd of soldiers and sailors who had been discussing the event 
forward, " it's this here sorter thing as makes me saddersfied to 
be a common sailor. Yer orficers may row and bully yer some- 
times for not being smart enough ; but I never knowed a orficer 
yet as wasn't ready to run the same risks as the men ; and when 



you're down, Lor' bless my *art, nothin's too good for yoiL 
Member the skipper coming and bringing us horindges, Joe 
Tomson, when we had the feckshus fever?" 

" Ay, ay, mate," growled a big sun-tanned sailor. 

" Right you are, mate," said a big sergeant. " It's just so 
with us. IVe knowed our officers run out under fire to bring in 
wounded men, and get shot down theirselves. You remember 
Captain Smithers doing that, out in China, Billy Mustard?" 

" That I do," said a fair red-faced private, with a merry look 
in his eyes. " He brought me in on his back. I'm waiting to 
sec him down some day, and carry him in." 

" To be sure," growled old Dick. " Orficers is orficers, and 
there 'aint one aboard this ship as wouldn't jump overboard to 
save any man, even if it was such a grumbling warmint as old 
Sim here." 

Private Sim snarled, and showed a set of yellow teeth, as he 
held out the palm of his left hand to give it a severe punch with 
his right fist; after which ebullition he seemed to feel much 
better, and went and leaned over the side. 

" I hope Private Gray will get better," said Billy Mustard, who 
was a great favourite with the men from the fact that he was 
famous as a fiddler, and could rattle off anything from " Money 
Musk " up to " The Triumph ; " and as to hornpipes, the ¡ª th 
said there wasn't a man in the service who could touch him. 
Billy Mustard had won the hearts of the sailors, too, during the 
voyage, from the way in which he sang "The Death of Nelson," 
with many another naval ditty, to which the whole forecastle 
could rattle out a hearty chorus. ** I hope Private Gray will 
get better," said Billy. 

"Ah, we all hope that," said Sergeant Lund. "Not that 
Adam Gray's a friend of mine. He's too much of a gentleman ; 
and when he's going through his drill, it always seems as if one 
was putting a young officer through his facings. Not that I wish 
him any harm ; but if he's a gentleman he ought to have got 
his commission, and kept out of the ranks." 

" Well, sergeant," said Billy Mustard, " I don't see that it 
matters much what a man is, so long as he's ready for dooty, and 
I will say as Gray never sticks himself up, but does his dooty 
like a man." 

" Yah 1 he'll turn out no good/' snarled Private Sim, looking 
round. 

" Well, for my part," said old Dick, " if I was to go in for being 
cunnle of a regiment, I should like that there regiment to be all 
private Simses, a?4 then I'd have all the oncers doctors." 




" And a big hospital for barracks," said the sergeant, laughing. 

"And rations of physic served out every day," cried Billy 
Mustard. 

There was a hearty laugh at this ; but it was checked directly, 
as the men recalled that one of their number was lying in grievous 
I)eril; while Private Sim glanced round, uttered a snarl like 
that of a hyaena, then turned back and gave his left hand 
another punch. 

" Laugh at me, will yer ? " he growled, " when I'm so jolly ill. 
Just let me get hold o' that there fiddle o' yours, Master Billy 
Mustard, and I'll smash it, see if I don't." 

He seemed to feel better after this threat, and stood leaning 
over the bulwarks, and spitting down into the sea, while one of 
the sailors went aft to learn some tidings concerning Adam 
Gray. 

Meanwhile, the centre of an anxious knot of observers, the 
young soldier lay breathing very feebly in spite of the stimulants 
frequently administered ; and Bob Roberts, as he knelt close by 
on the deck, watched with a strange feeling of heart-sickness 
coming over him. He could not conceal from himself the 
feet that he had been the cause of all the suffering ; and full of 
self-reproach, he knelt there, considering whether he should 
ever forget that scene, with the pale face of the fine young 
fellow lying before him. 

Gray seemed to be in no great pain, but to be suflfering more 
from a strange delirium caused by the working of the tiny drops 
of poison injected in his veins. He muttered a few words 
occasionally, and started convulsively from time to time ; but 
when spoken to, he calmed down, and lay, apparently, waiting 
for his end. 

" Don't know ; can't say," was all that could be got from the 
doctor, as the hours crept on ¡ª hours when the heat of the sun 
was terrible ; but no one left the injured man's side. 

The specimens in the buckets were forgotten, and died ; the 
cause of the misfortune grew dry and shrivelled, where it had 
twined and wriggled itself, half a dozen yards away, the 
dangerous head being thrown overboard by Bob Roberts, and 
swallowed by a fish before it had descended many feet 

Both the resident and the captain had tried to persuade the 
ladies to leave the sick man's side \ but they had declined to go, 
and Doctor Bolter had nodded approval. 

" Thank you, my dears, thank you,'' he said. " It's very kind 
of you ; and I'm glad enough, I can tell you, to find that you've 
both got something in you besides fine young bdyism." 





" I wish we could do more," said Rachel Linton, quietly. 

" So do I, my dear," said the little doctor ; " and I wish I 
could do more, but I have done all I can. Nature must do the 
rest." 

The long, hot day passed on, and evening was approaching 
before the doctor took anything more than a glass of wine and 
water and a biscuit ; and at last, when every one had judged by 
poor Gray's aspect that all now was over, and Major Sandars 
came up and thanked him for his patient endeavours to save the 
poor fellow's life, the doctor felt his patient*s pulse once more, 
raised the closed eyelids and gazed at the pupils, and then rose 
up, dropped into a cane lounging chair, and began softly rubbing 
his knees. 

" Now, ladies," he said firmly, " go below and dine. I order 
it. Sandars ¡ª Horton ¡ª if you have any good feeling left in you, 
you'll send relays of Jacks and privates to rub my poor knees. 
I say," he said, looking round with a smile, " that was a close 
shave, wasn't it ? " 

** Close shave?" said the major, as the ladies drew back, 
apparently hurt at the doctor's levity ; and poor Bob Roberts, 
kneeling at the injured man's feet, lowered his head so that 
those near should not see the unmanly tears gathering in his 
eyes, though he was somewhat comforted on seeing that Ensigii 
Long was almost as much moved. 

"Yes," said the doctor; "you might have got all the nobs of 
the profession, and I don't believe they could have done 
better." 

" No," said Captain Horton rather coldly. " You have worked 
hard. Doctor Bolter." 

"Hard? I should think I have. I tell you what it is, sir, 
you would not have felt more pleased than I do if you had been 
made an admiral." 

" But the man is dying fast, Bolter," said Major Sandars. 

" Dying, sir? why he has been dying fast all day." 

" Then is not this rather unseemly before ladies ? " said 
Captain Horton. 

"Unseemly? Before ladies?" said the doctor in a puzzled 
way. " Why, can't you see for yourselves ? Ha, ha, ha ! " he 
said, laughing softly. " Don't you see the remedies have beaten 
the poison. There's a delightful sleep he has dropped into." 

" Sleep ? " exclaimed Miss Linton. 

"To be sure, my dear. Look what a lovely perspiration is 
coming out on his forehead. There, come away, and let him 
sleep. Hell be nearly well by to-morrow morning." 





Bob Roberts leaped up from the deck, as if sent by a sling, 
made a dash at Ensign Long, swung him round, indulged in 
a kind of war dance indicative of triumph ; then looked 
extremely ashamed of himself, and dashed off into the gun-room 
to spread the news that the doctor had saved Gray's life. 

''That's not a bad sort of boy," said the doctor, looking after 
Bob ] and then, as Ensign Long raised his chin in the air, and 
looked very dignified, " tell you what Sandars, if I were you I'd 
get Captain Horton to make a swop. Let's give him Tom Long 
in exchange for the middy. What do you say ? " 

Tom Long marched off, looking very much disgusted ; and 
Sergeant Lund having been summoned to bring a file to watch 
by the sick man, the much relieved party went down to dinner. 



CHAPTER V. 



UP THE PARANG RIVER. 

That evening the anchor was dropped off the mouth of the 
Parang river ; and as the night closed in all eyes were directed 
to the thickly-wooded country on each side of the stream, whose 
banks were hidden by the dense growth of mangrove trees, 
which, now that the tide was up, seemed to be growing right out 
of the water, which those on board could see through their 
glasses to be smoothly flowing amidst the stems. 

Further inland tall columnar nipah palms could be seen 
fringing the tidal way, and apparently growing amidst the man- 
groves, with the water washing their roots. 

Dense green vegetation, and a broad flowing muddy river ¡ª 
that was all that greeted the eyes of the eager lookers-on, till 
darkness set in. Not a trace of town or village, not even a 
fisherman's hut or a boat All was vegetation and the flowing 
river. 

Once Bob Roberts thought he saw a boat coming down the 
stream, and in the distance it very strangely resembled some 
little craft with upright mast and dark sail ; but as it came nearer 
it proved to be a patch of root-matted vegetable soil, washed 
from the bank, and having in the centre a small nipah palm, 
which slowly passed from sight, to be cast ashore upon some 
mud bank, and again take root. 

But as the darkness fell, the distant gHtter as of tiny sparks 
amidst the trees took the attention of all. They were too dis- 
tant to see the phenomenon to perfection ; but the faint sparkle 
was very beautiful as the myriads of fire-flies, by which it was 
caused, flitted and changed from place to place, which was now 
dark, now scintillating in a most peculiar manner. 

The captain had decided not to attempt the passage of the 
river till morning, all on board being very ignorant of its entrance, 
though, judging from the configuration of the coast, the most 
they had to dread was being grounded for a time on some bank 




of mud or sand This part of the coast was so sheltered that 
there was no surf ; and when the anchor was let go, the corvette 
swung round easily, to lie almost without motion on the calm 
still waters of the river's mouth. 

But though no sign of human habitation had been visible, as 
the night wore on those on board became fully aware of the fact 
that the jungle had plenty of denizens, for from time to time 
strange roarings were heard, and then splashings in the water, as 
of wild creatures bathing. Once or twice too, as Bob Roberts 
and Ensign Long, companions for the time being, if not friends, 
leaned over the bulwarks, they fancied they could hear some 
great beast swimming towards them. 

" What can it be ? " said Bob in an awe-stricken whisper, as 
the strange snorting and splasliing grew nearer. 

" 'Nosserus,*' said Dick the sailor, who generally contrived to 
be pretty close to the youths, and depended upon them largely 
for his supplies of tobacco. " It's one on 'em having a wallow, 
like a big pig, somewhere in the shallows." 

"That's a tiger, isn't it!" said Tom Long, as a hoarse roar 
came over the smooth surface of the water. 

"Shouldn't wonder, young gentlemen, if it were ; but I'll say 
good night, for 'taint my watch, and I think a turn in won't be 
bad preparation for a hard day to-morrow." 

Everyone expected a busy day upon the morrow ; but it was 
long before the two youths could tear themselves away from the 
side of the vessel, for there was something so mysterious and 
weird in the look of the black water, in which the stars just glim- 
mered ; while right before them all looked dark and strange, 
save where there was the distant twinkling of the fire-flies, ever 
changing in position. 

" Hark ! " whispered Long ; " there's a splash again. That 
can't be close to the shore." 

" No, that's not a hundred yards from the ship. I say, Long," 
whispered Bob with a shudder, " I shouldn't much like to swim 
ashore. I'll be bound to say that was a crocodile." 

" I shouldn't wonder," was the reply ; and they still stood 
trying to make out the cause of the strange splashing noises, till, 
utterly tired out, they sought their cots, and were soon fast 

asleep. 

The getting up of the anchor roused the two lads soon after 
daybreak, by which time steam was up ; and with the faint 
morning mists slowly rising like silver gauze above the dense 
belts of trees, the steamer began slowly to move ahead. 

The tide was flowing, and the mangroves were deep in the 




water, though not so deep but that their curious network oi roots 
could be seen, like a rugged scaffold planted in the mud to sup- 
port each stem ; while as they slowly went on, the dense beds of 
vegetation, in place of being a mile off on either side, grew 
to be a half a mile, and soon after but a hundred yards, as 
the steamer seemed to be going straight into a broad bank 
ahead. 

As they approached, though, a broad opening became visible, 
where the course of the stream swung round to the right ; and 
after passing a point, the river rapidly contracted to about a 
hundred yards in width, and soon after was narrower, but still a 
smoothly flowing stream by the eternal mangroves. At last 
some signs of life began to appear, in the shape of an occasional 
crocodile, which glided off a muddy bank amidst the mangrove 
roots, into the water. Here and there, too, the long snout of 
one of these hideous reptiles could be seen, prone on the surface 
of the water, just above which appeared the eyes, with their pro- 
minences, as the reptile turned its head slowly from side to side, 
in search of some floating object that might prove to be good 
10 r food. 

The sight of these beasts was too much for the officers, who 
were so(5m armed with rifles, making shots at the muddyhued 
creatures, apparently with no other effect than for the long horny 
head to slowly sink beneath the water. 

Captain Smithers proved himself to be the best shot, for after 
splashing the water with a bullet close to the head of one of the 
saurians, his attention was drawn to another, between the steamer 
and the shore, apparently quite unconscious that the vessel could 
injure it in the least. 

Judging from the size of the head, this was apparently the 
largest crocodile that had been seen ; and taking long and care- 
ful aim, Captain Smithers at last fired, when the monster lashed 
the water furiously for a few moments with its tail. 

" He's hit, and badly," said Doctor Bolter. *' It's a big one, 
too. What a splendid specimen it would make ! " 

As he spoke, his w^ords as to the size of the creature were 
verified, for the crocodile suddenly shot itself half out of the 
water, showing its head, shoulders, and a good deal of its horny 
back, before turning over and diving down, displaying its hind 
legs and tail before it disappeared. 

" That was eighteen feet long if it was an inch," said the doctor, 

excitedly ; " but he has gone to the bottom." 

" Yes," said Captain SmiChers, quietly reloading, " we shall 
not see it again. How is your patient, Bolter? *' 





" Oh, pretty' well all right again, thanks. It was a lucky escape 
for the poor fellow." 

" Very ! " said Captain Smithers, thoughtfully, " What bird 
is that, doctor ? " 

" A white eagle," was the reply, as the doctor followed with his 
glasses the flight of a magnificent bird that rose from a stunted 
tree, flew across the river, and away over the mangroves on the 
other side. 

Soon after, as the steamer still made its way onward in mid- 
stream, the river being very deep, as shown by the man busy in 
the chains with the lead, a flame of blue suddenly seemed to 
dart from a mangrove root, and then another and another, as 
some of the gorgeously-coloured kingfishers of the peninsula shot 
off" along the surface up the stream. 

On still, and on, with every one on board eagerly on the look- 
out for novelties, but ail growing somewhat tired of the unbroken 
succession of dull green mangroves. At last, however, after 
many hours of slow and cautious progress, the mangroves gave 
place to tall and beautiful palms, showing evidently that the 
steamer was now beyond the reach of the tide ; and this was 
farther proved by the fact that the stream was now dead against 
them, running pretty swiftly, but, in place of being muddy, 
delightfully clear. 

Faces that had looked long and solemn as the supposition had 
grown stronger that the country was nothing better than a man- 
grove swamp, became more cheery of aspect, especially when, 
through an opening in the dense clumps of palms with their 
feathery tops, the blue line of a distant range of hills could be seen. 

Then came, as they rounded a point, the first trace of human 
habitation, in the shape of a Malay village, which in the distance 
bore a marvellous resemblance, in its steep gabled roofs thatched 
with palm-leaves, to some collection of cottages in far-distant 
England. But soon it was seen that every cottage was raised 
upon posts, that the walls were of woven reed or split bamboo, 
and that the trees that shaded them were cocoa nut and areca 

palms. 

Onward still, but more slowly and cautiously, lest the steamer 
should take the ground. Now and then scattered patches of 
cultivation were seen, in the shape of paddy fields ; clusters of 
fruit-trees stood here and there ; native boats were drawn right 
up on the mud, or secured to posts ; and now and then buffaloes 
could be seen, standing knee-deep in the water, with dark-skinned 
children running to and fro, terribly excited at the sight of the 
strange ship. 





Onward still, hour after hour, past village after village, wonder- 
fully same in appearance, and the river still kept broad and 
deep enough for the navigation of the steamer, till night came 
on, and she was anchored in mid-stream, with the wild jungle 
coming close down to the water's edge on either side. 

At early morn the journey was continued till a broad reach of 
the river was ascended, at the far end of which was a good-sized 
island, in which was a palm-thatched building of some conse- 
quence, while, only separated from it by a narrow arm of the 
river, stood the largest collection of houses they had seen, with 
what was evidently a mosque by the river side. There was an 
abundance of boats too, and what strongly resembled a stockade; 
but what most took up the attention of all on board were a 
couple of long, low, well-made vessels, each displaying a curious 
figure-head bearing a faint resemblance to some fabulous monster; 
and in these armed boats both the soldiers and sailors of the 
little expedition were quite right in believing that they saw' 
nothing more nor less than the much-talked-of vessels of the 
kris-bearing pirates of Malaya, the well-known, much-dreaded 
p rah us. 



CHAPTER VI. 



HOW TOM LONG TRIED THE DURIAN. 

A LITTLE bustle on deck, the rattling of chains, the splash of an 
anchor, and Her Majesty's ship " Startler" ¡ª well manned, and 
armed with guns that could send shot and shell crashing through 
the town on the river's right bank ¡ª swinging to her moorings ; 
for she had reached her destination ¡ª the campong, or village, of 
Sultan Hamet, the native Malay potentate, who was under 
British protection, and who sought our aid to rule his land 
beneficially, after our manners and customs, and who now pro- 
fessed the most ardent friendship for those who were ready to do 
their duty ; though the trust they felt in the Malays was not 
untempered by suspicion ¡ª in some cases, perhaps, with fear. 

It was a very busy time for all, and after the " Startler '* had 
been made what Dick the sailor called snug ¡ª that is to say, 
firmly anchored head to stream, for they were now far above the 
reach of the tide ¡ª a strong party of the blue jackets were landed 
upon the pleasantly umbrageous island, along with the soldiers ; 
for this island was to be the site of the residency, and it proved 
to have four good-sized buildings amidst the trees, which had 
been roughly prepared by Sultan Hamet*s orders. 

Doctor Bolter was almost the first man to land, and for a long 
time he was fussily perspiring about, as he abused the sanitary 
arrangements of the place to every man he met, pausing last of 
all to stand mopping his face in front of Bob Roberts and Tom 
Long. 

" Pretty sort of a wilderness to bring us to, young gentlemen !" 
he exclaimed. " I don't know what to start at next. The place 
will be a very hot-bed of fever, and we shall all be swept away." 

" What do you say to this for a neat spot, doctor ? " said Bob 

Roberts. 

" Neat spot ? what for ? " 
** Burying ground." 

** Burying ground ? What do you mean, sir?*' 




" To bury us all decently, doctor/' said Bob, grinning. '* And 
I say, doctor, who's to bury the last man ? " 

" If you were under my charge, Master Bob Roberts," said the 
doctor, panting with the heat, " I should reduce that vital force 
of yours a little, sir." 

** Thanky, doctor. But I say, doctor, which is to be the resi- 
dent's house ? " 

" That, sir ; and those three buildings are to be turned into 
barracks, and fort, and officers' quarters ; and how I am to get 
them all into a sanitary state, I don't know." 

But the doctor did manage it somehow in the following days, 
when, in spite of the heat, every one worked with a will ; the 
resident's house was improved, and boats were constantly going 
to and from the " Startler," whose hold was something like a 
conjuring trick, as it constantly turned out household necessaries 
and furniture. Handy workmen amidst the soldiers and Jacks 
were busy, fitting, hammering, and nailing ; so that in a very 
short time the resident's house began to grow ship-shape. 

At the same time the officers' quarters were being prepared, 
and the barracks as well \ while plans were made to strengthen 
the fort, dig ditch, form glacis, and generally make the place 
tenable against a possible enemy. 

Plenty of Malays were enlisted to help ; but beyond bringing 
wood, and acting as carriers, they did not prove to be very valu- 
able workers. But all the same, the preparations went on, various 
chiefs coming across in their boats from time to time, watching 
with no little wonder the changes that were being effected, talk- 
ing together a good deal about the stands of arms in the little 
barracks, and the nine-pounder field-pieces that were brought 
ashore from the " Startler's " hold. 

The inexhaustible bottle was nothing to that ship, for no sooner 
did the adjutant make out a list of requisitions, and send in, than 
the hold began to disgorge, and boat-loads of stores came ashore j 
till, in a marvellously short time, the white tents, saving one or 
two large ones, disappeared from where they had been first set 
up amongst the trees, and with a celerity that perfectly astounded 
the Malay visitors, the island assumed an aspect that seemed to 
say the English visitors meant to stay. 

Meanwhile, the country people grew less shy, and boats came 
with fruit and rice for sale, one of the first being visited by Bob 
Roberts ¡ª Tom Long, who had evidently meant to be there before 
him, coming directly after. 

The ladies had landed and taken possession of their new abode, 
where several of the soldiers were busy forming a garden ; and it 





had struck both the admirers of Miss Linton that an offering or 
two of fruit and flowers would be very acceptable, after the long 
confinement on ship board. 

The sampan, or native boat, that the two lads had come to 
visit, was fastened to a rough bamboo landing-stage, that had 
been one of the first things fitted up at the island ; and, to their 
great delight, they could see that the boat was stored with various 
vegetable productions, some of which were sufficiently attrac- 
tive to make the lads' mouths water, to the forgetting of the 
main object of their visit. 

" Hallo, soldier .' " said Bob Roberts, as he saw Tom Long 
come up, looking very aggressive. 

" Hallo, sailor boy ! " said Tom Long, superciliously ; and 
then they stood looking at each other, quite unconsciously like 
a couple of Malay game cocks in bamboo cages, on the afterpart 
of the sampan. These two pugnacious birds were evincing a 
strong desire for a regular duel; but as the bamboo bars of their 
cages prevented a near approaci', they stood there ruffling their 
plumes, and staring hard in each other's faces. 

** Seems a strange thing that a man can't come down to buy a 
little fruit and some flowers, without your watching him," said 

Bob, at last. 

"I wasn't w*itching you, boy," said Tom Long, superciliously. 
" There, spend your penny, my man, and go about your business." 

" Look here, my stuck-up red herring," cried Bob, setting his 
teeth hard, " Captain Horton said that the naval officers were to 
set an example of gentlemanly behaviour before th^ natives, or 
I'll be blowed, Mr Tom Long, if I wouldn't punch your head." 

" Blowed ¡ª punch head/' sneered Tom Long ; " that's gentle- 
manly, certainly." 

" Look here," said Bob, who was stung to the quick by the 
truth of this remark; "do you want to fight, Mr Tom Long?" 

** Mr T, Long presents his compliments to the middy boy of 
the 'Startler,' and begs to inform him that when her Majesty's 
officers fight, it is with some one worthy of their steel." 

" Ha, ha I Haw, haw ! Ho, ho, ho I " laughed Bob, cutting a 
caper expressive of his great amusement. " Her Majesty's 
officers ¡ª some one worthy of their steeL Ha, ha, ha, ha ! I say, 
Tom Long, how happy and contented her Majesty must feel, 
knowing as she does that the gallant officer, Ensign Long, is 
always ready to draw his sword in her defence. Here, you stop ! 
I got here first." 

"Sahib wants my beautiful fruit,'' said one of the dark-faced 
men in the sampan, towards which Tom Long had stepped 





" Hallo ! " said Bob, going up. " You are not a Malay ? " 

" No, sahib : I Kling, from Madras. Sell fruit ¡ª flowers. 
This Malaya man." 

He pointed to a flat-nosed, high-cheek-boned man with him, 
who was dressed in the inevitable plaid sarong of bright colours, 
and wore a natty little plaited-grass cap upon his head. 

Bob turned, and saw that this man carried a kris stuck in the 
folds of his sarong, which had slipped from the hilt, and he was 
now busy with a little brass box and a leaf. This leaf of one of 
the pepper plants he was smearing with a little creamy-looking 
mixed lime from the brass box, on which he placed a fragment 
of betel nut, rolled it in the leaf, thrust it into his mouth, which 
it seemed to distort, and then began to expectorate a nasty red 
juice, with which he stained the pure water. 

** Hope you feel better now," said Bob, who, in his interest 
in the Malay's proceedings, had forgotten all about the squabble 
with Tom Long. " Ugh ! the dirty brute ! Chewing tobacco's 
bad enough ; but as for that ¡ª Vd just like to get the armourer's 
tongs and fetch that out of your mouth, and then swab it 
dean." 

" No speak English ; Malaya man," said the Kling laughing, 
" Chew betel, very good, sahib. Like try?" 

*' Try ! No," said Bob, with a gesture of disgust. " Here, I 
say ; we'll buy some fruit directly : let's have a look at your 
kris." 

The Kling, who seemed to have quite adopted the customs of 
the people amongst whom he was, hesitated for a moment, look- 
ing suspiciously at the two lads, and then took the weapon he 
wore from his waist, and held it out. 

Bob took it, and Tom Long closed up, being as much inte- 
rested as the midshipman. 

" I say, Tom Long," the latter said, with a laugh, " which of 
us two will get the first taste of that brown insect's sting?" 

" You, Bob," said Tom Long, coolly. " It would let out a 
little of your confounded impudence." 

" Thanky," said Bob, as he proceeded to examine the weapon 
with the greatest interest, from its wooden sheath, with a clumsy 
widened portion by the hilt, to the hilt itself, which, to European 
eyes, strongly resembled the awkwardly formed hook of an um- 
brella or walking-stick, and seemed a clumsy handle by which 
to wield the kris. 

" Pull it out," said Tom Long, eagerly ; and Bob drew it, to 
show a dull ragged-looking two-edged blade, and of a wavy 
form. It was about fifteen inches long, and beginning about 





three inches wide, rapidly narrowed down to less than one inch, 
and finished in a sharp point. 

" It's a miserable-looking little tool," said Bob. 

" Good as a middy's dirk," said Tom Long, laughing. 

"I don't know so much about that," said Bob, making a stab 
at nothing with the kris. '* I say, old chap, this is poisoned, 
isn't it?" 

** No, sahib," said the Kling, displaying his white teeth. 

" But the Malay krises are poisoned," said Bob. " Is his ? *' 

He nodded in the direction of the Malay, who was trying to 
understand what was said. 

" No, sahib, no poison. What for poison kris ? " 

" Make it kill people, of course," said Bob, returning the lusty- 
looking weapon to its scabbard. 

" Kris kill people all same, no poison," said the Kling, taking 
back his dagger. " 'Tick kris through man, no want no poison, 
sahib." 

" He's about right there, middy," said Tom Long. '* Here, 
let's look at some fruit" 

This brought Bob Roberts back to the object of his mission ; 
and realizing at once that Tom Long's object was a present, he, 
by what he considered to be a lucky inspiration, turned his 
attention to the flowers that were in the boat. 

For the Malays are a flower-loving people, and there is nothing 
the dark beauties of this race like better than decking their jetty- 
black hair with white and yellow sweet-scented blossoms. 

Bob was not long in securing a large bunch of arums, all soft 
and white, with the great yellow seed vessel within. To this he 
added a great bunch of delicately tinted lotus, and then sat down 
on the edge of the boat to see what Long would purchase. 

Tom Long was hard to please ; now he would decide on a 
bunch of delicious golden plantains, and then set them aside in 
favour of some custard apples. Then he wondered whether the 
ladies would not prefer some mangoes ; but recollecting that 
they had had plenty of mangoes, and the delicious mangosteen 
in India, he decided upon some limes and a couple of cocoa- 
nuts, when the Kling exclaimed, "Why not sahib buy durian?" 

" What the dickens is durian ? " said Tom. 

" Durian best nice fruit that grow, sahib." 

"Oh, is it?" said Tom. "Then let's have a look." 

The Kling said something to the Malay, who stooped down, 
and solemnly produced what looked like a great spiney nut, 
about as large as a boy's head. 

" That durian, sahib," said the Kling, smiling. 



" Oh, that*s durian, is it ? " said Tom, taking the great fruit ia 
his hands, and turning it over and over, 

"Nice-looking offering for a lady," said Bob Roberts, laughing, 

Tom Long looked up sharply, and was about to speak ; but 
he said nothing, only kept turning the great fruit over and over. 

"Taste nice, most nice all fruit, sahib," said the Kling. 

" Here, let's try one," said Bob, laying down his flowers ; and 
the Kling signed to his companion to give him another, which the 
Malay did with solemn importance, not a smile appearing on his 
face, nor a look suggestive of his being anxious to sell the fruit 
in the boat. 

The Kling took the great wooden fruit, laid it on the thwart of 
the boat, and reaching a heavy knife from the side, he inserted 
it at the head of a faint line, one of ^\q, to be seen running down 
the wooden shell of the fruit, and following this mark, he was able 
to open the curious production, and divide it into portions like 
an orange. In each of these quarters, or fifths, were two or three 
great seeds, as large as chestnuts, and these were set in a quantity 
of thick buttery cream or custard. 

" Well, all I can say is that it's precious rum-looking stuff," 
said Bob. " Which do you eat, the kernels, or this custardy 
stuff?" 

" No eat seeds, sahib ; eat other part," said the Kling. 

"Come along, soldier," said Bob; "Til eat one bit, if you 
will ? " 

Tom Long looked too much disgusted to speak, but in a half- 
offended manner he picked up another quarter of the durian, and 
examined it attentively. 

" Phew ! " ejaculated Bob, looking round, " What a horrible 
smell. There must be something floating down the river." 

They both glanced at the flowing silvery waters of the river, 
but nothing was in sight. 

"It*s getting worse," said Tom Long, "Why, it*s perfectly 
dreadful." 

"It's this precious fruit," exclaimed Bob suddenly; and 
raising his portion to his nose, " Murder 1 " he cried ; " how 
horrid 1" and he pitched his piece overboard. 

"Why, it's a bad one," said Tom Long, sharply: and he 
followed the middy's suit. 

The Kling raised his hands in dismay ; but leaning over the 
side, he secured the two pieces of durian before they were out 
of reach, and turned to his customers. 

"Good durian ¡ª buteful durian," he exclaimed. "Alway 
smell so fashion," 




-' Wliat I " cried Bob, " do you mean to tell me that stufifs fit 
to eat ? " 

The Kling took up the fruit ; and smelt it with his eyes half 
closed, and then drawing in a long breath, he sighed gently, as 
if with regret that he might not indulge in such delicacies. 

"Bess durian," he said, in an exaggerated ecstatic manner. 
" Quite bess ripe.'* 

Bob stooped down and retook a portion of the strange fruit, 
smelt it cautiously, and then, taking out a knife, prepared to 
taste it. 

** You are never going to eat any of that disgusting thing, are 
you, sailor ? " cried Tom Long. 

" I'm going to try it, soldier," said Bob coolly, " Come and 
have a taste lad." 

In the most matter-of-fact way, though quite out of bravado 
on account of Tom Long's disgusted looks, Bob took a long 
sniff at the durian. 

" Well, it is a little high,'' he said, quietly. " Not unlike bad 
brick-kiln burning, with a dash of turpentine." 

" Carrion, you mean," said Tom Long. 

** No, not carrion," said Bob, picking out a good-sized frag- 
ment of the fruit upon his knife \ " it's what the captain calls 
sui generis. ^^ 

" All burra sahib like durian," said the Kling, showing his 
white teeth. 

"Then the burra sahibs have got precious bad taste," said 
Tom Long, just as Bob put the first piece of the fruit into his 
mouth, rolled his eyes, and looked as if he were about to eject 
it into the stream, but did not ; gave it a twist round, tasted it ; 
looked less serious ; began to masticate ; and swallowing the 
piece, proceeded to take a little more. 

" There, it won't do, Bob Roberts,'* said Tom Long ; " say it's 
horrible, like a man. You can t deceive me. What does it 
taste like ? " 

" Don't know yet," said Bob trying the second piece. 

" What a jackass you are to torture yourself like that, to try 
and take me in, middy ! " 

Bob h*^.lped himself to a little more. 

" Well, what does it taste like ? " 

" Custard," said Bob, working away hard, and speaking 
between every dig of his knife; "candles, cream cheese, onion 
sauce, tipsy cake, bad butter, almonds, sherry and bitters, 
banana, old shoes, turpentine, honey, peach and beeswax. 
Here I say ; give us a bit more, old cock." 




Tom Long was astounded, for after finishing the frst piece 
of the evil-smelling dainty, Bob had begun the seconJ, and was 
toiling at it with a patient industry that showed Yis thorough 
appreciation of the most peculiar fruit in the world. 

" Tipsy cake, bad butter, old shoes, peach and beeswax," and 
the other incongruities, rang in Long's ear ; and to prove that he 
was not deceiving him, there was Bob eating away as if his soul 
were in the endeavour to prove how much he could dispose of 
at one go. 

It was too much for Tom Long ; his curiosity was roused to 
the highest point, and as the Kling was smilingly watching Bob, 
Tom signed to the Malay to give him a piece. 

The solemn-looking Asiatic picked up another fruit, and while 
Tom looked impatiently on, it was opened, and a piece handed 
to him, which he took, and with Bob's example before his eyes 
took a greedy bite ¡ª uttered a cry of disgust ¡ª and flung the piece 
in hand at the giver. 

The Malayan character has been aptly described as volcanic. 
The pent-up fire of his nature slumbers long sometimes beneath 
his calm, imperturbable, dignified exterior ; but the fire lies 
smouldering within, and upon occasions it bursts out, carrying 
destruction before it. 

In this case Tom Long's folly ¡ª worse, his insnJt to the 
master of the sampan ¡ª roused the fiery Malay on the instant 
to fury, as he realized the fact that the youth he looked upon 
as an infidel and an intruder had dared to oflfer to him, a 
son of the faithful, such an offence ; then with a cry of rage, he 
sprang at the ensign, bore him backwards to the bottom of the 
boat ; and as the midshipman started up, it was to see the 
Malay's deadly, flame-shaped kris waving in the air. 



CHAPTER VII. 



HOW DICK RELATED THE VISIT, 

With a cry of horror Bob Roberts leaped forward, and caught 
the Malay's wrist in time to avert the blow, the Kling starting 
forward the next instant, and helping to hold the infuriate 
Asiatic ; while Tom Long struggled up and leaped ashore, where 
a knot of soldiers and sailors were gathering. 

"Don't say anything, Tom," cried Bob. "Here you ¡ª tell 
him he did not mean to offend him," he continued to the Kling, 
who repeated the words ; and the Malay, who had been ready 
to turn on the midshipman, seemed to calm down and sheathed his 
kris ; while the Kling spoke to him again with the result that the 
offended man sat himself down in the boat, gazing vindictively 
at the young ensign ashore. 

" Here, no more durian to-day, thank you," said Bob, hand- 
ing the Kling a dollar. " And look here, you sir ; don't let that 
fellow get whipping out his kris on any of our men, or he'll be 
hung to the yard-arm as sure as he's alive." 

" He much angry, sahib," said the Kling, whose swarthy 
visage had turned of a dirty clay colour. " Soldier sahib hurt 
him much." 

*' Yes, but if we hadn't stopped him he'd have hurt my friend 
much more." 

As he spoke Bob nodded shortly to the Kling, and leaped ashore. 

"Sahib not take his flowers," said the latter, and dipping 
them in the river, and giving them a shake, he left the boat 
and handed the beautiful blossoms to the young sailor, who 
directly after joined Tom Long, who looked, in spite of his 
sunburnt visage, rather "white about the gills," to use Bob's 
expression. 

" That fellow ought to be shot I shall report this case," cried 
the ensign angrily, 

" I don't think I should," said Bob quietly. " You see yoa 
did upset the poor fellow, and they are an awfully touchy lot," 



" It was all your fault for playing me that confounded trick," 
cried Tom Long, passionately. 

*' Trick ? I played no trick," said Bob, indignant to a degree 
at the accusation. 

" You did," cried Tom Long, " humbugging me into eating 
that filthy fruit." 

" Why, it was delicious," cried Bob. " I should have gone on 
and finished mine if you hadn't made that upset." 

" I don't care ; it was a nasty practical joke," cried Tom 

Long, " and 1 beg your pardon, Roberts," he said, suddenly 

changing his tone, and holding out his hand. " I believe you 
saved my life." 

" Oh, nonsense 1 " said Bob. " He only meant to prick you 
with his kris." 

" Heaven defend me from all such pricks ! " said Tom Long, 
devoutly, as he held the middy's hand in his, '* I say, Bob 
Roberts, I wish you and I could agree better." 

" So do I," said Bob, giving the hand he held a hearty shake ; 
*' But we never shall. I always feel as if I wanted to quarrel 
with you, as soon as we meet." 

" So do I," said Tom Long. " You are such an aggravating 
little beggar." 

" It is my nature to," said Bob, laughing. " But you won't 
say anything about this affair, shall you ? It will be a lesson how 
to deal with the natives." 

" If you think I had better not, I won't," said Tom Long, 
thoughtfully. Then, with a shudder, " I say, I felt just as if I 
was going to have that horrid kris in me. I shall never forget 
this, Bob Roberts." 

" Oh, stuff and nonsense ! Here, I say, have one of these 
bunches of flowers, old fellow." 

" No, no ; I don't want them," said the ensign, colouring up, 

" Yes, yes ; take one. Quick, here are the ladies. Tm 
going to give my lotuses to Miss Sinclair,*' he said quietly. 
And as Tom Long's fingers closed upon the arums, the ladies, 
who were walking with the resident came close up. 

" Ah, Mr Long," said the latter, " what a lovely bunch of 
arums 1 " 

" Yes sir," said Tom, looking very red in the face ; " they're 
for the mess table." 

"Your lotuses are lovely, Mr Midshipman Roberts," said 
Miss Linton, smilingly greeting the frank-faced lad. 

"Aren't they, Miss Linton?" said Bob. " I'm just going to 
send them aboard to the first lufif; he's rather poorly." 




They parted ; and it was quite true, for after looking rather 
shame-facedly the one at the other, the ensign bore off his arums 
to the mess-room, and the lotuses were sent on board the 
"Startler" by the very next boat. 

There was nothing more said respecting the adventure with 
the Malay boatman; but the two youths, who were a good deal 
puzzled in their own minds as to whether they were friends or 
enemies, exchanged glances a day or two later, when stringent 
orders were issued respecting the behaviour of the Englishmen 
to the natives. The men of both services were warned to be 
very careful, especially as it was the custom for the Malays to 
carry the deadly kris. The character of the people too was en- 
larged upon, their pride and self-esteem ; and strict orders 
were given, to be followed by severe punishment if disobeyed, 
that the people and their belongings were to be treated with 
the greatest respect. 

Every one was as busy as could be, for there was an immense 
amount of labour necessary to get the place into a state satis- 
factory to the various officers. Great preparations were being 
made too for the first meeting with Sultan Hamet, though it 
was a matter of doubt whether he would come to the residency 
in state, or expect the English to call upon him in his palm- 
thatched palace. 

" He's a rum sort of a chap," Dick the sailor said, freely 
giving his opinion. " Sultan, indeed ! What call have they to 
say he's a sultan ? Why, Sergeant Lund, Billy Mustard, and that 
sick chap Sim, who went ashore with despatches, come back 
last night, and they say it's no more a palace as he lives in than 
a pig-sty. It's for all the world like a big bamboo bam, thatched 
with leaves." 

" What's that ? " said Bob Roberts, coming up, with the young 
ensign, to where two or three of the sailors were, under the trees, 
talking to a group of soldiers. 

" I was a telling of 'em about what Sergeant Lund told me, 
sir," said Dick, pulling his forelock, "that this here sultan as 
we've come here to protect lives in a place as is just like a big 
bamboo bam standing on stilts. And Lor' ha' mercy, they 
say it was a sight : with leaves, and cabbage stumps, and potato 
parings chucked about under the place ! " 

" Now come, Dick," cried the middy -, " no yarns, please." 

"Well sir, of course I don't mean real English cabbage 
stumps and potato parings, same as we has at home, but what 
answers for 'em here, and coky-nut huxes and shells, and banana 
rinds, and a nasty bad smelling kind o' fruit as they calls 
doo rings." 





Bob gave the ensign a comical look, 

" Why Billy Mustard says ¡ª and this here's a fack ¡ª as the smell 
o' them doorings." 

" Durians, Dick." 

"All right, sir," said the old sailor; "that don't make 'em 
smell a bit better ¡ª the smell o' them things knocked him slap 
off his feet." 

The men laughed, and old Dick went on ¡ª 

" Everything about the place was as ontidy as a bilge hole ; 
and when our ambassadors ¡ª " 

"Our what? "said Bob. 

" Well, them as carried the despatches, sir ¡ª got close up, they 
was told to wait because the sultan was asleep. When seeing 
as a reg'lar party of the Malays, every man with his bit of a 
toasting fork by his side, come round to stare at 'em, Sergeant 
Lund he says to himself, ' Lor' ! what a pity it is as I haven't got 
Private Tomkins, or Private Einns, or two or three more nice 
smart, handsome chaps o' that kind with me, instead of such a 
scuffy couple o' fellows as Sim and Mustard.' " 

Here, of course, there was a roar of laughter, for Privates 
Tomkins and Binns were amongst the listeners. 

" Come away," said Tom Long, frowning. ** I don't like 
mixing with our men." 

" No, no : stop," cried Bob. " They won't think any the less 

of us ; we're off duty now." 

Tom Long wanted to hear what was said, so he remained. 

"And one of our nice hansum young orficers," continued 
Dick, in the most solemn way, " and a middy and some smart 
Jacks." 

" And Dick Dunnage," said one of the soldiers. 

" Well, he did mention me, but I was too modest to say so." 

Here there was another laugh. 

" ' How so be,' " continued Dick, " he sez, ' must make the best 
o* what material we got ; ' so he pulls his men together, squares 
their yards, and coils down all their ropes tidy, tightens the 
breechings o' their guns, and lets the poor benighted savages of 
niggers have their fill o' staring at real British sogers. Then 
they turned civil, and brought 'em out drinks, and fruit, and 
pipes ; and they was very comfortable, till some one come out 
and said as the sultan was awake, and wanted his cocks, so the 
chap as went as interpreter told them ; and then there was a 
bustle, and some three or four chaps went and fetched some 
fighting cocks, and took 'em inside the bam ¡ª I mean the palace; 
and our fellows was kept waiting till the sergeant hears a reg'lar 



cock-a-doodle-doo, just for all the world as if he was at home, 
and he know'd by that as one of the birds had won. Just about 
a minute after some one come and beckoned him, and he goes 
up the steps into the palace, as had bamboo floors, and carpets 
lying about ; and there was the sultan up at one end, sitting on 
carpet, and all his wives and people about him." 

" How many wives had he got, Dick?" said the midshipman. 

"About a dozen, sir. But I'll just tell you how many he'd 
have had if my missus had been one on 'em." 

" How many, Dick?'* 

"Just one, sir; she'd clear out all the others in a brace o' 
shakes. She wouldn't stand none o' that nonsense. Why, 
bless yer art, there was one had got a golden pestle and 
mortar ¡ª " 

" Gently, Dick ! gently ! " said the midshipman. 

" It's a fack, sir, and as sure as I stand here ; and she was 
a bruising up betel nuts for him to chew, and another was mixing 
up lime, and another spreading leaves, whilst ¡ª there, I dursn't 
hardly tell you this here, because you won't believe it." 

" Let it off gently, Dick," said the middy, " and we'll try and 
bear it" 

" Well, sir, hang me if one of his wives ¡ª the oldest and ugliest 
of 'em ¡ª wasn't sitting there holden a golden spittoon ready for 

him to use whenever he wanted." 

There was another roar of laughter, and Dick exclaimed, ¡ª 
" There, you ask Sergeant Lund if every word a'most I've 

said ain't quite true " ¡ª which, with the exception of Dick's 

embellishment about the handsome sailors and soldiers, proved 

to be the case. 



CHAPTER VIII, 

TOM long's wound. 

Doctor Bolter had been very proud of the cure he had effected 

in the case of Adam Gray, whom, from that day forward, h-e 
looked upon in quite a different hght, obtaining his services as 
often as possible in carrying out what he called his measures for 
preserving the camp in health, and he was constantly sending 
Gray on missions to the major. But the doctor and his plans 
were set aside one morning, when there was an order for a 
general parade ; and it was evident that there was something im- 
portant on the way, for a good deal of bustle was visible on the 
deck of the steamer. 

The news soon leaked out that the resident and officers were 
to make a state visit, full of ceremony, to the sultan ; and in con- 
sequence there was a general turn out, in full review order, with 
the band. The sailors landed, and were drawn up on the shore, 
looking smart in their white, easy-fitting dress ; and the steamer's 
cutters were soon after busy, landing the greater portion of the 
troops with their officers, in full uniform ; while quite a crowd of 
Malays assembled on the beach, staring, some in wonderment, 
some manifestly in dislike, at the strangers. 

The grand muster took place beneath the shade of some large 
trees, as far as was possible, for the heat was intense. Every 
one was in his best ; and Ensign Long marched by Bob Roberts 
with a very bright sword beneath his arm, and putting on a pair 
of white kid gloves. 

The middy tried to take matters coolly ; but the thoroughly 
consequential air of his companion roused his ire, and he longed 
to do something to upset him. 

That was, however, impossible, for the arrangements were 
complete ; and the march inland, about a couple of miles, com- 
menced with the Malays now drawing off into the woods, till ¡ª 
what looked rather ominous ¡ª the little force was left entirely 
alone. 





The officers commented upon the fact, and felt a little sus- 
picious ; but their doubts were set aside by the appearance of a 
little party, of evidently some importance, for two, who seemed 
to be chiefs, were mounted upon small elephants, and these, by 
the voice of one of the party ¡ª a handsome, dark youth, in bril- 
liant silk sarong and baju ¡ª announced themselves as coming 

from the sultan to act as guides. 

This changed the state of affairs, and the idea that there might 
be treachery afoot was completely dismissed from the minds of 
all, save when, now and then, the gleam of a spear head was seen 
amidst the trees in the jungle ; and Major Sanders pointed out 
how easily they might be led into an ambush. 

Captain Horton was by his side, and that officer agreed that 
it would be easy ; but, at the same time, gave it as his opinion 
that the best policy they could aifect was an appearance of full 
confidence in the Malay potentate, while they kept strictly on 
their guard. 

Farther back in the line of troops Private Gray was marching 
along, feeling anything but easy in his mind ; for as he glanced 
now and then to his left, he kept making out the gleam of steel, 
or the white garments of some Malay amidst the trees ; and at 
last, just as Captain Smithers was abreast, he pointed out to him 
the fact. 

The captain felt disposed to resent it as a breach of discipline ; 
but the young man's manner was so earnest, that he nodded, and 
watchfully turned his head in the same direction. 

"What do you think then. Gray ?" said the captain. "They 
are only people taking an interest in what is, to them, a great 
sight" 

" I'm suspicious, sir, by nature," said Gray, " and I can't help 
feeling that we are living on the edge of a volcano." 

" Do you always make use of such fine language. Gray ? " said 
Captain Smithers with a sneer. 

** I beg your pardon, sir," was the reply ,* " I was trying to 
speak respectfully to my officer," replied Gray. 

Captain Smithers frowned, and felt annoyed with himself for 
his meanness. 

"Yes, yes, of course, Gray," he said, hastily; "but there is 
nothing to fear." 

" Nothing to fear 1 " thought Private Gray ; " and we are trust- 
ing ourselves entirely to these people, who are known to be 
treacherous ; and the ladies and the women of the regiment arc 
all on that island, protected by only a weak force ! " 

Strangely enough. Captain Smithers had very similar thoughts 




to these as they rambled on, in tolerable coolness now, for they 
were beneath the trees. 

They both thought afterwards that their fears were needless ; 
and following the guides, they soon after were formed up in front 
of the sultan*8 house and those of his principal men, all of which, 
though certainly somewhat better than the sergeant's account to 
Dick Dunnage would have led any one to expect, were of an 
extremely simple and lowly character. 

Here the officers waited for their audience of the great man, 
Mr Linton being particularly anxious to make arrangements for 
carrying out the political business upon which he was engaged ; 
but after waiting half an hour, one of the principal chiefs came 
out to announce that the sultan was too unwell to receive them. 

The English officers flushed up, and looked upon the message 
as an insult, and for the moment there seemed a disposition to 
resent it ; but the wnse counsels of Mr Linton prevailed, and the 
order was given to march back. 

Just then the young chief who had acted as interpreter before, 
and who spoke very good English, approached the place where 
Bob Roberts and the ensign were standing. 

"I am very sorry," he said ; "I meant to ask you to refresh- 
ments. Will you take cigars ? '* 

They had only time to thank the young chief for his courtesy 
and take their places, as the march back was commenced ¡ª this 
time without guides, for none came forward, which was looked 
upon as so ominous a sign that extra care was taken, the men 
marching with loaded arms. 

The precautions were not unnecessary ; for they had hardly 
effected half their march, when there was the loud beating of a 
gong heard upon their right, followed by the same deafening din 
on the left. 

The men were steadied in the ranks, and every one was on the 
alert ; but still there came nothing more to cause alarm till they 
had arrived within half a mile of their landing-place, when, as 
they were passing through a more open portion of the track, there 
was a shout, and a shower of limbings came whizzing past them. 
Again a shout, this time on their left, and another shower of the 
keenly-pointed spears whizzed by. 

There was a short, sharp command or two as the soldiers 
faced outwards, and every other man fired, sending a ringing 
volley crashing through the forest. 

There was another din, made by the beating of gongs, and a 
few more spears were thrown, one of which struck Ensign Long ; 
and these were replied to by another sharp volley, which crashed 


through the trees, making the twigs and leaves rattle as they 
pattered down. Then there was a dead silence, as the troops 
waited for fresh orders. 

Bob Roberts, who was close by the ensign, turned pale as 
ashes as he saw the ensign stagger back, to stand literally pinned 
to a tree, in which the blade of the limbing had buried itself. 
All feeling of jealousy had passed away, and, catching Long by 
the hand, he gazed earnestly in his face. 

"Are you much hurt, old fellow?" he cried hoarsely, as he 
realized the fact that the keen spear had passed diagonally 
through the youth's breast before it buried itself in the soft 
endogenous tree. 

" I don*t know yet," said Tom Long quietly ; " but the brutes 
have ruined my best tunic." 

" Hang your tunic ! " cried Bob, excitedly. *' Here, fetch the 
doctor. No ; help here to get Mr Long to the residency. Bring 
up a dhooly." 

"I suppose I shall feel it when they draw out the spear," said 
Tom Long calmly. 

"Do you feel faint?" cried the middy. "Here, who has a 
little rack ? *' 

" Here's some water, sir, in my canteen," said Sergeant Lund. 

" Forward 1" rang out from behind just then; and then the 
voice of Captain Smithers made itself heard, 

" Who's that down ? " 

" Ensign Long, sir," some one said, 

" Poor lad 1 poor lad I '* cried the captain, " Ah, Long, my 
dear boy, how is it with you ? Good heavens ! Quick, my lads ; 
bring up a dhooly." 

" Hadn't we better get the spear out, sir ? " said Bob Roberts, 
anxiously. 

" Yes, out of the tree, of course," said the captain ; " but 
mind ¡ª steady I Here, let me. I won't hurt you more than I 
can help," he continued, as he drew the spear out of the palm, 
and then hesitated as to how they were to manage to carry the 
injured man, with the lengthy shaft passing through his chest. 

Tom Long solved the question himself by taking hold of the 
spear handle with both hands and giving it a tug, while every one 
present gazed at him with horror, expecting to see the terrible 
stains that must follow. 

Bob Roberts dragged out his handkerchief and rapidly doubled 
it, ready to form a pad to staunch the bleeding ¡ª rushing forward 
to clap it to the wound, as the ensign tore the spear from his 
breast 




** Open his tunic first," cried Captain Smithers ; and he bore 
Tom Long back on to the ground, tearing open his scariet 
uniform, while the injured object of his attentions began to work 
his left arm about. 

*' I say, gently," he said. ** I don't think I*m much hurt" 

" You don't feel it yet," cried Bob Roberts. 

*' Look out there ! '' cried a voice in authority somewhere 
behind ; and then a couple of men ran up with a light hospital 
litter for wounded or sick men. 

" It went ¡ª it went ¡ª *' said Tom Long, slowly. 

" Why, confound you, Long," said Captain Smithers j "youVe 
not been scratched.'* 

" No ; I do not think I am," said the ensign, getting up, feel- 
ing himself carefully about the chest "It went through my 
tunic and under my left arm." 

" Why, youVe got about six inches of padding in your coat/' 
said Bob Roberts, whose hands were busy about the young man's 
breast. 

" Yes," said Tom Long ; " more or less." 

'* Forward 1 " shouted Captain Smithers ; and the march was 
resumed, with Tom Long looking very woeful about the two 
holes that had been made in his scarlet tunic, and gradually 
growing terribly annoyed, as he saw Bob Roberts pretending to 
stifle his laughter; while the men, in spite of the danger on either 
side, tittered and grinned as they kept catching sight of the young 
officer's scarlet cloth wounds. 

Major Sandars was equally anxious with the resident to get 
back to the island, for a feeling of dread had risen up that the 
residency might have been attacked during their absence. In 
fact, it seemed now that they had been out-generalled ; and if 
their fort, and provisions, and stores should be in the hands of 
the Malays, their position would be perilous in the extreme. 

As Bob Roberts went on, he found the men eagerly discussing 
the matter, not from a feeling of fear, but of love of excitement ; 
and among others, Private Sim was saying in a low voice, that if 
he had only been well and strong, nothing would have pleased 
him better than fighting his way back through the jungle, " any- 
wheres ¡ª to the world's end if they liked." 

Meanwhile, though it was evident that there was a large body 

of Malays on their right, the answer they had got to their first 
attack had kept them off, and the long line of troops and blue- 
jackets went on unmolested by their enemies. Every precaution 
was taken ; and in some of the denser portions of the jungle they 
regularly felt their way with advance guards and flankers, who, 



poor fellows, had a most tough job to force their way through the 
tangled creepers and undergrowth. 

At length, however, the river was reached, and it was evident, 
to the great delight and relief of all, that the island was safe, and 
the steamer lay in its old position, unmolested by prahu or attack 
from the shore. 

Every man breathed more freely on seeing this ; and the boats 
coming off, the whole party were rapidly transferred to steamer 
and to isle, where a council was called, and the situation 
discussed. 

It was a peculiar position for the little force which had been 
sent up the country to help and protect Sultan Hamet, who, in 
return, had refused to see Her Majesty's representative, and 
allowed them to be attacked by his people on their way back. 

The question to decide was, whether, after such an insult as 
they had received, the little force ought not to at once retire from 
their position, though the bolder spirits were in favour of holding 
it at all costs, and trying to read the sultan such a lesson as should 
scare his people from venturing to molest the English any more. 

The council was interrupted by an embassy of a couple of chiefs 
from the sultan himself, who solved the difficulty by announcing 
that the attack was not made by their ruler's people, but by a 
certain rajah, whose campong, or village, was a few miles up the 
river. This chief was a respecter of no one, but levied black 
mail of all who passed down the stream. Every boat laden with 
slabs of tin or bags of rice had to pay toll for permission to pass 
on in peace ; and if resistance was offered, he had guns mounted 
upon his stockade, and a couple of well-armed prahus, whose 
crews liked nothing better than confiscating any boat whose 
owner endeavoured to resist the rajah's demands. 

Any doubts as to the truth of this story were set aside by the 
sultan's earnest request that the English officers should at once 
proceed up the river and severely punish this rajah, who was a 
thorn in Hamet's side. 

With the promise that the matter should have proper con- 
sideration, the two chiefs took their departure ; and the rest of 
the evening was spent in examining different Malays from the 
village, all of whom told the same story, that it was Rajah Gan- 
tang who had made the attack, and that he was a perfect scourge 
to the people round. 

The next day further investigations were made ; and had any 
doubt remained, it was chased away by the appearance of two 

long war prahus, pulled by a large number of rowers, and crammed 
with Malays. 



These vessels were allowed to float gently down with the 
stream, stem foremost, when, as much out of bravado as any- 
thing, several shots were fired from the small brass swivel guns 
on board, the little balls rattling through the steep roof of the 
men's quarters ; while before a gun could be brought to bear, the 
oars rapidly plashed the water, and the two prahus were swept 
back round a wooded point up stream, well out of sight. 

This was sufficient for the officers in command, who issued 
such orders as placed all the men in a state of the most intense 
excitement, for it was evident that there was to be an expedition 
up the river to punish the audacious chief, who was probably in 
profound ignorance of the strength of the power he had braved. 



CHAPTER IX. 



A NIGHT ATTACK, AND A MISFORTUNE, 

It seems a curious thing to a man of peace that a man of war 
should be in a state of high delight at the prospect of an engage- 
ment wherein he may lose his life ; but the fact is, that when two 
or three hundred men are bound to attack some enemy, each 
single individual knows full well that somebody will be wounded, 
perhaps killed, but believes that it will not be himself. 

So it was then that on board the " Startler " there was no little 
excitement. The grindstone was in full use to sharpen cutlasses, 
and in addition there was a great demand made on the armourer 
for files to give to the lethal weapons a keener edge, one which 
was tried over and over again, as various messmates consulted 
together as to the probability of taking off a Malay's head at a 
blow. 

" What youVe got to do, my lads," said old Dick, " is to keep 
'era off. You as has rifles and bagnets always show 'em the 
pynte ; and you as fights with your cutlashes, keep 'em well away 
off your sword arm ; then you'll be all right." 

Capital advice if it could be acted upon, and a way of avoiding 
all kris wounds, but useless against the Malays' other dangerous 
weapon, the limbing or lance. 

All the preparations were made over-night, so that long before 
daybreak the expedition could be well on the way, the object 
being to surprise the stockade and its defenders, and bum the 
bamboo fortification and the prahus. 

The force was to consist of fifty soldiers, twenty-five marines, 
and fifty blue-jackets, who were to embark in the steamer's boats, 
two of which were provided with small breech-loading pieces 
running on slides, and under the charge of the sailors. 

Water, provisions, plenty of spare ammunition, all were handed 
down, and two hours after midnight, the boats that were to con- 
vey the soldiers ranged up alongside the landii>g-place, and in 



due time the embarkation took place, the soldiers being under 
the command of Captain Smithers, the sailors under that of the 
first lieutenant of the "Startler." 

A guide had been found in the person of a native fisherman, 
who, upon coming to the island the day before, had been de- 
tained, so that he should not communicate with the shore, and 
so give warning of the expedition. Not that there was any fear, 
for the Malay was in a high state of delight at the idea of the 
rajah meeting his match. 

From this man they learned that for many years past Rajah 
Gangtang had been a perfect scourge to the river. He was 
famous for his piracies and his daring. Sultan Hamet dreaded 
him ; and it was only to strengthen his position against the war- 
like rajah, who was too strong for him, that Hamet had entered 
into his alliance with the British, and invited the presence of a 
resident and the troops. 

This was satisfactory, for the idea of the sultan proving trea- 
cherous was a suggestion of a complicated knot that it would 
take no end of policy to undo. Whereas, if it was all true about 
Rajah Gantang, his defeat and the breaking up of his power 
would be hailed with delight, and work greatly towards the pacifica- 
tion of a country terribly broken up by petty quarrels, strengthen 

Hamet's position, and give inimical chiefs a lesson on the power 

of the British forces that they were not likely to forget 

It was soon after two o'clock that the soldiers were mustered 
down to the boats, and silently took their places, just as through 
the mist, and with muffled oars, three more boats came slowly 
abreast of them, and after a brief colloquy moved off, with in- 
structions that there should be no talking on board. 

Fortunately for the expedition, though it was misty it was not 
so dark but that the leaders could follow the little light sampan 
of the Malay fisherman, who, apparently without any difficulty, 
sent his frail boat onward against the stream. 

It was a weird procession through the mist, which gave the 
boats a fantastic, unreal appearance, while the shores looked, 
where the fog broke or floated up, strange, dark, and full of mys- 
tery. Every now and then there was a low echoing splash in the 
water, which told of some great reptile disturbed from its resting- 
place upon a muddy bank. Then those in the boats heard 
strange cries coming from a distance in the jungle, to be answered 
by other calls, some farther distant, some near at hand, telling 

that the various nocturnal creatures were busy securing food 
before the sun should drive them to their hiding-places in the 
darkest recesses of the forest 




"What's that?" whispered Bob Roberts to old Dick, who was 
beside him in the foremost boat 

" Sounds like something swimming, sir. There, you can hear 
it blowing." 

"Do you think one of the boats has upset," whispered Bob, 
excitedly, as he leaned over the gunwale and tried to pierce the 
mist. 

" 'Taint likely, sir. Wouldn't they shout if they was turned 
upl Leastwise our chaps would; there's no counting for what 
soldiers might do, though. I shouldn't say as they'd let their 
selves drown without a squeak. That there's a tiger swimming 
'crost the river, that's what that is." 

" Get out," exclaimed the middy ; "just as if a great cat would 
take to the water. Hist 1 I say, Doctor Bolter 1 " 

" Yes," was whispered back from the next boat 

" Would tigers swim ? " 

" Yes. There's one trying to cross the river now." 

" What did I tell you, Mr Roberts ? " growled old Dick, softly. 

** Here, give me your rifle, marine ; "^ said Bob, excitedly. " I 
should like a shot at a tiger." 

"Silence in that boat 1" said Captain Smithers sharply; and 
the oars went on dipping softly, while Bob Roberts sat and 
listened till the panting noise of the swimming creature died 
away. 

" I wonder whether Ensign Long 's in the expedition ? " said 
Bob, after a pause. 

" Yes, sir ; please I see him," said one of the sailors, " He 
got into one of the boats, wrapped up in a big grey great-coat." 

"I hope he won't get wounded this time," said Bob. And 
the men all laughed ; for Ensign Long's wound was a subject 
that afforded them no little amusement 

Then the procession went on, the boats gliding along in won- 
derful silence. Sometimes a glimpse of the dark foliage told 
them that they were a little too near either bank, but on the 
whole the Malay led them a very correct course along the centre 
of the stream, which wound here and there, sometimes contracting 
its banks, sometimes widening out, but always running swift, 
deep, and strongly, downward towards the sea. 

The mist grew thicker, and hung so low down upon the water 
that at last the boats had to proceed very slowly, a rope being 
paid out from one to the other, so that there should be no mis- 
take, otherwise it was quite within the range of possibility that 
one or the other would go astray, and be wanting at some critical 
time. A similar plan was carried out with the sampan, during 



the latter part of the journey, for it was often invisible; and so at 
last they felt their way onward in silence, till the Malay allowed 
his sampan to drift alongside the bows of the leading boat, and 
whispered to the interpreter his conviction that they were close 
up to the stockade. 

" Might be anywhere/' muttered the midshipman, 

** Yes, sir, it's a thick'un," growled old Dick j " and if I was in 
command o' this here expedition, I should give orders for all the 
Jacks to out cutlashes and cut the fog in pieces, while the sogers 
and marines forked it over with their bay'nets." 

"Silence, there!" came from one of the officers, just as a 
faint breeze began to spring up, as if to solve the difficulty ; 
breaking the fog into patches, and then forcing a way right 
through, so that it was swept to right and left of the river, pass- 
ing under the trees. 

The change was almost magical, for at the end of ten minutes 
the river was quite clear, and by the glittering starlight they 
could see the stockade on their right, while moored in front of 
it were two large prahus. 

The boats closed in for the officer in command to give his 
final orders for the attack, and every man's heart beat fast with 
excitement, as he clutched his weapons. 

They had no knowledge of the enemy's strength ; but trusting 
to a night surprise, they felt satisfied of being able to put him to 
flight ; so two boats were sent to board the prahus, while the 
three others made for the stockade, one to attack in front, while 
the others landed on either side, to take it in the rear, expecting 
an easy task, for there was not a sign of life as far as they could see. 

But if the leaders of the expedition counted upon trapping 
the Malays asleep, they were mistaken. There is too much of 
his native tiger in the Malays' nature for such a march to be 
stolen upon them ; and, just as the boats separated, and began 
rapidly to advance, the silence was broken by the deafening 
clangour of a gong, lights appeared suddenly in tJie stockade and 
in both the prahus, and to the astonishment of the attacking 
force, there was the flashing of muskets, the louder roar of the 
lelahs or small brass guns, and the surface of the river was 
splashed up in all directions by the bullets. 

Fortunately the aim was bad, and the boats had separated, 
so that no one was injured, as, with a loud cheer, the sailors 
made their oars bend, the waters lapped and splashed beneath 
the bows of the boats, and soldier and marine waited eagerly for 
the command to fire. 

But this was not given ; for Captain Smithers felt that if the 





task was to be done, it must be achieved at the point of the 
bayonet ; so, bidding his men be steady, he waited till the boat 
he was in crashed amongst the thick reeds and grass growing 
along the water's edge 5 and then leaping out, lead his little 
company through the dense undergrowth, round to where he 
expected to find the entrance to the stockade, from which a 
lively fire was now being kept up, while a deep-toned roar told 
that the large gun in the boat attacking the face of the stockade 
had begun to speak. 

The party Ensign Long was with, under one of the lieutenants, 
had to make for the other side of the stockade, while the boat 
in which was Bob Roberts, being manned entirely by sailors and 
marines, had to attack the largest prahu. 

The men were sanguine and full of spirit, their only regret 
being that they had so far to go before they could reach the sides 
of the long prahu, which they found now on the move, her 
anchor having been slipped, so that she was slowly floating down 
the stream, as she kept up a lively fire against the boat. 

It seemed long, but not a minute could have elapsed before 
the boat was alongside, the bowman driving a Malay head over 
heels with the boat-hook, and then making fast, while the sailors 
let their well-secured oars swing, seized their rifles, and began to 
spring up the sides. 

** Up with you, my lads," roared Bob Roberts, who was armed 
with a cutlass far too large for him to handle in comfort. But it 
was easy enough to say, " Up with you ! " while it was excessively 
difficult to obey. Man after man tried to climb the side of the 
prahu, but only to slip back into the boat ; while those who had 
better success found it impossible to surmount the stout bamboo 

basket-work or matting, with which the sides were protected 
from assault 

Through this, spear after spear was thrUst j and after several 
ineffectual attempts to reach the deck, the sailors and marines 
began to retaliate by thrusting bayonet and cutlass through in 
return. A few shots were fired, but there was nothing to aim at ] 
though the Malays were not of that opinion, for they kept load- 
ing and firing the two lelahs on board, making a great deal of 
noise, but necessarily doing no mischief 

^ Back into the boat, my lads," cried the lieutenant in com- 
mand, as they floated down with the prahu, which evidently 
swarmed with men ; " well try round the other side." 

" Let me board them first, Mr Johnson," cried Bob excitedly. 

" No, no, my lad," was the reply. "What the men cannot do, 
you cannot." 




In the excitement of the men firing and making a fresh effort, 
as the boat was worked round the stem of the prahu, the 
lieutenant lost sight of Bob Roberts, who, after feeling terribly 
alarmed for the first few minates, had become accustomed to the 
firing and shouting, and then grown so excited and angry that 
he felt as if he could not stay in his place. Getting hold of a 
rifle, laid down by one of the men who tried to board the prahu, 
he had given vent to some of his excitement by loading and 
firing as fast as he could, sending bullet after bullet whistling 
through the tough screen, but doing no mischief to a soul ; and 
still the prahu floated steadily down the stream, getting farther 
and farther away from where the firing was on the increase ; the 
boats' guns sending an echoing report to roll along the surface 
of the water, and giving ample notice to those at the residency 
that the business was going on. 

As the boat Bob Roberts was in reached the other side of 
the prahu, the Malays, uttering loud yells, rushed over, and 
once more there was a desultory attack kept up and repelled ; 
for do all they could, not a sailor was able to surmount the tall 
screen. 

Several wounds had been received from the limbings, and the 
men believed that they had pretty well retaliated with the bayonet, 
but they could see nothing ; and checked as they had been, again 
and again, they were growing disheartened, and thinking what 
else they could do, when a loud yelling from the prahu, and the 
reports of several muskets, told of something fresh. 

" Where's Mr Roberts ? " said the lieutenant, suddenly. 

" Here he is, sir," replied old Dick ; and in the same breath, 
''No he ain't, sir. He was here just now." 

" Look out, my lads ! Seize those sweeps," said the lieutenant, 
as several long oars were now thrust out beneath the bamboo 
screen, and the Malays stabbed at the boat with them, trying to 
drive a hole through her bottom. 

Several of the sailors seized the long oars on the instant, and 
hung on, while some of their messmates tried to fire through the 
holes, with the result that long spears were now thrust through, 
and desparate stabs made at the attacking party. 

It was a wretched desultory fight, and the lieutenant was almost 
at his wits* end, for his spirit forbade his giving up, and all the 
time, no matter how bravely his men tried, they could not get on 
board the prahu. 

Just then it was observed by the men who held on by the 
sweeps, that a brass lelah was being thrust through a hole, and 
brought to bear upon them, when the result would have been 



death to several, and the sinking of the boat, if it was fired. 
The danger was, however, averted by old Dick, who seized a 
boat-hook, and hitching it on the prahu's side, gave so sturdy a 
haul that he drew the boat some six feet along, and closer 
alongside. 

He was just in time, for as the boat grated against the prahu 
there was a sharp ringing report, and the water was thrown up 
close astern. 

A sharp volley from the boat replied to this, probably with as 
good results ; and then thrusting with spear and bayonet went 
on in the darkness. 

"Confound it all, my lads ! we must get aboard her some- 
how," cried the lieutenant, stamping his foot with rage, as he 
stood up in the boat. " Here, make ready some of you, and 
follow me. Dick Dunnage, you keep her fast with the boat- 
hook." 

As he spoke the lieutenant parried a thrust with his sword, and 
replied to it with a shot from his revolver, letting both weapons 
then hang from his wrists by sword-knot and lanyard as, seizing one 
of the sweeps, he began to clamber up, followed by a dozen of 
the men. There was a confused roar of shouts, yells, and 
cheers mingled, as those left in the boat ceased firing, so as not 
to injure the boarding party, who made a desperate effort now 
to climb over the bamboo screen, little thinking that the missing 
midshipman had boldly climbed up a little ahead of where they 
were, mounted to the great bamboo spar that held up the screen, 
and then with a miserably ineffective weapon, to wit, his pocket- 
knife, set to work as he sat astride it, and sawn away at the 
rattans that held it up. 

It was a brave act, but an unlucky one. He had nearly 
succeeded in getting through, and he would have shouted out a 
warning, but that would have brought upon him the spears of the 
Malays ; so he cut away, and had been so successful that, as the 
boarding party made their desperate dash, down came the great 
bamboo with a rush. The screen went outwards, over the 

sailors, who fell back beneath it into the boat, while Bob 
Roberts felt himself describing a half circle in the air, before 
plunging out of semi-darkness into that which was total, as he 

went down, yards away from the boat, into the cold black watec 
one thought alone filling his mind, and that thought was¡ª 
crocodiles. 



CHAPTER X. 



HOW BOB ROBERTS WAS NOT DROWNED. 

For a few minutes it was a question of whether the boat would 
be swamped or no, as she lay beneath the great bamboo screen, 
which completely paralyzed the efforts of the crew. The prahu 
was still floating with the stream, and the boat being dragged 
along in her wake, while, awaking now to a sense of their 
assailants' position, the Malays hurriedly thrust out sweeps, and 
others fired, and hurled their spears, a couple of dozen of which 
stuck in the bamboo mat Dick in the stem, and a couple of 
the men in the bows, however, began a steady fire at the prahu, 
loading as rapidly as they could, while the men amidships cast 
off the awkward canopy, and, half stunned, but panting with rage 
and excitement, the lieutenant once more gave his orders. 

" Oars, lads !" he cried, "and give way. We shall have 'em yet" 

'* Boat ahoy 1 " came from out the darkness. 

" Why, that's young Roberts, sir," cried Dick. " Ahoy ¡ª y ¡ª y." 

" Help here ! " came from the stern again, 

" We shall lose the prahu," cried the lieutenant. 

*' But we must have Mr Roberts, sir," cried old Dick, ex- 
citedly. " Give the word, sir ¡ª stam all ¡ª and we'll overtake her 
arter wards." 

" Stam all, my lads, and do your best." 

" Ahoy ! " came once more, faintly, out of the darkness." 

"We're going away from him," cried the lieutenant "Pull 
round, my lads," he cried, seizing the tiller. " Now then, 
steady. Be smart there with a boat-hook. Roberts, ahoy ! " 

" Help, help," came again, from somewhere astern now, for 
the poor fellow was growing weak. 

For as he had plunged down, with the thought of the great 
reptiles uppermost in his mind, Bob Roberts had felt a chill of 
horror run through him that seemed for the moment to rob him 
of all power ; but as he rose to the surface again, and felt that he 
could breathe, he struck out manfully in the direction of the 




firing ; but in his confusion, after swimming for a minute, he 
found from the noise behind that he was making for the 
stockade, and he turned hastily to swim after the boat. 

It was no light task, dressed as he was. He had a sword in 
his belt, and on the other side a revolver, and his first thought 
was to rid himself of them ; but a strange feeling of dislike to 
parting with his weapons made him put off the act of throwing 
them away until he should feel that he was sinking ; so, guided 
by the flashes of the pieces that were being fired, he swam 
lustily in the direction in which he felt the boat must be. 

He called for help several times, but his voice was not heard 
by those to whom he appealed ; and as he felt himself being left 
behind, a cold chill of horror once more seized upon him, mak- 
ing his limbs seem heavy as lead, and paralyzing his efforts in a 
way that was terribly suggestive of death. 

Thoughts of the great slimy monsters being at hand to seize 
upon him, sent his blood rushing to his face in a way that made 
him giddy, and for a few moments he felt half mad with fear ; 
but calling upon his manhood, he mastered the nervous trepidation. 

" 'Taint English ¡ª 'taint game/' he cried aloud, with the water 
at his lip ; and checking the frantic desire to beat the surface 
with his hands in the natural last effort of a drowning creature, 
he swam steadily on, hailing the boat at intervals, but more and 
more feebly, as his despair increased ; for he felt that he was 
only a lad, and that his life was a mere nothing compared to a 
successful capture of the prahu. 

" They have gone after her," he groaned, as he uttered a de- 
spairing hail. And then the bright light of hope seemed to cross 

the darkness, for he heard a shout in reply, and then other 
answering hails to his cry for help, and he knew now that it was 
only a question of holding out till the boat could reach his side. 

Shouts came again and again out of the darkness, and he an- 
swered ¡ª each time more feebly, for his strength was ebbing fast. 
He could see the stars flashing in the water, and he fancied he 
could hear the splash of oars, and the sounds of voices ; then, 
too, he heard the crackle of distant musketry, and the roar of 
one of the boat guns. Then, as if he were in a dream, he could 
hear some one close at hand hailing him ¡ª but he could not 
answer now, only swim feebly on, with his clothes, and the 
weapons, and cartridges in his pouch, dragging him down. 

Then the stars above, and the stars on the water, seemed to be 
blotted out, and he was in utter darkness ¡ª strangling, but swim- 
ming still, beneath the stream. Then he seemed to see the stars 
again in a dim way^ and he heard a shout ; but he could not 




reply, for all was dark once more ; and lastly, in a dim misty 
state he felt a spasm, and a sensation of being dragged beneath the 
water, and he thought that one of the reptiles of the river had 
seized him ; and then he knew that he was lying in the bottom 
of the boat, and some one was pouring brandy between his lips. 

" I just ketched the glint of his white face under the water," 
said a voice which seemed to be Dick's, '* and ketched hold of 
his jacket. It was a near touch, and no mistake." 

" Give way, my lads, give way ! " was the next thing Bob 
Roberts heard ; and as if in a dream he made out that they were 
rowing fast in chase of the prahu, which, with all her sweeps out 
on either side, was going rapidly through the water, her object 
being to get down to the tidal way at the lower part of the river, 
where there were mangrove-fringed creeks and inlets by the 
hundred, offering her a secure hiding-place from her indefatigable 
assailant. 

" We shan't never ketch her, sir," growled Dick. 

" No," replied the lieutenant, sharply, " but we'll hang on to 
her to the last How far are we now from the steamer ? " 

" Not two miles, I should think, sir.*' 

" Make ready then, marines,*' he cried, " and fire after her ; 
hit her, if you can. Two fire at a time ¡ª mind, slowly and steadily. 
They will hear it on board, and be on the look-out, and if they 
don't sink her as she goes by them, why, it's a wonder." 

Almost directly after there was the report of a couple of rifles, 
and then two more at half-minute intervals, while right on ahead, 
in the darkness, they could hear the heavy beat of the prahu's 
sweeps, and knew that she was going more rapidly than they. 

"How are you now, Roberts?*' said the lieutenant, kindly. 

'* Coming round, Mr Johnson," said Bob. " Thank'ye for 
picking me up." 

^' Keep your thanks for to-morrow, Roberts," said the lieutenant, 
bitterly. ** How vexation's to make such a mess of the affair? " 

"There's another one a-coming, sir," said Dick, softly. "You 
can hear the oars beating right behind us, sir.'' 

The lieutenant listened. 

"There must be a great curve in the river here," he said, 
" one that we did not notice in the fog." 

"Then it's a precious big curve, sir, that's all I can say," 
exclaimed old Dick; " for if that ain't t'other prahu coming down, 
with all sweeps out, I'm a Dutchman." 

" They never can have failed the same as we have," exclaimed 
the lieutenant, listening. " No ¡ª yes ¡ª no. You are right, Dick, 
my man. Cease firing there. Make ready, my lads, and we'll 




plump every shot we have into this one as she comes abreast, 
and then lay the boat alongside, and board her in the confusion. 
Be ready, my lads, and then, you know, down with your rifles. 
Cutlasses must do it afterwards." 

A few minutes of intense excitement followed, during which 
time every man sat with his finger on the trigger, listening to the 
regular beat of the prahu's long oars as she came sweeping down 
at a rapid rate, evidently bent upon making her escape, like her 
consort, out to sea. 

** If we only had a bow gun," muttered the lieutenant, " No ; 
you be still, Roberts," he continued; "you are weak and done up." 

" I think I could manage a rifle now, Mr Johnson," said the 
lad, with his teeth chattering from cold, 

" I don't," was the abrupt reply. " Now, my lads, not a sound; 
we have a disgrace to wipe out, and this prahu must be ours." 

By this time the long swift boat was rapidly approaching, 
quite invisible to the little party of English, but audible enough ; 
and they waited eagerly till it seemed as if she was bearing 
down upon them, when, with a short, sharp warning first to be 
ready, the lieutenant gave the word Fire I when about fifteen 
rifles went off almost like one, their flashes lighting up the dark- 
ness for an instant, and displaying close upon them the long 
dark prahu, with a long bank of oars, coming down fast. 

" Oars ! GivQ way 1 *' shouted the lieutenant ; and almost as he 
spoke, the prahu changed her course so rapidly that there was 
but little rowing needed, for instead of avoiding them, the vessel 
came right at the English boat, trying to run her down, being so 
nearly successful that she ripped her down to the water's edge 
just by the bows. There was a crash of breaking oars ; but the 
Malay boat dashed rapidly away, leaving the English helpless 
and sinking on the river. 

" Catch this boat cloak," cried the lieutenant who was ready 
enough in the emergency. ** Stuff" it in, and one of you sit back 
against it." 

" It'll take two on us, sir," cried the man, who rapidly obeyed 
orders, and to some extent checked the rush of water. 

"Two of you begin baling," cried the lieutenant next; and 
then, as he saw that all their efforts would only just keep them 
afloat, "There, my lads," he said, "we've done our best. One 
more volley and then I think we had better run her ashore." 

Another volley was fired, to give warning to the steamer that 
there was something extraordinary on the way, and then the 
boat's head was turned to the shore ; but as they found that by 
constant baling they could just keep afloat, the lieutenant altered 




their direction, and they rowed on, with the gunwale nearly level 
with the water's edge, and proceeding very slowly, but ever 
carried by the stream nearer to the steamer and the isle. 

" A nice night's work, Roberts," said the lieutenant dolefully, 
as they sat deep in the water that washed from side to side ; 
" lost both prahus, and got the boat crippled." 

"But we haven't lost any men, sir/' said Bob, by way of com^ 
forting him. 

" No ; but several of the poor lads are wounded. There's 
only one thing that would give me any comfort for my ill-luck, 
Roberts, and that is to hear ¡ª " 

"There's the 'Startler' a talking to one, sir," cried Dick, for- 
getting discipline in his excitement, as the boom of a big gun 
not very far off met their ears. " There she goes again, sir," he 
continued, as there was another shot, and another, and another, 
all showing that the captain had heard the firing and been 
prepared. 

A couple more shots were heard, and then all was silent till 
the boat slowly drifted by the lights of the island, answering the 
sentries' challenges, and then sighting the lights and open port- 
holes of the steamer, to whose side they managed to struggle, 
answering the challenges as they approached. 

In spite of all their efforts, it was doubtful whether the boat 
could have floated another minute, but on reaching the side the 
falls were hooked on, and she was slowly run up to the davits, 
with the water rushing out, the lieutenant then reporting his ill- 
success to the captain. 

" Not one man killed, though," he said. 

** How many wounded ? " 

" Six, sir, but only slightly." 

"Mr Johnson, I hope the other boats have done better," said 
the captain. " I'm afraid you will not get any promotion on the 
strength of this job." 

"No, sir," said the lieutenant dolefully. " But did, you sink 
either of the prahus ? " 

" Sink them, no," said the captain, testily. " I don't believe 
they were either of them touched ; they went by us like the wind 
There, go below all of you, and get into dry clothes." The 
captain went forward to see that the look-out was doing its 
best ; while the prahus were safely making their way to a mud 
creek, where the chiefs who commanded them felt that they 
could laugh at any force the English might send to redeem the 
feilure of the past night; and to work such mischief in the 
future as was little imagined at the time. 



CHAPTER XL 



HOW BOB ROBERTS HAD A LESSON ON COMMON SENSE. 

The sun rose over the dense forest, turning the river mists into 
gauzy veils, that floated rapidly away, leaving the rapid stream 
sparkling in the soft morning breeze. The brightly-coloured 
parroquets flew shrieking from bank to bank ; and in the thick 
jungle, across from the end of the island the noisy chattering of 
a party of monkeys could be heard. 

But bright as was the scene in all the gorgeous tints of tropic 
scenery, no one on the isle or in the steamer had a thought for 
anything but the expedition. At the residency, Rachel Linton 
and her cousin had watched the starting of the boats in the dim 
starlight, and they had sat ever since at their window, listening 
for tidings. The noise of the distant firing had reached them, 
making their breath come short as they started at each volley. 
Even by the very faintly-heard pattering of the small arms, 
broken occasionally by the loud report of boat-gun or lelah, they 
knew that quite a sharp fight must be raging. 

Twice over they were visited by the major's wife, for the 
major could not rest, but kept going to the steamer to consult 
with Captain Horton as to whether they had done everything 
possible to ensure success. 

Mrs Major Sandars found the two ladies pale and anxious to 
a degree ; and though she refrained from saying so, she shook 
her head, telling herself that this excess of anxiety was due to 
something more than the absence of a father and uncle, espe- 
cially as the resident was not a fighting man. 

She sat with them for long at a time, trying to comfort them^ 
as she saw their agitation, and then grew as anxious herself,, 
especially when the tide of the little war swept their way, and she 
heard the volleys fired from the boat, as the two prahus came 
down the stream. 

At last, just as a couple of Malay fishermen had been en- 
gaged to help pilot the steamer up the river, where Captain; 



Horton had determined to go in quest of the missing expedition, 
the sentry at the point of the island challenged, and the ship's 
boats were seen coming round a point, the sun gleaming brightly 
on the barrels of the rifles, while the white jackets and frocks of 
the soldiers and sailors gave life to a scene that was one series of 
variously tinted greens. 

Glasses were brought to bear, and it was evident that it was no 
dejected beaten party returning, for no sooner did they see that 
they were observed than the men began cheering, their shouts 
bringing the Malays flocking down to the liver side, where 
several chiefs were seen embarking in a naga, or dragon-boat, 
eager, though looking very stolid, to hear the news. 

It was on the whole good, for on the party landing it was to 
announce that they had, after a sharp fight, captured the 
stockade, driving the Malays, who were headed by the Rajah 
Gantang himself, to take refuge in another stockade, in a ravine 
some three miles inland, and then the river fort was set on fire. 

The officer who had attacked the second prahu had met with 
similar ill success to Lieutenant Johnson, and upon relating the 
incidents of the fight, found but little sympathy from the late 
occupants of the other boat, who were rather rejoiced to find 
they had not been excelled. 

The escape of the second prahu was followed by a short 
council ; and several Malays being found ready enough to act 
as guides to the stockade to which the rajah and his men had 
fled, it was decided to follow him up, and read him a second 
severe lesson. 

It was a risky proceeding, for the guides might prove treach- 
erous and lead them into an ambush; but after giving them 
notice that they would receive no mercy if they proved false, a 
small portion of the little force was left in charge of the boats, 
and, lightly equipped, the men went off in search of the second 
stronghold. 

It proved to be an arduous task, for the way was through one 
of the jungle paths, with walls of dense vegetation right and 
left, of the most impenetrable nature. Every here and there, 
too, the enemy had cut down a tree, so that it fell with the 
branches towards the pursuers, who were compelled to force a 
way through the dense mass that choked the narrow path. 

But these impediments were laughed at by the Jacks, who 
hacked and hewed, and soon made a passage, through which, 
in the darkness of the forest, the little force crept on till they 
halted, panting, for the Malay guides to go on first, and act the 
part of scouts. 



" Perhaps to give waxning 01 our coming," said Captain 
Smith ers. 

*' No," said Tom Long, ** I don't think that. I should say 
that they have had spies out all along the path, and that they 
know our position to an inch." 

"You are right, Long," said Captain Smithers, as, one after 
the other, several reports rang out "They are firing on our 

friendly Malays." 

So it proved, for the men came running back to say that they 
had been fired upon as soon as tacy neared the stockade; and 
now, as there was no chance of a surprise, the men were divided, 
and, each party under its leader, started off to try and flank the 

place. 

This was something new to the Malays, who looked upon it 
as unfair fighting, and the result was, that after five minutes' 
sharp, hand-to-hand engagement, the rajah and his men once 
more took to the woods, and the second stockade was burned. 

This was so satisfactory a termination, that it seemed to make 
up for the loss of the two prahus. These, however, Captain 
Horton said the ship's boats would soon hunt out; and the 
Malay chiefs went back to the sultan, to announce to him the 
defeat of his old enemy ; while at the island every one was occupied 
about th.Q hospital and the wounded men, who, poor fellows, were 
carefully lifted ashore, the doctor saying that the sailors would 
be far better on the island, in a tent beneath the shady trees, 
than on shipboard. 

"Ten wounded, major," he said sharply, *'and not a man 
dangerously. I'll soon set them right. Steady there, my boys; 
lift them carefully." 

A goodly group had assembled by the landing-place when the 
men were brought ashore, the ladies being ready with fruit and 
cool drink for the poor fellows; and Bob Roberts, who had come 
to the landing-place with Captain Horton in the gig, felt quite 
envious. 

An hour or two's sleep had set him right, and he felt none the 
worse for his adventure ; but there was Tom Long being lifted 
carefully ashore by two of the sailors, and Rachel Linton and 
Mary Sinclair eagerly waiting on the youth, for he had received 
a real wound this time, and looked most interestingly pale. 

"Just like my luck," grumbled Bob. "He gets comfortably 
wounded, and they will be taking him fruit and flowers every 
day. I shouldn't wonder if they had him carried up to the 
residency, so that he would be handy, and ¡ª hang me if it ain't 
too bad Oh J 'pon my word, I can't stand this; they are 



having him carried up to the house. Just my luck. I get a 
contemptible ducking, and no one wants to wait upon me." 

Bob ground his teeth and looked on, while Torn Long was 
sympathized with and talked to on his way up to the residency, 
where, after swallowing his wrath, as the middy expressed it, he 
got leave to go up and see his friend. 

" My friend 1 " he said, half aloud, as he walked on through 
the brilliant sunshine. " Lor', how I do hate that fellow ! I wish 
I had had the kris. I'd have given the Malay such a oner as he 
wouldn't have forgotten in a hurry. Poor old Tommy, though ! 
I hope he isn't hurt much. How do you do, Miss Linton ? " he 
said stiffly, as he encountered Rachel Linton in the verandah. 

" Quite well, I thank you, Mr Roberts," said Rachel, imitating 
his pompous stiffness, and curtseying profoundly; "how do you 

do?" 

** Oh 1 I say; don't. Miss Linton. What a jolly shame it is," 
he cried, throwing off all form. "You always laugh and poke 
fun at me." 

" Not I, Mr Roberts," she replied. " When you are stiff and 
formal, I shape my conduct to suit yours ; when you come as the 
nice, frank, manly boy that we are always so glad to see, I am 
sure I never laugh at you then." 

" Boy ? Yes, of course, you always treat me like a boy," said 
Bob, dolefully. " Is a fellow never going to be a man ? " 

"Far too soon, I should think," said Miss Linton, holding out 
her hand. 

" Oh ! I'm only a boy," said Bob, stuffing his hands in his 
pockets, and looking so sadly injured, and in so comical a way, 
that Miss Linton could hardly refrain from laughing. 

" Such a boy as I'm sure we are all very proud of," said Miss 
Linton. "We have heard from my father and Lieutenant 
Johnson how bravely you behaved last night." 

" Gammon 1 " said Bob, blushing scarlet. '^ I only behaved 
like a boy. How is the wounded man you have had brought up 
here ¡ª Mr Ensign Long ? " 

" Poor boy I " said Rachel Linton quietly ; " he has a nasty 

wound." 

" Say that again. Miss Linton," cried Bob excitedly; " it does 

me good." 

" He has a nasty wound. Are you so pleased, then, that your 
friend is badly hurt ? " said Miss Linton gravely. 

" No, no ; of course not. I mean the other," cried Bob, 

"Why, what did I say?" 

" You said ' Poor boy ! ' " exclaimed the middy. 




" Of course I did," said Miss Linton, raising her eyebrows. 

'* Say it again, please," said Bob. 

" Poor boy ! I am very sorry for him." 

" That does me a deal of good," cried Bob excitedly. " You 
know I can't stand it, Miss Linton, for you to think of him as a 
man and of me as only a boy." 

"Why, you silly, foolish boyl" she said, laying her hand upon 
his shoulder, and gazing full in his face, " of course I think of 
you both as what you are ¡ª a pair of very brave lads, who will 
some day grow to be officers of whom England will be very proud." 

*' If ¡ª if I'm not a man now," said Bob, in a low, husky voice, 
" I shall never grow to be one," 

"Not grow to be a man? Why, what do you mean?" said 
Miss Linton. 

"I don't know," faltered Bob, "only that it's precious miser- 
able, and ¡ª and I wish one of the jolly old Malays would stick his 
old kris right through my heart, for there don't seem anything 
worth living for when one can't have what one wants." 

Rachel Linton gazed at him half sad and half amused. 

" Do you wish me to think of you, Robert Roberts, with respect 
and esteem ? " 

" I'd give all the world to be one of your dogs, Miss Linton, 
or your bird." 

" Do you mean to be a goose ? '* said Miss Linton, laughing. 

" There, I did not mean to hurt your feelings," she added frankly; 

"but come, now, give up all this silly nonsense, and try to 

remember that you are after all but a boy, whom I want to look 

upon as a very dear friend." 

" Do you really ? " said Bob. 

" I do, really," said Miss Linton, holding out her hand ; " a 

friend whom I can believe in and trust, out in this dangerous 

place, and one who will not make my life wretched by being 

silly, romantic, and sentimental." 

Bob gripped the hand extended to him, and held it for a few 
moments. 

"There," he said firmly, as he seemed to shake himself 
together, " I see it now. It's all right, Miss Linton ; and it's 
better to be a brick of a boy than a weak, puling noodle of a 
man, isn't it ? " 

" Indeed it is," cried Miss Linton, laughing merrily. 

** There, I'm your man ¡ª I mean I'm your boy," cried Bob; 
" and I'll let you see that I'm a very different fellow to what you 
think. Now I want to go and see poor old Tom Long. I am 
sorry he's hurt" 




" You are now more like the Bob Roberts, midshipwa?," said 
Miss Linton, " whom I saw first some months ago, than I have 
seen for a long time." 

" All right," said Bob ; " now let's go and see the other poor 
boy." 

*' Come along, then," she said, smiling ; *' but I'm afraid, that 
Tom Long will not be so easy to convince that he has not yet 
arrived at years of discretion." 

As she spoke Miss Linton softly opened the door unseen, and 
let Bob Roberts enter a cool and airy well-shaded room, closing 
the door upon him, and herself gliding away. 



CHAPTER XII. 



A DISCUSSION UPON WOUNDS. 

*' Avast there ! what cheer, my hearty ? Heave ahead, my 
military swab. How goes it I " cried Bob, as Tom raised himself 
a little on his couch, evidently very glad to see his old companion. 

" Oh, not quite killed," he said. " Gently ; don't shake a 
fellow to pieces." 

" Where's the wound ? " cried Bob, " Ain't going to send in 
the number of your mess, are you ? " 

"No, I'm not," cried Tom Long, flushing up; "and if I ever 
do come across the chief fellow who gave me such a nasty dig, 
he'll remember it to the end of his days." 

" What was it¡ª a spear or a kris ? " said Bob. 

" Kris, right through my left shoulder. Doctor Bolter says if 
it had been four inches lower it would have been fatal." 

" Bother / " cried Bob. " If it had been four inches higher it 
would have missed you altogether." 

" Yes, of course," said Tom ; " but it's precious unpleasant to 
have a fellow stick his skewer right through you." 

"Well, I don't know," said Bob, who had made up his mind 
that the proper thing was to try and cheer the ensign, and not 
to let him think he was very bad. "I think I'd just as soon 
have it right through as only half way." 

" Oh, it's nothing to laugh at, I can tell you," said Tom Long, 
*' I don't see why you mightn't just as well have had it as me. 
You always get off all right." 

" I didn't last night, or rather this morning," said Bob. *' I 
was right into the prahu we tried to take ¡ª first man, sir ¡ª I mean 
boy, sir ; and I was sawing away at a mat with my knife, when 

all came down by the run, and I was pitched into the river," 
" And picked out," said the ensign impatiently. 
"Yes, but not before I'd been swimming for a quarter of an 

hour ¡ª good measure. Oh, I say, Tom, didn't I think of 
the crocodiles ! " 




" You're such a cheeky little beggar, I wonder they didn't get 
you," said Tom, who looked feverish and excited. " I say, Bob 
Roberts, you know what that chap, that Kling fellow, said to us 
about the krises." 

" Yes, of course. What then ? " 

" Do you think they are poisoned ? " 

"No, not a bit. Do you?" 

" Yes," said the young ensign ; " and I am sure this one was, 
for I can feel the wound throbbing and stabbing, and a curious 
sensation running to my finger ends." 

" Well, so one did when one had a bad cut," said Bob sharply. 
" Bah ! poisoned ! it's all rubbish. Why, if you had been 
poisoned you'd have been sleepy and stupid." 

" I feel so now." 

" AVhat ¡ª stupid ? " said Bob, grinning. " Well that's natural : 
you always were ? " 

" I can't get up and cane you. Bob Roberts," said the ensign, 
slowly. 

" Of course you can't, old maa But there, don't you worry ; 
that kris wasn't poisoned, or you'd feel very different to what 
you do now." 

"Think so?" 

"Sure of it." 

" How do you know ? " said Tom Long, peevishly. " You 
were never wounded by a poisoned weapon." 

" No, but I've seen somebody else, and watched him." 

"What was he wounded with ? " 

? Serpent's tooth," said Bob ; " Private Gray." 

" Why, that's a different thing altogether," said Long, 

" No it isn't, Mr Clevershakes. The snake's poison goes into 
the blood, don't it, same as that of a kris, and the symptoms 
would be just the same." 

Tom Long seemed to think there was something in this, and 
he lay thinking for a minute. 

" How did Gray look ? " he said. " I don't remember." 

" Just the same as you don't look," said Bob, sharply ; " so 
don't be a stupid and frighten yourself worse. Malay krises are 
not poisoned, and it's all a cock-and-bull story," 

" What is ? " said Doctor Bolter, entering the room. 

" About krises being poisoned, doctor." 

Doctor BoltCT felt his patient's pulse. 

" Have you been putting him up to thinking his wound was 
poisoned ? " he said, angrily. 

" No, doctor," said Tom Long, quietly ; " it was my idea, and 
I feel sure it is." 




" Tom Long," said Doctor Bolter, " you're only a boy, and if 
you weren't so ill, I'd box your ears. YouVe been frightening 
yourself into a belief that you are poisoned, and here's your pulse 
up, the dickens knows how high. Now look here, sir, what's 
the use of your placing yourself in the hands of a surgeon, and 
then pretending to know better yourself ? " 

" I don't pretend, doctor." 

" Yes, you do, sir. You set up a theory of your own that your 
blood is poisoned, in opposition to mine that it is not." 

" But are you sure it is not, doctor ? " 

** Am I sure? Why, by this time if that kris had been poisoned 
you would have had lock-jaw." 

" And Locke on the Understanding," put in Bob. 

*' Yes," laughed the doctor ; " and been locked up altogether. 
There, there, my dear boy, keep yourself quiet, and trust me to 
bring you round. You, Bob Roberts, don't let him talk, and 
don't talk much yourself. You'd better go to sleep, Long." 

"Wound pains me too much, doctor. It throbs so. Isn't 
that a sign of poison ? " 

" I'll go and mix you up a dose of poison that shall send you 
to sleep for twelve hours, my fine fellow, if you don't stop all that 
nonsense. Your wound is not poisoned, neither is that of any 
other man who came back from the expedition ; and if it's any 
satisfaction to you to know it, you've got the ugliest dig of any 
man ¡ª I mean boy ¡ª amongst the wounded." 

The doctor arranged the matting screen so as to admit more 
air, and bustled towards the door ¡ª but stopped short on hearing 
a buzzing sound at the open window, went back on tiptoe, and 
cleverly captured a large insect 

" A splendid longicom," he said, fishing a pill-box from his 
pocket, and carefully imprisoning his captive. " Ah, my dear 
boys, what a pity it is that you do not take to collecting while you 
are young ! What much better men you would make ! " 

** There," said Bob, as soon as they were alone, "how do you 
feel about your poison now ? " 

*' He says it is not, just to cheer me up," said Tom Long, 
dolefully. " I say, Bob Roberts, if I die¡ª" 

" If you what ? " cried Bob, in a tone of disgust. 

" I say, if I die." 

"Oh, ah, of course. Now then, let's have it. Do you want 
me to write a verse for your tombstone ? " 

" They'd pitch me overboard," said Long, dolefully. 

" Not they," said Bob. " This promising young officer, who 
had taken it into his head that he had been wounded by a 



poisoned kris, was buried under a palm tree, to the great relief 
of all who knew him, for they found him the most conceited ¡ª " 

" Bob Roberts ! " 

" Consequential ¡ª " 

" I tell you what it is ¡ª " 

" Cocky¡ª" 

" I never heard ¡ª " 

"Unpleasant fellow that ever wore Her Majesty's uniform." 

"Just wait till I get well, Master Bob Roberts," said Tom 
Long, excitedly, " and if I don't make you pay for all this, my 
name's not what it is." 

"Thought you had made up your mind to die," said Bob, 
laughing. " There, it won't do, young man ; so now go to sleep. 
I've got another half-hour, and 1*11 sit here and keep the flies 
from visiting your noble corpus too roughly ; and when you 
wake up, if you find I am not here it is because I am gone. 
D'ye hear ? '[ 

" Yes," said Tom Long, drowsily ; and in five minutes he was 
fast asleep, seeing which Bob sat till the last minute, and then 
went out on tiptoe to run and learn whether the boat was wait- 
ing by the landing-stage. 



CHAPTER XIII. 



AN UNPLEASANT INTERRUPTION. 

The feeling of satisfaction was very general at the lesson given 
the rajah ; and though his two prahus had escaped, his power 
had received a most severe blow. 

Sultan Hamet was sincere enough in his demonstrations of 
pleasure, sending presents five or six times a day to the resident, 
the various officers, and, above all, fruit for the wounded men. 

The presents were but of little value, but they showed the 
Malay's gratitude, and the officers were very pleased with what 
they looked upon as curiosities. Even Bob Roberts and Tom 
Long were not forgotten, each receiving an ivory-mounted kris, 
the young chief Ali being the bearer. 

The resident, however, felt that the sultan was not meeting 

him in quite a proper spirit, and he was rather suspicious, till a 

fresh embassy of the principal chiefs arrived, and brought a 

formal invitation for the resident and the officers to visit him 

upon a fixed day. 

As before, an imposing force was got ready, and once more 
the march to what Bob had nick-named Palm Tree Palace, took 

place, the middy coming afterwards to Tom Long's room, and 

telling him how the affair had gone off. 

" It was no end of a game," he said to the young ensign, who 
was rajjidly gaining strength, the fancy that his wound was 
poisoned having passed away. " We started just as we did last 
time, and marched through the jungle till we came to the sultan's 
bams, where the men were drawm up, and no end of the niggers 
came to wait on them, bringing them a kind of drink made of 
rice, and plenty of fruit and things, while we officers had to go 
into the sultan's dining-room ¡ª a place hung round with cotton 
print ¡ª and there we all sat down, cross-legged, like a lot of jolly 
tailors, with the sultan up at the top, the major on one side, and 
our skipper on tlie other." 

" But they didn't sit down cross-legged ? " said Tom Long. 



" Didn't they, my boy ? But they just did ; and it was a game 
to see our skipper letting himself down gently for fear of cracking 
his best white uniform sit-in-ems. Your major split some stitches 
somewhere, for I heard them go. Then there was the doctor ? 
you should have seen him ! He came to an anchor right 
enough, but when he tried to square his yards ¡ª I mean his legs 
¡ª he nearly went over backwards, and looked savage enough to 
eat me, because I laughed." 

** Poor old doctor !" said Tom Long, smiling. 

" Oh, we were all in difficulties, being cast upon our beam 
ends as it were ; but we got settled down in our berths at last, 
and then the dinner began." 

" Was it good ? " said Tom Long, whose appetite was growing 
as he began to get better. 

" Jolly ! " said Bob, " capital 1 I say, though, how hot this 
place is." 

"Yes," said the ensign, "the lamp makes it hotj but the 
window is wide open." 

Bob glanced out into the darkness, to see the dark gleaming 
leaves, and the bright fire-flies dancing in the air, while right 
before them lay the smooth river, reflecting the brilliant stars. 

" There was no cloth ; but it was no end of fun. Mr Sultan 
is going in for English manners and customs, and he mixes them 
up with his own most gloriously. By way of ornaments there 
was a common black japanned cruet-stand, with some trumpery 
bottles. There was one of those brown earthenware teapots, and 
an old willow-pattern soup tureen, without cover or stand, but 
full of flowers. Besides which, there were knives and forks, and 
spoons, regular cheap Sheffield kitchen ones, and as rusty as an 
old ringbolt. 

" Indeed 1 " said Tom Long. 

" I looked at our officers, and they had hard work to keep 
solemn ; and I half expected to see a pound of sausages, and 
some potatoes in their skins, for the banquet. But wait a bit ; 
those were the English things brought out in compliment to us. 
Mr Sultan had plenty of things of his own, some of silver, some 
of gold. He had some beautiful china too ; and the feed itself ¡ª 
tiatl^^ said Bob, smacking his lips. "I wish you had been there." 

" I wish I had," sighed Tom Long. " Getting welVs worse 
than being wounded." 

"Never mind; you'll soon be all right," continued Bob. 
" Well, we had some good fish, nicely cooked, and some stunning 
curry ; the best I ever ate ; and we had sambals, as they call 
*em, with it" 





"What the dickens are sambals?" said Tom Long. 

" Well, it*s either pickles or curry, whichever you like to call 
it,*' continued Bob. " These sambals are so many little saucers on 
a silver tray, and they are to eat with your curry. One had 
smashed up cocoa-nut in milk ; another chillies ; another dried 
shrimps, chutney, green ginger, no end of things of that kind ¡ª 
and jolly good they were ! Then we had rice in all sorts of 
shapes, and some toddy and rice wine, and some sweets of sago, 
and cocoa-nut and sugar." 

" But you didn't eat all those things?" said Tom Long, peevishly. 

"Didn't I, my boy? but I just did. I thought once that the 
sultan might be going to poison us all ; and, as they say there's 
safety in a big dose, and death in a small, I went in for a regular 
big go. But I say, the fruits I they were tip-top : mangosteens 
and guavas, and mangoes, and cocoa-nuts, and durians, and some 
of the best bananas I ever ate in my life." 

" You didn't try one of those filthy durians again ? " 

** Bless 'em, that I did ; and I mean to try *em again and 
again, as long as a heart beats in the bosom of yours very faith- 
fully, Bob Roberts. They're glorious ! " 

*' Bah 1 " 

" That's right," said Bob. " You say * Bah T and VU eat the 
durians. But I didn't tell you about the drinks. We had coifee, 
and pipes, and cigars, and said pretty things to each other ; and 
then the sultan told Mr Linton he was going to bring out some 
choice English nectar in our honour." 

" And did he ? " 

" He just did, my boy. A nigger came round with a little 
silver tray, covered with tiny gold cups in which was something 
thick and red." 

" Liqueur, I suppose," said Tom Long, uneasily, 

"Wait a wee, dear boy," said Bob. ** Here's the pyson at 
last, I says to myself; and when my turn came, I did as the 
others did, bowed to the sultan, feeling just like a tombola, and 
nearly going over ; then I drank ¡ª and what do you think it was ? " 

" I don't know; go on." 

" Raspberry vinegar, and ¡ª ah ! " 

Tom Long started back, looking deadly white in the feeble 
light of the lamp ; for, as Bob ejaculated loudly, a Malay spear 
whizzed past his ear, and stuck in the wooden partition behind 
him, having evidently been thrown through the window by some 
lurlung foe. 



CHAPTER XIV. 



HOW BOB ROBERTS MADE A FIRM FRIEND. 

Bob Roberts seized his sword and dashed to the window, leap- 
ing boldly out, and shouting for help ; and as he did so he heard 
the bushes rapidly parted, the crackling of twigs on ahead, and 
then, as he neared the river in pursuit of the assailant, there was 
a loud splash, followed by the challenge of a sentry and the 
report of his piece. 

A brisk time of excitement followed, during which a thorough 
search was made, but no one was found ; and it was evident that 
the spear had been thrown by an enemy who had come alone ; 
but the incident was sufficient to create a general feeling of 
uneasiness at the residency. The sentries -were doubled, and 
orders were given that the place should be carefully patrolled ; 
for though the English were upon an island, the Malays were 
such expert swimmers that they could start up stream and let 
themselves float down to the head of the island and land. 

It was some few days before Bob Roberts was able to pay 
another visit to the residency, for he had been out twice with the 
steamer's boats, in search of the two escaped Malay prahus, each 
time on insufficient information ; and after a weary pull through 
a winding mangrove creek, had come back without seeing them. 

Meantime the relations with the Malays were daily growing in 
friendliness. A brisk trade with the shore was carried on, and 
sampans from far up the river came laden with fruit, fish, and 
rice; some brought poultry, and green sugar-cane for eating; 
others cocoa-nuts, and quaint articles for barter. But somehow 
there was an uneasy feeling on the island, that though the sultan 
and his people were friendly, some of the rajahs detested the 
English, as being likely to put a stop to their piratical practices, 
the destruction of Rajah Gantang's stockade, while it gave plenty 

of satisfaction in some parts, being looked upon with disfavour 

in others. 





" Pretty well all right again, old man ? " said Bob, sauntering 
in one day, to find the ensign reading. 

" Yes, I*m stronger by a good deal than I was," said Tom 
Long, holding out his hand. 

** No more limbings pitched in at the window, eh ? " 

"No,*' said Tom Long with a slight shudder; '* I hope that 
sort of thing is not going to happen again." 

" To which I say ditto," said Bob. " But I say, I know who 
pitched that spear at you," 

" You do ? " 

"Yes, it was that Malay chap you offended with the durian." 

" Then he must be taken and punished." 

" First catch your brown hare, master officer of infantry," said 

Bob, smiling. " He won't set foot here again, depend upon it, 

unless he slinks in at night. By George, what a malicious lot 

they must be, to act like that ! " 

" Yes, it*s not pleasant," said Tom Long, with an involuntary 

shudder, as, in imagination, he saw the dark face of his enemy 

always on the watch for an opportunity to assassinate him. 

" I never finished my account of the trip to the sultan's," said 
Bob, at last 

" Was there anything more to tell ? " 

"Yes, one thing," replied Bob; "the best of the whole lot." 

" What was it ? " 

" Don't get riled if I tell you." 

" Pooh I how can it rile me ? " 

" Oh, I don't know ; only it may. It was a proposal made by 
the sultan to Mr Linton." 

" Proposal ! What proposal ? " 

" Well, I'll tell you ; only don't go into fits. It was after we'd 
been sitting smoking for a bit, and just before we were coming 
away. Master Sultan had shown us all his best things ¡ª his gold 
and silver, and his slaves, and the dingy beauties with great ear- 
rings, and bangles on their arms and legs, who have the honour 
of being his wives ; and at last he said something to Mr Linton, 
who understands his lingo as well as you and I do French." 

"Well, but what did he propose?" said Long, eagerly. 

" I got to know afterwards from Captain Smithers," continued 
Bob, "that he said he had been thinking very seriously about his 
position in connexion with the English, and that he saw how a 
strong alliance would be best for all ; that it would settle him in 
his government, and make it a very excellent match for the 
English, who would be able to get tin and rice from the sultan's 
people, and gold." 




"You're as prosy as an old woman," said Tom Long, im- 
patiently. 

"Yes, it's an accomplishment of mine," said Bob coolly. 
*' Well, as I was telling you, he said the proper thing was a very 
strong alliance ; and the resident said we had already made one. 
He said he wanted a stronger one; and he thought the best 
thing would be for him to marry Miss Linton and her cousin, 
and then it would be all right." 

** Why, confound his insolence 1 '* said Tom Long, starting up. 

" No, no, you must say something else," cried Bob. " I said 
that as soon as I heard it." 

" Did not Mr Linton knock him down ? " cried Tom Long. 

" No, he did not. He heard him out, and said it must be a 
matter of consideration ; and then we came away." 

" But it*s monstrous ! " cried Tom Long. 

" Of course it is," said Bob, coolly ; " but don't you see it was 
of no use to break with the fellow at once. It was a case of 
diplomacy. We don't want to quarrel with Master Sultan 
Hamet : we want to keep friends." 

" But it was such an insult to the ladies ! " 

" He looked as if he thought he was doing them an honour, 
Master Long, so it wouldn't have done to fall out with him. 
There, don't look so fierce, we've got a difficult game to play here, 
and our great point is not to quarrel with the Malays, unless we 
want spears thrown in at every dark window while we stay." 

Tom Long sat biting his nails, for Bob had touched him in a 
very tender part, and he knew it. In fact, the middy rather 
enjoyed his companion's vexation, for he had begun, since his 
memorable conversation with Miss Linton, to look upon his feel- 
ings towards her with a more matter-of-fact eye. 

** I shall have to get about at once," said Tom Long, speak- 
ing as if his weight in the scale would completely make Sultan 
Hamet kick the beam ; but upon seeing the mirthful look in Bob 
Roberts' eye, he changed the subject, and began talking about 
bow he longed to be out and about again. 

" I thought we should get no end of fishing and shooting out 
here," he said, " and we've had none as yet." 

" Get well, then, and we'll have a try for some," Bob suggested. 
"There must be plenty ;" and with the understanding that the 
ensign was to declare himself fit to be off the doctor's hands as 
soon as possible, Bob Roberts returned to the steamer, and then 
finding it terribly close, he did what he had acquired a habit of 
doing when the weather was very hot, found a snug shady place 
on deck, and went off to sleep. 




That was very easy in those latitudes. Whether the sun shone 
or whether it was gloomy, black, and precursive of a thunder- 
storm, an European had only to sit down in a rocking chair, or 
swing in a hammock, and he went off into a delicious slumber 
almost on the instant 

So far so good ; the difficulty was to keep asleep ; and so Bob 
Roberts found. 

He had settled himself in a low basket-work chair, beneath a 
stout piece of awning which shed a mellow twilight upon the 
deck, and loosening his collar, he had dropped off at once; 
but hardly was he asleep before "burr ¡ª r ¡ª r boom ¡ª m ¡ª m, 
boozz ¡ª zz ¡ª zz'' came a great fly, banging itself against the 
awning, sailing round and round, now up, now down, as if Bob's 
head were the centre of its attraction, and he could not get 
farther away. Now it seemed to have made up its mind to beat 
itself to pieces against the canvas, and now to try how near it 
could go to the midshipman's nose without touching, and keep- 
ing up all the time such an aggravating, irritating buzz that it 
woke Bob directly. 

There was plenty of room for the ridiculous insect to have 
flown right out from beneath the awning and over the flashing 
river to the jungle; but no, that did not seem to suit its ideas, 
and it kept on with its monotonous buzz, round and round, and 
round and round. 

Half awake, half asleep. Bob fidgetted a little, changed his 
position, and with his eyes shut hit out sharply at his tormentor, 
but of course without effect 

He turned over, turned back ; laid his head on one side ; then 
on the other ; and at last, as the miserable buzzing noise con- 
tinued, he jumped up in a rage, picked up a book for a weapon, 
and followed the fly about, trying to get a fair blow ¡ª but all in 
vain. He hit at it flying, settled on the canvas roof, on the arms 
of chairs, and on the deck, and twice upon a rope ¡ª but all in 
vain : the wretched insect kept up its irritating buzz, till, hot, 
panting, his brows throbbing with the exertion, Bob made a 
furious dash at it, and with one tremendous blow crushed it flat 

The middy drew a long breath, wiped the perspiration from 
his forehead, and, panting and weary, threw himself back in the 
chair, and closed his eyes. 

He was a clever sleeper, Bob Roberts. Like the Irishman 
who went to sleep for two or three days, when Bob went to sleep, 
he " paid attintion to it." In a few seconds then he was fast, 
and ¡ª truth must be told ¡ª with his mouth open, and a very 
unpleasant noise arising therefrom. 




Vain hope of rest. Even as he threw himself hack, a little 
many-legged creature, about two inches long, was industriously 
making its way over the deck towards where one of the middy's 
limbs lay outstretched, and in a few seconds it had mounted his 
shoe, examined it with a pair of long thin antennae, and then 
given the leather a pinch with a pair of hooked claws at its tail. 

Apparently dissatisfied, the long thin yellow insect ran on to 
the sleeper's sock, carefully examined its texture, tasted it with 
its tail, and still not satisfied, proceeded to walk up one of the 
very wide open duck trouser legs, that must have been to it 
like the entrance to some grand tunnel, temptingly inviting 
investigation. 

The insect disappeared ; Bob snored, and there was the loud 
buzzing murmur of men's voices, talking drowsily together, when, 
as if suddenly electrified, Bob leaped up with a sharp cry, 
slapped his leg vigorously, and stood shaking his trousers till 
the long thin insect tumbled on to the white deck, and was duly 
crushed. 

''Scissors! how it stings!" cried Bob, rubbing the place. 
" O Lor' I what a place this is to be sure. Who the dickens can 
get a nod ? " 

Bob Roberts was determined upon having one evidently, for 
having given the obnoxious remains another stamp, he took a 
look round, to see if any other pest, winged or legged, had been 
brought from the shore, and seeing nothing, he again settled 

himself down, gave a turn or two and a twist to get himself 
comfortable, ending by sitting with his legs stretched straight 

out, his head thrown back, and his nose pointed straight up at 
the awning. 

This time Bob went off fast asleep; his cap fell on to the 
deck, but it did not disturb him ; and he was evidently making 
up for lost time, when a very industrious spider, who had made 
his home in the awning, came boldly out of a fold \>y a seam of 
the canvas, and with busy legs proceeded to examine the state 
and tension of some threads, which it had previously stretched 
as the basis of a web upon a geometrical plan, expressly to catch 
mosquitoes. 

Apparently satisfied, the spider set to work busily, its dark, 
heavy body showing plainly against the yellowish canvas ; and 
in a very short time a main rope was attached to the roof, and 
the architect of fly-nets began slowly to descend in search of a 
point to which the other end of the said main-stay could be 
attacked. 

Now fate had so arranged it, that the point exactly beneath 





the spider as it slowly descended was the tip of Bob Roberts' 
nose, and to this point in the course of a minute the insect 
nearly arrived. 

It may be thought that its next act would be to alight and fix 
its rope ; but this was not so easy, for the soft zeph5T:-like breaths 
the middy exhaled drove the swinging architect to and fro. 
Now it came near, now it was driven away ; but at last it got 
near enough to grasp at the sleeper's most prominent feature, 
just brushing it with its legs, and setting up an irritating tickling 
that made Bob snort and scratch his face. 

The spider swung to and fro for some seconds, and then there 
was another terrible tickle, to which Bob responded by fiercely 
rubbing the offending organ. 

The spider was driven to a distance by this ; but it was back 
again directly, with its legs stretched out, tickling as before. 

Bob was not asleep, and he was not awake, and he could 
neither sink into oblivion, nor thoroughly rouse himself. All he 
could do was to bestow an irritable scratch at his nose, and the 
spider came back again. 

At last, spider or no spider, he dropped into a strange dreamy 
state, in which he believed that Tom Long came and loomed 
over him on purpose to bend down and tickle him, out of spite 
and jealousy, with the long thin feather from a paroquet's tail. 

"Don't! Bother !'* said Bob, in his sleep; but the tickling 
went on, and he felt ready to leap up and strike his tormentor ; 
but he seemed to be held down by some strange power which 
kept him from moving, and the tickling still went on. 

Then he could hear voices talking, and people seemed to 
be about, laughing at and enjoying the trick that was being 
played upon him \ and then he started into wakefulness, for a 
voice exclaimed, ¡ª 

" Come, Mr Roberts, are you going to wake up?" 

It was Lieutenant Johnson who spoke ; and on the middy 
jumping up, he found standing by him, with the lieutenant, the 
dark-faced youth who had met them and acted as guide on the 
occasion when they made their first visit to the sultan's home. 

He was dressed similarly to the way in which he made his 
first appearance before the English party ; that is to say, he wore 
the silken jacket and sarong of the Malay chiefs, with a natty 
little embroidered cap, set jauntily upon his head like that of a 
cavalry soldier ; but in addition he wore the trousers, white shirt- 
fi-ont, and patent leather boots of an Englishman, and the middy 
saw that he had a gold albert chain and straw-coloured kid 
gloves. 




" This gentleman is the son of the Tumongong of Parang, Mr 
Roberts," said the lieutenant, "and he has come on board to see 
the ship. Take him round and show him everything, especially 
the armoury, and let him understand the power of the guns. 
Captain Horton wishes it." 

The lieutenant looked meaningly at the middy, who saluted, 
and then nodded his head in a way that showed he comprf> 
hended his task. 

"The skipper wants these people to know that it is of no 
good to try and tackle us/' thought Bob. " Yes, sir," he said 
aloud, " I'll take him round ;" and then the lieutenant, who had 
been interrupted in a nap, saluted the young chief, who salaamed 
to him gravely, and the two young men were left alone, gazing 
straight at one another, each apparently trying to read the other's 
thoughts. 

"This is a jolly nice sort of a game," said Bob to himself! 
"How am I to make him understand? What a jolly fool old 
Johnson is. Now, my sun-brown-o cockywax, comment vous 
portez-vous ? as we say in French. Me no understandy curse 
Malay's lingo not at alio. Bismillah ! wallah ! Come oh 1 and 
have a bottle oh 1 of Bass's ale oh 1 

" With much pleasure," said the young Malay, laughing. " I 
am thirsty." 

Bob Roberts turned as red as a turkey cock with vexation, 

" What ! Can you understand English ? " he stammered. 

" Rather 1 " was the reply. " I couldn't make out all you said 
¡ª not quite," he added, laughing meaningly, 

"Oh ! I say, I am sorry," said Bob frankly. "I didn't know 
you could understand a word," 

" It's all right," said the young Malay, showing his white 
teeth, and speaking fair idiomatic English, though with a peculiar 
accent, " I've been a great deal at Penang and Singapore. I 
like English ways." 

" I say, you know," cried Bob, holding out his hand, " it was 
only my fun. I wouldn't have chaffed you like that for a 
moment if I had thought you could understand" 

" No, I suppose not," said the young Malay. " Never mind, I 
wanted to see you. That*swhylcame. Where's the youngsoldier?" 

" What Tom ¡ª I mean Ensign Long ? " 

"Yes, En ¡ª sign Long." 

" Knocked up. Ill with his wound. He got hurt up the river." 

" I did not know it was he," said the young Malay. " Poor 
fellow I " 

" He was in an awful state," said Bob. " Got a kris through 
his shoulder, and thought it was poisoned.*' 



" What, the kris ? Oh, no. That is nonsense. Our people 
don't poison their krises and limbings. The Sakais poison their 
arrows. " 

" The whiches ? " said Bob. 

" The Sakais ¡ª the wild people of the hills and jungle. Naked 
¡ª wear no clothes." 

" Yes," said Bob drily. " I knew naked meant wearing no 
clothes. So you Malay folks are not savages, but have got 
savages somewhere near." 

** Savages? wild people," said the young man, with a little 
flush appearing through his tawny skin. " The Malay chiefs are 
gentlemen. We only are simple in our ways and living/' 

" Oh I that's it, is it ? " said Bob. ** Well, come and have this 
drop of Bass. I can't stand fizz." 

" Fizz ? " said the visitor ; " what is fizz ? " 

" Champagne.'* 

" Oh, yes ! I know ; frothing, bubbling wine, with a pop cork." 

" Yes, that's it," said Bob, grinning, " with a pop cork ; " and 
leading the way below, he got a bottle of Bass and a couple of 
glasses, which they sat down and discussed. 

" Have a cigar ? " said the young Malay, producing a hand- 
some French-made case. 

"Thanky," said Bob. "What are these? Manillas?" 

" No ; from Deli, in Sumatra," said his visitor. And then 
they Ht up by the open window of the gun-room, and sat and 
smoked for a few minutes in silence, each watching the other. 

"I say," said Bob at last, "this is jolly rum, you know. Why 
you are quite an Englishman, young fellow." 

"I like English ways," said the young chief, flushing ; "some 
of them. If I were sultan, I'd take to all the best English 
customs, and make them take the place of all our bad ones. 
Then we should be great." 

" Yes," said Bob ; " I suppose so." 

" Ah," said the young man, sadly, " you lauglu But J could 
improve our people." 

"Yes, of course," said Bob, hastily. "Now come and see 
round the ship." 

" No, no, let us sit and talk," said the young Malay. " I have 
seen plenty of ships. I know all about them." 

"Just as you like," said Bob. "Then let's go and sit on 
deck, under the awning. It's awfully hot here," 

" You think it hot ? " 

" Yes ; don't you ? " said Bob. 

"No, not at all," said the young Malay, smiling; and rising 
he followed the middy on deck. 




"That's better," said Bob; "sit down in that cane chair. 
I say, what's your name ? " 

" Ali ; what is yours ?" 

" Robert Roberts ; commonly known to my intimates as Bob." 

" Intimates ? what are intimates ? " 

" Best friends," said Bob. 

" Yes, I understand. May I be an intimate ? " 

**To be sure you may," said Bob, holding out his hand, 
which the other eagerly grasped. " But no larks, you know." 

" Larks 1 what is larks ? " said All, eagerly. 

" I mean, no sticking that kris of yours into a fellow on the sly." 

'* Nonsense ! What bosh ! " cried the young Malay. 

" Bosh, eh ? " said Bob, laughing. " I say, Master Ali, you 
are civilized, and no mistake. It is only our very educated 
people who say Bosh I " 

" You took the word from us," said the young Malay. " Bosh 
is good eastern language, and means notking.^^ 

" I've heard it was Turkish," said Bob, drily. 

" Well, Turkish ; the language of Roum. We look upon the 
Sultan of Roum and Stamboul as our greatest chief." 

" Oh, I say," cried Bob ; " I can't stand this, you know. I 
thought you were a young Malay chief, and you are talking like a 
professor. Look here, Ali, is there any good fishing here?*' 

" Yes, oh yes. I'll take you in my boat, and my men shall 
catch plenty." 

'*No, no," said Bob. "You take me in the boat, and I'll 
catch the fish. But is there any shooting ? " 

"Shooting!" said the young Malay, laughing; "everything; 
bird that flies, bird that swims, tigers, buffalo, deer." 

" Where ? " cried Bob, excitedly. 

" In the great forest ¡ª the jungle. Will you come ? " 

"Will I come?" cried Bob. "Won't I ! I say," he went on, 
excitedly, " you can't shoot, can you ? " 

" I practise sometimes," said the young Malay, quietly. 

" What with ? A blow-pipe ? " 

" Yes, I can use the sumpitan," said the young Malay, nodding; 
" but I use a revolver or a rifle." 

"I believe I'm half asleep," muttered Bob. " Haven't got a 

gun, have you ? " 

" Yes ; an English gentleman changed with me. I gave him 
ivory and gold, and he gave me his double gun." 

" Not a breechloader? " said Bob. 

" Yes, a breechloader ¡ª a Purdey he called it, and a bag of 
cartridges," 



"Oh, I say," cried Bob; "this is rich, you know. I am sorry 
I was such an idiot with you at first. But do you mean it? If 
I get a day ashore, will you take me where there's some good 
shooting ? " 

" Oh, yes, plenty," was the reply. 

Bob Roberts was thoughtful for a few moments. 

" I say," he said at last, " I wish Tom Long were here." 

" En ¡ª sign Long ? " said Ali. 

" Yes. He's a very cocky fellow, you know ; but he's a good 
one at bottom." 

" Should I like him ? " 

" Yes, when you got to know him ; but he only shows some 
fellows his clothes.'' 

" I don't want to see his clothes," said Ali, smiling, 

** I mean, some people never get to know what's inside him," 
said Bob, 

" What is ' inside him ' ? " said Ali, whom these mysteries of 
the English tongue somewhat puzzled. " Do you mean what he 
has had to eat ? " 

'* No, no;" said Bob, laughing. "I mean his heart." 

" Show people his heart ? " said Ali, thoughtfully, " Oh yes, 
I see ; I understand. You mean he is cold outside, and proud, 
and does not show people what he really thinks ¡ª like a Malay ? " 

"Yes, that's what I mean," said Bob, smiling. "But that's 
like a Malay, is it ? They say one thing, and mean another, do 

they ? " , 

" Yes," said Ali, gravely ¡ª " to their enemies ¡ª to the people who 

try to cheat and deceive them. To their real friends they are 

very true, and full of faith. But it is time now that I should go." 

"I say, though, stop a minute," said Bob sharply. "Are your 
people really good friends to us ? " 

" Yes," said the visitor, " I hope so. I believe so. They are 
strange at first, and do not like English ways, like I, Afterwards 
they will do the same as I do. Good-bye." 

"But about our shooting?" said Bob. "May I bring Tom 

Long ? " 

" I should like to know En ¡ª sign Long. He is very brave, is 
he not ? " 

" Pretty bobbish, I believe," said the middy. 

" Is he bobbish, too, like you. Are you not Bob Bobbish ? " 

" No, no, I'm Bob Roberts," said the middy, laughing. " I 
mean, Tom Long is as brave as most fellows." 

There was a short consultation then as to time and place of 
meeting ; after which the young Malay passed over the side into 
his boat, rowed by four followers, and was quicHy pulled ashore; 



CHAPTER XV. 



HOW THE SULTAN WAS PUT OFF WITH WORDS. 

There was a good deal of communication now between the 
sultan and the resident, and rumours began flying about that the 
former proposed paying a visit to the residency ; but the days 
glided by, and it did not take place. The men who had been 
wounded were rapidly recovering ; and after several attempts to 
find the missing prahus, it was announced one evening, in a 
quiet way, that there was to be another expedition down the 
river, for information had been brought in by a Malay boatman, 
who had been employed to act as a scout, that the two vessels 
were lying-up in a creek on the left bank of the river. It would 
therefore be quite easy for the steamer to float down stream off 
where they lay, and either send in boats to the attack or to 
shatter them by sweeping the mangroves with the steamer*s great 
guns, for the prahus lay behind a thick grove of these trees some 
twenty or thirty yards across, quite sufficient for a screen, but 
worse than useless as a protection if the heavy guns were once 
brought to bear. 

Messages had come again and again from the sultan, urging 
that the power of the rajah should be thoroughly crushed ; in 
fact, his requests almost took the tone of a command. 

There was a disposition to resent this, but it was felt better to 
temporize, and word was sent to the sultan by a trusty messenger 
that something would be done. 

The result of this was another visit from the leading chiefs, who 
rather startled the resident by the message they brought, which 
was to the effect that their master thought it would be better that 
his marriage to the two Englishwomen should take place at once; 
and what did Mr Linton think of the next day ? 

Mr Linton thought, but he did not tell the sultan*s ambassa- 
dors so, that he would consult Major Sandars and Captain 
Horton ; and this he did while the messengers waited. 




Major Sandars blew his nose very loudly, and said he should 
like to kick the villain. 

Captain Horton said that nothing would give him greater 

pleasure than to have this Mr Hamet tied up and to give him six 
dozen. 

"This is all very well, gentlemen," said Mr Linton, smiling ; 
*' but it does not help me out of my difficulty. What am I to 
say so as not to offend this man ? " 

*'0h, you must offend him," said the major. "I can see 
nothing for it, but to send him word that the English ladies 
are greatly honoured by the sultanas proposal, but that they 
cannot accept it." 

Captain Horton nodded approval, and the resident agreed 
that they could do nothing better ; so the message was delivered 
to the sultan's ambassadors, who looked exceedingly depressed 
upon hearing it, and as if they would have gladly exchanged 
places with somebody else. 

" Those fellows expect to get into trouble," said the major, as 
he noticed the change. 

He was quite right, for the two chiefs took their departure, 
looking as if they expected to be introduced by their wrathful 
ruler to the execution kris as soon as they returned. 

The troops had been expecting orders for a trip down the 
river in search of the two prahus, but the command came upon 
them, as such matters usually do, just when it was least expected. 
One company, under Captain Smithers, was ordered to embark, 
but to Tom Long's great disgust, he found he was not included. 

He hurried to the doctor's quarters, and found that gentleman 
busy with a case of instruments, open before him. 

" Look here, Long," he said; "did you ever see such a wretched 
country as this ? Everything rusts ; look at my instruments." 

"Yes, sir, it is terrible ; such fine steel too." 

" Fine steel ? There isn't a better case in the army. I could 
do anything with these tools." 

Tom Long shuddered as he glanced at the long, fearfully 
keen knives, and the saw ¡ª so horribly suggestive of taking oflf 

arms and legs. 

Doctor Bolter saw it, and smiled to himself. 

" Come to say good-bye, Long? " he said, as he stuffed some 
lint into a pouch, with some bandages. "I'm not a fighting 
man, and don't mean to be killed." 

" No, sir. I came to ask you to let me go ¡ª to give me a 
certificate, saying I am quite well enough." 

" But you are not, my dear boy. You are too weak." 





" Weak, sir ? No, I feel as strong as a Hon. Let me go, doctor." 

" What nonsense, my dear lad ! I'm not the commandant. 
Ask the major." 

" No, sir," said Tom Long. " You are not the commandant 
by name, but from the major downwards you do just as you like 
with us. Hang me if I'd have drunk such filthy stuff as you 
gave me, by the major's orders. I'd sooner have lost my com- 
mission." 

" Ha, ha, ha ! Ha, ha, ha ! '* laughed the doctor. ? That's 
very good, Long, very good indeed. I suppose I do get the 
better of all of you in turn. Ha, ha, ha ! But look here, my 
dear boy, I don't think you are well enough yet.'' 

" Do let me go, doctor," pleaded Tom. " There, I don't want 
to fight, but let me go with you and help yon. This dreadful 
do-nothing sort of life seems to make me worse." 

" Idleness is bad for any man," said the doctor. 

Tom Long felt flattered at being called a man, but still 
looked pleadingly at the doctor. 

" I could take care of your instruments, sir, and hand you 
what you wanted if there were any of our fellows hurt." 

" Humph 1 yes, you could do that," said the doctor. " But 

look here," he said, gazing searchingly into the youth's face ; 
"did you take your medicine to-day?" 

" Yes, sir, three times," cried Tom, eagerly ; for, after neglect- 
ing it for two days* previously, he had taken it that day by way of 
a salve to his conscience. 

" Then you shall go," said the doctor. ** Be quick. Get your 
great coat ¡ª and mind, you are to be my assistant" 

Tom Long ran back to his quarters, and doctor's assistant or 
no, he buckled on his sword, and stuck his revolver in its case, 
before putting on his grey great coat ; meeting the detachment 
on its way down to the boat. 

"Hallo, Long, what are you doing here?" said Captain 
Smithers. " You are not detailed for duty." 

" No," said the doctor, sharply, " he is coming on hospital 
service." 

There was no time for argument, so they marched on down 
to the *' Startler's " boats, which were waiting, and at once put 
off silently, the swift stream bearing them quickly to the steamer's 
side, as she lay there with her steam up, but not a light visible 
to tell those upon the shore of the projected expedition. There 
was the low dull hiss and snort of the escaping steam ; and one 
versed in such matters would have noticed that the steamer 
had let go her moorings at the stem, and swung round in the 



stream, holding on hard by the stem, ready to slip the cable and 

start. 

But Captain Horton felt pretty secure of getting away unob- 
served ; and trusting to the keen eyes of a couple of Malay boat- 
men, he calculated upon getting the steamer just abreast of the 
mangrove creek where the prahus lay, and then dealing with 
them and their crews as he pleased. 

The distance do^vn was about ten miles ; and the stream was 
so swift, that in a couple of hours the steamer would have run 
down without the aid of her screw ; but it was proposed to steam 
for about two-thirds of the distance, and then drift in silence, 
with a turn of the screw now and then to keep her head right. 

The river was so deep, and clear of obstruction, that there was 
nothing to fear in their journey down, while fortunately the night, 
though not illuminated by the moon, was tolerably light. 

The arrangements were soon made, and directly the boats 
were hoisted up the cable was slipped from the great buoy, and 
the steamer drifted down stream, the steam power being kept 
in abeyance until they were some distance below the campong. 

In his character of doctor's assistant, Tom Long did not mix 
with the officers in command of the little detachment, and was 
standing aloof leaning over the bulwarks, and gazing at the 
fire-flies on the shore, when he heard a familiar voice close by. 

" Think those Malay chaps will be able to see the. creek on 
a night like this, Dick ? " 

"See it, Master Roberts, sir? Why, I could see it myself if 
I tried, and knowed where to look for it Bless yer 'art, they 
Malay chaps have got eyes like cats, and can see in the dark," 

" Oh yes, I dare say," said Bob. " Well, all I can say is, I 
hope we shall knock the prahus into splinters. I do owe those 
fellows a grudge for being chucked overboard as I was. It makes 
me feel wet now to think of it" 

"Yes, that 'ere war a rum un, Master Roberts, sir," said Dick, 
solemnly. " Now, look here, sir, you being a boy like, and not 
wanted, if I was you, I'd just go down below, get on my perch, 
and tuck myself up and go to roost where I should be quite 
safe." 

"Thank you, Dick," said Bob, quietiy; "I'm going to stop 
on deck, and then go with the party ashore. We'll leave the 
old men and old women on board to take charge of the ship till 
we come back." 

" That's as good as saying I'm a regular old woman, Master 
Roberts, sir," said Dick, grinning. 

Bob did not condescend to reply, but walked aft a little way, 




to where he could see a dark figure half-leaning, half-sitting in 
the darkness upon a gun, and looking over the bulwarks. 

" Here, you sir,'' he said sharply, " come away from that gun. 
Why are you not with the detachment forward there ? " 

" Oh, you be hanged ! " said a familiar voice. 

''What? Tom Long?" 

" That's my name, Mr Roberts," said the dark figure. 

** Why, I thought you were in hospital yet." 

** I'm on hospital service," replied Tom. " I got the doctor to 
bring me." 

? I say¡ª I am glad," said Bob. '* Eh ? [' 

He stopped short, for Tom Long had pinched his arm. 

" Isn't that a long low vessel moored there under the bank ? " 
said Tom. 

Bob looked long and attentively. 

" I think so ¡ª two of them," he said. " I'll tell the officer of 
the watch." 

He turned aft and pointed out the dimly seen objects. 

" Yes, I think they are prahus moored to the trees," he said, 
examining them through the glass. 

The officer reported what he had seen to the captain, who also 
inspected them through a night glass. 

"Yes, coasting boats, I think. We'll overhaul them as we 
come back, we must not stop now." 

The vessel was now steaming steadily down stream, not 
quickly, for there were too many turns, but sufficiently fast to 
bring them rapidly near their goal. 

" Let's see ; I want to have a talk to you, Tom Long, about a 
trip ashore¡ªshooting," said Bob. 

"Silence there, young gentleman," said the officer of the watch 
sternly, and then Bob was called suddenly away, so that he had 
no opportunity for a quiet chat with the young ensign. 

Meanwhile the heavy throb throb of the steamer was the only 
noise heard save some weird cry of animal or bird in the dense 
jungle on either side. But every now and then as the waves and 
wash of the steamer rolled ashore, churning up the mud, they 
startled the dull, heavy alligators into activity, sending them 
scurrying off the muddy banks into deep water, to await the 
passing of the, to them, large water monster, whose great bulk 
dwarfed them into insignificance the most extreme. 

Lower and lower down stream went the steamer with the dense 
black line of jungle on either side, till at the suggestion of the 
Malay pilots the steam was turned oif, a couple of boats lowered, 
and the position of the vessel being reversed, she was allowed to 




float down head to stream, for quite another half-hour, when the 
word having been given, a small anchor that had been hanging 
down in the water was let go, without so much as a plash, the 
stout hemp cable ran quietly out, and the vessel was checked just 
off the narrow mouth of a creek, which seemed to run up amidst 
the palms and undergrowth, for there were no mangroves till the 
tidal waters were reached. 

There was a little rapid passing to and fro here, and a couple 
of boats were silently lowered down, to go a quarter of a mile 
below to watch the other entrance to the creek, for the Malays 
were too fox-like not to have a hole for exit as well as one for 
entry. But everything was done in the most noiseless manner, 
so that when three more boats full of soldiers, marines, and 
sailors rowed off for the creek, no one would have imagined that 
they had slipped oif on a deadly errand, or that the steamer was 
cleared for action, the guns shotted and every man ready to let 
loose a deadly hail that should cut down the jungle like a scythe 
amidst the corn. 

But the British officers had yet to learn that the Malays were 
more than their equals in cunning. No sooner had the steamer 
passed on into the bank of mist and darkness that overhung the 
river, than there was a rustle, a splash, the rattling noise of large 
oars being thrust out, and in a couple of minutes the two long 
snaky prahus they had passed crammed with fighting men were 
gliding up stream towards the residency, where certainly there 
were sentries on guard, but no dread of an enemy at hand. 

The boats then had pushed off from the steamer, which lay 
ready to help them, and rowing out of the swift waters of the 
river they began to ascend the dark and muddy creek, when 
Bob Roberts, who was with the lieutenant and part of the soldiers 
in the same boat suddenly whispered ¡ª 

" Hark ! wasn't that distant firing?" 

They listened, but could hear nothing, and the lieutenant was 
about to order the men to pull more sharply, when Bob touched 
his arm again. 

"I'm sure that's firing, sir," he said. 

" Nonsense, Roberts ! absurd ! Sit still and be silent What 
firing could it be ? We are ten miles from the residency." 

" 1 can't help it, sir, if we are twenty," said Bob, sharply. 
" I'm sure it was firing, and there it goes again." 

" Silence, sir," said the lieutenant, angrily. " Give way, my 
lads, give way." 

The ship's boats glided on over the smooth water, the men 
rowing with muffled oars ; and so steadily that the blades seemed 
to be dipping in without making a splash. 




The creek grew narrower, so that they had to keep right in the 
middle to avoid letting the oar blades brush the reeds, and so 
they rowed on, but without seeing anything resembling a prahu. 

As to their direction, that they could not tell, but the shape of 
the creek they believed to be that of a bow ¡ª at least so the 
Malays had described it ; and as the two ends of the bow must 
rest upon the river, they were sure, unless they struck up some 
narrow tortuous way, to come out at the other mouth and join 
the boats. 

They went on very cautiously, with the midshipman anxious 
to talk to Tom Long, who sat beside him, but forbidden now to 
utter so much as a whisper. The oars dipped and rose, dipped 
and rose, without a sound, and sometimes a reed or water plant 
rustled slightly as it brushed the sides of the boats. 

That in which the lieutenant was in command led the weird 
procession, Captain Smithers being in the next, while the third, 
nearly full of marines, every man with his loaded rifle between 
his knees, was close behind. 

Still there was no sign of the prahus, and to the lieutenant's 
great annoyance, he found that in the darkness they must have 
turned up the sluggish stream that flowed into the creek, and 
missed the continuation, which was probably masked with reeds. 

He felt ready to stamp with vexation, but controlling himself 
he passed the word, and the boats backed down the stream, that 
in which the officer in command was seated naturally being the 
last of the three. 

" Wouldn't it have been better to have brought the Malays, 
sir?" said Bob. 

" Yes, of course ; but the cowards were afraid to come, my 
good lad," said the lieutenant. 

*' There, sir,*' whispered Bob again, " isn't that firing?" 

" If you say another word to me about your confounded 
firing,'* said the lieutenant sharply, " I'll have you gagged, sir.'* 

" I don't want to talk about it, sir," grumbled Bob, " but I'm 
sure there's something wrong up yonder.'* 

** And I'm sure there's something wrong here, Mr Roberts," 
said the lieutenant, " and that's enough for me to attend to." 

They went back in silence for some time, and then Tom Long, 
whose eyes were unusually good, pointed to a part of the reed- 
bed on the right. 

" Is not that the continuation of the creek, sir?" 

'Yes, to be sure, so it is," said the lieutenant. "We can see 
it coming this way. It's masked by those trees the other way. 
Steady, my lads 3 steady. Let us go first** 





The creek was wider here, so the boats turned, and retook 
their former positions ; but still there was no sign of the prahus. 

" Those scoundrels must have led us wrong," muttered the 
lieutenant ; there's nothing here. Why, yonder's the open river, 
isn't it \ or is it a wider space ? Yes, thank goodness j there are 
the prahus after all." 

He waited till the other boats closed up, and then whispered 
his final orders, appointing two boats to attack one of the prahus 
while he made for the other alone. 

"Now then," he whispered, "are you all ready? A bold 
dash, my lads, and they are ours." 

"Please, sir," said old Dick, 

" What is it ? " cried the lieutenant, angrily. 

" Them's our own two boats. I'd swear to 'em." 

" And I'm sure that's firing," cried Bob, aloud. 

" Yes," said Tom Long, speaking excitedly ; " those were the 
two prahus we passed on the way down." 

" And they are attacking the residency," cried Bob. 

Even as he spoke there was a shot fired from the steamer to 
recall the boats, and the men bent to their stout ashen oars with 
all their might, the lieutenant as he leaped on board being met 
by Captain Horton with, ¡ª 

" These Malay tigers are a little too cunning for us, Johnson. 
Those were the prahus we passed on the way down." 

" Yes, sir, another slip ; but we may have them yet" 



CHAPTER XVI. 



HOW PRIVATE SIM TOOK A NAP, AND FOUND IT UNPLEASANT. 

A GENERAL feeling of uneasiness had been excited as soon as it 
was known that the " Startler " had left her moorings to go in 
search of the two escaped prahus. Mr Linton did not feel happy in 
his own mind, though he did not communicate his fears to a soul. 

Still he might have spoken openly, for it would not have caused 
greater terrors in the breasts of his daughter and niece, who were 
fo^ some reason or another too full of vague fears to retire to 
rest. It did not occur to them to associate their sensations with 
the departure of the steamer. In fact if they had so done, they 
would not have harboured the thought for a moment, knowing 
as they did how well-protected they were by the sturdy little 
garrison of troops, only about a third of whicli had gone upon the 
expedition. 

Both Tom Long and Bob Roberts might have been conceited 
enough to think that the uneasiness of the ladies was entirely 
upon their account, and they would have been terribly upset to 
know that not a single thought concerning them had crossed the 
minds of either since the departure. 

It was, in fact, a vague feeling of general uneasiness, such as 

might have been suffered at any time by those who were com- 
paratively alone in the midst of a notoriously hostile, and even 
treacherous people, some of whom were friendly to the English, 
though the majority bore them the most intense hate. 

Even the Major was out of spirits, and told Mrs Major that he 
would after all a great deal rather be at home, than out in such 
a treacherous, krising, throat-cutting place as Parang. 

" And a very nice thing to say too," said Mrs Major Sandars, 
" just too as we are going to bed. I shall now lie awake all 
night thinking, and keep seeing brown men climbing in through 
the blinds, and be uneasy as can be.*' 

*^ Don't talk nonsense," said the Major, gruffly. " But really 

IVe a good mind to have the sentries increased in number." 




" I really would, if I were you," said Mrs Major. 
" No ; second thoughts are best. There is no occasion to 
harass the men with extra duty; and, besides, I'm nearly 

undressed." 

So the Major and Mrs Major went to bed, as did the majority 
of those at the station, excepting, of course, the officer and th-e 

guard. 

There was one man though who shared the feeling of uneasi- 
ness. Earlier in the night he had been disappointed at not being 
called upon to form one of the Httle company for the expedition, 
for he was raging with desire to in some way distinguish himself. 
He was a mere private soldier, but he told himself that the way 
to honour was open ; and though a long and wearisome one for 
a private, still he might win his way to promotion ¡ª corporal, 
sergeant ¡ª some day, perhaps, ensign ; and so on, till he became, 
may-be, adjutant of his regiment. 

He could not sleep that evening, and crushing down the feelings 
that oppressed him, he told himself it was the heat, and dressing 
lightly, he went out into the comparative coolness of the night. 

He had not gone far before he was reminded that there was 
watchfulness around ; for he was challenged by first one and then 
another sentry, who, however, in turn, let him pass, on finding 
who it was. And so he wandered restlessly here and there 
amidst the trees, longing to go in one direction, but fighting hard 
against the desire ; as he told himself with a bitter smile that 
some of the old poison of the water-snake must still be in his 
blood, and be the cause of all this restlessness and pain. 

He had wandered here and there for some time, seating him- 
self amidst the trees, and then going down to the landing-place 
to gaze at the calm swift river that eddied and gurgled amidst 
the water-washed boats and masses of rush at the edge of the 
island, wondering the while whether possibly at some time or 
another the effect of the constant washing of the water might not 
be to completely sweep away the island. " Not in our time of 
possession," he said to himself; and turning slowly away he 
stood hesitating for a while, and then, in spite of his self-restraint 
he took the path leading to Mr Linton's house, to convince him- 
self, so he mentally said, that the place was quite safe. 

The " place " in his brain really meant one solitary being in 
that house, for if he felt assured that Rachel Linton was sleeping 
peacefully, and with no overhanging danger, he said that he 
should be satisfied. 

He went on then cautiously, getting nearer and nearer to the 
house, and feeling surprised that he was not challenged by a 




sentry, till he was quite close up, and then his heart began to 
beat fast, for he fancied he heard whispering voices, and at last, 
after intense listening, he was quite sure. 

Here then weis the danger ; not such danger as he had fanci- 
fully imagined ¡ª the swimming of tigers from the mainland, or 
some noxious reptile ; it was from man that the peril was to 
come. 

He stole on again, making not a sound. And now he recalled 
how some Malay had swum to the island and hurled a spear in 
through one of the residency windows- 

** Good heavens ! " he muttered ; "and I am quite unarmed." 

As this thought occurred to him, he could hear the whisperitig 
continued ; and mingled with it there seemed to come a sound 
of hard breathing, like a sleeper close at hand. 

It was so ¡ª the sentry asleep ; and following the sound two or 
three yards, Adam Gray bent over a prostrate form, and caught 
up the rifle with fixed bayonet, seeing at the same moment that 
it was Private Sim. 

He was about to kick the fellow, but he thought that by so 
doing he should be spreading the alarm, perhaps prematurely ; 
BO he walked cautiously forward towards where the whispering 

seemed to be. 

It was so dark amidst the trees that he could hardly make out 
his position ; but directly after it seemed to him that the sounds 
came from an upper window ; and as the thought struck him he 
stepped upon a piece of dry cane, which snapped beneath his 
feet. 

To bring his rifle to the present was the work of an instant ; 
and as he did so a quick voice exclaimed, 

" Who is there ? Is that the sentry ? " 

" Yes, ma'am," he replied ; feeling the blood tingle in his face, 
as he recognized the voice. 

" We thought we heard the hard breathing of some beast, or 
some one asleep," said Rachel Linton, with her voice shaking a 
little as she spoke, "and we were afraid." 

''There was ¡ª there is some one asleep here, ma'am;" said 
Gray, trying to speak calmly and quietly j " but I am on duty 
now." 

" It is Private Gray, Rachel, whom you attended to," said 
another voice, " Let us go in now, we shall be quite safe." 

"Yes," said Rachel, in a low voice, meant only for herself; 
but heard plainly in the utter silence of that night, " we shall be 
quite safe now." 

" Good-night, sentry," said Mary Sinclair. 



" Good-night, ma'am," replied Gray ; and he stood and heard 
the shutter blind closed with a bitter feeling of annoyance at his 
heart. 

"My name seems to have driven her away," he muttered. 
"At any rate, though, I am of some use," he said soon after; 
"she feels safe when I am by," 

Ail was perfectly still now, except the heavy breathing of 
Private Sim ; and Gray stood thinking what he should do. 

Should he wake up Sim ? 
- No ; if he did, he would have to leave him on duty, when he 
would go to sleep again, and something horrible might happen. 

What was to happen ? he asked himself. 

That he could not say ; but on one thing he determined at once, 
and that was, to take Private Sim's place and to keep guard. 

But then Sim's lapse of duty would be found out, and he 
would be severely punished. 

Richly he deserved it; but perhaps a severe taking to task 
might suffice to awaken him to a sense of his duty ; and there- 
fore Gray felt that he would be lenient, and not betray him, 
though it was horrible to think that the lives of all on the island 
might be betrayed to death by the neglect of such a fellow as 

this. 

Private Gray was a man of quick decision, and his mind was 
made up at once. He would keep on duty till it was time for 
the guard to be changed, and then he would wake up Sim, and 
see that a responsible man took his place. 

" The lazy, untrustworthy scoundrel ! " he muttered, as he 
shouldered the rifle and walked up and down for a few minutes 
along the sentry's post But matters were not to be ordered as 
he intended, for he had not been on duty very long before he 
heard a sound from the river that made him start and listen 

attentively. 

"Nothing ! " he said to himself after a few seconds* attention; 
and he once more resumed his slow march up and down, the 
motion seeming to calm him, for when standing still his thoughts 

tortured him. 

" There it is again," he said to himself, suddenly. " It is a 
boat of some kind." 

Plainly enough now he had heard the peculiar creak given by 
an oar rubbing against wood, and this was repeated again and 
again. 

He strained his eyes in the direction from which it came, but 
could see nothing for the trees. Feeling, though, that he ought 
to act, he went to where Private Sim still lay sleeping heavily 





and gave him a lusty kick, with the effect of making him start 
to his feet 

" I only ¡ª oh, it's you Private Gray," he said, huskily, " I 
thought it was the sergeant." 

" You untrustworthy villain ! " whispered Gray. " Silence, 
this moment. Take your rifle, and keep watch till I return." 

*' Who are you talking to like that ? " said Sim, in a bullying 
tone. 

" You, sir," replied Gray, in a low, authoritative manner, which 
made the man shrink. " Do you wish me to report that I found 
you sleeping at your post ? Silence I no words. There is a large 
boat of some kind approaching ; be on the look-out and challenge, 
and fire if necessary." 

Private Sim did not answer, but stood on the alert, while Gray 
ran back in the direction of the fort. 

Before he was half-way there, though, he heard the challenge ot 
a sentry on his right, followed by a faint cry and a heavy fall. 

The challenge was repeated by another sentry farther away, 
and this time there was the report of a sentry's rifle ; and directly 
after came from behind him, where he had left Private Sim, the 
report of another piece. 

He knew it must be Sim, and as danger was there, his first 
impulse was to run back to the help of the ladies and the resi- 
dent. His second thought told him that he was unarmed, and 
such an act would be madness. It must take some time for an 
enemy to break into the place, and before then the soldiers would 
have turned out. 

In fact the bugle rang out as he hurried on through the dark- 
ness, being compelled to turn back twice ; for he heard the 
trampling of feet and rustling of the leaves as people forced 
their way through, and he was obliged to make somewhat of a 
ddtour. 

Even then somebody struck at him, a blow which he returned 

with his fist, sending his assailant staggering back amidst the 
bushes, while he ran on, to hear a limbing whistle by his ear. 

Shot after shot had meanwhile been fired, fully giving the 
alarm, and by the time Gray reached the fort, after an extremely 
perilous run ¡ª for the way seemed to swarm with enemies ; and 
even now he did not know whether he was wounded or no, for 
he had felt two heavy blows in the chest and back ¡ª he found the 
men falling in, and catching his lifle and belts from the stand he 
joined them. 

Major Sandars was with them, in nothing but his shirt and 
trousers and bare feet, but he had not forgotten his sword, and 




in a few short words he made his arrangements for the defence 
of the fort, while, to Gray's great delight, he detailed a party of 
a dozen men, under a lieutenant, to go down to the residency. 

" You must act according to circumstances, Mr Ellis," he said 
quietly. " It is impossible to tell who or how many our assail- 
ants are; but the darkness that favour?, them will also favour 
you. Your orders are to get somehow to the residency, and 
hold it or bring its occupants away, according to circumstances." 

The lieutenant saluted, and the dozen men, among whom was 
Gray, were marched to the gate. 

There was not one Bxaong them who had done more than slip 
on his trousers, so that they were in light fighting trim ; and as 
soon as they were outside the gate, the lieutenant gave the word 
"Quick march ¡ª double 1*' and away they went in single file 
along the narrow path. 

Before they could reach the residency their pulses began to 
throb, for there were the sharp, quick reports of a revolver, fired 
six times in succession. Then a rifle spoke, and another 
followed by a desultory firing as if in reply. 

Then from behind came the loud, heavy report of a brass 
lelah, fired evidently from some boat on the river ; then another, 
and another, with more desultory firing. 

" Come along my lads ; our fellows will talk to them directly." 
There was a crashing volley just then. 

*' I told you so. That's English, my lads. Steady, steady ; 
don't get out of breath. As we get out of the wood here, form 
up directly in the open, and wait till we can see by the firing 
where the enemy is. Then we'll give him a volley, and charge 
at once right for the verandah, where we'll take our places, and 
act as is afterwards necessary." 

The men followed their leader's commands to the letter; 
formed up in a little line outside the path, and stood there wait- 
ing in the darkness, watching the flashing of a revolver fired 
from one of the residency windows, and the quick streaks of 
light from a party of the enemy, whoever that enemy might be, 
just in front. 

" Ready I'' cried the lieutenant ; and as he gave his command 
there was the quick rattle of the pieces, then a ringing little 
volley, the cry Forward I and on the party dashed with a hearty 
hurrah, which had the eff'ect of stopping the fire from the 
residency, Mr Linton and his servant, w^ho had been defending 
the place, recognizing the voices of friends. 

The little line, with fixed bayonets, dashed over and swept 
down a cluster of Malays who tried to meet their attack with 



spears before taking to flight, and the next moment, it seemed 
to Gray, he was standing with his comrades in the verandah, re- 
loading. 

"Any one down?** cried the lieutenant, sharply, 

" No, sir ; no, sir," was repeated on all sides. 

" All right then, my boys ; make cover of anything ¡ª posts, 
flower vases, anything you can j and we must hold on. Fire 
where you have a chance ; but don't waste a shot" 

The opening of a door changed the plans, for Mr Linton's 
voice was heard saying, ¡ª 

** Come in quickly ; and we can fire from the windows." 

This little evolution was soon performed, but under fire, for 
the Malays sent a desultory series of shots, in company with 
flying spears, though without any effect, while as soon as the rest 
of the upper windows were thrown open the men knelt down 
behind what was an excellent breastwork, and maintained a 
steady fire wherever they saw a flash. 

Meanwhile there was some sharp volley firing from the direo 
tion of the fort, in reply to that of the enemy's brass lelahs. This 
was soon after followed by the heavy roar of a larger gun on 
board one of the prahus, to which the occupants of the little 
fort could not reply, on account of the darkness, and the fact 
that one of the attacking prahus was between them and the 
campong, while the other was so sheltered by trees that it would 
have been folly to have fired. 

The attack was weak in the extreme ¡ª the Malays running 
forward, firing a shot or two, and then retreating to cover 5 and 
this was kept up for a considerable time, the enemy evidently 
thinking that as the defenders were weak through the departure 
of the steamer, they would soon give in. 

It was evident that they were staggered by the defence, for 
they had no doubt hoped to surprise both fort and residency. 
In token of this, the attacking party retreated two or three times 
over, as if to ask for advice or fresh orders from their boats ¡ª 
orders that were pretty decisive, for they came on each time 
more keenly than before, the last time with bundles of inflam- 
mable wood and reeds, with which they boldly advanced to the 
verandah of the residency, throwing them down and then rapidly 
retreating. 

Lieutenant Ellis no sooner became aware of this, though, than 
he got his men out from a side window, formed up, waited their 
time till the Malays came on, shouting, with a burning torch of 

inflammable resin, and then gave them a volley, followed by a 

charge. 





The enemy gave way at once, but only for a few moments; 
then their numbers seemed to become augmented, and with a 
tremendous rush they bore back the little party of soldiers step 
by step. Numbers fell, but they paid no heed to this ; and the 
lieutenant began to wish earnestly that they were safe back 
within the walls of the residency, when there was a roar like 
thunder, then the beating of gongs on both sides of the island. 
Then another roar, and another, and the Englishmen began to 
cheer and pursue, for the Malays were rushing in the direction 
of the gongs. 

But it was no time for pursuing this crowd of Malays into 
narrow paths through dark woods. They had maintained their 
defence till the steamer had returned, and now she was firing 
regularly, gun after gun, in the direction of the prahus, but doing 
no harm, the darkness giving them no opportunity for taking aim. 

The firing of the steamer's big Armstrongs had, however, the 
eifect of causing a sauve gut pent style of retreat amidst the 
Malays ; and at the end of ten minutes the sweeps of the prahus 
were in full work, and the whole party rapidly making their 
way up the river once more to some fresh hiding-place, from 
which they could issue to deal ruin and destruction wherever 
they pleased. 



CHAPTER XVIL 



HOW DICK BUYS A RAJAH, AND HIS FIRST LUFF OBJECTS. 

The rapid rate at which the tw^o prahus went away from the 
island after the attacking party had scrambled in was sufficient 
to show those on board the ** Startler" how impossible it would 
be to overtake them by means of boats. The only way would 
be to surprise their crews, or to sink them with the guns of the 
steamer next time they tried to pass down the river. 

Congratulations in plenty were exchanged as soon as the com- 
munications were effected, though a good deal of annoyance was 
felt at being again out-manoeuvred by the Malay cunning. 

One thing was very evident, and that was that there would be 
no safety for the residency while so daring a chieftain as Rajah 
Gantang was at liberty, with his two cleverly managed prahus. 

No further alarms took place during the night, and in the 
morning the amount of damage done was found to be nothing 
more than a little carpentering and painting would restore. The 
real damage done was to the British prestige, which, in spite of 
the brave defence, had received a blow in the eyes of the Malays. 

Judging the matter fairly next morning, Mr Linton and the 
officers came to the conclusion, after a careful inspection, that 
though it would have been necessary for the occupants of the 
residency to have fled to the little fort, half-a-dozen such desul- 
tory attacks would have done the latter no real harm. 

" No," said Major Sandars, aloud; " for my part, if provisioned, 
I should see no difficulty in holding our place against half-a- 
dozen rajahs. There is only one way in which we could be hit.*' 

"And that is ?*' said Captain Horton. 

''By a surprise such as they treated us to last night. There is 
no other way in which they could harm us." 

Adam Gray heard his words, and in silence made an addition 
to them. 

" They could harm us by treachery, or by the neglect of our 
sentries." 





The dark scene of the previous night flashed across his mind 
as he thought this, and he recalled Private Sim's recumbent form 
amidst the grass, wondering the while whether he ought not to 
relate what had taken place, and so obtain for the itWovf the 
punishment he deserved. 

Finally, he made up his mind to let matters take their course, 
after giving Sim to understand that he should report him if such 
a thing came under his notice again. 

The sultan sent word that he was most grieved to hear of this 
new attack, and begged the resident to spare no pains to root the 
rajah and his followers off the face of the earth. He assured Mr 
Linton, by his messengers, that he felt the insult as bitterly as if 
it had been offered to himself; while even now, surrounded as 
he was by faithful followers, he never dared sleep twice in the 
same place in his. house, for fear that an envoy of the rajah 
should pass a kris up between the bamboos that formed the 
flooring, and assassinate him. 

The message sent back was that no effort should be spared to 
rid the river of so dangerous a neighbour; but opportunity failed 
to offer for carrying out the promise. 

Anywhere within a mile or two of the sultan's campong the 
people were ready enough to give information to the English, 
when a boat was sent to cruise about and endeavour to find 
where the rajah had hidden; but beyond that distance they 
were met with stern looks of distrust, and it was evident to the 
officers in charge that the rajah was perfectly safe, his influence 
being too great amongst the people for any one to act as in- 
former. 

This added a good deal to the feeling of insecurity felt at the 

residency ; and to counteract this the ship's carpenters were set 

to work to contrive stout shutters with loopholes for barricading, 
and also make the doors more secure. 

The fort with its little barrack was already pretty safe, and of 
course so long as the steamer lay there, any attacking prahus 
could be literally blown out of the river ; but there was always 
the risk of the steamer being called away, and in view of this Mr 
Linton increased the arms and ammunition at his house, and also 
asked for an extra sentry. 

In a few days the night attack had lost the greater part of its 
terrors, for the steamer was not likely to be moved at present, 
and boats were almost constantly out patrolling the river in 
search of the enemy. 

Every sampan or prahu that came down the stream was 
stopped, boarded, and searched, at first greatly to the annoyanct 




of their occupants. Several times over efforts were made to slip 
by, but the report of a heavy gun fired across their bows 
brought the Malays to their senses, and they humbly submitted 
to the overhauling. 

These boats were for the most part laden with rice, fruit, or 
slabs of tin, and of these every rajah up the river made a practice 
of taking toll for payment of his permission to pass down the 
stream. 

The occupants of a prahu then might already have paid tax 
two or three times, and the appearance of this new power in the 
river was resented strongly ; but when it was found that no tin 
was taken from them, and that when rice, or fruit, or poultry was 
taken, the full market value was paid in dollars, a strong friendly 
feeling sprang up mingled with respect. 

The news soon spread, and from that time whenever a trading 
boat came down from the upper country, the sight of an English 
boat was sufficient to make the Malays lie on their oars or pole, 
and await the coming of the English officer to board. 

There came quite a calm over the little settlement about this 
time. The rajah was not heard of, and information, true or 
false, was brought in that the prahus were high up the stream, 
where they had been rowed during a flood, and taken up a 
tributary of the main river, where, on the cessation of the flood, 
they remained grounded and out of reach. 

The sultan seemed to have forgotten his disappointment about 
the ladies, and the soldiers and sailors were enjojdng a time of 
indolent ease, their greatest excitement being a little drill. Pro- 
visions were plentiful, fruit abundant, with as much native tobacco 
as the men liked to buy, at a most moderate price, and in spite 
of the steamy heat the people were perfectly happy. 

Ali, the young chief, had been again to see Bob Roberts on 
board; but as yet the visit had not been returned, the attack 
upon the residency having put a stop to all leave for the time 
being ; but as the officers were getting less strict, the middy was 
looking forward to the day when he could go ashore. In the 
meanwhile he indulged himself with a little fishing from out the 
chains. 

Doctor Bolter was about the happiest man at the island, for 
now that he had got his sanitary matters put right, and his 
wounded men well, he had ample time for following his favourite 
pursuit of natural history. 

The sailors were in a high state of delight over what they 
called the " Bolter's weakness," and out of gratitude to him for 
many a little bit of doctoring, they took him everything they 



could get hold of that flew, crept, crawled, ran, or swam, 
bothering him almost to death. For Jack could not see the 
necessity for refraining from presenting the doctor with a fire-fly, 
because Tom had taken him a dozen the day before, and Bill two 
dozen the day before that. 

" Wasn*t his flies as good as Bill's, or Tom's ? Well, then, 
mind yer own business, and let him mind his." 

Dick came back from the shore beaming one day, with a 
large black monkey under his arm, held by a stout piece of 
chain, and a dog collar round its loins. 

" Hallo, Dick ! " said one of his messmates. Bill Black, as soon 
as he climbed on board. "Where did you find your little 
brother ? " 

" 'Tain*t no brother o' mine," said Dick seriously ; " he's 
Black, and his name's Joseph, ain't it Joey ? " 

The monkey wrinkled its forehead, and its restless eyes ran 
over one after the other of the group as the sailors gathered 
round, who now began laughing, 

" Well, he's a handsome chap at all events," said Bill, putting 
out his hand to pat the monkey on the head. 

** Don't touch him, lad," growled Dick, by way of caution ; 
"he bites." 

" Get out," said Bill. " Now then, old man, how are you ?" 

" Chick ¡ª chack ¡ª squitter ¡ª witter ¡ª chack," cried the monkey, 
snapping at the sailor's hand and giving it a sharp nip. 

" There, I told you so," said Dick. 

" Hallo, what have you got there, Dick ? " said Bob Roberts, 
coming up, attracted by the laughing. 

"Native gentleman, sir, I bought for four dollars," said Dick, 
seriously. " He's a rar-jah I think, only he hadn't time to get 
his toggery and his kris afore he come aboard." 

" Didn't know the native gentlemen had tails," said Bob, 
smiling. *' Hallo, old chap, how are you? Have a bite?" 

He held out half a biscuit that he happened to have in his 
jacket pocket, and the monkey looked at him curiously, as it 
held out one long thin black hand, flinchingly, as if expecting to 
be teased. 

Twice it essayed to get the biscuit, but always flinched, till 
Bob took a step more in advance, when the animal snatched the 
coveted morsel and began to eat it ravenously. 

" Why, it's half-starved, Dick," said the middy. 

" Yes, sir, he tried to get a piece of Bill Black's finger, but 
Bill cut up rough, and wouldn't let him have it." 

Here there was a fresh burst of laughter, in which Bill, whose 
finger was, after all, only pinched, heartily joined. 




" What are you going to do with him, Dick ? " said Bob 
Roberts. 

" Well, sir," said Dick, with a dry wrinkle or two extra on his 
mahogany physiognomy, " I was going to ask the skipper if he'd 
like to have the gent for a new middy, seeing as you, sir, have 
got to be quite a grown man now." 

" Don't you be cheeky, Dick," said Bob, indignantly. 

" No, sir, I won't," said the old sailor humbly ; '* but on second 
thoughts, which is allers the best, Mr Roberts, sir, I thought as 
the skipper Avouldn't have a uniform as would fit him, so I said 
as I'd take him on to the island, where they'd soon make a sojer 
of him." 

" Now look here, Dick," said Bob, " I take no end of impu- 
dence from you, but let there be some end to it Now then, 
have you done joking?" 

" Yes, sir, but he would look well in a red jacket, wouldn't he?" 

" What are you going to do with the monkey ?" said Bob, 
peremptorily. 

" Well, sir," said Dick, seeing that he had gone far enough, 
** I was up in the campong there, and I bought him of one of 
the niggers as used him to pick cokey-nuts." 

" Oh, yes, of course," said Bob, derisively. 

" He will," said Dick ; "and I bought him because, I says to 
myself, I says. Here's just the sorter thing our doctor would be 
glad to have, and he'd pin a long name to him directly, and say 
as he's a Blackskinnius Monkinius, or something of the kind." 

" And are you going to take it to the doctor ?'' said Bob. 

"Yes, sir, now, directly I've showed you how he can pick 
cokey-nuts. Bill Black, mate, just step down and bring that 
ball o' stout fishing line out o' the locker, will you ? " 

The sailor addressed went down, and returned directly after 
to Dick, who undid the chain, and tied one end of the stout 
fishing cord to the monkey's strap. 

The httle animal had been munching away at the biscuit in a 
quaint semi-human fashion ; but as soon as Dick had fastened 
one end of the cord to the belt, it seemed to know what was 
wanted, for it squatted upon the deck, looking intelligently up in 
the sailor's face. 

" There, ain't he an old un ? " said Dick. " Now then, Yusuf, 
be kraja." 

As the monkey heard the last two words, it sprang up the 
rigging to one of the great blocks, which in his mind represented 
the cocoa-nuts it was to bring down, and seizing one it tried hard 
to twist it off, chattering angrily, till Dick gave the cord a jerk, 




when the animai bounded to another block, and tried hard to 
fetch it off, going so far as to gnaw at the rope that held it, till 
Dick gave the cord another jerk, when it came down. 

" Well done, old man," said Dick, patting the animal, which 
kept close to his leg, as \ilQ^m% that it must find protection of 
him, when Dick took it under his arm. 

"Are you going now, Dick? " said Bob, eagerly. 

"Yes, sir." 

" Wait a moment, and let me see if I can get leave. Why, 
look here ; the doctor's coming aboard." 

True enough, Doctor Bolter was seen in a sampan rowed by 
one of the Malays, and a minute or two later he was on deck. 

" Monkey, eh ? " he said sharply, as he saw the animal. 
Semnopithecus Maurus, I should say. What are you going to 
do with it ? " ^ 

" Dick was going to give it to you, sir," said Bob, smiling. 

" Give it ¡ª to me ? " cried the doctor. " Thanks ; no, my rftan, 
I must draw the line somewhere. Keep it on board. Climb the 
rigging, and that sort of thing. Here, you Roberts, tell the 
captain Fm here." 

Bob went off, and then brought a message to the doctor, who 
went into the cabin. On returning to where Dick was standing, 
that worthy was scratching in a melancholy way at his head. 

" I'm *bout done over this here monkey, sir," he said. " I 
can't go and get the chap to take him back." 

"Keep him, and make a pet oi him, Dick," said the middy, 
holding out a lump of sugar to the subject of their conversation. 

" No, sir, that wouldn't do. The skipper wouldn't stand it ] 
and besides, if the monkey was mine the chaps would lead him 
such a life, teaching him to smoke tobacco and drink grog. 
Will you have him, sir ? " 

" No, Dick," was the reply. " I've no money to spend on 
monkeys." 

" I didn't mean that, sir," said Dick. " I meant it for a present 
for the doctor. Will you have him as a present, and take care 
of him ? " 

" Of course I will, Dick, but I don't like taking it." 

" Why, bless your 'art, Mr Roberts, sir, you'd be doing me a 
kindness by taking of it. You take it, and you can lam him all 
sorts of tricks. Why, look at the pretty crittur, how he takes to 
you ! " 

" Pretty crittur, indeed ! " cried Bob. " You mean how he 
takes to the sugar. Here, come along, old maa Come, rouse 
up." 





To Bob*s surprise the monkey got up, and came close to him, 
while upon Dick making a motion as if to refasten the chain, 
the animal snarled and snapped at him. 

" There now, look at that," cried Dick. " You see you'll have 
to take it, Master Roberts, sir." 

" 1*11 take him for a day or two," said Bob ; " but I expect the 
skipper won't let me keep it." 

" Lor* bless you, sir, he'll let you keep it, see if he don't," said 
the old sailor, and his words proved true. 



CHAPTER XVIII. 



HOW BOB ROBERTS WENT A FISHINa 



Bob Roberts liked having the monkey, but there was a sore 
side to the matter; it was unpleasant to hear that the first 
lieutenant had said that one monkey was enough in the ship, 
and they did not want two. 

" It*s as good as telling me to my face that I'm a monkey," 
said Bob to himself. " Now look here, I shall just go and ask 
him to lend me the dingy to sit in and fish, and old Dick to 
manage it ; and if he says no, I shall just tell him that his remark 
about the monkey was precious ungentlemanly. " 

So Bob went up to the first lieutenant and preferred his 
request, fully anticipating a refusal, but to his surprise the officer 
in question was all that was urbane and pleasant. 

''Fishing from the dingy, eh, Roberts?" he said, smiling. 

" Yes, sir, I thought I might catch a basket if I fished from the 
dingy. I lose so many hauling them up the side into the chains." 

" To be sure ¡ª yes ¡ª of course," said the lieutenant " On one 
condition, Roberts, you can have it" 

"What's that, sir?" 

" Two conditions I should say," replied the lieutenant " The 
boat is to be properly cleaned afterwards, and we are to have a 
dish of fresh fish for the gun-room dinner." 

"Certainly, sir," said Bob, laughing, "if I catch them." 

"You must catch them," said the lieutenant. "Ah, I remem- 
ber the days when I used to be fond of going up the Thames 
fishing, and ¡ª there, be off with you as soon as you like." 

The first lieutenant smiled as he felt that he had been about 
to prose over his old days ; and Bob having obtained leave for 
Dick to be his companion, and to manage the boat if he should 
elect to go up or down the river, instead of lying astern hitched 
on to a ring-bolt, was soon over the side, with plenty of hooks 
and lines and bait 




" This here's a rum sorter game, Mr Roberts, sir," said old 
Dick, as soon as he had fastened the boat's painter to a ring in 
the stem part of the great steamer. "I'm afraid I shan't be 
strong enough for the job." 

Dick glanced at the great muscles in his sun-browned arms, 
with a smile of pride, and then stared at the middy, who turned 
upon him sharply. 

" Now look here, old Dicky," he said, " youVe come here to 
manage the dingy for me, and not to preach and drive away all 
the fishes. So just light your pipe and sit still and hold your 
tongue, and if I find you are not strong enough to do that. 111 
hail the steamer, and ask them to send me down another hand," 

Old Dick chuckled and grinned, and without more ado took 
out and filled a short black pipe, which he lit with a burning 
glass, and then sat contentedly sucking at it, while Bob, who had 
provided himself with a bamboo about ten feet long ¡ª a natural 
fishing-rod in one piece ¡ª fitted on a thin line, baited his hook, 
and began to fish in the deep stream. 

The sun poured down his rays like a shower of burning silver, 
and in spite of the puggaree with which he had provided him- 
self, Bob found the heat almost too much for him, and looked 
enviously at old Dick, who lay back in the bows of the little 
cockle-shell of a boat, with his knees in, his chin pointing up- 
wards, and his arms resting on the sides, literally basking in the 
hot glow. 

The line kept floating down with the stream, and Bob kept 
pulling it up and dropping it in again close to the boat, but there 
was no sharp tug at the bait ; and after half an hour of this work 
a peculiar drowsy feeling began to come over -the middy, the 
bright flashing river ran on, and the palms and attap-thatched 
houses on the shore began to run on too, and all looked misty 
and strange, till the rod was about to fall from his hand, his nod- 
ding head to rest itself upon his chest, and the first lieutenant's 
basket of fish to vanish into the realm of imagination ¡ª when there 
was a tremendous tug, and Bob started into wakefulness, with 
his bamboo bending nearly double, and some large fish making 
the line hiss through the water as it darted here and there. 

The contest was short and furious. Any doubts in the middy's 
mind as to the existence of fish in the river were gone, for he 
had hooked a monster. Now it was rushing up towards the 
surface, now diving down so deeply that the top of Bob^s bamboo 
dipped in the water, and then it was sailing up and down stream, 

anywhere in fact, but never giving the excited lad a chance of 
seeing what it was like. 



* Had I better go in arter him, sir ? " said Dick, grinning. 

"I don't know, Dick. I think ¡ª oh, I say, look at that !" 

That was Bob*s line hanging limply from his straight bamboo, 
for there was a furious rush, a dull twang, and the fish had gone. 

" He was a big 'un, sir," said Dick, refilling his pipe. "Never 
mind. Try another, sir; better luck next time." 

Bob sighed as he fitted on a fresh lead and hook, and was 
soon fishing once more, thoroughly awake now j and to his great 
delight he felt a sharp tug at his line, and striking, found that 
he had hooked a fish of a manageable size, which he soon 
hauled into the boat, and recognized as the ikan satnbilang^ a 
fish frequently sold to them by the Malays, and esteemed quite 
a delicacy. 

" It's a rum-looking one/' said Dick, examining the captive 
as Bob put on a fresh bait. " It's just like one of the eel pouts 
as we boys used to ketch down in the drains in Yorkshire." 

? In the drains, Dick ? " 

" Oh, I don't mean your drains. I mean land drains as take 
the water off a country. We used to catch lots on 'em, thick, 
short, fat fellows, but they hadn't got a lot of long beards like 
these here. What, another already I " 

" Yes, and a big one too," said Bob, excitedly, as he lugged 
out, after a sharp tussle, a handsome fish, with glistening scales, 
and a sharp back fin, bearing some resemblance to a perch. 

" That's the way, sir," said Dick, smoking contentedly in the 
bows. " I like fishing arter all." 

Bob smiled, and went on catching the little barbed fish, rapidly, 
and every now and then a good-sized fellow of a different kind. 
Two or three of the men came and leaned over the side to watch 
them for a few minutes, but the heat seemed too much for theit 
interest to be kept up, and they soon disappeared. 

There was a little audience on the further bank, though, which 
watched Bob's fishing without ceasing, though unseen by the 
young fisherman. This audience consisted of three half-nude 
Malays, l>ing in a sampan hidden amidst the reeds of the river's 
side, and these men seemed greatly interested in all that was 
going on, till, as the evening drew near, Bob, who had captured 
at least sixty fish of various sizes, sat at last completely overcome 
by the heat, and following Dick's example, for that worthy had 
gone off fast asleep, and Bob's bamboo dipped in the water, the 
line unbaited, and offering no temptations to the hungry perch. 
That was the time for which the Malays in the sampan had been 
waiting, and one of them glided over the side like a short thick 
snake, reached the shore, and then making his way up stream 




for some little distance, he softly plunged in, with nothing but a 
kris in his lingouti, or string round the waist used by the natives 
to support their loin cloths, and after swimming boldly out 
for some distance, turned over, and floated with just his nose 
above the water. 

The stream did all he required, for the Malay had calculated 
his distance to a nicety, so that he was borne unseen right to 
the steamer's bows, and then floated along her side, and round 
the stem, where a few strokes brought him into the eddy. 

Dick and the fisherman slept on soundly, so that they did not 
see a brown hand holding a keen kris raised from the water to 
divide the boat's painter, neither did they see that the same 
hand held on by the cut rope, and that the dingy was floating, 
with its strange companion, swiftly down the stream. 

At the end of ^v^ minutes it had been swept round a bend, 
and was out of sight of the steamer. 

So likewise was the sampan from which the Malay had come, 
while one of its occupants steered it into the dingy's course, and 

the other crouched in the forward part with a keen-headed limb- 
ing or spear. 



CHAPTER XIX. 



HOW BOB AND OLD DICK FINISHED THEIR DAY. 

The very motion of the boat lulled its occupants into a deeper 
sleep as they glided on and on down the swift deep river, with 
the tall waving palms and the dark undergrowth ever slipping by 
the travellers, who had embarked now upon a journey whose end 
was death. 

The sampan floated quietly on in attendance, and the Malay, 
whose hand was twisted in the boat's painter, kept beneath the 
bows of the little boat with merely his face above water, the dingy 
now floating down stem foremost, and, having been guided into 
the swiftest part of the stream, always faster and faster towards 
its journey's end. 

Utterly unconscious of danger, and dreaming comfortably of 
being in a land of unlimited do-nothingism, Dick's head lay 
across the gunwale of the boat in terrible proximity to the Malay's 
kris ; while Bob, with his chin on his chest, was far away in his 
old home, in a punt of which he had lost the pole, and it was 
being whirled along faster and faster through the shallows towards 
the mill down at the bend of the river. 

He was very comfortable, and in spite of an uneasy position 
his sleep was very sweet, unconscious as he was of anything 
having the semblance of danger. 

And now the dingy was a good half mile below where the 
steamer was moored. They had passed the last house standing 
on its stout bamboo props, some distance above, and the river 
had curved twice in its bed, so that they had long been concealed 
from any one upon the deck, and still the Malays hesitated, or 

rather waited the time to make their spring. They had no 

special enmity against the occupants of the dingy in particular, 
but they were three of the most daring followers of Rajah Gantang, 
who had assumed the part of fishermen in a sampan, with a 
rough cast net, so as to hang about the neighbourhood of the 
" Startler," and pick up information for their chief, who, so 




far from being, with his two prahus, hors de combat^ was merelv 
lying up in a creek hidden by bamboos and palms, awaiting his 
time to take deadly vengeance upon the destroyers of his stockade 
and miners of his income from the passing boats. 

The opportunity of cutting off a couple of the hated infidels 
who had forced themselves into the peaceful country, where their 
rajah, like many another, had been free to carry on a happy 
lawless existence, cutting throats, selling slaves, committing acts 
of piracy, and indulging in every vile and sensuous custom, was 
one not to be lost. Rajah Gantang wanted no peace, or order, 
or prosperity in the land where he could seize on the wretched 
people, and make them pay him in gold, tin, rice, poultry, fruit, 
or any precious commodity, for the right to pass down the river, 
which he, and a few more of his stamp, looked upon as theirs by 
right 3 so that his three followers were certain to receive praise 
and reward for the proof they might be able to show of the death 
of a couple of the giaours. 

For the Malays are good Mohammedans, and look upon the 
slaying of a Christian as a most meritorious act, but at the same 
time they were too cautious to endanger their plot or their own 
lives by undue haste. 

Hence it came about that the dingy was allowed to drift down 
a good three quarters of a mile before the Malays made any 
attempt, when, as the sampan closed up, and the man in her 
bows raised his limbing to throw, the savage in the water reached 

up one hand to Dick's shoulder, and struck at him with the other. 
The blow from the kris and the hurling of the spear took place 
at one and the same moment, but the touch of the Malay's hand 
upon his shoulder made Dick leap up with such a sudden start 
that the aim was bafifled, and the boat rocked so violently that 
the spear whizzed by Bob Roberts' head, and plunged into the 
water. 

In a moment more Dick had seized the little scull that lay in 
the ding)', and struck the Malay in the river so severe a blow on 
tlie head that the man went under, to rise again a few yards away, 

and then paddle feebly towards the sampan, whose occupants, 
spear xn hand, now made a desperate attack upon those they 
meant to make their prey. 

Bob Roberts never quite knew how it all took place, but he 
had a lively recollection of old Dick standing up in the boat, 
sweeping the little oar round his head, and striking fiercely at 
the men who thrust at him with their spears. 

It was a most unequal encounter, for while the Malays were 
upon comparatively substantial ground, the dingy rocked to and 





fro, and it only needed the hand of the half-drowned Malay to 
catch at the side, in a frantic effort to save his life, to send it 
right over, and Bob and the English sailor into the stream. 

Bob felt that his minutes were numbered, for as he struck out 
for the shore the Malays in the sampan uttered a savage yell, 
and came in pursuit. 

Dick swam to his side on the instant, and the dingy went float- 
ing away with the half-drowned Malay, while now the sampan was 
close after them, and as one of their enemies rowed, the other 
stood in the bows ready to thrust at them with his spear. 

" Swim away, my lad," cried old Dick, hoarsely, "and get ashore, 
I'm only an old 'un, and I'll get a grip of his spiker if I can.'' 

" No, no, Dick, keep with me," panted Bob, who saw in Dick's 
words a determination on the brave old fellow's part to sacrifice 

his life that he might live. 

" No, my lad, it's no use. Swim on," cried Dick, " they're here. 
Tell the skipper I did my dooty like a man." 

As he bravely shouted these words in his excitement, he turned 
to face his enemies, the Malay with the limbing thrusting savagely 
at him. 

But Dick was quick enough to strike the limbing aside, and 
grasp it with both hands, when a struggle for its possession took 

place. 

It was a futile effort, though, upon Dick's part, for the other 

Malay dropped his oar, and picking up another spear, came to 

his comrade's help. 

Bob was paralyzed, and the desire was upon him to shut his 
eyes, and escape seeing the death of the brave old sailor, who 
was giving his life to save his young officer; but in place of 
closing his eyes, the middy felt that he was forced to hold them 
open, and fixed them upon the terrible scene ; and his lips parted 
to utter a cry of warning, when, just as the third Malay was about 
to deliver his thrust, to avert which Dick was powerless, there 
was a sharp whizzing noise through the air, accompanied by a 
loud report, and then another whizzing, and a second report 

Bob turned his head to see the smoke rising from above a 
good-sized naga, or dragon-boat, coming up the stream, and at 
the sight thereof the Malays seized their oars, gave the sampan a 
sharp impulse which brought them within reach of their comrade, 
and after helping him on board, they rowed off with all their 
might, with the dragon-boat coming up fast. 

But the naga had to stop and pick up the middy and Dick 
who had swum, as soon as they were free from enemies, towards 
the dingy, which they reached as the dragon-boat came up. 




" Are you hurt ? " said a voice in English, and a delicate 
brown hand was stretched down from the naga's side to help Bob 
in, where, as he sank down panting, he recognized Ali, the young 
Malay chief. 

" No : only half-drowned. But Dick ¡ª save Dick." 

''I'm all right, Mr Roberts, sir,'* said the old sailor, hoarsely; 
"and the dingy's made fast astern." 

" But are you speared, Dick ? " said the middy. 

" Not as I knows on, sir. I ain't felt nothing at present, but 
I don't say as I ain't got a hole in me somewheres." 

" They'll get away," said Ali, just then, as he stood up with a 
double gun in his hand. " Only small shot," he said, tapping 
the stock. '* I have no bullets," 

As he spoke he clapped the piece to his shoulder and fired 
twice rapidly, as the Malays in the sampan seemed to dive 
through a screen of reeds into some creek beyond. 

The pattering hail of straggling small shot hastened their 
movements, and then Bob proceeded to thank the young chief 
for saving their lives, explaining to him, as far as he knew, how 
it was that they had fallen into such a plight. 

" You must take more care," said Ali, in a low voice. " Our 
people would not harm you ; we are friends, but plenty hate you 
much. But you are safe." 

"Yes," said Bob, who, with all the elasticity of youth, was fast 

recovering himself, " we are quite safe ; and the fish are there too. 
I say, though, old chap, I am so much obliged." 

**Oh, no," said the young Malay, laughing, as he coloured 
through his brown skin ; " it is nothing. I saw a wretch trying 
to do harm, and I fired at him with small duck shot You would 
do the same." 

" Yes, and with bigger shot too if I had a chance," said Bob 
excitedly, as he proceeded to wring all the water he could out 
of his clothes, for now the excitement was over he felt slightly 

chilly. 

Meanwhile the boatmen were rowing steadily up stream, it 
having been seen to be useless to attempt pursuit of the Malays 
in the sampan, and they were rapidly nearing the steamer. 

" *Scuse me, Mr Roberts, sir," said Dick, who was very wet 
and spongy, " but your knife's littler than mine, and if you'd pick 
a few o' these here small shot outer my arms, I'd feel obliged." 

Examination showed that Dick had received quite a dozen 
shots in his arms and chest They had just buried themselves 
beneath the skin, and were easily extracted by means of an open 
knife, after which Dick declared himself to be much better. 




" They've give them Malay chaps a tickling, I know," he cried, 
laughing. " I'm such a thick-skinned 'un, I am, that they only 
just got through. I'll bet an even penny theyVe gone a good 
inch into them niggers." 

The boat now reached the steamer, where, after a warm and 
hearty parting, Bob stepped into the dingy with Dick, and the 
remains of the painter were made fast to the cut fragment hang- 
ing from the ring. 

" Now, if you'll take my advice, Mr Roberts," said the old 
sailor, " you'll step up and get to your berth, and change your 
togs, while I get out the fish and wash the dingy. Being wet 
won't hurt me. What's more is, as I shouldn't say nought about 
the scrimmage; specially as we're not hurt, or you won't get 
leave again." 

" But you are hurt, Dick." 

" Bah ! Don't call that hurt, dear ladL I'm as right as nine- 
pence. You go on, and think about what I've said." 

" I will, Dick," said Bob ; " but take care of the fish." 

" Ay, ay, sir." 

" But I say, Dick." 

" Ay, ay, sir." 

"How did the dingy get loose? You must have gone to 
sleep." 

Dick rubbed his ear. " Well, sir, suttunly I think I must have 

shut one eye ; but how the dingy got loose is more than I can 
say, unless them spiteful niggers cut us adrift But you get 
aboard. We am't been missed." 

But Dick was wrong : they had been missed, and the sentry 
had reported the coming of the naga-boat ; so that as soon as 
Bob had changed his wet clothes for dr}% he had to go to the 
captain's cabin and relate the whole affair. Those on board 
merely supposing that they had gone down the river to fish, it 
was a remark made aloud by the young chief Ali that had started 
a train of ideas in the first lieutenant's head that something was 
wrong. 

"Ah," said Captain Horton, " that was well done of the young 
chief. But it seems to me that we've a lot of ugly scoundrels 
about to deal with, and we must take care, gentlemen, we must 
take care." 

" Yes, Captain Horton," said the first lieutenant, "and we 
will. But are there no fish there for us, Roberts, eh?" he 
continued. 

" Yes, sir, there are," said Bob. " I've caught you a capital 
dish. And very nearlv got turned into ground bait for my 



pains," he said to himself, as he went out to find Dick. " I say, 
Dick," he said, as he met him with the basket of fish, " did you 
think about crocodiles when you were in the water ? " 

" No, sir, never once ; there was too much to think about 
beside." 

" Sq there was, Dick," said Bob. " There's sixpence : go and 
ask them to give you a glass of grog to keep out the cold, but 
first change your things. I'll take the fish." 

" Right, sir," said Dick : but he finished the dingy first, said 
that there'd be a row about the cut painter, and then had his 
glass of grog before he changed his things. 



CHAPTER XX. 



A RUN AFTER A RAJAH. 

Fresh news reached the residency the next day from the sultan, 
who sent word that he had had a very threatening letter from 
Rajah Gantang, declaring that if he did not break at once with 
the English, ruin, destruction, and death would be his fate before 
many months had passed. 

This threatening language had completely upset the sultan, so 
the chief who bore the message said, and he begged that his 
friends and allies, the English, would not let him suffer for his 
fidelity to them ; and when asked what he wished done, the chief 
replied that while Rajah Gantang lived there would be no peace, 
for the rajah's emissaries were in every part of the country, ready 
to carry news, to rise on their lord's behalf, even to assassinate, 
should their orders be to that extent 

The result of all this was a promise that the rajah should be 
found, if possible, though how it was to be done the resident 
could not say. 

Just in the nick of time a good-sized prahu came down the 
river, and on anchoring by the steamer her captain went on 
board, with a pitiful tale of how he had been treated higher up 
the river. 

Believing the rajah's power to be broken, he had been on his 
way down, laden with a good cargo of tin, when he was sum- 
moned by a prahu to stop. This he refused to do, not knowing 
who summoned him, when he was attacked by a party from the 
prahu, two of those on board were killed, and he himself severely 
wounded. 

In proof of his assertions he displayed a spear wound in his 
arm and the stab of a kris in his shoulder. 

Doctor Bolter was sent for, and the master of the prahu had 
his wounds dressed, after which he implored the help of Captain 
Horton to recover the slabs of tin that had been taken from his 
boat, almost ruining him, so severe was the loss. 




The news that one of the prahus was about, up the river, set 
the ship's company on the gut vive once more. The master of 
the prahu, having been robbed of his cargo, had no farther aim, 
and was glad enough to offer his services as guide. When asked 
as to the depth of the river, he declared that the steamer could 
ascend for another twenty miles, so it was decided to make a 
fresh expedition against this disturber of the country ; but the 
whole of the plans were kept a profound secret, lest the time and 
arrangements of the party should again be conveyed to the rajah 
by some one or other of his spies. 

Preparations were quietly made, then, and fifty men from the 
island taken on board the steamer, a few at a time, so as not to 
attract notice ; and when at last the expeditionary party started, 
the occupants of the residency were dining with Major and Mrs 
Sandars at the officers* quarters, where they quietly stayed. 

Steam had been got up before dark, and every preparation 
made, for this time the "Startler'' was Xo go up stream : and at 
last, when night rapidly succeeded day, as it does in the tropics, 
the steamer lay waiting for the rising of the moon, and then her 
screw slowly revolved, and she began to feel her way gently 
against the swift stream ¡ª the people of the campong only seeing 
her at nightfall moored as usual, and not awaking to the fact 
that she had gone until the morning, of course far too late to 
give any warning to the rajah if they were so disposed. 

Patiently and almost Silently the great steamer forced its way 
on for quite a mile, when, there being no fear now of being heard, 
the propeller revolved more rapidly, and the waves made by the 
vessel ran washing the roots oi the trees on either side. 

The moon was just at its full, and seemed as it rose to silver 
the tops of the trees, while it X^it the river in utter darkness, 
though it marked out its course through the dense jungle where 
it seemed to have to cut its way, the great trees growing to the 
water's edge, and overhanging the stream. 

A rapid rate was impossible, on account of the way in which 
the river wound about ; but it kept so wide and deep that there 
was but littie difficulty in its navigation, especially as not a single 
craft of any kind was encountered. 

The master of the prahu pointed out a couple of campongs as 
they passed them, on the banks; but they might have been 
villages of the dead, so silent and unoccupied did they seem, as 
the steamer slowly glided by. 

The moon rose higher and higher, till the river was like a 
broad path of silver, and along this they continued their course 
with a man constantly sounding from the chains, but always to 



show an average depth of about four fathoms, with a thick, soft, 
muddy bottom, upon which the steamer could have met with no 
harm had she taken the ground. 

Silence had been ordered, but as the Jacks and soldiers sat 
beneath the shelter of the bulwarks, or leaned over and watched 
the smooth, silvery river, they conversed in low whispers about 
the expedition, and wondered what luck was to attend them now. 

The plan was evident to all, it was intended to spare the men 
all the risk they could, by getting the steamer within range of 
the prahus, and sinking them with her big guns. If this could 
not be done, through the shallowing of the river, of course the 
boats would have to continue the journey up stream ; but even 
then it was Captain Horton's intention to make use of the boat 
guns as much as possible, and save the men from the dis- 
advantages of boarding vessels that were so carefully protected. 

Higher up the river still, and past the stockade, whose remains 
showed plainly in the soft moonlight Ever and again strange 
noises could be heard from the jungle on either side, as the 
various denizens of the thick tangle of vegetation were alarmed 
by the throb and rush of the steamer, with its strange wave that 
rushed up to the bank, and startled many a nocturnal creature 
from its lurking-place, where it lay watching in search of prey. 

To Bob Roberts* great delight, he found that Tom Long was one 
of the party, for, being declared well enough by the doctor, he 
had put in a sort of claim, as having been of the last force, to a 
right to belong to this. 

This was conceded to him by Major Sandars, and he was 
burning to distinguish himself, if he could obtain a chance. 

Very formidable he seemed, with his sword ground to the 
keenest possible edge, and a revolver in his belt ; though in 
appearance Bob Roberts was scarcely less offensive in the way 
of weapons, as he took pains to show his friend. 

It must have been close upon midnight, when the man in the 
chains, who had continued to take soundings, announced by 
degrees the shallowing of the river. 

For quite twenty miles it had kept to its muddy bottom and 
uniform depth, but during the past half-hour the mud had given 
place to clean- washed gravel, the depth grew less, and at last the 
anchor was let go, for it was not considered safe to proceed 
farther. But it was not until there was less than a foot of water 
beneath the vessel that the order was given ; while even then 
there was so much way upon the steamer that she touched upon 
the gravel lightly before she gradually settled back and swung 

to her cable. 




Quickly and silently four boats were lowered, each containing 
twenty men, and at the word of command the party, under the 
joint command of Lieutenant Johnson and Captain Sraithers, 
pushed off, with the good wishes of all left on board. 

The master cf the prahu was in the foremost boat, and ac- 
cording to his account they were still about a couple of miles 
below where the attack took place, he having been mistaken 
about the steamer*s draught of water. His opinion was that 
both the prahus would be found lying in the Qualla, or mouth 
of a river higher up, and towards this point the boats steadily 
ascended without any tmdue bustle, for the object of the officers 
in charge was to get the men up to the point fresh and ready for 
the task in hand. 

Each boat carried a gun running on slides, and upon the 
proper serv^ice of these guns depended a good deal of the success 
of the expedition. 

They had been rowing steadily on for above half an hour, 
when suddenly from their left a bright line of light cut the black 
darkness of the forest, and was followed by a sharp report. 

For a moment the course of the boats was checked, and one 
was directed to pull in and see who the enemy might be, but 
directly after there was another report a couple of hundred yards 
higher up, and then another, and another, 

" Catch a weasel asleep/' said Lieutenant Johnson, grimly ; 

*' that signal yvill run right up to the prahus. WeVe got to deal 
with some one who has his wits about him." 

So indeed it proved ; for a quarter of an hour later, as they 
still pushed steadily on in line, there came a warning from the 
first boat in the shape of a dull heavy report, and the other boats 
sheered out of the right line, ready to deliver their own fire. 

For plainly enough, though wearing a gray shadowy appear- 
ance, a couple of prahus could be seeu coming swiftly down the 
stream, the long rows of oars on either side beating the water 
with a wonderfully regular stroke, and sending them along at 
quite a startling rate. 

Shot after shot was fired, but with what effect the occupants 
of the boats could not tell, for no heed was paid to the firing, 
save that the prahus seemed to increase their speed, and were 
steered so as to run down tlie enemy that tried to check their 
way. 

It was a matter of little more than a minute from the first 
sighting of the vessels, each of which was five or six times the 
size of the largest boats, and their disappearance round the 
point below, with the water foaming behind them, and the 




English boats in full pursuit- Several shots had been fired, 
for each boat found its opportunity at last, and the firing was 
kept up till the enemy had gone. 

The attempt to overtake them was, however, felt to be hope- 
less, for the prahus went at least two yards to the boats' one ; 
all the officers could hope was, that one of the shots had done 
irreparable mischief, or that, warned by the firing, the steamer 
would sink them as they passed. 

More they could not have done ; for to have remained still 
was to have been sunk, the prahus dashing down at a fearful 
rate, and evidently seeking a collision; so, angry and disap- 
pointed, the pursuit was kept up, every ear being attent for the 
first shot sent at the enemy's boats by the steamer ; but they 
waited in vain, for when at last they came within challenging 
distance, it was to find that no prahus had been seen. 

"Was a strict watch kept, sir?" asked Lieutenant Johnson, 
sharply. 

**Yes, of course," said Captain Horton. "I have been on 
deck with my night-glass ever since yon started, and as soon as 
we heard your guns the men stood ready, lanyard in hand, to fire 
at any vessel that tried to pass." 

" Then they must have gone off through some side stream, and 
come out into the river lower down." 

Captain Horton stamped his foot with rage, but nothing 
cotQd be done until morning ; for if the steamer had set off at 
once, it might have been only to pass the prahus in the darkness 
of some creek. 

Morning then was impatiently awaited, and at the first streak 
of daylight a couple of boats at once set off, to find a side 
branch of the river about a mile above the steamer, and that 
it came out in the main stream once more, half a mile lower 
down. 

They rowed through it to find the current swift and deep, 
though the place resembled a narrow canal. It was a short 
cut off through a bend of the river, and at last, vexed and 
discomfited, the steamer went rapidly back, to learn that the 
prahus had passed the island at daybreak, and had fired a few 
defiant shots from their lelahs as they rapidly went by. 

" Never mind, Tom Long," said Bob, as the former shivered 
in his great coat, for the early morning was damp and cold, 
" only toke time, and we shall put salt on their tails yet." 

"No, sir," said old Dick, shaking his head seriously, "it 
strikes me as you never won't catch them as manages them 
two swift boats. They're too clever for us, they are. But 





only think ot two big bits of Her Majesty's army and navy 
like us being set at nought by this here savage prince." 

" Wait a bit, Dick, and you'll see," said Bob. ** It strikes 
me that I'm the man for settling Mr Rajah Gantang ; and if it 
does come to me to do so, why let him look out." 

"Ay, ay, sir; and his men too. I owe 'em one for that 
boat affair. The cowards ! when a fellow was asleep I " 

**Ah," said Tom Long, discontentedly, '* it's all very well to 
talk, but I want my breakfast ; " and he made haste off to his 
quarters as soon as the steamer's boats had set the military 
part of the expeditionary party ashore. 



CHAPTER XXI. 



HOW ABDULLAH SHOWED THE SMOOTH SIDE OF HIS WAYS. 

It was decided after this to wait patiently for an opportunity 
to capturti Rajah Gantang, or to destroy his prahus ; and mean- 
while life at the residency went on very pleasantly. The men 
at the fort had settled down into an easy-going existence, and 
under the doctor^s guidance a careful examination was made 
of the little island, to clear it of everything in the shape of 
noxious reptile and insect, as far as was possible. 

The example of the Malays was followed by the construction 
of a large bathing-place for the men, which being carefully 
stockaded round with stout bamboos, allowed the free flow of 
the river-water, without the addition of any four-footed creatures, 
in the shape of crocodiles, which were far too common to be 
pleasant, especially where lower down the river the salt water 
mingled with the fresh. In fact, it was dangerous there for a hand 
to be dragged in the water beside a boat, the hideous creatures 
being ready to make a dash at i^, darting through the stream 
as they did with great velocity, by a stroke of their powerful tails. 

The great desire on the part of the men was to go ashore, 
but, in the majority of cases, this was sternly refused. Here 
and there, though, an officer had a shooting-trip, but it was 
thought better to wait until the confidence of the natives had 
been more thoroughly won, and the disaffected party of Rajah 
Gantang dismissed. 

The sultan seemed to have quite forgotten his rejection by 
the ladies, and was most liberal in his presentations of fruit 
and fresh provisions. Every morning a boat came off with a 
load, the fore part being generally crammed with freshly-cut 
flowers ; and later on in the day the resident's boat would be 
sent ashore to return the compliment. Tom Long generally 
had the honour of being the escort, and marching a fatigue 
party up to the sultan's residence with something likely to 
gratify his highness. 





There used to be hearty laughter amongst the ofRcers at the 
quaintness of the presents, and sometimes Tom Long would 
have been glad to evade his duty had he dared ; for, as he con- 
fided to Bob Roberts, ¡ª 

" It is so confoundedly ridiculous, you know. I don't mind 
taking him up a little case of a dozen champagne pints, but 
what do you think I had to take yesterday ? " 

" I don't know/' said Bob, laughing ; " a pound of candles, 
perhaps." 

** No, not yesterday," cried Tom Long; **but I did have to 
take him a packet of composite candles, one day. Only fancy, 
you know, an officer in Her Majesty*s service marching with a 
fatigue party |up to a palm-thatched bam, to take a coffee- 
coloured savage a packet of candles for a present 1 '* 

" Mustn't look a gift horse in the mouth," said Bob, philoso- 
phically. " Present's a present, whether it's a pound of candles 
or a gold chain." 

" Bah 1 It's disgusting," said Tom Long. " It's enough to 
make a man want to part with his commission.'* 

" What '11 you take for it, Tom Long ? I think I should like 
a change. Or come, I'll swap with you. Til turn ensign, and 
you take a go at the sea ? " 

" Don't be absurd." 

" Certainly not ; but come, you didn't tell me what you took 

up yesterday." 

** Is"?," exclaimed Tom Long, flushing with annoyance ; " but 
I will tell you, for it's a scandal and a disgrace to the service, 
and Mr Linton ought to be informed against. I actually, sir, 
had to march those men all along through that jimgle with 
a box." 

" Box of what ? " said Bob ; " dominoes ? " 

" No, sir," cried Tom Long. " A box containing two bottles 
of pickles." 

" Ha, ha, ha, ha I" roared Bob. ** What were they ? Walnuts, 
or onions ? " 

" Neither," said Tom, with great dignity; "one was piccalilli, 
and the other mixed." 

"Well, I dare say he was very glad of them," said Bob. " I 
consider a good bottle of pickles, out in this benighted place, 
one of the greatest luxuries one could have.'' 

" Yes," said Tom Long, who had on a supercilious fit that 
day, " I suppose it would satisfy you." 

** All right, my noble fi-iend," thought Bob to himself; "I'll 
take you down for that some day." 





They strolled out and about the fort together for a time, and 
then out to the upper end of the island ; for though longing to 
go to the lower portion where the residency stood, both of thera 
carefully avoided that part But it so happened that soon after, 
when they directed their steps towards the landing-place, they 
found that the ladies were there, in company with the major's 
wife, talking to a couple of Malays in a sampan laden with fruit 

and flowers. 

The ladies were making liberal purchases of the delicious fruit 
and sweet-scented flowers, when, to the astonishment of Bob 
Roberts, he saw that one of the Malays was the man who had 
made so fierce an attack upon Tom Long over the durian affair. 

Seeing this they both stepped forward, when the Malay recog- 
nized him, said a few hasty words to his companion, and they 
both leaped ashore, the man of the kris salaaming profoundly, 
and remaining half prostrate before the young ensign. 

** DuUah asks pardon of his excellency," said the other man 
in good English. " He thought him an enemy who had insulted 
him, and he drew his kris. He asks now that his excellency will 

forgive him." 

''Yes, yes," said the offending Malay, without raising his 
head or his pleading hands ; and then he repeated what 
seemed to be the whole of his stock of English, " Yes, yes." 

" Dullah asks your excellencies to forgive him, and to let him 
bring fruit and flowers, and to make offerings to the English 
princes he has offended." 

" Oh, I say, Tom Long," said Bob ; " that's a little too strong, 
isn't it ? English princes ! " 

" What are we to do about the fellow ? " said Tom Long ; " tell 
the sentry to turn him off? " 

" No J what's the good ? " said Bob. " Here, leave it to me. 
I'll settle him." 

He glanced merrily at Rachel Linton as he spoke, seeming 
quite at ease in her society now ; while Tom Long appeared to 
be buttoned up in his stiflfest uniform, though he was in undress 
white. 

** Go on, then," said Tom Long in a whisper, " but don't say 
anything stupid ; the ladies can hear every word." 

"All right," said Bob. "Look here, old cockolorum," he 
continued to the Malay who interpreted, ** what has become of 
that Kling who was here before ? " 

" Gone Mirzapore, most excellent prince," said the man. 

" Come, that'll do," said Bob impatiently ; " drop all that 
eastern sugar wordings, my fine fellow, and look here ! " 





The Malay salaamed agaia 

" My friend here isn't an English prince. We are English 
officers. And my friend here says you may tell Mr Abdullah 
there that he does not bear any malice against him for the attack. 
If he asks pardon, that is enough." 

This being interpreted to Abdullah, who remained humbly 
bent, he started up, and catching Tom Long's hands, kissed 
them both, and afterwards Bob's, very much to that young 
gentleman's disgust, though Tom received the salute with a good 
deal of dignity, posing himself to look to the best advantage in 
the presence of the ladies. 

" There, that'll do now," said Bob. **It's all right, only tell 
Mr Abdullah not to be so handy with his kris again, and that I 
¡ª Mr Roberts, of Her Majesty's ship ' Startler* ¡ª think he ought 
to present us with some durians." 

This was duly interpreted to the Malay, who drew back, gazing 
keenly from the ensign to the middy, and back again, his dark 
eyes seeming to flash, as he said something in his native tongue 
to the interpreter. 

" Duilah say you throw durian again in his face, and it make 
him mad." 

" No, no, old fellow, nothing of the kind," said Bob, laying his 
hand on Abdullah's shoulder. " That's all past" 

The Malay judged his meaning from his looks, and not from 
his words. Then smiling, he leaped back into the boat, and 
returned laden with the iinest fruit he had, which he offered to 
the young officers with no little grace and dignity, smiling 
pleasantly the while, but manifesting nothing little or servile. 

The ladies looked on so wonderingly, that Bob had to leave 
the durians and explain, returning directly after, though, to the 
Malays, and obtaining a splendid bunch of the sweet flowers of 
the waringhan tree, which he carried back to the ladies, who 
smiled, thanked him, and took their departure. 

" I never saw such a fellow as you are, Roberts," said the 
ensign, sulkily, as Bob returned ; " you always seem to know 
what to say or do when ladies are present. I don't ! " 

" Native modesty, ability, and natural gifts, my dear fellow," 
said Bob ; ** and I'm precious glad they are gone, for I want to 
have a go at those durians." 

Abdullah had already opened one, which he presented to Bob, 
who took it and made a terrible onslaught ; and then, with a 
doubting look in his dark eyes, the Malay opened a second 
durian, hesitated, and then evidently mastering his pride, offered 
it to Tom Long. 




The latter drew back, shaking his head, and the Malay looked 
hurt and annoyed. 

"Tell him I don't like durians, Bob Roberts," said Tom, 
nervously, " or we shall have another row." 

** Here, hi ! old cockolorum ! " cried Bob, with his mouth full 
as he turned to the Malay, " tell Mr Abdullah there, that his 
durians are 'licious ¡ª luscious ¡ª 'licious, but Mr Long likes man- 
gosteens better." 

This was interpreted, and Abdullah's doubting look changed 
as he hurried back to the boat, and returned with a basket full 
of delicious fruit, which he offered Tom Long with a bow ; and 
then, finding they were accepted, he stood smiling with his head 
bent, while Bob went on devouring durian at a terrible rate. 

" I say, Tom Long," said Bob, making a very unpleasant noise 
with his mouth. 

"What is it?" said the ensign, who was deep in the mys- 
terious flavour of the delicious mangosteen. 

" I never believed in old Darwin, and his development, and 

evolution, and that sort of thing, till now." 

" Why now ? " said Tom Long. 

"Because I feel such a pig," said Bob, attacking another 
durian. " Look here, old man, if you'll put me up in a durian 
tree, I don't want anything else thaiikey ; you may have all the 
honour and glory. Oh ! 1 say, this one's lovely ! it's just like 
nectar made with custard, with an old shoe put in for flavour, 
and all stirred up with a paint brush. How are you getting on?" 

" Bravely," said Tom Long. 

The two young officers went on eating till they caught sight of 
the doctor in the distance ¡ª a sight 30 suggestive of making 
themselves ill that they gave up with a sigh or two, and went 
away, Tom Long offering to pay liberally for the fruit, notwith- 
standing a hint from his companion that he should be content to 
accept it as a present 

Both the Malays drew back very proudly, but Bob Roberts 
healed the breach in etiquette by quietly taking out his case, and 
offering a cigar to each of the Malays in turn. 

These were taken with a smile, and accompanied by a 
thoroughly friendly look at parting. 

" They're rum fellows, those Malays," said Bob, " and want a 
lot of managing. They are gentlemen at heart, and savages at 
body. That's my opinion of them." 

" And my opinion is," said Tom Long, " that they are a pre- 
cious unpleasant treacherous set of people, that it is downright 
cruelty to expect a gentleman to live amongst" 




Up to this point no Malay, not even a servant, had been ad- 
mitted to live upon the island, though the want of natives for 
assistance and to supply food had been keenly felt. 

During the last few days, however, the resident had begun to 
relax this stringent rule, and a fisherman had been permitted to 
set up his hut and keep his boats at the upper end of the island, 
with the consequence that in place of a very intermittent supply, 
there was plenty of fish at the mess table. 

Now as soon as the young ofllicers had gone, Abdullah and his 
Malay companion sought audience, basket in hand, of the 
resident, who, after talking to them for a time, walked down to 
the landing-place, saw their ample supply of fruit and flowers, and 
ended by granting them a site by the water's edge, where they 
might set up their hut, and secure their boat, the understanding 
upon which the grant was made being that an ample supply was 
to be kept up for the use of the officers and men. 

" Capital fellow, Linton," said the doctor, " Nothing like 
fruit in moderation to keep men in health. But isn't it risky to 
have these fellows on the isle ? " 

" I have thought of that," said Mr Linton; " but by bciog too 
exclusive we shall defeat our own ends. We must receive the 
principal part of the Malays in a friendly way, and it is only by a 
more open policy that this can be done. If we admit any wolves 
amongst the sheep they must meet with the wolves' fate. So far, 
I think I have done well." 

"Well, yes, perhaps you are right," said the doctor. But both 
gentlemen would have altered their opinions exceedingly if they 

had seen a long low boat, painted of a dark gray, and manned by six 
men, float gently down stream that night, and, unseen by the sen- 
tries, stopbeside the sampan of Abdullah and his Malay companion. 

Here there was a short consultation, Abdullah crawling over 
the gunwale into the long low boat, where he lay down, side by 
side with the man who steered. 

Their conversation was long, and the others in the boat lay 
down while it was going on, so that had the boat been seen by 
an unusually watchful sentry it would have appeared to be empty, 
and moored to a bamboo stake thrust into the mud. 

But the dark silent boat was not seen by the nearest sentry, 
either when it floated down, or when it was cautiously turned and 
paddled up stream once more, till, out of hearing, the oars went 
down with a noisy splash, and the long narrow vessel literally 
dashed through the river. 

The reason it was not seen was simple enough. 

Private Sim was on duty that night, and he had been once 
more fast asleep. 



CHAPTER XXIL 

THE CREW OF THE CAPTAIN's GIG. 

There was a good deal of the schoolboy left in the young repre- 
sentatives of Her Majesty's two services ; not that this is strange, 
for a good deal of his schoolboyhood clings to a man even in 
middle life. Bob Roberts had a tiff with Long, made vow after 
vow that he would never speak to the ensign again ; declaring 
him to be a consequential cocky scarlet pouter pigeon, with as 
much strut in him as a bantam. 

On the other hand, Tom Long declared the middy to be a 
niost offensive little rascal, with impertinence enough in him for 
a dozen men. He was determined to cut him dead ¡ª that he 
was, and he would have no more to do with him. 

Result the very next day : 

Bob Roberts hurried down into the captain's gig, sitting there 

very eager and excited ; for they were going to the island, and 
he had a plan in his head. 

The captain came to the side and down the ladder, the gig 
was pushed off, the crew's oars fell into the bright river with one 
splash, and as they did so Bob Roberts forgot all the respect due 
to his commander, by suddenly catching him by the arm. 

" Look, look, sir. See that ? " 

"No, Mr Roberts," said the captain rather sternly, "but I 
felt it." 

" I beg your pardon, sir," said Bob, saluting. " It was a great 
crocodile, and the splash of the men's oars frightened it." 

" Oh, indeed," said the captain dryly ; and he took out a 
despatch and began to read. 

Dick, who was coxswain of the gig, screwed up his mahogany 
visage, and Bob pretended to look terribly alarmed, and so the 
boat was rowed over the sparkling waters to the bamboo land- 
ing stage, when the captain got out, and Bob was left in charge 

of the boat. 





Bob jumped up as soon as the captain had entered the resi- 
dency, and began to fidget about. 

'*I wish I knew how long the skipper would be, Dick," he 
said. "I want to go ashore. No, I don't," he said, correcting 
himself. " I got in a row once for that. But look here, Dick, 
suppose you go and find Mr Long." 

"All right, sir," said Dick, with alacrity. " 1*11 go." 

" Oh no, you don't," cried Bob, recollecting himself again ; 
" that fly won't take the same cock salmon twice, Master Dick." 

" I don't understand you, sir," growled Dick, rubbing his ear. 

**0h no, I suppose not," said Bob. "You didn't go ashore 
for me once with a message, and then get up to the canteen and 
forgot to come back again, did you?" 

" Lor', now you mention it, sir, so I did," said DicL " It was 
that day as I met Sergeant Lund, and he says, * Why, Dick, old 
man,' he says, ' you look as dry and thirsty,' he says, * as a fish. 
Come and have some lime juice and water;' and I did, and 
talking together about the ' Startler ' and her guns, and earth- 
works, made me quite forget how the time went by. But lor*, 
Mr Roberts, sir, what a memory you have to be sure." 

** Yes," said Bob, sticking his cap on one side, and cocking 
his eye knowingly at the old salt; "a fellow just needs to have 
a good memory. I say, Dick, that lime juice and water was 
precious strong that day, wasn't it?" 

" No, sir, not a bit," said the old sailor, stolidly. " But now I 
come to recollect, the sun did make me awful giddy." 

"All right, Dick," said the midshipman; "run the boat a 
little more under the shade of those trees, and we'll keep you 
out of the sun to-day." 

Old Dick growled, and picked up the boat-hook to draw the 
gig further along to where there was a dense cool shade. Then 
as he laid the boat-hook down and retook his place, he began 
to chuckle. 

" You're a sharp 'un, Mr Roberts, that you are," he said, 
laughing. ** Well, I'll own it ; that was a bit of a slip that day. 
Send one o' the tothcrs ashore then with your message." 

"No, I'll be blessed if I do," said Bob. "I'll never give way 
an inch again about a boat's crew ; I haven't forgotten that little 
game at Aden, where I sent one chap ashore to get me some 
cold water to drink, and he didn't come back; and another 
volunteered to go and fetch him, and I let him go, and he didn't 
come back ; and then I had to send another, and another ¡ª eight 
of 'em, every one vowing he'd bring the rest back ; and at last I 
sat alone in that boat without a crew, and the first lieutenant 





came, and a nice wigging I had. No, Master Dick, IVe been 
at sea too long now to be tricked by those games, and I mean 
to have the strictest discipline whenever I'm in command." 

The men in the forepart of the boat overheard all this, and 
began to look very gloomy. 

" Couldn't you let one on us go and get a bucket o' water, 
sir ? it's precious hot," said the man who pulled bow oar, and he 
touched his forelock. 

** No, Mr Joe Cripps, I couldn't," said Bob, sharply ; " but I 
tell you what you all may do ; put your heads over the side, and 
drink as much of this clear river water as you like. We're not 
at sea, man." 

" More we aren't, sir," said the man, glancing round at his 
companions, who laughed. 

" Look here," said Bob, " Dick will keep an eye on the shore, 
and I'll tell the sentry there to pass the word. You may all 
smoke if you like, only look smart, and put away your pipes if 
the captain's coming." 

" Thanky, sir," chorussed the men, and pipes were quickly 
produced by all save Dick, who helped himself to a fresh quid. 

" I say, sentry," cried Bob, " pass the word on there ¡ª I want 
to see Mr Long." 

" Yes, sir," was the reply, and the white-coated sentry walked 
to the end of his beat, and made a sign to the next sentry, who 
came to the end of his beat, heard what was wanted, and passed 
the message on, so that at the end of a few minutes Ensign 
Long came slowly down to the landing-place, with an umbrella 

held up to keep off the sun, and found the boat's crew smok- 
ing, and Bob Roberts, with his cap tilted over his eyes, sitting in 
the bottom of the gig, with his legs over the side, so exactly 
arranged that the water rippled round the soles of his shoes, and 
pleasantly cooled his feet. 

"Did you wish to speak to me, Mr Roberts?" said Long, 
stiffly. 

** Hallo, Tom, old man ! Here, jump in ! IVe got some news 
for you." 

Ensign Long looked very stand-offish ; but the eager face of 
Bob, the only one about his own age of whom he could make a 
companion, was too much for him \ and as Bob got up and made 
a place for him, Mr Ensign Long unbent a little, and really as 
well as metaphorically undid a button or two, and got into the 
captain's gig, 

" I say, look here, Tom, old man, what's the use ot us two 
always falling out, when we could be so jolly together?" said Bob. 





" I don't quite understand you," said Tom Long, stiffly. " I 
am not of a quarrelsome disposition, as any of my brother officers 
will tell you." 

" Then it must be me then who is such a quarrelsome beast, 

and there's my hand, and we won't fall out any more." 

Ensign Long undid a few more buttons, for it was very hot, 
and condescended to shake hands. 

" I'm sure it's not my wish to be bad friends," said Ensign 
Long. " I think the members of the two services ought to be 
like brothers." 

" So do I," said Bob. " I say, sentry, keep a sharp look-out 
for the captain, and I'll stand a glass for you at the canteen next 
time I come ashore." 

" Yes, sir," said the sentry. " But p'raps, sir, I mayn't see you 
next time you come ashore." 

"There's an artful one for you, Tom," cried Bob, getting his 
hot wet hand into his pocket with no little difficulty, and throw- 
ing the man a fourpenny piece. "Now, look here, Tom," he 
continued, as the man cleverly caught the tiny piece and thrust 
it in his pocket, Ensign Long carefully closing his ear and look- 
ing in the other direction the while, **you and I might have no 
end of games if we could only keep friends." 

" Well, let s keep friends, then," said Tom Long. 

" Agreed," said Bob, " and the first one of us who turns dis- 
agreeable, the other is to punch his head." 

" No, I can't agree to that," said Tom, thoughtfully, " because 
we could not settle who was in the wrong." 

" Then we'd punch one anotlaer's heads," said Bob : " but never 
mind about that Look here." 

Ensign Long undid a few more buttons, of which he had a 
great many down the front of his mess waistcoat, just like a row 
of gold-coated pills, and then he proceeded to look there, that is 
to say mentally, at what his companion had to say, 

" Do you know that young Malay chap, who came on board 
yesterday with his father, the Bangthegong, or Tumongong, or 
whatever he calls himself ? " 

" Yes, I saw him ; he came afterwards to the fort, and was 
shown round." 

" Didn't you speak to him ? " 

" Not I. Don't care much for these niggers." 
"Oh ! but he's no end of a good chap," said Bob. " He can't 
help being browa I took him down to the gunroom, and we 
smoked and talked ; he can speak English like fun." 
" Indeed ! " 





" Yes, indeed ; and I tell you what it is, he's worth knowing. 
He's quite a prince, and as jolly as can be. He says there^s out- 
and-out shooting in the jungle, and if we'll go ashore and have a 
turn with him, he'll take us where we can have a regular good day." 

"What does the young savage shoot with," said Long, dis- 
dainfully, " a bow and arrow ? " 

" Bow and arrow be hanged I Why, don't I tell you he is quite 
a prince? and he's regularly English in his ways. Some one 
made him a present of a Purdey breechloader, and he uses Eley 
cartridges. What do you think of that ? " 

" Very disgusting that men should take to such adjuncts to 
civilization before they leave oiF wearing those savage plaid 
petticoats." 

** I believe they are a tribe of Scotsmen, who came out here 
in the year one and turned brown," said Bob, laughing, " Those 
sarongs are just like kilts," 

" Yes," said Tom Long, "and the krises are just the same as 
dirks." 

" Well, bother all that ! " cried Bob. " I told him we'd both 
come to-morrow, and bring guns, and he's going to get some 
prog, and half-a-dozen beaters ; and we'll have a jolly day," 

" But," said Tom Long, dropping his official ways, and speak- 
ing excitedly, " he didn't ask me ! " 

*'He said he'd be delighted to know you. He likes English- 
men." 

** But we can't get leave." 

" Can't we ? " cried Bob, " I can. If the skipper says no, I 
think I can work him round ; and I'm sure you can manage it. 
Look here, you ask Doctor Bolter to manage it for you, and 
say we'll bring him all the specimens we can shoot." 

"By Jove, Bob, what a jolly idea!" cried Tom Long ¡ª an officer 
no longer, but a regular boy again. " We'll get leave to-night, 
and start early." 

? That we will" 

" But are you sure that young Tumongong would be glad to 

see me too ? " 

" Ali Latee, his name is, and I've got to call him Al already, 

and he called me Bob, Glad ? of course he will I said you'd 

come too ; and I told such a whopper, Tom." 
? What did you say ? " 
" I told him you were my dearest friend" 
" Well, so I am, Bob ; only you will get so restive," 
" Yes, I always was a restive little beggar," said Bob. " To- 

monow morning then, and¡ª " 




*' Captain coming, sir." 

" Landing-place at daybreak, Tom. Cut," whispered Bob ; 
and the young ensign rose and leaped ashore, buttoning up his 
little golden-pill buttons, as Captain Horton came down the 
path, and answered his salute with a friendly nod. 

The next minute the water was flashing like fiery silver 
from the blades of the oars, and the gig returned to the steamer's 
side, where Bob began to prepare for the next day's trip, taking 
it for granted that he could get leave. 



CHAPTER XXII I. 



HOW BOB ROBERTS AND TOM LONG ASKED FOR LEAVE. 

Very great things come from very small germs, and for a long 
time afterwards Captain Horton bitterly regretted that he had 

been in so easy and amiable a frame of mind that he had 
accorded Bob Roberts the holiday he desired. 

He had dined well, and was in that happy state of content 
that comes upon a man who is not old, and whose digestion 
is good. 

It was a glorious night, and the captain was seated on deck at 
a little table bearing a shaded lamp and his cup of coffee, when 
Bob respectfully approached, cap in hand. 

" If you please, sir ¡ª " 

" Who's that ? Oh I Roberts. Here ; go down to the cabin, 
Roberts, and fetch my cap, I don't want to catch cold." 

"Yes, sir." 

' Hi ! stop, my boy 1 Here ; lend me your cap till you come 
back.'' 

It was a very undignified proceeding, but Captain Horton 
had a horror of colds in the head, and would far rather have 
been undignified than catch one. So he took the little, natty 
gold-laced cap held out to him, and stuck it upon his pate. 

" Bless my soul I" he exclaimed. " What a stupid little head 
you've got, Roberts." 

" Yes, sir," said tlie lad sharply, " very ; but it will grow, sir." 

" Then I hope it won't grow more stupid, boy. There, be 
quick ! " 

Bob ran down to the captain's cabin, and obtained the required 
piece of headgear, with which he returned to the quarter-deck, 
where the captain was sipping his coffee, apparently oblivious 
of the fact that he had sent for his cap. 

" Eh ? " 

" Your cap, sir." 

" Oh, ah I to be sure ! yes, of course. Thank you, Roberts. 




Exchange is no robbery, as we used to say at Harrow. You 
needn't wait." 

" Thank you, sir ; no, sir, but ¡ª " 

"Now what is it, Roberts? You know I don't like to be 
troubled after dinner." 

"Yes, sir; but I beg your pardon, sir. Might I have leave 
to go ashore to-morrow ? " 

" Yes ¡ª no. What, in the name of goodness, do you mean, 
Mr Roberts, by coming and asking me? Go to the first 
lieutenant," 

" Please, sir, I'm very sorry to trouble you, but he's dining at 
the residency." 

" Then why didn't you wait till he came back ? " 

" Because, sir, please sir, Mr Wilson's always cross when he 
has been out to dine. He's not like you, sir." 

The captain started up in his chair, and gazed full in the 
lad's face. 

" You're a nice boy, Roberts," he said ; " but don't you try any 
of that impudent flattery on with me again." 

" No, sir. I beg pardon, sir, but may I go ? " 

" Wait till the first lieutenant comes back, sir, and ask him." 

" But please, sir, it's important." 

"What is?" 

" That I should have leave to-morrow, sir." 

" Where are you going, then? " 

" Please, sir, I was going shooting." 

"Ohl" said his captain, laughing; "then that's what you 
call important, eh ? Well, I don't know what to say. Have there 
been any complaints against you lately ? " 

" Two or three, sir," said Bob ; " but I have been trying very 
hard, sir," he added earnestly, " to do my duty." 

"Humph!" said the captain. "Well, I was a youngster 

myself once. I suppose you'd be very much disappointed if 1 
said no ? " 

" Yes, sir ; very much." 

" Humph ! Who's going with you ? " 

" Ensign Long, sir, if he can get leave." 

" Well, Roberts, you can go ; but be careful with your guns. 
And look here, don't do anything to annoy the Malays, Don't 
go near their religious places, or get trespassing." 

** No, sir, I'll be very careful." 

" Any one else going ? " 

Ali Latee, sir, the Tumongong's son," 

"Very well. Be off!" 




" Yes, sir, thank you, sir," cried Bob joyously, and he hurried 

away. 

Ensign Long felt perfectly sure that if he went direct to the 
major, and asked for leave to go ashore shooting, it would be 
refused. He would have gone and asked Captain Smithers to 
intercede for him, but the captain was always short, and ready 
to be annoyed at nearly everything said ; so he concluded that 
Bob Roberts' idea was the best, and he went straight to Doctor 
Bolter, who was in his room, in his shirt and trousers, both his 
sleeves rolled up, busily pinning out some gorgeous butterflies 
that he had secured. 

** Ah, Long ! " he said, as the youth entered ; " how are you ? 
Just hand me that sheet of cork." 

" Quite well, sir, thank you." 

" Oh I are you ? I'll look at your tongue directly. Hand me 
one of those long, thin pins." 

The pin was handed. 

" Now put a finger on that piece of card Gently, my dear 
boy, gently ; the down upon these things is so exquisitely fine 
that the least touch spoils them. Look at that Atlas moth by 
your elbow. Isn't it lovely ? " 

" Magnificent, sir," said Long, taking up a shallow tray, and 
really admiring the monstrous moth pinned out therein, 

" Ah, my lad ! I wish I could see you turning a little atten- 
tion to natural history, now we are in this perfect paradise for a 
collector. How much better for you than lounging about all day 
under the trees. Now then, put out your tongue." 

" But I'm quite well. Doctor Bolter." 

" Put ¡ª out ¡ª ^your ¡ª tongue ¡ª sir. Confound it all, sir, I've no 
time to waste \ " 

As he spoke he took up the lamp, and held it close to Tom 
Long's face, so that the light might fall upon the protruded organ. 

" Hah I " ejaculated Doctor Bolter, resuming his seat. 

" But I really am quite well, sir," remonstrated Tom Long. 

" Don't tell me, sir, that you are quite well Do you think I 
don't know when a man's well, and when he is not ? You are 
just a little wee bit feverish." 

He felt the youth's pulse, and nodded his head sagely. 

" Too much idleness and good living is what is the matter with 
you, sir. Why don't you collect ? " 

" How can I, sir," said Tom, " when I'm shut up in this island?" 

" Go ashore. Here, I'll give you some collecting boxes, and 
lend you a vasculum acd * tiet. Go and get me some butter- 
flies." 





"Well, sir, if it's all the same to you," said Tom, taking ad- 
vantage of the wind blowing in the right direction, ** shooting's 
more in my way. Suppose I shot you some birds ? " 

" Better still," said the doctor, enthusiastically. " Nothing I 
should like better, I want a few trogons, and the blue-billed 
gaper. Then you might get me the green chatterer, and any new 
birds you could see." 

''Yqs, sir." 

" And look here, Long ; the woods here are the chosen resort 
of the great argus pheasant. I don't suppose you would be able 
to come across one, but if you do ¡ª " 

" Down him," said Tom Long. 

"Exactly," said the doctor, "There, my lad, I won't give 
you any medicine, but prescribe a little short exercise," 

" Thank you, sir," said Tom, trying hard to restrain his eager- 
ness. " Might I have a run to-morrow ? I have felt very languid 
to-day." 

"To be sure. I'll see the major and get leave of absence for 
you. Be careful, though. Don't overheat yourselfi and mind and 
not get into any scrape with the Malays." 

" I'll mind, sir," said Tom. 

" That's riglit. Be very careful not to spoil the plumage of the 
birds. You can make a Malay boy carry them tied by the beaks 
to a stick. Stop a minute ; as you are here, you may as well cut 
up these cards for me in thin strips. I'll go and ask the major 
the while." 

Tom set to work at the cards with a pair of scissors, and the 
doctor donned his undress coat, went out, and returned with the 
requisite permission. 

'* By the way, look here, Long ; if you'll promise to be very 
careful, I'll lend you my double gun." 

" I'll take the greatest care of it, sir," was the reply. 

" Good 1 There it is ; so now be off; and to-morrow night I 
shall expect a nice lot of specimens to skin." 

So Tom Long went off with the gun, and the doctor helped to 
turn the residency into an abode where danger usurped the 
place of safety, and peace was to be succeeded by the horrors 
of war. 



CHAPTER XXIV. 

A JAUNT IN THE JUNGLE, WITH AN AWKWARD END. 

Tom Long rather overslept himself, but it was pretty early when 
he started from his quarters, to encounter Captain Smithers soon 
after, looking anxious and annoyed. He nodded shortly, and 
the young ensign went on through what was (juite a wilderness 
of beauty, to meet, next, Rachel Linton and Mary Sinclair, who 
had been flower-gathering, and who stopped for a few minutes' 
conversation with him, the former nearly spoiling the expedition 
by turning the foolish youth's thoughts in quite a contrary direc- 
tion from collecting or shooting. 

But Rachel Linton quietly wished him success, and Tom went 
off, telling himself that it would look foolish if he did not go. 

He had not far to go to the landing-place now ; but in the 
little space close by the resident's garden he encountered Private 
Gray, who saluted him, and sent Tom on thinking that he wished 
he was as old, and good-looking, and as manly, as the young 
soldier he had just passed. And then he felt very miserable and 
dejected, and wished he was anything but what he was, until he 
saw Bob Roberts, sitting in the " Startler's " dingy by the land- 
ing-place, and forgot all about everything but the shooting ex- 
cursion. 

" Come along I You are a chap," shouted Bob. " I've been 
waiting over half an hour." 

" Met the ladies," said Tom, ** and was obliged to speak," 

" Oh, you met the ladies, did you ? " said Bob, looking at him 
suspiciously. " Weil, never mind ; jump aboard. Got plenty 
of cartridges ? " 

" Yes, heaps ; and some food too." 

" So have I," cried Bob. " Now, then, pull away, Dick. Set 
us ashore under those trees. Hooray, Tom ; look ! There's 
young Banggong there, waiting with a couple of niggers." 

Dick pulled steadily at the sculls, and the little dingy breasted 
the water like a duck, soon crossing the intervening space, when 





the two lads landed with their ammunition and stores, shook 
hands with the handsome dark young chief who confronted 
them, and at once started off for the jungle, while Dick stood 
refilling his right cheek with tobacco, before rowing the dingy 
back to the steamer. 

" Ah ! " he said, as he once more took the sculls, " they never 
asked me to go, too. Now you see if by the time they get back 
to-night they hain't been in about as pretty a bit o' mischief as 
was ever hatched." 

Old Dick had no intention of setting himself up as a prophet 
of evil, for his remark was made more out of spite than anything 
else, it having struck the old fellow that a good idle ashore would 
be very pleasant, especially with plenty to eat and drink, and a 
fair supply of tobacco. 

" It wouldn't be very hard work to carry all the game they 
shoot," he said, chuckling; "and one might get a good nap 
under a shady tree." 

But Dick's hopes were blighted, and instead of shade under 
trees, he had to row back to where the " Startler " was blistering 
in th^ hot sunshine, and take his part in the regular duties of 
the day. 

Meanwhile the two lads with their companion were striding 
along beneath the shade of the trees, with the naval and military 
services of her most gracious Majesty completely forgotten, and 
their elastic young minds bent entirely upon the expedition. 
They looked flushed and eager, and the Tumongong's son, Ali, 
was just as full of excitement. 

The latter was about the age of the young English officers, and 
their coming was to him delightful. For his father was wise 
enough to foresee the course of events ¡ª how the old barbarism 
of the Malay was dying out, to give place to the busy civilization 
taught by the white men from the west ; and he felt sure that 
the most civilized and advanced of the young chieftains would 
occupy the best positions in the future. Hence then he had 
sent his son for long spells at a time to Singapore and Penang, 
to mingle with the English, and pick up such education as he 
could obtain. 

Ali being a clever boy, had exceeded his father's expectations, 
having arrived at the age of eighteen, with a good knowledge of 
English, in which tongue he could write and converse ; and in 
addition he had imbibed a sufficiency of our manners and cus- 
toms to make him pass muster very well amongst a party of 
gentlemen. 

Bob Roberts and he were sworn friends directly, for there was 





something in their dispositions which made them assimilate, Ali 
being full of life and fun, which, since his return to Parang, he 
had been obliged to suppress, and take up the stiff stately 
formality of the Malays about him, of whom many of the chiefs 
looked unfavourably at the youth who had so quickly taken up 
and made friends with the people they looked upon as so many 
usurpers. 

No sooner were the three lads out ofsightoftheattap-thatched 
roofs and the island, the fort and steamer, than all formality was 
thrown to the winds, and they tramped on chattering away like 
children, Tom, however, walked on rather stiffly for a few 
minutes, but the sight of a good broad rivulet was too much for 
him ; drill, discipline, the strict deportment of an officer and a 
gentleman, whose scarlet and undress uniforms had cost a great 
deal of money, and in which, to tell the truth, he had been very 
fond of attiring himself when alone with his looking-glass, all were 
fbrgotten, and the bottled-up schoolboy vitality that was in his 
breast seethed up like so much old-fashioned ginger beer. 

" Follow my leader ! " he cried, handing his gun to one of the 

Malays, whose eyes rolled with pleasure as he saw sentimental 

Tom Long take a sharp run, leap well from the near bank, and 

land on the other side of the stream, but he had to catch at some 

bamboos to save himself from falling back into the water. 

" With a cheerly hi ho," shouted Bob Roberts, dropping his 
gun on a bush. "Look out, soldier." 

The words were on his lips as he ran, and in his leap alighted 
on the other side in so bad a place that he had to catch at Tom 
to save himself from falling, and for a it'iv seconds there was a 
sharp scuffle amongst the bamboos before they were safe. 

" Look out, Ali," shouted Bob, on seeing their companion 
coming; "it's bad landing." 

But Ali was already in full career ; as light and active of foot 
as a deer, he made a quick rush and a leap, and landed in safety 
quite a yard beyond the young officers. 

" Well done ! hooray ! " cried Bob, who had not the slightest 
objection to seeing himself surpassed ; while the two Malays in 
charge of the guns and impediments on the other side stared at 
each other in astonishment, and in a whisper asked if the young 
chief had gone out of his mind. 

"Now then, Sambo ¡ª Jumbo," cried Bob, "over with those 
guns. Come along, they are not loaded." 

The two Malays stared, and Ali said a few words to them in 
their native tongue, when they immediately gathered up the 
g&ns, and, being bare-legged, waded across the stream, which 
was about four yards wide. 




The last man came over with a rush as he neared the bank, 
for suddenly from a reed-bed above them there was a wallow 
and a flounder with a tremendous disturbance in the water, as 
something shot down towards the main stream. 

" A crocodile," said Ali, as the young Englishmen directed at 
him a wondering gaze. 

" Crocodile ! " cried Bob, snatching his gun from the atten- 
dant, and hastily thrusting in cartridges, after which he ran 
along the stream till checked by the tangled growth. 

*' No good," said Ali, laughing at his eagerness. "Gone.** 

The reptile was gone sure enough, and it was doubtful which 
was the more frightened, it or the Malays; so they went on 
along a narrow jungle path, that was walled up on either side by 
dense vegetation, which seemed to have been kept hacked back 
by the heavy knives of the working Malays. To have gone oflp 
to right or left would have been impossible, so tangled and 
matted with canes and creepers was the undergrowth, Bob wak- 
ing up to the fact that here was the natural home of the cane so 
familiar to schoolboys ; the unfamiliar part being, that keeping 
to nearly the same diameter, these canes ran one, two, and even 
three hundred feet in length, creeping, climbing, undulating, now 
running up the side of some pillar-like tree to a convenient 
branch, over which it passed to hang down again in a loop till 
it reached some other tree, in and out of whose branches it 
would wind. 

As they went on farther they were in a soft green twilight with 
at rare intervals the sharp bright rays of the sun, like golden 
arrows, darting through the dense shade, and a patch of luxuriantly 
growing pitcher-plants or orchids, more beautiful than any that 
had previously met their eyes. 

" Mind the elephant holes !" cried Ali, who was behind 

"All right," said Tom Long, who was leading the way. " Oh, 
my gracious ! " 

There was a loud splash and a wallowing noise, followed by a 
loud suck as of some one pulling a leg out of thick mud ; and 
this proved to be the case, for on Bob running forward, and 
turning a corner of the winding path, there was Tom, just extri- 
cating himself from an elephant hole. 

For they were in a land where wheeled carriages were almost 
unknown, all portage being done either by boats on the many 
streams, or on the backs of elephants and buffaloes, by the former 
of whom the few jungle paths were terribly cut up, partly by the 
creatures' weight, but more particularly from the fact that, no 
matter how many passed along a track, or how wet and swampy 



it might be, the sagacious creatures believed in the way being safe 
where any of their kind had been before, and invariably placed 
their great round feet in the same holes ; the effect being that 
these elephant holes were often three or four feet deep, and half 
full of mud and water. 

The two Malays were called into requisition, and by means ot 
green leaves removed a good deal of the mud, but the mishap 
did not add much to the lad's comfort. However, he took it in 
very good part, and they went on for some distance, to where a 
side track, that was apparently but little used, turned off to the left, 
and the Malays, drawing their heavy knives, went first to clear 
away some of the twining creepers that hung from side to side. 

So beautiful was the jungle that for a time the two English 
lads forgot all about their guns, as they stopped hard by some 
watercourse to admire the graceful lace-fronded fern or the 
wonderful displays of moss hanging from the more ancient trees. 

But at last the weight of their guns reminded them that they 
had come to shoot, and they drew Ali's attention to the fact. 

" Wait a little," he said, smiling. " We shall soon be in a 
clearer part. You can't shoot here." 

As he said ¡ª so it proved, for after another half-hour's walking, 
during which they had become bathed in perspiration from the 
moist heat, there was less tangled growth, and the magnificent 
trees grew more distant one from the other. They were of kinds 
quite unknown to the little party, who, though seeking birds, 
could not help admiring the vast monarchs of the primeval 
forest. 

'* This looks more hopeful," cried Bob, who so far had only 
heard the occasional note of a bird which was invisible. Now 
he saw one or two flit across the sunny glade in advance. 

" Yes, there are birds here ; but take care, there are serpents 
too." 

Tom Long winced a little at this last announcement, for he had 

a horror of the twining creatures ; and as his memory ran back 
to the narrow escape of Adam Gray, from the sea snake, he asked 
with some little trepidation, ¡ª 

" Poisonous ? " 

" Oh, yes, some of them ! But you need not be alarmed, they 
hurry off as soon as they hear our steps." 

" But," said Tom, to Bob's very great delight, for he could see 
his companion's alarm, "how about the boa constrictors ?" 

*' Pythons your people call them," said AH. "Yes, there are 
plenty of them in the wet places." 

" Danererous ? " 





" No," said All, " I never knew them to be ¡ª only to the little 

pigs." 

" But am't they very large ? " 

" Oh, yes," was the reply, " big as my leg, and so long," 

He made a mark on the soft earth with one foot, and then took 
seven paces, where he made a fresh mark, indicating a length of 
about eighteen feet. 

"But they attack men sometimes, don't they?" said Tom, 
importantly. 

" No, I never knew of such a thing," said AIL " They steal 
the chickens, and swallow them whole." 

Tom felt somewhat reassured, but all the same he walked 
delicately over the thick herbage and amongst the scrub, not 
knowing but that he might plant his foot at any time upon some 
writhing creature, whose venomous fangs would be inserted in 
his leg before he could leap aside ; but no such accident befell 
him, neither had one of the party had a single shot, when Bob 
declared that he was too hungry to go farther, and going on 
alone to where a huge prostrate tree stretched its great trunk for 
many yards, he was about to sit down, when he stopped short, 
held out one hand to indicate silence, and beckoned with the 
other. 

Ali ran softly up, and on seeing at what his friend pointed, he 
signalled to one of the Malays to come. 

The man came up without a sound, caught sight oi' Bob's dis- 
covery ¡ª a black snake about five feet long, and going gently up, 
he to the lad's horror suddenly seized it by the tail, and with 
a rapid snatch drew the reptile through the left hand up to the 
neck, which the Malay grasped tightly, while the reptile writhed, 
hissed, and angrily twined itself round the man's bare brown 
arm. 

** It isn't poisonous, then ? " said Tom Long, coolly. 

" Yes," replied Ali ; "it is a cobra, one of our most dangerous 
snakes." 

The Malay held it close for the lads to examine, which, after 
learning its deadly character, they were not particularly eager to 
do ; but the native laughed, and seemed to think very little of 
the danger, ending by placing the reptile's neck upon the fallen 
tree, and decapitating it with one clean cut of the knife. 

A halt was made here, and a hearty lunch was disposed o^ 
after which, feeling rested and comparatively cool, they started 
once more, and before long the first shot was had at a blue- 
billed gaper, a lovely bird, with azure and golden bill, and jetty 
black, white, and crimson plumage. 





" One for the doctor ! " exclaimed Tom Long ; and the beauti- 
ful bird was safely stowed away. 

Ali next brought down a paroquet, with long delicate tail, and 
delicious sunset hues blushing upon its plumage oi pearly grey 
green. 

Bob followed, with a shot at a green chatterer, a lovely little 
bird, all rich green and black, with a handsome crest. 

Next followed sundry misses, and then with varying fortune 
they secured a dozen really beautifuUy-plumaged birds for the 
doctor. 

"And now," exclaimed Bob, "I think we ought to get some- 
thing for the pot" 

" For the pot ? " said Ali, looking puzzled, foi anything verging 
on sporting slang was to him as so much Greek. 

" I mean for cooking and eating." 

Ali laughed, and said something to his followers, who led the 
way on to a more densely wooded part nearer the river, whose 
proximity was indicated by the change in the character of the 
vegetation. 

" Stop a minute, though," exclaimed Tom Long. " I can't 
stand this any more. Here's something been biting me ever 

ab ! " 

He made a halt, and began to examine his ancles and legs, 
" Why, look here ? " he cried ; " I'm bleeding like fun 1 " 
Like fun or no, he was certainly bleeding freely, and the cause 
was not far to seek. In fact, as he turned up the legs of his 
trousers four bloated little leeches, satiated with their horrid 
repast, dropped ofif his skin, and he caught a couple more feast- 
ing upon him right royally. 

" You should have tied your trousers round your ancles, and 
put on your boots outside them," said Ali ; " but it won't hurt 
you." 

" Won't hurt ! " exclaimed Tom Long, indignantly ; " but it 
does hurt. Why, I'm bleeding horribly." 

At a stream close by, however, his wounds were bathed, the 
bleeding checked, and then a few shots were had at the jungle 
fowl, two brace of which, a little bigger than ordinary bantams, 
were secured before the little party halted in a clearing close to 
the river. 

Here were half a-dozen native houses, one and all built upon 
bamboo piles, so as to raise the dwellers well above the damp 
ground, the possibility of flood, and out of tlie reach of any wild 
creatures that might be wandering by night 

There was something exceedingly homelike in the appearance 





of the places, each with its scrap of garden and fruit trees ; while 

the occupant of the principal hut insisted upon the whole party 

coming to partake of rest and refreshment before continuing 
their way, 

" Oh ! we don't want to go in," said Tom Long, peevishly. 

"Well, no, I don't want to go in," said Bob, ** but the old 
fellow will be offended if we do not ; and we want to make friends, 
not enemies." 

Ali nodded, and they sat down in the bamboo-floored hut, 
through whose open door they saw their host busy sending a 
Malay boy up one of his cocoa-nut trees, the boy rapidly ascend- 
ing the lofty palm by means of nicks already cut in the tree for 
the purpose. 

Three great nuts, in their husk-like envelopes, fell directly with 
a thud, and these the friendly Malay opened and placed before 
his visitors. 

" This is very different to the cocoa-nut we boys used to buy at 
school," said Bob, as he revelled in the delicious sub-acid cream 
of the nut, and then partook of rice, with a kind of sugary con- 
fection which was very popular amongst the people. 

Homely as the outside of the huts had appeared, both the 
lads could not help noticing how similar the habits of these simple 
Malays in this out-of-the-way part of the world were to those of 
people at home. 

For instance, beneath the eaves hung a couple of cages, neatly 
made of bamboo, in one of which was a pair of the little love- 
bird paroquets side by side upon a perch ; and in the other a 
minah, a starling-like bird, that kept leaping from perch to perch, 
and repeating with a very clear enunciation several Malay words. 

Thoroughly rested at last, the little party set off again ¡ª their 
host refusing all compensation, and once more they plunged into 
the thickest of the jungle, though very little success attended 
their guns. 

This was hardly noticed, though, for there was always some- 
iiing fresh to see ¡ª huge butterflies of wondrous colours flitting 
through the more open glades, strange vegetable forms, beauti- 
fully graceful bamboos, clustering in the moister parts, where 
some stream ran unseen amidst the dense undergrowth, while at 
last they reached a river of such surpassing beauty, with its over- 
hanging ferns, in the deep ravine in which it ran, that both the 
strangers paused to admire, while the IMalays looked on with 
good-humoured wonder at their enthusiasm. 

But very little of the sluggish stream was seen for the dense 
emerald growth, and the water itself was more like a chain of 





pools, which seemed to be likely haunts of fish ; and forgetting 
heat and weariness, both the young Englishmen began to divide 
the reeds and long grass and ferns with the barrels of their guns, 
so as to peer down into the water. 

Ali, evidently to please them, displayed quite as much interest 
as they ; while the two Malays squatted down, and taking out 
sirih leaves, spread upon them a little lime paste from a box, 
rolled in them a scrap of betel-nut, and began to indulge in a 
quiet chew. 

The lads were only a few yards apart, and Bob Roberts 
cautiously approached a deep still pool, when he heard upon his 
right a splash and a rush, accompanied by a wild cry for aid. 

For the moment he was paralyzed by the strange horror of the 
cry ; but recovering himself, he rushed through the long reeds 
and ferns, to look upon a sight which, for the time, almost 
robbed him of the power to act 



CHAPTER XXV. 



HOW BOB AND TOM BAGGED STRANGE GAME. 

The young midshipman saw at a glance what had happened, 
and the sight of the deadly struggle going on roused him from 
the stupor that had assailed him. 

It was evident that Ali had been holding by one hand to the 
branch of a tree, and was leaning over just such a pool as that 
which had caught the attention of Bob, when a crocodile, taking 
advantage of his unguarded approach, had seized him by the leg 
just above the knee. 

Ali had at once dropped his gun, seized the branch with the 
other hand, and clung for life as he uttered the cry for help, 
while the reptile tugged viciously, and shook him violently, to 
make him loose his hold. 

Had the creature succeeded, the young Malay chiefs fate 
had been sealed, for in another moment he would have been 
drawn down into the deep pool, with a few bubbles ascending 
through the agitated water to show where he lay. 

The time seemed long to the brave young fellow as he held 
on for dear life ; and it seemed long to Bob Roberts before he 
could act ; but it was but a matter of moments before he had 
reached Ali's side, with his gun cocked ; and placing the piece 
close to the reptile's eye as it glared savagely at him, and seemed 
about to leave one victim to seize another, he fired both barrels 
in rapid succession. 

There was a tremendous splash as the smoke hung before him 
for a few moments, then as it rose the young middy saw nothing 
but the troubled water before him, and Ali lying panting, and 
with his eyes starting, close by his side. 

By this time Tom Long and the two Malays had come up. 
eager with questions, to which Ali answered faintly, and gladly 
partook of a little spirits from the young ensign's flask. 

" I ought to have known better," he said, " but I did not 
think of the danger. It will be a warning for you both. These 
rivers swarm with the brutes." 




" But your leg ? " cried Bob, kneeling down. 

"A little torn; that's all," said the young Malay, stoically, 
"My sarong and the trousers have saved it, I think." 

All the same though it was bleeding freely, and with a rough 
kind of surgery Bob's handkerchief was used to bind it up. 

" I'm not much hurt," said Ali then ; and to prove his words 
he rose, limped a step or two forward, and picked up his gim, 
while Bob proceeded to slip a couple more cartridges in his own, 
gazing once more eagerly into the pool, but seeing nothing but 
a little blood-stained water. 

He turned sharply round, for something touched him, and 
there stood Ali, looking at him in a peculiar manner, and hold- 
ing out one hand, which Bob took, thinking the other felt faint. 

" I can't talk now," said Ali, hoarsely ; *' but you saved my 
life. I shall never forget it." 

*' Oh, nonsense, old fellow," cried Bob. " But, I say ; what 
a brute ! He must have been twenty feet long," 

" Oh, no," said Ali, smiling faintly, " not ten. The small ones 
are the most vicious and dangerous. Let us go.*' 

" But can you walk ? " said Bob. " Have a cigar." 

" Yes ; I will smoke," said the young Malay, as he walked 
bravely on, though evidently in pain ; and lighting a cigar, he 
talked in the most unconcerned way about the creature's sudden 
attack. 

" Such things are very common," he said. " Down by the 
big river they seize the women who go for water, and carry off 
the girls who bathe. There are monsters, ten, twenty, and 

twenty-five feet long ; but we are so used to them that it does 
not occur to us to take care." 

They were now walking over the ground they had that morn- 
ing traversed, Ali seeming so much at ease, and smiling so 
nonchalantly, that his companions ceased to trouble him with 
advice and proposals that he should be carried. 

At last they came to a spot where a fresh track turned off, 
and Ali paused. 

" You will not think me rude," he said, speaking with all the 
ease of a polished gentleman, " if I leave you here ? Ismael 
will take you the nearest way down to the island. Yusuf will go 
with me. My leg is bad." 

" Then let us carry you," cried Bob. " Here, we'll soon cut 
down some bamboos and make a frame." 

" No, no, it is not so bad as that," cried the young man, 
firmly ; " and I would rather walk. This is a nearer way, and 
vou will do as I ask, please." 




The two youths hesitated, but Ali was so firm, and his utter- 
ances so decided, that although unwillingly, they felt constrained 
to obey his wishes. 

'* No, no," exclaimed Bob, " let me go with you, old fellow. 
Let us both come." 

" Do you wish to serve me more than you have already done ?" 
said Ali, quietly. 

" YeS; I do, 'pon my word," replied Bob. 

" Then please say * good-bye.' I am very nearly at home.'* 

There was nothing more to be said, so the young Englishmen 
shook hands and parted from their companion, after he had 
promised to send word by Yusuf the next day how he was. 

*' I don't half feel satisfied," said Bob, trudging along behind 
the Malay who was their guide. " I think we ought to have 
gone with him, Tom." 

"I feel so too," was the reply, "but what could we do? 
Perhaps he was not so very much hurt after all." 

They were tired now, and the heat of the afternoon seemed 
greater than ever, so that they longed to get out of the stifling 
forest to the open banks of the river. But they were as yet far 
away, and their guide made a cut along the side of a patch of 
marshy ground, looking back from time to time to see if they 
followed. 

** Snipe, by all that's wonderful ! " cried Bob, firing two barrels 
almost as he spoke, and bringing down four birds out of a flock 
t?hat bore some resemblance to, but were double the size of, snipes. 

Tom raised his piece for a shot, but he was too late ; and 
Yusuf smiled and showed his teeth as he ran and picked up the 
birds, tied their legs together with some grass, and added them 
to the jungle-fowl he was carrying. 

" Well, they won't be able to laugh at us," said Bob, '* We 
shan't go back empty. Hallo ! what the dickens now ? " 

For a couple of scantily clad Malay girls, their sarongs torn 
and ragged with forcing their way through the bushes, came 
panting up, uttering loud cries, and flinging themselves down at 
the astonished youths' feet, clung to their legs, while Yusuf be- 
gan to abuse them angrily, and kicking one, was about to thrust 
away the other with his foot. 

" You leave them alone, will you ? " said Bob, giving him a 
rap on the head with his gun-barrel. "I wish to goodness I 
knew what was the Malay for cowardly b€ast, and you should 
have it, young fellow." 

The Malay's hand flew to his kris as he threw down the birds, 
and it flashed in the sunshine directly. 




" Ah ! would you bite ? " cried Bob, presenting his gun at 
the other's breast, when the man shrank away, with his eyes 
half dosed, and a peculiarly tigerish aspect about him as he drew 
his lips from his white teeth, but kept at a respectful distance, 
knowing as he did how ably the young sailor could use his 
gun. 

Just then the girls renewed their cries and lamentations, 
clinging wildly to the youths as if for protection, as half-a-dozen 
Malays, armed with krises and the long limbings, or spears, they 
can use with such deadly force, came running up, and made as 
if to seize upon the two girls. 

" Keep off, will you ! Confound your impudence, what do 
you mean ? " roared Bob, slewing round his gun to face the new 
comers. " I say, Tom, what fools we do seem not to be able to 
speak this stupid lingo ! What are they jabbering about ? " 

" Hang me, if I know," said Tom, whose face was flushed with 
heat and excitement. "All I can make out is that they want 
these two Malay ladies who have come to us to protect them." 

" Then, as my old nurse used to say, * want will be their 
master,' " said Bob, angrily ; " for they're not going to have them." 

The leader of the Malay party volubly said something to the 
two English, and then said some angry words to the two girls, 
who clung more tightly to their protectors, as he caught each by 
her shoulder. 

Bob brought the barrel of his gun down heavily on the Malay's 
head, in the same fashion as he had served Yusuf, who was now 
missing, having suddenly glided away. 

The Malay leaped back, tore out his kris, and made at his 
assailant; but the presented barrels of the two guns kept him back, 
as they did his companions, who had presented their limbings 
as their leader drew his kris, while now the girls leaped bravely 
up, and interposed their bodies between the two youths and the 
threatened danger. 

" That's very prettily done, my dears," said Bob ; ** but you 
are both of you horribly in the way if we should shoot, and it 
isn't the fashion in England. Place aux Messieurs in a case 
like this. There, you stand behind me." 

He gently placed the girl behind him, keeping his gun the 
while pointed at the Malays, and Tom Long followed his ex- 
ample. 

" Shall we shoot. Bob Roberts ? " said the ensign, hoarsely. 

" No," said Bob, whose voice sounded just as hoarse. " Not 
unless they try to do us miscliief. This is the time for a strate- 
gical retreat, as they are three to one, and we may at any time 





be cut off. I say, Tom, I feel in such a horrible state of squirm ; 
don't you?" 

" Never was so frightened in my life," replied Tom, " but 
pray don't show it." 

" Show it ? " replied Bob sharply ; " hang *era, no ; they should 
cut me to pieces first. But I say, old fellow, I never thought I 
was such a coward before." 

" More did I," replied Tom. " Suppose they understand what 
we're saying ! " 

" Not they ; no more than we can them. I say, I have it ! 
These are two slaves trying to escape, and these chaps want to 
get them back." 

" Then we'll take them right away to the fort," cried Tom. 
" Look out ! *' he added, as, after speaking to his followers, the 
chief Malay made another angry advance with the men, 

'^ Now look here, Mr Caf^-au-lait," said Bob, raising his gun 
this time to his shoulder, as he spoke aloud, " if you don*t sheer 
off, I'll let fly at you a regular broadside. Be ready, Tom," 

" Ready I " was the sharp reply, " when you say Fire." 

" Right," replied Bob. "Now then, old check-petticoat, are 
you going to call off your men ? " 

For answer the Malay pointed to the two trembling girls, and 
signed to his men to advance with their spears. 

" I'm horribly alarmed, Tom ! " cried Bob, " but retreating now 
is showing the white feather, and we shall be whopped. Now 
then, don't fire, but let's make a dash at them." 

The Malays were only about three yards off, having before 
retreated five or six, but now they had diminished the distance, 
when the two lads, with their pieces at their shoulders, stepped 
boldly forward, with the result that the Malays broke and fled, 
their leader first ; and out of bravado Tom Long fired a shot 
over their heads to quicken their steps, while Bob burst into a 
hearty fit of laughter. 

" Look here ! " he said. " Here's a game ! Only look, sojer !" 

" What is it I " cried Tom, drawing out the empty cartridge 
case and putting in a new one. " Why, you don't mean to say ¡ª " 

*' But I just do mean to say it ! " cried Bob, stamping about 
and laughing as he opened the breech of his gun, and drew out 
two empty cases, to replace with full 

"Not loaded!" 

" No," cried Bob, " That moment, you know, I shot at the 
snipes, and hadn't time to load again. Did you ever see such a 
game, keeping those chaps oflf with an empty gun ? Oh, I say, 
don't 1 " 





This last was in consequence of the energetic action taken by 
the two poor girls, who, seeing themselves now safe, began to 
demonstrate their gratitude by hysterical cries and sobs, seizing 
and kissing the lads* hands, and finally placing their arms round 
them and kissing their cheeks. 

" Oh, this is awful ! " cried Tom Long, who was blushing like 
a girl. 

" I shall be compelled to tell my mamma !" said Bob. " There^ 
there, it's all right. Come, give me your hand, Semiramis, or 
Cleopatra, or whatever your name is, and let us make haste down 
to the river before it is too late." 

The girl seemed to understand him, and ceased sobbing as 
she prepared to continue the flight, the other clinging to Tom- 
Long's left hand. 

" I say, though, let's have the birds," said Bob, stooping to- 
pick them up ; but the girl snatched them from him, to carry them 
herself. 

" Yes, Tom, old fellow \ no doubt about it, they're slaves. 
Come along, or we shall be cut off. It's not polite to let the 
ladies carry the baggage, but as we are the escort we must be 
prepared to fight." 

" I say 1 " cried Tom Long, " do you know the way ? " 

" Not I," said Bob ; " don't you ? " 

" Not the ghost of an idea ! " cried Tom. 

The girls were watching them, and evidently in a state ot 
great excitement were trying to comprehend their words \ but as 
soon as they saw their indecision, and their bold start off in 
the direction they imagined to be correct, then the slave girls 

understood their dilemma and stopped them, gesticulating and 
shaking their heads as they pointed in a quite fresh direction. 

'' They know where the ship lies, see if they don't," said Bob. 
" Let's trust them." 

** But suppose they lead us wrong? " replied Tom. 

" Not they," cried Bob. " They'll lead us right away. Come 
along, my fair specimens of chocolate \ vanille ; and the sooner 
we are safe under the British flag, the better I shall like it." 

The girls started off at a sharp walk, and then made signs 
that they should run. 

" All right," said Bob, nodding his head. " Double there, in 
the infantry brigade ! Naval brigade to the front ! Forward ! " 

He broke into a trot, and the little party ran sharply on, to the- 
great delight of the two escaped slaves, who, as Bob had pro- 
phesied, led them straight away to the side of the river, which 
they reached without encountering a souL 



" I'm about knocked up," said Bob, panting. *' It's disgusting 
to find these girls can beat us hollow at running." 

" The doctor's specimens are all shaken up into a regular 
mash ! " said Tom Long, peeping into the vasculum hung by a 
strap from his shoulder. 

** Never mind," replied Bob. " Here's the boat coming. I 
shall come with you straight ; or no : let's take them on board 
the ' Startler ' ? " 

" No, no ! " said Tom, " they must come to the fort" 

" No, no, to the * Startler,' I tell you." 

" No, no, to the fort." 

" Then we'll split the difference, and take them to the resi- 
dency," said Bob ; and as the boat touclied the shore they stood 
back for the girls to leap in, and then crouch down with their 
arms around each other's neck, sobbing with joy as they 
felt that now they were safe. 

There was no little excitement as the two girls were landed, 
and Mr Linton seemed puzzled as to what he should do ; but 
the poor creatures were safe now under the protection of the 
British flag -, and Bob Roberts and Tom Long proceeded to the 
doctor's quarters for a thorough wash and change, having fully 
verified old Dick's prophecy that they would be in mischief before 
the day was out. 



CHAPTER XXVL 



HOW THE TWO COMPANIONS WERE KNOCKED OFF THEIR PERCH. 



If they had not been English, the probabilities are that Bob 
Roberts and Tom Long would have hugged each other. As it 
was they seemed to think it quite the correct thing to shake 
hands over and over again, and then walk up and down under 
the palm trees of the enclosure, flushed, excited, and as' full of 
swagger as they could possibly be. 

" Blest if they don't look hke a couple o* young game cocks 
who have just killed their birds," said old Dick to Billy 
Mustard. " My word, they are cocky 1 But where are you 
going, old man ? " 

" To fetch my instrument,'* said Billy. 

" What, yer fiddle ? What do you want that ere for ? ** 

" The young gents wants it," said Billy, 

So with a nod he went into his quarters, to retmn with his 
beloved violin in its green baize bag, which he bore to where 
Bob and Tom were now seated at one of the tables beneath a 
shady tree. 

On the strength of their adventure they were indulging them- 
selves with bitter beer, into which they dropped lumps of ice, 
and as soon as Billy Mustard came, the violin was brought out, 
tuned, and the harmonious sound produced had the effect of 
soon gathering together an audience in the soft mellow hour 
before sunset. 

Several officers seated themselves at the table, and followed 
the youngsters* example ; soldiers and sailors gathered at a 
little distance beneath the trees ; and unseen by the party below, 
Rachel Linton and Mary Sinclair appeared at a mat-shaded 
window. 

" Tom Long's going to sing * The Englishman,' " shouted Bob 
Roberts suddenly, and there was a loud tapping upon the rough 
deal table. 




" No, no, I really can*t, 'pon honour," said the ensign, looking 
very much more flushed than before. 

" Yes, yes, he is," said Bob, addressing those around. " He 
is ¡ª in honour of the occasion ; and gentlemen, let's sing out the 
chorus so loudly that those niggers in the campong can hear 
our sentiments, and shiver in their shoes, where they've got 
any. " 

" Hear ! hear ! " said a young lieutenant. 

" But really, you know, I hav'n't a voice," exclaimed the 
€nsign in expostulation. 

" Gammon 1" cried Bob. ** He can sing like a bird, gentle- 
nien. Silence, please, for our national song, ' The English- 
man ' ! " 

" I can't sing it ¡ª indeed I can't," cried the ensign. 

" Oh, yes, you can ; go on," said the young lieutenant who had 
previously spoken. 

'* To be sure he will," cried Bob Roberts. " Heave ahead 
Tom, and I'll help whenever I can. It's your duty to sing it, for 
the niggers to hear our sentiments with regard to slavery ! " 

" Hear, hear ! " cried several of the officers, laughing ; and the 
men gave a cheer. 

" Slavery and the British flag ! " cried Bob Roberts, who was 
getting excited. " No man, or woman either, who has once 
sought protection beneath the folds of the glorious red white and 
blue, can ever return to slavery ! " 

" Hear, hear, hear ! " shouted the officers again, and the men 
threw up their caps, cried " Hoorar ! " and the sentry on the roof 
presented arms, 

" Now then, play up. Private Mustard ¡ª * The Englishman,' " 
cried Bob Roberts. " Get ready, Tom, and run it out with all 
your might ! " 

" Must I ? " said the ensign, nervously. 

"To be sure you must Wait a minute, though, and let him 
play the introduction. 

Billy Mustard gave the bow a preliminary scrape, and the 
audience grew larger. 

" What key shall I play it in, sir?" said Billy. 

*' Any key you like," cried Bob, excitedly. " Play it in a whole 
bunch of keys, my lad, only go ahead, or we shall forget all the 
words." 

Off" went the fiddle with a flourish over the first strain of the 
well-known song, and then, after a couple of efforts to sing, Tom 
L,ong broke dovn, and Bob Roberts took up the strain, singing 
it in a cheery rollicking boyish way, growing more confident 





every moment, and proving that he had a musical tenor voice. 
Then as he reached the end of the first verse, he waved his 
puggaree on high, jumped upon the table to the upsetting of a 
couple of glasses, and led the chorus, which was lustily trolled out 
by all present. 

On went Bob Roberts, declaring how the flag waved on every 
sea, and should never float over a slave, throwing so much en- 
thusiasm into the song that to a man all rose, and literally roared 
the chorus, ending with three cheers, and one cheer more for the 
poor girls ; and as Bob Roberts stood upon the table flushed and 
hot, he felt quite a hero, and ready to go on that voxy night and 
rescue half-a-dozen more poor slave girls from tyranny, if they 
would only appeal to him for help. 

** Three cheers for Mr Roberts," shouted Dick, the sailor, as 
Billy Mustard was confiding to a friend that "a fiddle soon got 
outer toon in that climate." 

" Yes, and three cheers for Mr Long," shouted Bob. " Come 
up here, Tom, old man ; you did more than I did." 

Tom Long was prevailed upon to mount the table, where he 
bowed again and again as the men cheered ; when, as a lull 
came in the cheering, Billy Mustard, whose fiddle had been 
musically whispering to itself in answer to the well-drawn bow, 
suddenly made himself heard in the strain of " Rule Britannia/* 
which was sung in chorus with vigour, especially when the 
singers declared that Britons never, ncvcTy never should be 
slaves ; which rang out far over the attap roofs of the drowsy 
campong. 

So satisfied were the singers that they followed up with the 
National Anthem, which was just concluded when the resident 
sent one of his servants to express a hope that the noise was 
nearly at an end. 

" Well, 1 think we have been going it," said Bob Roberts, 
jumping down. " Come along, Tom. IVe got two splendid 
cigars ¡ª real Manillas." 

Tom Long, to whom this public recognition had been ex- 
tremely painful, was only too glad to join his companion on a 
form beneath a tree, where the two genuine Manillas were lit, 
and for a quarter of an hour the youths smoked on complacently, 
when just as the exultation of the public singing was giving way 
to a peculiar sensation of depression and sickness, and each 
longed to throw away half his cigar, but did not dare, Adam 
Gray came up to where they were seated gradually growing pal* 
and wan. 

" All, Gray," said the ensign, " what is it ? " 




'*The major, sir, requests that you will favour him with your 
company directly." 

" My company ? " cried the ensign ; " what's the matter ? " 

"Don't know, sir; but I think it's something about those 
slave girls. And Captain Horton requested me to tell you to 
come too, sir," he continued, turning to Bob Roberts. 

" We're going to get promotion, I know, Tom," said the 
middy. 

" No, no," said the ensign, dolefully, " it's a good wigging." 

Bob Roberts, although feeling far from exalted now, did not 
m anywise believe in the possibility ol receiving what his com- 
panion euphoniously termed a " wigging," and with a good deal 
of his customary independent and rather impudent swagger he 
followed the orderly to a cool lamp-lit room, where sat in 
solemn conclave, the resident, Maj or Sandars, and Captain 
Horton. 

" That will do, Gray," said Major Sandars, as the youths en- 
tered; and saluted the three officers seated like judges at a table, 
" but be within hearing." 

" Might ask us to sit down," thought Bob, as he saw from the 
aspect of the three gentlemen that something serious was afloat. 

But the new arrivals were not asked to sit down, and they 
stood before the table feeling very guilty, and like a couple of 
prisoners ; though of what they had been guilty, and why they 

were brought there, they could not imagine. 

" It's only their serious way," thought Bob ; " they are going 
to compliment us." 

He stared at the shaded lamp, round which four or five moths 
and a big beetle were wildly circling in a frantic desire to commit 
suicide, but kept from a fiery end by gauze wire over the chimney. 

" What fools moths and beetles are ! " thought Bob, and then 
his attention was taken up by the officers. 

" Will you speak. Major Sandars ? " said the resident. 

" No, I think it should come from you, Mr Linton. What do 
you say. Captain Horton ? " 

" I quite agree with you. Major Sandars," said the captain 
stiffly. 

" What the dickens have we been doing ? " thought Bob ; and 
then he stared hard at the resident, and wished heartily that 
Rachel Linton's father had not been chosen to give him what he 
felt sure was a setting down for some reason or another, 

** As you will, gentlemen,'* said the resident firmly, and he then 
placed his elbows on the table and joined his fingers, while the 
light fi:om the lamp shown full upon his forehead. 




" Mr Ensign Long ¡ª Mr Midshipman Roberts," he began. 

" He might have placed me first," thought Bob. ^' I wish some 
one would catch those wretched moths." 

" You have been out on an expedition to-day ? " 

He waited for an answer, and as Tom Long had been placed 
first, Bob waited, too ; but as his companion did not speak, Bob 
exclaimed quickly, ¡ª 

" Yes, sir, snipe shooting ; " and as the resident bowed his 
head, Bob added, " two brace." 

"Confound you ¡ª you young dogs! "cried Captain Horton, 

" and you brought a brace of something else. I beg your pardon, 

Mr Linton ; go on." 

Mr Linton bowed, while Bob uttered a barely audible whistle, 
and glanced at his companion. 

" Then it's about those two girls," he thought 

" It seems, young gentlemen," continued the resident, " that 
while you were out, you met too young Malay girls ? " 

"Yes, sir." 

" Who had run away from their master ? " 

"From their owner, as he seemed to consider himself, sir," 

said Bob, who, to use his own words, felt as if all the fat was in 

the fire now, and blazed up accordingly. *'You see, sir," he 

said quickly, " we were watching for something that we saw in 

the reeds, close to the boggy ground, you know, and Tom here 

thought it was pig, but I thought it might be a deer. So we stood 

quite still till we heard sounds in the distance, when out jumped 

two dark creatures, and I was going to fire, when we saw that 

they were girls." 

** And they ran up to us," said Tom Long. 

** Like winking," said Bob, " and threw themselves on their 
knees, and clung to our legs, and wouldn't let go. Then up came 
half-a-dozen of the niggers ¡ª " 

" I think, Mr Roberts, we will call people by their right names," 
said the resident, quietly ; ** suppose we say Malays." 

" Yes, sir, Malays ; and laid liold of the girls to drag them 
away. They screamed out, and that roused us, and we sent the 
nig ¡ª Malays sta.ggQxing back. For you see, sir^as Englishmen ¡ª 

" English what ¡ª Mr Roberts ? " said Captain Horton. 

"Men, sir. I'm a midship;//a;?, sir," said Bob, sharply; and 
the captain grunted out something that sounded like " impudent 
young puppy I " but he did not look angry. 

" Go on, Mr Roberts," said the resident. 

" Well, sir, being English ¡ª boys ¡ª big boys, who felt like men 
just then ¡ª " said Bob, rather sarcastically. 




"That's not bad, Mr Roberts/* said Major Sandars, with a 
glance at the naval captain. 

" Well, sir, as the poor girls had regularly appealed to us to 
protect them, and the nig ¡ª Malays, sir, whipped out their krises, 
we presented arms, and would have given them a peppering of 
snipe shot if they hadn*t sheered off, when we brought the two 
poor weeping slave girls under the protection of the British flag, 
and set them free. Didn't we, Tom ? " 

" Yes," said Tom Long, looking nervously at the resident, and 
wondering what Rachel Linton thought about their feat. 

There was a dead silence for a few moments, during which 
Bob Roberts wiped his streaming forehead, for he felt uncom- 
fortably hot. Then the resident began, ¡ª 

"I think I am speaking the sentiments of my friends here, 
young gentlemen, when I say that you both behaved just as two 
brave British lads would be expected to behave under the cir- 
cumstances." 

" Yes," said Major Sandars, " Ensign Long, I felt sure, would 
not be wanting, if called upon." 

Tom Long's face grew the colour of his best uniform. 

" Very plucky act," said Captain Horton ; and he nodded in 
so friendly a way at the middy, that Bob felt quite beaming. 

" But," continued the resident, speaking very slowly, and as if 
weighing every word he said, " what is very beautiful in senti- 
ment, and very brave and manly if judged according to our own 
best feelings, young gentlemen, becomes very awkward some- 
times if viewed through the spectacles of diplomacy," 

" I ¡ª I don't understand you, sir," faltered Bob. 

" Let me be explicit then, young gentlemen. You both were, 
it seems, granted leave of absence to-day, for indulging in a little 
innocent sport, but by your brave, though very indiscreet conduct, 
you have, I fear, completely overset the friendly relations that we 
have been trying so hard to establish with these extremely sensi- 
tive people." 

" But, sir," began Bob, " the poor girls " 

" Yes, I know all that," said the resident quietly ; " but slavery- 
is a domestic institution among these people, and to-morrow I 
feel sure that I shall have a visit from some of the sultan's chief 
men, demanding that these poor girls be given up." 

" But they can't be now, sir," said Tom Long. 
'" No, Mr Long, we cannot return the poor girls to a state of 
slavery ; but do you not see into what an awkward position your 
act has brought us ? " 

'* I'm very sorry, sir." 



" Yes, but sorrow will not mend it We have been, and are, 
living on the edge of a volcano here, young gentlemen, and the 
slightest thing may cause an eruption. This act of yours, I 
greatly fear, will bring the flames about our heads." 

Bob Roberts turned pale, as he thought of the ladies. 

" But they'd never dare, sir," he began. 

"Dare? I believe the Malays are quite daring enough to 
attack us, should they feel disposed. But there, we need not dis- 
cuss that matter. You young gentlemen have, however, been very 
jubilant over your rescue of these poor girls, and you have been 
summoned here to warn you, while your respective officers take 
into consideration what punishment is awarded to you, that your 
noisy demonstrations are very much out of place." 

" Punishment, sir I " said Bob, who looked aghast. 

"Yes," said the resident sharply, "punishment. You do 
seem to realize, young gentleman, that your act to-day has fired 
a train. Besides which, it is a question of such import that I must 
make it the basis of a special despatch to the colonial secretary 
at Whitehall" 

Bob Roberts turned round and stared at Tom Long, but the 
latter was staring at Major Sandars. 

" I don't think I need say any more, young gentlemen," said 
the resident quietly, " and I fervently hope that I may be able to 
peaceably settle this matter ; but it is quite on the cards that it 
may be the cause of a deadly strife. And I sincerely trust that 
whatever may be the upshot of this affair, it may be a warning to 
you, as young English officers, to think a little more, and con- 
sider, before you take any serious step in your careers ; for some- 
times a very slight error may result in the loss of life. In this 
case, yours has not been a slight error, but a grave one." 

" Though we all own as quite true," said Captain Horton, 
"that we don't see how you could have acted differently; eh, 
Sandars ? " 

" Yes, yes, of course. But, hang it all, Long, how could you 
go and get into such a confounded pickle ? It's too bad, sir, 
'pon my soul, sir; it is too bad ¡ª much too bad." 

** Are we to be under arrest, sir ? " said Bob Roberts, rather 
blankly. 

" Not if you'll both promise to keep within bounds," said Cap- 
tain Horton. " No nonsense." 

" No, sir," said Bob glumly. 

" Of course not, sir," said Tom, 

" That will do then, young gentlemen," said the resident gravely; 
and the two youth.s went blankly off to their severa] quarters. 




" Poor boys ! I'm sorry for them," said the resident sadly. 

" Yes, it's a confounded nuisance, Linton," said Major Sandars 
"but you must diplomatize, and set all right somehow or 
another." 

" That's a fine boy, that Roberts," said Captain Horton. 

" I'll try my best, gentlemen," said the resident, " for all our 
sakes ; but we have a curious people to deal with, and I fear that 
this mav turn out a verv serious affair." 



CHAPTER XXVII. 



HOW DIPLOMACY WORKED IN A MALAY STAXa 

The Parang river looked like a belt of damasked silver studded 
with diamonds the next morning, while the waving feathery palms 
were of the brightest green. Mingled with these, on the shore 
farthest from the town, were the dadap trees, whose ripe scarlet 
blossoms stood out in rich relief as they gave colour to a land- 
scape already dotted with the blooms of the chumpaka, both 
yellow and white, shedding a sweet scent that Doctor Bolter said 
was like Cape jasmin, but which Bob Roberts declared to re- 
semble tea made with lavender water. 

The *' Startler," with her deck as white as hands could make it, 
lay looking smart and bright in her moorings below the island, 
her yards perfectly square, her sides glistening with fresh paint, 
her brass rails, bell, and guns flashing back the sun's rays, and 
the awnings spread over the deck almost as white as snow. 

Here and there the Jacks, in their duck frocks and straws, 
were paddling about barefooted in the sunshine, giving the last 
touches to the rails and glass of the skylights. 

On the island the resident's house and the barrack fort looked 
more like some ornamented set of buildings for summer pleasure, 
than a couple of places designed as a stronghold and retreat in 
case of danger. For the ditch and the earthwork were now car- 
petted with verdant growth, while the abattis, having been made 
of green wood, was putting forth fresh shoots. 

Both the resident and Major Sandars had been desirous of 
retaining all the shade possible, for the protection of the men ; 
therefore, save where they were likely to afford harbour to the 
enemy, trees and bushes had been spared. The men too, having 
plenty of time at disposal, had been encouraged to take to gar- 
dening, and with Doctor Bolter for head instructor, the place had 
been made to present the appearance of a nursery ground, where 
one bed rivalled another in the perfection of its growing vegetables. 
Neat, well-kept walks led up to the fort and the resident's house. 





which daily grew brighter and more picturesque, with its orna- 
mented reed-woven walls, and carefully thatched roof of attap. 
The broad verandah, with its punkahs, was made gay with beauti- 
ful creepers, climbing the pillars of palm and bamboo, and 
festooning the edges, some of these being jasmines of great size 
and beauty ; while rough rotan baskets hung at inten^als, full of 
moss and dead wood, on which flourished the wonderful orchids 
and pitcher plants that were the delight of the ladies of the 
residency. 

By the help of Doctor Bolter and Adam Gray, a large cask had 
been cut in half, and decorated on the outsides and edges with 
rough bark, in whose interstices were planted orchids, and the 
pretty maiden-hair fern ; while upon these being both mounted 
upon a short rough stump, they formed a couple of rustic vases 
of huge size, standing just inside the broad verandah, on either 
side of the entrance door, and looked, when filled with water, 
and supplied with aquatic plants, no slight additions to the 
beauty of the place. 

Upon one of his excursions with net and can Doctor Bolter had 
succeeded in capturing several of the beautiful little chastadons, 
or shooting-fish ; tiny little broad fellows, beautifully banded, 
whose peculiarity was the adroitness with which they would lie in 
wait for any unfortunate fly that settled on the edge of an aquatic 
leaf, and then fire ¡ª or rather, water ofl" at it a tiny globule, with 
such unerring aim, that the insect was generally brought down 
into the water and swallowed. Three or four would sometimes 
sail round one after the other shooting at a fly in turn till it was 
knocked off, when a rush took place for the dainty prize. 

But the river and the little jungle streams abounded with 
miniature fish of great beauty, their peculiarity being the way in 
which they were coloured, some being of a most gorgeous scarlet, 
with broad bands of vivid blue across their sides. 

All on board the " Startler " was the perfection of neatness, and 
from a friendly rivalry the residency and fort were as smart and 
neat ; perhaps never did they look to greater perfection than on 
the day after the adventure of Bob Roberts and Tom Long. 

The morning drill was over, and the sun was growing intensely 
hot, when there was heard the sound of a gong in the distance, 
and one of the sentries announced the coming of a boat 

As it drew near it was seen to be one belonging to the sultan, 
with a couple of his principal officers therein. 

They landed, each in his gay silken sarong, in whose folds the 
handle of the kris was carefully wrapped, to indicate that they 
were bound on a friendly mission, and leaving their men at the 



bamboo landing-stage fitted up by the sailors, they made their 
way to the residency. 

No sooner had the news been given to Mr Linton of the 
approach of the sultan*s boat than a signal was hoisted, whose 
effect was that the captain's gig was lowered down, and he 
arrived at the stage directly after, joining Major Sandars who 
had been fetched by an orderly, both officers being in full 
uniform. 

" I say, Tom," said Bob Roberts to his companion, who had 
come across to the ship a short time before, " if I were you I'd 
go back and fig myself. I shall put on my best duds, for you see 
if we ar'n't sent for to meet those two coffee-coloured swells." 
.* Tom Long, who was rather low-sprited about the matter, took 
the middy's advice, and went back to the island, where the 
visitors had already been ushered into the resident's reception 
room, the captain and major dropping in directly after as if by 
accident. 

It was the most friendly of visits. The two officers were the 
tumongong, or chief magistrate, and the muntri, or chief adviser, 
of the sultan ; and nothing could have been more amiable than 
their demeanour as they conversed with Mr Linton, who from 
time to time interpreted to the two British officers. 

Was there anything the sultan could do in the way of provid 
ing better supplies of rice, fruit, and meat ? A great fish expedi- 
tion was about to be set afoot, and more would be brought down 
the river and kept in floating tanks. If the resident would only 
speak, everything possible should be done. 

Nothing was required, so thanks were returned; when the 
tumongong smiled most agreeably, and said that he must now 
come to the chief object of his visit. The fact was, the sultan 
had decided to have a great tiger hunt. Much mischief had of 
late been done by tigers. Several poor fellows, especially China- 
men, had been carried off from the rice-fields, and the sultan 
had decided to get together all his elephants, with a large 
number of beaters, and have a great hunt. Would the British 
officers bring their rifles and help ? Elephants should be placed 
at their disposal, the largest the country produced, and every 
thing done to make the hunt a success. 

" Then it's a mare's nest after all, Sandars," said Captain 
Horton. "They're not going to take any notice of those boys' 
tricks. What do you say ; shall we go ? " 

" I should enjoy it immensely," said the major, " I long for a 
shot at a tiger." 

"Wait a little, gentlemen," said the resident, smiling; "the 




interview is not at an end. What shall I reply about the hunt- 
ing party ? " 

*'0h, we shall be delighted to go. You'll go too?" said 
Captain Horton, answering for both. 

" If matters are pleasantly settled," said Mr Linton. Then 
turning to the two Malay officers, whose dark restless eyes had 
been scanning the faces in turn, he said that they would be 
most happy to accept the sultan's invitation. 

The officers were delighted, and declared that the sultan's joy 
would know no bounds. 

They had previously declined all refreshments, but now that 
their business was at an end they accepted cigars, and laughed 
and chatted, evidently enjoying the visit immensely, and ac- 
cepting a proposal to walk round the grounds with alacrity. 

As they went into the verandah, the resident found a couple 
of the sultan's men waiting, with a present of the choicest fruit 
the country produced \ huge durlans, and fine mangosteens, with 
the most select kinds of plaintain known for the delicacy of 
their flavour. 

The visitors took an almost childish delight in the fish in the 
two fonts, and smiled with pleasure at the sight of the large 
selection of flowers ; but a keen observer would have noticed 
that as they walked round the fort and earthworks the muntri 
eagerly scanned every preparation for defence, though apparently 
more attracted by the uniforms of the sentries than anything else. 

As they were crossing the little parade ground, with its well- 
trampled soil, on their way back to their boat, Tom Long was 
encountered, on his way to the mess-room. 

He started on coming upon the Uttle party so suddenly, but 
saluted and went on. 

Oddly enough that brought to the muntri's memory a little 
affair that had happened on the previous day. Two young 
officers of the ship had been ashore shooting birds, and they 
found a party of the country people behaving rather ill to a couple 
of slave girls, and naturally enough, like all young men would, 
they took the girls under their protection, and brought them to 
the residency. Was it not so ? 

" Yes," the resident replied j " and they are now with the 
ladies." 

That was so good and kind, and so like the English, who were 
a great and generous nation. The sultan had been terribly 
annoyed at his people behaving so ill to the poor girls, the 
muntri continued, and they had been punished, which was quite 
right ¡ª was it not ? 




The resident perfecdy agreed with the muntri, who smiled 
content, while the tumongong looked hurt and sad. 

He was so glad that Kajah Linton was satisfied at what the 
sultan had done, and the sultan would be greatly happy at his 
acts meeting such approval from the chief of the great queen. 
So that was settled. He thanked the resident more than he 
could tell, and he would give him no more trouble about the two 
poor girls, but take them back in the boat. 

This was very cleverly done, but the sultan's officers had to 
deal with an equally clever man, one who was well versed in 
oriental wiles and diplomacy. Mr Linton was in no wise taken 
aback, since he had been waiting for this, and therefore was quite 
prepared to reply firmly that such a proceeding was impossible. 
The two girls had been brought beneath the British flag, and 
hence were slaves no longer. He could not therefore give 
them up. 

Of course the resident meant that he could not send them back 
then, the muntri observed, smiling. Perhaps the poor girls were 
ill with their fright, and the rajah resident would send them back 
when they were better. 

The resident assured his visitors that such a course was im- 
possible, for according to the British laws the girls were now free, 
and could not be forced to go back. 

The two officers did not press the matter, but began to ask 
questions about a breech-loading cannon, and were greatly sur- 
prised at the ease with which it was charged. 

They had by this time finished their cigars, and being near the 
landing-stage, they took a most effusive leave of the three officers, 
entered their boat, and were rowed away. 

" Well, then," said Captain Horton, as soon as he heard the 

parts of the conversation that he had not understood, "that 
game's over, and they are beaten at diplomacy ? " 

" Yes," said Major Sandars. " I envy you your command of 
countenance, and knowledge of the language, Linton." 

" Game ? over ? " said Mr Linton, smiling sadly. ** No, my 
dear sirs, that is only the first move our adversaries have made 
¡ª king's pawn two squares forward ; to which I have replied with 
queen's pawn one square forward." 

" And that's a bad move, isn't it, Horton? " exclaimed Major 
Sandars. 

" So the chess books make one think," said the captain. 

" It all depends upon your adversary and your game," said the 
resident, smiling. *' Gentlemen, I hope I have done right." 

" And what are you going to do now ? " said Captain Horton- 



" Wait to see our adversary's next move. Meanwhile, gentle- 
men, extra caution will do no harm, for we have touched the 
Malays in one of their most sensitive places." 

** We ? You mean those young scamps of boys," said Captain 
Horton. 

"Oh, it*s we all the same,** said Major Sandars. "Well, 
what's to be done ? " 

" I should, without seeming to do anything, put on a few extra 
sentries, Major Sandars," said the resident ; " and. Captain 
Horton, I should be ready for action at a moment's notice, and 
be cautious about who came on board, and what prahus anchored 
near." 

" Quite right ¡ª quite right, Linton," said Captain Horton. 
" You had no business to be a civilian. You ought to have been 
in the service." 

The resident smiled, and they separated, as Mr Linton said, 
to wait for the enemy's next move. 



CHAPTER XXVIII. 



HOW SULTAN HAMET VISITED HIS FRIENDS. 

The enemy, as the resident termed the sultan's party, made no 
move for a couple of days, during which all went on as usual. 
There was the usual morning parade in the fort, and the soldiers 
gardened, idled, smoked, and told one another it was "jolly 
hot" ¡ª a fact that needed no telling. On board the "Startler" 
the men were beat to quarters, and went through their drill in 
the cool of the morning, before hammock rails, the sentries' 
rifles, and the breeches of the glistening guns grew too hot to be 
touched with impunity. So hot was it, that, like the burnt child 
who fears the fire. Bob Roberts was exceedingly cautious about 
placing his hands in any spot where they were likely to be de- 
filed by the pitch that cannot be touched without those conse- 
quences ; for from between seams, and the strands of well-laid 
cables, it oozed, and even bubbled out, beneath the ardent wooing 
of the tropic sun. 

It was a listless life, but a pleasant one, for such strict disci- 
pline was observed, and stringent rules laid down by the medical 
officer of the corvette and the detachment, that the men kept 
in excellent health. They had plenty of amusements ; fruit was 
abundant, and they had taken quite a taste for the coarse 
country tobacco, which many of the soldiers smoked after the 
Malay fashion, rolled up i la cigarette in the roko, or outer 
sheath of the palm leaf, or the plaintain. Some, too, adopted 
the Malay's plan of rapidly cutting a pipe from a short joint of 
bamboo, which, with a hole bored in the side for the insertion 
of a thin reed or quill, formed a pipe much affected by the Jacks 
when they took their tobacco in smoke, instead of by the un- 
pleasantly moist masticating process. 

At the residency all went on as usual ; sometimes the ladies 
received, and there was the sound of music and singing in the 
pleasantly lit-up verandah ; sometimes Captain Horton sent his 
gig, and the agreeable little reunions were held on board the 





" Startler," in an improvised tent, draped with the ship's colours, 
while the lights were reflected on the smooth surface of the 
hurrying stream, and the Malays on shore watched the figures 
that passed to and fro till the party was over. 

Captain Horton and Major Sandars both thought the rajah's 
party had forgotten the affair; but the resident held to his 
opinion, which was strengthened by the imploring manner in 
which the two girls, who had attached themselves as attendants 
on Rachel Linton and her cousin, begged him not to let them 
be fetched away. 

"Suppose I did let them have you back," said the resident to 
them one day in their native tongue, " what would happen ? " 

One of the girls, a tall, dark, graceful creature, but with the 
protruding lips, high cheekbones, and flat distended nose of the 

Malay, rose with contracted eyebrows, took her companion, 
forced her upon her knees, and then drawing an imaginary kris 
she placed the pomt on the girl's shoulder, and struck the hilt 
with her right hand as if driving it perpendicularly down into her 
heart 

** They would kill us ¡ª so ! " she exclaimed, " and throw our 
bodies in the water to the crocodiles ! " 

The other girl shuddered, and raised her frightened eyes to 
the faces of the ladies as if imploring them to intercede ¡ª and not 
in vain. 

" But they will not trouble about you now ; " said the resident, 
tentatively. 

"Yes, yes," they both exclaimed, "they will send a naga 
and many men, but you will not let us go ? " 

" No," said the resident, quietly. " We shall not give you 
up," and he went away thoughtfully to his room, to continue 
writing the despatch he had commenced some days before. 

That same evening the two principal officers came to have a 
chat, and over their cigars Major Sandars introduced the subject 
of the doubled sentries. 

" There is no longer any need for this," he said. " Let*s see, 
Linton, it is now a week since those two fellows came. Don't 
you think, Horton, it is an unnecessary precaution ? " 

" Well, to be frank," said Captain Horton, " I do ; and I shaD 
be glad to give up our strict discipline on board." 

"What do you think, Captain Smithers?" said the resident 
to that officer, who was present 

" I cannot help agreeing with the major," he replied " I see 
no reason for these extra precautions." 

"Then I am in the minority," said the resident, smiling. 





"Look out there, gentlemen," he said, pointing through the 
open window. " What do you see ? " 

"You tell him, Smithers," said the major, "Tm too hot and 
tired to do more than breathe." 

"I can see the bright river with the lights of the steamer 
glistening on its surface; the fire-flies are darting amongst the 
trees ; the stars look soft and mellow ; altogether it is a delight- 
ful picture, that reminds one of being in some delicious summer 
retreat on the banks of dear old Father Thames." 

" Captain Smithers,*' said the resident, gravely, " it is indeed 
a beautiful picture ; the river flows peacefully on with the lights 
reflected from its bosom ; but you know as well as I, that if a 
man attempted to breast those treacherous waters, he would, 
before he had swum many yards, have been drawn down by one 
of the hideous reptiles that swarm in the Parang. That river is 
to my mind a type of the Malay feeling towards us ¡ª the intruders 
upon his soil. So little am I satisfied with what seems to me to 
be a deceitful calm, that I have serious thoughts of asking you to 
increase the sentries." 

" Nonsense, my dear Linton," said Captain Horton \ " we 
shall hear no more of the affair." 

" We shall hear more," said the resident. " Wait and see." 
The resident was right; for the next day the sultan's prin- 
cipal naga, or dragon boat, with its uncouth figure-head, was 
seen coming swiftly down the stream, propelled by about thirty 
rowers, all clad in rich yellow jackets ¡ª the royal colour ¡ª and 
nattily-made scarlet caps. Their lower limbs were bare, save 
where covered by their scarlet and yellow sarongs. The men 
rowed well together ; and as the word was passed by the sentries 
the officer on duty could plainly make out beneath the matting 
awning reaching nearly from end to end of the boat, the figures 
of the sultan and several of his officers. 

The sultan was easily distinguishable ; for while his chief 
officers strictly adhered to their native costume, he wore a gor- 
geous semi-military uniform, that had specially been built ¡ª so 
Bob Roberts termed it ¡ª for him in England. It was one mass 
of rich embroidery, crossed by a jewelled belt, bearing a sabre 
set with precious stones, and upon his head he wore a little 
Astracan fur ke/i, surmounted by an egret's plume, like a feathery 
fountain from a diamond jet. 

Orders were given for the guard to turn out, and the resi- 
dent and Major Bandars hurriedly prepared to meet their dis- 
tinguished guest, who, however, did not stop at the island, but 
went straight on to the corvette, where he was received by a 





guard of marines, the captain awaiting his visitor upon the 
quarter-deck. 

The visit was but short, for at the end of a few minutes 
Captain Horton accompanied the sultan on board the naga, 
and the long low vessel was swiftly turned, and rowed with no 
little skill to the island landing-place, where a sufficiently im- 
posing military force, under Captain Smithers, was ready to 
receive him, the sultan walking up to the residency verandah, 
between a double line of infantry with bayonets fixed. 

The eastern potentate's opal eyeballs rolled from side to 
side as, looking rather awkward in his ill-fitting European dress, 
he tried hard to emulate the dignity of his bronze followers in 
baju and sarong, each man with the handle of his kris carefully 
covered by a silken fold. 

On landing here, the sultan was followed by his kris and 
sword-bearers, each haying his appointed station behind the 
monarch, holding the weapons by the sheath, with the hilt 
against the right shoulder, so that a very respectable procession, 
full of colour and glow, was formed from the landing-place to 
the residency. 

The most incongruous part of the following was the appear- 
ance of the officer who bore an umbrella to keep the rays of 
the sun from his liege's head ; but as in place of one of the 
gorgeous, gold-fringed, scarlet- clothed sunshades generally used 
for that purpose, this was an unmistakeable London-made chaise 
gingham, with a decidedly Gampish look, it robbed its master of 
some of his dignity, though he was so busily employed in trying 
to carry his richly -jewelled sabre with the case of the English 
officers, and at the same time to show the splendid weapon to 
the best advantage, that he saw not the want of dignity in his 
umbrella, and walked awkwardly to where Mr Linton received 
him in company with Major Sandars, and such officers as could 
hurry on the uniforms they so scrupulously avoided in that 
torrid clime. 

Tom Long, who paid more attention to the embellishment 
of his person than any man in the detachment, was one of the 
officers present, and although nervous about the Sultan's visit, 
and feeling certain that it had to do with the rescue of the 
slave girls, he could not help a smile at the umbrella, and a con- 
gratulatory sensation that Bob Roberts was not present, for he 
would have been sure to laugh, when an extension of the risible 
muscles might have been taken as an insult not to be endured. 

The august visitors were received in the wide verandah on 
account of their number, where the sultan took the seat placed 





for him ; five of his principal men, including the former am- 
bassadors, stood behind him ; the rest, sword and umbrella- 
bearers, carriers of the potentate's golden betel-box and spit- 
toon, squatted down on their heels, and were as motionless as so 
many images of bronze. 

The various British officers remained with the resident, 
standing, out of respect to the sultan, whose heavy dark features 
seemed to express satisfaction ; and he at once proceeded in 
a rather forced, excited manner to inform the resident that he 
had only been having a water- excursion, and had thought hovf 
much he should like to see his good friends at the residency. 

The resident was delighted, of course, at this mark of con- 
descension, and hastened to assure the sultan of the fact. 

The latter then proceeded to announce that his grand tiger 
hunt would take place in a fortnight's time, and begged that all 
the officers would accept his invitation. 

As spokesman and interpreter, the resident assured his 
august visitor that as many as possible would be there ; when in 
addition the sultan asked that a great many soldiers might be 
sent as well, to help keep the tigers from breaking back when 
the hunt was on. 

To this, Mr Linton, by Major Sandars' permission, readily 
assented ; and then, knowing of old his visitor's taste in such 
matters, some champagne was produced. At the sight of the 
gold-foiled bottles the rajah's eyes glistened, and he readily par- 
took of a tumbler twice filled for him ; after which he walked 
into the house with the resident, as an excuse for not being 
present when his followers partook of some of the wine. 

At length, after a walk round the fort, which was willingly 
accorded to him, that he might see that the residency and its 
protectors were well on the gut vive^ the sultan took his de- 
parture, begging earnestly that all who could would come to the 
hunting expedition. Then the soldiers presented arms, and the 
little procession, gay of aspect, proceeded down to the bamboo 
landing-stage, where the visitor embarked with his following, and 
seated himself beneath the reed awning of his boat. Word was 
given, and the yellow and scarlet rowers bent to their oars, 
sending the long light naga vigorously up stream, one blaze of 
brilliant colour in the morning sun, till it disappeared round a 
verdant point about half-a-mile ahead, 

'* Well, Linton," said Major Sandars, " what do you say to it 
now?" 

" Ah, to be sure," said Captain Horton. " Isn't the stoma 

blown over?" 





*' Really, gentlemen, it looks like it," said the resident, " and 
I must confess that I am heartily glad to find that I have been 
wrong." 

"Wrong? yes," said the Major. "Those fellows are no more 
fools than we are, and knowing what they do of the strength of 
our guns, and the discipline of our men, they would as soon 
think of measuring force with us, as of flying. Smithers, 
march the men back into quarters out of this raging sunshine, 
and to-night only put on the usual guard. What shall you do, 
Horton ? ? 

" Only have the customary watch," was the reply. 

Tom Long conveyed to Bob Roberts an account of what had 
taken place, and the reduction of the guard at night ; to which 
that sage young midshipman replied, that the British Lion was 
only going to withdraw his claws within their sheaths, but the 
claws were there still ; and that it would be exceedingly uncom- 
fortable for any Malay gentleman on shore if the said B. L. was 
to put his claws out once more. 

" But I say, Tom," he exclaimed, "get the major to let you 
go to the tiger hunt." 

** Do you think you can get leave ? " said the ensign. 

" I mean to try it on, my boy. The cap is sure to be huffy, 
on account of our last affair; but nothing venture, nothing gain, 
and I mean to go, somehow or another, so tigers beware. What 
are you laughing at ? " 

'* The idea of you shooting a tiger," said Tom Long. " That's 
all" 

" I daresay I could if I tried," said Bob shortly, 

"I daresay you could," said Long, " but we'll see. We have 
to get leave first." 

" That's soon got," said Bob Roberts. " Depend upon it, I 
shall be there." 

*' And I, too." said Tom Long ; and the young fellows parted, 
each of them in secret vowing that he would have the skin 
of the tiger he meant to shoot, carefully dressed, lined with 
blue satin and scarlet cloth, and present it to Rachel Linton 
as a tribute of respect. 

But the tiger had first of all to be shot 



CHAPTER XXIX. 



HOW ALI FELL INTO A TRAP. 

Thev were ver}' delightful days at the residency for the English 
party. The heat was certainly great, but the arrangements made 
as soon as they were settled down, warded that off to a great ex- 
tent. The men enjoyed the life most thoroughly, especially as 
for sanitary reasons Doctor Bolter forbade that either the soldiers 
or the Jacks should be exposed to too much exertion. 

The days were days of unclouded sunshine as a rule, and when 
this rule was broken, the change was to a heavy thunder-storm, 
with a refreshing rain, and then the skies were once more blue. 

Fruit and flowers, and various other supplies, were brought 
now in abundance, especially since Dullah had been allowed to 
set up a trading station at the island. He monopolized the 
whole business, the various boats that came rowing straight to 
him ; but he did it all in so pleasant a manner, that no one could 
complain. To the English people he was suavity itself. His 
courtesy ¡ª his gentlemanly bearing was the talk of the whole 
place ; and regularly every morning one of his Malay slaves or 
bond-servants used to carry up and lay in the residency verandah 
a large bunch of deliciously fresh orchids, or pitcher plants^ or a 
great branch of some sweet-scented flowering shrub, for which he 
always received the ladies* thanks in a calm, courteous way that 
quite won their confidence. 

Dullah's reed hut, with its bamboo-supported verandah, be- 
came quite a favourite resort, and he very soon provided it 
¡öwith a frontage each way. In the one verandah he arranged to 
supply the resident, the ladies, and officers ; and in the other 
the soldiers and sailors, and received his supplies from the boats. 

Sometimes the ladies walked down to buy fruit, sometimes it 
was the officers ; but the two best customers were Tom Long and 
Bob Roberts, the former spending a great deal in flowers, to send 
to the residency ¡ª a very bad investment by the way ¡ª for the 
rapid rate at which they faded was astounding. Once his duty 



¡ª as he called it ¡ª done, in sending a bunch of flowers, Tom 
Long used to indulge himself with fruit. 

Bob Roberts had given up sending flowers, so he had more 
money to spend upon his noble self in fruit, and he spent it 
where he was pretty well sure to encounter Tom Long, when- 
ever he could get leave to run across to the island. 

Bob's way of addressing Dullah was neither refined nor polite, 
for it was always " Hallo, old cock," and at first DuIIah looked 
very serious ; but as soon as his aide and companion interpreted 
to him the words, he smiled and seemed perfectly satisfied, 
always greeting the young midshipman with a display of his 
white teeth, for he considered his comparison to a fighting-cock, 
of which birds the Malays are passionately fond, quite a 
compliment. 

The result was that for a small sum Bob was always sure of a 
choice durian, which he feasted upon with great gusto, while Tom 
Long came and treated himself to mangosteens. 

Dullah always behaved to the young ensign with the greatest 
politeness, that young gentleman returning it with a sort of 
courteous condescension which said plainly enough that Dullah 
was to consider himself a being of an inferior race. 

But Dullah accepted it all in the calmest manner, smilingly 
removing the malodorous durians which Bob maliciously con- 
trived to place near the seat Tom Long always occupied, and 
waiting upon the ensign as if he were a grandee of the first water. 

And here, as a matter of course, the subject of the approach- 
ing tiger hunt was discussed, Dullah, by means of his companion, 
becoming quite animated about the matter, and enlarging as to 
the number and beauty of the tigers that would be shot. 

Both Tom Long and the middy were having a fruit feast one 
day, when AH, who had been off to the steamer, and then came 

on to the island, made his appearance in search of his two 

friends, Dullah quietly disappearing into the back of his hut, to 
attend to some of the sailors who had come in, while his com- 
panion waited upon the young officers. 

Of course the tiger hunt was the principal subject of dis- 
cussion, and Ali promised to arrange to have one of the largest 
of the sultan's elephants fitted with a roomy howdah, so that they 
three could be together. 

" I can manage that," he said, "through my father, and we'll 
have a grand day." 

" But shall we get any tigers ? " asked Bob. 

" No fear of that," was the reply. " I'll contrive that we shall 

be in the best part of the hunt." 



" That will be close to the sultan, of course ? " 

All's dark eyes were raised inquiringly to the speaker's face, 
but seeing that this was not meant sarcastically, he said drily, ¡ª 

" No ; I shall arrange to be as far away from the sultan's 
elephant as I can." 

Bob looked at him keenly. 

" What, isn't he fond of tigers ? " he said sharply. 

** My father is the sultan's officer, and greatly in his confi- 
dence," said the young man quietly. "I don't think the sultan 
is very fond of hunting, though." 

Just at this moment, unseen, of course, by the three young men, 
Dullah was whispering to a rough-looking, half-naked Malay, 
into whose hands he placed a little roll of paper, which the man 
secured in the fold of his sarong, dropped into a sampan, and 
then hastily paddled to the mainland, where he plunged into the 
wood and disappeared. 

Meanwhile the three friends sat chatting, and Ali expressed his 
sorrow about the adventure the two young Englishmen had had 
with the slave girls. 

" Where are they now ? " he quietly asked. 

" Oh, Miss Linton and her cousin have quite adopted them," 
said Bob. " But surely you don't think we did wrong." 

" Speaking as the son of the Tumongong, I say yes," replied 
Ali ; " but as one who has imbibed English notions and ideas, I 
am bound to say that what you did only makes me feel more 
thoroughly how it is time we had a complete revolution in 
Parang." 

" I say," said Bob, ^* you'll get stuck up for high treason, young 

fellow, if you talk about revolution." 

*' No fear," said Ali, laughing quietly. " My ideas are pretty 
well known ; but I am too insignificant a fellow for what I say to 
be noticed. Now if it was my father ¡ª " 

" Yes ¡ª if it was your father," said Bob, '' I suppose they would 
kris him ? " 

Ah nodded, and after a quiet cigar under the trees, during 
which he complained more than once of the wrench the seizure 
by the crocodile had given to his muscles, he bade them good- 
bye, promising to have everything ready for the tiger hunt, and, 
leaping into his boat, was rowed away. 

Ali had about a mile to walk along one of the jungle paths to 
reach his father's house, and he was going along very thought- 
fully under the trees, quite alone ¡ª for he had left his men behind, 
to look after and secure the boat. It was comparatively cool in 
the shade, and he began thinking about the two young men 




he had left, and contrasting their civilized life with his. The 

savagery and barbarism by which he was surrounded disgusted 

him ; and knowing well as he did, how the sultan and the 

various rajahs of the little states lived by oppressing and grinding 

down the wretched people around, he longed for the time when 

a complete change should come about, bringing with it just laws, 

and a salutary rule for his country. His own life troubled him 

in no small degree, for he saw nothing in the future but the 

career of a Malay chief, a ruler over slaves, living a life of 

voluptuous idleness, and such an existence he looked upon with 
horror. 

Could he not enter the British service in some way ? he asked 
himself, and rise to a life of usefulness, in which he might do 
some good for the helpless, ground-down people amongst whom 
he was born ? 

Such a life, he told himself, would be worth living, and ¡ª 

What was that ? 

His hand involuntarily flew to his kris, as he heard a rustle 
amidst the tangled cane just ahead, and he advanced cautiously 
lest it should be some beast of prey, or one of the great serpents 
that had their existence amidst the dense undergrowth. 

There it was again; a quick sharp rustle amidst the trees, 
as of something hastily escaping, and his hand fell to his side, 
and he watched eagerly in advance, not hearing a cat-like 
step behind him, as a swarthy Malay came in his tracks, 
sprang upon the young man's back, and pinioned his arms in an 
instant. 

Ali uttered a hoarse cry, and strove to draw his kris, but the 
effort was vain. Three more Malays darted from their hiding- 
places, and in a few minutes he was securely bound, with a por- 
tion of his sarong thrust into his mouth to keep him from crying 
for help ; another Malay, who had been pulling a long rattan 
on ahead to imitate the sound of an escaping animal, coming 
from his hiding-place and smiling at the success of the ruse. 

** What does it mean ?" Ali asked himself; but he was puzzled 
and confused, and his captors gave him no opportunity for further 
thought, but hurried him right away into the depths of the jungle 
through a long narrow winding track that was little used. 

" Why, this leads to the sultan's old house, where the inchees 
were killed 1 " thought Ali. " Surely they are not going to kill 
me?" 

A shudder ran through him, and a strange sense of horror 
seemed to freeze his limbs as he was half thrust half carried 
Along through the jungle, his captors having at times to use 



" That will be close to the sultan, of course ? " 

All's dark eyes were raised inquiringly to the speaker's face, 
but seeing that this was not meant sarcastically, he said drily, ¡ª 

" No ; I shall arrange to be as far away from the sultan's 
elephant as I can." 

Bob looked at him keenly. 

" What, isn't he fond of tigers ? " he said sharply. 

** My father is the sultan's officer, and greatly in his confi- 
dence," said the young man quietly. "I don't think the sultan 
is very fond of hunting, though." 

Just at this moment, unseen, of course, by the three young men, 
Dullah was whispering to a rough-looking, half-naked Malay, 
into whose hands he placed a little roll of paper, which the man

leaping into his boat, was rowed away. 

Ali had about a mile to walk along one of the jungle paths to 
reach his father's house, and he was going along very thought- 
fully under the trees, quite alone ¡ª for he had left his men behind, 
to look after and secure the boat. It was comparatively cool in 
the shade, and he began thinking about the two young men 




with creepers, which had formed a new thatch in place of the 
old attap top. The bamboos that formed the floor were slippery 
here and there with damp moss and fungus, and in several places 
they were rotted away ; but there was plenty to afford a fair space 
of flooring, and in a momentary glance Ali saw that the inner or 
women's room of the house was dry, and not so much ruined as 
the place where he stood. 

" Did they kris the poor prisoners here?" he asked himself; 
and then his thoughts flew to the bright river upon which his 
boat had so often skimmed ; to the clean, trim corvette, with its 
bright paint, smart sailors, and Bob Roberts, the merry, cheery 
young English lad. Then he thought of the residency, with the 
sweet graceful ladies, the pleasant officers, always so frank and 
hospitable ; of Tom Long, whom he liked in spite of the ensign's 
pride and stand-offishness ; and lastly he asked himself what 
they would think of him for not keeping faith with them about 
the hunt, and whether they would ever know that he had been 
treacherously krissed in that out-of-the-way place. 

A grim smile crossed his lip as he wished that he might be 
thrown afterwards in the river, and his body float down to be 
seen by the English people, so that they might know why he had 
stopped away. 

And then a thrill ran through him, for a couple of his captors 
seized him, and in the dim green light of the place, with a few 
thin pencils of sunshine striking straight through like silver 
threads from roof to floor, he saw a third man draw his deadly 
kris. 



CHAPTER XXX. 



HOW PRIVATE GRAY PROVED SUSPICIOUS. 

Adam Gray left the men in the mess-room that night, chatting 
about the coming tiger-hunt, and wondering who would be 
selected to accompany the expedition. He could not help think- 
ing, as he shouldered his rifle, and was marched off by a sergeant 
with half-a-dozen more, to relieve guard, that he should like to 
be one of the party himself. In happy bygone days he had been 
fond of sport, and in a trip to North America were well-remem- 
bered perils and pleasant adventures. And now this talk of the 
tiger hunt had roused in him a strong interest, and set him 
recalling days when he was very different to what he was now. 

" It's no good to sigh," he said to himself, and the measured 
tramp, tramp of the marching men sounded solemn and strange 
in the darkness, rousing him once more to a sense of his 
position. 

" If I'm to go, I go," he said bitterly, " That will be as my 
superiors please ; and if I do go, it will not be as a hunter." 

In spite of himself, however, as soon as guard had been 
relieved, and he was left in charge of a post not far from 
Dullah's hut, his thoughts went back to his early career, and he 
grew at times quite excited as he compared it with the life he 
was living now. 

Then his thoughts wandered to the residency, and from thence 
back to the day when he was bitten by the sea snake, and 
lay there upon the deck tended by Miss Linton. 

These thoughts agitated him, so that he set off pacing briskly 
up and down for a couple of hours, and then, his brain calmed 
by the exercise, he stood still under the shadow of a great palm, 
with whose trunk, as he stood back close to it, his form so 
assimilated in the darkness that at a couple of yards distance he 
was invisible. 

His post was close to the river, so close that he walked upon 
the very edge of the bank, which was in places undermined by 




the swift current. This post had been cleared from the thick 
jungle. It was but a narrow piece, some two yards wide, and 
forty long, and this it was his duty to pace during his long 
watch, to guard that side of the island from a landing foe. 

Midnight had passed, and all was very still. There was a splash 
from time to time in the stream, telling of the movement of some 
reptile or great fish, and now and then, from the far-distant parts 
of the jungle across the water, he could hear the cry of some 
wild beast. Now and then he watched the fire-flies scintillating 
amidst the leaves, and thought of how different life was out in 
this far-off tropic land to that in dear old England. 

He had been thinking quite an hour without stirring ; but 
though his memory straryed here and there, his eyes were watch- 
ful, and he scanned from time to time the broad smooth surface 
of the stream in search of passing boats. 

At last he fancied he detected something dark moving along, 
but it went by so smoothly that it might have been the trunk of 
some tree, or even the back of a great crocodile, for there was 
no splash of oars. 

He had almost forgotten the incident, when he started 
slightly and listened, thmking he could hear a whispering, and 

this was repeated. 

He listened intently, but though he felt sure that he could 
hear voices, still that need not mean danger, for sound passes so 
easily across the water, that the noise might have come from down 
lower in the island, or even from the shore across the river. 

The whispering ceased, and then he listened in vain for a 
time, and at last he was just thinking of pacing up and down 
once more, when certainly there was a faint splash, and on look- 
ing in the direction he could see on the dark water what seemed 
like a dim shadow gliding along. 

It might have been a boat or the shadow of a boat, he could 

not be sure. In fact, there were moments when he doubted 
whether it was not some ocular illusion brought about by too 
intently gazing through the gloom. 

And there he stood, hesitating as to whether he should fire 

and give the alarm. 

But the next moment he reasonably enough asked himself 
why he should do so, for there was nothing alarming in the 
fact of a tiny sampan gliding over the river. It might be 
only a fisherman on his way to some favourite spot, or perhaps 
one of the Malays bound up the river, or possibly after all 

a mere deception. 

There seemed to be nothing to merit the alarm being raised, 





and he stood watching once more the spot where the boat had 
disappeared. Still he did not resume his march up and down, 
but recalled the night of the attack, and began to consider how 
easy it would be for a crafty enemy to land and take them by 
surprise some gloomy night. Dark skinned, and lithe of action 
as cats, they could easily surprise and kris the sentries. In his 
own case, for instance, what would be easier than for an enemy 
to lurk on the edge of the thick jungly patch by which the path 
ran, and there stab him as he passed ? 

** It would be very easy," he thought. " Yes ; and if I stand 
here much longer I shall begin to think that I am doing so be- 
cause I dare not walk beside that dark piece of wood Still I 
dare do it, and I will." 

As if out of bravado, he immediately began to pace his 
allotted post once more, and he had hardly gone half way when 
a sharp sound upon his left made him bring his piece down to 
the present, and wait with bayonet fixed what he looked upon as 
a certain attack. 

Again he hesitated about firing and giving the alarm, for fear 
of incurring ridicule and perhaps reprimand. He knew in his 
heart that he was nervous and excitable, being troubled lest any 
ill should befall the occupants of the residency, and being in 
such an excited state made him ready to imagine everything he 
saw to mean danger. 

So he stood there, ready to repel any attack made upon him, 
and as he remained upon his guard the rustling noise increased, 
and be momentarily expected to see the leaves parted and some 
dark figure rush out; but still he was kept in suspense, for 
nothing appeared. 

At last he came to the conclusion that it was some restless 
bird or animal disturbed by his presence, and told himself that 
the noise made was magnified by his own fancies ; and, rather 
glad that he had not given the alarm, he continued to march up 
and down, passing to and fro in close proximity to a dark Malay. 
whose hand clasped a wavy, dull-bladed kris, that the holder 
seemed waiting to thrust into his chest the moment an opportunity 
occurred, or so soon as the sentry should have given the alarm. 

At last the weary watch came to an end, for the tramp of the 
relief was heard, and Sergeant Lund marched up his little party 
of men, heard Gray's report of the rustling noise, and the dark 
shadow on the river ; said " Humph ! " in a grufif way ; a fresh 
man was placed on sentry, and Adam Gray was marched back 
with the other tired men who were picked up on the round into 
the little fort 



CHAPTER XXX L 



HOW SOME COULD GO AND SOME MUST STAY. 

The day of the tiger hunt was at last close at hand. A vast 
deal of communication and counter communication had taken 
place with the sultan, whose people were making great prepara- 
tions for the event. 

The sultan was constantly sending messengers, and asking 
that stores might be given him with plenty of ammunition. 
Not, though, in any mean begging spirit, for whenever a couple 
of his chiefs came with some request they were accompanied by 
a train of followers bearing presents ¡ª food, supplies of the finest 
rice, sugar-cane, and fruit ; buifaloes and poultry ; slabs of tin, 
little bags of gold dust, specimens of the native work ; an 
abundance, in short, of useful and valuable things, all of which 
were accepted ; though there was a grim feeling in the mind of 
Mr Linton that pretty well everything had been taken by force 
from some of the sultan's miserable subjects. 

Still the policy was, to be on the best of terms wtth the sultan, 
and to hope to introduce reforms in his rule by degrees. The 
resident took the old school copy-book moral into consideration, 
that example was better than precept, and knowing full well that 
any sweeping code of rules and regulations would produce dis- 
taste, certain hatred, and perhaps a rising against the English 
rule, he determined to introduce little improvements by degrees, 
each to be,|he hoped, tiny seeds from which would grow grand 
and substantial trees. 

The tiger hunt was being prepared for evidently with childlike 
delight, and instead of its being a few hours' expedition, it proved 
that it was to be an affair of a week. Tents were to be taken, 
huts to be formed, and quite a large district swept of the danger- 
ous beasts. For as the sultan informed the English officers, the 
tigers had been unmolested for quite two years, and saving one 
or two taken in pitfalls, they had escaped almost scot free. The 
consequence of this was, that several poor Malays had been 




carried off from their rice fields, and at least a dozen unfortunate 
Chinamen from the neighbourhood of some tin mines a few miles 
away. 

" I never meant to enter into such an extensive affair, gentle- 
men," said the resident to Major Sandars and Captain Horton 
after dinner one day, when they had all been entertained at the 
mess-room. " I almost think we ought to draw back before it is 
too late." 

" Well, I don*t know," said Major Sandars. " It will please 
the sultan if we take a lot of men, and this is rather a stagnating 
life. I frankly tell you I should be very glad of the outing, and 
I am sure it would do good to the men." 

" I quite agree with you, Sandars," said Captain Horton ; and 
Bob Roberts and Tom Long, who were opposite one another at 
the bottom of the table, exchanged glances. " I want a change, 
and I should be glad to give my lads a turn up the country, 
Driirs all very well, but it gets wearisome. What do you say, 
Smithers ?" 

" I must confess to being eager to go,*' was the reply. " It 
seems to me the only gentleman who does not care for the trip 
is Mr Linton." 

" My dear fellow, you never made a greater mistake in your 
life," said Mr Linton, laughing. " Nothing would please me 
better than to be off for a couple of months, with a brace of 
good rifles, and an elephant, with plenty of beaters. I could 
even manage to exist for three months without reading a report, 
or writing a despatch." 

Here there was a hearty laugh, and Mr Linton went on, ¡ª 

"There is one voice silent ¡ª the most important one, it seems 
to me. Come, doctor, what do you say ? may we all go up the 
country and live in tents ? *' 

" Hah ! " said Doctor Bolter, " now you have me on the hip. 
I want to go myself, horribly." 

" Ha, ha, ha, ha !" laughed every one in chorus. 

" I want to see those black monkeys like our friend Mr Bob 
Roberts has for a pet. I say I want to see them in their native 
state. I want to get a specimen of the pink rhinoceros, and 
some of the Longicoms, Ny?nphaiis Calydonia is to be found 
here, and I must shoot a few specimens of Cymbirhynchiis 
Macrorhynchusy besides supplying my horius siccus with a com- 
plete series of Nepentlies^^ 

" For goodness' sake, doctor, don't go on like that," cried 
Captain Horton. " If you want to be cheerful to that extent, give 
us a recitation in pure Malay.*' 





" Ah, you may all laugh," said the doctor ; " but I'm not 
ashamed of being a modest naturalist" 

" Modest I " said Major Sandars. " Do you call that modest, 
to talk big like that ? But come, tell us, may we go safely ? " 

"That's what I can't quite settle," said the doctor. " I don't 
know what to say to you* A week's hunting picnic would be 
very nice/ 

** Splendid," said everybody. 

" And you'd have a good supply of tents? I can't have my 
men sleeping in the open air." 

''Abundance of everything," said Major Sandars. "Regular 
commissariat stores ¡ª mess tent, and the rest of it.'* 

" Stop a minute," said the doctor, " not so fast. You see, 
what I'm afraid of is fever." 

" We all are," said Captain Horton. " Never mind, take a 
barrel and keep a strong solution of quinine always on tap for 
us. Now then, may we go ? You see if it was on duty we 
shouldn't study a moment, but as it's a case of pleasuring ¡ª " 

" And keeping up good relations with the sultan," said the 
resident. 

" And freeing the country from a pest," said Captain Horton. 

" Tigers are pests enough," said the doctor, " but intermittent 
or jungle fever is to my mind the pest of the country." 

*' Yes, of course, doctor," said the resident; "but what do 
you think, may we go ? " 

The doctor sat tapping the table with a dessert knife. 

** Will you all promise me faithfully not to drink a drop of 
water that has not been filtered ? " he said. 

" Yes, yes, yes," came from all down the table. 

" I'll promise, doctor, not to drink any water at all," said Bob 
Roberts in a low voice, that was heard, though, by the doctor. 

" It strikes me, young gentleman, that you won't get anything 
stronger," he said. "Well, gentlemen, if you'll all promise to 
abide by my rules, I'll s^y yes; you may go. ^* 

A long quiet conversation was afterwards held, and finally it 
was decided that- quite half the men should go, and on the eve 
of the expedition the final preparations had been made, tents and 
stores had been sent ashore ready for a start at daybreak. 

The river had been scoured by the corvette's boats, and no 
trace of Rajah Gantang's prahus found ; in fact, nothing had 
been heard of him or them for many days ; and all being 
esteemed satisfactory and safe on that score, what remained to 
do was to settle who should stay and protect the residency and 
the corvette, and who should go. 





As far as the men were concerned, this was soon settled ; for 
the order was given to fall in, and they were soon ranged in line, 
every man anxious in the extreme as to his fate. The next 
order was for the even numbered to take two paces back, and the 
next for the rear-rank men to fall out ; they were the lucky ones, 
and in a high state of delight. 

With the officers it was more difficult However, that was 
soon settled. Captain Horton said that he should go; and gave 
the corvette in charge of Lieutenant Johnson. Major Sandars 
followed his example by appointing Captain Smithers to the task 
of taking command of the fort ; and to his great disgust Tom 
Long found that he was not to be of the select. 

The resident had not intended to go, but so pressing a request 
that he would come had arrived from the sultan, that he felt 
bound to make one of the party. On the eve of the start the 
principal talk was of the qualities and powers of the various 
rifles and shot guns that had been brought out to be cleaned and 
oiled. 

Tom Long was solacing himself out in the open air with a 
strong rank cigar that had been given him by a brother officer, 
and very poorly it made him feel. But he put that all down to 
the major's account for depriving him of his treat. 

** I'll be even with him, though," he said, breaking out into the 
habit of talking aloud. ** I won't forget it." 

The night was very dark and starless, and he stood leaning 
up against a tree, when he heard the splash of oars from the 
landing-place, a short sharp order, and then the rattling of a ring- 
bolt 

" Some one from the steamer, I suppose," he growled. " Gun 
borrowing, I'll be bound. They don't have mine, whoever wants 
it" 

" Here you, sir," said a familiar voice, as a figure came up 
through the darkness. " Where's Major Sandars ¡ª at the officers* 
quarters or the residency? Do you hear! Why don't you 
speak ? " 

" That path leads to the officers* quarters, Ivir Robert Roberts, 
and the other leads, as you well know, to the residency. Now 
go and find out for yourself, and don't air your salt-junk bluster 
on shore." 

" Salt-junk bluster be bothered," said Bob sharply. *' How 
the dickens was I to know it was you standing stuck up against 
that tree like two tent poles in a roll of canvass ? Here, I've 
come from the skipper to see if the major's got any spare leggings, 
for fear of the noble captain getting any thorns in his legs." 




" Hang the captain i" growled Tom. 

" Hang the major, then !" said Bob sharply. 

** You may hang them both, if you like," said Tont 

" I should like to kris them all over, till they looked like 
skewered chickens ready for the spit," said Bob. " I say, ain't 
it an awful shame ? " 

" Shame, yes," said Tom Long, slightly mollified by his com- 
panion's sympathy. " I don't see why one of us two should be 
left out of the party. It isn't much pleasure we get." 

" No," said Bob sharply ; " but I think if one of us was to go 
it ought to have been this young person." 

" Well, but you are going, aren't you ?" said Tom Long. 

"Not I," said Bob. ^^Vm second officer onboard H.M.S. 
'Startler ' till they come back, that's all." 

'*But, my dear Bob, I thought you were going. Old Dick, 
who was ashore an hour ago, told me you were." 

" Then old Dick told you a cram," said Bob. " He said you 
were going, though." 

" I'll kick old Dick first time I see him," cried Tom Long. 
" Fm not going. Smithers and I are to be in charge of the 
fort." 

" You are not going?" cried Bob incredulously. 

"Nol" 

? Oh, I am glad." 

? Thanky," said Tom. 

" No, I don't mean that," said Bob. " I mean I'm glad I'm 
not going, now you are not." 

" I say, Bob, do you mean that ? " said Tom Long excitedly, 
and dropping all his stiffness. 

" Of course I do," said Bob. " What's the fun of going with- 
out a friend ? " 

" Bob, you're a regular little brick," said Tom Long. ?* Shake 
hands. 'Pon my word I shall end by liking you." 

Bob shook hands, and laughed. 

" Oh, I say, though," he exclaimed- " Poor old Ali I Won't 
he be cut up, just?" 

" Yes, he won't Uke it," said Tom Long thoughtfully. ^ And he 
was to have a big elephant all ready for us." 

" Yes," said Bob. "But I say, I wonder we haven't heard 
firom him since that day he was here." 

"Yes, he might have sent a message of some kind." 

" He's been up the country with a butterfly net to catch an 
elephant for us," said Bob, laughing. 

" And now he'U have it all to himself," said Tohl 




"I'll bet half a rupee that he don't/' said Bob. 

" Oh, yes, he will," said Tom. " I rather like him, though. 
He isn't a bad sort of nigger." 

" Don't call the fellows niggers,^* said Bob impatiently; " they 
don't like it." 

" Then they mustn't call us giaours and dogs,^^ said Tom im- 
patiently. 

" Look here," cried Bob, " I must go on after these leggings 
for the skipper ; but, I say, Tom, as I said before, I'll bet half a 
rupee that Ali don't go to the hunt when he finds we are to stay.'* 

-* Stuff ! " 

" Well, it may be stuff ; but you see if he don't stop behind, 
and, as soon as they are all off, come across here." 

" I wish he would," said Tom, "It'll be dull enough." 

" If he does, we'll have a good turn at the fish/' said Bob. 
?* Good night, if I don't see you again." 

" I say," said Bob, turning round and speaking out of the 
darkness. 

"Well?" 

" I don't wish 'em any harm ; but I hope they won't see a 
blessed tiger all the time they're away." 

" So do I/' said Tom. " Good night ! " 

"Good night!" And Bob found the major; borrowed the 

pair of canvas leggings, with which he returned to the boat, and 

was rowed back to the corvette, where he had the pleasure of 

going over the captain's shooting gear, and helping him to fill 

his cartridge cases, and the like. 

" You'll have to go on a trip yourself, Roberts, by-and-by," 
said the captain. 

"Thankye, sir," said Bob. " When, sir, please?" 

"When the soreness about rescuing those slave girls has 

worn off, Master Bob Roberts," said the captain, smiling. " I 

can't afford to have one of my most promising young officers 

krissed." 

" All soft soap and flam," said Bob to himself, as he went out 

on deck. " Promising officer, indeed. Well, he's a promising 

officer, and I'll keep him to his promise, too ; and old Ali, and 

Tom, and I will have another day to ourselves." 



CHAPTER XXXIL 



HOW MR LINTON BELIEVED IN A PRECIPICE. 

It was a grand sight, and a stranger to the scene might have 
imagined that a little army was about to set off for the conquest 
of some petty king, instead of to attack the striped tiger in his 
stronghold. 

The two parties from the steamer and the island were ashore 
before daybreak, to find an imposing gathering of the sultan's 
people coming down to meet them. There were over thirty 
elephants, large and small, with their attendants, and the beasts 
were furnished with showy cloths under their rattan basket 
liowdahs. 

The sultan was there in English dress ; and his chiefs made 
a gaudy muster, wearing showy silken sarongs and bajus, as if it 
were to be a review day instead of a hunting trip, while the fol- 
lowing, to the extent of several hundreds, were all armed with 
spear and kris. Here and there a showily clad Malay was seen 
to be armed with a gun or rifle, but for the most part their means 
of offence were confined to the native weapons. 

The meeting was most cordial; but the sultan and his fol- 
lowers seemed somewhat taken aback to see the various officers 
in rough sporting costume, and the soldiers and sailors in any- 
thing but stiff, ordinary trim. 

One thing, however, had been rigidly adhered to. Every man 
was well-armed, and carried a good supply of ball cartridge. 

The sun was shining brightly, when at last the hunting party 
was duly marshalled, and moved off right through the jungle by 
a well-beaten path, one which took them straight away from the 
river ; and very effective the procession looked, with the great 
lumbering elephants moving so silently along, the gaily-dressed 
Malays forming bright patches of colour amidst the clean white 
duck frocks and trousers of the sailors, and the dull grey of the 
soldiers' linen tunics. There was, of course, fraternization, and 
a disposition on the part of the Malays to freely mix with the 




Englishmen then ; but the order had been that a certain amount 
of formation was to be maintained, so that, if necessary, the 
men might be ready to gather at any time round their officers. 
Not that any difficulty was apprehended, but it was felt to be 
better to keep up discipline, even when only engaged upon a 
shooting trip, though every act that might be interpreted by the 
Malays into a want of confidence was carefully avoided. 

The morning was sufficiently young as yet to enable a good 
march to be made without difficulty ; but as the sun began to 
make his power felt wherever there was an opening amidst the 
trees, a halt was called in a beautiful park-like patch of ground, 
with huge spreading trees sufficient to shelter double their 
number. Here a capital lunch was served by the sultan's 
cooks, one that no doubt an English c^ief would have looked 
upon with contempt, but which, after a long morning tramp 
through the steaming heat of the jungle, was delightful. 

Every one was in excellent spirits, the sultan having set 
aside a great deal of his formality, and smiling apparently with 
pleasure as he gazed around at the gratified countenances of his 
guests. 

Then followed a siesta while the sun was at its greatest 
height, Doctor Bolter impressing upon all the officers that a 
quiet rest during the heat of the day was the one thing needful 
to make them bear the exertion of the journey; and then, as soon 
as he saw every one following his advice, he arranged his pug- 
garee around his pith helmet, put some cartridges in his 
pocket, and went off into the jungle to shoot specimens, with 
no little success. 

Ten miles were got over that evening, and then camp was 
pitched on the edge of an opening, close by a curious rounded 
mountain, which towered up in front of the setting sun, looking 
massive and grand with its smooth outline thrown up, as it were, 
against the saffron sky. 

The scene was lovely in the extreme, and every touch given by 
the hunting party seemed to add thereto, for white tents sprang 
up like magic against the dark green foliage ; fires began to 
twinkle here and there ; the large mess tent, that had been 
carried by one of the elephants, was well lit with lamps ; and 
a white cloth spread with ample provisions and no few luxuries, 
ornamented by the freshly-cut flowers which grew in profusion, 
as if waiting to be cut by the servants, added no little to the 
brightness of the interior. 

Outside all was apparently picturesque confusion, though in 
reality everything was in due order, from the men's tents to the 




ranging ot the elephants, who, relieved ot their loads, were 
quietly lifting up great bunches of grass and tucking them into 
their capacious jaws. Over all rose a loud hum of many voices, 
and soon to this was added the click of knives and forks from 
the English mess and the rattle of plates. Amongst the Malays 
great leaves did duty for the latter, and all was quieter. 

Later on, watch was set, the sxiltan and his officers smiling 
gravely at the precautions taken by the English, assuming 
though that it was against the wild beasts of the jungle, and 
hastening to assure all concerned that they need have no fear, 
for no tiger would approach so busy a camp, especially as there 
were fires burning, which would be kept up all night 

" Let them think it's the tigers, and that we are afraid of 
them, if they like," said the doctor ; " but I wouldn't slacken dis- 
cipline in the slightest degree. Keep everything going just as if 
we were going through an enemy's country." 

" I support that motion,** said the resident quietly. 

" But why ? " said Captzun Horton, ** Surely we may relax a 

little now." 

" No, Doctor Bolter is right," said the major, nodding. "It's 

a nuisance, Horton, of course, but you would not let your ship go 

without a good watch being set ? " 

" Well ¡ª no," said the captain thoughtfully, " I suppose not. 
We should keep that up even if we were in dock. Thank good- 
ness, though, I liave not any watch to keep to-night, for I'm tired 
as a dog." 

" It has been a tiring day," said Major Sandars, " I wonder 
how Smithers is getting on. I hope he's taking care of the 
ladies." 

" Yes," said Mr Linton gravely, " I hope he is taking care of 
the ladies." 

" They're in good hands," said Captain Horton. " Johnson is 
a stemish fellow, and," he added laughing, " if anv dangerous 
parties go near the island, Mr Midshipman Roberts will blow 
them right out of the water." 

"Yes," said Major Sandars, indulging in a low chuckle, "he 
and Mr Ensign Long between them would be a match for all the 
rajahs on the river." 

Mr Linton was the only one who did not smile, for just then, 
like a foreboding cloud, the dark thought came across his mind 
that it would be very, very terrible if advantage were taken by 
the Malays of the absence of so large a portion of the force ; and 
try how he would to sleep that night, the thought kept intruding, 
that after all they were doing wrong in trusting themselves with 




the Malay sultan, who might, under his assumption of hospitality, 
be hatching some nefarious scheme against them all. 

Through the thin canvas walls of the tent he could hear the low 
breathing of some of his friends, the snort of some elephant, and 
close by him there was the monotonous hum of the mosquitoes, 
trying hard to find a way through the fine gauze of the net ; now 
and then came too an impatient muttering of a sleeper, or the 
distant cry of some creature in the jungle. 

The only solacing thing he heard in the heat of those weary 
sleepless hours was the steady beat of some sentry's pace, and 
the click of his arms as he changed his piece from shoulder to 
shoulder. 

He was the only unquiet one, for the others fell asleep almost 
on the instant, and several of them gave loud signs of their 
peaceful occupation. 

At last Mr Linton could bear it no longer, and rising, he went 
softly to the tent door and peeped out, to pause there, wondering 
at the beauty of the scene, as the moon was just peering down 
over the jungle trees, and filling the camp with silvery light and 
black shadows. What was that glint of some arm ? 

He smiled at his uneasiness directly after, for there was the 
sharp steady beat of feet, a sergeant's guard came out of the 
black shadow, and he saw them relieve sentry, the glint he had 
seen being the moonbeams playing upon tke soldier's piece. 

He went back and lay down once more, feeling relieved, and 
falling off into a restful sleep, little thinking how that deadly peril 
was indeed hovering round the island he had left, and that he 
and his companions were going to march on and on, not to 
encounter tigers alone, but men even more cruel in their nature, 
and quite as free from remorse when dealing with those^whom 
they looked upon as dogs. 



CHAPTER XXXIII. 



PRIVATE GRAY HAS HIS ORDERS. 



The men on the corvette, with those who rowed back the empty 
boats, gave a loud cheer, which was answered from the island, as 
the hunting party moved off in procession. 

" Give them another, my lads," cried Bob Roberts excitedly ; 
and the sailors, with whom he was a special favourite, responded 
heartily. 

"Just another, my lads, to show them we are not a bit 
envious," cried Bob; and then another prolonged "Hurrah!" 
went up in the morning skies, the middy shouting with the best 
of them ; and it was amusing to see Bob's calm, consequential 
ways as he stood there, completely ignoring Lieutenant Johnson, 
and taking upon himself the full command of the ship. 

He glanced up aloft, and his look threatened an order to man 
the yards, when the lieutenant interfered. 

** I think that will do, Mr Roberts," he said quietly, and Bob 
was taken rather aback. 

** Yes, of course, sir," he said, " but the men are already loaded 
with a cheer, hadn't they better let it off? " 

lieutenant Johnson gazed full in the lad*s face, half sternly, half 
amused at his quaint idea, and then nodded. Then there was 
another stentorian cheer, and what seemed like its echo from the 
island, when Bob smiled his satisfaction, strutting about the 
quarter-deck as he exclaimed, ¡ª 

" We can beat the soldiers hollow at cheering, sir, can't we ? " 

" Yes, Mr Roberts," said the lieutenant quietly ; and then to 
the warrant officer near him, " Pipe down to breakfast, Mr Law ; 
the men must want it" 

" I know one man who wants his," said Bob, half aloud ; and 
then he stared wistfully after the tail of the departing expedition, 
as the sun glinted on the spears, and a very dismal sensation of 
disappointment came over him. 



^You'll make a good officer some day, Roberts/' said the 
lieutenant, and Bob started, for he did not know he was so near. 

"Thank you, sir ¡ª for the compHment," said Bob. 

" But at present, my lad, you do imitate the bantam cock to 
such an extent that it irritates grown men." 

" Do I, sir ? " said Bob. 

*' You do indeed, my lad," said the lieutenant kindly. 

" But I don't want to, sir, for nothing worries me more than 
to see Ensign Long coming all that strut and show off." 

" Well, we won't quarrel about it, Roberts," said Lieutenant 
Johnson kindly. " You'll grow out of it in time. As it is, I'm 
captain for a few days, and you are my first lieutenant. So first 
lieutenant," he continued, clapping the lad on the shoulder, 
" come down and breakfast with me in the cabin, and we'll talk 
matters over." 

Bob flushed with pleasure, and if the lieutenant had asked 
him to jump overboard just then, 01 stand on his head on the 
main truck. Bob would have tried to oblige him. 

As it was, however, he followed his officer into the cabin, and 
made a hearty breakfast 

" I tell you what," said the lieutenant, who was a very quiet 
stem young officer ¡ª and he stopped short 

" Yes, captain," said Bob. 

Lieutenant Johnson smiled. 

" I tell you what," he said again, " nothing would give me 
greater pleasure than for Mr Rajah Gantang to bring down his 
prahus some time to-day, Lieutenant Roberts. I could blow that 
fellow out of the water with the greatest pleasure in life." 

" Captain Johnson," said Bob, solemnly, " I could blow him 
in again with greater pleasure, for I haven*t forgotten my swim 
for hfe." 

" You feel quite a spite against him then, Roberts ? " 

** Spite's nothing to it," said Bob. " Didn't he and his people 
force me, a harmless, unoffending young fellow ¡ª " 

" As ever contrived to board a prahu," said the lieutenant. 

"Ah, well, that wasn't my doing," said Bob. " I was ordered 
to do my duty, and tried to do it. That was no reason why 
those chicory-brown rascals should cause me to be pitched into 
the river to the tender mercies of the crocodiles, who, I believe, 
shed tears because they couldn't catch me." 

" Well, Roberts," said the lieutenant, " you need not make 
yourself uncomfortable, nor set up the bantam cock hackles round 
your neck, and you need not go to the grindstone to sharpen your 
spurs, for we shall not have the luck to see anything of the rajah, 



who by this time knows that it is his best policy to keep out of 
the way. Will you take any more breakfast ? " 

"¡ö No, thank you, sir," said Bob, rising, for this was a hint to go 
about his business ; and he went on deck. 

" Momin*, sir," said old Dick, pulling at his forelock, and 
giving one leg a kick out behind. 

" Morning, Dick. Don't you wish you were along with the 
hunting party ? " 

Old Dick walked to the side, sprinkled the water with a little 
tobacco juice, and came back. 

" That's the same colour as them Malay chaps, sir," he said, 
" nasty dirty beggars." 

" Dirty, Dick ? Why they are always bathing and swimming." 

" Yes," said Dick in a tone of disgust, " but they never use no 
soap." 

" Well, what of that ? " said Bob " You don't suppose that 
makes any difference? " 

*' Makes no difference ? " said the old sailor ; " why it makes all 
the difference, sir. When I was a young 'un, my old mother used 
to lather the yalier soap over my young head till it looked like 
a yeast tub in a baker's cellar. Lor' a mussy ! the way she used 
to shove the soap in my eyes and ears and work her fingers 
round in 'em, was a startler. She*d wash, and scrub, and rasp 
away, and then swab me dry with a rough towel ¡ª and it was a 
rough 'un, mind yer ¡ª till I shone again. Why, I was as white as 
a lily where I wasn't pink ; and a young lady as come to stay at 

the squire's, down in our parts, blessed if she didn't put me in a 
picter she was painting, and call me a village beauty. It's the 
soap as does it, and a rale love of cleanliness. Bah, look at 'em ! 
They're just about the colour o' gingerbread ; while look at me !" 

Bob look at the old fellow searchingly, to see if he was joking, 
and then finding that he was perfectly sincere, the middy burst 
into a hearty roar of laughter. 

For long years of exposure to sun and storm had burned and 
stained Dick into a mahogany brown, warmed up with red of the 
richest crimson. In fact, a Malay had rather the advantage of 
him in point of colour. 

** Ah, you may laugh," he growled. " I dessay, sir, you thinks 
it's werry funny ; but if you was to go and well soap a young 
Malay he*d come precious different, I can tell you.*' 

"But somebody did try to wash a blackamoor white," said 
Bob. "Tom Hood says so, in one of his books." 

" Well, and did they get him white, sir ? " asked Dick. 

" No, I think not," said Bob. " I almost forget, but I think 
lliey gave him such a bad cold that he died." 



'* That Tom Hood ¡ª was he any relation o' Admiral Hood, 
sir ? " 

"No, I think not, Dick." 

** Then he wasn't much account being a landsman, I s'ppse, 
and he didn't understand what he was about. He didn't use 
plenty o' soap." 

*^ Oh yes, he did, Dick j because I remember he says, a lady 
gave some: 

"Mrs Hope, 
A bar of soap." 

" Then they didn't lather it well," said Dick decisively. " And 
it shows how ignorant they was when they let's the poor chap 
ketch cold arter it, and die. Why, bless your 'art, Mr Roberts, 
sir^ if my old mother had had the job, he'd have had no cold. 
He'd have come out red hot, ail of a glow, like as I used, and 
as white as a lily, or she'd have had all his skin off him." 

" And so you really believe you could wash these Malay chaps 
white ? " 

" I do, sir. I'd holystone *em till they was." 

" It would be a long job, Dick," said Bob laughing. " But I 
say, don't you wish you had gone with the hunting party ? " 

" Yah ! " said Dick, assuming a look of great disgust and con- 
tempt, although he had been growling and acting, as his mates 
said, like a bear with a sore head, because he could not go. 
" Not I, sir, not I. Why, what have they gone to do ? Shoot a 
big cat all brown stripes. I don't want to spend my time ketch- 
ing cats. What's the good on 'em when they've got 'em ? Only 
to take their skins. Now there is some sense in a bit of fishing." 

" Especially when your crew in the boat goes to sleep, and 
let's you be surprised by the Malays." 

"Ah, but don't you see, sir," said Dick, with his eyes twink- 
ling, " that's a kind o' moral lesson for a young officer ? Here 
was the case you see : the skipper goes to sleep, and don't look 
after his crew, who, nat'rally enough, thinks what the skipper 
does must be right, and they does the same." 

" Oh ! all right, master Dick," said the middy. " I'll take the 
lesson to heart. Don't you ever let me catch you asleep, that's all" 

" No, sir," said the old sailor, grinning, *' I won't. IVe got 
too much of the weasel in me. But as I was saying, sir, there's 
some sense in a bit o' fishing, and I thought if so be you liked 
I'd get the lines ready." 

" No, Dick, no," said Bob, firmly as he recalled Lieutenant 
Johnson's words over the breakfast-table. " I've no time for 
fishing to-dav. And besides, I'm in charge of the ship." 




" Oh I indeed, sir," said Dick. " I beg pardon, sir." 

"Look here, Dick," said Bob sharply, "don't you sneer at 
your officer because he makes free with you sometimes." 

The middy turned and walked off, leaving Dick cutting him- 
self a fresh plug of tobacco. 

" He'll make a smart 'un by-and-by, that he will," muttered the 
old fellow, nodding his head admiringly ; " and I'm sorry I said 
what I did to the high-sperretted little chap, for he's made of the 
real stuff, after all." 

On the island, Tom Long was feeling quite as important as 
the middy. A keen sense of disappointment was troubling him, 
but he would not show it. He had several times over been 
looking at his gun, and thinking that it would carry a bullet as 
well as a rifle, and wishing that he could have game to try it. 
But soon afterwards he encountered pleasant Mrs Major 
Sanders, 

" Ah I Mr Long," she cried, " IVe just been seeing Miss 
Linton and Miss Sinclair. Now you know you have these 
deserted ladies and the whole of the women under your charge, 
and I hope you'll protect us." 

** I shall do my utmost, madam," said Tom Long importantly. 
'* You ladies needn't be under the smallest apprehension, for 
you will be as safe as if the major and Mr Linton were here." 

" I shall tell Miss Linton so," said Mrs Major, smiling ; and 
she nodded and went away, leaving the young ensign uncomfort- 
able, as he felt a kind of suspicion that he had been speaking 
very consequentially, and making himself absurd. 

'* I wish I was either a man or a boy," he said to himself 
pettishly. " I feel just like a man, and yet people will treat 
me as if I were a boy. That Mrs Major was only talking to me 
patronizingly, and half-laughing at me, I can see it now. Oh ! 
here's Smithers," 

Captain Smithers came up, looking rather careworn and sad, 
and nodded in a friendly way at his junior. 

*' Well, Long," he said, " so we are commanders-in-chief just 
now. At least, I am. You'll have to be my colonel, major, and 
adjutant, all in one." 

" I shall do my best to help you. Captain Smithers," said 
Tom Long stiffly. 

'* I know you will, my lad," was the reply ; " but it will be no 
child's play, for we must be extra strict and watchfuL" 

" Do you think there is anything to fear, Captain Smithers,** 
said the ensign eagerly. 

" To fear ? No, Mr Long," said the captain. " We are 




English officers, and, as such, never mention such a thing ; but 

there is a good deal to be anxious about ¡ª I mean the sdety of 

aU here." 

** But you have no suspicion, sir ¡ª of danger ? " 

" Not the sh'ghtest Still we will be as careful as if I felt sure 
that an enemy was close at hand." 

There was something about that we that was very pleasam 
to the young ensign ; and his heart warmed like a flower in 
sunshine. 

** Of course, sir," he said eagerly. " I'll do the best I can." 

*' Thank you, Long, I am sure you will," said Captain 
Smithers. " By the way, you know, of course, that the ladies 
are coming to stay with Mrs Major, so that there will not be 
much cause for anxiety about the residency. Suppose we now 
take a quiet look round together; there is really no necessity, 
but we will go as a matter of duty." 

Tom Long's self-esteem was flattered, the more especially as 
he could see that Captain Smithers was perfectly sincere, and 
looked to him, in all confidence, for aid in a time when a great 
responsibility was thrown upon his shoulders. 

** If I don't let him see that I can act like a man, my name's 
not Long," he muttered to himself, as they walked on together. 

" There's only ¡ª " 

Captain Smithers, who w^as speaking, stopped short, and the 
ensign stared. 

"I do not want to offend you, Long," he said, "but all I 
say to you is in strict confidence now, and you must be careful 

what you repeat." 

" You may trust me, Captain Smithers," said the ensign quietly. 

** Yes, I am sure I may," was the reply. ** Look here, then. 
I was going to say that the only weak point in our arrangements 
here seems to be that ! " 

He nodded his head in the direction in which they were 
going, and the ensign stared. 

*' I mean about allowing that Malay, Abdullah, to set up his 
tent among us. He has such freedom of communicating with 
the banks of the river on both sides. He is a man, too, whom I 
rather distrust" 

*' Indeed?" said Long. 

" Yes, I don't know why. But unless for some good and 
sufficient reason it would, I think, be bad policy to attempt to 
oust him." 

** Yes," calmly said Long. "He is a violent fellow, too;" 
and he related the incident about their first meeting. 




" If the major had known of this," said Captain Smithers, 
" he would never have allowed the man to settle here. You did 
wrong in not speaking of it, Long." 

" He was so apologetic and gentlemanly afterwards/' said the 
ensign, " that I did not care to speak about it, and upset the 
fellow's plans." 

" Well, it is too late to talk about it now,** replied Captain 
Smithers ; " but I shall have his actions quietly watched. Let 
me see, who will be the man ? " 

** There's Private Gray yonder," suggested the ensign. 

" I hate Private Gray 1 " exclaimed Captain Smithers, with a 
sudden burst of rage, of which he seemed to be ashamed the 
next moment, for he said hastily, ¡ª 

*' It is a foolish antipathy, for Gray is a good, staunch man;" 
and making an effort to master himself, he made a sign to Gray 
to come to them. 

" You are right, Long ; Gray is the mam He is to be 
trusted." 

The private came up, and stiffly saluted his officers, standing 
at attention, 

*'Gray," said Captain Smithers, " I want you to undertake a 
little task for me." 

" Yes, sir," 

** You will be off regular duty ; another man will take your 

place. I want you, in a quiet, unostentatious manner, to keep an 
eye on Abdullah the fruit-seller. Don't let him suspect that you 
are watching him, for really there may be no cause ; but he 
is the only native here who has free access to the island, and 
during the major's absence I wish to be especially strict" 

" Yes, sir." 

" You understand me ? I trust entirely to your good sense 
and discrimination. You will do what you have to do in a quiet 
way, and report everything ¡ª even to the least suspicious pro- 
ceeding ¡ª to me," 

" Yes, sir." 

" You shall be furnished with a permit, to pass you anywhere, 
and at all times." 

** Thank you, sir." 

" I'd go in undress uniform, and apparently without arms, but 
have a bayonet and a revolver under your jacket." 

" Do you think there is danger, sir ? " exclaimed the private 
hastily, forgetting himself for the moment. 

" Private Gray, you have your orders." 

Gray drew himself up stiffly and saluted. 





'* Begin at once, sir?" 

" At once/' said Captain Smithers. " I trust to your silence. 
No one but Mr Long knows of your mission." 

Gray saluted again and went off, while the two officers con- 
tinued their walk towards Dullah^s hut. 

The Malay came out as they approached, and with a depre- 
cating gesture invited them to take a seat beneath his verandah 
and partake of fruit. 

This, however, they declined to do, contenting themselves 
with returning his salute, and passing on. 

There were two sampans moored close to Dullah's hut, each 
holding four Malays, but the boats themselves were filled with 
produce piled high, and the owners were evidently waiting to 
have dealings with their superior, the man who had been ap- 
pointed to supply the English garrison of the island and the ship. 

There was nothing suspicious to be seen here, neither did 
anything attract their attention as they continued their walk right 
round the island, everything being as calm and still as the sleepy 
shore which lay baking beneath the ardent rays of the sun, while 
the various houses looked comparatively cool beneath the shade 
of the palms and durian trees with here and there a great 
ragged-leaved banana showing a huge bunch of its strange fruit. 

Tired and hot, they were glad to return to their quarters, 
where Sergeant Lund was writing out a report, and occasionally 
frowning at Private Sim, who was lying under a tree fast asleep. 



CHAPTER XXXIV. 

A HOT NIGHT ON BOARD THE "STARTLER." 

The young officers were pretty busy over their duties throughout 
the day, Bob Roberts to his great delight being left in sole 
charge of the steamer, while Lieutenant Johnson went to have a 
short consultation with Captain Smithers ; and two hours later, 
when Captain Smithers accompanied the naval officer back, 
Ensign Long was in full command at the island. 

The hot and sleep -inviting day had rolled slowly by ; never 
had the river looked brighter and clearer, or more keenly re- 
flected the rays of the sun. Far down in its pure depths the 
middy had watched the darting about of the fish, which seemed 
to seek the shadow beneath the steamer's hull for theirplayground. 

This was noticed at stolen moments, for Bob was generally too 
full of his duties to think of the fish, or to do more than cast a 
longing glance at the dark shadows beneath the trees. For on 
board the heat was terrible, the pitch was oozing out of the 
seams, and blistering the paint ; every piece of tarry cordage was 
soft and pliant, and very beads stood out upon the strands ; 
while beneath the awnings there was a stuffy suffocating heat that 
was next to unbearable. 

On the island the heat was less hard to be borne, the thick 
grove of palms and other trees whose roots were always moist, 
throwing out a grateful shade. Still the heat was severely felt, 
and the general impression was that the hunting-party had by far 

the worst of it. 

The day ghded by, and the sultry tropic night set in, with the 
great mellow stars glistening overhead reflected in the clear 
stream, and seeming to be repeated in the low undergrowth that 
fringed the shore. The watches were set, every precaution taken 
against surprise, and though no danger need be apprehended, 
Captain Smithers had the little fort quite ready to resist attack. 

It was the same on board the steamer, the watch being visited 
at frequent intervals by the lieutenant and his subordinate, to the 



great surprise of the men, who wondered what made the "luff" 
so fidgety. 

That night passed off without anything to disturb them \ and 
the next day all was so dull and uniform that Bob Roberts, as 
he could not go ashore, was fain to amuse himself with his 
monkey, which he fed till it could eat no more, and then teased 
till it got into a passion, snapped at him, and took refuge in the 
rigging till its master's back was turned, when, to the great de- 
light of the men, it leaped down on the middy's shoulder, and 
there seized the back of his jacket-collar and shook it vigorously, 
till seeing its opportunity it once more leaped up into the rigging, 
chattering fiercely, and showing its teeth as Bob threatened it 
and called it names. 

Evening came on again, not too hot, but quite bad enough to 
make the middy glad to walk the deck in the loosest jacket he 
possessed. The watch had been set, the lights hung up, and all 
was very still ; for having had but little sleep the night before, 
Bob was too tired to talk, and now sat in the coollest place he 
could find, hitting out occasionally at a mosquito, and alternating 
that exercise with petting the monkey, which had made its sub- 
mission by creeping down from the rigging at dinner-time, and 
approaching its master in a depressed mournful way, as if declar- 
ing its sorrow for its late sin, and readiness to do anything, if its 
master would forgive it. In fact, when the middy rose as if to 
beat it, the animal lay down on the deck, grovelling and whining 
piteously, as it watched his actions with one eye, that said as 
plainly as could be, " You don't mean it I'm such a little thing 
that you would not hurt me." 

Bob did not hurt it, but gave it one of Dullah's mangosteens 
instead, and peace was made. 

Lieutenant Johnson joined the middy soon after he had given 
up seeking a nap on account of the heat, and came and leaned 
over the bulwark by his side, talking to him in a low voice, both 
feeling depressed and subdued. 

'*I wonder how our party is getting on?" said the lieutenant 

at last. "They'll have a storm to-night, and soaked tents." 
**Yes; there's a flash," exclaimed Bob, as the distant forest 

seemed to be lit up to its very dfepths by a quivering blaze of 

sheet lightning, 

This was repeated, and with increased vividness, the pale 

blue light playing about in the horizon, and displaying the 

shapes of the great heavy clouds that overhung the mountains 

in the east 

*' It's very beautiful to watch," said the lieutenant ; *'but 

suppose we take a walk forward." 




They strolled along the deck, and on going right to the bows 
found the watch every man in his place ; and returning aft spoke 
to the marine, who stood like a statue leaning upon his piece. 

They sat down again, feeling no inclination to seek the cabin ; 
and this feeling seemed to be shared by the men, who were 
sitting about, talking in low whispers, and watching the distant 
flashing lightning, whose lambent sheets seemed now to be play- 
ing incessantly, 

** Is there anything the matter with you, sir ? " said Bob at 
last. 

" No, Roberts, only that I feel so restless and imsettled that 
I should like to jump overboard for a cool swim." 

"That's just what I feel, sir," said Bob, "with a dash ot 
monkey in it." 

" A dash of monkey ! " 

" Yes, sir ; as if I must run and jump about, or climb, or do 
something. It's the fidgets with this heat. Let's walk forward 
again, if you don't mind. I think it's cooler there." 

"Cooler, Roberts ? It seems to me as if the deck is thoroughly 
hot, and as if ones clothes were baking. I quite envy the lads, 
with their bare feet and open necks." 

They strolled forward again, with the monkey softly following 
them j and when they stood leaning over the bulwarks, listening 
to the ripple of the water under the vessel's stem, the animal 
perched itself on one of the stays just above their heads. 

They could almost have fancied they were at sea, gazing down 
at the phosphorescent water, so beautiful was the reflection of 
the stars in the smooth, dark current, as it glided swiftly along, 
rippling a little about the large buoy to which they were moored, 
and breaking the stars up, as it were, into a thousand tiny points, 

that divided into a double current and swept by the steamer's 
bows. 

*' What a night for a couple of prahus to come down and 
board us, sir !" said Bob. 

" Rather unlucky for them, if they did," said the lieutenant 
quietly. "One good shot at them, or one of our biggest shells 
dropped into their hold, would crash through, and send them to 
the bottom. There's no such luck, Roberts." 

** I suppose not, sir," said Bob ; but, all the same, he could 
not help feeling that this was a kind of luck which he could very 
well dispense with on a dark night He did not venture to say 
so, though. 

*' How quiet they seem on the island ! " said the lieutenant at 
last. " Heigh-ho ! ha hum ! I wish we were there, Roberts, 




along with the ladies ; a cup of tea and a little pleasant chat 
would be very agreeable." 

"And some music," said Bob. 

'* And some music," said the lieutenant. " What^s the matter 
with your monkey ? " 

"What's the matter, Charcoal?" said Bob; for the little 
animal had suddenly grown excited, chattering, and changing its 
place, coming down the stay, and then leaping on to the bulwark. 

" He sees something in the water," said the lieutenant. 

'* Crocodile," said Bob ; " they like monkey. Look out, 
Charcoal, or you'll be overboard." 

This was on dimly seeing the monkey run along the bulwark, 
chattering excitedly. 

" Help I " came in a hoarse tone from somewhere ahead. 

" There's a man overboard," cried the lieutenant. " Pass the 
word there. Lower down the gig." 

There was the sharp pipe of a whistle, and a scuffling of feet, 
for the hail had electrified the men ; but meanwhile the cry was 

repeated. 

" It's some one from the island swimming down to us," said the 
lieutenant. ** Hold on, my lad," he cried, as the cry was re- 
peated nearer and nearer, and then just ahead. 

" Quick, sir," cried Bob, " he's holding on by the hawser, 
whoever he is;" and fully satisfied in his own mind that one of 
the soldiers had been bathing, and had been swept down by the 
current, he called out to the swimmer to hold on, but only to 
hear once more the one hoarse cry, " Help ! " and with it a 
gurgling noise where the bright stars were broken up into a forked 
stream of tiny points. 

So eager was he to cry out to the drowning man that help was 

coming, that he missed the chance of going himself, but leaned 
over the bows as the captain's gig, manned with a ready little 
crew, kissed the water, was unhooked, and ran swiftly along 

the side ; then the oars splashed, and the little, light boat was 

rapidly rowed to where the great hawser was made fast. 

It was so dark that Bob could only dimly make out the round 
buoy, towards which the gig passed over the water like a shadow. 

" Can you see him ? " cried the lieutenant, who was once more 
by Bob Roberts' side. 

" No, sir; there's no one here," said the bow-man. 

" Help ! help 1 " came in a hoarse whisper just then, exactly 
below where the two officers leaned over ; and they saw that a 
dark face that had risen to the surface was being swept quickly 
along by the steamer's side. 



" Quick, my lads, here he is 1 Stem all ! " cried the lieutenant ; 
and the light gig was backed rapidly in quest of the drowning 
man ; while Bob ran aft as hard as he could go, and climbed 
out into the mizzen chains, to stare down into the swift current, 
holding on by one hand. 

But he could see nothing, and he was beginning, with throb- 
bing heart, to believe that he was too late ¡ª that the wretched 
man had been swept away before he climbed over, when he 
caught sight of something just below the surface. 

" Here, boat, quick ! " he cried ; and the bow-man struck his 
hook into the side, and sent the gig flying through the water. 

" Where, sir ? where ? " cried he in the hoarse voice of Dick. 

*' There, just below there ; I saw him." 

For answer Dick leaned over the gig's bows, and thrust 
down his boat-hook. 

*' Give way, my lads," he cried, and again and again he 
thrust down his hook. Then a strange, choking feeling of 
horror seemed to seize upon the middy, and he felt dizzy as 
he gazed after the boat in the midst of that weird darkness, 
which made the event ten times more terrible than if it had 
been by day. 

Just as his heart sank with dread, and he in fancy saw the 
dead body seized by one or other of the terrible reptiles that 
swarmed in the river, wondering the while which of the poor 
men it was, and why they had heard no alarm at the island, Dick's 
hoarse voice was heard some distance astern, exclaiming in 
triumph, ¡ª 

" I've got him, my lads ! Give way 1" 



CHAPTER XXXV. 



HOW ALI MADE HIS PLANS. 

There is a strange kind oi" stoicism about a Mohammedan that 
seems to give him an abundance of calmness when he comes 
face to face with death. He is a fatalist, and quietly says to 
himself what is to be will be, and he resigns himself to his fate. 

The young chief Ali was imbued with all the doctrines of his 
people ; but at the same time he had mixed so with the English 
that he had learned to look upon life as of too much value to 
be given up without a desperate struggle. One of his com- 
patriots would have made a fight for his life, and when he 
had seen all go against him he would have given up without a 
murmur and looked his slayers indifferently in the face. Ali, 
however, did not intend to give up without another effort, and 
though he seemed indifferent, a terrible struggle was going on 
within his breast. Thoughts of his father, of his new friends, of 
the bright sunshine of youth, and the future that had been so full 
of hope, and in which he had meant to do so much to improve 
his country ¡ª all rose before his wandering eyes, and he had 
meant to seize the first opportunity to escape. 

The approach of the kris-armed Malay, though, had been so 
sudden that all his calculations had been upset, and he had 
had no time to design a means of escape. He was tightly bound, 
held by two others, and this man was evidently under orders 
firom the sultan to slay him. 

It was useless to struggle, he knew ¡ª ^just as vain to waste his 
strength, and rob himself of his calmness ; so that he felt bound 
to call up all his fortitude, and with it the fatalistic theories of 
his race, so that he might die as behoved the son of a great 

chief. 

He drew himself up then, and stood gazing at the man with 
the kris as calm and motionless as if he had been made of bronze, 
and awaited the deadly stroke. 

Xhi*5, however, did not come; for in place of delivering a 





deadly thrust, the Malay roughly seized him by the shoulder, and 
began to saw away through the prisoner's bonds. 

He was so firmly secured that this process took some time, 
during which Ali, by the strange revulsion that came upon him, 
felt as if he must fall prone upon his face from sheer giddiness ; 
but by an effort he stood firm till his limbs were set free. 

His wrists were painfully marked, and his arms felt numb and 
helpless, but his first thought, as soon as the ligatures that had 
held him were off, was how to escape. 

His captors read this and smiled, each man drawing his kris 
and showing it menacingly, while their leader told him that he 
was a prisoner until the sultan's wishes were known. 

"Are you not going to kill me ? " said Ali passionately. 

" Not yet," was the reply, "unless you try to escape, when we 
are to kill you like a dog, and throw you into the river." 

" But why ? " asked Ali ; " what have I done ? " 

" I know nothing," was the surly reply. 

" Does my father know of this ? " cried AIL 

" I know nothing," said the Malay. 

" But you will tell me what your instructions are, and where 
you are going to place me." 

" I know nothing. I tell nothing," said the Malay. " Be 
silent. That is your prison. If you try to escape, you die." 

Ali burned to ask more questions, but he felt that it would be 
useless, and that he, a chiefs son, was only losing dignity by 
talking to the man, whom he recognized now as being the sultan's 
most unscrupulous follower, the scoundrel who did any piece of 
dirty work or atrocity. This was the man who, at his master's 
wish, dragged away any poor girl from her home to be the 
sultan's slave ; who seized without scruple on gold, tin, rice, or 
any other produce of the country, in his master's name, and for 
his use. His hands had been often enough stained with blood, 
and while wondering at his life being spared so far, Ali had no 
hesitation in believing that any attempt at escape would be 
ruthlessly punislied by a stab with the kris. 

Obeying his captors, then, Ali went into the inner room of the 
ruined house, and seated himself wearily upon the floor, thinking 
the while of the hunting expedition, and of the light in which his 
conduct would be viewed by his friends. 

Then he wondered whether his father would send in search of 
him ; but his heart sark as he felt that, in all probability, the 
Tumongong would be carefully watched by the sultan's orders, 
and that any movement upon his son's behalf would result in his 
own death. 



Then he began to feel that, if he was to escape, it must be 
through his own efforts ; for he had so little faith in Hamet's 
nature, that he knew that his existence trembled upon a hair. 

He was in an inner room of the house, little better in fact than 
R bamboo cage. The place was old, but he could see that here 
and there his prison had been mended with new green bamboos, 
especially about the flooring, through which he could see down 
to the earth, some twelve feet below, the sunlight shining up 
between the short bamboos, just as a few gleams of sunshine 
came through the attap roof. 

There had been a window, but this had been filled in with 
stout bamboo cross-pieces, through and between which were 
woven long lengths of rattan ; but the weak places had been 
made strong, and from old experience he knew that, unless armed 
with a heavy knife, it would be impossible to force a way through 
tlxe tough wall of bamboo and woven cane. 

The place was very gloomy, from the closing of the window ; 
?nd as he glanced round he could see that his guards had been 
joined by half-a-dozen more, and that they were making them- 
selves comfortable in the outer place, but in such a position that 
tbey could command a full view of his room. 

Judging from appearances, they were preparing for a length- 
ened stay, for some of them were arranging cooking utensils ; 
others placing pieces of dammar, a sort of fossil gum, of a pale 
blue tint, and very inflammable, ready for lighting up the part of 

the house where they were assembled. 

After a time one of the number made ready the meal, foi which 
his companions seemed to be impatiently waiting ; and first of 
all a portion, consisting of broiled fish, some fruit, and sago, was 
brought to the prisoner, who, before partaking thereof, was 
rigorously searched, to see if he still bore any arms about his 
person. Satisfied upon this point, the Malays left him with his 
food, and proceeded to feast themselves, after which some began 
smoking, and some betel chewing. 

It was evident to Ali that he was to be kept a close prisoner ; 
and as he lay there upon the bamboo floor, with his untouched 
food before him, he began to think out his position, and to 
calculate as to the possibility of escape. 

How was it to be done? 

His guards were so watchful that his slightest movements drew 
two or three pairs of eyes upon him, and he knew of old how 

quick they were of hearing. He felt assured that they would 
take it in turns to sleep, and hence he would have no oppor- 
tunity of eluding their vigilance. Still he was hopeful, for there 




is an elasticity in the mind of youth which some things dash, 
when the spirit of middle or old age would be broken. 

If he stayed where he was, sooner or later he felt sure that 
Hamet would be weary of the trouble he caused, and give orders 
for his death. So escape he must. But why should Hamet give 
orders for his death ? Why should he wish him to be kept a 
close prisoner? 

It was a puzzle that he could not solve ; but at last, as he lay 
there thinking, the light broke more and more into the darkness 
of his mind. 

It would be, he was sure, something to do with his intimacy 
with the English ; and if so, Hamet's friendship was false. 

Ali had suspected him for some time ; and as he lay thinking, 
it seemed to him that he was correct in surmising that though 
Hamet was sincere enough, perhaps, when he made his first 
arrangements for the reception of a resident, the act had given 
such annoyance to several of the neighbouring Malay princes, 
notably to Rajah Gantang, that in his fear for his personal safety 
the sultan had repented of the arrangement, or had been 
coerced by those who might, he knew, in spite of the English 
being at hand, secretly have him assassinated. 

This being the case, then, what should he do ? 

It was still a hard problem to solve, but as he went on think- 
ing, Ali's brow grew damp, for he started upon a strange current 
of reasoning. 

Sultan Hamet knew little of the English power. Certainly 
they had good fighting men and guns ; but they were small in 
number, and he might easily overcome them, and the people at 
Singapore or Penang would not dare to send more. If they 
did, the new contingent could be served Ihe same as the old. 

Ali's blood turned cold. Certain little things, which had only 
slightly roused his curiosity, now assumed an ominous signifi- 
cance J and as he thought, he started hastily into a sitting position. 

This movement caused his guards to turn upon him ; and 
seeing that he had excited their curiosity, he bent down over the 
supply of food placed for him, and began to eat as calmly 
as if nothing whatever troubled his spirit. But all the same, he 
was wet with perspiration, and his heart beat painfully ; for the 
liglit had come, and he saw plainly enough that something was 

wrong. 

This was why he was a prisoner. Hamet knew of his intimacy 
with the young Englishmen, and feared that he would learn his 
plans and communicate them at the residency, perhaps to their 
defeat 



There was danger, then, threatening those whom he had made 
his friends. Hamet had yielded to the taunts of Rajah Gantang 
and others, and also given up to his own desire for revenge. 

The resident had offered him a deadly insult in refusing to 
listen to the matrimonial proposal, and also in refusing to give 
up the slaves who had taken refuge with him. 

Here was plenty of cause for hatred ¡ª a hatred that had been 
concealed under a mask of smiles ; and now it was evident that 
Hamet meant to strike a blow at the English, destroying them, 
gaining possession of their arms and stores, and ¡ª the thought 
made him shudder as he pretended to be eating ¡ª get the two 
tenderly -nurtured ladies into his power. 

How and when would this be done ? AH asked himself, and 
again came a flash of light, and he saw it all plainly enough. A 
trap had been laid for the English, and they were walking into it 

-that hunting party ! 

It was all plain enough ; the English force would be divided. 
A part would be marched to some suitable part of the jungle, 
miles away, and beyond the reach of their friends, where even 
the sounds of firing could not be heard, and then they would be 
set upon, and butchered in cold blood, most likely during their 
sleep. 

This was the tiger-hunt, then, with the unfortunate English 
party being led directly into the tiger's lair 1 

It was terrible I The young man's face became convulsed 
with horror as he thought of the massacre that must ensue, 
and Ihen of the surprise of those on the island and on the ship. 
Treachery, he knew, would be brought to bear in both cases, and 
here was he, knowing all, and yet unable to stir. 

At all hazards, even that of death, he must make the venture, 
and warn those in peril ; but where must he go first ? 

A moment decided that. 

To the steamer and the island, and afterwards to the hunting- 
party ; which would be easy enough to follow by their track, if 
they had gone. 

In the eager impulse of the determination, he sprang to his 
feet to go, but as he did so three Malays sprang to their feet, 
and each man drew his kris. 



CHAPTER XXXVI. 



AT THE PRISON IN THE WOODS. 

The menacing act on the part of his captors brought Ali back 
to a sense of his position, and he stood there, gazing from one 
to the other, thinking what he should do. 

Unarmed as he was, any attempt at violence was utter mad- 
ness, and that he knew; so after a few moments* thought he 
made a sign for the chief man of the party to advance, which 
he did cautiously, and with his weapon held ready to strike. 

Seeing his suspicion, Ali smiled, and threw himself on the 
floor, where, resting on one elbow, he began to appeal to the 

man to let him go, but only to find his words listened to in 

solemn silence. 

The young chief then began to offer him bribes, one after the 
other, making the man's eyes glisten when he promised him 
his double gun ; but directly after the man made a negative sign, 
merely told him to finish his meal, and returned to the cuter 
room. 

What was he to do ? The more he thought of the suspicions 
that had entered his mind, the more certain did he become that 
he was right ; and his sufferings became terrible, as in imagina- 
tion he saw a treacherous attack made upon those he esteemed 
as friends, and the whole party put to death. 

Could he not escape ? It would not take him so very long 
to make his way to the river, where, if he could not seize upon 
a boat, he might swim down to the island, risking the crocodiles ; 
though, somewhat unnerved by his late adventure, he felt a 
shudder run through him at the recollection of the grip of the 
loathsome beast. 

Yes, he must get away, he said. He must elude the vigilance 
of the people who watched him, and by some means escape. 
Once in the jimgle-path, with anything like a start, he did not 
feel much fear. 

The hunt was to be on the next day but one, and that would 




give him ample time to devise some plan. He would require 
all his strength, so he must eat ; and though the act went against 
him, he set to and ate of the food provided, then leaned back 
and half closed his eyes, knowing full well that his every act was 
still watched by those who had made him a prisoner. 

What should he do ? 

Bribery with the chief of the party was evidently useless, for 
though he had promised any price the man liked to name, 
he would not listen ; though that was no cause for surprise, since 
if the man helped the young chief to escape, his own life 
would be forfeit, unless he could escape from the country. 

But there were his followers, he might be able to win one of 
them to his side, could he get at him, and that could only be 
achieved by throwing the leader to some extent off his guard. 

Even if he could enlist the sympathy of one of the others, 
Ali felt in no wise sure of success. Better, he thought, to trust 
to himself, and try to escape. 

His anxiety grew momentarily greater, even though he knew 
the hunting party would not set off until another day had elapsed, 
while, try hard as he would, he could devise no scheme that 
seemed likely to succeed. 

Through his half-closed eyes he scanned every part of the 
closely-woven walls, to see if he could make out a weak place 
in his prison, but not one appeared; then turning, as if rest- 
lessly, he gazed up at the palm-thatched roof, to see if there was 
any opening there; but even if there had been, he saw the 
hopelessness of trying, and at last he lay still with a dull feeling 
of despair creeping over him. 

Night fell at last, and he saw his captors light a couple of 
dammar torches, with whose light they were able to see dis- 
tinctly his every act ; and then he noticed that three of the men 
took up the task of watching him, while the others slept. 

The hours rolled on, and, perfectly sleepless himself, Ali lay 
upon a couple of mats that had been brought him, listening to 
the heavy breathing of the men in the next room, and to the 
weird noises in the jungle, where the animals that had lain 
hidden all day were now prowling about, close to the ruined 
buildings, as if attracted by the presence of human beings in 
their midst. 

Never had night seemed so long, or day so slow in coming ; 
but at last as Ali lay watching he suddenly became aware that 
the dammar torches, lit by each watching party in turn, were be- 
ginning to pale, and that it was once more day. 

That day passed away in the most weary and monotonous 



manner. Sleepless as had been the young chiefs night, he still 
felt no desire to dose his eyes, but lay watching and thinking. 
Still no hopeful idea entered his head. The men were watched, 
he found, by their leader, who seemed to sleep so lightly that 
he was upon his feet the moment any of his followers moved, 

Ali tried him again twice in the course of that day, but found 
him incorruptible; do what he would, the highest promises 
having no more effect than the lowest. 

" No," he said once, grimly j " if I let you escape, all you gave 
me would not save my life." 

" Who would dare to hurt you ? " exclaimed Ali. 

The man smiled sourly, and made no reply, but walked 
away. 

That day glided by, and still no chance of escape. Food 
was brought, and Ali ate mechanically, feeling that he might 
need his strength when he did make the effort to get away \ but 
still there seemed no chance. Walls, floor, roof, all were 
slight, and yet too strong for him to make any impression upon 
them, unless he could have had a few minutes to himself; then 
he would not have despaired of getting through. Sometimes 
he resolved to make a bold dash, run by his guards, and, leaping 
down by the entrance, trust to his swiftness to escape ; but a few 
minutes* consideration taught him that such a plan must result 
in failure. His only hope was to elude the men. 

Why did not his father try and save him? he asked himself; 
and then he sank back despairing again, wondering what he 

should do. 

Then he tried his guard again upon another tack ¡ª would he, 
if he would not let him escape, bear a message to the residency 
island ? 

The man replied by a stem negative ; and, as night came on, 
Ali determined to escape at all hazards. 

The next morning the party would be starting for the hunt ¡ª 
a hunt from which, he*felt sure, they would never return. Then 
it was certain that a treacherous attack would be made upon the 
ship and the island, and yet here he lay supine, knowing all this, 
and yet unable to act. 

Night fell, and with the intention of making a bold rush 
through the outer room when half the watchers were asleep, 
Ali lay, watching hour after hour for an opportunity. 

Time went on, and it seemed as if the leader would never 
lie down ; he always seemed to have something more to say to 
his followers. But at last he threw himself on the floor, and 
seemed to sleep. 




The time had come. 

Three men sat there watching him, their swarthy faces glisten- 
ing in the light of the torches. All was dark without, and the 
low growling noise of beasts was once more heard in close prox- 
imity to the place. Still they would not keep him back. He 
could risk an encounter with one of them, even death, sooner 
than this fearful torture. 

At last he turned softly, and drew up one leg, watching his 
guards the while. 

They did not hear him, and he drew up the other leg. 

Still no notice was taken ; and softly rising to his hands and 
knees, Ali remained motionless, nerving himself for the supreme 
effort. 

The men were talking in a low voice, the sleepers breathed 
hard, and now was the moment Rising then to his feet, he was 
about to make a rush across the room ; he had even stooped to 
give impetus to his spring, when the chief of his guards leaped 
up, kris in hand, the others following the example, and Ali 
shrank back disheartened, and fully awake now to the fact that 
some one had been watching him all the time. 

To struggle with them would only have been to throw away 
his life ; so, with his heart full of despair, Ali allowed himself 
to be pressed back to his old position, where he lay down, his 
captor telling him savagely that the orders were to kill him if 
he attempted to escape. 

" And we shall," said the Malay, " sooner than lose you." 

His words were uttered in a tone of voice that told his hearer 
of the sincerity of that which was spoken. Ali knew the char- 
acter of the Malays too well to entertain any doubt. There would 
not be the slightest compunction in the matter ; and knowing 
this, he lay there watching the men, as they slowly settled down 
once more around the blazing dammar-torch they had re- 
plenished. 

One coolly replaced his kris, and proceeded to get ready his 
betel for a fresh chew, calmly taking a sirih leaf, spreading upon 
it a little creamy lime from a tiny box, and rolling in it a scrap 
of nut, his red-stained teeth looking ogre-like in the torch-light. 

Another set-to and prepared to smoke, making himself a pipe 
in a very few minutes out of a piece of green bamboo, cutting it off 
close to the joint, and then a little above it for a bowl, in one side 
of which he made a hole, and thrust in a little reed for a stem. 
In this sylvan pipe he placed some broken leaf of the coarse 
Malay tobacco, and began to smoke contentedly ; while the third 
watcher helped himself to a piece of sugar-cane, and began 



peeling off the harsh, siliceous envelope, and then eating the 
sweet soft interior. 

The leader had at once lain down, and seemed to have gone 
off to sleep ; but of that Ali could not be sure. 

He had failed ; but Ali was not yet disheartened, and he lay 
there, thinking that he would risk life over and over again to 
warn his friends; but still he had to consider that if he lost 
his life he would not be serving them in the slightest degree, 
even if they should see his disfigured body float down. 

What could he do ? 

If he had only possessed a little toohah, that creeping plant 
whose roots the Malays used for drugging the fish, some of that, 
he thought, infused in the food of his guards, would send them 
into a state of stupefaction, and give him time to escape. 

He smiled directly after as he thought of this, and lay back 
wearily, thinking of what folly it was to form such bubble-like 
ideas \ for of course it would have been impossible, even had he 
possessed the drug, to get it mingled with his captors' food. 

No, he felt he must wait now, and trust to their dropping off 
to sleep, when he might still manage to crawl to the doorway, 
leap down, and dash into the jungle. 

As he lay thinking, the hard breathing of a couple of the 
Malays could be plainly heard, and his hopes rose, for the others 
must grow weary, sooner or later, and fall asleep. The noises 

in the jungle increased ; and as he lay with his cheek against the 
bamboo flooring, the sounds came up very plainly between the 

interstices. Now it was the heavy crashing of the reeds, the 
rustling of some animal going through the dense undergrowth, 
and then, unmistakeably, the low, snarling roar of a tiger. Now 
it was distant ¡ª now close at hand, and he knew that one of the 
great, cat-like creatures was answering another. How close it 
seemed ! He could almost fancy that the tiger was beneath the 
house, hiding in the reedy grass that had sprung up amidst the 
ruins. 

Two of the Malays moved about uneasily, and they lit a fresh 
torch, an act that set Ali thinking of cases he had known, in 
which tigers had sprung up eight or ten feet to the platform of a 
house, and seized and borne off its occupants one after the other. 

If only one of the monsters would perform such a good office 
for him now, he would be able to escape in the midst of the con- 
fusion, perhaps into the jaws of another. 

Well, if he did ; what then ? he asked himself. Better trust 
to chance in the jungle, than be left to the tender mercies of 
these men. 




The roars came louder and nearer, close up at last, and the 
Malays seized their limbings, and stood with the keen points 
advanced towards the entrance; but their leader sulkily rose, took 
one of the dammar torches, made it blaze a little, and going 
boldly towards the door, waited till a snarling roar came close at 
hand, when he hurled it with all his might in the tiger s direction. 

There was a savage, deep-mouthed, hollow yell, and the crash 
of brittle reeds, telling that the tiger had rushed away, alarmed 
at the fire ; when the man came slowly back, said something to 
his companions, who resumed their seats, while he seemed to lie 
down and go off to sleep. 

Seemed, Ali felt ; for after his late experience, he was sure 
that if any attempt were made to cross the room this watchful 
Malay would immediately rise to his feet and confront him. 

Ali was intensely agitated. The expedition was to start the 
next morning, and if he did not warn them, they would be march 
ing, he was sure, right into the jaws of death. Still the night 
was young as yet, and some opportunity might occur. 

The light from the torches flickered and danced in the night 
air, and cast strange shadows about the place. From where he 
lay he could see the forms of his guards, huge and distorted, 
against the woven reed and bamboo walls, their every movement 
being magnified and strange. In his own part, from time to time 
he could see the bright green growth that had forced itself 
through the palm-thatch, and trace every bamboo rafter, save 
where, in places, all was in profound darkness. 

How dreamy and strange it all seemed 1 There was the 
distant roaring of the tigers, growing more and more faint ; the 
soft sighing of the night wind, and the rustle of the dry grass as 
some creature, on its nocturnal hunt for food, brushed through. 
Time was going by fast, but still the night was not nearly past, 
and the opportunity might come. 

Surely, he thought, the leader was asleep now ; he had moved 
uneasily two or three times, and was now lying motionless upon 
his back. One of the other men, too ¡ª the watchers ¡ª had let 
his chin sink upon his breast, and the other two looked heavy 
and dull. 

His heart rose high with hope, for surely the chance of escape 
was going to be his. 

The torches were growing dim, and if not soon replenished 
with fresh dammar, they would both be out ; but no one stirred 
to touch them. 

Ali waited, with every nerve drawn tight to its utmost strain, 
and he was ready for the rush, but he hung back, for fear too 





great precipitancy should spoil his chance ; and he watched and 
watched, lying there till, to his great joy, one of the torches went 
completely out, and the other was failing. 

Would either of the Malays move ? 

No, they were asleep ; and the second torch gave out but a 
dim glimmer, as Ali rose, softly as a cat, and going on all fours, 
began to make what he felt was his final trial to get free. 

He crept on nearer and nearer, but no one stirred. On he 
wentj till he was close to his guards ¡ª so near that he could have 
stretched out a hand and touched them ¡ª but still no one moved. 
Their leader seemed now to be the most soundly asleep of the 

party, and so intensely excited did the fugitive become that it 

was all he could do to master himself and keep from rising up 
and rushing to the open door, through which the cool night 
wind now began to fan his cheeks. 

He kept down the exciting feelings, though, by a mighty effort, 
and crawled softly on, as the second dammar torched burned 
out, and all was darkness. 

He passed the last man, and was now out well in the middle 
of tlie great room, with the open doorway before him, dimly seen 
like a square patch of star-lit sky. The hard breathing of the 
sleepers came regularly, and there was the low sighing of the 
wind without, then the softened, distant roar of a tiger, heard 
again and again, and repeated far more distantly. Then all was 
very still : the only noise being the faint rustle of his sarong, as 
he crept on nearer and nearer to the opening, from whence he 
meant to lower himself silently and make straight for the river, 
and try to find a boat. 

It was hard work to keep crawling along there, inch by inch, 
lest the bamboos should creak. They bent and yielded to liis 
weight over and over again, and twice over they gave so loud a 
noise that Ali paused, listening for the movement of his guards, 
meaning then to spring up and flee. Still no one moved, and 
in spite of his intense desire to make a bold rush, he crept on, 
knowing how great would be his advantage if he could get off 
without waking his guards, and free from the pursuit of a party 
following upon his track like a pack of hungry hounds. 

Not two yards from the door now, and it seemed as if he 
would never reach it. His breath came thick and fast, and his 
heart throbbed so that he felt the bamboos over which he 
crawled vibrate, but still no one moved. 

Another yard gained, and still all was darkness and silence, 
while the strain upon his nerves seemed greater than they could 
beat. 





The last yard, and he grasped the bamboos to lower himself 
softly down, when there was a rush, a cry, a hurriedly-spoken 
order, and the Malays, who seemed to have divined that he was 
there, dashed across the floor in pursuit. 

AH told himself that he must not be taken, and dropping to 
the earth, he dashed across the reed and grass-grown space, and 
made for the jungle path, meaning to follow it for a certain 
distance, and then strike off at the first opening across to the river. 

To have attempted the jungle at once would have been utter 
madness, for he could not have forced his way a dozen yards 
through the tangled growth. All he could do was to trust to 
swiftness of foot and follow the track, and that was horribly 
overgrowiL Thorns caught and tore his baju and sarong, rattan 
canes tripped him up, or were so woven across his path that he 
had to leap over them, when the upper boughs beat and lashed 
his face ; but still he tore on, with his pursuers close behind. 
He could hear their shouts, and almost distinguish their breath- 
ing, as they panted on close behind him. 

It was terrible work, and he felt himself at this disadvantage, 
that he was clearing the way down the little-used jungle path 
for his pursuers, while every now and then he stepped into an 
elephant-hole, and nearly fell heavily. The tracks left by the 
huge beasts were in places very deep, but somehow Ali seemed 
to save himself just as he was on the point of failing. 

On still through the intense darkness, and his pursuers close 
behind. The nearest, he seemed to feel, was the leader of the 
party ] and as he listened to his heavy breathing, and fancied 
that the man was gaining upon him, the keen kris he held in his 
hand nearly grazed his shoulder. 

A dozen times over, with the desperation of some hunted 
beast, Ali would have turned at bay and faced this man, but he 
knew that it meant death or capture, for the others were close 
behind, while he was quite unarmed. 

And what did death or capture mean ? The destruction 01 
those whom he was trying to save. 

Feeling this, he toiled on, with heart throbbing, his breath 
coming tiiickly, and his limbs growing more heavy moment by 
moment At first he had bounded along like a frightened deer, 
but the terrible nature of the jungle through which he was 
struggling soon began to tell upon him, and the bounding pace 
settled down into a weary trot. 

There was this, however, in his favour ; the ground was very 
bad for his pursuers, and though eager to overtake him, they 
were not moved by the same intense desire as himselt 




On still, and he was once more nearly down. Something 
lashed his face, then he tripped again once more, and the jungle, 
as he staggered up, seemed to grow more intensely dark. That 
vindictive enemy was close behind, and he had struck at him 
twice with his keen weapon. Then, as he panted on, he came 
upon first one and then another animal, which bounded away 
into close growth, while the poor hunted wretch could hardly 
drag one leg before the other. 

Still he struggled on through the darkness, till feeling his 
pursuer close at hand, he roused all his remaining strength and 
leaped forw'ard, caught his foot in a mass of interwoven creeping 
plants, and fell. He made one effort to rise, but his strength 
was gone, and he had only time to throw himself over and get 
his hands at liberty, as his pursuer threw himself down upon him, 
clutched him by the throat, and, raising his kris, was about to 
plunge it into the prostrate young man*s breast. 

But All was too quick. In spite of his weakness and the 
suffocating sensation caused by his position, he made a snatch 
at the descending arm, caught it, and stopped the blow, and 
then they both lay there panting and exhausted, chaser and 
chased, unable to do more than gaze into each other's eyes, as 
the jungle now began to grow lighter, and Ali could see the 
gleam of the deadly kris just above his head. 

They were terrible moments ; the oppression was so great 
that he could hardly breathe, and at the same time he felt him- 
self growing weaker and weaker. There was the baleful glare 
of his enemy's eyes, and the gleam of the kris growing each 
moment nearer, and he powerless to arrest it Only a few 
moments, and in spite of his brave resistance all would be 
over, and those he sought to save would be lost. 

The thought of the friends at the residency nerved him to 
the final effort, and with a wild cry he drew himself up, and 
tried to throw his enemy from his chest¡ª his enemy, wliose 
eyes and weapon glared down at him so, and summoning all 
his strength, he felt that he had succeeded. 

Panting heavily, Ali started up, but the gleam was about him 
still, for the bright rays of the morning sun were shining down 
through the attap roof, and with a moan of misery he sank back 
once more on finding that he had been overcome by weariness, 
and that this last painful episode was only a dream. 

And his friends that he meant to save ¡ª what of them ? 

Ali lay back and closed his eyes, for his misery seemed 

greater than he could bear. 



CHAPTER XXXVII. 



HOW ALI MADE A DASH FOR LIBERTY. 

As AH lay back there with closed eyes, it seemed impossible 
that he could have slept and dreamed all this, but it was plain 
enough now. He had but to unclose his eyes and see the 
Malays in the outer room, and listen to the twittering of the 
small birds, the screams of the parrots, and the cry uttered from 
time to time by some monkey. 

Where was his manhood ? he asked himself ¡ª where his keen 
desire to escape and help his friends ? He felt half-maddened 
to think that he should have slept and neglected them, not 
sparing himself for a moment, and never once palliating what 
he called his crime by trying to recall the fact that he had not 
slept the previous night, and that he had been completely 
exhausted. 

There was the fact staring him in the face; he had been 
lying there thinking of escaping, and listening to the cries of the 
prowling tigers, and ¡ª 

" Stop,*' he asked himself, " where did the reality end and 
dreaming begin? Did he see the Malay get up and hurl a 
torch out of the open door, and then come back and lie down ? " 

Yes, he felt sure that was true, but where that which he was 
watching shaded off into dreamland, he could not tell. 

It was weak, perhaps, but the scalding tears rose and filled his 
eyes, and when he passionately dashed them away and sat up, 
he felt ready to make a fierce rush through his guard, and either 
escape or die. 

He was on the point of risking all in some such mad attempt 
when two of the men came in, proceeded to make a careful 
inspection of the place where he was, and then sat down just in 
the opening, getting up soon afterwards, though, to make way for 
another, who brought in some food on fresh plantain leaves, rice 
freshly boiled with fowl, and curry made with freshly-grated 
cocoa-nut and peppers. There was an abundance of fruit, too, 




but All looked at it all with a feeling of disgust. He had no 

desire to eat. 

The men left the food on its fresh green leaves before him, 
and went out to their own meal, while the prisoner sat thinking 
that the expedition had by this time started, for he had slept 
long in spite of his troublous dream. Then his thoughts turned 
to the steamer and Bob Roberts, whose frank, happy face was 
always before him, and then somehow he thought of the steamer 
and its powerful engine, and how it was kept going with fuel 
and water ; and that set him thinking of himself. How was he 
to help his friends if he let himself get weak for want of food. 

The result was, that he ate a few grains of rice, when the want 
of appetite disappeared, and he went on and made a very hearty 
meal. He felt annoyed, though, directly after, to find his captors 
smile as they came to remove the fragments of his feast 

Then began once more the terrible hours of anxiety, during 
which he paced up and down his prison like some wild beast, 
his guards squatting outside, and watching him in the most 
imperturbable manner, as they chewed their betel or varied it by 
smoking. 

So long as he seemed disposed to make no effort to escape 
they were civil enough, one offering him betel, another Java 
tobacco, an object much prized by the Malays, but he did not 
take them, only fixed his eyes jealously upon their weapons, and 
longed to snatch them away, and in some desperate action to 
calm the suffering he endured. 

Every now and then he listened, fancying he could hear the 
distant sound of firing, and he shuddered as he fancied that the 
massacre had already begun. But he was soon compelled to 
own that it was all fancy, and wearied out, he laid himself 
down again to try and scheme a way of escape. 

The day slowly advanced, and the heat became intense in spite 
of the shadow in which he lay. A few light gleams came in 
through thin places in the roof, but they only seemed to make 
the room darker, for a couple o( the Malays had been busy 
stopping up a small hole or two near the closed window. Now 
and then some busy fly or crawling beetle took his attention, or 
a nimble lizard in chase of an insect, and he thought of the 
native proverb as he saw how patiently the lizard crept along 
after its intended victim, and waited its time until with un- 
erring certainty it could make its stroke. 

He told himself that he must take a lesson from the quiet 
little reptile, and await his time. 

And so the day wore on, every hour convincing him more 




and more ot the impossibility of escape, unless some change 
should take place in the arrangements. 

One gleam of hope came to him, and that was afforded by the 
restlessness of his guard. They seemed to be expecting some 
one, and watch was evidently kept for his arrival, but as the 
evening drew near there was no change, and the hope that the 
expected messenger might have been about to order them to 
convey him elsewhere ¡ª to a place perhaps affording a better 
chance of escape, died away. 

True, the hope had been mingled with a sense of dread, for 
he felt that if a messenger had come he might have been bearer 
of an order to put him to death. But no one arrived, the sun 
was sinking fast, and his agony on the increase, for night was 
close at hand, with no prospect of his being able to convey the 
ill news he had to his friends. 

The heat had been terrible to him in his excited state, and 
the evening breeze that now came whispering through the leaves 
seemed but little better. The men in the next room had twice 
over brought him food and water, and they were now busily pre- 
paring their dammar torches, a couple of which were soon 
burning brightly, sending a warm glow like a golden band right 
across the prisoner's room, leaving both sides in the shade. 

Worn out with weariness of mind and body, Ali lay there at 
last, telling himself that he ought to follow the exa^nple of his 
compatriots, and calmly accept the inevitable. 

But that he could not do, for he lay there fuming with impa- 
tience, and watching the outer room for a chance of escape. 
That did not come, for the party were more watchful than ever ; 
and at last he sank back, feeling that all was over, and praying 
that warning might be given to those in danger, in some other 
way. 

For the sake of coolness he was lying away from his mat, on 
the bamboo floor, between the rough pieces of which the night 
air came up, mingled with the sweet odours of the forest; and 
as he lay there, with his head throbbing from the mental ex- 
citement, while his guards were talking together in a low voice, 
Ali began to wonder whether he should hear the tiger prowling 
about the place that night. Then he began to think of the 
midshipman and tlie ensign, and he tried to comfort himself 
with the idea that the English were very brave, and might 
read Sultan Hamet a severe lesson instead of being beaten. 

These thoughts were just crossing his mind, when he started, 
for it seemed to him that there was something rising close at 
hand, and then a faint touch. 





This was evidently heard only by himself, for no one in the 
outer place had moved. 

Ali felt a strange shudder pass through him, for the noise was 
just that which a large serpent would make as it forced its way 
between some old pieces of woodwork, and this was just the place 
for some monster to make its haunt. It had evidently been 
temporarily driven away, but had now in the silence of the evening 
returned to its home in the deserted house. 

Ali was as brave as most young fellows of his age, but at the 
same time he shrank from contact with such a loathsome beast, 
and lay motionless, wondering whether it would pass him by, and 
then half-resolving to call the men to come with lights. 

He was on the point of shouting to them, but he hesitated as 
his alarm might be foolish, and the noise be caused by some in- 
offensive creature. 

He lay there listening, and as he did so he suddenly felt 
paralyzed, for something touched his hand. The contact had 
such an effect upon him that he could not move. 

It was a serpent, he was sure, for it felt cold and damp, and ¡ª 
there it was again, evidendy coming up between the bamboos of 
the floor, and seeking about, and ¡ª 

Why, it was a hand, and it grasped his wrist ! 

Ali wanted to call aloud, but he felt as if suffering from night- 
mare ; to leap up, but he felt helpless, and lay bathed in perspir- 
ation. He knew what it was now; some miscreant beneath the 
house, seeking out where he lay. 

He knew of plenty of cases where men had been assassinated 
by an enemy finding out where they slept in a room, and then 
quietly going beneath in the night and thrusting his kris between 
the bamboos. 

This, then, was the way in which he was to be slain ¡ª as if it 
had been done by some stranger. One of his guards then must be 
beneath the house, though he had not heard one go out 

And yet, knowing all this, he could not stir, but lay as if 
stunned, till the blood that had been frozen seemed suddenly to 
start in rapid action, and his veins began to throb, for instead of 
the blade of a kris being thrust remorselessly into his side, the 
handle was softly pushed through against his hand. 

This was a friend then below him, and had he had any doubt 
before, the soft pressure of a hand upon his told him that he was 
right, for there was a riiig upon one finger that touched his, whose 
form he recognized. It was his father's ring, and he had come 
at the risk of losing his own life to save his son's. 

For a few moments hand pressed hand. Then Ali*s was drawn 




softly down between the bamboos, and two hands placed it under 
one of the long, split canes upon which he was lying, held it 
there, and then pressed it upwards. 

All was puzzled. He dare not speak, neither did the Tumon- 
gong below venture so much as to whisper, but kept on forcing 
his son's hand upwards. 

There was a faint creak, and then the light came into Ali's 
puzzled brain. It was plain enough now ; this bamboo had been 
loosened at one end, for it gave way ; and the young man's heart 
throbbed painfully, as he felt that the way of escape was open. 
He had but to wait his time, and then softly raise this orxQ broad, 
split cane, to make space enough to let himself slide through into 
the open space beneath the post-supported house. Then the 
jungle was before him, and it was his own fault if he did not 
escape in the darkness. 

He left off clasping the broad, split bamboo, and stretched 
out his hand once more to clasp that of his father, in expression 
of his thankfulness ; but though he reached out in all directions, 
striving to grasp the loving hand that had brought help, there 
was nothing near, and Ali felt as if in a dream, till his other hand 
touched the kris that was now beneath his chest. 

It was his right arm that was forced down between the bam- 
boos, and he was consequently lying over upon his chest, when, 
to his horror, he heard a noise, and saw the principal of his 
guards seize a torch and enter the room, kris in hand. 

For a moment Ali felt that he must spring up, kris in hand, 
and fight for his life. Fortunately he lay still and feigned sleep, 
his heart beating heavily, as he hoped to conceal the loosened 
bamboo with his body, as well as the kris. 

The Malay looked curiously round the room, and held his 
dammar torch on high, as he peered here and there. Not that 
he had heard a sound, but he was evidently suspicious, or else 
extra careful. 

Ali lay motionless and breathing heavily, but with a choking 
sensation in his breast, as he felt that now, just when escape was 
open to him, he had been discovered. He was in such a state 
of excitement that he was ready to spring up and attack his 
guard, should he make any sign of having found out what had 
taken place ; but though the man held the torch here and there, 
and walked round the room before coming back and bending 
down over Ali, as if to see whether he was asleep, he saw nothing. 

Then a fresh dread assailed the prisoner. Why was this man 
bending over him, and did he mean evil against him? 

Ali would have given anything to have been able to turn round 
and face his enemy, but to have made the slightest movement 




would have been to show that he had a kris beneath him, and 
his arm right through between the bamboos, so the young man 
lay perfectly still, mastered his emotion as best he could, and 
waited for what seemed an unreasonable space of time, till the 
Malay slowly moved off into the outer room, and sticking his 
torch in the floor, seated himself with his companions, and began 

to smoke. 

Panting with excitement, Ali lay there in the darkness, and 
for some time not daring to move ; but at last, watching the 
effect upon his guards the while, he made an uneasy movement 
and muttered a few unintelligible words. 

The men looked up for a moment, but afterwards paid no 
heed j and finding this so, Ali secured the kris in the folds of his 
sarong, after softly withdrawing his arm trom between the bam- 
boos of the floor. 

To his great delight, he found them very loose ; and after 
waiting a reasonable time, and until his guards seemed to be 
settled, he softly raised the one that was loose, and rolled it, as 
it were, over on to the side, leaving a narrow opening through 
the floor. 

Just as he did so, a low, snarling growl close at hand an- 
nounced the return of the tiger. 

This was terrible ; for if he descended now, he was going 
from one danger to another, and his position was pitiable. At 
any moment the Malays might come in and see that the bamboo 
had been moved ; and now all he had to do was to squeeze 
himself down through the opening, and glide away into the 
darkness. 

There was the snarling growl again. The tiger evidently 
scented prey, and it came closer and closer. In fact, Ali felt 
that it was quite possible that the beast might spring up at the 
opening to seize him. 

What could he do but wait ? 

His patience was rewarded ; for as the great cat came prowling 
nearer, one of the Malays, who was uneasy at its presence, 
seized a torch, as had been done the past night; the others 
standing ready with their spears, advanced, and waiting until the 
animal seemed ready to make a spring at the door, he hurled 
the blazing piece of dammar, overturning the second torch in 
the act, one of his companions trampling it out, to save the 
floor from being set alight. 

There was a snarling yell, once more followed by a loud shout 
from the Malays, when the tiger was heard to bound heavily 
away through the jungle, its yell being answered by another 

tiger some distance away. 



Now was All's time. The Malays were talking, and trying to 
relight the torch, the place being in total darkness \ and without 
a moment's hesitation the prisoner softly let himself down 
through the long narrow slit, lower and lower, till he reached his 
waist, where the kris stopped his further descent 

This was horrible, as he was as it were caught in the narrow 
hole, and he could not get the kris out from the folds of his 
silken sarong. 

The Malays, though, were busy over their light ; and freeing 
the weapon at last, he let himself glide down lower and loy^tXy 
but not without noise, for there was hardly room for him to pass, 
and he began to tremble, lest his head should refuse to go through. 

At any moment his guards might come in and find him in this 
helpless state, for he dared not hurry, but had to literally force 
his way down till he had only his head and shoulders above, his 
eyes glaring wildly in the direction of the outer room, where the 
Malays were talking. 

By sheer force of muscle he sustained himself, as he hung at 
length with his head only in the room, and to his horror he 
found that it would not pass through ; for he was opposite two 
of the knots of the bamboo, and strive how he would, he could 
not manage to get himself a little way along, to where the wood 
curved in. 

Just then a light flashed upon his face, and he saw that his 
guards had succeeded in re-illumining their room ; while to his 
horror, he now found that they were coming in to him. 

With a tremendous effort, and feeling now that it was no time 
to study about noise, Ali forced himself a little way along, but in 
doing so slipped, and hung by his head, fixed between the bam- 
boos, as the leader of his captors entered, uttered a shout, and 
made a bound forward to seize him. 

That did it ! 

Had he come forward carefully, he could have seized his help- 
less prisoner ; but this leap on the elastic, hollow canes bent 
one down, and set Ali free, his guard uttering a shout of rage as 
his captive literally slipped through his fingers, All's head dis- 
appearing from the light of the torch, and revealing the long 
narrow slit, looking dark and strange, in the floor, 

" Quick, the Aoox \ " shouted the Malay, as he tried to force 
himself down through the slit ¡ª but had to struggle back, giving 
Ali moments to recover himself from the painful shock he had 
sustained ; and when the man had reached the door, torch in 
hand, and leaped down to where his men were hurrying here and 
there, it was for the light to gleam for a moment on Ali's bright, 
silken baju, as he plunged into the jungle, forty yards away. 



CHAPTER XXXVIII. 



A SWIM IN THE NIGHT. 

As has been said, Ali suffered quite a shock from the jerk he 
received in escaping from his prison, and had his captors rushed 
down directly, his attempt would have resulted in failure ; but 
the effort made by the Malay to follow him afforded the prisoner 
time to recover a little, to struggle up from where he had fallen, 
and to stagger off in a strange confused state, feeling all the 
while as if his head had been wrenched off. 

Each moment, however, gave him force ; he heard the shouts 
of the men as they leaped down from the platform ; and as the 

light of the torch flashed upon his path, he seemed to regain his 
strength, and ran on with his guards in full pursuit. 

The young man set his teeth hard, and grasped the weapon 
supplied to him by his father's hand. He was far from being 
bloodthirsty ; contact with the English had softened and changed 
his nature, but in those fierce moments the feeling was upon him 
strong that he could slay or be slain sooner than give up his 
liberty once more. 

He recalled his dream of the early morning as he dashed on, 
and wondered whether the leader was the first man in the pur- 
suit, and whether they two would engage in deadly strife. 

He glanced back, but he could not tell ; and hurrying on, he 
kept recalling the difficulties he had encountered in his dream ¡ª 
elephant holes ¡ª woven undergrowth ¡ª trailing canes ¡ª the hun- 
dred obstacles of a jungle, and wondered that he kept so well in 
the darkness to the path, and was able to progress at so swift a 
pace. 

Not that it was swift, for he had to proceed very cautiously, 
but it was fast enough to enable him to keep well ahead of his 
pursuers, who had to make sure that they did not pass him on 
the way. 

But this easy going was not to last, for he found the jungle 
track grew worse, and to his horror he found that his pursuers 





were gaining upon him rapidly. The light the first man carried 
enabled them to see a few yards in advance and make sure their 
steps, while he had what seemed like a black wall rising in front 
of him, into which he had to plunge as it were, and often and 
often found that he was straying from the track. 

At last he strayed so far from it that his pursuers came up 
rapidly, their light showing him the path he had lost. He was 
about to make a rush for it, when the thought struck him that 
they might pass him unseen, and, crouching down, to his great 
delight he found that they did pass on ¡ª the whole party ¡ª leaving 
him to deliberate on what course he should pursue. 

The simplest plan seemed to be to turn back, but that would 
be taking him away from the river, which he felt would be his 
saving to reach, and to gain that he must pursue the track his 
guards were upon. 

After all, if he kept at a distance this was the safest plan. 
His enemies carried a light, and he would therefore be able to 
see them when they returned, if return they did ; and to his 
great delight he remembered now that some distance ahead 
there was a track which led right away from the present one to- 
wards the river, making a shorter cut. 

He did not stop to think, but at once followed the course 
taken by his guards, hastening his steps till he was pretty close 
behind ¡ª so close that he could hear their voices, and see the 
flaring of the torch through the undergrowth. 

This went on for nearly an hour, when the Malays awakened 
fully to the fact that their prisoner had not gone in that direc- 
tion, and they returned upon their track so suddenly that Ali had 
barely time to force his way in amongst the canes and crouch 
down, silent and breathless, before they were back, and were 
passing the place where the young man was hidden, when the 
bearer of the torch saw the broken canes and leaves, and drew 
attention thereto, 

" Tiger I " said the man nearest to him, and he pointed to 
some footprints which were sufficiently recent to satisfy the other, 
and to Ali's great relief they passed on. 

For a few moments he had felt that he was once more a 
prisoner, and now he breathed freely again, and waiting till the 
last rustle of the canes and undergrowth had died away with 
the faint gleam of the torch, he crept painfully out from amidst 
the thorny undergrowth, and continued his retreat. 

He paused from time to time to listen, but all was silent now, 
and almost feeling his way through the dark forest, he pressed 
on, gladdened now and then by a glimpse of the starry sky, he 





continued his course, till he reached the edge of the river, rolling 
swift and dark through the midst of the dense forest. 

Ali had heard the strange sounds on either side of the dark 
track he had come along, more than once shuddering slightly 
as he heard the cry of a tiger or the curious coo-ai of the argus 
pheasant, but nothing sounded so pleasant to him during his 
excitmg retreat as the strange, low, untiring rush of the great 
river. 

There was no noisy babbling, but a soft, low, hissing rush, as 
the swift stream hurried amidst the stones and water washed 
roots of the trees upon the banks. 

He had hoped to find a boat somewhere about the end of the 
track, where there was a wretched campong ; but there did not 
seem to be a single sampan, and he tramped wearily down the 
bank, till he came near the houses opposite the island. 

He dared go no further along the bank, lest he should be 
seized ; and he stood in the shade of a tree at last, thinking of 
what he should do. 

But one course was open to him, and that was to swim out 
into the swift stream, and make for the head of the island, where, 
to his great delight, all seemed perfectly still, and free from 
alarm. How long it would keep so, he could not say. 

There was no other way for him, and being a swift swimmer 
he hesitated no longer, but throwing off his baju and sarong, 
he walked out as far as he could and swam boldly towards the 
head of the island, where he meant to land. 

To his horror he found a couple of boats in the way, both of 
them well filled with men, and it was only by letting himself 
float down with the stream that he was able to pass them 
unnoticed. This, however, completely carried him out of his 
reckoning, for on striving once more to reach the head of the 
island, he was too low down, and was swept right away. He 
tried for the landing-place, but he could not near it, and in 
spite of his desperate efforts he was drawn on lower and lower by 
the heavy stream, so that he could not even grasp at the drooping 
trees at the lower end of the island, but found himself carried 
right away towards the lights of the corvette, where she lay a 
quarter of a mile lower down. 

Knowing that he could not catch at anything on the smooth 
sides of the steamer, he made another frantic effort to reach 
the side of the island, but it was labour in vain, and at I st, 
weak, exhausted, and with the water rising higher and higher 
about his lips, he felt that he was being carried right away, and 
that, unless help came, he would be drowned. 





He grew excited and struggled harder, but only to weaken 
himself. He was confused by the darkness, and found that he 
had miscalculated his powers. The strain upon him during the 
past two days, and the efforts he had made that night, had been 
greater than he was aware of; and now, in spite of the sterling 
stuff of which he was made, the chill, dread thought came upon 
him that he was about to die. 

The lights of the steamer seemed very near, and yet far distant, 
for a blinding mist was before his eyes ; and though he swam 
bravely, over and over again the swift current seemed to suck 
him down. He essayed to cry for help, but the water choked 
him ; and at last he felt that all was over, that he should in 
another minute be swept past the steamer, when, trying to turn 
over and float, he went under, rose to the surface once more, 
struck against something and clutched at it, to find it slimy 
and hard to hold ; but it enabled him to hold his head above 
water a few moments, while he cried for help ¡ª lost his hold, and 
was swept away once more, when all seemed dreamy and strange. 
The water thundered in his ears, his limbs were helpless, and it 
was as if he were being wpited into a strange and troublous sleep, 
when he knew no more, for all seemed blank. 



CHAPTER XXXIX. 

HOW ALl BROUGHT NEWS, AND WAS NOT BELIEVEB. 

There was plenty of excitement on board the steamer, as the 
falls were hooked on and the light gig was run up to the davits, 
the boat then being swung on board ; and as lights were 
brought, the body of the man they had tried to save was laid upon 
the deck, 

" Why, it*s a nigger ! " exclaimed Bob Roberts ; and then, 
with a cry of horror, " Oh, Mr Johnson, it's old All ! Here, 
quick ; help, brandy ! Oh, he's dead ! he*s dead ! " 

" No, he aren*t, sir," said Dick gruffly ; " leastwise, I don't 
think so." 

" Carry him into the cabin," said Lieutenant Johnson sharply ; 
and this being done, the poor fellow was stripped, briskly rubbed, 
and the customary plans adopted to restore respiration. Bob 
Roberts eagerly taking his turn, till, to his delight, as he watched 
Ali's arms being worked up and down, so as to empty and fill his 
chest, there was a faint flutter, a sigh, and the doubts as to the 
young Malay's life being spared were at an end. 

" Hooray ! " cried Bob, who was only in his shirt and trousers, 
his collar open, and his sleeves rolled right up to his shoulders. 
" Hooray ! " he cried ; and forgetting all his dignity as second 
officer in command of Her Majesty's ship, he indulged in a kind 
of triumphal dance, which ended with a flop, caused by his 
bringing one foot down flat on the cabin floor. 

" I think that will do, Mr Roberts," said the lieutenant quietly ; 
and Bob coloured up and looked confused, 

" I felt so delighted, sir, to see the poor old chap better," he 
stammered. 

" So I see,'* said the lieutenant. " There, put on your jacket, 
and give the men a glass of grog apiece for what they have 
done towards saving our friend here. Dick, there, has pretty 
well rubbed his skin ofl"." 

" Well, sir," said Dick in an ill-used tone, " I rubbed as hard 
as ever I could" 




" That you did, Dick," said the middy. 

*' And he is coming to, sir," continued Dick, 

" Yes," said the lieutenant, " a good sleep will set him right, 
I think. It is a pity the doctor has gone on the expedition ; but 
we must do the best we can." 

" Expedition ! " said Bob sharply, " of course ; but I thought 
All here had gone. He was going. Oh, I know ; he has 
stopped behind because Tom Long and I were not going.'' 

" Very likely," said the lieutenant drily ; " but had you not 
better see about the men's refreshment ? " 

" Oh ] yes, sir ; of course," said Bob, hurrying on his Jight 
jacket ; and Dick and a couple of men, who had been helpings 
followed him out of the cabin, smiling and wiping their lips in 
anticipation of the promised drink. 

They had hardly left the cabin when Ali opened his eyes, and 
lay gazing up at the ceiling, then, in a curious, puzzled way, at 
the light, his mind struggling to recover itself and master his 
confusion. 

A sigh and a few muttered words took the lieutenant to his 
side ; and on seeing him Ali started, and said something to him 
in the Malay tongue. 

** Are you better ? " said the lieutenant kindly. 

" Better?" he said, " better ? Where am I ? what place is this ?'' 

" You are on board the steamer. We found you drowning in 
the river." 

Ali clasped his forehead with his hands for a few moments,, 
and then all seemed to come back like a flood. 

" Yes," he said hoarsely, " I know now. I was swimming to 

the island." 

" I see ; and you were swept away," said the lieutenant kindly. 

" I think you had better lie down, and have a good sleep/' he 

continued, as the young man struggled up. 

" No, no J " cried Ali excitedly- " I recollect all now. Quick ! 
call your men ; there is great danger ! *' 

''Come, come," said the lieutenant gently, "calm yourself. 
Try and sleep. 

He laid his hand firmly on the young man's arm, but Ali 

caught his wrist. 

" What, do you think," he cried, " that I am speaking no 
sense ? " 

" Well," said the lieutenant, smiling, " I think you are excited 

and ill" 

" No, no," cried AIL " Give me clothes ; I will fight for yoiu 

There is danger 1 " 




" Nonsense 1 " said the lieutenant. " There, lie down ; and 
Roberts, your friend, you know, shall come and sit with you." 

" Oh, listen to me ! " cried Ali piteously. " I am not as you 
think. I swam off to warn you, Hamet has got half your men 
away by treachery, I am sure they are going to attack you, 
Quick ! get ready ; there is great, great danger ! Give me clothes, 
and I'll fight for you ! " 

As he spoke excitedly, Bob Roberts entered the cabin, and 
stood listening. 

" Come and speak to him, Roberts/' said the lieutenant 
quietly. " Poor fellow ! he is overdone, and it has flown to his 
head." 

" Ah I You here ? " cried Ali joyfully. " He will not believe 
me, Bob. Listen ; there is going to be an attack made upon 
you ¡ª at the island, and here. They have got your men and 
officers away to lead them into a trap. I escaped to tell you." 

" Oh I come, old chap, don't talk like that," cried Bob, taking 
his hand. " Don*t talk such wild nonsense and bosh. Lie 
down and have a good sleep. I say, Mr Johoson, I wish old 
Bolter was here." 

"You do not believe me !" cried Ali passionately. "What 
am I, that you treat me so ? Is it that I always lie ? " 

" Lie ? No, old boy," said Bob kindly ; " but it isn't you 
talking. Your head's all in a muddle," 

"Head? muddle? Not I T' cried Ali excitedly. "There! 
hark ! I told you so ! " 

As he spoke there was the sharp crack of a rifle, then another, 
and another, and a rattling scattered volley. 

"Something wrong at the island, sir," reported one of the 
watch. 

" By Jove ! he's right 1 " cried the lieutenant, rushing out of 
the cabin. " Quick, Roberts I " 

" Yes ¡ª clothes ¡ª my kris i " cried Ali joyfully. " 1*11 fight with 
you." 

For answer Bob ran to his own berth, hastily threw the young 

Malay one of his spare suits ; and then, quickly buckling on his 
sword, ran on deck, where the lieutenant was striding up and 
down, giving his orders. 

" That's right, Roberts," he cried. " They're hard at work at 
the island," 

The next moment Bob was running here and there, seeing 
that his superior's orders were executed. The drums had already 
beat to quarters, and with the wondrous business-like rapidity 
with which matters are done on board a man-of-war every man 



was at his place, the ports flew open, the magazine was un- 
fastened, and while the moorings were cast off astern, and those 
ahead ready to be dropped at a moment's notice, the lumaces 
were roaring furiously, and every effort being made by the fire- 
men to get up steam. 

It was like the turning of a handle. There was no confusion ; 
the whole machine was ready for action ; guns loaded, and 
marines and sailors armed ready for any contingency that might 
befall the steamer. 

Directly after, Ali came hurrying from the cabin, and made 
his way to where the middy was eagerly looking for his next 
order. 

" Give me arms," he said ; " I have lost my kris." 

" And a good thing, too," said Bob sharply ; " a murderous 
skewer I May I give him a sword, sir ? " 

" Yes, and a revolver, if he means to fight on our side," said 
Lieutenant Johnson sharply ; and Bob hurriedly ordered the 
armourer to take the young Malay and supply what was needed. 
" They are making no signals at the island, Roberts," continued 
the lieutenant, " and I don't know what to do, I would man a 
boat and send on ¡ª " 

"Under me, sir?" said Bob slowly. 

" Of course, Mr Roberts ; but we are so short-handed, I don't 
know what to do for the best. Ah I here is your friend. Now, 
sir ; tell us in a few words what this all means." 

Ali rapidly told him of his belief, and the lieutenant frowned. 

" Certainly there is confirmation of what you say, sir," he 
said sternly, " but the story sounds wild and strange." 

He gazed suspiciously at the young chief; but Ali did not 
blench in the slightest degree. 

Just then the firing seemed to become furious on the island, 
and the lieutenant stamped his foot impatiently, 

" How long is this steam going to be?" he cried. ** How I 
hate being tied by the leg like this, Roberts." 

" It's horrible, sir ! " cried Roberts, who was stamping up and 
down the deck, when he was not trying to make out what was 
going on upon the island, by means of a small glass. " Let's do 
something, sir, or the people there will think we are not going to 
help them." 

" What can we do, lieutenant," said the other, " except send 

a boat?" 

" Let's fire a big gun, captain/* said Bob ; ** tliat'll let 'em 
kaow we are all alive; and then send the boat. I'll be very 
careful, sir." 


The lieutenant hesitated as he watched the island through 
his glass, and could see the flashes of the pieces as they were 
fired. In a short time steam would be up, and the vessel could 
pass right round the island and engage the prahus, if there were 
any attacking. Besides, he was very loth to reduce his already 
short ship's company. 

" If it were not already so confoundedly dark," he exclaimed, 
" we could see what to do. Ah ! at last, there goes the signal." 

For just then there was a rushing noise, and a rocket went up 
from the island, far into the blackness of the night, burst, and 
the bright blue stars fell slowly, lighting up the palms and fruit- 
trees upon the island. 

*' Ready there with a rocket," exclaimed the lieutenant. " Be 
smart, Mr Roberts." 

' Ay, ay, sir," was the reply ; and with a mighty rush away on 
high sped the answering signal, to burst and fill the air above 
them with lambent light 

"That is better than your big gun, Roberts,'* said the lieu- 
tenant. 

" No, sir, I don't think it is," said Bob, " for it won't frighten 
the niggers, and my gun would." 

The night seemed to have come on darker than ever, and the 
rocket stars shone with wonderful brilliancy as they descended 
lower, and lower, and lower, some even to reach the water before 
they went out, and just as the last was floating down, AH, who 
was close to the two officers, suddenly started, grasped Bob's arm, 
and exclaimed sharply, ¡ª 

" Prahus ! " 

He was pointing with one hand down the stream, but on the 
middy gazing in the required direction it was too dark to see 
anything. 

" I can see none," he said. " Where?" 

" Two prahus coming up rapidly," said All ; " be ready to fire." 

" Not so fast, young sir," said the lieutenant. " Will that 
steam never be up ? Roberts," he cried, " touch the trigger of 
that life-buoy." 

The middy obeyed, and a life-buoy dropped over the side 
with a splash, a port-fire at the same moment bursting out into 
a brilliant blue glare, which, as the buoy floated down rapidly 
with the stream, lit up the trees on either shore, made the water 
flash, but above all showed out plainly to all on board a couple 
of large prahus coming rapidly up the stream, the many sweeps 
out on either side making the water foam and flash in the blue 
light shed by the buoy. 



now ALT BROUGHT NEWS. 239 

"There!" said Ali excitedly, "they are Rajah Gantang's 
prahus. Fire at them." 

" Not so fast, sir/* said the lieutenant. " I must first be sure 
that they are enemies." 

He was soon assured of that fact, for as the steamer was lit up 
by the port-fire as well as the prahus, bang, bang, bang, bang, one 
after the other, came the reports of the brass guns the two long 
boats had on board, and a hail of small iron balls came whisthng 
through the rigging. 

*' There's no doubt about it now," said the lieutenant grimly ; 
and giving the orders as the prahus rapidly advanced, evidently 
with the intention of boarding, the two big guns on the port- 
side thundered out a reply, splashing the water all over one 
prahu, and going through the matting boarding-screen of the 
other ] but otherwise doing no harm. 

The prahus replied, and for a few minutes there was a sharp 
duel kept up, at the end of which time the oars were seen being 
swiftly plied, and the two boats went on up stream at a rapid 
rate, the steamer firing at them as long as they were visible by 
the lights they had on board. 

"Was anything ever so vexatious?" cried the lieutenant. 
" Here we lie like a log upon the water. Will that steam never 
be up?'' 

Just then the welcome news was given, and the order was 

passed down to the engine-room ; the screw began to revolve, 

and the men cheered as the vessel's head was freed from the 

buoy to which she had been moored, and they began to steam 

rapidly in the wake of the two prahus, whose lights had evidently 
passed to the left of the island. 

Meanwhile a sharp engagement had evidently been going on 
in the neighbourhood of the little fort. Once or twice the nine- 
pounder they had there spoke out, but the principal part of the 
firing was that of rifles. Lights were seen from the deck, here 
and there amidst the trees, and were moving upon the shore, 
where the people were evidently in a state of alarm. Still the 
occupants of the island seemed to be making a good fight, and 
the lieutenant felt that he could not be doing them better service 
than by disposing of the two prahus, and to this end the 
steamer went on, its commander having a sharp look-out kept^ 
and a man busy with the lead in the forepart of the vessel. 

At the end of a few minutes the lights on the prahus were 
seen ; the order, " Full speed ahead I " given, for they were now 
in the middle of the open reach of the river, and Lieutenant 
Johnson hoped to sink one or the otha: of his adversaries by 
using a little energy. 





The shadowy shapes of the two boats were made out at the 
end of a minute, and a couple of guns were brought to bear upon 
them, the firing being replied to for a time, the flashes from 
the guns serving to light up the darkness of the night for a 
moment, while the roar of the big guns went rolling along the sur- 
face of the water, and was echoed from the trees upon the bank. 

" Keep that lead going more quickly/' shouted the lieutenant, 
as the last of the prahus, apparently unharmed, passed round 
the head of the island, placing the wooded land between her 
and the steamer, which followed rapidly in their wake. 

The lieutenant's orders were obeyed, and the sounding 
shouted by the man who handled the lead line. 

The river was very deep, but as no good chart existed, and 
it was dark, extra caution was being used, and all was going 
on well. In another minute she would have rounded the 
bend of the island and been in full chase of the fleet enemy, 
when just as the man had shouted out the depth, there was a 
sudden shock, which threw several men off their legs, and to the 
dismay of all, the steamer was tightly fixed upon a mudbank, 
every effort to release her only seeming to make her settle 
more firmly down. And this at a moment when her presence 
might serve to change the fortunes of the attack being made 
upon the residency. 



CHAPTER XL. 



HOW PRIVATE GRAY WENT A FISHING. 

Private Gray had hard work to seem composed as he went 
away to execute his orders. The remarks of Captain Smithers 
had come like an endorsement of his own suspicions, and in 
imagination he saw the island given over to violence and rapine, 
as a large force of savage Malays who resented the coming of the 
English took advantage of the present state of weakness and 
carried all before them. 

He felt as if a strange pallor was taking the place of the ruddy, 
sunburnt hue of his face, and he turned sick as he thought of 
Miss Linton and her cousin j of the major's wife, and those of 
several of the soldiers. 

It would be horrible, he thought; but the next moment his 
strength of nerve returned, and feeling that the safety of all might 
depend upon the energy he displayed in his mission, he hurried 
on towards the fort 

As he went along under the shade of the trees, he recalled 
that which he had seen when on duty a night or two back, and 
wondered whether there was any cause for suspicion in the boat 
he believed that he had seen over the dark river gliding in so 
shadowy a way. Then he remembered the sounds he had 
heard ; and lastly, he recalled various little things in Abdullah's 
behaviour, that, trifles in themselves, now seemed to be strangely 
significant. 

By this time he reached the fort, on entering which he found 
Sergeant Lund perspiring profusely, as with big clumsy unsuited 
hands he fingered a pen, and wrote laboriously his report, while 
Private Sim, who had not declared himself ill for a week, lay back 
under a tree fast asleep. 

He was a very unlovely man was Private Sim, especially when 
asleep, for at this time he opened his mouth very wide, and 
around it the busy flies were flitting;, evidently taking it for the 




flower oi some new kind of orchis or carnivorous plant> and they 
buzzed about and around it as if enjoying tbe fun of going as 
near as they could without quite getting into danger. That it 
was a fly-trap one big sage-looking insect seemed certain, for he 
settled on the tip of Private Sim's nose, and seemed to be en- 
gaged in making sudden flights and buzzings at young unwary 
flies as they came near and into danger, driving them away from 
the yawning cavern just below. 

Gray smiled to himself as these ideas flashed across his brain, 
and then he walked up to the sergeant 

* ' Which ¡ª which ¡ª that ¡ª which ¡ª or which ¡ª but which ¡ª in 
which ¡ª for which ¡ª to which ¡ª phew ! this is hot work, I wondei 
which would be best. Ah ! Gray, sit down here a minute, my 
lad, and tell me what to say. I've been hours over this 
report." 

" I am off on special business directly, sergeant," said Gray ; 
" but let me see." 

He read over the sergeant^s report, and then dictated half-a- 
dozen lines, which that officer wrote down as quickly as he could. 
" I shall copy it out afterwards," he said, " neat and clean. Go 
on, my lad, go on." 

Gray dictated a few more lines, which ended the report in a 
short, concise manner, and Sergeant Lund's face, which had 
been all in corrugations, smoothed itself into a satisfied 

smile. 

" That's beautiful," he said, looking up at the private admir- 
ingly. " I shall copy that all out in a neat hand, and the thing's 
done. I say. Gray, how do you do it ? Here, what takes me 
hours, only takes you minutes \ and while it's hard labour to me 
to get it into shape, you run it off" like string from a ball, Thanky, 
my lad, thanky. Now what can I do for you ?" 

'* I want a bayonet and a revolver, with ammunition, directly," 

said Gray. 

" What for ? " 

" Captain's orders, and private," said Gray, showing Captain 
Smithers' card, with a few lines pencilled thereon. 

"Right," said the sergeant bluffly. ** I'm not an inquisitive 
man. Come along. Gray." 

He led the way into the part of the fort used as an armoury, 
and furnished the required weapons, which Gray proceeded to 
button up under his jacket. 

" Oh ! that's the game is it, my lad ? " he said. " Then look 
here ; don't take those clumsy tools ; any one can see that 
you've got weapons hidden there. I'll lend you this little 




revolver ; it's handier, and will do quite as much mischief. You 
can have this dirk, too, with the belt." 

He brought out a handsome little revolver, about half the 
weight and size of the hea\7 military " Colt " previously supplied; 
and also a well made, long, thin dirk, with a thin belt. 

" There, my lad ! " he said, buckling on the belt under Gray's 
jacket, and then thrusting the revolver into a little leather pouch. 
" There, you are now fitted up sensibly, and no one would be the 
wiser. Stop a moment, you must fill your pocket with cartridges. 
Let me have those things back safe, and I hope you won't have 
to use them ; but being ready, my lad, is half the battle. You 
know I'm never ill." 

" No, sergeant ; you have excellent health." 

" Right, my lad, I do ; and I'll tell you why : I bought the 
biggest box of pills I could get before I left London. Four-and- 
six I gave for it, and I have never taken one. Diseases come, 
and they know as well as can be that I've got that box of 
big pills ¡ª reg'lar boluses ¡ª in my kit ; and they say to them- 
selves, 'This man's ready for action, with his magazine well 
stored ! ' and they go somewhere else." 

" I see, sergeant," said Gray, smiling. "Good-bye! " 

" Good-bye, my lad, good-bye. Here, nobody's looking. 
Sim's asleep. Shake hands, my lad, shake hands. You see, 
as your superior officer that's a bit of stooping on my part ; 
but, between man and man, I, Sergeant Lund, look up to you, 
Private Gray, and always feel as if we ought to change 
places." 

" Good-bye, sergeant," said Gray, shaking hands warmly with 
the sergeant, " and I echo your wish that I may not have to use 
the weapons ; keep a sharp look out." 

" You leave that to me, private," said the bluff sergeant, and 
he nodded his head as Gray went off upon his mission. 

It was rather an awkward one, for he wished to watch Abdullah 
without exciting his attention. Gray thought, however, that he 
might prove a match for the Malay, and as he wandered slowly 
along he begari to consider what he should do ? 

The first idea that suggested itself was that he should go to 
Dullah and sit there and eat fruit ; but he discarded the idea 
directly as too palpable a way of watching. He felt that the 
Malay would suspect him directly, as he was not a man who was 
in the habit of visiting the hut. 

No ; he must have some better plan than that, but no idea 
struck him for a few minutes, till happening to glance at the flow- 
ing river, the notion came, and ^oing straijxht back he was soon 



after seen sauntering down to the river, armed with a long 
bamboo, a fishing line, and some bait, with which he proceeded 
to fish as soon as he reached the river, but having no sport he 
began to grow impatient, fishing here and there, but alwaj^ 
getting nearer to Dullah's hut, where he remained seated on 
the bank, fishing very perseveringly to all appearance, and occa- 
sionally landing a little barbel-like fellow, known by the natives 
as Ikan Sambilang, or fish of nine, from the number of little 
barbs beneath its mouth. 

Gray fished on, never once turning his head to see what was 
going on at the hut, but making the keenest use of his ears. He 
made out, while landing a fish or re-baiting his hook, that there 
were a couple of sampans lying there, in which were some 
Malays who appeared to be basking in the sunshine ; and soon 
after his quick ears told him plainly enough that some one, whom 
he believed to be DuUah, was approaching. 

As the Malay came nearer, it was to find Gray's rod Ijdng in 
the water, and the soldier, apparently overcome by the heat, 
sitting in a heap, witli his chin down upon his chest, regardless 
of the fact that a little fish was upon its hook, tugging away to 
get free. 

Dullah seemed about to speak to the intruder ; but seeing this, 
he refrained, contenting himself with examining Gray closely, 
and then going slowly back. 

" That will not do to report," thought Gray. " He saw me 
fishing, and he came to see what I had caught, and then went 
away. I must have something better than that" 

However, he had obtained a position whence, unsuspected, he 
could sit and watch what went on at the hut \ for after satisfying 
himself as he had, it was not likely that the Malay would trouble 
himself any more about the presence of the private so near his 
place. 

So Gray sat there, apparently fast asleep, all through the after- 
noon. 

The night closed in as the sun went down rapidly, as is the 
case near the equator, and still Gray felt that he had nothing 
to report. Two men rose up once in the sampan nearest to 
Duilah's hut, but they appeared to lie down again amongst their 
fruit baskets ; and Dullah himself, the last time Gray saw him, 
was seated peacefully smoking by his verandah. 

As it became dark. Gray ran over in his mind the positions 
of the various sentries, and thought of how soon he could get 
help, should he need it ; and then, after a little thought, he came 





to the conclusion that he ought to make his way to the fort, and 
tell Captain Smithers of his want of success. 

Just then the glimmering of the stars in the water put an idea 
in his head. He paused for a moment, as the proceeding was so 
risky ; but on consideration he felt that, if he carried out his 
plan, he would know for certain whether mischief was brewing. 
So, giving up his intention of going back to the fort at present, 
he proceeded to put his plan into execution. 



CHAPTER XLI. 



THE VALUE OF PRIVATE SIM. 

Whkre Adam Gray had been seated fishing the bank was about 
three feet above the surface of the water, and this clayey bank 
was either perpendicular, or so hollowed out beneath by the 
action of the river, that if any one had the courage to lower 
himself into the water, here about four feet deep, and to cling to 
the tangled vegetation, and wade along close to the over-hanging 
bank, he could pass right up to Dullah's hut unperceived- 

There was danger, of course ; for the stream ran swiftly, and 
the venturesome wader might be swept away. A crocodile, too, 
might be lurking beneath the bank ; but the business was so 
important that Gray resolutely set his face against the idea ot 
danger, telling himself that it was his duty ; and leaving his rod 
upon the bank, he quietly lowered himself into the river, 
the cold water sending a sharp shock through him as he 
stood, breast high, holding on by some tangled roots, while the 
water pressed against him, with no little force, as it ran. 

He paused there for a few minutes listening, half fancying that 
he had heard a noise, and that the slight splash he made might 
have been noted by Dullah or the men on the sampans ; and as 
he listened, sure enough there was a dull noise, as of a blow, 
followed by a little rustling, and then, just above his head, he 
could hear somebody breathing hard, as if after some exer- 
tion. 

Gray did not stir ; and fortunately he was quite concealed by 
the overhanging bank, as a Malay, down upon his hands and 

knees, leaned over the edge and looked up and down the 

river. 

For the moment Gray felt that he must be seen, and his hand 
stole involuntarily towards his breast in search of a weapon ; 
but he was in utter darkness beneath the bank, and the man's 
eyes were more directed outward. 

The result was that the Malay, who, kris in hand, had crept 




cautiously irom DuUah's hut right up through the undergrowth 
and long grass to where he believed the Englishman to be fishing, 
drew cautiously back, and crept once more away. 

Gray remained motionless for a few moments, and then, 
convinced that this meant ill to him, he began to wade cautiously 
along towards where the sampans lay in the stream, some thirty 

yards away. 

He moved very slowly, so as to nvake no plash in the water, 
which sometimes, as the river shallowed, came only to his waist, 
while at other times it nearly reached his chin ; and had he not 
clung tightly to the water-washed roots and depending bushes, he 
must have been swept away. 

Gray had gone about half the distance ; and as he neared the 
sampans, whose forms he vainly tried to make out in the dark- 
ness, to his horror, he found that something was moving towards 
him in the water. 

Quick as lightning he drew the long, keen dirk from his belt, 
and stood ready to thrust, for it was either a crocodile or some 
large animal, he felt sure; but directly after he stood holding 
on by his left hand to a bunch of tangled root hanging from the 
bank, and felt his heart seem to stand still, for, to his surprise, 
he plainly made out that it was a man, wading in the opposite 
direction, and evidently for a similar purpose to his own. 

It was, in fact, one of the Malays from the nearest sampan, 
who, while a companion had undertaken to stalk the Englishman 
from the shore, as he sat there asleep, had set off from the boat, 
meaning to get there at the same time as his friend, but had 
miscalculated the period it would take. 

He was now coming along cautiously, and had nearly reached 
Gray in the darkness before he became aware of his presence. 

As soon, though, as he made out that it was the Englishman who 
was before him, he made a lunge forward, striking at Gray with 
his kris j but the latter avoided the blow and prepared to close 
with his antagonist, feeling as he took a step back, that the 
result would probably be death for both, for they must be swept 
away by the swift stream. 

Just then the Malay seemed to leap at him, but at the same 
moment he uttered a smothered cry, which was silenced directly 
by the rushing water, and Gray found that he was alone. 

He needed no telling that one of the loathsome reptiles of the 
river had been close at hand, and had seized his enemy ; his 
wonder was that he himself had not been the victim. 

It was enough to paralyze the bravest heart, and for a few 
minutes Gray clung to the roots of the tree beside him, feeling 




sick and giddy, and as if some reptile was only waiting for his 
next movement to drag him down. 

It was fortunate for him that he did not stir, for the Malay's 
cry had alarmed his companions, who could be heard talking 
quickly and in whispers, close at hand. 

At first it seemed to Gray that they were coming to the help 
of their unfortunate companion, but this did not prove to be 
the case. They knew what had happened, from old experience, 
and accepted the accident as one of the misfortunes to which 
they were heirs, troubling themselves no more about the matter. 

Recovering himself somewhat, but feeling all the time that any 
moment he might be seized, Gray crept once more slowly along, 
till he stood with the water nearly to his shoulders, beneath the 

overhanging bank, by Dullah*s hut, and between it and the two 
sampans. 

The place was admirably suited for concealment, for now 
little more than his head was above water, and that he had con- 
trived should lie behind a screen of drooping verdure, which 
made his chilly hiding-place so dark that he could not have been 
seen twelve inches away. 

Having escaped from the reptiles so far, he felt more hope- 
ful ; and as he stood there, behind his screen, he began to try 
and make his position valuable. 

He had not long to wait for this. In less than a minute, a 
voice, that he took for Abdullah's, was whispering to some one 
on the river, and a sampan came so close in to the bank that 
had he stretched out his hand he could have touched the side. 

It was a grief to him that he was not thoroughly conversant 
with the Malay tongue, but he had picked up a good deal, and 
had mastered a sufficiency to catch the import of the words 

he heard. 

The principal was an order that the orang should come 
ashore, the order being given by DuUak 

What was the orang i 

He puzzled for a few moments, as the sampan pushed off. 
Orang-outang I Was this after all a trading visit, and they were 
going to bring some great monkey ashore. 

Orang-outang ¡ª man of the woods, of course. Orang meant 
man or men, and the men were to land. There was danger 
then, and men were to land. That was enough, and now he 
would go and give warning ; but he could not move without 
being heard, and he had to remain listening, as there was 
the faint beat of oars, and then, though he could hardly see 
them, two lont; row boats of great size seemed to come up out 





of the darkness, and he felt more than saw that they were full 
of men. 

What was the sentry about ? There was one so near that he 
ought to have seen or heard their coming, and Gray listened 
eagerly for the report of his piece giy'ir\g the alarm. 

But no report came, for the sentry had not heard. He had 
not been krissed, but as far as giving alarm was concerned 
he might have been dead; for the sentry close at hand was 
Private Sim, and he was fast asleep. 



CHAPTER XLIL 



WHY DULLAH CAME TO THE ISLE, 



Every moment that passed was more convincing to Adam 
Gray that DuUah was a traitor, and at the head of affairs for 
making a descent upon the island. In place of two long row 
boats, each carrying some fifty or sixty men, it was evident now 
that there were four, and they were being cautiously forced up 
to the landing-place, where, under the orders of Dullah, several 
men ashore were ready to make them fast 

Directly after, coming like a revelation, Gray learned what 
a snake they had had concealed in the grass at the jungle- 
station ; for as he listened, intently watching the while for an 
opportunity to escape, he heard Dullah's voice, and then those 
of his men addressing him as rajah. Directly after he heard a 

voice on one of the large boats asking for Rajah Gantang, which 
was replied to by Dullah. 

There was the secret then of this man's presence on the island. 
It was Rajah Gantang himself who had come among them, to 
seek his opportunity for overthrowing the English, and now 
his opportunity had come. 

Gray ground his teeth with rage at his impotence, and he tried 
to get away unperceived, as it became evident that the nearest 
sentry heard nothing. Still at any moment there might come 
the warning shot from his rifle ; for though everything was very 
plain to him, hidden in the midst of the Malays, it was quite 
horrible that not a sound might reach the most attentive of 
sentries, especially as every word was spoken in a whisper. 

It seemed impossible to get away without discovery. The 
slightest movement would have made his presence known, so 
closely had the boats come in. 

Still no alarm was raised. 

Then Gray began hoping that Captain Smithers or Ensign 
ix>ng nngnt be going the rounds, and his dread was lest they 





should fall into some trap. It was for him, then, to warn them, 
but how? 

The water was very cold, and seemed to Gray to be the 
cause of the chill that struck to his heart as he stood there 
wondering, and listened to what was evidently a rapid de- 
barkation. 

Suddenly, as in imagination, he saw these merciless men 
gaining an entry to the fort and massacring all there, he recalled 
the fact that he possessed a pistoL A shot or two from that 
would give alarm to the sentries. 

And bring certain death upon himself I 

Well, he thought, as he paused for a few moments, why not ? 
If he, by giving up his life could save those at the fort ¡ª his 
officers, comrades, the ladies, and the rest, ought he to hesitate 
¡ª would he be doing more than his duty ? 

It was a hard struggle. Life was very sweet, and he had but 
to remain perfectly still to escape. Did he move, a dozen spears 
and krisses would be at his breast directly. 

He smiled as he told himself he was not hesitating, but that 
all he wished to do was his duty; and without a moment's 
hesitation he drew the little revolver from its pouch, held it out 
as high as he could, and drew the trigger. 

For answer there came a sharp click, and he knew that the 
water had damaged the cartridge. 

He tried again, with no other result than the noise of the 
fall of the hammer; and then DuUah's, or Rajah Gantang's, voice 
was heard in a reproving tone as he bade his men be silent 

Gray tried again, but for tho third time the cartridges, soaked 
as they were by being under water so long, refused to go off. But 
at his fifth and sixth pulls there were a couple of lines of light, 
and Gray felt astonished as he heard how loud were the reports 
the little weapon made. 

For with a couple of bright flashes that seemed to the 
astonished Malays to come out of the surface of the river, there 
were as many echoing reports, and as they rang out they were 
answered by sentry after sentry about the island, the last shot 
being fired by Private Sim, close at hand, after which he ran for 
his life. 

There was a* sharp keen order at this, and the boats' heads 
were forced up to the bank, one of their prows crushing right 
in upon Gray even to touching him, but saving his life for the 
moment, as it concealed his position from the enemies, who 
were vainly trying to make out in the darkness who had given 
the alarm. 




Gray had not a moment to lose ; already spears were being 
thrust beneath the bank to right and left of him. His only 
chance was to dive right beneath the keel of the nearest boat 
and swim down the river for his life. 

He did not pause to think of the risk ¡ª the alarm had been 
given, and he had the satisfaction of knowing that every one 
would be on the alert ¡ª as he dived down, passed beneath the 
keel of the first boat, and then beneath the next, keeping under 
water all he could till he was fifty yards or so from the nearest 
prahu, when he struck out for the shore. 

The current ran very strong where he now was, and soon 
took him beyond reach of pursuit ; but it had its disadvantages, 
for as he swam he felt that if he did not use every effort he 
would be swept right down the river. And now, too, came the 
dread of the crocodiles, and he swam on, expecting each moment 
to feel the teeth of one of the monsters, and to be snatched down 
into the depths of the river to a horrible death. 

Meanwhile, shots were being fired on the island; he heard 
drum and bugle calling to the muster, and relieved of the fear 
that Captain Smithers would be surprised, he fought on manfully 
with the swift stream. 

His efforts seemed in vain, for though he had contrived to 
get pretty close to the shore, the current ran so strong that he 
saw himself swept by the dark line of trees and into the stream 
below. 

His only hope now seemed to be to make for the steamer, 
whose lights he could see below him ; but involuntarily almost 
he turned and made a fresh effort to reach the island, when, to 
his great delight, he found himself in a strong eddy, and after 
five minutes' swimming he was able to catch at the overhanging 
branches of a tree and draw himself up close to the muddy 
bank, where he remained, panting for a few minutes, longing to 
draw himself out on to dry land, but too weak and exhausted, 
half paralyzed too, as he thought of how the great reptiles had 
their haunts in the hollows beneath the river's banks. 

At last, though, his heart beat less painfully, and he gently 
reached up one hand above the other, made a strong effort, and 
then lay panting beneath the trees, with the water running from 
him in a stream. ' 

Safe from the water and the creatures that haunted the river, 
he had yet to thread his way through the ranks of human tigers 
who were now swarming about the island, as he could tell 
by the flashes and reports of the rifles that were being fired on 
either side. 



He lay there for quite ten minutes, thinking of what would be 
his best plan to pursue, for he had a double peril to encounter 
¡ª namely, the spears of the Malays, and the bullets of his 
comrades, who would be certain to fire at any one they saw 
approaching. Still nothing presented itself to his mind, and he 
at last began to move cautiously forward towards the little fort. 

As he went on through the dense growth with which this part 
of the island was covered, he became aware that the Malays were 
making quite a furious attack upon the place, while it was just 
as evident that they were encountering a serious resistance. To 
his great delight now the field-piece began to speak, and he had 
seen the rocket go up, as a signal to the ship, the bright stars 
lighting up the patch of jungle where he lay to such an extent 
that he shrank close down beneath some shrubs, lest he should 
form a mark for the spear of some Malay. 

Going so slowly and cautiously, it took him some time to get 
near the lines, and then he had to pause, for the flashes and 
reports of the rifles showed him where his enemies were lying, 
and twice over he nearly walked into the midst of a little group 
hiding amidst the trees. 

He had taken the precaution of reloading the little revolver, 
though all the time feeling greatly in doubt as to whether the 
cartridges were not spoiled ; and consequently he relied most 
of all upon his dirk, though he felt that his only chance would 
be to steal through the Malays, and then make a bold dash for 
the gate, shouting the password as he ran. 

He was compelled to crawl as he drew near, for the bullets 
whistled through the trees, cutting off" leaf and twig, and search- 
ing the jungle, as it were, for the enemy, who seemed all around 
him ; for, go which way he would, there was always a party close 
at hand. 

At last, though, he crawled behind some trees, with only an 
open space between him and the fort. He was waiting his 
opportunity; and the moment a sharp, scattered burst of firing 
was over, he rose and ran for his life. 



CHAPTER XLIII. 



TOM LONG HEADS A SALLY PARTY, 

As Adam Gray ran through the darkness, a yell arose from behind 
him, telling him that his act had been seen, and, as if to prevent 
him, half-a-dozen spears came whizzing through the air, one of 
them so close that it grazed his arm ; while, to make matters 
worse, the firing recommenced from the fort. 

By dint of shouting strongly he made himself known, and the 
firing ceased, giving him time to run up to the breastwork, and 
then along it to the gateway, now doubly shut ; but after a little 
parley he was admitted, and found himself in the presence of 
Captain Smithers and Ensign Long. 

" Ah, Gray ! " exclaimed the former, " I had given you up. 
Were those your shots that gave the alarm ? " 

Gray said they were, and in a few concise words told what he 
"had seen. 

" Yes," said Captain Smithers, " we are in for it ; but our friends 
have a tougher job than they imagined." 

During the next half-hour, while they were keeping the enemy 
at bay, they became aware of the fact that an engagement was 
going on between the steamer and some enemy unseen by them, 
though they immediately set it down as being with boats. The 
return signal had been seen, and there was no little comfort in 
the knowledge that the occupants of the steamer were at hand to 
co-operate with and help them, though they little thought of how 
soon the vessel would be rendered almost helpless. 

With the daylight, which was most gladly welcomed, came the 
news that the corvette was ashore ; and on Captain Smithers 
turning round to speak to Ensign Long, he found that young 
gentleman slapping his legs, bending down with laughter, and 
altogether behaving in an exceedingly indecorous manner for 
an officer and a gentleman. 

" Why, Long ! " exclaimed Captain Smithers, " what does this 
mean ? " 





Tom Long flushed up as red as a turkey-cock, and looked at 
his superior officer in the most shamefaced way, 

" I¡ª I¡ª I¡ª" he began, 

" Why, I believe you were delighted to hear that the steamer 
was aground." 

" Well, no, sir ; not that the steamer is aground," said Tom. 
" I ¡ª I ¡ª was not sorry, thougli, that Roberts had made a mess 
of it. He is so bounceable, sir." 

" I'm ashamed of you, Long !" said Captain Smithers 
severely. ** This is no time for silly, boyish spite. Take ten 
men, and make your way down to within hailing distance of the 
vessel, and ask what they mean to do ¡ª hold the corvette, or 
come and take their chance with us ? At once, sir, and act like 
a man." 

Tom Long saluted, and getting Sergeant Lund and nine men, 
made his way out of the little sally-port, and led them along at 
the double, beneath the shelter of the fire from the fort, till they 
were opposite the dense grove of trees which lay between them 
and the steamer. 

It was an awkward and a dangerous task, for not only was 
the piece of forest growth swarming with enemies, but from time 
to time a shot or two from the marines on board the vessel came 
whistling through the trees. 

But Tom Long was smarting from his rebuke. He wanted to 
act like a man, and at heart he knew he had been behaving 
like a boy oi a verj petty disposition, so, with Captain Smithers' 
words yet ringing in his ears, he formed up his men, gave the 
word, and in skirmishing order they dashed through the trees, 
sending the Malays, after they had thrown a few spears, helter- 
skelter to right and left, save a few who were driven out in sight 
of the men on board the steamer, when a few shots sent them oflf 
into cover. 

'* Phew !" ejaculated Sergeant Lund, taking off his cap to wipe 
his wet forehead, and gazing admiringly at the ensign. " That's 
warm work, sir." And then he glanced at the men, who were 
delighted with what they called the ensign's pluck. 

"Warm? yes, sergeant. Quick! some of you fire at those 
niggers ; they are coming back." 

A little volley at half-a-dozen Malays, who were showing 
menacingly on their left, sent them to the right-about, and 
then the men cheered, their cheer being answered from the 
steamer, which was only about thirty or forty yards from the shore. 

" Ensign Long, ahoy ! " cried Bob Roberts, leaping on to the 
bulwarks. " What cheer ? " 


" If you mean how are we getting on, and are we all safe, 
why don't you say so ? " cried the ensign sharply. 

" All right, sir. 1*11 write you a memorandum and a report," 
said Bob Roberts. " Now then, how are you ? " 

" Captain Smithers wants to know whether you are coming 
ashore or going to stay on board." 

**Stay on board, Mr Long," said the lieutenant, who had 
come up. " Are you all well ? *' 

'' Yes, sir, all well." 

*' None wounded ? " 

" No, sir, not one as yet" 

" Tell Captain Smithers that my duty is to stay here with the 
steamer; but if he is hard pressed I will either send him a party 
of sailors and marines, or else we will cover his retreat with his 
gun, if he will come and take refuge on board." 

" Captain Smithers cannot leave his entrenched position, sir," 
said Tom Long stiffly ; " but we can find room for you and 
your crew, if they like to come." 

Tom Long said this so importantly that Bob Roberts began to 
laugh; and no doubt some sharp bandying about of words 
would have followed, had not Lieutenant Johnson said rather 
sternly, ¡ª 

" Tell Captain Smithers, Mr Long, that a rocket sent up by 
night, or three calls of the bugle given sharply without any 
perceptible interval, will bring help from us ; but ask him if any 
steps can be taken to help the expedition." 

" Captain Smithers is of opinion, sir, that the expeditionary 
party is strong enough to take care of itself, and that it is our 
duty to¡ª Oh ! " 

Tom Long blushed for it afterwards ; but a well-thrown 
spear came so close to his ear that he could not avoid an in- 
voluntary cry. The next minute his little party were under 
cover of some trees, and slowly driving back a body of Malays, 
who, however, would have out-flanked them, but for a brisk 
fire kept up on them from the steamer, when they disappeared 
once more into the jungle, with which this part of the island 
was overgrown. When after a few more words with the occupants 
of the steamer, during which Lieutenant Johnson impressed 
upon the ensign that the best thing to be done was to act entirely 
on the defensive, the little sally party started to return, the 
lieutenant promising to do all he could to cover their retreat. 

The distance was not great, but full of peril ; for the minute 
the ^lalays comprehended that Tom Long's party were going 
back, they began to swarm out of their lurking-places, and it 




now became evfdent that hundreds of fighting men must have 
landed on the island. 

"Well, sir/' said Sergeant Lund, wiping his face, as, after 
getting about half-way back, the little party found themselves 
hedged up in a little gully by Malay spears, wiiose holders kept 
themselves hidden behind the trees, ¡ª " well, sir, this is hot, and 
no mistake/' 

** Yes," said Tom Long, excitedly; "but be careful, my lads, 
don't waste a shot ; you must be getting short" 

" The/ve only about six rounds each, sir, now," said the ser- 
geant ; " but they've got the bayonets." 

" Yes," said Tom, as he stood sword in one hand, revolver in 
the other \ " but we mustn't let them get at us with their spears, 
I can't leave a man behind, sergeant." 

" Then we'd better stop as we are for a few minutes, and get 
breath, sir, and then see which is the best way to go." 

The sergeant hurried to a couple of the men who were expo? 
ing themselves a little too freely, and then returned to Tom 
Long, who was standing in the middle of two sides of a triangle 

composed of four men a side, and another forming the apex. 

" I'd make a dash for it, sergeant," said the ensign, " only I 
should be sure to lose some of the boys ; while \i we stop here 
we shall get speared. It's a puzzle, isn't it ? I say, I don't feel 
half so ¡ª so ¡ª " 

"Scared, sir?" 

" Well, yes ; I didn't like to say frightened, sergeant/' replied 
Tom, smiling, "because it sounds %o queer." 

" Ah, sir, you might say anything now before the lads, they 
wouldn't mind ; and after the plucky way you led us on, they'd 
follow you anywhere. But hadn't we better let the enemy have 
a few shot, sir? They're closing in fast." 

Tom Long was about to give the order for which his men 
were anxiously waiting, when he became aware of something 
going on in a clump of palms about forty yards away. 

" What are they doing there, sergeant ? " he said. " Look !'' 

"Getting ready for a rush, sir. Hadn't we better form 
square?" 

" No ; only close up a little," said Tom, sharply, as he set his 
teeth ; for he knew that they were on the brink of a hand-to- 
hand encounter. 

For though pretty well screened by the trees, it was evident 
that a large party of the Malays were getting ready for a rush, 
when bang ¡ª crash^ there was the report of a gun from the steamer, 
followed almost instantly by the bursting of a shell in the y^T'j 




thick of the trees where the Malays had gathered, with the result 
that there was quite an opening rent in that part of the jungle, 
and the threatening party was scattered like chaff. 

" That's what I calls the prettiest shot I ever see,'* said one of 
the men. 

"Forward !" shouted Tom Long, and taking advantage of the 
momentary panic, he hurried his little party on at the double, 
with the result that by the time the Malays again menaced an 
attack, the sally-party were under cover of the guns at the fort, 
and a few minutes later, amidst the cheers of those they had left 
behind, Tom Long led his little party within the gates, not a 
man amongst them having received a scratch. 



CHAPTER XLIV. 



HOW CAPTAIN SMITHERS MADE PLANS. 

There was plenty to do to make the little fort secure, and well 
the men worked- Double their number would not have been 
too strong a garrison, for the Malays mustered thickly now on all 
sides, save that nearest the ship, whose heavy guns had taught 
them the risk of making any display of their presence. 

Captain Smithers would have gladly joined forces with Lieu- 
tenant Johnson, but he was not surprised at his reply, and he 
could only condole with him in respect to the accident that had 
occurred to the steamer, one which would pardy place it hors de 
combat until some flood should cause a rise in the water of the 
river. 

The men vied with each other in executing the orders that 
were given, and in a short time the mess-room and quarters were 
so strengthened that once within, the men felt that the only 
enemy they had to fear was fire, and that they hoped to avoid 
by means of their rifles, and, if needs be, their bayonets. 

It was a terrible time for the women, many of whom had 
husbands with the expedition ; but knowing as they did that the 
major's lady was in the same position as themselves, they tried 
hard to follow her calm and patient example. 

It was only an outward calm though, for poor Mrs Major 
Sandars was suffering keenly, though she tried hard and suc- 
cessfully to speak words of comfort to Rachel Linton and her 
cousin, both of whom went about with her, talking to the soldiers' 
wives, and trying to amuse the children, who at times grew im- 
patient at being forced to keep inside the walls of the barracks, 
the outer enclosure having been long declared unsafe. 

Captain Smithers had sought the ladies, and spoken a few 
words of encouragement to them, gazing very hard at Miss 
Linton as he said, ¡ª 

" You may rely upon us, Miss Linton. I would lay down my 
life sooner than harm should befall you-" 




" I am quite satisfied of that, Captain Smithers," said the lady, 
quietly. " I believe that of the meanest man here. In the 
meantime, I presume that you would like us all to keep within 
the walls." 

" Yes, if you please, Miss Linton," said the young officer, 
coldly ; and then, as he walked away, he muttered, " Yes, she 
believes that of the meanest soldier, and thinks as much of him 
as of me." 

He walked across the open space to the lines where the men 
were placed, the intention being to hold them for the time, and 
if hard pressed, to retire within the barracks and there make 
their stand. 

As he went to the nearest point a bullet whizzed by him, 
sufRciently near to show him that the Malays had not only good 
weapons among them, but men who could shoot straight ; and 
he frowned as he felt that their chance would be but small if under 
some clever leader the Malays should make a bold eifort to take 
the place. 

On reaching the earthworks that surrounded the enclosure, 
every man was in his place, silent and watchful. The order had 
been given that no one was to fire except to check an advance, 
for though ammunition was abundant, Captain Smithers felt that it 
was impossible to tell how long they might be besieged, so he 
determined to economise as much as possible. Consequently, 
firing from the fort was only at intervals, and as the Malays relied 
principally upon their spears, the ball was not kept up with any- 
thing like vigour ; but, all the same, certain movements on the 
part of the enemy warned the temporary commandant to be 
careful, as it would be craft more than open assault with which 
he would have to deal 

After completing his round and saying a few words to the men, 
he stood thinking on the side nearest the river, from which he 
was only separated by a space of about forty yards, and he 
could not help thinking how their position would be strength- 
ened if the steamer could be got off and moored here, a trench 
being opened fioni stem and stern to connect it with the fort. 
This would be giving the latter a most powerful river front, 
Dullah*s hut, which stood there, could easily be razed, and he 
knew that the water was deeper there than at any part of the 
river ¡ª quite sufficient to float the steamer. 

It seemed a risky thing to do ¡ª to send again ; but he felt that 
he ought to apprise Lieutenant Johnson of his ideas, and to 
request him to use every effort to get the steamer off. 

** As if he would not do that for his own sake," he muttered 





directly ditex ; and then he began to consider whom he should 
send 

Adam Gray immediately suggested himself to his mind, and 
his brow knitted as he felt that it was like trying to get rid of a 
man he disliked. 

" He is the most trustworthy, and the best suited for the task/' 

he said directly; and as the words left his lips he raised his 
eyes, and saw the object of his thoughts come with a dozen more 
men to relieve the party nearer him. 

*'Fall out, Gray," he said sharply; and Gray looked at him 
curiously as he stepped back out of the ranks. 

" I want a message conveyed on board the steamer, Gray," 
said Captain Smithers. " She lies about fifty yards off the other 
side of the island, aground on the mud. Do you think you can 
reach her?" 

" I shall do my best, sir," said Gray, quietly. " If I do not 
succeed, you ynW know it is because I am down." 

" But you must not go dovm, Gray," said Captain Smithers, 
hastily. "You cannot be spared. This is a most important 
duty, and that is why I send you." 

The private's eyes were fixed on those of his captain most 
searchingly, and the latter lowered his own before those of his 
inferior. 

" I shall give you no written message, for fear that you may be 
taken, Gray," said Captain Smithers, hastily. **Take this verbal 
message, * Captain Smithers begs, for the sake of all, that 
Lieutenant Johnson will strive to get the steamer off, and bring 
her round here, to moor her close up to the bank, alongside of 

DuUah's hut.' Do you understand ? " 

" Yes, sir," said Gray, and he repeated the words. 
" That will do. Now go." 
?* At once, sir ? " 
**At once." 

Gray saluted, and with his teeth pressing his lip started off upon 
another risky mission. 

He met Ensign Long as he went back to the quarters, and on 
being questioned, he questioned in return, and obtained a few 
particulars, enough to make him determine to make his way up 
towards the head of the island, and there swim off, to try and get 
himself swept dowTi to the steamer, hoping to be seen and get on 
board without mishap, and in this spirit, arming himself once more 
as on his former expedition, he set ofi. 



CHAPTER XLV. 



THROUGH FIRE AND WATER. 

Private Gray was conscious that the ladies saw him start, and 
their eyes bade him succeed, or else it was his fancy. At all 
events the knowledge that he had their sympathy encouraged 
him, at a time when his heart was sore with the knowledge that 
Captain Smithers was selecting him for every dangerous service 
as if to get rid of him. 

Sergeant Lund nodded sagely, on receiving the application for 
the revolver. 

" All right, my lad," he said quietly. " I suppose I mustn't 
grumble at you for making it so rusty last time." 

" No, sergeant ; nor yet if I make it worse this time." 

" Another risky journey then, eh ? No, don't tell me, my lad. 
Go and do your duty; I'm not going to pump you." 

" I know that, sergeant, but it is no breach of confidence to 
ask your advice." 

" 'Course not, my lad. There you are ; fix 'em in tight. Now 
then, what is it ? I'm good at some things, so long as you don't 
ask me to put 'em down in writing." 

** If you wished to get to the steamer, sergeant, how would you 
proceed ? " 

" Oh, that's it, is it?" said the sergeant. *'Well then, you've 
got a risky job, my lad. But you'll do it. Well, if it was me I 
should wait till night, if I could." 

" And if you could not ? " 

" I should go just t'other way, to throw the Malay chaps oft 
their scent. Then work round to the head of the island, slip into 
the water, and swim down." 

" Exactly, sergeant," said Gray ; and he turned off to go. 

" He's as clever a young chap as ever I run against," said the 
sergeant, who, like a good many more people, fervently admired 
tliose who thought the same as he. " But what puzzles me more 
and more every day is how such a chap as him should come to 




be a common soldier. He's a gentleman, every inch of him. 
Why, didn't they get him to talk to the French officers when we 
landed at Ceylon, and the French frigate was there ? and my 
word, how he did jabber away ! He might have been a real 
mounseer. Well, 'taint no business of mine ; so long as he gets 
his accoutrements clean, and a good coating of pipe-clay on his 
belts, that's enough for me. I only wish there was more Grays 
and not so many Sims in the company." 

Meanwhile Adam Gray was on his way to the far side of the 
fort, very quiet and thoughtful as he made his plans, tjie first 
part of which was to go quietly to the ^^g^ of the earthwork, 
wait for his opportunity, and drop into the dry ditch, from which 
he hoped to crawl unperceived to the cover of the trees, about a 
hundred yards away. The rest, he felt, must be left to chance. 

As he reached the side he met Ensign Long, who came up to 
him, and to his great surprise shook hands. 

" Captain Smithers has told me of your mission. Gray," he 
said; "I wish you every success." 

" But you don't think, sir, that I shall succeed, and this is a 
friendly good-bye/ said Gray, smiling. 

*' Well I ¡ª that is ¡ª I ¡ª 'pon my word, Gray, you just hit what 
I was thinking about. You see I had such a narrow escape of 
it myself, that I couldn't help thinking of something of the kind" 

" You tried it openly, sir; I'm going to try and steal a march 
upon the Malays." 

" What, are you going over here ? " said the ensign. 

'* Yes, sir, and there's a good opening now," said Gray, after a 
sharp look round. " Good-bye, sir ; wish me luck" 

As he spoke he glided as it were over the edge of the earth- 
work, and let himself roll into the ditch, whence he made his 
way to the edge on the other side. Ensign Long bidding the two 
nearest men cover the messenger with their rifles as long as he 
was in sight 

That was not for long, Gray crawling rapidly over the ground ; 
and as tho-se who watched scanned every shrub and tree for an 
enemy, they saw him reach the edge of the jungle and disappear. 

It was into no haven of safety though that Gray had passed, 
for he had not gone twenty yards into the shadowy gloom, 
which was comparatively cool after the scorching sunshine in 
the opening that had been cleared of trees, before he heard 
voices on his left, and he had barely time to crouch down 
among the long grass before half-a-dozen Malays came along, 
one of whom saw the pressed down undergrowth and began 
to examine it curiously. 



Another moment and he would have seen Gray, whose hand 
was thrust into his breast, but a word from one of his com- 
panions took off his attention, and he disappeared with them 
amongst the trees. 

Gray drew a long breath as he once more started off, 
creeping on all fours, and at times crawling, so as to make 
sure of being unseen. 

His journey of about half a mile, measured by his twisting and 
turning, was one series of hairbreadth escapes. A dozen times 
over he had to turn and come back over almost precisely the 
same ground to avoid a party of Malays, who seemed ready to 
spring out of the earth on all sides of him, but still, thanks to the 
thick growth, he was unseen. Such a journey on their first 
landing would have been impossible, but as the men were 
hardly ever allowed to go on the mainland, they had, by way of 
compensation, pretty free access to the jungle portion of the 
little island, and in consequence they had trampled down the 
dense vegetation, and forced paths here and there through the 
cane brakes when snake hunting. 

At last, dripping with perspiration, Gray reached the head of 
the island, and lay half exhausted in a dense clump of canes, 
listening to the washing of the river as its waters divided a 
dozen or so of paces from where he lay. 

He could not see the river on account of the thick growth, 

but it sounded very cool and pleasant ; and now, having won his 
way thus far, he longed for the plunge and swim down to the 

steamer. 

He reckoned that a minute's law would place him beyond the 
reach of spears, however ably thrown ; and as to the enemy's 
rifles or muskets, he did not think they would be able to hit him 
as he swam with the rapid stream. Still he did not move, for he 
was so heated by his exertions that he dreaded risking cramp or 
shock from the sudden immersion. 

Everything was so still in the hot afternoon sunshine, that the 
whirring noise of the insects seemed quite loud. Beautiful 
blue-billed gapers, all claret and black and white, flitted about, 
catching glossy metallic-looking beetles ; little green chatterers, 
with their crested heads, fiew from spray to spray ; and tiny sun- 
birds, in their gorgeous mail of gold and bronze and purple, 
flew from flower to flower in search of honey. Now and then 
a scaly glistening lizard rustled by him, and twice over a snake 
crawled right across his body and away into the grass. Then 
a flock of the little love-bird paroquets came and settled in 
a tree hard by, piping, whistling, and chattering as they climbed 




and swung head downwards, or flew here and there ; while upon 
some bushes close at hand sat a pair of the lovely rose-breasted 
trogons, with their grey reticulated wings and beautiful cinnamon 
backs. 

It was a glorious scene for a lover of nature, so delicate were 
the many tints of green, so pure the sky above ; while to add to 
the beauty of the place a flock of rose-tinted doves settled in 
the palms, and cooed as mellowly as if this were in some park 
in the young soldier's far-off" home. 

So lovely was everything around that Gray closed his eyes, 
and was ready to ask himself whether the idea of danger was 
not all a dream, and that it was but fancy to suppose that blood- 
thirsty men were swarming in the island, ready to slaughter 
the inhabitants to a man. 

The sharp crack of a rifle, and then of half a dozen more, 
dissipated the dream, and with a sigh as he thought of the 
danger of those at the station, Gray unclosed his eyes, rose to 
his hands and knees from where he had been lying, and began to 
force his way softly amidst the canes. 

It was no easy task till he came to a track, evidently that 
made by a crocodile in coming and going from the river. He 
paused for a moment, shuddering as he thought of his danger ; 
then drawing the dirk, ready for a blow at the monster's eyes, 
should he encounter one, he crawled on, reached the water's edge 
in safety, parting the canes to peer up and down the river in 
search oi danger, and seeing none. 

From where he crouched the steamer was not visible, but he 
knew that a little bold swimming would soon show her lying 
below ; and, all the while feeling very much like as if he were a 
frog about to plunge into a stream haunted by pike, he lowered 
himself towards the water, gazed for a moment into its depths, 
and then plunged in. 

Down he went into the clear, cool stream, striking out so as 
to get well away from the bank as he did so, and then rising to 
the surface, to see, to his horror, that a good-sized boat, that 
had lain hidden amidst the reeds, was being pushed out, and with 
seven or eight occupants was coming in pursuit. 

What was he to do ? seek the shore again and take refuge in 
the jungle ? 

That seemed impossible ; for he had plunged in so close to 
the boat that he would have been speared long before he could 
reach the place he had left, even if he had been able to swim 
against the stream. 

Then, to his horror, he saw that the banks were perpendicular 




or else overhanging, and any attempt at climbing them from the 
water must have failed ; for, as far as he could see, where he was 
being swept down not a tree laved an overhanging branch in the 
swift stream. There was only one course open to him, and that 
was to trust to the river, and swim for his life. 

He had been taking this as his only chance as the above 
thoughts flashed through his brain ; and now came in the value 
of his old school-day experience, when he had been one of the 
bravest swimmers of his age. In fact, as he swam on, recollec- 
tions of the old alder and willow ait in the clear river came 
back, and he smiled as he turned upon his side and forced his 
way through the sparkling waters. 

The position as he made the side-stroke was convenient, 
though not inspiriting ; for as his cheek lay on the stream he 
could keep one eye upon his pursuers, who were now coming 
rapidly on. Fortunately for Gray, in their hurry and excitement 
the Malays had lost ground, so that the young soldier had a fair 
start before they bent regularly to their paddles. He could see, 
though, that a couple of men were standing upright in the boat, 
each with a foot upon the gunwale, and a spe^r poised in one hand, 
ready for hurling at the fugitive when within throwing distance. 

Gray swam swiftly, but he saw that it was hopeless, and that 
he must soon be overtaken and perish. Still he did not despair, 
for his career had before now seemed as near its end. Nil 

desperandum was the motto of his life, and like some hunted 
hare he kept his eye upon his pursuers, meaning to try and 
dive the moment he saw an effort made to hurl a spear. 

He might perhaps escape by diving. At all events, it was 

his only chance, and he swam on, with the boat now rapidly 
getting near. 

Perhaps, he thought, they might not throw, but wait to 
thrust at him. If so, that would ^\q him longer time ; but no, 
there was no chance of that, for now he saw one of the 
Malays poise his spear, and draw himself back, to throw it 
with all his force. 

Gray saw no more, but with a shuddering sensation, as he 
seemed to feel the deadly weapon pierce him between the 
shoulders, he made a tremendous effort, and dived down, 
swimming beneath the surface with all his might, till compelled 
to rise for breath. 

As his head appeared above water a spear grazed his 
shoulder, and another passed just over his ear when he dived 
again, still pursuing the same tactics, and swimming beneath 
the surface. 




Again he rose, and another spear splashed the water in his 
face, while the shaft of the next struck him a sharp rap, as 
the blade narrowly shaved his ear. 

Down once more ; but now he was weaker. The intense ex- 
citement and the need of breath exhausted him, and though he 
strove hard to keep down, his efforts began to prove vain. He 
had seen the last time that the boat was closer to him, and 
he felt sure that now on rising he should be within reach of 
one or other of the spearmen. 

Still he made another effort to keep below, for though he 
was suffocating, and began to feel confused, weak, and helpless, 
these moments were moments of life, whereas the instant he 
reached the surface he knew that all was owtr. 

In his confused, sense-benumbed state, he felt that after all he 
had done his duty, and he recalled the calm, trusting look 
directed at him by Miss Linton as he passed her that morning. 
Then the water above him grew lighter, and he rose to the sur- 
face, striking out but feebly now, as he saw the boat close at 
hand, heard a shout from the Malays, and saw one of the 
men in the bow lean over to thrust his spear into the help- 
less swimmer, now almost at his feet. 



CHAPTER XLVI. 

SHOWS HOW BOB ROBERTS GAVE A HINT, AND THE MALAYS 

GOT INTO HOT WATER. 

Hunter and hunted had been ahke too much occupi-ed to note 
what had been going on elsewhere. Gray's anxious gaze when 
he rose to the surface had been directed backward at his pur- 
suers, and for the time being the steamer and her occupants were 
forgotten. On the other hand, the Malays, keen on the scent of 
blood, intently watched the place where their quarry dived, and 
calculated where he would rise. 

So it was then that just as one of the men in the prow of 
the boat was about to savagely stab the nerveless swimmer, 
whose glazing eye met his with more of defiance than menace 
therein, there was a rattling volley from half-a-dozen rifles, the 
two spearmen fell over the side, to be swept away by the stream, 
and their companions, on starting up and seeing one of the 
steamer's cutters coming rapidly on, to a man leaped overboard 
and swam for their lives, some making for the island, some 
for the opposite shore, 

Adam Gray was so exhausted and surprised that it was some 
time before he realized that the danger was past, but that, unless 
he made a fresh effort, a new peril would await him, and he 
would lose his life by drowning. 

Just then, though, the Malay boat was swept close to him, 
and he threw one arm over the side, holding on till he was 
dragged into the cutter, which was then rowed rapidly back to 
the steamer. 

" That was a narrow squeak for you, Mr Soldier," said Bob 
Eoberts. " My marines only spoke up just in time." 

" I cannot find words to thank you now, sir," panted Gray, 
who was pale with exhaustion. 

"All right !" said Bob; and don't find any words to thank me 

by-and-by. I'm glad we were in time. You'd have done as 
much for any of us, my maa" 




*' Of course, sir ; of course," said Gray, huskily. 

"Yes, of course you would; but how came you in the 
river?" 

" I was swimming off with a message to Lieutenant Johnson, 
sir,*' replied Gray. 

" Then if I were you I wouldn't go such a long way round 
next time," said Bob. " Steady there, marines. Let them see 
you cover them, and they'll rush off behind the trees." 

This was in regard to some Malays who were showing them- 
selves menacingly on the edge of the river; but the moment 
they saw that the marines' rifles were directed at them they ran 
to cover, and the cutter was soon alongside of the steamer, 
the falls were hooked on, and the boat swung by the davits, her 
mission being at an end. 

Two anchors had been carried some distance out, steam got 
up, and with the screw going at high pressure and men at work 
at the capstan, every effort was being made to get the vessel 
out of her unpleasant position, but in vain. 

Lieutenant Johnson heard the message brought by Gray, 
and then pointed to what was being done. 

" I am making every effort," he said rather angrily. " Does 
Captain Smithers think I want to stay in this disgraceful posi- 
tion ? You can tell him, though, that if I can get free I shall 
divide my time between chasing these rascally prahus and 
lying where he suggests." 

The efforts went on, the men hauling and straining on the 
anchors, and the steam going furiously, but all in vain ; the 

vessel would not move. 

Then another plan was tried ; all the ship's company were 
sent to one side of the bulwarks, and then run across to the 
other, to give a swaying motion to the vessel, so as to loosen 
the keel in the deep mud ; but though the careening was 
effected, the steamer could not be moved, either ahead or 
astern. 

Then the last plan was tried again, with the addition of the 
guns being run all over to the port side, but still there was no 
change ; and Lieutenant Johnson's brow knit with annoyance as 
he more fully realized the fact that they would be lying in that 
helpless position when the captain returned. 

" The disgrace is enough to kill me, Roberts," he exclaimed. 

"Let's set every sail, sir," said the middy; "there's a nice 
breeze coming down the river now, and that may send her over 
nearly upon her beam-ends." 

" Yes ] " exclaimed the lieutenant eagerly ; and the order 




being given, the men ran up aloft, and sail after sail was 
lowered, Ali standing with folded arms watching the proceed- 
ings, and then turning to lean upon the bulwark and gaze down 
the river. 

Just then Adam Gray saluted the lieutenant. 

'* Will you be good enough to have me set ashore now, sir ? " 

"Set you ashore, my man?" replied Lieutenant Johnson, 
" Why, you had better wait till night." 

" I ought to get back with your message, sir." 

" Wait a little while, and perhaps I can run you round to the 
other side of the island." 

Gray, now that he had somewhat recovered, was eager to 
get back, but he could not quit the ship without the lieutenant's 
consent, and hence he waited patiently for the required permis- 
sion, watching the steamer's sails drop down one by one, and 
fill and flap as the breeze rose and fell. 

Now and then a dusky face could be seen amidst the palm- 
trees watching their proceedings, but it disappeared directly, and 
the clothing of the vessel with canvas went on without inter- 
ruption, till pretty well every stitch was set save a studding- 
sail or two. Then a puff of hot air came, and the steamer bent 
well over, the sails being so trimmed that the vessel's course 
would have been astern had she shown any disposition to move ; 
but though the steam was on full, and the men brought the 
capstan to bear on the cables, she did not budge an inch- 

" Here, my lads, back with these guns," said the lieutenant ; 
and for the next half-hour the men were busy replacing the 
heavy guns, when Ali, who since his escape had been remaining 
in sanctuary upon the steamer, suddenly gave the alarm. 

** A prahu coming down," he exclaimed, running to the 

lieutenant and catching his arm, pointing out as he did so some- 
thing moving round a reach of the river, and seen now and 
then where the growth was thin. 

" Two prahus coming up stream," reported one of the look-out 
men. 

" Look ! look I " cried Ali, pointing up the river. " There is 
another ¡ª two more. They are coming to take the steamer," he 
cried. 

" And we aground ! " exclaimed the lieutenant, stamping his 
foot with rage as he gave the necessary orders. The drum beat 
to quarters directly ; the magazine was opened ; and the men 
ran eagerly to their posts ; while Ali went quietly into the cabin, 
and returned with a sword, revolver, and a sporting rifle, lent 
him by the lieutenant for shooting crocodiles. 





" Are you going to fight ? '* exclaimed Bob Roberts, who 
looked flushed and excited. 

" Yes," said Ali, " with this ; " and he tapped the rifle. 

" But against your own people ? " 

" Rajah Gantang's pirates are not my own people," said Ali, 
contemptuously. " Besides, the English are my friends, and if 
we could I would have gone to help those ashore." 

" All right," said Bob, " then we will fight together. I say, 
it's going to be a hot affair, isn't it ? " 

" They think to take the steamer easily," said Ali, " as she is 
ashore, but you will not let them ? " 

" Let them I " said Lieutenant Johnson, " no, Mr Ali, we will 
not. We shall fight to the last, and the last will be that I'll 
blow the vessel up. I can't sink her, for she is aground." 

Ali nodded his approval : he seemed in no wise moved at the 
prospect of the steamer being destroyed. And now he stood 
watching the coming of the great prahus, with their regular 
sweeps, twenty to thirty on each side, and alternated this with 
watching the loading of the guns and disposal of the men. 

Just then an idea seemed to have struck Bob Roberts, who 
ran across the deck to where old Dick was standing ready by 
a gun, 

** Here, Dick, I want you. Wilson, come and take his place." 

" Ay, ay, sir I" cried the man; but old Dick growled. 

" Don't take me away, Mr Roberts, sir,'' he said, querulously. 
" I was longing for a shot at them dirty pirates, and now I'm 
losing my chance." 

" Look here, Dick,'' cried Bob, and he raised himself on tip- 
toe and whispered something to him, old Dick's soured face 
undergoing a complete change to one full of mirth. The wrinkles 
became puckers, and his eyes nearly closed, while his mouth 
seemed drawn out at the comers till nearly double its usual 
length. 

" It will be just right, Dick," said the middy. 

'* To a T, Mr Roberts, sir. Well, you are a clever one, you 
are ! Who'd ha' thought of that ? " 

" You be ready, Dick ; I depend upon you, mind," cried the 
middy; and he ran back to his post. 

The prahus were coming steadily on, up and down stream, 
and it could be seen from the steamer's deck that they were 
full of men, and bristling with spears, while any doubt as to 
the unfriendliness of their intentions was soon dispelled by the 
noise of beating gongs on board each vessel, the object being 
apparently to encourage each other and to excite alarm in the 




breasts of their foes, a result which in this case the noise decidedly 

failed in obtaining. 

The men kept glancing anxiously at their commander, who 
seemed to be letting the prahus approach very closely, which 
appeared to be a bad policy, seeing that the Malays were about 
ten to one, and their object would doubtless be to board the 
steamer and engage in a hand-to-hand fight; but Lieutenant 
Johnson had made his plans, and was abiding his time. He 
himself carefully pointed the guns, depressing them somewhat, so 
that the shot should strike low ; and then leaving the task in the 
hands of the captain of each piece, he waited the result. 

The prahus were now within a couple of hundred yards of 
the steamer, and had begun firing iron shot from their little 
brass lelahs, when the first gun spoke out. There was a round 
puff of smoke and a deafening roar, and the shot struck the 
nearest right in the stem, tearing a great hole in her bows, and 
passing through her with such deadly effect that the prahu im- 
mediately began to sink, and her crew leaped overboard in 
confusion and began to swim ashore. 

Grape-shot from the smaller guns or musketry from the 
marines would have destroyed numbers of the Malays struggling 
in the water, but looking upon them as out of the fight, 
Lieutenant Johnson left them to struggle, some to one bank, 
some to the other, and gave his orders merely to the men at the 
great guns. 

It was one from the port side that had wrought this mischief. 
Now one from the starboard spoke out. There was once more 
the great white ball of smoke, the deafening roar, and the shot 
struck the water about twenty yards from the nearest prahu, 
ricochetted, and passed clean through her, going down the river 
afterwards in a series of richochets. 

This shot caused no little confusion on board, and several of 
the sweeps fell uselessly in the water ; but the prahu still came 
on, with the occupants yelling and beating their gongs. 

Another shot struck the water, and though well aimed for the 
next prahu, it rose and went over her, merely making a great gap 
in the matting-screen from behind which the Malays were keeping 
up a brisk but ineffectual fire. 

Another shot at one of the prahus coming down stream; and 
this went clean over, and crashed through the palm-trees a 
quarter of a mile away. But the next shot produced a hearty 
cheer from the sailors, for it struck the slight vessel right on 
the water-line, made a tremendous gap, and must have caused 
terrible slaughter, for the Malays were thrown into confusion, 



the sweeps clashed one with the ether, and all governance seemed 
gone, the prahu turning broadside on, and then floating slowly 
with the stream for a few yards before settling down and sinking, 
leaving her masts and the top of the mat screens visible, for the 
water was shallow where she sank. 

The two prahus coming down stream were thus effectually 
disposed of; but the two coming up were now close at hand, 
and before another gun could be brought to bear their bows 
struck the sides of the steamer, grappling-irons were thrown 
over the bulwarks and into the chains, and yelling savagely 
their crews of fierce fighting men came swarming upon the deck. 

It was sharp work leaving the guns and preparing for the 
boarders ; but the sailors and marines were ready, and received 
the fierce yelling crowd of Malays with a sharp fire and the point 
of the bayonet, while these latter attacked fiercely with kris and 
spear. Their charge was most daring, and they came on in 
such numbers, and fought with so great a display of courage, 
that the little party of Englishmen, in spite of their heroic 
defence, were driven back step by step, till Lieutenant Johnson 
began to bitterly regret that he had not signalled for help from 
the fort. 

His heart sank within him as, in spite of his bravery and the 
example he set his men he saw them giving way on all sides. 

Bob Roberts, young as he was, fought bravely and well, while 
Ali did good service with his rifle. But all seemed in vain ; the 
Malays were gradually getting possession of the deck, and the 
question was arising in the lieutenant*s mind whether it would 
not be wiser to take refuge in the cabin, and fire from thence 
as they could. 

Men fell rapidly on either side, but while the Malays had 
three or four to leap into the places of those who went down, 
every wounded Englishman weakened the force terribly by his 
loss. 

Still there was no sign of flinching, the men giving way solely 
from being forced back by the numbers that pressed upon them. 

Three times over by a determined rally did the lieutenant 
strive to force the enemy back, but in vain ; and the last time he 
nearly lost his life, for the Malays made at him at once, and in 
his efforts to avoid them he slipped and fell. 

With a yell of triumph a couple of the enemy dashed at him 
spear in hand, when there was a sharp double report from a 
rifle, and one leaped in the air to fall flat on the deck beside 
his intended victim, the other staggered back and retreated to 
the re;ir. 



Those shots were fired by the young chief Ali, who coolly re- 
loaded his piece, and stood watching Bob Roberts, whose 
excitement was intense. 

He had forgotten Dick and his instructions to the old sailor in 
the fierce passions of the fray, and poor old Dick had gone down 
almost at the first rush, to crawl afterwards under the bulwarks, 
where he bound up his head, and lay watching the fight as he 
strove more than once to join in, 

But each time old Dick essayed to rise, a terrible sickness 
came over him, and he sank back trying to recall some order 
he had received from the midshipman, but unable to make out 
what it was. 

He fainted away twice in his efforts to get up, and then lay 
back, sick at heart, and with just enough consciousness left to 
know that the fight was going against the English, and that he 
had it in his power to change the fortunes of the day. 

" What was it Mr Roberts told him to do ? What was it Mr 
Roberts told him to do ? " 

That was the question he wanted solved, but the sense had all 
seemed to escape out of the cut in his head, so he told himself, 
and the more he tried to recall what it was, the more did he grow 
confused, and at last he lay there helpless, listening to the yelling 
of the Malays, and the cheers and shouts of the comrades he 
could not help. 

He could see clearly enough all that was going on, and feel 
bitterly every phase of ill fortune in the fight, while he regretted 
the powerless state in which he lay as he saw some companion 
worsted by the enemy. 

" If I could only think what it was Mr Roberts told me to do, 
I might do it now," he muttered, " and that would help the 
poor lads." 

His head was growing clearer, though, and he became more and 
more excited as he saw sailors, marines, and officers driven back, 
step by step, along the deck, with the prospect before them of 
being slain to a man, and the steamer taken. 

That idea was horrible to Dick, and he thought of the captain, 
officers, and men away in the jungle, and what would be their 
feelings when they returned. 

" If I could only help !" thought Dick. " Bravo, lad 1 Why 
he fights like a man," he muttered ; " and there's that Mr Ali 
using his gun wonderfully, and him only a nigger ; while I lie here 
with my orders on me, and do nothing to help my m-ates. Oh, 
if I only had strength," he groaned 

Still the fight went on, and to his horror Lieutenant Johnson 





saw that another prahu and a naga or dragon boat were coming 
up to the attack, while in place of being able to repel them with 
a few shots from his guns, he and his men were hemmed in by 
quite a mob of yelling Malays, every one of whom was thirsting 
for the Englishmen's blood. 

All at once, in the thick of the fight, and just as he was pant- 
ing, and too helpless to deliver another stroke, Bob Roberts 
recalled for a moment the orders he had given old Dick. But 
he felt that it was too late now, and stung by the disgrace of their 
position, he tried to reload his revolver, wondering whether Lieu- 
tenant Johnson would execute his threat of blowing up the ship. 

Had the lieutenant been ever so disposed, though, he could 
not have accomplished his design, for a living wall of Malays 
was between him and the way down to the magazine, and he 
was weak and spent with his efforts, to such an extent that he 
could hardly raise his sword. 

" It is all over," he thought to himself, " but well die fighting 
like Englishmen. Oh, my poor lads," he groaned, *' my poor 
lads ! " And he wondered whether he could have done anything 
else to lead them to victory instead of this bitter defeat 

It did indeed seem to be all over, for the fresh boats had 
reached the steamer, and their men were swarming over the side, 
when suddenly the remembrance of his orders flashed across old 
Dick's clouded brain, bringing with it renewed strength, for the 
faintness seemed to be driven away. 

Abdullah, or rather Rajah Gantang, saw the fresh forces 
arriving, and he shouted to them to come on, stepping back 
half-a-dozen yards, and then leaping on to one of the wired sky- 
lights kris in hand. 

Close beside him he saw a rough old wounded sailor screwing 
on something briglit that looked like a copper pipe, and then seize 
hold of an iron spanner ; and out of sheer thirst for blood the 
rajah, after waving to the new comers to come on, made a leap 
down at the old sailor, who faced him with what seemed to the 
rajah like a copper gun, presented, and fired ¡ª 

No, that's wrong, he watered ; for Bob Roberts' commands 
were at last executed, and a shower of scalding water from the 
boilers was sent by means of the hose and branch full in the 
rajah's facei driving him away yelling with agony, as Dick made 
a dash along the deck, the hose trailing after him, took the 
Malays in flank just as they were making their final dash at the 
hemmed-in defenders of the vessel, and the fortunes of the day 
were changed. 

Whizz^ squish, out fiew the steaming water in a scalding 



shower, and in an instant the fierce crowd of Malays were turned 
into a set of agonized, dancing, maniacs, a dozen of them turning 
furiously on Dick, and rushing at him, kris and spear in hand j 
but with a grim smile on his rough visage, old Dick gave the 
copper branch a waving motion, and the scalding shower stopped 
the fiercest of them, drove them back, and as they fled the fresh 
party summoned by the rajah came running along the deck. 

Dick did not flinch, but mentally praying that the supply 
might hold out, delivered the stream full in their faces as they 
came yelling up, and after a brave effort to withstand it for a few 
moments, sending them back, crushed and beaten, stamping, 
shrieking, leaping overboard, making frantic efforts to escape the 
pain, while Dick steadily followed them up, playing the boiling 
water amongst them, and literally cleaning the decks, amidst the 
cheering of the men. 

" Quick there," cried Lieutenant Johnson, " A man there at 
the wheel ¡ª two ! quick ! two ! She's afloat. Down there in 
the engine-room," he shouted, as he mounted the bridge, for a 
breeze had sprung up, and the mud that clung round the 
steamer's keel having been loosened by the firing, the motion of 
the vessel, and the pressure on the sails, the corvette had, unper- 
ceived, been afloat some minutes, and slowly floating down stream. 

In another few seconds she was under full command ; and as 
the men flew to the guns, the lieutenant took deadly revenge 
upon his fierce enemies by manoeuvring the steamer so that, in 
spite of the efforts of her crew with their sweeps, he literally sent 
her over the biggest of the three prahus, the stem of the steamer 
cutting it in two as if it had been made of paper, and then sink- 
ing the naga by a well-directed shot, the crews of both swimming 
easily towards the shore. 

By this time the other two prahus were in full retreat up 
stream, evidently from a belief that the steamer would not 
follow ; but in spite of his mishap in running aground, Lieu- 
tenant Johnson could not resist the temptation to administer the 
sternest punishment he could contrive ; and with full steam on, 
he gave chase, firing at the two prahus as he went. 

At the end of ten minutes one had been struck several times, 
and her captain ran her close in shore, he and his crew deserting 
her ; while after avoiding only by a miracle at least a dozen 
shots, the last prahu suddenly turned in by a branch of the river 
and seemed to go right amongst the palm-trees, when, after a 
parting shot or two, the steamer proving quite unsuited for chase 
in such narrow, shallow waters, the lieutenant gave it up, his 
crew being too weak to continue the chase with the boats. 



CHAPTER XLVIL 



HOW BOB ROBERTS BURNED THE PRAHU. 



The victory was dearly bought ; for now that the breathless ex- 
citement was over, and there was time to make an examination, 
it was found that fully half the crew had injuries, more or less 
serious, the men, though, bearing their sufferings with the greatest 
fortitude as their two officers, for want of a doctor, bound up the 
wounds. 

It almost seemed as if those who had most exposed them- 
selves had come off best ; for neither Lieutenant Johnson, Bob 
Roberts, Ali, nor Adam Gray, who had been brave even to reck- 
lessness, had received a scratch. 

" I have only one regret about you, Gray," said Lieutenant 
Johnson, shaking his hand warmly. 

*' May I ask what that is, sir?" replied Gray. 

" Yes, that you are not a sailor ; that is all," said the lieu- 
tenant, smiling, " I shall not forget this affair. I believe you 
twice over saved my life." 

" And you, too, friend Ali," continued the lieutenant, laying his 
hand upon the young chief's shoulder. "I have often called the 
Malays a set of treacherous wretches, but I find that there are 
Malays and Malays. Sir, I hope some day that you may rise to 
power, as in you England will always have a trusty ally." 

Ali bowed gravely, and his eyes betokened the pleasure he felt 
as he thought of the possibility of his raising the people of this 
land to something better than the slothful, betel-chewing piratical 
race they were. 

The steamer was now rapidly making her way back, the men 
furling the sails, and the screw as it revolved sending a wave 
washing in amidst the roots of the trees on either side of the 
river; while, now that the present danger was over, the lieu- 
tenant went round to visit his patients, leaving Bob Roberts in 
command, and a man with the lead in the chains. 


" I think the central channel is safe enough, Roberts," said 
the lieutenant; " but keep him heaving the lead," 

" Trust me, sir/' said Bob rather importantly, 

"Yes, I'll trust you, Roberts," said the lieutenant. ''I'll be 
frank with you, my lad, and tell you something that will please 
you, I know." 

" What is it, sir ?" said Bob eagerly. 

" I don*t think I shall ever look upon you again as a boy." 

Bob coloured with pleasure as soon as he was left alone ; but 
his common sense prevailed the next moment. 

" That's very kind of him," he thought, " but it's all gammon ; 
I am only a boy yet. And there ¡ª hang it all ! since Miss Linton 
spoke to me as she did, hang me if I care if I am ! " 

Fortunately for the party on board the steamer, the Malays 
had carried off their wounded as they fell, so that there was no 
trouble with either them or prisoners, who would have been 
highly inconvenient at such a time, especially as there was no 
knowing how soon there might be another attack. For though 
beaten as to their prahus, the Malays almost to a man succeeded 
in reaching the shore, to Join those besieging the fort, and at 
any time a new attack might be made. 

As they came abreast of the prahu that was run ashore and 
forsaken, Lieutenant Johnson determined to run no risk of its 
being floated once more, and used, after patching, to annoy ; 
for giving the order to reverse the engine, the steamer was kept 
abreast, while Bob Roberts and a party of marines and Jacks 
went ashore and made preparations to bum her. 

Ali stepped into the boat with his friend, and advised caution; 
for he warned Bob that, although severely punished, the rajah 
was in no wise beaten, and that, as likely as not, a force of men 
were lying hidden amongst the reeds to protect the injured 
prahu. 

" All right ! " said Bob, " I'll be careful." And to show how 
careful he intended to be, he let the cutter run up amidst the 
reeds, and jumped out with a dozen men, provided with some 
fiery spirit, and some spurn yam and matches. 

" I think you ought to search the reeds first with a few shots 
from your marines' rifles," said Ali, who was gazing around very 
distrustfully ; and no wonder, for there was every likelihood of 
some of the Malays being in ambush. 

" No need," said Bob, laughing. " We've given them such a 
lesson as they won't forget for some time, my lad. Come along.'* 

Ali leaped ashore, and they tried to get on board the prahu, 
which seemed close in to the bank ; but finding this was not the 





case, they returned to the boat, and pushed off through the 
rustling reeds to row round to the other side, and there board 
her by means of a rope. 

It was well for the little party that they returned as they did, 
for in twenty places dark figures were steading through the thick, 

long reeds quite unseen, but all converging upon the spot where 
the cutter ran to the shore. 

The return to the boat upset the plans of the ambush, but the 
Malays who formed the party were not beaten ; and finding their 
first plan hopeless, they immediately adopted another, and began 
creeping through the reeds, hardly making them rustle as they 
made now for the praha 

" Heave up a rope, one of you," said Bob, " unless anybody 
can climb up." 

This was as the bowman held the cutter close up against the 
prahu's side with his boathook. 

" If one on 'em keeps the cutter alongside, sir, I can get up, 
and then make fast a rope," said the bowman. 

" All right ! up with you," said Bob j and as another man held 
on by one of the big oars that hung in its place, the boatman 
hooked on his boathook in one of the rattan-twisted ropes, and 
cleverly climbed up, catching the rope that was thrown up and 
making it fast, when half a dozen of the sailors, with Bob 
Roberts and Ali, were soon on the short, bamboo deck. 

" It seems almost a pity to burn her," said Bob, who was 
greatly taken by the workmanship of the craft. 

" No, no ! " said Ali angrily, as his eyes wandered suspiciously 
about amidst the reeds ; " bum her, bum her ! the decks have 
been stained with blood, and many a poor, innocent creature has 
suffered outrage at the owner's hands. Rajah Gantang was a 
cruel, bloodthirsty pirate. Let the river be purified from his 
boats 1 " 

"But," said Bob, laughing, "we might give it a good washing 
down, and fumigate it below decks, and afterwards give it a coat 
of paint. It would be purified enough then, and it might be useful/^ 

" I do not understand you," said Ali seriously ; " but let your 
men be quick ; I fear danger." 

" What a suspicious chap you are, to be sure, Ali," replied 
Bob. " I'll be bound to say, if the truth was known, there isn't 
a nigger within a mile of us. Here, look alive, my ladsj it 
seems a pity to bum such a boat ; but orders are orders, and we 
shall have a gun fired directly, by way of recall. There, that 
will do ; lay the oakum there, and pour the spirits over it She'll 
bum like a firework." 




The men obeyed in a quiet leisurely manner, quite satisfied of 
there being no danger if their officer saw none ; so the oakum 
and yarn they had brought were heaped up on the bamboo deck, 
and another lot thrust into a kind of cabin, plenty of the spirit 
poured on each, and nothing was needed but the application of 
a match or two for the work of distruction to begin. 

Still Bob seemed loth to fire so well-built a vessel, and he 
stood pointing out good points in the make of the long light 
boat, counting the number of sweeps she had carried, examining 
the shot holes and the like ¡ª partly in a bravado spirit, for Aii 
was all anxiety to get on board the steamer again, scenting 
danger as he did on every breath of wind, while Bob wanted to 
show him how matter-of-fact and cool a British officer could be. 

" Look ! " said Ali suddenly, and he laid his hand upon Bob's 
shoulder. 

" Which way ? " said Bob quietly. " I can see nothing." 

"You will not see," said Ali in a low passionate voice. "You 
are so brave, but you are so foolish too. Why risk life when 
there is danger." 

" I don%" said Bob coolly. 

" You do ; there is great danger now," said AIL " Gantang's 
men are creeping through the reeds to spear us." 

" Jump down in the cutter then," said Bob, "and you will be all 

right." 

Ali drew himself up angrily. 
A Malay chief never knows fear," he said, as he leaned his 
hands upon the muzzle of the rifle he still carried, and stood 
there, proud and defiant, like a bronze statue, he was so motion- 
less and calm. 

" I didn*t mean to offend you, Ali, old fellow," cried Bob. 
And as the young Malay saw the open, frank, laughing face 
before him, and the extended hand, he seized it in his. 

'* I am not offended," said Ali, " but I'm afraid for you and 

your men." 

**Whatof ?" said Bob. 

" That ! " said Ali, as a spear whizzed through the reeds and 
stuck in the bamboo deck. 

" Yes, it was close," said Bob coolly. " Who has the 
matches ? " 

** Here you are, sir," said one of the men. 

** All right," said Bob, taking the box. " Down into the boat 
all of you. Go on too, Ali." 

" No, I stay with you," said the young chief, just as another 
spear stuck quivering in the deck. 




" Ah ! I left it a bit too long," said Bob, striking a match as 
he dived into the cabin, and the next moment a volume of 
smoke rolled ud. 

He then lit another match, and held it to the soaked oakum 
on the deck, spear after spear being thrown, several of which he 
escaped as by a miracle. Another moment or two, and the thick 
smoke formed a veil between the two young men and their 
enemies, who threw spear after spear, but without effect. 

" Won*t they be fine and mad ? " cried Bob. " Here, give me 
your rifle, Ali, old fellow, and I'll have a couple of shots at them. 
No, I won't," he said, handing the rifle back ; " I can't shoot in 
cold blood. Come along, or we shall be roasted ready for our 
friends there, if they are disposed to be cannibals. My word, how 
she bums ! " 

His last words were not uncalled for, as the light wood of 
which the Malay vessel was composed began to blaze furiously, 
so fast indeed, that the middy and his friend were driven into 
making rather an undignified retreat before the great leaping 
tongues of flame and the rolling volumes of smoke that in a few 
minutes ran from end to end of the vessel. 

" Push off", my lads," cried Bob, as he took his place in the 
stern-sheets, coughing and sneezing from the effects of the pun- 
gent smoke. "Give way!" he cried; "there's a signal flying 
for our return." 

Just then a shot came from the steamer as well, and with the 
Malays beginning to fire at them from among the reeds, the cutter 
was rowed rapidly back to the steamer's side, the prahu mean- 
while blazing furiously, and promising soon to burn down to the 

water's edge. 

"Come, Mr Roberts," cried the lieutenant impatiently; "you 
have been a long time." 

" Yes, sir," said Bob, smiling at Ali, " there was a good deal 
of spear-throwing towards the last, and we had to dodge them." 

" The enemy is not easily frightened," said the lieutenant, as 
the propeller once more rapidly revolved; "but we must get 

back, for I fancy I can hear firing below, and I am afraid they 
are attacking the fort now for a change." 

" What shall you do, sir ? " said Bob eagerly. 

" It is not the custom, Mr Roberts, for the officer in com- 
mand to explain his plans to his subordinates ; but if you must 
know, I shall run the steamer as close up to the fort as I can, and 
there keep her, if the Malays do not prove too strong for us." 

Then walking to and fro for a few minutes, he ended by going 
up to where old Dick, with a bandage round his head. wi5 
calmly masticating a lump of tobacca 




" I have never thanked you for your capital idea," said the 
lieutenant. " That hot water saved us in a terrible pinch." 

" Yes, sir," said Dick, grinning, " it saved us ; but it wam't my 
idee at all. ' There's lots of boiling water, Dick/ says Mr 
Roberts, yonder j * screw on the hose, and tell the engineer what 
you want. Then when alUs ready, and it seems a good time, 
lay hold of the branch, and play up among the niggers,' sir; 
and I did as soon as I could, but my head were in that muzzy 
state that¡ª" 

" There is firing going on," said the lieutenant. " Mr Roberts, 
clear again for action." 

" Action, eh ? " said old Dick. " Then I can't do better than 
say another word to the engineer, for of all the ways to clear the 
decks this hot water system's about the best." So saying, Dick 
went to screw the hose on the valve once more, muttering and 
talking to himself the while, and ever and again slapping one of 
his legs and bursting into a series of chuckles. 

" Lor' a mussy me," he said ; " and how I argyed with Mr 
Roberts there about the niggers not being clean. Why that's 
what put it into his precious head. I wonder what they looks 
like to day, after their washing." 

" Took the skin off, I should say, Dick," said Bob Roberts, 
who had heard the old man's words. 

"And sarve 'em right, sir," said the old sailor. "What did 
they mean to do to us but take us right out of our skins, and end 
us right off at once ? And them as plays at bowls must expect 
rubbers." 

So sapng, Dick, who had finished his speech without an 
audience, seemed quite forgetful of his wound, and went down to 
the engine-room, where the engineer and firemen saluted him 
with a broad grin ; to which Dick responded with one a little 
broader, as he stood mopping the perspiration from his face. 

" Why, Dick, old man," said the engineer, " after this I think 
we can show them gunners a trick or two. It would have 
puzzled them to clear the decks like that. However came you 
to think of it?" 

" Think of it ? " said Dick. " I shouldn't never thought of such 
a game ; it was young Mr Roberts, you know. But did you see 
'em run ? " 

" Run !" said the engineer. " Running was nothing to it ; you 
cleared the deck like a shot." 

" Shot ! " said Dick scornfully j " I should like to see the shot 
or shell that would do it half as well. Why, look here, my lads, 
your shot and your shell kills and murders people, knocks off 





their legs and wings, and precious often their heads. A shot goes 
bang in amongst a lot o' folk, and there*s an end of it. But here 
I was with the copper branch in my fisties, and I just sprinkled 
'em here and there like a shower and ¡ª ^" 

" Give it 'em hot," interposed one of the firemen leaning on 
his shovel. 

"Ay, I just did,*' said Dick ; " not as it was much hotter than 
it is down here, my lads, but hot I did give it 'em, and there 
wasn't one who would face it And that brings me down to 
why I come here." 

" Oh, we know why you come here, Dicky," said another of 
the firemen, who had just been stoking a furnace, and whose 
face shone with perspiration. " You said to yourself, you did, 
there's them poor chaps down there in the engine-room getting 
half-roastedj and with their throats as dry as brown paper ; now, 
being a good-hearted sort of fellow as I am, I'll just go down 
below and say to em, a nice cooling drink o' lime juice and 
water with a dash o' rum in it, is what you all wants in a big tin 
can. Shall I get it for you ? That's what you come down here 
to say." 

" Blest if ever I see such a clever chap as you are, Sam 
Walsh," cried Dick, slapping his leg and laughing. " You can 
read a fellow just as if he was made up o' large print and big 
leaves. You've really hit it, but you see a drink like that wants 
mixing ; and don't you see, though you may drink it cold it wants 
hot water to mix it? and that's what I did come about ¡ª more hot 
water." 

" To mix up for us, Dick ? " said the engineer, laughing, 

** No," said Dick, " I didn't say that, my lad," and a bigger 
grin came over his face ; " what I want is the hot water to mix 
the grog for the niggers, as it seems they liked the last dose so 
much, that I'm to get ready some more." 

" There's plenty ¡ª hot enough for anything, Dick," said the 
engineer, " and I'll keep up the supply," 

" Silence below there ! " cried a voice ; and the engineer gave 
his subordinates a nod. 

" You'd better get on deck, Dick, old man," he said quietly ; 
and then in response to a signal from above, he seized and 
altered a couple of handles, listened for a fresh order, and 
slackened the speed of the engine ; while Dick went back on 
deck, satisfied that there was an abundant supply of hot water 
ready for the next action, and seeing that the island was once 
more in sight. 

A party of Malays were at the head, but they disappeared 





amidst the trees as the steamer came steadily down stream, 
while now as they drew nearer the sounds of smart firing could 
be heard, telling that an engagement was in progress. Smoke, 
too, was rising slowly above the feathery palm trees, but not 
in such dense volumes as that which could still be seen spread- 
ing out like a cloud above the jungle, where the prahu was 

burning. 

A sharp series of orders followed, and every man stood at his 
post ; for boats could be seen going to and from the island, and 
it was plain enough to the meanest comprehension on deck that 

if they meant to aid the occupants of the fort they had come none 
too soon. 



CHAPTER XLVIII. 



PLEASANT DAYS AT THE FORT. 

Matters seemed to grow worse from the moment that Adam 
Gray started off on his mission to the steamer, and Captain 
Smithers' brows seemed to have settled into a constant frown, for 
it was no light matter to be in command of the little fort, right 
away from aid, and only with a limited supply of provisions. 
They might be made to last weeks or months; but the end 
must come, and he saw no chance of help from outside, unless 
the steamer went off to the nearest station in search thereof! 

Then there was the constant worry upon his brain about the 
expedition and its fate, for there could be no doubt about Ali's 
news ; the force had been divided by cunning, and with such 
treacherous enemies he felt but little hope of seeing any of the 
party again. 

Fortunately for him and the sharers of his imprisonment ¡ª for 
it was little else ¡ª their minds were too much occupied by the 
defence of the place to give them time to sit and brood over their 
troubles. There was always something to do, some weak part 
to strengthen ; and Captain Smithers longed for the help of the 
lieutenant with the steamer to guard outside of the fort. 

There was this to consider too ¡ª if Lieutenant Johnson could 
get the " Startler " off the mud, and round to the other side by 
Dullah's hut and the landing-place, if they were very hard 
pressed the fort could be abandoned, and, with the women, they 
could take refuge on board. Or better still ¡ª though he felt 
reluctant to make such an arrangement ¡ª the women could be 
got on board, and then the fort could be defended to the last 
extremity. 

In the course of those next hours while awaiting Gray's return, 
the Malays made two or three sharp attacks, all of which were 
repelled; and then, unable to assist, they waited, and listened 
to the engagement going on upon the other side of the patch of 
jungle that clothed a part of the island. The heavy reports of 





the steamer's guns made the frames of the lightly-built dwellings 
rattle, and the smoke could be seen rising above the trees ; but 
how the tide of war set it was impossible to tell, and Captain 
Smithers, as he walked up and down, felt as if he would have 
given anything for a trusty native spy who would have sought out 
news of what was going on. 

Failing this, and not daring to send out a second party, 
although Tom Long volunteered to go, there was nothing for it 
but to wait, especially as their besiegers had evidently been greatly 
augmented in numbers, and one of the soldiers had but to show 
himself for a moment to bring upon himself a shower of bullets. 

The suspense grew maddening, as the noise of the engagement 
between the prahus and the " Startler " increased. The yells of 
the Malays could be plainly heard; then the reports of the heavy- 
guns ceased ; there was a little rifle firing, the occasional crack 
of a revolver ; and lastly came the faintly heard noise of men 
contending in deadly strife. 

This lasted for a while, and the occupants of the fort mentally 
pictured the scene going on, but they could not comprehend 
the strange shrieking they heard as of men in terrible pain. 

Captain Smithers' heart sank, and he glanced at Tom Long, 
in whose countenance he read a confirmation of his fears; and on 
looking farther he saw Mrs Major Sandars, with Rachel Linton 
and her cousin, watching him attentively. 

They read his face too as he turned away, and their dread 
also seemed confirmed. 

That ominous silence of the steamer's guns pointed to the fact 
that she had been boarded by the Malays in too strong parties 
to.be successfully resisted, and a deep gloom sank upon all within 
the fort. 

There was not a man present who would not willingly have 
gone to the help of those on board the steamer; but not only 
were they hemmed in, but had they made a successful sally they 
had no means of reaching her. 

Nothing Gould be done then but wait, in the hope that some 
on board would escape and join them ; and to this end a con- 
stant watch for fugitives was kept up, a dozen men standing 
ready at the gate to rush out and bring any stragglers in. 

Just when they had descended to the greatest depths of 
misery, and Tom Long was debating with himself as to whether 
he ought not to go to Miss Linton and try to comfort her, 
telling her that so long as his arm could wield a sword she might 
reckon herself to be perfectly safe, there was a peculiar crashing 
sound, with a fresh burst of yells and cries. 




The ladies shuddered, and longed to go in and be alone, but 
their excitement was such that they felt obliged to stay out there 
in the opening, risking many bullets, so as to be face to face 
with the worst. 

Something terrible had happened they all knew, and at last 
the suspense was so great that in the presence of the ladies Cap- 
tain Smithers exclaimed, ¡ª " Long, you will have to take a dozen 
men and learn the worst ! " 

Tom Long glanced at Miss Linton, and for answer tightened 
his sword belt, and then examined the chambers of his revolver. 

" I*m ready, sir/' he said, and he set his teeth, for he felt that 
he should not come back alive. Still he was a soldier, and he 
accepted his duty without flinching, though it did need an effort 
to be calm. 

Just then, as he was about to ask what men he should choose, 
all ears being attentive to catch the faintest sound from beyond 
the trees ¡ª Boom I crash I went a big gun report and the blow 
it struck, coming almost simultaneously; and as in his excitement 
Tom Long sent his cap high in air, there was another echoing 
report, with a familiar beating and panting sound. 

" The steamer's off! " Tom Long cried. "Hurrah ! " 

Discipline was forgotten for the moment, and every man shouted 
with delight, his cheery "Hurrah!" the cheers being renewed 
directly after by the following reports of the steamer's guns ; and 
they knew by the beat of the engines that she was going up 
stream, firing as she went, evidently in pursuit of a prahu. 

They had plenty of evidence directly after that the Mala)^ 
had been beaten, for hurrying parties kept coming from the far 
side of the island where the engagement had taken place, and 
as Captain Smithers scanned these with his glass, he could see 
that their slight garments were soaking wet, baju and sarong 
clinging to their limbs, and showing that they had had to swim 

ashore. 

This was all proof of their having had a thorough beating ; 
and now, with the steamer no longer aground, but ready to 
come to their help, the spirits of all rose at as rapid a rate as 
they had gone down. 

But it was to be no time of rest for them. Captain Smithers, 
to meet the difficulty of there being no water to be obtained, 
save by going under fire to the spring, or making a dash for the 
river, had been giving orders for the sinking of a well in a 
comer of the fort, when word was passed from sentry to sentry 
of the advance of the enemy. Then shots were fired, at first 
scattered, then rapidly; and it was at once evident, that in 



revenge for their defeat afloat, the crews of some of the prahus 
had joined those on the island in a general attack. 

The earthworks were well made, but they required more 
men to successfully defend them, and after keeping the enemy 
at bay by a well-directed iire for some time, Captain Smithers, 
seeing signs of an approaching rush, and knowing well that this 
must result in severe loss upon his own side, quietly began 
to draw his little force away from the earthworks, till he had 
half in the barracks at the loopholes, from which they began 
a steady fire over the heads of those at the earthem wall, who, 
in their turn retired half at a time, the first half joining those 
who had gone before. 

Then as the Malays began to realize that the force at the 
earthen wall was very weak, and showed signs of coming on 
to carry it by storm, the defenders delivered a sharp volley 
and dropped out of sight, stooping down and running across 
to the barracks' white walls. On seeing that they had given 
way, the Malays set up a loud cry of triumph, and dashed 
forward, spear in hand, to occupy the deserted earthworks. 
They were met by a sharp fire from the barracks, which stag- 
gered them for the moment, but they rushed on, and sheltered 
themselves in the ditch, throwing a i^w spears at the hindmost 
of the retreating party ; but without effect, for the little 
garrison was soon shut in and able tor the time to defy their 
assailants. 

It was evident, however, that they were not to be left in 
peace, for the Malays now swarmed around them, and dozens 
might have been shot down ; but Captain Smithers gave orders 

that the fire should be reserved till they attacked. 

Just as they had finished the barricading of the entrance, a 
cloud of smoke was seen rising from the side of the residency, 
and this was followed by flames, leaving no doubt that the 
pleasant little house had been fired by the Malays ; and Captain 
Smithers frowned as he determined to administer severe punish- 
ment to the enemy, if for this act alone. 

Every opportunity was given him for the administration of the 
chastisement, the Malays exposing themselves freely, running out 
of shelter to fire, and then retreating again. Sometimes a fierce 
demonstration was made by spear-armed men, who came boldly 
up as if to attack, but soon fell back unmolested, for Captain 
Smithers felt that no end was to be obtained by simply shooting 
down a few of the enemy, and his orders were to reserve fire till 
a fiercer attack was made. 

This was not long in coming, and it was made quite unex- 





\ 

pectedly, just as, wearied out by his efforts, Captain Smithers 
had left Tom Long in command, and, yielding to the prayers of 
the major*s ^\^^, had gone in to the mess-room to partake of 
some refreshment that had been prepared- 
He had hardly eaten a mouthful ¡ª after visiting first the 
wounded men, to find them being tended by Rachel Linton and 
her cousin ¡ª before the rattle of musketry and the yelling of the 
Malays told him that something serious had occurred. 

Catching up his sword, he rushed to where he had left Tom 
Long, and in a few words he learned that from two points the 
Malays had suddenly commenced their attack, which was now 
being carried on in so fierce a manner that unless they received 
a sufficiently severe check to quell their courage, they would 
force the defences, and overpower the little garrison by sheei 
weight of numbers. 

Fortunate it was that the defences had been so well strength- 
ened, the men firing from behind barricades roughly constructed 
of tables, the mess forms, and bedding ; but in spite of the heavy 
fire kept up and the number that fell, the Malays dashed up, 
striving to clamber over, and thrusting their spears through the 
openings in a way that kept the men back, and nearly crushed 
the fire that had sputtered from the various loopholes that had 
been left. 

Affairs were growing very serious, for Captain Smithers, who 
had been going from place to place, advising, cheering, and 
helping the men, suddenly had his attention drawn to the fact 
that a large party oi Malays were bringing bundles of wood, 
branches of trees, and handfuls of resin, which they were piling 
up against the barricaded door. 

This he well knew meant fire, and the question arose how it 
was to be stopped. 

" They must never be allowed to light it, my lads, as our lives 
and those of the ladies would not be worth five minutes' purchase. 
Cease firing on this side, and reserve your cartridges for any who 
come to fire the pile." 

The men responded with a grim smile, and stood waiting for 
the party whose duty it would be to try and bum them out ; and 
in this time of mortal peril, when danger of so great a kind stared 
them in the face, the men stood patiently awaiting their fate, seem- 
ing the while to repose the greatest confidence in their captain, 
and standing ready to obey his orders to the last 

It was a splendid example of what discipline and confidence 
could effect. The men felt that if their lives were to be saved it 
would be through carefully carrying out the wishes of their 





officers, and hence no murmui was heard, each man's face 
wearing a grim look of determination, that seemed to be intensified 
as Sergeant Lund came round laden with cartridges, a packet of 
which he handed to each in turn, 

" Some sergeants," he said, as he finished his task and stood 
rifle in hand by the group whose duty it was to shoot down the 
bearers of the dammar torches that they felt sure would be used, 
" some sergeants would, I dare say, be shaking hands with all 
their mates at a time like this, and looking at things as all over ; 
but I don*t, my lads, for I've a sort of faith in our luck turning 
up shiny side outwards ; so cheer up, all of you." 

" All right, sergeant," was the reply. 

** I wouldn*t trust too much to luck though, my lads," he con- 
tinued, " but I*d squint straight along the barrel of my rifle when 
I fired. You may be very sorry for the Malay chap you shoot 
at, but I'd shoot him first and be very sorry afterwards." 

" Right, sergeant," said Private Sim, who had been fighting 
very manfully all day ; they needn't come and be a trying to bum 
us out unless they like, need they ? " 

" No, Sim," replied the sergeant ; " but they will, and it strikes 
me that the/U be come before long, too. Isn't that smoke in 
amongst those bushes there ? " 

" Smoke it is," said one of the men, excitedly. 

" Don't jump about Hke that, my lad, but keep cool, or you'll 
be wasting your cartridges," said the sergeant. *' Where's the 
captain ? He was here just now." 

" Gone round the other side," said Sim. " Here they come, 
sure enough. Look ; there's a dozen men with torches." 

"All right, my lads," said the sergeant. " I don't see that it 
matters about the captain not being here ; you know your duty." 

" Yes, sergeant, to shoot down those men." 

" No, no, my lads ; what youVe got to do is to put those 
torches out, and the way to do it is with the bayonet Stand 
ready there to slip over the breastwork, all of you, then a sharp 
run, and meet them as they come, and then back again under 



cover. " 



As he spoke the smoke of the dammar torches could be 
seen, and some ten or twelve Malays came running across from 
the earthworks to set fire to the pile. 

There was not a man behind the breastwork whose breath did 
not come thick and fast at the sight of the Hghts; for brave as they 
were, they knew that once the building they defended caught 
fire, the dry, sun-baked wood must flare away like so much 


paper ; and there were women shut in there with them, whom it 
was their duty to defend. 

It was no wonder then that the men tightly grasped their 
bayonet-armed riiies, and stood waiting for the command, that did 
not come. For just as it was upon the sergeant's lips a panting 
noise was heard, and as every eye was directed up the riverj the 
masts of the steamer were seen coming along above the 
trees, and for the present the little garrison felt that they were 
?aved. 



CHAPTER XLIX 



HOW ALI WENT TO SPY OUT THE LAND. 



A TREMOR of excitement seemed to run through the attacking 
party ; men hurried here and there ; the bearers of the dammar 
torcfics paused irresolute, and it was evident to the besieged that 
contrary orders were being given. 

It was also evident to them that the danger signal they were 
filing was plainly understood upon the steamer, for the noise of 
the engine had not been heard a minute before there was the 
heavy report of one of the guns^ and almost simultaneously the 
crash of a shell, which burst over the heads of the thronging 
Malays, about fifty yards in front of the fort 

No one seemed to be injured, but this dire instrument of 
warfare caused a complete scare amidst the attacking party: 
men running in all directions, and then seeming to go over 
the same ground once again, as a second shell burst with its 
harsh tearing metallic-sounding crack. 

Again came the report of a gun, and the shell burst where 
the Malays were thickest, sending them scurrying like wild 
rabbits to the nearest cover, while the steamer now glided 

slowly down, closer and closer in shore, till at last she covered 
the river-face of the fort like an outwork, and a cheer rose 
from the little garrison, and was answered from the " Startler " 
as the forces, so to speak, combined, ready to act together for 
their mutual defence. 

As the steamer was rapidly moored in her new position, men 
being sent ashore with cables trcm head and stem to make fast to 
the great trees a few yards from the bank, a rush at them was 
made by the Malays, but a few well-directed shots from the 
marines' rifles were sufficient to keep them at bay till the task 
was done ; and the little garrison now joined hands with the 
steamer's crew in clearing the space between them. 

The first step taken by Captain Smithers was to regain 





possession of the outworks ¡ª ^the portion he had given up from 
being so short of defenders. 

This was accomplished without bloodshed ; for upon the 
Malays gathering in force to withstand his efforts, they were 
scattered by a shell from the steamer, which cleared the way at 
once. This being done, and a meeting effected full of hearty 
congratulations, both soldiers and sailors set to work, armed with 
spades, to throw up a trench from the outworks of the fort to 
the river, the ditch being so arranged that it took in for safety 
the trees to which the steamer was moored, and this latter now 
became as it were the river-face of the fort. 

Night had fallen long before the work was left, and this 
rendered it necessary for a retreat to fort and steamer for the 
hours intervening till daybreak, when, no interruption having 
occurred, the digging was resumed, every man toiling with his 
rifle at his side till the task was done. 

The next question was whether it would not be safer for all 
to take possession of the steamer, even though the extra defences 
had been made. 

Lieutenant Johnson argued that this would be the better plan, 
as then they could at any time effect a retreat down the river, 
and make for Singapore or Penang. 

But Captain Smithers refused to listen to this proposal 

"No," he said, "it was quite open to the ladies to take up 
their abode on board, and probably they would be more secure 
there than on shore ; but so far/' he said, " all was surmise 
about the expeditionary party. For all they knew. Captain 
Horton, Major Sandars, and their men, might have met with 
the best of treatment, and at the end of a few days they might 
return, to find the station abandoned by those left in charge." 

" I only hope they may," said the lieutenant. " For my part^ 
I feel certain that the whole of the people hereabouts are under 
the influence of the rajah, sultan included. But I will not oppose 
you, Captain Smithers, until matters come to such an extremity 
that it seems to me that we are uselessly risking life, then I must 
insist on an evacuation of the fort." 

'* I will not oppose you then," said Captain Smithers ; " but 
you see that now it is as if I asked you to resign your ship." 

Lieutenant Johnson nodded \ and it having been resolved to 
hold out to the last, hoping the while that the expedition might 
return, the next proceeding seemed to be that of sending out a 
trustworthy spy or two into the country and amongst the people. 

Both Bob Roberts and Tom Long were present at what the 
latter had importantly called the council of war, but nothing 




definite was decided upon ; and, soon after, the two friends were 
sitting beneath the shade of one of the trees, the Malays having 

withdrawn to a distance, and hostihties being for the present 
suspended. 

*'I think," said Tom Long, importantly, ''that the ladies are 
quite right in declining to leave the fort They are much safer 
tiiere." 

Bob Roberts laughed, gazed in his companion's face, and 
laughed again heartily ; to the very great disgust of Tom Long. 

" Yes," he said, gruffly, " I dare say it is very funny, and any- 
body can laugh like a buffoon about such an arrangement ; but 
how are they going to be safe on board a vessel whose officers 
camnot keep her from running aground." 

"Well that's a facer, certainly,'* said Bob, rather warmly; 
" but if you come to that, where would you have been if we 
hadn't come to your help ¡ª burnt out by this time, with your 
precious fort" 

" Bob Roberts," said Tom Long, solemnly, " or rather I 
suppose I ought to say Mr Roberts ¡ª you are about the most 
quarrelsome fellow I ever met." 

" You couldn't meet yourself," said Bob, " or you would run 
against one ten times as quarrelsome." 

" If you want to fall out," said the ensign, "you might do it 
in a gentlemanly way." 

" If you want me to punch your head, Tom Long, just say so," 
cried Bob, hotly. 

" I repeat my words," said Tom Long, with hauteur. " If you 
wish to quarrel, sir, you might do it in a gentlemanly manner." 

" Gentlemanly be hanged 1 " cried Bob. " There's nothing 
gentlemanly in quarrelling or fighting.'' 

" And refer the matter to friends," continued the young 
military officer. 

Bob's face was red as that of a turkey-cock the moment before, 
but at these words the anger seemed to pass away like a cloud 
from before the sun, and he burst into a hearty fit of laughter. 

'* Oh I " he said, '* that's what you mean is it ? Swords, or 
pistols, and seconds, early in the morning, with a doctor on the 
ground. Oh, I say, Tom Long, this is too delicious." 

" Sir 1 " exclaimed Tom Long. 

" I say it's too delicious. Duelling be hanged ; it's fools' 
work ; and I'm not quite fool enough to let a friend make a 
hole, or try to make a hole, in my precious carcase.'' 

" Sir, none but a coward would speak as you are speaking," 
cried Tom Long, indignantly. 





" Oh, wouldn't he ? '' said Bob, " Well, then, I suppose I'm a 
coward, for hang me if we don't get running risks enough from 
these coffee-coloured fellows, without trying it on among our- 
selves." 

" I thought you more of a gentleman," said Tom Long, 
contemptuously. 

" Oh, you did, did you ? " said Bob ; " and I'm a coward, am 
I ? Well, look here, my lad, it's too hot now, but if you like to 
come on board to-night, or to-morrow morning, and take off 
your jacket like a man, I'll have it out with you in the gunroom, 
and old Dick to see fair, and you can bring Private Gray or 
Sergeant Lund." 

" What do you mean ? " said Tom Long, haughtily ; " swords 
or pistols, sir ? " 

"Do I mean swords or pistols, sir?" said Bob, imitating the 
other's pompous way ; " no, sir, I don't mean either. I reserve 
those lethal weapons, sir, for Her Majesty's enemies, sir, as an 
officer and a gentleman should ; and when I fall out with a 
friend, I punch his head with my fist ¡ª like a man." 

*' Like a man ! " said Tom Long, in tones of disgust ; " like a 
schoolboy or a blackguard." 

" No, sir," said Bob, still mimicking his companion ; " the 
schoolboy or man who uses his fists is to my mind not half such 
a blackguard as the gentleman who tries to kill a fellow in cold 
blood, and calls it on account of his honour." 

" The old contemptible argument," said Tom Long, sneering, 
" No one but a coward would take refuge behind such excuses." 

*'Then I'm a coward !" said Bob, cocking his heels up on a 
chair, and sticking his hands in his pockets. " All right : I'm a 
coward ; and as we used to say at school, ' give me the coward's 
blow ; * and if you do, Tom Long, you see if I don't punch your 

head." 

Tom Long rose, and came at him menacingly, and Bob 

laughed in his face. " I say, Long, old man," he said, " what a 

jolly pair of fools we are to quarrel about nothing at all." 

" I never want to quarrel," said Tom Long, stiffly, for the 
other's mirth took him aback, " but when a fellow behaves like a 
coward ¡ª " 

" In the face of the enemy," interposed Bob, "kick him out of 
the service, military or naval, eh ? Look here, Tommy." 

" For goodness' sake, sir, don't call me by that objectionably 
childish name," cried the ensign. " How should you like to be 
called Bobby?" 

"Not much, old boy," said the middy; "but I don't much 



care. Never mind, shake hands. No, don't. Let's do it men- 
tally. Here's old Ali coming, looking as black as a civilian's 
hat. Hallo, Ali, old chap, ain't you precious proud of your dear 
fellow-countrymen ? " 

" Poor fellows ; poor fellows 1 " said Ali, sadly, as he looked 
from one to the other. 

" Poor fellows ! " said Long. 

" They're a jolly set of sharks, with stings in their tails, that's 
what they are," said Bob. 

" The poor fellows have been crushed down by cruel govern- 
ments, and made the slaves of piratical rajahs and cowardly 
sultans," cried Ali, indignantly. " They are a brave set of 
fellows, and they are only fighting against you because they are 
set on by their leaders." 

" Then all I can say is," said Bob, " that I should like to have 
a pop at their leaders. But cheer up, old chap, you needn't 
look so down-hearted." 

" Not look down-hearted," cried Ali, passionately, " how can I 
look otherwise ? Where is my father ? Where are our friends ? 
What is my position here? Do you think it gives me pleasure 
to see the poor brave men who are fighting against you shot 
down by your guns ? It makes me wretched." 

" Well, never mind," cried Bob, kindly, as he rose and clapped 
the young chief on the shoulder. " It will all come right in the 
end." 

" I hope so," said Ali ; " but tell me, what have you decided 
to do ? " 

" Well, that's announcing the secrets of the council of war," 
said Bob. "Shall I tell him. Long?" 

" Oh, yes, we can trust him," replied the ensign. " We are 
going to stay and fight it out." 

" Of course, of course," said Ali, nodding. " You could not 
give up. You must not give up." 

" But we want to get some news of the expedition party by 
sending a trustworthy spy," said Bob. " Can you get us a man 
whom you can trust ? " 

Ali stood thinking for a few moments, and then shook his 

head sadly. 

*'They would all say the risk is too great. They would lose 

their lives if discovered." 

"Then what is to be done ?" cried Bob. 

Ali stood thinking for a few moments in silence, and then he 
looked frankly from one to the other. 

" I will go myself," he said. 



The two young men stared at him. 

" You ?" they exclaimed in one breath, " Why, just now you 
said the risk was too great." 

** That the men would lose their lives ! " cried Bob Roberts. 

" If they were discovered ! " exclaimed Tom Long. 

" Yes," said Ali, quietly, and he smiled back in their astonished 
faces. 

" And yet you would run that risk ? " said Bob Roberts, 

" Yes : why not ? " 

" But for us ? " 

*' Is one's life to be devoted to oneself?" said Ali calmly. " I 
am not as you are. You are Christians, I am a follower of the 
prophet. We call you dogs and giaours. You look upon us 
with contempt. But men are but men the whole world over, 
and it seems to me that one's life cannot be better spent than 
in trying to do good to one's friends." 

** But," said Tom Long, " you would be fighting against your 
friends, the Malays." 

" No," said Ali, mournfully. " I should be fighting for them 
in doing anything that would free chem from the rule of idle 
sensualists and pirates." 

"I tell you what,** cried Bob Roberts, enthusiastically, "well 
whop old Hamet and Rajah Gantang out of their skins, and you 
shall be sultan instead, or your father first and you aftenvards," 

All's eyes flashed as he turned them upon the speaker. 

" You could be chief banjo, you know," said Bob. 

" Chief ¡ª banjo ? " said Ali, wonderingly. 

"No, no ; I mean gong ¡ª Tumongong," cried Bob. 

"Oh, yes," said Ali, smiling. " But no, no : that is a dream. 
Let us be serious. One of your people could not go, it would 
be impossible ; but I am a Malay, and if I dress myself as a 
common man ¡ª a slave ¡ª I could follow where the hunting party 
went, and find out all you want to know," 

" No, no," cried Bob, earnestly, " I should not like that.** 

" Like what, Mr Roberts ? " said a voice that made them 
start ; and turning sharply, they saw Captain Smithers standing 
by them, with Lieutenant Johnson. 

" Mr Ali here wants to dress up as a common Malay, sir, 
and go as a spy to get news of the hunting party." 

" It would be excellent," cried the lieutenant, " Mr Ali, you 
would confer a lasting favour upon us." 

" But have you thought of the risk ? " said Captain Smithers. 
" I have thought of everything," said the young man, quietly. 
They all sat down together under the shade of the great tree 


where they were, and the matter was talked over, it being de- 
cided that from time to time Ali was to send messengers with 
news of his progress, if he could find any trustworthy enough j 
and all being arranged, he left them, to make preparations for 
his departure, shaking hands warmly with all, and then going 
towards the barracks, but only to return directly. 

" As you may suppose," he said, " my success depends upon 
my not being apparently known to you ; so if a strange Malay is 
seen leaving your lines, don't let him be fired at." 

" Of course not : I see," exclaimed Captain Smithers. " But 
shall we see you again ? " 

" Not to speak to," replied Ali, smiling ; and as soon as he 
had gone. Captain Smithers walked across the ground to give 
orders about a strange Malay being allowed to leave. 

Lieutenant Johnson returned on board the steamer with Bob 
Roberts ; and Tom Long, after seating himself comfortably in 
one chair with his legs in another, went off fast asleep. 

Half an hour after, when all was very still in the burning heat 
of the sun, when not a breath of air rippled the river or rustled 
through the trees ; when Englishman and Malay were resting, 
and the very sentries had hard work to keep from going to sleep 
at their posts, there was a soft rustling noise in the tree beneath 
which Tom Long was sleeping ; and after this had been repeated 
several times a lithe Malay softly descended till he was within 
six or eight feet of the ground, when he slipped and fell, but 
regained his feet instantly, as Tom Long started into wakefulness 
and clapped his hand to his sword, upon seeing the strange 
Malay just before him. 

The Malay, however, raised one hand deprecatingly, and 
smiled a very significant smile as he turned to go. 

" Here, stop 1 surrender ! Why ¡ª Oh I I say, Ali ; that's 
capital," he said, as the Malay still smiled at him. " You quite 
took me in." 

The Malay smiled and nodded, and walked straight off to 
where a sentry was watching them both ; and the man, seeing 
the Malay come straight from his officer, made way, saluted, and 
the dark figure passed from the fortified lines and walked away 
towards where the enemy lay amongst the trees. 

" That's a brave thing to do," muttered Tom Long, and resum- 
ing his seat he took another sleep, and was awakened the next 
time by Captain Smithers laying his hand upon his shoulder. 
"Ali has gone," he said. 

" Yes, I know," said Tom Long. " He quite took me in. It 
a splendid disguise." 



''Capital I" said Captain Smithers. " The very sentries were 

puzzled." 

" Yes, of course they would be," replied Tom Long ; and the 
captain walked away. 

" The sentries must have been puzzled before he came to me," 
said Tom Long to himself. " That man yonder, though, seemed 
to take it as a matter of course. I shall be very glad, though, 
when all this hiding and dodging is over, and the hunting party 
are back, for I am not going to believe that they are in danger 
after all." 

And yet Tom Long did believe it, and was as uneasy as the 
rest ; but it was his way of trying to put a good face upon matters. 



CHAPTER L. 



HOW BOB FISHED FOR MISS LINTON. 

To the surprise and gratification of the English party, the jungle 
station remained unmolested for the next two days, giving them 
ample time to make such little additions to the defences as the 
officers thought needful The coming of the steamer gave the 
occupants of the fort command of the water and a way of retreat 
in case of extremities ; moreover, they had the chance of sharing 
the ship's provisions. So that with the knowledge of their power 
of resistance a feeling of confidence began to exist, especially as 

it was evident that the Malays had been taught the danger of 

molesting the little party. 

The enemy came and went from the island in large numbers, 
but kept entirely aloof, making no attempt to communicate ; 
while their strange silence excited suspicion in Captain Smithers' 
mind that some plot was hatching. 

The lieutenant joined him in thinking that there was cause for 
suspicion, and more stringent watch was kept 

Old Dick regretted keenly that for reasons of economy the 
furnace fires could not be kept up, for he argued still that 
plenty of hot water was all that was needed to keep them safe. 
He had, however, to be content with the ordinary precautions, 
promising himself the extraordinaiy as soon as the fires were lit 

The ladies had full occupation in tending the wounded, an 
occupation which saved them from much thinking; for there 
were no tidings of the party, and now that so long a time had 
elapsed it became evident that their worst fears would be 
realized. 

In fact the officers began to debate whether the hour had not 
arrived when they ought to retreat ; but the idea was set aside, 
and once more they determined to hold the station till help 
should come, since for the steamer to go in search of help was 
to condemn the little garrison of the fort to destruction. 

And now as the hours slowly crept by, with the heat and in- 




action growing more and more difficult to bear, every thought 
was directed to the envoy they had sent out, and they waited 
anxiously for All's return, or for some messenger with tidings at 
his hands. 

Though the Malays refrained from attack so long as the 
occupants of the station kept within their lines, any attempt at 
quitting the fort at once drew fire. Consequently the supplies 
within had to suffice, and middy and ensign thought gloomily 
of the past, when sampans brought daily an abundance of deli- 
cious fruit, when flowers were abundant, and fish in plenty was 

supplied. 

Now it was bread or biscuit, and preserved meat either salt or 
tinned, and preserved vegetables, and so much soup that Bob 
Roberts said a man might just as well be living in a workhouse. 

That evening he made up his mind to try for some fish, and 
aided and abetted by Dick, a line was rigged up, and payed out 
over the steamer's stem, the stream carrying down the baited 
hook, but only into a place where there was no likelihood of a 
fish being caught. So another line was attached, and another, 
and another ¡ª long sea-lines each of them, till Bob Roberts sat 
fishing with the end of a line in his hand and his bait about a 
quarter of a mile down the stream. 

To his great delight he found the plan to answer, for before 
long he felt a tug, and drew in a good sized fish. This done, 
he rebaited, and tried again, sometimes catching, sometimes 
losing, a couple dropping off the hook just as they were raised up 
level with the deck. 

It was about an hour before sunset that Bob Roberts set 

Dick to work winding up the lines on the reels to dry, and then, 
having placed the brilliantly scaled fish in the basket, he 
obtained leave from the lieutenant, who looked longingly at 
the catch, and involuntarily made the noise with his lips custom- 
ary with some people at the sight of anything nice. 

"What are you going to do with those, Roberts ?" he said. 

" Take them to the ladies, sir." 

"Ah! yes: of course, the ladies first. We ought to study the 
ladies. But do you know, Roberts, I'm not a ladies' man, and I 
feel an intense desire to have one of those fish ¡ª broiled." 

" Yes, sir, of course ; but I'll come back and catch some more." 
" Yes, do," said Lieutenant Johnson, gazing longingly at the 
fish. " There," he cried hastily ; " for goodness' sake be off 
with them, Roberts, or I shall impound the lot and hand them 
over to the cook. You ought not to put such temptations in a 
weak man's way." 




" All right, sir," said Bob, and he hurried over the side and 
made for the barracks, where, to his great delight, he met 
Rachel Linton, looking very pale and ill, coming away from the 
temporary hospital with her cousin. 

" I've brought you some fish, Miss Linton," he said. " I 
thought they would be welcome just now, as there axe no fresh 
provisions." 

" Doubly welcome, Mr Roberts," cried Miss Linton, with her 
face lighting up. " Oh ! Mary, I am glad. Mr Roberts, I can 
never thank you enough." 

Bob felt rather disgusted that the idol he had worshipped 
should be so fond of the good things of this life. 

" I have been longing for fresh fish, and fruit, and flowers, so, 
Mr Roberts," she continued. ** You cannot get me any fruit or 
flowers, I suppose?" 

" I could go and try for some," said Bob, rather glumly, " but 
you mustn*t be surprised if I don't come back." 

" Oh, no, no ; you must not run any risks," cried Rachel 
Linton. "That would be madness, but I'd give anything for 
some fruit now.'* 

"She'd better think about her father," thought Bob, "instead 
of eating and drinking." 

" Those poor wounded fellows do suffer so for want of change ; 
but this fish will be delicious. Poor Parker will eat some, I 
know. If you can get any fruit for my hospital people, pray do 
so, Mr Roberts." 

"That I will, Miss Linton," he cried joyously. 

"And you'll catch me some more fish for the poor fellows?" 

" Are you going to give all these to the wounded men, Miss 
Linton ? " he said. 

" Yes ; of course," she replied. 

" Why she's an angel," thought Bob to himself, " and I was 
giving her the credit of being a regular pig." 

"Messenger? For me?" exclaimed Captain Smithers, rising 
up as a soldier advanced. 

" Yes, sir ; it's a Malay, and he says he has been sent by the 
young chief, AIL" 



CHAPTER LI 



DEALINGS WITH THE DE2P. 

There was no little excitement at this announcement, and 
Captain Smithers sent at once for Lieutenant Johnson from the 
steamer, while a file of soldiers went for the messenger who had 
asked for admission. 

The ladies were too much interested to think of leaving, so 
Mary Sinclair ran to fetch Mrs Major Sandars, and returned 
with her to see that a rough-looking Malay had been brought up 
to the group she had left. 

Captain Smithers waited a few moments, to allow of the 
coming of the lieutenant ; and meanwhile they all gazed at the 
Malay, a wild, half-naked fellow, whose scraps of clothing were 
torn by contact with thorns, and being soaked with water clung 
to his copper-coloured skirt 

He was scratched and bleeding, and gazed sharply round from 
one to the other in a strange wild-eyed way, as if feeling that he 
was not safe. 

Just then the lieutenant came hurrying up, and the Malay, evi- 
dently supposing him to be the officer he sought,|began to unfasten 
a knot in his sarong, from which he took a short piece of bamboo 
about the size of a man's finger. One end of this was plugged 
with a piece of pith, and this he drew out, and then from inside, 
neatly rolled up and quite dry, a little piece of paper. 

" You Cap-tain Smit-ter ?" said the Malay. 

" No, my man, that is the captain," said the lieutenant, pointing. 

" Cap-tain Smit-ter. Ali Rajah send," said the man, holding 
out the paper. 

" Did Ali send us this ?" said the captain, eagerly. 

" Captain Smit-ter, Ali Rajah send," said the man again. 

" Where did you leave him ?*' said the captain. 

" Cap ¡ª tain Smit ¡ª ter, AJi Rajah send," repeated the man, 
parrot fashion, showing plainly enough that he had been trataed 
to use these words and no more. 





Captain Smithers unrolled the scrap of native paper to find 
written thereon, ¡ª 

" Found the party. Fighting for life in a stockade. Send help 
in steamer up right river.¡ª" All'* 

" Have you come straight from him ?" exclaimed the captain, 
eagerly. 

" Cap ¡ª tain Smit ¡ª ter, AH Rajah send," said the man again, 

" Where is Wilson ?" cried the captain, " or Gray ? Ah, you 
are here, Gray. You have made some progress with the Malay 
tongue. See what this man knows." 

Private Gray came forward, and by degrees, and with no little 
difficulty, learned from the Malay that the English party were 
in an old stockade up on a branch of the river, forty miles away, 
defending themselves against a strong body of the sultan's forces. 

" Ask if they are well," said the captain. 

" He says there are many ill, and many wounded, and that 
they have buried many under the palm trees," said Gray, in a low 
sad voice, " and that when the young chief, Ali, came upon them, 
they were at the last extremity from weakness and hunger," 

Rachel Linton uttered a low wail, but on Mrs Major Sandars 
passing an arm round her, she made an effort and mastered her 
emotion, fixing her eyes on Adam Gray as, in a low, deep voice 
he continued the narrative after, at Captain Smithers' wish, again 
questioning the Malay. 

" He says that after giving him the message to bear, the young 
chief, Ali, left him, saying that he was about to try and join the 
party in the old stockade, and fight with them to the end ! " 

There was a mournful silence at this, and lor a few moments no 
one spoke. Then Captain Smithers leaned towards Lieutenant 
Johnson. 

" Have you any questions to put ?" he said. 

" Yes," replied the lieutenant, and he tmned round to their 
interpreter, 

** Tell me. Gray, what is your opinion of the messenger ?" 

" At first, sir, I thought him genuine ; but since then, there is 
something in his manner that makes me doubt the truth of his 
tale." 

" And yet it seems feasible ?*' 

" Yes, sir, it does ; and I confess I have little cause for doubt- 
ing him ; but still I do," 

Lieutenant Johnson turned to Captain Smithers, and they went 
aside for a few minutes talking earnestly together, while all 
present watched eagerly for the next scene in the drama they 
were passing through. 




"Gray," said Captain Smithers then, sharply, "ask the mes- 
senger if he knows where the old stockade is.'* 

** He says^w, sir, perfectly well." 

" Ask him if he will guide the steamer there." 

" Yes ! " was the reply, " if the English officers would protect 
him from his people, and not let him be seen." 

" Tell him," said Captain Smithers, " that if he is faithful he 
will be handsomely paid; if he is treacherous, he will be hung 
to the yard-arm of the steamer, and his body thrown to the 
crocodiles." 

Gray interpreted this to the Malay, who smiled, uncovered the 
hilt of his kris, drew it, took it by the blade, and knelt down 
before the officers, placing the point upright on the left shoulder 
close to his neck, then reaching oat with his right hand, he 
motioned to Captain Smithers to strike the weapon down into his 
breast. 

" He says his life is yours, sir, and bids you kill him if he does 
not lead you to the stockade." 

" One more question," said Lieutenant Johnson. " Ask him 
if there is water enough up the right river? " 

Gray questioned the Malay, who nodded eagerly and then shook 
his head. 

"He says there is plenty of water, for the river is narrow and 
very deep, all but in once place, about a mile from the stockade, 
and of that he is not sure, he will not pledge himself to its being 
sufficiently deep ; but all Rajah Gantang's prahus have gone up 
and down in safety." 

" That will do," said the lieutenant. 

" Yes," said Captain Smithers, " take him aside, give him some 

food, and guard him well." 

It fell to the lot of Adam Gray to take charge of the Malay 
who ate voraciously of what was placed before him, and then 
smiling his satisfaction he prepared himself a piece of betel nut, 
and lying down in the shade went off fast asleep, evidently 
wearied out. 

Meanwhile a short consultation was held, during which it was 
settled that at any risk the steamer must go to the assistance of 
the beleaguered party, Captain Smithers being on the alert to 
retire into the barracks when it became necessary. 

This place he would have to hold with stubborn determination, 
knowing that the steamer could not be long away, and that 
Lieutenant Johnson was going with the knowledge that those he 
left behind were in need of help. 

The fires were lit on the instant, and every effort made to get 





the steam up, but all was done as quietly as possible, so as not 
to take the Itention of the Malays, and about ten o'clock all was 
ready for the start, when Adam Gray went and roused up the 
Malay. 

The man rose, shook himself, and then accompanied his guide 
without a word, climbing the side of the steamer, where every- 
thing was ready ; the cables were cast loose, and at half-steam 
the great vessel moved softly up the river by the light of the stars, 
which just made their way visible. 

As far as they could see, the alarm of the departure had not 
been spread ; and the steamer glided away so softly, and with so 
little noise, that there was the chance of her escaping the notice 
of the Malays, who might not find out their departure until 
morning. 

This would delay any attack that might be made for many 
hours ; but all the same. Captain Smithers felt it better to at once 
evacuate the outer works, and two hours after the steamer had 
glided away, almost invisible to those who saw her go, the outer 
works were lying unguarded, and the whole of the force safely 
barricaded in the stronghold, with every sentry on the alert. 

Everything had been done in the quietest manner. There 
was neither noise nor loud order; the men caught the lightest 
whisper ; and there was something weird and strange-looking in 
the silent figures moving here and there ; but nothing like so 
weird of aspect as about a couple of dozen dark shadows that 
were creeping over the ground taking advantage of every bush 
or inequality of the ground to cover their movements till they 
reached the deserted earthworks and crouched there exultingly. 

An hour later the sky was overclouded ; and in the darkness 
the Malays came crowding up by hundreds, evidently ready for 
an assault, while most ominous of all was the fact that numbers 
of them bore bundles of light wood, and some lumps of dammar 
ready to continue the task they had had to give up consequent 
upon the steamer's return. 



CHAPTER LIL 



HOW THE STEAMER WENT UP THE RIGHT ARM OF THE RIVER. 

A NIGHT journey on a river when the stars give but little light 
and the banks are dense jungle overhanging the water's edge, is 
one of no little difficulty. Certainly the crew of the steamer had 
upon their side the fact, that the stream, though swift, was deep, 
and its bottom mud. There were no rocks and cataracts to en- 
counter in its lower course ; and even if they did run aground 
there was but little risk to the vessel. But all the same the most 
constant watchfulness was needed, and Lieutenant Johnson him- 
self joined the look-out at the bows, communicating by a chain 
of his men with the engine-room and man at the wheel. 

For some distance after leaving the island they proceeded very 
slowly, little more that mastering the stream ; but as soon as they 
felt that they were beyond hearing the speed was increased, and 
for some miles¡ª through which the course of the river was well 
known ¡ª the " Startler " proceeded at a pretty good rate, so that 

by morning half the journey was accomplished, and they were 
abreast of the stockade they had attacked and destroyed. 

About a couple of miles past this the course of the right river 
opened out, one that a navigator strange to the river would have 
hesitated to take, for it was narrow at the mouth, overgrown with 
trees, and seemed to form a chain of lakes, that were one blaze 
of colour with the blossom of the lotus. 

On the other hand, what seemed the regular course of tne river 
ran broad and clear, and apparently without obstruction of any 
kind. 

The Malay, who was leaning over the bulwark with his mouth 
distended with betel, pointed one brown arm towards the narrow 
branch, and the steamer's engines were slackened and nearly 
stopped while a boat was lowered, and the crew rowed some 
little distance along the winding, sluggish stream, sounding every 
few yards, to find the river extremely deep with muddy bottom ; 
and as it seemed to wind right on precisely the same in character, 





they returned and reported the result to the lieutenant, who at 
once gave orders, and the steamer entered the narrow, winding 
way. 

To all appearance they might have been the first visitors to 
those regions, so haunted was the strangely beautiful scene by wild 
creatures. Birds in abundance fled at their approach. Now it 
was a white eagle, then a vividly plumaged kingfisher, or a kind 
of black, racket-tailed daw with glossy plumage. Parrots of a 
diminutive size and dazzling green plumage flitted before them ; 
and from time to time the lotus leaves were agitated by a shoal 
of fish, that alarmed by the wash of the steamer rushed away. 

Every now and then, too, Bob Roberts, who was feasting on 
what passed like a glorious panorama before him, had his adven- 
ture with Ali in the shooting trip brought vividly to mind, for 
some huge reptile or another shuffled into the slow stream, while 
others lay sluggishly basking, and ill-disposed to move. 

Their progress was slow, for the screw propeller was more than 
once fouled by the thick weed through which they ploughed their 
Way. So dense was it that at times it gathered in large cables, 
stretching from bank to bank, and literally barring further pro- 
gress, till the steamer was backed and ariven at full speed against 
the obstruction, which divided and swept off in hillocks to star- 
board and to port. 

Then a more open stretch of water would be gained, widening 
quite into a lake, and framed in glorious tropical verdure ; large 
pools would be quite free from vegetable growth, and so clear 
that the bright scales of the fish could be seen flashing far below. 
Then the river seemed to wind its way through dense growths of 
lily and other water plants, amidst which water-fowl in endless 
numbers disported themselves, but fled away at the sight of the 
steamer, panting onward through this wilderness of beauty. 

For in spite of the anxiety felt by all, and their eagerness to 
reach the spot where their friends were in peril, it was impossible 
to help gazing with wonder and admiration at the loveliness of all 
around. Where the stream narrowed, the great trees growing to 
the water's edge formed huge walls of verdure, in parts a hundred 
¡ª two hundred feet high ; and over and amidst these wreathed 
and twined the beautiful creepers, filling up every gap with 
leaves of the most delicious, tender green. Then a tree would 
be passed one mass of white and tinted blossoms, another of 
scarlet, and again another of rich crimson, while in every damp, 
sun-flecked opening wondrous orchids could be seen carpeting 
the earth with their strange forms and glowing colours. Pitcher 
plants too, some of huge size, dotted the ground every here and 




there where the steamer passed close to the shore ¡ª so close at 
times that the ends of the yards brushed the trees ; and yet the 
vessel took no harm, for the deep water ran in places to the 
banks, and though often half covered with weedy growth, the 
river was canal-like in its deeper parts, where the sluggish stream 
steadily flowed along to join its more rapid brother miles below. 

For some time now Lieutenant Johnson had been bitterly 
regretting that he had not insisted upon bringing Private Gray, 
so as to have an interpreter, for his own knowledge of the Malay 
tongue was almost nil. And yet he was obliged to own that it 
would have been unjust to rob them at the station of part of 
their strength, when at any moment they might want it alL 

Bob Roberts was the better Malay scholar of the two, but his 
vocabulary only extended to asking for a durian, Good morning ! 
How are you? and the favourite Malay proverbial saying, ¡ª 
^^Apa boleh booatT* ¡ª It was to be, or It couldn't be helped. 

They had been progressing now for hours, and the heat was 
insufferable ¡ª a heavy, moist heat, in that narrow way, shut in 
between two walls of verdure, and yet there seemed to be no 
signs of their journey being nearly ended. Under the circum- 
stances Bob Roberts was set to try and get some information 
out of their guide, whom he tried with *' Good morning," in the 
Malay tongue ; and then, after a civil answer to his remark, 
plunged at once into plain English with, ¡ª 

" How much farther is it ? " 

The Malay looked hard in his eyes, and Bob repeated the 
question. 

The Malay seemed to divine what he meant, for he raised one 
bare brown arm and pointed forward along the course of the 
river. 

It was a mute but conclusive reply, telling the middy plainly 
enough that they had fartner to go, and once more the attention 
of all was taken up by the navigation of the narrow, winding 
channel 

Still there was no fault to be found with Ali's message, for the 
water was deep, and though the steamer seemed at times to be 
running light into the bank, there was always room to turn what 
looked to be an ugly curve, and onward they went through the 
dense jungle. 

On either side the primeval forest seemed to stretch away, 
and where there were changes of a more park-like character, so 
rare was the sight of a human being there that the shy pea-fowl, 
all metallic plumage and glorious eyes, could be seen gazing at 
the steamer before taking flight There were deer too seen 



occasionally, and had this been a pleasure trip the sportsman 
would have had ample use for rifle or gun. 

But this was no pleasure trip, for the deck was cleared for 
action, and the men were at their quarters, ready to send shot 
or shell hurtling through the jungle whenever there should be a 
reason for such a step. 

Another hour, and another, and still the Malay guide pointed 
before him, gesticulating a little sometimes as if bidding them 
hasten onwards. 

The speed was increased at such times, though it was risky, 
for the narrowness of the course, and the size of the steamer, 
rendered the greatest care necessary to avoid running her bows 
in among the trees. 

Lieutenant Johnson stamped impatiently at last as the sun was 
descending behind the trees, and still the Malay pointed onwards. 

** It is enough to make one think it a wild goose chase !" he 
exclaimed. " We have made a grievous mistake in not having 
an interpreter. Roberts, you ought to be able to speak the 
Malay tongue." 

" Yes, sir," said Bob, " I ought I " And then to himself, " So 
ought you ! " 

Another hour and they were passing through a denser part than 
ever ; so close were they that the large drooping boughs of some 
of the trees cracked and rustled and snapped as they passed by 
to get to what seemed to be quite a lagoon shining clear and 
silvery, as seen by those on board the steamer through quite a 
tunnel of overhanging branches. 

" We ought to be able to hear firing by this time if it is going 
on at the stockade," said the lieutenant. "What a place to 
bring Her Majesty's ship into ! If I did not know that those poor 
fellows were anxiously expecting help, not a fathom further 
would I take the steamer than into yon open water to-night ! 
Here ! fetch that Malay fellow here, and let's see if we cannot 
get something out of him ! " 

Bob Roberts went forward to where the Malay stood leaning 
over the bulwarks gazing at the trees on either side ¡ª at least he 
went to where the Malay did stand gazing at the trees, but now 
to Bob's astonishment the man was not there ! 

''Where's the Malay guide ? " he said sharply to Dick, who was 
nearest to him. 

'* Well, sir, if you^call that there chap a guide," said Dick, " I've 
done." 

*'I say Where's the Malay guide?" said Bob, angrily. 

" Haven't seen him, sir," said Dick, touching his cap. 





" But he was standing here not ten minutes ago, just before 
we brushed against those trees I " exclaimed the young officer. 

" Well yes, sir, I remember as he was," said old Dick, and 
several of the sailors were ready to affirm that they saw him not 
five minutes before. 

A look round the deck showed that he was not there, and Bob 
stood looking puzzled ; for the man had evidently looked upon 
himself almost as a prisoner, and not free to go about ; he had 
consequently stood leaning against the port bulwark all the time, 
except when he had squatted on the deck to partake of the 
food supplied to him. 

" Couldn't have been knocked overboard by the boughs, could 
he, sir ? " said Dick. 

" Impossible ! " exclaimed the middy ; and he hurried off to 
report the fact that the Malay was missing. 

" Are you sure ? " exclaimed the lieutenant sharply. 

** Certain, sir ! He's nowhere on deck !" 

'* I thought as much ! *' cried the lieutenant angrily. *' Good 
heavens, Roberts ! that we could have been such idiots ! Gray 
was right ! " 

**I do not understand you, sir." 

" Understand ? It's plain enough 1 That man. Private Gray, 
said he suspected the fellow, and yet we allowed him to gull us 
with his plausible story. Here, look sharp there ! " he cried, as 
the steamer stood out now free of the tunnel-like canal through 
which she had passed, and was now approaching the centre of a 
tolerably broad lagoon- 

The lieutenant gave his command in short, sharp, decisive 
tones, and a minute later a little anchor fell with a splash into 
the water, and the steamer swung in the just perceptible stream. 

" I dare not attempt the journey back to-night, Roberts,'* he 

said. " We should be aground in the thick darkness before we 
had gone a mile." 

"But won't you go forward, sir? We must be near the 
stockade ! " exclaimed Bob. 

" If we go on till the river becomes a ditch, we shall find no 

stockade here, Roberts 1 " cried the lieutenant. *' Why should 
there be one? There is neither campong nor sampan upon the 
river, and it is evident that there is no trade. No, Roberts, we 
have been tricked ¡ª cheated, and we must get back at full speed 
as soon as day begins to break. I have been uncomfortable for 
hours now, as I felt that our poor friends could never have come 
through such a forest as this. It is only passable for beasts I * 
" But the Malay and his message ? " 





" The Malay is as great a cheat as the old fniit-seller ; and 
that message was never written by young Ali, unless he, too, is 
an enemy 

" My life upon it, he is not," cried Bob. 

" Then either he has been killed, or our plans were overheard, 
or betrayed, or something or another ! That fellow ¡ª I see it all 
now it is too late ¡ª has quietly led us up here, awaiting his 
chance, and it came when those big boughs swept the side. He 
swung himself into one of the trees, and is by this time on his 
way back to his friends." 

" But the jungle is not passable ! " siid Bob. 

" Then he will make a bamboo raft and get down the riven 
Oh, that we could be such fools P' 

Bob Roberts stood in the gathering darkness staring at his 
superior oificer, and trying hard to believe that the Malay might 
have been swept over by accident ; but by degrees he felt his 
mind veering round to the lieutenant's ideas. 

The next minute orders were being given respecting the watch 
on deck, every light was extinguished, and extra care taken lest 
they should have been led into a trap and attempts be made to 
board the steamer during the night. But as the hours glided on, 

all they heard was the distant roar of some beast of prey, or an 
occasional splash in the water ¡ª sounds that had a strange attrac- 
tion for Bob Roberts, as, with no thought of going to his cot, he 
leaned against the bulwark watching the fire-fiies amid the trees, 
and mournfully wondered how they were getting on at the 
station, and what had become of Ali, shuddering again and 
again as the lieutenant's ominous words recurred to his mind. 



CHAPTER LIIL 



PRIVATE SIM IS VERY WIDE AWAKE. 



Lieutenant Johnson had said that in all probability All had 
been killed, this being of course his surmise, for he had no real 
reason for such an assertion. He was quite right, though, about 
having been tricked, for one of Rajah Gantang's cleverest spies 
after hearing from his hiding-place the plans that had been 
made, assumed the part of Ali in disguise, and passed un- 
challenged by the sentries to go straight to the rajah and plan 
with him a way to divide the forces by sending the steamer upon 
a false scent. 

This had been done, with the success that has been seen. 
But though the little garrison was awakened to a sense of its 
danger very soon after the steamer had taken its departure, it did 
not realize the fact that they had all been deceived. 

All the requisite precautions had been taken, and saving the 
guard, the little garrison had lain down to sleep, according to 
Captain Smithers' instructions, for he had addressed them 
before they were dismissed. 

'* There may be no danger," he had said, " but we must be on 
the alert, so let every man lie down in his clothes, with his arms 
close at hand. Sergeant Lund, see that the men's pouches are 
supplied with cartridges. To-morrow, my lads, I hope to see 
the steamer back, with our rescued friends I " 

The men gave a cheer and departed. The guard was relieved, 
and Captain Smithers stood talking to Tom Long. 

?* My dear lad," said the former, ** there is not the slightest 
need for any such proceeding. Go and lie down. I shall visit 
the sentries for the first half of the night, and I will call you 
about three." 

" I don't feel much disposed for sleep," said Tom Long, whc 
looked uneasy. 

" You are not welL The heat has overdone vou a little. You 




go and have a good sleep," said the captain. " To-morrow I 
hope we shall have the doctor back among us to set us right." 

** I hope so, too," said Tom Long, gloomily ; and going to his 
quarters he lay down, with his sword and revolver beside him, 
ready for use. 

Adam Gray was off duty, and he, too, had gone to lie down. 
But he could not sleep, neither did he wish to do anything else 
but lie there and think about Rachel Linton, and how pale and 
unhappy she appeared. He longed to speak words of comfort to 
her, and to say others as well j but he dared not, for his position 
forbade it. Still he could not help feeling that she did not look 
unkindly upon him, nor seem to consider him to be one of the 
ordinary soldiers. 

He sighed as he thought of other days, and then lay listening 
to the humming noise made by the mosquitoes ¡ª wondered 
whether Rachel Linton was asleep or awake ¡ª whether, if she 
was awake, she was thinking of him. 

Then he drove away the thoughts with an angry exclamation, 
and determined to think about her no more. But as he turned 
his face to the open window, and listened to the faint hum of 
the night insects, Rachel Linton's face came back, and he was 
thinking of her again, and this time in connection with Captain 
Smithers. 

He knew the captain loved her, and instinctively hated him 
¡ª Private Gray. He felt, too, that by some means or another 
the captain knew of, and hated him for, his presumptuous love ; 
the more so that Rachel Linton did not seem to care in the 
slightest degree for the captain's adv^ices, but rather avoided 
him. 

Private Gray turned again and again, but he could not lie 
there any longer for the uneasy feeling that tormented him. 

The men in the long room slept easily enough, but he could 
not, and he told himself that he might just as well get up and 
go and watch with one of the sentries, for then he would be 
doing something towards protecting the station. 

He rose then softly, and fastening on his belt with the bayonet 
attached, he went cautiously out into the night air, to see that 
though the stars twinkled brightly, the night was very dark. 
All was perfectly still, and as he went cautiously round every man 
seemed to be on the watch, when suddenly a thought struck 
him which sent a cold shiver through his breast 

He was standing just beneath the window of the officers' 
quarters, where he knew that Rachel Linton and her cousin 
would be sleeping, and the sentry nearest, the man who should 




be on the keenest watch, was, if he was not mistaken, Private 
Sim. 

He could not make out for certain from where he stood, but 
he felt almost certain that this was the case, and that Sim was 
occupying the most important outpost of the little fort 

With his heart beating wildly he crept back to the place 
where the men lay asleep, and going on tiptoe from one to the 
other, he satisfied himself by the dim light of the lamp swinging 
from the roof that Private Sim was not there. 

" It was utter madness," he muttered to himself. ** Lund 
should have known," and in his excitement he recalled to mind 
the night when he had found him asleep. 

He remembered, too, what a fearful night that was, and 
he felt that this might prove to be just as dangerous, as he 
hurried back, catching up his rifle and pouch as he went, and 
then going quietly along to where Private Sim was stationed. 

It was undoubtedly the weakest spot about the fort, and in 
place of one untrustworthy man, two of the most trusty should 
have been stationed there. By some error of judgment, how- 
ever, this was not done, and Private Sim held the lives of all 
in the little fort within his hand. 

Gray thought that after all he might be misjudging him, and 
therefore he went on cautiously, listening as he stopped from 
time to time, and expecting to be challenged ; but there was no 
sound to be heard, and as Gray went closer it seemed to him 
as if no sentry had been placed there. But as he went nearer 
there was no error of judgment upon his part. It was as he 
suspected. Private Sim was seated on the ground, his rifle 
across his lap, fast asleep, and quite oblivious of the fact that 
his messmate stood close beside him, panting with rage and 
disgust. 

" You scoundrel ! " he cried in a low, passionate voice. " Do 
you not know that the punishment may be death for sleeping 
at a time like this ? " 

As he spoke he struck the sleeper heavily upon the head with 
the butt of his rifle, and Sim started up and grappled with him, 
just as a dozen Malays sprang out of the darkness, and made at 
the defence between them. 

The struggle between the two was but brief, for Gray threw 
Sim off, and brought his bayonet to bear against the Malays, 
forgetting in his excitement to load and fire, so that it was Sim's 
rifle that gave the alarm. 

For the next few minutes the two men fought side by side, 
their bayonets keeping the Malays back every time they strove 



to enter the place, and driving them off successfully till help 
came, and two or three volleys did the rest. 

" How was this? How did it happen that you did not see the 
enemy approaching sooner, Private Sim?" said Captain Smithers, 
sternly 

Sim trembled for his life, knowing as he did that over matters 
of discipline the captain was a stern man, and that he must expect 
no mercy for his fault if Gray spoke out, and told all he knew; 
so he exclaimed hastily, and with a malicious look at Gray, ¡ª 

" How could I, sir, when there are traitors in the camp ? " 

" Traitors ! What do you mean ? " 

" I mean a traitor, sir ! Private Gray there came up behind 
me, leaped upon me, and held his hand over my mouth to keep 
me still, while he whistled to the Malays to come in by the 
opening, there." 

" You lying¡ª" 

" Silence, Private Gray ! " cried Captain Smithers, and all that 
was evil in his nature came to the surface, as he felt that here 
was an opportunity for disgracing, if not putting his rival to 
death ; and a strange feeling of savage joy animated him for the 
moment. "Silence, Private Gray!" he cried. "Speak out, 
Private Sim. Do you mean to assert that this man served you 
a^ you say ? " 

" Look at me, sir ! " cried Sim, showing his disordered uni- 
form. " That was done in the struggle ] and I did not fire as 

soon as I could have wished." 

" Show me your rifle, Sim," said the captain, 

Sim held out his piece, while, choking with rage and astonish- 
ment, Gray stood speechless in their midst 

The piece was examined, and it had just been discharged. 

" Show me your piece, Gray," said Captain Smithers. 

Gray held it out, and it was quite clean. It was not loaded, 
and it had not lately been discharged. 

" I tried as hard as I could, captain ! " whined Sim ; " but he 
came upon me so sudden like, that I was mastered at once." 

" What were you doing there. Gray ? You were not on duty. 
Your place was in bed." 

" I could not sleep, sir," said Gray. " I doubted this man, 
and I came to see." 

"Why, you jumped right on me, sudden like, out of the 
darkness ! " said Sim. 

"Silence, Sim !" said the Captain. " Gray, this charge must 
be investigated. You are under arrest Sergeant, put this man 
in irons 1" 



* But, Captain¡ª" 

" Silence, sir ! You can make your defence when you are 
tried by court martial" 

" I hope, captain,*' whined Sim, " that it won't be my doing 
as he's punished. I'd a deal rather help a fellow than get him 
into trouble." 

" You are on duty, sir ! Attend to your post ! " cried Captain 
Smithers. 

He turned angrily then on Private Gray, who was so cruelly 
mortified, especially as, glancing upward, he saw the window was 
open, and Rachel Linton and her cousin there, that he could 
not or would not speak a word in his defence. He gave Sim a 
look that made that scoundrel shiver, and then said to himself, ¡ª 

" She will not believe that I am a traitor I " 

He glanced involuntarily upwards as this thought occurred to 
him, and the captain ground his teeth with rage as he saw the 
glance ; but feeling as he did that he had his rival beneath his 
heel, a glow of triumph ran through him. 

The next moment, though, all that was gentlemanly and true 
came to the surface, and he felt that Private Gray was not the 
man who could be guilty of such a crime. Sim must be the 
offending party, and Gray be too proud to speak. He could not 
iiron him, or doubt his honour ; he was too true a man ; and as 
Sergeant Lund unwillingly came forward with a file of men, the 
captain motioned him back. 

" This is no time for making prisoners," he said. " Sergeant, 
change the sentry here. Place two men on guard. Private 
Sim, go to the guard room : I may want to question you. 
Private Gray, this is an awful charge against you, and if you are 
guilty you will be shot." 

There was a faint sound as of some one's breath catching at 
the window above, but it was heard by Captain Smithers and 
Private Gray alone as they stood face to face. 

" I know it, captain I " said Gray, quietly. 

" We are in face of the enemy," continued Captain Smithers. 
" Take your rifle again, and help to defend the place. You had 
better die by the spear of a Malay. Go to the guard-room now ; 
and mind, if any words pass between you and Private Sim ¡ª " 

** Quick, sir, the alarm ! " cried Gray, pointing out beneath 
the stars. * * The enemy ! " 

" Fire, sentry ! " cried Captain Smithers ; and the report of a 
rifle rang out on the still night air, for the Malays were advanc- 
ing in force. 

Fresh shots were fired on all sides as the men turned out, and 




were at their various places in a very few moments, the wisdom 
of the captain's commands being manifest ; and as he saw 
Private Gray go down on one knee and begin firing, with careful 
aim, at the advancing enemy, ¡ª 

*' He's no traitor," he muttered; *'and I never doubted him 
at heart." 

He had no time for further thought, for the attack had become 
general, and the Malays seemed furious, striving hard to gain an 
entry, but always encountering one or two bayonets at every 
point, till, after half an hour's fierce struggle, they drew back, 
leaving a number of dead and wounded around the place. 

The defenders of the little fort drew breath at this, and as the 
firing ceased, the major's wife, with Rachel Linton and her 
cousin, came round, first with refreshments for the exhausted 
men, and, as soon as they were distributed, began to bandage 
those who were wounded. 

It was while they were busy over this task, that m the dark- 
ness Rachel Linton came upon a man leaning against the breast- 
work, gazing attentively out at the position of the enemy. 

" Are you wounded ? " she asked ; and at her words Private 
Gray started round and faced her. 

" Only slightly,'* he said, " in body ¡ª but deeply in spirit." 
" Let me bind your wound," said Rachel Linton, hoarsely, and 
her voice trembled as she spoke. 

" Which ? " he said bitterly, as they stood alone. 
" Let me bind your arm," she said quietly now, as she drew a 
long breath. 

" It is but a scratch," he said carelessly, " a spear thrust." 
Without another word Rachel Linton slit open the sleeve of 
the jacket he wore, and deftly bandaged the double wound, 
for the thrust had gone right through Gray's arm. Then rising, 
she stood before him for a moment or two. 

" You asked which wound would I bind up, Adam Gray," she 
said sadly. ** I have bound up one. If my words will help to 
bind up the other, let me tell you that I do not believe the foul 
charge made against you." 

The rifle fell against Gray's wounded arm as he caught the 
speaker's hand in his, and raised it to his lips. 

" You have done more," he said ; " you have healed it." 

For the next few moments he stood there as if holding the 

hand in his, though Rachel Linton had hurried away. Then he 

started, for he became aware that Tom Long had seen what 

hid taken place, and was now standing leaning on his sword. 

But he did not speak, he only turned away, leaving Gray 


watching, and thinking hopefully now of the charge he had 
to meet. 

" Smithers is a gentleman," he said to himself; " they cannot 
shoot me for what I have not done." 

Then he began to wonder how the steamer had sped, and how 
soon they would bring back their friends. This was the more 
important, as he felt sure that a few such determined efforts on 
the Malay's part, and the little garrison must succumb. 

" He is a brave young fellow, that Ali," he thought, " and has 
managed well." 

Then he stood gazing out over the dark ground in front, where 
here and there he could make out the dimly seen form of 
some unfortunate combatant, who had not been carried off by 
his friends. 

It was darker now than ever, and he was silently watching 
for danger, when a faint rustling noise caught his ear, and he 
brought his piece down to the present, for undoubtedly one of 
the bodies lying on the dark earth was in motion, and crawling 
slowly towards where he stood. 



CHAPTER LIV. 

THE END OF ALl's MISSION. 

Adam Gray's finger was on the trigger of his piece, but he did 
not fire, though he carefully covered the figure before him, and 
watched attentively to make sure that it was no hallucination. 
He had marked that figure before ; one that lay face downwards, 
apparently just as the man had fallen from a shot. And now the 
dimly seen arms had changed positions ¡ª there was no doubt of 
that ¡ª and the figure was crawling forward 

V/hat did it mean ? Either it was a poor wounded wretch, 
striving hard to get relief and help, or else it was a trick on the 
part of a treacherous Malay, who was trying to put in force a 
North American Indian's tactics, and creeping fomvard to stab 
a sentry. 

" And so gain an entrance into the fort/' thought Adam Gray. 
" Well, my poor wretch, you will not do it, unless both my rifle 
ball and bayonet shoald miss." 

Just then the figure stopped, and lay quite motionless ; and 
again Gray hesitated, feeling sure that he must have been 
deceived, as lie gazed now at the figure where it lay, some 
twenty yards away. 

There it was, perfectly motionless, and in that darkness Gray 
felt that he really could not be sure about it. After all, the 
figure might be lying where it had first lain. It was impossible 
to say. 

His doubts were dispelled the next moment, for the figure 
was once more in motion, and stopped short as the lock of the 
sentry's rifle clicked. 

" Don't shoot ! " said a voice in English ; " I am a friend." 

" If you move again, I fire ! " said Gray in a low, stem voice. 
? Who are you ? " 

*' Is that Private Gray ? " said the voice. 

" Mr Ali, is that you ? " cried Gray, leaning towards him. 

" Yes, it is I," said the figure, crawling rapidly towards him. 




" What are you doing with the enemy? " 

" Trying to make my way to you. They will not see now. 
Give me your hand, and I will climb up." 

Gray leaned out over the breastwork, gave his hand to the 
young man, and, with a little exercise of his muscular strength, 
half-drew, half-aided him to climb into the stronghold ¡ª ^just as 
Captain Smithers and Tom Long leaped upon them, seizing 
each his man, and holding his sword to his throat. 

" You doubly - dyed scoundrel ! " cried Captain Smithers. 
" Caught him in the act I Call the guard there ! " 

" Don't you know me. Long ? " said a voice that made Tom 
lower his sword point. 

*' Ali I " cried Captain Smithers ; " you here? '* 

" Yes, I am back," said the young man sadly. 

" Gray, my good fellow," cried Captain Smithers, " fate seems 
to have ordained that I should doubt you." 

** Fate is sometimes very cruel to us all, sir,*' said Gray, coldly, 
as the captain set him free, and turned to Ali. 

" You found them, then ? " 

" No," said Ali, sadly. 

" But the stockade ? " 

? What stockade ? " 

" Where youfound them. Thesteamer went off early in thenight." 

** The steamer went off? Where ? " 

" Don*t waste time, man, in puzzles," cried the captain, 
excitedly, as he felt that something was wrong. " You sent a 
messenger ? " 

*' I sent no messenger," said Ali, excitedly. 

" Yes, yes ; the man with the writing in a bamboo ? " 

" I sent no man,'* said Ali, sadly, " You have been cheated 
¡ª overreached by your enemies." 

" But did you not find them? " 

" No, I was hemmed in at every turn ; and at last, in despair 
I have crawled back here, hardly saving my life, your sentries 
are so keen." 

" This is dreadful," said Captain Smithers. " How we have 

been deluded!" 

He took a few steps to and fro, and then paused before Ali, 
gazing at him searchingly, 

" Sir," he said, " we are each of different nations, and your 

people are at war with mine. Why should I trust you ? why 

should I believe in your words ? How do I know that I am not 

talking to one who believes it to be a virtue to slay people 

of my creed ? " 



Ali looked at him wonderingly for a few moments before he 
spoke, slowly, ¡ª 

"Because you know that I am honest," he said; "and if 
I am not, you have your resource there. Kill me." 

Captain Smithers resumed his agitated walk to and fro. 

" This is dreadful I " he said, excitedly. ** Those poor fellows 
have been inveigled away like the hunting party, and perhaps 
by this time there is a second massacre.'* 

" I think you exaggerate,'* said Ali, quietly. " The hunting 
party have been led away by a ruse, and the steamer sent upon 
an errand by a clever trick. But Captain Horton and Major 
Sandars are not men to give up the lives of their following 
without a bitter struggle. And as for Lieutenant Johnson ¡ª " 

" And Mr Roberts," interposed Tom Long. 

" Yes, with Mr Roberts," said Ali, '* he is too strong in guns 
and men to be easily overcome, unless by ¡ª " 

" Treachery ? Yes," said the captain. ** And that is what I 
dread." 

" To such an extent," said Ali, with a quiet smile, " that you 
doubt your friends." 

" For the moment only," said Captain Smithers, holding out 
his hand, which the other frankly grasped ** You must remember 
my position, sir." 

" I do," said Ali. " Now give me a rifle and revolver ; we 
may be attacked at any moment." 

" We ?" said Tom Long holding out his hand. 

" Yes," said Ali, smiling ; " and if we get safely through this 
trouble you will have to try and make me more of an English- 
man than I am." 

Even while he was speaking the Malays renewed their attack 
with the greatest pertinacity, it being evident that their object 
was to capture the fort before the steamer could render help. 
They seemed to be roused to a pitch of mad fury by the resist- 
ance they encountered and their losses, attacking with such 
determination that it needed no words on Captain Smithers' 
part to warn his little garrison that they must fight to the death. 

With a civil ized-^nemy it would have been quite reasonable to 
have surrendered long ago, but with such a foe as Rajah Gantang, 
a pirate of the worst Malay type, such an act as surrender would 
have meant giving all up to a horrible death. 

Never was daylight more welcome than when it appeared to 
the defenders of that little stronghold, who, gaunt, haggard, and 
faint with exertion, saw the sky suddenly turn to orange and gold ; 
and then the sun rose over the widespread jungle, sending the 




wreathing night-mists floating amidst the feathery palms, and 
seeming to dissolve into thin air. 

The first order given by Captain Smithers was to have a sig- 
nal of distress run up to the top of the flagstaff; the next to try 
and strengthen the defences, which were sorely dilapidated. 
Some of the barricading planks and forms were torn down, others 
riddled with bullets. 

Through the rough straw mattresses spears were sticking in a 
dozen directions, and what had looked hopeless again and again 
during the night seemed doubly so by day. 

But Captain Smithers was not made of the stuff to give up. 
He had those under his charge whom he was ready to render his 
life to save ; and the spirit that animated his breast seemed to 
infuse itself in the spirits of the others. He was half mad with 
jealousy ; and angered almost beyond bearing at the thought 
that Rachel Linton should favour, as he was sure now that she 
did, a private soldier in preference to him. But he cast away 
all narrow selfishness, for he was obliged to confess that Gray 
was no common man, but evidently a gentleman by education if 
not by birth. 

Casting aside, then, all unworthy thoughts, he roused Tom 

Long from a short sleep that he had made him take. He said a 
few encouraging words to the men, and then went to join the 
ladies, who had anticipated his wishes, and were ready with plenty 
of refreshments for the jaded defenders of the fort. 

It is wonderful what efficacy there is in a cup of hot coffee 
and a big biscuit. Men who, ten minutes before, had stood rifle 
in hand, dejected and utterly worn out, lost their haggard looks 

and seemed to pull themselves together after partaking of the 
cup of comfort that the ladies brought round. 

Rifles were wiped out, belts tightened ; and with brightening 
eyes the men seemed ready to give a good account of the enemy 
when they closed in for their next attack. 

" I have bad news for you, Captain Smithers,'' said Rachel 
Linton to him, quietly, as she took the cup she had given him 
from his hands. 

" I don't think you can give me worse news than I already 
know," he said, sadly. 

" Yes, but I can," she said, with her brows knitting with pain 
for his suffering. " The heat of the day will soon be upon us, 
and we have no raoxQ water." 

These words roused the captain to a less selfish view of things, 
and he stood for a moment or two thinking. It was indeed a 
tantalizing position, for, glittering and sparkling in the sun, there 





before them flowed the bright river, no drop of whose waters 
could be reached on account of the thronging enemy. 

" I will see to it at once," he said, quietly ; and as Miss Lin- 
ton left him, Tom Long came up. 

" We must have a well dug at once," he said " Take charge 
here, Long, while I pick out a place." 

Ensign Long assumed the command, but now without any oi 
his old consequential airs. Adversity was taming him down, 
and to his surprise he found himself talking in a very different 
tone to his men, who yielded a readier obedience than of old. 

Captain Smithers was not long in selecting a place for the 
well, and in a very few minutes a squad of men were at work, 
some digging, others bearing off the earth in baskets to pile up 
in front of weak places and add to their strength. 

It was a hard call upon the men, that digging ; but even while 
they worked the demand for water arose, and they slaved at their 
task, knowing the tortures that waited them should they not 
succeed 

Every man worked in turn, except those badly wounded, 
though even some of those carried away the baskets of earth. 

Among others. Private Gray was ready to aid in this way, after 
vainly trying to handle a spade, a task rendered impossible by his 
wound. He was hard at work over his work, carrying basketful 
after basketful with one hand, when Captain Smithers came up, 
saw how he was striving, and stood looking on for a few moments. 

"We shall have to put off your court martial yet. Gray," he 
said grimly. ** Give me that basket. Sit down awhile." 

Gray was ready to resist, but his officer's words were law, and 
sitting down to rest, and wipe the streaming perspiration from his 
face, he watched his captain slave away at the toil with the others, 
for in those perilous times show and uniforms were forgotten. 

It proved to be a harder task than had been anticipated. 
Captain Smithers had expected to find the subsoil of the island 
all soft alluvial earth, in which, from the neighbourhood of the 
river, there would be an abundance of water. It had never 
occurred to him that if the island had been of soft earth it would 
long before have been washed away. It was found to be rock 
at a short distance down, composed of a soft limestone, through 
which they had to chip their well. 

A dozen times over alarms of attack ¡ª some real, some false ¡ª 
were given, when spade, pick, and basket had to be laid on one 
side, and rifles seized. The attack repelled, the fight for water 
was renewed ; and to the intense delight of all, about ten feet 
down the pure life-giving element came gushing in a clear 
current from the rock. 





Meanwhile Ali's eyes, which were more experienced in the 
ways of the enemy than those of his companions, read plainly 
enough that far from being damped by their ill-success they were 
preparing for a more general assault, and he confided his opinions 
to Tom Long. 

" I can't see any difference," said Tom Long, after a careful in- 
spection through his glass. " They looked just like that every time 
they came on, and ¡ª ah ! there are some more of them, though." 

" More," echoed Ali, " They are doubled in number. Look, 
too, at the way in which they are making bundles of reeds and 
canes." 

"Well, let them," said Tom Long ; " our rifle bullets will go 
through those fast enough. If I were Smithers, I'd give them a 
good searching fire now, and let them know that our rifles make 
fine practice at a thousand yards' distance. Those fellows are 
not six hundred." 

" Better wait till every shot is more likely to tell," replied Ali. 
** The bullets would of course go through those bundles of cane ; 
but do you not see what they mean ?" 

" No," said Tom Long, quietly, " unless they mean to burn us 
out." 

" That is what they do mean," replied Ali. " And look ! 
Quick ! give the alarm I They are coming on at once I " 

" Let them," said Tom Long, phlegmatically. ** They won't 
alarm us. Nice people your fellow-countrymen, Ali !" 

" Fellow countrymen !" said the young Malay, scornfully. 
** My fellow-countrymen are gentlemen ! These are the scourings 
of the country, with half the scoundrels from Borneo, Java, and 
Sumatra ¡ª men who have lived all their lives upon piracy and 
murder." 

"Well, whatever they are," said Tom Long, coolly, "they are 
coming on, so I may as well let the lads know. All right, though ; 
every one is on the alert, and I daresay we can give a good 
account of them before they get back. Are you sure that these 
are all a bad lot ?" 

" Sure ?" cried Ali. " They are the scum of the east." 

"Then we'll skim them a little more," said Tom Long. 
" Hi ! sergeant, let me have a rifle and some cartridges ; I think 
I should like to pot a few cut-throat pirates myself." 

Sergeant Lund handed him the required rifle, Captain 
Smithers coming up at the moment, and as he swept the sur- 
roundings of the little fort with his glass his countenance changed 
a little, for grave as had been their position before, he felt now 
that unless help quickly came it was absolutely hopeless. 



CHAPTER LV. 



HOW THE HUNTING-PARTY FARED. 

There was a thick mist hanging over the forest when the bugle 
rang out the reveilli, and, some eagerly, some thinking rest the 
better thing, all the hunting-party began to gather outside their 
tents, where the best apologies for tubs and baths were provided 
for the officers. 

No sooner, however, did the Malays see this than they laugh- 
ingly led the way to a little river, evidently a tributary of the 
Parang, and setting the example plunged into its deep, clear, cool 
waters, showing themselves to be adepts at swimming, and 
laughing to scorn the idea of there being any crocodiles there. 

The water was deliciously cool, and one and all the officers 
gladly availed themselves of the jungle bath, emerging fresh, 
and their nerves toned up ready for any work that was to fall to 
their lot that day. 

By the time they returned to the camp an al fresco breakfast 
was ready, half English half Malay. There were tea and coffee, 
potted meats and sardines, and side by side with them, 
delicious Malay curries, made with fresh cocoa-nut, sambals of 
the most piquant nature, and fresh fish and blacbang ¡ª that 
favourite preparation of putrid shrimps. Fruits were in abund- 
ance ¡ª plaintains of various kinds, mangosteens, lychees, and 
durians smelling strong enough to drive away a dozen Tom 
Longs, had they been there. In short, the sultan had given 
orders that his cooks should do their best ; similar instructions 
had been given by Captain Horton and Major Sandars ; and the 
result was a breakfast fit for a prince ¡ª who could put up with 
a picnic and a campstool, beneath an umbrageous tree. 

" Whatever you gentlemen do," said Doctor Bolter, " pray 
restrain your appetites. You see," he said, taking his seat cross- 
legged, like the Malays, in front of a dish of blachang, and ils 
neighbour a delicious chicken curry, " you will to-day be exposed 
a good deal to the heat of the sun j you will exert yourselves, no 




doubt ; and therefore it is advisable that you should be very 
moderate in what you eat and drink. Thanks, yes, major, I will 
take a glass of claret before my coffee. What a thing it is that 
we can get no milk." 

So saying, the doctor set to work *' feeding ferociously," so 
Captain Horton said, with a laugh, and partaking of everything 
that took his fancy, finishing off with a cigarette. 

The sultan smiled his satisfaction as he sat at the head of the 
table, eating little himself, but giving instructions from time 
to time to his slaves that they should hand fruit and other 
delicacies to the guests that were near him. 

The various officers followed the doctor's example, telling one 
another that they could not be far wrong if they imitated their 
medical guide. The only one who did not seem to e^joy 
his meal was Mr Linton, who felt worried, he hardly knew 
why, about their position. 

Now that he was away from the residency, an undefined 
sense of trouble had come upon him, and he could not help 
feeling how helpless they must be if the Malays turned against 
them. Certainly they were all well-armed, and could make a 
brave fight, perhaps win their way back ; but if they did, he felt 
sure that something would have gone wrong at the island. 

The preparations for the fresh start chased away his fore- 
bodings, and the packing having been rapidly performed, soldier, 
sailor, and Malay were soon in motion, the long train winding 
its way through the dense jungle, with the rattan panniers and 
howdahs of the elephants brushing the lush verdure on either side. 

The morning was deliciously cool, and as they went on and 
on through the forest shades, where at every turn something 
bright and beautiful met their gaze, the whole party were in 
the highest spirits ; and the discipline only being kept tight as to 
the order in which they marched, the men laughed and talked, 
sang and smoked, and seemed to be thoroughly enjoying them- 
selves. 

And certainly it would have moved the spirit of the most 

cankered denizen of a city to see the beauty of the parasites 
that clustered and hung from tree to tree. The orchids were of 
the most brilliant colours ; and now and then they passed a lake 
or pool in the depths of the jungle which would be covered in 
places with the flower of the lotus, while in every sunny opening 
the great clusters of nepenthes ¡ª the pitcher plant ¡ª brightened 

the scene. 

These latter delighted the Jacks amazingly, and not being 
allowed to break their ranks, they sent the Malays near them to 





pick anything that took their fancy. These " monkey cups," as 
they called them, were constantly picked ostensibly for the pur- 
pose of supplying the sailors with a drink, for each contained 
more or less water ; but it was never drunk, for in each there were 
generally the remains of some unfortunate flies, who had gone 
down into the treacherous vegetable cavern, and being unable 
to clamber out had miserably perished. 

During the heat of the day there was a halt once more, the 
Malays staring at the sailors and soldiers sitting about under 
the trees for a quiet smoke and watching the elephants, which, 
being relieved of their pads and howdahs, walked straight into a 
great pool near to which they were halted, and then cooled 
themselves by drawing their trunks full of water and squirting it 
all over their sides. 

" I'm blest," said one of the Jacks, *' if they ain't the rummest 
beggars I ever see. Just look at that one, Bill. Lor* if he ain't 
just like a bit o' annymated hingy rubber." 

" Ah ! " said his mate, " you might fit a pair o' blacksmith's 
bellows on to the muzzle o' that trunk of his, and then blow him 
out into a balloon." 

" When are we going to begin to hunt tigers ? " said another. 
" Oh, we ain't going to hunt them at all, only keep *em from 
coming by us, and driving 'em up to where the orficers are." 

" I say," said another sailor, " this here's all very well, but 
suppose some time or another, when these Malay chaps have got 
us out into the middle of these woods, they turn upon us, and 
whip out their krises ¡ª what then ? " 

" What then ? " said a soldier, who heard him ; " why then we 
should have to go through the bayonet exercise in real earnest ; 
but it won't come to that." 

Two more days were spent in the journey, and then, upon his 
guests beginning to manifest some impatience, the sultan 
announced that they were now on the borders of the tiger 
country ; and that afternoon there were preparations for a beat 
when a couple of tigers were seen, but they managed to escape. 

The"" sultan smilingly told his guests that at the end of another 
march the game would be more plentiful ; and once more there 
was a steady tramp along one of the narrow jungle paths, into 
a country wilder than ever ¡ª for they were away from the rivers 
now, and no traces of cultivation had been seen. 

There was no dissatisfaction, though, for if the officers shot 
no tigers they found plenty of jungle fowl and snipe, upon which 
they tried their powers with the gun, and made goodly bags of 
delicious little birds to add to the daily bill of fare. 




Another day, and still another, in which the expedition 
penetrated farther and farther into the forest wild. The officers 
were delighted, and Doctor Bolter in raptures. He had 
obtained specimens of the atlas moth, a large flap-winged 
insect, as large across as a moderate dish -, he had shot sun- 
birds, azure kingfishers, gapers, chatterers, parroquets ; and his 
last achievement had been to kill a boa-constrictor twenty-four 
feet long. 

It was no dangerous monster, but a great sluggish brute, that 
had hissed at him viciously and then tried to escape. But the 
doctor had for attendant a very plucky little Malay, appointed 
by the sultan, and this man was delighted with his task, following 
the doctor anywhere. Upon this occasion he had come upon 
the serpent lying coiled up, evidently sleeping oflf a repast of a 
heavy kind. 

The boy shouted to the doctor, who was trying to stalk a 
lizard in an open place ; and this roused the serpent, which 
began to uncoil, one fold gliding over the other, while its head 
was raised and its curious eyes sparkled in the sun. 

The boy waited his opportunity, and then darting in cleverly 
avoided the reptile's teeth, and caught it by the tail, dragging the 
creature out nearly straight as he called to his master to fire. 

The serpent was apparently puzzled by this proceeding, and 
threw itself round a tree, hissing furiously as it menaced its 
assailant Then sending a wave along the free part of its body 
to the tail, the Malay was driven flying on to his back amidst 
the canes. 

The retreat of the reptile was cut off, though, for this inter- 
ruption gave the doctor time to come up with his little double 
fowling-piece, from which a quick shot sent the menacing, 
quivering head down upon the earth; and then going up, a 
second shot placed the writhing monster hors de combat. 

There was no little mirth in the camp as, faint and perspiring 
profusely, the doctor and his Malay boy came in, slowly drag- 
ging the long quivering body of the serpent, which the former 
at once set to work to skin before it should become offensive. 
Then the skin was laid raw side upwards, and dressed over 
with arsenical soap, a dose of which the Malay boy nearly suc- 
ceeded in swallowing, being attracted by its pleasant aromatic 
odour. 

*' Laugh away," said the doctor, "but I mean to have that 
skin set up and sent to the British Museum, presented by Doctor 
Bolter," he said importantly. 

" Well," said Captain Horton, " for my part I would rather 



encounter a fierce Malay than one of these writhing creatures. 
Take care of yourself, doctor, or you'll be constricted." 

" Yes/' said Major Sandars, entering into the joke, " I'll give 
orders that every swollen serpent is to be bayonetted and opened 
if the doctor is missing." 

" Laugh away," said the doctor; *' I don't mind." 

" That's rig " t," said Captain Horton ; " but for goodness* sake, 
man, wash your hands well before you come to dinner." 

**A11 right," said the doctor; and that evening, after dinner, 
he took the Malay boy into his confidence. 

" Look here," he said, " I want to shoot an Argus pheasant. 
There must be some about here." 

"Argus pheasant?" said the Malay boy, staring, and then 
shaking his head. 

'* Yes, I heard one last night" 

Still the boy shook his head. He had never heard of such a 
bird. 

*' Oh, yes, you know what I mean,*' said the doctor ; " they 
keep in the shelter of the jungle, and are very rarely shot ; but 
I must have one." 

The boy shook his head. 

" Don't I tell you I heard one last night, after we had camped 
down? It calls out Coo-aiJ^ 

*'No, no ! no, no ! " cried the boy ; Coo-ow, Coo-ow!^ 

*' YeSj that's it," cried the doctor. " You know the bird. 

" Yes, know the big spot bird ; all eyes," said the boy. ''Sees 
all over himself, like a peacock. Hunter no shoot him, see 
too much far." 

" But I must shoot one," said the doctor. 

"Yes, you shoot one," said the boy. " I take you to-night." 

The doctor rubbed his hands and was delighted ; and after the 
dinner, when the officers and chiefs were sitting smoking and 
sipping their coffee by the light of the stars, he rose and took his 
gun, for the Malay boy was waiting. 

" Off again, doctor?" cried the major. 

" Yes," said the little man, importantly. " I am going, sir, to 
add to my collection a specimen of the celebrated Argus pheasant 
¡ª Phasianus Giganteus,^^ 

" No, no, doctor ; no Latin names after dinner," cried several 
voices. 

" As you please, gentlemen," he said, 

" The sultan says, shall he send a score of his men to protect 
you ? " cried Captain Horton. 

" For goodness' sake no 1 " cried the doctor in dismay. " My 


dear sir, this bird is only to be shot by approaching it most 
cautiously at night, or by laying patiently near its haunts." 

" Laying what, doctor ¡ª eggs ? " said a young officer." 

"No, sir; a stick about the back of impertinent puppies," 
cried the doctor, angrily, " I said lying ¡ª lying in wait near 
the bird's haunts." 

" Oh, I beg your pardon," said the young officer ; and the 
doctor went off in dudgeon. 

" I say, Thompson," said the major, " don*t you be poorly, 
whatever you do, until the doctor has got over it, or he'll give 
you such a dose." 

"I'll take care, sir,'' said the young man; and they went on 
chatting about other things. 



CHAPTER LVI. 

DOCTOR bolter's BIRD. 

Meanwhile the doctor followed his Malay boy ¡ª as he was 
called, though he was really a man ¡ª through a narrow path right 
away from the camp and into the jungle. 

The doctor was ruffle<i exceedingly at his slip of grammar, and 
looked very much annoyed ; but the thought of being able to 
secure a specimen of the much-prized Argus pheasant chased 
away the other trouble, and he walked on closely behind his guide. 

" How far have we to go, my lad ? '' he said. 

" Walk two hours," said the Malay, " then sit down and listen. 
No speak a word till Coo-ow come. Then make gun speak and 
kill him 1 " 

" To be sure ! " said the doctor, nodding his head ; and then 
almost in silence he followed his guide, often feeling disposed to 
try and shoot one or other of the nocturnal birds that flitted 
silently by, or one of the great fruit bats that, longer in their 

spread of wings than rooks, flew in flocks on their way to devas- 
tate some orchard far away. 

Quite two hours had elapsed, during which the Malay, ap- 
parently quite at home, led his scientific companion right away 
through the gloom of the wilderness. 

At last he enjoined silence, saying that they were now ap- 
proaching the haunts of the wondrous bird ; and consequently 
the doctor crept on behind him without so much as crushing a 
twig. 

They had reached an opening in the forest by the side of what 
was evidently a mountain of considerable height, and the doctor 
smiled as he recalled the fact that the Argus pheasant was re- 
puted to haunt such places ; when to his intense delight there 
suddenly rang out from the distance on the silent night air a 
peculiar cry that resembled the name given to the bird ¡ª Coo-ow* 
For the moment it seemed to the doctor as if some Australian 
savage was uttering his well known Coo-ay^ or as if this was the 





Malays' form of the cry. But he knew well enough what it was, 
and following his guide with the greatest caution they crept on 
towards the place from which the sound had seemed to come. 

It was weird work in that wild solitude far on towards mid- 
night, but the doctor was too keen a naturalist to think of any- 
thing but the specimen of which he was in search. He knew 
that the native hunters, out night after night, could not shoot 
more than one of these birds in a year, and it would be quite a 
triumph if he could add such a magnificent thing to his collection. 

CoO'OW I rang out the strange cry, and it seemed quite near. 
Then again Coo-ow, and this time it appeared to be a long way 
off. 

This was tantalizing, but he concluded directly after that the 
second cry might be that of another bird answering the first. 

They were now in amongst a number of low bushes, which 
gave them cover, while it made the surrounding country less 
black than when they were in the jungle path. There they could 
only grope their way with outstretched hands ; here they could 
have gone on at a respectable foot pace without danger of run- 
ning against some impediment in the path. 

The doctor cocked both barrels of his gun, after opening the 
breech and making sure that the cartridges were in their place, 
and, in momentary expectation of getting a shot, he kept close 
behind the Malay. 

CoO'OW I came the cry again, this time a little to the left ; and 
the Malay stretched out a hand behind him to grasp that of the 
doctor as he went cautiously on. 

CoO'OW I again, but a little farther off, and with his nerves 
throbbing with excitement, the doctor kept up the chase, now 
seeming close to the bird, then being left behind, but never once 
getting within shot 

It was very provoking, but the guide was in earnest, and the 
doctor would have gone through ten times the trouble to achieve 
his end. 

And so they stole on through the thick brushwood, with the 
bird repeating its cry so near from time to time as to make them 
feel that they must get a shot directly ; but still the hope was 
deferred. 

A lighter patch in front showed that the forest was a little more 
open, and the Malay loosed the doctor's hand for a moment to 
clamber over a block of stone ¡ª when there was a rushing noise, 
what seemed to be a heavy blow, a hoarse cry, and then silence, 
broken directly after by a low deep growling just in front of 
where Doctor Bolter stood ¡ª petrified and unable to move. 




He was too much taken aback by the suddenness of the inci- 
dent to comprehend for a time what had taken place ; but directly 
after, with his hands wet with excitement, and his heart seeming 
to stand still, he realized that some great animal had been stalk- 
ing them, as they had been stalking the Argus pheasant, and, 
waiting for its opportunity, had sprung upon and seized the 
Malay. 

There was the low snarling growl not two yards from where 
he stood, just the noise upon a larger scale that a cat would 
make when crouching down over the rat that it had seized ; and 
the doctor felt that there could be only one creature in the jungle 
that would seize its prey in such a manner ¡ª the tiger. 

In spite of his bravery and the strength of nerve that had 
often made him face death without a tremor, Dr Bolter felt a 
cold shiver pass through him as he realized how near he was 
to a terrible end. The tiger might have seized him instead of 
the Malay ¡ª in fact, might spring upon him at any moment ; 
and as he felt this, he brought the barrels of his gun to bear 
on the dark spot where the tiger lay crouching upon its victim, 
and with his fingers on both triggers stood ready to fire at 
the first movement of the beast. 

That first movement, he knew, might be to spring upon him 
and strike him down ; and nature bade him flee at once for 
his life ¡ª bade him drop his gun, run to the first tree, and 
climb into its branches ¡ª escape as a timid beast, a monkey, 
might have done. 

Education, on the contrary, bade him stay ¡ª told him that it 
would be the act of a coward and a cur to run off and leave the 
poor fellow lying there to his fate, the horrible fate of being torn 
and half devoured by the tiger ¡ª bade him be a man, and do 
something, even at the risk of his own life, to save the Malay who 
had been stricken down in his service \ and as these thoughts 
came to Doctor Bolter his eyes dilated in the darkness, and he 
strove to make out the positions in which tiger and man were 
lying. 

It was some time before he could make this out, and then it 
seemed to him that the tiger had struck the Malay down upon 
his face, and was lying upon him, with his teeth fixed in his 
shoulder. 

Just then the unfortunate man uttered a loud cry, when the 
tiger gave an angry snarl, and Doctor Bolter was able to assure 
himself of their relative positions. In fact there was the side 
of the tiger's head not six feet from him, and dare he fire it 
was almost impossible to miss. 




But the gun was loaded with small shot, and even at so 
close a range he might injure the unfortunate Malay, if he 
were not beyond the point when a fresh blow would do him harm. 

Doctor Bolter stood unable to move. He did not feel very 
much alarmed now, the danger was too near, but he could not 
for the moment act. 

At last, though, his nerves seemed to become more set, and 
setting his teeth he held his piece ready, and with one motion 
advanced his left foot and went down on his right knee, at the 
same time raising his gun to his shoulder. 

It was done in a moment ¡ª the tiger raising its head from the 
victim with a savage roar* when with the mouth of the piece not 
eighteen inches from the creature's head, Doctor Bolter drew the 
triggers, almost together. 

There was a brilliant flash in the darkness, which showed him 
the glistening teeth of the savage beast and its glaring eyes ¡ª a 
double report ¡ª and with a furious roar the monster sprang 
forward, crashing into some bushes, and then all was stilL 

Quick as lightning the doctor threw open the breech of his 
piece, and inserted this time a couple of ball-cartridges, closed the 
gun, and stood ready for the monster's attack, knowing though 
that it must be sorely wounded, for he had aimed straight at its 
eye, and the small shot would, at that distance, have the effect of 
a bullet. 

A minute ¡ª two minutes, that seemed like hours, did the 
doctor stand there, expecting to hear some movement on the 
tiger's part, either for attack or retreat ; but it did not stir, and 
he dared not fire again at random. 

Just then there was a low groan, and a faint movement at his 
feet. 

The doctor's piece swung round involuntarily, but directly 
after he recalled that it must be the Malay, and with dry throat 
and lips he spoke to him. 

" Are you much hurt ? " 

There was a few moments' pause, and then the Malay spoke. 

" My shoulder is gnawed ; I can't use my arm." 

"Can you crawl behind me?" said the doctor, hoarsely. 

For reply the Malay rose to his feet, and staggering slightly, 
he made his way behind where the doctor stood 

" I dare not move," said Doctor Bolter. " The beast may 
spring upon us again." 

"No," said the Malay, whose voice sounded stronger; "he 
is dead. Have you a light ? " 

The doctor held his gun with one hand and pulled out his 





match-box with the other, when, in spite of his wounds, the 
Malay knelt down, drew a piece of dammar from the fold of his 
sarong, stuck it in a cleft stick, and then striking a match he 
fired the dry grass and lit the dammar, which made an excellent 
torch. 

With this advanced he took a couple of strides forward, and 
holding the light down, there lay the tiger on its side, the 
white under fur showing plainly, the doctor seeing that the 
creature's neck and les^s were stretched out, and that it was 
indeed dead. 

"Thank heaven!" he muttered, fervently; and standing his 
gun against a tree he set to work piling up dead wood and 
dry canes to make a fire, when "by its light and that of the 
dammar torch the doctor proceeded to roughly dress the Malay's 
wounds. 

The tiger had seized him by the muscles of his left shoulder 
and clawed the upper part of his arm ¡ª terrible wounds enough, 
but not likely to prove fatal j and when the doctor had done all 
he could to make the poor fellow comfortable, the Malay lay 
down, gazing up at him as he trickled a little brandy from his 
flask between the poor fellow's lips. 

"You are good," he said at last, '*You saved my life. Now 
I shall save yours.'' 

" Save mine ? " said the doctor. ** Well, I hope we shall have 
no more tigers to face," 

"No," said the man, "not from tigers, but from men. You 
did not eat blachang to-night ? " 

" No," said the doctor. " Why ? " 

"Sultan Hamet had toohah put in it to-night : same as to make 
fish sleep." 

"What? I don't understand you!" cried the doctor 
citedly. 

"Sultan Hamet means to have all the English krissed to-night 
while they sleep," said the Malay ; " but you have saved my life : 
J shall save yours." 



CHAPTER LVII. 



HOW DOCTOR BOLTER GOT IN A MESS. 

Doctor Bolter felt as if the place was swimming round him, 
and the fire-light seemed to dance as he heard these words. 
Then, as he recovered himself somewhat, he gazed full in the 
Malay's eyes, to see that the man was looking up at him in the 
calmest and most unruffled way. 

" Are you mad ? " exclaimed the doctor. 

" No," said the Malay. " I say what is right Sultan Hamet 
joins with Rajah Gantang to kill off all the English ¡ª the sultan 
here ; the rajah there, with his prahus." 

" It is impossible !" cried the doctor. " You are deceiving me." 

" No, no, I tell the truth," said the man ; " but you shall not 
be hurt. Let them kris me first. You shall live.'' 

*' Let us get back," cried the doctor, seizing his gun; and the 
tiger with the beautiful skin, which he had meant to have for a 
specimen, was forgotten, 

" No, no," said the man, " you must stay in the jungle. The 
tigers are better than Hamet." 

** Can you walk ? " said the doctor, quietly. 

The man got up for answer. 

** Can you find your way back ? '' said the doctor. 

" Yes," said the other, with a scornful look. " I could find the 
way with my eyes blinded." 

" Then start at once. Here, take some more of this," 

He gave the injured man another draught from his flask, for 
the poor fellow seemed terribly faint 

The few drops of brandy gave him new life, and he displayed 
it by throwing himself on his knees before Doctor Bolter, and 
clasping one of his legs with his uninjured arm. 

" Don't go back, master," he cried piteously. " You have 
been so good to me that I could not bear to see you krissed 
Stay away, and I will keep you safely. My life is yours, for you 
saved it; and I am your slave." 




" My good fellow," said the doctor, sadly, as he laid his hand 
upon the Malay's shoulder, " you do not understand Englishmen." 

*' Yes, yes, I do," cried the Malay. " I like ¡ª I love English- 
men, I was servant to the yoimg chief Aii before the sultan had 
him krissed." 

" Young Ali krissed ? " cried the doctor, 

" Yes, he was too much friends with the Englishmen, and made 
the sultan jealous." 

" And the wretch had that brave, noble young fellow killed ? " 

" Yes," said the Malay, sadly. ' ' His father, the Tumongong, 
prayed upon his knees that the brave bo/s life might be spared, 
and offered to send him out of the country. But the sultan 
laughed, and said that the young chief would come back again 
with a swarm of English soldiers, and seize the jewels, and put 
him to death, and make himself sultan. Then the Tumongong 
swore an oath that Ali should never come back, and went down 
on his face before Sultan Hamet ; but the sultan drew his kris 
and pricked him with it in the shoulder, and told him that he 
should die if he named his son again." 

" The villain ! That brave, noble young fellow, too ! " said 
the doctor, excitedly. 

" Yes j he was so brave and handsome," cried the Malay, 
" I loved him, but I was obliged to hide it all, for if I had spoken 
one word they would have krissed me, and thrown me into the 
river. So I had to be silent ; but when they wanted some one 
to go with you I offered, and they said * Yes ' because I could 
speak English, and the sultan gave me my orders." 

" And what were they ? " said the doctor, sharply. 

"To wait till to-night, and then lead you out ino the jungle if 
you did not want to go, and stab you with my kris." 

** And you did not do it? *' 

The Malay smiled, and drew his kris in its sheath from out oi 
the folds of his sarong, handing it to the doctor. 

** I am not a murderer,'^ he said. 

" But suppose the sultan had asked you why you did not kill 
me," said the doctor, "what then?" 

" I should have told him a lie. He is a liar, and full of deceit. 
We do not think it wrong to deal with such a man in the coins 
he gives. I should have said you kept me back with your gun." 

" Take your kris, my lad," said the doctor, quietly. " I trust 
you. Now lead me back to the camp." 

" No, no," cried the Malay. " I dare not. I cannot take you 
back to death." 

'* I ¡ª must ¡ª go,*' said the doctor, sternly ; and the Malay made 
a deprecating gesture, indicative of his obedience. 




?* My people may have proved too strong for Sultan Hamct 
and his treacherous gang.'* 

" Yes ¡ª yes ¡ª they may," cried the Malay, eagerly. 

" They may have given him such a lesson as he will never forget." 

" I hope they will make him forget for ever," said the Malay 
in a sombre tone. " He is not fit to live. My kris is thirsty to 
drink his blood." 

" Forward, then ! " cried the doctor, " and tell me when you 
feel sick. Find water if you can, first thing. Does your wound 
pain you ? " 

"It feels as if the tiger kept biting me," was the reply; "but 
I do not mind Shall we go back ? " 

" Yes ] and at once," cried the doctor, and following his com- 
panion, they rapidly retraced their steps through the dark jungle, 
the guide, as if by instinct, making his way onward without a 
moment's hesitation, seeming to take short cuts whenever the 
forest was sufficiently open to let them pass. 

As he stumbled on over the creeper- covered ground, the doc- 
tor had many a narrow escape from falling, and he could not 
help envying the ease with which his guide passed the various 
obstacles around them. The chief thought that occupied the 
doctor's mind, though, was that which related to the drugging 
of the party's food that evening. 

The Malay had mentioned what drug was to be used, namely 
toohahy a vegetable production ¡ª in fact the root of a plant which 
the doctor knew that the Malays used to throw in the pools ot 
the rivers and streams, with the effect that the fish were help- 
lessly intoxicated, and swam or floated on the surface of the 
water. This plant he had several times tried to obtain and 
examine, while he made experiments upon its power ; but so far 
he had been unsuccessful. Would it have the same effect upon 
the human organisation that it had upon a fish ? That was the 
question he had to solve in his mind ; but no matter how he 
turned the subject over, he could extract not the smallest grain 
of comfort. 

The only hope he could derive from his thoughts was that 
the English discipline, with its regular setting of sentries and 
watchfulness, might be sufficient to defeat the enemy's machina- 
tions, and a sufficiency of the officers and men be unaffected by 
the poison to make a brave stand until the rest had recovered. 

That might happen ; and slightly roused in spirit by this hope, 
he kept steadily on. One thing was fixed in his own mind, and 
that was that it was his duty to get back to his party, either to 
fight with them, to help the wounded, or to share their fate. 




" Not that I want to die," muttered the doctor. " There*s 
that collection of butterflies unpinned ; no one but me could set 
up all those birds, or understand the numbering; and then 
there's that boa-constrictor wants dressing over ; and worse than 
all, I've killed my first tiger, and have not saved its skin." 

" Humph I " he exclaimed directly after, " it seems as if I am 
to have a hard job to save my own skin/* 

Just then the Malay reeled, and caught at a tree they were 
passing, when the doctor had only just time to catch him and 
save him from a hea\y fall. 

Laying his gun aside, he eased the poor fellow down upon the 
tangled grass, trickling a few more drops from his flask between 
his lips, and then giving the flask a bit of a shake to hear how 
much there was left 

** Better now," said the Malay, trying to rise. " The trees run 
round." 

** Yes, of coarse they do to you," said the doctor. " Lie still 
for a while, my good fellow. Is there any water near here ? " 

" Little way on," said the Malay, pointing. " Listen ! " 

The doctor bent his head, and plainly enough heard a low 
gurgling noise. Following the direction in which the sound 
seemed to be, he came upon a little stream, and filled, by holding 
on with one hand to a little palm and hanging down as low as 
he could, the tin canteen slung from his shoulder. From this he 
drank first with avidity, then refilling it he prepared to start back, 

" And I always preach to the fellows about not drinking un- 
filtered water," he muttered. " I wonder how many wild water 
beasts I've swallowed down. Well, it can't be helped ] and it was 
very refreshing. Let me see ! Bah ! How can I when it's as 
dark as pitch ! Which way did I come?" 

He stood thinking for a few moments, and then started off, 
cautiously trying to retrace his steps ; but before he had gone 

twenty yards he felt sure that he was wrong, and turning back 

tried another way. Here again at the end of a minute he felt 
that he was not going right, and with an ejaculation of impatience 
he made his way back to where the stream rippled and gurgled 
along amidst the reeds, canes, and beneath the overhanging 
branches. 

It was not the spot where he had filled the canteen, but he 
knew that he must be near it ; and he started agam, but only to 
have to get back once more to the stream, where there was a 
rush, a scuffling noise and a loud splashing, that made him start 
back with a shudder running up his spine, for he knew by the 
sound that it must be a crocodile. 



Worst of all he was unarmed, having left his gun beside the 
fainting Malay, 

All he could do was to back as quietly as he could into the 
jungle, with canes and interlacing growths hindering him at every 
step ; thorns tore and clung to his clothes, and he felt that if 
any creature gave chase to him it must overtake him directly. 
His only chance of safety then was in inaction ; and fretting with 
annoyance he crouched there, listening to the shudder- engen- 
dering crawling noise made by evidently several loathsome 
reptiles about the bank of the stream. 

After a while this ceased, and he made another attempt to get 
back to the Malay, going on and on through the darkness, and 
from time to time shouting to him. He knew that he must be 
crossing and recrossing his track, and blamed himself angrily 
for not being more careful. His shouts produced no response, 
and the matches he lit failed to give him the aid he had hoped ; 
and at last, utterly exhausted, he sank down amidst the dense 
undergrowth to wait for daylight, with the result that nature 
would bear no more, and in spite of the help he knew his com- 
panion needed, the danger of his companions, and the perils by 
which he was surrounded from wild beasts, his head sank lower 
and lower upon his breast, and he slept. 

Not willingly, for he kept starting back into wakefulness, and 
walked to and fro; but all in vain, sleep gradually mastered him; 
and he sank lower and lower, falling into a deep slumber, and, 
as he afterwards said, when talking about the adventure, " If I 
had been in front of a cannon, and knew that it was to be fired, 
I could only have said ¡ª Just wait till I am fast asleep, and then 
do what you please." 

The sun was up when he started into full wakefulness, and his 
clothes were drenched with dew. 

" If I don't have a taste of jungle fever after this, it's strange 
to me," he said, hastily swallowing a little white powder from a 
tiny bottle. " A stitch in time saves nine, and blessed is the 
salt quinine.'' 

"Humph! that*s rhyme," he grunted. "Only to think that 
I should go to sleep. Ahoy-ey 1" he shouted. 

There was no reply, and his heart smote him as he felt that he 
had neglected the poor Malay. Then he felt that he was lost 
in the jungle ; but that did not trouble him much, for he was 
sure that if he followed the little stream he should find that it 
entered a larger, and that the larger would run into one larger 
still, probably into the Parang, whose course he could follow 
down. But that would be only as a last resoiurce. 



CHAPTER LVIIL 



THE DOSE OF TOODAH. 

Doctor Bolter^s was a painful position, and he could not 
help feeling how utterly weak man is in the midst of nature's 
solitudes. He could have stood meditating for long enough, but 
he had to find his companion ; and after shouting for some time 
and getting no answer, he listened for the rippling noise of the 
stream, and heard it sounding very faintly far off on his right. 

Making for it as a starting-place, he found the tracks he had 
made, the grass being trampled down in all directions. What 
was more, he found his trail crossed over and over again, and 
even followed by that of crocodiles, whose toes were marked in 
the mud wherever it was laid bare. 

7'wice over he startled one of the reptiles, which fled before 
him with a rush into the stream, which was little better than an 
overgrown ditch, and the doctor hastily backed away. 

He soon found that all endeavours to hit upon his way back 
by the trail were useless, and once more he began to shout. 

To his great delight his cry was answered, and on making for 
the sound he heard directly after the rustling of bushes being 
thrust aside, and soon after stood face to face with the Malay. 

" I have been sleeping," said the latter, smiling. " My arm is 

better now." 

" If our English fellows could stand injuries like these ! " 
muttered the doctor, who looked with astonishment at the light 
way in which the Malay treated the terrible injury he had re- 
ceived. 

" Do you feel as if you could lead the way back?" he said, 
after halting and rebinding the Malay's wound. 

*' Oh, yes," the Malay said cheerfully ; and he at once set off. 

" But my gun?" cried the doctor. " I have left it behind." 

The man led him back to the place with the greatest ease, and 
after wiping the wet and rust from lock and barrel, they set off 
through the dripping undergrowth, and had been walking about 




half an hour, the doctor's excitement growing each minute as 
they drew nearer the camp, when his guide suddenly stopped 
and laid his hand upon the other's arm. 

" Listen ! " he said ; and as he spoke there was the distant 
sound of a shot, then another, and other. 

\ Thank heaven ! " cried the doctor, " they are making a fight 
for it. Get on quickly." 

They went on along an old overgrown track, with the sound of 
the firing growing each minute nearer ; and the doctor's heart 
beat joyfully as he made out that a pretty brisk engagement was 
going on. 

Soon, however, the firing began to drop off, to be renewed 
from time to time in a straggling manner; and to his great joy 
the doctor found that those who fired were coming along the 
track he was upon. 

" Yes," said the Malay, who seemed to read his countenance ; 
" but they may be enemies.'* 

Yielding to the latter's solicitations, they hid themselves 
amidst the dense undergrowth a few yards from the track, and 
waited patiently. 

It was not for long. Soon after they had taken their stand 
they could hear voices ; and directly after the doctor hurried 
out as he saw an advance guard of the men of his regiment 
under a lieutenant. 

The men gave a hearty Hurrah t as they saw him, and the 
lieutenant caught him by the hand. 

" Glad to see you, doctor ; we thought you killed." 

"Yes; and I did you," cried the doctor. "How are you all?" 

" They'll tell you behind/' said the lieutenant '* Forward, 
my lads." 

The guard moved on, and the doctor came upon the little 
force, firing going on again in the rear. 

He met Major Sandars directly, and their greeting was warm 
in the extreme. 

"The scoundrels tried to poison us," said the major. 

"Yes, yes, I know," cried the doctor; " but is any one hurt?" 

"A few scratches there in the dhoolies," said the major. 

" No QTLQ killed ? " 

"Not a soul, thank heaven," cried the major, "But we shall 
have our work cut out. Ah, here's Horton. All right in the rear? " 

" Yes," was the reply; " we are keeping them back. Ah, doctor, 
I am glad to see you again. You know what's happened ? " 

" Partly," said the doctor; " but tell me." 

They were moving forward as he spoke, and he learned now 




that the little force was working to hit the river higher up in its 
course, and from thence try to communicate with the island and 
the steamer. 

" You had not been gone above a couple of hours before, as 
we were sitting smoking and chatting, and thinking of turning 
in, first one and then another began to complain of pain and 
drowsiness. 

" The major there was the first to take alarm, thinking it was 
cholera ; but it was Mr Linton who saved us. He no sooner 
realized what was the matter than he slipped out of the tent, and 
without waiting for orders made his way to the sergeant's 
guard, and got the fellow on duty to collect all the men he could 
to come up to the tent. How many do you think he got ? " 

" Twenty ¡ª thirty ¡ª how should I know ? " said the doctor im- 
patiently. " Go on." 

" Four," said the captain. "All the others were down and 
half delirious. Fortunately my Jacks had escaped, and thirty 
of them seized their rifles, and followed Mr Linton at the double 
to the hut. 

" T]iey wQie just in time. That scoundrel Hamet had given 
an order and withdrawn from the tent; at one end of which 
about a hundred of his cut-throats had gathered, kris in hand, 
and were only waiting for us to get a little more helpless before 
coming upon us to put us out of our misery. 

" Bless your heart, doctor ! it would have done you good to 
see the Jacks clear that tent at the point of the bayonet I And 
then, while half of them kept the enemy at bay, the other half 
brought in the sick men, and laid 'em side by side till they were 
all under canvas. 

"It was horrible, I can tell you," continued the captain, 
" We were all in great pain, but the dull sleepy sensation was 
the worst, and it seemed no use to fight against it. We all, to a 
man, thought that we were dying, and so did the sailors, who 
had not touched the horrible stuff. And yet we could hear every 
word as plainly as if our power of hearing had been increased, 
though we could not speak. 

" ' Give them water,' I heard the sergeant say. 

No, no,' said my boatswain ; ' you get the rum keg in, my 
lad, and give 'em a strong dose apiece o' that.' 

" The Jacks fetched it in under fire, and they gave us a tre- 
mendous dose apiece, and I believe it saved our lives !" 

" I'm sure it did," said the doctor. " It set up a rapid action 
of the heart, and that carried off the poison." 

** I dare say it did," said the captain, " but it gave me a beautiful 





headache. However, the sergeant and the boatswain lost no 
time, but took matters in their own hands, cut the ropes, and 
let the tent go by the board, for fear the enemy should set it on 
fire, and then made the best breastwork they could all round us, a 
little party charging out every now and then and bringing in boxes, 
cases, tubs, everything they could lay hold of, to strengthen out 
position. One time they fetched in half-a-dozen spades, another 
time the axes ; and little by little they formed such a defence, 
that tipped as it was by our fellows' bayonets, the Malays dare 
not try to force. 

"We soon found, though," he continued, "that they were 
furious with disappointment, for spears began to fly till our lads 
searched the nearest cover with some bullets, when the enemy 
retired a little farther, and then the boys got in the spears and 
made an abattis with them. 

" In spite of the danger and the sudden surprise, our fellows 
enjoyed it, for they had the pleasure of driving the scoundrels 
out of their own camp, and they had to put up with the shelter 
of the trees all night They made four savage attacks upon us, 
though, and the first time, from too much ground having been 
covered by the breastwork, the enemy nearly carried all before 
them, and it came to bayonetting and the spears getting home ; 
but our brave lads drove them back, and then a few volleys sent 
them in to cover. 

" The next time they attacked, the major and a dozen of the 
soldiers were ready to help a little. They were too ill to do 
much, but they held their pieces and made a show of bayonets, 
and the major managed to take the command. 

" The next time we all of us managed to make a show of 
fighting ; while a couple of hours after, when the enemy made 
their last and most savage attack, they got such a warm re- 
ception that they let us have the rest of the night in peace." 

" And this morning, then, you began to retreat ! " 

" Yes," the major said, " there was nothing else for it" 

" But why not have retreated by the way we came ? " said the 
doctor, 

" Because, my dear fellow, the whole country's up, and this 
was the only way open. If we had gone by the track our fel- 
lows would have been speared one by one, for the jungle is too 
dense to skirmish through. But here's Linton ; he will tell you 
better than I can." 

As the retreat continued, the rearguard being always closely 
engaged with the Malays, who pressed upon them incessantly, 
Mr Linton came up, begrimed with powder, and shook hands. 




" This is a horrible affair, doctor ! " he said sadly. 

*' Don't say horrible," said the other, cheerfully. "We shall 
fight our way through to the river." 

"I hope so," said Mr Linton. "But we have scarcely any 
provisions. Not more, certainly, than a day or two^s rations. 
That is bad enough ? but you do not understand my anxiety. 
We have let ourselves be drawn into a trap, and the whole 
country rises against us." 

**Let it rise," said the doctor, sturdily; "we'll knock it down 
again." 

" But the residency, man ¡ª the steamer I " 

" Phew ! " whistled the doctor. " I had forgotten them." 

" I had not," said Mr Linton, sadly, "and I fear the worst" 

" Keep up your spirits, man. There are those on the island, 
and aboard that steamer, who will keep every Malay in the 
country at bay." 

" If they are not overcome by treachery, as we nearly were." 

" We must hope then," said the doctor ; " hope that those in 
charge will be more on the alert. I say, though, Linton, did 
you give these people credit for such a trick?" 

" Yes ; for I have had more experience of them than you ; 
and I blame myself most bitterly for not being more cautious." 

" Regrets are vain," said the doctor. " Let's do all we can to 
make up for our lapse ¡ª if lapse it has been." 

" We will," said the resident. " Would to heaven, though, 

that I could feel more at ease about those we have left behind. 

If we only had a guide on whom we could depend, matters 
would not be so bad." 

" I have one for you," said the doctor, joyfully. 

" Who ? Where is he ? " exclaimed Mr Linton, 

" Here, close at hand," he said. 

And hurrying on to where he had left the Malay guide in 
charge of a couple of soldiers, he found that he had arrived only 
just in time ; for feeling was very strong just then against every 
one wearing a dark skin, and the men were looking askant at 
one whom they believed likely to betray them at any moment. 

" A Malay ! " said Mr Linton, doubtfully. 

'* Yes, and a trusty one," said the doctor, decisively. "I will 
answer for his fidelity." 

" That is rather bold, doctor," said the major, who just then 
came up ; " but these are times when we must not be too par- 
ticular. Can he understand us ? " 

" I was the young chief Ali's servant, and I speak English," 
said the Malay, quietly. 




" That is no recommendation," said Captain Hortonj sharply. 
" That young chief deserted us, Hke the rest." 

" No," said the doctor ; " he was assassinated for taking our 
part ; and this man nearly shared his fate." 

This decided matters in favour of the Malay being retained 
as guide ; but there was still a difficulty, and that was, would 
the poor fellow, injured as he was, be able to undertake the 
duty? 

He said he could, however ; and as soon as he understood 
what was wanted, he went to the front, and the retreat was 
continued. 



CHAPTER LIX. 



LIKE BROTHERS IN DISTRESS. 

It was a strange country to struggle through, for roads hardly had 
any existence. The rivers were the highways, and upon the 
banks the villages or campongs of the Malays were invariably 
placed. There were a few narrow tracks, such as the one the 
retreating party hurried along, but all else was dense jungle, the 
untrodden home of wild beasts. So dense was it that there was 
fortunately nothing to fear from attack on either side. It must 
come from the front, or else from the rear. Neither friend nor 
foe could penetrate many yards through the wall of verdure that 
shut them in to right and left. To have tried to flank them 
without literally breaking a way through the canes and interlacing 
plants was impossible. 

On being asked how long it would take to march to the river 
and strike it high up, the Malay replied, three days of hard walk- 
ing ; and the hearts of his hearers sank as they thought of their 
position, with scarcely any provender, no covering against the 
night dews or heavy rains, and only the earth for their resting- 
place, while a virulent enemy was always on their track, striving 
hard to cut off all they could. 

There was no other course open, however, but to face it, for 
it would have been madness to have tried to fight their way 

through the hostile country ; and every one bent manfully to the 
task 

As they struggled on through the steamy bush the rear-guard 
was changed again and again, a fresh party of defenders taking 
up the task of keeping the pursuers at bay, and to each man in 
turn was the warning given that no shot must be fired unless it 
could be made to tell ; consequently the fire was less fierce, but, 
as the Malays found to their cost, more fatal 

The end of the third day was approaching, and the progress of 
the party had grown slower and slower, for their guide's strength 
had failed. The poor fellow had fought on bravely in spite of 





his wounds, insisting that he was well enough to walk, when all 
the time he was suffering intense agony ; and this was not to be 
without its result. 

During the day the Malays had attacked far more fiercely 
than usual, and though always repulsed, it had not been without 
loss. Several men had fallen, while others were wounded, in- 
creasing terribly the difficulties of the case, for the injured men 
had to be carried by those who found that their task of fighting 
their way through the jungle in the midst of the dense heat was 
already as much as they could bear. 

Still no one murmured. The pleasure-trip had turned out to 
be one of terrible misery, but each man, soldier or sailor, had a 
cheery word for his neighbour ; and whenever an unfortunate re- 
ceived a spear or bullet wound, the doctor was on the spot 
directly, tending him ; while a couple of his comrades deftly cut 
a few canes and bound them together, making a light litter, upon 
which the wounded man was placed, and carried on the shoulders 
of four men. 

The wounded made a terrible demand upon the sound ; and 
now, to add to their trouble, men began to fall out of the ranks 
stricken down by disease. 

It was no more than the doctor anticipated; but it was 

terrible work. 

Captain Horton was one of the first ¡ª after fighting bravely in 
the rear ¡ª to go to the doctor and complain of his head. 

"I can't get on, doctor," he said. "The giddiness is dread- 
ful, and the pain worse. Give me something to ease it all." 

The doctor said he would, and prescribed what he could from 
the little case he had with him, but he knew what was coming. 
Captain Horton had taken the jungle fever, and in an hour 
he was strapped down upon a litter, raving with delirium. 

Then ar.other, and another, went down, the officers falling one 
after another, till Major Sandars was left alone with the doctor, 
who had to divide his time between attending to his many 
patients and handling a rifle to help in their defence. 

The consequence was that on the third night, instead of being 
near the river, they were halted in the dense jungle, with their 
outposts on the alert, and the rest throwing themselves beside 
the sick and wounded, too much exhausted even to care for 

food. 

Major Sandars and the doctor stood talking together beneath 

the shade of a silk-cotton tree, whose leaves seemed to keep off a 

portion of the heavy falling dew, and the former was waiting for 

an answer from his companion, who, however, did not speak. 





" Come, say something, doctor," exclaimed the major; " what 
do you think of affairs ? " 

" What can I say ? " replied the doctor, sadly ; " we can go no 
farther." 

" But we must," exclaimed the major, impatiently. " The river 
must be reached, and a message sent down to the steamer." 

" There is only one way/' replied Doctor Bolter. 

" How is that ? " 

" Leave the sick and wounded behind, and push on. The poor 
fellows can carry them no farther." 

" Then we'll stop where we are," said the major, sharply, " for 
I won't leave a man behind" 

" Of course you will not I knew you would say so. Then all 
I can recommend is that we stay as we are for a few days, and 
try and recruit." 

" With bad water, and hardly any provisions," said the majoc 
**Ah, Bolter, this is a terribly bad business." 

" Yes," said the doctor, holding out his^'hand, which was 
eagerly grasped, " it is a terrible business- But you know what 
the foreigners say of us, Sandars ?" 

" No : what do you mean ? " 

" That the English never know when they are beaten. We 
don't know when we are beaten, and our lads are like us, God 
bless them, poor fellows, for they are as patient as can be ! " 

"What do you advise, then ?" said the major. "It is your 
duty to advise." 

" I did advise," said the doctor, laughing. " I proposed lop- 
ping off the bad limb of our little party, so as to leave the rest 
free to hobble on." 

"And suppose I had consented to it," said the major; "made 
the sick and wounded as comfortable as we could, and pushed 
on with the rest, what would you do ? " 

" Do ?" said Doctor Bolter ; " I don't understand you." 

** I mean, of course you would have to come with us ; for the 
Malays would butcher the poor fellows as soon as they came up," 

" Come with you, major? Are you mad? Why, who would 
tend the poor boys, and see to their bandages ? No, my dear 
Sandars. Your place is with the sound, mine is with the un- 
sound. Go on with your lot ¡ª poor fellows ¡ª and see if you can 
reach the river. You might perhaps send help in time to save 
us. If you didn't, why, I should have made them comfortable 
to the end, and done my duty." 

" My dear doctor ; " said Major Sandars, holding out his hand. 

" My dear major," said the doCor. " Good-bye, then ; and 
God bless you ! " 





**\VTiatl" cried the major, "And did you think I was 
going?" 

"Of course J ' 

" More shame for you, then, for thinking me such a cur. Leave 
you and these poor fellows here in the midst of the jungle, to be 
murdered by those cowardly pirates? Not I. Why, the men 
would mutiny if I proposed such a thing. No ; we'll wait a few 
hours, and then get on a few miles and rest again, the best way 
we can." 

" But you will only get the poor fellows killed if you stay," 
said the doctor." 

" Well, hadn*t we all better be killed like men doing our duty, 
than go off and live like cowards and curs ? '* 

" Of course you had," said the doctor, speaking huskily, 
" But I felt that it was my duty to leave you free." 

" Doctor," said the major, la5dng his hand upon the other's 
shoulder, " there's nothing like trouble for making a man know 
what a deal of good there is in human nature. You're a good 
fellow, doctor. Hang it, man, you've made me feel as soft as a 
girl I" 

He turned away his face, that staunch, brave soldier, for a few 
moments, and then the weakness was past, and he turned sharply 
round to the doctor. 

"Now," he said, "you shall see what stuff our soldiers and 
sailors are made of. Come here." 

He led the doctor back to the rear, where the guard, sun- 
blackened, haggard fellows, with their clothes hanging in rags 
from the thorns, were on the watch, and this being out of ear- 
shot of the sick and wounded, who were all ranged side by side 
beneath a couple of shady spreading trees, he gave the order 
for the men to fall in, when, with the precision that they would 
have shown upon a parade ground, the soldiers fell in making 
one line ; the sailors another in the rear. 

" Face inwards ! " cried the major, and he turned first to the 
sailors. " My lads," he said, "your officers being all down, the 
duty of commanding you has fallen upon me, and I thank you 
for the ready way in which you have obeyed my orders. You 
have been as willing and as trusty as my own boys here, and that 
is saying a great deal." 

There was a little shuffling of feet at this, and the men looked 
uncomfortable. 

" I am sorry to say," continued the major, " that matters have 
come to such a grievous pass with us, that I have to make a 
stitement, to which I want to hear your reply. I have no occa- 




sion to speak to you, for I know that you will to a man obey my 
orders to the last ; but I want to hear what you will say," 

There was a pause here, and then the major went on, 

" Matters have come to this, my lads, that I see you can 
stagger on no longer with the loads you have to bear. In fact, 
two more poor fellows are down, and it will take every fighting 
man to carry the others. So I have been talking the matter over 
with the doctor, and it has come to this, that our only chance 
is to leave the sick and wounded, and push on, make for the 
river, in the hope of getting help, and coming back to save them. 
What do you say ? " 

** Lord love you, sir," cried one of the sailors, " why, afore to- 
night them niggers would have sarved every one of our poor 
mates like the doctor, there, sarves the black beadles and but- 
terflies ¡ª stuck a pin or a kirs through 'em." 

It was a grim subject to jest upon, and it was a serious thing \ 
but there was a roar of laughter from the men, and the doctor 
chuckled till he had to hold his sides, and then wipe his eyes. 

"I hope not so bad as that," said the major, when he had 
called Attention I "It is, however, I fear our only hope. Will 
some man among you speak ? " 

There was a shuffling and a whispering at this, and every man 
nudged his neighbour to begin, but no one spoke till the sergeant 
felt that it was his duty, and going along the front of both ranks 
he had a few words with the soldiers and the jacks. After this 
he retook his place and saluted. 

" Men seem to be all of one opinion, sir," he said gruffly. 

"And what is that opinion?" inquired the major. 

"They say, sir, as I say, that they wouldn't like their mates 
to desert them in a time of trouble like this." 

" That's right sergeant," shouted a sailor, 

" Yes, that's a true word," shouted another. 

"Attention, there ! " cried the major, sharply. " do on, sergeant" 

" And if so be as our officer don't order us different, we'll all 
stick to one another, sick and sound, to the end." 

" Hear, hear ; hurray ! " cried the men, as with one voice. 

" Do I understand, my lads, that you will stand by the sick 
and wounded to the last ? " 

" Yes, sir, all on us 1 " shouted the men in chorus. 

"Yes, sir," cried the joking sailor, "and we'll all carry one 
another till there's only one left as can carry ; and he'll have a 
jolly hard time of it, thafs alL" 

The stem discipline was for a moment forgotten, and a heaity 
roar of laughter followed this sally. 





''Attention 1" cried the major after a few moments, and he 
spoke as if he was deeply moved. '* It is only what I ex- 
pected from my brave lads ; and I may tell you now that this is 
what Doctor Bolter and I had determined to do ¡ª stand to- 
gether to the last." 

" Only we won't have any last, my lads," cried the doctor. 

" I hope not," said the major. ** We'll go on more slowly and 
take longer rests, for I must have no more of you men down with 
sickness. Let us hope that we may win our way safely to the 
ship and the island yet. I would send out a little party to try 
and fetch help, but I fear they are beset at the residency already, 
and I do not think a detachment could succeed I propose then 
that we all hold together and do our best." 

" That we will, sir," cried the men, and a voice proposed 
three cheers for the major. 

These were hardly given before he held up his hand, and in 
a few words thanked them, while the doctor was called away, 

"And now, my lads, we will go forward once more, and do 
the best we can. If we can only get a mile a day it is something, 
and every man will lend a hand. We will march at once. Yes, 
doctor ? More bad news ? " 

" Yes," said Doctor Bolter, bluntly; "our guide has broken 
down. 

" Broken down/' 

" Yes, he is quite delirious." 

"And," muttered the major, "we are worse than helpless 
without a guide." 



CHAPTER LX. 



SIGNALS OF DISTRESS. 

The night passed on board the steamer without any alarm, and 
at daybreak steam was up, and with the men at their quarters 
and every gun loaded, they set off on their return journey. 

As the lieutenant said, it was no use to murmur about their 
misfortune ; all they could do was to try and make the best of 
matters by getting back as soon as possible. 

He could gladly have gone on at full speed, but caution forbad 
it. There were mudbanks and turns innumerable ; and even 
going slowly, the length of the vessel was so great that again and 
again they were nearly aground upon some shoal, or brushed the 
overhanging trees with their bows. 

Of one thing the lieutenant felt certain ¡ª that they had not 
been led into this narrow river without some plans being made 
for keeping them there. Therefore every man was on the alert 
for an ambush, or something that should stop their further pro- 
gress towards the mouth of the sluggish stream. 

It was terribly slow work, and Lieutenant Johnson stamped 
with patience as he saw how poorly they progressed, speaking 
snappishly to Bob Roberts when the latter ventured upon some 
observation. 

This went on three or four times, when, feeling hurt by a 
sharp remark on the lieutenant's part, Bob exclaimed, ¡ª 

" You needn't be so hard upon me, captain ; it was not my fault. " 

Lieutenant Johnson turned upon him angrily, and was about 
to say something severe, but Bob's injured look disarmed him, 
and he held out his hand. 

" I'm hipped, Roberts," he said, and hardly know what I say. 
" Steady, there ; steady !" 

This to the man at the wheel as they were rounding a point ; 
but the order had a contrary effect to what was intended ; it 

flurried and unsteadied the sailor, who took a pull too much at 
the spokes, and before anything could be done to check the 




steamer's speed, her sharp bows had cut deeply into the muddy 
bank of the river, and she was aground. 

" Was anything ever so unlucky?," cried the lieutenant ; and 
then he gave order after order. Guns were swung round so as 
to sweep the bows should the Malays try to board them from 
the shore ; the engines were reversed ; the men tramped from 
side to side of the deck ; everything possible was done : but the 
steamer remained fixed in the mud without a possibility 
apparently of getting her oif. 

The jungle was of the densest all around, and the men 
approached the bows with caution, for the head of the steamer 
was right in amidst dense foliage, and it was quite probable that 
any number of the enemy might be concealed and ready to hurl 
spears at the slightest chance. 

Neither seeing nor hearing signs of the enemy, the lieutenant 
at last ordered Roberts to try and land and see if the Malays 
were near. " It's a risky job, Roberts," he said kindly, " but 
you must take it I cannot leave the steamer." 

" Oh, I'll take it," said Bob, coolly, and examining his revolver, 
he drew his sword, and telling the men to follow, ran forward, 
scrambled over the bows, and leaped ashore, the men imitating 
his example, for the bank was only some six or eight feet below 
the bulwarks. 

But though they were landed there was little more to be done, 
unless they had been provided with billhooks to clear the way. 
The undergrowth was nearly as dense as a hedge, and after trying 
in half-a-dozen different ways, and only penetrating some twenty 
or thirty yards, they were obliged to give up, drenched with 
perspiration, their flesh full of thorns. 

" IVe got something bitting my legs horribly," cried Bob, 
turning up his trousers, and then giving a shudder of disgust, 
for half-a-dozen leeches were busy at work making a meal upon 
him, and several of the sailors were in the same predicament. 

"There, my lads, we may as well get on board," said Bob, 
grimly, " I don't like shedding my blood in the service of my 
country after this fashion. We can do nothing here, and it 
would puzzle a cat ¡ª let alone a Malay ¡ª to get through." 

So they returned on board, satisfied that there was no fear of 
an attack from that quarter, and the rest of the day was devoted 
to trying to get the steamer out of her unpleasant predicament. 

Night fell with the men utterly wearied out, and, in despair, 
Lieutenant Johnson was taking himself to task for his bad 
management, as he termed it, when Bob Roberts suddenly 
seized him by the arm. 




"What is it, Roberts?" 

" A shot off yonder in the jungle," he exclaimed; 

" I did not hear it," was the reply 3 and they stood listening ; 
but there was nothing but the hum of insects and the distant 
splash of some reptile in the muddy river. 

" If we could have only heard some news of those poor 
fellows, I would not have cared," said the lieutenant after a 
pause. " Perhaps at this time they are anxiously hoping that 
help may come, and wondering why we have not sent in search 
of them ; while we, with men and guns, are lying here helpless 
as a log. Oh, Roberts, it's enough to make a man jump over- 
board and ¡ª " 

" There it is again,*' cried Bob. 

"What?" 

** A shot !" he cried excitedly. " I'm sure I heard a rifle-shot" 

" Any of you men hear a shot ? " said the lieutenant to the watch, 

" No, sir ; no, sir." 

"I heard nothing, Roberts," said the lieutenant. "You are 
excited with exertion. Go below and have a glass of sherry, my 
lad, and put in a dose of quinine. I can't afford to have you 
down with fever." 

'*No, thanky," said Bob; "I could manage the glass of wine, 
but I'm not going to spoil it with the quinine, I'm ¡ª There now, 
what's that ? If that isn't a rifle-shot I'm no man." 

"Then it isn't a rifle-shot," said the lieutenant, grimly, "I 
heard nothing." 

" Beg pardon, sir, I think it was a shot" 

" There's another ! " cried Bob, excitedly, " It's our fellows 
somewhere." 

There were a couple of distant shots, faintly heard now by alL 

" You're right, Roberts," said the lieutenant, hastily; " but it is 
not obliged to be our fellows." 

" They couldn't have followed up from the island, sir," cried 
Bob ; "so it must be." 

" Unless it is a party of Malays shooting." 

"Then they are shooting our men,'* cried Bob, "They 
wouldn't be hunting when its getting dark." 

" There's another shot," said the lieutenant, now growing as 
excited as his companion. " What shall we do ? " 

" Fire a big gun," said Bob. 

" That would be letting our enemies know where we are," said 
he lieutenant. 

"Well," said Bob, sturdily, "let 'em know. It will show 'em 
that we are not afraid of them." 





"Yon are right, Roberts," said lieutenant Johnson, quickly. 
" Unshot the bow gun there." 

The gun was opened ; the shot cartridge drawn out, a blank 
one substituted ; and directly after, the black darkness that had 
seemed to settle down over them was cut by a vivid flash, and 
the utter silence that was brooding over the river was broken by 
the deep-mouthed roar of the great breech-loading cannon. 

The report seemed to roll off into the distance and echo 
amongst the mountains; and then, as it died away, they all 
listened with strained senses for some reply. 

It came, just as they expected ¡ª three rifle-shots in succession. 
Then a pause, and three more rifle-shots. 

There was a pause then, and the silence seemed awful, for the 
report of the great gun had driven every living thing near at hand 
to its lair. 

"Three marines," said the lieutenant, sharply, "fire as I give 
the order. One ¡ª two ¡ª three ! " 

The three shots rang out at stated intervals, and the men re- 
loaded and fired as before. 

Then they waited again, and the signal was answered in a 
peculiar way that left no doubt whatever in the minds of those 
on board, and a murmur of satisfaction ran through the little 
crew. 

And now, for the first time, Lieutenant Johnson began to 
wonder whether he had doubted the Malay guide without cause. 
He might have been swept overboard after all, and the hunting- 
party be really hemmed in at some stockade. 

A few moments' consideration, however, showed that this 
could not be the case, for they had journeyed back many miles 
before the steamer ran aground; and though the river winded a 

great deal, it was impossible that the stockade could have 
been higher up. The firing certainly came from quite another 
direction, away from the river ; and shots that were evidently 
not signals were now heard again ¡ª one or two, then three or four 
together, as if men were skirmishing, and then came several 
volleys. 

There was a fight going on, that was evident ; and as the two 
officers realised this, they felt half maddened at their helpless- 
ness. 

They wanted to go to the aid of those who were fighting, but 
it would have been utter madner.r, to have attempted to land 
with a detachment in the dark and try to hack a way through 
the jungle. They might have fired signals and had them re- 
sponded to, but it would have been a helpless, bewildering piece 





of folly ; and with pulses beating rapidly with excitement, and 
every nerve on the stretch, they felt themselves bound to a state 
of inaction, still they felt that they could fire signals to guide 
those who might, perhaps, get nearer, or, if shut in some place, 
fight the better for knowing that help was so near. 

They did all they could, sending up a rocket firora time to 
time, and twice, at intervals of about an hour, firing a big gun, 
each signal eliciting a reply from the distance ; and then, at 
intervals often minutes, a rifle was fired, while, when six, seven, 
and eight bells were sounded, the same number of rifle-shots 
were heard. 

It was a night of general watching on board the steamer, no 
man seeking shelter, though about seven bells the rain began 
to pour down with all the violence of a storm in the tropics, 
accompanied by thunder and lightning of the heaviest and 
most vivid description. 

For about four hours this kept on, guns being fired in the 
intervals, when the thunder ceased for a few moments j but no 
'inswering shots had been heard for some time. 

One thing was very evident ¡ª the party engaged were 
entrenched somewhere, and defending themselves, for their 
answering shots had been no nearer ; in fact, all felt that 
travelling through the dense jungle was impossible until daylight 
set in. 

The night was about half gone when the storm ceased as 

suddenly as it had come on; the clouds were dispersed, and 
the moon shone out clearly, showing them that the sluggish 
river was sluggish no longer, but running fast, and threatening 
to fill up to the top of its high banks, the water coming down 
evidently from the mountains. 

This revived the hopes of all on board, and not without reason, 
for the steamer was gradually shifting her position ] and hardly 
had a boat been lowered, and a hawser made fast to one of the 
big trees ashore, before she lifted more and more; and in 
a few moments more, to the delight of all, they felt the 
branches sweeping the rigging, and the steamer moving free 
and clear. 

The men, forgetting discipline, and the need perhaps for 
silence, gave an involuntary cheer ; which ceased on the instant 

as, from somewhere lower down the stream, there came a 
faint, " Ship ahoy I '' 

" Ahoy !" was answered. 

And after a brief colloquy a boat was lowered down, with 
nalf-a-dozen marines as well as the crew, Bob Roberts taking 




command, and cautiously steering her towards where the man 
who hailed seemed to be. 

The boat was allowed to descend the stream stem foremost, 
the men dipping their oars occasionally to keep her head right, 
and to prevent her being swept down too swiftly. 

The next minute, at the word, they gave away, and the cutter 
was run in beneath the branches to where one of the crew stood 
in tl>e moonlight, with a soldier by his side, 

" Why, it's Parker I " cried Bob, catching the man's hand. 

" Parker it is, Mr Roberts, sir," said the man faintly. " I 
thought we should never have done it, what with the storm and 
the thick cane. We've about cut our way here." 

"And the captain and Major Sandars?" cried Bob. 

"'Bout a mile away, sir, through the jungle, wanting help 
badly." 

"Can we get there to-night?*' cried Bob. "But jump in 
my lads, and we'll hear what the lieutenant says. Come : why 
don't you jump in ?" 

" I'm bet out, sir, and my mate too," said the sailor. " We're 
a bit wounded, sir. We volunteered to come for help when we 
first heerd the dear old * Startler ' speak out, but it's been a long 
job. Will you help us aboard, mates?'' 

Half-a-dozen willing hands soon had the two poor, drenched, 
wounded, and exhausted men on board the cutter, and five 
minutes after they w^ere on the deck being questioned by the 
lieutenant. 

" I told the captain, sir, as I'd ask you to fire two guns if we 
got here safe. He's down with fever, sir, and it would cheer 
him up if he heard the old gal say ¡ª begging your pardon ¡ª as 
she was close at hand." 

The word was given, and a couple of heavy roars from the 
" old gal," as the sailor affectionately called his ship, bore the 
news to the captain ; and then, in answer to the lieutenant, 
both of the messengers declared that it would be impossible to 
get to the helpless party that night. 

" I wouldn't say so, sir, if I didn't feel," said Parker, " that 
the lads would only go losing theirselves in the wet jungle, and 
do no good. If you'd start at daybreak, sir, and take plenty of 
rum and biscuits, as well as powder and shot, you might get 
them aboard." 

Then by slow degrees those on board learned from the worn- 
out messengers the whole of their experience, and how that 
since Major Sandars had appealed to the men, and they had 
sworn to stick together to the last, they had only made journeys 


of about a mile in length through the dense jungle. The guide 
was still delirious, and half the men down with sickness or 
wounds. Food they had had of the most meagre description, 
and that principally the birds they had shot Their ammunition 
was fast failing, and the time seemed to have come that evening 
to lie down and die, so weak were they, and so pertinacious were 
the attacks of the enemy ¡ª when a thrHl of joy ran through every 
breast as they heard the signal shots, and knew that there was 
help zX hand. 



CHAPTER LXL 



HOW BOB ROBERTS TURNED THE TABLES. 

Never was daylight looked for with greater anxiety than that 
night on board the steamer. 

With the first flush she was allowed to float lower down, till 
abreast of the spot where the two men were taken on board, 
and then every available hand was landed, under Bob Roberts' 
command, to try, by firing signals and listening for the reply, to 
reach the place where the worn-out party were making their 
last stand. 

The two poor fellows who had come on board were in too 
pitiable a plight to move, and, even if they had gone, they could 
not have guided the relief party, who, only twenty strong, leaped 
ashore, eager to reach their friends, and inflict some punishment 
on the Malays, while the others retreated towards the ship. 

Every man was laden heavily with food and amunition, 
Lieutenant Johnson's difficulty being to keep the brave fellows 
from taking too much, and hindering their fighting powers, as, 
with a hearty cheer, they plunged in amidst the interlacing canes. 

The task was hard, but less so than they expected ¡ª resolving 
itself as it did into hacking the canes and forcing their way 
through ; for before they had gone far they could hear firing 
before them, and it was kept up so vigorously that there was no 
occasion to fire a single signal. 

Hour after hour did they toil on, till the firing suddenly 
ceased, and they were for a moment at fault ; but Bob Roberts 
and Old Dick, who were leading, suddenly heard vorces close at 
hand, where the forest growth was thinner ; and hacking and 
chopping away, they had nearly reached the spot when the firing 
suddenly began again furiously for a few moments, and then once 
more stopped 

The next minute the way was clear, and Bob Roberts, with his 
twenty blue-jackets and marines, went in at the double to an 
opening in the jungle where the remains of the hunting party 





were making a desperate stand against a strong body of Malays, 
who, spear against bayonet, were pressing them home. 

The middy took it all in at a glance, and saw that in another 
minute the weak helpless wielders of rifle and bayonet would be 
borne down, and they, and the sick and wounded lying in the 
long grass, massacred to a man. 

Major Sandars said afterwards that the oldest colonel in the 
service could not have done better; for, with his sun-browned 
face lighting up with excitement, and waving his sword, Bob 
Roberts shouted his orders to the men, sprang forward, giving 
point at a great bronze-skinned Malay who had borne the major 
down and was about to spear him, while with a hearty British 
cheer the marines and blue-jackets dashed up, poured in a 
staggering volley amongst the thronging enemy, and followed it 
up with a bayonet charge along the beaten-down jungle alley, till, 
dropping spear and kris, the Malays fled for their lives. 

Others were hurrying up to be present at the massacre ; for the 
news had spread that the English had fired their last cartridge 
and were weak with starvation ; but as they met their flying com- 
rades the panic spread. The reinforcements were magnified a 
hundred times ; and it wanted but Bob Roberts' quick sharp 
halt, form in line two deep, and the firing in of a couple of 
volleys, to send all to the right about, a few of the hindmost get- 
ting a prick of the bayonet before they got away. 

Pursuit would have been vain, so Bob left a picket of ^vq 
men under Old Dick to keep the narrow path, bidding them fell 
a tree or two so that their branches might lie towards and 
hinder an attack from the enemy, before hurrying back with 
fourteen men to the little jungle camp. 

He tried hard, but he could not keep back his tears as the 
gaunt bleeding remains of a fine body of men gathered round 
him to grasp his hands and bless him ; while, when one strange- 
looking little naked object came up and seized him by the 
shoulders, he felt almost ready to laugh. 

It was hard to believe it was Dr Bolter standing there, in a 
pair of ragged trousers reduced in length to knee breeches, and 
nothing else. 

'* Bob, my dear boy," he said, " I can*t tell you how glad I 
am ; but give me some rum, biscuits, anything you have, for my 
poor lads are perishing for want of food." 

The men's wallets were being emptied, and food and ammu- 
nition were rapidly distributed, for not a scrap of provision nor 
a single cartridge was left with the major's party. 

" Why, you are laughing at me, you dog," cried the doctor, as 
he came back for more provisions; "but just you have forty 




patients, Bob Roberts, many of them wounded, and not a ban- 
dage to use, Bob, my lad ! My handkerchiefs, neck and pocket, 
went first ; then my Norfolk jacket, and then my shirt. Poor 
lads ! poor brave lads 1" he said piteously; **rd have taken off 
my skin if it would have done them good." 

" Ah, doctor," said Bob, in a voice full of remorse, *' I'm only a 
boy yet, and a very thoughtless one. Pray forgive me. I meant 
no harm." 

"God bless you, my lad; I know that," cried the doctor, 
warmly, "You've saved us alL Boy, indeed? Well, so you 
are, Bob; but as long as England has plenty of such boys as you, 
we need not trouble ourselves about the men ¡ª they'll all come in 
time." 

It was a pitiful task, but every one worked with a will ; and 
now that they were refreshed with food, reanimated by the pre- 
sence of twenty fresh men, supplied with amunition, and, above 
all, supported by the knowledge that not a mile away, through 
the newly-cut path, there lay a haven of rest in the shape of the 
steamer ¡ª men who had been fit to Hq down and die, stood 
up, flushed, excited, and ready to help bear the sick and wounded 
towards the river ; while, to make matters better, the Malays had 
had such a thrashing in this last engagement that they made no 
fresh attack. The consequence was that half-a-dozen weak men 
under Major Sandars made a show in the rear, and all the strong 
devoted themselves to helping to carry the invalids to the steamer. 

More help was afforded too from the steamer itself as soon 
as Lieutenant Johnson found that there was no fear of attack, 
and in the end all were got safely on board ; and long before 
night Dr Bolter, clothed and comfortable, had all his sick men 
in berths and hammocks, well tended, already looking better, and 
he himself walking up and down the deck chuckling and rub- 
bing his hands. 

The losses had been severe, but far less than might have been 
expected, owing to the devotion of the men, who had struggled 
on till they could get no farther, and would have perished one 
and all but for the timely succour brought by the middy, and 
indirectly by the emissary of Rajah Gantang, who little thought 
when he took the steamer, by his clever ruse, up the solitary 
river, that he was leading them where it would be the salvation 
of the hunting party who were doomed to death. 

Not a moment liad been lost, and as soon as all were on 
board, the steamer recommenced her downward course towards 
the residency, where all felt that help must be urgently needed 
bv the little parly wJio had its defence. 



CHAPTER LXII. 



CAPTAIN SMITHERS PROVES A TRUE OFFICER, AND 

PRIVATE GRAY A GENTLEMAN. 

In truth help was urgently needed at the little fort ; but had its 
defenders been compelled to wait for that which the steamer 
would afford, every one would have been either butchered or 
taken off into a terrible captivity. 

Captain Smithers when he looked round had seen the enemy 
coming on in such strength ; and with a demonstration so full of 
clever plan, backed up by determination, that he could not help 
feeling that the critical moment had come, and that they must 
either surrender or meet death like men. 

If he surrendered, the probabilities were that they would all be 
massacred, save the women ; and as he thought of them he raised 
his eyes, and found those of Private Gray fixed upon him, as if 
reading his very souL 

" You know what I was thinking, Gray," he said, resentfully. 

" Yes, sir," said Gray, sharply ; " you were debating within 
yourself whether you should strike the Union Jack in token of 
surrender." 

" I was," said Captain Smithers, angry with himself at being as 
it were obliged to speak as he did to this simple private of his 
regiment. " And you advise it ? " 

" Advise it, sir ? For heaven's sake ¡ª for the sake of the ladies 
whom we have to defend, let us fight till the last gasp, and then 
send a few shots into the magazine. Better death than the 
mercy of a set of cut-throat pirates." 

Captain Smithers was silent for a few moments, and then he 
said quietly, ¡ª 

" I should not have surrendered, Gray. You are quite right.** 

He hesitated for a moment or two, and then said hoarsely, ¡ª 

" Gray, we hate each other." 

" This is no time for hatred, sir," said Gray, sternly. 

" No," said Captain Smithers, *' it is not. In half an hour we 



shall be, in all human probability, dead men. Rank will be no 
more. Gray, I never in my heart doubted your honesty. You 
are a brave man. Now for duty." 

" Yes, sir," said Gray, in a deeply moved voice ¡ª " for duty." 

Crash ! 

There was a sharp ragged volley from the enemy at that 
moment as a body of them advanced, and a shriek of agony from 
close by, followed by a fall. 

" Some poor fellow down," said the Captain, hoarsely. " Who 
is it. Sergeant Lund?" he said, taking a dozen strides in the 
direction of the cry. 

'* Private Sim, sir. Shot through the heart ¡ª dead ! " 

The captain turned away, and the next minute the fight on all 
sides was general, the enemy winning their way nearer and nearer, 
and a couple of prahus sending a shower of ragged bullets from 
their brass lelahs over the attacking party's heads. 

" Stand firm, my lads ; stand firm. Your bayonets, boys I " 
cried Captain Smithers, as with a desperate rush the Malays 
dashed forward now to carry the place by assault, and in suffi- 
cient numbers to sweep all before them ¡ª when boom I boom ! 
boom I boom I came the reports of heavy guns, and the fire from 
the prahus ceased. 

"Hurrah! my lads; steady!" cried Tom Long, waving his 
sword. " The steamer ! the steamer ! " 

"No," cried Captain Smithers, "it is from below. It is a 
heavily-armed prahu." 

" No," cried Tom Long ; "a steamer ! a steamer ! " 

He was right, for a little gunboat was rapidly ascendmg the 
river, and one of the prahus began to settle down in front of the 
fort, while the other used her sweeps to get away. 

Another minute, and just when they had won an entrance, 
beating back the defenders of the barricaded gateways, a panic 
seized upon the Malays, for shell after shell was dropping and 
bursting in their midst; and before Captain Smithers and his 
brave little party could realise the fact, the enemy was in full 

retreat 

A quarter of an hour later, and the gunboat was moored abreast 
of the fort, and congratulations were being exchanged. 

He had said nothing, not daring to hope for success ; but AH 
had, as soon as he could, sent a fisherman in his boat to try and 
convey word of the danger to the Bindings. The message had 
been faithfully borne, and the little gunboat sent to help to keep 
the enemy at bay, till the steamer could come from Penang with 
.1 detachment of infantry on board. 




The heavy guns were too much for the Malays ; and just as it 
had been decided that the gunboat should ascend the river in 
quest of the " Startler," the latter came slowly down the river 
with her rescued freight. 

In a couple more days the Penang steamer had arrived with a 
battalion of foot, under Colonel Hanson ; and the next thing 
heard was that the Sultan Hamet, with Rajah Gantang, had fled 
up the country, the minor chiefs sending in their submission to 
the British and suing for peace. 

Doctor Bolter became almost the greatest man at the station 
after this, and he went about laughing as he kept ¡ª to use his own 
w^ords ¡ª " setting men up," speaking of them as if they were 
natural history specimens. First he had to be thanked by Rachel 
Linton for saving her father's life ; then he found Captain 
Horton blessing him for his recovery ; and one way and another 
he had a very proud time of it, though, to his great regret, he had 
no chance of pursuing his favourite hobby. 

The Malay who acted as his guide was recovering fast from the 
tiger's clawing, and had attached himself to the doctor as servant 
when matters settled down ; and it was affecting to see the poor 
fellow's delight upon encountering Ali alive and well. 

Matters were soon arranged, and a busy party were at work 
rebuilding the residency, a number of Chinese joiners being 
enlisted for the task. 

Meanwhile the fort and barracks had to be the general dwelling; 

and Bob Roberts and Tom Long were looked upon as heroes. 

It so happened, that one day Colonel Hanson entered the 
mess-room, where Captain Horton, Major Sandars, Captain 
Smithers, and the other officers, were grouped about. Mr Linton 
and the ladies were present ; and on one side stood a group of 
soldiers, foremost among whom were Sergeant Lund and Private 
Gray. 

Alajor Sandars advanced to meet the governor's messenger, 
and he was about to make some remark, when Colonel Hanson 
turned round, caught sight of Private Gray, and started with 
astonishment 

The next moment he had gone forward to where Gray stood, 
looking very stern and troubled, and caught him by the hands, 
dragging him forward, and evidently forgetting all the stiff 
etiquette of the army. 

" Why, my dear old Frank," he cried, shaking his hands, and 
seeming as if he could hug him, " this is a surprise ! this is a 
meeting ! Why, where have you been ? Soldiering too, and 
wearing the scarlet ! My dear old Frank," he cried again, with 



his voice shaking with emotion, " I feel as weak as a child ; 
upon my word T do." 

" Colonel Hanson/' said Gray, quietly, but evidently very 
much moved, as he saw that they were the centre of every gaze, 
" this is indeed a strange meeting. I little thought it was you. 
But you forget ; we belong to different circles now." 

"Forget? Different circles ? Do we indeed?" cried Colonel 
Hanson, whose face was flushed with excitement. "I forget 
nothing. Come here," he cried, and dragging Gray's arm 
through his, he faced round to where the astonished officers and 
the resident were standing. 

" Major Sandars, Mr Linton, gentlemen, this is my very dear 
old friend, Francis Murray. We were schoolfellows together 
at Eton, and ¡ª and ¡ª and ¡ª I can't tell you now all the good 
brave things he has done for me. For years he has been miss- 
ing ; that wretched Overend and Gurney smash broke him, and 
he disappeared. And, Frank, you foolish fellow, I have been 
searching for you high and low to tell you that that cantan- 
kerous old lady, your aunt, was dead, and had changed her mind 
at the last moment, quarrelled with that lot who had got hold 
of her, sent for her solicitor, and left Greylands and every farthing 
she had to you. Thank goodness I have found you at last 
Now sign 5^ur application to buy out at once. I will forward 
it home, and take upon myself to consider it accepted, pending 
the official discharge." 

While this was going on, Captain Smithers, whose heart 
felt like lead, had gazed from one to the other. Now his eyes 
were fixed with bitter jealousy upon Private Gray, and now upon 
Rachel Linton, though she saw him not, but, pale and flushed 
by turns, she was gazing at Gray, 

He was a true gentleman at heart, and in spite of his 
misery and disappointment, that which he had just heard gave 
him some satisfaction. It had been one of his bitterest griefs ¡ª 
one with a poisoned sting ¡ª that feeling which always haunted 
him, that Rachel Linton should prefer a private soldier to him, 
an officer and a gentleman. For that she did love Gray he had 
long felt certain. Gray, or Murray, then, was a gentleman, who, 
like many other gentlemen, had enlisted, and served as a very 
brave soldier. Yes, he was, Captain Smithers owned to him- 
self, a very brave soldier, though he had felt that he hated 

him ; while now ¡ª now ¡ª 

" 1*11 fight it down," said Captain Smithers to himself. 
" Heaven helping me, 1*11 be a gentleman as well as an officer. 
He has won, and I have lost. I ought to like him for her sake, 
and I will." 





It was a brave effort, and it required all his strength ¡ª but 
he did it. He looked first at Rachel Linton, and then at the 
sweet sympathizing face of her cousin, and went up close to them. 

" Rachel," he said, holding out his hand and speaking in a 
low voice only heard by her and Miss Sinclair, "I give up. 
Let me be a dear friend, if I can be nothing more." 

Miss Linton held out her hand frankly and cordially, and 
he held it a moment in his. Then dropping it, he walked straight 
across to where Colonel Hanson was standing with Murray 
in the midst of a group, and holding out his hand, he said, ¡ª 

" Mr Murray, I am your debtor for my life. Henceforth let 
us, too, be very dear friends." 

The two young men clasped hands in a firm strong grip, each 
reading the other's thoughts, and they instinctively knew that 
henceforth all enmity between them was at end. It was all 
Frank Murray could do to stand firm, for he knew how great an 
effort this must have cost his rival, and he mentally vowed to 
repay him all. 

"Well," said Major Sandars, laughing, "this is a surprise 

indeed. Gentlemen all, Private Gray was so good and true a 

man in the private's mess, that I for one am quite sure he will be 

a welcome addition to ours." 

" Mr. Murray will grant that I have always looked upon him 

with respect," said Mr Linton, cordially. " I owe him too deep 
a debt," he said, holding out his hand, " not to feel intensely 

gratified at this change in his position." 

The other officers warmly shook hands, Tom Long amongst 
the number ; while, when it came to Bob Roberts' turn, he said 
with his eyes sparkling, ¡ª 

" I say, Mr Murray, I am glad, 'pon my word." 

Bob Roberts and Tom Long strolled out together on to the 
parade ground, crossing it to get under the trees where a group 
of soldiers and Jacks were standing. 

" I say, Tom Long, this is a rum game, isn't it ? " said Bob. 

'* I call it beastly," said Tom. " Well, there's one consolation, 
young fellow, your nose is out of joint in a certain quarter," 

" No," said Bob, it's yours. I've long enough given up my 
pretentions. Miss Linton and I are the best of friends ; but I'm 

sorry for you." 

*' Bother !" said Tom Long. "I wish I hadn't been such a 
fool. Why, whatever are they talking about ? " 

" I always knew he was a gentleman,'' said Sergeant Lund, 
authoritatively. " The way he could write out a despatch was 
something wonderful, that it was. Ha 1 I'm sorry he's gone I " 



"Tell you what," said old Dick, "its about my turn now 
What would some of you say if I was to turn out to be a mys- 
terious orphan, and be a skipper or an admiral ? " 

"That's quite right, my lads," said Bob Roberts, sharply. 
"Old Dick is a mysterious orphan, and if you open his shirt 
you'll find he's marked with a blue mermaid." 

" That's a true word," said old Dick, grinning. " But, Master 
Roberts, sir, don't you think you might pass your word for us to 
say a half dollar down there at the canteen ? What's just took 
place has been hard on our emotions, sir, and the consequence 
is as we are all werry dry." 

" I think you're more likely to turn out a fish, Dick ¡ª a shark, 
than anything else," said Bob. "But I don't mind. Will you 
be half. Tom ? " 

Tom Long nodded ; and the men went off laughing to the 
canteen, to drink the health of Frank Murray, late Private Gray, 
and ended by saying, through their mouthpiece, Dick, that, ¡ª 
"This here is a werry strange world." 



CHAPTER LXIIL 



THE LAST OF IT, 

There is not much more to say about the various people who 
formed the little world at the jungle station. 

Despatches were sent home, in which Major Sandars and 
Captain Horton dwelt most strongly upon the bravery of the 
young officers serving respectively beneath them. Captain 
Horton said so much respecting Bob Roberts, that poor Bob 
said he felt as red as a tomato ; while Tom Long, instead of be- 
coming what old Dick called more " stuck-upper " on reading of 
his bravery, seemed humbled and more frank and natural. 
Certainly he became better liked ; and at a dinner that was given 
after the country had settled, and Colonel Hanson and his force 
were about to return, that officer in a speech said that from what 
he had heard, Mr Midshipman Roberts and Mr Ensign Long 

would become ornaments of the services to which they be- 
longed. 

And so they did, and the truest of friends, when they did not 
quarrel, though really their squabbles only cemented their friend- 
ship the stronger. 

They both visited Mr and Mrs Frank Murray at their pretty 
bungalow at Perang, where Rachel was settled down so long as 
her father retained his post at the residency ; but their most en- 
joyable visits were, as years went by, to their friend the sultan, 
who was fast improving the country, and encouraging his people 
to become more commercial, in place of the arrant pirates they 
had been. For in a very short time in the settlement of the 
country under British protection, the rank of sultan had been 
offered to the Tumongong, who refused it in favour of his son 
All, and this was ratified by the Governor of the Straits ¡ª Sultan 
Hamet dying a victim to excess, and the piratical Rajah Gantang 
of his wounds. 

Which was, so said old Dick in confidence to the two young 
officers, "a blessing to ever^^body consamed, for that there Rajah 



Gantang was about the wussest nigger as ever suffered from the 

want of soap." 

The last the writer heard of Dick was, that he was the oldest 

boatswain in the service, and that he was on board that rapid 
gunboat the " Peregrine," commanded by Lieutenant Robert 
Roberts, R.N. 

It need only be added that Captain Smithers got over his dis- 
appointment, and cwo years later married Mary Sinclair, who 
makes him an excellent wife. So that none of those concerned 
had cause to regret the trip up the Malay river in H.M.S. 
^* Startler." 


introduction more than with anything else in the world children are delighted with pictures and picture books pictures are childhoods happiest teachers illustrations are the windows through which the souls of children look at truth at beauty and at life and the apter the illustration the more lasting the lesson which is sure to follow when a book or story is embellished it becomes a friend and a book without pictures is like a flower without sunlight the imagination is quickened by the use of proper pictures and the wee little ones see actually what is on the page in store for them there is the droll story of the fox the turkey and the fence the dancing crocodile and farther on we find the eiirtle pig that got the better of the wolf while dame fidget introduces us to old friends in new facesjack and jill tom thumb and others and as we turn the pages the comical tale of the humane man and the bull calf attracts and merits our attention children understand these things better than we can write them and remember by means of pictures what they would otherwise forget paint a scene and it tells its own story or else the picture becomes a sweet question which nothing but the reading of the narrative can ever fully answer and the bock has a new interest when we have learned the experimental secrets of magic at home or laughed over the adventure of a brummagem bear and a kangaroo we have tried to make queerie queers a book which a child will treasure up and often read a help to the mother and a blessing to every household a charming teacher of merry graceful and delight¬ ful things and a power to brighten every home it enters and we hope not only to please the eye with pictures but to do that which is far better to put within the reach of the little ones an influence for good all powerful because beautiful and beautiful because of the lifegiving truth within it queerie queers is a book filled with the choicest things and parents may feel safe in giving it to their children it is not a mere picture book for the reading will be found even better and more delightful than the pictures to all girls and boys we offer our winsome work for little children in the hope that they will derive from it as much real pleasure as we have had in preparing it for their enjoyment to be a gobblers far from well if a fox turn gobbler too and while you roost without a fear should come and gobble you but to a turkey proud this fate once on a time occurred madam fox managed in her basket snug to jam the bird not that he was so very large the basket was too small and so his feet not number ones couldnt go in at all madam fox was a widow lone and she had brought her son that he might learn by watching her just how the thing was done very painful indeed it is the secret to reveal but madam fox was trying hard to teach her son to steal and sadder still her teaching stuck to him like bricks to mortar and he to stealing turkeys took as young ducks take to water t

madam fox because she had the fence to clear she had to climb that fourrail fence as quickly as could be so by the time she made a start oh quite a start had hel the pace was swift the turkeys legs were stretched from head to tail and mrs fox kept up pursuit oer field and hill and dale nearer home the turkey came while the anxious moments flew but hungry angry mrs fox was nearer nearer too it seemed at last as if for sure this run for home would fail for mother fox had got so her jaws had seized close his tail but in those jaws the tail was left just like a lock of hair a mighty jerkthe

should be hard boiled not raw upon the underside of a smooth tray and move the tray round and round horizontally gradually increasing in speed the egg resting in the middle of the tray is carried round and round by the movement and gradually begins to revolve on its own axis faster and faster till at last it is seen to rise on end and spin away exactly as a top would do in all experiments involving eggbalancing you will find it a material aid to success to keep the egg upright in the saucepan while it is being boiled the airchamber will in such case be kept central with the longer axis of the egg which will in consequence be much more easily balanced to set the egg spinning as above described demands a considerable amount of practice not to mention some strength and still more address for the benefit of those who may prefer to succeed at the first attempt i will indicate a simpler plan of proceeding place the tray on the table letting it project so far over the edge as to be readily and rapidly grasped by the hand place the egg in the middle and with the thumb of the left and the first finger of the right hands placed at opposite ends set it vigorously spinning it will imme¬ diately rise on end still spinning quickly seize the tray and you will then have nothing to do but to keep the egg still rotating which is a very easy matter to lift a tumbler with the opeh hand the problem in this case as shown on preceding page is to lift a glass of water making it adhere to the palm of the open hand you will readily guess that the effect depends on the existence of a partial vacuum be¬ neath the hand but you may be glad to know how such vacuum is to be obtained the method is simplicity itself it is as followsplace the glass on the table and lay the palm of your hand over its mouth bending down the four fingers at a right angle as shown in the low r er figure of our illustra¬ tion this done if still resting the palm of the hand on the edge of the glass you quickly raise the four fingers so as to have the hand outspread as in the upper figure you will have produced beneath your hand a partial vacuum sufficient to enable the atmospheric pressure to overcome the force of gravity and the tumbler of water will remain attached like a cuppingglass to yourhand to balance an egg on tiie neck of a bottle insert into an ordinary cork one on either side as seen in illustration on pre¬ ceding page two forks of exactly equal weight hollow slightly the lower end of the cork so that it may adapt itself with tolerable exactness to the larger end of the egg place the opposite extremity of the egg on the edge of the neck of a bottle holding it as upright as possible a curious com trick after one or two attempts you will find that the combination rests in equilibrium a curious coin trick take a wineglass of conical shape whose largest diameter is a shade larger than that of a silver dollar place at the bottom a dime and above it the dollar which should rest about a quarter of an inch below the edge and act as a sort of lid you may now announce that without touching either the glass or the larger coin you will make the dime fly out of the glass to do this you have only to blow smartly on the nearer edge of the dollar the coin turns on its own axis assuming a vertical position and at the same moment the compressed air forced by your breath under the dime makes this latter jump a selfbalancing plate out of the glass after which the dollar reverts to its original condition the experiment will succeed with wineglasses of various shapes a selfbalancing plate the bastingladle the modest sceptre of her majesty the cook has often played its part in the performance of some curious experiments apparently contravening the laws of gravity let us add to it its sister the skimmer and the two combined will enable us to place the edge of an inverted plate on the brim of a drinkingglass or the lip of a water carafe as seen in illustration on preceding page where it will remain in stable equilibrium hook the handle of the ladle on to the edge of the plate and wedge it up tightly with a slice of cork so that it cannot shift to either side with the left hand apply the edge of the plate to the neck of the waterbottle and with the right hook the skimmer on to the bowl of the ladle after a few trials moving the edge of the plate backwards and forwards over the neck of the bottle you will hit the exact position in which it will rest equilibrium the force of the breath when you blow into a paper bag in order to swell it out afterwards bursting it with a blow to produce the familiar bang have you ever stopped to ask yourself what was the precise force of your breath you know that such force can be measured by the instrument known as the spirometer which you occasionally see at a railway station or a country fair but a simple paper bag may be made to answer the purpose of the spirometer as i propose to explain the bag must be rather long and narrow air tight and of thin tough paper lay it hat near the edge of a table with the mouth turned towards yourself place various weights upon it increasing by degrees and you will be surprised at the weight that your breath will thus lift to upset a couple of websters dictionaries placed one upon the other will be mere childs play as you will find on putting the matter to the test an animated siiadow there is nothing very complicated about the experiment we are about to describe but our readers will find it very much easier to comprehend if instead of merely reading our explanation they will try it for themselves everybody knows that if you place yourself between a lighted candle and the wall your body will throw a shadow on the latter but such shadow will only be in profile and you cannot expect to see within its compass eyes nose or mouth i am about to describe a method which not merely supplies these absent features but will even make the eyes roll from side to side and the mouth furnished with teeth of portentous size open and shut as though eager to devour some member of the company to produce this effect you must place yourself at one cor¬ ner of the room near a wall to which a lookingglass is at¬ tached the person who holds the light behind you must are range by varying as needful its elevation and distance from the wall that the reflection of the light in the glass shall fall exactly on the same spot of the wall as the shadow of your head the reflection of the glass will appear as a luminous oval or rectangle within the shadow if however you cover the mirror with a sheet of stout paper in which you have cut out as shown in our illustration two eyes a nose and mouth as grotesque as you please the luminous rays passing through these openings will alone be reflected and will appear duly placed as shapes of light in the middle of the shadow of your head with the effect shown in our illustration to make the experiment still more startling you may cover the mirror with two papers cut out in like manner one being fixed the other movable this latter you will move as may be needed in front of the other when the spectators will as i have stated see the eyes roll and mouth open in an alarming manner to pass a persons body through a playingcard if you chance to be at an evening party and somebody obliges with a few card tricks invite the performer when you see him approaching the end of his budget to pass himself through a card he will probably reply that he will do so if you find him a card big enough but the problem will seem more for¬ midable when you tell him that you mean a playingcard of ordinary size not to keep him too long in suspense you take a card and cut it longitudinally down the middle stopping just short of each end as shown by diagram no 1 of our illustration you fold the card in half along the line of the incision and then with a pair of scissors you make a succession of cuts through the double thickness from each side alternately as shown in diagram no 2 again unfolding the card and drawing its ends apart you will find it transformed into an endless extensible band composed of a number of little slips joined together the angles between them becoming less and less acute as you pull as abovementioned till they are drawn sufficiently far apart to allow you to pass the card over and around your body or your body through the card as you have undertaken to do to drive a needle through a penny to drive a needle through a penny par¬ ticularly if the needle be a fine one seems at first sight an impossibility it is however a very easy matter if you set about it in the right way all you have to do is to thrust the needle through a cork allowing the point to project slightly and then with a pair of cutting pliers nip off all that remains exposed at the opposite end place cork and penny as shown in our illustration on preceding page or simply let the coin rest on a piece of soft wood and hammer away vigorously on the top of the cork holding it in position with the left hand the needle being steel is harder than the copper of the coin and the cork preventing it from bending to either side it may be driven through the penny or any other coin of like substance with perfect ease the divided pear the problem in this case is to find the position in which a knife must be held that a pear suspended high up near to the ceiling shall on the severing of the thread to which it is attached so fall as to cut itself in half upon the blade there is no necessity for line or plummet we need only to dip the suspended pear in a glass of water which we forthwith remove the water drips from it we note the exact spot on the floor or table where the drops fall and make a private mark on such spot this is done privately beforehand so that the company on their arrival find the pear suspended in readiness for the feat and know nothing of the telltale drop at the proper moment you hold the knife edge upwards immediately over the point which you have marked while someone applies a lighted match to the thread if you have duly followed our instructions the pear in falling should cut itself in half upon the blade for the experiment as above described one knife only is used but it may also be performed with two knives as shown in our illustration on preceding page the knives must cross each other over the precise point where the drop falls the pear will then cut itself into four pieces which may be caught on a plate or tray held just below the knives a few preliminary trials will be desirable before attempting to show the experiment in public to spin a penny upon the point of a needle beml a hairpin as shown in our illustration on preceding page place a penny horizontally on the righthand hook which should be narrow enough to clip it closely and hang upon the lefthand hook a tolerably heavy finger ring or two if one is found insufficient place the free edge of the coin on some upright point that of a ladys bonnetpin for example and you will find that the com¬ bination can be made to balance itself furthermore by gently blowing upon the ring you can set the apparatus revolving rapidly without any disturbance of its equilibrium if you spin the penny upon a very sharp steel needle you will find that the needle will at length work its way completely through the coin you may therefore if you please propound your puzzle in this rather striking form how to bore a hole through a penny by merely blowing upon it the bottle and the keys take six keys in descending gradations of size for facility of reference we will call them com¬ mencing with the largest 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 respectively place nos 1 and 2 with their bitts resting on the table and pass the bow of no 2 through that of no 1 as shown in the figure the two keys will make a tolerably obtuse angle and by pressing downwards with the hand on their bows it may be ascertained interlocked and that neither of them is likely these two keys serve as a foundation for the that they are solidly to slip on the table rest you now pass the bitt of no 3 through the bow of no 2 and then in suc¬ cession the bitts of nos 4 5 and 6 through the bows of nos 3 4 and 5 meanwhile making sure by looking down on them from above that they are all in the same vertical plane if the successive interlockings of the bitts within the bows have been prop¬ erly made which you will ascertain by a gentle pressure on the key no 6i which crowns the edifice nothing will be easier than to make the bows of nos 5 and 6 the position of this last being all but horizontal support a variety of articles of domestic use to enhance the effect the more fragile the article the better say a plate a souptureen a decanter or a bottle if a bottle be used it should only be half full so as to keep its centre of gravity low down this increases the stability or perhaps we should say decreases the in¬ stability of your rather precarious structure to drill a hole with a needle through a pin the pin is stuck in the head of a cork into which are thrust one on either side two penknives of equal weight should there be a trifling difference in this particular it may be got over by varying the degrees of opening place the head of the pin on the end of your finger and open or close the blades of the knives bit by bit till the pin rests exactly horizontal then transfer it to the point of a needle stuck head downwards in the cork of a bottle by blowing upon the cork which holds the penknives you may set the combination in movement revolving on the point of the needle further the needle will speedily begin to work a hole in the pin and will in due time make its way completely through it tiie fivestraw puzzle you are supplied with five straws of equal length about three and a half inches and you are required to lift all five holding only the tip of one of them how is it to be managed our illustration answers the question a glance will show you the arrangement of the five little straws and the coin in their centre which is as will be seen as simple as possiblewhen you know it the use of the coin is an optional addition it wedges all tight and prevents the straws slipping when once put together but it is by no means indispen¬ sable if you propound the problem to an uninitiated person you will be surprised to find how long a time he will expend before finding the solution puzzles of this kind have in them a scientific element which interests the intellect while they at the same time train the hand to delicacy of manipulation an optical illusion cut strips out of a visitingcard in such manner as to transform it into a sort of parallelbarred grating as shown in the figure and then move up and down behind it a narrow strip of paper or card cut perfectly straight from end to end and pivoted on a pin thrust through one corner of the larger card when the movable bar is pretty nearly perpendicular to the bars of the grating its edges will appear straight but as you slope it more and more with reference to the bars its edges will appear more and more to deviate from the straight line as if broken into little steps this is especially striking when the bar reaches the lowest position shown in our illustration when it is only by actually ap¬ plying a ruler to the edges of the bar that you are enabled to resist the optical illusion we have referred to and to satisfy yourself that these apparently distorted lines are in reality perfectly straight a lifesized dancingdoll this is a little amusement which requires absolutely no preparation and which is within the reach of everybody place yourself beside a wardrobe having a mirror door as shown in our illustration in such manner that onehalf of your body is hidden the other half projecting beyond the front of the wardrobe to a person facing you at a proper distance it will appear that he sees your whole person inasmuch as the visible half of your body is reflected in the glass causing the illusion that the whole is seen if you raise the visible arm the spectator will see another arm of like shape and position elevate itself in the mirror so that you will appear to raise both arms so far you have not done anything out of the common for it is not difficult to lift both arms at once but it will be quite a different thing when you come to raise the leg shown beyond the glass in sucli case the glass will give the reflection of a second leg lifted simultaneously so that your body having to all appearance quitted its point of support on the floor you will seem to be lifting both legs at once like a jumping jack when the string is pulled the magic dart take an ordinary sewingneedle of medium size with a good sharp point stand at three paces distance from a door or wooden partition and holding the needle between your finger and thumb try by throwing it as strongly as you can to make it stick in the woodwork try as you will however great your skill or unwearied your perseverance you will never succeed now however pass through the eye of the needle a simple bit of thread and try again you will succeed every time in planting the needle in the door or piece of woodwork you have chosen for the target the little bit of thread you have added has transformed your needle into an effective dart and makes its point almost as a matter of course strike and penetrate the object against which it is thrown so remarkable a result will not fail to excite the astonishment of the spectators and you will be gratified by hearing on all sides complimentary re¬ marks upon your extraordinary skill the conjurer comus who was the inventor of this feat covered the use of the thread by a very artful expedient he made the company select among a number of threads of different colors that which lie was to use in order as he said to prove that it was the chosen needle and no other that was fixed in the partition the use of the thread which in reality formed the secret of the trick was thus made to appear a mere expedient for proving that there was no deception the reader wull find in this experiment a reminiscence of the dart composed of a penholder with paper wings as shown at the foot of our illustration with which we were all familiar at school and which has brought many a luckless wight to a modern tantalus g rief for practicing the throwing of the javelin when he ought to have been studying homer or virgil a modern tantalus place a chair on the ground so that the front shall rest on the floor the back and the two hinder legs being in the same horizontal plane invite some person to kneel on the rail which crosses between the two hind legs and while in that position to pick up with his mouth a lump of sugar resting on the back of the upper rail the thing at first sight seems a very easy matter but if the person who tries the experiment is not careful to bend his knees and draw his body well back on his hams so that his centre of gravity shall remain in the rear of the seat of the chair it will inevitably tip forward as shown in our second illustration and the victim like a modern tantalus will see the sugar shoot away from him at the very moment when he thinks he has secured it candle lighting under difficulties in a modern tantalus the experiment of the gentleman kneeling on the rail of a chair which we have entitled a modern tantalus the difficulty of maintaining the balance lies in the direction of the length of the body and the novice as we have seen tips forward in the recreation we are about to describe the victim rolls over side¬ ways to right or left at his selection or as the fates decide the feat to be performed is as followstwo persons kneel on the ground facing each other each holds in his left hand a candle in a candlestick at the same time grasping his right foot in his right hand this position compels him to balance himself on his left knee one of the candles is lighted the other is not the holders are required to light the unlighted candle from the lighted one the conditions as will be seen are simple enough but you would hardly believe how often the performers will roll over on the floor before they succeed in lighting the candle it will be found de¬ sirable to spread a newspaper on the floor between the com¬ batants many spots of candle grease will thus be intercepted and the peace of mind of the lady of the house proportionately spared the obstinate cork take a winebottle and a cork of a size considerably smaller than its mouth say the cork of a medicine phial place it just within the neck of the bottle held horizon¬ tally and invite anyone to drive it into the bottle by blowing it in the thing seems simple enough the experimentalist blows with all the power of his lungs but the cork instead of being driven into the bottle flies out in his face and the more smartly he blows the more vigorous will be its exit he tries again this time blowing gently but the result is the same the cork will insist on coming out instead of going into the bottle the explanation of the phenomenon which is very amusing to lookerson is as followswhen the experimenter blows upon the cork a certain quantity of air is at the same time forced into the bottle and is compressed with so much energy that it forms an elastic cushion behind the cork which pressing against such cushion is rapidly shot out again if you have proposed a bet on the subject you will certainly win unless indeed your adversary happens to be which i trust for his own sake he may a reader of queeries which will furnish him with not one only but three ways of getting the better of the obstinate cork 1 since if you blow on the cork it is driven out again by the air which is thereby compressed in the bottle try whether you do not succeed better by adopting the opposite plan i e by exhausting the air by so doing as you will find on trial you create a partial vacuum within the bottle the moment your mouth leaves the neck air rushes in to fill the void and the cork carried forward by the current thus produced slides comfortably to the bottom of the bottle 2 a partial vacuum or rarefaction of the air may be pro¬ duced by warming the bottle over a lamp or before a fire this done the current of cooler air from the mouth will drive the cork into the bottle 3 lastly if you have at hand a small tube of any kind say a straw a pipestem or even a stick of macaroni you have only in order to succeed to blow through this tube pointing it squarely at the base of the cork which will immediately enter the bottle a startler for a careful housekeeper there is no rose without its thorn and it must be admitted as the one drawback to the magic of common things that when the u common things in question take the form of the best tea set the experiments are apt to cause materfamilias some anxiety of mind the experiment we are about to describe is of this kind you are required to balance a coffeecup on the point of a carvingknife the accessories are simple enough in fact you find them all at hand when you taive your seat at the dinnertable a cork a tablefork nothing more is required save indeed the knowledge how its done and the skill to do it pass the cork through the handle of a coffeecup it should fit tightly enough to be a close fit but not so tightly as to part cup and handle next thrust the fork into the cork two of its teeth on either side of the handle of the cup in such manner that the opposite end of the fork shall incline slightly towards the bottom of the cup the centre of gravity of the whole being a startler for a careful thus made to fall below the cup you place the latter on the point of a knife and by successive trials you will in due time find the exact spot on which it will rest in equilibrium the underside of teacups being usually enameled there must be no trembling of the hand which holds the knife or the cup would slip and fall at the outset it is well to keep the opposite hand close to the handle of the fork so as to be able to seize it and save the cup in case of a fall the second portion of our illustration shows another method of producing the same effect a couple of tableknives crossed being substituted for the fork a final hint if you wish to make sure of your coffee drink it before you try to balance the cup the rotation of the globe when you next chance to eat an egg for breakfast do not fail to try the following experiment it is one which always succeeds and is productive of much amusement to the company moisten slightly with water the rim of your plate and in the centre paint with the yolk of the egg you see you have not far to go for coloring material a sun with golden rays by the aid of this simple apparatus you will be in a position to illustrate so clearly that a child can compre¬ hend it the double movement of the earth which revolves simul¬ taneously round the sun and on its own axis all that you have to do is to place the empty half shell of your egg on the rim of the plate and keeping this latter duly sloped by a slight movement of the wrist as may be needful you will see the eggshell begin to revolve rapidly on its own axis at the same time traveling round the plate the slight cohesion caused by the water which moistens the plate counteracts the centrifugal force and so prevents the eggshell falling olf the edge of the plate a paper fish made to swim at pleasure out out of ordinary paper a fish as shown in our illus¬ tration in the centre of the body must be a circular opening a com¬ municating with the tail by a narrow canal a b place water in some ob¬ long vessel a fishkettle will answer and lay the fish carefully on the water so that its underside shall be thoroughly wetted though its upper surface remains dry you may then challenge the company to set the fish in motion without touching or blowing upon it they will probably 44 give it up this is all you have to do pour delicately one or two drops of oil within the circular opening a the oil will strive to spread itself over the surface of the water but it can only do so by traveling along the little canal a b by a reactive effect the fish will be impelled in a direction opposite to that in which the oil escapes or in other words forwards and the movement will last long enough to set the spectators wondering at this strange movement of a mere bit of paper on the surface of the liquid a move¬ ment which if not initiated in they will be wholly unable to account for a plate balanced on a needle everyone who has visited a circus or a musichall has seen the familiar jugglers trick of spinning plates saladbowls and other household utensils on the tip of a pointed stick the object spun is usually of wood or metal and its equilibrium is only temporary depending upon centrifugal force and coming to an end as soon as the rotatory movement is no longer strong enough to counter¬ act the force of gravitation the method we are about to describe goes farther than this by its aid an ordinary plate may be sup¬ ported in a condition of stable equilibrium on the point of a needle and may even be set spinning while thus delicately poised split a couple of corks down the middle and into each of the four halves thus obtained thrust the prongs of a tablefork forming with the flat surface made by the cut a little less than a right angle place the four corks thus weighted round the plate at equal distances as shown in our illustration on preceding page taking care that the teeth of the forks are well home against the edge of the plate so as to prevent 44 wobbling the plate thus loaded may be balanced upon the point of a needle thrust head downwards into the cork of a bottle by careful manipulation so as to prevent slipping you may set the plate spinning the rotatory movement will continue for a consider¬ able time the friction at the point of contact being practically nil pencils balanced in midair the object of this experiment which we specially dedicate to young gentlemen at school is to balance in space two leadpencils the one in a horizontal position with its point resting on a needle or suspended by a thread the other upright with its point resting on the opposite end of the first pencil our readers are by this time so familiar with the principles of balancing as illustrated in our previous experiments that this will require but little explanation the two knives of equal weight keeping the pencil horizontal see the illustration will recall the experi¬ ment of the pin perforated by a needle as described on another page the balancing of the second pencil kept perpendicular by the aid of a couple of penholders is a very hackneyed feat but the combination of the two seems to us sufficiently original to be worthy of special notice if our young readers have rigged up the arrangement with sufficient care they may even set it spinning round the point of suspension once started it will revolve for a considerable time the selfbalaxced ladle with the aid of the ordinary basting ladle to be found in every kitchen we are enabled to exhibit a balancing experiment wherein the centre of gravity is not merely brought below but carried to one side of the point of suspension place a half opened pocketknife on the edge of a table as smwn in the drawing hook the shank of the ladle over the angle made by knife and blade the concavity of the bowl being turned towards the table and leave all to itself the knife will rock and the ladle swing backwards and forwards till they rest in stable equilibrium if you now fill the bowl of the ladle with sand the knife will not fall but on the contrary its angle will rise higher and higher a problem in gymnastics place a low stool on the floor close against the wall and yourself facing the wall with your feet distant from it just double the width of the stool stoop down and grasp the stool with one hand on either side and rest your head against the wall now lift the stool from the floor and slowly raise yourself to the erect positionor rather endeavor to do so it is better to try the experiment for the first time on a well carpeted floor on polished oak or parquetry you would probably have a nasty fall a problem in gymnastics we have here a curious effect of the displacement of the centre of gravity of the body which renders it almost impossible to stand upright without first replacing the stool on the ground and resting the hand upon it to get the needful support to balance a pencil on its point our illustration supplies without need of further explanation the solution of the prob¬ lem you have merely to dig the blade of a halfopen penknife into the pencil a little above the point and to open or close the blade little by little till you find that the balance is obtained the combination of pencil and pen knife thus placing itself in equilibrium is an illustration of a familiar law of mechanics the centre of gravity of the combination to balance a pencil on its point falls below the point of support the finger the edge of the table or the like and thus stable equilibrium is obtained robinson crusoes pen our pen which we will christen with your permission the pen of robinson crusoe is no other than the twin

means of a bit of thread tied round them near the points as shown in fig 2 here you have a pen furnished with the orthodox pair of nibs sharp enough for anything and ready to write what¬ ever you may desire by way of penholder thrust your pen into the cavity of a short straight piece cut from the branch of another tree say lilac or elder allowing the two points to project half an inch or so or still better fix it in a pipestem as shown in fig 3 the large diameter of the case will prevent the pen slipping altogether into the extempore penholder jnow dip your pen into the ink stand do not remove it at once as you are accustomed to do with other pens but let it rest a little while in the liquid by virtue of capillary attraction the ink will rise in the tube formed by the con¬ junction

grown to their proper strength and attained the use of their wings and the full plumage of their featheis when the owner of the field overlooking his crop now quite ripe said the time is come when i must send to all my neighbors to help me with my harvest one of the young larks heard his speech and related it to his mother inquiring of her to what place they should move for safety there is no occasion to move yet my son she replied the man who only sends to his friends to help him with his harvest is not really in earnest the owner of the field again came a few days later and saw the wheat shedding the grain from excess of ripeness and said i will come myself tomorrow with my laborers and with as many reapers as i can hire and will get in the harvest the lark on hearing these words said to her brood it is time now to be off my little ones for the man is in earnest this time he no longer trusts to his friends but will reap the field himself selfhelp is the best help now then the mother said we must be gone wgm ii where shall we hide it where oh where cried a little fluttering bird of the air she had searched the marshes and meadows ov r er thicket and hedgerow sprouting wheatfields grass and clover her mate had left her there in the dew for the very peak of heavens blue a tenor singer he was and sweet where the ariettas he dropped from cloudland down at her feet i will leave it all to your womans wit and will sing while you are deciding it he said and went soaring aloft upup spilling his music as water is spilled from an oerful cun soon she discovered the very best the cunningest cosiest spot for a nest right where the wheat grew green as could be in the wind glistening tumbling and rolling tossed like the sea there was the dear nest skillfully made five little freckled green eggs in it laid softly she hovered there striving to tell just where the pretty things pecking and rapping would peep from the shell long had the hours seemed while she sat there had it not been for the song in the air even by looking up she could descry that little feather speck sending down tunes to her out of the sky what was it stirred so under her wings higher her mate soars louder he sings five little birds hatched each one a lark ah when they fledge and fly how will all summertide listen and hark ripening slowly all round the cosey house hidden and lowly grew fast the little flock speckled of breast gaping their hungry mouths till overrunning was the home nest warn wagged every wheathead yellow of beard almost the harvest watchful lark feared so when abroad they flew searching for food worms caterpillars midges or beetles they warned their brood r if any noise you hear hover each other any strange voices near call to your mother for when the grainfields yellowing stand ripened for stack or thatch then do the reapers come sickle in hand one day a strange step paused near their bed and the old farmerman thoughtfully said aye it is ripe enough i will go find some of my neighbor folk to help me cut it rake it and bind wildly the nestlings hearts flutter and beat scarce had they breath the grim news to repeat laughed the lark mother fie do not worry if he depends on friends then take your ease my dear there is no hurrv so when another day farmer once more planned for the neighbors help just as before all the wise little ones smiled with disdain there is no danger yet here in our golden grove we can remain av but the time came at last when with dismay parent larks heard the bluff old fellow say well wait no longer for others my son but bright and early well go at the work ourselves then twill be done now then the mother cried pack up your things try well your bills and feet shake out your wings soon as you spy the first glimmer of dawn even though the heavy dew drabbles and drenches us we must be gone why piped the little lark why oh why hush hush the father sighed hushwe must fly long as he counted on other mens aid so long in shelter of harvest ungathered we could have staid but you have heard him say to his son theyll cut the grain themselves now twill be done then such a flurry rose such stirring whirring that even the field mice wondered and marveled what was occurring when dawns red sparkles kindled the dew up from the wheatfield seven larks flew up far as arrows shot from a bow while far below them sickles where whetted grain was laid low m a wee wee woman was little old dame fidget and she lived by herself in a wee wee room and early every morning so tidy was her habit she began to sweep it out with a wee

were merely lads not one was able so small he was when he was born so tiny to earn the crust of bread since then he had become though scant it might be coarse and black and humble thatfor he was no bigger than your finger with which he must be fed they called him hopomythumb and worst of all the youngest one was puny so odd and still and slight that father mother and the other brothers thought him not over bright now at this time for days and days together there fell no drop of rain the corn shrunk on the stalks and in the sunshine rustled the shriveled grain as if a fire had swept across the meadows they shriveled in the drouth and what this meant for the poor fagotmaker was famine without doubt one night he sat before a smouldering fire his head bowed down with grief trying with those weak wits of hito compass some scheme for their relief his wife above the feeble embers hovered and wrung her toilhard hands she knew there was no help for their starvation no hope in making plans at last he spoke ah bad luck to the trying i cannot find them food tomorrow morning with me to the forest ill take the little brood i cannot bear to watch this piecemeal starving so while they run and play or gather fagots for me or pick berries to eat ill come away oh groaned the wife im sure the wolves will eat them poor dearspoor little dears yet do as you think bestwe all must perish then went to bed in tears meanwhile though all the rest were sleeping soundly hopomythumb had heard and at the thought of wolves and woods in terror his little heart was stirred and so he lay and planned and early dressed him and ran with all his might down to the river where he filled his pockets with pebbles small and white and as they started for the wood he lingered somewhat behind and when they came to dismal places dropped in secret a pebble now and then then all but hopomythumb wailed out affrighted dont cry so hard said he ill find the path if youll but keep together and try to follow me by the white stones strewn on the dead pine needles though night had fallen he soon led the way out and spied their humble cottage low lying neath the moon thick grew the trees twas twilight in their shadows although broad day without but gay the laddies at the fagotpicking went scampering about and chattering like a flock of busy sparrows till having hungry grown they turned to ask their mother for their dinner and found they were alone they hurried near and pausing at the window hopomythumb climbed up and peeped within his father and his mother were just about to sup someone had paid them two gold guineas on an old debt and when they went for beef for two they were so hungry they bought enough for ten quick as a flash the ravenous seven went rushing pellmell into the house nor left of the fine roast upon the table enough to feed a mouse it all went well long as the money lasted when that was gone once more the father planned to take them to the forest and leave them as before but when once more they found themselves deserted and little hopomythumb felt sure to lead them out he found the finches had eaten every crumb then what to do they wandered hither thither for hours in dread and fear until at last they saw with fitful glimmer a feeble light appear it shone but faintly like a single candle but trudging towards the ray they reached a house and knocked the door was opened after a brief delay again they went through brier and through thicket into the darksome wood again he dropped his clues along the pathway behind him when he could and a kind woman asked them what they wanted they said to stay all night run run away the faster you run the better she answered in affright hopomythumb who heard again the plotting crept from his trundlebed but in the place of pebbles in his pockets put only crumbs of bread an ogre lives here cruel and bloody minded he eats up little boys run run i hear him coming from the mountains i know him by the noise but we cant run we are so faint and tired hopomythumb began tis all the same whether the wolves shall eat us or your good gentleman and so she took them in fed them and hid them all underneath her bed and in a minute more they heard approaching tramp tramp an awful tread it was the ogre coming home his supper was steaming nice and hot two calves upon a spit ten rabbits roasting a whole sheep in the pot he banged the door wide open sniffed and snorted i then in a dreadful voice i roared out while his poor wife stood by and trembled 1 smell seven little boys in vain she told him twas the mutton scorching the veal had browned too fast he searched the house peering around and under and reached the bed at last then dragged them one by one out fairly shouting nx at little hopomythumb 5f saying the lads would make towards a dinner k six mouthfuls and one crumb au oh leave them till tomorrow cried the woman youve meat enough tonight well so i have he said ill wait a little fe ah ugh theyre plump and white now it so chanced the ogre had seven daughters and all slept in one bed a lar e e room an d each wore for a nightcap a gold crown on her head and hopomythumb when all the house was quiet into their chamber crept and the gold headbands for himself and brothers stole from them while they slept he scoured the country rumbling like a tempest far near they heard his roar until at last his sevenleague feet grew tired and he could go no more and down he lay to rest him for a minute the day had grown so hot close to a rock where lav the seven children 9 although he knew it not and hopomythumb creeping from out his crevice with greatest caution drew the ogres boots off these would shrink or widen just as you wished them to wicked and sly it was he knew the ogre would no doubt rise at dawn and being but half awake would kill the children who had no nightcaps on t wife fetch my sevenleague boots at once he shouted ill catch the vipers yet he stamped his feet into the magic leather with many a muttered threat hopomythumb spoke softly to his brothers run fast as ever you can and leave me to take care of mr ogre and hurryscurry they ran then hopomythumb awakening his brothers whispered make haste and fly without a word they did as they were bidden in twinkling of an eye out in the drizzly mist of a gray morning off through the chill and dew and none too soon within an hour the ogre his dreadful blunder knew and off he started over hill and valley seven leagues at every stride the children saw him like a giant shadow but they could only hide and sure enough he did he was so drowsy and fogs so veiled the sun that whetting up a huge broadbladed dagger he slew them every one and put them on himself then he decided to hasten to the king and as he traveled towards the royal palace each boot was like a wing there was a war the king had need of service in carrying the news he heard his tale and said tll use this fellow who wears the magic shoes so little hopomythumb made mints of money and his whole family lived very easy lives and from his bounty grew rich as rich could be as for the ogre in his sleep he tumbled down from that ledge of rock and was so bumped and bruised he never rallied but perished from the shock and hopomythumb whose influence in high places was certain to prevail made the kind ogress who had hidden and fed them duchess of draggletail a shepherd boy who watched a flock of sheep near a village brought out the villagers three or four times by crying out wolf wolf and when his neighbors came to help him laughed at them for their pains the wolf however aid truly come at last the shepherd boy now really alarmed shouted in an agony of terror pray do come and help me the wolf is killing the sheep but no one paid any heed to his cries nor rendered any assistance the wolf having no cause ot fear took it easily and lacerated or destroyed the whole flock there is no believing a liar even when he speaks the truth n idle lad a loitering lad was the only son th shepherd had he knew the cleanest sunny corner of every village street mw he liked as well as any other the curbstone for a seat and he stood as if an iron anchor were fastened to his feet i the father said and shook his head ah me hell never earn his bread nor even the salt to salt his porridge though bread and salt w r ere cheap and how can i plan it any better than to have him mind the sheep the meadows were sparce the pasture stony the hillside bleak and steep so day by day half soyr half gay he loafed the summer hours away he w r atched the white flocks cropping cropping or huddled in the shade and heard for voices the drowsy jangle the one small sheepbell made with now and then the piteous bleating of a lamb from its mother strayed i nothing to do the whole day through no one to talk with that he knew what wonder his mind was a field for folly and that like a wicked seed it sprouted there to grow and blossom into a naughty deed satan will find some mischief ever for idle hands we read £««« down the hillside as if terrified one day he ran and running cried wolf wolf the simple folk of the village came out with great concern left bench and desk and shop and counter the dreaded news to learn left needle and awl and nail and hammer left cradle oven and churn from every door peered one or more till the roused ones numbered twice a score a wolf they queried and armed with a shovel with sickle or hoe or spade with broomstick poker tongs or ladle with cleaver or saw or blade they swarmed along to the threatened pasture and a fine display they made they crowded they ran the millerman was white with flour and dustwith bran the tailor had on his big brass thimble but the chopper had no ax the women left their humdrum treadles where they were spinning flax and joined the march though forced to carry their babies on their backs they reached the rocks there were the flocks grazing with burrs in their woolly locks but where was the wolf so fierce and hairy the wolf so gaunt and spare with white fangs glistening and red tongue lolling ready his prey to tear not even so much as a dewwet footprint t feta was visible anywhere a then wondering greatly back sedately they turned to the work theyd left so lately while the boythe worthless little rascal thinking of what hed done and left once more to his own devices laughed aloud at the fun till from his eyes like the drips of a shower from the eaves the water run what need to be so dull cried he when simply one little word from me can bring abroad these silly people and give them such a chase for an hour at least my stupid pasture was quite a lively place and again the merry wrinkles puckered the muscles of his face no hurt nor blame from this frolic came but the lagging days droned on the same ever a gray blank or a blue one the sky was overhead ever the sheep kept cropping cropping and yet were never fed ever he longed for the village gossip but silence had instead therefore to repeat his wolfcry cheat he thought might serve as a jovial treat and again through the street he sped and shouted just as he did before and butcher and baker and candlestick maker ran zealously out once more it seemed that dozens of women and children issued from every door did they find the foe of the flock ah no they saw through the twofold humbug though and when to their workshops and their houses returning an angry crowd with hands on their hastilygathered weapons each one declared and vowed there never had been so base a swindle while the ladhe laughed aloud now it chanced next day as he sprawling lay whistling his vagrant breath away a wolf in truth all gaunt and hairy came stealing from the wood a grizzlyskinned and leanribbed giant it right before him stood with white fangs glistening and red tongue lolling and great eyes shot with blood pellmell he fled whether heels or head were uppermost could scarce be said help help wolf wolf he cried till echo help help wolf wolf replied over stock and stone he leaped believing the lank beast at his side the strength of his lungs increasing trebled help help wolf wolf he cried did the butcher baker and candlestick maker the weaver brewer and undertaker and ever r little old man and woman rush out this time to see ah no the blacksmith swung his hammer the woodman chopped his tree the granddame whirled her steelbright spindle as placid as could be the baker baked the gardener raked the mower mowed till his shoulders ached the pretty schoolmistress ranged her classes ready to read and spell a girl peered over the windlass handle £ to see herself in the well tjfj the carpenter planed the tinker tinkered the merchant tried to sell not the glance of an eye nor word of reply was given the crier or the cry hes a mischiefmaker a goodfornothing they silently agreed and that he is allowed to make such a clamor is a burning shame indeed the wilder his terror the more he shouted the less they seemed to heed too sad to tell too cruel to tell is the fate that those poor sheep befell left thus by a false and foolish shepherd to meet a foe so grim he hunted them scattered them overtook them and rent them limb from limb for a pack of his leanribbed grizzly brothers gave savage aid to him so the lazy lad the loitering lad the only son the shepherd had became a byword in the village of folly and distrust flocks lost he could not earn his living he was fed on the merest crust he cheated he idled we couldnt believe him his neighbors said tis just trotting along the first one saw a man who carried a bundle of straw give me some straw for a house and bed the little pig said straightway not even waiting a bit the kind man did as he was bid and the little pig built a house of it but he was no more than settled before a wolf came along and knocked at the door taptap and cried little pig little pig let me come ini a h very very poor was she old dame pig with her children three robust beautiful little ones were those three sons each wearing always without fail a little fanciful knot in his tail but never enough of sour or sweet had they to eat and so one day with a piteous squeak did the mother speak my sons your fortune you must seek and out in the world as they were sent the three pigs went but the pig replied no no by the hair of my chinny chin chin c the old wolf grumbled and added beside then ill huff and ill puff and ill blow your houac in he was gray and big and he huffed and he puffed and he blew the house in and he ate up the poor little pig the very next day all blithe and gay the second little pig went marching away to the world to find his fortune and when he met two men who bore on their shoulders bunches of furze my gentle sirs give me some furze for a house and bed the little pig said they gave it him freely every whit and the little pig built a house of it but he could no more than get in before the wolf came along and knocked at the door x little pig little pig let me come in but the pig replied 4 no no by the hair of my chinny chin chin then the old wolf growled and added beside then ill huff and ill puff and ill blow your house in he was fierce and big and he huffed and he puffed and he puffed and he huffed and he mew the house in and he ate up the poor little pig and then the third little pig went out with his curly tail and his saucy snout up to all kinds of pranks and tricks and he met a man with a load of bricks and he said i suppose you are perfectly willing to give me those by the begging he got them every one and in a trice was the house begun and very shortly the house was done plastered and snug and nice and along came the same wolf as before and knocked at the door thump thump and cried little pig little pig let me come in cut the pig replied no no by the hair of my chinny chin chin then the wolf filled his cheeks out on each side like a bellows to blow and he howled oh ho then ill huff and ill puff and ill blow your house in well he huffed and he puffed and he huffed and he puffed and he huffed and he puffed but with all his huffing and all his puffing sa the house would not fall in and so despite his appetite he was forced to go with never a bite and for once at past was cheated out of the little pig with the saucy snout of the wily kind though he was and he whined i know little pig where we can find some nice fresh turnips pig grunted where 1 oh over at smiths in his home field its not far there if its pleasant weather shall we go together tomorrow at six yes piggie squealed but what should the little pig contrive but to rise at five next day and to go through the early dew to the field where the turnips grew they were plenty and sweet and he ate of them all he cared to eat and took enough for his dinner and then went home again the wolf came promptly at six oclock gave a friendly knock and asked the pig are you ready to go why id have you know ive already been there and beside ive enough for dinner the pig replied the wolf saw then he was cheated again but i know wheres a lovely apple tree in a winsome voice said he and the wise little pig from where he sat peered outand smiled wheres that at the v iiy garden if youll be fair and its pleasant weather we two together at five in the morning will go there ah sly and cunning the little pig was for as early as four he was out next day and running running hoping to get the apples before the wolf was up but the apple tree proved twice as far as he thought twould be he climbed the boughs in the greatest haste and thought to himself ill only taste as a bit of a lunch but soon crunch cninch he had eaten a scorethen what should he see but the big gray wolf just under the tree yes there he stood trying to look as meek as he could and he said little pig are the apples good pig thought he should fall from where he sat so heavy his heart went pitapat but he answered the nicest under the sun ill throw down one the wolf ran after it as he threw it and before he knew it the pig was out of the tree and as fleet as his four little feet could scamper he fled on into his house while after him sped the wolf with a savage voice and face in a furious chase he was long and slim but the little pig proved too swift for him



PREFACE.


To all Flower Lovers who may read these pages, we come with kindly
greetings. To you we dedicate our Work.

Encouraged by the many testimonials of favor with which our Flower
Sketches have been received, which have appeared in the _Boston
Journal_, _Portland Transcript_, and the leading Floricultural journals,
we were induced to prepare this volume, intending it to be made up
chiefly of those articles revised and enlarged for this purpose; but
after entering upon this work, we found so little that was adapted for
use, nearly every page has been written while the sheets were passing
through the press.

Before we were aware, the printed matter had exceeded our proposed
limits, and we were obliged to enlarge the work by additional pages, and
even then omit our chapter of "Floricultural Notes," for we wished to
put the book at a low price, that it might reach the masses. As it is,
we are sure that we have given you a great amount of valuable
information, and just such as amateurs need, respecting the habits and
requirements of those flowers which are best adapted for general
cultivation, and in a form specially new and attractive, combining the
_history_ and _literature_ of flowers, with description and mode of
culture.

It may be deemed strange that we should omit from a work of this
character a "Talk" about the Queen of Flowers, but the subject was
so full that we thought best to devote the space to other varieties
and refer our readers to our recently published "Essay on
Roses,"--advertised in another part of this work--in which they will
find the subject fully treated.

We would here acknowledge our obligation to Mr. James Vick for the
beautiful Bouquet of Flowers which constitutes our Frontispiece.

                                            MRS. M. D. WELLCOME.
  _Yarmouth, Me._, June 9, 1881.

Introduction.

    "Thank God for the beautiful flowers,
      That blossom so sweetly and fair;
    They garnish this strange life of ours,
      And brighten our paths everywhere."

                             _Dexter Smith._


I have been thinking for some time of writing a few articles about
flowers, not for the entertainment nor instruction of those who have
extensive gardens artistically laid out, and fine conservatories with
skilled gardeners to care for the rare and costly plants, but for those,
who, like myself, have only a few beds filled with flowers, cared for by
one's own self.

Every year there is a marked advance in the floricultural kingdom. Books
and periodicals devoted to flower culture are on the increase; florists
are enlarging their domain; catalogues are scattered broadcast, and as
free as autumn leaves, some of them beautiful with their colored plates,
handsome enough to frame. Very many of the literary, religious, and
political journals of the day have their floral department, in which the
ladies gossip of their experience and exchange opinions, and we doubt if
any column is read with greater interest.

What recreation for the mind and body more pure, refining, healthful,
than that of the cultivation of flowers? How they reveal the Father's
love, and wisdom, and power! How perfect his work! Very fully have I
realized this, as I have examined bud, blossom, and leaf under the
microscope. Its magnifying power when applied to man's work, reveals
coarseness and imperfection, but in God's work only reveals new
beauties, and greater perfectness. The tiny flower, the details of which
cannot be perceived by the eye unaided, when magnified, surprises us
with its loveliness. We wonder and adore that Being whose hand created
its perfect form and arranged its tints with so much harmony. The study
of flowers with the microscope is one of never failing delight, and one
needs not the costly instrument to enjoy this study. The round open
glass, the size of a half dollar, and costing the same, serves every
needful purpose.

Not only have I enjoyed the examination of flowers, but also of insect
life, specially of those terrible pests to our rosebushes and some other
plants--the _aphides_. I have closely watched their development, from
the tiny egg to the portly insect, so filled with the juice of the leaf,
that like it, he is green all over. First I observe a little speck of
red in the egg--then it has slight motion--next it runs about, and the
spot is a little larger, sometimes it is black. Sometimes the baby aphis
is all red. Now and then I find a different sort mixed up with them; the
body is much larger and transparent white. Some have wings. Skeletons,
or more properly, cast-off skins, are often seen, but with the closest
observation I have never been able to trace these to their source. Once,
I was sure that a fellow was divesting himself of his overcoat, and I
watched him till my eyes ached too badly for further investigation.

These insects are the cows of a certain species of ant, and I am sure
they are quite welcome to all I have, provided they will have their yard
on other premises, though I would like to detain them long enough to see
the milking process. Some have seen it and written about it, so, strange
as it seems, it is no fiction.

In this series of articles which I have entitled "Talks About Flowers,"
I shall, in a very informal manner, talk to you about just those matters
pertaining to the flower garden, in which beginners and amateurs are
interested; to this class I belong; I am not a skilled florist, my
experience is limited; I am only a student in the lower classes of
floriculture, but I dearly love my lessons. I am acquiring knowledge
both from books and personal observation, and I shall enjoy imparting to
those not so favored with time and resources the results of this study,
believing it will be duly appreciated by my readers, and their interest
in the cultivation of flowers be thereby increased. I shall talk to you
about the sowing of seeds, the arrangement of your garden, the plants
with which to stock it, treating of them historically and descriptively,
with mode of culture. I shall talk to you about the most desirable
bulbs, about climbing plants, hanging pots, and the window garden, and
shall seek to meet in all these the wishes of many inquirers.




A Talk to Farmers' Wives.

    "Not useless are ye flowers, though made for pleasure,
      Blooming in field and wood by day and night;
    From every source your presence bids me treasure
                            Harmless delight."


"Once more I take my pen in hand," as the old time epistle was wont to
begin. While a "Young Farmer" discourseth of matters pertaining to the
farm, I propose to talk to farmers' wives and daughters of matters
relating to the flower garden. This article is specially dedicated to
them, and not to them as a whole, but to that class among them who take
no periodical devoted to flower culture, and find no time even to study
the various catalogues scattered broadcast, as sure precursors of spring
as are the falling leaves of autumn. Therefore you who have your floral
papers, your bay windows filled with plants, or your fine
conservatories, whether a farmer's wife or not, this is not written for
you, and you need not read any further.

There are many farmers' wives who give little attention to the
cultivation of flowers. Busy lives the most of them lead, and their
indoor work shuts them off largely from the enjoyment of those beauties
nature has so lavishly spread around them. It is a pity that any of them
should say, "I have no time to waste over flowers; they bring neither
food nor clothing."

Call that wasted time when tired, nervous, fretful perhaps, you leave
the heated rooms and run out to see if the seeds you sowed last week
have come up, or how the seedlings you set out are thriving? To look at
that opening rosebud, pick off the withered leaves from the geranium,
stir the earth a bit around that heliotrope, and linger over the dear
little pansies as their bright faces are up-turned to greet you and
cheer you with their diversified beauty? Gather a few; they will bloom
all the more because of it. There, now, don't you feel nicely rested?
The feeling of fretfulness is all gone. Refreshed in body and mind, you
resume your housework, and accomplish it much more effectively than if
you had kept right on, so tired and all out of sorts. Better far these
moments of out-door recreation than blue pill or bitters. All this is
anticipatory of the "good time coming" to you this summer. That kind
husband of yours when he goes to the store to buy his garden seeds, or
order them from abroad, is going to include an equal number of flower
seeds. He would have done it long ago but he did not think anything
about it. But you are going to give him a hint this spring. You can tell
him that in the general seed box there is one corner where are certain
dainty little packages labeled Candytuft--purple, carmine, white or
mixed; Mignonnette, Aster, Balsam, Pink, Petunia, Sweet Peas, etc.,
etc., and you tell him that those Sweet Peas bloom the most fragrant
blossoms for five months, while his "Extra Early," whether "Blue Peter"
or "Blue Tom Thumb," last only a little while. So as he goes on his way
he will think to himself, "Wife works hard; she makes capital butter and
keeps the house real tidy, and I guess I must indulge her." When he
returns home he gives you those little packages, in each tiny brown seed
of which there lies hidden a beautiful life--a life that shall, by
loving care, develop "the red, white and blue" in settings of emerald,
the influence of which shall be felt by the entire household, and bring
forth a fruitage of brightness, gladness and love.

It may be that you live remote from the village store, or perhaps there
may not be kept there a good, reliable assortment of flower seeds, so I
will tell you what to do in that case, for I wish to be helpful every
step of the way. You must send to some good florist for what you want,
enclosing stamps, if for an amount less than one dollar. You have your
seeds now, and some of them need to be started in the house in order to
secure early flowers, Asters, Petunias, Pinks, Pansies, Snapdragon and
Sweet Peas. Sift your earth through a coarse sieve. A little sharp sand
is good to mix with it. Shallow boxes are best, except for the peas. I
use cigar boxes. Dampen the earth, then sow thickly in rows, cover
lightly with more soil, dampen again, label, cover with paper so that
the moisture may not evaporate rapidly, and place in a sunny window.
Daily sprinkle through a fine rose pot, or with your fingers lightly if
you have none. However good your seeds may be, they will not grow if
kept dry, and will rot if kept too wet. The seedlings must be nursed
with care, not too much sun while tender. I do not thin out mine till I
transplant to the border, but many do, potting them singly. Peas can be
set out earliest of any. Sunny days in May often tempt one to bed out
their tender plants, and sow seed in open ground; then come cold nights,
when the fragile seedlings need a hot soapstone to their feet. It is
best to wait till warm weather is fully established, and then choose a
cloudy day for the work. Protect from the sun's rays till the plants are
established in their new quarters. Now, all this looks like much work
and care, I know, but it is only a little work, a little care each day,
and it is a work that will be a restful change, and bring you better
health and better feelings, and when you gather the lovely flowers from
the seeds you have sown and cultured, you will not say: "My time was all
misspent."




A Talk About "The Wild Garden."

    The lengthened days have come,
    The busiest of the year--


When the annual house cleaning treads heavily on the toes of spring
gardening, and one feels tempted to crowd the work of two days into one,
though sufficient for the present is the work thereof. The bright warm
days draw one forth to spend "an hour or two" they say, and they mean it
too--with shovel or spade in hand to prepare the flower beds, but the
air is so refreshing, and there is so much to be done, that they keep on
"a little while longer," "just a few minutes more," till Sol pours his
burning rays down upon them with the unmistakable assurance that it is
near the hour of noon.

These are the days that try men's souls, and women's, too; days when one
wishes with Dudley Warner for a "cast iron back," but would fain add the
improvement of rubber hinges; days when the inquiry is often provoked,
"Will it pay?"

As we change the numerous boxes of seedlings from one position to
another, that they may catch the sunbeams, "Will it pay?" As we take
them out of doors these warm days, and bring them all back again at
night, lest the air prove too harsh for the tender things, "Will it
pay?"

Yes, we know from past experience that it will pay even a hundred fold
for all our care when the restful days shall come, and we watch with
hopeful hearts each bud of promise as it grows, and gather our hands
full of lovely flowers, the fruitage of our seed sowing and unceasing
care.

Have been bedding out to-day my old stocky geraniums, after cutting off
all the dead and unsightly branches. These were just packed into large
boxes in the autumn--as closely as possible--dirt then thrown in to fill
up the spaces, and they were put into the cellar and severely let alone
till the weather admitted of their being taken out of doors.

Many throw away their geraniums, if the stalks decay by being
frost-bitten or for some other cause, when often the roots are alive,
and with proper care will sprout again. I had a few in my window box
that were touched by frost one intense cold night in December, and died
down to the roots. To my surprise, they sprouted in March, for I did not
suppose they would be seemingly lifeless so long in a sunny window.

Some of my neighbors hang up their large geraniums by the roots in the
cellar, and thus keep them throughout the winter nicely, but I have
never been successful with this method.

My house plants are nearly all re-potted, ready to be plunged into the
ground the first of June. I put in a bit of potsherd to keep the roots
from going astray, then small pieces of coal for drainage, then fill
with mellow sifted soil, enriched with well-rotted manure. I found it so
much better last year to bed out in pots that I shall practice it more
fully this summer. When the time comes in the autumn for taking them in
doors, the work can be done in half the time.

My seedlings will be six weeks or more in advance than those sown in the
open border. My sweet peas must go out very soon or I shall have to give
them a support, they are so tall.

Now I am going to tell you about another sort of a garden--"a spick-span
new" sort--and I know you will be pleased to hear about it, and I think
you will want to have one of your own.



Mr. B. K. Bliss, of New York, in a note, said: "We have put into your
box a packet of flower seeds for the wild garden, which we think will
interest you. We also send you the initial number of our new paper,
"_The American Garden_." In this journal I find a very interesting
article on "The Wild Garden," how to make it, and a description of one
at the country residence of Mr. M. S. Beach, near Peekskill, from his
own pen. We will quote a part of it. He says: "We plowed a strip about
six feet wide all around a five-acre field, close to the fence. On this
plowed ground, the seed, previously well mixed, was thrown just as it
happened to come. The surface having afterwards been well smoothed over,
we waited the result. This proved satisfactory. We had a wild garden
indeed. The plants came up as thickly as they could grow, and flourished
and blossomed as freely as though they had enjoyed all the care usually
given to hot-house exotics.

"Sweet Alyssum, Mignonnette, the pretty blue Nemophila and bright
colored Phlox Drummondii seemed to cover the ground. Morning Glories of
every shade and delicate Cypress vines tried to cover the fences and run
up every tree. Quaint little yellow and green Gourds appeared in the
most unexpected places, and the whole bed seemed to be ablaze with the
orange and yellow of the Eschscholtzia, Marigolds, Calendula Officinalis
and Zinnias. One of the chief charms of this wild flower bed was the
variety and change--not from season to season, but from day to day.
Every morning would find some new, unexpected, and previously forgotten
flower in bloom."

The packet of Flower Seeds for the "Wild Garden" consists of more than a
hundred varieties, sufficient for a square rod of ground. There must
needs be a peculiar charm in the "Wild Garden." When one wearies of the
monotonous ribbon beds and geometrical designs so long in fashion, they
can turn to the spot where flowers run riot at their own sweet will, and
give daily surprises because sown broadcast without any regard to their
names and location. Multitudes there are, who, with abundance of land
at their command, can have one on a large scale, others can have, but a
small spot. There are many who have ground specially adapted by its
wildness for the blending of the cultivated flowers with those which
grow in their native dells or woods. Wild shrubs, wild flowers, wild
climbers, can be transplanted to situations quite like their own. There
can be ferneries and rockeries, beds of violets and wild evergreens, and
combined with careless grace, such tropical plants and brilliant annuals
as would give the most pleasing effect and afford a beauty wholly
unique.




Make Home Beautiful.

    Make your home beautiful--bring to it flowers;
      Plant them around you to bud and to bloom;
    Let them give light to your loneliest hours--
      Let them bring light to enliven your gloom;
    If you can do so, O make it an Eden
      Of beauty and gladness almost divine;
    'Twill teach you to long for that home you are needing,
      The earth robed in beauty beyond this dark clime.




A Talk About Stocking the Garden.

    "The flowers we love?--They are those we gathered
      Years ago, when we played at home!
    Flowers by the door stone, dropped and scattered
      Here and there as a child would roam."


"How shall I stock my garden?" is a question often asked by amateurs.
That depends very much on the size, location and soil of the ground to
be furnished. If the site is elaborate, and the beds to be geometrically
laid out, much skill, artistic taste and generous expenditure is needful
to produce a fine effect. If the flower beds are cut in the lawn a
different classification and arrangement of plants will be needful. If
they consist of long beds bordering a walk, or one bed only, beneath the
front window, there needs to be a grouping of flowers adapted to the
situation. None but the "wild garden" ought to be stocked hap-hazard
style. Arrange always so that there shall be a succession of flowers
during the entire season, for if you devote a space for those of brief
duration, you will by and by have a barren spot by no means pleasing.
The most exposed situations ought, of course, to be arranged with
special reference to the best possible effects or continuity of bloom
and harmony of colors. Don't mix in all sorts of colors and sizes of
plants in any bed. Masses of distinctive colors always have a fine
effect. Where there are varieties that have more show of flowers than of
leaves, it is well to intersperse plants whose beauty lies more in their
foliage than in blossoms.

The beautiful Coleuses, Achyranthes and Alternanthera, with their richly
colored leaves, and Pyrethrums with their vivid green lancelated
foliage, are very effective for this purpose. Cannas are very fine among
tall, free blooming plants, particularly for centers. Care ought always
to be had in selections, so that a tall and coarse plant shall never
have for its surroundings the low and delicate growers. Imagine the
effect of a gorgeous California Sunflower or a towering Hollyhock in the
midst of a bed of Pansies, or Tea Roses, or a Dahlia in a bed of
Verbenas! Have your large stocky plants in a bed by themselves, unless
it be as a background border for the more delicate flowers. A long bed
running beside a fence, or one beneath the windows of a dwelling-house,
can have, with good effect, a dense background of shrubs or Pompone
Dahlias, or even the taller Dahlias, if relieved by a fence. Where there
is a large bed directly beneath the front windows, a good arrangement is
to have, first, trailing vines that shall cover far up the sides of the
dwelling. For this, the Ipomoeas are very appropriate; of these there
are numerous varieties. _I. Bona Nox_, with its large fragrant blossoms,
which however, expand in the evening; Mexicana _Grandiflora Alba_,
immense flowers of white, long tube, a native of Mexico; grows to the
height of ten feet. _I. Hederacea Superba_ is bright blue, with white
margin, Ivy-like foliage, and _I. Fol Mormoratis_, a new Japanese
variety, with foliage beautifully mottled and marbled with white;
_Coccinea_, or "Star" Ipomea, bears a great profusion of small flowers,
scarlet striped with white. With any of these, vines of the Canary Bird
Flower intermingled, would have a superb effect; the light green, deeply
lacinated leaves and bright, yellow fringed flowers, proving a marked
contrast to the foliage and blossoms of the Ipomea. It is a very rapid
grower, and will climb and branch out ten feet or more. In front of
these climbers, or whatever others may be preferred, a row of Sweet
Peas, quite thickly set, can be trained so as to fully cover the vines
below the flowering branches, and to conceal the unsightliness of these
low down, a row of Pyrethrums or some dwarf compact plants would be
attractive. Then a walk, if the bed is sufficiently wide. The plants on
the opposite side can be arranged so as to have those of medium height
next to the path, and low bedding ones for the foreground. Verbenas are
very fine for this, and so is the Double Portulaca. For an edging, many
things are appropriate; whether one desires merely a low green, or a
border of dwarf blooming plants. For the latter, we know of nothing
prettier than the new dwarf Candytuft, Tom Thumb. Its habit is low and
bushy, and its clusters of white blossoms continue a very long time.

Mr. Vick has for several years recommended Thrift as the best edging
plant for northern climates. It is easily propagated from cuttings;
every piece will make a plant, if taken in the fall or spring, and is
perfectly hardy. It bears tiny clusters of pink flowers, and the foliage
is fine for floral work.

In arranging your garden stock study the adaptions of your plants to
certain positions. Some require for their best development, a great deal
of sunshine, others require somewhat sheltered positions. Portulacas
revel in dry and sunny spots, laughing at drought, while Pansies love a
cool and moist situation, therefore to bed them in a sandy soil, and a
position where they would be exposed to the intense sunshine of mid-day,
and the Portulaca in the sheltered, moist situation would be a great
mistake.

Coleuses ought not to be set in a very open sunny place, but with plants
that will serve as a protection somewhat, or they will lose their vivid
markings. We observed this first with C. Shah; when exposed to a strong
light, the rich, velvety maroon changed to a dull color hue, but when
partially shaded it was of a very deep, rich color. The next summer we
had the beautiful Pictus, and its leaves looked as though they were
indeed painted with yellow, brown and green, but exposed for a time to
the direct sunshine nearly all day, it changed to a dark green, with
brown markings, and, robbed of its gold, it possessed no special beauty.
We speak only of our own experience, which has not been limited by any
means to these two varieties. We have had a few that would retain their
distinctive markings well, even in quite an exposed situation.

In the arrangement of your garden, have it adapted to its surroundings.
The broad leaved Palms, the Tropical Caladiums, the stately Cannas, the
Cape Jessamine and Crape Myrtle are in perfect harmony with the well
kept lawn and stately mansion, but quite out of place in the simple
border of a vegetable garden, or rough grass-plot belonging to a low,
plain cottage.

I will tell you of a bit of a garden furnished in harmony with its
surroundings. It was rudely dug and roughly finished by two very small
hands. It was a very wee bed, indeed. It was fenced on the west side by
a rough board shed; on the north by an old stump; the other side and end
had no protection. Without any method of arrangement, or reference to
artistic effects, here was massed the following assortment: Monks Hood,
Bachelors Buttons, Butter and Eggs, Star of Bethlehem, Poppies and
Marigolds; these last more odorous than fragrant. Old fashioned flowers
truly. But they harmonized with their surroundings, and the little pale
faced child thought them very beautiful.

It is not essential to harmony however, that the flower bed be rudely
prepared, though the cot be lowly and its surroundings rough; the
garden, however small, can be neatly prepared, provided there are
stronger and older hands than those of the little maid referred to, and
there may be a display of taste in the arrangement of the most common
flowers, in our day at least, where beautiful varieties are within reach
of all. But it was not so fifty years ago; boxes of flower seeds were
not to be found in the shops; catalogues were not scattered broadcast
like autumn leaves and as free; "a greenhouse at your door," was not
then, as now, a verity. School girls exchanged their limited floral
treasures, and now and then a slip could be begged from the fortunate
possessor of a few house plants. But if greenhouse flowers were rare,
there were thousands in the meadows, on the hills, in the woods; the
sweet May flowers, unknown then to the little maiden as the Trailing
Arbutus, the Anemone, Hepatica, Columbine, Violets of different hues,
Wild Roses, Gay Lilies, and late in autumn, the lovely fringed Gentian:

    "Each chalice molded in divinest grace,
      Each brimmed with pure, intense and perfect blue."

What could be more lovely among the garnered treasures of the
greenhouse? But our talk is a long one, and we will defer to another
what we have further to say on this subject.




The Phlox Drummondii.

    "Flowers for gladness and flowers for sorrow,
      Shadowing forth what we fail to tell;
    Mystic symbols of tender meanings,
      Such as the heart interprets well."


This is one of the most desirable of our annuals, coming into bloom
early in the season and continuing in flower till frost. They are very
effective in massed colors, and make fine ribbon beds. Contrasting
shades should be selected. A writer in the _Garden_ says that the
following are very desirable for this purpose: "Phlox Lothair, salmon
shaded with violet; Mons Henrique, brilliant reddish crimson; Venus,
pure white; Mons Goldenschugh, rosy violet; Spenceri, dark rosy lilac.
An excellent front edging for this ribbon bed is the variegated
Periwinkle. In order to grow them thoroughly well, and so to insure a
lengthened period of blooming, the ground should be deeply trenched and
well enriched with good manure from the farm yard, and not more than six
heads of bloom should be allowed to each plant. Thus treated, when
planted in long lines, it is difficult to convey an impression of these
and similar varieties."

There are many beautiful varieties of color; deep blood purple,
brilliant scarlet, large blue with white eye, not truly a blue, but the
nearest approach to it of any; Leopoldii, splendid deep pink, with white
eye; Carmine Queen and Violet with a large white eye; Vick's _New Double
White_, the only one that is reliable, from seed, to produce double
flowers. Then there are the buffs and the stripes, crimson striped with
white, and rose and purple. Mr. Vick, who makes a specialty of the
Drummondii Phlox, they being a favorite with him, devotes acres to their
cultivation, and who has been experimenting with them for several
years, has produced several new sorts that are very fine; one of them is
deep red with a fringed edge. There have been very marked improvements
since this plant was first discovered in Texas by Mr. Drummond, a
botanical collector sent out by the Glasgow Botanical Society, and it
was one of the last, if not the very last, sent to Europe by him. He
soon after went to Cuba, where he died of a fever in the prime of life.
Sir N. J. Hooker named the plant after its discoverer as a memento. When
first discovered it was very inferior to the flowers seen in our
gardens, as is very apparent from an engraving of it taken from a
drawing in Mr. Vick's possession, which was made in 1838, three years
after its discovery. It is given in _Vick's Magazine_ for September,
1880, with the items we have cited. The word Phlox signifies flame, and
is supposed to have been applied in allusion to the flame-like form of
the bud.

A lady who had excellent success with her seedlings, started early in a
box, and bedded out one cloudy day in May, says: "I was surprised to
find flowers on the plants when so young and small. I don't believe they
had been transplanted five days before half of them had flowers, and
soon the rest followed, and for more than two months my bed has been
glorious--a mass of bright colors more beautiful than any carpet or
dress pattern ever made. It is near the middle of September, and if the
frost will only keep away, it looks as though they would keep on
flowering for years. Tell everybody to have a Phlox bed and how to do
it. It is the cheapest pleasure possible."

                                      CARRIE, in _Vick's Magazine_.


VERBENAS.

This we must have, for it is one of the most beautiful annuals
cultivated. So varied its hues! So abundant its blooms! Not a brief
season of flowering, and then naught but leaves, which are, not of
themselves attractive, but an increase of blossoms from June till
October, and it requires quite a severe frost to mar their beauty. They
have the best effect massing each color by itself, and beds of a
circular form cut in the lawn and filled with Verbenas, have a superb
effect. Seedlings are much the best for bedding out, they are so much
stronger and more bushy. Those plants offered for sale in pots, having
one tall slender stem, crowned with a cluster of flowers, are almost
worthless for the garden. True, if you get a healthy one, by layering
and pegging down, you can sometimes get good plants, but you had better
purchase seedlings by the dozen as they are offered in boxes and
baskets, or order them of the florist by mail or express, and you will
have plants that will grow compact, bloom early and profusely, with far
better foliage than the puny straggling ones rooted from cuttings. One
objection to purchasing seedlings by the clump is, I am well aware, the
fact that they are not labeled as to color, and everybody wants to know
that they will have at least one scarlet, one white, purple, and so on,
and unless the color is peeping through the bud, one must buy with the
risk of not knowing the desired color. This is the true state of the
case so far as my own observation extends. But it need not be so, and we
presume it is not so everywhere. Seedlings can be raised of course with
each of the leading colors separate, and those in greatest demand in
large quantities to meet the wants of the general public, while the
fancy sorts can be of mixed varieties. Those who raise their own
seedlings, usually buy a paper of mixed sorts, so in that case they are
no better off than those who purchase seedlings of the florist, and as
their facilities are far greater for raising early plants, it seems
preferable as a general thing, to buy of them, for these reasons. In
order to have good sizable plants for bedding out in May and June that
will bloom in August, seed must be sown the first of March, at the
latest, for it takes weeks for the little dry sticks to germinate, and
then they are such slow growers, unless under the most favorable
circumstances, they do not become strong vigorous plants by the time
you want to bed them out. Few can care for them properly while their
sunny windows are full of choice house plants, so that as a rule, we
should deem it preferable to wait until May, and then purchase the large
budded seedlings, which so quickly unfold their beautiful flowers to
brighten the garden, when it is almost barren of bloom. They do not cost
usually more than sixty cents per dozen, and one is saved from so much
care.

However, for the benefit of those who prefer to sow their own seed, we
will give directions for the best method. First, be sure that the seed
is new. Don't sow old seed for it will not germinate. If you have no hot
bed, make one in a box or pan by putting in a layer of quite fresh horse
manure for bottom heat; over this a layer of coarse sand; then fill the
box with finely sifted soil, mixed with at least one-third fine sand.
Make it smooth; then in little rows drop the seeds, not very sparsely,
for all may not germinate, and if too thick when they come up they can
be thinned out. Press the seed down with a bit of flat board, sift a
little soil over them and then dampen by light spraying with tepid
water; a brush dipped in water makes a gentle sprayer. Cover with paper,
glass, or what is better, a bit of soft flannel wrung out of water laid
on the surface, as it keeps the soil damp without sprinkling, by being
wet as it dries. The soil must be kept moist, not soaking wet, for
however helpful to germination a previous soaking may be, when sown the
seed must not be drenched, and the same rules are equally applicable to
the seedlings, for in either case rot would surely follow. It is just
here where the special care is requisite to insure success. After the
plants have come up, the flannel or paper must be removed and the
seedlings given sunshine and air, though it is well to have a glass over
the top of the box for a week or more, as more moisture is thereby
secured; but there ought to be an aperture for the admission of air.
When two or more leaves are developed, it is well to prick them out into
other boxes or pots, if they are too thick for free growth; not all, a
part can remain undisturbed. They should be gradually hardened as a
preparation for out-door life, by being placed in cool situations. While
heat is essential to start the seed into growth, it is not beneficial to
the plants, and those who have a cold frame had better remove the plants
to it as soon as the temperature will admit.

In bedding out, an open situation is preferable. The ground should be
well dug and enriched, with well-decomposed manure, and if the soil is
heavy a liberal mixture of sand. A situation where the morning sun will
not strike them before the dew is off in the morning is best, as this is
one cause of the mildew or rust which so frequently saps the vitality of
the leaves. In order to promote their spreading, it is a good plan to
fasten down some of the branches when sufficiently flexible to the
ground, and for this, nothing is more convenient than hair-pins. All the
seed vessels should be pricked off in order to secure the best results,
as much of the strength of the plant goes to them if allowed to remain.
One can afford to be very liberal in gathering the flowers, for the more
liberally they are picked off, the more rapidly buds form and develop.
As it was with one of Bunyan's characters:

    "There was a man (though some did count him mad),
    The more he cast away, the more he had."

The wise man says: "There is that scattereth and yet increaseth."

A florist says that "to grow Verbenas successfully, plant them in beds
cut in the turf. Chop the turf well and thoroughly mix with it a good
share of well-decomposed stable manure; never, on any account plant them
in old and worn-out garden soil as they will most assuredly fail. Give
them a change of soil each season, as they do not thrive well two years
in the same bed."

As a house plant the Verbena is not a success. It is most always sickly,
and infested with red spiders. They cannot be kept over winter in a
cellar; it is growth or death.

Verbenas were first introduced into Europe about fifty years ago from
South America, and a few years later into this country. They have been
greatly improved, and the varieties are very numerous. Many are
fragrant. The only hardy sort is Montana, a native of Colorado. It is a
profuse bloomer, color, a bright rose. There are the German Hybrids, the
Italian stripes, and the Drummondii from Texas. Every year brings its
novelties, as with other flowers. Mr. C. E. Allen, who makes a specialty
of seedling Verbenas, is sending out several fine ones this season;
Silver Queen, Florence, Emma, Carroll, Ralph and Variegata are very
attractive according to the descriptions.




Few things in the garden will make more show throughout the entire
season, even after quite severe frosts, than a bed of Petunias from a
paper of seed marked "Choicest Mixed from Show Flowers." They will
produce such a profusion of flowers, charming one from day to day with
their variations of markings, and of color. Some retain their
distinctive characteristics, while with others they are changeful as the
Kaleidoscope. Stripes, blotches, sprays, white throats, green edges,
they are just lovely. Then there are the double sorts; purple with white
spots, white with purple; rose color, white, purplish-crimson margined
with white; lilac veined with purple; white with stripes of purple in
the center of each petal, some exquisitely fringed; large and full as a
rose, and some almost as sweet.

In nothing, perhaps, has there been such a wonderful improvement by
culture and hybridising as the Petunia. Mr. Vick tells us how that half
a century ago, he saw for the first time, a Petunia. It was a novelty--a
strange flower from a flowery land, South America, and it was carefully
treated in green-houses. The flower was white and small, and looked
somewhat as if made of paper--such a flower as would now be destroyed if
by chance seen growing accidentally in our gardens. The novelty soon
subsided, and although it was ascertained that it could be grown in
gardens, it did not possess sufficient merit to gain popular favor. A
little later, however, about 1831, to the astonishment of the floral
world, it was announced that a new Petunia, of a purple color, had been
discovered in Buenos Ayres. It was first flowered and seeded in the
Botanic Gardens of Glasgow, and thence seed was sent all over Europe and
to America, where it soon became a great favorite. About thirty years
ago a double Petunia was grown and propagated by cuttings. It was only
semi-double and white, but it was the commencement of a new era in
Petunia culture. Truly wonderful have been the advances in development
of this beautiful flower.

The Petunia is divided into three distinct classes, the Grandiflora,
Small Flowered and Double.

The Grandiflora varieties have a strong succulent growth, the flowers
are not so numerous as some others, but are very large and double,
frequently measuring three inches in diameter, and some kinds are
exquisitely marked with various shades of violet, purple, maroon and
scarlet upon white ground; some striped, others bordered, some marbled,
some deeply fringed. The double Petunia gives no seed, and it is only by
fertilizing single flowers with the pollen of the double that seed can
be obtained. But Petunias of all kinds are easily multiplied by
cuttings.

The Small Flowered class are those that make our gardens so attractive
with their varied hues and markings. Some of the new hybrids are of
wonderful beauty. Last year gave two of the Double and Fringed sort that
have been frequently noted as gems of the first water.

Mrs. Edward Roby, color, a glowing crimson-maroon, edged with pure
white, very double and deeply fringed. Model of Perfection, deep maroon,
heavily edged with white, and deeply fringed. These were priced last
year in a Western catalogue at $1.50 each; this year they are priced at
30 cents. So one gains by waiting a year for high-priced novelties.

New Double Fringed Petunia for 1881, is President Garfield, which
originated with Mr. C. E. Allen, and is thus described in his catalogue:
"Color, light purple veined with deep purple magenta, edged with a broad
band of an exquisite shade of green. Very novel in its appearance and a
new color in double petunias; flower very large and deeply fringed.
Plants strong and vigorous; one of the finest sorts ever offered." For a
Petunia so unique as this, with its broad band of green, and now offered
for the first time; its price, 75 cents, is low.




Pansies.

    "Open your eyes, my Pansies sweet,
        Open your eyes for me,
    Driving away with face so true,
    The chilling wind and wintry hue,
        That lingers so drearily.

    "Open your eyes, my Pansies sweet,
        Open your eyes for me.
    Where did you get that purple hue?
    Did a cloudlet smile as you came through?
    Did a little sunbeam bold
    Kiss on your lips that tint of gold?
        Tell me the mystery.

    "In your eyes a story I read--
        A story of constancy.
    After the storms and winter's wind,
    Softly you come with influence kind;
    Then as I bend with listening ear,
    Your cheerful voice I plainly hear,
        Preaching a sermon to me.

    "So, whisper to me, my Pansies sweet--
        Tell me in rustlings low,
    Of that beautiful land where fadeless flowers
    Brightly bloom in immortal bowers,
        And no blighting wind doth blow.

    "Tell of the care that is over all--
        That gives you your garments gay;
    Whose loving hand clothes the floweret small
    That grows in the field, or by the garden wall,
        Whose life is only a day.

    "Yes, tell of the love, my Pansies sweet,
        Of the love that knows no end;
    That through earth's winter safely keeps
    Watch over his children, and never sleeps;
    The love that paints the violet blue,
    And quenches your thirst with drops of dew,
        The weary heart's faithful friend."




A Talk About Pansies.

    "Pray you love, remember,
    There's Pansies--that's for thought."

                           _Shakespeare._


I find my Pansies are coming up finely. My bed of Pansies last year from
"choicest mixed seed" sown in April, began to bloom in June, and
afforded me so much pleasure with their varied beauty, that I resolved
this year to have a great many of them. I see, now that the snow has
melted from the bed, that the plants have wintered well. I had all of
the colors shown in the chromo plate of my catalogue, excepting _Emperor
William_, dark blue. I think that somebody else must have got him, for
my packet of seed was divided and sub-divided. _King of the Blacks_ was
rightly named, a mere dot of yellow in the center, and _Pure White_ was
in striking contrast, while _Pure Yellow_ was golden, and _Odier_ was
splendid with its dark center banded with yellow and scarlet. Then there
was copper-colored and striped, and such rich purples with a dot of
yellow. How lovely they were! They were not very large at first, but in
August after a rain, I had superb specimens. They were bedded beneath a
fruit tree, where they were sheltered from the noonday glare. They
thrive best in a moist, partially shaded situation. The blossoms ought
to be picked as they fade, for if left to seed the strength is taken
from the plants and the blossoms are smaller.

This season I have sown musical Pansies. "Musical Pansies! what are
they? What sort of music do they make? Will it be of the Brass Band
order, or that of the hand-organ style?"

No, no! Not that coarse, harsh, loud sort at all. If you could hear
their low, sweet notes, you would be enraptured. But this cannot be. I
call them musical, because named for the great composers, Mozart,
Handel, Schiller, Goethe, Beethoven, Haydn, Mendelssohn, and Schumann.
They are the "New German Pansies," of which types are given in oil
colors, in the catalogue of B. F. Bliss & Sons, and represent the most
beautiful strains I have ever seen. They are no fancy sketch, but drawn
as true to life in color and size as it was possible to make them, if we
will accept the testimony of Dr. Thurber in the _American
Agriculturist_. He says, that "no doubt many who have seen the colored
plate published by Messrs. B. F. Bliss & Sons, have supposed that the
artist had exercised his imagination both as to size and the strange
combinations of colors. So far from this being the case, the flowers
are, if anything, rather below the real size, and as to colors, it would
be impossible to conceive of any artificial colors more brilliant, or
more strongly contrasted, than they are in flowers, produced by this
remarkable strain of seeds."

In my childhood I knew nothing of the Pansy. The little Heartsease or
Ladies' Delight, as it was then called, was alone cultivated. Mr. Vick
tells us how it grew to be the fine flower now so highly prized. About
sixty years ago, a very young English lady living on the banks of the
Thames, had a little flower garden of her own, and one bed she filled
with Pansies, selecting from her father's grounds the finest she could
obtain. The gardener, seeing her interest and success, became ambitious
to try his hand, and grew plants from the finest specimens. These
attracted the attention of professional florists, and speedily the Pansy
became a popular flower. Every country gives it a pet name--Heartsease,
Fringed Violet, Trinity Flower, Butterfly flower, and Johnny-jump-up,
while the French call it _Pensée_, from which our name of Pansy is
probably derived. It means to remember or keep in mind. A floral work
published in 1732, illustrates it with a colored plate, which shows it
to have been then small like the Ladies' Delight.




For summer blooming plants sow seed in the house, in March or April.
Cigar boxes are very suitable for seed sowing. Put in a layer of coarse
sand for drainage, then one of horse manure for bottom heat. Fill with
rich, mellow earth sifted and mixed with one-third silver sand, or
finely pulverized leaf mold. Have it moist but not drenched. With a
narrow strip of board, make tiny furrows about one and a half inches
apart, and in these carefully drop the seed one by one an inch distant.
Cover slightly, and press the soil firmly, then lay a piece of old soft
flannel folded once or twice, and wrung lightly out of warm water,
carefully over the soil, which will keep it damp. Cover with glass, and
keep in a warm place. In a few days see if the covering is dry, if so
damp it again, and watch for the seedlings. When they appear, remove the
flannel, but still keep on the glass, not, however, so close as to
exclude all air. Gradually inure them to the sunlight, and as soon as
they have made four or five leaves, it is best to transplant every other
one, so that they may have room to grow. Great care is needful with
tender seedlings to keep them from damping off. If too wet, they will do
this, or if kept too shady. Good judgment is essential for success. As
the weather becomes warm, expose them at first an hour or two, to the
outdoor air, and thus prepare them for early bedding out. Being hardy
plants, living out of doors during the winter, with slight protection at
the North, they will bear transplanting sooner than many other
seedlings. A rich moist soil, and somewhat cool and shaded situation,
are best adapted for their growth. For winter flowers, sow seed the last
of August, or first of September, in a frame or boxes kept in a shady
place.



These must be included among the essential annuals for the garden. They
are one of the chief attractions of the border in the autumn, when many
flowers have passed their prime. This plant, like the Petunia, has in
skillful hands and by hybridization, developed from a very inferior
flower to one of great beauty and numerous classes, which embrace a
great many varieties. They are represented by _Dwarfs_ and by _Giants_,
ranging intermediately from five or six inches in height to two feet.
_Dwarf Bouquet_ presents a mass of flowers with scarcely a leaf, while
_Tall Chrysanthemum_ grows to the height of two feet, and the _New
Victoria_, _Giant Emperor_, _Truffant's Perfection_ and the _New
Washington_ bear immense flowers of great beauty. The last named bears
the largest flowers of any variety; sometimes they measure more than
five inches across. The _New Rose_ is of a strong habit, and the petals
of its large blossoms are finely imbricated. _Truffant's Fiery Scarlet_
and _Dwarf Fiery Scarlet_, are a novelty in color among Asters.
_Goliath_ is of a bushy form, and its flowers are very large. Fine
colors. _Victoria_ is a dwarf; snow-white, very double. The _Crown
Asters_ have white centers surrounded with various bright colors, and
are very pretty. The _Quilled Asters_ are quite distinct in character,
the petals consisting of tubes or quills with outer blossom petals
slightly reflexed. _Newest Shakespeare_ and _Diamond_ and _Meteor_ are
novelties of recent introduction, and come in numerous colors. We grew
them last year and deem them admirable.

The native country of this plant is China, hence it has been called
frequently China Aster. It had originally only a few rows of petals and
a large disk. It was first discovered about a century and a half ago, by
a missionary, and sent to Europe. It was first cultivated in France, and
the French florists have done the most toward perfecting the
flat-petaled Aster, and this style of flower is known as the French
Aster. On the other hand the Germans have sought to produce fine flowers
with tubular petals, and the quilled are therefore called German Asters.
Within a few years, however, the Germans have rivaled the French in
originating superior varieties of the flat-petaled style.

When first cultivated in France it was called _Reine Marguerite_,
meaning Queen Daisy; afterward in England it was called _China Aster_,
which means China Star.

Asters require a rich, deep soil. Twelve inches apart is a very good
distance for the large varieties, the dwarf can be set about six inches,
or even less will do. The tall kinds need to be staked, or they are
liable to be blown down, or prostrated by heavy rains. Do not tie one
string around the entire plant, but use several, and confine a few
branches with each, so that, while having sufficient support, they may
retain their natural position.





Have been sowing my Balsams to-day in a box, so as to have nice
seedlings to bed out in six weeks from now. My Balsams last year were
superior to any I had seen, but Mr. J. L. Childs, who rather prides
himself on his plants, has sent me several packages for trial. He says:
"My stock of Balsams is undoubtedly the finest in the world; all who saw
them flowering the past season were astonished at their size and
magnificence. The new variety (Child's Camellia Flowered Perfection), is
indeed a great acquisition; its flowers are of gigantic size, and so
double and perfect that they resemble small Camellias; it is also a very
free bloomer. I have counted five and six hundred perfect flowers upon a
plant at the same time." That is a wonderful yield, truly; I cannot
expect so many, but half that number would satisfy me. The Camellia
Flowered Perfection comes in nine colors; pink, scarlet, striped white
and purple, mottled, white and delicate pink, magenta spotted with
white, crimson spotted with white, purple spotted with white, pure
white, and rose-flowered perfection, lavender color, buds when half
open, resemble a rosebud.

I shall sow some of the seeds in June, for autumn blooming, and shall
try more fully than last year the pruning method. This is done by
removing all of the branches, and then the main stock will grow two or
three feet in height, and be a perfect wreath of blossoms. Another
method is to remove the leader and let two or three branches remain. The
flowers are larger, and the plant handsomer than when allowed to grow at
its own sweet will. They do best in a light, rich soil, and a liberal
supply of liquid manure will greatly advance their growth. A writer in
the _Gardener's Chronicle_ says: "Considering the very effective display
that these plants make when associated with stately foliage plants in
sub-tropical beds, I think they are worthy of more extended cultivation.
There are few plants better adapted for the above purpose than the
Balsam, being easily raised from seed, and as is well known, they are
rapid growers if they are planted in a rich soil. Several samples of
these plants with us are now three feet through and over two feet high,
and they work admirably with such things as Castor Oils, Cannas, and the
beautifully striped Japonica. The plants referred to were planted out
early in June, and I am so pleased with their behaviour in the
sub-tropical garden, that I intend to grow them largely another year."

I know of no reason why the Balsam might not with good cultivation
thrive as well here as in England. Let us try our "level best," and see
what we can do.






My interest in this class of plants was specially awakened four years
ago by the successful cultivation of a dozen or more new varieties which
I was induced to send for by the reception of the catalogue of the
"Innisfallen Green houses," containing a more attractive list of
geraniums, and at lower prices than I had ever seen. I secured a Club by
a little effort, and thus obtained so many fine extras, that it was a
very agreeable surprise. I have since learned that very many others have
had a similar surprise.

The next spring I had a much larger assortment, and last year the
greatest variety I ever saw. I am sure that I had sixty kinds in bloom
at once. Although very small plants, as they always are when many are
ordered by mail, they throve wonderfully, and with one exception, were
all in flower in a few weeks, and kept on blooming till after removal in
the autumn.

My method of treatment is the following: On opening the boxes I find
them packed in damp moss, many closely tied together. I take off the
oiled paper, loosen the moss packed around them, and put them in a
shallow pan, in which is sufficient tepid water to cover the roots.
After an hour or two I set them in three and four inch pots, first
putting a bit of crock over the hole in the bottom of the pot, so as to
keep the roots from going astray, then some of the coarse siftings of
soil, or small bits of coal for drainage. As geraniums are not at all
fastidious about soil, I take whatever is available, mix a small
quantity of sand with it to make it friable, enriching with old manure.
I nearly fill the pot, and then make a hole in the center, set in the
plant, press the earth firmly around it, fill to the top and press down
again, water, and set the pot in a cool and shady place for several
days, then bring to the light for a few hours, gradually accustoming
them to the sunshine, until they become fully established in their new
quarters. When the weather is sufficiently warm, I plunge the pots in
the border for the summer, covering the pots entirely. I choose a cloudy
day if possible; if otherwise, I do the work late in the afternoon, so
that the intense sunshine may not at the first beat upon them. I prefer
massing these new plants by themselves, as the effect is more pleasing
than when intermixed with other kinds. The geranium bed is the most
attractive one of my garden. It is always full of bloom, and the varied
hues commingled are very attractive. I remove all decayed leaves, and
the trusses as soon as the flowers have faded. Frequently there will be
a few decayed pips marring the beauty of a fine truss, and these I
carefully remove. All of my large stock geraniums which have been
wintered two years, I set by themselves, and they furnish an abundance
of flowers for bouquets, and cuttings for new plants. Where one has a
plenty of garden room, they need not mind having several choice
geraniums of a kind. Slips will root well during the summer months, if
set in the earth near the parent stock, where they are shaded from the
direct rays of the sun. Care must be had to set the cuttings well down
in the soil, and firm the earth compactly around them. In this way one
can obtain with little care nice plants for the winter window garden,
which will be more shapely than those which have become very branchy.
Geraniums are ill growing plants unless pruned and trained with skill.
But they are so easily cultured, adapting themselves to most any
situation whether of shade or sunshine, are so hardy, and bloom so
freely, that we can but admire them though they yield no fragrant
flowers. There are many varieties of scented leaved geraniums, and these
mixed with the odorless blossoms are almost an equivalent. Then the
beautiful "Golden Bronzed Zoned" geraniums, and the "Silver Margined"
and "Tricolored," are so beautiful in foliage, while _Happy Thought_,
with its creamy yellow leaf margined with green; _Distinction_, with
deep green leaves zoned with black; Mrs. Pollock with bronze red zone
belted with bright crimson margined with golden yellow, are exceedingly
ornamental. Beside these there are many perhaps equally attractive, not
often named in the general collection. _Freak of Nature_, first sent out
last year, is an improvement on Happy Thought the center of pure white
narrowly margined with light green; flowers light scarlet; habit very
dwarf and spreading. It originated with Mr. Gray of England, and was
awarded three first class certificates.



Of the numerous classes into which geraniums are divided, few only are
given usually by florists. There are the Ornamental Foliage of which we
have cited a few examples, and the Golden Tricolors, Silver Tricolors,
Golden Bronze, Nosegay and Lilliputian Zonale; Double and single
Geraniums.

We will specify a few varieties worthy of special note, as we can
testify by personal observation. Bishop Wood, Madam Baltet, C. H.
Wagner, Madam Thibaut, Victor Hugo, Jean Dolfus, Cassimer Perier, John
Fennely, Naomi and Rose d'Amour, all double sorts. Of the single, Dr.
John Denny possesses a rare beauty, and is thus described by an English
writer: "Dr. John Denny, raised by J. Sisley, has quite set at rest the
probability of a blue or a purple, which is a positive fact, and great
honor is due to its distinguished raiser. It also possesses another
novel and distinct feature. The base of the two top petals is of a
bright crimson tinted with orange, which gives it a most striking
appearance; this, together with its immense sized trusses, free growth
and shape of blooms, renders it one of the best for pot or house
decoration, and is of great acquisition." Jean Dolfus belongs to this
purple magenta class, a double geranium, very beautiful. Also Zuleika,
which has larger pips and trusses. It is a little more striking in color
than John Denny, but both are just as lovely as a geranium can possibly
be. When Jealousy was sent out, there was much ado over it because it
was the nearest approach toward a yellow Zonal, but it was eclipsed
pretty soon by Guinea, which was an advance by a shade or two. We had
the two in proximity last summer, and though but little difference, it
was sufficiently marked to enable us to decide that Guinea for color,
size and form, was preferable. We just get settled down on that, when we
are startled by the announcement of another novelty, "New Guinea" by
name, "a great improvement on Guinea, being two shades brighter." Well,
well! we must have that, too, and see if in other respects as well as
color, it is worthy to eclipse our favorite.

Henry Cannell--this is a new geranium, originating with Mr. John Thorp
of Queens, New York, who makes a specialty of seedling geraniums, and
has sent out from his grounds many of great value, one of them Happy
Thought, so widely known. We have not tested H. Cannell, ours was sent
from Innisfallen during the winter, and has not yet bloomed, but we are
sure that it would never have received the name of the most
distinguished florist in England, if it were not a superior variety.

New Life originated with Mr. H. Cannell of Swanley England, in our
Centennial year, and he sent out the first thousand by subscription
only, at £1 each--not one sold till the thousand were engaged! When
introduced the following year to this country, stock plants were sold
for $5.00 each. Now you can purchase it at prices ranging from ten cents
to thirty. It is unique in color, being splashed, striped, and flecked
with salmon and white on an intense scarlet ground. It is sometimes
freakish, having pips with some petals salmon, others partly white and
partly scarlet, others pure scarlet. But this very freak is charming,
for with beautifully striped trusses there will be others thus sportive.
Its habit is dwarf, compact, and its dark leaves zoned with black are
very handsome. It cannot be surpassed as a free bloomer. Mr. Cannell,
when sending it out, expressed the wish that the day might come when
there would not be a cottage in the land where New Life was not found.
John Fennely, salmon striped with white, and Fairy, flaked and striped
with crimson on a bluish white ground, are very pretty. Dazzle, Harry
King, Richard Dean, and Jean Sisley are scarlet with white eye. Of
several single white geraniums in my garden, I gave decided preference
to Madame Quinet.

There is a great difference in the duration of the flowers. Victor Hugo,
a splendid geranium, retains its beautiful trusses full five weeks.
Bishop Wood is also admirable in this respect, and Jenny Dolfus and
Naomi we believe cannot be surpassed.


Of the Sweet Scented Geraniums, we have none equal to the hybrid, Mrs.
Taylor, for beauty of foliage and of flower. It is a fine grower, and
for green to mix with flowers it is admirable. Dr. Livingstone, a more
recent novelty, is very handsome and fragrant. Rose and Lemon scented
are delicious. Lady Plymouth is a variegated rose; leaves bronzy green,
fringed with creamy white, sometimes assuming a pink tinge; very
ornamental. London Blue is a very rare variety of scented geranium, of
heavy creeping growth, with large crimped or curled leaves covered
thickly with fine spines or hairs. Seldom blooms.

We have specified a goodly number, yet but a few from the many, and we
can assure you that if you have a large bed of geraniums you will
greatly admire them, and feel satisfied that you have the most effective
bedding plants, requiring the least care, and for the smallest outlay,
that you could possibly obtain. In California they grow without culture
to an enormous size. From an editor's notes we cite the following:

"A little slip of geranium planted out in the spring, had grown in the
summer to 150 branches, its stalk at its base four inches thick, and
bearing over a thousand blooms! I saw a fence fifteen feet high,
sixty-five feet long, covered with geranium vines that had clambered up
one side, and then dropped down the other, filling both sides with a
blanket of scarlet blossoms. It grows like weeds, and needs no care."

Geraniums are so hardy that one can leave them to the last in removing
from the border in autumn. Frosts that kill Dahlia tops, and many other
plants, do not harm geraniums. Some of mine, for lack of time to remove,
are exposed till late without harm. The roots have great vitality, and
when the stalk has frozen and rotted to the ground, a new growth will
start forth, sometimes in a few weeks, and sometimes not for three
months. I have had this proved by plants in my window boxes. So one need
not be in a hurry to pull up the frozen geraniums. My large stocky
plants I pack in dry goods boxes, filling in earth around the roots, and
put them in the cellar where they have little light. The pot plants,
also, are mostly put away so as to give all the available room to the
cuttings rooted in the summer, and the rare and tender plants that will
not live in a cellar. These cuttings make fine plants for bedding out in
May or June.

In the spring the large geraniums are brought up to the open air and
trimmed of their dead leaves, pruned of dead branches, and put in a
large bed with the Hybrid Perpetual Roses.







My first Begonia was a Rex. It thrived for several years, and then to my
regret died, for it was quite a favorite with me. Its large leaves with
broad silvery belt and red dots, were very handsome. This species thrive
best in a Wardian case and are of rare beauty and size, grown under such
circumstances. A cool, moist atmosphere is the best for them; they burn
and shrivel exposed to the intense sunlight. They are easily multiplied
from the leaves. Cut the leaf so that a small portion of the stem will
remain, insert this in a pan of damp sand, laying the leaf out flat upon
the sand, upper side uppermost. It can be retained in place by bits of
stone or small pegs. Cuts must then be made in a number of places so as
to sever the veins, thus checking the flow of sap. A callus then forms
at the base of each piece of vein where severed, and just above it, a
bud starts out, and thus a new plant is formed. It is essential for
success, that there should be bottom heat, and that the air should be
moist. A bell glass is the best to put over the leaf, and if there is
danger that the air become too moist, the glass can be tilted up to
allow of an escape. The leaves best adapted for propagation are those
neither very young nor very old, but healthy and vigorous; yet that this
is not absolutely essential is shown by the experience of a lady who had
excellent success with a leaf that was some what decayed around the
edges, and for that reason was cut off and thrown away. Remembering
afterward that the plant was sometimes grown from pieces of a leaf, she
hunted it up, trimmed off the decayed portion, and planted it at the
foot of a tree, about half under ground, and pressed the soil firmly
around it. A few months afterward she had a nice little plant from it,
with its beautiful leaves unfolding finely.



There are many varieties of the Rex family; some have brilliant colors
in their leaves, others are thickly covered with short hairs. These are
more difficult to manage, and require great care to preserve from dust,
as like all rough leaved plants, they do not enjoy spraying, as do
smooth leaved ones. It is well to set them out in a mild shower
occasionally. Tepid water is the best for watering.


This class are the most generally cultivated, and they embrace a great
many varieties, which are specially distinguishable by the diversity of
their leaves. Most of them are one-sided, that is, they are larger on
one side of the mid-rib than on the other. Some have fern-like foliage,
others lobated. Some have large palmate leaves, others are spotted and
laced with white. As a class they are very beautiful for their foliage,
but when to this attraction is added beauty of flowers, it will be seen
at once that they are eminently deserving of the prominent position now
given them both in the open border and the window garden.

We will name for the benefit of amateurs some of the most desirable as
given by Mr. Vick: _Fuchsioides_, with its drooping scarlet flowers, is
one of the most desirable of the whole class; the leaves are small, and
of a dark green color, and the small, delicate brilliant flowers are
produced in great profusion. As a winter blooming sort it is
indispensable. _F. Alba_ bears white flowers. _Richardsonii_, a variety
with white flowers and deeply cleft palmate leaves, requires more heat
than the former, therefore well adapted to our warm rooms. _Subpeltata
nigricans_ has large, dark purple leaves, and bears clusters of large
rosy flowers, very ornamental. _Grandiflora rosea_, with light pink
flowers, and _Sandersonii_, scarlet flowers; _Weltoniensis_, of dwarf
habit and small dark green foliage, rich pink flowers, are all fine
winter bloomers. _Argyrostigma picta_ has long, thick leaves, with white
spots. _Metallica_, an elegant plant with bronzy green foliage, and
producing an abundance of pale peach-colored flowers, is of very recent
introduction. _Louis Schwatzer_ has a beautiful marked foliage in the
style of Rex, dwarf habit. _Mons. Victor Lamoine_, leaves marbled like
lace. _Glaucophylla Scandens_ is of quite recent introduction, and the
very best of all for a hanging basket. It is of a drooping habit, and
its bright glossy leaves are very handsome. It bears large panicles of
orange salmon flowers.




This is a class of quite recent origin, and differs from the more
general varieties, in that it has bulbous roots which can be taken up
and stored during the winter like Gladioli and Gloxinia bulbs. It has
larger flowers than the other species; red, orange, yellow, with
intermediate tints. A writer in the London _Garden_ says of them:

"The bulbous Begonias, mostly of the Boliviniensis and Veitchi sections
or families, may have also a brilliant future in the flower garden.
Meanwhile, their proper place seems to be in the conservatory,
greenhouse and window garden. For such positions it is well-nigh
impossible to match the bulbous-rooted Begonias for brilliancy, grandeur
and grace, three qualities seldom combined in the same plant. The plants
are also characterized by great distinctness and freshness of style and
character."

They are both double and single. Of the single flowered, the most
important sent out last year was _Davisii_. It is a native of the Andes
of Peru. Dwarf in habit, the leaves and flowers all springing from the
root stalk. "The scapes which rise erect above an elegant bluish green
foliage, are light red; each scape bears three dazzling scarlet flowers.
The plant is of very free growth, and a profuse bloomer." _Frobelii_, a
new species from Ecuador, said to be very attractive, producing, well
above the foliage, erect branches of large brilliant scarlet flowers;
the foliage is of bright green, furnished on the under side with a thick
covering of white hairs. _White Queen_, a very elegant variety with
numerous racemes of ivory white blossoms.

Of the new double flowered, _Glorie de Nancy_ is represented as a
magnificent variety, with large very double carmine flowers, and very
floriferous. _Louis Van Houtte_, flowers large, of a crimson scarlet
color; of fine habit, and a free bloomer.

"_Comtesse Horace Choeteau_, is an inch or more in diameter, very
double, and of a delicate, soft shade of rose; the young plant in a
three-inch pot presented a number of flowers and buds, indicating a good
blooming habit. As a double flower it is remarkably fine, the petals
being well formed, pretty smoothly laid and imbricated."--_James Vick._

The soil best adapted for Begonias is turfy loam, leaf-mold, sand, and
old well-rotted manure in equal parts. When growing, they require a
liberal supply of water, applied directly to the soil.

The Begonias are natives of the tropical countries of Asia, Africa, and
America, and most of them inhabit the mountainous regions at a
considerable elevation. They were first brought to notice and introduced
into cultivation about two hundred years ago by a French naval officer,
Michel Begon, from whom they derived their name.



This bulbous plant is a native of the tropical region of South America,
and deserves a more general culture, for all the varieties of this
genus are very handsome, _magnificent_ is not too strong a term to apply
to many of them. They may be raised from seed by sowing early in spring
in a finely sifted soil of leaf mold and garden loam. But great care is
needful, and then one has to wait the following year for the flowers. It
is better to obtain the bulbs in the spring all started, then they will
bloom during the summer. Mine had several leaves, and I removed them
from the thumb pots to five-inch size, which I judged would be
sufficiently large for them. They need plenty of light and heat and
plenty of air. To prolong the flowering an occasional watering with
manure water should be given. In the autumn they must be gradually dried
off and the bulbs kept in a warm, dry place, secure from frost. They can
be potted any time from February to May. The bulb must be planted so
that its top will be level with the surface of the soil, and watered
sparingly until the leaves appear.

I will describe a few "superlatively beautiful." _Cinderella_, pure
white with pink band. _Brilliant_, bright crimson, margined with rose,
rich violet throat. _Rose d'Amour_, rose carmine, cream colored throat,
zone of cerise. _Nero_, dark purple, white throat. _Princess Royal_,
tube and edges white, throat mottled with dark blue. _Lamartine_, very
beautifully undulated, magnificent shape; white bordered rose limb,
veering to cochineal, marbled with white and elegantly veined with rose.
_Boule de Neige_, pure snowy white, an abundant bloomer. These are only
a few selections from the many, but sufficient to give you an idea of
the variety of colors.


What flower can be whiter, sweeter, and more lovely than the Tuberose?
As the flowering bulbs can be bought for ten and fifteen cents,
according to size, no one need be without this charming flower. It is a
native of the East Indies, and was introduced into Europe more than two
hundred years ago. Until recently Italy grew the tubers for Europe and
America, but it has now been discovered that American grown tuberoses
are superior in quality to the imported, and many florists of Europe now
advertise them.



"This is a bulbous root, brought to us from Italy every year. It brings
a spike of white flowers on the top of a stalk about three feet high,
and is very sweet scented. The flower buds are a little tinted with a
lake or carmine color. We raise this by planting the roots in pots of
fine earth, and plunging them in hot beds in February or March; but give
them no water till they sprout, then we have this flower in July. Or
else set the roots in a warm border under a south wall, and they will
some of them flower in August and some in September, or this month or
the next. When these blossom you may pot them and set them into the
green-house, and some will even bloom in December."

Mr. Vick, from whose magazine we quote the foregoing, gives an engraving
copied from the work, showing the character of the tuberose as it was
nearly a century and a half ago. It represents a small single flower,
that would be lightly esteemed by us.

The flower stalk is from three to five feet in height, and bears from
twenty-five to eighty blossoms. The _Pearl_ is much the finest sort.
When the bulbs are obtained from the florist they have usually several
little tubers round the large one. These ought to be taken off and
placed in rich, mellow soil to the depth of four or five inches. They
must be cared for by keeping the earth loose and watering occasionally.
Before frost they should be lifted, their tops cut away, and then kept
in a dry, warm place during the winter. The strongest ones will usually
blossom in the autumn. But summer flowering bulbs are so cheap it seems
scarcely worth the trouble.

Will Tuberoses flower the second year, is a question frequently asked,
and usually answered in the negative, even by popular florists. A writer
in an English periodical, _Gardeners' Chronicle_, gives the following
facts:

"Last year, instead of throwing away all our plants when they had done
flowering, as is, I believe, customary, I saved back twelve plants, not
picked ones, which were placed under a stage in a late vinery, where
they remained until the end of April without receiving any water to the
roots, other than what they derived from the moisture of the house, by
which time most of them had thrown up their flower-spikes, which
proceeded from young tubers, formed immediately upon the top or crown of
the old ones, and from the union of which--when the plants had received
a thorough watering, and otherwise were subject to a growing
temperature--a profusion of roots emanated, after which the plants
received a suitable shift to a small 24. The spikes of these plants,
although not so strong or fine as those produced by tubers imported last
autumn, are nevertheless good, both in spike and each individual flower,
which, moreover, expanded in the most satisfactory manner possible, so
much so, that this and other seasons I intend to save all my tuberoses
for flowering the second year, and perhaps the third. I may here remark
for the information of the uninitiated in tuberose culture, that in
potting the tubers all little bulbets or offsets should be rubbed off,
and subsequently any suckers which may appear should be removed
forthwith, otherwise failure to flower these most beautifully scented
flowers will, in all probability be the result. The plant is of
comparatively easy and simple culture, and considering the value of the
tuberose while in flower, and its great suitability for bouquet-making,
etc., the wonder is that it is not more extensively cultivated in
private establishments as well as by market gardeners."

A gentleman writes me of a new method with Tuberoses; new to him, and
he says that in a large range of horticultural reading he has never seen
it mentioned nor heard of its being used except in the instance he
cites. He says: "I have grown Tuberoses for the past ten years with
varying success, but the main difficulty has been that so long a time
has been required in rooting and stocking them that the first frost
finds a large proportion of them just budding, or not commenced to
spindle. Had tried various places, hot-bed, furnace-room and hot-house,
and all the early spring months and December, but that made no
difference; they would not start until they got ready, and I lost many
bulbs from rotting. Two years ago, a friend who had had a similar
experience surprised me by showing me plants about the first of May with
fine tops that had been planted but three weeks, and the first of June
had stalks a foot high, while my bulbs which had been planted the first
of February, did not commence to sprout until June, although they had
been in a hot-house under favorable conditions.

"Now the reason simply was this: He had taken his bulbs and not only
pulled off all the small ones attached, but had dug out with a sharp
knife all the small eyes, and had cut off the whole of the tuberous
part, leaving only the bulb proper. This I tried on one-half my bulbs,
with the result that they were nearly two months earlier than those
planted the same time, that I did not cut. Although this seems to be
rather severe treatment of the bulb, it has given such good results that
I propose to continue the practice."

My own experience is that of late blooming. Of the dozen I planted in
the border in June, five were finely budded when taken up in September,
and have since bloomed. Two others had just begun to spindle, the others
with one exception look as though they would not stalk. Next year I
purpose to try this new method.




A Talk About Gladiolus.

    "Posthumous glories, angel-like collection,
      Upraised from seed or bulb interred in earth,
    Ye are to me a type of resurrection
                      And second birth."


It was my intention to devote this entire article to "Ornamental Foliage
Plants," but I think I will have a prelude, and my prelude may have no
more connection with my "talk" proper than Mr. Cook's preludes do with
his lecture proper, and I think that frequently the first is the most
interesting and important; and from the fact that in the published
reports much more space is afforded to the prelude than the lecture, I
opine that others are of the same opinion. "The Topic of the Hour,"
whatever may be the question just then stirring the public mind, is
usually chosen as the preface. The topic of the hour to-day has been a
bit of a sermon from the text, "And to every seed its own body," and the
lesson embodied was that of Faith. The preaching came from a package of
gladiolus bulbs, just received, and it run on this wise:



Here are these dry bulbs, separately wrapped and labeled. They look
alike in color, and very nearly alike in form; some are rather more cone
shaped than others. One is larger and more flat. But there is nothing in
form nor size to show that they will not develop precisely the same form
and color of flower. I know that they will all reveal the leaf, habit of
growth, bud and bloom that distinguishes this species of plant from all
others, because I know that these are gladiolus bulbs, and every seed
hath its own body. A gladiolus bulb never yet produced a dahlia. A
tigridia or shell-flower bulb, though greatly resembling some gladiolus
bulbs, and its form of leaf is very similar, yet it never produces a bud
nor blossom like the gladiolus. The tigridia hath "its own body,"
peculiarly and exclusively its own. I have spoken thus far of
demonstrated facts--facts that have become to me a matter of personal
knowledge.

But now comes the lesson of _Faith_. I find each bulb bears a different
name. I take my catalogue and read the description against the name on
each label. Thus I am told what colors pertain to each bulb, inclosed,
shut up beyond my ken. Do I have any doubts respecting these
descriptions--that the distinguishing characteristics of each sort
before me will fail to correspond? Here is _Lord Byron_ and _Lord
Raglan_. How do I know that the former will be a brilliant scarlet,
stained and ribboned with pure white, while the latter will have salmon
colored blossoms, spotted with scarlet and blotched with dark garnet? I
do not _know_ this, for I have never seen it demonstrated, but I have an
_assured faith_ that in due time I shall behold those flowers true to
their assigned colors, and if there should be a failure I should
attribute it to the mistake of the labeler.

But why should these brown bulbs, so alike to outward view, bear flowers
so widely differing in hues? Why should _Cleopatra_ have a large flower
of soft lilac tinged with violet, and a purple feathered blotch, while
_Meteor_ is dark red with pure white stain? Why should _Nestor_ be
yellow striped with red, and _Addison_ dark amaranth, with white
stripes? Vainly would I seek by dissection to fathom the mystery of
these hidden diversified markings, but He who created this plant of
wondrous beauty gave to each "seed its own body," and thus we can plant
in faith--yea in full assurance of faith--that in due time our eyes will
behold all those varied tints now secreted in these bulbs before us.
Our seed sowing is all the work of Faith, and Hope looks beyond with
bright anticipations of the summer and autumn harvest.

The gladiolus is very easily cultured, and I have far better success in
keeping the bulbs through the winter than I have with the dahlia. The
tubers of the dahlia easily rot, on account of the dampness of the
cellar, though carefully dried and packed in sand. But the gladiolus
bulbs, without any special care, come out in fine condition. I like to
add a few new ones to my old standard stock, so as to have a variety of
colors, for few flowers make such a grand display in the flower garden,
and the spikes of bloom are admirable for bouquets, as the buds will
unfold day after day for a long time. The lower flowers on the stalk can
be removed as they fade. The flowers are very fine also for saucer or
shoal dish bouquets. I have a special liking for these. Fill the shallow
dish with water or sand--I prefer the latter kept constantly wet--then
arrange tastefully short stemmed flowers till they are a mass of bloom.
I first make a green border of geranium leaves, or some trailing vine.
Different shades of gladiolus flowers picked from the stalk are very
effective to set off the flowers not so striking. Where the season for
out-door culture is short, as it is here in Maine, it is best to get the
bulbs started in the house. Some do this by simply placing them in a
sunny window without covering. I always plant mine in a box.

The gladiolus can be raised from seed, but they are of slow growth, and
one has to wait till the third summer usually for their flowering. It is
far better to purchase the bulbs, then they bloom the first season, and,
except some of the rare sorts, multiply rapidly. Although novelties, and
some rare sorts are very expensive, $1.50, $2 and $3 for a single bulb,
yet very fine bulbs of choice colors can be obtained for that price _per
dozen_. In reply to the question, "What are the names of six of your
finest gladiolus not very expensive?" the reply is, "Calypso,
Cleopatra, Agatha, Eldorado, James Carter and Lord Byron." These six
cost but little more than $1. Of those more expensive the following are
very desirable: Addison, Eugene Scribe, Etenard, La France, Meyerbeer
and Rossini. These cost a little less than $3. Unnamed bulbs, a good
variety, can be bought for $1 per dozen of reliable florists.

Of the new varieties sent out the present season for the first time, are
the following raised during the past year by M. Souchet, M. Leomine and
other French growers, who have for years made the improvement of the
gladiolus a special study. They are said to be superior to any gladiolus
hitherto introduced. Aurore, Bremontier, Chameleon, Corinne, Dalila,
Eclair, Gulliver, Hermione, Lesseps, Tolma, Victor Jacquemont. The
descriptions represent them as superb, and they ought to be at the price
named, $4 per bulb! Some of us will have to wait till their novelty is
worn off.




_Lemoinei_ and _Marie Lemoine_. "These two varieties are Hybrids of
gladiolus purpureo-auratus, and are of the old garden varieties of
Gandavensis, and are now offered for the first time. In form they
approach the old Gladiolus Biperatus, the colors being creamy ground
with distinct markings of crimson-maroon, with lemon and salmon colored
cloudings. They have proved quite hardy and may be left out of doors
from year to year." Mr. Henry Cannell of Swanley, England, a florist of
world-wide reputation, says of those hardy Hybrids: "It is considered
both by professionals and the trade, that M. Leomine's greatest victory
was in crossing Gladiolus purpureo-auratus and gandavensis, two distinct
species, and at the time they were awarded first-class certificates, it
was thought by many that some higher and substantial recognition ought
to have been made for introducing a perfectly hardy constitution into
our glorious garden gladiolus, and saving the trouble of housing them
from frost every season."



This is a new species from Natal, quite distinct from the common species
of gladiolus and very attractive. On a slender, bending stem, which
rises to the height of three or four feet, are borne from eight to
twelve nodding flowers, somewhat bell-shaped in form, and yellow in
color, with broad purple stripes on the lower divisions within. Its
bulbs are small, and at the end of long runners numerous offsets are
produced which are more certain to flower the succeeding season than are
the old bulbs.




This ancient type is a very ordinary flower, and it seems almost
incredible that such superb varieties should have been produced
therefrom by cross-fertilization. In the hands of the French florists it
has attained to the superior position it occupies to-day. More than
forty years ago Mons. Souchet, head gardener at the Château of
Fontainebleau, first called attention to this flower, and began its
improvement, and although some few other French florists, such as
Messrs. Courant, Berger, Lamoine, Verdier and others followed his
example, yet nearly all of the varieties now in commerce in France, are
of the raising of that now venerable and respected private citizen. His
successors, Messrs. Soulliard and Brunelet supply the great French
houses of Paris, by whom the bulbs are forwarded to all parts of the
world. About thirty years ago Mr. Kelway of Longport, in Somersetshire,
began his culture and hybridizing of the flower, and has built up an
immense business. He devotes fifteen acres to Gladiolus exclusively, and
the number of seedlings annually raised is 200,000. In 1879-80, Mr.
Kelway exhibited eighteen named seedlings which were severally awarded
first-class certificates as possessing striking original
characteristics. Of our own eminently successful growers, Messrs.
Hallock and Thorp of Queens, N. Y., take the lead. They devote over
seven acres to Gladiolus, and raise thousands of seedlings.




For diversity of color and general effect, either in masses, or in beds
of three or four rows, placing the bulbs one foot apart and three inches
deep. Mix a liberal supply of well-rotted manure with the soil, and if
clayey, use sand. As soon as the plants are sufficiently tall stake
them, and mulch with dressing.


The Use of Flowers.

    God might have made the earth bring forth
      Enough for great and small,
    The oak-tree and the cedar-tree,
      Without a flower at all.
    We might have had enough, enough,
      For every want of ours,
    For luxury, medicine, and toil,
      And yet have had no flowers.

    Then wherefore, wherefore, were they made,
      All dyed with rainbow light,
    All fashioned with supremest grace,
      Upspringing day and night;--
    Springing in valleys green and low,
      And on the mountains high,
    And in the silent wilderness,
      Where no man passes by?

    Our outward life requires them not,--
      Then wherefore had they birth?--
    To minister delight to man,
      To beautify the earth;
    To comfort man,--to whisper hope,
      Whene'er his faith is dim,
    For Who so careth for the flowers,
      Will care much more for him.

                          MARY HOWITT.




A Talk About Pelargoniums.

    "And so I hold the smallest flower
      Some gracious thought may be;
    Some message of the Father's love
      Mayhap to you or me."


Here we step on disputed ground. Are Geraniums Pelargoniums? Who shall
decide when florists disagree? There are eminent names on both sides of
the question. Mr. Henry Cannell of Swanley, England, a florist who
stands in the front rank, and whose name has become so widely known in
connection with _New Life_ Geranium, of which he was the originator,
jumbles up together under the head of Pelargoniums everything we on this
side of the water class under the head of Geraniums. A veritable muddle
he makes of the matter--that is our private opinion--we whisper it to
you confidentially. Here is our yellow Zonal _Guinea_; our best scarlet
bedder, _Gen. Grant_, and _Wellington_, and _Mrs. Pollock_, and _Happy
Thought_, all called Pelargoniums, and yet are quite unlike in leaf and
flower what we Americans denominate a Pelargonium; and, to avoid
confusion, it is certainly advisable for us to adhere to our established
distinctiveness. We quote from the _Gardener's Chronicle_ of January 3d,
1880, a sensible talk on this subject, to which Mr. Cannell takes
exceptions: "Pelargoniums and Geraniums--I think it would be as well to
settle by authority the exact names of those flowers that seem to be
indiscriminately called Pelargoniums and Geraniums. Botany has been
described as the 'science of giving polysyllabic barbarian Greek names
to foreign weeds;' but while some plants, Abies Mariesii for instance,
are most carefully described, others, as Geraniums, seem to be called by
names that do not belong to them, but to quite a different flower. I
notice, both in your letter-press and advertisement, mention made of
Zonal Pelargoniums; now I should certainly decline to receive Geraniums
if I ordered Pelargoniums. I am old enough to remember that we had a
parti-colored green-house flower of a violet shape that was called a
Geranium, then came a lot of hardy-bedding-out stuff with a truss of red
flowers, all of one color, followed by _Tom Thumbs_ and _Horseshoes_
which grow nicely out of door. Then we were told that we must no longer
call those green-house plants _Geraniums_, that their right and proper
name was Pelargoniums, and that those bedding-out plants were, strictly
speaking, Geraniums. Now, however, the old name Geranium seems to be
dropped for both, and the new name Pelargonium given to both, surely
erroneously! Let us, however, have it fairly settled which is which, so
that we may clearly and distinctly know what we are talking about, and
not make mistakes either in writing or talking, in sending to shows, or
in ordering plants."--_James Richard Haig, Blair Hill, Sterling._

We will now give a part of a lecture delivered last spring before a
Pelargonium Society in London, by Shirley Hibberd, a delightful writer
on Horticulture, says Mr. Vick, from whose magazine we quote the
following:

"A Pelargonium is not a Geranium, although often so called. The true
Geraniums are for the most part herbaceous plants inhabiting the
northern hemisphere, and the Pelargoniums are for the most part shrubby
or sub-shrubby plants of the southern hemisphere. Let us for a moment
wander among the pleasant slopes of Darley dale in Derbyshire, or by the
banks of the Clyde or the Calder. We shall in either case be rewarded by
seeing vast sheets of the lovely meadow Crane's Bill, Geranium pratense,
a true Geranium, and one of the sweetest flowers in the world. In the
rocky recesses of Ashwood Dale, or on the banks of the 'bonny Doon,' we
may chance to see in high summer a profusion of the Herb Robert,
Geranium Robertianum, with pink flowers and purple leaves, a piece of
true vegetable jewelry. And, once more, I invite you to an imaginary
journey, and we will ride by rail from Furness to Whitehaven, in order
to behold on the railway bank, more especially near St. Bees, a
wonderful display of the crimson Crane's Bill, Geranium sanguineum,
which from July to September, forms solid sheets, often of a furlong in
length, of the most resplendent color. No garden coloring can even so
much as suggest the power of this plant as it appears at a few places on
the Cumberland coast; even the sheets of scarlet poppies we see on badly
cultivated corn lands are as nothing compared with these masses of one
of the most common and hardiest of our wild flowers.

"Now let us fly to the other side of the globe and alight in the
vicinity of the Cape of Good Hope, say on the vast desert of Karroo,
where there is much sand, much sunshine, and little rain. Here, in the
midst of desolation, the world is rich with flowers, for the healthy
shrub that occurs in patches, glowing with many bright hues, consists in
part of wild Pelargoniums, which often take the form of miniature
deciduous trees, although in the valleys, nearer the coast, where more
rain falls, they are evergreen bushes.

"Very different in their character are these two tribes of plants, and
they are not less different in their constitution and aspects. We may
regard the Geraniums as herbs of Europe, and the Pelargoniums as
miniature trees of Africa. When we examine the flowers, we find the fine
petals of a true Geranium of precisely the same shape and size; but the
fine petals of a Pelargonium are not so, for sometimes the topmost are
the largest, and stand apart from the rest with great dignity, like
mother and father looking down on their dutiful daughters, and in other
cases they are the smallest, suggesting that the daughters have grown
too fast and become unmanageable. The florists are doing their utmost to
obliterate the irregularity of the petals of the Pelargonium, and in
this respect to convert Pelargoniums into Geraniums, but the conversion
will not be complete until much more wonderful things are accomplished.
A Geranium has ten stamens, and a Pelargonium has only seven (perfect
ones). These numbers are not constant, but the exceptions are of no
consequence in a general statement of the case.

"When all is said that can be said about the differences and
resemblances of the several genera of Geraniaceæ, there remains only one
constant and unfailing test of a true Pelargonium, and that is the
nectariferous tube immediately below the flower, and running down one
side of the flower-stalk. If you hold the pedicel up to the light, it
may be discerned as giving an indication of a double flower-stalk, but
when dissected with a pin or the point of a knife, it is found to
proceed from the base of the largest of the green sepals, and it often
appears to form a sort of digit or point in the line of the pedicel.
When you have mastered this part of the story, you may cherish the idea
that you know something about Pelargoniums.

"The large flowered show varieties and the large-flowered single Zonals
take the lead, and they are pleasantly followed by a crowd of
ivy-leaved, double-flowered and variegated sorts that are useful and
beautiful. The Pelargonium Society has set up a severe standard of
judging, and a variety must be distinct and good to pass through the
sieve. Moreover the raising of varieties has been to a great extent
reduced to scientific principles, and we obtain as a result new
characters suggestive of the great extent of the field that still lies
open to the adventurous spirit in cross-breeding. No one in recent years
has contributed more directly toward the scientific treatment of the
subject than our own painstaking Treasurer, Dr. DENNY, of whose labors I
propose to present a hasty sketch.

"Dr. DENNY commenced the raising of Pelargoniums in the year 1866,
having in view to ascertain the influence of parentage, and thus to
establish a rule for the selection of varieties for seed-bearing
purposes. In raising varieties with variegated leaves, as also with
distinct and handsome flowers, he found the pollen parent exercised the
greatest influence on the offspring. The foundation of his strain of
circular-flowered Zonals was obtained by fertilizing the large starry
flowers of Leonidas with pollen taken from the finely formed flowers of
Lord Derby. From 1871 to the present time Dr. DENNY has sent out sixty
varieties, and he has in the same period raised and flowered, and
destroyed about 30,000. These figures show that when the selection is
severe, and nothing is allowed to pass that is not of the highest
quality, there must be 500 seedlings grown for the chance of obtaining
one worth naming."

We have devoted a good deal of space to this citation because of its
interest and value on the question at issue. Mr. Hibberd has, we think,
made the matter very clear, and conclusive it must be to the most of
minds. Pelargoniums are divided into classes, though we rarely see any
classifications of them in the catalogues.




Are comparatively a new type, and from the fact of their having more
scalloped petals, somewhat approaching a double; they retain their
petals instead of shedding them as do the single show flowers. The
Beauty of Oxton and Queen Victoria, novelties of very recent
introduction, belong to this class. We had them in bloom last year and
thought them very fine. The Beauty of Oxton has the upper petals of a
very rich maroon color, darkly blotched; under petals very dark crimson,
shaded with maroon; light center tinted with rose. All the petals are
attractively and regularly margined with white and beautifully fringed.
The flowers are large and the extra number of petals gives them the
appearance of being semi-double.

Queen Victoria is of a very novel type and marvelously beautiful. The
flowers have crispy petals, all of which are a rich vermilion in color,
broadly margined with white, and the upper ones blotched with maroon.
The "Show and Fancy Pelargoniums" have what the florists term
"blotches," i.e. large spots on the two upper petals, and "spots" which
mean the darker marks upon the center of the lower ones. The Lady of the
Lake belongs to this class. Lower petals orange-rose painted with
crimson, very dark maroon top petals with a narrow, even crimson edge,
white center. Prince Charlie is very unique in its markings. Color white
elegantly tipped, with rose-violet blotches.




This is a very handsome class of which there are many new varieties.
Princess of Wales we had last summer. It has elegant frilled petal
margins; flower trusses large size and borne in profusion well above the
foliage; ground color pure blush, each petal alike marked with a rich
dark velvet crimson-scarlet margined blotch.

Star of the East resembles the Princess of Wales in growth and profusion
of bloom, but with larger flowers, of pure white ground. The petals are
elegantly fringed, the upper ones marked with a rich crimson spot, and
the under ones elegantly penciled with violet-colored lines. These are
among the novelties of recent introduction.




A class of distinct habit, free bloomers, mostly fragrant foliage, good
for bedding out. Of these we have only had Madame Glevitsky of Bavarian
origin. Color, upper petals a fine vermilion, veined and spotted with
purple, under petals vermilion.

We were much pleased with Pelargonium Filicifolia Odorata for its finely
cut leaves of a Fern-like appearance and pleasing fragrance.

Our specimens of the various classes were from the extensive and superb
collection of Mr. John Saul, of Washington, D. C. Among them was one
which originated in his establishment and was named for his wife. It
belongs to the "Regal" class. The habit is compact and very free
flowering, producing large trusses of flowers the color of which is a
rich glowing vermilion, with light center and light margin to the
petals.

We are indebted to Mr. John G. Heinl for specimen plants of two "New
Monthly Pelargoniums," now offered for the first time to the general
public. Of the origin of one, _Fred Dorner_, we have this account given
in a letter to Mr. Heinl, from Fred Dorner, Esq., of Lafayette. Mr.
Dorner says:

"Six years ago I undertook to grow some Pelargoniums from seed. I
procured some very choice seed of Ernest Benary of Erfust. The seedlings
grew finely. About midwinter one commenced to bloom, and to my
astonishment kept on blooming for ten months, during which period it was
never without flowers. The plants grew to a good size and at one time I
counted forty-seven good-sized trusses on it. The winter and
everblooming quality, with the large and beautifully colored flowers,
makes this Pelargonium a great acquisition to the amateur as well as the
florist. I have seen here in Lafayette plants in windows blooming all
winter, and it is acknowledged here to be the best and easiest kept
house and window plant, blooming from nine to ten months in the year."

_Freddie Heinl_ originated with Mr. John G. Heinl, who says it is a
sport from _Fred Dorner_; it is lighter-colored and the flowers are
somewhat larger. That these are both a rare acquisition is evident from
the testimony of such florists as Mr. John Thorp of Queens, and Mr.
Henry A. Dreer of Philadelphia. Mr. Thorp says, "There are no
Pelargoniums equal to them and they have a decided right to be called
perpetual." Three months later he writes: "I am more than ever impressed
with their superiority over any perpetual blooming varieties, and they
must take foremost rank." Mr. Dreer says: "The Pelargoniums have proven
very satisfactory. They flowered during the greater part of the summer,
and are now full of buds."

The colored lithograph, which Mr. Heinl says is a good representation,
shows them to be very beautiful. We should think that to call a plant so
dissimilar in foliage and flower a Geranium, would be a misnomer, why
not equally such to call a Geranium a Pelargonium?



As we have seen by Mr. Hibberd's address, the Pelargonium's native home
is on arid plains where there is much sand, much sunshine and little
rain, so that they are chiefly dependent on heavy dews for moisture. To
plant them in heavy soil, give them a sheltered situation and liberal
and frequent watering, would be a mode of treatment directly the reverse
of what they require. In the cultivation of all plants we should as far
as possible adapt them to their native conditions. One skilled amateur
says his rule is to let the earth in the pots become thoroughly dry
before watering, and always to give a period of rest after blooming.
Another, a lady, said she never had any success with Pelargoniums until
she gave them a heavy period of rest after blooming. In the spring, when
putting her plants out of doors, she laid the pots containing
Pelargoniums on their sides, and let them remain perfectly dry until
fall. She then took the plants out of the pots, shook the soil from the
roots, and scrubbed them well with a hard brush and water. The
old-looking roots were cut off and the top trimmed down to six or eight
inches in height. They were then repotted in rich earth and watered very
moderately till they started into full growth, and after that more
freely. With this treatment they never fail to bloom.

A young physician who raised many extraordinarily fine varieties of
Pelargoniums from seed, in stating his mode of culture, said that _his_
practice was to re-pot large plants whenever they seemed in danger of
being pot-bound. The mold he used was made up of black earth from under
a manure heap, and a little stiff clay to retain the water. After the
plants were done flowering, they were trimmed rather close, and with
regard to probable places of sprouting. They were then placed in partial
shade, and all shoots found straying out of symmetry were pinched off.
His large plants were kept moist till after bloom, and then rather
dry.--_Floral Cabinet._

We have given these methods so that if not successful with one, another
can be adopted.






LINES ON BEING ASKED, WHENCE IS THE FLOWER?

    In May, when sea-winds pierced our solitudes,
    I found the fresh Rhodora in the woods,
    Spreading its leafless blooms in a damp nook,
    To please the desert and the sluggish brook;
    The purple petals fallen in the pool,
      Made the black waters with their beauty gay,--
    Here might the red-bird come his plumes to cool,
      And court the flower that cheapens his array.

    Rhodora! if the sages ask thee why
    This charm is wasted on the marsh and sky,
    Dear, tell them, that if eyes were made for seeing,
    Then beauty is its own cause for being.
    Why thou wert there, O rival of the Rose!
      I never thought to ask; I never knew,
    But in my simple ignorance suppose
      The selfsame Power that brought me there, brought you.

                                      RALPH WALDO EMERSON.




A Talk About Fuchsias.

A LEGEND OF THE FUCHSIA, FROM VICK'S MAGAZINE.

    A legend of this little flower,
      I heard not long ago;
    'Tis this, that when upon the cross
      The sinless Saviour died,
    And soldier with his cruel spear
      Had pierced his precious side,
    The holy drops flowed to his feet,
      Then fell upon the sod,
    When Mary knelt and wept for Him,
      Her son, and yet her God;
    An angel who was hovering near,
      Thus breathed a prayer to heaven:
    "Oh, Father, let them not be lost,
      These drops so freely given,
    But in some form of beauty still,
      Let them remain on earth,
    And here upon this rugged hill,
      Give some sweet floweret birth."
    Then, forth from the ensanguined sod,
      A Fuchsia sprang that morn,
    Rich crimson, dyed with Christian blood,
      Wrapped in his "robe of scorn,"
    Drooping in sorrow, still it bows
      Ever its graceful head;
    Shivering in the slightest breeze--
      Trembling in fear and dread;
    For the dark shadow of the cross
      Can ne'er forgotten be,
    Where all the perfume of its breath
      Was spent on Calvary.
    Yes, offering its rich fragrance there,
      As incense at His feet,
    The Fuchsia, though so beautiful,
      Can never be more sweet.




The Fuchsia was introduced into England in the latter half of the last
century by a sailor, at whose home it was discovered by Mr. James Lee, a
florist of Hammersmith, who secured the original plant by paying quite a
sum of money for it, and in addition promising to give to the sailor's
wife one of the first young plants he would succeed in raising. In a
short time he succeeded in producing several hundred nice plants, nearly
all of which were sold at a guinea each. Shortly after this a captain
Firth presented one that he had brought from Chili to the Royal Garden
at Kew. The plant was named in honor of Leonard Fuch, an eminent German
Botanist, who lived in the 16th century. The varieties in cultivation
to-day are vast improvements. One of the early varieties was called
_Fulgens_. We recollect seeing this variety some four or five years ago,
and could not refrain from comparing it with a number of varieties
lately introduced. The flower may be described as follows: A slender
crimson tube two inches in length; sepals narrow, one-half inch; in
color a shade lighter than the tube; the corolla purple; in size very
small compared with the varieties of the present time. This variety is a
strong grower, large foliage which has a silvery appearance. Thus we can
have a slight idea of that from which have been produced the beauties of
our time; thus can we see what a skillful florist can do when he has
something to begin with. Some of the varieties of the Fuchsia are hardy
in England as well as in some parts of our own country. A traveler
informs us that he has seen them in California trained over arbors and
to the houses just as we train grape vines here, and growing most
luxuriantly. They grow in favor very rapidly wherever introduced, and it
was but a short time after they became known we find the Poet eulogizing
them in these lines--

    "Graceful flowers on graceful stem,
    Of Flora's gift a favorite gem;
    From tropic fields it came to cheer,
    The natives of a climate drear;
    And grateful for our fostering care,
    Has learnt the wintry blast to bear."

While some flowers have been extremely popular for a season, and then
have sunk into comparative obscurity, the popularity of the Fuchsia has
never waned, but on the contrary has continually been on the increase
until now it occupies a prominent place in every collection of plants,
be that collection large or small. There is a cause for this popularity,
and that cause is, it is of easy culture and produces its flowers
freely, often under adverse circumstances. The Fuchsia is readily
propagated by cuttings of the young wood. These will root in from two to
three weeks, when they should be potted in rich soil, say one-half
garden soil or loam enriched with well-rotted manure, and one-half leaf
soil, with a little sand added to make the compost very porous. From the
time the plant is first potted it should never be allowed to become so
dry as that the growth will be checked. The great secret of growing
Fuchsias successfully is to _keep them growing_. In order to do this we
must provide for them a rich soil, an abundance of pot-room and a moist
atmosphere. If you wish to grow large specimen plants the cuttings
should be struck (that is rooted), early in the season. This will allow
a longer period for them in which to make their growth before the season
for blooming arrives; by keeping the plants supplied with plenty of
pot-room the time of blooming will be somewhat retarded, and if on the
other hand we desire to have the plants in bloom as early as possible we
allow plenty of pot-room during the early part of the growing season,
after which we allow the pots to become pretty well filled with roots,
and abundance of beautiful pendulous flowers will be the result.

As house or window plants the Fuchsias are very popular. The variety
_Speciosa_ will bloom very freely during the winter. During the summer
months they should be protected from the direct rays of the sun, and
kept well syringed. As bedding plants their utility is limited, as they
must be planted in a shaded position. A bed of them in such a position
makes a pleasant appearance, and in this way they are easily kept
through the hottest part of the year. They may be bedded out, or may be
allowed to remain in the pots and the pots plunged in the garden. In
this latter way they will need additional care, as they must not be
allowed to suffer for want of water. If it is desirable to keep the old
plants another year they may be removed to the house or cellar, and kept
cool and dry until toward spring, when they can be repotted in fresh
soil, watered scantily, and started into growth and pruned or trained to
any desired shape or form.--_The Floral World._

The foregoing article so fully and clearly stated all that was essential
respecting the culture of the Fuchsia, that we have transferred it
entire instead of writing something original. We need now only add a few
things respecting some choice varieties and recent novelties. "_Champion
of the World_ has the largest blooms of any Fuchsia; the tubes are
short; sepals very broad and of great substance, well reflexed, and of a
most beautiful coral red; the foot-stalk of each bloom is of unusual
length and strength, so that each flower stands out bold and graceful.
Corolla of immense size, and as it expands forms two-thirds of a perfect
ball. Color is of the most intense bright dark purple. Free tall grower,
and for conservatory decoration is one of the most remarkable Fuchsias
for size ever yet sent out."--_H. Cannell._

The illustration of this Fuchsia in Mr. Cannell's _Floral Guide_
measures two and one-third inches in diameter, and yet we are told that
when well grown, the _Champion_ produces much larger bloom than the
engraving. It has four rows of petals, and looks round and full like a
pink. _Bland's New Striped_ is of the single class, but the corolla is
very large, of a rich plum-colored purple, regular and distinctly
striped red and rose, pyramidal shape, habit strong.

Of the Hybrid variegated Fuchsias, _Sunray_ is by far the best with red
variegated leaves ever sent out; it is very ornamental. _Pillar of Gold_
is a very showy variety with yellow leaves. Among the novelties in
color, we find mention of _Aurora Superba_; tube and sepals rich salmon,
corolla large and spreading of a distinct orange scarlet highly suffused
with yellow, fine habit and free bloomer. _Polyhymnia_ is a dwarf
yellow.

Of _Lord Beaconsfield_, Mr. Cannell says: "One of the strongest and most
conspicuous blooming varieties ever sent out, and one of the very best
for sale and decoration; flowers neither good shape nor color, but
produced in very large clusters and blooms nearly all the year if
allowed plenty of root room."

This Fuchsia originated with Mr. John Laing, Stanstead Park Nursery,
Forest Hill, near London, and is a cross between Fuchsia Fulgens and one
of the modern varieties known as "Perfection." It was exhibited at some
of the meetings of the Royal Horticultural Society first, as Laing's
Hybrid, in 1875 or 1876. It much resembles the old Speciosa, but is more
free blooming even than that, and its flowers are twice as large.

Kingsburyana, figured in Mr. Cannell's _Floral Guide_--which comes to us
from Swanley, England--is very large and double. "It is another addition
to the double white corolla class, and is remarkable for its fine
vigorous growth and large showy flowers; its corolla is particularly
novel and beautiful."

Mrs. H. Cannell, named for the florist's wife by Swaffield, its
originator, "was one of the greatest lifts in bringing the double white
corolla to perfection," and has given great satisfaction in this
country. We have never seen one so beautiful, but Mr. C. E. Allen who
has a large collection, including those rare gems from across the water,
we have named, says: "_Snow White_ is the very best double white Fuchsia
ever sent out. A fine, erect grower, and a remarkably free and early
bloomer. Sepals coral red. Superior to Miss Lucy Finnis in that it is of
a stronger habit. Have none now in bloom." Among the fine specimen
blooms of the dark purple type sent us by Mr. Allen, we think _Elm City_
the gem for size, richness of color--a double dark purple striped with
scarlet, sepals scarlet-crimson--and compact form. The _Swanley Gem_ is
of a peculiar shape, single, very open bell-shape corolla, "frilled" Mr.
Cannell calls it, rose color with tube and sepals coral scarlet, the
latter are very prettily reflexed.

We began our list with the _Champion_--the largest known--we will end it
with the tiniest, _Microphylla_, the whole plant, flowers and leaves are
Liliputian among the Fuchsias.




Here these are truly wonderful; they grow up the house fronts, and grow
into large trees, so large that you can have a tea-party around the bole
of the trees. They are also grown for hedges and kept nicely clipped,
and with their bright green leaves and scarlet flowers look cheerful and
refreshing. The winds and the spray from the sea do not in the least
affect them.--_The Garden._

Mr. Vick, in his Magazine says: "Once when in Europe, we saw at Ventnor,
in the Isle of Wight, a Fuchsia tree, perhaps twenty feet or more in
height, with a trunk full fifteen inches in diameter. The editor of the
_Flore des Serres_ of Belgium, in writing of this tree, says it is
doubtless the largest specimen in Europe, but is only a baby compared
with specimens the editor has seen in South America. Seeing our notice
of this tree, Mr. NICHOLLS of Sharon Springs, N. Y., wrote us that he
had "seen Fuchsias in the Isle of Jersey, in the English Channel, thirty
feet in height, and there are hundreds there from twenty to twenty-five
feet."




We have found the most effective method to be by placing the cuttings in
a bottle of water, and keeping them in a sunny window, but the following
method is said to be practiced by cottagers in the west of England: "In
the autumn, after the frost has destroyed the foliage, the wood of the
present season is cut off close to the ground and laid like a sheaf of
corn in a trench a foot deep. The bundle is covered with a few inches of
soil, and here it remains until spring, when a multitude of young shoots
may be seen pushing their way through. The soil is then carefully moved,
and with a sharp knife a cut is made each side of a joint, and the
result is rooted plants enough for the parish. The old stool throws up
more vigorously than before, to be served in the same way the following
autumn."





Only a few years ago, not one of the Coleus family had a place in the
gardens of Europe and America, and I have been told that in our absence
gardeners depended chiefly upon plants with showy flowers for
ornamenting their gardens and grounds. When some of my remote relatives
were introduced, numerous were the surmisings as to what place they
should occupy amongst cultivated plants. This was especially so in the
case of Perilla Nankinensis, a plant of most sombre hue, but so striking
withal as to attract general attention. Some looked upon it as the
forerunner of a class of plants destined to play an important part in
the future, whilst others regarded it as a vile weed. Nevertheless,
considerable attention was bestowed upon its cultivation for a time; but
ultimately became so neglected as to be met with chiefly as a garden
weed. This may have been owing in some measure to the introduction of
Coleus Blumei, which species was regarded with greater favor, and at
once took a place which it held fairly well for a time, or until he
whose name I bear obtained from it varieties so novel and brilliant in
color, as to entitle them to rank high amongst the time-honored
favorites of the garden. From the most reliable information, I infer
that this species at least is one of my immediate ancestors, and whether
I owe as much of kinship to any other, has not been made known. But this
I do know, from the day I was first introduced to the public, in my
chocolate and violet colored suit until the present time, I have been
praised as few plants have been. But being neither envious nor vain, I
have desired the company of those whose colors are brighter than my own,
as variety in harmony gives greater satisfaction than any one can singly
bestow. Some of the older varieties are well fitted to produce this
effect, and none more so, perhaps, than my old friends Aurea Marginata,
and Golden Circle; but the majority of their class either lack
expression, or are so delicately constituted as to become perfect
"frights" when planted out of doors.


During my time, many varieties with excellent characters when in my
company, have performed their parts but poorly, whilst others have had
enough to do to keep up a doubtful reputation. It was with pleasure,
therefore, I hailed the arrival of a fresh set from England a short time
ago, headed by George Bunyard, who, with his companions were so highly
spoken of, that I hoped one or more of them would prove of service to
me. But this hope has not been realized, and to-day, for all of them, I
am as destitute of support as I was before their arrival. Poor George,
after being much in his company for a season, it is only fair to say, he
performed his part so poorly that I hope, for the credit of both, we
shall never meet again under similar circumstances.

What the incoming season may bring forth, yet remains to be seen, but at
present the prospects are good for a grand display, as a new order of
aspirants are being marshaled for duty, whose merits, some say, are such
as to eclipse the old members of our family, and even take from me the
honors I have enjoyed so long. Should their claim be well founded, I
shall surrender my right to the first place without regret, and be even
glad to take any subordinate place I may be deemed competent to fill.
But should they fail to meet the expectations thus produced, it will be
my duty to remain at my post until such time as new varieties are found,
regarding whose merits there can be no doubt.

Be it understood that what has been said about my associates has
reference only to them as bedders; for it is well known, many varieties
when grown under glass, and partially shaded from the glare of sunshine,
possess greater brilliancy and beauty than I lay claim to. For this
reason, I think those so constituted as to require the protection of a
green-house, should be sparingly, if at all, planted out of doors, and
the outside department exclusively occupied by such as attain their
greatest perfection in free air and the full tide of sunlight.

Before closing this monologue, I am forced to say a word in behalf of a
plant seemingly possessed of extraordinary capacity for the work in
which I excel. I refer to Acalypha Macaffeana, the leaves of which are
large and finely formed; color, reddish-brown, and irregularly blotched
with bright shades of crimson. When fully exposed to sunlight, it looks
as if "on fire through all its length," and being much more stately than
myself, might form the central figure in a group of Coleus or other
plants with the greatest acceptance.--VERSCHAFFELTII, in _Gardeners
Monthly_.

We do not know who is the author of this very interesting autobiography
of an old and popular Coleus. The florist for whom it was named, M.
Nuytans Verschaffelt, was the adopted son of the late Jean Verschaffelt,
of whose nursery near Ghent, he was the manager, and to which he
succeeded on the death of the proprietor. M. Nuytans was a very
distinguished and highly esteemed horticulturist; he was an active
member of the Royal Agricultural and Botanical Society of Ghent and
Chevalier of the Order of Philip the Magnanimous. He died June, 1880, in
the forty-fourth year of his age.

There has been a remarkable progress in the development of the Coleus
since the introduction of Blumei, but the two past years have been more
distinguished than any previous ones by the originating of many new and
beautiful hybrids. Pre-eminent among these are "Dreer's Set of
Tri-colored Coleus," fifteen varieties; "Queensland Set," fifteen
varieties, and "Queensland Set of Dwarfs," ten varieties. Mr. Henry A.
Dreer says of them: "These varieties which it is a pleasure to offer,
have originated in our nursery grounds during the past summer, were
selected from perhaps six thousand seedlings excelling in point of
color, variety, habit and novelty, and we feel safe in predicting for
them a future that leaves nothing wanting in this class of plants."

Mr. Dreer is sustained in his statement by the verdict of many of the
leading florists who visited them, and the committees of the Cincinnati,
Philadelphia and New York Horticultural Societies, the summer and autumn
before they were offered to the public.

In the February number of the _Gardeners Monthly_, a lady asks some of
the correspondents who have tried the new Coleuses, to report thereon,
whether as brilliant as their illustrated types, and if they retain
their colors in bedding out. We will give the replies from the March
number.

J. R. H., Richmond, Va., says: "In response to the query of Mrs. R. B.
Edson about Dreer's New Hybrid Coleus, I take pleasure in giving my
experience with regard to their hardiness in the summer sun. As the
summers in our city are extremely dry and hot, I think it a very fair
trial of them.

"When I received my box of Coleus from Mr. Dreer and opened it, the
first thought was that I was swindled nicely, while I at once perceived
that they were of an entirely new type of Coleus, but considered their
colors very ugly indeed, and quite different from the colored sheet in
his catalogue. However, I determined to give them a trial before
expressing my opinion. I put them in the hottest place I could find,
determined to get out of them all the 'come out,' should there be any,
and to my utter surprise, their colors changed so rapidly and
beautifully, that after a lapse of two weeks, I could scarcely believe
they were the same plants. I so much liked them I determined they should
have a prominent place in my garden, and accordingly planted them in my
border where they did not miss the sun at all while it shone. They grew
off at once with the old colors (as when received), which discouraged me
again, when to my surprise, about the middle of June, they began to
show their bright colors again, and in three weeks they were the
brightest and prettiest Coleuses I have ever seen, and remained so with
a continual growth until they were killed by the frost.

"I must confess I never saw plants resemble as much the colored plates
of their likeness, as did my Coleus; just like the plate with the
exception of the fine gloss, which of course I did not expect. It seemed
that the hotter the atmosphere was the brighter they looked, and have
stood the sun about twenty per cent better than the older varieties.
They have given me more pleasure than any set of new plants I have ever
received. I consider them the greatest acquisition I have known in the
soft-wooded class of plants. While there is quite a similarity in the
tri-colored set, it is not at all an objection. The only objections to
any of them are that Amabilis and Mrs. E. B. Cooper, while very rank
growers, are exceedingly ugly, and Superbissima entirely worthless. It
will not grow, I don't care what I do with it. Some seedlings that I
have raised from them are very richly colored, and I think them much
prettier than their parents, though I have not had a chance to test
their qualities in the summer."

We regret that the writer did not give the names of those Coleus he so
much admired as well as those which are "exceedingly ugly" and "entirely
worthless." We can report the same lack of success with Superbissima. It
would not grow one bit, but remained stationary several months, and then
died.

Mr. E. L. Koethens reports from a large collection: "For bedding these
are the chosen ones, Gracilliana, Miss R. Kirkpatrick, Superbissima, and
above all, Speciosa. But for inside culture, many of the new ones are
unsurpassed for beauty in any class of decorative plants. Here again
Speciosa and Miss R. Kirkpatrick of Dreer's set, lay claims to
attention, and his Amabilis is attractive for its free blooming
properties. Fairy is also conspicuous, and Beacon takes the place of
Superbissima indoors, but Zephyr, in my opinion crowns them all as a
foliage plant for indoor culture; a single head often measuring ten
inches across, with a rich bronzy-brown color. The above are all
valuable acquisitions and should be in every collection."

Mrs. M. D. Wellcome thus writes: "Mrs. R. B. Edson in her charming
'Garden Notes and Gossip,' asks that some of the correspondents who have
tried the new Coleus, Dreer's and Henderson's new sets, report thereon.
I have not tried Henderson's, and only six of Dreer's, so I am not
prepared to report very fully. But I wish to make special mention of
Miss Ritta Kirkpatrick, which looks like the picture only it is
handsomer. It is the one represented by a large leaf, creamy white
center, broad, green lobed margin. It was a wee plant when it came to me
in early spring, but it very rapidly outgrew the other five, branching
out finely, so that I began in June to take slips from it, and have
continued to do this each month to the present time. I should think I
had rooted full thirty cuttings, and the original plant, which has been
beheaded on three of its branches, has now twenty-eight that would I
think all make very nice plants, if treated as were the others. I rooted
them all in sand, kept constantly wet, and exposed nearly all day to the
rays of the sun. I never saw anything so quickly take root and so
rapidly grow as did those cuttings. At one time I kept half a dozen
about two months in the pure sand, till they were fine large plants,
with a great mass of roots. They can be removed from the sand to pots of
earth without retarding their growth. I always allow the particles which
adhere to remain in transplanting. This Coleus is a special favorite
with me. Fairy, foliage yellow and green, blotched with crimson-scarlet,
and Charm, yellow, tinged with bronzy scarlet, stained with dark brown;
green deeply serrated margin, were very beautiful in the open ground,
and from these I rooted also in sand several very fine cuttings. But
the original plants did not grow rapidly. I think the Coleus adds much
to the attraction of the border, but it is for the winter window-garden
they are specially valuable."

These new Hybrids have stood the test of a year's trial, and three
varieties exhibited at the June meeting of the Royal Horticultural
Society, London, carried off the highest prize for this class of plants,
and received very flattering newspaper notices. In Mr. Dreer's catalogue
for 1881, he has selected twenty-four which he calls the cream of those
New Hybrids. Superbissima is included, while Zephyr is omitted.
Kirkpatrick is among them, we are happy to say. So superb are some of
the recent Coleuses, Verschaffeltii, we fear, will have to retire still
further into private life. Being quite advanced in years, we presume he
will not regret this. We are sure that he will always be treated with
that respect which is due to honorable old age.







How much one who gives attention may learn in the vast field of Nature!
How varied are its attractions, how wonderful its work, how
indescribable its beauties! There is a fascination in these studies,
whatever may be the department to which they are directed, and the more
one learns the more sensible they become of the limitations of their
knowledge. I have already told you I had within a year or two been
awaking to a realization of the value of ornamental foliage plants in
giving an abiding brightness and beauty to the window-garden and open
border. As humanity is ever prone to extremes I may become too
enthusiastic in this direction. I thought there was some danger of it as
I surveyed my array of pots filled with fine specimens of various sorts.
I will take them for my subject to-day, giving whatever facts of
interest I have been enabled to gather from various sources.



Everybody has heard of croton oil, but only a few of that same everybody
know anything about Crotons. The number of species known is enormous,
and they are found in many parts of the world, but chiefly at the South
Sea Islands. Some kinds are native to our own country, mainly in the
South and Southwest, but these are not characterized by the brilliant
markings of the foreign varieties. Their leaves are often thick and
large, but usually they are very long and narrow and ribbed, veined,
spotted and blotched with crimson, scarlet and gold. They are a very
interesting class of ornamental plants, and their low price, twenty-five
to fifty cents, except for novelties, places them within reach of the
common people. They do best in a rich soil, with a little peat and sand;
also an abundance of water.

The specimens I have are these: _Aucubæ Folium_--leaves large, dark
green, blotched with golden yellow. _Interruptum_, very long leaves,
mid-rib bright scarlet, shading to gold--very graceful. _Irregulare_, so
named because of the irregularity of its leaves in shape and color--two
precisely alike being rare.

The handsomest however of my collection, is Croton _Weismanni_. The
ground color is a shining bright green, striped and mottled with golden
yellow. The leaves grow to a foot in length and three-fourths of an inch
wide. Among the more recent and high priced novelties are Croton
_Evansianus_ and _Princess of Wales_. The former is "distinguished by
the peculiar form of its trilobate leaves and the depth of coloring
pervading the whole plant. The newest formed leaves are light olive
green with mid-ribs and veins of golden yellow, and the interspaces
spotted with the same color. As the leaves become older, the green
deepens and changes to a bright bronzy crimson, and the golden yellow of
the mid-ribs, veins and spots becomes a rich orange scarlet." _Princess
of Wales_ is one of the long-leaved drooping forms of Croton, and is
very distinct in character. The leaves are from one and one-half to two
feet in length. The ground color is green, and the variegations
creamy-yellow, very variable in color. The markings are of the maculate
style, with here and there large blotches of clear cream-yellow, and and
in other parts clouded markings of smaller confluent blotches and spots.
Occasionally these conditions are reversed.

The Croton _Fenzii_, recently offered in commerce by M. SOLVIATI, of
Florence, is described as a jewel among the Crotons. It is the result of
a cross effected in the green-houses of Sesto, between _C. Veitchii_ and
_C. Weismanni_, and has moderate sized oval acuminate leaves, richly
veined with golden yellow, the principal nerves being purplish-red,
which color extends to the stem and the petiole. The habit is so dwarf
and compact that plants only a foot high are often seen with all their
splendor, the yellow streaking then extending to almost the whole
surface of the leaf, and the red nerves shining on the yellow ground. It
is a variety especially fitted for the decoration of small green-houses,
as it requires very little room to be able to develop all its charms.
This variety has been dedicated to the Chevalier E. O. FENZI, President
of the Royal Horticultural Society of Tuscany.--_London Florist._




Of these the varieties are numerous, and the foliage very ornamental.
Those I have are _Dr. Hondley_; green ground, blotched with rose,
crimson center; _Madame Houllette_,--blush clusters and white spots on
green ground; _Sagittæfolium pictum_,--arrow-shaped leaves prettily
spotted with white; _Madame Alfred Bleu_,--the ground color of the
leaves is silvery white, which is blotched with green, in some leaves
very sparingly, in others, nearly half the surface; the veins are
prominent and of rich rosy crimson, bordered by narrow bands of a
lighter shade. _Alfred Mame_,--beautiful deep carmine, richly marked
with rosy spots and white leaf margin. _La Perle de Brazil_,--ground
color, green, reticulated all over with pure white, like fine lace.
These last three are from the collection of Mr. John Saul of Washington,
and are new.

Fancy Caladiums do best in somewhat shaded positions, in well enriched
soil, composed of finely decomposed manure, leaf mold and sand, and a
moist, warm temperature. Great care must be had in their earliest stage
of growth, to prevent decay of the tubers by over-watering. They can be
preserved in sand during the winter, in a room sufficiently warm to
prevent danger from frost.




Is the most striking and grand of the Ornamental Foliage Plants for the
lawn or flower garden. It will grow in any good soil, and is very easy
of cultivation. When of full size it stands about five feet high, and
its immense leaves often measure four feet in length by two and a half
in breadth; very smooth, of a light green color, beautifully veined and
variegated with dark green. When killed down by frost in the autumn, the
bulbs must be taken up and stored in the cellar. The Caladium belongs to
the family of "Jack in the Pulpit," or Indian Turnip, and the Ethiopian
or Egyptian Calla. They rarely bloom in our Northern States. The flowers
resemble in shape the Calla Lily, only are much larger and narrower, are
of a rich cream color, very fragrant at first, but soon lose their odor,
which resembles the Magnolia.



These comprise a large genus valuable for their foliage and also winter
flowers, yet not very generally cultivated. Mine are labeled
_Andersonii_, "a handsome orchid-like flower, white, spotted with red."
_Pictum_, foliage prettily streaked with white, a strong, vigorous
grower; _Tricolor_, leaves prettily marked with pink and green;
_Cooperi_, has flowers white, prettily streaked with purple; _El
Dorado_, light green foliage, with golden veinings.




These are considered by florists as among the most elegant of tropical
plants, but like the Eranthemums, are not generally known. They are all
natives of tropical America, and require strong heat with plenty of
moisture. They are low-priced, and ought to be more extensively
cultivated. I think mine are very beautiful. _Eximia_, upper surface of
leaves striped with grayish-white; under, purplish-violet. _Leopordina_,
pale green with oblong blotches of deep green. _Mikans_, shining green
with a white feathery stripe. _Van den Heckii_, dark glossy leaves,
mid-rib silvery white. _Makayana_, a very ornamental dwarf species;
leaf-stalks slender reddish-purple, blade of the leaf ovate, ground
color, olive green, beautifully and regularly blotched with creamy
yellow of a transparent character; on each side the mid-rib are oblong
dark green blotches, while the under side is rosy red. _Tubispatha_ is
an elegant and very attractive species of erect habit of growth; leaves
some nine or ten inches long, light green, ornamented on each side the
mid-rib with oblong blotches of cinnamon brown. _Veitchii_, "The leaves
of this grand plant are upward of twelve inches in length; the under
surface of a rich purplish-wine color, the upper of a deep shining
green, blotched with conspicuous patches along each side, of a
yellowish-green, almost verging on gray. The contrast is very marked,
and the whole plant very beautiful."

ACHYRANTHES, a genus of richly colored tropical plants, are better
known, and to a limited extent are found in many gardens,
_Verschaffelti_, with its dark crimson leaf, being the most common.
_Brilliantissima_, ruby red, is a new English variety; _Wallisii_ is a
new dwarf, with small purple leaves; _Lindeni Aurea Reticulata_, foliage
netted with golden yellow, on a light green ground. These plants are of
the easiest cultivation, and endure strong sunshine without injury.

ALTERNANTHERAS are also very effective for bedding plants; habit dwarf.
Foliage is in some of a magenta-rose color, others, yellow and red;
_Purpurea_ has a purplish tint, and _Versicolor_, crimson and pink
shadings. They are unsurpassed for ribbon or carpet bedding.

DIEFFENBACHIA, a genus of stove plants with very showy foliage.
_Brasiliensis_, a handsome variety, the leaves averaging eighteen inches
in length by eight or nine inches in width; the ground color of the leaf
is deep green, and the whole surface is mottled with small blotches of
greenish-yellow and white; _Bausei_ is a stocky-growing, broad-leaved
variety, with yellowish-green leaves, which are irregularly edged and
blotched with dark green, and also spotted with white, the markings
being peculiarly effective; _Weirie_ is of dwarf habit, the foliage of a
bright green color, thickly blotched and spotted with pale yellow. One
of the finest of the species. They grow best in loam and peat equal
quantities, with a little sand. Require strong heat and frequent
watering.

A few ornamental foliage plants of rare beauty received from Mr. John
Saul merit special notice:

_Cyanaphyllum Spectandum_ is a grand plant with large, oblong, lustrous
leaves which have a rich, velvety appearance; they are beautifully
ribbed with whitish color.

_Alocacia Macrorhiza Variegata_, its large caladium-shaped leaves are
marbled and broadly splashed with white. Some leaves are nearly all
white; _Zebrina_, fine yellow leaf-stalk with distinct black marks;
_Illustris_, the leaf-stalks are erect, and have a brownish-purple tint,
color a rich green, marked between the principal veins by broad patches
of a blackish olive, and forming a striking contrast with the brighter
green portions of the leaf surface; _Sedini_, "A very beautiful hybrid
between _A. Metallica_ and _A. Lowii_. The form of the leaf is perfectly
intermediate between the two parents, whilst the coloring is a very
striking and pleasing combination of the metallic hue of one parent,
with the dark green and prominent white veins of the other." Alocasias
require a moist heat during their growing season. Soil, peat, with a
small portion of loam, sand and manure.

_Acalypha Macafeeana_ is another of the rare and beautiful foliage
plants alluded to. It is considered the best Acalypha ever offered. It
is certainly very handsome with its "sub-cordate and serrate leaves,
eight inches long and six broad, frequently cut into many forms, and
very highly colored bright red, blotched with deep bronzy crimson." It
proves to be an admirable plant for bedding out. Quite as attractive
every way is _Panax Laciniatum_, "An elegant and very distinct habited
stove plant from the South Sea islands. The leaves are tinted and
indistinctly marked with pale olive brown, and form a rather complicated
mass of narrow segments; they are bipinnate, nearly as broad as long,
and have a drooping contour; and the pinnules or segments are very
variable in size and form, presenting the appearance of a complex head
of foliage in which the lanceolate lobes or pinnules have the
preponderancy."

_Panax Fruiticosm_ has a very graceful fern-like foliage. These plants
belong to the Aralia family, a genus very ornamental, natives of the
South Sea Islands.

Another of my Washington collection, very graceful and beautiful, is
_Paulinia Thalictrifolia_. Its delicate cut leaves resemble the fronds
of a finely divided Maiden-hair Fern. The leaves are of a rich shade of
green. The young shoots and foliage are of a pinkish-brown color. It is
of slender growth and climbing habit, very similar to Capsidium
Filicifolium, which has long been a special favorite of mine. Both of
these are elegant, trained on a pot trellis.

Paulinia Thalictrifolia is a native of the southern Brazils, from whence
it was introduced to the nurseries of Messrs. Veitch & Sons of Chelsea.
If only required for decorative purposes there should be no inclination
to make the plants produce flowers which are inconspicuous; therefore
the main object should be to have plenty of healthy foliage. To secure
this, the plant should be grown in a temperature of from 65° to 70°, and
if one part of the greenhouse is more adapted to its growth than
another, it is the dampest part. After this plant came into the
possession of Messrs. Veitch, and before its true value became known,
some plants of it were placed in a corner of an old, very damp, warm
pit, in which position they grew wonderfully strong, and quite surpassed
in vigor and beauty those that were, as was then supposed, placed under
more advantageous circumstances, i.e., in dryer and lighter parts of
other houses. Care is therefore now taken to keep them where abundant
atmospheric moisture can be supplied. A compost consisting of two parts
good substantial peat and one of loam, together with some silver sand,
suits it admirably.--_Gardening Illustrated._



These form a very important part of the class of which we are treating.
They give a very beautiful and tropical appearance to the lawn and the
garden by their stately growth and broad massive foliage, relieved by
rich crimson, scarlet and orange-red flowers. Their foliage comprises
various shades of green, glaucous, chocolate and purple tints, ribbed
and striped, fitting them admirably for grouping with other plants.

They are also very effective for large pot plants in the
pleasure-ground, or conservatory. Under rich cultivation they will
attain the height of five feet. They need water often. Among the newer
roots _Creole_, very dark foliage, grows to the height of about six
feet. _Ornement du Grand Rond_, very tall, with large bronzy-green
foliage, large scarlet flowers. _Oriflamme_ has large lanceolate-green
leaves, with violet veins, a vigorous showy plant with salmon-orange
flowers.

The roots of Cannas must be taken up in the autumn. If wanted singly,
divide them, if a thick clump is desirable let them be planted out as
they are. They must be kept perfectly dry through the winter; if the
cellar is very damp they will do better packed in sand.




This is a valuable genus of ornamental plants, specially fine for the
center of vases, and for pot culture. Although their culture is on the
increase, they are not so frequently grown as they deserve. The species
are very numerous, and are found in tropical countries, especially in
the islands of the tropics. Many of them assume the proportions of
trees. The largest specimen ever known was one of Dracæna Draco, or the
Dragon tree of Oratava in Teneriffe, one of the Canary Islands. This
tree was remarkable for its monstrous dimensions and prodigious
longevity. About ten years since, or in the autumn of 1867, this
magnificent specimen was destroyed by a gale of wind. It was a special
object of interest in the Canary Islands, and received the attention and
veneration of visitors, as do the great Seguvia trees of California. Its
trunk below the lowest branches was eighty feet in height, and ten men
holding hands could scarcely encircle it; by one measurement this span
around it was seventy-nine feet. The trunk was hollow, and in the
interior was a winding stair-case, by which one might ascend as far as
the part from which the branches sprang. It is affirmed by tradition
that, when the island of Teneriffe was discovered in 1402, this tree was
as large, and the cavity in the trunk as great, as at the time of its
destruction. We are even assured that in the fifteenth century, at the
time of the conquest of the Canaries by the Normans and Spaniards, they
celebrated mass on a little altar erected in this cavity. From the slow
growth of the young Dragon trees in the Canaries, it has been estimated
that this monster tree before it was destroyed, was the oldest plant
upon the globe. A writer in describing it says: "Long leaves pointed
like swords, crowned the extremities of the branches, and white
panicles, which developed in autumn, threw a mantle of flowers upon this
dome of verdure." The popular name of this species is Dragon's-blood
Tree, because of a resinous juice of a red color which exudes from the
cracks in its trunk. At one time this resin formed a considerable branch
of commerce, as it was used medicinally as an astringent, but it has
fallen into disuse.

The Dracænas belong to the Lily family, and they afford a remarkable
contrast to the palms and other arborescent endogens, by their branching
heads. The young trees of Dracæna Draco do not, however, send out any
branches, even in their native localities, until they are thirty years
old or more. The small plants of this species, cultivated for ornament,
have always a single, straight stem; but are much more robust, and
quickly assume more stately proportions than those of the other kinds
that will be mentioned.

The Dracæna is admired for its peculiar grace of form--it would be in
vain in common house culture to expect flowers. To admire a plant for
its well developed and graceful form, marks an advancement in refined
taste beyond that which would induce one to exclaim, "Oh!" at the sight
of a brilliantly colored flower. Even in rearing a plant for flowers,
the first object should be to develop it to the fullest extent in size
and shape and strength--to make a beautiful object of the plant itself;
just as the first and main attention given to a child, for years, should
be to develop and build up its physical system.

The Dracæna is a good house plant, a good balcony and veranda plant,
good for the vase in the open air, and in a handsome pot is a fine
ornament for table decoration. Its culture is of the simplest kind,
adapting itself to any ordinarily good soil, it only requires to be
supplied moderately with moisture and to have a temperature ranging
upward from sixty-five degrees. It delights in a moist air, and whenever
possible, water should be kept where it will rapidly evaporate, and thus
ameliorate the atmosphere in this respect for the plant. This condition,
moreover, is conducive to the well-being of most plants, and no good
plant-grower can disregard it with impunity. Washing the leaves and stem
of the plant frequently with a wet sponge, is favorable to its health
and vigor, and one of the best preventives of the attack of insects.
With dust on the leaves the plants look dingy, while frequent washing
keeps them bright and lustrous.

Dracæna indivisa has long, slender, dark green leaves, about
three-quarters of an inch or an inch in width, and from two and a half
feet to three feet in length, and the lower ones especially are very
much recurved or gracefully drooping. This species is among the hardiest
of the Dracænas, and is frequently wintered in the open ground, with
some protection in climates where the temperature frequently descends
several degrees below the freezing point.

Dracæna terminalis is the most popular of the whole family in this
country, and is worthy of all the admiration bestowed upon it. The
leaves are broader and more erect than those of the preceding species,
and of a dark green suffused with red, or having streaks of a reddish
color; the young leaves nearly pink, but assuming a dark bronzy copper
color afterward. It is a very distinct and showy plant, and adapted to a
great variety of ornamental purposes. The propagation and sale of it is
rapidly increasing every year, and it is already widely disseminated. At
the Sandwich Islands it is cultivated to a considerable extent for its
roots, which are baked and eaten. A fermented beverage is also made from
the juice, and its leaves are employed as fodder for cattle, and for
clothing and other domestic purposes.

Dracæna Shepherdii is of a most noble form, and is one of the finest yet
in cultivation. It has long, spreading leaves, of a metallic green, with
stripes and border of bronzy-orange, and is a very free grower. Unlike
most of the forms already known, which color most on the free young
growth of vigorous plants, this plant takes on its distinctive coloring
gradually on the older leaves.

Dracæna cannæfolia is an interesting species. Its peculiarity consists
in the length of petiole, which is as long as the rest of the leaf. The
blade of the leaf is elliptical in form, from fifteen to twenty inches
in length, firm, and of a glaucous green.

Within a few years past much attention has been given by cultivators in
Great Britain and Europe to hybridizing the Dracæna, and producing new
varieties. The most remarkable success has attended the efforts in this
direction, of MR. BAUSE, in the establishment of MR. WILLS, of Anerly,
England. The variety is wonderful--"broad-leaved, medium-leaved and
narrow-leaved; bronzy and green, crimson, rose, pink, violet and white
variegations; drooping, spreading, and erect habits, are blended in all
sorts of combinations."

One of the sorts produced is described as "a most important acquisition,
having quite the habit and character of the well-known favorite
terminalis, but with white variegation. The ground color is a bright
green, with bold, white variegation, the upper leaves being white, with
here and there a bar of green."--_Vick's Magazine._




Sent out in this country for the first time in 1880, is said to be "one
of the most magnificent ornamental foliage plants ever introduced, and
altogether unique in character and aspect. It is a native of Western
Tropical Africa. The plant is of erect habit, and the stems are closely
set with stalked spreading leaves, the petioles of which are of a
grayish color, terete with a narrow furrow along the upper side, the
base being dilated and sheathing the stem. The blade of leaf is marbled
and irregularly banded with dark green and silver gray in alternate
straight bands, the colors being about equally distributed. The back of
the unfolded leaves is a pale reddish-purple or wine color, and the
stem, where visible. It is, without doubt, one of the most superb of
ornamental stove plants."

When first sent out in London in 1878, its price was from five to ten
guineas per plant. We do not know the price in this country. Mr. H. A.
Dreer who has an illustration of it in his catalogue, furnishes the
price only on application, which is evidence that it is costly. From the
type given, it must be exceedingly handsome, and wholly unlike any
Dracæna before offered in America.

Dracænas, as we have noticed before, are particularly desirable house
plants, keeping in good condition for a long time, even in rooms where
gas is burned--places so unsuited to most plants. They are liable to
attacks of the Mealy Bug and the Red Spider if neglected, but the
syringing and sponging advised for them will effectually prevent their
gaining a foothold if frequently and thoroughly performed. After a year
or two the plants begin to lose their lower leaves, and to get leggy, a
state of things quite undesirable, as the beauty and effectiveness of
the plants depend upon their being furnished with leaves down to the
base of the stem. When the plants have become unsightly from the loss of
their leaves, they can be renewed very quickly by a simple process. Cut
a notch in the stem, on one side, just below the lowest good leaves, and
take out a piece of the wood, then do the same on the other side of the
stem, but not exactly opposite the first notch. The object is to check
the flow of sap at this point and yet allow enough of it to pass to
maintain the head. Having cut the notches, take some moss or sphagnum
and bind about the stem, covering the incisions and fastening it on
securely with twine or fine wire; the moss is to be kept gently moist,
and in the course of two weeks will have thrown out young roots above
the notches. The head can now be severed from the stem and potted in a
medium-sized pot. After keeping it a few days in the shade, it can be
gradually brought out into the full light, and will be found to be
established.

Dracænas may also be multiplied by removing the thick, fleshy root that
may usually be found in the base of the plant. Those tuberous roots can
be potted, and if kept in a warm place will soon start and make new
plants. When plants are re-potted a favorable opportunity is offered for
taking off these roots, for the roots of the old plants are actively at
work and, with the fresh soil they receive, will soon recover from any
slight check they may have received.

The most rapid method of propagating this plant is by cuttings of the
stem; the stem may be cut into pieces an inch in length, and those
pieces split in two, and all of those bits will root and become plants.
They should be placed in a light, sandy soil, and given a brisk bottom
heat of 70° or 80° degrees. They will break and start into growth in a
few days.--_Vick's Magazine._

So fully does the foregoing express all that is needful regarding the
Dracæna, we have thought best to give it entire. We might greatly
enlarge on the subject of Ornamental Foliage Plants, and speak of the
beautiful Palms, so fine for decorative purposes, the pretty Ferns and
elegant Aralias, of which latter "_Sieboldi_ is a capital house plant,
so enduring that it will live and keep its beautiful dark green color
for weeks almost in the dark." Then there is the Euonymus, so bright
with its glossy green leaves, long a favorite whether for the border or
window garden. _Argentea_ has striped foliage, and _Japonicas aurea_ has
its dark green foliage diversified with golden variegations. _Bicolor_,
foliage almost white, and _Tricolor_, a rarer form, is marked with pink
and white.

With the numerous varieties we have named, it will be apparent how
ornamental our gardens, whether within doors or without, may be made by
plants, the beauty of which is wholly independent of flowers, and they
do wonderfully enhance the effect of the bloomers. The Centaureas and
Cinerarias with their deeply lobed leaves of white, are too well known
to need any special mention. We do not intend however to pass so lightly
over another stately and highly ornamental genus that comes within the
reach of everyone. Ricinus, the seed of which can be purchased for a
dime, are magnificent in foliage, and when combined with the brilliant
colored fruit of the giant varieties, the effect is very oriental.
Ricinus _Africanus albidus_ is of recent introduction. It is white
fruited, and the stems and leaves are silvery; height eight feet.
_Borbaniensis arboreus_ has very large and showy foliage; height fifteen
feet. _Communis_ is the Castor Oil Plant. _Sanguineus_ (Obermanii) bears
splendid red fruit in clusters, and is very ornamental. A species from
Phillippines has gigantic foliage; height ten feet. These can be
purchased in separate or mixed packets, and we advise everyone who has a
bit of ground to try them. We will close with




I have just harvested my Ricinus or Castor Bean, which I raised from the
seed you sent me last spring. It was of mammoth growth, attaining a
height of fourteen and a half feet, and sixteen feet across the branches
of which there were seventeen after cutting off five during the summer.
Each of the branches contained a cluster of burs, the center one having
one hundred and thirty-four burs, the other branches not so many. Many
of the leaves measured from thirty to thirty-two inches across from tip
to tip or point of leaves. When sawed off at the ground, the body
measured five inches and a half of wood in diameter, inside of the bark,
which was one-fourth of an inch thick. This is a big bean story but
nevertheless a true one.--T. G. T. in _Vick's Magazine_.







It is an old adage that one must take Time by the forelock. In the
culture of flowers, we must certainly do so, planning and preparing in
spring for the coming winter, if we would secure for ourselves plants
that can be relied on for blooming. We know of none equal to



for common house culture, commencing to flower usually in November, and
continuing through the spring months. The seed for this ought to be sown
in April--if later the plants will not come into bloom so early. The
soil for Primroses in all stages should be fine, light and rich, with a
good mixture of sand.

For seed sowing it can be put in pans, boxes or six inch pots. First,
put in drainage--I use for this coarse sand--then the coarse siftings of
the soil. On this to the depth of one and a half or two inches, put the
fine mixed soil, press down smoothly and spray lightly with tepid water.
Sow the seed on the surface, and sift on enough of the fine earth to
partially but not fully cover them. Cover with a glass, or with a bit of
soft nice flannel, and place in the shade where a mild moist temperature
can be attained. Where flannel is used, it can be kept damp and thus
impart moisture to the seeds without their being saturated, washed bare,
or displaced by spraying. When the seed has germinated, then glass can
be substituted. The tender seedlings must be gradually brought to the
sunlight; too long exposure at first would kill them, and if kept in the
shade too much they will become drawn and dwarfed. This is the critical
period, and many fail at this point. Great care is essential till the
plants put forth the third leaf, which is rough and the true primula
leaf. Then the plants must be carefully transplanted into other pots
prepared as before. In about a month the glass can be removed and the
plants potted separately, setting them low, as it is a peculiarity of
the Primula to stretch itself up out of the soil, and become shaky. It
is necessary sometimes to give them support. In watering, care must be
had to prevent the water lodging in the axils of the leaves, which cause
them to decay. They will not bear showering like smooth surfaced plants,
and only occasionally should they be sprayed through a fine hose. They
must be kept during the summer months in a shady place, and have a cool
bottom to stand on; a cold frame is the best. They must be housed by the
end of September, and the best situation for them is a light, airy shelf
near the glass, yet not exposed to intense sunshine. They do not like
frequent changes of position and temperature, nor to be grown with other
plants. Give them a cool place where they will have the morning or
afternoon sun for a time. During the blossoming season stimulate the
soil once a week with liquid manure, or water with a few drops of
ammonia added. Pick off all flowers as fast as they fade. Plants are
stronger and better the second year, and unless they get too shaky, are
good for three years. They must, after blossoming, be taken out of the
pot, the ball of earth reduced from the roots, and then re-potted in
fresh soil. It is not needful to keep them dormant and shaded through
the summer, but in a cool and partially secluded position, they will
after a brief rest begin to grow, putting forth frequently little crowns
all around about the old one, and be full of blossoms during the autumn
and winter months. The double varieties are not so easily grown, and
cannot be recommended for general culture to be raised from seed. Fine
plants can be procured from the florists, but the large single sorts, we
think give the most satisfaction. Ellis Brothers, Keene, N. H., have
sent us for trial, packets of very fine strains; some are rare, and,
judging from the description, must be very beautiful. It is not often
that we find more than four varieties named in the catalogues. They
send out a dozen sorts, some of which we will name: _Primula Fimbriata
Kermesina Splendens_; Large flowers, brilliant velvet like crimson,
yellow eye. _Primula Frimbriata Punctata Elegantissima_; a new variety;
flower velvety crimson, edge spotted with white; very distinct. _Primula
Fimbriata Striata_; beautifully striped. _Primula Fringed_, _Fern Leaf_;
pure white, with large citron eye; very fine. _Primula Globosa_, new; a
large flowering, fringed sort; petals large and many of them crimped,
each overlapping the other, so that they appear almost semi-double;
colors white, light pink, crimson and lilac pink. All of these can be
bought in mixed or separate packets. We cannot find room for all of
these, but hope from the rarest to obtain some fine plants to brighten
our room the coming winter. Great advances have been made since the
Primrose was introduced into this country little more than half a
century ago.



Of the novelties we find in the London _Garden_ special mention made of
Primula Sinensis Fimbriata Alba Magnifica. The writer says: "The
Primulas from Mr. B. S. Williams' Victoria Nurseries, Holloway, were
remarkably fine. The newest sort shown, Alba Magnifica, promises to be
an excellent kind; the flowers are large, produced in dense and many
flowered trusses, borne well above the foliage, which is also remarkable
being elegantly crisped at the margins. The color is white, the purity
of which, however, is more strongly marked when the plants are more
mature than those shown; the habit of growth is very robust."

Of this novelty Mr. H. Cannell says: "The new white Primula is of
exquisite form and substance; the plants are exceedingly compact, with
deeply indented leaves of a light green color; the flowers measure two
and one-quarter inches in diameter, pure white, with large, bright
yellow eye, each petal being deeply and beautifully fringed, and are
borne in large trusses well above the foliage."

We give an illustration of this Primula, kindly furnished by Ellis
Bros., who are of the first to offer it in this country.




"What is the difference between them? I am told differently by nearly
every florist I ask. An old Englishman told me the other day that he
used to grow great quantities of them in England, and that the
difference between the two is, that the Picotee has fringed edged
leaves, while in the Carnation proper the edge of the leaf is smooth
like a rose."

The question is asked of Mr. Vick, and he thus replies: "The Carnation
and Picotee differ only in the arrangement of the color, or markings.
The distinction is made by florists, and is of course arbitrary. Seeds
saved from one plant, may produce both Carnations and Picotee, or even
from the same seed-pod. In an old work in our possession, the
distinction is as stated, but for long years any flower with an
irregular edge has been considered unworthy of propagation. The
Carnation should have broad stripes of color running through from the
center to the edge of the petals. The Picotee has only a band of color
on the edge of each petal."--_Vick's Magazine._

Although Mr. Vick here states that the Carnation should have broad
stripes of color, neither he, nor any other florist makes this
distinction, but call pure white, and pure red Carnations, just as
freely as those that are striped.

There are two classes of Carnations, and thousands of varieties. The
class of Perpetual Bloomers are called Monthly and Tree Carnations. The
Garden Carnations are hardy, and can be left in the garden during winter
by giving them a covering of leaves, straw, or evergreen boughs. They
are easily raised from seed. Sown in June or July, will make good robust
plants before frost, which will bloom the following summer. Some of them
will be single, perhaps, and these can be removed. Those of superior
merit may be multiplied by _layering_. This method is to select good
healthy shoots that have not bloomed, and make a cut midway between two
joints. First cut half way through the shoot, then make a slit
lengthwise to a joint. Remove the earth a few inches in depth, and press
the branch down so that this slit will open, and then cover with the
soil. Roots will form where the cut was made, and thus a new plant will
be formed, which can be removed in the autumn or spring. Midsummer is
the best time to do this, and by adopting this method good, healthy
plants are secured. The plants should be well watered a day or two
before layering is commenced, and immediately afterward--then only
occasionally. They are frequently propagated by cuttings, which can be
rooted in wet sand, or in light sandy soil.


Or Monthly Carnations, can be easily obtained of the florists for summer
or winter blooming; the former purchased in the spring, and the latter
in the autumn. If one raises their own stock, it is not best to allow
those to bloom much during the summer that are wanted for winter
flowering. It is well to sink the pots in a good sunny place in the
garden, and when they run up and show signs of bedding, cut back the
stalk so that it may become more compact and branchy, then the buds in
the late autumn or winter, will be much more numerous. The best for
winter blooming are _La Purite_ (carmine), _President de Graw_ (white),
_Peerless_ (white, striped with pink) and _Peter Henderson_, of the
well-known varieties. Of those of recent introduction, _Lady Emma_ is
said to be excellent. One florist says that "it is destined to be one
of the leading winter-blooming Carnations. From my bed of one thousand
plants in the green-house throughout December and January last, I
plucked more blooms than from any other variety occupying the same
space." It has proved excellent also for a bedding pink. Its color is a
rare shade of crimson scarlet; the flower is of medium size, full and
double, and never bursting down the side. _Lord Clyde_ has for three
years proved to be an excellent winter bloomer. It is of a very robust
growth, like its parent the _Edwardsii_, but of a more dwarf,
low-flowering habit. The ground-work is white, thickly striped with
carmine, and a frequent blotch of maroon; very floriferous, each stem
bearing from six to eight flowerets. _Lydia_ is another of the recent
novelties, and is very handsome. Flowers very large and intensely
double, of a rich rosy, orange color blotched and flecked with carmine.
_Crimson King_ is one of the largest Carnations, very full, bushy habit,
and robust, color crimson-scarlet. A pure bright scarlet is rare; when
therefore, _Firebrand_, a novelty of 1880, was announced as a bright
scarlet, it produced quite a sensation. It is very highly commended by
those who have seen it. _Grace Wilder_, _Princess Louise_ and _Fred
Johnson_, are new hybrid seedlings now offered for the first time to the
public.

There was quite a discussion in the _Gardener's Monthly_ of last year as
to the best pure White Carnation. In the August number, Mr. E. Fryer of
Delaware writes: "The varieties called _Peter Henderson_, sent out by
Nanz and Neuner I have found to be the best white I have yet grown for
winter bloom. It is a stronger and better bloomer than de Graw, its only
drawback being that it runs up high like _La Purite_. _Snowdon_ is a
true dwarf, pure white, and if it proves a good winter bloomer, will
probably supersede all other whites, the flower being of fair size and
very fragrant. Bock's Seedling, _Charles Sumner_, I have grown the past
winter. The flower is of an enormous size, but it invariably bursts
before opening, and is a dull unattractive color. _Waverly_ I have also
grown last winter--a splendid variety, rich crimson scarlet; the color
was no way exaggerated as represented in the _Monthly_ a year ago;
produces a fair average of flowers to the plant, flowers selling readily
at ten cents each. I think this the most useful color to the commercial
florist.

"I still cling to the old carmine _La Purite_, which for quantity of
bloom, size of flower and general good qualities, I think has not been
beat by any of the newer varieties for winter bloom." Mr. Peter
Henderson, one of the leading florists, places _Snowdon_ above all other
white Carnations, its dwarf habit making it specially desirable.

Florist's Pinks are more dwarf than the Carnations, flowers very double,
clove scented, and are of various shades of maroon, carmine, crimson and
rose interlaced with white.




The _Gardener's Chronicle_ gives the following interesting account of
the origin of this class: "It may be interesting to record the fact,
published in an old number of the _Floricultural Cabinet_, that the
first Pink worthy of notice was raised in the year 1772, by Mr. JAMES
MAJOR who was then gardener to the duchess of Lancaster; previous to
that there were but four sorts, and those of very little note, being
cultivated as only common border flowers. Mr. MAJOR having saved some
seed in 1771, he reared several plants, which, blooming the next season,
one of the number proved to be a double flower with laced petals, at
which he was agreeably surprised, although he considered it as being
only in embryo, and the prelude to still further advance to be developed
at some future period, which is now verified by the rapid strides this
beautiful flower made in size and quality during the years which
followed. Mr. MAJOR informed the writer of the foregoing remarks that he
made his discovery known to a nurseryman or florist and was offered the
sum of ten guineas for the stock of his new Pink; but, acting on the
advice of his friends, he declined to sell, and set to work instead and
increased the stock with a view of offering it in sale to the public. It
was sent out to the public at half a guinea a pair (for it has long been
a custom of offering Pinks in pairs, a custom which is continued to this
day), under the name of MAJOR'S Duchess of Lancaster, the orders for
which amounted to £80. It is recorded that one individual ordered as
many as twenty pairs, which was considered in those days an unusually
large number. It would be interesting to have a bloom of Duchess of
Lancaster to compare with the fine double varieties of the present day.
We appear to have come to something like a pause in the matter of Pink
production as the flowers are now very large and full, and the lacing is
as perfect as can well be conceived."




The word is derived from the Greek words _Dios_, divine, and _Anthos_, a
flower; God's flower, or the flower of Jove. There are several species,
and many varieties of Dianthus; _Dianthus Caryophyllus_ is what is
commonly known as the Clove Pink, and from it have been produced the
double varieties called Carnations and Picotees. The plant in its wild
state is found growing on the south side of the Swiss Alps, at a low
altitude, where the winters are not severe. The common perennial garden
Pink is _Dianthus Plumarias_. The old and well-known Chinese Pink,
_Dianthus Chinensis_, is a biennial, flowering the first season from
seed sown in spring, lives during the winter, blooms the second year,
and then dies. New and superb varieties have been introduced of late
years from Japan, and _Dianthus Laciniatus_, and _Dianthus Heddewigii_,
both single and double, make a splendid display, and are among the most
desirable of our garden flowers. _Dianthus Diadematus_ is of dwarf
habit, very profuse in blooming, and the flowers are of various hues,
from white to dark maroon, and also beautifully marbled and spotted. Of
the recent novelties _Eastern Queen_ and _Crimson Belle_ are superb; we
speak from personal knowledge. "Eastern Queen" is beautifully marbled;
the broad bands of rich mauve upon the paler surface of the petals are
very striking. "Crimson Belle," as its name implies, is of a rich
crimson hue, with dark markings; very large and finely fringed.

For early blooming it is well to sow seed as early as April. June sowing
will secure good hardy plants for the following season. When there is a
profusion of bloom, it is well to remove a portion of the flowers, so
that the plants may not become exhausted, and the seed pods beyond what
are desired for ripening, ought also to be cut off.




A Talk About Climbers.

    Oh, a dainty plant is the Ivy green,
      That creepeth o'er ruins old!
    Of right choice food are his meals I ween,
      In his cell so lone and cold,
    The wall must be crumbled, the stone decayed,
      To pleasure his dainty whim;
    And the moldering dust that years have made,
      Is a merry meal for him.
              Creeping where no life is seen,
              A rare old plant is the Ivy green.

                                CHARLES DICKENS.


Have been off on a vacation, peering into other folks' gardens and
admiring other people's flowers. Visited the Public Garden of Boston and
saw that there had been a marked improvement within ten years. The
massed beds of several sorts, with their contrasting borders, were very
attractive, specially the maroon Coleuses with border of Centaurea.
There were few varieties of Geraniums, and these were mostly massed in
beds, some all scarlet, others wholly pink.

At Forest Hills Cemetery there was the finest display of flowers and
tropical plants I ever saw, and they are very artistically and
tastefully displayed. I saw several beds with artistic designs on a
ground work of Sempervivum, evidencing great skill in the arrangement
and culture. The entrance gateway to Forest Hills Cemetery is very
beautiful in design, and here we saw that graceful climber Ampeclopsis
Veitchii, in the perfection of its beauty, covering the front almost
entirely. I had noted it in various stages of growth, clinging to the
dwellings in all parts of the city, requiring no aid but its own little
rootlets. It is a native of Japan and was introduced in this country
twelve years ago. It was slow at first in being duly appreciated, but
now is widely known and extensively propagated. Probably the finest
plant is owned by Mr. George L. Conover of Geneva, N. Y. It covers the
entire front of his two-story square house, and has become so famous
that horticulturists from all parts of the country have been attracted
by it, and a great many people have visited Geneva for the special
purpose of seeing this fine plant. It has proved to be perfectly hardy,
only the first year the young and tender plant needs some protection
during the winter. Florists are growing them in great quantities to meet
the increasing demand. It can be obtained for twenty cents. I received a
small plant last year and kept it in my window box during the winter. It
died down, however, and I quite forgot about it, till it sprang forth
anew in April. Since putting it in the ground it has grown rapidly, and
I shall value it now more than ever.




_The Golden-Leaved Honeysuckle_ is a special favorite of mine. Its
leaves are so netted and veined with yellow as to give this hue the
predominance. The foliage is small; the flowers are yellow and fragrant.
The family of _Lonicerus_, or Honeysuckle, embraces a large variety. The
botanical name was given in honor of _Lonicer_, a German botanist, who
died about three hundred years ago.

_Lonicerus Holliana_ was introduced into this country from Japan by Dr.
Hall. The flowers are pure white when they first open, but assume a
creamy tinge in a few days. This variety blooms almost continuously from
June till frost. It attains sometimes to the height of twenty, and even
thirty feet. The flowers are very fragrant.

_Belgian_, or Monthly Fragrant, bears its blossoms in clusters. They are
pure white in the interior at first, but afterward change to creamy
yellow, deepening into orange.

_Sempervirens_ (Scarlet Trumpet) is a native of this country, and
perfectly hardy. This is the most common, though not fragrant. It is a
strong grower, and blooms from June to November. Its scarlet flowers
tinged with orange afford a pleasing contrast with its dark, glossy
foliage.




For an out-door annual climber, what can be prettier than the dainty,
graceful Canary Flower? Mine have scorned the limitations of the twine I
had fastened to the lower limbs of a small pear tree and ascending far
above them, have run out a full yard on a large branch. The light green,
finely lacinated foliage is very handsome of itself, but when the Canary
bird flower is added, how lovely it is! It is so easily grown from seed
that I wonder so few have it. A paper costing only ten cents would give
you a score of plants, and they are much prettier for the bay window
than Madeira vines.

A writer from England says: "While in the north of England, last fall,
we paid a visit to Alnwick Castle, the seat of the Duke of
Northumberland, and the ancient home of the Percy family.... The first
thing that struck me on entering the town was a bay window most
charmingly draped with light green climbers, and literally covered with
bright lemon yellow flowers. Now this appeared so strange to me (for the
chilly night air had already affected the geraniums and other tender
out-door plants), that I had to cross the street, take the Yankee
liberty to open the gate, go inside and examine this thrifty beauty. I
confess I was not only surprised but greatly interested to find it was
_only_ the Canary flower, _Tropaeolum peregrinum_, a member of the
Nasturtium family, and I concluded at once that there should be one
cottage in America next summer worth coming miles to see on account of
its climbing plants of light green foliage and rich yellow masses of
Canary bird flower."--WALTON, in _Vick's Magazine_.

Do not forget to include this pretty vine in your seed order next year.




This is one of the best of our climbing annuals, on account of its rapid
and luxuriant growth, attractive foliage and large bell-shaped flowers.
Under favorable circumstances they will grow to the height of twenty and
even thirty feet in a summer. They commence to bloom when quite young,
and continue in bloom until destroyed by frost. Some people remove them
from the border to the house for winter blooming, but the change from
out-door to indoor life, often retards their growth and mars their
beauty. They are too cumbersome for window plants after having grown
during the season, and it is better to sow seed in August, and get in
this way plants for the house. They are hard to germinate, and need to
be started in pots or in a hot bed. Place them in moist earth _edge
down_, and do not water until the young plants appear above the surface,
unless the earth becomes very dry.

For out-door blooming sow in March or April. As soon as the plants are
strong enough, transplant to three-inch pots; keep them shaded from the
sun for a few days, gradually expose to the open air, and plant out when
all danger from frost is over. The soil should be well stirred to the
depth of nearly two feet, and well rotted manure worked in. In dry
weather they need liberal watering as often as once a week, and liquid
manure water occasionally is of great benefit to them.

The Coboea can be propagated by layers at almost any season of the year.
It is done in this way: Cut a notch near a joint, place in a pot and
fill with soil, and keep the soil moist. It takes from two weeks to a
month for them to root.

A writer says of this plant: "The Coboea is an old favorite and it is
worthy of remark that but few of the novelties introduced of late years
can equal some of the old favorites that we have been accustomed to
grow. The Coboea is a native of Mexico, from which country it was
introduced in 1792. It was named in honor of Bernandez Cobo, a Spanish
priest and botanist. The growth of the vine is very luxuriant, and it is
equally easy of cultivation, the only essentials to success being
warmth, a rich, light soil, and sufficient water. If allowed to become
very dry, it will soon wither away. It requires sun and a warm room to
grow it to perfection; yet it is not a tender plant, that is, it will
live anywhere, provided the frost does not touch it, and is one of the
few plants which will flourish luxuriantly in parlors lighted with gas
and kept almost at fever heat. If grown in a hanging basket or pot, it
must be large and the roots allowed plenty of room to spread out in. In
the summer the pots can be removed from the interior room to a balcony
or piazza, or plunged until they are again wanted. Then clip off the
growth of branches and leaves, place the pot back again in a sunny
window, where it will soon start afresh, with new arms and leaves to
cover the window. It is one of the best vines for parlor decoration, as
it will drape and festoon the window, and stretch forth its tendrils,
running up even to the ceiling. The tendrils are so clinging in their
nature that they will attach themselves to anything which comes within
their reach--curtain cords, branches of other plants, brackets,
etc.,--throwing out new branches everywhere.

"I advise all who adopt the plan of plunging the plant in the pot in the
open air during the summer, either to shift into a pot two sizes larger,
or else to take it out of the pot and reduce the ball of earth nearly
one-half, and repot it in fresh compost before removing it to the house.
This should be done not later than September 10th. The plants will amply
repay this little attention by an increased luxuriance of both foliage
and flowers during the winter months, while plants not so treated will
become sickly and unhealthy before spring, and beside, when pot-bound,
they soon become the prey of numerous insects."

There are several varieties of the Coboea, though _scandens_ is the most
generally known. The large bell-shaped flowers are greenish at first,
but rapidly change to a dull purple. Coboea Scandens _Alba_ has greenish
white flowers. Coboea _variegata_ is one of the most magnificent
ornamental climbers, the leaves being broadly margined with yellowish
white, the variegated foliage forming a beautiful contrast with its
large purple flowers. It is of strong habit, a rapid grower, attaining
frequently the height of fifty feet in a short time. It is, however,
difficult of propagation, rooting with difficulty. The seeds vegetate as
readily as the common sort, but the plants are apt to die off soon after
attaining their seed leaves. Layering in the manner already specified,
is the best method of increase.

Coboea scandens _argentea_ is another variegated leaved variety,
differing from _variegata_ in that its leaves are of a purer white. It
is described by some as being identical with Coboea scandens, Schuerens
Seedling, but by Messrs. Leeds & Co., of Richmond, Indiana, as being "a
great improvement on the old variegated variety. Leaves large, green,
bordered with creamy white; calyx of the flowers variegated like the
leaves."




Clematis (_Virgin's Bower_), derives its name from _klema_, a
vine-branch. The popular name, Virgin's Bower, was given to _Clematis
Viticella_ upon its introduction into England during the reign of
Elizabeth, 1569, and was intended as a compliment to that sovereign, who
liked to be called the Virgin Queen.

There are, it is said, two hundred and thirty described species, the
majority of them free-growing, hardy climbers. They are among the most
gorgeous perpetual-blooming of the class under consideration. Great
improvements have been made during the past twenty-five years by
hybridization, but the finest varieties have originated within ten
years. Of the new English hybrids _Jackmanii_ stands in the front rank.
The flowers are from five to six inches in diameter, and consist of from
four to six sepals which have a ribbed bar down the center; the color
is of an intense violet-purple, remarkable for its velvety richness, and
a shading of reddish-purple toward the base, and they are furnished with
a broad central tuft of pale green stamens. It originated with Jackman &
Son, England, and was first exhibited at Kensington, 1872. It is a cross
between _Clematis Viticella_ and _Clematis Lanuginasa_. From this cross
many excellent seedlings have been raised, closely resembling the parent
stock in color and general character.

Of Jackman's Clematises the English _Gardener_ has the following: "They
are magnificent; and more than this, they do give us some of the
grandest things in the way of creepers the horticultural world has ever
seen, making glorious ornaments either for walls, verandas, or rustic
poles or pillars, varying in color from deep rich violet hue to dark
velvety maroon, and in the newer seedlings, forms beautiful shades of
pale bright blue."

Mr. Vick says of the Clematis: "Having a rather unsightly pile of stones
in the back part of our grounds, we had them thrown together more in the
form of a stone-heap, perhaps, than of anything worthy of the name of
rockery, and planted _Jackmanii_ and other fine sorts in the crevices,
and for three summers this stone-heap has been covered most gorgeously.
Thousands of flowers, in fact a mound of flowers, every day for months,
has been the delight of visitors, causing one to exclaim, 'Nothing since
Paradise has been more beautiful.'"

These fine hybrids will endure our Northern winters if somewhat
protected. A gentleman in Rochester, N. Y., had a Jackmanii which bore
full exposure without protection and came out in the spring uninjured to
the height of nine feet. The extremities of the shoots for about two
feet were winter-killed.

_Clematis Sieboldii_ is a native of Japan, whence it was introduced by
Mr. Low in 1837. It is of a slender free-growing habit. "The flowers
which are produced from July to September are composed of six ovate
sepals of a creamy white color, which form a fine background for the
large rosette of purple stamens which occupy the center and render the
flowers particularly attractive."

_Clematis graveolins_ is a native of the mountains of Thibet. It is of
comparative recent introduction. The flowers are produced on long stalks
at the axils of the leaves, and are of a light yellow--an unusual color
in this genus. It grows to the height of from ten to fifteen feet, and
blooms freely during the entire season.

A lady writes to Vick's Magazine that she has a Clematis graveolins
which is a wonderful sight. It grew from a feeble plant planted out in
spring, two inches in height, into a column twelve feet high and three
feet broad by August, and was a mass of yellow blossoms, and then, of
the most exquisite, long-haired, silvery seed pods until hard frost. It
lived through the winter, to its extreme tips, and then grew so rapidly,
shading such an important part of her garden, that she had to remove it
in the autumn, cutting it back severely. The seedlings from it grow, she
adds, to eight or ten feet in a season.

_Clematis crispa_ is of Southern origin; the flowers are one and a half
inches long, produced singly on long stalks, and delightfully fragrant,
a rapid grower, and perfectly hardy. _Clematis coccinea_ is of recent
introduction from Texas, the flowers are bell-shaped, of a most
brilliant scarlet, and are produced in great abundance. This rare
variety is offered only by Woolson & Co., Passaic Falls, N. J., who make
a specialty of hardy herbaceous plants. _Vesta_, a Jackman, is large and
of fine form; dead white, with a creamy tinge over the center bar,
delicate primrose fragrance, an early bloomer. _Mrs. James Bateman_,
pale lavender, and _Thomas Moore_, violet, superb, are Jackman
seedlings, which flower in the summer and autumn, successionally, in
masses, on summer shoots. These are all high priced. Many fine sorts can
be purchased at prices ranging from thirty cents to one dollar.

The Clematis requires only ordinary garden soil. Where there are severe
winters it is best to give the young plants at least some protection.
They can be propagated by layering, which is rather a slow method, or
rapidly by seed.




Very beautiful among the hard-wooded Climbers, is the Chinese Wistaria
when in bloom. Its long, pendulous racemes of blue flowers are
exceedingly graceful. They are frequently twelve inches in length and
highly fragrant. The flowers appear about the last of May and first of
June. It is not a continuous bloomer like the Clematis, but often gives
a few flowers in August. It is rather slow at first, but after getting a
good start the second or third year grows very rapidly. It is hardy
after it gets strong, but young plants need some protection.

The Chinese White Wistaria was introduced by Mr. Fortune, and is
regarded as a great acquisition. The _Double Purple_ is illustrated in
Ellwanger & Barry's Catalogue, by a full page engraving, which gives one
an idea of its beauty better than the description which is as follows:
"A rare and charming variety, with perfectly double flowers, deeper in
color than the single, and with racemes of remarkable length. The plant
is perfectly hardy, resembling Wistaria _Sinensis_, so well known as one
of our best climbing plants. The stock which we offer was purchased of
Mr. Parkman, who received this variety from Japan in 1863, and was the
first to bloom and exhibit it in this country."

_White American Wistaria_ is a seedling originating with Messrs.
Ellwanger & Barry, of Rochester, N. Y. Flowers clear white; bushes
short. Free bloomer.




A novelty has been offered to the horticultural public of London this
spring (1880), in the shape of standard trees of Wistaria Sinensis,
raised in tubs, having heads five or six feet in diameter and covered
with clusters of bloom. The plants were raised in Rouen, France, and
sent to London for sale. It requires several years to attain plants of
good size in this style, and as a matter of profit, a strict account
would no doubt show a balance on the wrong side. In this country where
the Wistaria is "at home," it may be raised in tree-shape in the open
ground without expense, save the necessary care in pinching in and
shaping. "So completely did the plants offered in London strike the
popular taste, that there was quite a competition to become purchasers
of them, and large sums were offered by those anxious to possess them.
The general public, unaccustomed to this fine Chinese climber, looked on
with wonder at "Lilacs" of such unwanted size and beauty of
color."--_Vick's Magazine._

Mr. Vick evidently does not deem this method an improvement on the
natural graceful climber, for it reminds him of an anecdote which he
thus relates in reply to an inquirer respecting the Wistaria as a
standard.

"Once upon a time some kind of a steam cannon was invented, and a day of
trial was arranged at Portsmouth, England, to which the Lords of the
Admiralty and the Duke of Wellington were invited. After the exhibition,
which we believe was somewhat successful, opinions of its merits were
freely expressed, but the Iron Duke said nothing. When urged to give his
opinion, he replied that he was thinking--'thinking if the steam gun had
been first invented, what a grand improvement gunpowder would have
been.' If the Chinese Wistaria had been a tree, and some one could have
induced it to climb and cover our porches and arbors and old trees and
buildings, what a grand improvement it would have been."






    My faultless friends, the plants and flowers,
        Have only smiles for me.
    When drought withholds refreshing showers,
    Through hot and dreary summer hours,
        They then droop silently.

    When tired and worn with worldly care,
        Their fragrance seems like praise,
    A benediction in the air;
    Pure as an unfallen angel's prayer,
        Sweet'ning the saddest days.

    No frowns, no pouting, no complaints,
        In my bright garden fair,
    A colony of sinless saints,
    Whose beauty Nature's pencil paints,
        Are my fair darlings there.

    No inattention can awake
        Envy or jealousy;
    Their alabaster boxes break,
    As Mary's did, and I partake
        Of their rich fragrancy.

    Sometimes with weary soul and sad,
        I taste their sweet perfume;
    And then my soul is very glad,
    I feel ashamed I ever had
        A hateful sense of gloom.

    Flowers are the sylvan syllables,
        In colors like the bow,
    And wise is he who wisely spells
    The blossomed words where beauty dwells,
        In purple, gold and snow.

    O! sacred is the use of these
        Sweet gifts to mortals given.
    Their colors charm, their beauties please,
    And every better sense they seize,
        And bear our thoughts to Heaven.

                             GEORGE W. BUNGAY.






    "Spake full well in language quaint and olden,
      One who dwelleth by the castled Rhine,
    When he called the flowers, so blue and golden,
      Stars, that in earth's firmament do shine.
    Wondrous truths, and manifold as wondrous,
      God hath written in those stars above;
    But not less in these bright flowerets under us,
      Stands the revelation of His love."


What changes have been manifested--how unceasingly and with what
deftness Nature has silently wrought in tapestry and embroidery,
sculpture and painting, till beauty is all around us, in the green
carpet of earth, brightened with flowers and leafage of every hue! No
wonder the birds sing praises to Him who gave them life with its
fullness of blessings. Sad to think that man, high over all, and under
the greatest obligation, too often is silent in thanksgiving for the
gifts of a Father's love.

No month to me has such charms as June, when nature's robes are so fresh
and clean, and the balmy air is redolent with fragrance. How delightful
to be abroad with the early worm and early bird, working in the garden,
while the songsters give free concerts, and the hum of the honey bird,
and buzz of the bee, set forth a good example of cheerful industry!

The house plants have become established in the open border, and are so
glad to get away from artificial heat and confined atmosphere into the
broad sunlight of heaven, and breathe in full draughts of pure air and
sweet dew, that they put on their best attire, and most attractive
ornaments. Before the roses bloom, the bed of geraniums looks bright
with flowers, each ambitious to excel his or her neighbor, either in
beauty of color, or form, or duration of bloom, thus leaving me in
perplexity as to choice. When _Pliny_ bloomed everybody admired who saw
his beauty; then _Romeo_ with quite another style looked charming, but
when _Naomi_ unfolded her large trusses of double pips, of a rare,
peculiar shade, nobody ever saw a geranium quite so lovely, and then its
duration of bloom--full six weeks! _Jennie Dolfus_, however, became a
dangerous rival--a deeper, richer shade, and not a pip would she allow
to fade so long as _Naomi_ looked so pert. Some said, "I like _Naomi_
the best;" others said, "I think _Jennie_ is the prettiest." But
_Beauty_, close by, hearing the praises lavished on her sisters, and
perchance trusting in her good name, came forth one day in dress of
white with deep pink ornamentation. Never had such unique beauty as this
ever been seen in Geranium before, and, "Isn't it lovely!" "Just
splendid!" "What a beauty!" were uttered with exclamation points, till
she blushed with becoming modesty--the flush spread and deepened until
her face was completely suffused with the delicate tint, making her yet
more attractive. _Wellington_ donned his crimson suit, and _De Gasx_ an
orange yellow; _Pauline Lucca_, prima donna though she be, appeared in
dress of pure white, and _Richard Dean_ in scarlet with a white star
that was very becoming. _New Life_ thought to draw special attention by
odd freaks, and came out in a parti-colored dress of the most singular
combinations; part of it was scarlet dotted with white--part of it half
scarlet, half salmon, part of it widely striped, and part white with
just a flush of pink! I must call him the clown of the family!

I have only named a few of the rare Geraniums that adorn one of the beds
of my garden. For beauty, free flowering, and duration of bloom they
cannot be surpassed.

Interspersed with them are ornamental leaved Geraniums, _Crystal Palace
Gem_, an improvement on _Cloth of Gold_; _Marshal McMahon_, the best of
all the bronzes; _Cherub_, deep green, white and orange, flowers
carmine; _Glen Eyre Beauty_, _Dr. Livingstone_, a new, sweet-scented,
fine cut-leaved Geranium; _Happy Thought_, one of the most attractive,
with its dark green leaves and creamy white center. Here and there are
commingled Anchryanthus of divers hues, and Coleosus, giving a fine
effect to the whole. This is now the most attractive bed of all, but
when the Lilies are in bloom, and the dear little Tea Roses, the bed
parallel with it will be the sweetest, if not so brilliant.

This year I have a tropical bed of oblong form. A Castor Bean rises
majestically in the center, two beautiful Cannas each side, while a
Dracæna, a splendid Croton, two fancy Caladiums, and a few other choice
plants fill the space, the whole bordered with Coxcombs. In a few weeks
this bed will look gorgeous, and those filled with annuals will have
changed from their present inattractiveness to delightful bloom. August
is really the month of fullness of blossom, and of restful enjoyment of
beauty and fragrance. The weary days of preparation, of bedding out and
of weeding, are over, and one may now give themselves up to the
enjoyment of the fruit of their labor, till the chill nights of autumn
bring a renewal of the toil.

"Does the brief period of restful enjoyment repay for the many weary
days antecedent and subsequent?"

Yes, richly, fully, for there is pleasure with the toil, and to me
health-giving influences that energize the physical system for indoor
work, and stimulate the brain for literary pursuits. To me my garden is
a God-send, fraught with blessings.

"Gardening is a pleasant pastime." I am prepared to adopt that sentiment
to-day, if I did demur somewhat last month. It is a delightful pastime,
in the early morning, to spend an hour among the flowers, trowel in
hand, rooting out the weeds, loosening the soil around your plants, and
tying up here and there the tall and fragile, while the birds are
singing in the trees around you their morning song of gladness. How the
dew-laden grass and shrubs impart sweetness to the air, and your lungs
inhaling its purity, are expanded and invigorated, your whole system
feels the better for the tonic, and prepares for breakfast, and the work
that shall follow.

It is a pleasant pastime, when wearied with toil you go forth for a time
among your flowers and search for the buds, or examine the newly-opened
flower. How it rests you!

It is a pleasant pastime, when the labors of the day are over, and the
sun is throwing long shadows from the west, you take watering-pot in
hand, and shower the refreshing spray upon your plants, cleansing them
from the dust, and cooling them after the heat. How they thrive, and bud
and bloom!






    "We should love flowers, for when we are gone
      From this forgetful world a few short years--
    Nay, months, perhaps--those whom we hold most dear,
      Cease to bedew our memories with tears,
    And no more footsteps mark the paths that lead
      To where we dreamless lie; but God's dear flowers
    Give to our very graves the loveliness
      That won our tender praise when life was ours."




Of the many touching tributes paid to flowers, there is a beautiful one
associated with the closing hours of Henry Heine, the poet. He was dying
in Paris. The doctor was paying his usual visit, when Heine pressed his
hand and said: "Doctor, you are my friend, I ask a last favor. Tell me
the truth--the end is approaching, is it not?"

The doctor was silent.

"Thank you," said Heine calmly.

"Have you any request to make?" asked the doctor, moved to tears.

"Yes," replied the poet; "my wife sleeps--do not disturb her. Take from
the table the fragrant flowers she brought me this morning. I love
flowers so dearly. Thanks--place them upon my breast." He paused, as he
inhaled their perfume. His eyes closed, and he murmured: "Flowers,
flowers, how beautiful is Nature!" These were his last words.




A few years since the Belfast (Me.) _Journal_ gave this touching
incident: "One day last week an elderly man, known to our people as an
honest and hard-working citizen, was walking slowly up Main street.
There was sorrow in his countenance, and the shadow of grief upon his
face. Opposite the Savings Bank his eye caught sight of the flowering
Oleander, that with other plants fill the bay-window of the
banking-room. He looked at it long and wistfully. At length he pushed
open the door, and approaching Mr. Q., said:

"'Will you give me a few of those flowers?'

"The cashier, leaving the counting of money and the computing of
interest, came around the counter, bent down the plant, cut off a
cluster of blossoms, and placed it in the man's toil-hardened hand. His
curiosity led him to ask:

"'What do you want them for?'

"'My little granddaughter died of scarlet fever last night,' the man
replied with faltering voice, 'and I want to put them in her coffin.'

"Blessed be flowers, that can thus solace the bereavement of death and
lend their brightness as a bloom, to the last resting-place of the loved
one."



There is a beautiful incident told of a Texas gentleman who was an
unbeliever in the Christian religion. One day he was walking in the
woods, reading the writings of Plato. He came to where the great writer
uses the phrase, "God geometrizes." He thought to himself, "If I could
only see plan and order in God's works, I could be a believer." Just
then he saw a little Texas Star at his feet. He picked it up and then
thoughtlessly began to count its petals. He found there were five. He
counted the stamens, and there were five of them. He counted the
divisions at the base of the flower, there were five of them. He then
set about multiplying these three fives to see how many chances there
were of a flower being brought into existence without the aid of mind,
and having in it these three fives. The chances against it were one
hundred and twenty-five to one. He thought that was very strange. He
examined another flower, and found it the same. He multiplied one
hundred and twenty-five by itself, to see how many chances there were
against there being two flowers, each having these exact relations of
numbers. He found the chances against it were thirteen thousand six
hundred and twenty-five to one. But all around him were multitudes of
these little flowers, and they had been growing and blooming there for
years. He thought this showed the order of intelligence, and that the
mind that ordained it was God. And so he shut up his book, picked up the
little flower, kissed it, and exclaimed: "_Bloom on little flowers; sing
on little birds; you have a God, and I have a God; the God that made
these little flowers made me_."






This species is one of the most desirable of hardy-wooded plants we
possess. They are admirable for the house, for the balcony, the piazza,
or the border, being handsome in foliage, and very graceful and
beautiful in flowers. Some are stately, others dwarf, some are flexible
and drooping. We have had for several years three that we have greatly
admired for their variegated leaves, especially for the winter
window-garden, where they compensate for the scarcity of flowers, by the
brilliancy of their foliage, yellow and green, finely mottled and
marbled.

_Duc de Malakoff_ is stately, and by cutting off the top of the main
stalk, it is made to branch out very largely, forming a miniature tree.
It grows very rapidly, and its leaves are like the Maple in form, which
has led many to call the plant Flowering Maple, but this is not correct,
as it is not a Maple at all, but an Abutilon. Some of the leaves on one
only a year old, measure seven inches across, and eight and a half in
length. In the older plant they are not so large. _Thomsonii_ much
resembles _Malakoff_, but its markings are not so handsome; the green is
darker, and predominates over the yellow, so far as my observation
extends, but it is a more abundant bloomer. Flowers are orange color. I
have vainly searched through many catalogues to find the color of the
_Duc de Malakoff_ blossom, but all are silent; it is not even said that
they flower at all, but my four-year-old had one bud last year, which
unfortunately blighted. The yearling has one bud, and I hope it will
live and afford me the knowledge I have failed to find in books.
_Malakoff_ not variegated, has large orange bells, striped with brown.

My other variegated Abutilons are of trailing habit; _Mesopotamicum_ is
very graceful, one droops over the side, and climbs and twines around
the cords of a large hanging-pot, for which it is admirably adapted. Its
small pendant blossoms, crimson and yellow, growing profusely along the
slender branches, drooping among the elegantly marbled foliage, give
this variety a very attractive charm. Another is trained to a pot
trellis, and is very beautiful in this form. We advise every one to add
this variety to their collection. _Pictum_ is very similar in every
respect; the leaves are darker, and not so variegated. They require a
strong light to bring out their markings, and hence are more perfect in
beauty when bedded out in the garden, where they can have plenty of
sunshine.

_Boule de Neige_ (Fairy Bell) has long been a favorite for its pure
white bells and constancy of bloom. A splendid winter bloomer. _John
Hopkins_, with its rich, dark, glossy leaves and golden flowers has
superseded the old _Pearl d'Or_, which was for a time the only real
yellow. _Darwinii_ is one of my favorites. The flowers are more
spreading than any other variety, opening like a parasol; color
orange-scarlet veined with pink. It blossoms very profusely, and when
only a few inches in height. The flowers are large and well formed, and
borne in clusters rather than singly, like many older sorts. This
variety was cross-fertilized with _Santana_, crimson flower, and as a
result we have _Darwinii tessellatum_, combining the variegated foliage
of Thomsonii with the free-blooming qualities of _Darwinii_.

The improvements by hybridizing have been very great within a few years,
and many new varieties have been sent out. One of these is _Roseum
Superbum_, the flowers of which are of a rich rose color, veined with a
delicate pink. Very free bloomer. _Venosum_, we find only named in an
English catalogue. "The magnificent blooms of this variety place it at
the top of all the Abutilons. Although it is of tall growth its
beautiful palm-shaped leaves and gorgeous flowers make it invaluable for
crossing and for conservatories."--_H. Cannell._

Among the new and valuable novelties of American origin are _Arthur
Belsham_, _Robert George_, _J. H. Skinner_, and _Joseph Hill_. These
have been three years before the public, and Mr. John Thorp, a
well-known popular florist of Queens, N. Y., says of them, "We have not,
amongst all the flowering Abutilons, such fine varieties as these. I
have had plants between five and six feet high, pyramidal shape and
literally covered with flowers."

They originated with Messrs. Leeds & Co., of Richmond, Indiana, who make
quite a specialty of new seedling Abutilons, and this year offer four
"of new shades and colors."

_A. G. Porter._ "Flowers of a beautiful lavender color, delicately
suffused with a light shade of rosy pink, and handsomely veined with
magenta, forming a flower of magnificent color and shape, a very free
bloomer. A cross between _Boule de Neige_ and _Rosaflora_, with the
habit and growth of _Boule de Neige_."

_Little Beauty_, "A very dwarf grower, having a short, compact,
symmetrical bush, which is completely covered with its medium-sized but
well-shaped flowers, of a very light salmon color, beautifully veined
with rosy carmine. It blooms in clusters and when in full bloom makes a
remarkably fine appearance. A cross between _Rosaflora_ and _Darwinii_."

_N. B. Stover_, "A low, compact grower. Flowers large and well-formed,
almost covering the bush; color, rich ponceau, finely veined with
carmine. A decided novelty, being a new color among Abutilons."

_Dr. Rapples._ "Light orange salmon, veined with crimson. One of the
most attractive in the set."

A new Abutilon, a decided novelty in color, comes to us from "The Home
for Flowers," Swanley, England, sent with other choice plants by Henry
Cannell & Son. It is thus described in his _Floral Guide_:

FIREFLY (Swanley Red). By far the highest and brightest color of all
the family; habit dwarf, and one of the freest bloomers, throwing
flowers out on strong foot stalks of the finest shape; certainly one of
the noblest, and when grown in a pot it flowers all the winter, and all
the summer when planted out, and forms one of the best flowering shrubs
that we possess.

PARENTAGE OF THIS FLOWER.--Mr. George states that he sometime since
flowered a small red variety, which had a very lively shade of color,
and determining to make this a seed parent, it occurred to him to use on
it the pollen of the single deep color Hibiscas, which, like the
Abutilon, is included in the natural order _Malvaceæ_. Mr. George thinks
the fine color seen in his new variety, _Firefly_, is due to this happy
inspiration of color.

The _Gardener's Chronicle_ has this paragraph respecting Firefly: A red
Abutilon, one of a batch of recent seedlings raised by Mr. J. George of
Putney Heath, well deserves the foregoing appellation. The flowers are
of large size and of a much greater depth and vividness of color than
that possessed by any variety in the Chiswick collection. It has been
provisionally named Firefly, and we believe the stock has passed into
the hands of H. Cannell & Son, of Swanley, for distribution.

A writer in _Vick's Magazine_ describes a method of training the
Abutilon that must, we think, be a very attractive one.

"A pretty plant may be obtained by inarching Abutilon Mesopotamicum upon
_Abutilon Darwinii_, or some other strong-growing variety, and training
it so as form an umbrella head, which can easily be done. The stock for
this purpose should be about five or six feet high. Grown in this way it
produces an abundance of bloom, and the flowers being elevated are seen
in all their beauty. If _Abutilon Mesopotamicum_ is inarched upon
_Abutilon Thompsonii_, the result will be _Abutilon Mesopotamicum
Variegatum_. A well-formed plant of this on a stock about five feet high
is one of the finest of plants; whether in blossom or not it is always
adapted for decorative or exhibition purposes. Care must be taken at
all times to keep them tied to stakes, as they are liable to be broken
off by the wind."

Abutilons are apt to be infested by the red spider, if kept in too dry
an atmosphere, and not frequently sprayed. Moisture is death to this
pest, but as it makes its home on the under side of the leaf, it is too
often overlooked until it has destroyed the vitality of the foliage.
Recently I found that my large _Duc de Malakoff_ looked sickly, and I
concluded it had become root-bound. A few days later, I noticed brown
spots thickly covering the bark. I removed one, and on examining the
under side through a microscope, I saw several tiny insects moving
about. I decided that my plant was troubled with the scale of which I
had often read, but never seen. I made a pretty strong solution of
soap-suds, and with a sponge quite easily removed all of the pests.

In bedding out Abutilons, it is better to have them in pots, plugging
the hole, or setting the pot on a stone or piece of brick, so that the
roots may not go astray, for if plunged directly in the ground they
throw out many roots and the plant becomes too large for re-potting to
advantage. If, however, they are planted in the earth, in August they
should be cut around the stock so as to bring the roots within due
bounds, and the plant can be pruned in the autumn. This method is
applicable to all strong plants that run largely to roots. They should
be cut off sufficiently to leave only a ball of earth of convenient size
to set in the pot when the plant is transplanted.






The genus Dahlia comprises but few species, all natives of the mountains
of Mexico, whose range is from 5000 to 10,000 feet above the level of
the sea. About one hundred years ago a Spanish botanist introduced seeds
of the Dahlia into his native country, and named the genus in honor of a
Swedish botanist, DAHL. The first seed imported seemed to be variable
and not very promising. About seventy years since, HUMBOLDT sent fresh
seed to Germany. Soon after this, both seeds and bulbs were introduced
into England and France, and began to attract considerable attention,
some enthusiast being rash enough to hazard the assertion that "there
are considerable reasons for thinking that the Dahlia will hereafter be
raised with double flowers."

About 1812 probably the first double Dahlia was grown, but for several
years after this both double and single varieties were figured in
colored plates, and exhibited at horticultural shows. That the single
varieties were prized is not strange, for the double were not very good,
and even as late as 1818, published figures showed very imperfect
flowers.

The improvement of the Dahlia after this was rapid, and its popularity
quite kept pace with its improvement. Dahlia exhibitions were held in
England and on the continent, which were crowded by enthusiastic
admirers of this wonderful Mexican flower. For many years the Dahlia
maintained its popularity, but there is a fashion in flowers, as in
almost everything, and for a time the Dahlia became, to a certain
extent, unfashionable, and this was well; for it placed the flower upon
merit alone, and growers were compelled to introduce new and superior
varieties to command either attention or sale for their favorite
flower.

A taste for old styles is now the "correct thing," and so we have
imitations of ancient earthenware, furniture, etc., and import
_original_ Chinese Aster seed, and also obtain roots of the single
Dahlia from Mexico.

There are three pretty distinct classes, the _Show_ Dahlias, the Dwarf
or Bedding, and the _Pompon_ or Bouquet, and to this we may add the
_Fancy_ Dahlia. The _Show Dahlia_ grows from three to four feet in
height, and embraces all our finest sorts, fit for exhibition at
horticultural shows, from which the name is derived; the flowers range
in size from two and a half to five inches in diameter. The striped and
mottled and spotted varieties belonging to the Show section are called
_Fancy_, and though not as rich, nor usually as highly prized as the
selfs, or those of one color, are very attractive. The _Dwarf_ or
_Bedding Dahlia_ grows about eighteen inches in height, and makes a
thick, compact bush, and covers a good deal of surface; flowers of the
size of Show Dahlias. They are therefore very desirable for bedding and
massing. The _Pompon_ or _Bouquet Dahlia_ makes a pretty, compact plant,
about three feet in height. The leaves are small, and the flowers from
one to two inches in diameter. Many expect to find small flowers on
their Dwarf Dahlias, and feel disappointed because they are of the
ordinary size, not knowing that it is the plant, and not the flower,
that is dwarfed, and that only the Pompon gives the small flowers. The
word _Pompon_ is French for topknot or trinket, meaning about the same
as the English word cockade. The English term _Bouquet_ is very
appropriate, as the flowers are so small they are very suitable for
bouquets. Being of a spreading habit, they cover a good deal of ground.
Unlike most of our bedding out plants, they do best in a poor soil; if
rich, they grow to branches and leaves so much, they bloom sparingly and
late.

Generally those who plant Dahlias purchase the tuberous roots, because
they give good strong plants, that flower freely without trouble or
risk. They are smaller and better than the large, coarse roots usually
grown, because they are raised from cuttings, and generally form their
roots in pots. When a tuber is planted, a number of buds that cluster
around its top will push and form shoots, and if too numerous, a portion
should be removed; indeed, one good, strong plant will suffice, and then
the plant will become a tree instead of a bush. Even then, if the top
become too thick, a little thinning of the branches will be of
advantage. If the young shoots that start from the neck of the bulb, are
cut off near a joint and placed in a hot-bed in sandy soil, they will
root, form good plants, and flower quite as well as plants grown from
the tuber; this, however, requires some care and experience, and
amateurs generally will succeed best with bulbs.

New varieties of Dahlias, of course, are from seed. Some of them prove
good, others fair, and a portion utterly worthless. As a general rule,
we would not advise amateurs to trouble with seeds, although there is
pleasure in watching the birth and development of a new and beautiful
variety.

The seed of Dahlias may be sown in pots in early spring or end of
winter, in a light, loamy soil; they will germinate quickly, and as soon
as they begin to show their second leaves they should be pricked out
into other pots or boxes, so that they may have plenty of room and
air--they are very liable to damp off if at all crowded. After pricking
out they should be kept in a thrifty, growing condition, by proper
attention to watering and temperature; the temperature should be
maintained as near 70° as possible, and the watering be sufficient to
preserve a moderate moisture.

If the green fly attack them, it will be best to treat them to a very
weak dilution of tobacco water; the young succulent plants are very
sensitive to smoke, and it is best not to fumigate them. In about two
months the young plants should be large enough to pot off singly, or to
be transplanted into a frame or bed, where protection can be given them
from the cold of night-time, or from late frosts. As soon as all danger
is past they can be transplanted into their summer quarters, and should
stand at least three feet apart. The soil where they are to grow, should
be rich and mellow. In August they will come into flower, and those
having blooms worthy of cultivation can be retained, and the others
destroyed. Only a small proportion of the plants grown from common seed
produce flowers equal to those now in cultivation, but when seed is
saved from a choice collection of named varieties, the chances are that
a large proportion of the plants will produce very good
flowers.--_Vick's Magazine._

"The Dahlia is called a _gross feeder_, but it is not. It loves moisture
rather than rich elemental food. In clay it finds the best constituents
of its development--moisture, silex, lime and alumnia. So we say to
those who love this queenly flower, if you would see the queen in all
her glory, plant in a comparatively heavy soil, no manure, and reduce
the stalks to one for each tuber, set the stakes firmly, to keep the
stalks from swaying, and if the season is dry, give the bulbs a
_soaking_ with water every evening during the drought. My word for it
you will then be proud of your success."

The Pompon, or Bouquet Dahlia is a favorite variety of this genus. The
little round balls of bloom are so pretty and trim. _Beatrice_, blush
tinted with violet; _Dr. Stein_, deep maroon, striped and mottled;
_Goldfinder_, golden yellow; _Little Philip_, creamy-buff edged with
lilac; _Little Valentine_, crimson; _Mein Streifling_, salmon, striped
with crimson; _Pearl_, white; _Prima Donna_, white, fimbriated;
_Perfection_, deep maroon.



Anything for a change from the common order of things, seems to be the
fashion now-a-days, in flowers as well as in house building and house
furnishing. The antique, the antique, is the rage! So after years of
labor and hybridization to bring the Dahlia up from its native state of
single blessedness, to its enormous cauliflower blooms, there comes a
reaction, and now single Dahlias are praised as "the most beautiful of
all flowers," the "_par excellence_ the Londoner's flower!" Well, let
the English florists thus praise its beauty if they want to, but we
opine that on this side of the great ocean it will never be considered
"the most beautiful of all flowers," however attractive some of them may
be, and well adapted for bouquets. There is no danger of their
superseding the doubles, but it is well to have both when one can afford
it; their present high price puts them beyond the reach of those whose
purses are not well filled, but in a year or two, when the novelty is
worn off, they can be purchased at half or even less, perhaps, than
their present price.

We find in the London _Garden_ the following: "Dahlia perfecta,
originally introduced by Messrs. Henderson, is perhaps the finest flower
which we possess, unless Paragon, brought into notice by H. Cannell, may
be considered to bear away the palm. Lutea, a quilled yellow, is also a
grand bouquet flower."

The single Dahlias, Paragon and Lutea, are now offered for the first
time in this country, by Messrs. Hallock & Thorp of Queens, N. Y., and
the former is finely illustrated in their catalogue. Color very dark
velvety maroon with shadings of bright scarlet around each petal; small
yellow disk. Lutea is pure yellow, with dark orange center. The same
firm offer Dahlia Juarezii, of which Mr. Cannell says: "The grandest
novelty of the year, and not only a novelty, but a most valuable and
useful decorative plant for all purposes through the late summer and
autumn months. Its blossoms are of a rich crimson, and very much
resemble in shape and color the well-known Cactus, Cereus
_speciosissimus_. Height about three feet, very bushy flowers of very
striking appearance and quite unlike those of an ordinary double Dahlia,
the flowerets being flat and not cupped. Figured in _Gardener's
Chronicle_ October 4th, 1879, and awarded a Botanical Certificate Royal
Horticultural Society."



"A remarkable box of Dahlias was shown by Messrs. Cannell with three or
four of the single forms, which, if it were not heresy to say so, we
should so much prefer to the formal lumps so dear to the florist proper;
and then there was a new type of Dahlia altogether, a Sea Anemone among
Dahlias, with long crimson scarlet pointed petals, like the tentacles of
an Antinia--a striking novelty, christened temporarily the Cactus
Dahlia, and which will be the parent of a new strain. It received a
Botanical Certificate; some said this ought to have a higher award, but
what higher or more appropriate form of a certificate could be given to
such a flower. If we were a Dahlia, we should greatly prefer the honor
of a 'Botanical,' to that of a 'First Class Certificate.'"

This new type is illustrated in Hallock & Thorp's Catalogue.

Two new Dahlias not yet introduced in this country are included among
the novelties of 1881. _Cannell's Scarlet_, a Show Dahlia, several
shades higher and brighter in color than any scarlet before introduced.
"Its shape is most model-like, and not excelled by any other, and is
without doubt the best Dahlia of the year." _Miss Cannell_,
(Eckford)--"Mr. Eckford's Dahlia, Memorial, was the king of best shapes
for many years, but the one now offered is of greater excellence, and by
far the best of its class; color white, tipped with rose-pink, and the
depth and build of flower is most model-like."




These are the finest of all summer flowering bulbs, throwing up strong
flower stems in June and July, bearing from two to six magnificent
lily-like blossoms. The varieties are numerous, but only a few sorts are
found catalogued. Amaryllis Johnsonii is the finest of the commonly
grown varieties. Its leaves are a dark rich green, two inches broad, and
two feet long. The flowers which are five or six inches long, are
crimson with a white stripe through the center of each petal, and are
borne upon a stalk two feet high. They usually bloom twice a year, the
flowers appearing just as the leaves begin to grow.

Amaryllis formosissima is of a very peculiar form. The flowers are
scarlet-crimson, very velvety in appearance; there are six petals, three
of them nearly erect, and three drooping very long. After being bedded
out, it quickly throws up a flower stalk and blooms before the leaves
appear. It is a superb flower, known sometimes by the name of Jacobean
Lily. Amaryllis vittata is a splendid hybrid, red ground striped with
white. Amaryllis Valotta purpurea is an evergreen variety, and should be
kept growing the year round. In August it throws up a flower-stem from
one foot to eighteen inches high, bearing a cluster of light scarlet
flowers two or three inches in diameter. A light soil and small pot
suits it best. Mr. John Lewis Child of Queens, N. Y., has a finer
collection and more numerous varieties than are usually found named in
the catalogues. Some of them we will specify. Johnsonii Grandiflora, an
improvement on the well-known Johnsonii Harrisoni, large, pure white,
with double crimson streaks running through each petal. It has a
delicious, orange-blossom fragrance. Reticulata, a bright rose color,
the foliage is very attractive--dark green with a white stripe running
through the center of each leaf. Aulica Stenopelalon, a magnificent
species, having large orange crimson flowers, beautifully veined with
scarlet. "Equestre fl. pl. This grand novelty was discovered in 1877, in
one of the West India Islands. The flowers are perfectly double,
resembling those of a large Camellia. Its color is rich, fiery orange
red. We believe we have the only stock of this beautiful flower in
America." JOHN L. CHILD.

This and Harrisoni, are priced at $4.50, so they must be very rare and
beautiful. Aspasie, white, tinted with yellow and red; large and
perfect. Crinum Amænum, new and very beautiful, white-striped crimson.
Lutea, a hardy variety, which blooms in the autumn; pure yellow.
Calafornica, pure white.

The bulbs are of easy culture. After blooming, and the foliage fully
grown, they should be allowed to rest for several months, then start
into growth by watering sparingly until the flower stalks appear, when a
more liberal supply should be given. Usually two successions of bloom
can thus be obtained. The bulb should be planted so as to leave the
upper portion uncovered.



This plant is a native of tropical Asia, where it is partially
parasitical, its roots penetrating the bark of the trees which support
it. It was introduced into England in 1802. There are several species,
but only one is generally cultivated. Hoya Carnosa has thick waxy
leaves, and bears umbels of beautiful flesh-colored flowers which are
very wax-like in appearance. It is an excellent plant for house culture
as it stands the extremes of heat and cold better than most plants, and
is not easily injured by neglect. It can be trained to climb on
trellis-work to almost any height, and when in bloom, which continues
for half the year, it is a very interesting plant.

There are several varieties of Hoya, but one only is generally
cultivated. _Silver Variegated Foliage_ is said to be very handsome but
is of slow growth and difficult to propagate. _Imperialis_ is a new
variety with beautiful foliage and scarlet flowers. _Cunningham_ has
light green leaves, deeper colored flowers than the Carnosa and is a
rapid grower.

They succeed best in peat, with some fibrous soil and sand. They must
have perfect drainage, and require a period of rest. Hoya Carnosa is
easily propagated from cuttings. A very good method is to wrap a cutting
in moss, keeping it moist until the roots are well started.






August is the month when we rest from our labor in gardening, and
abandon ourselves to the full enjoyment of the varied blossoms which so
abundantly meet our eye. Now we can best determine what changes may be
required in the arrangement of our plants next year, in order to give
the most pleasing effect. A tall plant may have been inadvertently set
out in the midst of those of low growth, and we see now how awkward it
looks. Short-lived annuals may have occupied a conspicuous place, and on
their departure left an unseemly vacancy. A bed may have been filled
with a class of plants that are not free bloomers, and so there has been
little beside leaves, while another bed has been brilliant during all
the summer months with flowers. Annuals of a new kind, high-priced
novelties, have been tested; are they any better than our old favorites?
If we cannot indulge in many sorts, what do we find the most
satisfactory? Twenty-five cents per packet seemed very expensive for
Heddewigii Pinks, but Crimson Belle and Eastern Queen are of such
superior size and rare beauty that the investment is not regretted, and
then we know that they will bloom in greater perfection next year, and
that the seed saved this autumn and sown in early spring, will increase
the stock. Twenty-five cents for a paper of Candytuft seed looks
extravagant, but no one who invests in Tom Thumb would regret it. It is
so dwarf, so compact and bushy, such a long continued bloomer, so
admirable for edging a bed, that it is really almost an essential. Then
it will sow itself, and the seedlings will be up as soon as the frost is
out of the ground, and plants from self-sown seed are so much more
thrifty and early than those one sows in the spring, that this is a
great gain.

Candytuft--white, pink, light purple, dark purple and crimson, I find it
well worth while to culture for early and profuse flowers, and admirably
adapted for bouquets. I always have large quantities of the white, to
set off the brighter flowers, and by sowing seed in June and July, have
a succession of blooming plants. Foxglove, both white and purple, with
their thimble-shaped spotted blossoms profusely borne on tall spikes,
with side branches loaded with bloom, has been one of the greatly
admired flowers of my garden. Plumbago, with its clusters of tube
flowers, of the palest of blue, is very beautiful. Godetia, "Lady
Albemarle," I have found to be all that it is represented. For two
months it has been in constant bloom, and it will continue to flower
till frost. It is of a bushy, compact habit, about twelve inches high,
the flowers are from three to four inches in diameter, and of a
rosy-carmine color. Everybody who has seen it, has a word of praise for
this most beautiful of all the Godetias. _Alba_ is a new variety, having
pure white flowers; _Insignis_ is pure white with a crimson blotch on
each petal; _Whitney's_ is of dwarf habit, and has large flowers,
blush-colored, marked about the center with a handsome crimson stain.
The new French Marigolds "Cloth of Gold," and "Meteor" are just splendid
with their large and beautifully striped imbricated leaves. One has gold
bars evenly marked on the rich dark velvety petals, and the other has
deep orange stripes on a pale straw-colored, almost white ground.
"Meteor" is a perfect gem among the Calendulas.

Convolvulus minor--new crimson-violet with yellow eye encircled with a
band of pure white; dark blue and light blue with yellow eye margined
with white; pure white with yellow eye, and blue and white striped, are
very pretty free-blooming dwarfs of this species.

My Stocks are very fine, from mixed seed of the German, new large
flowering. They are mostly very double. The creamy white are especially
beautiful. The bright crimson and canary yellow are handsome. There are
many varieties of this species, but what are generally termed Ten-weeks
Stock are best known. They are classed under five heads: Dwarf,
Miniature, Large-flowered, Pyramidal and Wall-flower-leaved. Then there
are the Intermediate Stocks, prized for their late autumn blooming, of
which there are twelve or more varieties. The German Brompton Stocks are
divided into two sections; Brompton and Hybrid, or Cocordean. The latter
bloom with a single stem which forms a splendid pyramid of flowers, and
is cultivated largely in pots. Seeds sown in early spring will bloom in
autumn, and if carefully potted will flower during winter; if sown in
July and August, and cultivated in pots will flower the following spring
and summer. The Imperial or Emperor stocks, sometimes called Perpetual,
are large flowering, and white, rose, crimson and blood-red in color.

"Hardy's All-the-Year-Round," is a perpetual bloomer. The plants grow
about twelve inches high, and produce hundreds of bunches of double
white flowers.

Let us linger a little while at this rose bed. Are not those Teas
lovely? Look at Madame Lambard, one of the finest French roses imported
recently from Paris. Is not the color exquisite--a beautiful shade of
silver bronze, changing to salmon and fawn, delicately shaded with
carmine rose. And so deliciously fragrant! That rose so large and full,
with a rare shade of violet red, brightened with crimson maroon, is
Aline Sisley. It is surprising how such a tiny plant could have produced
such an immense flower! And this is Letty Coles, a new French rose, very
handsome and sweet; color rosy-pink, deeply shaded with intense crimson.
Perle des Jardins is magnificent with its rich golden yellow, and Bon
Silene has long been a special favorite. Its buds are large and
beautiful. That charming white so deliciously scented is Mademoiselle
Rachel, and this one with pure deep green flowers is Verdiflora, or
Green Rose, scentless, and of no value except as a curiosity.

This grand rose is Abel Carriere, a hybrid perpetual more beautiful I
think than the popular Jacqueminot in the perfectness of its form, and
richness of its color. The outer petals are bright glowing
crimson-scarlet, while the center is a deep fiery red. But it will never
do to linger longer among the sweet roses, for there are many other
flowers to show you.

I think that Hydrangea, with its immense trusses of bloom, is just one
of the most desirable shrubs we can have in the garden. I have had mine
six or seven years, and it bore three clusters of flowers the first
year, though a wee plant. It blooms from August till hard frost, and
needs no protection in the winter, though I do sometimes put a mulching
of straw or a bit of brush around the roots. A lady writing to _Vick's
Magazine_ says of this Hydrangea: "The first year I planted _Hydrangea
Grandiflora_ it produced three heads of flowers, the second, fifty-six,
and the third year ninety-two. Thorough cultivation and a pail of liquid
manure once a week, helped the plant to bear this enormous load of
flowers."

Hydrangea _Alaska_ is a more recent acquisition. Its flowers frequently
measure twelve inches across, and are of a bright pink color, not hardy
at the North. _Hydrangea Thomas Hogg_ would be a very unpoetical name
did it not remind one of "The Ettrick Shepherd." This variety was sent
to the United States from Japan, by that eminent botanist for whom it is
named, and has become deservedly popular. It belongs to the Hortensia
section of the family, but is a far more abundant bloomer than any
other. The flowers are of the purest white, of very firm texture, and
retain their beauty for a long time.

A more recent novelty sent from Japan by Mr. Hogg, is the "New Climbing
Hydrangea," which he describes as clinging to trees to the height of
fifty feet, producing corymbs of white flowers of the size of ordinary
Hydrangeas. It clings exactly like the Ivy, and must produce a striking
effect when in full bloom. It is entirely hardy. Mr. Peter Henderson was
the first to offer this novelty here and in Europe. _Elegantissima_ is a
novelty truly with its leaves flaked, bordered and striped with golden
yellow. I do not know whether it blossoms or not, it is handsome enough
without flowers.



The new Heliotrope _Le Negre_ is the darkest of this genus, and _Snow
Wreath_ the nearest approach to white we have yet had; truss very large,
growth compact, and fragrance exquisite. _Garibaldi_ is almost white;
_Mrs. Burgess_ is dark violet, and _Duc de Lavendury_ is a rich blue,
dark eye.


Sweet Alyssum is another of the essential flowers for the border,
admirable for edgings, for its dwarf habit and continuity of bloom. The
great novelty of last year was the new double variegated Sweet
Alyssum--"The Gem." The flowers are very full, and the foliage broad
with a mid-rib of light green, bordered on each side with pure white. It
is a fine, compact grower, and far superior to anything of this species
yet offered.

Lantanas, I think, add greatly to the attractions of the garden, so rich
in color and profuse in blooming. _Clotilda_, pink with yellow center,
and _Comtesse de Diencourt_, flower bright rose and yellow center
sulphur, are very desirable. _Alba perfecta_, pure white, is fine, so
also is _Alba lutea grandiflora_, white with yellow center. _Mine d'Or_
is a new variety, with bright orange and crimson flowers, and golden
variegated foliage. _M. Schmidt_ is a beautiful novelty. Flowers of a
brilliant yellow, passing into purple vermilion; grows in the style of a
Petunia.






Next to Primroses, and by no means below them in value, we place the
Cyclamen. The leaves, a deep green with white embroidery, are very
ornamental, but when surmounted with a wealth of bloom, what can be more
charming? Two of mine have begun to blossom--a white and a pink--and the
buds are numerous. Others will bloom later. They continue in bloom for a
long period, and are easy of culture, though where there is over-dryness
of atmosphere, they are apt to be infested with the red spider. They
need to be frequently sprayed and it is well to immerse occasionally the
entire plant in water so as to wet the under surface of the leaves. The
water ought to be tepid, and indeed for all plants in cold weather. To
keep the dirt from falling out when the plant is plunged top downward,
something can be wrapped around the pot. A mixture of turfy loam and
sandy peat is best, but when not available, leaf mold or a rich mellow
soil mixed with silver sand will do.

There are several varieties of Cyclamen, but the most common is
_persicum_, and many catalogues name no other. One of mine is
_gigantium_, an improvement on _persicum_, the flowers being much larger
and finer in every respect. Among many catalogues I find this named in
only one. _Persicum_, white and pink, is a sweet scented variety from
Cyprus; _Africanum_, white and rose, from Africa; _hederæfolium_, from
Britain. Other rare and expensive sorts are _Atkinsii_, white, crimson
and rose colored; _Europeum_, red, and _Coum_, which in the early spring
months bears above its very ornamental leaves "a profusion of small
bright, rosy, crimson and snow-white turbinate blossoms of a roundish
recurved outline, blotched with violet-crimson at the base, very
beautiful."

The bulbs of all Cyclamens, except _Coum_, should be placed on the
surface of the soil, covered half an inch, and water given moderately
till the leaves are fully developed, and the flowers appear, when it may
be applied more liberally. Do not make a mistake and plant your bulb
upside down as did a lady I know of. "I have an idea that it is put in
wrong, as the leaves seem to come from the under side," she writes. It
is difficult to tell sometimes which is the right side to put down.

_Persicum_, with its dappled green and silvery gray, rounded,
heart-shaped leaves, embroidered margins, is a fine ornament, but when
these are surmounted with a profusion of pure silvery white oblong
lanceolate petals, blotched with violet-crimson at their base, borne on
slender flower-scopes, the plant is very beautiful. It varies in color
from snow-white delicate peach and rosy crimson. Some are delightfully
fragrant. During the growing and flowering season the plant should have
a full exposure to the light, but not to the intense sunshine. After
blooming, the bulbs may be allowed a time of rest, removing them to a
cool and shady place in the border, if desired, watering rarely. In
early autumn repot, and after a few weeks of growth, water more freely.
It does not, however, injure the plant to keep it constantly growing,
and the best florists have very generally abandoned their former method
of letting them rest during the summer. _Cyclamen autumnale flore alba_,
white, and _rubra_, red, blossom in the autumn.



The winter blooming varieties are admirably adapted for hanging-pots,
and being cheap and very easy of cultivation, they ought to be in every
dwelling. There are one hundred and fifty known varieties, though our
catalogues rarely name half-a-dozen. Some are strictly winter bloomers,
others flower only in summer, and some blossom the year round. The
_floribunda_ varieties belong to this class of perpetuals. _Ortgiesi_
also, which is a wonderful bloomer, and on account of its erect growth,
is admirably adapted for pot culture. It is a new and somewhat rare
species from Brazil. It often grows eighteen inches high, and in good
form. The upper side of the leaf is rich olive green, and the under side
bright violet purple. The flowers are quite small, yellow, and borne in
clusters. The special beauty is in the foliage.

_Floribunda alba_ and _rosea_ have tuberous roots. The foliage is very
strong, and the clusters of bloom are borne on long foot-stalks starting
directly from the tuber. A single small tuber will often have a hundred
open flowers at a time. They are from one-half to three-quarters of an
inch in diameter. This variety can be obtained and planted at any time
of the year. It is admirably adapted for baskets or a hanging-pot.

_Oxalis acetocella_ is the true shamrock of Ireland. Flowers are white,
borne on stalks two to four inches high. _Versicolor_ is a winter
bloomer; color white, with bright pink margins to the petals; requires
sunshine; the flowers will not expand in cloudy weather. _Floribunda_
has no such freaks, but smiles in the storm, as well as the sunshine. A
lady writing to Mr. Vick becomes enthusiastic over her Oxalis. She says:
"The sixth of last October I planted a bulb of _Oxalis versicolor_, and
it is just beginning to bloom. And oh! what lovely flowers; delicate and
perfect in form, pure white, with just the faintest tinge of yellow in
the center, and beautiful crimson stripes on the outside. The plant also
is of a very graceful habit, bearing its tuft of small leaves, and
clusters of flowers on the top of a short, slender stem. It seems
strange that so small a bulb can produce such beautiful flowers."

Of _Bowii_ she thus writes: "A year ago last October I planted a bulb of
_Oxalis Bowii_ in a small bed. The bulb was so very small that I did not
believe the flowers could amount to much, but was soon most agreeably
disappointed. Such a mass of flowers on one small plant I had never seen
before, and such large, bright-colored flowers! Many stopped to admire
it, and ask its name. It continued to produce a mass of flowers the
entire winter and part of the spring, until the sun became very hot.
From this one bulb I obtained eight, which I wrapped in paper and kept
in a dry place. About the first of August they commenced growing, and so
I planted them, and the first of September they were in full bloom,
though the flower grew large as the days became less hot, until they
were nearly as large as Petunias. The soil in which they grew was mostly
sand and rich surface earth from the woods, and I sometimes watered them
with weak soap-suds."

Mr. Vick, to whom we are indebted for the most of our information on
this subject, says that this variety has large, thick, fleshy leaves,
and large, bright, rose-colored flowers, the largest, indeed, of any of
the cultivated kinds.

In his illustrated article he gives an engraving of one named _Cernuus
plena_, the flowers of which resemble double Portulacas; erect, borne in
clusters. We regret that he gives no reference to this variety whatever.
It must be a rare sort, probably not in the market here.






"CONSIDER THE LILIES."

Thus spake one wiser than Solomon, even He whose hand created and
beautified the Lilies with a glory surpassing that of the greatest of
Israel's kings.

This department of the Floral kingdom is too vast for us to explore; we
can only make a selection of a few of the numerous varieties for
consideration, gathering our information from the various sources at
hand, and adapting it to our present use.

The Lily is the rival of the Rose, and by many is considered far
superior. They certainly are far more easily cultivated. They are hardy,
elegant, gorgeous sometimes, and sometimes of snowy purity. Many of them
are of exquisite fragrance. There are early and late bloomers, and one
can have these desirable flowers in succession for several months, by a
right selection. The earliest bloomers are the _Pomponiums_, natives of
Siberia, and are perfectly hardy. The _Lancifolium_ or _Speciosum_ is
the autumn blooming Lily, native of Japan. _Lancifolium Album_, a fine
sort, with pure white petals and a pea-green stripe, very fragrant.
_Lancifolium Rubrum_, and _Roseum_, though catalogued separately, are
the same with different shadings. Some purplish crimson, others a faint
blush of rose. Some have a red stripe, others a dark dull green, but all
are specially recommended. _Lancifolium Punctatum verum_ is a late
bloomer; color, clear white with soft rose spots and green stripes.
Finest of the species, _Lancifolium Praecox_; flowers white with a
purplish-blush at the tips. _Lancifolium Monstrosum_ or _Corymbiflorum
rubrum_, bears its crimson flowers in large clusters. Grows to a great
size.

The Lancifolium Lilies are of special value for their hardiness and
varied beauty, and their cheapness places them within general reach.
They are classed under the head of MARTAGONS, or TURKS CAP.


_Auratum Imperial_ is the Golden-banded-Lily of Japan which has become
so extensively known and popular since its introduction from Japan by
Mr. Gordon Dexter. It was first exhibited in July 1862, at the
Massachusetts Horticultural Exhibition. It first bloomed in England same
year. It was for sometime considered too tender for the Canadas and New
England states, but it proved to be hardy. We have had ours twelve
years, and give it only a slight protection. The petals of the Auratum
are snowy white with a golden band running down the center of each, and
freely spotted on the sides with deep carmine red. They are very
fragrant. Being of somewhat slender growth, they need support. It does
best in a warm sandy soil that has been well manured and dug deeply. It
is easily propagated from the scales of the bulbs, each scale producing
a small bulbet. They should be planted in a box about a foot deep, in
good friable soil about three inches deep, and one inch apart. Sink the
box in some out of the way place in the garden, and water frequently. In
a short time small bulbs will be found forming on the base, which
rapidly grow, and must be transplanted out the second year in the bed;
the third or fourth year it will bloom. The little bulbets which form on
the mother bulb blossom a year earlier. They should be renewed in the
fall, after the foliage is dead. Plant in a bed about four inches deep,
and let them remain undisturbed for two years; then they are large
enough to bloom and should be transplanted into a permanent bed, if
required.




These trumpet-shaped Lilies are charming in appearance, quite hardy and
fragrant. They bloom in July or August, and continue in beauty for a
long time.

Longiflorum _Japonicum_ blooms in July, and is a fine dwarf bedder;
color pure white, with occasionally a greenish tinge outside. Increases
rapidly. _Eximium_ bears a longer flower, from six to nine inches in
length, and is more open at the mouth than the common Longiflorum. Pure
white and very fragrant. _Brownii_ is a native of Japan, and is a grand
Lily of rare beauty. It resembles Longiflorum in shape, but is larger
and more expanding; color white inside, exterior brownish-purple;
stamens rich chocolate, which forms a distinctive feature in this
species. It has been frequently confounded with _Japonicum_, but the
difference is very marked in the illustrations of the two, and are thus
noted in Messrs. Hallock & Thorp's "Catalogue of Lilies."

"JAPONICUM (_Odorum, Japonicum Colchesterii_). One of the most beautiful
and rarest Lilies in cultivation. It differs from Brownii and all the
forms of Longiflorum in many respects. Note the following marked
differences: Its broader, fewer and more spreading leaves, the shape of
the entire flower and broader claw of its divisions, its shorter anthers
with pollen tinged with red. The flower is solitary and large, interior
pure white, exterior of a pinkish-brown color, tubular, bell-shaped,
with spreading revolute tips; the bud shows a rich golden tint. Bulb
white, or whitish-yellow, never red or brown, broad at the base, the
scales which are somewhat narrow and acute at the tip, the outer ones
terminate at about two-thirds of the height of the inner scales, whereas
in Brownii the scales are broad, and all pass up, overlapping, and
terminate together at the apex of the bulb, thus making the base much
narrower than the apex."

It is a native of Japan, and is so exceedingly rare that it is priced at
$7.00, more than double the cost of any other in the list. Brownii was
priced, when a novelty at $4.00, but is now offered for $1.75.


_Candidum_, sometimes called Easter Lily, is one of the best known and
commonly grown of all the Lilies. It has been in cultivation for about
three hundred years. Bears a profusion of pure white fragrant flowers in
a compact head.

The double _Tiger Lily_ is a very great improvement on the old single
variety. It is very double, and very showy. _Wallacei_ is a new Japanese
variety, said to be magnificent; color, buff, spotted with black.

_Chalcedonicum_ or _Scarlet Martagon_ is supposed to be the "Lily of the
field" mentioned in the Gospel. "It is magnificent, and its intense
scarlet is one of the finest shades in the whole vegetable kingdom. A
full bed is a most magnificent sight, and if suddenly looked at on a
bright day, has nearly the same effect for a moment as if looking at the
sun. It is much scarcer than it should be, and requires careful culture,
to be planted about six or eight inches deep, and watered in the summer
time. It pleases every one who is capable of being pleased."

Lilies, as well as many other bloomers, are greatly improved by
thinning out the overplus, thus concentrating the sap to fewer blossoms,
which being thus liberally nourished, greatly increase in size, and
amply repay, by their superiority, for the loss in numbers. Although
this is a demonstrated fact, yet few have the courage to prune where
flowers are not very abundant, and many will not when they are.

Those who have limited space are loth to devote much room to Lilies,
preferring plants that bloom continually throughout the season, or that
make more show. But it is not essential that the bed should be devoted
exclusively to lilies. For early spring blooming there can be the
Crocuses, Snowdrops, Hyacinths, Tulips, all of which will bloom before
the lilies, and after flowering can be taken up, i.e., the Tulips and
Hyacinths, and low bedding plants take their places. Portulaca, Pansy,
Ageratum, Mignonnette, Nemophila, Sweet Alyssum, are all suitable for
this purpose, and will not only make the bed beautiful all the season
with their blossoms, but will also be of real benefit to the Lilies by
shading their roots somewhat, and keeping the soil more cool and moist.

Lilies must never be crowded; a foot or twenty inches is about right.
The soil should be dug deep and mixed with old rotted manure and sand
liberally, unless the soil is naturally sandy; if heavy, clayey soil, it
ought to have in addition to sharp sand, leaf mold and bog muck. Plant
the bulbs from six to eight inches deep, according to the size. Last
autumn, in planting my Lily, Tulip, Hyacinth, and other bulbs, I made a
little bed for each of pure sand, and then covered well with soil, over
which was put a blanket of old dressing, then, before snow, a covering
of boughs. The bulbs never came up so grandly, nor grew so rapidly
before. October is the best month for bedding out, later will do, and
many do not plant their Lilies till the frost is out in the spring.

The two leading Lily growers of this country are John L. Child and V. H.
Hallock & Thorp, of Queens, N. Y.




This is indeed a novelty among this class of valuable plants, being the
first double ever known. It is said to be equal if not superior, in
profuse blooming quality, and vigorous, healthy growth, to the single
white variety, _Davidsonii_, of which it is a sport. The flowers are
rather larger than those of the single flowering, and composed of three
perfect rows of petals, of the purest waxy white color, each floweret
resembling a miniature Tuberose. The trusses are large and perfect, and
are freely and without interruption produced, even on the small side
shoots, which generally make no flowers on the single one. It is highly
praised by Mr. Thomas Meehan, florist and editor of the _Gardeners'
Monthly_, and by Mr. Henry A. Dreer, florist, of Philadelphia. "A grand
thing," says Mr. Meehan. "Gives great satisfaction. It has excelled our
expectation," says Mr. Dreer.

My own specimen, about four inches in height, has twelve buds; two small
clusters are on side-shoots. The very fine illustration of this
Bouvardia we give our readers, has been kindly loaned by the Ellis
Brothers, Keene, N. H., who have a fine stock which they are offering to
the public.

Mr. Henry Cannell says, "Of all plants the Bouvardia, in our opinion,
excels for cut flowers, no matter either for button-hole bouquets or
table decoration; a spray of it is sure to be most prominent and
pleasing, and the odor of several kinds is deliciously refreshing, and
if well-grown they will more or less continue flowering nine months out
of the year. Strange to say, they need only the ordinary course of
cultivation of the winter-flowering Zonal Pelargonium; hitherto they
have been treated as a stove plant, whereas they only need a temperature
not higher than 50° to 60°, and in the summer to have every attention,
like a specimen Chrysanthemum, and on the first appearance of frost to
be taken into the house, and when growing and flowering, to be supplied
with liquid manure occasionally."

Our only experience with this genus has been with _Bouvardia Humboldtii
Corymbiflora_, and it has proved to be a very valuable plant. Its pure
white flowers are produced in large trusses; their tubes are three
inches in length, and very fragrant. It blooms very freely and for a
long period. This variety and _Vreelandii_ are the best single white.

_Liantha_ is a dazzling scarlet, and a very profuse bloomer. _Elegans_,
salmon-scarlet; large and fine. _Lady Hyslop_, a light rose. _Canspicua_
is of a blood-red color, with whitish tube. _Bicolor_, a
summer-flowering variety. Flower tube purple, with tint of blue and
delicately mottled flesh, tipped with white. These last we find, only in
Cannell's _Floral Guide_.

I have no difficulty in keeping my Bouvardia in the cellar, the leaves
drop off, but they come out anew in the spring.



This is a very popular genus on account of their rich dark-green leaves,
and beautiful rose-like flowers. They are hardy greenhouse plants, and
thrive best in light loam mixed with sand and peat, but will do well in
light soil without the peat. It will not flourish in a limestone soil.
Mr. Vick gives the following in his Magazine:

"The Camellia Japonica was sent to England in 1739 by Father Kamel, a
missionary, for whom it was named. As a house-plant the Camellia
requires considerable care, on account of the tendency of the flower
buds to drop off. A northern exposure is best, and a temperature of from
forty to fifty degrees. When the buds are swelling, water plentifully
with warm water, but allow none to stand in the saucer. Sponge the
leaves once a week. In the spring put the plant out in a shady place on
the north side of a house or fence, not under the drip of trees, and
water it every day. Set the pots on a hard bottom, so that no worms can
get into them. They form their flower beds during the summer, and at
this time a good growth of wood must be encouraged.

"In the Southern States the Camellia can be raised with not more than
ordinary care; at the North it must be considered entirely a green-house
plant, and as such will always be highly prized. We are often asked how
it should be cared for as a house-plant, and to all such, in the
northern part of the country, where it is necessary to maintain good
fires in warm houses for several months of the year, we have no
hesitation in saying, let it alone, do not expend care and labor where
there is so little prospect of reward."

Camellias are of many hues, and some are beautifully striped. _Gen.
Lafayette_, bright rose, striped with white, imbricated. _Bell Romann_,
imbricated, large flower and petals, rose striated with bright crimson.
_Matteo Molfino_, petals cerise, with pure white band down center.
_Mrs. Lurmann_, crimson, spotted, very beautiful. Pure colors of white,
red, crimson, rose and carmine, can be obtained.


AZALEA.--Shrubby green-house plants of easy cultivation. Very showy and
hardy. Like the Camellia, they are found in all the leading colors, and
also striped, blotched and spotted. They are both single and double.

_Alexander II_, is white, striped with vermilion; edges of petals
fringed. _Aurelia_, white, striped with rosy orange, amaranth spots.
_Flag of Truce_, is a pure double white, very fine. _Her Majesty_, is
rosy-lilac, edged with white. _Alice_, rose, blotched with vermilion;
double.

Mr. Vick gives the following directions: "Azaleas need a light soil of
sandy loam, to which should be added one-half leaf mold. Repotting
should be done in May, trimming the tops to bring them into shape. Then
plunge in some sheltered spot in the garden. In September the plants
should be brought in under cover, or into a cool room. They do best when
the temperature ranges from forty degrees at night to sixty-five or
seventy by day. The foliage should be showered once a week, but care
must be taken that the roots are not over-watered, as they rot easily.
Small plants bloom well, but their beauty increases as they get age and
size. The flowers appear on the terminal shoots, and are from one inch
to two and a half inches in diameter.

"Azaleas if left to themselves will develop long shoots, that after a
time become naked below and are furnished with leaves only at their
extremities. Flower stems are formed on the new wood of each summer's
growth, consequently the amount of bloom, other things being equal,
depends upon the amount of new wood annually produced. In order to have
plants of good shape when they become large, it is necessary to give
attention to pinching and training them from the first. The pyramid
form, or more properly that of a cone, and rounded at the top, is
considered the best for the plant, as it allows the greatest exposure
of leaf-surface. Two principal methods are adopted to regulate the
growth and bring plants into shape: one is by successive pinchings as
the growth proceeds, the other by allowing long shoots to grow and then
bending and training them down, thus causing many of the dormant buds
along their whole length to break and develop into shoots. A skillful
combination of the two methods is probably better than either
exclusively."

Mr. John Dick, Philadelphia, has the largest stock of Camellias and
Azaleas, it is stated, in the United States. Their catalogue list of
these plants embraces more than a hundred varieties, to which we refer
our readers.






We have come to see your garden, said a gentleman with a lady in
company. They were from a neighboring town. This two weeks after the
heavy frost!

I told them my garden was in the stable, and thither I piloted them. It
was not a very small garden if it was in a stable. A hundred or more
plants had been hurriedly removed from the beds the day before that
freezing night! There they were, in the soiled pots just as taken from
the ground, or packed closely in boxes. Not very attractive looking, in
one sense, yet in another they were, for they were bright, healthy
appearing plants--leaves as fresh as when in the open air, pretty
Geraniums in bloom, a mass of Lobelia, attractive with their tiny blue
flowers, Coleus of varied hues, and even a few Roses struggling into
bloom.

Then we strolled among the despoiled beds, and the Pansies, so large and
pert, elicited admiration, and the Sweet Peas, just as fragrant as
though blight were not all around them, while dear little Mignonnette
seemed to have taken a new lease of life.

Yesterday I arranged in a shallow glass dish as handsome a bouquet as I
have had for the season. Sweet Clover sprays, Mignonnette and fragrant
Geranium leaves for the foundation all around the dish, a few bunches of
the little white wax balls, with their glossy leaves, Geranium blossoms,
and lots of Sweet Peas, from the most delicate shades to the deepest,
and bunches of splendid Pansies, Sweet Alyssum, a bit of purple Verbena
here and there, and white-eyed Phlox. It was just lovely.

When the evidence was sure that frost was surely coming, and a great
many plants must be taken up in a few hours' time, I was so glad that
full half of them were in pots. I could never have potted a third of
them in the time. The great object was to get them sheltered, and the
repotting could be done at my leisure.

But I almost changed my mind the other day after toiling several hours
at the business. So many pots to wash! then fill with fresh earth, and
set the plant. O dear, wasn't I tired! But then the wide door was open,
the day was lovely, and I rather think potting plants in a stable is
better than potting out of doors on a cold day, and when one is in a
great hurry. Plants that are in pots plunged in the ground do not grow
so many roots, and that is another advantage.



Perhaps I may as well tell you about my most important window box. I
had it made last autumn, and I was greatly pleased with it. It is made
of zinc, size one yard long, fourteen inches broad, seven inches in
depth. To give it strength it is framed at the top with wood. You can
have this of black walnut, or stained in imitation. You can have the
box painted any color you wish, or leave it unpainted. In the center
is Croton "Weismanni," on one side of it a fine Eranthemum pictum; its
green leaves look as though they were painted with white streaks; on
the other side, Acalypha "Macafeeana." These are the largest plants in
my box, and they do not exceed ten inches in height. There are sixty
plants in all, mostly averaging six inches in height, but a few are
quite small. They consist of very choice Geraniums--some of them
handsome-leaved--variegated Abutilons, Lemon Verbena, two bright
Achyranthes, six very beautiful Coleuses, and four fine Begonias.
There are others I cannot stop to specify. You will see that I have
filled my box with what are, in themselves, beautiful without the aid
of flowers, though I expect to have a few of these by-and-by. I am
perfectly satisfied with it, however, just as it is. I had a large
German Ivy growing out of doors, which consisted of several long
vines. This I planted in one corner of the box, and then drooped and
twined it on the outside. The change to indoor life caused the large
green leaves to fall off, but already new ones have put forth, and the
vines are rapidly growing. Everything else had been previously
prepared so that there was no change in their leafage after being put
in the box. It is a great addition to the beauty of the box to have
vines of pretty foliage drape the sides. This autumn I have had it
placed on a small, low table with castors, so I can change the plants
every week, and thus avoid that turning toward the window which they
always assume if kept in one position.

I first put in drainage, and then filled the box with rich, mellow earth
in which was a mixture of one-third sand. I have been thus particular in
my description, for many, no doubt, who, like myself, have to make the
most of limited space, will be glad to know just how to keep the
greatest number of plants to the best advantage. Not only is there a
saving of room, but of labor, and it is more cleanly.



Among the essentials for winter flowers are the bulbs. Of these the
hyacinth takes the lead. They are so easily grown; so lovely and so
fragrant that they are worthy of a place in every collection. They
should be planted so that the upper surface of the bulb is visible.
Water liberally and then put away in a cool dark place for several
weeks, six weeks is none too long, and some I allow to remain a longer
time, bringing them to the light at intervals so as to have a succession
of flowers. They are very effective planted in a group. They are very
pretty in hyacinth glasses, but this method ruins the bulbs for future
use. Planted out they will sometimes flower. The best time to plant them
in the border is in October, but the first of November will do. It is a
good plan to make a little bed of sand for the bulb, and then cover with
light porous soil. Hyacinths are classed as tall and dwarf, single and
double. The Roman Hyacinth is the earliest bloomer, coming into flower
about the holidays if started in season. The spikes are small and
flowers rather scattering. As soon as the blooms fade, the stalk should
be removed, and when the leaves turn yellow, they can be cut off, and
the bulb dried and packed in paper bags and kept till time for autumn
planting.

Hyacinth bulbs come from Holland. About Haarlem the rubbish heaps are
hyacinths, and the air is oppressive with their perfume.

In California there grows what is called the Twining Hyacinth. It grows
in the mountains, and twines about the bushes, sometimes going up eight
and ten feet. After it gets to the top of the bush and rests awhile, it
lets go of the earth and goes on blooming for months, regardless of the
burning sun. The flower stem breaks off near the ground, and the flowers
are kept swinging in the air supported only by the bush about which it
twines. The color is deep rose, and it is said to be very pretty. The
picture of it certainly looks attractive. It is a large cluster composed
of dozens of blossoms.

For flowering in the house the Polyanthus Narcissus are very desirable.
They can be put into glasses as well as the Hyacinth, but the most
natural method is in a pot of earth, and the bulb is in a better
condition for after use. The Jonquils are also pretty. Snowdrops,
Scillas and the Crocus are cheap bulbs, and planted in the autumn will
show their bright, sweet faces soon after the snow is gone. They are
also very fine for house culture. Should be planted in groups.

Tulips ought to have a place in every garden. They make a brilliant show
in the Spring, when the beds are bare of other flowers, and afford bloom
for a long time, if a good assortment is selected. The pretty little
dwarf Duc Van Thols are early bloomers and very gay. They are admirable
also for the house, and by planting in September, will come into flower
in December. There are early single and double Tulips, and also late
bloomers, so that by having a variety, the border may look gay for a
long time. The Parrot Tulips are large and very brilliant in color, and
picturesque in appearance. All of these varieties succeed in ordinary
garden soil. They ought to be planted in October or November, about four
to six inches apart, and about four inches under the surface. Before
severe frost they need to be protected by branches of evergreen, straw
or leaves. After blooming, and the leaves have died down, they can be
taken up, dried and stored till autumn, if the bed is needed for other
flowers.

The Bulb catalogues issued by leading florists in the autumn, and sent
free to all applicants, will enable you to select just what you want.



In a work of this character it seems needful to treat more fully of
those pests which prove so destructive to plant life, than we have in
our brief references.

The APHIS or green louse is the one that most frequently infests our
plants, and the rapidity with which it multiplies, is astonishing.
REAUMER has proved that in five generations one aphis may be the
progenitor of six thousand millions, and there may be ten generations in
a year!

The method most generally adopted for their destruction is fumigation
with tobacco. As this is attended with considerable difficulty, a weak
solution may be used quite as effectively. We have had no experience
with either method, having used another with good success for several
years. This is white hellebore which we usually apply in the powder when
the Rose-bushes are wet with dew or rain, bending the branches over, so
that the application can be made chiefly on the under side of the
leaves, where the pests are found. Two or three times proves sufficient.
For our house plants we usually make a solution, by putting half an
ounce of the hellebore into pretty warm water, and letting it stand for
several hours, stirring it up however, before spraying the leaves.
Afterward, the plants need to be washed.

For the SCALE a strong solution of soap-suds applied with a sponge or a
small stiff brush. A tooth brush is very suitable for this purpose.

For MEALY BUG, a mixture of one part alcohol and three parts water,
applying with a feather, or what is better, a camel hair brush. Another
method is to use kerosene in the same way. A florist who has practiced
this for eight years, says it is sure death to the insect. The feather
should be brushed all over the mealy-looking substances found usually in
the axils of the leaves.

WORMS IN POTS. Lime water is a safe and effectual remedy for the little
white worms often found in the soil. Slake the lime in water and after
it has settled, pour off the clear water and drench the earth.

ANTS. Various remedies have proved effective. One is to take a vial or a
cup nearly filled with sweet oil, and sink it in the ground where the
ants resort, so that the rim is on a level with the surface. The ants
are very fond of it, but it is sure death to them.

A German writer says that carbolic acid and water will drive ants away
from any grounds--one hundred parts of water to one of the acid. Mix in
a tub and stir repeatedly for twenty-four hours, taking off the scum
that rises to the top.

Kerosene or coal-oil mixed with water has proved very successful in the
destruction of noxious insects and grubs. A tablespoonful of the oil to
two gallons of water is the rule for tender plants; for hardy ones it
will be necessary probably to have it of greater strength. As the
compound does not mix readily, it needs to be thoroughly stirred, and
then quickly applied. The best way is to draw it back and forth a few
times in a syringe, and then apply.

Water tainted with coal-oil, poured into little holes made in mole
tracks, will, it is said, drive them effectually away.

FROM HER BOY

    _For the long nights you lay awake_
    _And watched for my unworthy sake:_
    _For your most comfortable hand_
    _That led me through the uneven land:_
    _For all the story-books you read:_
    _For all the pains you comforted:_

    _For all you pitied, all you bore,_
    _In sad and happy days of yore:--_
    _My second Mother, my first Wife,_
    _The angel of my infant life--_
    _From the sick child, now well and old,_
    _Take, nurse, the little book you hold!_

    _And grant it, Heaven, that all who read_
    _May find as dear a nurse at need,_
    _And every child who lists my rhyme,_
    _In the bright, fireside, nursery clime,_
    _May hear it in as kind a voice_
    _As made my childish days rejoice!_

    I held the trunk with both my hands
    And looked abroad on foreign lands.

    He stays so close beside me, he's a coward you can see;
    I'd think shame to stick to nursie as that shadow sticks to me!

A CHILD'S GARDEN OF VERSES

BED IN SUMMER


    In winter I get up at night
    And dress by yellow candle-light.
    In summer, quite the other way,
    I have to go to bed by day.

    I have to go to bed and see
    The birds still hopping on the tree,
    Or hear the grown-up people's feet
    Still going past me in the street.

    And does it not seem hard to you,
    When all the sky is clear and blue,
    And I should like so much to play,
    To have to go to bed by day?

[Illustration: Mary Hans]




A THOUGHT


    It is very nice to think
    The world is full of meat and drink,
    With little children saying grace
    In every Christian kind of place.

AT THE SEA-SIDE


    When I was down beside the sea
    A wooden spade they gave to me
      To dig the sandy shore.

    My holes were empty like a cup.
    In every hole the sea came up,
      Till it could come no more.

YOUNG NIGHT-THOUGHT


    All night long and every night,
    When my mama puts out the light,
    I see the people marching by,
    As plain as day, before my eye.

    Armies and emperors and kings,
    All carrying different kinds of things,
    And marching in so grand a way,
    You never saw the like by day.

    So fine a show was never seen
    At the great circus on the green;
    For every kind of beast and man
    Is marching in that caravan.

    At first they move a little slow,
    But still the faster on they go,
    And still beside them close I keep
    Until we reach the town of Sleep.

[Illustration]




WHOLE DUTY OF CHILDREN


    A child should always say what's true
    And speak when he is spoken to,
    And behave mannerly at table;
    At least as far as he is able.




RAIN


    The rain is raining all around,
      It falls on field and tree,
    It rains on the umbrellas here,
      And on the ships at sea.

PIRATE STORY


    Three of us afloat in the meadow by the swing,
      Three of us aboard in the basket on the lea.
    Winds are in the air, they are blowing in the spring,
      And waves are on the meadow like the waves there are at sea.

    Where shall we adventure, to-day that we're afloat,
      Wary of the weather and steering by a star?
    Shall it be to Africa, a-steering of the boat,
      To Providence, or Babylon, or off to Malabar?

    Hi! but here's a squadron a-rowing on the sea--
      Cattle on the meadow a-charging with a roar!
    Quick, and we'll escape them, they're as mad as they can be,
      The wicket is the harbour and the garden is the shore.




FOREIGN LANDS


    Up into the cherry tree
    Who should climb but little me?
    I held the trunk with both my hands
    And looked abroad on foreign lands.

    I saw the next door garden lie,
    Adorned with flowers, before my eye,
    And many pleasant places more
    That I had never seen before.

    I saw the dimpling river pass
    And be the sky's blue looking-glass;
    The dusty roads go up and down
    With people tramping in to town.

    If I could find a higher tree
    Farther and farther I should see,
    To where the grown-up river slips
    Into the sea among the ships,

    To where the roads on either hand
    Lead onward into fairy land,
    Where all the children dine at five,
    And all the playthings come alive.

WINDY NIGHTS


    Whenever the moon and stars are set,
      Whenever the wind is high,
    All night long in the dark and wet,
      A man goes riding by.
    Late in the night when the fires are out,
    Why does he gallop and gallop about?

    Whenever the trees are crying aloud,
      And ships are tossed at sea,
    By, on the highway, low and loud,
      By at the gallop goes he.
    By at the gallop he goes, and then
    By he comes back at the gallop again.

TRAVEL


    I should like to rise and go
    Where the golden apples grow;--
    Where below another sky
    Parrot islands anchored lie,
    And, watched by cockatoos and goats,
    Lonely Crusoes building boats;--
    Where in sunshine reaching out
    Eastern cities, miles about,
    Are with mosque and minaret
    Among sandy gardens set,
    And the rich goods from near and far
    Hang for sale in the bazaar;--
    Where the Great Wall round China goes,
    And on one side the desert blows,
    And with bell and voice and drum,
    Cities on the other hum;--
    Where are forests, hot as fire,
    Wide as England, tall as a spire,
    Full of apes and cocoa-nuts
    And the negro hunters' huts;--
    Where the knotty crocodile
    Lies and blinks in the Nile,
    And the red flamingo flies
    Hunting fish before his eyes;--
    Where in jungles, near and far,
    Man-devouring tigers are,
    Lying close and giving ear
    Lest the hunt be drawing near,

[Illustration]

    Or a comer-by be seen
    Swinging in a palanquin;--
    Where among the desert sands
    Some deserted city stands,
    All its children, sweep and prince,
    Grown to manhood ages since,
    Not a foot in street or house,
    Not a stir of child or mouse,
    And when kindly falls the night,
    In all the town no spark of light.
    There I'll come when I'm a man
    With a camel caravan;
    Light a fire in the gloom
    Of some dusty dining-room;
    See the pictures on the walls,
    Heroes, fights, and festivals;
    And in a corner find the toys
    Of the old Egyptian boys.

[Illustration]




SINGING


    Of speckled eggs the birdie sings
      And nests among the trees;
    The sailor sings of ropes and things
      In ships upon the seas.

    The children sing in far Japan,
      The children sing in Spain;
    The organ with the organ man
      Is singing in the rain.

[Illustration]




LOOKING FORWARD


    When I am grown to man's estate
    I shall be very proud and great,
    And tell the other girls and boys
    Not to meddle with my toys.




A GOOD PLAY


    We built a ship upon the stairs
    All made of the back-bedroom chairs,
    And filled it full of sofa pillows
    To go a-sailing on the billows.

    We took a saw and several nails,
    And water in the nursery pails;
    And Tom said, "Let us also take
    An apple and a slice of cake;"--
    Which was enough for Tom and me
    To go a-sailing on, till tea.

    We sailed along for days and days
    And had the very best of plays;
    But Tom fell out and hurt his knee,
    So there was no one left but me.

WHERE GO THE BOATS?


    Dark brown is the river,
      Golden is the sand.
    It flows along for ever,
      With trees on either hand.

    Green leaves a-floating,
      Castles of the foam,
    Boats of mine a-boating--
      Where will all come home?

    On goes the river
      And out past the mill,
    Away down the valley,
      Away down the hill.

    Away down the river,
      A hundred miles or more,
    Other little children
      Shall bring my boats ashore.

AUNTIE'S SKIRTS


    Whenever Auntie moves around,
    Her dresses make a curious sound,
    They trail behind her up the floor,
    And trundle after through the door.

[Illustration]




THE LAND OF COUNTERPANE


    When I was sick and lay a-bed,
    I had two pillows at my head,
    And all my toys beside me lay
    To keep me happy all the day.

    And sometimes for an hour or so
    I watched my leaden soldiers go,
    With different uniforms and drills,
    Among the bed-clothes, through the hills;

    And sometimes sent my ships in fleets
    All up and down among the sheets;
    Or brought my trees and houses out,
    And planted cities all about.

    I was the giant great and still
    That sits upon the pillow-hill,
    And sees before him, dale and plain,
    The pleasant land of counterpane.

[Illustration: THE LAND OF COUNTERPANE]




THE LAND OF NOD


    From breakfast on through all the day
    At home among my friends I stay,
    But every night I go abroad
    Afar into the land of Nod.

    All by myself I have to go,
    With none to tell me what to do--
    All alone beside the streams
    And up the mountain-sides of dreams.

    The strangest things are there for me,
    Both things to eat and things to see,
    And many frightening sights abroad
    Till morning in the land of Nod.

    Try as I like to find the way,
    I never can get back by day,
    Nor can remember plain and clear
    The curious music that I hear.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]




MY SHADOW


    I have a little shadow that goes in and out with me,
    And what can be the use of him is more than I can see.
    He is very, very like me from the heels up to the head;
    And I see him jump before me, when I jump into my bed.

    The funniest thing about him is the way he likes to grow--
    Not at all like proper children, which is always very slow;
    For he sometimes shoots up taller like an india-rubber ball,
    And he sometimes gets so little that there's none of him at all.

    He hasn't got a notion of how children ought to play,
    And can only make a fool of me in every sort of way.
    He stays so close beside me, he's a coward you can see;
    I'd think shame to stick to nursie as that shadow sticks to me!

[Illustration: MY SHADOW]

    One morning, very early, before the sun was up,
    I rose and found the shining dew on every buttercup;
    But my lazy little shadow, like an arrant sleepy-head,
    Had stayed at home behind me and was fast asleep in bed.

[Illustration]




SYSTEM


    Every night my prayers I say,
    And get my dinner every day;
    And every day that I've been good,
    I get an orange after food.

    The child that is not clean and neat,
    With lots of toys and things to eat,
    He is a naughty child, I'm sure--
    Or else his dear papa is poor.

[Illustration]




A GOOD BOY


    I woke before the morning, I was happy all the day,
    I never said an ugly word, but smiled and stuck to play.

    And now at last the sun is going down behind the wood,
    And I am very happy, for I know that I've been good.

    My bed is waiting cool and fresh, with linen smooth and fair
    And I must be off to sleepsin-by, and not forget my prayer.

    I know that, till to-morrow I shall see the sun arise,
    No ugly dream shall fright my mind, no ugly sight my eyes.

    But slumber hold me tightly till I waken in the dawn,
    And hear the thrushes singing in the lilacs round the lawn.




ESCAPE AT BEDTIME


    The lights from the parlour and kitchen shone out
      Through the blinds and the windows and bars;
    And high overhead and all moving about,
      There were thousands of millions of stars.
    There ne'er were such thousands of leaves on a tree,
      Nor of people in church or the Park,
    As the crowds of the stars that looked down upon me,
      And that glittered and winked in the dark.

    The Dog, and the Plough, and the Hunter, and all,
      And the star of the sailor, and Mars,
    These shone in the sky, and the pail by the wall
      Would be half full of water and stars.

    They saw me at last, and they chased me with cries,
      And they soon had me packed into bed;
    But the glory kept shining and bright in my eyes,
      And the stars going round in my head.

MARCHING SONG


    Bring the comb and play upon it!
      Marching, here we come!
    Willie cocks his highland bonnet,
      Johnnie beats the drum.

    Mary Jane commands the party,
      Peter leads the rear;
    Feet in time, alert and hearty,
      Each a Grenadier!

    All in the most martial manner
      Marching double-quick;
    While the napkin, like a banner,
      Waves upon the stick!

    Here's enough of fame and pillage,
      Great commander Jane!
    Now that we've been round the village,
      Let's go home again.

THE COW


    The friendly cow all red and white,
      I love with all my heart:
    She gives me cream with all her might,
      To eat with apple-tart.

    She wanders lowing here and there,
      And yet she cannot stray,
    All in the pleasant open air,
      The pleasant light of day;

    And blown by all the winds that pass
      And wet with all the showers,
    She walks among the meadow grass
      And eats the meadow flowers.

HAPPY THOUGHT


    The world is so full of a number of things,
    I'm sure we should all be as happy as kings.




THE WIND


    I saw you toss the kites on high
    And blow the birds about the sky;
    And all around I heard you pass,
    Like ladies' skirts across the grass--
      O wind, a-blowing all day long,
      O wind, that sings so loud a song!

    I saw the different things you did,
    But always you yourself you hid.
    I felt you push, I heard you call,
    I could not see yourself at all--
      O wind, a-blowing all day long,
      O wind, that sings so loud a song!

    O you that are so strong and cold,
    O blower, are you young or old?
    Are you a beast of field and tree,
    Or just a stronger child than me?
      O wind, a-blowing all day long,
      O wind, that sings so loud a song!

[Illustration]




KEEPSAKE MILL


    Over the borders, a sin without pardon,
      Breaking the branches and crawling below,
    Out through the breach in the wall of the garden,
      Down by the banks of the river, we go.

    Here is the mill with the humming of thunder,
      Here is the weir with the wonder of foam,
    Here is the sluice with the race running under--
      Marvellous places, though handy to home!

    Sounds of the village grow stiller and stiller,
      Stiller the note of the birds on the hill;
    Dusty and dim are the eyes of the miller,
      Deaf are his ears with the moil of the mill.

    Years may go by, and the wheel in the river
      Wheel as it wheels for us, children, to-day,
    Wheel and keep roaring and foaming for ever
      Long after all of the boys are away.

    Home from the Indies and home from the ocean,
      Heroes and soldiers we all shall come home;
    Still we shall find the old mill wheel in motion,
      Turning and churning that river to foam.

    You with the bean that I gave when we quarrelled,
      I with your marble of Saturday last,
    Honoured and old and all gaily apparelled,
      Here we shall meet and remember the past.

GOOD AND BAD CHILDREN


    Children, you are very little,
    And your bones are very brittle;
    If you would grow great and stately,
    You must try to walk sedately.

    You must still be bright and quiet,
    And content with simple diet;
    And remain, through all bewild'ring,
    Innocent and honest children.

    Happy hearts and happy faces,
    Happy play in grassy places--
    That was how, in ancient ages,
    Children grew to kings and sages.

    But the unkind and the unruly,
    And the sort who eat unduly,
    They must never hope for glory--
    Theirs is quite a different story!

    Cruel children, crying babies,
    All grew up as geese and gabies,
    Hated, as their age increases,
    By their nephews and their nieces.

[Illustration]




FOREIGN CHILDREN


    Little Indian, Sioux or Crow,
    Little frosty Eskimo,
    Little Turk or Japanee,
    Oh! don't you wish that you were me?

    You have seen the scarlet trees
    And the lions over seas;
    You have eaten ostrich eggs,
    And turned the turtles off their legs.

    Such a life is very fine,
    But it's not so nice as mine:
    You must often, as you trod,
    Have wearied _not_ to be abroad.

    You have curious things to eat,
    I am fed on proper meat;
    You must dwell beyond the foam,
    But I am safe and live at home.
      Little Indian, Sioux or Crow,
      Little frosty Eskimo,
      Little Turk or Japanee,
    Oh! don't you wish that you were me?

THE SUN TRAVELS


    The sun is not a-bed, when I
    At night upon my pillow lie;
    Still round the earth his way he takes,
    And morning after morning makes.

    While here at home, in shining day,
    We round the sunny garden play,
    Each little Indian sleepy-head
    Is being kissed and put to bed.

    And when at eve I rise from tea,
    Day dawns beyond the Atlantic Sea;
    And all the children in the West
    Are getting up and being dressed.




THE LAMPLIGHTER


    My tea is nearly ready and the sun has left the sky.
    It's time to take the window to see Leerie going by;
    For every night at teatime and before you take your seat,
    With lantern and with ladder he comes posting up the street.

    Now Tom would be a driver and Maria go to sea,
    And my papa's a banker and as rich as he can be;
    But I, when I am stronger and can choose what I'm to do,
    O Leerie, I'll go round at night and light the lamps with you!

    For we are very lucky, with a lamp before the door,
    And Leerie stops to light it as he lights so many more;
    And oh! before you hurry by with ladder and with light;
    O Leerie, see a little child and nod to him tonight!

MY BED IS A BOAT


    My bed is like a little boat;
      Nurse helps me in when I embark;
    She girds me in my sailor's coat
      And starts me in the dark.

    At night, I go on board and say
      Good-night to all my friends on shore;
    I shut my eyes and sail away
      And see and hear no more.

    And sometimes things to bed I take,
      As prudent sailors have to do;
    Perhaps a slice of wedding-cake,
      Perhaps a toy or two.

    All night across the dark we steer;
      But when the day returns at last,
    Safe in my room, beside the pier,
      I find my vessel fast.

[Illustration]




THE MOON


    The moon has a face like the clock in the hall;
    She shines on thieves on the garden wall,
    On streets and field and harbour quays,
    And birdies asleep in the forks of the trees.

    The squalling cat and the squeaking mouse,
    The howling dog by the door of the house,
    The bat that lies in bed at noon,
    All love to be out by the light of the moon.

    But all of the things that belong to the day
    Cuddle to sleep to be out of her way;
    And flowers and children close their eyes
    Till up in the morning the sun shall arise.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]




THE SWING


    How do you like to go up in a swing,
      Up in the air so blue?
    Oh, I do think it the pleasantest thing
      Ever a child can do!

    Up in the air and over the wall,
      Till I can see so wide,
    Rivers and trees and cattle and all
      Over the countryside--

    Till I look down on the garden green,
      Down on the roof so brown--
    Up in the air I go flying again,
      Up in the air and down!

[Illustration]




TIME TO RISE


    A birdie with a yellow bill
    Hopped upon the window sill,
    Cocked his shining eye and said:
    "Ain't you 'shamed, you sleepy-head!"

[Illustration]




LOOKING-GLASS RIVER


    Smooth it glides upon its travel,
      Here a wimple, there a gleam--
        O the clean gravel!
        O the smooth stream!

    Sailing blossoms, silver fishes,
      Paven pools as clear as air--
        How a child wishes
        To live down there!

    We can see our coloured faces
      Floating on the shaken pool
        Down in cool places,
        Dim and very cool;

    Till a wind or water wrinkle,
      Dipping marten, plumping trout,
        Spreads in a twinkle
        And blots all out.

    See the rings pursue each other;
      All below grows black as night,
        Just as if mother
        Had blown out the light!

    Patience, children, just a minute--
      See the spreading circles die;
        The stream and all in it
        Will clear by-and-by.




FAIRY BREAD


    Come up here, O dusty feet!
      Here is fairy bread to eat.
    Here in my retiring room,
      Children, you may dine
    On the golden smell of broom
      And the shade of pine;
    And when you have eaten well,
    Fairy stories hear and tell.

FROM A RAILWAY CARRIAGE


    Faster than fairies, faster than witches,
    Bridges and houses, hedges and ditches;
    And charging along like troops in a battle
    All through the meadows the horses and cattle:
    All of the sights of the hill and the plain
    Fly as thick as driving rain;
    And ever again, in the wink of an eye,
    Painted stations whistle by.
    Here is a child who clambers and scrambles,
    All by himself and gathering brambles;
    Here is a tramp who stands and gazes;
    And there is the green for stringing the daisies
    Here is a cart run away in the road
    Lumping along with man and load;
    And here is a mill, and there is a river:
    Each a glimpse and gone for ever!




WINTER-TIME


    Late lies the wintry sun a-bed,
    A frosty, fiery sleepy-head;
    Blinks but an hour or two; and then,
    A blood-red orange, sets again.

    Before the stars have left the skies,
    At morning in the dark I rise;
    And shivering in my nakedness,
    By the cold candle, bathe and dress.

    Close by the jolly fire I sit
    To warm my frozen bones a bit;
    Or with a reindeer-sled, explore
    The colder countries round the door.

    When to go out, my nurse doth wrap
    Me in my comforter and cap;
    The cold wind burns my face, and blows
    Its frosty pepper up my nose.

    Black are my steps on silver sod;
    Thick blows my frosty breath abroad;
    And tree and house, and hill and lake,
    Are frosted like a wedding-cake.

THE HAYLOFT


    Through all the pleasant meadow-side
      The grass grew shoulder-high,
    Till the shining scythes went far and wide
      And cut it down to dry.

    Those green and sweetly smelling crops
      They led in waggons home;
    And they piled them here in mountain tops
      For mountaineers to roam.

    Here is Mount Clear, Mount Rusty-Nail,
      Mount Eagle and Mount High;--
    The mice that in these mountains dwell,
      No happier are than I!

    Oh, what a joy to clamber there,
      Oh, what a place for play,
    With the sweet, the dim, the dusty air,
      The happy hills of hay!

[Illustration: THE HAYLOFT]

[Illustration]




FAREWELL TO THE FARM


    The coach is at the door at last;
    The eager children, mounting fast
    And kissing hands, in chorus sing:
    Good-bye, good-bye, to everything!

    To house and garden, field and lawn,
    The meadow-gates we swang upon,
    To pump and stable, tree and swing,
    Good-bye, good-bye, to everything!

    And fare you well for evermore,
    O ladder at the hayloft door,
    O hayloft where the cobwebs cling,
    Good-bye, good-bye, to everything!

    Crack goes the whip, and off we go;
    The trees and houses smaller grow;
    Last, round the woody turn we swing:
    Good-bye, good-bye, to everything!

[Illustration]




NORTH-WEST PASSAGE


_1. Good-night_

    When the bright lamp is carried in,
    The sunless hours again begin;
    O'er all without, in field and lane,
    The haunted night returns again.

    Now we behold the embers flee
    About the firelit hearth; and see
    Our faces painted as we pass,
    Like pictures, on the window-glass.

    Must we to bed indeed? Well then,
    Let us arise and go like men,
    And face with an undaunted tread
    The long black passage up to bed.

[Illustration: NORTH-WEST PASSAGE]

    Farewell, O brother, sister, sire!
    O pleasant party round the fire!
    The songs you sing, the tales you tell,
    Till far to-morrow, fare ye well!

[Illustration]


_2. Shadow March_

    All round the house is the jet-black night;
    It stares through the window-pane;
    It crawls in the corners, hiding from the light,
    And it moves with the moving flame.

    Now my little heart goes a-beating like a drum,
    With the breath of the Bogie in my hair;
    And all round the candle the crooked shadows come,
    And go marching along up the stair.

    The shadow of the balusters, the shadow of the lamp,
      The shadow of the child that goes to bed--
    All the wicked shadows coming, tramp, tramp, tramp,
      With the black night overhead.

[Illustration]


_3. In Port_

    Last, to the chamber where I lie
    My fearful footsteps patter nigh,
    And come from out the cold and gloom
    Into my warm and cheerful room.

    There, safe arrived, we turn about
    To keep the coming shadows out,
    And close the happy door at last
    On all the perils that we past.

    Then, when mamma goes by to bed,
    She shall come in with tip-toe tread,
    And see me lying warm and fast
    And in the Land of Nod at last.




THE CHILD ALONE

[Illustration]

[Illustration]




THE UNSEEN PLAYMATE


    When children are playing alone on the green,
    In comes the playmate that never was seen.
    When children are happy and lonely and good,
    The Friend of the Children comes out of the wood.

    Nobody heard him and nobody saw,
    His is a picture you never could draw,
    But he's sure to be present, abroad or at home,
    When children are happy and playing alone.

    He lies in the laurels, he runs on the grass,
    He sings when you tinkle the musical glass;
    Whene'er you are happy and cannot tell why,
    The Friend of the Children is sure to be by!

    He loves to be little, he hates to be big,
    'Tis he that inhabits the caves that you dig;
    'Tis he when you play with your soldiers of tin
    That sides with the Frenchmen and never can win.

    'Tis he, when at night you go off to your bed,
    Bids you go to your sleep and not trouble your head;
    For wherever they're lying, in cupboard or shelf,
    'Tis he will take care of your playthings himself!

[Illustration]




MY SHIP AND I


    O it's I that am the captain of a tidy little ship,
      Of a ship that goes a-sailing on the pond;
    And my ship it keeps a-turning all around and all about;
    But when I'm a little older, I shall find the secret out
      How to send my vessel sailing on beyond.

    For I mean to grow as little as the dolly at the helm,
      And the dolly I intend to come alive;
    And with him beside to help me, it's a-sailing I shall go,
    It's a-sailing on the water, when the jolly breezes blow
      And the vessel goes a divie-divie-dive.

    O it's then you'll see me sailing through the rushes and the reeds,
      And you'll hear the water singing at the prow;
    For beside the dolly sailor, I'm to voyage and explore,
    To land upon the island where no dolly was before,
      And to fire the penny cannon in the bow.

[Illustration]




MY KINGDOM


    Down by a shining water well
    I found a very little dell,
      No higher than my head.
    The heather and the gorse about
    In summer bloom were coming out,
      Some yellow and some red.

    I called the little pool a sea;
    The little hills were big to me;
      For I am very small.
    I made a boat, I made a town,
    I searched the caverns up and down,
      And named them one and all.

    And all about was mine, I said,
    The little sparrows overhead,
      The little minnows too.
    This was the world and I was king;
    For me the bees came by to sing,
      For me the swallows flew.

    I played there were no deeper seas,
    Nor any wider plains than these,
      Nor other kings than me.
    At last I heard my mother call
    Out from the house at evenfall,
      To call me home to tea.

    And I must rise and leave my dell,
    And leave my dimpled water well,
      And leave my heather blooms.
    Alas! and as my home I neared,
    How very big my nurse appeared.
      How great and cool the rooms!

PICTURE-BOOKS IN WINTER


    Summer fading, winter comes--
    Frosty mornings, tingling thumbs,
    Window robins, winter rooks,
    And the picture story-books.

    Water now is turned to stone
    Nurse and I can walk upon;
    Still we find the flowing brooks
    In the picture story-books.

    All the pretty things put by,
    Wait upon the children's eye,
    Sheep and shepherds, trees and crooks,
    In the picture story-books.

    We may see how all things are,
    Seas and cities, near and far,
    And the flying fairies' looks,
    In the picture story-books.

    How am I to sing your praise,
    Happy chimney-corner days,
    Sitting safe in nursery nooks,
    Reading picture story-books?

[Illustration: PICTURE-BOOKS IN WINTER]

MY TREASURES


    These nuts, that I keep in the back of the nest
    Where all my lead soldiers are lying at rest,
    Were gathered in autumn by nursie and me
    In a wood with a well by the side of the sea.

    This whistle we made (and how clearly it sounds!)
    By the side of a field at the end of the grounds.
    Of a branch of a plane, with a knife of my own,
    It was nursie who made it, and nursie alone!

    The stone, with the white and the yellow and grey,
    We discovered I cannot tell _how_ far away;
    And I carried it back although weary and cold,
    For though father denies it, I'm sure it is gold.

    But of all my treasures the last is the king,
    For there's very few children possess such a thing;
    And that is a chisel, both handle and blade,
    Which a man who was really a carpenter made.

[Illustration]




BLOCK CITY


    What are you able to build with your blocks?
    Castles and palaces, temples and docks.
    Rain may keep raining, and others go roam,
    But I can be happy and building at home.

    Let the sofa be mountains, the carpet be sea,
    There I'll establish a city for me:
    A kirk and a mill and a palace beside,
    And a harbour as well where my vessels may ride.

    Great is the palace with pillar and wall,
    A sort of a tower on the top of it all,
    And steps coming down in an orderly way
    To where my toy vessels lie safe in the bay.

    This one is sailing and that one is moored:
    Hark to the song of the sailors on board!
    And see, on the steps of my palace, the kings
    Coming and going with presents and things!

    Now I have done with it, down let it go!
    All in a moment the town is laid low.
    Block upon block lying scattered and free,
    What is there left of my town by the sea?

    Yet as I saw it, I see it again,
    The kirk and the palace, the ships and the men,
    And as long as I live and where'er I may be,
    I'll always remember my town by the sea.

[Illustration]




THE LAND OF STORY-BOOKS


    At evening when the lamp is lit,
    Around the fire my parents sit;
    They sit at home and talk and sing,
    And do not play at anything.

    Now, with my little gun, I crawl
    All in the dark along the wall,
    And follow round the forest track
    Away behind the sofa back.

    There, in the night, where none can spy,
    All in my hunter's camp I lie,
    And play at books that I have read
    Till it is time to go to bed.

    These are the hills, these are the woods,
    These are my starry solitudes;
    And there the river by whose brink
    The roaring lions come to drink.

    I see the others far away
    As if in firelit camp they lay,
    And I, like to an Indian scout,
    Around their party prowled about.

    So, when my nurse comes in for me,
    Home I return across the sea,
    And go to bed with backward looks
    At my dear land of Story-books.

[Illustration]




ARMIES IN THE FIRE


    The lamps now glitter down the street;
    Faintly sound the falling feet;
    And the blue even slowly falls
    About the garden trees and walls.

    Now in the falling of the gloom
    The red fire paints the empty room:
    And warmly on the roof it looks,
    And flickers on the backs of books.

    Armies march by tower and spire
    Of cities blazing, in the fire;--
    Till as I gaze with staring eyes,
    The armies fade, the lustre dies.

    Then once again the glow returns;
    Again the phantom city burns;
    And down the red-hot valley, lo!
    The phantom armies marching go!

    Blinking embers, tell me true
    Where are those armies marching to,
    And what the burning city is
    That crumbles in your furnaces!

[Illustration]




THE LITTLE LAND


    When at home alone I sit,
    And am very tired of it,
    I have just to shut my eyes
    To go sailing through the skies--
    To go sailing far away
    To the pleasant Land of Play;
    To the fairy land afar
    Where the Little People are;
    Where the clover-tops are trees,
    And the rain-pools are the seas,
    And the leaves, like little ships,
    Sail about on tiny trips;
    And above the daisy tree
      Through the grasses,
    High o'erhead the Bumble Bee
      Hums and passes.

    In that forest to and fro
    I can wander, I can go;
    See the spider and the fly,
    And the ants go marching by,
    Carrying parcels with their feet
    Down the green and grassy street.
    I can in the sorrel sit
    Where the ladybird alit.
    I can climb the jointed grass
      And on high
    See the greater swallows pass
      In the sky,
    And the round sun rolling by
    Heeding no such things as I.

    Through that forest I can pass
    Till, as in a looking-glass,
    Humming fly and daisy tree
    And my tiny self I see,
    Painted very clear and neat
    On the rain-pool at my feet.
    Should a leaflet come to land
    Drifting near to where I stand,
    Straight I'll board that tiny boat
    Round the rain-pool sea to float.

    Little thoughtful creatures sit
    On the grassy coasts of it;
    Little things with lovely eyes
    See me sailing with surprise.
    Some are clad in armour green--
    (These have sure to battle been!)--
    Some are pied with ev'ry hue,
    Black and crimson, gold and blue;
    Some have wings and swift are gone;--
    But they all look kindly on.

    [Illustration: THE LITTLE LAND]

      When my eyes I once again
      Open, and see all things plain:
    High bare walls, great bare floor;
    Great big knobs on drawer and door;
    Great big people perched on chairs,
    Stitching tucks and mending tears,
    Each a hill that I could climb,
    And talking nonsense all the time--
      O dear me,
      That I could be
    A sailor on the rain-pool sea,
    A climber in the clover tree,
    And just come back, a sleepy-head,
    Late at night to go to bed.




GARDEN DAYS

[Illustration]

[Illustration]




NIGHT AND DAY


    When the golden day is done,
      Through the closing portal,
    Child and garden, flower and sun,
      Vanish all things mortal.

    As the blinding shadows fall
      As the rays diminish,
    Under evening's cloak, they all
      Roll away and vanish.

    Garden darkened, daisy shut,
      Child in bed, they slumber--
    Glow-worm in the highway rut,
      Mice among the lumber.

    In the darkness houses shine,
      Parents move with candles;
    Till on all, the night divine
      Turns the bedroom handles.

    Till at last the day begins
      In the east a-breaking,
    In the hedges and the whins
      Sleeping birds a-waking.

    In the darkness shapes of things,
      Houses, trees and hedges,
    Clearer grow; and sparrow's wings
      Beat on window ledges.

    These shall wake the yawning maid;
      She the door shall open--
    Finding dew on garden glade
      And the morning broken.

    There my garden grows again
      Green and rosy painted,
    As at eve behind the pane
      From my eyes it fainted.

    Just as it was shut away,
      Toy-like, in the even,
    Here I see it glow with day
      Under glowing heaven.

    Every path and every plot,
      Every bush of roses,
    Every blue forget-me-not
      Where the dew reposes.

    "Up!" they cry, "the day is come
      On the smiling valleys:
    We have beat the morning drum;
      Playmate, join your allies!"

[Illustration]

[Illustration]




NEST EGGS


    Birds all the sunny day
      Flutter and quarrel
    Here in the arbour-like
      Tent of the laurel.

    Here in the fork
      The brown nest is seated;
    Four little blue eggs
      The mother keeps heated.

    While we stand watching her
      Staring like gabies,
    Safe in each egg are the
      Bird's little babies.

    Soon the frail eggs they shall
      Chip, and upspringing
    Make all the April woods
      Merry with singing.

    Younger than we are,
      O children, and frailer,
    Soon in blue air they'll be,
      Singer and sailor.

    We, so much older,
      Taller and stronger,
    We shall look down on the
      Birdies no longer.

    They shall go flying
      With musical speeches
    High over head in the
      Tops of the beeches.

    In spite of our wisdom
      And sensible talking,
    We on our feet must go
      Plodding and walking.

[Illustration]




THE FLOWERS


    All the names I know from nurse:
    Gardener's garters, Shepherd's purse,
    Bachelor's buttons, Lady's smock,
    And the Lady Hollyhock.

    Fairy places, fairy things,
    Fairy woods where the wild bee wings,
    Tiny trees for tiny dames--
    These must all be fairy names!

    Tiny woods below whose boughs
    Shady fairies weave a house;
    Tiny tree-tops, rose or thyme,
    Where the braver fairies climb!

[Illustration: THE FLOWERS]

    Fair are grown-up people's trees,
    But the fairest woods are these;
    Where, if I were not so tall,
    I should live for good and all.




SUMMER SUN


    Great is the sun, and wide he goes
    Through empty heaven without repose;
    And in the blue and glowing days
    More thick than rain he showers his rays.

    Though closer still the blinds we pull
    To keep the shady parlour cool,
    Yet he will find a chink or two
    To slip his golden fingers through.

    The dusty attic spider-clad
    He, through the keyhole, maketh glad;
    And through the broken edge of tiles
    Into the laddered hay-loft smiles.

    Meantime his golden face around
    He bares to all the garden ground,
    And sheds a warm and glittering look
    Among the ivy's inmost nook.

    Above the hills, along the blue,
    Round the bright air with footing true,
    To please the child, to paint the rose,
    The gardener of the World, he goes.

[Illustration]




THE DUMB SOLDIER


    When the grass was closely mown,
    Walking on the lawn alone,
    In the turf a hole I found,
    And hid a soldier underground.

    Spring and daisies came apace;
    Grasses hide my hiding place;
    Grasses run like a green sea
    O'er the lawn up to my knee.

    Under grass alone he lies,
    Looking up with leaden eyes,
    Scarlet coat and pointed gun,
    To the stars and to the sun.

    When the grass is ripe like grain,
    When the scythe is stoned again,
    When the lawn is shaven clear,
    Then my hole shall reappear.

    I shall find him, never fear,
    I shall find my grenadier;
    But for all that's gone and come,
    I shall find my soldier dumb.

    He has lived, a little thing,
    In the grassy woods of spring;
    Done, if he could tell me true,
    Just as I should like to do.

    He has seen the starry hours
    And the springing of the flowers;
    And the fairy things that pass
    In the forests of the grass.

    In the silence he has heard
    Talking bee and ladybird,
    And the butterfly has flown
    O'er him as he lay alone.

    Not a word will he disclose,
    Not a word of all he knows.
    I must lay him on the shelf,
    And make up the tale myself.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]




AUTUMN FIRES


    In the other gardens
      And all up the vale,
    From the autumn bonfires
      See the smoke trail!

    Pleasant summer over
      And all the summer flowers,
    The red fire blazes,
      The grey smoke towers.

    Sing a song of seasons!
      Something bright in all!
    Flowers in the summer,
      Fires in the fall!

[Illustration]




THE GARDENER


    The gardener does not love to talk,
    He makes me keep the gravel walk;
    And when he puts his tools away,
    He locks the door and takes the key.

    Away behind the currant row,
    Where no one else but cook may go,
    Far in the plots, I see him dig,
    Old and serious, brown and big.

    He digs the flowers, green, red, and blue,
    Nor wishes to be spoken to.
    He digs the flowers and cuts the hay,
    And never seems to want to play.

    Silly gardener! summer goes,
    And winter comes with pinching toes,
    When in the garden bare and brown
    You must lay your barrow down.

    Well now, and while the summer stays,
    To profit by these garden days
    O how much wiser you would be
    To play at Indian wars with me!

[Illustration]




HISTORICAL ASSOCIATIONS


    Dear Uncle Jim, this garden ground
    That now you smoke your pipe around.
    Has seen immortal actions done
    And valiant battles lost and won.

    Here we had best on tip-toe tread,
    While I for safety march ahead,
    For this is that enchanted ground
    Where all who loiter slumber sound.

    Here is the sea, here is the sand,
    Here is simple Shepherd's Land,
    Here are the fairy hollyhocks,
    And there are Ali Baba's rocks.

    But yonder, see! apart and high,
    Frozen Siberia lies; where I,
    With Robert Bruce and William Tell,
    Was bound by an enchanter's spell.




ENVOYS

[Illustration]




TO WILLIE AND HENRIETTA


        If two may read aright
        These rhymes of old delight
        And house and garden play,
    You too, my cousins, and you only, may.

        You in a garden green
        With me were king and queen,
        Were hunter, soldier, tar,
    And all the thousand things that children are.

        Now in the elders' seat
        We rest with quiet feet,
        And from the window-bay
    We watch the children, our successors, play.

        "Time was," the golden head
        Irrevocably said;
        But time which none can bind,
    While flowing fast away, leaves love behind.

[Illustration]




TO MY MOTHER


    You too, my mother, read my rhymes
    For love of unforgotten times,
    And you may chance to hear once more
    The little feet along the floor.

TO AUNTIE


    _Chief of our aunts_--not only I,
    But all your dozen of nurselings cry--
    _What did the other children do?_
    _And what were childhood, wanting you?_

TO MINNIE


    The red room with the giant bed
    Where none but elders laid their head;
    The little room where you and I
    Did for awhile together lie
    And, simple suitor, I your hand
    In decent marriage did demand;
    The great day nursery, best of all,
    With pictures pasted on the wall
    And leaves upon the blind
    A pleasant room wherein to wake
    And hear the leafy garden shake
    And rustle in the wind--
    And pleasant there to lie in bed
    And see the pictures overhead--
    The wars about Sebastopol,
    The grinning guns along the wall,
    The daring escalade,
    The plunging ships, the bleating sheep,
    The happy children ankle-deep
    And laughing as they wade;
    All these are vanished clean away,
    And the old manse is changed to-day;
    It wears an altered face
    And shields a stranger race.
    The river, on from mill to mill,
    Flows past our childhood's garden still;
    But ah! we children never more
    Shall watch it from the water-door.
    Below the yew--it still is there--
    Our phantom voices haunt the air
    As we were still at play,
    And I can hear them call and say:
    "_How far is it to Babylon?_"

    Ah, far enough, my dear,
    Far, far enough from here--
    Yet you have farther gone!
    "_Can I get there by candlelight?_"
    So goes the old refrain.
    I do not know--perchance you might--
    But only, children, hear it right,
    Ah, never to return again!
    The eternal dawn, beyond a doubt,
    Shall break on hill and plain,
    And put all stars and candles out
    Ere we be young again.

    To you in distant India, these
    I send across the seas,
    Nor count it far across.
    For which of us forgets
    The Indian cabinets,
    The bones of antelope, the wings of albatross,
    The pied and painted birds and beans,
    The junks and bangles, beads and screens,
    The gods and sacred bells,
    And the loud-humming, twisting shells!
    The level of the parlour floor
    Was honest, homely, Scottish shore;
    But when we climbed upon a chair,
    Behold the gorgeous East was there!
    Be this a fable; and behold
    Me in the parlour as of old,
    And Minnie just above me set
    In the quaint Indian cabinet!
    Smiling and kind, you grace a shelf
    Too high for me to reach myself.
    Reach down a hand, my dear, and take
    These rhymes for old acquaintance' sake!

TO MY NAME-CHILD


                                 1

    Some day soon this rhyming volume, if you learn with proper speed,
    Little Louis Sanchez, will be given you to read.
    Then shall you discover, that your name was printed down
    By the English printers, long before, in London town.

    In the great and busy city where the East and West are met,
    All the little letters did the English printer set;
    While you thought of nothing, and were still too young to play,
    Foreign people thought of you in places far away.

    Ay, and while you slept, a baby, over all the English lands
    Other little children took the volume in their hands;
    Other children questioned, in their homes across the seas:
    Who was little Louis, won't you tell us, mother, please?


                                 2

    Now that you have spelt your lesson, lay it down and go and play,
    Seeking shells and seaweed on the sands of Monterey,
    Watching all the mighty whalebones, lying buried by the breeze,
    Tiny sandpipers, and the huge Pacific seas.

    And remember in your playing, as the sea-fog rolls to you,
    Long ere you could read it, how I told you what to do;
    And that while you thought of no one, nearly half the world away
    Some one thought of Louis on the beach of Monterey!

TO ANY READER


    As from the house your mother sees
    You playing round the garden trees,
    So you may see, if you will look
    Through the windows of this book,
    Another child, far, far away,
    And in another garden, play.
    But do not think you can at all,
    By knocking on the window, call
    That child to hear you. He intent
    Is all on his play-business bent.
    He does not hear; he will not look,
    Nor yet be lured out of this book.
    For, long ago, the truth to say,
    He has grown up and gone away,
    And it is but a child of air
    That lingers in the garden there.


CHAPTER I.

GREENY, BLACKY, AND SLY-BOOTS.


Sammy Ray was running by the parsonage one day when Miss Ruth called to
him. She was sitting in the vine-shaded porch, and there was a crutch
leaning against her chair.

"Sammy," she said, "isn't there a field of tobacco near where you live?"

"Yes'm; two of 'em."

"To-morrow morning look among the tobacco plants and find me a large
green worm. Have you ever seen a tobacco worm?"

Sammy grinned.

"I've killed more'n a hundred of 'em this summer," he said. "Pat Heeley
hires me to smash all I can find, 'cause they eat the tobacco."

"Well, bring one carefully to me on the leaf where he is feeding; the
largest one you can find."

Before breakfast the next morning Ruth Elliot had her first sight of a
tobacco worm.

"Take care!" said Sammy, "or he'll spit tobacco juice on you. See that
horn on his tail? When you want to kill him, you jest catch hold this
way, and"--

"But I don't want to kill him," she said. "I want to keep him in this
nice little house I have got ready for him, and give him all the tobacco
he can eat. Will you bring me a fresh leaf every, morning?"

While she was speaking she had put the worm in a box with a cover of
pink netting. On his way home Sammy met Roy Tyler, and told him (as a
secret) that the lame lady at the minister's house kept worms, and would
pay two cents a head for tobacco worms. "Anyway," said Sammy, "that's
what she paid me."

If there was money to be got in the tobacco-worm business, Roy wanted a
share in it; and before night he brought to Miss Ruth, in an old tin
basin, eight worms of various sizes, from a tiny baby worm just hatched,
to a great, ugly creature, jet black, and spotted and barred with
yellow. The black worm Miss Ruth consented to keep, and Roy, lifting him
by his horn, dropped him on the green worm's back.

"Now you have a Blacky and a Greeny," the boy said; and by these names
they were called.

Roy and Sammy came together the next morning, and watched the worms at
their breakfast.

"How they eat!" said Sammy; "they make their great jaws go like a couple
of old tobacco-chewers."

"Yes; and if they lived on bread and butter 't would cost a lot to feed
'em, wouldn't it?" said Roy.

"Look at my woodbine worm, boys," Miss Ruth said, as she lifted the
cover of another box. "Isn't he a beauty? See the delicate green, shaded
to white, on his back, and that row of spots down his sides looking like
buttons! I call him Sly-boots, because he has a trick of hiding under
the leaves. He used to have a horn on his tail like the tobacco worms."

"Where that spot is, that looks like an eye?"

"Yes; and one day he ate nothing and hid himself away, and looked so
strangely that I thought he was going to die; but the next morning he
appeared in this beautiful new coat."

"How funny! Say, what is he going to turn into?"

But Miss Ruth was busy house-cleaning. First she turned out her tenants.
They were at breakfast; but they took their food with them, and did not
mind. Then she tipped their house upside down, and brushed out every
stick and stem and bit of leaf, spread thick brown paper on the floor,
and put back Greeny and Blacky snug and comfortable.

The next time Sammy and Roy met at the parsonage, three flower-pots of
moist sand stood in a row under the bench.

"Winter quarters," Miss Ruth explained when she saw the boys looking at
them; "and it's about time for my tenants to move in. Greeny and Blacky
have stopped eating, and Sly-boots is turning pale."

"A worm turn pale!"

"Yes, indeed; look at him."

It was quite true; the green on his back had changed to gray-white, and
his pretty spots were fading.

"He looks awfully; is he going to die?"

"Yes--and no. Come this afternoon and see what will happen."

But when they came, Blacky and Sly-boots were not to be seen. Their
summer residence, empty and uncovered, stood out in the sun, and two of
the flower-pots were covered with netting.

"I couldn't keep them, boys," Miss Ruth said; "they were in such haste
to be gone. Only Greeny is above ground."

Greeny was in his flower-pot. He was creeping slowly round and round,
now and then stretching his long neck over the edge, but not trying to
get out. Soon he began to burrow. Straight down, head first, he went
into the ground. Now he was half under, now three quarters, now only the
end of his tail and the tip of his horn could be seen. When he was quite
gone, Sammy drew a long breath and Roy said, "I swanny!"

"How long will he have to stay down there?"

"All winter, Roy."

"Poor fellow!"

"Happy fellow! _I_ say. Why, he has done being a worm. His creeping days
are over. He has only to lie snug and quiet under the ground a while;
then wake and come up to the sunshine some bright morning with a new
body and a pair of lovely wings to spread and fly away with."

"Why, it's like--it's like"--

"What is it like, Sammy?"

"Ain't it like _folks_, Miss Ruth?" Grandma sings:--

    'I'll take my wings and fly away
        In the morning,'

"Yes," she said; "it _is_ like folks." Then glancing at her crutch,
repeated, smiling: "In the morning."

When the woodbine in the porch had turned red, and the maples in the
door-yard yellow, the flower-pots were removed to the warm cellar, and
one winter evening Sammy Ray wrote Greeny's epitaph:--

    "A poor green worm, here I lie;
    But by-and-by
    I shall fly,
    Ever so high,
    Into the sky."

He came often in the spring to ask if any thing had happened, and one
day Miss Ruth took from a box and laid in his hand a shining brown
chrysalis, with a curved handle.

"What a funny little brown jug!" said Sammy.

"Greeny is inside; close your hand gently and see if you feel him."

"How cold!" said the boy; and then: "Oh! oh! he _is_ alive, for he
kicks!"

In June Greeny and Blacky came out of their shells, but no one saw them
do it, for it was in the night; but Sly-boots was more obliging. One
morning Miss Ruth heard a rustling, and lo! what looked like a great
bug, with long, slender legs, was climbing to the top of the box. Soon
he hung by his feet to the netting, rested motionless a while, and then
slowly, slowly unfolded his wings to the sun. They were brown and white
and pink, beautifully shaded, and his body was covered with rings of
brown satin. Blacky and Greeny were not so handsome. They had
orange-spotted bodies, great wings of sober gray, and carried long
flexible tubes curled like a watch-spring, that could be stretched out
to suck honey from the flowers.

At sunset Miss Ruth sent for the boys. She placed the uncovered box
where the moths waited with folded wings, in the open window. Up from
the garden came a soft breeze sweet with the breath of the roses and
petunias. There was a stir, a rustle, a waving of dusky wings, and the
box was empty.

So Greeny and Blacky and Sly-boots "took their wings and flew away," and
the boys saw them no more.




CHAPTER II.

THE PATCHWORK QUILT SOCIETY.


The minister's wife came home from a meeting of the sewing society one
afternoon quite discouraged.

"Only nine ladies present!" she said, "and very little accomplished; and
the barrel promised to that poor missionary out West, before cold
weather--I really don't see how it is to be done."

"What work have you on hand?" Miss Ruth inquired.

"We have just made a beginning," Mrs. Elliot answered with a sigh.
"There's half a dozen fine shirts to make, and a pile of sheets and
pillowcases, dresses and aprons for four little girls, table-cloths and
towels to hem, and I know not what else. We always have sent a
bed-quilt, but this barrel must go without it. It's a pity, too, for
they need bedding."

"Why, so it is," said Miss Ruth. "Susie,"--to a little girl sitting
close beside her,--"why can't some of you girls get together one
afternoon in the week and make a patchwork quilt to send in the barrel?"

Susie put her head on one side and considered.

"Where could we meet, Aunt Ruth?"

"Here in my room, Susie, if mamma has no objection."

"Certainly not," Mrs. Elliot said; "but are you well enough to undertake
it, Ruth?"

"Yes, indeed, Mary; I shall really enjoy it."

"And would you cut out the blocks for us, and show us how to keep them
from getting all _skewonical_, like the cradle-quilt I made for Amelia
Adeline?"

Amelia Adeline was Susie's doll.

"Yes; and I could tell you stories while you were working. How would
that do?"

"Why, it would be splendid!" said the little girl. "There comes Mollie,
I guess, by the noise. Won't she be glad? Say, Mollie!--why, what a
looking object!"

This exclamation was called forth by the appearance of the little girl,
who had been heard running at full speed the length of the piazza, and
now presented herself at the door of Miss Ruth's room, her face flushed,
her hair in the wildest confusion, and the skirt of her calico frock
quite detached from the waist, hanging over her arm.

"Wasn't it lucky that the gathers ripped?" she cried, holding up the
unlucky fragment. "If they hadn't, mamma, I should be hanging, head
down, from the five-barred gate in the lower pasture, and no body to
help me but the cows. You see, I set out to jump, and my skirt got
caught in a nail on the post."

"O Mollie!" said her mother, "what made you climb the five-barred gate?"

"'Cause she's a big tom-boy," said Lovina Tibbs, who had come from the
kitchen to call the family to supper. "Ain't yer 'shamed of yerself,
Mary Elliot?--a great girl like you, most ten years old, walkin' top o'
rail fences and climbin' apple-trees in the low pastur'!"

"No, I'm not!" said Mollie, promptly.

"Hush, Mollie," said Mrs. Elliot. "Lovina, that will do. Wash your face
and hands, Mollie, and make yourself decent to come to supper."

An hour later, seated in the hammock, the girls discussed their aunt's
plan.

"We'll have the Jones girls," said Susie, "and Grace Tyler, and Nellie
Dimock, she's such a dear little thing; and I suppose we must ask Fan
Eldridge, because she lives next door, though I dread to have her come,
she gets mad so easy; but mamma wouldn't like to have us leave her out;
and then, let's see--oh! we'll ask Florence Austin, the new girl, you
know."

"Would you?" said Mollie, doubtfully. "We don't know her very well, and
she dresses so fine and is kind of _citified_, you know. Ar'n't you
afraid she'll spoil the fun?"

"No," said Susie, decidedly. "Mamma said we were to be good to her
because she's a stranger; and I think she's nice, too--not a bit proud,
though her father is so rich."

"Well," Mollie assented, who, though thirteen months older than her
sister, generally yielded to Susie's better judgment; "let her come,
then. That makes six besides us, and Aunt Ruth said half a dozen would
be plenty. Sue, I think it's going to be real jolly, don't you?"




CHAPTER III.

THE STORY OF DINAH DIAMOND.


Miss Ruth Elliot was the minister's sister. And two years before, when
she came to live in the parsonage, an addition of two rooms was built
for her on the ground floor because she was an invalid, and lame, and
could not climb the stairs.

They were pretty rooms, with soft carpets, pictures on the walls, and in
the winter time the sun shining in all day at the south window and the
glass door. In summer with this door wide open and the piazza cool and
shady with woodbine and clematis, you would have agreed with the little
girls who made up Ruth Elliot's sewing circle, that first Wednesday
afternoon, that they were "just lovely!"

All were there--the Jones' twins, Ann Eliza and Eliza Ann, tall girls as
like each other as two peas and growing so fast one could always see
where their gowns were let down; Grace Tyler with curly black hair and
rosy cheeks; Nellie Dimock, a little dumpling of a girl with big blue
eyes and a funny turned up nose; Fannie Eldridge, looking so sweet and
smiling, you would not suspect she could be guilty of the fault Susie
had charged her with; and Florence Austin, whose father had lately
purchased a house in Green Meadow, and with his family had come to live
in the country. Last of all, the minister's two little daughters, whom
you have already met.

Ruth Elliot was sitting at a table covered with piles of bright calico
pieces cut and basted for sewing, and when each girl had received a
block with all necessary directions for making it, needles were
threaded, thimbles adjusted, and the Patchwork Quilt Society was in full
session.

"Now, Aunt Ruth," said Susie, "you promised to tell us a story, you
know."

"Yes; tell us about Dinah Diamond, please," said Mollie.

"You and Susie have heard that story before, Mollie."

"That does not make a bit of difference, Auntie. The stories we like
best we have heard over and over again. Besides, the other girls haven't
heard it. Come, Aunt Ruth, please begin."

And so, while all sat industriously at work, Ruth Elliot related to the
little girls


THE TRUE STORY OF DINAH DIAMOND.

"When I was a little girl," she began, "I had a present from a neighbor
of a black kitten. I carried her home in my apron, a little ball of
black fur, with bright blue eyes that turned yellow as she got bigger,
and a white spot on her breast shaped like a diamond. I remember she
spit and clawed at me all the way home, and made frantic efforts to
escape, and for a day or two was quite homesick and miserable; but she
soon grew accustomed to her surroundings, and was so sprightly and
playful that she became the pet of the house.

"The first remarkable thing she did, was to set herself on fire with a
kerosene lamp. We were sitting at supper one evening, when we heard a
crash in the sitting-room, and rushing in, found the cloth that had
covered the center table and a blazing lamp on the floor. It was the
work of an instant for my father to raise a window, wrap the lamp in the
table-cloth, and throw both into the street. This left the room in
darkness, and I don't think the cause of the accident occured to any of
us, till there rushed from under the sofa a little ball of fire that
flew round and round the room at a most astonishing pace.

"'Oh, my kitten! my kitten!' I screamed. 'She's burning to death! Catch
her! Catch her! Put her out! Throw cold water on her! Oh, my poor, poor
Dinah!' and I began a wild chase in the darkness, weeping and wailing as
I ran. The entire family joined in the pursuit. We tumbled over chairs
and footstools. We ran into each other, and I remember my brother
Charlie and I bumped our heads together with a dreadful crash, but I
think neither of us felt any pain. They called out to each other in the
most excited tones: 'Head her off there! Corner her! You've got her! No,
you haven't! There she goes! Catch her! Catch her!' while I kept up a
wailing accompaniment, 'Oh, my poor, precious Dinah! my burned up Dinah
Diamond,' etc.

"Well, my mother caught her at last in her apron and rolled her in the
hearth rug till every vestige of fire was extinguished and then laid her
in my lap.

"Don't laugh, Mollie," said tenderhearted Nellie Dimock--"please don't
laugh. I think it was dreadful. O Miss Ruth, was the poor little thing
dead?"

"No, indeed, Nellie; and, wonderful to relate, she was very little hurt.
We supposed her fine thick coat kept the fire from reaching her body,
for we could discover no burns. Her tongue was blistered where she had
lapped the flame, and in her wild flight she had lamed one of her paws.
Of course her beauty was gone, and for a few weeks she was that
deplorable looking object--a singed cat. But oh, what tears of joy I
shed over her, and how I dosed her with catnip tea, and bathed her paw
with arnica, and nursed and petted her till she was quite well again! My
little brother Walter ("That was my papa, you know," Mollie whispered to
her neighbor), who was only three years old, would stand by me while I
was tending her, his chubby face twisted into a comical expression of
sympathy, and say in pitying tones: 'There! there! poo-ittle Dinah! I
know all about it. How oo must huffer' (suffer). The dear little fellow
had burned his finger not long before and remembered the smart.

"I am sorry to say that the invalid received his expressions of sympathy
in a very ungracious manner, spitting at him notwithstanding her sore
tongue, and showing her claws in a threatening way if he tried to touch
her. As fond as I was of Dinah, I was soon obliged to admit that she had
an unamiable disposition."

"Why, Miss Ruth, how funny!" said Ann Eliza Jones. "I didn't know there
was any difference in cats' dispositions."

"Indeed there is," Miss Ruth answered: "quite as much as in the
dispositions of children, as any one will tell you who has raised a
family of kittens. Well, Dinah made a quick recovery, and when her new
coat was grown it was blacker and more silky than the old one. She was
a handsome cat, not large, but beautifully formed, with a bright,
intelligent face and great yellow eyes that changed color in different
lights. She was devoted to me, and would let no one else touch her if
she could help it, but allowed me to handle her as I pleased. I have
tucked her in my pocket many a time when I went of an errand, and once I
carried her to the prayer-meeting in my mother's muff. But she made a
serious disturbance in the midst of the service by giving chase to a
mouse, and I never repeated the experiment.

"Dinah was a famous hunter, and kept our own and the neighbors' premises
clear of rats and mice, but never to my knowledge caught a chicken or a
bird. She had a curious fancy for catching snakes, which she would kill
with one bite in the back of the neck and then drag in triumph to the
piazza or the kitchen, where she would keep guard over her prey and call
for me till I appeared. I could never quite make her understand why she
was not as deserving of praise as when she brought in a mole or a mouse;
and as long as she lived she hunted for snakes, though after a while she
stopped bringing them to the house. She made herself useful by chasing
the neighbors' hens from the garden, and grew to be such a tyrant that
she would not allow a dog or a cat to come about the place, but rushed
out and attacked them in such a savage fashion that after one or two
encounters they were glad to keep out of her way.

"Once I saw her put a flock of turkeys to flight. The leader at first
resolved to stand his ground. He swelled and strutted and gobbled
furiously, exactly as if he were saying, 'Come on, you miserable little
black object, you! I'll teach you to fight a fellow of my size. Come on!
Come on!' Dinah crouched low, and eyed her antagonist for a moment, then
she made a spring, and when he saw the 'black object' flying toward him,
every hair bristling, all eyes, and teeth, and claws, the old gobbler
was scared half out of his senses, and made off as fast as his long legs
would carry him, followed by his troop in the most admired disorder.

"I was very proud of one feat of bravery Dinah accomplished. One of our
neighbors owned a large hunting dog and had frequently warned me that if
my cat ever had the presumption to attack his dog, Bruno would shake the
breath out of her as easy as he could kill a rat. I was inwardly much
alarmed at this threat, but I put on a bold front, and assured Mr. Dixon
that Dinah Diamond always had come off best in a fight and I believed
she always would, and the result justified my boast.

"It happened that Dinah had three little kittens hidden away in the
wood-shed chamber, and you can imagine under these circumstances, when
even the most timid animals are bold, how fierce such a cat as Dinah
would be. Unfortunately for Bruno he chose this time to rummage in the
wood-shed for bones. We did not know how the attack began, but suppose
Dinah spied him from above, and made a flying leap, lighting most
unexpectedly to him upon his back, for we heard one unearthly yell, and
out rushed Bruno with his unwelcome burden, her tail erect, her eyes
two balls of fire, and every cruel claw, each one as sharp as a needle,
buried deep in the poor dog's flesh. How he did yelp!--ki! ki! ki! ki!
and how he ran, through the yard and the garden, clearing the fence at a
bound, and taking a bee-line for home! Half-way across the street, when
Dinah released her hold and slipped to the ground, he showed no
disposition to revenge his wrongs, but with drooping ears and tail
between his legs kept on his homeward way yelping as he ran. Nor did he
ever give my brave cat the opportunity to repeat the attack, for if he
chanced to come to the house in his master's company, he always waited
at a respectful distance outside the gate.

"It would take too long to tell you all the wonderful things Dinah did,
but I am sure you all agree with me that she was a remarkable cat. She
came out in a new character when I was ill with an attack of fever. She
would not be kept from me. Again and again she was driven from the room
where I lay, but she would patiently watch her opportunity and steal in,
and when my mother found that she was perfectly quiet and that it
distressed me to have her shut out, she was allowed to remain. She would
lie for hours at the foot of my bed watching me, hardly taking time to
eat her meals, and giving up her dearly loved rambles out of doors to
stay in my darkened room. I have thought some times if I had died then
Dinah would have died too of grief at my loss. But I didn't die; and
when I was getting well we had the best of times, for I shared with her
all the dainty dishes prepared for me, and every day gave her my
undivided attention for hours. It was about this time that I composed
some verses in her praise, half-printing and half-writing them on a
sheet of foolscap paper. They ran thus:--

    'Who is it that I love so well?
    I love her more than words can tell.
    And who of all cats is the belle?
                        My Dinah.

    Whose silky fur is dark as night?
    Whose diamond is so snowy white?
    Whose yellow eyes are big and bright?
                        Black Dinah.

    Who broke the lamp, and in the gloom
    A ball of fire flew round the room,
    And just escaped an awful doom?
                        Poor Dinah.

    Who, to defend her kittens twain,
    Flew at big dogs with might and main,
    And scratched them till they howled with pain?
                        Brave Dinah.

    Who at the table takes her seat
    With all the family to eat,
    And picks up every scrap of meat?
                        My Dinah.

    Who watched beside me every day,
    As on my feverish couch I lay,
    And whiled the tedious hours away?
                        Dear Dinah.

    And when thou art no longer here,
    Over thy grave I'll shed a tear,
    For thou to me wast very dear,
                        Black Dinah.'

"Did you really used to set a chair for her at the table and let her eat
with the folks?" Fanny Eldridge asked.

"Well, Fannie, that statement must be taken with some allowance.
Occasionally when there was plenty of room she was allowed to sit by me,
and I assure you she behaved with perfect propriety. I kept a fork on
purpose for her, and when I held it out with a bit of meat on it she
would guide it to her mouth with one paw and eat it as daintily as
possible. I never knew her to drop a crumb on the carpet. Indeed, I know
several boys and girls whose table manners are not as good as Dinah
Diamond's."

"I suppose you mean me, Auntie," said Mollie. "Mamma is always telling
me I eat too fast, and I know I scatter the bread about sometimes when
I'm in a hurry."

"Well, Mollie," said Miss Ruth, laughing, "I was _not_ thinking of you,
but if the coat fits, you may put it on."

"What became of Dinah at last, Miss Ruth?"

"She made a sad end, Fannie, for as she grew older her disposition got
worse instead of better, until she became so cross and disagreeable that
she hadn't a friend left but me. She would scratch and bite little
children if they attempted to touch her, and was so cruel to one of her
own kittens that we were raising to take her place--for she was too old
and infirm to be a good mouser--that we were afraid she would kill the
poor thing outright. One morning, after she had made an unusually savage
attack on her son Solomon, my mother said: 'We must have that cat
killed, and the sooner the better. It isn't safe to keep such an ugly
creature a day longer.' Dinah was apparently fast asleep on her cushion
in the corner of the kitchen lounge when these words were spoken. In a
few minutes she jumped down, walked slowly across the room and out at
the kitchen door, and we never saw her again."

"Why, how queer! What became of her?"

"We never knew. We inquired in the neighborhood, and searched the barn
and the wood-shed, and in every place we could think of where she would
be likely to hide, but we could get no trace of her, and when weeks
passed and she did not return we concluded that she was dead."

"You don't think--_do_ you think, Miss Ruth, that she understood what
was said and knew if she stayed she would have to be killed?"

"_I_ do," said Mollie, positively. "I'm sure of it!--and so the poor
thing went off and drowned herself, or, maybe, died of a broken heart."

"Oh!" said Nellie Dimock, "poor Dinah Diamond!"

"Nonsense, Mollie!" said Susie Elliot. "Cats don't die of broken
hearts."

"She had been ailing for some days," Miss Ruth explained, "refusing her
food and looking forlorn and miserable, and I am inclined to think
instinct taught her that her end was near. You know wild animals creep
away into some solitary place to die, and Dinah had a drop or two of
wild-cat blood in her veins. I fancy she hid herself in some hole under
the barn and died there. It was a curious coincidence, that she should
have chosen that particular time, just after her doom was pronounced, to
take her departure. But what grieved me most was that, excepting myself,
every member of the family rejoiced that she was dead.

"Poor Dinah Diamond! She was beautiful and clever, and constant and
brave, but she lived unloved and died unlamented because of her bad
temper."




CHAPTER IV.

A SWALLOW-TAILED BUTTERFLY.


"If I can't have the seat I want, I won't have any; and I think you are
real mean, Mollie Elliot! I ain't coming here any more."

These were the words Miss Ruth heard spoken in loud angry tones as she
opened the door connecting her bedroom with the parlor, where the little
girls were assembled, and caught a glimpse of an energetic figure in
pink gingham running across the lawn that separated the minister's house
from his next door neighbor.

"Now, Auntie," said Mollie, in answer to Miss Ruth's look of inquiry, "I
am not in the least to blame. I'll leave it to the girls if I am. Fan
Eldridge is so touchy! She came in a minute ago and Nellie Tyler
happened to be sitting by me, and Fan marched up to her and says, 'I'll
take my seat if you please'; and I said, 'It's no more your seat than it
is Nellie's,' We don't have any particular seats, you know we don't,
Auntie, but sit just as it happens. Well, she declared it was her seat
because she had had it the last two afternoons, and I told Nellie not to
give up to her because she acted so hateful about it, and then she went
off mad. I'm sure I don't care; if she chooses to stay away she can."

"You don't quite mean that, Mollie," her aunt said gravely. "The
Patchwork Society can't afford to lose one of its members, certainly not
for so small a difference as the choice of a seat. We must have Fanny
back, if I give up my seat to her. But come into this room, girls. I
have something pretty to show you. Softly! or you will frighten him
away."

There was a honeysuckle vine trained close to the window, in full bloom,
and darting in and out among the flowers, taking a sip now and then from
a honey-cup, or resting on a leaf or twig, was a large butterfly with
black-velvet wings and spots and bands of blue and red and yellow.

"O you beauty!" said Miss Ruth. "Do you know, girls, of all the moths
and butterflies I have raised from the larv?,--and I have had Painted
Ladies, and Luna Moths, and one lovely Cecropia which was the admiration
of all beholders,--my favorite has always been the Swallow-tailed?
Perhaps it was because he was my first love. I was no older than you,
Nellie, when, half curious and half disgusted, I held at arm's length on
a bit of fennel-stalk, and dropped in an old ribbon-box Aunt Susan
provided for the purpose, the great green worm that, after various
stages of insect life, turned into just such a beautiful creature as you
see flying about among the flowers. Since then I have raised dozens of
them."

"I don't see how you could have any thing to do with worms," said Eliza
Jones. "I hate them--the horrid, squirming things!"

"So did I, Eliza, till I studied into their ways and learned what
wonderful things they can do; and now, I assure you, I have a high
respect and admiration for them."

"Will you tell us about it?" Florence asked. "I've always wanted to know
just how worms turned into butterflies,"

"And I should like nothing better than to tell you," she answered.
"'Making butterflies,' as a dear little boy once defined my favorite
occupation, and telling those who are interested in such things how they
are made, is very delightful to me,"

"Come, then, girls, hurry!" said Nellie: "the sooner we get to work the
sooner the story will begin. Good-by, Mr. Swallow-tail,--I wonder what
they call you so for,--we are going to hear all about you,"

But when they returned to the other room they found Sammy Ray and Roy
Tyler on the piazza, close to the open door. Roy beckoned to his sister,
and they held a whispered conference during which the words, "You ask
her," energetically spoken by Roy, could be plainly heard by those
inside.

Nellie turned presently, half laughing, but a little embarrassed.

"The boys want to know if they can't come in," she said. "I tell them
it's ridiculous for boys to attend a sewing society, but they won't go
away till I've asked."

Here the boys stepped forward and took off their hats. Their faces shone
with the scrubbing with soap and water they had given them, and both had
on clean collars. Sammy dived in his trowsers pocket and brought out a
couple of big brass thimbles and some needles stuck in a bit of flannel.

"We are willing to help sew," said the boy, and bravely stood his
ground, though all the girls laughed, and even Miss Ruth looked amused
at the sight of these huge implements.

"If we let you in at all, boys," she said, "it must be as guests. What
do you say, girls? Suppose we put it to vote. As many of you as are in
favor of admitting Samuel Ray and Roy Tyler to the meeting of the
Patchwork Quilt Society, now in session, will please to signify it by
raising the right hand."

Every hand was lifted.

"It is a unanimous vote," she announced. "Walk in, boys. One more chair,
Susie. Now, then, are we ready?"

But this was fated to be a day of interruptions, for while she was
speaking the door opened and in walked Lavina Tibbs, bearing a plate
piled high with something covered with a napkin.

"Miss Elliot's compliments," she said, "and would the Bed-quilt Society
accept some gingerbread for luncheon?" She set the plate on the table,
removed the napkin with a flourish, and added on her own account:--

"It's jest out of the oven, an' if it ain't good I don't know how to
make soft gingerbread, that's all!"

Good? If you had inhaled its delicious odor, and seen its lovely brown
crust and golden interior, you would have longed (as did every boy and
girl in the room) to taste it directly; and, having tasted, you would
have eaten your share to the last crumb. Miss Ruth gave Susie a
whispered direction, and the little girl brought from a corner cupboard
a pile of pink-and-white china plates, and napkins with pink borders to
correspond. The plates had belonged to Miss Ruth's grandmother, and were
very valuable; but Ruth Elliot believed that nothing was too good to be
used, and that the feast would be more enjoyable for being daintily
served. But when all were helped, she still appeared to think some thing
was wanting, and, after looking round the circle, her glance rested upon
Mollie. The little girl had been unusually quiet ever since her dispute
with Fannie, for she knew very well, though not a word of reproof had
been spoken, that her aunt was not pleased with her. She dropped her
eyes before Miss Ruth's gaze, and grew red in the face; then suddenly
jumping up, she said:--

"I'll go and ask Fan Eldridge to come back, shall I, Auntie? and she may
have any seat she likes; I'm sure I don't care."

"Yes, dear," Miss Ruth said, in the tone Mollie loved best to hear, "and
be quick, do! or the gingerbread will be cold."

Fannie was standing idly at the window looking toward the parsonage,
already repenting of her hasty departure, when Mollie rushed in.

"Come back, Fan, do! we all want you to," she said. "Mamma has sent in
some hot gingerbread, and Sam Ray and Roy Tyler are there, and auntie is
going to tell us about swallow-tailed butterflies, and she doesn't like
to begin without you. Come, now, do! and you may have my seat."

The little girl needed no urging, but her mother interposed.

"Fannie was greatly to blame," Mrs. Eldridge said. "She has told me all
about it, and I think she deserves to be punished by staying at home."

"Oh, but please, Mrs. Eldridge," said Mollie, "let her off this time! It
was my fault as well as hers, for you see I provoked her by answering
back."

"Say you are sorry, Fannie."

"Yes, truly, mamma, I am," said Fannie, with tears in her eyes; "and
I'll take any seat, or I'll stand up all the afternoon, if you'll only
let me go, and I _will_ try to break myself of getting angry so easy;
see if I don't!"

On the strength of these promises Mrs. Eldridge gave her consent, and
the little girls crossed the lawn hand-in-hand, in loving companionship.
So harmony was restored in the Society, and all ate their gingerbread
with a relish. Sammy and Roy would have liked better to have munched
their share on the piazza-steps, without plate or napkin. Under the
circumstances, however, they behaved very well; for, though Roy took
rather large mouthfuls, and Sammy licked his fingers when he thought no
one was looking, these were small delinquencies, and you will be glad
to know that the girls were too well-bred to appear to notice. Mollie,
now fully restored to favor, was allowed to pass the finger-bowl, while
Susie collected the plates, distributed the work, and made every thing
snug and tidy in the room. Then Miss Ruth commenced the story of


THE SWALLOW-TAILED BUTTERFLY.

"When I was ten years old, my brother Charlie and I spent a summer with
Aunt Susan, who lived in the old homestead some miles out of town.

"One night after tea she sent us into the garden to gather some sprigs
of fennel for her to take to prayer-meeting--all the old ladies in
Vernon took dill or fennel to evening meeting. I had just put my hand to
the fennel-bush when I drew it back with a scream.

"'What's the matter?' said Charlie.

"'A great, horrid green worm,' said I. 'I almost touched it!'

"'Here, let me smash him!' said Charlie; 'where is he?'

"'Oh, don't touch him!' I cried; 'he might bite you. Oh, dear, I hate
worms! I wonder what they were made for!'

"'That kind was made to turn into butterflies,' said Tim Rhodes.

"Tim was working Aunt Susan's garden on shares that summer, and had
heard all we said, for he was weeding the onion-bed close by.

"'What, that fellow!' said Charlie; 'will he turn into a butterfly?' and
we both of us looked at the caterpillar. He was about as long and as
thick as my little finger, of a bright leafy green, with black-velvet
rings dotted with orange at even distances along his body. He lay at
full length on a fennel-stalk, and seemed to be asleep; but when Charlie
touched him with a little stick, instantly there shot out of his head a
pair of orange-colored horns, and the air was full of the pungent odor
of fennel.

"'It smells like prayer-meeting,' said Charlie, and ran off to play; but
I wanted further information.

"'Mr. Rhodes,' said I, 'how do you know this kind of worm makes
butterflies?'

"'Because I've seen 'em do it, child. If you should put that fellow now
in a box with some holes in the top, so as he could breathe, and give
him plenty of fresh fennel to eat, in a week (or less time if he's full
grown) he'll wind himself up, and after a spell he'll hatch out a
butterfly--a pretty one, too, I tell you,'

"'I mean to try it,' I said; and I ran to the house and Aunt Susan gave
me an old ribbon-box, and Mr. Rhodes punched a few holes in the cover
with his pocket-knife; and after a little hesitation I picked the
fennel-stalk with the worm on it, and laid it carefully in the box,
making sure that the cover was tight. The box was then taken to the
house and deposited on a bench in the porch, for Aunt Susan objected to
entertaining this new boarder indoors.

"I gave my worm his breakfast the next morning before I had my own, and,
forgetting my aversion, sat by the open box and watched him eat, as his
strong jaws made clean work with leaf and stem.

"'He isn't so ugly, after all, Charlie,' I said; 'he is almost handsome
for a worm, with all those bright colors on him,'

"Then Charlie caught a little of my enthusiasm, and said _he_ meant to
keep a worm too. So he searched the fennel-bush and found three, and
tumbled them unceremoniously into the box.

"'Now they'll have good times together,' said he; 'that fellow was awful
lonesome shut up by himself,'

"At Aunt Susan's suggestion I improved my worm-house by removing the top
of the box and stretching mosquito-netting across, fastening it securely
along the edges lest my prisoners should escape. And it was well I took
this precaution; for, though for several days they made no attempt to
get away, and seemed to do nothing but eat and sleep, one morning I
found my largest and handsomest worm in a very disturbed and restless
condition. He was making frantic efforts to escape. Up and down, round
and round, over and under his companions, who were still quietly
feeding, without a moment's pause, he was pushing his way. I watched him
till I was tired; but when I left him he was still on his travels.

"In the afternoon, however, he had settled himself half-way up the side
of his house. His head was moving slowly from side to side, and a fine
white thread was coming out of his mouth. When I looked again he had
fastened himself to the box by the tip of his tail and by a loop of fine
silk passing round the upper part of his body. There he hung motionless
two, three, almost four, days. The green and orange and black faded
little by little, his body shrank to half its size, and he looked
withered, unsightly, dead. I thought he _was_ dead; but Tim Rhodes (who
all along had shown a friendly interest in my pursuit) took a look at my
poor dead worm,' and pronounced him all right.

"'Keep a watch on him this afternoon,' said Tim,' and you'll see
something queer,'

"So we did; and Aunt Susan was summoned to the porch by the news that
'the worm had split in the back and was coming out of his skin.' By the
time she had got on her glasses and was ready to witness this wonderful
sight, it was over. A heap of dried skin lay in the bottom of the box,
and a pretty chrysalis of a delicate green color hung in place of the
worm.

"'O Auntie!' said Charlie, 'you ought to have seen him twist and squirm
and make the split in his back bigger and bigger till it burst open and
tumbled off, just as a boy wriggles out of a tight coat, you know!'

"After this came three weeks of waiting, during which the green
chrysalis turned gray and hard and the other worms, one by one, went
through the same changes, until four gray chrysalis were fastened to the
sides of the box.

"Every day I looked, but nothing happened, until it seemed to me, tired
of waiting, that nothing ever _would_ happen. But one bright morning I
forgot all my weariness when I found, clinging to the netting, a
beautiful creature like the one we saw on the honeysuckle this
afternoon, with a slender black body and wings spotted with yellow and
scarlet and lovely blue. When I opened the box he didn't try to fly. He
was weak and trembling, and his wings were damp, but every moment they
grew larger and his colors brighter in the sunshine.

"While Charlie and I stood watching him, we discussed, in our own way, a
problem that has puzzled wiser heads than ours--how three distinct
individuals (the worm, the chrysalis, and the butterfly) could be one
and the same creature, and how from a low-born worm that groveled and
crawled could be born this bright ethereal being--all light and beauty
and color--that seemed fitted only for the sky.

"Aunt Susan listened to our talk a while and then repeated a text of
Scripture:--

"'Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his
glorious body?'"

"While we talked the butterfly grew stronger and more beautiful, until
at last, spreading his wings to their widest extent, he darted high into
the air and we lost him. But from the day I took the green worm from the
fennel-bush in Aunt Susan's garden I date my introduction to a
delightful study which I have followed all my life as I have found
opportunity. So you see it is no wonder I am fond of the swallow-tailed
butterfly; and I have another reason, for once on a time I tamed one so
that it sucked honey from my finger."

"Auntie, you are joking!"

"Indeed, no. It was a poor little waif which, mistaking chimney heat for
warm spring weather, hatched himself out of season, and whose life I
prolonged by providing him with food."

"The dear little thing! Tell us about it, please."

"Well, I had put away some chrysalids for the winter in a closet in my
sleeping-room, and one day my nurse--I was ill at the time--heard a
rustling in the box where they lay and brought it to me for
investigation; and, behold! when I opened it there was a full-grown
swallow-tail, who, waking too soon from his winter's nap, left the soft
bed of cotton where his companions lay sleeping side by side and, wide
awake and ready to fly, was impatiently waiting for some one to let him
out into the sunshine.

"But the March sunshine was fitful and pale, and the cold wind would
have chilled him to death before night; so we resolved to keep him
indoors. We gave him the liberty of the room, and he fluttered about the
plants in the window, now and then taking a flight to the ceiling,
where, I am sorry to say, he bruised his delicate wings; but he seemed
to learn wisdom by experience, for after a while he contented himself
with a lower flight. Every day my bed was wheeled close to the window,
and I amused myself for hours watching my pretty visitor. He would
greedily suck a drop of honey, diluted with water, from the leaf of a
plant or from the end of my finger, and by sight or smell, perhaps by
both senses, soon learned where to go for his dinner.

"And so he lived and thrived for a fortnight, and I had hopes of keeping
him till spring; but one cold night the furnace fire went out, and in
the morning my pretty swallow-tail lay dead on the window-sill. Wasn't
it a pity?

"Oh," said Florence, "I like to hear about butterflies! Will you please
tell us about some of the other kinds you have kept?"

"Tell us about that big fellow you said every body made a fuss over.
Ce-ce--I can't remember what you called him."

"Cecropia!" said Susie, promptly. "Yes, do, Auntie! if you are not
tired."

If Ruth Elliot had been ever so weary I think she would have forgotten
it at sight of the interested faces of her audience; but in fact she was
not in the least tired, but was as pleased to tell as they were to
listen to the story of


THE CECROPIA MOTH.

"One day in November," she said, "a man who used to do odd jobs about
the place for my father, and whom we always called Josh,--his name was
Joshua Wheeler,--left his work to bring to the house and put into my
hand a queer-looking pod-shaped package firmly fastened to a stout twig.
It was of a rusty gray color and looked as much like a thick wad of
dirty brown paper as any thing I can think of.

"'I found this 'ere cur'us lookin' thing,' he said, 'under a walnut-tree
on the hill yonder, where I was rakin' up leaves--an', thinks I, there's
some kind of a crittur stored away inside, an' Miss Ruth she's crazy
arter bugs an' worms an' sich like varmints, an' mebbe she'd like to see
what comes out o' this 'ere; so I've fetched it along.'

"You may be sure I thanked him heartily and gave him a sixpence besides,
which I am afraid went to buy tobacco. 'Law, Doctor, don't I know it?'
Josh used to reply when my father urged him to break off a habit that
was making a shaky old man of him at sixty; 'don't I know it's a
dretful bad habit; but then you see a body must have somethin' to be
a-chawin' on.'

"But what was in the brown package? That was the question I puzzled my
brains over. I had never seen a cocoon in the least like it before, and
I had no book on entomology to help me. With the point of a needle I
carefully picked away the outer layer till I came to loose silken fibers
that evidently were the covering of an inside case. Whatever was there
was snugly tucked away in a little inner chamber with the key inside,
and I must wait with what patience I could command till he chose to open
the door.

"I kept my precious cocoon all winter in a cold, dry place; but when
warm spring weather came it lay in state on my work-table, in a box
lined with cotton, where I could watch it all day long. Nothing
happened till one bright day in June I heard a faint scratching inside
the brown case. It grew louder and louder every moment. Evidently my
tenant was bestirring himself and, with intervals of rest, was scraping
and tearing away his silken wrappings. Presently an opening was made and
out of this were poked two bushy legs with claws that held fast by the
outside of his house, while the creature gradually pulled himself out.

"First a head with horns; then a part of the body and two more legs;
then, with one tremendous effort, he was free!--an odd beast of no
particular color, looking exceedingly damp and disagreeable, with his
fat chunky body and short legs, like an exaggerated bumble-bee, only not
at all pretty. He was shaky on his legs and half tumbled from his box
to the window-sill, along which he walked trembling till he came to the
tassel of the shade, just within his reach. This he grabbed with all
four claws, his wings hanging down.

"'It's nothing but a homely old brown bug!' said my brother Charlie,
whom I had called to see the sight.

"'No,' I said, "'it isn't a bug. I'm sure I don't know what it is,'

"I was ready to cry with disappointment and vexation, for I had expected
great things from my brown chrysalis.

"The tassel was gently swaying with the weight of the clumsy creature,
and in the warm sunshine which was gradually drying body and wings faint
colors began to show--a dull red, a dash of white, a wavy band of gray,
with patches of soft brown that began to look downy like feathers. Every
moment these colors grew more distinct and took new shapes. None of
them were bright, but they were beautifully blended and the whole body
was of the texture of the finest velvet.

"But the wings! How can I describe to you how those thick, crumpled,
unsightly appendages grew and grew, changing in color from a dingy black
to a dark brown, with bands of gray and red? how the great white patches
took distinct form, and some were dashed with red and bordered with
black, and others eye-shaped with crescents of pale blue? It must have
taken an hour for all this to come about--for the great wings to unfurl
to their widest extent and the cecropia moth to show himself in all his
beauty to our admiring gaze.

"The whole family had gathered to see the show. My father lingered, hat
and riding-whip in hand, though he had a round of twenty miles to make
among his patients before night; and Aunt Susan, who was on a visit,
stood peering through her spectacles, too much absorbed to notice black
Dinah taking a nap in her work-basket and the kitten making sad havoc
with her knitting. Josh was called in from the wood-shed, and, with his
hat on the back of his head and hands deep in his pockets, gazed in
silence.

"'Wal,' he said at length, 'if that don't beat all natur'! Look at the
size of that crittur, will you, and the hole he's jest crawled out of.
Why, he's as big as a full-grown bat, measures full seven inches across
from wing to wing. Wal, now, I'd gin consider'ble to know what's be'n
goin' on for a spell back in that leetle house where he's passed his
time; and I'll bet, Doctor, with all your larnin', _you_ can't tell.'"




CHAPTER V.

FURRY-PURRY BECOMING GOLD ELSIE.


Miss Ruth found on her table the next Wednesday afternoon a note very
neatly and carefully written, which read as follows:--

     Miss RUTH,--Will you Please tell us Another Cat Story, becaus I
     like them best. So does Fannie Eldridge she said So after You told
     Worm stories.

     Miss Ruth I Have Named my Black Kitty After your Dinah Diamond, her
     Last Name has to Be Spot Becaus her Spot is not a Diamond, this is
     from your Friend.

     NELLIE DIMOCK.

"I hold in my hand," Miss Ruth said, when she had carefully perused this
epistle, "a written request from two members of our Society for another
cat story. Susie and Mollie, have I any more cat stories worth telling?"

"Yes, indeed, Auntie" said Mollie. "Don't you remember the pretty fairy
story you used to tell us about the good little girl who saved a cat
from being drowned by some bad boys, and carried her home? and she
turned out to be a fairy cat and gave that girl every thing she wished
for--cakes and candy, and a lovely pink silk frock packed in a nutshell
for her to wear to the party?"

"O Mollie! that's too much of a baby story," said Susie. "Tell us about
the musical cat who played the piano by walking over the keys, and all
the people in the house thought it was a ghost."

"Yes, Auntie; and the funny story of the cat and the parrot--how the
parrot got stuck up to her knees in a pan of dough, and in her fright
said over every thing she had learned to say: 'Polly wants a cracker!'
'Oh, my goodness' sakes alive!' 'Get out, I say!' 'Here's a row!' 'Scat,
you beast!' and so on;--and how the cat got her out."

"These are old stories, girls, and you have told them for me."

"Our old cat Jane," said Eliza Ann Jones, "is a regular cheat. You see,
she _would_ lie in grandma's chair. She used to jump in if grandma left
it only for a minute; and grandma wouldn't know she was there, and two
or three times sat right down on her. Why, it was just awful, and scared
poor grandma half to death. Well, ma whipped the old cat every time she
caught her in the chair, and we thought she was cured of the habit; but
one day ma came into the room and there was nobody there but Jane, and
she was stretched on the rug and seemed to be fast asleep; but grandma's
chair was rocking away all by itself. Ma wondered what made the chair
go, so she thought she'd watch. She left the door on a crack and peeped
through, and as soon as the cat thought she was alone she jumped into
the chair and settled herself for a nap; but when ma made a little
noise, as if somebody were coming out, she hopped out and stretched
herself on the rug and made believe she was fast asleep. 'Twas her
jumping out so quick that set the chair rocking. Now, wasn't that cute?"

"I never knew till the other day," said Florence Austin, "that cats
scatter crumbs to attract the birds, and then watch for them and spring
out on the poor things when they are feeding."

"What a shame! I wouldn't keep a cat who played such a cruel trick,"
Mollie said.

"My Dinah Spot doesn't catch birds or chickens," said Nellie Dimock;
"only mice."

Mrs. Elliot had come in with a message to her sister while this talk
went on, and had lingered to hear Eliza's story of old Jane.

"Girls," she said, "with your President's permission, I will tell you a
story about a cat. It is curious, because it proves that a cat remembers
and reasons much as a man or woman would in similar circumstances. Susie
and Mollie, I have told it to you before, but you will not mind hearing
it again.

"When my brother Charles was a young man he kept a bachelor
establishment in the country, and with other pets owned a beautiful gray
cat he had; brought with him from Germany. She was very intelligent and
docile, a great favorite with her master, and was allowed many
privileges in the house. She came in and out through a small door cut in
the side of the house which she opened and closed for herself. A chair
was regularly placed for her at the table; she slept at the foot of my
brother's bed, and perched herself on his shoulder when he took a stroll
in the garden. She could distinguish the sound of his bell from any
other in the house, and was greatly disturbed if the servant delayed in
answering his call.

"One summer my sister Helen and her two boys were staying with Charles,
and in the midst of the visit he was called away on business, and was
absent for several weeks. Now, Carl and Teddy were dear little fellows,
but full of mischief; and in their uncle's absence they so teased and
tormented poor Miess, taking advantage of her amiable disposition, that
she was forced at length to keep out of their way. About a week before
Charles came home she had kittens, which she carefully hid behind a
heavy book-case in the library.

"The morning of his return he had the cat in his lap petting and
caressing her as usual, and then went out for an hour. As soon as he was
gone, pussy brought her kittens one by one from their hiding-place and
laid them on the rug in the corner of the room where she had nursed and
tended all her young families before. Now she must have reasoned in this
way: 'My good, kind master has come home, and those dreadful boys who
have pinched my ears and tied things to my tail, and teased and
frightened me almost to death, will be made to behave themselves. All
danger to me and to my babies is over. Why must the pretty dears be
hidden away in that musty place? Of course master wants to see them, and
they are well worth looking at. The thing for me to do is to bring them
out of that dark hole and put them where I always have put my kittens
before.'"

"Wise old Miess!" said Mollie. "Mamma, please tell the girls how she
saved uncle's pet canary from a strange cat."

"Yes, dear. Miess was so obedient and well trained that her master often
trusted her in the room while he gave the bird his airing, and Bobby
became so accustomed to the cat's presence that he hopped fearlessly
about the floor close to pussy's rug, and more than once lighted on her
back; but one day your uncle discovered Miess on the table with the bird
in her mouth. For an instant he thought her cat nature had got the upper
hand, and that Bobby's last moment had come; then he discovered a
strange cat in the room and knew that his good cat had saved the
canary's life. As soon as the intruder was driven out, Bobby fluttered
away safe and sound."

"Wasn't that nice of Miess, Auntie?" said Susie. "I have thought of a
story for you to tell us this afternoon--the story of the barn-cat that
wanted so much to become a house-cat. Don't you remember that story you
used to tell us long ago?"

"Oh, yes!" Mollie said; "her name was Furry-Purry, and she lived with
Granny Barebones, and there was Tom--Tom--some thing; what _was_ his
name? Tell us that, Aunt Ruth, do!"

"Isn't it open to the objection you made to Mollie's choice a while ago,
Susie?" she asked. "I remember it went with 'The Three Bears' and 'Old
Mother Pig' and 'The Little Red Hen.'"

"No, Auntie, I think not; it's different, somehow."

"Very well, then, if you are sure you haven't outgrown it."

"Is it a true story?" Nellie Dimock wanted to know.

"It is made out of a true story, Nellie. A young cat which was born and
brought up in a barn became dissatisfied with her condition in life, and
made up her mind to change it. She chose the house of a friend of mine
for her future home, and presented herself every morning at the door,
asking in a very earnest and humble way to be taken in. When driven away
she went sadly and reluctantly, but in a few moments was back again
waiting patiently, quietly, hour after hour, day after day. If noticed
or spoken to, she gave a plaintive mew, looked cold and hungry, but
showed no signs of discouragement. She didn't once try to steal into the
house, as she might have done, but waited patiently for an invitation.

"And when one morning she brought a mouse and laid it on the door-step,
and looking up, seemed to say: 'Kind lady, if you will take me for your
cat, see what I will do for you,' my friend could no longer refuse. The
door was opened, the long-wished-for invitation was given, and very
soon the little barn-cat became the pet and plaything of the family. She
proved a valuable family cat, and her descendants, to the fourth
generation, are living in my friend's family to-day.

"Out of these materials I have dressed up the story of

HOW FURRY-PURRY BECAME GOLD ELSIE.

"The door of the great house stood open and Furry-Purry looked in.

"Furry-Purry was a small yellow cat striped down the back with a darker
shade of the same color. Her paws, the lower part of her body, and the
spot on her breast were white.

"This is what the little cat saw, looking through the open door into the
great house:--

"A pleasant room hung with pictures, the floor covered with a soft
carpet, where all kinds of bright-colored flowers seemed to be growing,
and, in the sunniest corner, lying in an arm-chair piled with cushions,
a large tabby cat.

"Just then a gust of wind closed the door, and Furry-Purry ran round the
house to the barn and remained all day hidden in her hole under the
boards.

"That night there was a storm, and several cats in the neighborhood
crept into the barn for safety. There was old Mrs. Barebones, a cat with
a bad cough, which was thought to be in a decline; Tom Skip-an'-jump, a
sprightly young fellow with a tenor voice which he was fond of using on
moonlight nights; and Robber Grim, a fierce, one-eyed creature--the pest
of the neighborhood--with a great head and neck and flabby, hanging
cheeks and bare spots on his tawny coat where the fur had been torn out
in his fierce battles.

"The thunder roared overhead and the lightning, shining through the
cracks, played on the barn floor and showed the cats sitting gravely in
a circle. Only Tom Skip-an'-jump, who still kept his kittenish tricks,
went frisking after his tail and turning somersaults in the hay.
Presently he tumbled over Furry-Purry and bit her ear.

"'Come, play!' said he: 'it's a jolly time for puss-in-the-corner.'

"'Tom,' said Furry-Purry, 'I never shall play again. I am very unhappy.
I have seen Mrs. Tabitha Velvetpaw lying on a silk cushion, while I make
my bed in the hay. She walks on a lovely soft carpet, and I have only
this barn floor. O Tom, I want to be a house-cat.'

"'A house-cat!' repeated Tom disdainfully. 'They sleep all day. They
get their tails pulled and their ears pinched by horrid monsters with
only two legs to walk on, and nights--beautiful moonlight nights when we
barn-cats are roaming the alleys and singing on the roofs and having a
good time generally--they are locked in cellars and garrets and made to
watch rat-holes. Oh, no! not for Tom.'

"He was off with a whisk of his tail to the highest beam in the barn,
looking down on them with the greenest of green eyes, and singing,--

    'Some love the home
    Of a lazy drone,
    And a bed on a cushioned knee;
    But in wild free ways
    I will spend my days,
    And at night on the roofs I'll be.

    Oh, 'tis my delight,
    On a moonlight night'--

"'Don't listen to him, my dear,' said Mrs. Barebones, the consumptive
cat; 'he's a wild, thoughtless creature, quite inexperienced in the ways
of the world. Heed the counsels of one whose sands of life are almost
run and who, before she goes to the land of cats, would fain warn a
youthful friend and, if possible, avert her from her own sad fate. This
racking cough (ugh! ugh!) and this distressing _cat_-arrh, (snuff!
snuff!) with which you see me afflicted were brought on by the hardships
and exposure incident to the life of a barn-cat: midnight rambles, my
dear (ugh!), in frost and snow; days when not so much as a mouse's tail
has passed my hungry jaws, and winter nights when my coat was too thin
to keep out the cold. And all these sufferings, past and present, are in
consequence of my being a barn-cat.'

"'Now, may the dogs get me, if I ever heard such a string of nonsense!'
said Robber Grim. 'Don't believe a word she says. She's an old granny.
She's got the fidgets. She wants a dose of catnip-tea. Don't believe Tom
Skip-an'-jump, either. What does _he_ know about war? He never was shot
at. Look at me! I'm Robber Grim! I'm an old one, I am! I've got good
blood in my veins. My great-grandfather was a catamount and his
grandmother was a tiger-cat. I've been in a hundred battles. I've had
one eye knocked out and an ear bit off. I left a piece of my tail in a
trap. I've been scalded with hot water and peppered all over with shot.
_I'll_ teach you how to get a living without being a house-cat. I hate
houses and the people who live in them, and I do them all the mischief
I can. I eat up their chickens and I suck their eggs. I climb in at the
pantry window and skim their milk. Once when the cook left the kitchen
door open I snatched the beefsteak from the gridiron and made off with
the family dinner. They hate me--they do. They've tried to kill me a
dozen times; but I'm Robber Grim, ha! ha! and I've got nine lives!'

"At this instant there came a flash of lightning, followed by a peal of
thunder that shook the barn to its foundations, and every cat fled in
terror to its hole.

"The next morning Mrs. Tabitha Velvetpaw took a stroll round the garden
and down the lane a little way, where the catnip grew. The ground was
wet after the shower, and she was daintily picking her way along, very
careful not to soil her beautiful feet, of which she was justly proud,
when suddenly there glided from behind a tree and stood directly in her
path a small yellow cat.

"'Oh, my paws and whiskers!' exclaimed Mrs. Tabitha, surprised out of
her usual dignity.

"'If you please,' said Furry-Purry,--for it was she,--'I have made bold
to come out and meet you to ask your advice. I am a poor little
barn-cat, and I was contented with my lot till I saw you yesterday in
your beautiful home; but now I feel that I was intended for a higher
sphere. Tell me--oh, tell me, Mrs. Velvetpaw, how I may become a
house-cat!'

"'Well, did I ever!' said Mrs. Velvetpaw. 'The idea!' and she moved a
step or two away from poor Furry-Purry, her manner, as well as her
words, expressing astonishment and disdain.

"'I know it seems presuming, Mrs. Velvetpaw, but'--

"'Presuming! I should say so. What is this generation of cats coming to,
when a low creature reared in a barn--a paw-paw (pauper) cat, as I may
say--dare lift her eyes to those so far above her?'

"'I have heard my mother say "a cat may look at a king,"' said
Furry-Purry.

"'Go away, you low-born creature! How dare you quote your mother to me?
Go away, this instant! I am ashamed to be seen talking with you! What if
my friend Mrs. Silvercoat or Major Mouser should happen to pass! Begone,
I say! scat!'

"'O Mrs. Tabitha,' said the poor little cat, 'don't send me away! I
can't go back to that barn. Indeed, indeed, after spending this short
time in your company, I can never endure to live with Tom Skip-an'-jump
and Mrs. Barebones and that horrid Robber Grim. If you refuse to help me
I will go straight to Growler's kennel. When he has worried me to death,
won't you be sorry you drove me to such a fate? Dear, dear Mrs.
Velvetpaw, your face is kinder than your words. Oh, pity the sorrows of
a poor little cat!'

"Now, Mrs. Tabitha was not at heart an ill-natured puss; and when she
saw Furry-Purry's imploring face, and listened to her eloquent appeal,
she was moved with compassion.

"'Rather than see you go to the dogs,' said she, 'I will lend a paw to
help you. But what can I do, you silly thing?'

"'Mrs. Velvetpaw, you have lived a long time in this neighborhood?'

"'All my life, Yellow Cat.'

"'And you know every body?'

"'If you mean in the first rank of society--yes. Your Barebones, and
Hop-an'-jumps, and creatures of that vulgar herd, are quite out of my
_cat_egory.'

"'Perhaps you know of some house-cat dead or gone away?'

"'And if I do?'

"'You might put me in her place, you know.'

"'Yellow Cat,' said Mrs. Tabitha, severely.

"'If you please, my name is Furry-Purry.'

"'Well, Furry-Purry, then. Your presumption can only be pardoned in
consideration of your ignorance of the usages of society. House-cats,
you must know, hold their position in families by hereditary descent.
My place, for instance, was my mother's and my grandmother's before me.
We are prepared by birth and education for the position we occupy. Have
you considered how utterly unfitted you are for the life to which you
aspire? I am sorry to disappoint you, but I fear your hopes are vain.
There is, indeed, a vacancy in the brick house opposite. C?sar--a
venerable cat--died last week. He was much admired for his gentlemanly
and dignified deportment. "Who shall come after the king?"'

"'I, Mrs. Tabitha, I'--

"'You, indeed!' she interrupted, scornfully.

"'Oh, yes, if you will but condescend to give me instructions. I am
quick to learn. The short time I have been so happy as to be in your
company I have gained much knowledge. I am sure I can imitate the
_mew_-sic of your voice. I know I can gently wave my tail, and touch my
left whisker with my paw as you do. When I leave you I shall spend every
moment till we meet again in practising your airs and graces, till I
make them all my own. Dear friend,--if you will let me call you
so,--help me to King C?sar's place.'

"There was much that was flattering to Mrs. Velvetpaw in this speech.

"'Well,' said she, 'I will see what can be done. There, go home now, and
the first thing to be done is to make yourself perfectly clean. Wash
yourself twelve times in the day, from the end of your nose to the tip
of your tail. Take particular pains with your paws. A cat of refinement
is known by the delicacy and cleanliness of her feet. Farewell! After
three days, meet me here again.'

"You can imagine how faithfully Furry-Purry followed these
directions--how with her sharp tongue she smoothed and stroked every
hair of her pretty coat, and washed her face again and again with her
wet paws.

"'You are wretchedly thin!' Mrs. Tabitha said at their next meeting.
'That fault can only be remedied by a generous diet. You must look me
full in the face when I talk to you. Really, you have no need to be
ashamed of your eyes, for they are decidedly bright and handsome. When
you walk, don't bend your legs till your body almost touches the ground.
That gives you a wretchedly hang-cat appearance. Tread softly and
daintily, but with dignity and grace of carriage. There must be other
bad habits I have not mentioned.'

"'I am afraid I spit sometimes.'

"'Don't do that--it is considered vulgar. Don't bristle your tail. Don't
show your claws except to mice. Keep such control over yourself as never
to be surprised out of a dignified composure of manner.'

"Just here, without the slightest warning, there rushed from the thicket
near them a large fierce-looking dog. Up went Mrs. Velvetpaw's back in
an arch. Every hair of her body stood on end. Sharp-pointed claws
protruded from each velvet foot, and, hissing and spitting, she tumbled
over Furry-Purry in her haste, and scrambled to the topmost branch of
the pear-tree. The little cat followed, imitating her guide in every
particular. As for the dog, which was in pursuit of game, he did not
even look at them; and when he was out of sight they came down from the
tree, Mrs. Tabitha descending with the dignified composure she had just
recommended to her young friend. She made no allusion to her hurried
ascent.

"'To-morrow night,' said she, 'as soon as it is dark, meet me in the
backyard of the brick house.'

"Half glad and half frightened, Furry-Purry walked by her side the next
evening, delighting in the soft green turf of the yard and the
sweet-smelling shrubs against which she ventured to rub herself as they
passed. Mrs. Tabitha led her round the house to a piazza draped with
clustering vines.

"'Come here to-morrow,' said she. 'Walk boldly up the steps and seat
yourself in full view of that window. Look your prettiest--behave your
best. Assume a pensive expression of countenance, with your eyes
uplifted--so. If you are driven away, go directly, but return. Be
strong, be brave, be persevering. Now, my dear, I have done all I can
for you, and I wish you good luck,'

"The next morning a little girl living in the brick house, whose name
was Winnie Gay, looked out of the dining-room window.

"'Come quick, mamma!' she called; 'here's a cat on our piazza--a little
yellow cat, and she's looking right up at me. May I open the door?'

"'No, indeed!' said Mrs. Gay; 'we want no strange cats here.'

"'But she looks hungry, mamma. She has just opened her mouth at me
without making a bit of noise. Can't I give her a saucer of milk?'

"'Come away from the window, Winnie, and don't notice her. You will only
encourage her to come again. There, pussy, run away home; we can't have
you here.'

"'Now, mamma, you have frightened her. See how she keeps looking back.
I'm afraid you've hurt her feelings. Dear little pussy! I wish I might
call you back.'

"Furry-Purry was not discouraged at this her first unsuccessful attempt.
The child's blue eyes beamed a welcome, and the lady's face was gentle
and kind.

"'If I catch a mouse,' thought the cat, 'and bring it to them to show
what I can do, perhaps I shall gain their favor.' Then she put away all
the fine airs and graces Mrs. Velvetpaw had taught her, and became the
sly, supple, watchful creature nature had made her. By a hole in the
granary she crouched and waited with unwearied patience one, two, almost
three, hours. Then she gave a sudden spring, there was one sharp little
shriek from the victim, a snap of pussy's jaws, and her object was
accomplished. She appeared again on the piazza, and, laying a dead mouse
on the floor, crouched beside it in an attitude of perfect grace, and
looked beseechingly in Mrs. Gay's face.

"'Well, you _are_ a pretty creature!' that lady said, 'with your soft
white paws and yellow coat,'

"'May I have her for my cat, mamma?' Winnie said. 'I thought I never
should love another cat when dear old C?sar died; but this little thing
is such a beauty that I love her already. May I have her for mine?'

"But while Mrs. Gay hesitated, Furry-Purry, who could not hear what
they said, and who, to tell the truth, was in a great hurry to eat her
mouse, ran off with it to the barn. The next morning, however, she came
again, and Mr. Gay, who was waiting for his breakfast, was called to the
window.

"'My cat has come again, papa, with another mouse--a monstrous one,
too.'

"'That isn't a mouse,' Mr. Gay said, looking at the plump, silver-gray
creature Furry-Purry carefully deposited on the piazza-floor. 'Bless me!
I believe it is that rascal of a mole that's gnawed my hyacinth and
tulip bulbs. I offered the gardener's boy two dollars if he would catch
the villain. To whom does that cat belong, Winnie? She's worth her
weight in gold.'

"'I don't believe she belongs to anybody, papa; but I think she wants
to belong to us, for she keeps coming and coming. _May_ I have her for
mine? I am sure mamma will say yes if you are willing.'

"'Why not?' said he. 'Run for a saucer of milk, and we will coax her
in.'

"We who are acquainted with Furry-Purry's private history know how
little coaxing was needed.

"As soon as the door was opened she walked in, and, laying the dead mole
at Mr. Gay's feet, rubbed herself against his leg, purred gently, looked
up into his face with her round bright eyes, and, in very expressive cat
language, claimed him for her master. When he stooped to caress her, and
praised and petted her for the good service she had rendered him, the
happy creature rolled over and over on the soft carpet in an ecstasy of
delight.

"Then Winnie clapped her hands for joy.

"'You are our own cat,' she said. 'You shall have sugar and cream to
eat. You shall lie on C?sar's silk cushion; and because you are yellow,
and papa says you are worth your weight in gold, your name shall be Gold
Elsie,'

"So Furry-Purry became a family cat.

"The first time she met Mrs. Velvetpaw after this change in her life,
that excellent tabby looked at her with evident admiration.

"'How handsome you have grown!' said she; 'your eyes are topaz, your
breast and paws are the softest velvet, your coat is spun gold. My dear,
you are the belle of cats,'

"'Dear Mrs. Velvetpaw,' said Gold Elsie, 'my beauty and my prosperity I
owe in large measure to you. But for your wise counsels I should still
be a'--

"'Hush! don't speak the word. My dear, never again allude to your
origin. It is a profound secret. You are received in the best society.
Mrs. Silvercoat tells me it is reported that your master sought far and
wide to find a worthy successor to King C?sar, and that he esteems
himself specially fortunate in that, after great labor and expense, he
procured _you_. The ignorance you sometimes exhibit of the customs of
genteel society is attributed to your foreign breeding.'

"'Mrs. Tabitha, I feel at times a strong desire to visit my old friends
in the barn once more.'

"'Let me entreat you, my dear Miss Elsie, never again to think of it.'

"'But there is poor Mrs. Barebones almost gone with a consumption. I
should like to show her some kindness.'

"'Her sufferings are ended. She has passed to the land of cats,'

"'Poor Mrs. Barebones! and Robber Grim? Do you happen to have heard any
thing of him?'

"Silently Mrs. Tabitha beckoned her to follow, and, leading the way to
the orchard, pointed to a sour-apple tree, where Gold Elsie beheld a
ghastly sight. By a cord tied tightly about his neck, his jaws
distended, his one eye starting from its socket, hung Robber
Grim--stiff, motionless, dead.

"They hurried away, and presently Gold Elsie timidly inquired after her
former playmate, Tom Skip-an'-jump.

"'Don't, my dear!' said Mrs. Velvetpaw; 'really, I can not submit to be
farther _cat_echized. If you are truly grateful to me, Elsie, for the
service I have rendered you, and wish to do me credit in the high
position to which I have raised you, you must, you certainly must, break
every tie that binds you to your former life.'

"'I will, Mrs. Tabitha, I will,' said the little cat; and never again in
Mrs. Velvetpaw's presence did she mention Tom Skip-an'-jump's name,"

"And didn't she ever see him again?" Nellie Dimock wanted to know. "I am
sure there was no harm in Tom."

"Well, but you know she couldn't go with _that set_ any more after she
had got into good society," said Mollie Elliot.

"Mollie has caught Mrs. Velvetpaw's exact tone," said Florence Austin,
at which all the girls laughed.

"Well, I don't care," Mollie answered; "she was a nice little cat, and
deserved all her good fortune."




CHAPTER VI.

TOMMY TOMPKINS' YELLOW DOG.


"I have a letter to read to you this afternoon, girls," said Miss Ruth;
"also the story of a yellow dog. The letter is from a friend of mine who
spends her summers in a quiet village in Maine, in a fine old mansion
overlooking green fields and a beautiful lake with hills sloping down to
it on every side. Here is the letter she wrote me last June:--

"'We have come back again to our summer home--to the old house, the
broad piazza, the high-backed chairs, and the blue china. The clump of
cinnamon roses across the way is one mass of spicy bloom, and soon its
fragrance will be mingled with that of new-mown hay. There is nothing
new about the place but Don Quixote, the great handsome English mastiff.
Do you know the mastiff--his lion-like shape, his smooth, fawn-colored
coat, his black nose, and kind, intelligent eyes, their light-hazel
contrasting with the black markings around them? If you do, you must
pardon this description.

"'I am very fond of Don, and he of me. He belongs to our cousin, whose
house is but one field removed from ours; but he is here much of the
time. He evidently feels that both houses are under his protection, and
passes his nights between the two. Often we hear his slow step as he
paces the piazza round and round like a sentinel. He is only fifteen
months old, and of course feels no older than a little dog, though he
weighs one hundred and thirty pounds, and measures six feet from nose to
tail.

"'He can't understand why he isn't a lap-dog, and does climb our laps
after his fashion, putting up one hind leg and resting his weight upon
it with great satisfaction. We have good fun with him out of doors,
where his puppyhood quite gets the better of his dignity, and he runs in
circles and fetches mad bounds of pure glee.

"'One day, lying in my hammock, with Don on the piazza at my feet, I put
his charms and virtues together in verses, and I send them to you as the
most succinct account I can give of my new pet. As I conned them over,
repeating them half-aloud, at the frequent mention of his name Don
raised his head with an intelligent and appreciative look. Here are the
verses. I call them


DOG-GEREL.

        'Don! Don! beautiful Don!
    Graceful and tall, with majestic mien,
    Fawn-colored coat of the softest sheen,
    The stateliest dog that the sun shines on,
          Beautiful Don!

        Don! Don! frolicsome Don!
    Chasing your tail at a game of tag,
    Dancing a jig with a kitchen rag,
    Rearing and tearing, and all for fun,
          Frolicsome Don!

        Don! Don! affectionate Don!
    Looking your love with soft kind eyes,
    Climbing our laps, quite forgetting your size;
    With kissing and coaxing you never are done,
          Affectionate Don!

        Don! Don! chivalrous Don!
    Stalking all night piazza and yard,
    Sleepless and watchful, our sentinel guard,
    Squire of dames is the name you have won,
          Chivalrous Don!

        Don! Don! devotional Don!
    When the Bible is opened you climb to your place,
    And listen with solemn, immovable face,
    Nor frolic nor coax till the chapter is done,
          Devotional Don!

        Don! Don! wonderful Don!
    Devotional, faithful, affectionate one,
    If owning these virtues when only a pup,
    What will you be when you are grown up?
          Wonderful Don!'

"And now by way of contrast," said Miss Ruth as she folded the letter,
"I have a story to tell you of a poor little forlorn, homely,
insignificant dog, of low birth and no breeding, which was picked up on
the street by a boy I know, and which made for himself friends and a
good home by seizing the first opportunity that offered to do his duty
and protect the property of those who had taken him in. I have no doubt
that Don Quixote, intelligent, faithful, kind, with not a drop of
plebeian blood in his noble body, will fulfill all the expectations of
his friends, and we shall hear of many a brave and gallant deed of his
performing; but when you have heard what Tommy Tompkins has to tell, I
think you will say that not even Don Quixote could have done himself
more credit under the circumstances than


TOMMY TOMPKINS' YELLOW DOG.

"Tommy shall tell the story as he told it to me:--

"'Yes, marm, he's my dog. His name's Grip. My father paid five dollars
for that dog. You look as if you thought he wasn't worth it; but I
wouldn't take twice the money for him, not if you was to pay it over
this minute. I know he ain't a handsome dog. I don't think yellow is a
pretty color for a dog, do you? and I wish he had a little more of a
tail. Liz says he's cur-tailed (Liz thinks it's smart to make puns), but
he'll look a great deal better when his ear gets well and his hair grows
out and covers the bare spots--don't you think so? But father says,
"Handsome is that handsome does," and nobody can say but that our dog
did the handsome thing when he saved over two hundred dollars in money
and all mother's silver spoons and lots of other things from being
stolen--hey, Grip? We call him Grip 'cause he hung on to that fellow so
till the policeman got in to take him.

"'What fellow? Why, the burglar, of course. Didn't you read about it in
the newspaper? There was a long piece published about it the day after
it happened, with headings in big letters: "The house No. 35 Wells
Avenue, residence of Thomas Tompkins, the well-known dealer in hardware,
cutlery, etc., was entered last night by burglars. Much valuable
property saved through the courage and pluck of a small dog belonging to
the family." They didn't get that part right, for he didn't belong to us
then. You just wait, and I'll read the whole piece to you. I've got it
somewhere in my pockets. You see, I cut it out of the paper to read to
the boys at school.

"'You'd rather I told you about it? Well. Lie down, Grip! Be quiet!
can't you? He don't mean any thing by sniffing round your ankles in that
way; anyhow, he won't catch hold unless I tell him to; but you see,
ever since that night he wants to go for every strange man or woman that
comes near the place. Liz says "he's got burglars on the brain."

"'I guess I'll begin at the beginning and tell you how I came by him.
One night after school I'd been down to the steamboat landing on an
errand for father, and along on River Street there was a crowd of
loafers round two dogs in a fight. This dog was one of 'em, and the
other was a bulldog twice his size. The bulldog's master was looking on,
without so much as trying to part 'em; but nobody was looking after the
yellow dog: he didn't seem to have any master. Well, I want to see fair
play in every thing. It makes me mad to see a fellow thrash a boy half
his size, or a big dog chew up a little one. So I steps up and says to
the bulldog's master, "Why don't you call off your dog?" but he only
swore at me and told me to mind my own business.

"'Well, I know a trick or two about dogs, and I ran into a grocer's shop
close by and got two cents' worth of snuff, and I let that bulldog have
it all right in his face and eyes. Of course he had to let go to sneeze;
and I grabbed the yellow dog and ran. It was great fun. I could hear
that dog sneezing and coughing, and his master yelling to me, but I
never once held up or looked behind me till I was half-way up Brooks
Street.

"'Then I set the yellow dog down on the sidewalk and looked him over.
My! he's a beauty now to what he was then, for he's clean and well-fed
and respectable looking; but then he was nothing but skin and bone, and
covered all over with mud and dirt, and one ear was torn and one eye
swelled shut, and he limped when he walked, and--well, never mind, old
Grip! you was all right inside, wasn't you?

"'Well, I never dreaded any thing more in all my life than taking that
dog home. Mother hates dogs. She never would have one in the house,
though I've always wanted a dog of my own. I knew Liz would call him a
horrid little monster, and Fred would poke fun at me--and, oh, dear! I'd
rather have gone to the dentist's or taken a Saturday-night scrub than
go into that dining-room with Grip at my heels.

"'But it had to be done. They were all at supper, and mother took it
just as I was afraid she would. If she only would have waited and let
me tell how I came by the dog, I thought maybe she would have felt sorry
for the poor thing; but she was in such a hurry to get his muddy feet
off the dining-room carpet that she wouldn't listen to a single word I
said, but kept saying, "Turn him out! turn him out!" till I found it was
no use, and I was just going to do as she said when father looked up
from his supper, and says he: "Let the boy tell his story, mother. Where
did you get the dog, Tommy?" "'We were all surprised, for father hardly
ever interfered with mother about us children--he's so taken up with
business, you know, he hasn't any time left for the family. But I was
glad enough to tell him how I came by the dog; and he laughed, and said
he didn't see any objection to my keeping him over night. I might give
him some supper and tie him up in the shed-chamber, and in the morning
he'd have him taken round to Police-station C, where, if he wasn't
claimed in four days, he'd be taken care of.

"'I knew well enough how they'd take care of him at Station C. They'd
shoot him--that's what they do to stray dogs without any friends. But
anyhow, I could keep him over night, for mother would think it was all
right, now father had said so. So I took him to the shed-chamber and
gave him a good supper,--how he did eat!--and I found an old mat for him
to lie on, and got a basin of warm water and some soap, and washed him
as clean as I could and rubbed him dry, and made him warm and
comfortable: and he licking my hands and face and wagging his stump of
a tail and thanking me for it as plain as though he could talk.

"'But oh, how he hated to be tied up! Fact is, he made such a fuss I
stayed out there with him till past my bed-time; and when at last I had
to go I left him howling and tugging at the string. Well, I went to
sleep, and, after a while, I woke up, and that dog was at it still. I
could hear him howl just as plain, though the shed-chamber was at the
back of the house, ever so far from my room. I knew mother hadn't come
upstairs, for the gas was burning in the halls, as she always turned it
off the last thing; and I thought to myself: "If she hears the dog when
she comes up, maybe she'll put him out, and I never shall see him
again." And before I knew what I was about I was running through the
hall and the trunk-room, and so out into the shed. It was pitch dark
out there, but I found my way to Grip easy enough by the noise he made
when he saw me; and it didn't take long to untie the string and catch
him up and run back with him to my room. I knew he would be as still as
a mouse in there with me. You were lonesome out there in the shed,
weren't you, Grip?

"'What would mother say? Well, you see, I meant to keep awake till she
came upstairs and tell her all about it; but I was so tired I dropped
asleep in a minute, and the first thing I knew I was dreaming that I was
running up Brooks Street with Grip in my arms, and the bull-dog close
after us, and just as he was going to spring mother screamed, and
somebody kept saying, "'St, boy! 'st, boy! stick to him, good dog!
stick to him!" And then I woke up, and mother really was screaming, and
'twas Fred who was saying, "Stick to him! stick to him!" And the gas was
lit in the hall, and there was a great noise and hubbub out there, and I
rushed out, and there was a man on the floor and the yellow dog had him
by the throat. Father stood in the door-way with his pistol cocked, and
he said in a quiet kind of way (just as father always speaks when he
means business): "If you stir you are a dead man!" But I should like to
know how he could stir with that grip on his throat!

"'Then there came a banging and ringing at our front door, and Fred ran
to open it, and in rushed our policeman--I mean the one that takes our
street on his beat. He had heard the noise outside, you see, and, for a
wonder, was on hand when he was wanted; and he just went for that fellow
on the floor and clapped a pair of handcuffs on his wrists as quick as
you could turn your hand over; and when he got a look at him he says:
"Oh, it's you, Bill Long, is it? We've been wanting you for some time at
the lodge (that was his name for the police-station). Well, get up and
come along!"

"'But I called the dog off.

"'We didn't one of us go to bed again that night. Father and Fred looked
through the house, and father said it was the neatest piece of work in
the burglary line he ever saw done--real professionals, they were. There
was two of 'em. They'd taken plenty of time. The forks and the spoons
and the two hundred dollars in money was all done up in neat packages,
and they'd been through father's desk and the secretary drawers; and
they'd had a lunch of cold chicken and mince-pie, and left the marks of
their greasy hands on the best damask napkins Bridget had ironed that
day and left to air by the kitchen range. And then, you see, while one
stayed below to keep watch, the other went up to finish the job; and he
would have finished it, too, and both would have got away with all the
things if it hadn't have been for that dog. Look at him! will you? I
believe he understands every word I say as well as you do.

"'Well, right at the door of father's room, Grip took him. How did he
lay the fellow on his back? We suppose he was creeping into the room on
his hands and knees,--they often do, father says,--and the dog made a
rush at him in front and gripped him in the throat, and the weight of
the dog threw him backward; and once down, Grip kept him there--see?

"'Next morning at breakfast father said: "Tommy, how came the dog in the
upper hall last night? I told you to tie him up in the shed-chamber."
Then I had to own up, and tell how I went late in the evening and
brought him to my room because he howled so. I said I was real sorry,
and father said he would try to forgive me, seeing it all turned out
well, and if Grip hadn't been there we should have lost so much money.
And says I: "Father, don't you mean to take him round to Station C this
morning?" "No, I don't," says father. Then mother said she didn't know
but she'd about as soon lose the silver as to keep such a dog as that
in the house, and Fred said if I must have a dog, why didn't father get
me a black-and-tan terrier--"or a lovely pug," says Liz; and between 'em
they got me so stirred up I didn't know what to do. I said I didn't want
a black-and-tan, and I'd throw a pug out of the window! And if nobody
wanted to keep Grip, we'd go off together somewhere and earn our living,
and I guessed the next time burglars got into the house and carried off
all the money and things because we weren't there to stop 'em, they'd be
sorry they 'd treated us so. Then I looked out of the window and winked
hard to keep from crying. Wasn't I a silly?

"'For they were only teasing me, and every one of them wanted to keep
Grip. Well, that's all. No, it isn't quite all either; for one morning
a man came to the house and wanted to see father--horrid man with a red
face and a squint in one eye. I remembered him right away. He was one of
the crowd looking on at the dog-fight down in River Street. He said he'd
lost a dog, a very valuable dog, and he'd heard we'd got him. Father
asked what kind of a dog, and he said yellow, and went on describing our
Grip exactly, till I couldn't hold in another minute for fear father
would let him have the dog. So I got round behind father's chair and
whispered: "Buy him, father! buy him!"

"'Fred called me a great goony, and said if I'd kept still father could
have got the dog for half what he paid for him. Just because Fred is
sixteen he thinks he knows every thing, and he's always lording it over
me. He says I'll never make a business man--I ain't sharp enough. But I
think five dollars is cheap enough for a dog that can tackle a burglar
and scare off tramps and pedlars--don't you?'"




CHAPTER VII.

ONE DAY IN A MODEL CITY.


"I will tell you, to-day," said Miss Ruth, after the members of her
Society were quietly settled at their work, "about a race of little
people who lived thousands and thousands of years ago. When the great
trees were growing, out of which the coal we use was made, this race
inhabited the earth as they do now in great numbers. We know this
because their bodies are found perfectly preserved in pieces of coal and
amber. Amber, you know, is a kind of gum that drops from certain trees
and hardens, becoming very transparent and of a pretty yellow color. It
is supposed that the little creatures found imbedded in it came to
their death in running up the trunks of these trees, their feet sticking
in the soft gum, and drop by drop trickling down on them till they were
fast imprisoned in a beautiful transparent tomb.

"I remember seeing once at a museum a small black ant preserved in
amber, and he looked so natural and lifelike, so like the ants we see
running about to-day, that it was hard to realize that he came to his
death so long, so very long ago; in fact, before this earth of ours was
ready for the creation of man. What strange sights those little
bead-eyes of his must have seen!

"When our ancestors were rude barbarians, living in caves and in holes
they dug in the ground, the little people dwelt in cities built with
wonderful skill and ingenuity; and while our forefathers were leading a
rude, selfish life,--herding together, it is true, but with no organized
government or fixed principles of industry and good order, living each
one for himself, the strong oppressing the weak,--the little folks were
ruled by a strict civil and military code. They lived together as
brethren, having all things in common--were temperate, cleanly,
industrious, civilized.

"Well, there are plenty of their descendants living all about us to-day,
and I want you to become better acquainted with them, for they are very
wise and cunning in their ways. Whenever you cross a meadow, or even
when you are walking on the public road, unless you take heed to your
steps, the chances are that you set your foot more than once on a little
heap of loose sand that we call an ant-hill. The next time you discover
the accident--I am sure you will not do it on purpose--wait a few
moments and see what will happen. What you have done is to block up the
main entrance to an underground city, sending a quantity of loose earth
down the avenue, which the inhabitants must at great labor remove.

"Let us hope none of the little people were at that instant either
leaving or entering the city by that gate, for if so, they were either
killed outright or badly hurt. Soon you will see one and another citizen
pushing his way through the _d¨¦bris_, running wildly and excitedly
about, as though greatly frightened and distressed at the state of
things. Then more carefully surveying the ruins, apparently consulting
together as to what is best to be done, until, a plan of action having
been devised and settled upon, if you wait long enough, you will see a
band of workers in an orderly, systematic manner begin to repair the
damage. All this happens every time you tread on an ant-hill. If a
passing animal breaks down the embankment,--a horse or a cow,--of course
the injury done is much greater. In such a case every worker in the city
is put to hard labor till the streets are cleared, the houses rebuilt,
and all traces of the disaster removed.

"I am sure you will be interested to know what goes on from morning till
night in one of these ant-cities, and I have written out on purpose to
read to you this afternoon an account of one day's proceedings. I call
my paper


LIFE IN AN ANT-HILL; OR, ONE DAY IN A MODEL CITY.

"At sunrise the doors and gates were opened, and every body was awake
and stirring, from the queen in her palace to the servants who brought
in the meals and kept things tidy about the houses; and then, in
accordance with a good old custom handed down from generation to
generation, the first thing every body did on getting out of bed was to
take a bath. Such a washing and scrubbing and sponging off and rubbing
down as went on in every house, you can imagine. It made no difference
what kind of work one was going about,--plastering, brick-laying, or
digging of ditches,--like a sensible fellow, he went fresh and clean to
it every day.

"Of course the queen-mother and the little princes and princesses, with
a palace full of servants to wait on them, had all these offices of the
toilet performed for them; but what do you think of common working
folks going about from house to house to help each other wash up for the
day? Fancy having a neighbor step in bright and early to wash your face
and hands for you, or give you a sponge-bath, or a nice dry rub!

"After the wash came milking-time. Now, all the cows were pastured
outside the city, and the servants who had the care of them hurried off
as fast as they could, because the milk was needed for breakfast,
especially for the babies. A beautiful road led to the milking-ground,
broad and level, and so clean and well kept that not a stick or stone or
rut or mud-hole was to be found in it from beginning to end. And this
was true of all the streets and avenues, lanes and alleys, about the
city.

"I don't know how they managed to keep them in such good
condition--whether they appointed street commissioners or a committee on
highways; but I wish those who have the care of the roads in Greenmeadow
would take a lesson from them, so that two little girls I know needn't
be kept from church so many Sundays in the spring because the mud is
deep at the crossings.

"But I must tell you about the cows. There were a great many of them
quietly feeding in their pleasant pasture, and they were of several
different kinds. I don't know by what names their masters called them,
but I do know these gentle creatures were to them just what the pretty
Alderneys and Durhams are to us, and that they were treated with all the
kindness and consideration the wise farmer gives to his domestic
animals. There was one kind, a little white cow with queer crooked horns
and quite blind. These they made pets of, not putting them out to
pasture with the rest of the herd, but allowing them to walk the streets
and go in and out of the houses at their pleasure, treating them much as
we treat our cats and dogs.

"While the milking was going on, every cow was stroked and patted and
gently caressed, and the good little creatures responded to this
treatment by giving down their milk without a kick or a single toss of
the horns. Such nice milk as it was--as sweet and as rich as honey! and
the babies who fed on it got as fat as little pigs.

"By the time breakfast was over, the sun was well up, and all in the
city went about the day's business. There was much building going on,
for the place was densely populated and was growing rapidly. Great
blocks were rising, story upon story, every part going on at the same
time, with halls and galleries and closets and winding staircases, all
connected and leading into each other, after a curious and wonderful
fashion. Of course it took a great many workmen to construct these
buildings--carpenters, masons, bricklayers, plasterers, besides
architects and engineers; for the houses were all built on scientific
principles, and there were under-ground passages to be built that
required great skill and practical knowledge in their construction.

"The mortar and bricks were made outside the city gates, and all day
gangs of workers journeyed back and forth to bring in supplies. They
were hurrying, bustling, busy, but in good order and at perfect
understanding with each other. If one stopped to exchange greetings with
an acquaintance, to hear a bit of gossip perhaps, or to tell the latest
news, he would pick up his load in a great hurry and start off at a
round trot, as though he meant to make up for lost time. More than one
overburdened worker was eased of a part of his load, some good-natured
comrade adding it to his own. Thousands of bricks and as many loads of
mortar were brought into the city by these industrious people every day,
and their work was done quietly, thoroughly, and with wonderful
quickness and precision.

"All this while there was plenty of indoor work going on; and the
queen's body-guard, the babies' nurses, the attendants on the princes
and princesses, the waiters and tenders, the sweepers and cleaners--all
were as busy as you please. It was a pretty sight to see the nurses
bring the babies out-of-doors for a sun-bath. The plump little
things--some of them wrapped in mantles of white or yellow silk, others
with only their skins to cover them--were laid down in soft spots on the
grass, where they were watched with the tenderest care by their
foster-mothers. If they were hungry, they had but to open their mouths
and there was plenty of food ready for them. If so much as a breath of
wind stirred the grass, or a little cloud obscured the sun, every nurse
snatched a baby and scampered back with it to the nursery, lest it
should take cold.

"At noon the queen, attended by her body-guard, made a royal progress
through the city. She was of a portly presence, had pretty silky hair,
and was dressed plainly in dark velvet. The little princesses wore
ruffles and silk mantillas, of all the colors of the rainbow; but the
queen-mother had far more important business to attend to than the
adornment of her person, and in her self-devotion to her commonwealth
had long ago, of her own free will, laid aside flounces and furbelows.
What a good motherly body she was! and how devoted her subjects were to
her! Every-where she went she was followed by an admiring crowd. No home
was too humble for her to enter, and under each roof she was received
with the liveliest demonstrations of loyalty and delight. The happy
people thronged about her. They skipped, they danced, they embraced
each other in their joy. At times it was hard to restrain them within
proper bounds of respect to the royal person; but the guard well
understood their duties. They watched her every step, shielding and
protecting her with respectful devotion. They formed a barrier about her
when she rested, offered her refreshment at her first symptom of
weariness, and presently conducted her in regal state back to the
palace, hastening her progress at the last, that she might be spared the
sight of a sad little cavalcade just then approaching the gate.

"There had been an accident to the workers employed in excavating an
under-ground road. A portion of the earth-works had caved in, and two
unfortunates had been buried in the ruins. Their companions, after hours
of arduous and indefatigable labor, had succeeded in recovering the
bodies, and were bringing them home for burial; while a third
victim--still living, but grievously crushed and wounded--was borne
tenderly along, with frequent stoppages by the way as his weakness
required. A crowd of sympathizing neighbors and friends went out to meet
the wonderful procession. Strong, willing arms relieved the weary
bearers of their burden, and the sufferer was conveyed to his home,
where his poor body was cleansed, and a healing ointment of wonderful
efficacy and power applied to his wounds. Meanwhile the corpses were
decently disposed outside the gates, awaiting burial; graves were
prepared in the cemetery, and at sunset the funeral took place.

"But the day was not to end with this sad ceremony; for at twilight a
sentinel ran in with the glad news that two well-beloved citizens, sent
on an embassy to a distant country, and who had remained so long away
that they had been given up for dead, were returning: in fact, were at
that moment coming up the avenue to the gate. Then was there great
rejoicing, the whole city turning out to welcome them; and the poor
travelers, footsore and weary, and ready but now to lie down and die by
the road-side, so spent were they by the perils and hardships they had
undergone, suddenly found themselves within sight of home, surrounded by
friends, companions, brothers, who embraced them rapturously, praising
them for their fortitude and bravery, pitying their present weakness,
caressing, cheering, comforting them. So they were brought in triumph
back to their beloved city, where a banquet was prepared in honor of
their return.

"So general and engrossing was the interest felt in this event, that a
public calamity had well-nigh followed. The attendants on the princes
and princesses (usually most vigilant and faithful), in the excitement
of the occasion, forgot their charge, and the young folks instantly
seized the opportunity to rush out of the city by a side gate; and when
they were discovered were half-way across the meadow, and making for the
wood beyond. In this wood (very dark and dreary) great danger, possibly
death, would have overtaken them; but the silly things, impatient of the
wholesome restraint in which, by order of the government, they were held
till they should arrive at years of discretion, thought only of gaining
their freedom, and were pushing on at a great pace, frisking and
frolicking together as they went. They were, however, seen in time to
avert the catastrophe, speedily brought back to duty, and given
decidedly, though respectfully, to understand that, though scions of a
royal race, they were still to consider themselves under tutors and
governors.

"Then all was quiet. The gates were closed, the good little people laid
themselves down to sleep, the sentinels began their watch, and night
settled down upon the peaceful city. Presently the moon rose, lighting
its single shapely dome, the deserted road lately trod-den by so many
busy feet, and the dewy meadow where the cattle were resting.

"And now I wish we might say goodnight to the simple, kindly people
whose occupations we have followed for a day, leaving them in the
assurance that many such days were to follow, and that they were long to
enjoy the peace and prosperity they so richly deserved. How pleasant to
think of them building their houses, tending their flocks, taking care
of the little ones, waiting upon their good queen, in the practice of
all those virtues that make a community happy and prosperous! But, alas!
this very day the chieftains of a neighboring tribe had met and planned
an assault upon this quiet city that was to result in great loss of
property and life, and of that which to them was far more precious than
either.

"There was not the shadow of an excuse for the invasion. The hill
people--a fierce, brave tribe, trained under a military government, and
accustomed to fighting from their youth--had no quarrel with the
citizens of the plain, who had no mind to fight with their neighbors or
to interfere with any one's rights. But the hill people were
slave-holders, and, whenever their establishments wanted replenishing,
they sent out an army to attack some neighboring city; and if they
gained the victory (as they were pretty sure to do, for they were a
fierce, brave race), they would rush into every house in the city and
carry off all the babies they could find, to be brought up as slaves.

"And this is what they had planned to do to the pretty city lying asleep
in the moonlight on a July evening.

"They started about noon--a large body of infantry, making a fine show;
for they wore polished armor as black as jet, that shone in the sun, and
every one of them carried a murderous weapon. The advance guard was
made up of the biggest and bravest, while the veterans, and the young
soldiers who lacked experience, brought up the rear.

"They had a long wearisome march across a rocky plain and up a steep
hill. Then there was a river to cross, and on the other side a stretch
of desert land, where the hot sun beat upon their heads, and where it
must have been hard to keep up the rapid pace at which they marched. But
they pressed on, and woe to him who stumbled and fell! for not a soldier
was allowed to stop an instant to help his fallen comrade. The whole
army swept on and over him, and there was no straggling from the close
ranks or resting for one instant till the day's journey was
accomplished.

"The last stage of the journey was through a dreary wood. Here they
were exposed to many unseen dangers. Beasts of prey sprang out upon and
devoured them. A big bird swooped down and carried aloft some poor
wretch whose fate it was to fill the hungry maw of a baby bird. And many
an unfortunate, getting entangled in a soft gray curtain of silk that
hung across the path, struggled vainly to extricate himself, till the
hairy monster which had woven the snare crept out of his den and cracked
his bones and sucked the last drop of his blood.

"It was night when, weary and dusty, the army reached the borders of the
wood. But they forgot both their fatigue and their losses by the way
when they saw before them in the middle of a green meadow, its dome
glittering in the light of the setting sun, the pretty, prosperous city
they had braved all these dangers to rob.

"They rested that night, but were on the march soon after sunrise. A few
rushed forward to surprise the sentinels on guard, while the main body
of the army advanced more slowly, in solid phalanx, their brave
coats-of-mail catching the early rays of the sun.

"Meanwhile the peaceful inhabitants, all unconscious of coming disaster,
pursued their usual occupations--waiting on the queen-mother, milking
the kine, building houses, cleaning the streets. Then came the alarm:
'The foe is at the gate!' and you should have seen of what brave stuff
the little folks were made; how each one left his occupation or dropped
his implement of labor, and from palace, hall, and hut, ran out to
defend the beloved city. Only the queen's body-guard remained and a few
of the nurses left in charge of the babies.

"And it was wonderful to mark how their courage gave them strength.
Their assailants were of a taller, stronger race than they; but the
little folks had the advantage in numbers, were quiet and light in their
movements, and possessed a double portion of the bravery good patriots
feel in the defence of the commonwealth.

"They threw themselves face to face and limb to limb upon their
assailants. With their living bodies they raised a wall across the track
of the army, and, as they came once and again, and yet again, they drove
them back. Hundreds were slain at every onslaught, but hundreds
instantly filled their places. There were plenty of single combats. One
would throw himself upon his antagonist and cling there till he was cut
in pieces and fell to the ground, and another and another would spring
to take his place to meet the same fate. Dozens fought together--heads,
legs, and bodies intertwining in an indistinguishable mass, each held in
a savage grip that only loosened in death. A dozen devoted themselves to
certain death for the chance of killing a single antagonist. Surely such
desperate bravery, such generous heroism, deserved to gain a victory!

"But there was a sudden rush, a break in the ranks, and, lo! the little
people were running back to the city,--back in all haste,--if, by any
possibility, they might save from the victor's clutch the treasures they
prized most. But what availed their efforts? The enemy was close behind
them, forcing their way through the main entrance and the side gates,
till the whole army was pouring into the devoted city.

"Can you imagine the scene that followed? The queen-mother and the young
princes and princesses were left undisturbed in their apartments, but
into every other house in the city, the rude soldiers rushed, searching
for the poor babies. Many of them their nurses had hidden away, hoping
that in the confusion their hiding-places would not be discovered; but
the cunning fellows--old hands some of them at the business--seemed to
know just where to look. Hundreds and hundreds of little ones were
captured that day. The faithful attendants clasped and clung to them,
suffering themselves to be torn in pieces before giving them up, but the
sacrifice was in vain.

"The moon shone down that night upon a ghastly scene. The dead and
dying strewed the ground, and the avenues leading to the city were
choked with the slain. Hundreds of homes were made desolate, that only
the night before were full of peaceful content.

"Meanwhile, the conquering army, laden with spoils, after another
difficult and toilsome journey had reached their home. The captive
babies were consigned to the care of slaves, procured long ago in a
similar way, and who, apparently contented and happy, for they knew no
other life, devoted all their energies to the service of their captors.

"Well, it is an old story. Ever since the world began the strong have
oppressed the weak,--and ants or men, for greed or gold, will do their
neighbors wrong."

"Well," said Mollie, as Miss Ruth laid down the last sheet of her
manuscript, "if you hadn't told us beforehand that it was ants you were
going to read about I should certainly have thought they were people.
Don't they act for all the world just like folks? and who would ever
think such little creatures could be so wise!"

"What I want to know," said Susie, "is, If the ant-cities are
underground, how can any one see what goes on in them?"

"That is easily managed," Miss Ruth answered.

"A nest is taken up with a quantity of the earth that surrounds it, then
it is cut down from the top--as you would halve a loaf of bread--and the
divided parts are placed in glass cases made purposely to receive them.
Of course, the little people are greatly disturbed for a time, and no
wonder; but they soon grow accustomed to the new surroundings and go on
with their every-day employments as if nothing had happened. The sides
of the case make a fine firm wall for their city; they are furnished
with plenty of food and building material, and soon they can be seen
busy at work clearing their streets, building houses, feeding the
babies, and quite contented and happy in their glass city. If, after
months of separation, an ant from one half of the divided nest should be
put into the other he would be recognized at once and welcomed with joy;
but if a stranger were introduced he would be attacked and probably
killed."

"We had a great time with the ants at our house last summer," said Eliza
Jones: "little mites of red things, you know, and they _would_ get into
the cake-chest and the sugar-bucket, and bothered ma so she had to keep
all the sweet things on a table with its legs in basins of water. They
couldn't get over that, you see."

"Why not?" Mollie asked. "Can't they swim?"

"Ours couldn't; lots of them fell in the water and were drowned."

"Ants are usually quite helpless in the water," Miss Ruth said, "though
a French writer who has made the little folks a study, tells a story of
six soldier ants who rescued their companions from drowning. He put his
sugar-basin in a vessel of water, and several adventurous ants climbed
to the ceiling and dropped into it. Four missed their aim and fell
outside the bowl in the water. Their companions tried in vain to rescue
them, then went away and presently returned accompanied by six
grenadiers, stout fellows, who immediately swam to their relief, seized
them with their pincers and brought them to land. Three were apparently
dead, but the faithful fellows licked and rubbed them quite dry, rolling
them over and over, stretching themselves on them, and in a truly
skillful and scientific manner sought to bring back life to their
benumbed bodies. Under this treatment three came to life, while one only
partly restored was carefully borne away. 'I have seen it' is Du Pont de
Nervours's comment on what he thinks may be considered a marvelous
story, though it seems no more wonderful to me than many well-attested
facts in the lives of the little people."

"It's all wonderful," Susie said. "It seems as though they must think
and reason and plan just as we do. Don't you think so, Auntie?"

"Indeed I do, Susie. One who has long studied their ways ranks them next
to man in the scale of intelligence, and says the brain of an ant--no
larger perhaps than a fine grain of sand--must be the most wonderful
particle of matter in the world."

"But they can't talk, Auntie?"

"I am not so sure of that. Their voices may be too fine and high-pitched
for our great ears to hear. I fancy there is a deal of conversation
carried on in the grass and the bushes and the trees, that we know
nothing about."

"How funny! What did you mean, Auntie, when you said the queen laid off
all her flounces and furbelows."

"I was rather fancifully describing her wings, dear, which she takes off
herself when she enters the nest, having no further use for them. There
are three kinds of ants in every nest: perfect males and females, and
the workers. There are many different races of ants, from the great
white ant of Africa--a terror to the natives, though in some respects
his good friend--down to the little red-and-yellow meadow ants so common
among us. The ants I have told you about, the Rufians and the Fuscans,
are natives of America, and are found in New England. The big black ant
so common here, sometimes called the jet ant, is a carpenter and a
wood-carver. His great jaws bore through the hardest wood, and his
pretty galleries and winding staircases penetrate through the beams and
rafters of many an old mansion. Not long ago I accidentally killed a
carpenter ant, and in a few minutes a comrade appeared who slowly, and
apparently with great labor and fatigue, bore away the body. I felt as
though I were looking on at a funeral.

"I wish I had time to tell you about the agricultural ant of Texas, and
the umbrella ants of Florida, who cut bits of leaf from the orange-trees
and march home with them in procession, holding each leaf in an upright
position. Fancy how odd they must look! But we have talked long enough
for this time about the little people, and I am sure you all agree with
King Solomon that they are 'exceeding wise.'"

"I never will step on an ant-hill again if I can possibly help it," said
Susie. "It's too bad to make those hard-working folks so much trouble.

"And I mean to put my ear close down to the ground," said Nellie Dimock,
"and listen and listen, so as to hear the ants talk to each other."




CHAPTER VIII.

THE STORY OF OLD STAR.


"Say, Sam!" said Roy Tyler, as the two boys were driving old Brindle
home from pasture the next evening, "don't you wish she'd tell us some
stories about horses? I'm tired of hearing about cats and ants."

"Well, I don't know," Sammy answered; "'twas funny about old Robber
Grim. There's just such an old cat round our barn, catchin' chickens and
suckin' eggs. I've fired more rocks at that feller--hit him once in the
hind leg an' he went off limpin'."

"Well, I want a horse story, and I know she'd just as soon tell one as
not, if somebody would only ask her. Those girls will be wantin'
another cat story if we don't start something else. Girls always do like
cats," said Roy, a little scornfully. "Say, Sam, you ask her, will you?"

"Why don't you ask her yourself?"

"Oh, I don't know. I tried to yesterday, but somehow I couldn't get it
out."

"Well, I'll tell you what I will do," said good-natured Sammy. "You come
round to-night after I get my chores done up, and we'll go together and
have it over with."

"All right; I'll come," said Roy.

They found Miss Ruth alone, for it was Thursday night and the minister's
family were at the prayer-meeting. The September evening was chilly, and
she was sitting before an open fire.

"You do the talking," Roy whispered at the door, and accordingly Sammy,
after fidgeting in his seat a little, opened the subject.

"Roy wants me to ask you," he began, and then stopped at a punch in the
side from Roy's knuckles, and began again: "Me and Roy would like--if it
wouldn't be too much trouble, and you'd just as soon as not--to have you
tell us a horse story next time." Then in a loud whisper aside to Roy:
"You _did_ ask me! You know you did."

"Well, you needn't put it all on me, if I did," Roy answered, in the
same tone.

Miss Ruth appeared not to notice this by-play.

"A horse story," she said pleasantly; "yes, why not?"

"You see," Sammy continued, "we like to hear about cats well enough, and
that ant battle was first-rate--I'd like to have seen it, I know; but
Roy, he says the girls might be writin' notes askin' you to tell more
cat stories and--and--well"--

"Yes, I see," she said; "too much of a good thing. Well, I will tell no
more cat stories, and it shall be all horse next Wednesday. Will that
suit you, Sammy? And Roy, do you like horses very much?"

"Yes, 'm," said Roy, bashfully.

"He says," said Sammy, rather enjoying the office of spokesman, "when he
grows up he means to have a fast trotter. I'd like to own a good horse
myself," continued Sam.

"I know a boy about your age," said Miss Ruth, "whose father gave him,
for a birthday present, a Canadian pony; a funny looking little beast,
not much larger than a big dog, but strong enough to carry double
Herbert's weight."

"Like the Shetland ponies at the show?"

"Yes; but larger, and not so costly. He is a thick-set, shaggy fellow,
always looking as if he were not half-groomed, with his coat all rough
and tumbled, his legs covered with thick hair, his mane hanging on both
sides of his neck, and his forelock always getting into his bright
little eyes."

"What color?" said Roy.

"Dark brown; not handsome, but so affectionate and intelligent that you
would love him dearly. He is as frolicsome as a kitten, and I laughed
and laughed again to see him racing round the yard, hardly able to see
for the shag of hair tumbling over his eyes, playing queer tricks and
making uncouth gambols, more like a big puppy than a small horse. To be
sure he has a will of his own, and has more than once--just for
fun--thrown his young master over his head; but he always stands stock
still till the boy is on his back again, and as Herbert says: 'It is
only a little way to fall from his back to the ground.'"

"How fast will he go?" Roy asked.

"Fast enough for a boy to ride. From five to seven miles an hour,
perhaps, and keep it up all day, if need be, for the Canadian horses
have great strength and endurance. The last time I saw Herbert he told
me a pretty story about Elf King."

"Is that his name?"

"Yes; isn't it a pretty name? Elf for fairy, you know, and King for the
head of the fairies. But perhaps I am keeping you, boys. Is there any
thing you ought to be doing at home?"

"No, no!" both answered together, and Sammy answered that he did up all
his chores before he came away.

"Very well; then I will tell you about Elf King's visit to the
blacksmith."

"Instead of next Wednesday?"

"Oh, dear, no! I have a long story for next Wednesday. This is very
short, and doesn't count; is just a little private entertainment thrown
in on our own account."

Roy, who had all this time sat uncomfortably on the edge of his chair,
settled back, and Sammy made use of his favorite expression:--

"All right!"

"When Elf King came into Herbert's possession he had never been shod;
but very soon he was taken to the village blacksmith and four funny
little shoes fitted to his feet, which, when he was accustomed to, he
liked very much.

"One day the blacksmith saw the pony trotting up to his shop without a
halter. He supposed the little thing had strayed from home, and drove
him off, and when he refused to go, threw stones at him to make him run
away. But in a few moments back he came again. When the blacksmith went
out a second time to drive him off he noticed his feet and saw that one
shoe was missing. So he made a shoe, the pony standing by, quietly
waiting. When the new shoe was fitted Elf King pawed two or three times
to see if it felt comfortable, gave a pleased little neigh, as much as
to say, 'Yes, that's all right; thank you!' and started for home on a
brisk trot.

"Think how surprised and pleased Herbert was when he went to the stable
to ride Elf King to the blacksmith's, to find that the sharp little
pony had taken the business into his own hands."

"I tell you," said Roy, "that's a horse worth having. What do you
suppose that boy would take for him?"

"More money than you could raise in a hurry," said Sammy. "Miss Ruth, if
you had a horse now that jibbed, would you lick him?"

"That jibbed," she repeated doubtfully.

"Why, yes; stopped in the road, you know; wouldn't go."

"Oh, yes; now I understand. No, indeed, Sammy! If I had a horse
that--jibbed, I should be very patient with him and try to cure him of
the bad habit by kindness. I should know that beating would make him
worse."

"Well, that's what I think, and the other day pa and I were huskin' corn
in the barn, and there was a horse jibbed on our hill, and the driver
got down and licked him with the butt end of his whip, and kicked him
with his great cowhide boots, and I asked pa if I might take out a
measure of oats and see if I couldn't coax that horse to take his load
up the hill--you see pa owned a jibber once and I knew how he used to
manage him. And pa said I might, only I'd better look out or the fellow
would use me as he was usin' the horse. But I wasn't afraid, for he was
half-drunk, and I knew I could clip it faster'n he could.

"Well, sir, I went out there and I stood around a while, and says I,
'What'll you bet I can't get your horse to the top of the hill?' And he
said he wouldn't bet a red cent. 'Well,' says I,'will you let me try
just for fun?' and he said, 'Yes, I might try all day if I wanted to.'
And I got him to stand one side, where the horse couldn't see him, and I
went up to the horse's head and stroked his nose and gave him a handful
of oats, just a little taste, you know, and when he was kind of calmed
down I went a ways ahead holdin' out the measure of oats, and if that
horse didn't follow me up that hill just as quiet as an old sheep, and
the man he stood by and looked streaked, I tell you!"

Sammy told his story with considerable animation and some forcible
gestures.

"That was well done," said Miss Ruth, "and I hope the cruel fellow
profited by the lesson you gave him. I don't think I'm naturally
vindictive, but when I see a man beating a horse I find myself wishing
I was strong enough to snatch the whip from him and lay it well about
his own shoulders. But come, boys, the fire is down to coals--just right
for popping corn. Sammy, you know the way to the kitchen. Ask Lovina for
the corn-popper and a dish, and, Roy, you'll find a paper bag full of
corn in the cupboard yonder. Quick, now, and we'll have the dish piled
by the time Susie and Mollie are back from meeting."

"Haven't we had a gay old time," said Roy, on the way home, "and ain't
you glad I put you up to coming, Sam Ray?" And Sammy admitted that he
was.

       *       *       *       *       *

"Now, girls and boys," said Miss Ruth, on the next Wednesday afternoon,
"I am going to take you on a long journey,--in fancy, I mean,--over the
hills and plains and valleys, to the country of the Far West, with its
rolling prairies and big fields of wheat and corn. You shall be set down
in a green meadow, with a stream running through it, shallow and clear
at this time of year, but a little later, when the September rains have
filled it, rushing along full of deep, muddy water.

"Under a big oak in about the middle of the pasture you will find an old
horse feeding. He is fat and sleepy looking, and has a kind face, and a
white spot on his forehead. This is Old Star, Farmer Horton's
family-horse. You may pat his neck and stroke his nose and feed him a
cookie or a bit of gingerbread,--I am afraid the old fellow hasn't teeth
enough left to chew an apple,--and then you may sit near him on the
grass, and while I read aloud to you, fancy that he is talking, and, if
you have plenty of imagination, you will get


THE STORY OF OLD STAR, TOLD BY HIMSELF.

"I hope nobody thinks I am turned out in this pasture because I am too
old to work. Horses pass here every day drawing heavy loads, older by
half a dozen years than I am, poor broken-down hacks too, most of them,
while I--well, if it wasn't for a little stiffness in the joints and a
giving out of wind, now and then, I can't see but what I'm as well able
to travel as I ever was.

"The fact is, I never was put to hard work. There were always horses
enough besides me on the place to do the farm work and the teaming--Tom
and Jerry and the colt, you know; not Filly's colt: he died, poor
thing, before he was a year old, of that disease with a long name that
carried off so many horses all over the country: but a great shambling
big-boned beast old master swapped a yoke of steers for, over to Skipton
Mills. We called him Goliath, he was so tall: strong as an elephant,
too: a powerful hand at a horse-rake and mowing-machine. Well, well, how
time flies, to be sure! He's been dead and gone these five years, and
Tom and Jerry, they were used up long ago--there's a deal of hard work
to be done on a farm of this size, I can tell you; and as to Filly, she
came to a sad end, for she got mired down in the low pasture, and had to
be hauled out with ropes, poor critter, and died of the wet and the
cold.

"Well, as I was saying, I never was put to hard work. I was born and
raised on the place, and I do suppose--though I say it, who
shouldn't--that I was an uncommon fine--looking colt, dark chestnut in
color, and not a white hair on me except this spot in my forehead that
gave me my name. When I was three months old, master made a present of
me to his oldest boy on his sixteenth birthday, and every half-hour
Master Fred could spare from his work, he used to spend in dressing down
and feeding me and teaching me cunning tricks. I could take an apple or
a lump of sugar from his pocket, walk down the slope behind the barn on
two legs, with my forefeet on his shoulders, and shake hands, old master
used to say, 'just like a Christian.'

"Master Fred set great store by me, as well he might. He's traveled
hundreds of miles on my back over the prairies, and we've been out
together many a dark night when he'd drop the lines on my neck and say,
"Well, Star, go ahead if you know the way, for not one inch can I see
before my nose." That was after he learned by experience that I knew
better than he did where to go, and when to stop going. For he lost his
temper and called me hard names one night, when I stopped short in the
middle of the road and wouldn't budge an inch for voice or whip, with
the wind blowing a gale, and the rain coming down in bucketsful. But
when a flash of lightning showed the bridge before us clean washed away,
and only a few feet between us and the steep bank of the river, Master
Fred changed his tune. Afraid! not I; but I'm willing to own I _was_ a
little scared the day we got into the water down by Cook's Cove, for
you see I was hitched to the buggy and the lines got tangled about my
legs, and there were chunks of ice and lots of driftwood floating about,
and the current sucking me down; but master had got to shore and stood
on the bank calling, "This way, Star, this way!" and when I heard his
voice I--well, I don't know how I managed to do it, but I turned square
round and swam upstream with the buggy behind me, and got safe and sound
to land. I've heard Master Fred say my back was covered with
river-grass, and I trembled all over with the fright and the hard pull.

"But, dear me, all that happened long ago when master was courting old
Tim Bunce's daughter Martha, down Stony Creek Road. How that girl did
take to me! She used to say she knew the sound of my hoofs on the road,
of a still night, when we were a mile away; and she'd say over a little
rhyme she'd got hold of somehow:--

    'Star, Star, good and bright,
    I wish you may and I wish you might
    Bring somebody to me I want to see to-night.'

"If she said that twice, looking straight down the road, she told us we
were sure to come. She was a plump rosy-cheeked girl when Master Fred
brought her to be mistress here, though you mightn't think it to see her
now, what with the cooking and the dairy-work and raising a big family
of children. But if you want to know what mistress was like twenty years
ago, you've only to look at our Ada.

"Now, there's a girl for you, as good as she is pretty, and getting to
be a woman grown; though I remember, as though it happened yesterday,
her mother's coming out one spring day to where I was nibbling grass in
the door-yard, with her baby in her arms, and holding up the little
thing to me, and saying, 'This is Ada, Star,--you must be good friends
with Ada,' Friends! I should say so. Before that child was a year old,
she used to cry to be held on my back for a ride, and when she was
getting better of the scarlet fever, she kept saying, 'Me 'ant to tee
ole 'Tar,' till, to pacify her, they led me to the open window of the
room where she lay, and she reached her mite of a hand from the bed to
stroke my nose and give me the lump of sugar she had saved for me under
her pillow.

"Bless the child! And it was just so with all the rest, Tim and Martha
and Fred and Jenny and baby May--there was a new baby in that house
every year. Those young ones would crawl over me, and sit on me, when I
was lying down in the stable; ride me, three or four at a time, without
bridle or saddle, and cling to my neck and tail when there was no room
left on my back. They shared their apples and gingerbread with me, and
brought me goodies on a plate sometimes so that I might eat my dinner,
they said, 'like the rest of the folks,' I fetched them to and from
school, and trotted every day to the post-office and the Corners to do
the family errands; and when our Ada was old enough to be trusted to
drive, the whole lot of them would pile into the carryall, and away we
would go for a long ride, through the lanes and the shady woods that
border the pond, stopping a dozen times for the girls to clamber out and
pick the wild posies and for the boys to skip stones or wade in the
water. For _I_ was in no hurry to go on. There was plenty of tender
grass to be cropped by the roadside, and the young leaves of the maples
and white birch were sweet and juicy.

"'Take good care of them, Star,' mistress used to say, standing in the
door-way to see us off; 'you have a precious load, but we trust you,
kind, faithful old friend,'

"And so she might. I knew I must just creep down the hills with those
children behind me, and never stop for a drink at Rocky Brook, though I
were ever so thirsty, because of the sharp pitch down to the
watering-trough. And though from having been scared nearly to death,
when I was a colt, by a wheelbarrow in the road, I always _have_ to shy
a little when I see one, our Ada will tell you, if you ask her, that in
the circumstances, I behaved very well.

"_She_ behaved well. She always chose the well-traveled roads, and gave
me plenty of room to turn. Once, I remember, they all wanted to take a
short cut by way of an old corduroy road; and though, if master had been
driving, I should have made no objection, and, as like as not, with a
little jolting and pitching, we should have got safe over, I didn't feel
like taking the responsibility, with all those young ones along, of
going that way; so I tried to make our Ada understand the state of my
mind, and after a while she did; for she said: 'Well, Star, if you don't
want to draw us over those logs, I'm not going to make you,' Now, wasn't
that sensible?

"Well, if I was proud and happy to be trusted with master's family on
week-days, think how I must have felt of a Sunday morning in the summer
time, with mistress dressed in her silk gown, and our Ada in muslin and
pink ribbons, and the boys in their best clothes, and master riding
along-side on Tom or Jerry, all going to meeting together. I liked
hearing the bells ring, and I liked being hitched under the maple-trees,
with all the neighbors' horses to keep me company. We generally dozed
while the folks were indoors, and woke up brisk and lively, and started
for home in procession.

"But, dear! dear! there came a time when, with five horses on the farm,
not one could be had to give the children a ride or to do a stroke of
work, when master had to foot it to the Corners, and the two steers, Old
Poke and Eyebright, dragged mistress and the children to meeting in the
ox-cart.

"For we were all down with the epizo?tic, coughing and sneezing enough
to take our heads off, and so sick and low, some of us, that we couldn't
stand in our stalls, and a man with a red face, Master Fred had over
from Skipton Mills, pouring nasty stuff down our throats, and making us
swallow big black balls of medicine that hurt as they went down--as if
we hadn't enough to suffer before! But our Jenny came to the stable with
a piece of pork-rind, and a bandage she'd made out of her little
red-flannel petticoat, and she wanted Master Fred to put it on my neck;
for, says she: 'That's what ma put on me when I had the sore
throat,'--the blessed child!

"Well, we all pulled through except Filly's colt. He keeled over one
morning, poor fellow! and was dragged out and buried under the oaks in
the high pasture. But for some reason, I didn't pick up as quick as the
others. The cough held on, and I was pestered for breath, and I didn't
get back my strength; and what I ate didn't seem to fatten me up much,
for Master Fred says one day, laughing, 'Well, Old Star, we've saved
your skin and bones, and that's about all!' However, I got round again,
only my legs had a bad habit of giving way under me, without the least
bit of warning.

"Our Ada did all she could to keep me up, holding a tight rein, and
saying, 'Steady, Star! steady!' when she saw any signs of stumbling. But
trying to keep from it seemed to make me do it all the more, and down I
would come on my poor knees and spill those children out of the wagon,
like blackberries from a full basket.

"One day, after this had happened, master told our Ada she was not to
drive me any more, and before I had got over feeling bad about that,
there came some thing a great deal worse; for I was standing by the pump
in the backyard one day, and master and mistress were in the porch, and
I heard him tell her he had had an offer from Jones the milkman, to buy
me. 'Twould be an easy place, and he'd promised to treat me well, and
he'd about made up his mind to take up with it; for he couldn't afford
to keep a horse on the place that--well, I don't care to repeat the rest
of the speech. 'Twas rather hard on me, but I haven't laid it up against
master. Fact is, he had a deal to worry him about that time, for he was
disappointed in the wheat crop, and the heavy rains had damaged his
corn, and he was feeling mighty poor.

"But mistress was up in arms in a minute. 'What, sell Star!' says she,
'our good, faithful Star, who's been in the family ever since you were a
boy! and to Ki Jones to peddle milk round Skipton Mills and Hull
Station! O pa!' says mistress, says she, 'have we got down so low as
that? Why 't would break our Ada's heart, and mine too, to see Star
hitched to a milk-cart. Rather than have you do that, says she, 'I'll go
in rags, and keep the children on mush and molasses;' and she put her
apron to her eyes.

"'Well, well, don't fret!' says master,--and I thought he looked kind o'
ashamed,--'I haven't sold him yet I've a notion to turn him out to
grass a while, and see what that'll do for him,' So the next day he put
me in this pasture.

"You see that plank bridge yonder, over the creek? That's where our Ada
fell into the water. Master has put up a railing, and made all safe
since the accident happened. 'T was a risky place always, though the
children have crossed it hundreds of times, and none of them ever
tumbled over before.

"But I hadn't been here a week, when one sunshiny afternoon our Ada came
through the pasture, on her way to visit the sick Simmonses--there's
always some of that tribe down with the chills. She came running up to
me--her little basket, full of goodies, on her arm,--stopped to talk a
minute and feed me an apple, and then passed along, while I went on
nibbling grass, till I heard a scream and a splash, and knew, all in a
minute, she must have fallen off the plank bridge into the water. Dear!
dear! what was to be done? I ran to the fence, and looked up and down
the road. Some men were burning brush at the far end of the next field.
I galloped toward them, and back again to the creek, and whinnied and
snorted, and tried my best to make them understand that they were
needed; but they didn't appear to notice, and I just made up my mind,
that if any thing was done to save our Ada from drowning, I was the one
to do it.

"I made my way through the alder-bushes down by the bank, to a place
where the current sets close in shore. At first I couldn't see any
thing, then all at once, there floated on the muddy water close to me,
the little red shawl she wore, then a hand and arm, and her white face
and brown hair all streaming. I caught at her clothes, and though Ada is
a stout girl of her age, and the wet things added a deal to her weight,
I lifted her well out of the water. I remember thinking, 'If only my
poor legs don't give out, I shall do very well,' And they didn't give
out, for when help came--it seems those men in the field _had_ noticed
me, and came to see what was the matter--they found me all in a lather
of sweat, and my eyes starting out of their sockets, but with my feet
braced against a rock, keeping our Ada's head and shoulders well above
water.

"They got her home as quick as they could, and put her to bed between
hot blankets, and the next day she was none the worse for her ducking,
though she carried the print of my teeth in her tender flesh for many a
day; for how was I to know where the child's clothes left off and her
side began.

"Of course they made a great fuss over me. Mistress came running to meet
me, and put both arms around my neck, and said: 'O Star, you have saved
our darling's life!' and the little ones hugged and kissed me, and the
boys took turns rubbing me down; and I stood knee deep in my stall that
night in fresh straw, and besides my measure of oats, had a warm mash,
three cookies, and half a pumpkin-pie for my supper.

"But master only patted my neck, and said: 'Well done, Old Star!' Master
Fred and I always did understand one another.

"There hasn't been any thing more said about selling me to Ki Jones. In
the winter I have a stall at the south side of the stable, where I get
the sun at my window all day, and in summer I live in this pasture, with
shady trees, and cool water, and grass and clover-tops in plenty. I have
nothing to do the live-long day, but to eat and drink and enjoy myself;
but I do hope folks passing along the road don't think I'm turned out in
this field because I'm too old to work."

"Good-by, Old Star!" said Mollie, as her aunt laid down the paper. "We
are much obliged for your nice story, and we hope you'll live ever so
many years. I wouldn't hint for the world that you aren't as smart as
you used to be."

"Isn't he rather a self-conceited old horse?" said Nellie Dimock.

"Well, yes; but that is natural. I suppose he has been more or less
spoiled and petted all his life."

"When he told about going to meeting," Fannie Eldridge said, "it
reminded me of a story mamma tells, of an old horse up in Granby, that
went to church one Sunday all by himself."

"How droll! How did it happen, Fannie?"

"Why, he belonged to two old ladies who went to church always, and
exactly at such a time every Sunday morning Dobbin was hitched to the
chaise and brought round to the front door and Miss Betsey and Miss
Sally got in and drove to church. But one Sunday something hindered
them, and Dobbin waited and waited till the bell stopped ringing and
all the other horses which attended church had gone by; and at last he
got clear out of patience, and started along without them. Mamma says
the people laughed to see him trot up to the church-door and down to the
sheds and walk straight into his own place, and when service was over
back himself out and trot home again."

"What did Miss Betsey and Miss Sally do?"

"Oh, they had to stay at home. When they came out they saw the old
chaise ever so far off, going toward the church, and they felt pretty
sure old Dobbin was going to meeting on his own account. That is a true
story Miss Ruth, every word of it--mamma says so."

"Our old Ned cheated us all last summer," said Florence Austin, "by
pretending to be lame. He really was made lame, at first, one day when
mamma was driving, by getting a stone in his foot, and she turned
directly and walked him all the way back to the stable. But when William
had taken out the stone, he seemed to be all right, and the next
afternoon mamma and Alice and I started for a drive. We got about a mile
out of town, when all at once Ned began to limp. Mamma and Alice got out
of the phaeton, and looked his feet all over, for they thought may be he
had picked up another stone; but they couldn't see the least thing out
of the way, only that he limped dreadfully as if it half-killed him to
go. Well, there was nothing to be done but to give up our drive; for we
couldn't bear to ride after a lame horse!"

"I can't either!" Mollie interjected.

"Well, he had been lately shod, and our coachman thought that perhaps a
nail from one of the shoes pricked his foot, so he started to take him
to the blacksmith's. But don't you think, as soon as Ned knew that
William was driving, he started off at a brisk trot and wasn't the least
bit lame I but the next time mamma took him out, he began to limp
directly, and kept looking round as much as to say: 'How can you be so
cruel as to make me go, when you must see every step I take hurts me?'
But when mamma came home with him again, William said: 'It's chatin' you
he is, marm.'"

"And what did your mother do?"

"Well, as soon as she made up her mind that he was shamming, she took no
notice of his little trick, but touched him up with the whip, and made
him go right along. He knew directly that she had found him out. Oh, he
is _such_ a knowing horse! The other day Alice was leading him through
the big gate, to give him a mouthful of grass in the door-yard. Alice
likes to lead him about. When he stepped on her gown, and she held it up
to him all torn, and scolded him, she said: 'O Ned! aren't you ashamed
of yourself? how could you be so clumsy and awkward?' and she said he
dropped his head and looked so sorry and ashamed, as if he wanted to
say: 'Oh, I beg pardon! I didn't mean to do it,' that she really pitied
him, and answered as if he had spoken: 'Well, don't worry, Ned; it's of
no consequence,' Ned is such a pet. Papa got him in Canada, on purpose
for mamma and Alice to drive; and it was so funny when he first
came--he didn't understand a word of English, not even whoa. He belonged
to a Frenchman way up the country, and had never been in a large town,
and acted so queer--like a green countryman, you know, turning his head
and staring at all the sights. And it's lovely to see him play in the
snow. He was brought up in the midst of it, you know. When there's a
snow-storm he's wild to be out of the stable, and the deeper the drifts,
the better pleased he is. He plunges in and rolls over and over, and
rears and dances. Oh, it is too funny to see him! But I beg pardon, Miss
Ruth! I didn't mean to talk so long about Ned."

"We are all glad to hear about him," she said, and Susie added that it
was very interesting.

"My Uncle John owned a horse," said Roy Tyler, "that opened a gate and
a barn-door to get to the oat-bin, and he shut the barn-door after him
too. I guess you can't any of you tell how he did that!"

"He jumped the gate, and shoved his nose in the crack of the door and
pried it open," said Sammy.

"No, he didn't. That wouldn't be _opening_ the gate, would it?" Roy
retorted. "And how did he shut it after him?"

"I think you had better tell us, Roy," said Miss Ruth.

"Well, he reached over the fence, and lifted the latch with his teeth,
that's how he opened the gate; and he shut it by backing up against it
till it latched itself. Then he pulled out the wooden pin of the
barn-door, and it swung open by its own weight--see?"

"Well, pa had a horse that slipped his halter and shoved up the cover
of the oat-bin, when he got hungry in the night and wanted a lunch,"
said Sammy; "and I read about a horse the other day which turned the
water-tap when he wanted a drink, and pulled the stopper out of the pipe
over the oat-bin, just as he 'd seen the coachman do, so the oats would
come down, and"--

"But really now," Ruth Elliot, interrupted, "interesting and wonderful
as all this is, we must stop somewhere. I have another story to tell
you, about a minister's horse, but it can wait over till next week. Lay
aside your work, girls; it is past five o'clock."




CHAPTER IX.

TUFTY AND THE SPARROWS.


Florence Austin came early to the Society the next Wednesday afternoon,
and found Miss Ruth on the piazza,

"I am glad to see you, Florence," she said. "I was just wishing for a
helper. Mollie and Susie have gone on an errand, and I am alone in the
house, and here is a whole family in trouble that I can't relieve."

"What is the matter?" said the little girl.

"A baby bird has fallen out of the nest, and I am too lame to-day to
venture down the steps; and papa and mamma are in great distress, and
the babies in the nest half-starved, and can't have their dinner
because the old birds dare not leave poor chippy a moment lest some
stray cat should get him. See the little thing down there in the grass
just under the woodbine!"

Florence descended the piazza-steps at two jumps, and was back with the
young bird in her hand.

"Now where shall I put him, Miss Ruth?"

Ruth Elliot pointed out the nest. It was in the thickest growth of the
woodbine, just over their heads; and when Florence had climbed in a
chair, she had her first look at a nest of young birds. The little city
girl was delighted.

"How cunning!" she exclaimed. "Oh, how awfully cunning! four in
all--three of them with their mouths wide open. No wonder this little
fellow got pushed out. Here, you droll little specimen, crowd in
somewhere! He isn't hurt at all, for he seems as lively as any of them."

As Florence jumped down from the chair, Susie and Mollie and the Jones
girls came up the walk.

"What are you two doing?" Mollie called out.

"Florence has just restored a lost baby to his distressed family," her
aunt answered. "Come into the house, girls, and let papa and mamma
Chippy get over their fright and look after the babies. Florence, I am
greatly obliged to you. I should have felt very sorry if harm had come
to the little one, for I have watched that nest ever since the old birds
began to build."

The little girl replied politely that she was glad she had been of use.

"I know what chippies' nests are made of," said Mollie: "fine roots and
fibers, and lined beautifully with soft fine hair,"

"Did you watch the birds while they were making it, Mollie?"

"No; but one night after tea, when Auntie and Susie and I were playing
at choosing birds,--telling which bird we liked best and why, you
know,--papa came along and said: 'I choose the chirping sparrow for my
bird'; and when we laughed at him and called for his reasons (because
chippies are such insignificant things, you know, and no singers), he
told us he liked them because they were tame and friendly, and because
they built such neat, pretty nests; and he pulled an old nest he had
saved in pieces, and showed us how it was put together."

"Yes," said Susie; "and the other reason he gave for liking them best
was, that they got up early and rang the rising-bell for all the other
birds. That was such a funny reason for papa to give, for we all know he
dearly loves his morning nap."

"Really, now, do the chippies get up first in the morning?" said
Florence.

"With the first peep of day," Miss Ruth answered. "This morning I heard
their cheerful twitter before a ray of light had penetrated to my room;
and a welcome sound it was, for it told me the long night was over. One
dear little fellow sang two or three strains before he succeeded in
waking any body; then a robin joined in, in a sleepy kind of way; then
two or three wrens, and then a cat-bird; and, last of all, my little
weather-bird, which, from the topmost branches of the elm-tree, warbled
out to me that it was a pleasant day. Oh, what a sweet concert they all
gave me before the sun rose!"

"I never heard of a weather-bird, Aunt Ruth."

"Your Uncle Charlie gave him that name, Susie, when we were children.
His true name is Warbling Verio; but we used to fancy the little fellow
announced what kind of day it would be. If clear he called out:
'Pleasant day!' three times over, with a pause between each sentence and
a long-drawn-out Yes at the close; or, if it rained, he said 'Rainy day'
or 'Windy day,' describing the weather, whatever it might be, always
with an emphatic _Yes_.

"One day he talked to me, but it was not about the weather. Things had
gone wrong with me all the morning. I had spoken disrespectfully to my
grandmother, and had been so cross and impatient with baby Walter that
mother had taken him from me, though she could ill spare the time to
tend him. Then I ran through the garden to a little patch of woods
behind the house, and sat on an old log, in a very bad humor.

"Presently, high above my head in the branches of the walnut-tree, the
weather-bird began his monotonous strain. I paid no attention to him at
first, I was so taken up with my own disagreeable thoughts, till it came
to me all at once that he was not telling me it was a pleasant day,
though the sun was shining gloriously and a lovely breeze rustled the
green leaves. What was it the little bird was saying over and over
again, as plain as plain could be? 'NAUGHTY GIRL! NAUGHTY GIRL! NAUGHTY
GIRL! Y-E-S.'

"I rubbed my eyes and pinched my arm, to make sure I was awake; for I
thought I must have dreamed it. But no, there it was again, sweet, sad,
reproachful: 'NAUGHTY GIRL! NAUGHTY GIRL! NAUGHTY GIRL! Y-E-S,'

"I jumped up in a rage, and called it a horrid thing; and when it
wouldn't stop, but kept on reproaching me with my evil behavior, I could
bear it no longer, but put my fingers in my ears and ran back to the
house and up to my own room, where I cried with anger and shame. But
solitude and reflection soon brought me to a better state of mind; and,
long before the day was over, I had confessed my fault and was forgiven.
But though I wanted very much to see a new water-wheel Charlie set up
that afternoon in the brook, I dared not go through the wood to get to
it, lest that small bird should still be calling, 'Naughty girl! Y-e-s.'

"Charlie grumbled the next morning when I wakened him out of a sound
sleep by shouting gayly from my little bed in the next room that his
weather-bird was calling, 'Pleasant day!' 'Why, what _should_ he call,'
he wanted to know, 'with the sun shining in at both windows?'

"I never told my brother how the bird had given voice to my accusing
conscience, nor has the lesson ever been repeated; for from that day to
this the Warbling Verio has made no more personal remarks to me."

"There's a bird down in Maine" said Ann Eliza Jones, "they call the
Yankee bird, 'cause he keeps saying, 'All day
whittling--whittling--whittling.'"

"Yes; and the quails there always tell the farmers when they must hurry
and get in their hay," said her sister. "When it's going to rain they
sing out: 'More wet! more wet!' and 'No more wet!' when it clears off."

"Aunt Ruth," said Mollie, "please tell us about the funny little bantam
rooster who used to call to his wife every morning: 'Do--come
out--n-o-w!'"

"Very well; but we are getting so much interested in this bird-talk that
we are making rather slow progress with our work. Suppose we all see how
much we can accomplish in the next ten minutes."

Upon this Mollie caught up the block lying in her lap, Florence
re-threaded her needle, Nellie Dimock hunted up her thimble, which had
rolled under the table, and industry was the order of the day.

And while they worked, Miss Ruth told the story of


THE WIDOW BANTAM.

"She belonged to our next-door neighbor, and we called her the Widow
because her mate--a fine plucky little bantam rooster--was one day slain
while doing battle with the great red chanticleer who ruled the
hen-yard.

"I took pity on the little hen in her loneliness, and singled her out
from the flock for special attention. She very soon knew my voice, would
come at my call, and used to slip through a gap in the fence and pay me
a visit every day. If the kitchen door were open she walked in without
ceremony; if closed, she flew to the window, tapped on the glass with
her bill, flapped her wings, and gave us clearly to understand that she
wished to be admitted. Once inside, she set up a shrill cackling till I
attended to her wants, and scolded me at the top of her voice if I kept
her long waiting. When she had eaten more cracked corn and Indian meal
than you would think so small a body could contain, she walked about in
a slow, contented way, and was ready for all the petting we chose to
give her.

"She was a pretty creature, with a speckled coat and a comb the color of
red coral: very small, but lively and vigorous, and exhibiting in all
her movements both grace and stateliness. She would nestle in my lap,
take a ride on my shoulder, and walk the length of my arm to peck at a
bit of cake in my hand, regarding me all the while with a queer
sidelong glance, and croaking out her satisfaction and content. When she
was ready to go she walked to the kitchen door, and asked in a very
shrill voice to be let out. She continued these visits till late in the
fall, when she was shut up with the rest of our neighbor's flock for the
winter.

"One bitter cold day in January we heard a faint cackle outside, and,
opening the kitchen door, found our poor widow in a sorry plight. One
foot was frozen, her feathers were all rough and dirty, her wings
drooping, her bright comb changed to a dull red. How she escaped from
the hen-house, surmounted the high fence, and hobbled or flew to our
door, we did not know; but there she was, half-dead with hunger and
cold.

"We did what we could for her. I bathed and bandaged the swollen foot,
and made a warm bed for her in a box in the shed, from which she did not
offer to stir for many days. I fed her with bits of bread soaked in warm
milk, and Charlie said, nursed and tended her as if she had been a sick
baby. She was very gentle and patient, poor thing! and allowed me to
handle her as I pleased, always welcomed my coming with a cheerful
little cackle, and, as she got stronger, trotted after me about the shed
and kitchen like a pet kitten.

"In the spring, when she was quite well again, I restored her to her
rightful owner. Perhaps she had grown weary of her solitary life, for
she seemed delighted to rejoin her old companions; but every day she
made us a visit, and at night came regularly to roost in the shed.

"One morning we heard two voices instead of one outside our window, and
behold! Mrs. Bantam had taken another mate--a fine handsome fellow, so
graceful in form and brilliant in plumage that we at once pronounced him
a fit companion to our favorite hen. They were evidently on the best of
terms, croaking and cackling to each other, and exchanging sage opinions
about us as we watched them from the open door. I am sure she must have
told him all about her long illness the previous winter, and pointed me
out as her nurse, for he nodded and croaked and cast sidelong looks of
friendly regard in my direction.

"But when Mrs. Bantam came into the kitchen for her luncheon she could
not induce Captain Bantam to follow. In vain she coaxed and cackled,
running in and out a dozen times to convince him there was nothing to
fear. He would not believe her nor budge one inch over the door-sill.
She lost patience at last, and rated him soundly; but as neither coaxing
nor scolding availed, and she was eating her meal with a poor relish
inside, while he waited unhappily without, we settled the difficulty by
putting the dish on the door-step, where they ate together in perfect
content.

"But a more serious trouble came at bed-time, for Mrs. Bantam expected
to roost as usual in the shed, while the Captain preferred the old
apple-tree where the rest of the flock spent their nights. The funny
little couple held an animated discussion about it which lasted far into
the twilight--and neither would yield. The Captain was very polite and
conciliatory. He evidently had no mind to quarrel: but neither would he
give up the point. He occasionally suspended the argument by a stroll
into the garden, where, by vigorous scratching, he would produce a
choice morsel, to which he called her attention by an insinuating 'Have
a worm, dear?' She never failed to accept the offering, gulping it down
with great satisfaction, but was too old a bird to be caught by so
shallow a trick, for she would immediately return to her place by the
shed window, and resume her discourse. When she had talked herself
sleepy she ended the contest for that night by flying through the window
and settling herself comfortably in the old place, while the Captain
took his solitary way across the garden and over the fence to the
apple-tree.

Every night for a week this scene occurred under the shed window; then,
by mutual consent, they seemed to agree to go their several ways without
further dispute. About sunset the Captain might be seen politely
escorting his mate to her chosen lodging-house, and, after seeing her
safely disposed of for the night, quietly betaking himself to his roost
in the apple-tree.

"He was at her window early every morning crowing lustily. Charlie and I
were sure he said: 'Do--come--out--now! Do--come--out--n-o-w!' and were
vexed with the little hen for keeping him waiting so long. But his
patience never failed; and, when at last she flew down and joined him, a
prouder, happier bantam rooster never strutted about the place. All day
long he kept close at her side, providing her with the choicest tidbits
the garden afforded, and watching her with unselfish delight while she
swallowed each dainty morsel. In the middle of the day they rested under
the currant-bushes, crooning sleepily to each other or taking a quiet
nap.

"One day we missed them both, and for three weeks saw them only at
intervals, Mrs. Bantam always coming alone, eating a hurried meal, and
stealing away as quickly as possible; while the Captain wandered about
rather dejectedly, we thought, in the society of the other hens.

"But one bright morning we heard Mrs. Bantam clucking and calling with
all her old vigor; and there she was at the kitchen-door, the prettiest
and proudest of little mothers, with three tiny chicks not much larger
than the baby chippies you saw in the nest, Florence, but wonderfully
active and vigorous for their size. We named them Bob and Dick and
Jenny, and, as they grew older, were never tired of watching their
comical doings. Their mother, too, afforded us great amusement, while we
found much in her conduct to admire and praise. She was a fussy,
consequential little body, but unselfishly devoted, and ready to brave
any danger that threatened her brood. Charlie and and I learned more
than one useful lesson from the bantam hen and her young family.

"One of these lessons we put into verse, which, if I can remember, I
will repeat to you. We called it


CHICKEN DICK THE BRAGGER.

    'Scratch! scratch!
    In the garden-patch,
    Goes good Mother Henny;
    Cluck! cluck!
    Good luck! Good luck!
    Come, Bob and Dick and Jenny!

    A worm! a worm!
    See him squirm!
    Who comes first to catch it!
    Quick! quick!
    Chicken Dick,
    You are the chick to snatch it!

    "Peep! peep!
    While you creep,
    My long legs have won it!
    Cuck-a-doo!
    I've beat you!
    Don't you wish you'd done it?"

    Dick! Dick!
    That foolish trick
    Of bragging lost your dinner;
    For while to crow
    You let it go,
    Bob snatched it up--the sinner!

    Bob! Bob!
    'T was wrong to rob
    Your silly little brother,
    And in the bush
    To fight and push,
    And peck at one another.

    But Bobby beat,
    And ate the treat.--
    Dear children, though you're winners,
    Be modest all;
    For pride must fall,
    And braggers lose their dinners.'

"And now I will tell you an adventure of young Dick's, in which a habit
he had of crowing on all occasions proved very useful to him. He grew to
be a fine handsome fellow, and was sold to a family who lived on the
meadow-bank.

"There was a big freshet the next autumn, the water covering the meadows
on both sides of the river, and creeping into cellars and yards and
houses. It came unexpectedly, early one morning, into the enclosure
where Dick, with his half-dozen hens, was confined, and all flew for
refuge to the roof of the neighboring pig-pen. But the incoming flood
soon washed away the supports of the frail building, and it floated
slowly out into the current to join company with the wrecks of
wood-piles and rail fences, the spoils from gardens and orchards, in the
shape of big yellow pumpkins and rosy apples, bobbing about in the
foaming muddy stream, and all the other queer odds and ends a freshet
gathers in its course.

"From his commanding position, Dick surveyed the scene, and thought it a
fitting occasion to raise his voice. He stretched himself to the full
height of his few inches, flapped his wings, and crowed--not once or
twice, but continually. Over the waste of waters came his shrill
'Cock-a-doodle-doo!' All the cocks along the shore answered his call;
all the turkeys gobbled, and the geese cackled. His vessel struck the
heavy timber of a broken bridge, and lurched and dipped, threatening
every moment to go to pieces. The waves splashed and drenched them, and
the swift current carried them faster and faster down to the sea. It was
all Dick and his little company could do to keep their footing, and
still the plucky little fellow stood and crowed.

"A neighbor who was out in his boat gathering drift-wood, recognizing
Dick's peculiar voice, went to the rescue, and, taking this strange
craft in tow, brought the little company, with their gallant leader,
drenched and draggled but still crowing lustily, safe to land.

"And that is all I can tell you about Dick, for it is five o'clock, and
time to put up our work."

"I like every kind of bird," said Florence Austin at the next meeting of
the Society, "except the English sparrows. They are a perfect nuisance!"

"Why, what harm do they do?" Nellie asked.

"Harm!" said Florence; "you don't know any thing about it here in the
country. We had to cut down a beautiful wisteria-vine that climbed over
one side of our house because the sparrows would build their nests in
it, and made such a dreadful noise in the morning that nobody on that
side of the house could sleep. And they drive away all the other birds.
We used to have robins hopping over our lawn, and dear little
yellow-birds used to build their nests in the pear-trees; but since the
sparrows have got so thick, they have stopped coming. My father says the
English sparrow is the most impudent bird that ever was hatched. He
actually saw one snatch away a worm a robin had just dug up. I believe I
hate sparrows!"

"I don't," said Nellie. "I have fed them all winter. They came to the
dining-room window every morning, and waited for their breakfast; and a
funny little woodpecker, blind of one eye, came with them sometimes."

"They do lots of good in our gardens," said Mollie, "digging up grubs
and beetles. Papa told us so."

"There's nobody in this world so bad," said Susie, sagely, "but that you
can find something good to say about them." At which kindly speech Aunt
Ruth smiled approval.

"I think," she said, "this will be a good time to tell you a story
about an English sparrow and a canary-bird I will call it


TUFTY AND THE SPARROW.

"One morning in April a young canary-bird whose name was Tufty escaped
through an open window carelessly left open while he was out of his
cage, and suddenly found himself, for the first time in his life, in the
open air. He alighted first on an apple-tree in the yard, and then made
a grand flight half-way to the top of the elm-tree.

"The sun was bright and the air so still that the light snow which had
fallen in the night yet clung to the branches and twigs of the tree, and
Tufty examined it with interest, thinking it pretty but rather cold as
he poked it about with his bill, and tucked first one little foot, and
then the other, under him to keep it warm. Presently he heard an odd
little noise below him, and, looking down, saw on the trunk of the tree
a bird about his own size, with wings and back of a steel-gray color, a
white breast with a dash of dull red on it, and a long bill, with which
he was making the noise Tufty had heard by tapping on the tree.

"'Good-morning!' said Tufty, who was of a friendly and social
disposition, and was beginning to feel the need of company.

"'Morning!' said the woodpecker, very crisp and shorthand not so much as
looking up to see who had spoken to him.

"If you had heard this talk you would have said Tufty called out: 'Peep!
peep!' and the woodpecker--but that's because you don't understand
bird-language.

"'What are you doing down there?' said Tufty, continuing the
conversation.

"'Getting my breakfast,' said the woodpecker.

"'Why, I had mine a long time ago!' said Tufty.

"He didn't in the least understand how that knocking on the tree was to
bring Mr. Longbill's morning meal; but he was afraid to ask any more
questions, the other had been so short with him.

"Just then he heard a hoarse voice overhead saying, 'Come along! come
along!' and, looking up, saw a monstrous black creature sailing above
the tops of the trees. It was only a crow on his way to the swamp, and
he was trying to hurry up his mate, that always would lag behind in that
corn-field where there wasn't so much as a grain left; but Tufty, which
by this time you must have discovered was a very ignorant bird, thought
the black monster was calling _him_, and piped back feebly: 'I can't! I
can't!' and was all of a tremble till Mr. Crow was quite out of sight.

"He sat quiet, looking a little pensive, for the fact was, he was
beginning to feel lonely, when there flew past him a flock of brown
birds chirping and chattering away at a brisk rate. 'Now for it!'
thought Tufty, 'here's plenty of good company;' and he spread his wings
and flew after them as fast as he could. But he could not keep up with
them, but, panting and weary, alighted on the roof of a house to rest.
And here he saw such a pretty sight; for on a sunny roof just below him
were two snow-white pigeons. One was walking about in a very
consequential way, his tail-feathers spread in the shape of a fan, and
turning his graceful neck from side to side in quite a bewitching
fashion. Just as Tufty alighted, the pretty dove began to call: 'Come,
dear, come! Do, dear, do!' in such a sweet, soft, plaintive voice, as if
his heart would certainly break if his dear _didn't_ come, that Tufty,
who in his silly little pate never once doubted that it was he the
lovely white bird was pining for, felt sorry to disappoint him, and
piped back: 'Oh, if you please, I should like to ever so much! but you
see I must catch up with those brown birds over there;' and, finding his
wind had come back to him, he flew away. The pigeon, which had not even
seen him, and had much more important business to attend to than to
coax an insignificant little yellow-bird, went on displaying all his
beauties, and crooning softly, 'Do, dear! do! do! do!'

"Tufty had no trouble in finding the brown birds, for long before he
came to the roof of the barn where they had alighted he heard their loud
voices in angry dispute; and they made such an uproar, and seemed so
fractious and ill-tempered, that Tufty felt afraid to join them, but
lingered on a tree near by.

"Presently one of them flew over to him. She was a young thing--quite
fresh and trim-looking for a sparrow.

"'Good-morning!' she said, hopping close to him and looking him all over
with her bright little eyes,

"'Good-morning!' said Tufty, as brisk as you please.

"'Now, I wonder where you come from and what you call yourself,' said
the sparrow. 'I never saw a yellow-bird like you before. How pretty the
feathers grow on your head!' and she gave a friendly nip to Tufty's
top-knot.

"Tufty thought she was getting rather familiar on so short an
acquaintance, but he answered her politely, told her his name, and that
he came from the house where he had always lived, and was out to take an
airing.

"'I want to know!' said the sparrow. 'Well, my name is Brownie. Captain
Bobtail's Brownie, they call me, because Brownie is such a common name
in our family. It's pleasant out-of-doors, isn't it? Oh, never mind the
fuss over there!'--for Tufty's attention was constantly diverted to the
scene of the quarrel--'they are always at it, scolding and fighting.
Come, let's you and I have a good time!'

"'What is the fuss about?' said Tufty.

"'A nest,' said Brownie, contemptuously. 'Ridiculous, isn't it? Snow on
the ground, and not time to build this two weeks; but you see, _he_
wants to keep the little house on top of the pole lest some other bird
should claim it, and _she_ wants to build in the crotch of the
evergreen, and the neighbors are all there taking sides. She has the
right of it--the tree is much the prettier place; but dear me! she might
just as well give up first as last, for he's sure to have his
way--husbands are such tyrants!' said Captain Bobtail's Brownie, with a
coquettish turn of her head; 'but come, now, what shall we do?'

"'I'm too cold to do any thing,' said Tufty, dolefully.

"The sun was hidden by a cloud and a cold wind was blowing, and the
house-bird, accustomed to a stove-heated room, was shivering.

"'Take a good fly,' said Brownie; 'that will warm you,'

"'But I'm hungry,' piped Tufty.

"'All right!' said Brownie. 'I know a place where there's a free lunch
set out every day for all the birds that will come--bread-crumbs, seeds,
and lovely cracked corn. Come along! you'll feel better after dinner,'

"So they flew, and they flew, and Brownie was as kind as possible, and
stopped for a rest whenever Tufty was tired, and chatted so agreeably
and pleasantly, that before they reached their journey's end Tufty had
quite fallen in love with her. Then, too, the sun was shining again,
and the brisk exercise of flying had set the little bird's blood in
motion, so that he was warm again, but oh, so hungry!

"They came at last to a brown cottage with a broad piazza, and it was on
the roof of this piazza that a feast for the birds was every day spread.
But as they flew round the house Tufty became very much excited.

"'Stop, Brownie!' he cried; 'let me look at this place! Surely I've been
here before. That red curtain, that flower-stand in the window,
that--Oh! oh! there's my own little house! Why, Captain Bobtail's
Brownie, you've brought me home!'

"Now, all this time Tufty's mistress had been in great trouble. As soon
as she discovered her loss she ran out-of-doors, holding up the empty
cage and calling loudly on her little bird to return. But he was high up
in the elm-tree watching the woodpecker, and, if he heard her call, paid
no attention to it. Very soon he flew after the sparrows, and she lost
sight of him. Not a mouthful of breakfast could the poor child eat.

"'I shall never see my poor little Tufty again, mamma!' she said. 'I saw
him flying straight for the swamp, and he never can find his way back!'
and she cried as if her heart would break.

"In the middle of the forenoon her brother Jack called to her from the
foot of the stairs:--

"'What will you give me, Kittie,' he said, 'if I will tell you where
Tufty is?'

"'O Jack! do you know? Have you seen him? Where? where?' cried the
little girl, coming downstairs in a great hurry.

"'Be quiet!' said Jack. 'Now, don't get excited; your bird is all right,
though I'm sorry to say he's in rather low company,' And he led her to
the dining-room window that looked into the garden, and there, sure
enough, was Tufty on a lilac-bush. Brownie was there too. She was
hopping about and talking in a most earnest and excited manner. It was
easy to see that she was using all her powers of persuasion to coax
Tufty not to go back to his old home, but to help her build a little
house out-of-doors, where they could set up housekeeping together.

"Kittie knew just what to do. She ran for the cage and for a sprig of
dried pepper-grass (of all the good things she gave her bird to eat, he
liked pepper-grass best), and, standing in the open door-way, called:
'Tufty! Tufty!' He gave a start, a little flutter of his wings, and
then, with one glad cry of recognition, and without so much as a parting
look at poor Brownie, flew straight for the door, and alighted on the
top of his cage.

"'How strangely things come about, mamma?' Kittie said that evening as
they talked over this little incident. 'Jack has laughed at me all
winter for feeding the sparrows, and called them hateful, quarrelsome
things, and said I should get nicely paid next summer when they drove
away all the pretty song-birds that come about the house. And now, don't
you see, mamma, one of the sparrows I have fed all winter--I knew her
right away by a funny little dent in her breast--has done me such good
service? Why, I am paid a hundred thousand times over for all I have
ever done for the sparrows.'"

"And what became of poor Brownie?" Nellie asked. "I almost hoped Tufty
would stay out with her, she was such a good little sparrow."

"She lingered about the garden for a while, making a plaintive little
noise; but when the family of Brownies came to dinner she ate her
allowance, and flew away with them, apparently in good spirits. But
Tufty moped for a day or two, and, as long as he lived, showed great
excitement at the sight of a flock of sparrows; and it is my private
opinion that, if a second opportunity had been given him, Kittie Grant's
Tufty would have gone off for good and all with Captain Bobtail's
Brownie."

Susie Elliot walked part of the way home with Florence Austin, and the
two little girls, who were fast becoming intimate friends, talked over
the events of the afternoon.

"How much your auntie knows about animals and birds!" said Florence;
"she seems almost as fond of them as if they were people."

"Yes," Susie answered; "she was always fond of pets, papa says; and,
ever since she has been ill, she has spent a great deal of time watching
them and studying their ways. I think it makes her forget the pain,"

"Is it the pain that keeps her awake at night, Susie? You know she said
this afternoon she was glad to hear the chippy-birds, because then she
knew the long night was over; and she looked so white, and couldn't get
down those three little easy steps to pick up the baby-bird. But she
walks about the garden sometimes with a crutch, doesn't she?"

"Oh, yes! and she's better than when she first came here to live, only
she never can be well, you know. Today is one of her poor days; but she
used to be so ill that she was hardly ever free from pain. You never
would have known it, though, she was always so cheerful and doing
something to give us good times."

"Can't she ever be made well, Susie? There's doctors in town, you know,
who cure _every thing_," said the little girl.

Susie shook her head.

"Papa says she has an incurable disease;" and then seriously--"I think
if Jesus were here he would put his hands on auntie and make her well."




CHAPTER X.

PARSON LORRIMER'S WHITE HORSE.


"And now for the story of the minister's horse," Mollie Elliot said,
when Miss Ruth's company of workers had assembled on the next Wednesday
afternoon. "I suppose he was an awfully good horse, which set an example
to all the other horses in the parish to follow. Say, Auntie, wasn't
he?"

"When my grandmother was a little girl," Ruth Elliot began, "she lived
with her father and mother in a small country town among the New
Hampshire hills: and of all the stories she told in her old age about
the quiet simple life of the people of Hilltown, the one her
grandchildren liked best to hear was


THE STORY OF PARSON LORRIMER'S WHITE HORSE.

"Parson Lorrimer had lived thirty years in Hilltown before he owned a
horse. He began to preach in the big white meeting-house when he was a
young man, and, as neither he nor his people wanted a change, when he
was sixty years old he was preaching there still. It was a scattered
parish, with farm-houses perched on the hill-sides and nestled in the
valleys; and the minister, in doing his work, had trudged over every
mile of it a great many times. He made nothing of walking five miles to
a meeting on a December evening, with the thermometer below zero, or of
climbing the hills in a driving snow-storm to visit a sick parishioner.
He was a tall, spare man, healthy and vigorous, with iron-gray hair, a
strong kind face, and a smile in his brown eyes that made every baby in
Hilltown stretch out its arms to him to be taken.

"Not a chick or child had Parson Lorrimer of his own. He had never
married, but lived in the old parsonage, a stately mansion, with rooms
enough in it to accommodate a big family, with only an elderly widow and
her grown-up son to minister to his wants and to keep him company. His
study was at the back of the house, and looked out upon the garden and
orchard, so that the smell of his pinks and roses came to him as he
wrote, and the same robins, year by year, built their nests within reach
of his hand in the branches of the crooked old apple-tree that shaded
his window.

"The minister was fond of caring for living creatures, both small and
great, and every domestic animal about the place knew it. The cat
jumped fearlessly to his knee, sure of a welcome. The cow lowed after
him if he showed himself at the window. The little chicks fluttered to
his shoulder when he appeared in the door-yard, and the old sow with her
litter of pigs kept close at his heels as he paced the orchard,
pondering next Sunday's sermon.

"He remembered them all. There was always a handful of grain for the
chickens in the pocket of his study-gown, a ripe pumpkin in the shed for
Sukey; and the good man would laugh like a school-boy, as the funny
little baby-pigs rolled and tumbled over each other for the apples he
tossed them. A great, good, gentle man, learned and wise in theology and
knowledge of the Scriptures, with tastes and habits as simple as a
child.

"But I must hurry on with my story, or you will think I am telling you
more about the parson than his horse. The good man realized, one day,
that he was not as young as he used to be, and that climbing Harrison
Hill on a July afternoon and walking five miles in a drizzling rain
after a preaching service were not so easy to do as he had found them a
dozen years before. So he wisely concluded to call in the aid of four
strong legs in carrying on his work, and that is how he came to buy a
horse.

"The people of Hilltown heartily approved of this plan, and several were
anxious to help him.

"Deacon Cowles had a four-year-old colt, raised on the farm, 'a real
clever steady-goin' creetur, that he guessed he could spare--might be
turned in for pew-rent;' and Si Olcott didn't care if he traded off his
gray mare on the same conditions. She was about used up for farm-work,
but had considerable go in her yet--could jog round with the parson for
ten years to come.

"The minister received these offers with politeness, and promised to
think of them; and then one day after a brief absence from home, set
every body in the parish talking, by driving into town seated in an open
wagon, shining with fresh paint and varnish, and drawn by a horse the
like of which had never been seen in Hilltown before.

"He was of a large and powerful build, and most comely and graceful in
proportion, with a small head, slender legs, and flowing mane and tail.
In color, he was milk-white, while his nose and the inside of his
pointed ears were of a delicate pink. He held his head high, stepping
proudly and glancing from side to side in a nervous, excited way; but he
had a kind eye, and the watching neighbors saw him take an apple from
the hand of his new master, after they turned in at the parsonage gate.
In answer to all questions, the parson said he had purchased the horse
at Winterport, of a seafaring man, that he was eight years old, and his
name was Peter. But to neither man nor woman in Hilltown did he ever
tell the sum he paid in yellow gold and good bank-notes for the white
horse,

"A few days after the purchase, Parson Lorrimer attended a funeral, and
when the service at the house was ended, and he had shaken hands all
round with the mourners, and exchanged greetings with neighbors and
friends, he stepped out to the side-yard, where he had fastened his
horse, and drove round the house to take his place before the hearse;
for in Hilltown it was the custom for the minister to lead the
procession to the burying-ground.

"It was Peter's first appearance in an official capacity, and he stepped
with sufficient dignity into the street, where a long line of wagons and
chaises, led off by the mourners' coach and the big black hearse, waited
the signal to start, while in the door-yard and along the sidewalk were
ranged the foot-passengers; for at a funeral in Hilltown everybody went
to the grave.

"A passing breeze caught a piece of paper lying in the road, and
flirted it close to Peter's eyes. He gave a tremendous leap sideways,
and it was a marvel no one was struck by his flying heels, then
gathering himself together he ran. How he did run! The good folks
scattered right and left with amazing quickness, considering their
habits of life; for in the slow little town, every body took things fair
and easy, and the white horse dashed past the string of wagons, the
mourners' equipage, and the tall black hearse. There was a cloud of
dust, a rattling of wheels, a clatter of hoofs, and Peter and the parson
were far down the road. The people gazed after their departing spiritual
guide in speechless astonishment. The mourners' heads were thrust far
out of the coach windows. Even the sleepy farm-horses pricked up their
ears: while old Bill, the sexton's clumsy big-footed beast, which for
fifteen years had carried the dead folks of Hilltown to their graves,
and had never before been known, on these solemn occasions to depart
from his slow walk, made a most astonishing departure; for, taking his
driver unawares, he suddenly started after the flying white steed,
breaking into a lumbering gallop, that set plumes nodding, curtains
flapping, and glasses rattling, and made the huge unwieldly vehicle
lurch and bob about in a way to threaten a shocking catastrophe.

"A vigorous twitch of the lines, and a loud 'Whoa, now, Bill! Whoa, I
tell ye!' soon brought the sexton's beast to a stand-still. I am sure he
must have shared his master's surprise at such unseeming conduct, who
wondered 'What in time had got into the blamed crittur!' But neither
voice nor rein checked Peter's speed. On he flew, down the hill past the
post-office, the meeting-house, and the tavern. It was a straight road,
and his driver kept him to it. Fortunately there were no collisions, and
at the last long ascent his pace slackened and he turned of his own
accord in at the parsonage gate.

"At the village store and the tavern that evening, Peter's evil behavior
was talked about.

"'He's a sp'iled horse,' Jonathan Goslee, the minister's hired man,
said, 'though you can't make parson think so. He's dead sure to run
ag'in. A horse knows when he's got the upper hand, jest as well as a
child, and he'll watch his chance to try it over ag'in, you see if he
don't.'

"But the next time Peter shied and tried to run, it was the minister
who got the upper hand; and when the short excitement was over, and the
horse quiet and subdued, he was driven back to within a few paces of the
object of his fright. A neighbor was called to stand at his head, while
his master took down the flaming yellow placard that had caused all the
trouble, and slowly and cautiously brought it to him, that he might see,
smell, and touch it, talking soothingly to him and petting and caressing
him. When he had become accustomed to its appearance, and had learned by
experience that it was harmless, it was nailed to the tree again and
Peter passed it the second time without trouble.

"'If I'd owned the horse,' the minister's helper said, when he told this
story, 'I s'pose I should have _licked_ him by,--but I guess, in the
long run, parson's way was best.'

"This was one of many lessons Peter received to correct his only serious
fault. He was willing and swift, intelligent and kind, but so nervous
and timid, and made so frantic by his fear of any unknown object, that
he was constantly putting the minister's life and limbs in jeopardy. But
he had a wise, patient teacher, and he was apt to learn.

"My grandmother was fond of telling some of the means adopted to bring
about the cure;--how one day after Peter had shied at sight of a
wheelbarrow, the parson trundled the obnoxious object about the yard for
half an hour in view of the stable window, then emptied a measure of
oats in it, and opened the stable door; how the horse trotted round and
round, drawing each time a little nearer, then came close, snorted and
wheeled,--his master standing by encouraging him by hand and
voice,--until, unable longer to resist the tempting bait, he put his
pink nose to the pile and ate first timidly, then with confidence. After
that, the old lady said, Peter felt a particular regard for wheelbarrows
in general, hoping in each one he happened to pass to find another
toothsome meal.

"He suffered at first agonies of terror at sight of the long line of
waving, flapping garments he had to pass every Monday in his passage
from the big gate to the stable; but, through the minister's devices,
grew so familiar with their appearance, that he took an early
opportunity of making their closer acquaintance, and mouthed the
parson's ruffled shirt, and took a bite of the Widow Goslee's dimity
short-gown.

"And so the kindly work went on. Peter gained trust and confidence every
day, learning little by little that his master was his friend, that
under his guidance no harm came to him, no impossible task was given to
him; until at length confidence cast out fear, and the white horse
became as docile and obedient as he had always been willing and strong.

"These qualities, on one occasion, stood him in good stead; for the
parsonage barn and stable one night burned to the ground. Peter's stall
was bright with the red light of the fire, and the flames crackled
overhead in the barn-loft when the parson led out his favorite,
trembling in every limb, his eyes wild with terror, but perfectly
obedient to his master's hand. It was as if he had said: 'I must go,
even through this dreadful fire, if master leads the way.'

"There was a Fourth of July celebration in the next parish, and Parson
Lorrimer was invited to deliver the oration. He rode over on horseback,
took the saddle from Peter's back, and turned him loose in a pasture
where other of the guests' horses were grazing. A platform was erected
on the green, with seats for the band, the invited guests, and the
speaker of the day; while the people gathered from both parishes were
standing about in groups waiting for the exercises to commence. Flags
were flying, bells ringing, and a field-piece, that had seen service in
the War of the Revolution, at intervals belched out a salute in honor of
the day. The band was playing a lively tune, when suddenly there was a
stir and a dividing to the right and left of the crowd gathered about
the stand, and through the lane thus formed came the minister's white
horse.

"He trotted leisurely up, stopped before the platform, and made a bow,
then began to dance, keeping time to the music, and going round and
round in a space quickly cleared for him by the lookers-on. I don't know
whether it was a waltz the band was playing, or if horses were taught to
waltz so long ago; but whatever kind of dance it was,--gallopade,
quickstep, or cotillion,--Peter, in his horse-fashion, danced it well.
Faster and faster played the music, and round and round went the pony.
The people laughed and shouted, and Peter made his farewell bow and
trotted soberly out of the ring, in the midst of a great shout of
applause.

"How did Parson Lorrimer feel? Of all that amused and wondering crowd,
not one was more taken by surprise than he--both at this exhibition of
Peter's accomplishments and at the tale it told of his early days; for
it was impossible to doubt that at some time in his life he had been a
trained horse in a circus. From the field near by he had recognized the
familiar strains that used to call him to his task, and had leaped the
fence and made his way to where the crowd was gathered, to play his
pretty part on the village green, before the sober citizens of
Centerville and Hilltown, as he had played it hundreds of times before,
under the canvas, to the motley crowd drawn together by the attractions
of the ring.

"Of course the minister felt sorry and ashamed when he learned, in this
public way, of the low company Peter had kept in his youth. Whenever a
traveling circus had stopped at Winterport, Parson Lorrimer had not
failed to warn his young people from the pulpit to keep their feet from
straying to this place of sinful amusement. But mingled with his
chagrin, I think he must have felt a little pride in the ownership of
the beautiful creature, so intelligent to remember, and so supple of
limb to perform, the unaccustomed task.

"He took pains to narrate more fully than he had thought necessary
before, how he had come in possession of the animal. He had gone, he
said, on business to Winterport, and on the wharf, early one morning,
had met a man in the dress of a sailor leading the white horse. In
answer to inquiries, the stranger said he had taken the horse In payment
of a debt, and was about to ship him on board a trading-vessel then
lying in the dock, bound to the East Indies. Would he sell, the minister
asked, on this side of the water? Yes, if he could get his price. While
they talked, Parson Lorrimer caressed the horse, who responded in so
friendly a way that the minister, who had lost his heart at first sight
to the beautiful creature, then and there made the purchase, waiting
only till the banks were open to pay over the money. He had asked few
questions; had known, he said, by Peter's eyes that he was kind, and by
certain unmistakable marks about him that he came of good stock. Of the
stranger, he had seen nothing from that day, and could not even remember
his name.

"'I always knew,' Jonathan Goslee said, 'that the critter had tricks
and ways different from common horses, I've catched him at 'em
sometimes. One day I found him with his bran-tub bottom upwards, amusin'
himself tryin' to stand with all four legs on it at once. And he'll
clear marm's clothes-line at a leap as easy as you'd jump over a pair of
bars. But I never happened to catch him practisin' his
dancin'-lesson--must have done it, though, on the sly, or he couldn't
have footed it so lively that day over to Centerville. Well, sometimes I
think--and then ag'in I don't know. If that there sailor feller stole
the horse he sold in such a hurry to parson, why didn't the owner make a
hue and cry about it, and follow him up? 'Twould have been easy enough
to track the beast to Hilltown. And then ag'in, if 'twas all fair and
square, and he took the horse for a debt, why didn't he sell him to a
show company for a fancy price, instead of shippin' him off to the Indys
in one of them rotten old tubs, that as like as not would go under
before she'd made half the voyage. But there, we never shall get to the
bottom facts in the case, any more than we shall ever know how much
money parson paid down for that horse,'

"And they never did.

"My grandmother remembered Parson Lorrimer as an old man, tall and
straight, with flowing white hair, a placid face, and kind, dim eyes
that gradually grew dimmer, till their light faded to darkness. For the
last four years of his life he was totally blind, She remembered how he
used to mount the pulpit-stairs, one hand resting upon the shoulder of
his colleague, and, standing in the old place, with lifted face and
closed eyes, carry on the service, repeating chapter and hymns from
memory, his voice tremulous, but still sweet and penetrating.

"She remembered going to visit the old man in his study. It was
summer-time, and he sat in his arm-chair at the open window, and on the
grass-plat outside--so near that his head almost touched his master's
shoulder--the old white horse was standing; for they had grown old
together, and together were enjoying a peaceful and contented old age.
Every bright day for hours Peter stood at the window, and in the
winter-time, when he was shut in his stable, the old man never failed to
visit him.

"But one November afternoon, Parson Lorrimer being weary laid himself
down upon his bed, where presently the sleep came to him God giveth to
his beloved.

"The evening after his funeral a member of the household passing the
study-door was startled at seeing in the pale moonlight a long, ghostly
white face peering in at the window.

"It was only Peter, that had slipped his halter and wandered round to
the old place looking for his master. He allowed them to lead him back
to his stable, but every time the door was opened he whinnied and turned
his head. As the days passed and the step he waited for came no more,
hope changed to patient grief. His food often remained untasted; he
refused to go out into the sunshine; and so, gradually wasting and
without much bodily suffering, he one day laid himself down and his life
slipped quietly away.

"He was buried outside the grave-yard, at the top of the hill, as near
as might be to the granite head-stone that recorded the virtues of 'Ye
most faithful Servant and Man of God Silus Timothy Lorrimer Who for 52
Yrs did Minister to This Ch and Congregation in Spiritual Things.

    'The faithful Memory of The Just
    Shall Flourish When they turn To Dust.'

"Peter has no head-stone to mark his grave, but his memory is green in
Hilltown. The old folks love to tell of his beauty, his intelligence,
and his life-long devotion to his master; and there is a tradition
handed down and repeated half-seriously, half in jest, that when
Gabriel blows his trumpet on the resurrection morning, and the dead in
Hilltown grave-yard awake, Parson Lorrimer will lead his flock to the
judgment riding on a white horse."




CHAPTER XI.

THE QUILTING.


The patchwork quilt was finished. The pieces of calico Miss Ruth from
week to week had measured and cut and basted together, with due regard
to contrast and harmony of colors, were transformed into piles of
gay-colored blocks; the blocks multiplied and extended themselves into
strips, and the strips basted together had kept sixteen little hands
"sewing the long seam" for three Wednesday afternoons. And now it was
finished, and the quilting had begun.

Miss Ruth had decided, after a consultation with the minister's wife,
that the girls might do this most important and difficult part of the
business. She wanted the gift to be theirs from beginning to end--that,
having furnished all the material, they should do all the work. How
pleased and proud they were to be thus trusted, you can imagine, while
the satisfaction they took in the result of the summer's labor repaid
their leader a hundred-fold for her share in the enterprise.

Never was a quilt so admired and praised. Of all the odds and ends the
girls had brought in, Ruth Elliot had rejected nothing, not even the
polka-dotted orange print in which Mrs. Jones delighted to array her
baby or the gorgeous green-and-red gingham of Nellie Dimock's new apron.

It took two long afternoons of close work for the girls (not one of whom
had ever quilted before) to accomplish this task; but they did it
bravely and cheerfully. There were pricked fingers and tired arms and
cramped feet, and the big dictionary that raised Nellie Dimock to a
level with her taller companions must have proved any thing but an easy
seat; but no one complained.

Let us look in upon the Patchwork Quilt Society toward the close of this
last afternoon.

"I was sewing on this very block," Mollie Elliot is saying, leaning back
in her chair to survey her work, "when Aunt Ruth was telling us how
Captain Bobtail's Brownie brought Tufty home.

"That pink-and-gray block over there in the corner," said Fannie
Eldridge, pointing with her needle, "was the first one I sewed on. I
made awful work with it, too; for when Dinah Diamond set herself on
fire with the kerosene lamp I forgot what I was about, and took ever so
many long puckery stitches that had to be picked out,"

"If I should sleep under that bed-quilt," said Sammy Ray (Sammy and Roy
had been invited to attend this last meeting of the Society), "what do
you suppose I should dream about?"

No one could imagine.

"A white horse and a yellow dog," the boy said, "'cause I liked those
stories best."

"Yes," said Mollie; "and of course Nellie Dimock would dream about cats,
wouldn't you, Nell? and Roy Tyler about moths and butterflies, and
Florence Austin about birds, and I--well, I should dream of all the
beasts and the birds Aunt Ruth has told us about, all jumbled up
together."

"I shall always remember one thing," Nellie Dimock said, "when I think
about our quilt."

"What is that, Nellie?"

"Not to step on an ant-hill if I can possibly help it, because it blocks
up the street, and the little people have to work so hard to cart away
the dirt."

"I ain't half so afraid of worms as I used to be," Eliza Ann Jones
announced, "since I've found out what funny things they can do; and next
summer I'm going to make some butterflies out of fennel-worms,"

"Roy says," Sammy began, and stopped; for Roy was making forcible
objections to the disclosure.

"Well, what does Roy say?" Miss Ruth asked, knowing nothing of the kicks
administered under the table.

"He won't let me tell," said Sammy.

"He's always telling what I say," said Roy. "Why don't he speak for
himself?"

"Well, I never!" said Sammy. "I thought you was too bashful to speak,
and so I'd do it for you."

"What was it, Roy?"

"Why, I said, when I owned a horse, if he should happen to shy, you
know, I'd cure him of it just as that minister cured Peter."

Here there was a pushing back of chairs and a stir and commotion, for
the last stitch was set to the quilting. Then the binding was put on,
and the quilt was finished; but the September afternoon was finished
too, and Lovina Tibbs lighted the lamps in the dining-room before she
rang the bell for tea.

Lovina had exerted herself in her special department to make this last
meeting of the Society a festive occasion. She gave to the visitors
what she called "a company supper"--biscuits deliciously sweet and
light, cold chicken, plum-preserves, sponge-cake, and for a central dish
a platter containing little frosted cakes, with the letters "P.Q.S."
traced on each in red sugar-sand.

When the feast was over, one last-admiring look given to "our quilt" and
the girls and boys had all gone home, Susie and Mollie sat with their
mother in Miss Ruth's room.

"Auntie," said Susie, who for some moments had been gazing thoughtfully
in the fire, "I have been thinking how nice it would be if, when our
quilt goes to the home missionary, all the interesting stories you have
told us while we were sewing on it could go too. Then the children in
the family would think so much more of it--don't you see? I wish there
was some way for a great many more boys and girls to hear those
stories."

"Why, that's just what Florence Austin was saying this afternoon," said
Mollie. "She said she wished all those stories could be printed in a
book."

"You hear the suggestion, Ruth," Mrs. Elliot said.

But Ruth smiled and shook her head,

"They are such simple little stories," said she.

"For simple little people to read--'for of such is the kingdom of
heaven.' Think, Ruth, if, instead of one Eliza Jones 'making butterflies
out of fennel-worms' next summer, and in that way getting at some
wonderful facts far more effectively than any book could teach her,
there should be a dozen, aria perhaps as many boys resolving, like Roy,
to use kindness and patience instead of cruelty and force in their
dealings with a dumb beast. But you know all this without my preaching.
Ten times one make ten, little sister."

"If I thought my stones would do good," she said.

"Come, I have a proposition to make," said the minister's wife. "You
shall write out the stories--you already have some of them in
manuscript--and I will fill in with the doings of the Patchwork Quilt
Society. Do you agree?"

And that is how this book was written.

Perhaps the readers and lovers of this little book will be glad of a
few pages, by way of introduction, which shall show them somewhat of
Miss Andrews herself, and of her way of writing and teaching, as an
old friend and schoolmate may try to tell it; and, to begin with, a
glimpse of the happy day when she called a few of her friends together
to listen to the stories contained in this volume, before they were
offered to a publisher.

Picture to yourselves a group of young ladies in one of the loveliest
of old-fashioned parlors, looking out on a broad, elm-shaded street
in the old town of Newburyport. The room is long and large, with wide
mahogany seats in the four deep windows, ancient mahogany chairs, and
great bookcases across one side of the room, with dark pier-tables and
centre-table, and large mirror,--all of ancestral New England solidity
and rich simplicity; some saintly portraits on the wall, a modern
easel in the corner accounting for fine bits of coloring on canvas,
crayon drawings about the room, and a gorgeous firescreen of autumn
tints; nasturtium vines in bloom glorifying the south window, and
German ivy decorating the north corner; choice books here and there,
not to look at only, but to be assimilated; with an air of quiet
refinement and the very essence of cultured homeness pervading
all;--this is the meagre outline of a room, which, having once sat
within, you would wish never to see changed, in which many pure and
noble men and women have loved to commune with the lives which have
been so blent with all its suggestions that it almost seems a part of
their organic being.

But it was twenty-five years ago [This memorial was written in 1887.]
that this circle of congenial and expectant young people were drawn
together in the room to listen to the first reading of the MSS. of
"The Seven Little Sisters." I will not name them all; but one whose
youthful fame and genius were the pride of all, Harriet Prescott (now
Mrs. Spofford), was Jane's friend and neighbor for years, and heard
most of her books in MSS. They were all friends, and in a very
sympathetic and eager attitude of mind, you may well believe; for
in the midst, by the centre-table, sits Jane, who has called them
together; and knowing that she has really written a book, each one
feels almost that she herself has written it in some unconscious way,
because each feels identified with Jane's work, and is ready to be as
proud of it, and as sure of it, as all the world is now of the success
of Miss Jane Andrews's writings for the boys and girls in these little
stories of geography and history which bear her name.

I can see Jane sitting there, as I wish you could, with her MSS. on
the table at her side. She is very sweet and good and noble-looking,
with soft, heavy braids of light-brown hair carefully arranged on her
fine, shapely head; her forehead is full and broad; her eyes large,
dark blue, and pleasantly commanding, but with very gentle and dreamy
phases interrupting their placid decision of expression; her features
are classic and firm in outline, with pronounced resolution in the
close of the full lips, or of hearty merriment in the open laugh,
illuminated by a dazzle of well-set teeth; her complexion fresh
and pure, and the whole aspect of her face kind, courageous, and
inspiring, as well as thoughtful and impressive. The poise of her head
and rather strongly built figure is unusually good, and suggestive
of health, dignity, and leadership; yet her manners and voice are so
gentle, and her whole demeanor so benevolent, that no one could be
offended at her taking naturally the direction of any work, or the
planning of any scheme, which she would also be foremost in executing.

But there she sits looking up at her friends, with her papers in hand,
and the pretty businesslike air that so well became her, and bespeaks
the extreme criticism of her hearers upon what she shall read, because
she really wants to know how it affects them, and what mistakes or
faults can be detected; for she must do her work as well as possible,
and is sure they are willing to help. "You see," says Jane, "I have
dedicated the book to the children I told the stories to first,
when the plan was only partly in my mind, and they seemed to grow
by telling, till at last they finished themselves; and the children
seemed to care so much for them, that I thought if they were put into
a book other children might care for them too, and they might possibly
do some good in the world."

Yes, those were the points that always indicated the essential aim
and method of Jane's writing and teaching, the elements out of which
sprang all her work; viz., the relation of her mind to the actual
individual children she knew and loved, and the natural growth of her
thought through their sympathy, and the accretion of all she read and
discovered while the subject lay within her brooding brain, as well
as the single dominant purpose to do some good in the world. There was
definiteness as well as breadth in her way of working all through her
life.

I wish I could remember exactly what was said by that critical circle;
for there were some quick and brilliant minds, and some pungent powers
of appreciation, and some keen-witted young women in that group.
Perhaps I might say they had all felt the moulding force of some very
original and potential educators as they had been growing up into
their young womanhood. Some of these were professional educators of
lasting pre-eminence; others were not professed teachers, yet in the
truest and broadest sense teachers of very wide and wise and inspiring
influence; and of these Thomas Wentworth Higginson had come more
intimately and effectually into formative relations with the minds and
characters of those gathered in that sunny room than any other person.
They certainly owed much of the loftiness and breadth of their aim
in life, and their comprehension of the growth and work to be
accomplished in the world, to his kind and steady instigation. I wish
I could remember what they said, and what Jane said; but all that has
passed away. I think somebody objected to the length of the title,
which Jane admitted to be a fault, but said something of wishing to
get the idea of the unity of the world into it as the main idea of the
book. I only recall the enthusiastic delight with which chapter
after chapter was greeted; we declared that it was a fairy tale of
geography, and a work of genius in its whole conception, and in its
absorbing interest of detail and individuality; and that any publisher
would demonstrate himself an idiot who did not want to publish it. I
remember Jane's quick tossing back of the head, and puzzled brow which
broke into a laugh, as she said: "Well, girls, it can't be as good as
you say; there must be some faults in it." But we all exclaimed that
we had done our prettiest at finding fault,--that there wasn't a
ghost of a fault in it. For the incarnate beauty and ideality and
truthfulness of her little stories had melted into our being, and left
us spellbound, till we were one with each other and her; one with the
Seven Little Sisters, too, and they seemed like our very own little
sisters. So they have rested in our imagination and affection as we
have seen them grow into the imagination and affection of generations
of children since, and as they will continue to grow until the
old limitations and barrenness of the study of geography shall be
transfigured, and the earth seem to the children an Eden which love
has girdled, when Gemila, Agoonack, and the others shall have won them
to a knowledge of the brotherhood of man and the fatherhood of God.

I would like to bring before young people who have read her books some
qualities of her mind and character which made her the rare woman,
teacher, and writer that she was. I knew her from early girlhood. We
went to the same schools, in more and more intimate companionship,
from the time we were twelve until we were twenty years of age; and
our lives and hearts were "grappled" to each other "with links of
steel" ever after. She was a precocious child, early matured, and
strong in intellectual and emotional experiences. She had a remarkably
clear mind, orderly and logical in its processes, and loved to take
up hard problems. She studied all her life with great joy and
earnestness, rarely, if ever, baffled in her persistent learning
except by ill-health. She went on at a great pace in mathematics for a
young girl; every step seemed easy to her. She took everything
severe that she could get a chance at, in the course or out of
it,--surveying, navigation, mechanics, mathematical astronomy, and
conic sections, as well as the ordinary course in mathematics; the
calculus she had worked through at sixteen under a very able and exact
teacher, and took her diploma from W.H. Wells, a master who allowed
nothing to go slipshod. She was absorbed in studies of this kind, and
took no especial interest in composition or literature beyond what was
required, and what was the natural outcome of a literary atmosphere
and inherited culture; that is, her mind was passively rather than
actively engaged in such directions, until later. At the normal school
she led a class which has had a proud intellectual record as teachers
and workers. She was the easy victor in every contest; with an
inclusive grasp, an incisive analysis, instant generalization, a very
tenacious and ready memory, and unusual talent for every effort of
study, she took and held the first place as a matter of course until
she graduated, when she gave the valedictory address. This valedictory
was a prophetic note in the line of her future expression; for it
gave a graphic illustration of the art of teaching geography, to the
consideration of which she had been led by Miss Crocker's logical,
suggestive, and masterly presentation of the subject in the school
course. Her ability and steadiness of working power, as well as
singleness of aim, attracted the attention of Horace Mann, who was
about forming the nucleus of Antioch College; and he succeeded in
gaining her as one of his promised New England recruits. She had
attended very little to Latin, and went to work at once to prepare for
the classical requirements of a college examination. This she did with
such phenomenal rapidity that in six weeks she had fitted herself
for what was probably equivalent to a Harvard entrance examination
in Latin. She went to Antioch, and taught, as well as studied for a
while, until her health gave way entirely; and she was prostrate for
years with brain and spine disorders. Of course this put an end to her
college career; and on her recovery she opened her little school in
her own house, which she held together until her final illness, and
to which she devoted her thoughts and energies, her endowments and
attainments, as well as her prodigal devotion and love.

The success of "The Seven Little Sisters" was a great pleasure to
her, partly because her dear mother and friends were so thoroughly
satisfied with it. Her mother always wished that Jane would give
her time more exclusively to writing, especially as new outlines of
literary work were constantly aroused in her active brain. She wrote
several stories which were careful studies in natural science, and
which appeared in some of the magazines. I am sure they would be well
worth collecting. She had her plan of "Each and All" long in her mind
before elaborating, and it crystallized by actual contact with the
needs and the intellectual instincts of her little classes. In fact
all her books grew, like a plant, from within outwards; they were born
in the nursery of the schoolroom, and nurtured by the suggestions of
the children's interest, thus blooming in the garden of a true and
natural education. The last book she wrote, "Ten Boys Who Lived on the
Road from Long Ago to Now," she had had in her mind for years. This
little book she dedicated to a son of her sister Margaret. I am sure
she gave me an outline of the plan fully ten years before she wrote
it out. The subject of her mental work lay in her mind, growing,
gathering to itself nourishment, and organizing itself consciously
or unconsciously by all the forces of her unresting brain and all
the channels of her study, until it sprung from her pen complete at
a stroke. She wrote good English, of course, and would never
sentimentalize, but went directly at the pith of the matter; and, if
she had few thoughts on a subject, she made but few words. I don't
think she did much by way of revising or recasting after her thought
was once committed to paper. I think she wrote it as she would
have said it, always with an imaginary child before her, to whose
intelligence and sympathy it was addressed. Her habit of mind was to
complete a thought before any attempt to convey it to others. This
made her a very helpful and clear teacher and leader. She seemed
always to have considered carefully anything she talked about, and
gave her opinion with a deliberation and clear conviction which
affected others as a verdict, and made her an oracle to a great
many kinds of people. All her plans were thoroughly shaped before
execution; all her work was true, finished, and conscientious in every
department. She did a great deal of quiet, systematic thinking from
her early school days onward, and was never satisfied until she
completed the act of thought by expression and manifestation in some
way for the advantage of others. The last time I saw her, which was
for less than five minutes accorded me by her nurse during her last
illness, she spoke of a new plan of literary work which she had in
mind, and although she attempted no delineation of it, said she was
thinking it out whenever she felt that it was safe for her to think.
Her active brain never ceased its plans for others, for working toward
the illumination of the mind, the purification of the soul, and the
elevation and broadening of all the ideals of life. I remember her
sitting, absorbed in reflection, at the setting of the sun every
evening while we were at the House Beautiful of the Peabodys [We spent
nearly all our time at West Newton in a little cottage on the hill,
where Miss Elizabeth Peabody, with her saintly mother and father, made
a paradise of love and refinement and ideal culture for us, and where
we often met the Hawthornes and Manns; and we shall never be able to
measure the wealth of intangible mental and spiritual influence which
we received therefrom.] at West Newton; or, when at home, gazing
every night, before retiring, from her own house-top, standing at
her watchtower to commune with the starry heavens, and receive that
exaltation of spirit which is communicated when we yield ourselves to
the "essentially religious." (I use this phrase, because it delighted
her so when I repeated it to her as the saying of a child in looking
at the stars.)

No one ever felt a twinge of jealousy in Jane's easy supremacy; she
never made a fuss about it, although I think she had no mock
modesty in the matter. She accepted the situation which her uniform
correctness of judgment assured to her, while she always accorded
generous praise and deference to those who excelled her in departments
where she made no pretence of superiority.

There were some occasions when her idea of duty differed from a
conventional one, perhaps from that of some of her near friends; but
no one ever doubted her strict dealing with herself, or her singleness
of motive. She did not feel the need of turning to any other
conscience than her own for support or enlightenment, and was
inflexible and unwavering in any course she deemed right. She never
apologized for herself in any way, or referred a matter of her own
experience or sole responsibility to another for decision; neither did
she seem to feel the need of expressed sympathy in any private loss
or trial. Her philosophy of life, her faith, or her temperament seemed
equal to every exigency of disappointment or suffering. She generally
kept her personal trials hidden within her own heart, and recovered
from every selfish pain by the elastic vigor of her power for
unselfish devotion to the good of others. She said that happiness was
to have an unselfish work to do, and the power to do it.

It has been said that Jane's only fault was that she was too good.
I think she carried her unselfishness too often to a short-sighted
excess, breaking down her health, and thus abridging her opportunities
for more permanent advantage to those whom she would have died to
serve; but it was solely on her own responsibility, and in consequence
of her accumulative energy of temperament, that made her unconscious
of the strain until too late.

Her brain was constitutionally sensitive and almost abnormally active;
and she more than once overtaxed it by too continuous study, or by a
disregard of its laws of health, or by a stupendous multiplicity of
cares, some of which it would have been wiser to leave to others. She
took everybody's burdens to carry herself. She was absorbed in the
affairs of those she loved,--of her home circle, of her sisters'
families, and of many a needy one whom she adopted into her
solicitude. She was thoroughly fond of children and of all that they
say and do, and would work her fingers off for them, or nurse them day
and night. Her sisters' children were as if they had been her own, and
she revelled in all their wonderful manifestations and development.
Her friends' children she always cared deeply for, and was hungry for
their wise and funny remarks, or any hint of their individuality. Many
of these things she remembered longer than the mothers themselves, and
took the most thorough satisfaction in recounting.

I have often visited her school, and it seemed like a home with a
mother in it. There we took sweet counsel together, as if we had come
to the house of God in company; for our methods were identical, and
a day in her school was a day in mine. We invariably agreed as to the
ends of the work, and how to reach them; for we understood each other
perfectly in that field of art.

I wish I could show her life with all its constituent factors of
ancestry, home, and surroundings; for they were so inherent in her
thoughts and feelings that you could hardly separate her from them in
your consideration. But that is impossible. Disinterested benevolence
was the native air of the house into which she was born, and she was
an embodiment of that idea. To devote herself to some poor outcast, to
reform a distorted soul, to give all she had to the most abject, to do
all she could for the despised and rejected,--this was her craving and
absorbing desire. I remember some comical instances of the pursuance
of this self-abnegation, where the returns were, to say the least,
disappointing; but she was never discouraged. It would be easy to name
many who received a lifelong stimulus and aid at her hands, either
intellectual or moral. She had much to do with the development of some
remarkable careers, as well as with the regeneration of many poor and
abandoned souls.

She was in the lives of her dear ones, and they in hers, to a very
unusual degree; and her life-threads are twined inextricably in theirs
forever. She was a complete woman,--brain, will, affections, all, to
the greatest extent, active and unselfish; her character was a harmony
of many strong and diverse elements; her conscience was a great rock
upon which her whole nature rested; her hands were deft and cunning;
her ingenious brain was like a master mechanic at expedients; and
in executive and administrative power, as well as in device and
comprehension, she was a marvel. If she had faults, they are
indistinguishable in the brightness and solidity of her whole
character. She was ready to move into her place in any sphere, and
adjust herself to any work God should give her to do. She must
be happy, and shedding happiness, wherever she is; for that is an
inseparable quality and function of her identity.

She passed calmly out of this life, and lay at rest in her own home,
in that dear room so full of memories of her presence, with flowers
to deck her bed, and many of her dearest friends around her; while the
verses which her beloved sister Caroline had selected seemed easily to
speak with Jane's own voice, as they read:--

  Prepare the house, kind friends; drape it and deck it
    With leaves and blossoms fair:
  Throw open doors and windows, and call hither
    The sunshine and soft air.

  Let all the house, from floor to ceiling, look
    Its noblest and its best;
  For it may chance that soon may come to me
    A most imperial guest.

  A prouder visitor than ever yet
    Has crossed my threshold o'er,
  One wearing royal sceptre and a crown
    Shall enter at my door;

  Shall deign, perchance, sit at my board an hour,
    And break with me my bread;
  Suffer, perchance, this night my honored roof
   Shelter his kingly head.

  And if, ere comes the sun again, he bid me
    Arise without delay,
  And follow him a journey to his kingdom
    Unknown and far away;

  And in the gray light of the dawning morn
    We pass from out my door,
  My guest and I, silent, without farewell,
    And to return no more,--

  Weep not, kind friends, I pray; not with vain tears
    Let your glad eyes grow dim;
  Remember that my house was all prepared,
    And that I welcomed him.





Dear children, I have heard of a wonderful ball, which floats in the
sweet blue air, and has little soft white clouds about it, as it swims
along.

There are many charming and astonishing things to be told of this
ball, and some of them you shall hear.

In the first place, you must know that it is a very big ball; far
bigger than the great soft ball, of bright colors, that little Charley
plays with on the floor,--yes, indeed; and bigger than cousin Frank's
largest football, that he brought home from college in the spring;
bigger, too, than that fine round globe in the schoolroom, that Emma
turns about so carefully, while she twists her bright face all into
wrinkles as she searches for Afghanistan or the Bosphorus Straits.
Long names, indeed; they sound quite grand from her little mouth, but
they mean nothing to you and me now.

Let me tell you about _my_ ball. It is so large that trees can grow on
it; so large that cattle can graze, and wild beasts roam, upon it; so
large that men and women can live on it, and little children too,--as
you already know, if you have read the title-page of this book. In
some places it is soft and green, like the long meadow between the
hills, where the grass was so high last summer that we almost lost
Marnie when she lay down to roll in it; in some parts it is covered
with tall and thick forests, where you might wander like the "babes
in the wood," nor ever find your way out; then, again, it is steep and
rough, covered with great hills, much higher than that high one behind
the schoolhouse,--so high that when you look up ever so far you can't
see the tops of them; but in some parts there are no hills at all, and
quiet little ponds of blue water, where the white water-lilies grow,
and silvery fishes play among their long stems. Bell knows, for she
has been among the lilies in a boat with papa.

Now, if we look on another side of the ball, we shall see no ponds,
but something very dreary. I am afraid you won't like it. A great
plain of sand,--sand like that on the seashore, only here there is no
sea,--and the sand stretches away farther than you can see, on every
side; there are no trees, and the sunshine beats down, almost burning
whatever is beneath it.

Perhaps you think this would be a grand place to build sand-houses.
One of the little sisters lives here; and, when you read of her, you
will know what she thinks about it. Always the one who has tried it
knows best.

Look at one more side of my ball, as it turns around. Jack Frost must
have spent all his longest winter nights here, for see what a palace
of ice he has built for himself. Brave men have gone to those lonely
places, to come back and tell us about them; and, alas! some heroes
have not returned, but have lain down there to perish of cold and
hunger. Doesn't it look cold, the clear blue ice, almost as blue as
the air? And look at the snow, drifts upon drifts, and the air filled
with feathery flakes even now.

We won't look at this side longer, but we shall come back again to see
Agoonack in her little sledge. Don't turn over yet to find the story;
we shall come to it all in good time.

Now, what do you think of my ball, so white and cold, so soft and
green, so quiet and blue, so dreary and rough, as it floats along in
the sweet blue air, with the flocks of white clouds about it?

I will tell you one thing more. The wise men have said that this earth
on which we live is nothing more nor less than just such a ball. Of
this we shall know when we are older and wiser; but here is the little
brown baby waiting for us.





Far away in the warm country lives a little brown baby; she has a
brown face, little brown hands and fingers, brown body, arms, and
legs, and even her little toes are also brown.

And this baby wears no little frock nor apron, no little petticoat,
nor even stockings and shoes,--nothing at all but a string of beads
around her neck, as you wear your coral; for the sun shines very
warmly there, and she needs no clothes to keep her from the cold.

Her hair is straight and black, hanging softly down each side of her
small brown face; nothing at all like Bell's golden curls, or Marnie's
sunny brown ones.

Would you like to know how she lives among the flowers and the birds?

She rolls in the long soft grass, where the gold-colored snakes are at
play; she watches the young monkeys chattering and swinging among the
trees, hung by the tail; she chases the splendid green parrots that
fly among the trees; and she drinks the sweet milk of the cocoanut
from a round cup made of its shell.

When night comes, the mother takes her baby and tosses her up into the
little swinging bed in the tree, which her father made for her from
the twisting vine that climbs among the branches. And the wind blows
and rocks the little bed; and the mother sits at the foot of the tree
singing a mild sweet song, and this brown baby falls asleep. Then the
stars come out and peep through the leaves at her. The birds, too, are
all asleep in the tree; the mother-bird spreading her wings over the
young ones in the nest, and the father-bird sitting on a twig close
by with his head under his wing. Even the chattering monkey has curled
himself up for the night.

Soon the large round moon comes up. She, too, must look into the
swinging bed, and shine upon the closed eyes of the little brown baby.
She is very gentle, and sends her soft light among the branches and
thick green leaves, kissing tenderly the small brown feet, and the
crest on the head of the mother-bird, who opens one eye and looks
quickly about to see if any harm is coming to the young ones. The
bright little stars, too, twinkle down through the shadows to bless
the sleeping child. All this while the wind blows and rocks the little
bed, singing also a low song through the trees; for the brown mother
has fallen asleep herself, and left the night-wind to take care of her
baby.

So the night moves on, until, all at once, the rosy dawn breaks over
the earth; the birds lift up their heads, and sing and sing; the great
round sun springs up, and, shining into the tree, lifts the shut lids
of the brown baby's eyes. She rolls over and falls into her mother's
arms, who dips her into the pretty running brook for a bath, and rolls
her in the grass to dry, and then she may play among the birds and
flowers all day long; for they are like merry brothers and sisters
to the happy child, and she plays with them on the bosom of the round
earth, which seems to love them all like a mother.

This is the little brown baby. Do you love her? Do you think you would
know her if you should meet her some day?

A funny little brown sister. Are all of them brown?

We will see, for here comes Agoonack and her sledge.






What is this odd-looking mound of stone? It looks like the great brick
oven that used to be in our old kitchen, where, when I was a little
girl, I saw the fine large loaves of bread and the pies and puddings
pushed carefully in with a long, flat shovel, or drawn out with the
same when the heat had browned them nicely.

Is this an oven standing out here alone in the snow?

You will laugh when I tell you that it is not an oven, but a house;
and here lives little Agoonack.

Do you see that low opening, close to the ground? That is the door;
but one must creep on hands and knees to enter. There is another
smaller hole above the door: it is the window. It has no glass, as
ours do; only a thin covering of something which Agoonack's father
took from the inside of a seal, and her mother stretched over the
window-hole, to keep out the cold and to let in a little light.

Here lives our little girl; not as the brown baby does, among the
trees and the flowers, but far up in the cold countries amid snow and
ice.

If we look off now, over the ice, we shall see a funny little clumsy
thing, running along as fast as its short, stout legs will permit,
trying to keep up with its mother. You will hardly know it to be a
little girl, but might rather call it a white bear's cub, it is so
oddly dressed in the white, shaggy coat of the bear which its father
killed last month. But this is really Agoonack; you can see her round,
fat, greasy little face, if you throw back the white jumper-hood which
covers her head. Shall I tell you what clothes she wears?

Not at all like yours, you will say; but, when one lives in cold
countries, one must dress accordingly.

First, she has socks, soft and warm, but not knit of the white yarn
with which mamma knits yours. Her mamma has sewed them from the skins
of birds, with the soft down upon them to keep the small brown feet
very warm. Over these come her moccasins of sealskin.

If you have been on the seashore, perhaps you know the seals that
are sometimes seen swimming in the sea, holding up their brown heads,
which look much like dogs' heads, wet and dripping.

The seals love best to live in the seas of the cold countries: here
they are, huddled together on the sloping rocky shores, or swimming
about under the ice, thousands and thousands of silver-gray coated
creatures, gentle seal-mothers and brave fathers with all their pretty
seal-babies. And here the Esquimaux (for that is the name by which
we call these people of the cold countries) hunt them, eat them for
dinner, and make warm clothes of their skins. So, as I told you,
Agoonack has sealskin boots.

Next she wears leggings, or trousers, of white bear-skin, very rough
and shaggy, and a little jacket or frock, called a jumper, of the
same. This jumper has a hood, made like the little red riding-hoods
which I dare say you have all seen. Pull the hood up over the short,
black hair, letting it almost hide the fat, round face, and you have
Agoonack dressed.

Is this her best dress, do you think?

Certainly it is her best, because she has no other, and when she goes
into the house--but I think I won't tell you that yet, for there is
something more to be seen outside.

Agoonack and her mother are coming home to dinner, but there is no sun
shining on the snow to make it sparkle. It is dark like night, and
the stars shine clear and steady like silver lamps in the sky, but far
off, between the great icy peaks, strange lights are dancing, shooting
long rosy flames far into the sky, or marching in troops as if each
light had a life of its own, and all were marching together along the
dark, quiet sky. Now they move slowly and solemnly, with no noise,
and in regular, steady file; then they rush all together, flame into
golden and rosy streamers, and mount far above the cold, icy mountain
peaks that glitter in their light; we hear a sharp sound like Dsah!
Dsah! and the ice glows with the warm color, and the splendor shines
on the little white-hooded girl as she trots beside her mother.

It is far more beautiful than the fireworks on Fourth of July.
Sometimes we see a little of it here, and we say there are northern
lights, and we sit at the window watching all the evening to see them
march and turn and flash; but in the cold countries they are far more
brilliant than any we have seen.

It is Agoonack's birthday, and there is a present for her before the
door of the house. I will make you a picture of it. "It is a sled,"
you exclaim. Yes, a sled; but quite unlike yours. In the faraway cold
countries no trees grow; so her father had no wood, and he took the
bones of the walrus and the whale, bound them together with strips of
sealskin, and he has built this pretty sled for his little daughter's
birthday.

It has a back to lean against and hold by, for the child will go over
some very rough places, and might easily fall from it. And then, you
see, if she fell, it would be no easy matter to jump up again and
climb back to her seat, for the little sled would have run away from
her before she should have time to pick herself up. How could it run?
Yes, that is the wonderful thing about it. When her father made the
sled he said to himself, "By the time this is finished, the two little
brown dogs will be old enough to draw it, and Agoonack shall have
them; for she is a princess, the daughter of a great chief."

Now you can see that, with two such brisk little dogs as the brown
puppies harnessed to the sled, Agoonack must keep her seat firmly,
that she may not roll over into the snow and let the dogs run away
with it.

You can imagine what gay frolics she has with her brother who runs at
her side, or how she laughs and shouts to see him drive his bone ball
with his bone bat or hockey, skimming it over the crusty snow.

Now we will creep into the low house with the child and her mother,
and see how they live.

Outside it is very cold, colder than you have ever known it to be in
the coldest winter's day; but inside it is warm, even very hot.
And the first thing Agoonack and her mother do is to take off their
clothes, for here it is as warm as the place where the brown baby
lives, who needs no clothes.

It isn't the sunshine that makes it warm, for you remember I told you
it was as dark as night. There is no furnace in the cellar; indeed,
there is no cellar, neither is there a stove. But all this heat comes
from a sort of lamp, with long wicks of moss and plenty of walrus fat
to burn. It warms the small house, which has but one room, and over it
the mother hangs a shallow dish in which she cooks soup; but most of
the meat is eaten raw, cut into long strips, and eaten much as one
might eat a stick of candy.

They have no bread, no crackers, no apples nor potatoes; nothing but
meat, and sometimes the milk of the reindeer, for there are no cows in
the far, cold northern countries. But the reindeer gives them a great
deal: he is their horse as well as their cow; his skin and his flesh,
his bones and horns, are useful when he is dead, and while he lives he
is their kind, gentle, and patient friend.

There is some one else in the hut when Agoonack comes home,--a little
dark ball, rolled up on one corner of the stone platform which is
built all around three sides of the house, serving for seats, beds,
and table. This rolled-up ball unrolls itself, tumbles off the seat,
and runs to meet them. It is Sipsu, the baby brother of Agoonack,--a
round little boy, who rides sometimes, when the weather is not too
cold, in the hood of his mother's jumper, hanging at her back, and
peering out from his warm nestling-place over the long icy plain to
watch for his father's return from the bear-hunt.

When the men come home dragging the great Nannook, as they call the
bear, there is a merry feast. They crowd together in the hut, bringing
in a great block of snow, which they put over the lamp-fire to melt
into water; and then they cut long strips of bear's meat, and laugh
and eat and sing, as they tell the long story of the hunt of Nannook,
and the seals they have seen, and the foot-tracks of the reindeer they
have met in the long valley.

Perhaps the day will come when pale, tired travellers will come to
their sheltering home, and tell them wonderful stories, and share
their warmth for a while, till they can gain strength to go on their
journey again.

Perhaps while they are so merry there all together, a very great
snowstorm will come and cover the little house, so that they cannot
get out for several days. When the storm ends, they dig out the low
doorway, and creep again into the starlight, and Agoonack slips into
her warm clothes and runs out for Jack Frost to kiss her cheeks, and
leave roses wherever his lips touch. If it is very cold indeed, she
must stay in, or Jack Frost will give her no roses, but a cold, frosty
bite.

This is the way Agoonack lives through the long darkness. But I have
to tell you more of her in another chapter, and you will find it is
not always dark in the cold northern countries.






It is almost noon one day when Agoonack's mother wraps the little girl
in her shaggy clothes and climbs with her a high hill, promising a
pleasant sight when they shall have reached the top.

It is the sun, the beautiful, bright, round sun, which shines and
smiles at them for a minute, and then slips away again below the far,
frozen water.

They haven't seen him for many months, and now they rejoice, for the
next day he comes again and stays longer, and the next, and the next,
and every day longer and longer, until at last he moves above them in
one great, bright circle, and does not even go away at all at night.
His warm rays melt the snow and awaken the few little hardy flowers
that can grow in this short summer. The icy coat breaks away from the
clear running water, and great flocks of birds with soft white plumage
come, like a snowstorm of great feathery flakes, and settle among the
black rocks along the seashore. Here they lay their eggs in the many
safe little corners and shelves of the rock; and here they circle
about in the sunshine, while the Esquimau boys make ready their
long-handled nets and creep and climb out upon the ledges of rock,
and, holding up the net as the birds fly by, catch a netful to carry
home for supper.

The sun shines all day long, and all night long, too; and yet he
can't melt all the highest snowdrifts, where the boys are playing
bat-and-ball,--long bones for sticks, and an odd little round one for
a ball.

It is a merry life they all live while the sunshine stays, for they
know the long, dark winter is coming, when they can no longer climb
among the birds, nor play ball among the drifts.

The seals swim by in the clear water, and the walrus and her young one
are at play; and, best of all, the good reindeer has come, for the sun
has uncovered the crisp moss upon which he feeds, and he is roaming
through the valleys where it grows among the rocks.

The old men sit on the rocks in the sunshine, and laugh and sing, and
tell long stories of the whale and the seal, and the great white
whale that, many years ago, when Agoonack's father was a child, came
swimming down from the far north, where they look for the northern
lights, swimming and diving through the broken ice; and they watched
her in wonder, and no one would throw a harpoon at this white lady of
the Greenland seas, for her visit was a good omen, promising a mild
winter.

Little Agoonack comes from her play to crouch among the rocky ledges
and listen to the stories. She has no books; and, if she had, she
couldn't read them. Neither could her father or mother read to her:
their stories are told and sung, but never written. But she is
a cheerful and contented little girl, and tries to help her dear
friends; and sometimes she wonders a great while by herself about what
the pale stranger told them.

And now, day by day, the sun is slipping away from them; gone for a
few minutes to-day, to-morrow it will stay away a few more, until
at last there are many hours of rosy twilight, and few, very few, of
clear sunshine.

But the children are happy: they do not dread the winter, but they
hope the tired travellers have reached their homes; and Agoonack
wants, oh, so much! to see them and help them once more. The father
will hunt again, and the mother will tend the lamp and keep the house
warm; and, although they will have no sun, the moon and stars are
bright, and they will see again the streamers of the great northern
light.

Would you like to live in the cold countries, with their long darkness
and long sunshine?

It is very cold, to be sure, but there are happy children there, and
kind fathers and mothers, and the merriest sliding on the very best of
ice and snow.





It is almost sunset; and Abdel Hassan has come out to the door of
his tent to enjoy the breeze, which is growing cooler after the day's
terrible heat. The round, red sun hangs low over the sand; it will be
gone in five minutes more. The tent-door is turned away from the sun,
and Abdel Hassan sees only the rosy glow of its light on the hills in
the distance which looked so purple all day. He sits very still, and
his earnest eyes are fixed on those distant hills. He does not move or
speak when the tent-door is again pushed aside, and his two children,
Alee and Gemila, come out with their little mats and seat themselves
also on the sand. You can see little Gemila in the picture. How glad
they are of the long, cool shadows, and the tall, feathery palms! how
pleasant to hear the camels drink, and to drink themselves at the deep
well, when they have carried some fresh water in a cup to their silent
father! He only sends up blue circles of smoke from his long pipe as
he sits there, cross-legged, on a mat of rich carpet. He never sat in
a chair, and, indeed, never saw one in his life. His chairs are mats;
and his house is, as you have heard, a tent.

Do you know what a tent is?

I always liked tents, and thought I should enjoy living in one; and
when I was a little girl, on many a stormy day when we couldn't go to
school, I played with my sisters at living in tents. We would take a
small clothes-horse and tip it down upon its sides, half open; then,
covering it with shawls, we crept in, and were happy enough for the
rest of the afternoon. I tell you this, that you may also play tents
some day, if you haven't already.

The tent of Gemila's father is, however, quite different from ours.
Two or three long poles hold it up, and over them hangs a cloth made
of goats'-hair, or sometimes sheepskins, which are thick enough to
keep out either heat or cold. The ends of the cloth are fastened down
by pegs driven into the sand, or the strong wind coming might blow
the tent away. The tent-cloth pushes back like a curtain for the door.
Inside, a white cloth stretched across divides this strange house into
two rooms; one is for the men, the other for the women and children.
In the tent there is no furniture like ours; nothing but mats, and low
cushions called divans; not even a table from which to eat, nor a
bed to sleep upon. But the mats and the shawls are very gorgeous and
costly, and we are very proud when we can buy any like them for our
parlors. And, by the way, I must tell you that these people have been
asleep all through the heat of the day,--the time when you would have
been coming home from school, eating your dinner, and going back to
school again. They closed the tent-door to keep out the terrible blaze
of the sun, stretched themselves on the mats, and slept until just
now, when the night-wind began to come.

Now they can sit outside the tent and enjoy the evening, and the
mother brings out dates and little hard cakes of bread, with plenty of
butter made from goats' milk. The tall, dark servant-woman, with loose
blue cotton dress and bare feet, milks a camel, and they all take
their supper, or dinner perhaps I had better call it. They have no
plates, nor do they sit together to eat. The father eats by himself:
when he has finished, the mother and children take the dates and bread
which he leaves. We could teach them better manners, we think; but
they could teach us to be hospitable and courteous, and more polite to
strangers than we are.

When all is finished, you see there are no dishes to be washed and put
away.

The stars have come out, and from the great arch of the sky they look
down on the broad sands, the lonely rocks, the palm-trees, and the
tents. Oh, they are so bright, so steady, and so silent, in that
great, lonely place, where no noise is heard! no sounds of people or
of birds or animals, excepting the sleepy groaning of a camel, or the
low song that little Alee is singing to his sister as they lie upon
their backs on the sand, and watch the slow, grand movement of the
stars that are always journeying towards the west.

Night is very beautiful in the desert; for this is the desert, where
Abdel Hassan the Arab lives. His country is that part of our round
ball where the yellow sands stretch farther than eye can see, and
there are no wide rivers, no thick forests, and no snow-covered hills.
The day is too bright and too hot, but the night he loves; it is his
friend.

He falls asleep at last out under the stars, and, since he has been
sleeping so long in the daytime, can well afford to be awake very
early in the morning: so, while the stars still shine, and there is
only one little yellow line of light in the east, he calls his
wife, children, and servants, and in a few minutes all is bustle and
preparation; for to-day they must take down the tent, and move, with
all the camels and goats, many miles away. For the summer heat has
nearly dried up the water of their little spring under the palm-trees,
and the grass that grew there is also entirely gone; and one cannot
live without water to drink, particularly in the desert, nor can the
goats and camels live without grass.

Now, it would be a very bad thing for us, if some day all the water
in our wells and springs and ponds should dry up, and all the grass on
our pleasant pastures and hills should wither away.

What should we do? Should we have to pack all our clothes, our books,
our furniture and food, and move away to some other place where there
were both water and grass, and then build new houses? Oh, how much
trouble it would give us! No doubt the children would think it great
fun; but as they grew older they would have no pleasant home to
remember, with all that makes "sweet home" so dear.

And now you will see how much better it is for Gemila's father than if
he lived in a house. In a very few minutes the tent is taken down, the
tent-poles are tied together, the covering is rolled up with the pegs
and strings which fastened it, and it is all ready to put up again
whenever they choose to stop. As there is no furniture to carry, the
mats and cushions only are to be rolled together and tied; and now
Achmet, the old servant, brings a tall yellow camel.

Did you ever see a camel? I hope you have some time seen a living one
in a menagerie; but, if you haven't, perhaps you have seen a picture
of the awkward-looking animal with a great hump upon his back, a long
neck, and head thrust forward. A boy told me the other day, that, when
the camel had been long without food, he ate his hump: he meant that
the flesh and fat of the hump helped to nourish him when he had no
food.

Achmet speaks to the camel, and he immediately kneels upon the sand,
while the man loads him with the tent-poles and covering; after which
he gets up, moves on a little way, to make room for another to come
up, kneel, and be loaded with mats, cushions, and bags of dates.

Then comes a third; and while he kneels, another servant comes from
the spring, bringing a great bag made of camels'-skin, and filled with
water. Two of these bags are hung upon the camel, one on each side.
This is the water for all these people to drink for four days, while
they travel through a sandy, rocky country, where there are no springs
or wells. I am afraid the water will not taste very fresh after it has
been kept so long in leather bags; but they have nothing else to carry
it in, and, besides, they are used to it, and don't mind the taste.

Here are smaller bags, made of goats'-skin, and filled with milk; and
when all these things are arranged, which is soon done, they are ready
to start, although it is still long before sunrise. The camels have
been drinking at the spring, and have left only a little muddy water,
like that in our street-gutters; but the goats must have this, or none
at all.

And now Abdel Hassan springs upon his beautiful black horse, that has
such slender legs and swift feet, and places himself at the head of
this long troop of men and women, camels and goats. The women are
riding upon the camels, and so are the children; while the servants
and camel-drivers walk barefooted over the yellow sand.

It would seem very strange to you to be perched up so high on a
camel's back, but Gemila is quite accustomed to it. When she was very
little, her mother often hung a basket beside her on the camel, and
carried her baby in it; but now she is a great girl, full six years
old, and when the camel kneels, and her mother takes her place, the
child can spring on in front, with one hand upon the camel's rough
hump, and ride safely and pleasantly hour after hour. Good, patient
camels! God has fitted them exactly to be of the utmost help to the
people in that desert country. Gemila for this often blesses and
thanks Him whom she calls Allah.

All this morning they ride,--first in the bright starlight; but soon
the stars become faint and dim in the stronger rosy light that is
spreading over the whole sky, and suddenly the little girl sees
stretching far before her the long shadow of the camels, and she knows
that the sun is up, for we never see shadows when the sun is not up,
unless it is by candlelight or moonlight. The shadows stretch out very
far before them, for the sun is behind. When you are out walking very
early in the morning, with the sun behind you, see how the shadow of
even such a little girl as you will reach across the whole street; and
you can imagine that such great creatures as camels would make even
much longer shadows.

Gemila watches them, and sees, too, how the white patches of sand
flush in the morning light; and she looks back where far behind are
the tops of their palm-trees, like great tufted fans, standing dark
against the yellow sky.

She is not sorry to leave that old home. She has had many homes
already, young as she is, and will have many more as long as she
lives. The whole desert is her home; it is very wide and large, and
sometimes she lives in one part, sometimes in another.

As the sun gets higher, it begins to grow very hot. The father
arranges the folds of his great white turban, a shawl with many folds,
twisted round his head to keep off the oppressive heat. The servants
put on their white fringed handkerchiefs, falling over the head and
down upon the neck, and held in place by a little cord tied, round the
head. It is not like a bonnet or hat, but one of the very best things
to protect the desert travellers from the sun. The children, too,
cover their heads in the same way, and Gemila no longer looks out to
see what is passing: the sun is too bright; it would hurt her eyes and
make her head ache. She shuts her eyes and falls half asleep, sitting
there high upon the camel's back. But, if she could look out, there
would be nothing to see but what she has seen many and many times
before,--great plains of sand or pebbles, and sometimes high, bare
rocks,--not a tree to be seen, and far off against the sky, the low
purple hills. They move on in the heat, and are all silent. It is
almost noon now, and Abdel Hassan stops, leaps from his horse, and
strikes his spear into the ground. The camel-drivers stop, the
camels stop and kneel, Gemila and Alee and their mother dismount. The
servants build up again the tent which they took down in the morning;
and, after drinking water from the leathern bags, the family are soon
under its shelter, asleep on their mats, while the camels and servants
have crept into the shadow of some rocks and lain down in the sand.
The beautiful black horse is in the tent with his master; he is
treated like a child, petted and fed by all the family, caressed and
kissed by the children. Here they rest until the heat of the day is
past; but before sunset they have eaten their dates and bread, loaded
again the camels, and are moving, with the beautiful black horse and
his rider at the head.

They ride until the stars are out, and after, but stop for a few
hours' rest in the night, to begin the next day as they began this.
Gemila still rides upon the camel, and I can easily understand that
she prays to Allah with a full heart under the shining stars so clear
and far, and that at the call to prayer in the early dawn her pretty
little veiled head is bent in true love and worship. But I must tell
you what she sees soon after sunrise on this second morning. Across
the sand, a long way before them, something with very long legs is
running, almost flying. She knows well what it is, for she has often
seen them before, and she calls to one of the servants, "See, there is
the ostrich!" and she claps her hands with delight.

The ostrich is a great bird, with very long legs and small wings; and
as legs are to run with, and wings to fly with, of course he can run
better than he can fly. But he spreads his short wings while running,
and they are like little sails, and help him along quite wonderfully,
so that he runs much faster than any horse can.

Although he runs so swiftly, he is sometimes caught in a very odd way.
I will tell you how.

He is a large bird, but he is a very silly one, and, when he is tired
of running, he will hide his head in the sand, thinking that because
he can see no one he can't be seen himself. Then the swift-footed Arab
horses can overtake him, and the men can get his beautiful feathers,
which you must have often seen, for ladies wear them in their bonnets.

All this about the ostrich. Don't forget it, my little girl: some time
you may see one, and will be glad that you know what kind of a fellow
he is.

The ostrich which Gemila sees is too far away to be caught; besides,
it will not be best to turn aside from the track which is leading
them to a new spring. But one of the men trots forward on his camel,
looking to this side and to that as he rides; and at last our little
girl, who is watching, sees his camel kneel, and sees him jump off
and stoop in the sand. When they reach the place, they find a sort of
great nest, hollowed a little in the sand, and in it are great eggs,
almost as big as your head. The mother ostrich has left them there.
She is not like other mother-birds, that sit upon the eggs to keep
them warm; but she leaves them in the hot sand, and the sun keeps them
warm, and by and by the little ostriches will begin to chip the shell,
and creep out into the great world.

The ostrich eggs are good to eat. You eat your one egg for breakfast,
but one of these big eggs will make breakfast for the whole family.
And that is why Gemila clapped her hands when she saw the ostrich: she
thought the men would find the nest, and have fresh eggs for a day or
two.

This day passes like the last: they meet no one, not a single man or
woman, and they move steadily on towards the sunset. In the morning
again they are up and away under the starlight; and this day is a
happy one for the children, and, indeed, for all.

The morning star is yet shining, low, large, and bright, when our
watchful little girl's dark eyes can see a row of black dots on the
sand,--so small you might think them nothing but flies; but Gemila
knows better. They only look small because they are far away; they are
really men and camels, and horses too, as she will soon see when
they come nearer. A whole troop of them; as many as a hundred camels,
loaded with great packages of cloths and shawls for turbans, carpets
and rich spices, and the beautiful red and green morocco, of which,
when I was a little girl, we sometimes had shoes made, but we see it
oftener now on the covers of books.

All these things belong to the Sheik Hassein. He has been to the great
cities to buy them, and now he is carrying them across the desert
to sell again. He himself rides at the head of his company on a
magnificent brown horse, and his dress is so grand and gay that it
shines in the morning light quite splendidly. A great shawl with
golden fringes is twisted about his head for a turban, and he wears,
instead of a coat, a tunic broadly striped with crimson and yellow,
while a loose-flowing scarlet robe falls from his shoulders. His face
is dark, and his eyes keen and bright; only a little of his straight
black hair hangs below the fringes of his turban, but his beard is
long and dark, and he really looks very magnificent sitting upon his
fine horse, in the full morning sunlight.

Abdel Hassan rides forward to meet him, and the children from behind
watch with great delight.

Abdel Hassan takes the hand of the sheik, presses it to his lips and
forehead, and says, "Peace be with you."

Do you see how different this is from the hand-shakings and
"How-do-you-do's" of the gentlemen whom we know? Many grand
compliments are offered from one to another, and they are very polite
and respectful. Our manners would seem very poor beside theirs.

Then follows a long talk, and the smoking of pipes, while the servants
make coffee, and serve it in little cups.

Hassein tells Abdel Hassan of the wells of fresh water which he left
but one day's journey behind him, and he tells of the rich cities he
has visited. Abdel Hassan gives him dates and salt in exchange for
cloth for a turban, and a brown cotton dress for his little daughter.

It is not often that one meets men in the desert, and this day will
long be remembered by the children.

The next night, before sunset, they can see the green feathery tops of
the palm-trees before them. The palms have no branches, but only great
clusters of fern-like leaves at the top of the tree, under which grow
the sweet dates.

Near those palm-trees will be Gemila's home for a little while, for
here they will find grass and a spring. The camels smell the water,
and begin to trot fast; the goats leap along over the sand, and the
barefooted men hasten to keep up with them.

In an hour more the tent is pitched under the palm-trees, and all have
refreshed themselves with the cool, clear water.

And now I must tell you that the camels have had nothing to drink
since they left the old home. The camel has a deep bag below his
throat, which he fills with water enough to last four or five days;
so he can travel in the desert as long as that, and sometimes longer,
without drinking again. Yet I believe the camels are as glad as the
children to come to the fresh spring.

Gemila thinks so at night, as she stands under the starlight, patting
her good camel Simel, and kissing his great lips.

The black goats, with long silky ears, are already cropping the grass.
The father sits again at the tent-door, and smokes his long pipe; the
children bury their bare feet in the sand, and heap it into little
mounds about them; while the mother is bringing out the dates and the
bread and butter.

It is an easy thing for them to move: they are already at home again.
But although they have so few cares, we do not wish ourselves in their
place, for we love the home of our childhood, "be it ever so humble,"
better than roaming like an exile.

But all the time I haven't told you how Gemila looks, nor what clothes
she wears. Her face is dark; she has a little straight nose, full
lips, and dark, earnest eyes; her dark hair will be braided when it
is long enough. On her arms and her ankles are gilded bracelets and
anklets, and she wears a brown cotton dress loosely hanging halfway to
the bare, slender ankles. On her head the white fringed handkerchief,
of which I told you, hangs like a little veil. Her face is pleasant,
and when she smiles her white teeth shine between her parted lips.

She is the child of the desert, and she loves her desert home.

I think she would hardly be happy to live in a house, eat from a
table, and sleep in a little bed like yours. She would grow restless
and weary if she should live so long and so quietly in one place.





I want you to look at the picture on this page. It is a little deer:
its name is the chamois. Do you see what delicate horns it has, and
what slender legs, and how it seems to stand on that bit of rock and
lift its head to watch for the hunters.

Last summer I saw a little chamois like that, and just as small: it
was not alive, but cut or carved of wood,--such a graceful pretty
little plaything as one does not meet every day.

Would you like to know who made it, and where it came from?

It was made in the mountain country, by the brother of my good
Jeannette, the little Swiss maiden.

Here among the high mountains she lives with her father, mother, and
brothers; and far up among those high snowy peaks, which are seen
behind the house, the chamois live, many of them together, eating
the tender grass and little pink-colored flowers, and leaping and
springing away over the ice and snow when they see the men coming up
to hunt them.

I will tell you by and by how it happened that Jeannette's tall
brother Joseph carved this tiny chamois from wood. But first you must
know about this small house upon the great hills, and how they live up
there so near the blue sky.

One would think it might be easier for a child to be good and pure so
far up among the quiet hills, and that there God would seem to come
close to the spirit, even of a little girl or boy.

On the sides of the mountains tall trees are growing,--pine and fir
trees, which are green in winter as well as in summer. If you go into
the woods in winter, you will find that almost all the trees have
dropped their pretty green leaves upon the ground, and are standing
cold and naked in the winter wind; but the pines and the firs keep on
their warm green clothes all the year round.

It was many years ago, before Jeannette was born, that her father
came to the mountains with his sharp axe and cut down some of the
fir-trees. Other men helped him, and they cut the great trees into
strong logs and boards, and built of them the house of which I have
told you. Now he will have a good home of his own for as long as he
likes to live there, and to it will come his wife and children as God
shall send them, to nestle among the hills.

Then he went down to the little town at the foot of the mountain, and
when he came back, he was leading a brown, long-eared donkey, and upon
that donkey sat a rosy-cheeked young woman, with smiling brown eyes,
and long braids of brown hair hanging below a little green hat set on
one side of her head, while beautiful rose-colored carnations peeped
from beneath it on the other side. Who was this? It wasn't Jeannette:
you know I told you this was before she was born. Can you guess, or
must I tell you that it was the little girl's mother? She had come up
the mountain for the first time to her new home,--the house built of
the fir and the pine,--where after awhile were born Jeannette's two
tall brothers, and at last Jeannette herself.

It was a good place to be born in. When she was a baby she used to lie
on the short, sweet grass before the doorstep, and watch the cows
and the goats feeding, and clap her little hands to see how rosy the
sunset made the snow that shone on the tops of those high peaks. And
the next summer, when she could run alone, she picked the blue-eyed
gentians, thrusting her small fingers between their fringed eyelids,
and begging them to open and look at little Jean; and she stained her
wee hands among the strawberries, and pricked them with the thorns
of the long raspberry-vines, when she went with her mother in the
afternoon to pick the sweet fruit for supper. Ah, she was a happy
little thing! Many a fall she got over the stones or among the brown
moss, and many a time the clean frock that she wore was dyed red with
the crushed berries; but, oh, how pleasant it was to find them in
great patches on the mountain-side, where the kind sun had warmed them
into such delicious life! I have seen the children run out of school
to pick such sweet wild strawberries, all the recess-time, up in the
fields of Maine; and how happy they were with their little stained
fingers as they came back at the call of the bell!

In the black bog-mud grew the Alpen roses, and her mother said, "Do
not go there, my little daughter, it is too muddy for you." But at
night, when her brother came home from the chamois hunt, he took off
his tall, pointed hat, and showed his little sister the long spray of
roses twisted round it, which he had brought for her. He could go in
the mud with his thick boots, you know, and never mind it.

Here they live alone upon the mountain; there are no near neighbors.
At evening they can see the blue smoke curling from the chimney of one
house that stands behind that sunny green slope, a hundred yards from
their door, and they can always look down upon the many houses of the
town below, where the mother lived when she was young.

Many times has Jeannette wondered how the people lived down there,--so
many together; and where their cows could feed, and whether there were
any little girls like herself, and if they picked berries, and had
such a dear old black nanny-goat as hers, that gave milk for her
supper, and now had two little black kids, its babies. She didn't know
about those little children in Maine, and that they have little
kids and goats, as well as sweet red berries, to make the days pass
happily.

She wanted to go down and see, some day, and her father promised that,
when she was a great girl, she should go down with him on market-days,
to sell the goats'-milk cheeses and the sweet butter that her mother
made.

When the cows and goats have eaten all the grass near the house, her
father drives them before him up farther among the mountains, where
more grass is growing, and there he stays with them many weeks: he
does not even come home at night, but sleeps in a small hut among the
rocks, where, too, he keeps the large clean milk-pails, and the little
one-legged stool upon which he sits at morning and night to milk the
cows and goats.

When the pails are full, the butter is to be made, and the cheese; and
he works while the animals feed. The cows have little bells tied to
their necks, that he may hear and find them should they stray too far.

Many times, when he is away, does his little daughter at home listen,
listen, while she sits before the door, to hear the distant tinkling
of the cow-bells. She is a loving little daughter, and she thinks of
her father so far away alone, and wishes he was coming home to eat
some of the sweet strawberries and cream for supper.

Last summer some travellers came to the house. They stopped at the
door and asked for milk; the mother brought them brimming bowlsful,
and the shy little girl crept up behind her mother with her birch-bark
baskets of berries. The gentlemen took them and thanked her, and one
told of his own little Mary at home, far away over the great sea.
Jeannette often thinks of her, and wonders whether her papa has gone
home to her.

While the gentlemen talked, Jeannette's brother Joseph sat upon the
broad stone doorstep and listened. Presently one gentleman, turning
to him, asked if he would come with them over the mountain to lead the
way, for there are many wild places and high, steep rocks, and they
feared to get lost.

Joseph sprang up from his low seat and said he would go, brought his
tall hat and his mountain-staff, like a long, strong cane, with a
sharp iron at the end, which he can stick into the snow or ice if
there is danger of slipping; and they went merrily on their way, over
the green grass, over the rocks, far up among the snow and ice, and
the frozen streams and rivers that pour down the mountain-sides.

Joseph was brave and gay; he led the way, singing aloud until the
echoes answered from every hillside. It makes one happy to sing, and
when we are busy and happy we sing without thinking of it, as the
birds do. When everything is bright and beautiful in nature around
us, we feel like singing aloud and praising God, who made the earth so
beautiful; then the earth also seems to sing of God who made it,
and the echo seems like its answer of praise. Did you ever hear the
echo,--the voice that seems to come from a hill or a house far away,
repeating whatever you may say? Among the mountains the echoes answer
each other again and again. Jeannette has often heard them.

That night, while the mother and her little girl were eating their
supper, the gentlemen came back again, bringing Joseph with them. He
could not walk now, nor spring from rock to rock with his Alpen staff;
he had fallen and broken his leg, and he must lie still for many days.
But he could keep a cheerful face, and still sing his merry songs; and
as he grew better, and could sit out again on the broad bench beside
the door, he took his knife and pieces of fine wood, and carved
beautiful things,--first a spoon for his little sister, with gentians
on the handle; then a nice bowl, with a pretty strawberry-vine carved
all about the edge. And from this bowl, and with this spoon, she ate
her supper every night,--sweet milk, with the dry cakes of rye bread
broken into it, and sometimes the red strawberries. I know his little
sister loved him dearly, and thanked him in her heart every time she
used the pretty things. How dearly a sister and brother can love each
other!

Then he made other things,--knives, forks, and plates; and at last
one day he sharpened his knife very sharp, chose a very nice, delicate
piece of wood, and carved this beautiful chamois, just like a living
one, only so small. My cousin, who was travelling there, bought it and
brought it home.

When the summer had passed, the father came down from the high
pastures; the butter and cheese making was over, and the autumn work
was now to be done. Do you want to know what the autumn work was, and
how Jeannette could help about it? I will tell you. You must know that
a little way down the mountain-side is a grove of chestnut-trees. Did
you ever see the chestnut-trees? They grow in our woods, and on
the shores of some ponds. In the spring they are covered with long,
yellowish blossoms, and all through the hot summer those blossoms are
at work, turning into sweet chestnuts, wrapped safely in round, thorny
balls, which will prick your fingers sadly if you don't take care. But
when the frost of the autumn nights comes, it cracks open the prickly
ball and shows a shining brown nut inside; then, if we are careful,
we may pull off the covering and take out the nut. Sometimes, indeed,
there are two, three, or four nuts in one shell; I have found them so
myself.

Now the autumn work, which I said I would tell you about, is to gather
these chestnuts and store them away,--some to be eaten, boiled or
roasted, by the bright fire in the cold winter days that are coming;
and some to be nicely packed in great bags, and carried on the donkey
down to the town to be sold. The boys of New England, too, know what
good fun it is to gather nuts in the fall, and spread them over the
garret floor to dry, and at last to crack and eat them by the winter
hearth. So when the father says one night at supper-time, "It is
growing cold; I think there will be a frost to-night," Jeannette knows
very well what to do; and she dances away right early in the evening
to her little bed, which is made in a wooden box built up against the
side of the wall, and falls asleep to dream about the chestnut woods,
and the squirrels, and the little brook that leaps and springs from
rock to rock down under the tall, dark trees.

She has gone to bed early, that she may wake with the first daylight,
and she is out of bed in a minute when she hears her father's cheerful
call in the morning, "Come, children, it is time to be off."

Their dinner is packed in a large basket. The donkey stands ready
before the door, with great empty bags hanging at each side, and they
go merrily over the crisp white frost to the chestnut-trees. How the
frost has opened the burrs! He has done more than half their work for
them already. How they laugh and sing and shout to each other as they
gather the smooth brown nuts, filling their baskets, and running to
pour them into the great bags! It is merry autumn work. The sun looks
down upon them through the yellow leaves, and the rocks give them
mossy seats; while here and there comes a bird or a squirrel to see
what these strange people are doing in their woods.

Jeannette declares that the chestnut days are the best in the year.
Perhaps she is right. I am sure I should enjoy them, shouldn't you?
She really helps, although she is but a little girl, and her father
says at night that his little Jean is a dear, good child. It makes
her very happy. She thinks of what he has said while she undresses at
night, unbraiding her hair and unlacing her little blue bodice with
its great white sleeves, and she goes peacefully to sleep, to dream
again of the merry autumn days. And while she dreams good angels must
be near her, for she said her sweet and reverent prayer on her knees,
with a full and thankful heart to the All-Father who gave her so many
blessings.

She is our little mountain sister. The mountain life is a fresh and
happy one. I should like to stay with this little sister a long, long
time.






Dear children, have you ever watched the sun set? If you live in the
country, I am almost sure you have many times delighted yourselves
with the gold and rosy clouds. But those of you who live in the city
do not often have the opportunity, the high houses and narrow streets
shut out so much of the sky.

I am so happy as to live in the country; and let me tell you where I
go to see the sun set.

The house in which I live has some dark, narrow garret stairs leading
from the third story into a small garret under the roof, and many
and many a time do I go up these narrow stairs, and again up to the
scuttle-window in the roof, open it, and seat myself on the top step
or on the roof itself. Here I can look over the house-tops, and even
over the tree-tops, seeing many things of which I may perhaps tell you
at some time; but to-night we are to look at the sunset.

Can you play that you are up here with me, looking past the houses,
past the elm-trees and the low hills that seem so far away, to where
the sun hangs low, like a great red ball, so bright that we can hardly
look at it? Watch it with me. Now a little part has disappeared; now
it is half gone, and in a minute more we see nothing but the train of
bright clouds it has left behind.

Where did it go?

It seemed to slip down over the edge of the world. To-morrow morning,
if you are up early, you will see it come back again on the other
side. As it goes away from us to-night, it is coming to somebody who
lives far away, round the other side of the world. While we had the
sunshine, she had night; and now, when night is coming to us, it is
morning for her.

I think men have always felt like following the sun to the unknown
West, beyond its golden gate of setting day, and perhaps that has led
many a wanderer on his path of discovery. Let us follow the sun over
the rolling earth.

The sun has gone; shall we go, too, and take a peep round there to see
who is having morning now?

The long, bright sunbeams are sliding over the tossing ocean, and
sparkling on the blue water of a river upon which are hundreds of
boats. The boats are not like those which we see here, with white
sails or long oars. They are clumsy, square-looking things, without
sails, and they have little sheds or houses built upon them. We will
look into one, and see what is to be seen.

There is something like a little yard built all around this boat;
in it are ducks,--more ducks than you can well count. This is their
bedroom, where they sleep at night; but now it is morning, and they
are all stirring,--waddling about as well as they can in the crowd,
and quacking with most noisy voices. They are waking up Kang-hy, their
master, who lives in the middle of the boat; and out he comes from the
door of his odd house, and out comes little Pen-se, his daughter, who
likes to see the ducks go for their breakfast.

The father opens a gate or door in the basket-work fence of the ducks'
house, and they all crowd and hurry to reach the water again, after
staying all night shut up in this cage. There they go, tumbling and
diving. Each must have a thorough bath first of all; then the old
drake leads the way, and they swim off in the bright water along the
shore for a hundred yards, and then among the marshes, where they will
feed all day, and come back at night when they hear the shrill whistle
of Kang-hy calling them to come home and go to bed.

Pen-se and her father will go in to breakfast now, under the bamboo
roof which slides over the middle part of the boat, or can be pushed
back if they desire. As Kang-hy turns to go in, and takes off his
bamboo hat, the sun shines on his bare, shaved head, where only one
lock of hair is left; that is braided into a long, thick tail, and
hangs far down his back. He is very proud of it, and nothing would
induce him to have it cut off. Now it hangs down over his loose blue
nankeen jacket, but when he goes to work he will twist it round upon
the crown of his head, and tuck the end under the coil to keep it out
of the way. Isn't this a funny way for a man to wear his hair? Pen-se
has hers still in little soft curls, but by and by it will be braided,
and at last fastened up into a high knot on the top of her head, as
her mother's is. Her little brother Lin already has his head shaved
almost bare, and waits impatiently for the time when his single lock
of hair will be long enough to braid.

When I was a child it was a very rare thing to see people such as
these in our own land, but now we are quite familiar with these odd
ways of dressing, and our streets have many of these funny names on
their signs.

Shall we look in to see them at breakfast? Tea for the children as
well as for the father and mother. They have no milk, and do not like
to drink water, so they take many cups of tea every day. And here,
too, are their bowls of rice upon the table, but no spoons or forks
with which to eat it. Pen-se, however, does not need spoon or fork;
she takes two small, smooth sticks, and, lifting the bowl to her
mouth, uses the sticks like a little shovel. You would spill the rice
and soil your dress if you should try to do so, but these children
know no other way, and they have learned to do it quite carefully.

The sticks are called chopsticks; and up in the great house on the
hill, where Pen-se went to carry fish, lives a little lady who has
beautiful pearl chopsticks, and wears roses in her hair. Pen-se often
thinks of her, and wishes she might go again to carry the fish, and
see some of the beautiful things in that garden with the high walls.
Perhaps you have in your own house, or in your schoolroom, pictures of
some of the pretty things that may have been there,--little children
and ladies dressed in flowery gowns, with fans in their hands;
tea-tables and pretty dishes, and a great many lovely flowers and
beautiful birds.

But now she must not stop to think. Breakfast is over, and the father
must go on shore to his work,--carrying tea-boxes to the store of a
great merchant. Lin, too, goes to his work, of which I will by and by
tell you; and even Pen-se and her little sister, young as they are,
must go with their mother, who has a tanka-boat in which she carries
fresh fruit and vegetables, to the big ships which are lying off
shore. The two little girls can help at the oars, while the mother
steers to guide the boat.

I wish I could tell you how pleasant it is out on the river this
bright morning. A hundred boats are moving; the ducks and geese
have all gone up the stream; the people who live in the boats have
breakfasted, and the fishermen have come out to their work. This
is Lin's work. He works with his uncle Chow, and already his blue
trousers are stripped above his knees, and he stands on the wet
fishing-raft watching some brown birds. Suddenly one of them plunges
into the water and brings up a fish in its yellow bill. Lin takes it
out and sends the bird for another; and such industrious fishermen
are the brown cormorants that they keep Lin and his uncle busy all the
morning, until the two large baskets are filled with fish, and then
the cormorants may catch for themselves. Lin brings his bamboo pole,
rests it across his shoulders, hangs one basket on each end, and goes
up into the town to sell his fish. Here it was that Pen-se went on
that happy day when she saw the little lady in the house on the hill,
and she has not forgotten the wonders of that day in the streets.

The gay sign-posts in front of the shops, with colors flying; the busy
workmen,--tinkers mending or making their wares; blacksmiths with all
their tools set up at the corners of the streets; barbers with
grave faces, intently braiding the long hair of their customers;
water-carriers with deep water-buckets hung from a bamboo pole like
Lin's fish-baskets; the soldiers in their paper helmets, wadded gowns,
and quilted petticoats, with long, clumsy guns over their shoulders;
and learned scholars in brown gowns, blue bordered, and golden birds
on their caps. The high officers, cousins to the emperor, have the
sacred yellow girdle round their waists, and very long braided tails
hanging below their small caps. Here and there you may see a high,
narrow box, resting on poles, carried by two men. It is the only kind
of carriage which you will see in these streets, and in it is a lady
going out to take the air; although I am sadly afraid she gets but
little, shut up there in her box. I would rather be like Pen-se, a
poor, hardworking little girl, with a fresh life on the river, and a
hard mat spread for her bed in the boat at night. How would you like
to live in a boat on a pleasant river with the ducks and geese? I
think you would have a very jolly time, rocked to sleep by the tide,
and watched over by the dancing boat-lights. But this poor lady
couldn't walk, or enjoy much, if she were allowed. Shall I tell you
why? When she was a very little girl, smaller than you are, smaller
than Pen-se is now, her soft baby feet were bound up tightly, the toes
turned and pressed under, and the poor little foot cramped so that
she could scarcely stand. This was done that her feet might never
grow large, for in this country on the other side of the world one is
considered very beautiful who has small feet; and now that she is a
grown lady, as old perhaps as your mamma, she wears such little shoes
you would think them too small for yourself. It is true they are very
pretty shoes, made of bright-colored satin, and worked all over
with gold and silver thread, and they have beautiful white soles of
rice-paper; and the poor lady looks down at them and says to herself
proudly, "Only three inches long." And forgetting how much the
bandages pained her, and not thinking how sad it is only to be able
to hobble about a little, instead of running and leaping as children
should, she binds up the feet of Lou, her dear little daughter, in the
great house on the hill, and makes her a poor, helpless child; not
so happy, with all her flower-gardens, gold and silver fish, and
beautiful gold-feathered birds, as Pen-se with her broad, bare feet,
and comfortable, fat little toes, as she stands in the wet tanka-boat,
helping her mother wash it with river-water, while the leather shoes
of both of them lie high and dry on the edge of the wharf, until the
wet work is done.

But we are forgetting Lin, who has carried his fish up into the town
to sell. Here is a whole street where nothing is sold but food. I
should call it Market Street, and I dare say they do the same in a way
of their own.

What will all these busy people have for dinner to-day? Fat
bears'-paws, brought from the dark forest fifty miles away,--these
will do for that comfortable-looking mandarin with the red ball on
the top of his cap. I think he has eaten something of the same kind
before. A birds'-nest soup for my lady in the great house on the hill;
birds' nests brought from the rocks where the waves dash, and the
birds feel themselves very safe. But "Such a delicious soup!" said
Madam Faw-Choo, and Yang-lo, her son, sent the fisherman again to the
black rocks for more.

What will the soldiers have,--the officer who wears thick satin boots,
and doesn't look much like fighting in his gay silk dress? A stew of
fat puppies for him, and only boiled rats for the porter who carries
the heavy tea-boxes. But there is tea for all, and rice, too, as much
as they desire; and, although I shouldn't care to be invited to dine
with any of them, I don't doubt they enjoy the food very much.

In the midst of all this buying and selling Lin sells his fish, some
to the English gentleman, and some to the grave-faced man in the blue
gown; and he goes happily home to his own dinner in the boat. Rice
again, and fried mice, and the merry face and small, slanting black
eyes of his little sister to greet him. After dinner his father has
a pipe to smoke, before he goes again to his work. After all, why not
eat puppies and mice as well as calves and turtles and oysters? And as
for birds'-nest soup, I should think it quite as good as chicken pie.
It is only custom that makes any difference.

So pass the days of our child Pen-se, who lives on the great river
which men call the child of the ocean. But it was not always so.
She was born among the hills where the tea grows with its glossy,
myrtle-like leaves, and white, fragrant blossoms. When the tea-plants
were in bloom, Pen-se first saw the light; and when she was hardly
more than a baby she trotted behind her father, while he gathered the
leaves, dried and rolled them, and then packed them in square boxes to
come in ships across the ocean for your papa and mine to drink.

Here, too, grew the mulberry-trees, with their purple fruit and white;
and Pen-se learned to know and to love the little worms that eat the
mulberry-leaves, and then spin for themselves a silken shell, and fall
into a long sleep inside of it. She watched her mother spin off the
fine silk and make it into neat skeins, and once she rode on her
mother's back to market to sell it. You could gather mulberry-leaves,
and set up these little silkworm boxes on the windowsill of your
schoolroom. I have seen silk and flax and cotton all growing in a
pleasant schoolroom, to show the scholars of what linen and silk and
cotton are made.

Now those days are all past. She can hardly remember them, she was so
little then; and she has learned to be happy in her new home on the
river, where they came when the fire burned their house, and the
tea-plants and the mulberry-trees were taken by other men.

Sometimes at night, after the day's work is over, the ducks have
come home, and the stars have come out, she sits at the door of the
boat-house, and watches the great bright fireflies over the marshes,
and thinks of the blue lake Syhoo, covered with lilies, where gilded
boats are sailing, and the people seem so happy.

Up in the high-walled garden of the great house on the hill, the
night-moths have spread their broad, soft wings, and are flitting
among the flowers, and the little girl with the small feet lies on her
silken bed, half asleep. She, too, thinks of the lake and the lilies,
but she knows nothing about Pen-se, who lives down upon the river.

See, the sun has gone from them. It must be morning for us now.






In this part of the world, Manenko would certainly be considered
a very wild little girl. I wonder how you would enjoy her for a
playmate. She has never been to school, although she is more than
seven years old, and doesn't know how to read, or even to tell her
letters; she has never seen a book but once, and she has never learned
to sew or to knit.

If you should try to play at paper dolls with her, she would make very
funny work with the dresses, I assure you. Since she never wore a gown
or bonnet or shoes herself, how should she know how to put them on to
the doll? But, if she had a doll like herself, I am sure she would
be as fond of it as you are of yours; and it would be a very cunning
little dolly, I should think. Perhaps you have one that looks somewhat
like this little girl in the picture.

Now I will tell you of some things which she can do.

She can paddle the small canoe on the river; she can help to hoe the
young corn, and can find the wild bees' honey in the woods, gather the
scarlet fruit when it is fully ripe and falls from the trees, and help
her mother to pound the corn in the great wooden mortar. All this, and
much more, as you will see, Manenko can do; for every little girl on
the round world can help her mother, and do many useful things.

Would you like to know more of her,--how she looks, and where she
lives, and what she does all day and all night?

Here is a little round house, with low doorways, most like those of a
dog's house; you see we should have to stoop in going in. Look at the
round, pointed roof, made of the long rushes that grow by the river,
and braided together firmly with strips of mimosa-bark; fine, soft
grass is spread all over this roof to keep out the rain.

If you look on the roof of the house across the street you will see
that it is covered with strips of wood called shingles, which are laid
one over the edge of the other; and when it is a rainy day you can see
how the rain slips and slides off from these shingles, and runs and
drips away from the spout.

Now, on this little house where Manenko lives there are no shingles,
but the smooth, slippery grass is almost as good; and the rain slides
over it and drips away, hardly ever coming in to wet the people
inside, or the hard beds made of rushes, like the roof, and spread
upon the floor of earth.

In this house lives Manenko, with Maunka her mother, Sekomi her
father, and Zungo and Shobo her two brothers.

They are all very dark, darker than the brown baby. I believe you
would call them black, but they are not really quite so. Their lips
are thick, their noses broad, and instead of hair, their heads are
covered with wool, such as you might see on a black sheep. This wool
is braided and twisted into little knots and strings all over their
heads, and bound with bits of red string, or any gay-looking thread.
They think it looks beautiful, but I am afraid we should not agree
with them.

Now we will see what clothes they wear.

You remember Agoonack, who wore the white bear's-skin, because she
lived in the very cold country; and the little brown baby, who wore
nothing but a string of beads, because she lived in the warm country.
Manenko, too, lives in a warm country, and wears no clothes; but on
her arms and ankles are bracelets and anklets, with little bits of
copper and iron hanging to them, which tinkle as she walks; and she
also, like the brown baby, has beads for her neck.

Her father and mother, and Zungo her brother, have aprons and mantles
of antelope skins; and they, too, wear bracelets and anklets like
hers.

Little Shobo is quite a baby and runs in the sunshine, like his little
sister, without clothes. Dear little Shobo! how funny and happy he
must look, and how fond he must be of his little sister, and our
little sister, Manenko! We have all seen such little dark brothers
and sisters. His short, soft wool is not yet braided or twisted, but
crisps in little close curls all over his head.

In the morning they must be up early, for the father is going to hunt,
and Zungo will go with him. The mother prepares the breakfast, small
cakes of bread made from the pounded corn, scarlet beans, eaten with
honey, and plenty of milk from the brown cow. She brings it in a deep
jug, and they dip in their hands for spoons.

All the meat is eaten, and to-day the men must go out over the broad,
grassy fields for more. They will find the beautiful young antelope,
so timid and gentle as to be far more afraid of you than you would be
of them. They are somewhat like small deer, striped and spotted, and
they have large, dark eyes, so soft and earnest you cannot help loving
them. Here, too, are the buffalo, like large cows and oxen with strong
horns, and the great elephants with long trunks and tusks. Sometimes
even a lion is to be met, roused from his sleep by the noise of the
hunters; for the lion sleeps in the daytime and generally walks abroad
only at night. When you are older you can read the stories of famous
lion and elephant hunters, and of strange and thrilling adventures in
the "Dark Continent."

It would be a wonderful thing to you and me to see all these strange
or beautiful animals, but Zungo and his father have seen them so many
times that they are thinking only of the meat they will bring home,
and, taking their long spears and the basket of ground nuts and meal
which the mother has made ready, they are off with other hunters
before the sun is up.

Now the mother takes her hoe, and, calling her little girl to help,
hoes the young corn which is growing on the round hill behind the
house. I must tell you something about the little hill. It looks like
any other hill, you would think, and could hardly believe that there
is anything very wonderful to tell about it. But listen to me.

A great many years ago there was no hill there at all, and the ground
was covered with small white ants. You have seen the little ant-houses
many a time on the garden-path, and all the ants at work, carrying
grains of sand in their mouths, and running this way and that, as if
they were busy in the most important work. Oh, the little ants are
very wise! They seem to know how to contrive great things and are
never idle. "Go to the ant; consider her ways, and be wise," said one
of the world's wisest men.

Well, on the spot where this hill now stands the white ants began to
work. They were not satisfied with small houses like those which we
have seen, but they worked day after day, week after week, and even
years, until they had built this hill higher than the house in which
I live, and inside it is full of chambers and halls, and wonderful
arched passages. They built this great house, but they do not live
there now. I don't know why they moved,--perhaps because they didn't
like the idea of having such near neighbors when Sekomi began to
build his hut before their door. But, however it was, they went, and,
patient little creatures that they are, built another just like it a
mile or so away; and Sekomi said: "The hill is a fine place to plant
my early corn."

There is but little hoeing to do this morning, and, while the work
goes on, Shobo, the baby, rolls in the grass, sucking a piece of
sugar-cane, as I have seen children suck a stick of candy. Haven't
you?

The mother has baskets to make. On the floor of the hut is a heap of
fine, twisting tree-roots which she brought from the forest yesterday,
and under the shadow of her grassy roof she sits before the door
weaving them into strong, neat baskets, like the one in which the men
carried their dinner when they went to hunt. While she works other
women come too with their work, sit beside her in the shade, and
chatter away in a very queer-sounding language. We couldn't understand
it at all; but we should hear them always call Manenko's mother
Ma-Zungo, meaning Zungo's mother, instead of saying Maunka, which you
remember I told you is her name. Zungo is her oldest boy, you
know, and ever since he was born she has been called nothing but
Ma-Zungo,--just as if, when a lady comes into your school, the teacher
should say: "This is Joe's mother," or "This is Teddy's mamma," so
that the children should all know her.

So the mother works on the baskets and talks with the women; but
Manenko has heard the call of the honey-bird, the brisk little chirp
of "Chiken, chiken, chik, churr, churr," and she is away to the wood
to follow his call, and bring home the honey.

She runs beneath the tall trees, looking up for the small brown bird;
then she stops and listens to hear him again, when close beside her
comes the call, "Chiken, chiken, chik, churr, churr," and there sits
the brown bird above a hole in the tree, where the bees are flying in
and out, their legs yellow with honey-dust. It is too high for Manenko
to reach, but she marks the place and says to herself: "I will tell
Ra when he comes home." Who is Ra? Why, that is her name for "father."
She turns to go home, but stops to listen to the wild shouts and songs
of the women who have left the huts and are coming down towards the
river to welcome their chief with lulliloo, praising him by such
strange names as "Great lion," "Great buffalo."

The chief comes from a long journey with the young men up the river
in canoes, to hunt the elephant, and bring home the ivory tusks,
from which we have many beautiful things made. The canoes are full of
tusks, and, while the men unload them, the women are shouting: "Sleep,
my lord, my great chief." Manenko listens while she stands under the
trees,--listens for only a minute, and then runs to join her mother
and add her little voice to the general noise.

The chief is very proud and happy to bring home such a load; before
sunset it will all be carried up to the huts, the men will dress in
their very best, and walk in a gay procession. Indeed, they can't
dress much; no coats or hats or nicely polished boots have they to put
on, but some will have the white ends of oxen's tails in their hair,
some a plume of black ostrich feathers, and the chief himself has a
very grand cap made from the yellow mane of an old lion. The drum will
beat, the women will shout, while the men gather round a fire, and
roast and eat great slices of ox-meat, and tell the story of their
famous elephant-hunt. How they came to the bushes with fine, silvery
leaves and sweet bark, which the elephant eats, and there hiding,
watched and waited many hours, until the ground shook, with the heavy
tread of a great mother-elephant and her two calves, coming up from
the river, where they had been to drink. Their trunks were full
of water, and they tossed them up, spouting the water like a fine
shower-bath over their hot heads and backs, and now, cooled and
refreshed, began to eat the silvery leaves of the bushes. Then the
hunters threw their spears thick and fast; after two hours, the great
creature lay still upon the ground,--she was dead.

So day after day they had hunted, loading the canoes with ivory, and
sailing far up the river; far up where the tall rushes wave, twisted
together by the twining morning-glory vines; far up where the
alligators make great nests in the river-bank, and lay their eggs,
and stretch themselves in the sunshine, half asleep inside their scaly
armor; far up where the hippopotamus is standing in his drowsy dream
on the bottom of the river, with the water covering him, head and all.
He is a great, sleepy fellow, not unlike a very large, dark-brown pig,
with a thick skin and no hair. Here he lives under the water all day,
only once in a while poking up his nose for a breath of fresh air. And
here is the mother-hippopotamus, with her baby standing upon her neck,
that he may be nearer the top of the water. Think how funny he must
look.

All day long they stand here under the water, half asleep, sometimes
giving a loud grunt or snore, and sometimes, I am sorry to say,
tipping over a canoe which happens to float over their heads. But at
night, when men are asleep, the great beasts come up out of the river
and eat the short, sweet grass upon the shore, and look about to see
the world a little. Oh, what mighty beasts! Men are so small and weak
beside them. And yet, because the mind of man is so much above theirs,
he can rule them; for God made man to be king of the whole earth, and
greater than all.

All these wonderful things the men have seen, and Manenko listens to
their stories until the moon is high and the stars have almost faded
in her light. Then her father and Zungo come home, bringing the
antelope and buffalo meat, too tired to tell their story until the
next day. So, after eating supper, they are all soon asleep upon the
mats which form their beds. It is a hard kind of bed, but a good one,
if you don't have too many mice for bedfellows. A little bright-eyed
mouse is a pretty creature, but one doesn't care to sleep with him.

These are simple, happy people; they live out of doors most of the
time, and they love the sunshine, the rain, and the wind. They have
plenty to eat,--the pounded corn, milk and honey, and scarlet beans,
and the hunters bring meat, and soon it will be time for the wild
water-birds to come flocking down the river,--white pelicans and brown
ducks, and hundreds of smaller birds that chase the skimming flies
over the water.

If Manenko could read, she would be sorry that she has no books;
and if she knew what dolls are, she might be longing every day for a
beautiful wax doll, with curling hair, and eyes to open and shut. But
these are things of which she knows nothing at all, and she is happy
enough in watching the hornets building their hanging nests on the
branches of the trees, cutting the small sticks of sugar-cane, or
following the honey-bird's call.

If the children who have books would oftener leave them, and study
the wonders of the things about them,--of the birds, the plants, the
curious creatures that live and work on the land and in the air and
water,--it would be better for them. Try it, dear children; open your
eyes and look into the ways and forms of life in the midst of which
God has placed you, and get acquainted with them, till you feel that
they, too, are your brothers and sisters, and God your Father and
theirs.





Have you heard of the beautiful River Rhine--how at first it hides, a
little brook among the mountains and dark forests, and then steals out
into the sunshine, and leaps down the mountain-side, and hurries
away to the sea, growing larger and stronger as it runs, curling and
eddying among the rocks, and sweeping between the high hills where the
grape-vines grow and the solemn old castles stand?

How people come from far and near to see and to sail upon the
beautiful river! And the children who are so blessed as to be born
near it, and to play on its shores through all the happy young years
of their lives, although they may go far away from it in the after
years, never, never forget the dear and beautiful River Rhine.

It is only a few miles away from the Rhine--perhaps too far for you to
walk, but not too far for me--that we shall find a fine large house,
a house with pleasant gardens about it, broad gravel walks, and soft,
green grass-plats to play upon, and gay flowering trees and bushes,
while the rose-vines are climbing over the piazza, and opening
rose-buds are peeping in at the chamber windows.

Isn't this a pleasant house? I wish we could all live in as charming
a home, by as blue and lovely a river, and with as large and sweet
a garden, or, if we might have such a place for our school, how
delightful it would be!

Here lives Louise, my blue-eyed, sunny-haired little friend, and here
in the garden she plays with Fritz and sturdy little Gretchen. And
here, too, at evening the father and mother come to sit on the
piazza among the roses, and the children leave their games, to nestle
together on the steps while the dear brother Christian plays softly
and sweetly on his flute.

Louise is a motherly child, already eight years old, and always
willing and glad to take care of the younger ones; indeed, she calls
Gretchen _her_ baby, and the little one loves dearly her child-mamma.

They live in this great house, and they have plenty of toys and books,
and plenty of good food, and comfortable little beds to sleep in at
night, although, like Jeannette's, they are only neat little boxes
built against the side of the wall.

But near them, in the valley, live the poor people, in small, low
houses. They eat black bread, wear coarse clothes, and even the
children must work all day that they may have food for to-morrow.

The mother of Louise is a gentle, loving woman; she says to her
children: "Dear children, to-day we are rich, we can have all that
we want, but we will not forget the poor. You may some day be poor
yourselves, and, if you learn now what poverty is, you will be more
ready to meet it when it comes." So, day after day, the great stove
in the kitchen is covered with stew-pans and kettles, in which are
cooking dinners for the sick and the poor, and day after day, as the
dinner-hour draws near, Louise will come, and Fritz, and even little
Gretchen, saying: "Mother, may I go?" "May I go?" and the mother
answers: "Dear children, you shall all go together"; and she fills the
bowls and baskets, and sends her sunny-hearted children down into the
valley to old Hans the gardener, who has been lame with rheumatism so
many years; and to young Marie, the pale, thin girl, who was so merry
and rosy-cheeked in the vineyard a year ago; and to the old, old woman
with the brown, wrinkled face and bowed head, who sits always in the
sunshine before the door, and tries to knit; but the needles drop from
the poor trembling hands, and the stitches slip off, and she cannot
see to pick them up. She is too deaf to hear the children as they come
down the road, and she is nodding her poor old head, and feeling about
in her lap for the lost needle, when Louise, with her bright eyes,
spies it, picks it up, and before the old woman knows she has come,
a soft little hand is laid in the brown, wrinkled one, and the little
girl is shouting in her ear that she has brought some dinner from
mamma. It makes a smile shine in the old half-blind eyes. It is always
the happiest part of the day to her when the dear little lady comes
with her dinner. And it made Louise happy too, for nothing repays us
so well as what we do unselfishly for others.

These summer days are full of delight for the children. It is not all
play for them, to be sure; but then, work is often even more charming
than play, as I think some little girls know when they have been
helping their mothers,--running of errands, dusting the furniture,
and sewing little squares of patchwork that the baby may have a
cradle-quilt made entirely by her little sister.

Louise can knit, and, indeed, every child and woman in that country
knits. You would almost laugh to see how gravely the little girl takes
out her stocking, for she has really begun her first stocking, and
sits on the piazza-steps for an hour every morning at work. Then the
little garden, which she calls her own, must be weeded. The gardener
would gladly do it, but Louise has a hoe of her own, which her father
bought in the spring, and, bringing it to his little daughter, said:
"Let me see how well my little girl can take care of her own garden."
And the child has tried very hard; sometimes, it is true, she would
let the weeds grow pretty high before they were pulled up, but, on the
whole, the garden promises well, and there are buds on her moss-rose
bush. It is good to take care of a garden, for, besides the pleasure
the flowers can bring us, we learn how watchful we must be to root out
the weeds, and how much trimming and care the plants need; so we learn
how to watch over our own hearts.

She has books, too, and studies a little each day,--studies at home
with her mother, for there is no school near enough for her to go to
it, and while she and Fritz are so young, their mother teaches them,
while Christian, who is already more than twelve years old, has gone
to the school upon that beautiful hill which can be seen from Louise's
chamber window,--the school where a hundred boys and girls are
studying music. For, ever since he was a baby, Christian has loved
music; he has sung the very sweetest little songs to Louise, while she
was yet so young as to lie in her cradle, and he has whistled until
the birds among the bushes would answer him again, and now, when he
comes home from school to spend some long summer Sunday, he always
brings the flute, and plays, as I told you in the beginning of the
story.

When the summer days are over, what comes next? You do not surely
forget the autumn, when the leaves of the maples turn crimson and
yellow, and the oaks are red and brown, and you scuff your feet along
the path ankle-deep in fallen leaves!

On the banks of the Rhine the autumn is not quite like ours. You shall
see how our children of the great house will spend an autumn day.

Their father and mother have promised to go with them to the vineyards
as soon as the grapes are ripe enough for gathering, and on this sunny
September morning the time has really come.

In the great covered baskets are slices of bread and German sausage,
bottles of milk and of beer, and plenty of fresh and delicious prunes,
for the prune orchards are loaded with ripe fruit. This is their
dinner, for they will not be home until night.

Oh, what a charming day for the children! Little Gretchen is rolling
in the grass with delight, while Louise runs to bring her own little
basket, in which to gather grapes.

They must ride in the broad old family carriage, for the little ones
cannot walk so far; but, when they reach the river, they will take a
boat with white sails, and go down to where the steep steps and path
lead up on the other side, up the sunny green bank to the vineyard,
where already the peasant girls have been at work ever since sunrise.
Here the grapes are hanging in heavy, purple clusters; the sun has
warmed them through and through, and made them sweet to the very
heart. Oh, how delicious they are, and how beautiful they look, heaped
up in the tall baskets, which the girls and women are carrying on
their heads! How the children watch these peasant-girls, all dressed
in neat little jackets, and many short skirts one above another, red
and blue, white and green. On their heads are the baskets of grapes,
and they never drop nor spill them, but carry them steadily down the
steep, narrow path to the great vats, where the young men stand on
short ladders to reach the top, and pour in the purple fruit. Then
the grapes are crushed till the purple juice runs out, and that is
wine,--such wine as even the children may drink in their little silver
cups, for it is even better than milk. You may be sure that they have
some at dinner-time, when they cluster round the flat rock below the
dark stone castle, with the warm noonday sun streaming across their
mossy table, and the mother opens the basket and gives to every one a
share.

Below them is the river, with its boats and beautiful shining water;
behind them are the vine-covered walls of that old castle where two
hundred years ago lived armed knights and stately ladies; and all
about them is the rich September air, full of the sweet fragrance
of the grapes, and echoing with the songs and laughter of the
grape-gatherers. On their rocky table are purple bunches of fruit, in
their cups the new wine-juice, and in their hearts all the joy of the
merry grape season.

There are many days like this in the autumn, but the frost will come
at last, and the snow too. This is winter, but winter brings the best
pleasure of all.

When two weeks of the winter had nearly passed, the children, as you
may suppose, began to think of Christmas, and, indeed, their best
and most loving friend had been preparing for them the sweetest of
Christmas presents. Ten days before Christmas it came, however. Can
you guess what it was? Something for all of them,--something which
Christian will like just as well as little Gretchen will, and the
father and mother will perhaps be more pleased than any one else.

Do you know what it is? What do you think of a little baby brother,--a
little round, sweet, blue-eyed baby brother as a Christmas present for
them all?

When Christmas Eve came, the mother said: "The children must have
their Christmas-tree in my room, for baby is one of the presents, and
I don't think I can let him be carried out and put upon the table in
the hall, where we had it last year."

So all day long the children are kept away from their mother's room.
Their father comes home with his great coat-pockets very full of
something, but, of course, the children don't know what. He comes and
goes, up stairs and down, and, while they are all at play in the snow,
a fine young fir-tree is brought in and carried up. Louise knows it,
for she picked up a fallen branch upon the stairs, but she doesn't
tell Fritz and Gretchen.

How they all wait and long for the night to come! They sit at the
windows, watching the red sunset light upon the snow, and cannot think
of playing or eating their supper. The parlor door is open, and all
are waiting and listening. A little bell rings, and in an instant
there is a scampering up the broad stairs to the door of mother's
room; again the little bell rings, and the door is opened wide by
their father, who stands hidden behind it.

At the foot of their mother's white-curtained bed stands the little
fir-tree; tiny candles are burning all over it like little stars, and
glittering golden fruits are hanging among the dark-green branches.
On the white-covered table are laid Fritz's sword and Gretchen's big
doll, they being too heavy for the tree to hold. Under the branches
Louise finds charming things; such a little work-box as it is a
delight to see, with a lock and key, and inside, thimble and scissors,
and neat little spools of silk and thread. Then there are the fairy
stories of the old Black Forest, and that most charming of all little
books, "The White Cat," and an ivory cup and ball for Fritz. Do you
remember where the ivory comes from? And, lest Baby Hans should think
himself forgotten, there is an ivory rattle for him.

There he lies in the nurse's arms, his blue eyes wide open with
wonder, and in a minute the children, with arms full of presents, have
gathered round the old woman's arm-chair,--gathered round the best and
sweetest little Christmas present of all. And the happy mother, who
sits up among the pillows, taking her supper, while she watches her
children, forgets to eat, and leaves the gruel to grow cold, but her
heart is warm enough.

Why is not Christian here to-night? In the school of music, away on
the hill, he is singing a grand Christmas hymn, with a hundred young
voices to join him. It is very grand and sweet, full of thanks and of
love. It makes the little boy feel nearer to all his loved ones, and
in his heart he is thanking the dear Father who has given them that
best little Christmas present,--the baby.






There are many things happening in this world, dear children,--things
that happen to you yourselves day after day, which you are too young
to understand at the time. By and by, when you grow to be as old as I
am, you will remember and wonder about them all.

Now, it was just one of these wonderful things, too great for the
young children to understand, that happened to our little Louise and
her brothers and sister when the Christmas time had come around again,
and the baby was more than a year old.

It was a cold, stormy night; there were great drifts of snow, and
the wind was driving it against the windows. In the beautiful great
parlor, beside the bright fire, sat the sweet, gentle mother, and
in her lap lay the stout little Hans. The children had their little
chairs before the fire, and watched the red and yellow flames, while
Louise had already taken out her knitting-work.

They were all very still, for their father seemed sad and troubled,
and the children were wondering what could be the matter. Their mother
looked at them and smiled, but, after all, it was only a sad smile. I
think it is hardest for the father, when he can no longer give to wife
and children their pleasant home; but, if they can be courageous and
happy when they have to give it up, it makes his heart easier and
brighter.

"I must tell the children' to-night," said the father, looking at his
wife, and she answered quite cheerfully: "Yes, tell them; they will
not be sad about it I know."

So the father told to his wondering little ones that he had lost all
his money; the beautiful great house and gardens were no longer his,
and they must all leave their pleasant home near the Rhine, and cross
the great, tossing ocean, to find a new home among the forests or the
prairies.

As you may suppose, the children didn't fully understand this. I
don't think you would yourself. You would be quite delighted with the
packing and moving, and the pleasant journey in the cars, and the new
and strange things you would see on board the ship, and it would be
quite a long time before you could really know what it was to lose
your own dear home.

So the children were not sad; you know their mother said they would
not be. But when they were safely tucked up in their little beds, and
tenderly kissed by the most loving lips, Louise could not go to sleep
for thinking of this strange moving, and wondering what they should
carry, and how long they should stay. For she had herself once been on
a visit to her uncle in the city, carrying her clothes in a new little
square trunk, and riding fifty miles in the cars, and she thought it
would be quite a fine thing that they should all pack up trunks full
of clothing, and go together on even a longer journey.

A letter had been written to tell Christian, and the next day he came
home from the school. His uncles in the city begged him to stay with
them, but the boy said earnestly: "If my father must cross the sea, I
too must go with him."

They waited only for the winter's cold to pass away, and when the
first robins began to sing among the naked trees, they had left the
fine large house,--left the beautiful gardens where the children
used to play, left the great, comfortable arm-chairs and sofas, the
bookcases and tables, and the little beds beside the wall. Besides
their clothes, they had taken nothing with them but two great wooden
chests full of beautiful linen sheets and table-cloths. These had been
given to the mother by her mother long ago, before any of the children
were born, and they must be carried to the new home. You will see, by
and by, how glad the family all were to have them.

Did you ever go on board a ship? It is almost like a great house upon
the water, but the rooms in it are very small, and so are the windows.
Then there is the long deck, where we may walk in the fresh air and
watch the water and the sea-birds, or the sailors at work upon the
high masts among the ropes, and the white sails that spread out like a
white bird's wings, and sweep the ship along over the water.

It was in such a ship that our children found themselves, with
their father and mother, when the snow was gone and young grass
was beginning to spring up on the land. But of this they could see
nothing, for in a day they had flown on the white wings far out over
the water, and as Louise clung to her father's hand and stood upon the
deck at sunset, she saw only water and sky all about on every side,
and the red clouds of the sunset. It was a little sad, and quite
strange to her, but her younger brothers and sisters were already
asleep in the small beds of the ship, which, as perhaps you know, are
built up against the wall, just as their beds were at home. Louise
kissed her father and went down, too, to bed, for you must know that
on board ship you go _down_ stairs to bed instead of _up_ stairs.

After all, if father, mother, brother, and sister can still cling to
each other and love each other, it makes little difference where they
are, for love is the best thing in the universe, and nothing is good
without it.

They lived for many days in the ship, and the children, after a little
time, were not afraid to run about the deck and talk with the sailors,
who were always very kind to them. And Louise felt quite at home
sitting in her little chair beside the great mast, while she knit upon
her stocking,--a little stocking now, one for the baby.

Christian had brought his flute, and at night he played to them as he
used at home, and, indeed, they were all so loving and happy together
that it was not much sorrow to lose the home while they kept each
other.

Sometimes a hard day would come, when the clouds swept over them, and
the rain and the great waves tossed the ship, making them all sick,
and sad too, for a time; but the sun was sure to come out at last, as
I can assure you it always will, and, on the whole, it was a pleasant
journey for them all.

It was a fine, sunny May day when they reached the land again. No
time, though, for them to go Maying, for only see how much is to
be done! Here are all the trunks and the linen-chests, and all the
children, too, to be disposed of, and they are to stop but two days in
this city. Then they must be ready for a long journey in the cars and
steamboats, up rivers and across lakes, and sometimes for miles and
miles through woods, where they see no houses nor people, excepting
here and there a single log cabin with two or three ragged children at
play outside, or a baby creeping over the doorstep, while farther on
among the trees stands a man with his axe, cutting, with heavy blows,
some tall trees into such logs as those of which the house is built.

These are new and strange sights to the children of the River Rhine.
They wonder, and often ask their parents if they, too, shall live in a
little log house like that.

How fresh and fragrant the new logs are for the dwelling, and how
sweet the pine and spruce boughs for a bed! A good new log house in
the green woods is the best home in the world.

Oh, how heartily tired they all are when at last they stop! They have
been riding by day and by night. The children have fallen asleep with
heads curled down upon their arms upon the seats of the car, and the
mother has had very hard work to keep little Hans contented and happy.
But here at last they have stopped. Here is the new home.

They have left the cars at a very small town. It has ten or twelve
houses and one store, and they have taken here a great wagon with
three horses to carry them yet a few miles farther to a lonely, though
beautiful place. It is on the edge of a forest. The trees are very
tall, their trunks moss-covered; and when you look far in among them
it is so dark that no sunlight seems to fall on the brown earth. But
outside is sunshine, and the young spring grass and wild flowers,
different from those which grow on the Rhine banks.

But where is their house?

Here is indeed something new for them. It is almost night; no house is
near, and they have no sleeping-place but the great wagon. But their
cheerful mother packs them all away in the back part of the wagon,
on some straw, covering them with shawls as well as she can, and bids
them good-night, saying, "You can see the stars whenever you open your
eyes."

It is a new bed and a hard one. However, the children are tired enough
to sleep well; but they woke very early, as you or I certainly should
if we slept in the great concert-hall of the birds. Oh, how those
birds of the woods did begin to sing, long before sunrise! And
Christian was out from his part of the bed in a minute, and off four
miles to the store, to buy some bread for breakfast.

An hour after sunrise he was back again, and Louise had gathered
sticks, of which her father made a bright fire. And now the mother is
teaching her little daughter how to make tea, and Fritz and Gretchen
are poking long sticks into the ashes to find the potatoes which were
hidden there to roast.

To them it is a beautiful picnic, like those happy days in the grape
season; but Louise can see that her mother is a little grieved at
having them sleep in the wagon with no house to cover them. And when
breakfast is over she says to the father that the children must be
taken back to the village to stay until the house is built. He, too,
had thought so; and the mother and children go back to the little
town.

Christian alone stays with his father, working with his small axe as
his father does with the large one; but to both it is very hard work
to cut trees; because it is something they have never done before.
They do their best, and when he is not too tired, Christian whistles
to cheer himself.

After the first day a man is hired to help, and it is not a great
while before the little house is built--built of great, rough logs,
still covered with brown bark and moss. All the cracks are stuffed
with moss to keep out the rain and cold, and there is one window and a
door.

It is a poor little house to come to after leaving the grand old one
by the Rhine, but the children are delighted when their father comes
with the great wagon to take them to their new home.

And into this house one summer night they come--without beds, tables,
or chairs; really with nothing but the trunks and linen-chests. The
dear old linen-chests, see only how very useful they have become! What
shall be the supper-table for this first meal in the new house? What
but the largest of the linen-chests, round which they all gather, some
sitting on blocks of wood, and the little ones standing! And after
supper what shall they have for beds? What but the good old chests
again! For many and many a day and night they are used, and the mother
is, over and over again, thankful that she brought them.

As the summer days go by, the children pick berries in the woods and
meadows, and Fritz is feeling himself a great boy when his father
expects him to take care of the old horse, blind of one eye, bought to
drag the loads of wood to market.

Louise is learning to love the grand old trees where the birds and
squirrels live. She sits for hours with her work on some mossy cushion
under the great waving boughs, and she is so silent and gentle that
the squirrels learn to come very near her, turning their heads every
minute to see if she is watching, and almost laughing at her with
their sharp, bright eyes, while they are cramming their cheeks full of
nuts--not to eat now, you know, but to carry home to the storehouses
in some comfortable hollow trees, to be saved for winter use. When the
snow comes, you see, they will not be able to find any nuts.

One day Louise watched them until she suddenly thought, "Why don't we,
too, save nuts for the winter?" and the next day she brought a
basket and the younger children, instead of her knitting-work. They
frightened away the squirrels, to be sure, but they carried home a
fine large basketful of nuts.

Oh, how much might be seen in those woods on a summer day!--birds and
flowers, and such beautiful moss! I have seen it myself, so soft and
thick, better than the softest cushion to sit on, and then so lovely
to look at, with its long, bright feathers of green.

Sometimes Louise has seen the quails going out for a walk; the mother
with her seven babies all tripping primly along behind her, the wee,
brown birds; and all running, helter-skelter, in a minute, if they
hear a noise among the bushes, and hiding, each one, his head under a
broad leaf, thinking, poor little foolish things, that no one can see
them.

Christian whistles to the quails a long, low call; they will look this
way and that and listen, and at last really run towards him without
fear.

Before winter comes the log house is made more comfortable; beds and
chairs are bought, and a great fire burns in the fireplace. But do the
best they can the rain will beat in between the logs, and after the
first snowstorm one night, a white pointed drift is found on the
breakfast-table. They laugh at it, and call it ice-cream, but they
almost feel more like crying, with cold blue fingers, and toes that
even the warm knit stockings can't keep comfortable. Never mind, the
swift snowshoes will make them skim over the snow-crust like birds
flying, and the merry sled-rides that brother Christian will give them
will make up for all the trouble. They will soon love the winter in
the snowy woods.

Their clothes, too, are all wearing out. Fritz comes to his mother
with great holes in his jacket-sleeves, and poor Christian's knees are
blue and frost-bitten through the torn trousers. What shall be done?

Louise brings out two old coats of her father's. Christian is wrapped
in one from head to foot, and Fritz looks like the oddest little man
with his great coat muffled around him, crossed in front and buttoned
around behind, while the long sleeves can be turned back almost to his
shoulders. Funny enough he looks, but it makes him quite warm; and in
this biting wind who would think of the looks? So our little friend
is to drive poor old Major to town with a sled-load of wood every day,
while his father and brother are cutting trees in the forest.

Should you laugh to see a boy so dressed coming up the street with a
load of wood? Perhaps you wouldn't if you knew how cold he would be
without this coat, and how much he hopes to get the half-dollar for
his wood, and bring home bread and meat for supper.

How wise the children grow in this hard work and hard life! Fritz
feels himself a little man, and Louise, I am sure, is as useful as
many a woman, for she is learning to cook and tend the fire, while
even Gretchen has some garters to knit, and takes quite good care of
the baby.

Little Hans will never remember the great house by the Rhine; he was
too little when they came away; but by and by he will like to hear
stories about it, which, you may be sure, Louise will often tell her
little brother.

The winter is the hardest time. When Christmas comes there is not even
a tree, for there are no candles to light one and no presents to give.
But there is one beautiful gift which they may and do all give to each
other,--it makes them happier than many toys or books,--it is love. It
makes even this cold dreary Christmas bright and beautiful to them.

Next winter will not be so hard, for in the spring corn will be
planted, and plenty of potatoes and turnips and cabbages; and they
will have enough to eat and something to sell for money.

But I must not stay to tell you more now of the backwoods life of
Louise and her brothers and sister. If you travel some day to the
West, perhaps you will see her yourself, gathering her nuts under the
trees, or sitting in the sun on the doorstep with her knitting. Then
you will know her for the little sister who has perhaps come
closest to your heart, and you will clasp each other's hands in true
affection.






Here, dear children, are your seven little sisters. Let us count them
over. First came the brown baby, then Agoonack, Gemila, Jeannette,
Pen-se, Manenko, and Louise. Seven little sisters I have called them,
but Marnie exclaims: "How can they be sisters when some are black,
some brown, and some white; when one lives in the warm country and
another in the cold, and Louise upon the shores of the Rhine? Sallie
and I are sisters, because we have the same father and live here
together in the same house by the seaside; but as for those seven
children, I can't believe them to be sisters at all."

Now let us suppose, my dear little girl, that your sister Sallie
should go away,--far away in a ship across the ocean to the warm
countries, and the sun should burn her face and hands and make them
so brown that you would hardly know her,--wouldn't she still be your
sister Sallie?

And suppose even that she should stay away in the warm countries and
never come back again, wouldn't she still be your dear sister? and
wouldn't you write her letters and tell her about home and all that
you love there?

I know you would.

And now, just think if you yourself should take a great journey
through ice and snow and go to the cold countries, up among the white
bears and the sledges and dogs; suppose even that you should have an
odd little dress of white bear-skin, like Agoonack, wouldn't you think
it very strange if Sallie shouldn't call you her little sister just
because you were living up there among the ice?

And what if Minnie, too, should take it into her head to sail across
the seas and live in a boat on a Chinese river, like Pen-se, and drive
the ducks, eat rice with chopsticks, and have fried mice for dinner;
why, you might not want to dine with her, but she would be your sweet,
loving sister all the same, wouldn't she?

I can hear you say "Yes" to all this, but then you will add: "Father
is our father the same all the time, and he isn't Pen-se's father, nor
Manenko's."

Let us see what makes you think he is your father. Because he loves
you so much and gives you everything that you have--clothes to wear,
and food to eat, and fire to warm you?

Did he give you this new little gingham frock? Shall we see what it
is made of? If you ravel out one end of the cloth, you can find the
little threads of cotton which are woven together to make your frock.
Where did the cotton come from?

It grew in the hot fields of the South, where the sun shines very
warmly. Your father didn't make it grow, neither did any man. It is
true a man, a poor black man, and a very sad man he was too, put the
little seeds into the ground, but they would never have grown if the
sun hadn't shone, the soft earth nourished, and the rain moistened
them. And who made the earth, and sent the sun and the rain?

That must be somebody very kind and thoughtful, to take so much care
of the little cotton-seeds. I think that must be a father.

Now, what did you have for breakfast this morning?

A sweet Indian cake with your egg and mug of milk? I thought so. Who
made this breakfast? Did Bridget make the cake in the kitchen? Yes,
she mixed the meal with milk and salt and sugar. But where did she get
the meal? The miller ground the yellow corn to make it. But who made
the corn?

The seeds were planted as the cottonseeds were, and the same kind care
supplied sun and rain and earth for them. Wasn't that a father? Not
your father who sits at the head of the table and helps you at dinner,
who takes you to walk and tells you stories, but another Father; your
Father, too, he must be, for he is certainly taking care of you.

And doesn't he make the corn grow, also, on that ant-hill behind
Manenko's house? He seems to take the same care of her as of you.

Then the milk and the egg. They come from the hen and the cow; but who
made the hen and the cow?

It was the same kind Father again who made them for you, and made
the camels and goats for Gemila and Jeannette; who made also the wild
bees, and taught them to store their honey in the trees, for Manenko;
who made the white rice grow and ripen for little Pen-se, and the
sea-birds and the seals for Agoonack. To every one good food to
eat--and more than that; for must it not be a very loving father who
has made for us all the beautiful sky, and the stars at night, and the
blue sea; who sent the soft wind to rock the brown baby to sleep
and sing her a song, and the grand march of the Northern Lights for
Agoonack--grander and more beautiful than any of the fireworks you
know; the red strawberries for little Jeannette to gather, and the
beautiful chestnut woods on the mountain-side? Do you remember all
these things in the stories?

And wasn't it the same tender love that made the sparkling water and
sunshine for Pen-se, and the shining brown ducks for her too; the
springs in the desert and the palm-trees for Gemila, as well as the
warm sunshine for Manenko, and the beautiful River Rhine for Louise?

It must be a very dear father who gives his children not only all
they need for food and clothing, but so many, many beautiful things to
enjoy.

Don't you see that they must all be his children, and so all sisters,
and that he is your Father, too, who makes the mayflowers bloom, and
the violets cover the hills, and turns the white blossoms into black,
sweet berries in the autumn? It is your dear and kind Father who does
all this for his children. He has very many children; some of them
live in houses and some in tents, some in little huts and some under
the trees, in the warm countries and in the cold. And he loves them
all; they are his children, and they are brothers and sisters. Shall
they not love each other?

THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.


          AS Brownies rambled 'round one night,
          A country schoolhouse came in sight;
          And there they paused awhile to speak
          About the place, where through the week
          The scholars came, with smile or whine,


          Each morning at the stroke of nine.
          "This is," said one, "the place, indeed,
          Where children come to write and read.
          'T is here, through rules and rods to suit,
          The young idea learns to shoot;
          And here the idler with a grin
          In nearest neighbor pokes the pin,


          Or sighs to break his scribbled slate
          And spring at once to man's estate.
          How oft from shades of yonder grove
          I've viewed at eve the shouting drove
          As from the door they crowding broke,
          Like oxen from beneath the yoke."

          Another said: "The teacher's chair,
          The ruler, pen, and birch are there,
          The blackboard hangs against the wall;
          The slate's at hand, the books and all.
          We might go in to read and write
          And master sums like scholars bright."


          The more they talked, the stronger grew
          The wish to prove how much they knew.
          From page to page through books to pass
          And spell the words that tried the class;
          So through their skill they soon obtained
          Access to all the room contained.



          "I'll play," cried one, "the teacher's part;
          I know some lessons quite by heart,
          And every section of the land
          To me is plain as open hand."
          "With all respect, my friend, to you,"
          Another said, "that would not do.
          You're hardly fitted, sir, to rule;


          Your place should be the dunce's stool.
          You're not with great endowments blessed;
          Besides, your temper's not the best,
          And those who train the budding mind
          Should own a disposition kind.
          The rod looks better on the tree
          Than resting by the master's knee;
          _I'll_ be the teacher, if you please;
          I know the rivers, lakes, and seas,
          And, like a banker's clerk, can throw
          The figures nimbly in a row.
          I have the patience, love, and grace,
          So requisite in such a case."



          Now some bent o'er a slate or book,
          And some at blackboards station took.
          They clustered 'round the globe with zeal,
          And kept it turning like a wheel.
          Said one, "I've often heard it said,
          The world is rounder than your head,
          And here, indeed, we find it true.
          With both the poles at once in view,
          With latitudes and each degree
          All measured out on land and sea."
          Another said, "I thought I knew
          The world from Maine to Timbuctoo,
          Or could, without a guide, have found
          My way from Cork to Puget Sound;
          But here so many things I find
          That never dawned upon my mind,
          On sundry points, I blush to say,
          I've been a thousand miles astray."
          "'T is like an egg," another cried,
          "A little longer than it's wide,
          With islands scattered through the seas
          Where savages may live at ease;



          And buried up in Polar snows
          You find the hardy Eskimos;
          While here and there some scorching spots
          Are set apart for Hottentots.
          And see the rivers small and great,
          That drain a province or a state;
          The name and shape of every nation;
          Their faith, extent, and population:
          And whether governed by a King,
          A President, or council ring."



          While some with such expressions bold
          Surveyed the globe as 'round it rolled,
          Still others turned to ink and pen,
          And, spreading like a brooding hen,
          They scrawled a page to show the band
          Their special "style," or "business hand."



          The teacher had enough to do,
          To act his part to nature true:
          He lectured well the infant squad,
          He rapped the desk and shook the rod,
          And stood the dunce upon the stool,
          A laughing-stock to all the school--
          But frequent changes please the crowd,
          So lengthy reign was not allowed;
          And when one master had his hour,
          Another took the rod of power;
          And thus they changed to suit the case,
          Till many filled the honored place.



          So taken up was every mind
          With fun and study well combined,



          They noticed not the hours depart,
          Until the sun commenced to dart
          A sheaf of lances, long and bright,
          Above the distant mountain height;
          Then from the schoolroom, in a heap,
          They jumped and tumbled, twenty deep,
          In eager haste to disappear
          In deepest shades of forests near.

          When next the children gathered there,
          With wondering faces fresh and fair,
          It took an hour of morning prime,
          According to the teacher's time,
          To get the books in place once more,
          And order to the room restore.
          So great had been the haste to hide,
          The windows were left open wide;
          And scholars knew, without a doubt,
          That Brownies had been thereabout.




          ONE night a cunning Brownie band
          Was roaming through a farmer's land,
          And while the rogues went prying 'round,
          The farmer's mare at rest they found;
          And peeping through the stable-door,
          They saw the harness that she wore.
          The sight was tempting to the eye,
          For there the cart was standing nigh.


          "That mare," said one, "deserves her feed--
          Believe me, she's no common breed;
          Her grit is good: I've seen her dash
          Up yonder slope without the lash,
          Until her load--a ton of hay--
          Went bouncing in beside the bay.
          In this same cart, old Farmer Gill
          Takes all his corn and wheat to mill;
          It must be strong, though rude and rough;
          It runs on wheels, and that's enough."



          Now, Brownies seldom idle stand
          When there's a chance for fun at hand.


          So plans were laid without delay;
          The mare was dragged from oats and hay,
          The harness from the peg they drew,
          And every one to action flew.
          It was a sight one should behold
          To see them working, young and old;
          Two wrinkled elves, like leather browned,
          Whose beards descended near the ground,
          Along with youngsters did their best
          With all the ardor of the rest.


          While some prepared a rein or trace,
          Another slid the bit in place;
          More buckled bands with all their might,
          Or drew the harness close and tight.



          When every strap a buckle found,
          And every part was safe and sound,
          Then 'round the cart the Brownies flew,--
          The hardest task was yet to do.
          It often puzzles bearded men,
          Though o'er and o'er performed again.

          Some held the shafts to steer them straight,
          More did their best to balance weight,
          While others showed both strength and art
          In backing Mag into the cart.
          At length the heavy job was done,
          And horse and cart moved off as one.

          Now down the road the gentle steed
          Was forced to trot at greatest speed.


          A merrier crowd than journeyed there
          Was never seen at Dublin Fair.
          Some found a seat, while others stood,
          Or hung behind as best they could;
          While many, strung along, astride,
          Upon the mare enjoyed the ride.


          The night was dark, the lucky elves
          Had all the turnpike to themselves.
          No surly keeper barred the way,
          For use of road demanding pay,
          Nor were they startled by the cry
          Of robbers shouting, "Stand or die!"
          Across the bridge and up the hill
          And through the woods to Warren's mill,--
          A lengthy ride, ten miles at least,--
          Without a rest they drove the beast,
          And then were loath enough to rein
          Old Mag around for home again.



          Nor was the speed, returning, slow;
          The mare was more inclined to go,
          Because the feed of oats and hay
          Unfinished in her manger lay.
          So through the yard she wheeled her load
          As briskly as she took the road.
          No time remained to then undo
          The many straps which tight they drew.
          For in the east the reddening sky
          Gave warning that the sun was nigh.


          The halter rope was quickly wound
          About the nearest post they found;
          Then off they scampered, left and right,
          And disappeared at once from sight.


          When Farmer Gill that morning fair
          Came out and viewed his jaded mare,
          I may not here in verse repeat
          His exclamations all complete.
          He gnashed his teeth, and glared around,
          And struck his fists, and stamped the ground,
          And chased the dog across the farm,
          Because it failed to give alarm.
          "I'd give a stack of hay," he cried,
          "To catch the rogue who stole the ride!"
          But still awry suspicion flew,--
          Who stole the ride he never knew.



          ONE night, when the cold moon hung low
          And winter wrapped the world in snow
          And bridged the streams in wood and field
          With ice as smooth as shining shield,
          Some skaters swept in graceful style
          The glistening surface, file on file.
          For hours the Brownies viewed the show,
          Commenting on the groups below;



          Said one: "That pleasure might be ours--
          We have the feet and motive powers;
          No mortal need us Brownies teach,
          If skates were but within our reach."
          Another answered: "Then, my friend,
          To hear my plan let all attend.
          I have a building in my mind
          That we within an hour can find.
          Three golden balls hang by the door,
          Like oranges from Cuba's shore;
          Behind the dusty counter stands
          A native of queer, far-off lands;
          The place is filled with various things,



          From baby-carts to banjo-strings;


          Here hangs a gun without a lock
          Some Pilgrim bore to Plymouth rock;

          And there a pair of goggles lie,
          That saw the red-coats marching by;

          While piles of club and rocker skates
          Of every shape the buyer waits!
          Though second-hand, I'm sure they'll do,
          And serve our wants as well as new.
          That place we'll enter as we may,
          To-morrow night, and bear away
          A pair, the best that come to hand,
          For every member of the band."
          At once, the enterprise so bold
          Received support from young and old.
          A place to muster near the town,
          And meeting hour they noted down;
          And then retiring for the night,
          They soon were lost to sound and sight.

          When evening next her visit paid
          To fold the earth in robes of shade,
          From out the woods across the mead,
          The Brownies gathered as agreed,
          To venture boldly and procure.


          The skates that would their fun insure.
          As mice can get to cake and cheese
          Without a key whene'er they please,
          So, cunning Brownies can proceed
          And help themselves to what they need.


          For bolts and bars they little care
          If but a nail is wanting there!
          Or, failing this, with ease descend
          Like Santa Claus and gain their end
          As children to the windows fly
          At news of Jumbo passing by,
          So rushed the eager band away
          To fields of ice without delay.

          Though far too large at heel and toe,
          The skates were somehow made to go.
          But out behind and out before,
          Like spurs, they stuck a span or more,
          Alike afflicting foe and friend
          In bringing journeys to an end.
          They had their slips and sudden spreads,
          Where heels flew higher than their heads,
          As people do, however nice,
          When venturing first upon the ice.
          But soon they learned to curve and wheel
          And cut fine scrolls with scoring steel,
          To race in clusters to and fro,
          To jump and turn and backward go,
          Until a rest on bed so cool,
          Was more the wonder than the rule.


          But from the lake they all withdrew
          Some hours before the night was through,
          And hastened back with lively feet
          Through narrow lane and silent street,
          Until they reached the broker's door
          With every skate that left the store.

          And, ere the first faint gleam of day,
          The skates were safely stowed away;
          Of their brief absence not a trace
          Was left within the dusty place.





          ONE evening Brownies, peeping down
          From bluffs that overlooked the town,
          Saw wheelmen passing to and fro
          Upon the boulevard below.
          "It seems," said one, "an easy trick,
          The wheel goes 'round so smooth and quick;
          You simply sit and work your feet
          And glide with grace along the street.
          The pleasure would be fine indeed
          If _we_ could thus in line proceed."


          "Last night," another answer made,
          "As by the river's bank I strayed,
          Where here and there a building stands,
          And town and country-side join hands,
          Before me stood a massive wall
          With engine-rooms and chimneys tall.

   

          "To scale the place a way I found,
          And, creeping in, looked all around;
          There bicycles of every grade
          Are manufactured for the trade;
          Some made for baby hands to guide,
          And some for older folk to ride.

          "Though built to keep intruders out,
          With shutters thick and casings stout,
          I noticed twenty ways or more,
          By roof, by window, wall and door,
          Where we, by exercising skill,
          May travel in and out at will."

          Another spoke, in nowise slow
          To catch at pleasures as they go,
                  And said, "Why let another day
                  Come creeping in to drag away?
                          Let's active measures now employ
                          To seize at once the promised joy.
                      On bicycles quick let us ride,
                      While yet our wants may be supplied."

          So when the town grew hushed and still,
          The Brownies ventured down the hill.
              And soon the band was drawing nigh
              The building with the chimneys high.



          When people lock their doors at night,
          And double-bolt them left and right,
          And think through patents, new and old,
          To leave the burglars in the cold,
          The cunning Brownies smile to see
          The springing bolt and turning key;
          For well they know if fancy leads
          Their band to venture daring deeds,
          The miser's gold, the merchant's ware
          To them is open as the air.

          Not long could door or windows stand
          Fast locked before the Brownie band;
          And soon the bicycles they sought
          From every room and bench were brought.
          The rogues ere long began to show
          As many colors as the bow;
          For paint and varnish lately spread
          Besmeared them all from foot to head.
          Some turned to jay-birds in a minute,
          And some as quick might shame the linnet;
          While more with crimson-tinted breast
          Seemed fitted for the robin's nest.

          But whether red or green or blue,
          The work on hand was hurried through;
          They took the wheels from blacksmith fires,
          Though wanting bolts and even tires,
          And rigged the parts with skill and speed
          To answer well their pressing need.
          And soon, enough were made complete
          To give the greater part a seat,
          And let the rest through cunning find
          Some way of hanging on behind.
          And then no spurt along the road,
          Or 'round the yard their courage showed,
          But twenty times a measured mile
          They whirled away in single file,
          Or bunched together in a crowd
          If width of road or skill allowed.
          At times, while rolling down the grade,
          Collisions some confusion made,
          For every member of the band,
          At steering wished to try his hand;
          Though some, perhaps, were not designed
          For labor of that special kind.

          But Brownies are the folk to bear
          Misfortunes with unruffled air;
          So on through rough and smooth they spun
          Until the turning-point was won.
          Then back they wheeled with every spoke,
          An hour before the thrush awoke.





          ONE evening as the woods grew dark,
          The Brownies wandered through a park.
          And soon a building, quaint and small,
          Appeared to draw the gaze of all.
          Said one: "This place contains, no doubt,
          The tools of workmen hereabout."
          Another said: "You're quite astray,
          The workmen's tools are miles away;
          Within this building may be found
          The fixtures for the tennis ground.
          A meadow near, both long and wide,
          For half the year is set aside,
          And marked with many a square and court,
          For those who love the royal sport.
          On afternoons assembled there,
          The active men and maidens fair
          Keep up the game until the day
          Has faded into evening gray."
          "In other lands than those we tread,
          I played the game," another said,
          "And proved my skill and muscle stout,
          As 'server' and as 'striker-out.'
          The lock that hangs before us there
          Bears witness to the keeper's care,
          And tramps or burglars might go by,
          If such a sign should meet the eye.
          But we, who laugh at locks or law
          Designed to keep mankind in awe,
          May praise the keeper's cautious mind,
          But all the same an entrance find."


       Ere long, the path that lay between
          The building and the meadow green,
          Was crowded with the bustling throng,
          All bearing implements along;
          Some lugging stakes or racket sets,
          And others buried up in nets.
          To set the posts and mark the ground
          The proper size and shape around,
          With service-line and line of base,
          And courts, both left and right, in place,
          Was work that caused but slight delay;
          And soon the sport was under way.
          And then a strange and stirring scene
          Was pictured out upon the green.



          Some watched the game and noted well
          Where this or that one would excel.



          And shouts and calls that filled the air
          Proved even-handed playing there.
          With anxious looks some kept the score,
          And shouted "'vantage!" "game all!" or
          To some, "love, forty!"--"deuce!" to more.
          But when "deuce set!" the scorer cried,
          Applause would ring on every side.
          At times so hot the contest grew,
          Established laws aside they threw,
          And in the game where four should stand,
          At least a dozen took a hand.
          Some tangled in the netting lay
          And some from base-lines strayed away.
          Some hit the ball when out of place
          Or scrambled through unlawful space.
          But still no game was forced to halt
          Because of this or greater fault.


          And there they sported on the lawn
          Until the ruddy streaks of dawn
          Gave warning that the day was near,
          And Brownies all must disappear.




          ONE time, while Brownies passed around
          An honest farmer's piece of ground,
          They paused to view the garden fair
          And fields of grain that needed care.
          "My friends," said one who often spoke
          About the ways of human folk,


          "Now here's a case in point, I claim,
          Where neighbors scarce deserve the name:
          This farmer on his back is laid
          With broken ribs and shoulder-blade,
          Received, I hear, some weeks ago;
          While at the village here below,
          He checked a running team, to save
          Some children from an early grave.
          Now overripe his harvest stands
          In waiting for the reaper's hands;
          The piece of wheat we lately passed
          Is shelling out at every blast.


          Those pumpkins in that corner plot
          Begin to show the signs of rot;
          The mold has fastened on their skin,
          The ripest ones are caving in,
          And soon the pig in yonder sty
          With scornful grunt would pass them by.
          His Early Rose potatoes there
          Are much in need of light and air;
          The turnip withers where it lies,
          The beet and carrot want to rise.
          'Oh, pull us up!' they seem to cry
          To every one that passes by;
          'The frost will finish our repose,
          The grubs are working at our toes;

          Unless you come and save us soon,
          We'll not be worth a picayune!'
          The corn is breaking from the stalk,
          The hens around the hill can walk,
          And with their ever ready bill
          May pick the kernels at their will.
          His neighbors are a sordid crowd,
          Who've such a shameful waste allowed
          So wrapped in self some men can be,
          Beyond their purse they seldom see;
          'T is left for us to play the friend
          And here a helping hand extend.
          But as the wakeful chanticleer
          Is crowing in the stable near,
          Too little of the present night
          Is left to set the matter right.

          "To-morrow eve, at that dark hour
          When birds grow still in leafy bower
          And bats forsake the ruined pile
          To exercise their wings awhile,
          In yonder shady grove we'll meet,
          With all our active force complete,
          Prepared to give this farmer aid
          With basket, barrel, hook, and spade.


          But, ere we part, one caution more:
          Let some invade a druggist's store,
          And bring along a coated pill;



          We'll dose the dog to keep him still.
          For barking dogs, however kind,
          Can oft disturb a Brownie's mind."
          --When next the bat of evening flew,
          And drowsy things of day withdrew,
          When beetles droned across the lea,
          And turkeys sought the safest tree
          To form aloft a social row
          And criticise the fox below,--
          Then cunning Brownies might be seen
          Advancing from the forest green;
          Now jumping fences, as they ran,
          Now crawling through (a safer plan);
          Now keeping to the roads awhile,
          Now "cutting corners," country style;
          Some bearing hoes, and baskets more,
          Some pushing barrows on before,
          While others, swinging sickles bright,
          Seemed eager for the grain in sight.
          But in advance of all the throng
          Three daring Brownies moved along,
          Whose duty was to venture close
          And give the barking dog his dose.



          Now soon the work was under way,
          Each chose the part he was to play:
          While some who handled hoes the best
          Brought "Early Roses" from their nest,
          To turnip-tops some laid their hands,
          More plied the hook, or twisted bands.
          And soon the sheaves lay piled around,
          Like heroes on disputed ground.
          Now let the eye turn where it might,
          A pleasing prospect was in sight;
          For garden ground or larger field
          Alike a busy crowd revealed:
          Some pulling carrots from their bed,
          Some bearing burdens on their head,
          Or working at a fever heat
          While prying out a monster beet.
          Now here two heavy loads have met,
          And there a barrow has upset,


          While workers every effort strain
          The rolling pumpkins to regain;


          And long before the stars withdrew,
          The crop was safe, the work was through.
          In shocks the corn, secure and good,
          Now like a Sioux encampment stood;
          The wheat was safely stowed away;
          In bins the "Early Roses" lay,



          While carrots, turnips, beets, and all
          Received attention, great and small.
          When morning dawned, no sight or sound
          Of friendly Brownies could be found;
          And when at last old Towser broke
          The spell, and from his slumber woke,
          He rushed around, believing still
          Some mischief lay behind the pill.
          But though the field looked bare and strange,
          His mind could hardly grasp the change.
          And when the farmer learned at morn
          That safe from harm were wheat and corn,
          That all his barley, oats, and rye
          Were in the barn, secure and dry,
          That carrots, beets, and turnips round
          Were safely taken from the ground,
          The honest farmer thought, of course,
          His neighbors had turned out in force
          While helpless on the bed he lay,
          And kindly stowed his crop away.


          But when he thanked them for their aid,
          And hoped they yet might be repaid
          For acting such a friendly part,
          His words appeared to pierce each heart.
          For well they knew that other hands
          Than theirs had laid his grain in bands,
          That other backs had bent in toil
          To save the products of the soil.
          And then they felt as such folk will
          Who fail to nobly act, until
          More earnest helpers, stepping in,
          Do all the praise and honor win.




          THE Brownies once, while roaming 'round,
          By chance approached a college ground;
          And, as they skirmished every side,
          A large gymnasium they espied.
          Their eyes grew bright as they surveyed
          The means for exercise displayed.
          The club, the weight, the hanging ring,
          The horizontal bar, and swing,


          The boxing-gloves that please the heart
          Of him who loves the manly art,
          All brought expressions of delight,
          As one by one they came in sight.
          The time was short, and words were few
          That named the work for each to do.
          Their mystic art, as may be found
          On pages now in volumes bound,
          Was quite enough to bear them in
          Through walls of wood and roofs of tin.
          No hasp can hold, no bolt can stand
          Before the Brownie's tiny hand;
          The sash will rise, the panel yield,
          And leave him master of the field.--
          When safe they stood within the hall,
          A pleasant time was promised all.



          Said one: "The clubs let me obtain
          That Indians use upon the plain,
          And here I'll stand to test my power,
          And swing them 'round my head an hour;
          Though not the largest in the band,
          I claim to own no infant hand;
          And muscle in this arm you'll meet
          That well might grace a trained athlete.

          Two goats once blocked a mountain pass
          Contending o'er a tuft of grass.
          Important messages of state
          Forbade me there to stand and wait;
          Without a pause, the pair I neared
          And seized the larger by the beard;
          I dragged him from his panting foe
          And hurled him to the plain below."

          "For clubs," a second answered there,
          "Or heavy weights I little care;
          Let those by generous nature planned
          At heavy lifting try their hand;
          But give me bar or give me ring,
          Where I can turn, contort, and swing,
          And I'll outdo, with movements fine,
          The monkey on his tropic vine."

          Thus skill and strength and wind they tried
          By means they found on every side.
          Some claimed at once the high trapeze,
          And there performed with grace and ease;
          They turned and tumbled left and right,
          As though they held existence light.
          At times a finger-tip was all
          Between them and a fearful fall.
          On strength of toes they now depend,
          Or now on coat-tails of a friend--
          And had that cloth been less than best
          That looms could furnish, east or west,
          Some members of the Brownie race
          Might now be missing from their place


          But fear, we know, scarce ever finds
          A home within their active minds.
          And little danger they could see
          In what would trouble you or me.
          Some stood to prove their muscle strong,
          And swung the clubs both large and long
          That men who met to practice there
          Had often found no light affair.



          A rope they found as 'round they ran,
          And then a "tug-of-war" began;
          First over benches, stools, and chairs,
          Then up and down the winding stairs,
          They pulled and hauled and tugged around,
          Now giving up, now gaining ground,
          Some lost their footing at the go,
          And on their backs slid to and fro
          Without a chance their state to mend
          Until the contest found an end.



          Their coats from tail to collar rent
          Showed some through trying treatment went,
          And more, with usage much the same,
          All twisted out of shape, and lame,
          Had scarce a button to their name.
          The judge selected for the case
          Ran here and there about the place
          With warning cries and gesture wide
          And seemed unable to decide.



          And there they might be tugging still,
          With equal strength and equal will--
          But while they struggled, stars withdrew
          And hints of morning broader grew,
          Till arrows from the rising sun
          Soon made them drop the rope and run.


          IN best of spirits, blithe and free,--
          As Brownies always seem to be,--
          A jovial band, with hop and leap,
          Were passing through a forest deep,
          When in an open space they spied
          A heavy caldron, large and wide,
          Where woodmen, working at their trade,
          A rustic boiling-place had made.
          "My friends," said one, "a chance like this
          No cunning Brownie band should miss,
          All unobserved, we may prepare
          And boil a pudding nicely there;

          Some dying embers smolder still
          Which we may soon revive at will;
          And by the roots of yonder tree
          A brook goes babbling to the sea.
          At Parker's mill, some miles below,
          They're grinding flour as white as snow
          An easy task for us to bear
          Enough to serve our need from there:
          I noticed, as I passed to-night,
          A window with a broken light,
          And through the opening we'll pour
          Though bolts and bars be on the door."
          "And I," another Brownie cried,
          "Will find the plums and currants dried;
          I'll have some here in half an hour
          To sprinkle thickly through the flour;
          So stir yourselves, and bear in mind
          That some must spice and sugar find."


          "I know," cried one, "where hens have made
          Their nest beneath the burdock shade--
          I saw them stealing out with care
          To lay their eggs in secret there.
          The farmer's wife, through sun and rain,
          Has sought to find that nest in vain:
          They cackle by the wall of stones,
          The hollow stump and pile of bones,
          And by the ditch that lies below,
          Where yellow weeds and nettles grow;
          And draw her after everywhere
          Until she quits them in despair.


          The task be mine to thither lead
          A band of comrades now with speed,
          To help me bear a tender load
          Along the rough and rugged road."
          Away, away, on every side,
          At once the lively Brownies glide;
          Some after plums, more 'round the hill--
          The shortest way to reach the mill--
          While some on wings and some on legs
          Go darting off to find the eggs.
          A few remained upon the spot
          To build a fire beneath the pot;
          Some gathered bark from trunks of trees,
          While others, on their hands and knees,
          Around the embers puffed and blew
          Until the sparks to blazes grew;
          And scarcely was the kindling burned
          Before the absent ones returned.
          All loaded down they came, in groups,
          In couples, singly, and in troops.



          Upon their shoulders, heads, and backs
          They bore along the floury sacks;
          With plums and currants others came,
          Each bag and basket filled the same;



          While those who gave the hens a call
          Had taken nest-egg, nest, and all;
          And more, a pressing want to meet,
          From some one's line had hauled a sheet,
          The monstrous pudding to infold
          While in the boiling pot it rolled.
          The rogues were flour from head to feet
          Before the mixture was complete.
          Like snow-birds in a drift of snow
          They worked and elbowed in the dough,
          Till every particle they brought
          Was in the mass before them wrought.
          And soon the sheet around the pile
          Was wrapped in most artistic style.
          Then every plan and scheme was tried
          To hoist it o'er the caldron's side.
          At times, it seemed about to fall,
          And overwhelm or bury all;
          Yet none forsook their post through fear,
          But harder worked with danger near.
          They pulled and hauled and orders gave,
          And pushed and pried with stick and stave,



          Until, in spite of height and heat,
          They had performed the trying feat.
          To take the pudding from the pot
          They might have found as hard and hot.
          But water on the fire they threw,
          And then to work again they flew.
          And soon the steaming treasure sat
          Upon a stone both broad and flat,
          Which answered for a table grand,
          When nothing better was at hand.



          Some think that Brownies never eat,
          But live on odors soft and sweet.
          That through the verdant woods proceed
          Or steal across the dewy mead;
          But those who could have gained a sight
          Of them, around their pudding white,
          Would have perceived that elves of air
          Can relish more substantial fare.



          They clustered close, and delved and ate
          Without a knife, a spoon, or plate;
          Some picking out the plums with care,
          And leaving all the pastry there.
          While some let plums and currants go,
          But paid attention to the dough.
          The purpose of each Brownie's mind
          Was not to leave a crumb behind,
          That, when the morning sun should shine
          Through leafy tree and clinging vine,
          No traces of their sumptuous feast


          It might reveal to man or beast;
          And well they gauged what all could bear,
          When they their pudding did prepare;
          For when the rich repast was done,
          The rogues could neither fly nor run.
          --The miller never missed his flour,
          For Brownies wield a mystic power;
          Whate'er they take they can restore
          In greater plenty than before.



          ONE evening, when the snow lay white
          On level plain and mountain height,
          The Brownies mustered, one and all,
          In answer to a special call.


          All clustered in a ring they stood
          Within the shelter of the wood,
          While earnest faces brighter grew
          At thought of enterprises new.
          Said one, "It seems that all the rage,
          With human kind of every age,
          Is on toboggans swift to slide
          Down steepest hill or mountain side.
          Our plans at once we must prepare,
          And try, ourselves, that pleasure rare.
          We might enough toboggans find
          In town, perhaps, of every kind,
          If some one chanced to know where they
          Awaiting sale are stowed away."

          Another spoke: "Within us lies
          The power to make our own supplies;
          We'll not depend on other hands
          To satisfy these new demands;
          The merchants' wares we'll let alone
          And make toboggans of our own;
          A lumber-yard some miles from here
          Holds seasoned lumber all the year.
          There pine and cedar may be found,
          And oak and ash are piled around.
          Some boards are thick and some are thin,
          But all will bend like sheets of tin.
          At once we'll hasten to the spot,
          And, though a fence surrounds the lot,
          We'll skirmish 'round and persevere,
          And gain an entrance,--never fear."


          This brought a smile to every face,
          For Brownies love to climb and race,
          And undertake such work as will
          Bring into play their wondrous skill.
          The pointers on the dial plate
          Could hardly mark a later date,
          Before they scampered o'er the miles
          That brought them to the lumber piles,
          And then they clambered, crept, and squeezed,
          And gained admittance where they pleased;
          For other ways than builders show
          To scale a wall the Brownies know.

          Some sought for birch, and some for pine,
          And some for cedar, soft and fine.
          With free selection well content
          Soon under heavy loads they bent.
          It chanced to be a windy night,
          Which made their labor far from light,
          But, though a heavy tax was laid
          On strength and patience, undismayed
          They worked their way by hook or crook,
          And reached at last a sheltered nook;


          Then lively work the crowd began
          To make toboggans true to plan.
          The force was large, the rogues had skill,
          And hands were willing--better still;
          So here a twist, and there a bend,
          Soon brought their labors to an end.



          Without the aid of steam or glue,
          They curved them like a war canoe;
          No little forethought some displayed,
          But wisely "double-enders" made,
          That should they turn, as turn they might,
          They'd keep the downward course aright;
          They fashioned some for three or four,
          And some to carry eight or more,



          While some were made to take a crowd
          And room for half the band allowed.
          Before the middle watch of night,
          The Brownies sought the mountain height,
          And down the steepest grade it showed
          The band in wild procession rode;
          Some lay at length, some found a seat;
          Some bravely stood on bracing feet.
          But trouble, as you understand,
          Oft moves with pleasure, hand in hand,
          And even Brownies were not free
          From evil snag or stubborn tree
          That split toboggans like a quill,
          And scattered riders down the hill.


          With pitch and toss and plunge they flew,--
          Some skimmed the drifts, some tunneled through;
          Then out across the frozen plain
          At dizzy speed they shot amain,



          Through splintered rails and flying gates
          Of half a dozen large estates;
          Until it seemed that ocean wide
          Alone could check the fearful ride.
          Some, growing dizzy with the speed,
          At times a friendly hand would need
          To help them keep their proper grip
          Through all the dangers of the trip.

          And thus until the stars had waned,
          The sport of coasting was maintained.
          Then, while they sought with lively race
          In deeper woods a hiding-place,
          "How strange," said one, "we never tried
          Till now the wild toboggan ride!


          But since we've proved the pleasure fine
          That's found upon the steep incline,
          We'll often muster on the height,
          And make the most of every night,
          Until the rains of spring descend
          And bring such pleasures to an end."
          Another answered frank and free:
          "In all such musters count on me;
          For though my back is badly strained,
          My elbow-joint and ankle sprained,
          I'll be the first upon the ground
          As long as patch of snow is found,
          And bravely do my part to steer
          Toboggans on their wild career."

          So every evening, foul or fair,
          The jovial Brownies gathered there,
          Till with the days of
          Spring, at last,
          Came drenching shower and melting blast,
          Which sent the mountain's ice and snow
          To fill the rivers miles below.



          WHILE rambling through the forest shade,
          A sudden halt some Brownies made;
          For spread about on bush and ground
          An old balloon at rest they found,
          That while upon some flying trip
          Had given aeronauts the slip.
          And, falling here in foliage green,
          Through all the summer lay unseen.
          The Brownies gathered fast to stare
          Upon the monster lying there,


          And when they learned the use and plan
          Of valves and ropes, the rogues began
          To lay their schemes and name a night
          When all could take an airy flight.
          "We want," said one, "no tame affair,
          Like some that rise with heated air,
          And hardly clear the chimney-top
          Before they lose their life and drop.
          The bag with gas must be supplied,
          That will insure a lengthy ride;
          When we set sail 't is not to fly
          Above a spire and call it high.
          The boat, or basket, must be strong,
          Designed to take the crowd along;
          For that which leaves a part behind
          Would hardly suit the Brownie mind.

          The works that serve the town of Bray
          With gas are scarce two miles away.
          To-morrow night we'll come and bear,
          As best we can, this burden there;
          And when inflated, fit to rise,
          We'll take a sail around the skies."



          Next evening, as the scheme was planned,
          The Brownies promptly were on hand;
          For when some pleasure lies in view,
          The absentees are always few.
          But 't was no easy task to haul
          The old balloon, car, ropes and all,
          Across the rocks and fallen trees
          And through the marshes to their knees.
          But Brownies, persevering still,
          Will keep their course through every ill,
          And in the main, as history shows,
          Succeed in aught they do propose.



          So, though it cost them rather dear,
          In scratches there and tumbles here,
          They worked until the wondrous feat
          Of transportation was complete.
          Then while some busy fingers played
          Around the rents that branches made,
          An extra coil of rope was tied
          In long festoons around the side,
          That all the party, young and old,
          Might find a trusty seat or hold.
          And while they worked, they chatted free
          About the wonders they would see.
          Said one: "As smoothly as a kite,
          We'll rise above the clouds to-night,
          And may the question settle soon,
          About the surface of the moon."
          Now all was ready for the gas,
          And soon the lank and tangled mass
          Began to flop about and rise,
          As though impatient for the skies;
          Then was there work for every hand
          That could be mustered in the band,
          To keep the growing monster low
          Until they stood prepared to go;
          To this and that they made it fast,
          Round stones and stakes the rope was cast;


          But strong it grew and stronger still,
          As every wrinkle seemed to fill;
          And when at last it bounded clear,
          And started on its wild career,
          A rooted stump and garden gate,
          It carried off as special freight.
          Though all the Brownies went, a part
          Were not in proper shape to start;
          Arrangements hardly were complete,
          Some wanted room and more a seat,
          While some in acrobatic style
          Must put their trust in toes awhile.
          But Brownies are not hard to please,
          And soon they rested at their ease;
          Some found support, both safe and strong,
          Upon the gate that went along,
          By some the stump was utilized,
          And furnished seats they highly prized.

          Now, as they rose they ran afoul
          Of screaming hawk and hooting owl,
          And flitting bats that hooked their wings
          At once around the ropes and strings,



          As though content to there abide
          And take the chances of the ride.
          On passing through a heavy cloud,
          One thus addressed the moistened crowd:
          "Although the earth, from which we rise,
          Now many miles below us lies,
          To sharpest eye, strain as it may,
          The moon looks just as far away."
          "The earth is good enough for me!"


          Another said, "with grassy lea,
          And shady groves, of songsters full.--
          Will some one give the valve a pull?"
          And soon they all were well content,
          To start upon a mild descent.

          But once the gas commenced to go,
          They lost the power to check the flow;
          The more they tried control to gain,
          The more it seemed to rush amain.
          Then some began to wring their hands,
          And more to volunteer commands;
          While some were craning out to view
          What part of earth their wreck would strew,
          A marshy plain, a rocky shore,
          Or ocean with its sullen roar.

   

          It happened as they neared the ground,
          A rushing gale was sweeping round,
          That caught and carried them with speed
          Across the forest and the mead.
          Then lively catching might be seen
          At cedar tops and branches green;
          While still the stump behind them swung,
          On this it caught, to that it hung,
          And, as an anchor, played a part
          They little thought of at the start.
          At length, in spite of sweeping blast,
          Some friendly branches held them fast:
          And then, descending, safe and sound,
          The daring Brownies reached the ground
          But in the tree-top on the hill
          The old balloon is hanging still,
          And saves the farmers on the plain
          From placing scare-crows in their grain.




THE BROWNIES CANOEING.


   

          AS day in shades of evening sank,
          The Brownies reached a river bank;
          And there awhile stood gazing down
          At students from a neighboring town,
          Whose light canoes charmed every eye,
          As one by one they floated by.
          Said one, "We'll follow, as they go,
          Until they gain the point below.

   

   

          There stands a house, but lately made,
          Wherein the club's effects are laid;
          We'll take possession after dark,
          And in these strange affairs embark."

   

          They all declared, at any cost,
          A chance like this should ne'er be lost;
          And keeping well the men in sight
          They followed closely as they might.

   

          The moon was climbing o'er the hill,
          The owl was hooting by the mill,
          When from the building on the sands
          The boats were shoved with willing hands.
          A "Shadow" model some explored,
          And then well-pleased they rushed on board;
          The open "Peterboro'," too,
          Found its supporters--and a crew.
          The Indian "Birch-bark" seemed too frail
          And lacked the adjunct of a sail,
          Yet of a load it did not fail,--
          For all the boats were in demand;
          As well those which with skill were planned

   

          By men of keenest judgment ripe,
          As those of humbler, home-made type.
          And soon away sailed all the fleet
          With every Brownie in his seat.

   

          The start was promising and fine;
          With little skill and less design
          They steered along as suited best,
          And let the current do the rest.

          All nature seemed to be aware
          That something strange was stirring there.
          The owl to-whooed, the raven croaked;
          The mink and rat with caution poked
          Their heads above the wave, aghast;
          While frogs a look of wonder cast
          And held their breath till all had passed.
          As every stream will show a bend,
          If one explores from end to end,

   

   

          So every river, great and small,
          Must have its rapids and its fall;
          And those who on its surface glide
          O'er rough as well as smooth must ride.
          The stream whereon had started out
          The Brownie band in gleeful rout

   

          Was wild enough to please a trout.
          At times it tumbled on its way
          O'er shelving rocks and bowlders gray
          At times it formed from side to side
          A brood of whirlpools deep and wide
          That with each other seemed to vie
          As fated objects drifted nigh.
          Ere long each watchful Brownie there,
          Of all these facts grew well aware;
          Some losing faith, as people will,
          In their companions' care or skill,
          Would seize the paddle for a time,

   

          Until a disapproving chime
          Of voices made them rest their hand,
          And let still others take command.
          But, spite of current, whirl or go,
          In spite of hungry tribes below,--

   

          The eel, the craw-fish, leech, and pout,
          That watched them from the starting out,
          And thought each moment flitting by
          Might spill them out a year's supply,--
          The Brownies drifted onward still;
          And though confusion baffled skill,
          Canoes throughout the trying race
          Kept right side up in every case.
          But sport that traveled hand in hand
          With horrors hardly pleased the band,
          As pallid cheek and popping eye
          On every side could testify;
          And all agreed that wisdom lay
          In steering home without delay.

          So landing quick, the boats they tied
          To roots or trees as chance supplied,
          And plunging in the woods profound,
          They soon were lost to sight and sound.

   


          THE Brownies heard the news with glee,
          That in a city near the sea
          A spacious building was designed
          For holding beasts of every kind.
          From polar snows, from desert sand,
          From mountain peak, and timbered land,
          The beasts with claw and beasts with hoof,
          All met beneath one slated roof.

   

          That night, like bees before the wind,
          With home in sight, and storm behind,
          The band of Brownies might be seen,
          All scudding from the forest green.
          Less time it took the walls to scale
          Than is required to tell the tale.
          The art that makes the lock seem weak,
          The bolt to slide, the hinge to creak,
          Was theirs to use as heretofore,
          With good effect, on sash and door;
          And soon the band stood face to face
          With all the wonders of the place.
          To Brownies, as to children dear,
          The monkey seemed a creature queer;
          They watched its skill to climb and cling,
          By either toe or tail to swing;
          Perhaps they got some hints that might
          Come well in hand some future night,
          When climbing up a wall or tree,
          Or chimney, as the case might be.

          Then off to other parts they'd range
          To gather 'round some creature strange;
          To watch the movements of the bear,
          Or at the spotted serpents stare.
          Around the sleeping lion long
          They stood an interested throng,
          Debating o'er its strength of limb,
          Its heavy mane or visage grim.

   

   

          The mammoth turtle from its pen
          Was driven 'round and 'round again,
          And though the coach proved rather slow
          They kept it hours upon the go.
          Said one, "Before your face and eyes
          I'll take that snake from where it lies,
          And like a Hindoo of the East,
          Benumb and charm the crawling beast,
          Then twist him 'round me on the spot
          And tie him in a sailor's knot."
          Another then was quick to shout,
          "We'll leave that snake performance out!
          I grant you all the power you claim
          To charm, to tie, to twist and tame;
          But let me still suggest you try
          Your art when no one else is nigh.
          Of all the beasts that creep or crawl
          From Rupert's Land to China's wall,
          In torrid, mild, or frigid zone,
          The snake is best to let alone."

          Against this counsel, seeming good,
          At least a score of others stood.
          Said one, "My friend, suppress alarm;
          There's nothing here to threaten harm.
          Be sure the power that mortals hold
          Is not denied the Brownies bold."

   

          So, harmlessly as silken bands
          The snakes were twisted in their hands.
          Some hauled them freely 'round the place;
          Some braided others in a trace;
          And every knot to sailors known,
          Was quickly tied, and quickly shown.

          Thus, 'round from cage to cage they went,
          For some to smile, and some comment
          On Nature's way of dealing out
          To this a tail, to that a snout

   

          Of extra length, and then deny
          To something else a fair supply.
          --But when the bear and tiger growled,
          And wolf and lynx in chorus howled,
          And starting from its broken sleep,
          The lion rose with sudden leap,
          And, bounding 'round the rocking cage,
          With lifted mane, roared loud with rage,
          And thrust its paws between the bars,
          Until it seemed to shake the stars,--

   

          A panic seized the Brownies all,
          And out they scampered from the hall,
          As if they feared incautious men
          Had built too frail a prison pen.






          ONE night the circus was in town
          With tumbling men and painted clown,
          And Brownies came from forest deep
          Around the tent to climb and creep,
          And through the canvas, as they might
          Of inner movements gain a sight.

   

   

          Said one, "A chance we'll hardly find
          That better suits the Brownie mind;
          To-night when all this great array
          Of people take their homeward way,
          We'll promptly make a swift descent
          And take possession of the tent,
          And here, till morning light is shown,
          We'll have a circus of our own."
          "I best," cried one, "of all the band
          The elephant can take in hand;
          I noticed how they led him round
          And marked the place he may be found;
          On me you may depend to keep
          The monster harmless as a sheep."

          The laughing crowd that filled the place,
          Had hardly homeward turned its face,
          Before the eager waiting band
          Took full possession as they planned,
          And 'round they scampered left and right

   

          To see what offered most delight.
          Cried one, "If I can only find
          The whip, I'll have a happy mind;

   

          For I'll be master of the ring
          And keep the horses on the spring,
          Announce the names of those who ride,
          And snap the whip on every side."
          Another said, "I'll be a clown;
          I saw the way they tumble down,
          And how the cunning rogues contrive
          To always keep the fun alive."

   

          With such remarks away they went
          At this or that around the tent;
          The wire that not an hour before
          The Japanese had traveled o'er
          From end to end with careful stride,
          Was hunted up and quickly tried.
          Not one alone upon it stepped,
          But up by twos and threes they crept,
          Until the strand appeared to bear
          No less than half the Brownies there.
          Some showed an easy, graceful pose,
          But some put little faith in toes,
          And thought that fingers, after all,
          Are best if one begins to fall.

          When weary of a sport they grew,
          Away to other tricks they flew.
          They rode upon the rolling ball
          Without regard to slip or fall;
          Both up and down the steep incline
          They kept their place, with balance fine,
          Until it bounded from the road,
          And whirled away without its load.
          They galloped 'round the dusty ring
          Without a saddle, strap or string,
          And jumped through hoops both large and small,
          And over banners, poles and all.

          In time the elephant was found
          And held as though in fetters bound;
          Their mystic power controlled the beast,--
          He seemed afraid to move the least,
          But filled with wonder, limp and lax,
          He stood and trembled in his tracks,
          While all the band from first to last
          Across his back in order passed.

   

   

          So thus they saw the moments fly
          Till dawn began to paint the sky;
          And then by every flap and tear
          They made their way to open air,
          And off through lanes and alleys passed
          To reach their hiding-place at last.





   

          ONE evening, from a shaded spot,
          The Brownies viewed a level lot
          Where clubs from different cities came
          To play the nation's favorite game.

          Then spoke a member of the band:

   

   

          "This game extends throughout the land;
          No city, town, or village 'round,
          But has its club, and diamond ground,
          With bases marked, and paths between,
          And seats for crowds to view the scene.
          At other games we've not been slow
          Our mystic art and skill to show;
          Let's take our turn at ball and bat,
          And prove ourselves expert at that."

          Another answered: "I have planned
          A method to equip our band.
          There is a firm in yonder town,
          Whose goods have won them wide renown;
          Their special branch of business lies
          In sending forth these club supplies.
          The balls are wound as hard as stones,
          The bats are turned as smooth as bones,
          And masks are made to guard the nose
          Of him who fears the batter's blows,

   

   

          Or stops the pitcher's curves and throws.
          To know the place such goods to find,
          Is quite enough for Browny-kind!"

   

   

          When hungry bats came forth to wheel
          'Round eaves and find their evening meal,
          The cunning Brownies sought the store,
          To work their way through sash and door.
          And soon their beaming faces told
          Success had crowned their efforts bold.
          A goodly number of the throng
          Took extra implements along,

   

          In case of mishap on the way,
          Or loss, or breakage during play.
          The night was clear, the road was good,
          And soon within the field they stood.

          Then games were played without a pause,
          According to the printed laws.
          There, turn about, each took his place
          At first or third or second base,

   

          At left or right or center field.
          To pitch, to catch, or bat to wield,
          Or else as "short-stop" standing by
          To catch a "grounder" or a "fly."

   

          Soon every corner of the ground
          Its separate set of players found.
          A dozen games upon the green,
          With ins and outs might there be seen;
          The umpires noting all with care
          To tell if hits were foul or fair,

   

          The "strikes" and "balls" to plainly shout,
          And say if men were "safe" or "out,"
          And give decision just and wise
          When knotty questions would arise.

   

          But many Brownies thought it best
          To leave the sport and watch the rest;
          And from the seats or fences high
          They viewed the scene with anxious eye
          And never failed, the contest through,
          To render praise when praise was due.

   

          While others, freed from games on hand,
          In merry groups aside would stand,
          And pitch and catch with rarest skill
          To keep themselves in practice still.

   

          Now "double plays" and balls well curved
          And "base hits" often were observed,
          While "errors" were but seldom seen
          Through all the games upon that green.
          Before the flush of morn arose
          To bring their contests to a close,
          The balls and bats in every case
          Were carried back and put in place;
          And when the Brownies left the store,
          All was in order as before.





   

                          WHILE Brownies once were rambling through
                          A forest where tall timber grew,
                          The hum of bees above their head
                          To much remark and wonder led.
                  They gazed at branches in the air
                  And listened at the roots with care,
                  And soon a pine of giant size
                  Was found to hold the hidden prize.
          Said one: "Some wild bees here have made
          Their home within the forest shade,
          Where neither fox nor prying bear
          Can steal the treasure gathered there."
                  Another spoke: "You're quick and bright,
                  And as a rule judge matters right;
                  But here, my friend, you're all astray,
                  And like the blind mole grope your way.
                  I chance well to remember still,
                  How months ago, when up the hill,
          A farmer near, with bell and horn,
          Pursued a swarm one sunny morn.
          The fearful din the town awoke,
          The clapper from his bell he broke;
          But still their queen's directing cry

   

          The bees heard o'er the clamor high;
          And held their bearing for this pine
          As straight as runs the county line.
          With taxes here, and failures there,
          The man can ill such losses bear.
          In view of this, our duty's clear:
          To-morrow night we'll muster here,
          And when we give this tree a fall,
          In proper shape we'll hive them all,
          And take the queen and working throng
          And lazy drones where they belong."

          Next evening, at the time they'd set,
          Around the pine the Brownies met
          With tools collected, as they sped
          From mill and shop and farmer's shed;
          While some, to all their wants alive,
          With ready hands procured a hive.

          Ere work began, said one: "I fear
          But little sport awaits us here.
          Be sure a trying task we'll find;
          The bee is fuss and fire combined.
          Let's take him in his drowsy hour,
          Or when palavering to the flower.
          For bees, however wild or tame,
          In all lands are about the same;
          And those will rue it who neglect
          To treat the buzzer with respect."

   

          Ere long, by steady grasp and blow,
          The towering tree was leveled low;
          And then the hive was made to rest
          In proper style above the nest,
          Until the queen and all her train
          Did full and fair possession gain.

   

   

          Then 'round the hive a sheet was tied,
          That some were thoughtful to provide,
          And off on poles, as best they could,
          They bore the burden from the wood.

   

          But trouble, as one may divine,
          Occurred at points along the line.

          'Twas bad enough on level ground,
          Where, now and then, _one_ exit found;

   

          But when the Brownies lacked a road,
          Or climbed the fences with their load,--
          Then numbers of the prisoners there
          Came trooping out to take the air,
          And managed straight enough to fly
          To keep excitement running high.

   

          With branches broken off to suit,
          And grass uplifted by the root,
          In vain some daring Brownies tried
          To brush the buzzing plagues aside.
          Said one, whose features proved to all
          That bees had paid his face a call:
          "I'd rather dare the raging main
          Than meddle with such things again."
          "The noble voice," another cried,
          "Of duty still must rule and guide,--
          Or in the ditch the sun would see
          The tumbled hive for all of me."

          And when at last the fence they found
          That girt the farmer's orchard 'round,
          And laid the hive upon the stand,
          There hardly was, in all the band,
          A single Brownie who was free
          From some reminders of the bee.

          But thoughts of what a great surprise
          Ere long would light the farmer's eyes
          Soon drove away from every brain
          The slightest thought of toil or pain.

   

   



   

          THE Brownies planned at close of day
          To reach a town some miles away,
          Where roller skating, so 'twas said,
          Of all amusements kept ahead.
          Said one: "When deeper shadows fall,
          We'll cross the river, find the hall,

   

          And learn the nature of the sport
          Of which we hear such good report."

          To reach the bridge that led to town,
          With eager steps they hastened down;
          But recent rains had caused a rise--
          The stream was now a fearful size;
          The bridge was nearly swept away,
          Submerged in parts, and wet with spray.

          But when the cunning Brownies get
          Their mind on some maneuver set,
          Nor wind nor flood, nor frost nor fire
          Can ever make the rogues retire.

          Some walked the dripping logs with ease,
          While others crept on hands and knees
          With movements rather safe than fast,
          And inch by inch the danger passed.

   

          Now, guided by the rumbling sound
          That told where skaters circled 'round,
          Through dimly lighted streets they flew,
          And close about the building drew.

          Without delay the active band,
          By spouts and other means at hand,
          Of skill and daring furnished proof
          And gained possession of the roof;
          Then through the skylight viewed the show
          Presented by the crowds below.

   

          Said one: "While I survey that floor
          I'm filled with longing more and more,

   

          And discontent with me will bide
          Till 'round the rink I smoothly glide.
          At night I've ridden through the air,
          Where bats abide, and owls repair;
          I've rolled in surf of ocean wide,
          And coasted down the mountain-side;
          And now to sweep around a hall
          On roller skates would crown it all."

          "My plans," the leader answer made,
          "Are in my mind already laid.
          Within an hour the folk below
          Will quit their sport and homeward go;

   

          Then will the time be ripe, indeed,
          For us to leave this roof with speed,
          And prove how well our toes and heels
          We may command when set on wheels."

          When came the closing hour at last,
          And people from the rink had passed,
          The Brownies hurried down to find
          The roller skates they'd left behind.

          Then such a scene was there as few
          May ever have a chance to view.
          Some hardly circled 'round the place,
          Before they moved with ease and grace,
          And skated freely to and fro,
          Upon a single heel or toe.
          Some coats were torn beyond repair,
          By catches here and clutches there,
          When those who felt their faith give way,
          Groped right and left without delay;

   

          While some who strove their friends to aid,
          Upon the floor themselves were laid,
          To spread confusion there awhile,
          As large and larger grew the pile.

   

          Some rose with fingers out of joint,
          Or black and blue at every point;

   

          And few but felt some portion sore,
          From introductions to the floor.
          But such mishaps were lost to sight,
          Amid the common wild delight,--
          For little plaint do Brownies make
          O'er bump or bruise or even break.

          But stars at length began to wane,
          And dawn came creeping through the pane;
          And much against the will of all,
          The rogues were forced to leave the hall.





   

          WITHIN a forest dark and wide,
          Some distance from the ocean side,
          A band of Brownies played around
          On mossy stone or grassy mound,
          Or, climbing through the branching tree,
          Performed their antics wild and free.

   

          When one, arising in his place
          With sparkling eyes and beaming face
          Soon won attention from the rest,
          And thus the listening throng addressed:
          "For years and years, through heat and cold,
          Our home has been this forest old;
          The saplings which we used to bend
          Now like a schooner's masts ascend.

   

          Yet here we live, content to ride
          A springing bough with childish pride,
          Content to bathe in brook or bog
          Along with lizard, leech, and frog;
          We're far behind the age you'll find
          If once you note the human kind.

   

          The modern youths no longer lave
          Their limbs beneath the muddy wave
          Of meadow pool or village pond,
          But seek the ocean far beyond.
          If pleasure in the sea is found
          Not offered by the streams around,
          The Brownie band at once should haste

   

          These unfamiliar joys to taste;
          No torch nor lantern's ray we'll need
          To show our path o'er dewy mead,
          The ponds and pitfalls in the swale,
          The open ditch, the slivered rail,
          The poison vine and thistle high
          Show clear before the Brownie's eye."
          --Next evening, as their plan they'd laid,
          The band soon gathered in the shade.
          All clustered like a swarm of bees
          They darted from the sheltering trees;
          And straight across the country wide
          Began their journey to the tide.
          And when they neared the beach at last,--
          The stout, the lean, the slow, the fast,--
          'T was hard to say, of all the lot,
          Who foremost reached the famous spot.
          "And now," said one with active mind.
          "What proper garments can we find?
          In bathing costume, as you know,
          The people in the ocean go."

          Another spoke, "For such demands,
          The building large that yonder stands,

   

          As one can see on passing by,
          Is full of garments clean and dry.
          There every fashion, loose or tight,
          We may secure with labor light."

          Though Brownies never carry keys,
          They find an entrance where they please;
          And never do they chuckle more
          Than when some miser bars his door;
          For well they know that, spite of locks,
          Of rings and staples, bolts and blocks,
          Were they inclined to play such prank
          He'd find at morn an empty bank.
          So now the crafty Brownie crew
          Soon brought the bathing-suits to view;
          Some, working on the inner side,
          The waiting throng without supplied.--

   

          'Twas busy work, as may be guessed,
          Before the band was fully dressed;
          Some still had cloth enough to lend,
          Though shortened up at either end;
          Sortie ran about to find a pin,
          While others rolled, and puckered in,

   

          And made the best of what they found,
          However strange it hung around.

          Then, when a boat was manned with care
          To watch for daring swimmers there,--

   

          Lest some should venture, over-bold,
          And fall a prey to cramp and cold,--
          A few began from piers to leap
          And plunge at once in water deep,
          But more to shiver, shrink, and shout
          As step by step they ventured out;
          While others were content to stay
          In shallow surf, to duck and play
          Along the lines that people laid
          To give the weak and timid aid.

          It was a sight one should behold,
          When o'er the crowd the breakers rolled;--
          One took a header through the wave,
          One floated like a chip or stave,
          While others there, at every plunge,
          Were taking water like a sponge.

   

   

          But while the surf they tumbled through,
          They reckoned moments as they flew,
          And kept in mind their homeward race
          Before the sun should show his face.

   

          For sad and painful is the fate
          Of those who roam abroad too late;
          And well may Brownies bear in mind
          The hills and vales they leave behind,
          When far from native haunts they run,
          As oft they do, in quest of fun.
          But, ere they turned to leave the strand,
          They made a vow with lifted hand
          That every year, when summer's glow
          Had warmed the ocean spread below,
          They'd journey far from grove and glen
          To sport in rolling surf again.

   





   

          ONE evening, with the falling dew,
          Some Brownies 'round a cottage drew.
          Said one: "I've learned the reason why
          We miss the 'Biddy, Biddy!' cry,
          That every morning brought a score
          Of fowls around this cottage door;
          'T is rheumatism most severe
          That keeps the widow prisoned here.
          Her sheep go bleating through the field,
          In quest of salt no herb can yield,
          To early roost the fowls withdraw
          While each bewails an empty craw.
          And sore neglect you may discern
          On every side, where'er you turn.
          If aid come to the widow's need,
          From Brownies' hands it must proceed."
          Another said: "The wool, I know,
          Went through the mill a month ago.
          I saw them when they bore the sack
          Tip yonder hill, a wondrous pack
          That caught the branches overhead,
          And round their heels the gravel spread.
          Her spinning-wheel is lying there
          In fragments quite beyond repair.
          A passing goat, with manners bold,
          Mistook it for a rival old,

   

   

          And knocked it 'round for half an hour
          With all his noted butting power.
          They say it was a striking scene,
          That twilight conflict on the green;
          The wheel was resting on the shed,
          The frame around the garden spread,
          Before the goat had gained his sight,
          And judged the article aright."

   

          A third remarked: "I call to mind
          Another wheel that we may find.
          Though somewhat worn by use and time,
          It seems to be in order prime;
          Now, night is but a babe as yet,
          The dew has scarce the clover wet;
          By running fast and working hard
          We soon can bring it to the yard;
          Then stationed here in open air
          The widow's wool shall be our care."

          This suited all, and soon with zeal
          They started off to find the wheel;
          Their course across the country lay
          Where great obstructions barred the way;
          But Brownies seldom go around
          However rough or wild the ground.

          O'er rocky slope and marshy bed,
          With one accord they pushed ahead,Across
          the tail-race of a mill,
          And through a churchyard on the hill.

          They found the wheel, with head and feet,
          And band and fixtures, all complete;

   

          And soon beneath the trying load
          Were struggling on the homeward road.

          They had some trouble, toil, and care,
          Some hoisting here, and hauling there;

   

          At times, the wheel upon a fence
          Defied them all to drag it thence,
          As though determined to remain
          And serve the farmer, guarding grain.
          But patient head and willing hand
          Can wonders work in every land;
          And cunning Brownies never yield,
          But aye as victors leave the field.

          Some ran for sticks, and some for pries,
          And more for blocks on which to rise,
          That every hand or shoulder there,
          In such a pinch might do its share.

          Before the door they set the wheel,
          And near at hand the winding reel,
          That some might wind while others spun,
          And thus the task be quickly done.

          No time was wasted, now, to find
          What best would suit each hand or mind.
          Some through the cottage crept about
          To find the wool and pass it out;
          With some to turn, and some to pull,
          And some to shout, "The spindle's full!"
          The wheel gave out a droning song,--
          The work in hand was pushed along.

   

          Their mode of action and their skill
          With wonder might a spinster fill;
          For out across the yard entire
          They spun the yarn like endless wire,--
          Beyond the well with steady haul,
          Across the patch of beans and all,
          Until the walls, or ditches wide,
          A greater stretch of wool denied.

          The widow's yarn was quickly wound
          In tidy balls, quite large and round.

   

   

          And ere the night began to fade,
          The borrowed wheel at home was laid;
          And none the worse for rack or wear,
          Except a blemish here and there,
          A spindle bent, a broken band,--
          'T was ready for the owner's hand.

   





   

          ONE night, a restless Brownie band
          Resolved to leave their native strand,
          And visit islands fair and green,
          That in the distance might be seen.

          In answer to a summons wide,
          The Brownies came from every side--
          A novel spectacle they made,
          All mustered in the forest shade.
          With working implements they came,
          Of every fashion, use, and name.

          Said one, "How many times have we
          Surveyed those islands in the sea,
          And longed for means to thither sail
          And ramble over hill and vale!

   

          That pleasure rare we may command,
          Without the aid of human hand.
          And ere the faintest streak of gray
          Has advertised the coming day,
          A sturdy craft, both tough and tall,
          With masts and halyards, shrouds and all,
          With sails to spread, and helm to guide,
          Completed from the ways shall glide.
          So exercise your mystic power
          And make the most of every hour!"

          With axes, hammers, saws, and rules,
          Dividers, squares, and boring tools,
          The active Brownies scattered 'round,
          And every one his labor found.
          Some fell to chopping down the trees,
          And some to hewing ribs and knees;
          While more the ponderous keelson made,
          And fast the shapely hull was laid.
          Then over all they clambered soon,
          Like bees around their hive in June.
          'T was hammer, hammer, here and there,
          And rip and racket everywhere,

   

   

          While some were spiking planks and beams,
          The calkers stuffed the yawning seams,
          And poured the resin left and right,
          To make her stanch and water-tight.
          Some busily were bringing nails,
          And bolts of canvas for the sails,
          And coils of rope of every size
          To make the ratlines, shrouds, and guys.
          It mattered little whence it came,
          Or who a loss of stock might claim;
          Supply kept even with demand,
          Convenient to the rigger's hand.

          'T was marvelous to see how fast
          The vessel was together cast;
          Until, with all its rigs and stays,
          It sat prepared to leave the ways.
          It but remained to name it now,
          And break a bottle on the bow,
          To knock the wedges from the side,
          And from the keel, and let it slide.

   

          And when it rode upon the sea,
          The Brownies thronged the deck with glee,
          And veering 'round in proper style,
          They bore away for nearest isle.

   

          But those who will the ocean brave
          Should be prepared for wind and wave
          For storms will rise, as many know,
          When least we look for squall or blow
          And soon the sky was overcast,
          And waves were running high and fast;

   

          Then some were sick and some were filled
          With fears that all their ardor chilled;
          But, as when dangers do assail
          The humankind, though some may quail,
          There will be found a few to face
          The danger, and redeem the race,--

   

          So, some brave Brownies nobly stood
          And manned the ship as best they could.
          Some staid on deck to sound for bars;
          Some went aloft to watch for stars;
          And some around the rudder hung,
          And here and there the vessel swung,
          While, others, strung on yard and mast,
          Kept shifting sails to suit the blast.

          At times, the bow was high in air,
          And next the stern was lifted there.

   

          So thus it tumbled, tossed, and rolled,
          And shipped enough to fill the hold,
          Till more than once it seemed as though
          To feed the fish they all must go.

   

          But still they bravely tacked and veered,
          And hauled, and reefed, and onward steered;
          While screaming birds around them wheeled,
          As if to say: "Your doom is sealed";
          And hungry gar and hopeful shark
          In shoals pursued the creaking bark,
          Still wondering how it braved a gale
          That might have made Columbus pale.

          The rugged island, near them now,
          Was looming on their starboard bow;
          But knowing not the proper way
          Of entering its sheltered bay,
          They simply kept their canvas spread,
          And steered the vessel straight ahead.
          The birds were distanced in the race;
          The gar and shark gave up the chase,
          And turning back, forsook the keel,
          And lost their chances of a meal.

          For now the ship to ruin flew,
          As though it felt its work was through,
          And soon it stranded, "pitch and toss,"
          Upon the rocks, a total loss.
          The masts and spars went by the board--
          The hull was shivered like a gourd!
          But yet, on broken plank and rail,
          On splintered spars and bits of sail
          That strewed for miles the rugged strand,
          The Brownies safely reached the land.

   

          Now, Brownies lack the power, 'tis said,
          Of making twice what once they've made;
          So all their efforts were in vain
          To build and launch the ship again;--
          And on that island, roaming 'round,
          That Brownie band for years was found.





          ONCE while the Brownies lay at ease
          About the roots of rugged trees,
          And listened to the dreary moan
          Of tides around their island lone
          Said one: "My friends, unhappy here,
          We spend our days from year to year
          We're cornered in, and hardly boast
          A run of twenty leagues at most
          You all remember well, I ween,
          The night we reached this island green,
          When flocks of fowl around us wailed,
          And followed till their pinions failed.
          And still our ship at every wave
          To sharks a creaking promise gave,
          Then spilled us out in breakers white,
          To gain the land as best we might.
          Since then how oft we've tried in vain
          To reach our native haunts again,
          Where roaming freely, unconfined,
          Would better suit our roving mind.

          "To-night, while wandering by the sea
          A novel scheme occurred to me,
          As I beheld in groups and rows
          The weary fowl in deep repose.
          They sat as motionless as though
          The life had left them years ago.
          The albatross and crane are there,
          The loon, the gull, and gannet rare.
          An easy task for us to creep
          Around the fowl, while fast asleep.
          And at a given signal spring
          Aboard, before they spread a wing,
          And trust to them to bear us o'er.
          In safety to our native shore."

          Another spoke: "I never yet
          Have shunned a risk that others met,
          But here uncommon dangers lie,
          Suppose the fowl should seaward fly,
          And never landing, course about,
          And drop us, when their wings gave out?"

          To shallow schemes that will not bring
          A modest risk, let cowards cling!
          The first replied. "A Brownie shows
          The best where dangers thickest close.
          But, hear me out: by sea and land,
          Their habits well I understand.
          When rising first they circle wide,
          As though the strength of wings they tried,
          Then steering straight across the bay,
          To yonder coast a visit pay.
          But granting they for once should be
          Inclined to strike for open sea,
          The breeze that now is rising fast,
          Will freshen to a whistling blast,
          And landward sweeping, stronger still,
          Will drive the fowl against their will."

   

          Now at his heels, with willing feet,
          They followed to the fowls' retreat.
          'Twas hard to scale the rugged breast
          Of crags, where birds took nightly rest.
          But some on hands, and some on knees,
          And more by vines or roots of trees,
          From shelf to shelf untiring strained,
          And soon the windy summit gained.
          With bated breath, they gathered round;
          They crawled with care along the ground.
          By this, one paused; or that, one eyed;
          Each chose the bird he wished to ride.

   

          When all had done the best they could,
          And waiting for the signal stood,
          It hardly took a moment's space
          For each to scramble to his place.

   

          Some seized a neck and some a head,
          And some a wing, and some a shred
          Of tail, or aught that nearest lay,
          To help them mount without delay.
          Then rose wild flaps and piercing screams,
          As sudden starting from their dreams
          The wondering fowl in sore dismay
          Brought wings and muscles into play.
          Some felt the need of longer sleep,
          And hardly had the strength to "cheep;"
          While others seemed to find a store
          Of screams they'd never found before
          --But off like leaves or flakes of snow
          Before the gale the Brownies go,
          Away, away, through spray or cloud
          As fancy led, or load allowed.
          Some birds to poor advantage showed,
          As, with an oddly balanced load,
          Now right or left at random cast,

   

          They flew, the sport of every blast;
          While fish below had aching eyes
          With gazing upward at the prize.
          They followed still from mile to mile,
          Believing fortune yet would smile;
          While plainer to the Brownies grew
          The hills and vales that well they knew.
          "I see," said one, who, from his post
          Between the wings, could view the coast,
          "The lofty peaks we used to climb

   

          To gaze upon the scene sublime."
          A second cried: "And there's the bay
          From which our vessel bore away!"
          "And I," another cried, "can see
          The shady grove, the very tree
          We met beneath the night we planned
          To build a ship and leave the land!"

          All in confusion now at last,
          The birds upon the shore were cast.
          Some, tumbling through thick branches, fell
          And spilled the load that clung so well.
          Some, "topsy-turvy" to the ground,
          Dispersed their riders all around;
          And others still could barely get
          To shores where land and water met.

          Congratulations then began,
          As here and there the Brownies ran,

   

          To learn if all had held their grip
          And kept aboard throughout the trip.
          "And now," said one, "that all are o'er
          In safety to our native shore,
          You see, so wasted is the night,
          Orion's belt is out of sight;
          And ere the lamp of Venus fades
          We all must reach the forest shades.






   

          AS mists of evening deeper grew,
          The Brownies 'round a comrade drew,
          An interesting tale to hear
          About a village lying near.
                  "Last night," said he, "I heard arise
                  From many throats discordant cries.
                  At once I followed up the sound,
                  And soon, to my amazement, found
                  It issued from a building small
                  That answered for the county hall.

          "I listened there around the door,
          By village time, an hour or more;
          Until I learned beyond a doubt
          A singing-school caused all the rout.
          Some, like the hound, would keep ahead,
          And others seemed to lag instead.
          Some singers, struggling with the tune,
          Outscreamed the frightened northern loon.
          Some mocked the pinched or wheezing cry
          Of locusts when the wheat is nigh,
          While grumbling bassos shamed the strain
          Of bull-frogs calling down the rain."

          The Brownies labor heart and hand
          All mysteries to understand;
          And if you think those Brownies bold
          Received the news so plainly told,
          And thought no more about the place,
          You're not familiar with the race.

   

          When scholars next their voices tried,
          The Brownies came from every side;
          With ears to knot-holes in the wall,
          To door-jambs, thresholds, blinds, and all,
          They listened to the jarring din
          Proceeding from the room within.

   

          Said one at length, "It seems to me
          The master here will earn his fee,
          If he from such a crowd can bring
          A single person trained to sing."
          Another said, "We'll let them try
          Their voices till their throats are dry,
          And when for home they all depart,
          We'll not be slow to test our art."

          That night the Brownies cheered to find
          The music had been left behind;
          And when they stood within the hall,
          And books were handed 'round to all,
          They pitched their voices, weak or strong,
          At solemn verse and lighter song.

  : John-ny Mor-gan play'd the organ, The father beat the
drum, The sis-ter play'd the tam-bou-rine. 

          Some sought a good old hymn to try;
          Some grappled with a lullaby;
          A few a painful effort made
          To struggle through a serenade;
          While more preferred the lively air
          That, hinting less of love or care,
          Possessed a chorus kind and bright
          In which they all could well unite.
          At times some member tried to rule,
          And took control of all the school;
          But soon, despairing, was content
          To let them follow out their bent.

          They sung both high and low, the same,
          As fancy led or courage came.

   

          Some droned the tune through teeth or nose,
          Some piped like quail, or cawed like crows
          That, hungry, wait the noonday horn
          To call the farmer from his corn.
          By turns at windows some would stay
          To note the signs of coming day.
          At length the morning, rising, spread
          Along the coast her streaks of red,
          And drove the Brownies from the place
          To undertake the homeward race.

          But many members of the band
          Still kept their singing-books in hand,
          Determined not with those to part
          Till they were perfect in the art.
          And oft in leafy forest shade,
          In after times, a ring they made,
          To pitch the tune, and raise the voice,
          To sing the verses of their choice,
          And scare from branches overhead
          The speckled thrush and robin red,
          And make them feel the time had come
          When singing birds might well be dumb.

   



          ONE night while snow was lying deep
          On level plain and mountain steep,
          A sheltered nook the Brownies found,
          Where conversation might go 'round.
          Said one: "The people hereabout
          Their wood supply have taken out;
          But while they stripped the timber lot,
          The village parson they forgot.

   

          Now that good man, the story goes,
          As best he can, must warm his toes."
          Another spoke: "The way is clear
          To show both skill and courage here.
          You're not the sort, I know, to shirk:
          And coward-like to flee from work.
          You act at once whene'er you find
          A chance to render service kind,
          Nor wait to see what others do
          In matters that appeal to you.

          "This task in waiting must be done
          Before another day has run.
          The signs of change are in the air;
          A storm is near though skies are fair;
          As oft when smiles the broadest lie,
          The tears are nearest to the eye.
          To work let every Brownie bend,
          And prove to-night the parson's friend.
          We'll not take oxen from the stall,
          That through the day must pull and haul,
          Nor horses from the manger lead;
          But let them take the rest they need.
          Since mystic power is at our call,
          By our own selves we'll do it all.
          Our willing arms shall take the place
          Of clanking chain and leathern trace,
          And 'round the door the wood we'll strew
          Until we hide the house from view."

          At once the Brownies sought the ground
          Where fuel could with ease be found,--
          A place where forest-fires had spread,
          And left the timber scorched and dead.
          And there throughout the chilly night
          They tugged and tore with all their might;
          Some bearing branches as their load;
          With lengthy poles still others strode,

   

          Or struggled till they scarce could see,
          With logs that bent them like a V;
          While more from under drifts of snow
          Removed old trees, and made them go
          Like plows along the icy street,
          With half their limbs and roots complete.
          Some found it hard to train their log
          To keep its place through jolt and jog,
          While some, mistaking ditch for road,
          Were almost buried with their load,
          And but for friends and promptest care,
          The morning light had found them there.

   

          The wind that night was cold and keen,
          And frosted Brownies oft were seen.
          They clapped their hands and stamped their toes,
          They rubbed with snow each numbing nose,
          And drew the frost from every face
          Before it proved a painful case.

   

   

          And thus, in spite of every ill,
          The task was carried forward still.
          Some were by nature well designed
          For work of this laborious kind,
          And never felt so truly great,
          As when half crushed beneath a weight.
          While wondering comrades stood aghast,
          And thought each step must be the last.

          But some were slight and ill could bear
          The heavy loads that proved their share,

   

          Though at some sport or cunning plan
          They far beyond their comrades ran.

          Around the house some staid to pile
          The gathered wood in proper style;
          Which ever harder work they found
          As high and higher rose the mound.

          Above the window-sill it grew,
          And next, the cornice hid from view;
          And, ere the dawn had forced a stop,
          The pile o'erlooked the chimney-top.

          Some hands were sore, some backs were blue,
          And legs were scraped with slipping through
          Where ice and snow had left their mark
          On rounded log and smoothest bark.

          That morning, when the parson rose,
          Against the pane he pressed his nose,
          And tried the outer world to scan
          To learn how signs of weather ran.

          But, 'round the house, behind, before,
          In front of window, shed, and door,
          The wood was piled to such a height
          But little sky was left in sight!

   

          When next he climbed his pulpit stair,
          He touched upon the strange affair,
          And asked a blessing rich to fall
          Upon the heads and homes of all
          Who through the night had worked so hard
          To heap the fuel 'round the yard.
          His hearers knew they had no claim
          To such a blessing if it came,
          But whispered: "We don't understand--
          It must have been the Brownie Band."

   




          WHEN Independence Day was nigh,
          And children laid their pennies by,
          Arranging plans how every cent
          Should celebrate the grand event,
          The Brownies in their earnest way
          Expressed themselves about the day.
          Said one: "The time is drawing near--
          To every freeman's heart so dear--
          When citizens throughout the land,
          From Western slope to Eastern strand,

   

          Will celebrate with booming gun
          Their liberties so dearly won!"

          "A fitting time," another cried,
          "For us, who many sports have tried,

   

          To introduce our mystic art
          And in some manner play a part."
          A third replied, with beaming face:
          "Trust me to lead you to a place
          Where fireworks of every kind
          Are made to suit the loyal mind.

          "There, Roman candles are in store,
          And bombs that like a cannon roar;
          While 'round the room one may behold
          Designs of every size and mold,--
          The wheels that turn, when all ablaze,
          And scatter sparks a thousand ways;
          The eagle bird, with pinions spread;
          The busts of statesmen ages dead;
          And him who led his tattered band
          Against invaders of the land
          Until he shook the country free
          From grasp of kings beyond the sea.

          "We may, from this supply, with ease
          Secure a share whene'er we please;
          And on these hills behind the town
          That to the plain go sloping down,

   

          We'll take position, come what may,
          And celebrate the Nation's Day."

          That eve, when stars began to shine,
          The eager band was formed in line,
          And, acting on the plans well laid,
          A journey to the town was made.

          The Brownies never go astray,
          However puzzling is the way;
          With guides before and guards behind,
          They cut through every turn and wind,
          Until a halt was made at last
          Before a building bolted fast.
          But those who think they'd turn around
          And leave because no keys are found
          Should entertain the thought no more,
          But study up the Brownie lore.

          They rummaged boxes piled around
          And helped themselves to what they found,
          Some eager to secure the wheel
          That would so many sparks reveal.
          Some active members of the band
          To bombs and crackers turned their hand,
          While more those emblems sought to find
          That call the Nation's birth to mind,
          And bring from every side the shout
          When all their meaning blazes out.

   

          Ere long, upon the homeward road
          They hastened with their novel load:
          And when the bell in chapel tower
          Gave notice of the midnight hour,
          The ruddy flame, the turning wheel,
          The showering sparks and deafening peal
          Showed Brownies in the proper way
          Gave welcome to the glorious day.

   

          The lighted eagles, through the night,
          Looked down like constellations bright;
          The rockets, whizzing to and fro,
          Lit up the slumbering town below;
          While, towering there with eyes of fire,
          As when he made his foes retire,
          Above all emblems duly raised,
          The Father of his Country blazed.

          But ere the Brownies' large supply
          Had gone to light the summer sky,
          Some plasters would have served the band
          Much better than the goods on hand;
          For there were cases all about
          Where Brownies thought the fuse was out,
          Till with a sudden fizz and flare
          It caught the jokers unaware.

          At times, in spite of warning cries,
          Some proved too slow at closing eyes;
          Some ears were stunned, some noses got
          Too close to something quick and hot,
          And fingers bore for days and weeks
          The trace of hasty powder's freaks.

          Some dodging 'round would get a share
          Of splendor meant for upper air,
          And with a black or speckled face
          They ran about from place to place,
          To find new dangers blaze and burn
          On every side where'er they'd turn.

          But few were there who felt afraid
          Of bursting bomb or fusillade,
          And to the prize they'd stick and hang
          Until it vanished with a "bang,"
          Or darting upward seemed to fly
          On special business to the sky.

   

   

          But there, while darkness wrapped the hill,
          The Brownies celebrated still;
          For, pleasures such as this they found
          But seldom in their roaming 'round;
          And with reluctant feet they fled
          When morning tinged the sky with red.

   



          AS shades of evening settled down,
          The Brownies rambled through the town,
          To pry at this, to pause at that;
          By something else to hold a chat,
          And in their free and easy vein
          Express themselves in language plain.
          At length before a store, their eyes
          Were fixed with wonder and surprise
          On toys of wood, and wax, and tin,
          And toys of rubber piled within.

   

          Said one, "In all our wandering 'round,
          A sight like this we never found.
          When such a passing glimpse we gain,
          What marvels must the shelves contain!"

          Another said, "It must be here
          Old Santa Claus comes every year
          To gather up his large supply,
          When Christmas Eve is drawing nigh,
          That children through the land may find
          They still are treasured in his mind."

          A third remarked, "Ere long he may
          Again his yearly visit pay;
          Before he comes to strip the place,
          We'll rummage shelf, and box, and case,
          Until the building we explore
          From attic roof to basement floor,
          And prove what pleasure may be found
          In all the wonders stowed around."

          Not long were they content to view
          Through dusty panes those wonders new:
          And, in a manner quite their own,
          They made their way through wood and stone.

          And then surprises met the band
          In odd conceits from every land.
          Well might the Brownies stand and stare
          At all the objects crowded there!
          Here, things of gentle nature lay
          In safety, midst the beasts of prey;
          The goose and fox, a friendly pair,
          Reposed beside the lamb and bear;
          There horses stood for boys to ride;
          Here boats were waiting for the tide,

   

          While ships of war, with every sail
          Unfurled, were anchored to a nail;
          There soldiers stood in warlike bands;
          And naked dolls held out their hands,
          As though to urge the passers-by
          To take them from the public eye.
          This way and that, the Brownies ran;
          To try the toys they soon began.

   

          The Jack-in-box, so quick and strong,
          With staring eyes and whiskers long,
          Now o'er and o'er was set and sprung
          Until the scalp was from it flung
          And then they crammed him in his case,
          With wig and night-cap in their place,
          To give some customer a start
          When next the jumper flew apart.
          The trumpets, drums, and weapons bright
          Soon filled them all with great delight.
          Like troops preparing for their foes,
          In single ranks and double rows,

   

          They learned the arts of war, as told
          By printed books and veterans old;
          With swords of tin and guns of wood,
          They wheeled about, and marched or stood,

   

          And went through skirmish drill and all,
          From room to room by bugle-call;
          There Marathon and Waterloo
          And Bunker Hill were fought anew;
          And most of those in war array
          At last went limping from the fray.
          The music-box poured forth an air
          That charmed the dullest spirits there,
          Till, yielding to the pleasing sound,
          They danced with dolls a lively round.

          There fish were working tail and fin
          In seas confined by wood and tin;
          The canvas shark and rubber whale
          Seemed ill content in dish or pail,
          And leaping all obstructions o'er
          Performed their antics on the floor.

          Some found at marbles greatest fun,
          And still they played, and still they won,
          Until they claimed as winners, all
          The shop could furnish, large and small.

   

          More gave the singing tops no rest--
          But kept them spinning at their best
          Until some wonder strange and new
          To other points attention drew.

          The rocking-horse that wildly rose,
          Now on its heels, now on its nose,

   

          Was forced to bear so great a load
          It seemed to founder on the road,
          Then tumble feebly to the floor,
          Never to lift a rocker more.

          No building in the country wide
          With more attractions was supplied.
          No shop or store throughout the land
          Could better suit the Brownie band.
          For when some flimsy toy gave way
          And 'round the room in pieces lay

   

          'Twas hardly missed in such a store,
          With wonders fairly running o'er:
          To something else about the place
          The happy Brownie turned his face,
          And only feared the sun would call
          Before he'd had his sport with all.

          Thus, through the shop in greatest glee,
          They rattled 'round, the sights to see,
          Till stars began to dwindle down,
          And morning crept into the town.
          And then, with all the speed they knew,
          Away to forest shades they flew.

Do you know Mother Nature? She it is to whom God has given the care of
the earth, and all that grows in or upon it, just as he has given to
your mother the care of her family of boys and girls.

You may think that Mother Nature, like the famous "old woman who lived
in the shoe," has so many children that she doesn't know what to do. But
you will know better when you become acquainted with her, and learn how
strong she is, and how active; how she can really be in fifty places at
once, taking care of a sick tree, or a baby flower just born; and, at
the same time, building underground palaces, guiding the steps of little
travellers setting out on long journeys, and sweeping, dusting, and
arranging her great house,--the earth. And all the while, in the midst
of her patient and never-ending work, she will tell us the most charming
and marvellous stories of ages ago when she was young, or of the
treasures that lie hidden in the most distant and secret closets of her
palace; just such stories as you all like so well to hear your mother
tell when you gather round her in the twilight.

A few of these stories which she has told to me, I am about to tell you,
beginning with this one.

I know a little Scotch girl: she lives among the Highlands. Her home is
hardly more than a hut; her food, broth and bread. Her father keeps
sheep on the hillsides; and, instead of wearing a coat, wraps himself in
his plaid, for protection from the cold winds that drive before them
great clouds of mist and snow among the mountains.

As for Jeanie herself (you must be careful to spell her name with an ea,
for that is Scotch fashion), her yellow hair is bound about with a
little snood; her face is browned by exposure to the weather; and her
hands are hardened by work, for she helps her mother to cook and sew, to
spin and weave.

One treasure little Jeanie has which many a lady would be proud to wear.
It is a necklace of amber beads,--"lamour beads," old Elsie calls them;
that is the name they went by when she was young.

You have, perhaps, seen amber, and know its rich, sunshiny color, and
its fragrance when rubbed; and do you also know that rubbing will make
amber attract things somewhat as a magnet does? Jeanie's beads had all
these properties, but some others besides, wonderful and lovely; and it
is of those particularly that I wish to tell you. Each bead has inside
of it some tiny thing, incased as if it had grown in the amber; and
Jeanie is never tired of looking at, and wondering about, them. Here is
one with a delicate bit of ferny moss shut up, as it were, in a globe of
yellow light. In another is the tiniest fly,--his little wings
outspread, and raised for flight. Again, she can show us a bee lodged in
one bead that looks like solid honey, and a little bright-winged beetle
in another. This one holds two slender pine-needles lying across each
other, and here we see a single scale of a pine-cone; while yet another
shows an atom of an acorn-cup, fit for a fairy's use. I wish you could
see the beads, for I cannot tell you the half of their beauty. Now,
where do you suppose they came from, and how did little Scotch Jeanie
come into possession of such a treasure?

All she knows about it is, that her grandfather,--old Kenneth, who
cowers now all day in the chimney-corner,--once, years ago when he was a
young lad, went down upon the seashore after a great storm, hoping to
help save something from the wreck of the "Goshawk," that had gone
ashore during the night; and there among the slippery seaweeds his foot
had accidentally uncovered a clear, shining lump of amber, in which all
these little creatures were embedded. Now, Kenneth loved a pretty
Highland lass; and, when she promised to be his bride, he brought her a
necklace of amber beads. He had carved them himself out of his lump of
amber, working carefully to save in each bead the prettiest insect or
moss, and thinking, while he toiled hour after hour, of the delight with
which he should see his bride wear them. That bride was Jeanie's
grandmother; and when she died last year, she said, "Let little Jeanie
have my lamour beads, and keep them as long as she lives."

But what puzzled Jeanie was, how the amber came to be on the seashore;
and, most of all, how the bees and mosses came inside of it. Should you
like to know? If you would, that is one of Mother Nature's stories, and
she will gladly tell it. Hear what she answers to our questions:--

"I remember a time, long, long before you were born,--long, even, before
any men were living upon the earth; then these Scotch Highlands, as you
call them, where little Jeanie lives, were covered with forests. There
were oaks, poplars, beeches, and pines; and among them one kind of pine,
tall and stately, from which a shining yellow gum flowed, just as you
have seen little drops of sticky gum exude from our own pine-trees. This
beautiful yellow gum was fragrant; and, as the thousands of little
insects fluttered about it in the warm sunshine, they were attracted by
its pleasant odor,--perhaps, too, by its taste,--and once alighted upon
it, they stuck fast, and could not get away; while the great yellow
drops oozing out surrounded, and at last covered, them entirely. So,
too, wind-blown bits of moss, leaves, acorns, cones, and little sticks
were soon securely imbedded in the fast-flowing gum; and, as time went
by, it hardened and hardened more and more. And this is amber."

"That is well told, Mother Nature; but it does not explain how Kenneth's
lump of amber came to be on the seashore."

"Wait, then, for the second part of the story.

"Did you ever hear that, in those very old times, the land sometimes
sank down into the sea, even so deep that the water covered the very
mountain-tops; and then, after ages, it was slowly lifted up again, to
sink indeed, perhaps, yet again and again?

"You can hardly believe it, yet I myself was there to see; and I
remember well when the great forests of the North of Scotland--the oaks,
the poplars, and the amber-pines--were lowered into the deep sea. There,
lying at the bottom of the ocean, the wood and the gum hardened like
stone, and only the great storms can disturb them as they lie half
buried in the sand. It was one of those great storms that brought
Kenneth's lump of amber to land."

If we could only walk on the bottom of the sea, what treasures we might
find!






It is May,--almost the end of May, indeed, and the Mayflowers have
finished their blooming for this year. It is growing too warm for those
delicate violets and hepaticas who dare to brave even March winds, and
can bear snow better than summer heats.

Down at the edge of the pond the tall water-grasses and rushes are
tossing their heads a little in the wind, and swinging a little, lightly
and lazily, with the motion of the water; but the water is almost clear
and still this morning, scarcely rippled, and in its beautiful, broad
mirror reflecting the chestnut-trees on the bank, and the little points
of land that run out from the shore, and give foothold to the old pines
standing guard day and night, summer and winter, to watch up the pond
and down.

Do you think now that you know how the pond looks in the sunshine of
this May morning?

If we come close to the edge where the rushes are growing, and look down
through the clear water, we shall see some uncouth and clumsy black bugs
crawling upon the bottom of the pond. They have six legs, and are
covered with a coat of armor laid plate over plate. It looks hard and
horny; and the insect himself has a dull, heavy way with him, and might
be called very stupid were it not for his eagerness in catching and
eating every little fly and mosquito that comes within his reach. His
eyes grow fierce and almost bright; and he seizes with open mouth, and
devours all day long, if he can find any thing suited to his taste.

I am afraid you will think he is not very interesting, and will not care
to make his acquaintance. But, let me tell you, something very wonderful
is about to happen to him; and if you stay and watch patiently, you will
see what I saw once, and have never forgotten.

Here he is crawling in mud under the water this May morning: out over
the pond shoot the flat water-boatmen, and the water-spiders dance and
skip as if the pond were a floor of glass; while here and there skims a
blue dragon-fly, with his fine, firm wings that look like the thinnest
gauze, but are really wondrously strong for all their delicate
appearance.

The dull, black bug sees all these bright, agile insects; and, for the
first time in his life, he feels discontented with his own low place in
the mud. A longing creeps through him that is quite different from the
customary longing for mosquitoes and flies. "I will creep up the stem of
this rush," he thinks; "and perhaps, when I reach the surface of the
water, I can dart like the little flat boatmen, or, better than all,
shoot through the air like the blue-winged dragon-fly." But, as he
crawls toilsomely up the slippery stem, the feeling that he has no wings
like the dragon-fly makes him discouraged and almost despairing. At
last, however, with much labor he has reached the surface, has crept out
of the water, and, clinging to the green stem, feels the spring air and
sunshine all about him. Now let him take passage with the boatmen, or
ask some of the little spiders to dance. Why doesn't he begin to enjoy
himself?

Alas! see his sad disappointment. After all this toil, after passing
some splendid chances of good breakfasts on the way up, and spending all
his strength on this one exploit, he finds the fresh air suffocating
him, and a most strange and terrible feeling coming over him, as his
coat-of-mail, which until now was always kept wet, shrinks, and seems
even cracking off while the warm air dries it.

"Oh," thinks the poor bug, "I must die! It was folly in me to crawl up
here. The mud and the water were good enough for my brothers, and good
enough for me too, had I only known it; and now I am too weak, and feel
too strangely, to attempt going down again the way I came up."

See how uneasy he grows, feeling about in doubt and dismay, for a
darkness is coming over his eyes. It is the black helmet, a part of his
coat-of-mail; it has broken off at the top, and is falling down over his
face. A minute more, and it drops below his chin; and what is his
astonishment to find, that, as his old face breaks away, a new one comes
in its place, larger, much more beautiful, and having two of the most
admirable eyes!--two, I say, because they look like two, but each of
them is made up of hundreds of little eyes. They stand out globe-like on
each side of his head, and look about over a world unknown and wonderful
to the dull, black bug who lived in the mud. The sky seems bluer, the
sunshine brighter, and the nodding grass and flowers more gay and
graceful. Now he lifts this new head to see more of the great world; and
behold! as he moves, he is drawing himself out of the old suit of armor,
and from two neat little cases at its sides come two pairs of wings,
folded up like fans, and put away here to be ready for use when the
right time should come: still half folded they are, and must be
carefully spread open and smoothed for use. And while he trembles with
surprise, see how with every movement he is escaping from the old armor,
and drawing from their sheaths fine legs, longer and far more
beautifully made and colored than the old; and a slender body that was
packed away like a spy-glass, and is now drawn slowly out, one part
after another; until at last the dark coat-of-mail dangles empty from
the rushes, and above it sits a dragon-fly with great, wondering eyes,
long, slender body, and two pairs of delicate, gauzy wings,--fine and
firm as the very ones he had been watching but an hour ago.

The poor black bug who thought he was dying was only passing out of his
old life to be born into a higher one; and see how much brighter and
more beautiful it is!

And now shall I tell you how, months ago, the mother dragon-fly dropped
into the water her tiny eggs, which lay there in the mud, and by and by
hatched out the dark, crawling bugs, so unlike the mother that she does
not know them for her children, and, flying over the pond, looks down
through the water where they crawl among the rushes, and has not a
single word to say to them; until, in due time, they find their way up
to the air, and pass into the new winged life.

If you will go to some pond when spring is ending or summer beginning,
and find among the water-grasses such an insect as I have told you of,
you may see all this for yourselves; and you will say with me, dear
children, that nothing you have ever known is more wonderful.






How still it is! Nobody in the village street, the children all at
school, and the very dogs sleeping lazily in the sunshine. Only a south
wind blows lightly through the trees, lifting the great fans of the
horse-chestnut, tossing the slight branches of the elm against the sky
like single feathers of a great plume, and swinging out fragrance from
the heavy-hanging linden-blossoms.

Through the silence there is a little murmur, like a low song. It is the
song of the trees: each has its own voice, which may be known from all
others by the ear that has learned how to listen.

The topmost branches of the elm are talking of the sky,--of those
highest white clouds that float like tresses of silver hair in the far
blue, of the sunrise gold and the rose-color of sunset that always rest
upon them most lovingly. But down deep in the heart of the great
branches you may hear something quite different, and not less sweet.

"Peep under my leaves," sings the elm-tree, "out at the ends of my
broadest branches. What hangs there so soft and gray? Who comes with a
flash of wings and gleam of golden breast among the dark leaves, and
sits above the gray hanging nest to sing his full, sweet tune? Who
worked there together so happily all the May-time, with gray honeysuckle
fibres, twining the little nest, until there it hung securely over the
road, bound and tied and woven firmly to the slender twigs? so slender
that the squirrels even cannot creep down for the eggs; much less can
Jack or Neddy, who are so fond of birds'-nesting, ever hope to reach the
home of our golden robin.

"There my leaves shelter him like a roof from rain and from sunshine. I
rock the cradle when the father and mother are away and the little ones
cry, and in my softest tone I sing to them; yet they are never quite
satisfied with me, but beat their wings, and stretch out their heads,
and cannot be happy until they hear their father.

"The squirrel, who lives in the hole where the two great branches part,
hears what I say, and curls up his tail, while he turns his bright eyes
towards the swinging nest which he can never reach."

The fanning wind wafts across the road the voice of the old horse-
chestnut, who also has a word to say about the birds'-nests.

"When my blossoms were fresh, white pyramids, came a swift flutter of
wings about them one day, and a dazzlingly beautiful little bird thrust
his long, delicate bill among the flowers; and while he held himself
there in the air without touching his tiny feet to twig or stem, but
only by the swift fanning of long, green-tinted wings, I offered him my
best flowers for his breakfast, and bowed my great leaves as a welcome
to him. The dear little thing had been here before, while yet the sticky
brown buds which wrap up my leaves had not burst open to the warm
sunshine. He and his mate, whose feather dress was not so fine as his,
gathered the gum from the outside of the buds, and pulled the warm wool
from the inside; and I could watch them as they flew away to the maple
yonder, for then the trees that stand between us had no leaves to hide
the maple, as they do now.

"Back and forth flew the birds from the topmost maple-branch to my
opening buds; and day by day I saw a little nest growing, very small and
round, lined warmly with wool from my buds, and thatched all over the
outside with bits of lichen, gray and green, to match what grew on the
maple-branches about it; and this thatch was glued on with the gum from
my brown buds. When it was finished, it was delicate enough for the
cradle of a little princess, and the outside was so carefully matched to
the tree by lichens, that the sharpest eyes from below could not detect
it. What a safe, snug home for the humming-birds!

"By the time the two tiny eggs were laid, I could no longer see the
nest, for the thick foliage of other trees had built up a green wall
between me and it. But for many days the mother-bird staid away, and the
father came alone to drink honey from my blossom-cups: so I knew that
the eggs were hatching under her warm folded wings, for I have seen such
things before among my own branches in the robins' nests and the
bluebirds'.

"Now my flowers are all gone, and in their place the nuts are growing in
their prickly balls. I have nothing to tempt the humming-bird, and he
never visits me: only the yellow birds hop gayly from branch to branch,
and the robins come sometimes." And the horse-chestnut sighed, for he
missed the humming-bird; and he flapped his great leaves in the very
face of the linden-blossoms, and forgot to say "Excuse me." But the
linden is now, and for many days, full of sweetness, and will not answer
ungraciously even so careless a touch.

Yes, the linden is full of sweetness, and sends out the fragrance from
his blossoms in through the chamber windows, and down upon the people
who pass in the street below. And he tells all the time his story of how
his pink-covered leaf-buds opened in the spring mornings, and unfolded
the fresh green leaves, which were so tender and full of green juices
that it was no wonder the mother-moth had thought the branches a good
place whereon to lay her eggs; for as soon as they should be all laid,
she would die, and there would be no one to provide food for her babies
when they should creep out.

"So the nice mother-moth made a toilsome journey up my great trunk,"
sung the linden, "and left her eggs where she knew the freshest green
leaves would be coming out by the time the young ones should leave the
eggs.

"And they came out indeed, somewhat to my sorrow; for instead of being,
like their mother, sober, well-behaved little moths, they were green
canker-worms, and such hungry little things, that I really began to fear
I should have not a whole leaf left upon me; when one day they spun for
themselves fine silken ropes, and swung themselves down from leaf to
leaf, and from branch to branch, and in a day or two were all gone.

"A little flaxen-haired girl sat on the broad doorstep at my feet, and
caught the canker-worms in her white apron. She liked to see them hump
up their backs, and measure off the inches of her white checked apron
with their little green bodies. And I, although I liked them well enough
at first, was not sorry to lose them when they went. I heard the child's
mother telling her that they had come down to make for themselves beds
in the earth, where they would sleep until the early spring, and wake to
find themselves grown into moths just like their mothers, who climbed up
the tree to lay eggs. We shall see when next spring comes if that is so.
Now, since they went, I have done my best to refresh my leaves, and keep
young and happy; and here are my sweet blossoms to prove that I have yet
within me vigorous life."

The elm-tree heard what the linden sung, and said, "Very true, very
true. I, too, have suffered from the canker-worms; but I have yet leaves
enough left for a beautiful shade, and the poor crawling things must
surely eat something." And the elm bowed gracefully to the linden, out
of sympathy for him.

But the linden has heard the voices of the young robins who live in the
nest among his highest boughs; and he must yet tell to the horse-
chestnut how sad it was the other day in the thunder-storm, when the
wind upset the nest, and one little bird was thrown out and killed;
while the father and mother flew about in the greatest distress, until
Charley came, climbed the tree, and fitted the nest safely back into its
place.

How much the trees have to say! And there is the pine, who was born and
brought up in the woods,--he is always whispering secrets of the great
forest, and of the river beside which he grew. The other trees can't
always understand him: he is the poet among them, and a poet is always
suspected of knowing a little more than any one else.

Sometime I may try to tell you something of what he says; but here ends
the talk of the trees that stood in the village street.






The children came in from the field with their hands full of the soft,
pale-green corn-silk. Annie had rolled hers into a bird's-nest; while
Willie had dressed his little sister's hair with the long, damp tresses,
until she seemed more like a mermaid, with pale blue eyes shining out
between the locks of her sea-green hair, than like our own Alice.

They brought their treasures to the mother, who sat on the door-step of
the farm-house, under the tall, old elm-tree that had been growing there
ever since her mother was a child. She praised the beauty of the bird's-
nest, and kissed the little mermaiden to find if her lips tasted of salt
water; but then she said, "Don't break any more of the silk, dear
children, else we shall have no ears of corn in the field,--none to
roast before our picnic fires, and none to dry and pop at Christmas-time
next winter."

Now, the children wondered at what their mother said, and begged that
she would tell them how the silk could make the round, full kernels of
corn. And this is the story that the mother told, while they all sat on
the door-step under the old elm.

"When your father broke up the ground with his plough, and scattered in
the seed-corn, the crows were watching from the old apple-tree, and they
came down to pick up the corn; and, indeed, they did carry away a good
deal. But the days went by, the spring showers moistened the earth, and
the sun shone; and so the seed-corn swelled, and, bursting open, thrust
out two little hands, one reaching down to hold itself firmly in the
earth, and one reaching up to the light and air. The first was never
very beautiful, but certainly quite useful; for, besides holding the
corn firmly in its place, it drew up water and food for the whole plant:
but the second spread out two long, slender green leaves, that waved
with every breath of air, and seemed to rejoice in every ray of
sunshine. Day by day it grew taller and taller, and by and by put out
new streamers broader and stronger, until it stood higher than Willie's
head. Then, at the top, came a new kind of bud, quite different from
those that folded the green streamers; and when that opened, it showed a
nodding flower, which swayed and bowed at the top of the stalk like the
crown of the whole plant. And yet this was not the best that the corn-
plant could do; for lower down, and partly hidden by the leaves, it had
hung out a silken tassel of pale sea-green color, like the hair of a
little mermaid. Now, every silken thread was in truth a tiny tube, so
fine that our eyes cannot see the bore of it. The nodding flower that
grew so gayly up above there was day by day ripening a golden dust
called pollen; and every grain of this pollen--and they were very small
grains indeed--knew perfectly well that the silken threads were tubes,
and they felt an irresistible desire to enter the shining passages, and
explore them to the very end: so one day, when the wind was tossing the
whole blossoms this way and that, the pollen-grains danced out, and,
sailing down on the soft breeze, each one crept in at the open door of a
sea-green tube. Down they slid over the shining floors; and what was
their delight to find, when they reached the end, that they had all
along been expected, and for each one was a little room prepared, and
sweet food for their nourishment! And from this time they had no desire
to go away, but remained each in his own place, and grew every day
stronger and larger and rounder, even as baby in the cradle there, who
has nothing to do but grow.

"Side by side were their cradles, one beyond another in beautiful
straight rows; and as the pollen-grains grew daily larger, the cradles
also grew for their accommodation, until at last they felt themselves
really full of sweet, delicious life; and those who lived at the tops of
the rows peeped out from the opening of the dry leaves which wrapped
them all together, and saw a little boy with his father coming through
the cornfield, while yet every thing was beaded with dew, and the sun
was scarcely an hour high. The boy carried a basket; and the father
broke from the corn-stalks the full, firm ears of sweet corn, and heaped
the basket full."

"O mother," cried Willie, "that was father and I! Don't you remember how
we used to go out last summer every morning before breakfast to bring in
the corn? And we must have taken that very ear; for I remember how the
full kernels lay in straight rows, side by side, just as you have told."

Now Alice is breaking her threads of silk, and trying to see the tiny
opening of the tube; and Annie thinks she will look for the pollen-
grains the very next time she goes to the cornfield.






The stream that crept down from the hills, three miles away, has worn a
smooth bed for itself in the gravel; has watered the farmer's fields,
and turned the wheel of the old grist-mill, where the miller tends the
stones that grind the farmer's corn. But down below here the stream has
something else to do. It has been working hard, up and away from dam to
dam again; and as always in life there should be something besides
business,--something beautiful and peaceful,--so the stream has swept
round this corner, behind the wooded point of land which hides the mill,
and spread itself out in the hollow of Brown's meadow, where farmer
Brown says his grandfather used to tell him some Indian wigwams stood
when he was a boy. The land has sunk since then, and there is something
more beautiful than Indian wigwams there now.

Where the old squaws used to sit weaving baskets, and the papooses
rolled and played, is now thick, black mud, in which are great tangled
roots, some of them bigger than my arm.

All winter they lie there under the ice, while the children skate over
them. In the spring, when every thing stirs with new life, they, too,
must wake up: so, slowly and steadily, they begin to put up long stems
to reach the surface of the water. Chambered stems they are, each having
four passages leading up to the air, and down to the root and black mud.
The walls of these chambers are brown and slimy, and each stem bears at
its top a slimy bud,--slimy on the outside, brownish-green as it pushes
up through the water; for this outer coat is stout and waterproof, and
can well afford to be unpretending, since it carries something very
precious wrapped up inside.

Not days, but weeks,--even months, it is working upon this hidden
treasure before we shall see it. And the July mornings have come while
we wait.

Can you wake at three o'clock, children, and, while the birds are
singing their very best songs, go down the road under the elms, across
the little bridge, and through the hemlock grove at the right? It is a
mile to walk, and you will not be there too early. The broad, smooth
pond, that the brook has made for its holiday pleasure, is at our feet.
At its bottom are the tangled roots; on the surface, among the flat,
green leaves, float those buds that have been so long creeping towards
the light.

One long, bright beam from the sun just rising smiles across the meadow,
and touches the folded buds. They must, indeed, smile back in reply; so
the thick sheath unfolds, and behold! the whitest, fairest lily-cup
floats on the water, and its golden centre smiles back to the sun with
many rays.

We watched only one, but perhaps none is willing to be latest in
greeting the sun, and the pond is already half-covered with a snowy
fleet of boats fit for the fairies,--boats under full sail for fairy-
land, laden with beauty and fragrance.

And this is what the dark mud can send forth. This is one of Mother
Nature's hidden treasures. Perhaps she hides something as white and
beautiful in all that seems dark and ugly, if only we will wait and
watch for it, and be willing to come at the very dawn of day to look for
it.

The lilies will stay with us, now that at last they are here, all
through the rest of the summer, and even into the warm, sunny days of
earliest October; but it will be only a few who stay so late as that And
where have the others gone, meanwhile? You see there are no dead lilies
floating, folded and decaying, among the pads.

The stem that found its way so surely to the upper world knows not less
surely the way back again; and when its white blossom has opened for the
last time, and then wrapped its green cloak about it again, not to be
unfolded, the chambered stem coils backward, and carries it safely to
the bottom, where its seed may ripen in the soft, dark mud, and prepare
for another summer.






Who wants to engage in the carrying trade? Come, Lottie and Lula and
Nina and Mary, all bring your maps, and we will play merchants, and see
what is meant by the carrying trade.

Lottie shall have the bark "Rosette," and sail from Boston to Calcutta;
Lula, the steamer "North Star," from New York for Liverpool; Mary shall
take the "Sea-Gull," from Philadelphia to San Francisco; and Nina is
owner of the "Racer," that makes voyages up the Mediterranean. Are we
all ready for our little game?

Lottie begins, and she must find out what Boston has to send to
Calcutta. Don't send indigo or saltpetre or gunny-bags or ginger; for,
even should you have these articles to spare, Calcutta has an abundance
at home, and you must discover something that she needs, but does not
possess. "Ice," says Lottie. "Yes, that is just the thing, because
Calcutta has a hot climate, and does not make her own ice: so load the
'Rosette' with great blocks well packed, and start at once, for your
voyage is long."

And now we will go with Lula to the North River pier, where her great
steamer lies, and see what she intends to carry to Liverpool. Bales of
cotton, barrels of flour, of beef, and of petroleum. All very good, so
good-by to her. In a few weeks we will see what she brings back.

Come, Mary, what has Philadelphia for San Francisco? Oh, what a load the
"Sea-Gull" must take of machinery, steam-engines, tobacco, and oil; and
such a quantity of other things, that the "Sea-Gull" will need to make
many voyages before she can take them all. We load her at this busy
wharf, where the coal-vessels are passing in and out for New York and
Boston, and the steamers are loading for Europe, and the little coasters
crowding in one after another; and away we go for the voyage round the
"Horn," where the "Sea-Gull" will meet her namesakes, and perhaps some
stormy winds besides.

Meantime Nina's "Racer" has been stored full of cotton cloths and
hardware, and has raced out of Boston Harbor so swiftly that fair winds
will take her to Gibraltar in three weeks.

And so you have all engaged in the carrying trade; but as yet you have
carried only one way. To complete the game, we must wait for Lottie to
bring the "Rosette" safely home with salt-petre and indigo and hides and
ginger and seersuckers and gunny-cloth. And the "North Star" must steam
her quick way across the Atlantic, and return with salt and hardware,
anchors, steel, woolens, and linens. Mary must beat her way round Cape
Horn, and home again with wool and gold and silver. And the swift
"Racer" must quickly bring the figs and prunes and raisins, and the
oranges and lemons, that will spoil if they are too long on the way.

So children may play at the carrying trade, and so their fathers and
uncles may work at it in earnest: and so also hundreds of little workers
are busy all the world over in another carrying trade, which keeps you
and me alive from day to day; and yet we scarcely think; at all how it
is going on, or stop to thank the hands that feed us.

England and Italy are kingdoms, and the United States a republic, and
they all engage in this business, and are constantly sending goods one
to another; but there are other kingdoms, not put down on any map, that
are just as busy as they, and in the same sort of work too.

The earth is one kingdom, the water another, and there is the great
republic of the gases surrounding us on every side; only we can't see
it, because its inhabitants have the fairy gift of being invisible to
us. Each of these kingdoms has products to export, and is all ready to
trade with the others, if only some one will supply the means; just as
the Frenchmen might stand on their shores, and hold out to us wines and
prunes and silks and muslins, and we might stand on our shores, and hold
out gold and silver to them, and yet could make no exchange, because
there were no ships to carry the goods across. "Ah," you may say, "that
is not at all the case here; for the earth, the air, and the water are
all close to each other, and close to us, and there is no need of ships;
we can exchange hand to hand."

But here comes a difficulty. Read carefully, and I think you will
understand it. Here is Ruth, a little growing girl, who wants phosphate
of lime to build bones with; for as she grows, of course her bones must
grow too. Very well, I answer, there is plenty of phosphate of lime in
the earth; she can have all she wants. Yes, but does Ruth want to eat
earth?--do you?--does anybody? Certainly not: so, although the food she
needs is close beside her, even under her feet, she cannot get it any
more than we can get the French goods, excepting by means of the
carrying trade. Where now are the little ships that shall bring to Ruth
the phosphate of lime she needs, and cannot reach, although it lies in
her own father's field? Let me show you how her father can build the
ships that will bring it to her. He must go out into that field, and
plant wheat-seeds, and as they grow, every little ear and kernel gathers
up phosphate of lime, and becomes a tiny ship freighted with what his
little daughter needs. When that wheat is ground into flour, and made
into bread, Ruth will eat what she couldn't have been willing to taste,
unless the useful little ships of the wheat-field had brought it to her.

Now let us send to the republic of the gases for some supplies, for we
cannot live without carbon and oxygen; and although we do breathe in
oxygen with every breathe we draw, we also need to receive it in other
ways: so the sugar-cane and the maple-trees engage in the carrying trade
for us, taking in carbon and oxygen by their leaves, and sending it
through their bodies, and when it reaches us it is sugar,--and a very
pleasant food to most of you, I dare say.

But we cannot take all we need of these gases in the form of sugar, and
there are many other ships that will bring it to us. The corn will
gather it up, and offer it in the form of meal, or of cornstarch
puddings; or the grass will bring it to the cow, since you and I refuse
to take it from the grass ships. But the cow offers it to us again in
the form of milk, and we do not think of refusing; or the butcher offers
it to us in the form of beef, and we do not say "no."

Alice wants some india-rubber shoes. Do you think the kingdoms of air
and water can send her a pair? The india-rubber tree in South America
will take up water, and separate from it hydrogen, of which it is partly
composed, and adding to this carbon from the air, will make a gum which
we can work into shoes and balls, buttons, tubes, cups, cloth, and a
hundred other useful articles.

Then, again, you and I, all of us, must go to the world of gases for
nitrogen to help build our bodies, to make muscle and blood and skin and
hair; and so the peas and beans load their boat-shaped seeds full, and
bring it to us so fresh and excellent that we enjoy eating it.

This useful carrying trade has also another branch well worth looking
at.

You remember hearing how many soldiers were sick in war-time at the
South; but perhaps you do not know that their best medicine was brought
to them by a South-American tree, that gathered up from the earth and
air bitter juices to make what we call quinine. Then there is camphor,
which I am sure you have all seen, sent by the East-Indian camphor-tree
to cure you when you are sick; and gum-arabic and all the other gums;
and castor-oil and most of the other medicines that you don't at all
like,--all brought to us by the plants.

I might tell you a great deal more of this, but I will only stop to show
a little what we give back in payment for all that is brought.

When England sends us hardware and woollen goods, she expects us to
repay her with cotton and sugar, that are just as valuable to us as
hardware and woolens to her; but see how differently we treat the
kingdoms from which the plant-ships are all the time bringing us food
and clothes and medicines, etc. All we return is just so much as we
don't want to use. We take in good fresh air, and breathe out impure and
bad. We throw back to the earth whatever will not nourish and strengthen
us; and yet no complaint comes from the faithful plants. Do you wonder?
I will let you into the secret of this. The truth is, that what is
worthless to us is really just the food they need; and they don't at all
know how little we value it ourselves. It is like the Chinese, of whom
we might buy rice or silk or tea, and pay them in rats which we are glad
to be rid of, while they consider them good food.

Now, I have given you only a peep into this carrying trade, but it is
enough to show you how to use your own eyes to learn more about it. Look
about you, and see if you can't tell as good a story as I have done, or
a better one if you please.




Once there was a little star-fish, and he had five fingers and five
eyes, one at the end of each finger,--so that he might be said to have
at least one power at his fingers' ends. And he had I can't tell you how
many little feet; but being without legs, you see, he couldn't be
expected to walk very fast The feet couldn't move one before the other
as yours do. they could only cling like little suckers, by which he
pulled himself slowly along from place to place. Nevertheless, he was
very proud of this accomplishment; and sometimes this pride led him to
an unjust contempt for his neighbors, as you will see by and by. He was
very particular about his eating; and besides his mouth, which lay in
the centre of his body, he had a little scarlet-colored sieve through
which he strained the water he drank. For he couldn't think of taking in
common seawater with every thing that might be floating in it,--that
would do for crabs and lobsters and other common people; but anybody who
wears such a lovely purple coat, and has brothers and sisters dressed in
crimson, feels a little above such living.

Now, one day this star-fish set out on a summer journey,--not to the
seaside where you and I went last year: of course not, for he was there
already. No; he thought he would go to the mountains. He could not go to
the Rocky Mountains, nor to the Catskill Mountains, nor the White
Mountains; for, with all his accomplishments, he had not yet learned to
live in any drier place than a pool among the rocks, or the very wettest
sand at low tide: so, if he travelled to the mountains, it must be to
the mountains of the sea.

Perhaps you didn't know that there are mountains in the sea. I have seen
them, however, and I think you have, too,--at least their tops, if
nothing more. What is that little rocky ledge, where the lighthouse
stands, but the stony top of a hill rising from the bottom of the sea?
And what are the pretty green islands, with their clusters of trees and
grassy slopes, but the summits of hills lifted out of the water?

In many parts of the sea, where the water is deep, are hills and even
high mountains, whose tops do not reach the surface; and we should not
know where they are, were it not that the sailors, in measuring the
depth of the sea, sometimes sail right over these mountain-tops, and
touch them with their sounding-lines.

The star fish set out one day, about five hundred years ago, to visit
some of these mountains of the sea. If he had depended upon his own feet
for getting there, it would have taken him till this day, I verily
believe; but he no more thought of walking, than you or I should think
of walking to China. You shall see how he travelled. A great train was
coming, down from the Northern seas; not a railroad train, but a water
train, sweeping on like a river in the sea. Its track lay along near the
bottom of the ocean; and above you could see no sign of it, any more
than you can see the cars while they go through the tunnel under the
street. The principal passengers by this train were icebergs, who were
in the habit of coming down on it every year, in order to reduce their
weight by a little exercise; for they grow so very large and heavy up
there in the North every winter, that some sort of treatment is really
necessary to them when summer comes. I only call the icebergs the
principal passengers, because they take up so much room; for thousands
and millions of other travellers come with them,--from the white bears
asleep on the bergs, and brought away quite against their will, to the
tiniest little creatures rocking in the cradles of the ripples, or
clinging to the delicate branches of the sea-mosses. I said you could
see no sign of the great water train from above: that was not quite
true, for many of the icebergs are tall enough to lift their heads far
up into the air, and shine with a cold, glittering splendor in the
sunlight; and you can tell, by the course in which they sail, which way
the train is going deep down in the sea.

The star-fish took passage on this train. He didn't start at the
beginning of the road, but got in at one of the way-stations somewhere
off Cape Cod, fell in with some friends going South, and had altogether
a pleasant trip of it. No wearisome stopping-places to feed either
engine or passengers; for this train moves by a power that needs no
feeding on the way, and the passengers are much in the habit of eating
their fellow-travellers by way of frequent luncheons.

In the course of a few weeks, our five-fingered traveller is safely
dropped in the Caribbean Sea; and, if you do not know where that sea is,
I wish you would take your map of North America and find it, and then
you can see the course of the journey, and understand the story better.
This Caribbean Sea is as full of mountains as New Hampshire and Vermont
are; but none of them have caps of snow like that which Mount Washington
sometimes wears, and some of them are built up in a very odd way, as you
will presently see.

Now the star-fish is floating in the warm, soft water among the
mountains, turning up first one eye and then another to see the wonders
about him, or looking all around, before and behind and both sides at
once,--as you can't do, if you try ever so hard,--while his fifth eye is
on the lookout for sharks, besides; and he meets with a soft little
body, much smaller than himself, and not half so handsomely dressed, who
invites him to visit her relatives, who live by millions in this
mountain region. "And come quickly, if you please," she says, "for I
begin to feel as if I must fix myself somewhere; and I should like, if
possible, to settle down near my brothers and sisters on the Roncador
Bank."




Where is Roncador Bank, and who are the little settlers there? If you
want me to answer this question, you must go back with me, or rather
think back with me, over many thousands of years; and, looking into this
same Caribbean Sea, we shall find in its south-western part a little
hill formed of mud and sand, and reaching not nearly so high as the top
of the water. Not far from it float some little, soft, jelly-like
bodies, exactly resembling the one who spoke to the star-fish just now.
They are emigrants looking for a new home. They seem to take a fancy to
this hill, and fix themselves on bits of rock along its base, until, as
more and more of them come, they form a circle around it, and the hill
stands up in the middle, while far above the whole blue waves are
tossing in the sunlight.


How do you like this little circular town seen in the picture? It is the
beginning of Coraltown, just as the landing of the Pilgrims at Plymouth
was the beginning of Massachusetts. Now we will see how it grows. First
of all, notice this curious fact, that each settler, after once choosing
a home, never after stirs from that spot; but, from day to day, fastens
himself more and more firmly to the rock where he first stuck. The part
of his body touching the rock hardens into stone, and as the months and
years go by, the sides of his body, too, turn to stone; and yet he is
still alive, eating all the time with a little mouth at his top, taking
in the sea-water without a strainer, and getting consequently tiny bits
of lime in it, which, once taken in, go to build up the little body into
a sort of limestone castle; just as if one of the knights in armor, of
whom we read in old stories, had, instead of putting on his steel
corselet and helmet and breastplate, turned his own flesh and bones into
armor. How safe he would be! So these inhabitants of Coraltown were safe
from all the fishes and other fierce devourers of little sea creatures
(for who wants to swallow a mail-clad warrior, however small?); and
their settlement was undisturbed, and grew from year to year, until it
formed a pretty high wall.


But, before going any farther, you may like to know that these settlers
were all of the polyp family: fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters,
uncles and aunts,--all were polyps. And this is the way their families
increased: after the first comers were fairly settled, and pretty
thoroughly turned to stone, little buds, looking somewhat like the
smallest leaf-buds of the spring-time, began to grow out of their edges.
These were their children, at least one kind of their children; for they
had yet another kind also, coming from eggs, and floating off in the
water like the first settlers. These latter we might call the free
children or wanderers, while the former could be named the fixed
children. But even the wanderers come back after a short time, and
settle beside their parents, as you remember the one who met the star-
fish was about to do.

It was not very easy for you or me to think back so many thousand years
to the very beginning of Coraltown, nor is it less difficult to realize
how many, many years were passing while the little town grew, even as
far as I have told you.

The old great-grandfathers and great-grandmothers had died, but they
left their stone bodies still standing, as a support and assistance to
their descendants who had built above them; and the walls had risen, not
like walls of common stone or brick, but all alive and busy building
themselves, day after day, and year after year, until now, at the time
of the star-fish's visit, the topmost towers could sometimes catch a
gleam of sunlight when the tide was low; and when storms rolled the
great waves that way, they would dash against the little castles,
breaking themselves into snowy spray, and crumbling away at the same
time the tiny walls that had been the polyps' work of years. Do you
think that was too bad, and quite discouraging to the workers. It does
seem so; but you will see how the good God, who is their loving Father
just the same as he is ours, had a grand purpose in letting the waves
break down their houses, just as he always does in all the
disappointments he sends to us. Wait till you finish the story, and tell
me if you don't think so.

And now let us see what the star-fish thought of the little town and its
inhabitants. "Ah, these are your houses!" he said. "Why don't you come
out of them, and travel about to see the world?"--"These are not our
houses, but ourselves," answered the polyps; "we can't come out, and we
don't want to. We are here to build, and building is all we care to do;
as for seeing the world, that is all very well for those who have eyes,
but we have none."

Then the star-fish turned away in contempt from such creatures,--"people
of neither taste nor ability, no eyes, no feet, no water-strainers; poor
little useless things, what good are they in the world, with their
stupid, blind building of which they think so much?" And he worked
himself off into a branch water-train that was setting that way, and,
without so much as bidding the polyps good-by, turned his back upon
Coraltown, and presently found a fellow-passenger fine enough to absorb
all his attention,--a passenger, I say, but we shall find it rather a
group of passengers in their own pretty boat; some curled in spiral
coils, some trailing like little swimmers behind, some snugly ensconced
inside, but all of such brilliant colors and gay bearing that even the
star-fish felt his inferiority; and, wishing to make friends with so
fine a neighbor, he whirled a tempting morsel of food towards one of the
swimming party, and politely offered it to him. "No, I thank you,"
replied the swimmer, "I don't eat; my sister does the eating, I only
swim." Turning to another of the gay company with the same offer, he was
answered, "Thank you, the eaters are at the other side; I only lay
eggs." "What strange people!" thought the star-fish; but, with all his
learning, he didn't know every thing, and had never heard how people
sometimes live in communities, and divide the work as suits their fancy.

While we leave him wondering, let us go back to Coraltown. The crumbling
bits, beaten off by the waves, floated about, filling all the chinks of
the wall, while the rough edges at the top caught long ribbons of
seaweed, and sometimes drifting wood from wrecked vessels, and then the
sea washed up sand in great heaps against the walls, building buttresses
for them. Do you know what buttresses are? If you don't, I will leave
you to find out. And the polyps, who do not know how to live in the
light and air, had all died; or those who were wanderers had emigrated
to some new place. Poor little things, their useless lives had ended,
and what good had they done in the world?




And now let us look at Coraltown once more. It is the first day of June
of 1865. The sun is low in the West, and lights up the crests of the
long lines of breakers that are everywhere curling and dashing among the
topmost turrets of the coral walls. But here is something new and
strange indeed for this region; along one of the ledges of rock, fitted
as it were into a cradle, lies the great steamship "Golden Rule," a
vessel full two hundred and fifty feet long, and holding six or seven
hundred people. Her masts are gone, and so are the tall chimneys from
which the smoke of her engine used to rise like a cloud. The rocks have
torn a great hole through her strong planks, and the water is washing
in; while the biggest waves that roll that way lift themselves in
mountainous curves, and sweep over the deck.

This fine, great vessel sailed out of New York harbor a week ago to
carry all these people to Greytown, on their way to California; and here
she is now at Coraltown instead of Greytown, and the poor people, nearly
a hundred miles away from land, are waiting through the weary hours,
while they see the ocean swallowing up their vessel, breaking it, and
tearing it to pieces, and they do not know how soon they may find
themselves drifting in the sea. But, although they may be a hundred
miles from land, they are just as near to God as they ever were; and he
is even at this moment taking most loving care of them.

On the more sheltered parts of the deck are men and women, holding on by
ropes and bulwarks: they are all looking one way out over the water.
What are they watching for? See, it comes now in sight,--only a black
speck in the golden path of the sunlight! No, it is a boat sent out two
hours ago to search for some island where the people might find refuge
when the ship should go to pieces. Do you wonder that the men and women
are watching eagerly? Look! it has reached the outer ledge of rock. The
men spring out of it, waving their hats, and shouting "Success;" and the
men on board answer with a loud hurrah, while the women cannot keep back
their tears. What land have they discovered? You could hardly call it
land. It is only a larger ledge of coral, built up just out of reach of
the waves, its crevices filled in firmly with broken bits of rock and
drifts of sand; but it seems to-day, to these shipwrecked people, more
beautiful than the loveliest woods and meadows do to you and me.

It would be too long a story if I should tell you how the people were
moved from the wreck to this little harbor of refuge, lowered over the
vessel's side with ropes, taken first to a raft which had been made of
broken parts of the vessel, and the next day in little boats to the
rocky island; but you can make a picture in your mind of the boats full
of people, and the sailors rowing through the breakers, and the great
sea-birds coming to meet their strange visitors, peering curiously at
them, as if they wondered what new kind of creatures were these, without
wings or beaks. And you must see in the very first boat little May
Warner, three years and a half old, with her sunny hair all wet with
spray, and her blue eyes wide open to see all the wonders about her. For
May doesn't know what danger is: even while on the wreck, she clapped
her little hands in delight to see the great curling crests of the
waves; and now she is singing her merry songs to the sea-birds, and
laughing in their funny faces, and fairly shouting with joy, as, at
landing, she rides to the shore perched high on the shoulder of sailor
Jack, while he wades knee-deep through the water.

So we have come to a second settlement of Coraltown: first the polyps;
then the men, women, and children. Do you see how the good Father
teaches all his creatures to help each other? Here the tiny polyps have
built an island for people who are so much larger and stronger than
themselves, and the seeming destruction of their upper walls was only a
better preparation for the reception of these distinguished visitors.
The birds, too, are helping them to food, for every little cave and
shelf in the rock is full of eggs. And now should you like to see how
little May Warner helps them in even a better way?

Did you ever fall asleep on the floor, and, waking, find yourself aching
and stiff because it was so hard? Then you know, in part, what hard beds
rocks make. And in a hot, sunny day, haven't you often been glad to keep
under the trees, or even to stay in the house for shade? Then you can
understand a little how hot it must have been on Roncador Island, where
there were no trees nor houses. And haven't you sometimes, when you were
very hot and tired and hungry, and had, perhaps, also been kept waiting
a long hour for somebody who didn't come,--haven't you felt a little
cross and fretful and impatient, so that nothing seemed pleasant to you,
and you seemed pleasant to nobody? Now, shouldn't you think there was
great danger that these people on the island, in the hot sun, tired,
hungry, and waiting, waiting, day and night, for some vessel to come and
take them to their homes again, and not feeling at all sure that any
such vessel would ever come,--shouldn't you think there was danger of
their becoming cross and fretful and impatient? And if one begins to
say, "Oh, how tired I am, and how hard the rocks are, and how little
dinner I have had, and how hot the sun is, and what shall we ever do
waiting here so long, and how shall we ever get home again!" don't you
see that all would begin to be discouraged? And sometimes on this island
it did happen just so: first one would be discouraged, and then another;
and as soon as you begin to feel in this way, you know at once every
thing grows even worse than it was before,--the sun feels hotter, the
rocks harder, the water tastes more disagreeably, and the crab's claws
less palatable. But in the midst of all the trouble, May would come
tripping over the rocks,--a little sunburnt girl now, with tattered
clothes and bare feet,--and she would bring a pretty pink conch-shell or
the lovely rose-colored sea-mosses, and tell her funny little story of
where she found them. The discontented people would gather around her:
she would give a sailor kiss to one, and a French kiss to another, and,
best of all, a Yankee kiss, with both arms round his neck, to her own
dear father; and then, somehow or other, the discontent and trouble
would be gone, for a little while at least,--just as a cloud sometimes
seems to melt away in the sunshine; and so May Warner earned the name of
"Little Sunshine."

If anybody had picked up driftwood enough to make a fire, and could get
an old battered kettle and some water to make a soup of shell fish,
"Little Sunshine" must be invited to dinner, for half the enjoyment
would be wanting without her.

If a great black cloud came up threatening a shower, the roughest man on
the island forgot his own discomfort, in making a tent to keep "Little
Sunshine" safe from the rain. And so, in a thousand ways, she cheered
the weary days, making everybody happier for having her there.

Do you think there are any children who would have made the people less
happy by being there? who would have complained and fretted, and been
selfish and disagreeable?

Ten days go by, so slowly that they seem more like weeks or months than
like days. The people have suffered from the rain, from heat, from want
of food. They are very weak now; some of them can hardly stand. Can you
imagine how they feel, when, in the early morning, two great gun-boats
come in sight, making straight for their island as fast as the strong
steam-engines will take them? Can you think how tenderly and carefully
they are taken on board, fed with broth and wine, and nursed back into
health and strength? And do not forget the little treasures that go in
May's pocket,--the bits of coral, the tinted sea-shells, and ruby-
colored mosses; and nested among them all, and chief in her regard, a
little five-fingered star, spiny and dry, but still showing a crimson
coat, and dots which mark the places of five eyes, and a little scarlet
water-strainer, now of no further use to the owner. Do you remember our
old friend the star-fish? Well, this is his great-great-great-great-
great-grandchild. In a week or two more, the rescued people have all
reached California, and gone their separate ways, never to meet again.
But all carry in their hearts the memory of "Little Sunshine," who
lightened their troubles, and cheered their darkest days.






Do you believe in giants? No, do you say? Well, listen to my story,
which is a really true one, and then answer my question.

Many hundreds of years ago, certain people who lived in the North, and
were therefore called Northmen, had a strange idea of the form and
situation of the earth: they thought it was a flat, circular piece of
land, surrounded by a great ocean; and that this ocean was again
surrounded by a wall of snow-covered mountains, where lived the race of
Frost Giants.

I have seen a pretty picture of this world of theirs, with a lovely
rainbow bridge arching up over the sea to the earth, and a great coiled
serpent, holding his tail in his mouth, lying in mid-ocean like a ring
around the land. Perhaps you will some day read about it all, but at
present we have only to do with the Frost Giants; for I want to tell
you, that, although no one now thinks of believing about the serpent or
the flat earth or the rainbow bridge, yet the Frost Giants still live,
and their home is really among the mountains.

You may call them by what name you like, and we may all know certainly
that they are not what the old Northmen believed them to be, but are
God's workmen, a part of Nature's family, employed to work in the great
garden of the world; but, whenever we look at their work, we cannot fail
to admit that to do it needed a giant's strength, and so they deserve
their title.

Have you sometimes seen great boulder stones, as big as a small house,
that stand alone by themselves in some field, or on some seashore, where
no other rocks are near? Well, the Frost Giants carried these boulders
about, and dropped them down miles away from their homes, as you might
take a pocketful of pebbles, and drop them along the road as you walk.
Sometimes they roll great rocks down the mountain-sides, playing a
desperate game of ball with each other. Sometimes they are sent to make
a bridge over Niagara Falls, or to build a dam across a mountain torrent
in an hour's time. Now and then they have to rake off a steep mountain-
side as you might a garden-bed; and sometimes to bury a whole village so
quickly that the poor inhabitants do not know what strange hand brought
such sudden destruction upon them. Their deeds often seem to be cruel,
and we cannot understand their meaning; but we shall some time know that
the loving Father who sent them orders nothing for our hurt, but has
always a loving purpose, though it may be hidden.

While I thus introduce to you the Frost Giants, let me also present
their tiny brethren and sisters, the Frost Fairies, who always accompany
them on their expeditions; and, however terrible is the deed that has to
be done, these little people adorn it with the most lovely handiwork,--
tiny flowers and crystals and veils of delicate lace-work, fringes and
spangles and star-work and carving; so that nothing is so hard and ugly
and bare that they cannot beautify it.

Now that you are introduced, you will perhaps like to join a Frost party
that started out to work, one day in the early spring of 1861, from
their homes among the Olympic Mountains.






Can you imagine a beautiful oval-shaped bay, almost encircled by a long
arm of sand stretching out from the mainland? In its deep water the
largest vessels might ride at anchor, but at the time of my story a
lonelier place could scarcely be found. Now and then Indian canoes
glided over the water, and at long intervals some vessel from the great
island away yonder to the North visited the little settlement upon the
shore of the bay. It is indeed a very little settlement,--a few houses
clustered together upon the sandy beach close to the blue water; behind
the houses rises a cliff crowned with great fir-trees, standing tall and
dark in thick ranks, making a dense forest; and beyond this forest,
cold, snow-covered mountains lift their peaks against the sky,--a
fitting home for the Frost Giants.

Three streams, straying from the far-away mountains, and fed by their
melted snows and hidden springs, find their way through the forest, leap
and tumble over the cliff, and, passing through the little settlement,
reach the sea. The people who live here call these little streams RUNS,
and one of them is Nannie's Run.

And, now, who is Nannie? Why, Nannie is Nannie Dwight,--a little girl
not yet five years old, who lives in the small square house standing
under the cliff. She sits even now on the door-step, and her red dress
looks like one gay flower brightening the sombre shadow of the firs. Her
father and mother came here to live when she was but a baby, and before
there was a single house built in the place; and it is out of compliment
to her that one of the streams has been named Nannie's Run.

While Nannie sits on the doorstep, and looks out at the sea, watching
for the vessel that will bring her father home from Victoria, we will go
through the forest, and up the mountain-sides, till we find the home of
the Frost Giants, and see what they are about to-day.

They have been working all winter, but not quite so busily as now; for
since yesterday they have cracked that big rock in two, and dug the
great cave under the hill, and now they are gathered in council on the
mountain-side that overlooks a dashing little stream. As we followed
this stream from the seashore, we happen to know that it is no other
than Nannie's Run. And as we have already begun to care for the little
girl, and therefore for her namesake, we are anxious to know what the
giants think of doing. We have not long to wait before we shall see, and
hear too; for a great creaking and cracking begins, and, while we gaze
astonished, the mountain-side begins to slide, and presently, with a
rush and a roar, dashes into the stream, and chokes it with a huge dam
of earth and rocks and trees.

What will the stream do now? For a moment the water leaps into the air,
all foam and sparkle, as if it would jump over the barrier, and find its
way to the sea at any rate. But this proves entirely unsuccessful; and
at last, after whirling and tumbling, trying to creep under; trying to
leap over, it settles itself quietly in its prison, as if to think about
the matter.

Now, if you will stay and watch it day after day, you will see what good
result will come from this waiting; for every hour more and more water
is running to its aid, and, as its forces increase, we begin to feel
sure, that, although it can neither pass over nor under, it will some
day be strong enough to break through the Frost Giants' dam. And the day
comes at last, when, summoning all its waters to the attack, it makes a
breach in the great earth wall, and in a strong, grand column, as high
as this room, marches away towards the sea.

As we have the wings of thought to travel with, let us hurry back to the
settlement, and see where Nannie is now, and tell the people, if we only
can, what a wall of water is marching down upon them; for you see the
little channel that used to hold Nannie's Run is not a quarter large
enough for this torrent, that has gathered so long behind the dam.

Peep in at the window, and see how Nannie stands at the kitchen table,
cutting out little cakes from a bit of dough that her mother has given
her; she is all absorbed in her play, and her mother has gone to look
into the oven at the nicely browning loaves.

Oh, don't we wish the house had been built up on the cliff among the
fir-trees, safe above the reach of the water! But, alas! here it stands,
just in the path that the torrent will take, and we have no power to
tell of the danger that is approaching.

Mrs. Dwight turns from the oven, and, passing the window on her way to
the table, suddenly sees the great wall of water only a few rods from
her house. With one step she reaches the bedroom, seizes the blankets
from the bed, wraps Nannie in them, and with the little girl on one arm,
grasps Frankie's hand, and, telling Harry to run beside her, opens the
door nearest the cliff, and almost flies up its steep side.

Five minutes afterwards, sitting breathless on the roots of an old tree,
with her children safe beside her, she sees the whole shore covered with
surging water, and the houses swept into the bay, tossing and drifting
there like boats in a stormy sea. And this is what the Frost Giants did
to Nannie's Run.






What will Nannie do now? Here in our New-England towns it would seem
hard enough to have one's house swept away before one's eyes; but then
you know you could take the next train of cars, and go to your aunt in
Boston, or your uncle in New York, to stay until a new house could be
prepared for you. But here is Nannie hundreds and thousands of miles
away from any such help; for there are not only no railroads to travel
upon, but not even common roads nor horses nor wagons; nevertheless,
there are neighbors who will bring help.

You remember reading in your history, how, when our great-great-
grandfathers came to this country to live, they found it occupied by
Indians. The Indians are all gone from our part of the country now; but
out in the far North-West, where Nannie lives, they still have their
wigwams and canoes, still dress in blankets, and wear feathers on their
heads, and in that particular part of the country lives a tribe called
the Flatheads. They take this odd name because of a fashion they have of
binding a board upon the top of a child's head, while he is yet very
young, in order that he may grow up with a flattened head, which is
considered a mark of beauty among these savages, just as small feet are
so considered among the Chinese, you know.

The Flatheads are Nannie's only neighbors, and perhaps you would
consider them rather undesirable friends; but when I tell you how they
came at once with blankets and food, and all sorts of friendly offers of
shelter and help, you will think that some white people might well take
a lesson from them.

They had been in the habit of bringing venison and salmon to the
settlement for sale; and when Nannie's mother tells them that she has no
longer any money to buy, they say, "Oh, no, it is a potlatch!" which in
their language mean a present.

Happily the warm weather is approaching; and a little girl who has lived
out of doors so much does not find it unsafe to sleep in the hammock
which Hunter has slung for her among the trees, or even on the ground,
rolled in an Indian blanket; and when her shoes wear out, she can safely
run barefooted in the woods or on the sand.

Before many weeks have passed, some of the tall fir-trees are cut down,
and a new house is built, this time safely perched on top of the cliff;
and, so far as I know, the Frost Giants have never succeeded in touching
it.






Quercus Alba lay on the ground, looking up at the sky. He lay in a
little brown, rustic cradle which would be pretty for any baby, but was
specially becoming to his shining, bronzed complexion; for although his
name, Alba, is the Latin word for white, he did not belong to the white
race. He was trying to play with his cousins Coccinea and Rubra; but
they were two or three yards away from him, and not one of the three
dared to roll any distance, for fear of rolling out of his cradle: so it
wasn't a lively play, as you may easily imagine. Presently Rubra, who
was a sturdy little fellow, hardly afraid of any thing, summoned courage
to roll full half a yard, and, having come within speaking distance,
began to tell how his elder brother had, that very morning, started on
the grand underground tour, which to the Quercus family is what going to
Europe would be for you and me. Coccinea thought the account very
stupid; said his brothers had all been, and he should go too sometime,
he supposed; and, giving a little shrug of his shoulders which set his
cradle rocking, fell asleep in the very face of his visitors. Not so
Alba: this was all news to him,--grand news. He was young and
inexperienced, and, moreover, full of roving fancies: so he lifted his
head as far as he dared, nodded delightedly as Rubra described the
departure, and, when his cousin ceased speaking, asked eagerly, "And
what will he do there?"

"Do?" said Rubra, "do? Why, he will do just what everybody else does who
goes on the grand tour. What a foolish fellow you are, to ask such a
question!"

Now, this was no answer at all, as you see plainly; and yet little Alba
was quite abashed by it, and dared not push the question further for
fear of displaying his ignorance,--never thinking that we children are
not born with our heads full of information on all subjects, and that
the only way to fill them is to push our questions until we are utterly
satisfied with the answers; and that no one has reason to feel ashamed
of ignorance which is not now his own fault, but will soon become so if
he hushes his questions for fear of showing it.

Here Alba made his first mistake. There is only one way to correct a
mistake of this kind; and it is so excellent a way, that it even brings
you out at the end wiser than the other course could have done. Alba, I
am happy to say, resolved at once on this course. "If," said he, "Rubra
does not choose to tell me about the grand tour, I will go and see for
myself." It was a brave resolve for a little fellow like him. He lost no
time in preparing to carry it out; but, on pushing against the gate that
led to the underground road, he found that the frost had fastened it
securely, and he must wait for a warmer day. In the mean time, afraid to
ask any more questions, he yet kept his ears open to gather any scraps
of information that might be useful for his journey.

Listening ears can always hear; and Alba very soon began to learn, from
the old trees overhead, from the dry rustling leaves around him, and
from the little chipping-birds that chatted together in the sunshine.
Some said the only advantage of the grand tour was to make one a perfect
and accomplished gentleman; others, that all the useful arts were taught
abroad, and no one who wished to improve the world in which he lived
would stay at home another year. Old grandfather Rubra, standing tall
and grand, and stretching his knotty arms, as if to give force to his
words, said, "Of all arts, the art of building is the noblest, and that
can only be learned by those who take the grand tour; therefore, all my
boys have been sent long ago, and already many of my grandsons have
followed them."

Then there was a whisper among the leaves: "All very well, old Rubra;
but did any of your sons or grandsons ever COME BACK from the grand
tour?"

There was no answer; indeed, the leaves hadn't spoken loudly enough for
the old gentleman to hear, for he was known to have a fiery temper, and
it was scarcely safe to offend him. But the little brown chipping-birds
said, one to another, "No, no, no, they never came back! they never came
back!"

All this sent a chill through Alba's heart, but he still held to his
purpose; and in the night a warm and friendly rain melted the frozen
gateway, and he boldly rolled out of his cradle forever, and, slipping
through the portal, was lost to sight.

His mother looked for her baby; his brothers and cousins rolled over and
about, in search for him. Rubra began to feel sorry for the last
scornful words he had said, and would have petted his little cousin with
all his heart, if he could only have had him once again; but Alba was
never again seen by his old friends and companions.






"How dark it is here, and how difficult for one to make his way through
the thick atmosphere!" so thought little Alba, as he pushed and pushed
slowly into the soft mud. Presently a busy hum sounded all about him;
and, becoming accustomed to the darkness, he could see little forms
moving swiftly and industriously to and fro.

You children who live above, and play about on the hillsides and in the
woods, have no idea what is going on all the while under your feet; how
the dwarfs and the fairies are working there, weaving moss carpets and
grass blades, forming and painting flowers and scarlet mushrooms,
tending and nursing all manner of delicate things which have yet to grow
strong enough to push up and see the outside life, and learn to bear its
cold winds, and rejoice in its sunshine.

While Alba was seeing all this, he was still struggling on, but very
slowly; for first he ran against the strong root of an old tree, then
knocked his head upon a sharp stone, and finally, bruised and sore,
tired, and quite in despair, he sighed a great sigh, and declared he
could go no farther. At that, two odd little beings sprang to his side;
the one brown as the earth itself, with eyes like diamonds for
brightness, and deft little fingers, cunning in all works of skill.
Pulling off his wisp of a cap, and making a grotesque little bow, he
asked, "Will you take a guide for the under-world tour?"--"That I will,"
said Alba, "for I no longer find myself able to move a step."--"Ha, ha!"
laughed the dwarf, "of course you can't move in that great body, the
ways are too narrow; you must come out of yourself before you can get on
in this journey. Put out your foot now, and I will show you where to
step."--"Out of myself?" cried Alba. "Why, that is to die! My foot, did
you say? I haven't any feet; I was born in a cradle, and always lived in
it until now, and could never do any thing but rock and roll."

"Ha, ha, ha!" again laughed the dwarf, "hear him talk! This is the way
with all of them. No feet, does he say? Why, he has a thousand, if he
only knew it; hands too, more than he can count. Ask him, sister, and
see what he will say to you."

With that a soft little voice said cheerfully, "Give me your hand, that
I may lead you on the upward part of your journey; for, poor little
fellow, it is indeed true that you do not know how to live out of your
cradle, and we must show you the way!" Encouraged by this kindly speech,
Alba turned a little towards the speaker, and was about to say (as his
mother had long ago taught him that he should in all difficulties),
"I'll try," when a little cracking noise startled the whole company;
and, hardly knowing what he did, Alba thrust out, through a slit in his
shiny brown skin, a little foot reaching downward to follow the dwarf's
lead, and a little hand extending upward, quickly clasped by that of the
fairy, who stood smiling and lovely in her fair green garments, with a
tender, tiny grass-blade binding back her golden hair. Oh, what a thrill
went through Alba as he felt this new possession,--a hand and a foot! A
thousand such, had they not said? What it all meant he could only
wonder; but the one real possession was at least certain, and in that he
began to feel that all things were possible.

And now shall we see where the dwarf led him, and where the fairy, and
what was actually done in the underground tour?

The dwarf had need of his bright eyes and his skilful hands; for the
soft, tiny foot intrusted to him was a mere baby, that had to find its
way through a strange, dark world; and, what was more, it must not only
be guided, but also fed and tended carefully: so the bright eyes go
before, and the brown fingers dig out a roadway, and the foot that has
learned to trust its guide utterly follows on. There is no longer any
danger: he runs against no rocks; he loses his way among no tangled
roots; and the hard earth seems to open gently before him, leading him
to the fields where his own best food lies, and to hidden springs of
sweet, fresh water.

Do you wonder when I say the foot must be fed? Aren't your feet fed? To
be sure, your feet have no mouths of their own; but doesn't the mouth in
your face eat for your whole body, hands and feet, ears and eyes, and
all the rest? else how do they grow? The only difference here between
you and Alba is, that his foot has mouths of its own, and as it wanders
on through the earth, and finds any thing good for food, eats both for
itself and for the rest of the body; for I must tell you, that, as the
little foot progresses, it does not take the body with it, but only
grows longer and longer and longer, until, while one end remains at home
fastened to the body, the other end has travelled a distance, such as
would be counted miles by the atoms of people who live in the under-
world. And, moreover, the foot no longer goes on alone: others have come
by tens, even by hundreds, to join it; and Alba begins to understand
what the dwarf meant by thousands. Thus the feet travel on, running some
to this side, some to that; here digging through a bed of clay, and
there burying themselves in a soft sand-hill, taking a mouthful of
carbon here, and of nitrogen there. But what are these two strange
articles of food? Nothing at all like bread and butter, you think.
Different, indeed, they seem; but you will one day learn that bread and
butter are made in part of these very same things, and they are just as
useful to Alba as your breakfast, dinner, and supper are to you. For
just as bread and butter, and other food, build your body, so carbon and
nitrogen are going to build his; and you will presently see what a fine,
large, strong body they can make. Then, perhaps, you will be better able
to understand what they are.

Shall we leave the feet to travel their own way for a while, and see
where the fairy has led the little hand?






It was a soft, helpless, little baby hand. Its folded fingers lay
listlessly in the fairy's gentle grasp. "Now we will go up," she said.
He had thought he was going down, and he had heard the chipping-birds
say he would never come back again. But he had no will to resist the
gentle motion, which seemed, after all, to be exactly what he wanted: so
he presently found himself lifted out of the dark earth, feeling the
sunshine again, and stirred by the breeze that rustled the dry leaves
that lay all about him. Here again were all his old companions,--the
chipping-birds, his cousins, old grandfather Rubra, and, best of all,
his dear mother. But the odd thing about it all was, that nobody seemed
to know him: even his mother, though she stretched her arms towards him,
turned her head away, looking here and there for her lost baby, and
never seeing how he stood gazing up into her face. Now he began to
understand why the chipping-birds said, "They never came back! they
never came back!" for they truly came in so new a form that none of
their old friends recognized them.

Every thing that has hands wants to work; that is, hands are such
excellent tools, that no one who is the happy possessor of a pair is
quite happy until he uses them: so Alba began to have a longing desire
to build a stem, and lift himself up among his neighbors. But what
should he build with? Here the little feet answered promptly, "You want
to build, do you? Well, here is carbon, the very best material; there is
nothing like it for walls; it makes the most beautiful, firm wood. Wait
a minute, and we will send up some that we have been storing for your
use."

And the busy hands go to work, and the child grows day by day. His body
and limbs are brown now, but his hands of a fine shining green. And,
having learned the use of carbon, these busy hands undertake to gather
it for themselves out of the air about them, which is a great storehouse
full of many materials that our eyes cannot see. And he has also learned
that to grow and to build are indeed the same thing: for his body is
taking the form of a strong young tree; his branches are spreading for a
roof over the heads of a hundred delicate flowers, making a home for
many a bushy-tailed squirrel and pleasant-voiced wood-bird. For, you
see, whoever builds cannot build for himself alone: all his neighbors
have the benefit of his work, and all enjoy it together.

What at the first was so hard to attempt, became grand and beautiful in
the doing; and little Alba, instead of serving merely for a squirrel's
breakfast, as he might have done had he not bravely ventured on his
journey, stands before us a noble tree, which is to live a hundred years
or more.

Do you want to know what kind of a tree?

Well, Lillie, who studies Latin, will tell you that Quercus means oak.
And now can you tell me what Alba's rustic cradle was, and who were his
cousins Rubra and Coccinea?

We all have our treasure-boxes. Misers have strong iron-bound chests
full of gold; stately ladies, pearl inlaid caskets for their jewels; and
even you and I, dear child, have our own. Your little box with lock and
key, that aunt Lucy gave you, where you have kept for a long time your
choicest paper doll, the peacock with spun-glass tail, and the robin's
egg that we picked up on the path under the great trees that windy day
last spring,--that is your treasure-box. I no less have mine; and, if
you will look with me, I will show you how the trees and flowers have
theirs, and what is packed away in them.

Come out in the orchard this September day, under the low-bowed peach-
trees, where great downy-cheeked peaches almost drop into our hands. Sit
on the grassy bank with me, and I will show you the peach-tree's
treasure-box.

What does the peach-tree regard as most precious? If it could speak in
words, it would tell you its seed is the one thing for which it cares
most; for which it has worked ever since spring, storing food, and
drinking in sunshine. And it is so dear and valued, because, when the
peach-tree itself dies, this seed, its child, may still live on, growing
into a beautiful and fruitful tree; therefore, the mother tree cherishes
her seed as her greatest treasure, and has made for it a casket more
beautiful than Mrs. Williams's sandal-wood jewel-box.

See the great crack where this peach broke from the bough. We will pull
it open; this is opening the cover of the outside casket. See how rich
was its outside color, but how wonderfully beautiful the deep crimson
fibres which cling about the hard shell inside. For this seed cannot be
trusted in a single covering; moreover, the inner box is locked
securely, and, I am sorry to say, we haven't the key: so, if I would
show you the inside, we must break the pretty box, with its strong,
ribbed walls, and then at last we shall see what the peach-tree's
treasure-box holds.

Here, too, are the apples, lying on the grass at our feet; we will cut
one, for it too holds the apple-tree's treasure. First comes the skin,
rosy and yellow, a pretty firm wrapping for the outside; but it
sometimes breaks, when a strong wind tosses the apples to the ground,
and sometimes the insects eat holes in it: so, if this were the only
covering, the treasure would hardly be very safe. Therefore, next we
come to the firm, juicy flesh of the apple,--seldom to be broken through
by a fall, not often eaten through by insects; but lest even this should
fail, we come at last, far in the middle, to horny sheaths, or cells,
built up together like a little fortress, surrounding and protecting the
brown, shining seeds, which we reach in the very centre of all.

One thing more let us look at before we leave the apple. Cut it
horizontally through the middle with a sharp knife, and try how thin and
smooth a slice you can make; hold it up to the light, and we shall see
something very beautiful. There in the centre of the round slice is the
delicate figure of a perfect apple-blossom, with all its petals spread;
for it was that lovely pink-and-white blossom from which the apple was
formed,--a tiny green ball at first, which you may see in the spring, if
you look where the blossoms have just fallen. As this little green apple
grew, it kept in its very heart always the image of the fair blossom;
and now that the fruit has reached this ripe perfection, we may still
see the same form.

The pears, too, the apricots and plums, you may see for yourselves; you
do not need me to tell their stories.

But come down to the garden, for there I have some of the oddest and
prettiest boxes to show. The pease and beans have long canoes, satin-
lined and waterproof. On what voyage they are bound, I cannot say.

The tall milk-weed that grew so fast all summer, and threatened to over-
run the garden, now pays well for its lodging by the exquisite treasure
which its rough-covered, pale-green bag holds. Press your thumb on its
closed edges; for this casket opens with a spring, and, if it is ripe
and ready, it will unclose with a touch, and show you a little fish,
with silver scales laid over a covering of long, silken threads, finer
and more delicate than any of the sewing-silk in your mother's work-box.
This silk is really a wing-like float for each scale; and the scales are
seeds, which will not stay upon the little fish, but long to float away
with their silken trails, and, alighting here and there, cling and seek
for a good place to plant themselves.

See, too, how the poppy has provided herself with a deep, round box of a
delicate brown color; the carved lid might have been made by the
Chinese, it looks so much like their fine work. Full to the brim, this
box is. The poppy is rich in the autumn; brown seeds by the hundred,
packed away for another year's use.

Here are the balsams,--touch-me-nots, we used to call them when I was a
child; for, Poor things, so slightly have they locked up their treasure,
that even the baby's little finger will open the rough-feeling oblong
casket with a snap and a spring, and send the jewels flying all over the
garden-bed, where you will scarcely be able to find them again.

Roses have beautiful round, red globes to hold their precious seeds; and
so firm and strong are they, that the winter winds and snows even do not
break or open them. I have found them dashed with sea-spray, or on dusty
roadsides; everywhere strong and safe, making the dullest day bright
with their cheery color.

If we go to the wet meadows and stream-sides, we shall find how the
scarlet cardinal has packed away its minute seeds in a pretty little box
with two or three partings inside; and the cowslip has a cluster of oval
bags as full as they can hold.

Among the rocks, hairballs have their tiny five-parted chests; and the
columbine, its standing group of narrow brown sacks, which show, if we
open them, hundreds of tiny seeds.

But in the woods, the oak has stored her treasures in the acorn; the
chestnut, in its bur which holds the nut so safely. The walnut and beech
trees have also their hard, safe caskets, and the boys who go nutting
know very well what is inside.

Autumn is the time to open these treasures. It takes all the spring and
summer to prepare them, and some even need all of September too, before
they are ready to open the little covers. But go into the garden and
orchard, into the meadows and woods, and you have not far to look before
finding enough to prove that the plants, no less than the children, have
treasures to keep, and often most charming boxes to keep them in.






Once there was a father who thought he would build for his children a
beautiful home, putting into it every thing they could need or desire
throughout their lives. So he built the beautiful house; and any one
just to look at the outside of it would exclaim, How lovely! For its
roof was a wide, blue dome like the sky, and the lofty rooms had arching
ceilings covered with tracery of leaves and waving boughs. The floors
were carpeted with velvet, and the whole was lighted with lamps that
shone like stars from above. The sweetest perfumes floated through the
air, while thousands of birds answered the music of fountains with their
songs. And yet, when you have seen all this, you have not seen the best
part of it: for the house has been so wonderfully contrived, that it is
full of mysterious closets, storehouses, and secret drawers, all locked
by magic keys, or fastened by concealed springs; and each one is filled
with something precious or useful or beautiful to look at,--piles upon
piles, and heaps upon heaps of wonderful stores. Every thing that the
children could want, or dream of wanting, is laid up here; but yet they
are not to be told any thing about it. They are to be put into this
delightful home, and left to find it all out for themselves.

At first, you know, they will only play. They will roll on the soft
carpets, and listen to the fountain and the birds, and wander from room
to room to see new beauties everywhere; but some day a boy, full of
curiosity, prying here and there into nooks and corners, will touch one
of the hidden springs; a door will fly open, and one storehouse of
treasures will be revealed. How he will shout, and call upon his
brothers and sisters to admire with him; how they will pull out the
treasures, and try to learn how to use the new and strange materials.
What did my father mean this for? Why did he give that so odd a shape,
or so strange a covering? And so through many questions, and many
experiments, they learn at last how to use the contents of this one
storehouse. But do you imagine that sensible children, after one such
discovery, would rest satisfied? Of course they would explore and
explore; try every panel, and press every spring, until, one by one, all
the closets should be opened, and all the treasures brought out. And
then how could they show their gratitude to the dear father who had
taken such pains to prepare this wonderful house for them? The least
they could do would be to try to use every thing for the purposes
intended, and not to destroy or injure any of the precious gifts
prepared so lovingly for their use.

Now, God, our loving Father, has made for us, for you and for me and for
little Mage and Jenny, and for all the grown people and children too,
just such a house. It is this earth on which we live. You can see the
blue roof, and the arched ceilings of the rooms, with their canopy of
leaves and drooping boughs, and the velvet-covered floors, and the
lights and birds and fountains; but do you know any of the secret
closets? Have you found the key or spring of a single one, or been
called by your mother or father or brother or sister to take a peep into
one of them?

If you have not, perhaps you would like to go with me to examine one
that was opened a good many years ago, but contains such valuable things
that the uses of all of them have not yet been found out, and their
beauty is just beginning to be known.

The doorway of this storehouse lies in the side of a hill. It is twice
as wide as the great barn-door where the hay-carts are driven in; and
two railroad-tracks run out at it, side by side, with a little foot-path
between them. The entrance is light, because it opens so wide; but we
can see that the floor slopes downward, and the way looks dark and
narrow before us. We shall need a guide; and here comes one,--a rough-
looking man, with smutty clothes, and an odd little lamp covered with
wire gauze, fastened to the front of his cap. He is one of the workmen
employed to bring the treasures out of this dark storehouse; and he will
show us, by the light of his lamp, some of the wonders of the place.
Walk down the sloping foot-path now, and be careful to keep out of the
way of the little cars that are coming and going on each side of you,
loaded on one side, and empty on the other, and seeming to run up and
down by themselves. But you will find that they are really pulled and
pushed by an engine that stands outside the doorway and reaches them by
long chains. At last we reach the foot of the slope; and, as our eyes
become accustomed to the faint light, we can see passages leading to the
right and the left, and square chambers cut out in the solid hill. So
this great green hill, upon which you might run or play, is inside like
what I think some of those large anthills must be,--traversed by
galleries, and full of rooms and long passages. All about we see men
like our guide, working by the light of their little lamps. We hear the
echoing sound of the tools; and we see great blocks and heaps that they
have broken away, and loaded into little cars that stand ready, here and
there, to be drawn by mules to the foot of the slope.

Now, are you curious to know what this treasure is? Have you seen
already that it is only coal, and do you wonder that I think it is so
precious? Look a little closer, while our guide lets the light of his
lamp fall upon the black wall at your side. Do you see the delicate
tracery of ferns, more beautiful than the fairest drawing. See, beneath
your feet is the marking of great tree-trunks lying aslant across the
floor, and the forms of gigantic palm-leaves strewed among them. Here is
something different, rounded like a nut-shell; you can split off one
side, and behold there is the nut lying snugly as does any chestnut in
its bur!

Did you notice the great pillars of coal that are left to uphold the
roof? Let us look at them; for perhaps we can examine them more closely
than we can the roof, and the sides of these halls. Here are mosses and
little leaves, and sometimes an odd-looking little body that is not
unlike some of the sea-creatures we found at the beach last summer; and
every thing is made of coal, nothing but coal. How did it happen, and
what does it mean? Ferns and palms, mosses and trees and animals, all
perfect, all beautiful, and yet all hidden away under this hill, and
turned into shining black coal.

Now, I can very well remember when I first saw a coal fire, and how odd
it looked to see what seemed to be burning stones. For, when I was a
little girl, we always had logs of wood blazing in an open fireplace,
and so did many other people, and coal was just coming into use for
fuel. What should we have done, if everybody had kept on burning wood to
this day? There would have been scarcely a tree left standing; for think
of all the locomotives and engines in factories, besides all the fires
in houses and churches and schoolhouses. But God knew that we should
have need of other fuel besides wood, and so he made great forests to
grow on the earth before he had made any men to live upon it. These
forests were of trees, different in some ways from those we have now,
great ferns as tall as this house, and mosses as high as little trees,
and palm-leaves of enormous size. And, when they were all prepared, he
planned how they should best be stored up for the use of his children,
who would not be here to use them for many thousand years to come. So he
let them grow and ripen and fall to the ground, and then the great rocks
were piled above them to crowd them compactly together, and they were
heated and heavily pressed, until, as the ages went by, they changed
slowly into these hard, black, shining stones, and became better fuel
than any wood, because the substance of wood was concentrated in them.
Then the hills were piled up on top of it all; but here and there some
edge of a coal-bed was tilted up, and appeared above the ground. This
served for a hint to curious men, to make them ask "What is this?" and
"What is it good for?" and so at last, following their questions, to
find their way to the secret stores, and make an open doorway, and let
the world in. So much for the fuel; but God meant something else besides
fuel when he packed this closet for his children. At first they only
understood this simplest and plainest value of the coal. But there were
some things that troubled the miners very much: one was gas that would
take fire from their lamps, and burn, making it dangerous for men to go
into the passages where they were likely to meet it. But by and by the
wise men thought about it, and said to themselves, We must find out what
useful purpose God made the gas for: we know that he does not make any
thing for harm only. The thought came to them that it might be prepared
from coal, and conducted through pipes to our houses to take the place
of lamps or candles, which until that time had been the only light. But,
after making the gas, there was a thick, pitchy substance left from the
coal, called coal-tar. It was only a trouble to the gas-makers, who had
no use for it, and even threw it away, until some one, more thoughtful
than the others, found out that water would not pass through it. And so
it began to be used to cover roofs of buildings, and, mixed with some
other substances, made a pavement for streets; and being spread over
iron-work it protected it from rust. Don't you see how many uses we have
found for this refuse coal-tar? And the finest of all is yet to come;
for the chemists got hold of it, and distilled and refined it, until
they prepared from the black, dirty pitch lovely emerald-colored
crystals which had the property of dying silk and cotton and wool in
beautiful colors,--violet, magenta, purple, or green. What do you think
of that from the coal-tar. When you have a new ribbon for your hat; or a
pretty red dress, or your grandmamma buys a new violet ribbon for her
cap, just ask if they are dyed with aniline colors; and if the answer is
"Yes," you may know that they came from the coal-tar. Besides the dyes,
we shall also have left naphtha, useful in making varnish, and various
oils that are used in more ways than I can stop to tell you, or you
would care now to hear. If your cousin Annie has a jet belt-clasp or
bracelet, and if you find in aunt Edith's box of old treasures an odd-
shaped brooch of jet, you may remember the coal again; for jet is only
one kind of lignite, which is a name for a certain preparation of coal.

But here is another surprise of a different kind. You have seen boxes of
hard, smooth, white candles with the name paraffin marked on the cover.
Should you think the black coal could ever undergo such a change as to
come out in the form of these white candles? Go to the factory where
they are made, and you can see the whole process; and then you will
understand one more of God's meanings for coal.

And all this time I have not said a word about how, while the great
forests lay under pressure for millions of years, the oils that were in
the growing plants (just as oils are in many growing plants now) were
pressed out, and flowed into underground reservoirs, lying hidden there,
until one day not many years ago a man accidentally bored into one. Up
came the oil, spouting and running over, gushing out and streaming down
to a little river that ran near by. As it floated on the surface of the
water (for oil and water will not mix, you know), the boys, for
mischief, set fire to it, and a stream of fire rolled along down the
river; proving to everybody who saw it, that a new light, as good as
gas, had come from the coal. Now those of us who have kerosene lamps may
thank the oil-wells that were prepared for us so many years ago.

When your hands or lips are cracked and rough from the cold, does your
mother ever put on glycerin to heal them? If she does, you are indebted
again to the coal oil, for of that it is partly made.

And now let me tell you that almost all the uses for coal have been
found out since I was a child; and, by the time you are men and women,
you may be sure that as many more will be discovered, if not from that
storehouse, certainly from some of the many others that our good Father
has prepared for us, and hidden among the mountains or in the deserts,
or perhaps under your very feet to-day; for thousands of people walked
over those hills of coal, before one saw the treasures that lay hidden
there. I have only told you enough to teach you how to look for
yourselves; a peep, you know, is all I promised you. Sometime we may
open another door together.






There were plenty of gold-green beetles in the forest. Their violet-
colored cousins also held royal state there; and scarlet or yellow with
black trimmings was the uniform of many a gay troop that careered in
splendor through the vine-hung aisles of the hot, damp woods. But
clinging to the gray bark of some tree, or lying concealed among the
damp leaves in a swamp, was the gayest and fairest of them all, if the
truth be told.

A little blackish-brown bug, dingy and hairy, not pleasant to look upon,
you will say; surely not related to such winged splendors as play in the
sunlight. Yet he is true first cousin to the green and gold, or to the
royal violet; has as fair a title to a place in your regard, and will
prove it, if you will only wait his time. He is like those plain people
whom we pass every day without notice, until some great trial or
difficulty calls out a hidden power within them, and they flash into
greatness in some noble action, and prove their kinship to God.

We need not wait long; for as soon as the sun has set, our dull,
blackish bug unfolds his wings and reveals his latent glory. He becomes
a star, a spark from the sun's very self. If you can prevail upon him to
condescend to attend you, you may read or write by his light alone.

But come with me to this Indian's hut, where instead of lamp, candle, or
torch, three or four of these luminous insects make all the dwelling
bright. See the Indian hunter preparing for a journey, or a raid upon
the forest beasts, by fastening to his hands and feet the little
lantern-flies that shall make the pathway light before him.

When the Indian wants his brilliant little servants, he goes out on some
little hillock, waving a lighted torch and calling them by name,
"cucuie, cucuie;" and quickly they crowd around him in troops.

And here I must tell you a little Japanese story. The young lady fire-
fly is courted by her many suitors, who themselves carry no light. She
is shy and reserved. She will not accept the attentions; but when so
importuned that she sees no other escape, she cries, "Let him who really
loves me, go bring me a light like my own, as a proof of his affection."
Then the daring lovers rush blindly at the nearest fire or candle, and
perish in the flame.

But to return to the Indian. Not only do his lantern-flies illuminate
his path, but they go on before him, like an advance guard, to clear the
road of its infecting mosquitoes, gnats, and other troublesome insects,
which they seize and devour on the wing.

No harm would the Indian do to his little torchbearer; for, besides the
service he renders, does he not embody a portion of the sun god, the
holy fire? And there are times, when, with reverent awe, these simple
forest children think they see in the cucuie the souls of their departed
friends.

And now if we leave the forest and enter the gay ball-room of some
tropical city, we shall find that the cucuie is a cosmopolitan, at home
alike in palace and in hut, in forest and city. Not only does he, as a
wise little four-year-old friend of mine said, "light the toads to bed,"
but, restrained by invisible folds of gauze, he flutters in the hair of
the fairest ladies, and rivals those earth-stars the diamonds.

But it is hardly fair to show only the bright side, even of a cucuie;
and in justice I must tell that the sugar-planters see with dismay their
little torches among the canes. For although mosquitoes and gnats will
do for food in the forests where sugar is not to be had, who would taste
them when a field of cane is all before you, where to choose?






Look at this mass of white jelly floating in a bowl of pond water. It is
clear and delicate, formed of little globes the size of pease, held
together in one rounded mass. In each globe is a black dot.

I have it all in my room, and I watch it every day. Before a week
passes, the black dots have lengthened into little fishy bodies, each
lying curled in his globe of jelly, for these globes are eggs, and these
dots are soon to be little living animals; we will see of what kind.

Presently they begin to jerk backwards and forwards, and perform such
simple gymnastics as the small accommodations of the egg will allow; and
at last one morning, to my delight, I find two or three of the little
things free from the egg, and swimming like so many tiny fishes in my
bowl of water. How fast they come out now; five this morning, but twenty
to-night, and thrice as many to-morrow! The next day I conclude that the
remaining eggs will not hatch, for they still show only dull, dead-
looking dots: so reluctantly I throw them away, wash out my bowl, and
fill it anew with pond water. But, before doing this, I had to catch all
my little family, and put them safely into a tumbler to remain during
their house-cleaning. This was hard work; but I accomplished it with the
help of a teaspoon, and soon restored them to a fresh, clean home.

It would be difficult to tell you all their history; for never did
little things grow faster, or change more wonderfully, than they.

One morning I found them all arranged round the sides of the bowl in
regular military ranks, as straight and stiff as a company on dress
parade. It was then that I counted them, and discovered that there were
just sixty-two.

You would think, at first sight, that these sixty-two brothers and
sisters were all exactly alike; but, after watching them a while, you
see that one begins to distinguish himself as stronger and more advanced
than any of the others,--the captain, perhaps, of the military company.
Soon he sports a pair of little feathery gills on each side of his head,
as a young officer might sport his mustache; but these gills, unlike the
mustache, are for use as well as for ornament, and serve him as
breathing tubes.

How the little fellows grow! no longer a slim little fish, but quite a
portly tadpole with rounded body and long tail, but still with no
expression in his blunt-nosed face, and only two black-looking pits
where the eyes are to grow.

The others are not slow to follow their captain's example. Day after day
some new little fellow shows his gills, and begins to swim by paddling
with his tail in a very stylish manner.

And now a sad thing happens to my family of sixty-two,--something which
would never have happened had I left the eggs at home in their own pond;
for there there are plenty of tiny water-plants, whose little leaves and
stems serve for many a delicious meal to young tadpoles. I did not feed
them, not knowing what to give them, and half imagining that they could
live very well upon water only; and so it happened that one morning,
when I was taking them out with a spoon as usual, to give them fresh
water, I counted only fifty. Where were the others?

At the bottom of the bowl lay a dozen little tails, and I was forced to
believe that the stronger tadpoles had taken their weaker brothers for
supper.

I didn't like to have my family broken up in this way, and yet I didn't
at that time know what to give them: so the painful proceeding was not
checked; and day after day my strongest tadpoles grew even stronger, and
the tails of the weaker lay at the bottom of the bowl.

The captain throve finely, had clear, bright eyes, lost his feathery
gills, and showed through his thin skin that he had a set of excellent
legs folded up inside. At last, one day, he kicked out the two hind
ones, and after that was never tired of displaying his new swimming
powers. The fore-legs following in due time; and when all this was done,
the tail, which he no longer needed to steer with, dropped off, and my
largest tadpole became a little frog.

His brothers and sisters, such of them as were left (for, I grieve to
say, he had required a great many hearty meals to enable him to reach
the frog state), followed his illustrious example as soon as they were
able; and then, of course, my little bowl of water was no suitable home
for them; so away they went out into the grass, among the shallow pools,
and into the swamps. I never knew exactly where; and I am afraid that,
should I meet even my progressive little captain again, I should hardly
recognize him, so grown and altered he would be. He no longer devours
his brothers, but, with a tongue as long as his body, seizes slugs and
insects, and swallows them whole.

In the winter he sleeps with his brothers and sisters, with the bottom
of some pond or marsh for a bed, where they all pack themselves away,
hundreds together, laid so closely that you can't distinguish one from
another.

But early in the spring you may hear their loud croaking; and when the
March sun has thawed the ice from the ponds, the mother-frogs are all
very busy with their eggs, which they leave in the shallow water,--round
jelly-like masses, like the one I told you of at the beginning of this
story, made up of hundreds and hundreds of eggs. For the frog mother
hopes for a large family of children, and she knows, by sad experience,
that no sooner are they born than the fishes snap them up by the dozen;
and even after they have found their legs, and begin to feel old, and
competent to take care of themselves, the snakes and the weasels will
not hesitate to take two or three for breakfast, if they come in the
way. So you see the mother-frog has good reason for laying so many eggs.

The toads too, who, by the way, are cousins to the frogs, come down in
April to lay their eggs also in the water,--long necklaces of a double
row of fine transparent eggs, each one showing its black dot, which is
to grow into a tadpole, and swim about with its cousins, the frog
tadpoles, while they all look so much alike that I fancy their own
mothers do not know them apart.

I once picked up a handful of them, and took them home. One grew up to
be a charming little tree-toad, while some of his companions gave good
promise, by their big awkward forms, of growing by and by into great
bull-frogs.






Do you know that flowers, as well as people, live in families? Come into
the garden, and I will show you how. Here is a red rose: the beautiful
bright-colored petals are the walls of the house,--built in a circle,
you see. Next come the yellow stamens, standing also in a circle: these
are the father of the household,--perhaps you would say the fathers,
there are so many. They stand round the mother, who lives in the very
middle, as if they were put there to protect and take care of her. And
she is the straight little pistil, standing in the midst of all. The
children are seeds, put away for the present in a green cradle at their
mother's feet, where they will sleep and grow as babies should, until by
and by they will all have opportunities to come out and build for
themselves fine rose-colored houses like that of their parents.

It is in this way that most of the flowers live; some, it is true, quite
differently: for the beautiful scarlet maple blossoms, that open so
early in the spring, have the fathers on one tree, and the mothers on
another; and they can only make flying visits to each other when a high
wind chooses to give them a ride.

The golden-rod and asters and some of their cousins have yet another way
of living, and it is of this I must tell you to-day.

You know the roadside asters, purple and white, that bloom so
plenteously all through the early autumn? Each flower is a circle of
little rays, spreading on every side: but, if you should pull it to
pieces to look for a family like that of the rose, you would be sadly
confused about it; for the aster's plan of living is very different from
the rose's. Each purple or white ray is a little home in itself; and
these are all inhabited by maiden ladies, living each one alone in the
one delicately colored room of her house. But in the middle of the aster
you will find a dozen or more little families, all packed away together.
Each one has its own small, yellow house, each has the father, mother,
and one child: they all live here together on the flat circle which is
called a disk; and round them are built the houses belonging to the
maiden aunts, who watch and protect the whole. This is what we might
call living in a community. People do so sometimes. Different families
who like to be near each other will take a very large house and inhabit
it together; so that in one house there will be many fathers, mothers,
and children, and very likely maiden aunts and bachelor uncles besides.

Do you understand now how the asters live in communities? The golden-rod
also lives in communities, but yet not exactly after the aster's plan,--
in smaller houses generally, and these of course contain fewer families.
Four or five of the maiden aunts live in yellow-walled rooms round the
outside; and in the middle live fathers, mothers, and children, as they
do in the asters. But here is the difference: if the golden-rod has
smaller houses, it has more of them together upon one stem. I have never
counted them, but you can, now that they are in bloom, and tell me how
many.

And have you ever noticed how gracefully these great companies are
arranged? For the golden-rods are like elm-trees in their forms: some
grow in one single, tall plume, bending over a little at the top; some
in a double or triple plume, so that the nodding heads may bend on each
side; but the largest are like the great Etruscan elms, many branches
rising gracefully from the main stem and curving over on every side,
like those tall glass vases which, I dare say, you have all seen.

Do not forget, when you are looking at these golden plumes, that each
one, as it tosses in the wind, is rocking its hundreds of little
dwellings, with the fathers, mothers, babies, and all.

When you go out for golden-rod and asters, you will find also the great
purple thistle, one of those cousins who has adopted the same plan of
living. It is so prickly that I advise you not to attempt breaking it
off, but only with your finger-tips push softly down into the purple
tassel; and if the thistle is ripe, as I think it will be in these
autumn days, you will feel a bed of softest down under the spreading
purple top. A little gentle pushing will set the down all astir, and I
can show you how the children are about to take leave of the home where
they were born and brought up. Each seed child has a downy wing with
which it can fly, and also cling, as you will see, if we set them loose,
and the wind blows them on to your woollen frock. They are hardy
children, and not afraid of any thing; they venture out into the world
fearlessly, and presume to plant themselves and prepare to build
wherever they choose, without regard to the rights of the farmer's
ploughed field or your mother's nicely laid out garden.

More of the community flowers are the immortelles, and in spring the
dandelions. Examine them, and tell me how they build their houses, and
what sort of families they have; how the children go away; when the
house is broken up; and what becomes of the fathers, mothers, and aunts.

Once upon a time in a certain country there lived a king whose palace
was surrounded by a spacious garden. But, though the gardeners were many
and the soil was good, this garden yielded neither flowers nor fruits,
not even grass or shady trees.

The King was in despair about it, when a wise old man said to him:

“Your gardeners do not understand their business: but what can you
expect of men whose fathers were cobblers and carpenters? How should
they have learned to cultivate your garden?”

“You are quite right,” cried the King.

“Therefore,” continued the old man, “you should send for a gardener
whose father and grandfather have been gardeners before him, and very
soon your garden will be full of green grass and gay flowers, and you
will enjoy its delicious fruit.”

So the King sent messengers to every town, village, and hamlet in his
dominions, to look for a gardener whose forefathers had been gardeners
also, and after forty days one was found.

“Come with us and be gardener to the King,” they said to him.

“How can I go to the King,” said the gardener, “a poor wretch like me?”

“That is of no consequence,” they answered. “Here are new clothes for
you and your family.”

“But I owe money to several people.”

“We will pay your debts,” they said.

So the gardener allowed himself to be persuaded, and went away with
the messengers, taking his wife and his son with him; and the King,
delighted to have found a real gardener, entrusted him with the care
of his garden. The man found no difficulty in making the royal garden
produce flowers and fruit, and at the end of a year the park was not
like the same place, and the King showered gifts upon his new servant.

The gardener, as you have heard already, had a son, who was a very
handsome young man, with most agreeable manners, and every day he
carried the best fruit of the garden to the King, and all the prettiest
flowers to his daughter. Now this princess was wonderfully pretty and
was just sixteen years old, and the King was beginning to think it was
time that she should be married.

“My dear child,” said he, “you are of an age to take a husband,
therefore I am thinking of marrying you to the son of my prime minister.

“Father,” replied the Princess, “I will never marry the son of the
minister.”

“Why not?” asked the King.

“Because I love the gardener’s son,” answered the Princess.

On hearing this the King was at first very angry, and then he wept and
sighed, and declared that such a husband was not worthy of his daughter;
but the young Princess was not to be turned from her resolution to marry
the gardener’s son.

Then the King consulted his ministers. “This is what you must do,” they
said. “To get rid of the gardener you must send both suitors to a
very distant country, and the one who returns first shall marry your
daughter.”

The King followed this advice, and the minister’s son was presented with
a splendid horse and a purse full of gold pieces, while the gardener’s
son had only an old lame horse and a purse full of copper money, and
every one thought he would never come back from his journey.

The day before they started the Princess met her lover and said to him:

“Be brave, and remember always that I love you. Take this purse full of
jewels and make the best use you can of them for love of me, and come
back quickly and demand my hand.”

The two suitors left the town together, but the minister’s son went off
at a gallop on his good horse, and very soon was lost to sight behind
the most distant hills. He traveled on for some days, and presently
reached a fountain beside which an old woman all in rags sat upon a
stone.

“Good-day to you, young traveler,” said she.

But the minister’s son made no reply.

“Have pity upon me, traveler,” she said again. “I am dying of hunger,
as you see, and three days have I been here and no one has given me
anything.”

“Let me alone, old witch,” cried the young man; “I can do nothing for
you,” and so saying he went on his way.

That same evening the gardener’s son rode up to the fountain upon his
lame gray horse.

“Good-day to you, young traveler,” said the beggar-woman.

“Good-day, good woman,” answered he.

“Young traveler, have pity upon me.”

“Take my purse, good woman,” said he, “and mount behind me, for your
legs can’t be very strong.”

The old woman didn’t wait to be asked twice, but mounted behind him,
and in this style they reached the chief city of a powerful kingdom. The
minister’s son was lodged in a grand inn, the gardener’s son and the old
woman dismounted at the inn for beggars.

The next day the gardener’s son heard a great noise in the street, and
the King’s heralds passed, blowing all kinds of instruments, and crying:

“The King, our master, is old and infirm. He will give a great reward to
whoever will cure him and give him back the strength of his youth.”

Then the old beggar-woman said to her benefactor:

“This is what you must do to obtain the reward which the King promises.
Go out of the town by the south gate, and there you will find three
little dogs of different colors; the first will be white, the second
black, the third red. You must kill them and then burn them separately,
and gather up the ashes. Put the ashes of each dog into a bag of its own
color, then go before the door of the palace and cry out, ‘A celebrated
physician has come from Janina in Albania. He alone can cure the King
and give him back the strength of his youth.’ The King’s physicians will
say, This is an impostor, and not a learned man,’ and they will make all
sorts of difficulties, but you will overcome them all at last, and will
present yourself before the sick King. You must then demand as much wood
as three mules can carry, and a great cauldron, and must shut yourself
up in a room with the Sultan, and when the cauldron boils you must throw
him into it, and there leave him until his flesh is completely separated
from his bones. Then arrange the bones in their proper places, and throw
over them the ashes out of the three bags. The King will come back to
life, and will be just as he was when he was twenty years old. For your
reward you must demand the bronze ring which has the power to grant
you everything you desire. Go, my son, and do not forget any of my
instructions.”

The young man followed the old beggar-woman’s directions. On going out
of the town he found the white, red, and black dogs, and killed and
burnt them, gathering the ashes in three bags. Then he ran to the palace
and cried:

“A celebrated physician has just come from Janina in Albania. He alone
can cure the King and give him back the strength of his youth.”

The King’s physicians at first laughed at the unknown wayfarer, but the
Sultan ordered that the stranger should be admitted. They brought the
cauldron and the loads of wood, and very soon the King was boiling away.
Toward mid-day the gardener’s son arranged the bones in their places,
and he had hardly scattered the ashes over them before the old King
revived, to find himself once more young and hearty.

“How can I reward you, my benefactor?” he cried. “Will you take half my
treasures?”

“No,” said the gardener’s son.

“My daughter’s hand?”

“_No_.”

“Take half my kingdom.”

“No. Give me only the bronze ring which can instantly grant me anything
I wish for.”

“Alas!” said the King, “I set great store by that marvelous ring;
nevertheless, you shall have it.” And he gave it to him.

The gardener’s son went back to say good-by to the old beggar-woman;
then he said to the bronze ring:

“Prepare a splendid ship in which I may continue my journey. Let the
hull be of fine gold, the masts of silver, the sails of brocade; let
the crew consist of twelve young men of noble appearance, dressed like
kings. St. Nicholas will be at the helm. As to the cargo, let it be
diamonds, rubies, emeralds, and carbuncles.”

And immediately a ship appeared upon the sea which resembled in every
particular the description given by the gardener’s son, and, stepping
on board, he continued his journey. Presently he arrived at a great town
and established himself in a wonderful palace. After several days he
met his rival, the minister’s son, who had spent all his money and was
reduced to the disagreeable employment of a carrier of dust and rubbish.
The gardener’s son said to him:

“What is your name, what is your family, and from what country do you
come?”

“I am the son of the prime minister of a great nation, and yet see what
a degrading occupation I am reduced to.”

“Listen to me; though I don’t know anything more about you, I am willing
to help you. I will give you a ship to take you back to your own country
upon one condition.”

“Whatever it may be, I accept it willingly.”

“Follow me to my palace.”

The minister’s son followed the rich stranger, whom he had not
recognized. When they reached the palace the gardener’s son made a sign
to his slaves, who completely undressed the new-comer.

“Make this ring red-hot,” commanded the master, “and mark the man with
it upon his back.”

The slaves obeyed him.

“Now, young man,” said the rich stranger, “I am going to give you a
vessel which will take you back to your own country.”

And, going out, he took the bronze ring and said:

“Bronze ring, obey thy master. Prepare me a ship of which the
half-rotten timbers shall be painted black, let the sails be in rags,
and the sailors infirm and sickly. One shall have lost a leg, another
an arm, the third shall be a hunchback, another lame or club-footed or
blind, and most of them shall be ugly and covered with scars. Go, and
let my orders be executed.”

The minister’s son embarked in this old vessel, and thanks to favorable
winds, at length reached his own country. In spite of the pitiable
condition in which he returned they received him joyfully.

“I am the first to come back,” said he to the King; now fulfil your
promise, and give me the princess in marriage.

So they at once began to prepare for the wedding festivities. As to the
poor princess, she was sorrowful and angry enough about it.

The next morning, at daybreak, a wonderful ship with every sail set came
to anchor before the town. The King happened at that moment to be at the
palace window.

“What strange ship is this,” he cried, “that has a golden hull, silver
masts, and silken sails, and who are the young men like princes who man
it? And do I not see St. Nicholas at the helm? Go at once and invite the
captain of the ship to come to the palace.”

His servants obeyed him, and very soon in came an enchantingly handsome
young prince, dressed in rich silk, ornamented with pearls and diamonds.

“Young man,” said the King, “you are welcome, whoever you may be. Do me
the favor to be my guest as long as you remain in my capital.”

“Many thanks, sire,” replied the captain, “I accept your offer.”

“My daughter is about to be married,” said the King; “will you give her
away?”

“I shall be charmed, sire.”

Soon after came the Princess and her betrothed.

“Why, how is this?” cried the young captain; “would you marry this
charming princess to such a man as that?”

“But he is my prime minister’s son!”

“What does that matter? I cannot give your daughter away. The man she is
betrothed to is one of my servants.”

“Your servant?”

“Without doubt. I met him in a distant town reduced to carrying away
dust and rubbish from the houses. I had pity on him and engaged him as
one of my servants.”

“It is impossible!” cried the King.

“Do you wish me to prove what I say? This young man returned in a vessel
which I fitted out for him, an unseaworthy ship with a black battered
hull, and the sailors were infirm and crippled.”

“It is quite true,” said the King.

“It is false,” cried the minister’s son. “I do not know this man!”

“Sire,” said the young captain, “order your daughter’s betrothed to be
stripped, and see if the mark of my ring is not branded upon his back.”

The King was about to give this order, when the minister’s son, to save
himself from such an indignity, admitted that the story was true.

“And now, sire,” said the young captain, “do you not recognize me?”

“I recognize you,” said the Princess; “you are the gardener’s son whom I
have always loved, and it is you I wish to marry.”

“Young man, you shall be my son-in-law,” cried the King. “The marriage
festivities are already begun, so you shall marry my daughter this very
day.”

And so that very day the gardener’s son married the beautiful Princess.

Several months passed. The young couple were as happy as the day was
long, and the King was more and more pleased with himself for having
secured such a son-in-law.

But, presently, the captain of the golden ship found it necessary to
take a long voyage, and after embracing his wife tenderly he embarked.

Now in the outskirts of the capital there lived an old man, who had
spent his life in studying black arts--alchemy, astrology, magic,
and enchantment. This man found out that the gardener’s son had only
succeeded in marrying the Princess by the help of the genii who obeyed
the bronze ring.

“I will have that ring,” said he to himself. So he went down to the
sea-shore and caught some little red fishes. Really, they were
quite wonderfully pretty. Then he came back, and, passing before the
Princess’s window, he began to cry out:

“Who wants some pretty little red fishes?”

The Princess heard him, and sent out one of her slaves, who said to the
old peddler:

“What will you take for your fish?”

“A bronze ring.”

“A bronze ring, old simpleton! And where shall I find one?”

“Under the cushion in the Princess’s room.”

The slave went back to her mistress.

“The old madman will take neither gold nor silver,” said she.

“What does he want then?”

“A bronze ring that is hidden under a cushion.”

“Find the ring and give it to him,” said the Princess.

And at last the slave found the bronze ring, which the captain of the
golden ship had accidentally left behind and carried it to the man, who
made off with it instantly.

Hardly had he reached his own house when, taking the ring, he said,
“Bronze ring, obey thy master. I desire that the golden ship shall turn
to black wood, and the crew to hideous negroes; that St. Nicholas shall
leave the helm and that the only cargo shall be black cats.”

And the genii of the bronze ring obeyed him.

Finding himself upon the sea in this miserable condition, the young
captain understood that some one must have stolen the bronze ring from
him, and he lamented his misfortune loudly; but that did him no good.

“Alas!” he said to himself, “whoever has taken my ring has probably
taken my dear wife also. What good will it do me to go back to my own
country?” And he sailed about from island to island, and from shore to
shore, believing that wherever he went everybody was laughing at him,
and very soon his poverty was so great that he and his crew and the poor
black cats had nothing to eat but herbs and roots. After wandering about
a long time he reached an island inhabited by mice. The captain landed
upon the shore and began to explore the country. There were mice
everywhere, and nothing but mice. Some of the black cats had followed
him, and, not having been fed for several days, they were fearfully
hungry, and made terrible havoc among the mice.

Then the queen of the mice held a council.

“These cats will eat every one of us,” she said, “if the captain of the
ship does not shut the ferocious animals up. Let us send a deputation to
him of the bravest among us.”

Several mice offered themselves for this mission and set out to find the
young captain.

“Captain,” said they, “go away quickly from our island, or we shall
perish, every mouse of us.”

“Willingly,” replied the young captain, “upon one condition. That is
that you shall first bring me back a bronze ring which some clever
magician has stolen from me. If you do not do this I will land all my
cats upon your island, and you shall be exterminated.”

The mice withdrew in great dismay. “What is to be done?” said the Queen.
“How can we find this bronze ring?” She held a new council, calling in
mice from every quarter of the globe, but nobody knew where the bronze
ring was. Suddenly three mice arrived from a very distant country. One
was blind, the second lame, and the third had her ears cropped.

“Ho, ho, ho!” said the new-comers. “We come from a far distant country.”

“Do you know where the bronze ring is which the genii obey?”

“Ho, ho, ho! we know; an old sorcerer has taken possession of it, and
now he keeps it in his pocket by day and in his mouth by night.”

“Go and take it from him, and come back as soon as possible.”

So the three mice made themselves a boat and set sail for the magician’s
country. When they reached the capital they landed and ran to the
palace, leaving only the blind mouse on the shore to take care of the
boat. Then they waited till it was night. The wicked old man lay down in
bed and put the bronze ring into his mouth, and very soon he was asleep.

“Now, what shall we do?” said the two little animals to each other.

The mouse with the cropped ears found a lamp full of oil and a bottle
full of pepper. So she dipped her tail first in the oil and then in the
pepper, and held it to the sorcerer’s nose.

“Atisha! atisha!” sneezed the old man, but he did not wake, and the
shock made the bronze ring jump out of his mouth. Quick as thought the
lame mouse snatched up the precious talisman and carried it off to the
boat.

Imagine the despair of the magician when he awoke and the bronze ring
was nowhere to be found!

But by that time our three mice had set sail with their prize. A
favoring breeze was carrying them toward the island where the queen
of the mice was awaiting them. Naturally they began to talk about the
bronze ring.

“Which of us deserves the most credit?” they cried all at once.

“I do,” said the blind mouse, “for without my watchfulness our boat
would have drifted away to the open sea.”

“No, indeed,” cried the mouse with the cropped ears; “the credit is
mine. Did I not cause the ring to jump out of the man’s mouth?”

“No, it is mine,” cried the lame one, “for I ran off with the ring.”

And from high words they soon came to blows, and, alas! when the quarrel
was fiercest the bronze ring fell into the sea.

“How are we to face our queen,” said the three mice “when by our
folly we have lost the talisman and condemned our people to be utterly
exterminated? We cannot go back to our country; let us land on this
desert island and there end our miserable lives.” No sooner said than
done. The boat reached the island, and the mice landed.

The blind mouse was speedily deserted by her two sisters, who went off
to hunt flies, but as she wandered sadly along the shore she found a
dead fish, and was eating it, when she felt something very hard. At her
cries the other two mice ran up.

“It is the bronze ring! It is the talisman!” they cried joyfully, and,
getting into their boat again, they soon reached the mouse island. It
was time they did, for the captain was just going to land his cargo of
cats, when a deputation of mice brought him the precious bronze ring.

“Bronze ring,” commanded the young man, “obey thy master. Let my ship
appear as it was before.”

Immediately the genii of the ring set to work, and the old black vessel
became once more the wonderful golden ship with sails of brocade; the
handsome sailors ran to the silver masts and the silken ropes, and very
soon they set sail for the capital.

Ah! how merrily the sailors sang as they flew over the glassy sea!

At last the port was reached.

The captain landed and ran to the palace, where he found the wicked
old man asleep. The Princess clasped her husband in a long embrace. The
magician tried to escape, but he was seized and bound with strong cords.

The next day the sorcerer, tied to the tail of a savage mule loaded with
nuts, was broken into as many pieces as there were nuts upon the mule’s
back.(1)

Once upon a time there lived a king who was deeply in love with a
princess, but she could not marry anyone, because she was under an
enchantment. So the King set out to seek a fairy, and asked what he
could do to win the Princess’s love. The Fairy said to him:

“You know that the Princess has a great cat which she is very fond of.
Whoever is clever enough to tread on that cat’s tail is the man she is
destined to marry.”

The King said to himself that this would not be very difficult, and he
left the Fairy, determined to grind the cat’s tail to powder rather than
not tread on it at all.

You may imagine that it was not long before he went to see the Princess,
and puss, as usual, marched in before him, arching his back. The King
took a long step, and quite thought he had the tail under his foot, but
the cat turned round so sharply that he only trod on air. And so it went
on for eight days, till the King began to think that this fatal tail
must be full of quicksilver--it was never still for a moment.

At last, however, he was lucky enough to come upon puss fast asleep and
with his tail conveniently spread out. So the King, without losing a
moment, set his foot upon it heavily.

With one terrific yell the cat sprang up and instantly changed into a
tall man, who, fixing his angry eyes upon the King, said:

“You shall marry the Princess because you have been able to break the
enchantment, but I will have my revenge. You shall have a son, who will
never be happy until he finds out that his nose is too long, and if you
ever tell anyone what I have just said to you, you shall vanish away
instantly, and no one shall ever see you or hear of you again.”

Though the King was horribly afraid of the enchanter, he could not help
laughing at this threat.

“If my son has such a long nose as that,” he said to himself, “he
must always see it or feel it; at least, if he is not blind or without
hands.”

But, as the enchanter had vanished, he did not waste any more time in
thinking, but went to seek the Princess, who very soon consented to
marry him. But after all, they had not been married very long when the
King died, and the Queen had nothing left to care for but her little
son, who was called Hyacinth. The little Prince had large blue eyes, the
prettiest eyes in the world, and a sweet little mouth, but, alas!
his nose was so enormous that it covered half his face. The Queen was
inconsolable when she saw this great nose, but her ladies assured her
that it was not really as large as it looked; that it was a Roman nose,
and you had only to open any history to see that every hero has a large
nose. The Queen, who was devoted to her baby, was pleased with what they
told her, and when she looked at Hyacinth again, his nose certainly did
not seem to her _quite_ so large.

The Prince was brought up with great care; and, as soon as he could
speak, they told him all sorts of dreadful stories about people who had
short noses. No one was allowed to come near him whose nose did not more
or less resemble his own, and the courtiers, to get into favor with the
Queen, took to pulling their babies’ noses several times every day
to make them grow long. But, do what they would, they were nothing by
comparison with the Prince’s.

When he grew sensible he learned history; and whenever any great prince
or beautiful princess was spoken of, his teachers took care to tell him
that they had long noses.

His room was hung with pictures, all of people with very large noses;
and the Prince grew up so convinced that a long nose was a great beauty,
that he would not on any account have had his own a single inch shorter!

When his twentieth birthday was passed the Queen thought it was time
that he should be married, so she commanded that the portraits of
several princesses should be brought for him to see, and among the
others was a picture of the Dear Little Princess!

Now, she was the daughter of a great king, and would some day possess
several kingdoms herself; but Prince Hyacinth had not a thought to spare
for anything of that sort, he was so much struck with her beauty. The
Princess, whom he thought quite charming, had, however, a little saucy
nose, which, in her face, was the prettiest thing possible, but it was
a cause of great embarrassment to the courtiers, who had got into such
a habit of laughing at little noses that they sometimes found themselves
laughing at hers before they had time to think; but this did not do at
all before the Prince, who quite failed to see the joke, and actually
banished two of his courtiers who had dared to mention disrespectfully
the Dear Little Princess’s tiny nose!

The others, taking warning from this, learned to think twice before they
spoke, and one even went so far as to tell the Prince that, though it
was quite true that no man could be worth anything unless he had a
long nose, still, a woman’s beauty was a different thing; and he knew
a learned man who understood Greek and had read in some old manuscripts
that the beautiful Cleopatra herself had a “tip-tilted” nose!

The Prince made him a splendid present as a reward for this good
news, and at once sent ambassadors to ask the Dear Little Princess in
marriage. The King, her father, gave his consent; and Prince Hyacinth,
who, in his anxiety to see the Princess, had gone three leagues to meet
her was just advancing to kiss her hand when, to the horror of all who
stood by, the enchanter appeared as suddenly as a flash of lightning,
and, snatching up the Dear Little Princess, whirled her away out of
their sight!

The Prince was left quite unconsolable, and declared that nothing should
induce him to go back to his kingdom until he had found her again, and
refusing to allow any of his courtiers to follow him, he mounted his
horse and rode sadly away, letting the animal choose his own path.

So it happened that he came presently to a great plain, across which
he rode all day long without seeing a single house, and horse and rider
were terribly hungry, when, as the night fell, the Prince caught sight
of a light, which seemed to shine from a cavern.

He rode up to it, and saw a little old woman, who appeared to be at
least a hundred years old.

She put on her spectacles to look at Prince Hyacinth, but it was quite
a long time before she could fix them securely because her nose was so
very short.

The Prince and the Fairy (for that was who she was) had no sooner looked
at one another than they went into fits of laughter, and cried at the
same moment, “Oh, what a funny nose!”

“Not so funny as your own,” said Prince Hyacinth to the Fairy; “but,
madam, I beg you to leave the consideration of our noses--such as
they are--and to be good enough to give me something to eat, for I am
starving, and so is my poor horse.”

“With all my heart,” said the Fairy. “Though your nose is so ridiculous
you are, nevertheless, the son of my best friend. I loved your father as
if he had been my brother. Now _he_ had a very handsome nose!”

“And pray what does mine lack?” said the Prince.

“Oh! it doesn’t _lack_ anything,” replied the Fairy. “On the contrary
quite, there is only too much of it. But never mind, one may be a very
worthy man though his nose is too long. I was telling you that I was
your father’s friend; he often came to see me in the old times, and you
must know that I was very pretty in those days; at least, he used to say
so. I should like to tell you of a conversation we had the last time I
ever saw him.”

“Indeed,” said the Prince, “when I have supped it will give me the
greatest pleasure to hear it; but consider, madam, I beg of you, that I
have had nothing to eat to-day.”

“The poor boy is right,” said the Fairy; “I was forgetting. Come in,
then, and I will give you some supper, and while you are eating I can
tell you my story in a very few words--for I don’t like endless tales
myself. Too long a tongue is worse than too long a nose, and I remember
when I was young that I was so much admired for not being a great
chatterer. They used to tell the Queen, my mother, that it was so. For
though you see what I am now, I was the daughter of a great king. My
father----”

“Your father, I dare say, got something to eat when he was hungry!”
 interrupted the Prince.

“Oh! certainly,” answered the Fairy, “and you also shall have supper
directly. I only just wanted to tell you----”

“But I really cannot listen to anything until I have had something
to eat,” cried the Prince, who was getting quite angry; but then,
remembering that he had better be polite as he much needed the Fairy’s
help, he added:

“I know that in the pleasure of listening to you I should quite forget
my own hunger; but my horse, who cannot hear you, must really be fed!”

The Fairy was very much flattered by this compliment, and said, calling
to her servants:

“You shall not wait another minute, you are so polite, and in spite of
the enormous size of your nose you are really very agreeable.”

“Plague take the old lady! How she does go on about my nose!” said the
Prince to himself. “One would almost think that mine had taken all the
extra length that hers lacks! If I were not so hungry I would soon have
done with this chatterpie who thinks she talks very little! How stupid
people are not to see their own faults! That comes of being a princess:
she has been spoiled by flatterers, who have made her believe that she
is quite a moderate talker!”

Meanwhile the servants were putting the supper on the table, and the
prince was much amused to hear the Fairy who asked them a thousand
questions simply for the pleasure of hearing herself speak; especially
he noticed one maid who, no matter what was being said, always contrived
to praise her mistress’s wisdom.

“Well!” he thought, as he ate his supper, “I’m very glad I came here.
This just shows me how sensible I have been in never listening to
flatterers. People of that sort praise us to our faces without shame,
and hide our faults or change them into virtues. For my part I never
will be taken in by them. I know my own defects, I hope.”

Poor Prince Hyacinth! He really believed what he said, and hadn’t an
idea that the people who had praised his nose were laughing at him, just
as the Fairy’s maid was laughing at her; for the Prince had seen her
laugh slyly when she could do so without the Fairy’s noticing her.

However, he said nothing, and presently, when his hunger began to be
appeased, the Fairy said:

“My dear Prince, might I beg you to move a little more that way, for
your nose casts such a shadow that I really cannot see what I have on my
plate. Ah! thanks. Now let us speak of your father. When I went to his
Court he was only a little boy, but that is forty years ago, and I have
been in this desolate place ever since. Tell me what goes on nowadays;
are the ladies as fond of amusement as ever? In my time one saw them at
parties, theatres, balls, and promenades every day. Dear me! _what_ a
long nose you have! I cannot get used to it!”

“Really, madam,” said the Prince, “I wish you would leave off mentioning
my nose. It cannot matter to you what it is like. I am quite satisfied
with it, and have no wish to have it shorter. One must take what is
given one.”

“Now you are angry with me, my poor Hyacinth,” said the Fairy, “and I
assure you that I didn’t mean to vex you; on the contrary, I wished to
do you a service. However, though I really cannot help your nose being a
shock to me, I will try not to say anything about it. I will even try to
think that you have an ordinary nose. To tell the truth, it would make
three reasonable ones.”

The Prince, who was no longer hungry, grew so impatient at the Fairy’s
continual remarks about his nose that at last he threw himself upon his
horse and rode hastily away. But wherever he came in his journeyings he
thought the people were mad, for they all talked of his nose, and yet
he could not bring himself to admit that it was too long, he had been so
used all his life to hear it called handsome.

The old Fairy, who wished to make him happy, at last hit upon a plan.
She shut the Dear Little Princess up in a palace of crystal, and put
this palace down where the Prince would not fail to find it. His joy at
seeing the Princess again was extreme, and he set to work with all his
might to try to break her prison; but in spite of all his efforts he
failed utterly. In despair he thought at least that he would try to
get near enough to speak to the Dear Little Princess, who, on her part,
stretched out her hand that he might kiss it; but turn which way he
might, he never could raise it to his lips, for his long nose always
prevented it. For the first time he realized how long it really was, and
exclaimed:

“Well, it must be admitted that my nose _is_ too long!”

In an instant the crystal prison flew into a thousand splinters, and
the old Fairy, taking the Dear Little Princess by the hand, said to the
Prince:

“Now, say if you are not very much obliged to me. Much good it was for
me to talk to you about your nose! You would never have found out how
extraordinary it was if it hadn’t hindered you from doing what you
wanted to. You see how self-love keeps us from knowing our own defects
of mind and body. Our reason tries in vain to show them to us; we refuse
to see them till we find them in the way of our interests.”

Prince Hyacinth, whose nose was now just like anyone’s else, did not
fail to profit by the lesson he had received. He married the Dear Little
Princess, and they lived happily ever after.


Once upon a time there was a poor husbandman who had many children and
little to give them in the way either of food or clothing. They were all
pretty, but the prettiest of all was the youngest daughter, who was so
beautiful that there were no bounds to her beauty.

So once--it was late on a Thursday evening in autumn, and wild weather
outside, terribly dark, and raining so heavily and blowing so hard that
the walls of the cottage shook again--they were all sitting together by
the fireside, each of them busy with something or other, when suddenly
some one rapped three times against the window-pane. The man went out
to see what could be the matter, and when he got out there stood a great
big white bear.

“Good-evening to you,” said the White Bear.

“Good-evening,” said the man.

“Will you give me your youngest daughter?” said the White Bear; “if you
will, you shall be as rich as you are now poor.”

Truly the man would have had no objection to be rich, but he thought to
himself: “I must first ask my daughter about this,” so he went in and
told them that there was a great white bear outside who had faithfully
promised to make them all rich if he might but have the youngest
daughter.

She said no, and would not hear of it; so the man went out again, and
settled with the White Bear that he should come again next Thursday
evening, and get her answer. Then the man persuaded her, and talked so
much to her about the wealth that they would have, and what a good thing
it would be for herself, that at last she made up her mind to go, and
washed and mended all her rags, made herself as smart as she could, and
held herself in readiness to set out. Little enough had she to take away
with her.

Next Thursday evening the White Bear came to fetch her. She seated
herself on his back with her bundle, and thus they departed. When they
had gone a great part of the way, the White Bear said: “Are you afraid?”

“No, that I am not,” said she.

“Keep tight hold of my fur, and then there is no danger,” said he.

And thus she rode far, far away, until they came to a great mountain.
Then the White Bear knocked on it, and a door opened, and they went into
a castle where there were many brilliantly lighted rooms which shone
with gold and silver, likewise a large hall in which there was a
well-spread table, and it was so magnificent that it would be hard to
make anyone understand how splendid it was. The White Bear gave her a
silver bell, and told her that when she needed anything she had but
to ring this bell, and what she wanted would appear. So after she had
eaten, and night was drawing near, she grew sleepy after her journey,
and thought she would like to go to bed. She rang the bell, and scarcely
had she touched it before she found herself in a chamber where a bed
stood ready made for her, which was as pretty as anyone could wish to
sleep in. It had pillows of silk, and curtains of silk fringed with
gold, and everything that was in the room was of gold or silver, but
when she had lain down and put out the light a man came and lay down
beside her, and behold it was the White Bear, who cast off the form of
a beast during the night. She never saw him, however, for he always came
after she had put out her light, and went away before daylight appeared.

So all went well and happily for a time, but then she began to be very
sad and sorrowful, for all day long she had to go about alone; and
she did so wish to go home to her father and mother and brothers and
sisters. Then the White Bear asked what it was that she wanted, and she
told him that it was so dull there in the mountain, and that she had to
go about all alone, and that in her parents’ house at home there were
all her brothers and sisters, and it was because she could not go to
them that she was so sorrowful.

“There might be a cure for that,” said the White Bear, “if you would
but promise me never to talk with your mother alone, but only when the
others are there too; for she will take hold of your hand,” he said,
“and will want to lead you into a room to talk with you alone; but that
you must by no means do, or you will bring great misery on both of us.”

So one Sunday the White Bear came and said that they could now set out
to see her father and mother, and they journeyed thither, she sitting on
his back, and they went a long, long way, and it took a long, long time;
but at last they came to a large white farmhouse, and her brothers and
sisters were running about outside it, playing, and it was so pretty
that it was a pleasure to look at it.

“Your parents dwell here now,” said the White Bear; “but do not forget
what I said to you, or you will do much harm both to yourself and me.”

“No, indeed,” said she, “I shall never forget;” and as soon as she was
at home the White Bear turned round and went back again.

There were such rejoicings when she went in to her parents that it
seemed as if they would never come to an end. Everyone thought that he
could never be sufficiently grateful to her for all she had done for
them all. Now they had everything that they wanted, and everything was
as good as it could be. They all asked her how she was getting on where
she was. All was well with her too, she said; and she had everything
that she could want. What other answers she gave I cannot say, but I am
pretty sure that they did not learn much from her. But in the afternoon,
after they had dined at midday, all happened just as the White Bear had
said. Her mother wanted to talk with her alone in her own chamber. But
she remembered what the White Bear had said, and would on no account go.
“What we have to say can be said at any time,” she answered. But somehow
or other her mother at last persuaded her, and she was forced to tell
the whole story. So she told how every night a man came and lay down
beside her when the lights were all put out, and how she never saw him,
because he always went away before it grew light in the morning, and how
she continually went about in sadness, thinking how happy she would
be if she could but see him, and how all day long she had to go about
alone, and it was so dull and solitary. “Oh!” cried the mother, in
horror, “you are very likely sleeping with a troll! But I will teach you
a way to see him. You shall have a bit of one of my candles, which you
can take away with you hidden in your breast. Look at him with that when
he is asleep, but take care not to let any tallow drop upon him.”

So she took the candle, and hid it in her breast, and when evening drew
near the White Bear came to fetch her away. When they had gone some
distance on their way, the White Bear asked her if everything had not
happened just as he had foretold, and she could not but own that it had.
“Then, if you have done what your mother wished,” said he, “you have
brought great misery on both of us.” “No,” she said, “I have not done
anything at all.” So when she had reached home and had gone to bed it
was just the same as it had been before, and a man came and lay down
beside her, and late at night, when she could hear that he was sleeping,
she got up and kindled a light, lit her candle, let her light shine on
him, and saw him, and he was the handsomest prince that eyes had ever
beheld, and she loved him so much that it seemed to her that she must
die if she did not kiss him that very moment. So she did kiss him; but
while she was doing it she let three drops of hot tallow fall upon
his shirt, and he awoke. “What have you done now?” said he; “you have
brought misery on both of us. If you had but held out for the space of
one year I should have been free. I have a step-mother who has bewitched
me so that I am a white bear by day and a man by night; but now all is
at an end between you and me, and I must leave you, and go to her. She
lives in a castle which lies east of the sun and west of the moon, and
there too is a princess with a nose which is three ells long, and she
now is the one whom I must marry.”

She wept and lamented, but all in vain, for go he must. Then she asked
him if she could not go with him. But no, that could not be. “Can you
tell me the way then, and I will seek you--that I may surely be allowed
to do!”

“Yes, you may do that,” said he; “but there is no way thither. It lies
east of the sun and west of the moon, and never would you find your way
there.”

When she awoke in the morning both the Prince and the castle were gone,
and she was lying on a small green patch in the midst of a dark, thick
wood. By her side lay the self-same bundle of rags which she had brought
with her from her own home. So when she had rubbed the sleep out of her
eyes, and wept till she was weary, she set out on her way, and thus she
walked for many and many a long day, until at last she came to a great
mountain. Outside it an aged woman was sitting, playing with a golden
apple. The girl asked her if she knew the way to the Prince who lived
with his stepmother in the castle which lay east of the sun and west of
the moon, and who was to marry a princess with a nose which was three
ells long. “How do you happen to know about him?” inquired the old
woman; “maybe you are she who ought to have had him.” “Yes, indeed, I
am,” she said. “So it is you, then?” said the old woman; “I know nothing
about him but that he dwells in a castle which is east of the sun and
west of the moon. You will be a long time in getting to it, if ever you
get to it at all; but you shall have the loan of my horse, and then you
can ride on it to an old woman who is a neighbor of mine: perhaps she
can tell you about him. When you have got there you must just strike the
horse beneath the left ear and bid it go home again; but you may take
the golden apple with you.”

So the girl seated herself on the horse, and rode for a long, long way,
and at last she came to the mountain, where an aged woman was sitting
outside with a gold carding-comb. The girl asked her if she knew the way
to the castle which lay east of the sun and west of the moon; but she
said what the first old woman had said: “I know nothing about it, but
that it is east of the sun and west of the moon, and that you will be a
long time in getting to it, if ever you get there at all; but you shall
have the loan of my horse to an old woman who lives the nearest to me:
perhaps she may know where the castle is, and when you have got to her
you may just strike the horse beneath the left ear and bid it go home
again.” Then she gave her the gold carding-comb, for it might, perhaps,
be of use to her, she said.

So the girl seated herself on the horse, and rode a wearisome long way
onward again, and after a very long time she came to a great mountain,
where an aged woman was sitting, spinning at a golden spinning-wheel.
Of this woman, too, she inquired if she knew the way to the Prince, and
where to find the castle which lay east of the sun and west of the moon.
But it was only the same thing once again. “Maybe it was you who should
have had the Prince,” said the old woman. “Yes, indeed, I should have
been the one,” said the girl. But this old crone knew the way no better
than the others--it was east of the sun and west of the moon, she knew
that, “and you will be a long time in getting to it, if ever you get
to it at all,” she said; “but you may have the loan of my horse, and I
think you had better ride to the East Wind, and ask him: perhaps he may
know where the castle is, and will blow you thither. But when you have
got to him you must just strike the horse beneath the left ear, and he
will come home again.” And then she gave her the golden spinning-wheel,
saying: “Perhaps you may find that you have a use for it.”

The girl had to ride for a great many days, and for a long and wearisome
time, before she got there; but at last she did arrive, and then she
asked the East Wind if he could tell her the way to the Prince who dwelt
east of the sun and west of the moon. “Well,” said the East Wind, “I
have heard tell of the Prince, and of his castle, but I do not know the
way to it, for I have never blown so far; but, if you like, I will go
with you to my brother the West Wind: he may know that, for he is much
stronger than I am. You may sit on my back, and then I can carry you
there.” So she seated herself on his back, and they did go so swiftly!
When they got there, the East Wind went in and said that the girl whom
he had brought was the one who ought to have had the Prince up at the
castle which lay east of the sun and west of the moon, and that now she
was traveling about to find him again, so he had come there with her,
and would like to hear if the West Wind knew whereabout the castle was.
“No,” said the West Wind; “so far as that have I never blown; but if you
like I will go with you to the South Wind, for he is much stronger than
either of us, and he has roamed far and wide, and perhaps he can tell
you what you want to know. You may seat yourself on my back, and then I
will carry you to him.”.

So she did this, and journeyed to the South Wind, neither was she very
long on the way. When they had got there, the West Wind asked him if he
could tell her the way to the castle that lay east of the sun and west
of the moon, for she was the girl who ought to marry the Prince who
lived there. “Oh, indeed!” said the South Wind, “is that she? Well,”
 said he, “I have wandered about a great deal in my time, and in all
kinds of places, but I have never blown so far as that. If you like,
however, I will go with you to my brother, the North Wind; he is the
oldest and strongest of all of us, and if he does not know where it is
no one in the whole world will be able to tell you. You may sit upon
my back, and then I will carry you there.” So she seated herself on his
back, and off he went from his house in great haste, and they were not
long on the way. When they came near the North Wind’s dwelling, he was
so wild and frantic that they felt cold gusts a long while before they
got there. “What do you want?” he roared out from afar, and they froze
as they heard. Said the South Wind: “It is I, and this is she who should
have had the Prince who lives in the castle which lies east of the sun
and west of the moon. And now she wishes to ask you if you have ever
been there, and can tell her the way, for she would gladly find him
again.”

“Yes,” said the North Wind, “I know where it is. I once blew an aspen
leaf there, but I was so tired that for many days afterward I was not
able to blow at all. However, if you really are anxious to go there, and
are not afraid to go with me, I will take you on my back, and try if I
can blow you there.”

“Get there I must,” said she; “and if there is any way of going I will;
and I have no fear, no matter how fast you go.”

“Very well then,” said the North Wind; “but you must sleep here
to-night, for if we are ever to get there we must have the day before
us.”

The North Wind woke her betimes next morning, and puffed himself up, and
made himself so big and so strong that it was frightful to see him, and
away they went, high up through the air, as if they would not stop until
they had reached the very end of the world. Down below there was such a
storm! It blew down woods and houses, and when they were above the sea
the ships were wrecked by hundreds. And thus they tore on and on, and
a long time went by, and then yet more time passed, and still they were
above the sea, and the North Wind grew tired, and more tired, and at
last so utterly weary that he was scarcely able to blow any longer, and
he sank and sank, lower and lower, until at last he went so low that the
waves dashed against the heels of the poor girl he was carrying. “Art
thou afraid?” said the North Wind. “I have no fear,” said she; and it
was true. But they were not very, very far from land, and there was just
enough strength left in the North Wind to enable him to throw her on to
the shore, immediately under the windows of a castle which lay east of
the sun and west of the moon; but then he was so weary and worn out that
he was forced to rest for several days before he could go to his own
home again.

Next morning she sat down beneath the walls of the castle to play with
the golden apple, and the first person she saw was the maiden with the
long nose, who was to have the Prince. “How much do you want for that
gold apple of yours, girl?” said she, opening the window. “It can’t be
bought either for gold or money,” answered the girl. “If it cannot be
bought either for gold or money, what will buy it? You may say what you
please,” said the Princess.

“Well, if I may go to the Prince who is here, and be with him to-night,
you shall have it,” said the girl who had come with the North Wind. “You
may do that,” said the Princess, for she had made up her mind what she
would do. So the Princess got the golden apple, but when the girl went
up to the Prince’s apartment that night he was asleep, for the Princess
had so contrived it. The poor girl called to him, and shook him, and
between whiles she wept; but she could not wake him. In the morning, as
soon as day dawned, in came the Princess with the long nose, and drove
her out again. In the daytime she sat down once more beneath the windows
of the castle, and began to card with her golden carding-comb; and then
all happened as it had happened before. The Princess asked her what she
wanted for it, and she replied that it was not for sale, either for gold
or money, but that if she could get leave to go to the Prince, and be
with him during the night, she should have it. But when she went up to
the Prince’s room he was again asleep, and, let her call him, or shake
him, or weep as she would, he still slept on, and she could not put any
life in him. When daylight came in the morning, the Princess with the
long nose came too, and once more drove her away. When day had quite
come, the girl seated herself under the castle windows, to spin with
her golden spinning-wheel, and the Princess with the long nose wanted to
have that also. So she opened the window, and asked what she would
take for it. The girl said what she had said on each of the former
occasions--that it was not for sale either for gold or for money, but if
she could get leave to go to the Prince who lived there, and be with him
during the night, she should have it.

“Yes,” said the Princess, “I will gladly consent to that.”

But in that place there were some Christian folk who had been carried
off, and they had been sitting in the chamber which was next to that of
the Prince, and had heard how a woman had been in there who had wept and
called on him two nights running, and they told the Prince of this. So
that evening, when the Princess came once more with her sleeping-drink,
he pretended to drink, but threw it away behind him, for he suspected
that it was a sleeping-drink. So, when the girl went into the Prince’s
room this time he was awake, and she had to tell him how she had come
there. “You have come just in time,” said the Prince, “for I should have
been married to-morrow; but I will not have the long-nosed Princess, and
you alone can save me. I will say that I want to see what my bride can
do, and bid her wash the shirt which has the three drops of tallow on
it. This she will consent to do, for she does not know that it is you
who let them fall on it; but no one can wash them out but one born of
Christian folk: it cannot be done by one of a pack of trolls; and then
I will say that no one shall ever be my bride but the woman who can do
this, and I know that you can.” There was great joy and gladness between
them all that night, but the next day, when the wedding was to take
place, the Prince said, “I must see what my bride can do.” “That you may
do,” said the stepmother.

“I have a fine shirt which I want to wear as my wedding shirt, but three
drops of tallow have got upon it which I want to have washed off, and
I have vowed to marry no one but the woman who is able to do it. If she
cannot do that, she is not worth having.”

Well, that was a very small matter, they thought, and agreed to do it.
The Princess with the long nose began to wash as well as she could,
but, the more she washed and rubbed, the larger the spots grew. “Ah! you
can’t wash at all,” said the old troll-hag, who was her mother. “Give it
to me.” But she too had not had the shirt very long in her hands before
it looked worse still, and, the more she washed it and rubbed it, the
larger and blacker grew the spots.

So the other trolls had to come and wash, but, the more they did, the
blacker and uglier grew the shirt, until at length it was as black as if
it had been up the chimney. “Oh,” cried the Prince, “not one of you is
good for anything at all! There is a beggar-girl sitting outside the
window, and I’ll be bound that she can wash better than any of you! Come
in, you girl there!” he cried. So she came in. “Can you wash this shirt
clean?” he cried. “Oh! I don’t know,” she said; “but I will try.” And
no sooner had she taken the shirt and dipped it in the water than it
was white as driven snow, and even whiter than that. “I will marry you,”
 said the Prince.

Then the old troll-hag flew into such a rage that she burst, and the
Princess with the long nose and all the little trolls must have burst
too, for they have never been heard of since. The Prince and his bride
set free all the Christian folk who were imprisoned there, and took away
with them all the gold and silver that they could carry, and moved far
away from the castle which lay east of the sun and west of the moon.(1)

Once upon a time there lived a queen who had been the mother of a great
many children, and of them all only one daughter was left. But then
_she_ was worth at least a thousand.

Her mother, who, since the death of the King, her father, had nothing in
the world she cared for so much as this little Princess, was so terribly
afraid of losing her that she quite spoiled her, and never tried to
correct any of her faults. The consequence was that this little person,
who was as pretty as possible, and was one day to wear a crown, grew
up so proud and so much in love with her own beauty that she despised
everyone else in the world.

The Queen, her mother, by her caresses and flatteries, helped to make
her believe that there was nothing too good for her. She was dressed
almost always in the prettiest frocks, as a fairy, or as a queen going
out to hunt, and the ladies of the Court followed her dressed as forest
fairies.

And to make her more vain than ever the Queen caused her portrait to be
taken by the cleverest painters and sent it to several neighboring kings
with whom she was very friendly.

When they saw this portrait they fell in love with the Princess--every
one of them, but upon each it had a different effect. One fell ill, one
went quite crazy, and a few of the luckiest set off to see her as soon
as possible, but these poor princes became her slaves the moment they
set eyes on her.

Never has there been a gayer Court. Twenty delightful kings did
everything they could think of to make themselves agreeable, and after
having spent ever so much money in giving a single entertainment thought
themselves very lucky if the Princess said “That’s pretty.”

All this admiration vastly pleased the Queen. Not a day passed but
she received seven or eight thousand sonnets, and as many elegies,
madrigals, and songs, which were sent her by all the poets in the
world. All the prose and the poetry that was written just then was about
Bellissima--for that was the Princess’s name--and all the bonfires that
they had were made of these verses, which crackled and sparkled better
than any other sort of wood.

Bellissima was already fifteen years old, and every one of the Princes
wished to marry her, but not one dared to say so. How could they when
they knew that any of them might have cut off his head five or six times
a day just to please her, and she would have thought it a mere trifle,
so little did she care? You may imagine how hard-hearted her lovers
thought her; and the Queen, who wished to see her married, did not know
how to persuade her to think of it seriously.

“Bellissima,” she said, “I do wish you would not be so proud. What makes
you despise all these nice kings? I wish you to marry one of them, and
you do not try to please me.”

“I am so happy,” Bellissima answered: “do leave me in peace, madam. I
don’t want to care for anyone.”

“But you would be very happy with any of these Princes,” said the Queen,
“and I shall be very angry if you fall in love with anyone who is not
worthy of you.”

But the Princess thought so much of herself that she did not consider
any one of her lovers clever or handsome enough for her; and her mother,
who was getting really angry at her determination not to be married,
began to wish that she had not allowed her to have her own way so much.

At last, not knowing what else to do, she resolved to consult a certain
witch who was called “The Fairy of the Desert.” Now this was very
difficult to do, as she was guarded by some terrible lions; but happily
the Queen had heard a long time before that whoever wanted to pass
these lions safely must throw to them a cake made of millet flour,
sugar-candy, and crocodile’s eggs. This cake she prepared with her own
hands, and putting it in a little basket, she set out to seek the Fairy.
But as she was not used to walking far, she soon felt very tired and sat
down at the foot of a tree to rest, and presently fell fast asleep. When
she awoke she was dismayed to find her basket empty. The cake was all
gone! and, to make matters worse, at that moment she heard the roaring
of the great lions, who had found out that she was near and were coming
to look for her.

“What shall I do?” she cried; “I shall be eaten up,” and being too
frightened to run a single step, she began to cry, and leaned against
the tree under which she had been asleep.

Just then she heard some one say: “H’m, h’m!”

She looked all round her, and then up the tree, and there she saw a
little tiny man, who was eating oranges.

“Oh! Queen,” said he, “I know you very well, and I know how much afraid
you are of the lions; and you are quite right too, for they have eaten
many other people: and what can you expect, as you have not any cake to
give them?”

“I must make up my mind to die,” said the poor Queen. “Alas! I should
not care so much if only my dear daughter were married.”

“Oh! you have a daughter,” cried the Yellow Dwarf (who was so called
because he _was_ a dwarf and had such a yellow face, and lived in the
orange tree). “I’m really glad to hear that, for I’ve been looking for
a wife all over the world. Now, if you will promise that she shall marry
me, not one of the lions, tigers, or bears shall touch you.”

The Queen looked at him and was almost as much afraid of his ugly little
face as she had been of the lions before, so that she could not speak a
word.

“What! you hesitate, madam,” cried the Dwarf. “You must be very fond of
being eaten up alive.”

And, as he spoke, the Queen saw the lions, which were running down a
hill toward them.

Each one had two heads, eight feet, and four rows of teeth, and their
skins were as hard as turtle shells, and were bright red.

At this dreadful sight, the poor Queen, who was trembling like a dove
when it sees a hawk, cried out as loud as she could, “Oh! dear Mr.
Dwarf, Bellissima shall marry you.”

“Oh, indeed!” said he disdainfully. “Bellissima is pretty enough, but I
don’t particularly want to marry her--you can keep her.”

“Oh! noble sir,” said the Queen in great distress, “do not refuse her.
She is the most charming Princess in the world.”

“Oh! well,” he replied, “out of charity I will take her; but be sure and
don’t forget that she is mine.”

As he spoke a little door opened in the trunk of the orange tree, in
rushed the Queen, only just in time, and the door shut with a bang in
the faces of the lions.

The Queen was so confused that at first she did not notice another
little door in the orange tree, but presently it opened and she found
herself in a field of thistles and nettles. It was encircled by a muddy
ditch, and a little further on was a tiny thatched cottage, out of which
came the Yellow Dwarf with a very jaunty air. He wore wooden shoes and
a little yellow coat, and as he had no hair and very long ears he looked
altogether a shocking little object.

“I am delighted,” said he to the Queen, “that, as you are to be my
mother-in-law, you should see the little house in which your Bellissima
will live with me. With these thistles and nettles she can feed a donkey
which she can ride whenever she likes; under this humble roof no
weather can hurt her; she will drink the water of this brook and eat
frogs--which grow very fat about here; and then she will have me always
with her, handsome, agreeable, and gay as you see me now. For if her
shadow stays by her more closely than I do I shall be surprised.”

The unhappy Queen, seeing all at once what a miserable life her daughter
would have with this Dwarf could not bear the idea, and fell down
insensible without saying a word.

When she revived she found to her great surprise that she was lying in
her own bed at home, and, what was more, that she had on the loveliest
lace night cap that she had ever seen in her life. At first she thought
that all her adventures, the terrible lions, and her promise to the
Yellow Dwarf that he should marry Bellissima, must have been a dream,
but there was the new cap with its beautiful ribbon and lace to remind
her that it was all true, which made her so unhappy that she could
neither eat, drink, nor sleep for thinking of it.

The Princess, who, in spite of her wilfulness, really loved her mother
with all her heart, was much grieved when she saw her looking so sad,
and often asked her what was the matter; but the Queen, who didn’t want
her to find out the truth, only said that she was ill, or that one of
her neighbors was threatening to make war against her. Bellissima knew
quite well that something was being hidden from her--and that neither of
these was the real reason of the Queen’s uneasiness. So she made up her
mind that she would go and consult the Fairy of the Desert about it,
especially as she had often heard how wise she was, and she thought that
at the same time she might ask her advice as to whether it would be as
well to be married, or not.

So, with great care, she made some of the proper cake to pacify the
lions, and one night went up to her room very early, pretending that
she was going to bed; but instead of that, she wrapped herself in a long
white veil, and went down a secret staircase, and set off all by herself
to find the Witch.

But when she got as far as the same fatal orange tree, and saw it
covered with flowers and fruit, she stopped and began to gather some
of the oranges--and then, putting down her basket, she sat down to eat
them. But when it was time to go on again the basket had disappeared
and, though she looked everywhere, not a trace of it could she find.
The more she hunted for it, the more frightened she got, and at last she
began to cry. Then all at once she saw before her the Yellow Dwarf.

“What’s the matter with you, my pretty one?” said he. “What are you
crying about?”

“Alas!” she answered; “no wonder that I am crying, seeing that I have
lost the basket of cake that was to help me to get safely to the cave of
the Fairy of the Desert.”

“And what do you want with her, pretty one?” said the little monster,
“for I am a friend of hers, and, for the matter of that, I am quite as
clever as she is.”

“The Queen, my mother,” replied the Princess, “has lately fallen into
such deep sadness that I fear that she will die; and I am afraid that
perhaps I am the cause of it, for she very much wishes me to be married,
and I must tell you truly that as yet I have not found anyone I consider
worthy to be my husband. So for all these reasons I wished to talk to
the Fairy.”

“Do not give yourself any further trouble, Princess,” answered the
Dwarf. “I can tell you all you want to know better than she could. The
Queen, your mother, has promised you in marriage----”

“Has promised _me!_” interrupted the Princess. “Oh! no. I’m sure she has
not. She would have told me if she had. I am too much interested in
the matter for her to promise anything without my consent--you must be
mistaken.”

“Beautiful Princess,” cried the Dwarf suddenly, throwing himself on his
knees before her, “I flatter myself that you will not be displeased
at her choice when I tell you that it is to _me_ she has promised the
happiness of marrying you.”

“You!” cried Bellissima, starting back. “My mother wishes me to marry
you! How can you be so silly as to think of such a thing?”

“Oh! it isn’t that I care much to have that honor,” cried the Dwarf
angrily; “but here are the lions coming; they’ll eat you up in three
mouthfuls, and there will be an end of you and your pride.”

And, indeed, at that moment the poor Princess heard their dreadful howls
coming nearer and nearer.

“What shall I do?” she cried. “Must all my happy days come to an end
like this?”

The malicious Dwarf looked at her and began to laugh spitefully. “At
least,” said he, “you have the satisfaction of dying unmarried. A lovely
Princess like you must surely prefer to die rather than be the wife of a
poor little dwarf like myself.”

“Oh, don’t be angry with me,” cried the Princess, clasping her hands.
“I’d rather marry all the dwarfs in the world than die in this horrible
way.”

“Look at me well, Princess, before you give me your word,” said he. “I
don’t want you to promise me in a hurry.”

“Oh!” cried she, “the lions are coming. I have looked at you enough. I
am so frightened. Save me this minute, or I shall die of terror.”

Indeed, as she spoke she fell down insensible, and when she recovered
she found herself in her own little bed at home; how she got there
she could not tell, but she was dressed in the most beautiful lace and
ribbons, and on her finger was a little ring, made of a single red hair,
which fitted so tightly that, try as she might, she could not get it
off.

When the Princess saw all these things, and remembered what had
happened, she, too, fell into the deepest sadness, which surprised and
alarmed the whole Court, and the Queen more than anyone else. A hundred
times she asked Bellissima if anything was the matter with her; but she
always said that there was nothing.

At last the chief men of the kingdom, anxious to see their Princess
married, sent to the Queen to beg her to choose a husband for her as
soon as possible. She replied that nothing would please her better, but
that her daughter seemed so unwilling to marry, and she recommended them
to go and talk to the Princess about it themselves so this they at once
did. Now Bellissima was much less proud since her adventure with the
Yellow Dwarf, and she could not think of a better way of getting rid
of the little monster than to marry some powerful king, therefore she
replied to their request much more favorably than they had hoped, saying
that, though she was very happy as she was, still, to please them, she
would consent to marry the King of the Gold Mines. Now he was a very
handsome and powerful Prince, who had been in love with the Princess for
years, but had not thought that she would ever care about him at all.
You can easily imagine how delighted he was when he heard the news,
and how angry it made all the other kings to lose for ever the hope of
marrying the Princess; but, after all, Bellissima could not have married
twenty kings--indeed, she had found it quite difficult enough to choose
one, for her vanity made her believe that there was nobody in the world
who was worthy of her.

Preparations were begun at once for the grandest wedding that had ever
been held at the palace. The King of the Gold Mines sent such immense
sums of money that the whole sea was covered with the ships that brought
it. Messengers were sent to all the gayest and most refined Courts,
particularly to the Court of France, to seek out everything rare and
precious to adorn the Princess, although her beauty was so perfect that
nothing she wore could make her look prettier. At least that is what
the King of the Gold Mines thought, and he was never happy unless he was
with her.

As for the Princess, the more she saw of the King the more she liked
him; he was so generous, so handsome and clever, that at last she was
almost as much in love with him as he was with her. How happy they were
as they wandered about in the beautiful gardens together, sometimes
listening to sweet music! And the King used to write songs for
Bellissima. This is one that she liked very much:

  In the forest all is gay
  When my Princess walks that way.
  All the blossoms then are found
  Downward fluttering to the ground,
  Hoping she may tread on them.
  And bright flowers on slender stem
  Gaze up at her as she passes
  Brushing lightly through the grasses.
  Oh! my Princess, birds above
  Echo back our songs of love,
  As through this enchanted land
  Blithe we wander, hand in hand.


They really were as happy as the day was long. All the King’s
unsuccessful rivals had gone home in despair. They said good-by to the
Princess so sadly that she could not help being sorry for them.

“Ah! madam,” the King of the Gold Mines said to her “how is this? Why
do you waste your pity on these princes, who love you so much that all
their trouble would be well repaid by a single smile from you?”

“I should be sorry,” answered Bellissima, “if you had not noticed how
much I pitied these princes who were leaving me for ever; but for you,
sire, it is very different: you have every reason to be pleased with
me, but they are going sorrowfully away, so you must not grudge them my
compassion.”

The King of the Gold Mines was quite overcome by the Princess’s
good-natured way of taking his interference, and, throwing himself at
her feet, he kissed her hand a thousand times and begged her to forgive
him.

At last the happy day came. Everything was ready for Bellissima’s
wedding. The trumpets sounded, all the streets of the town were hung
with flags and strewn with flowers, and the people ran in crowds to the
great square before the palace. The Queen was so overjoyed that she had
hardly been able to sleep at all, and she got up before it was light to
give the necessary orders and to choose the jewels that the Princess was
to wear. These were nothing less than diamonds, even to her shoes, which
were covered with them, and her dress of silver brocade was embroidered
with a dozen of the sun’s rays. You may imagine how much these had cost;
but then nothing could have been more brilliant, except the beauty of
the Princess! Upon her head she wore a splendid crown, her lovely
hair waved nearly to her feet, and her stately figure could easily be
distinguished among all the ladies who attended her.

The King of the Gold Mines was not less noble and splendid; it was easy
to see by his face how happy he was, and everyone who went near him
returned loaded with presents, for all round the great banqueting hall
had been arranged a thousand barrels full of gold, and numberless bags
made of velvet embroidered with pearls and filled with money, each one
containing at least a hundred thousand gold pieces, which were given
away to everyone who liked to hold out his hand, which numbers of people
hastened to do, you may be sure--indeed, some found this by far the most
amusing part of the wedding festivities.

The Queen and the Princess were just ready to set out with the King when
they saw, advancing toward them from the end of the long gallery, two
great basilisks, dragging after them a very badly made box; behind them
came a tall old woman, whose ugliness was even more surprising than her
extreme old age. She wore a ruff of black taffeta, a red velvet hood,
and a farthingale all in rags, and she leaned heavily upon a crutch.
This strange old woman, without saying a single word, hobbled three
times round the gallery, followed by the basilisks, then stopping in the
middle, and brandishing her crutch threateningly, she cried:

“Ho, ho, Queen! Ho, ho, Princess! Do you think you are going to break
with impunity the promise that you made to my friend the Yellow Dwarf? I
am the Fairy of the Desert; without the Yellow Dwarf and his orange
tree my great lions would soon have eaten you up, I can tell you, and in
Fairyland we do not suffer ourselves to be insulted like this. Make up
your minds at once what you will do, for I vow that you shall marry the
Yellow Dwarf. If you don’t, may I burn my crutch!”

“Ah! Princess,” said the Queen, weeping, “what is this that I hear? What
have you promised?”

“Ah! my mother,” replied Bellissima sadly, “what did _you_ promise,
yourself?”

The King of the Gold Mines, indignant at being kept from his happiness
by this wicked old woman, went up to her, and threatening her with his
sword, said:

“Get away out of my country at once, and for ever, miserable creature,
lest I take your life, and so rid myself of your malice.”

He had hardly spoken these words when the lid of the box fell back on
the floor with a terrible noise, and to their horror out sprang the
Yellow Dwarf, mounted upon a great Spanish cat. “Rash youth!” he cried,
rushing between the Fairy of the Desert and the King. “Dare to lay a
finger upon this illustrious Fairy! Your quarrel is with me only. I
am your enemy and your rival. That faithless Princess who would have
married you is promised to me. See if she has not upon her finger a ring
made of one of my hairs. Just try to take it off, and you will soon find
out that I am more powerful than you are!”

“Wretched little monster!” said the King; “do you dare to call yourself
the Princess’s lover, and to lay claim to such a treasure? Do you know
that you are a dwarf--that you are so ugly that one cannot bear to look
at you--and that I should have killed you myself long before this if you
had been worthy of such a glorious death?”

The Yellow Dwarf, deeply enraged at these words, set spurs to his
cat, which yelled horribly, and leaped hither and thither--terrifying
everybody except the brave King, who pursued the Dwarf closely, till he,
drawing a great knife with which he was armed, challenged the King to
meet him in single combat, and rushed down into the courtyard of the
palace with a terrible clatter. The King, quite provoked, followed him
hastily, but they had hardly taken their places facing one another, and
the whole Court had only just had time to rush out upon the balconies to
watch what was going on, when suddenly the sun became as red as blood,
and it was so dark that they could scarcely see at all. The thunder
crashed, and the lightning seemed as if it must burn up everything; the
two basilisks appeared, one on each side of the bad Dwarf, like giants,
mountains high, and fire flew from their mouths and ears, until they
looked like flaming furnaces. None of these things could terrify the
noble young King, and the boldness of his looks and actions reassured
those who were looking on, and perhaps even embarrassed the Yellow Dwarf
himself; but even _his_ courage gave way when he saw what was happening
to his beloved Princess. For the Fairy of the Desert, looking more
terrible than before, mounted upon a winged griffin, and with long
snakes coiled round her neck, had given her such a blow with the lance
she carried that Bellissima fell into the Queen’s arms bleeding and
senseless. Her fond mother, feeling as much hurt by the blow as the
Princess herself, uttered such piercing cries and lamentations that
the King, hearing them, entirely lost his courage and presence of mind.
Giving up the combat, he flew toward the Princess, to rescue or to die
with her; but the Yellow Dwarf was too quick for him. Leaping with his
Spanish cat upon the balcony, he snatched Bellissima from the Queen’s
arms, and before any of the ladies of the Court could stop him he had
sprung upon the roof of the palace and disappeared with his prize.

The King, motionless with horror, looked on despairingly at this
dreadful occurrence, which he was quite powerless to prevent, and to
make matters worse his sight failed him, everything became dark, and he
felt himself carried along through the air by a strong hand.

This new misfortune was the work of the wicked Fairy of the Desert, who
had come with the Yellow Dwarf to help him carry off the Princess,
and had fallen in love with the handsome young King of the Gold Mines
directly she saw him. She thought that if she carried him off to some
frightful cavern and chained him to a rock, then the fear of death would
make him forget Bellissima and become her slave. So, as soon as they
reached the place, she gave him back his sight, but without releasing
him from his chains, and by her magic power she appeared before him as
a young and beautiful fairy, and pretended to have come there quite by
chance.

“What do I see?” she cried. “Is it _you_, dear Prince? What misfortune
has brought you to this dismal place?”

The King, who was quite deceived by her altered appearance, replied:

“Alas! beautiful Fairy, the fairy who brought me here first took away
my sight, but by her voice I recognized her as the Fairy of the Desert,
though what she should have carried me off for I cannot tell you.”

“Ah!” cried the pretended Fairy, “if you have fallen into _her_ hands,
you won’t get away until you have married her. She has carried off more
than one Prince like this, and she will certainly have anything she
takes a fancy to.” While she was thus pretending to be sorry for the
King, he suddenly noticed her feet, which were like those of a griffin,
and knew in a moment that this must be the Fairy of the Desert, for her
feet were the one thing she could not change, however pretty she might
make her face.

Without seeming to have noticed anything, he said, in a confidential
way:

“Not that I have any dislike to the Fairy of the Desert, but I really
cannot endure the way in which she protects the Yellow Dwarf and keeps
me chained here like a criminal. It is true that I love a charming
princess, but if the Fairy should set me free my gratitude would oblige
me to love her only.”

“Do you really mean what you say, Prince?” said the Fairy, quite
deceived.

“Surely,” replied the Prince; “how could I deceive you? You see it is
so much more flattering to my vanity to be loved by a fairy than by
a simple princess. But, even if I am dying of love for her, I shall
pretend to hate her until I am set free.”

The Fairy of the Desert, quite taken in by these words, resolved at once
to transport the Prince to a pleasanter place. So, making him mount
her chariot, to which she had harnessed swans instead of the bats which
generally drew it, away she flew with him. But imagine the distress
of the Prince when, from the giddy height at which they were rushing
through the air, he saw his beloved Princess in a castle built of
polished steel, the walls of which reflected the sun’s rays so
hotly that no one could approach it without being burnt to a cinder!
Bellissima was sitting in a little thicket by a brook, leaning her head
upon her hand and weeping bitterly, but just as they passed she looked
up and saw the King and the Fairy of the Desert. Now, the Fairy was so
clever that she could not only seem beautiful to the King, but even the
poor Princess thought her the most lovely being she had ever seen.

“What!” she cried; “was I not unhappy enough in this lonely castle to
which that frightful Yellow Dwarf brought me? Must I also be made to
know that the King of the Gold Mines ceased to love me as soon as he
lost sight of me? But who can my rival be, whose fatal beauty is greater
than mine?”

While she was saying this, the King, who really loved her as much as
ever, was feeling terribly sad at being so rapidly torn away from his
beloved Princess, but he knew too well how powerful the Fairy was to
have any hope of escaping from her except by great patience and cunning.

The Fairy of the Desert had also seen Bellissima, and she tried to read
in the King’s eyes the effect that this unexpected sight had had upon
him.

“No one can tell you what you wish to know better than I can,” said
he. “This chance meeting with an unhappy princess for whom I once had a
passing fancy, before I was lucky enough to meet you, has affected me a
little, I admit, but you are so much more to me than she is that I would
rather die than leave you.”

“Ah, Prince,” she said, “can I believe that you really love me so much?”

“Time will show, madam,” replied the King; “but if you wish to convince
me that you have some regard for me, do not, I beg of you, refuse to aid
Bellissima.”

“Do you know what you are asking?” said the Fairy of the Desert,
frowning, and looking at him suspiciously. “Do you want me to employ my
art against the Yellow Dwarf, who is my best friend, and take away from
him a proud princess whom I can but look upon as my rival?”

The King sighed, but made no answer--indeed, what was there to be said
to such a clear-sighted person? At last they reached a vast meadow, gay
with all sorts of flowers; a deep river surrounded it, and many little
brooks murmured softly under the shady trees, where it was always cool
and fresh. A little way off stood a splendid palace, the walls of
which were of transparent emeralds. As soon as the swans which drew
the Fairy’s chariot had alighted under a porch, which was paved with
diamonds and had arches of rubies, they were greeted on all sides by
thousands of beautiful beings, who came to meet them joyfully, singing
these words:

  “When Love within a heart would reign,
       Useless to strive against him ‘tis.
  The proud but feel a sharper pain,
       And make a greater triumph his.”


The Fairy of the Desert was delighted to hear them sing of her triumphs;
she led the King into the most splendid room that can be imagined, and
left him alone for a little while, just that he might not feel that
he was a prisoner; but he felt sure that she had not really gone quite
away, but was watching him from some hiding-place. So walking up to a
great mirror, he said to it, “Trusty counsellor, let me see what I can
do to make myself agreeable to the charming Fairy of the Desert; for I
can think of nothing but how to please her.”

And he at once set to work to curl his hair, and, seeing upon a table a
grander coat than his own, he put it on carefully. The Fairy came back
so delighted that she could not conceal her joy.

“I am quite aware of the trouble you have taken to please me,” said she,
“and I must tell you that you have succeeded perfectly already. You see
it is not difficult to do if you really care for me.”

The King, who had his own reasons for wishing to keep the old Fairy in
a good humor, did not spare pretty speeches, and after a time he was
allowed to walk by himself upon the sea-shore. The Fairy of the Desert
had by her enchantments raised such a terrible storm that the boldest
pilot would not venture out in it, so she was not afraid of her
prisoner’s being able to escape; and he found it some relief to think
sadly over his terrible situation without being interrupted by his cruel
captor.

Presently, after walking wildly up and down, he wrote these verses upon
the sand with his stick:

     “At last may I upon this shore
       Lighten my sorrow with soft tears.
     Alas! alas! I see no more
       My Love, who yet my sadness cheers.

     “And thou, O raging, stormy Sea,
       Stirred by wild winds, from depth to height,
     Thou hold’st my loved one far from me,
       And I am captive to thy might.

     “My heart is still more wild than thine,
       For Fate is cruel unto me.
     Why must I thus in exile pine?
       Why is my Princess snatched from me?

     “O! lovely Nymphs, from ocean caves,
       Who know how sweet true love may be,
     Come up and calm the furious waves
       And set a desperate lover free!”


While he was still writing he heard a voice which attracted his
attention in spite of himself. Seeing that the waves were rolling in
higher than ever, he looked all round, and presently saw a lovely lady
floating gently toward him upon the crest of a huge billow, her long
hair spread all about her; in one hand she held a mirror, and in the
other a comb, and instead of feet she had a beautiful tail like a fish,
with which she swam.

The King was struck dumb with astonishment at this unexpected sight; but
as soon as she came within speaking distance, she said to him, “I know
how sad you are at losing your Princess and being kept a prisoner by
the Fairy of the Desert; if you like I will help you to escape from this
fatal place, where you may otherwise have to drag on a weary existence
for thirty years or more.”

The King of the Gold Mines hardly knew what answer to make to this
proposal. Not because he did not wish very much to escape, but he was
afraid that this might be only another device by which the Fairy of
the Desert was trying to deceive him. As he hesitated the Mermaid, who
guessed his thoughts, said to him:

“You may trust me: I am not trying to entrap you. I am so angry with the
Yellow Dwarf and the Fairy of the Desert that I am not likely to wish to
help them, especially since I constantly see your poor Princess, whose
beauty and goodness make me pity her so much; and I tell you that if you
will have confidence in me I will help you to escape.”

“I trust you absolutely,” cried the King, “and I will do whatever you
tell me; but if you have seen my Princess I beg of you to tell me how
she is and what is happening to her.

“We must not waste time in talking,” said she. “Come with me and I will
carry you to the Castle of Steel, and we will leave upon this shore a
figure so like you that even the Fairy herself will be deceived by it.”

So saying, she quickly collected a bundle of sea-weed, and, blowing it
three times, she said:

“My friendly sea-weeds, I order you to stay here stretched upon the sand
until the Fairy of the Desert comes to take you away.” And at once
the sea-weeds became like the King, who stood looking at them in great
astonishment, for they were even dressed in a coat like his, but they
lay there pale and still as the King himself might have lain if one
of the great waves had overtaken him and thrown him senseless upon
the shore. And then the Mermaid caught up the King, and away they swam
joyfully together.

“Now,” said she, “I have time to tell you about the Princess. In spite
of the blow which the Fairy of the Desert gave her, the Yellow Dwarf
compelled her to mount behind him upon his terrible Spanish cat; but she
soon fainted away with pain and terror, and did not recover till they
were within the walls of his frightful Castle of Steel. Here she was
received by the prettiest girls it was possible to find, who had been
carried there by the Yellow Dwarf, who hastened to wait upon her and
showed her every possible attention. She was laid upon a couch covered
with cloth of gold, embroidered with pearls as big as nuts.”

“Ah!” interrupted the King of the Gold Mines, “if Bellissima forgets me,
and consents to marry him, I shall break my heart.”

“You need not be afraid of that,” answered the Mermaid, “the Princess
thinks of no one but you, and the frightful Dwarf cannot persuade her to
look at him.”

“Pray go on with your story,” said the King.

“What more is there to tell you?” replied the Mermaid. “Bellissima was
sitting in the wood when you passed, and saw you with the Fairy of the
Desert, who was so cleverly disguised that the Princess took her to be
prettier than herself; you may imagine her despair, for she thought that
you had fallen in love with her.”

“She believes that I love her!” cried the King. “What a fatal mistake!
What is to be done to undeceive her?”

“You know best,” answered the Mermaid, smiling kindly at him. “When
people are as much in love with one another as you two are, they don’t
need advice from anyone else.”

As she spoke they reached the Castle of Steel, the side next the sea
being the only one which the Yellow Dwarf had left unprotected by the
dreadful burning walls.

“I know quite well,” said the Mermaid, “that the Princess is sitting by
the brook-side, just where you saw her as you passed, but as you will
have many enemies to fight with before you can reach her, take this
sword; armed with it you may dare any danger, and overcome the greatest
difficulties, only beware of one thing--that is, never to let it fall
from your hand. Farewell; now I will wait by that rock, and if you need
my help in carrying off your beloved Princess I will not fail you, for
the Queen, her mother, is my best friend, and it was for her sake that I
went to rescue you.”

So saying, she gave to the King a sword made from a single diamond,
which was more brilliant than the sun. He could not find words to
express his gratitude, but he begged her to believe that he fully
appreciated the importance of her gift, and would never forget her help
and kindness.

We must now go back to the Fairy of the Desert. When she found that the
King did not return, she hastened out to look for him, and reached the
shore, with a hundred of the ladies of her train, loaded with splendid
presents for him. Some carried baskets full of diamonds, others golden
cups of wonderful workmanship, and amber, coral, and pearls, others,
again, balanced upon their heads bales of the richest and most beautiful
stuffs, while the rest brought fruit and flowers, and even birds. But
what was the horror of the Fairy, who followed this gay troop, when she
saw, stretched upon the sands, the image of the King which the Mermaid
had made with the sea-weeds. Struck with astonishment and sorrow, she
uttered a terrible cry, and threw herself down beside the pretended
King, weeping, and howling, and calling upon her eleven sisters, who
were also fairies, and who came to her assistance. But they were all
taken in by the image of the King, for, clever as they were, the Mermaid
was still cleverer, and all they could do was to help the Fairy of the
Desert to make a wonderful monument over what they thought was the grave
of the King of the Gold Mines. But while they were collecting jasper
and porphyry, agate and marble, gold and bronze, statues and devices,
to immortalize the King’s memory, he was thanking the good Mermaid and
begging her still to help him, which she graciously promised to do as
she disappeared; and then he set out for the Castle of Steel. He walked
fast, looking anxiously round him, and longing once more to see his
darling Bellissima, but he had not gone far before he was surrounded by
four terrible sphinxes who would very soon have torn him to pieces with
their sharp talons if it had not been for the Mermaid’s diamond sword.
For, no sooner had he flashed it before their eyes than down they fell
at his feet quite helpless, and he killed them with one blow. But he
had hardly turned to continue his search when he met six dragons covered
with scales that were harder than iron. Frightful as this encounter was
the King’s courage was unshaken, and by the aid of his wonderful sword
he cut them in pieces one after the other. Now he hoped his difficulties
were over, but at the next turning he was met by one which he did
not know how to overcome. Four-and-twenty pretty and graceful nymphs
advanced toward him, holding garlands of flowers, with which they barred
the way.

“Where are you going, Prince?” they said; “it is our duty to guard this
place, and if we let you pass great misfortunes will happen to you
and to us. We beg you not to insist upon going on. Do you want to kill
four-and-twenty girls who have never displeased you in any way?”

The King did not know what to do or to say. It went against all his
ideas as a knight to do anything a lady begged him not to do; but, as he
hesitated, a voice in his ear said:

“Strike! strike! and do not spare, or your Princess is lost for ever!”

So, without reply to the nymphs, he rushed forward instantly, breaking
their garlands, and scattering them in all directions; and then went
on without further hindrance to the little wood where he had seen
Bellissima. She was seated by the brook looking pale and weary when he
reached her, and he would have thrown himself down at her feet, but she
drew herself away from him with as much indignation as if he had been
the Yellow Dwarf.

“Ah! Princess,” he cried, “do not be angry with me. Let me explain
everything. I am not faithless or to blame for what has happened. I am
a miserable wretch who has displeased you without being able to help
himself.”

“Ah!” cried Bellissima, “did I not see you flying through the air with
the loveliest being imaginable? Was that against your will?”

“Indeed it was, Princess,” he answered; “the wicked Fairy of the Desert,
not content with chaining me to a rock, carried me off in her chariot to
the other end of the earth, where I should even now be a captive but for
the unexpected help of a friendly mermaid, who brought me here to rescue
you, my Princess, from the unworthy hands that hold you. Do not refuse
the aid of your most faithful lover.” So saying, he threw himself at her
feet and held her by her robe. But, alas! in so doing he let fall the
magic sword, and the Yellow Dwarf, who was crouching behind a lettuce,
no sooner saw it than he sprang out and seized it, well knowing its
wonderful power.

The Princess gave a cry of terror on seeing the Dwarf, but this only
irritated the little monster; muttering a few magical words he summoned
two giants, who bound the King with great chains of iron.

“Now,” said the Dwarf, “I am master of my rival’s fate, but I will give
him his life and permission to depart unharmed if you, Princess, will
consent to marry me.”

“Let me die a thousand times rather,” cried the unhappy King.

“Alas!” cried the Princess, “must you die? Could anything be more
terrible?”

“That you should marry that little wretch would be far more terrible,”
 answered the King.

“At least,” continued she, “let us die together.”

“Let me have the satisfaction of dying for you, my Princess,” said he.

“Oh, no, no!” she cried, turning to the Dwarf; “rather than that I will
do as you wish.”

“Cruel Princess!” said the King, “would you make my life horrible to me
by marrying another before my eyes?”

“Not so,” replied the Yellow Dwarf; “you are a rival of whom I am too
much afraid; you shall not see our marriage.” So saying, in spite of
Bellissima’s tears and cries, he stabbed the King to the heart with the
diamond sword.

The poor Princess, seeing her lover lying dead at her feet, could no
longer live without him; she sank down by him and died of a broken
heart.

So ended these unfortunate lovers, whom not even the Mermaid could help,
because all the magic power had been lost with the diamond sword.

As to the wicked Dwarf, he preferred to see the Princess dead rather
than married to the King of the Gold Mines; and the Fairy of the Desert,
when she heard of the King’s adventures, pulled down the grand monument
which she had built, and was so angry at the trick that had been played
her that she hated him as much as she had loved him before.

The kind Mermaid, grieved at the sad fate of the lovers, caused them to
be changed into two tall palm trees, which stand always side by side,
whispering together of their faithful love and caressing one another
with their interlacing branches.(1)



Once upon a time there lived in a certain village a little country girl,
the prettiest creature was ever seen. Her mother was excessively fond
of her; and her grandmother doted on her still more. This good woman
had made for her a little red riding-hood; which became the girl so
extremely well that everybody called her Little Red Riding-Hood.

One day her mother, having made some custards, said to her:

“Go, my dear, and see how thy grandmamma does, for I hear she has been
very ill; carry her a custard, and this little pot of butter.”

Little Red Riding-Hood set out immediately to go to her grandmother, who
lived in another village.

As she was going through the wood, she met with Gaffer Wolf, who had
a very great mind to eat her up, but he dared not, because of some
faggot-makers hard by in the forest. He asked her whither she was going.
The poor child, who did not know that it was dangerous to stay and hear
a wolf talk, said to him:

“I am going to see my grandmamma and carry her a custard and a little
pot of butter from my mamma.”

“Does she live far off?” said the Wolf.

“Oh! ay,” answered Little Red Riding-Hood; “it is beyond that mill you
see there, at the first house in the village.”

“Well,” said the Wolf, “and I’ll go and see her too. I’ll go this way
and you go that, and we shall see who will be there soonest.”

The Wolf began to run as fast as he could, taking the nearest way,
and the little girl went by that farthest about, diverting herself in
gathering nuts, running after butterflies, and making nosegays of such
little flowers as she met with. The Wolf was not long before he got to
the old woman’s house. He knocked at the door--tap, tap.

“Who’s there?”

“Your grandchild, Little Red Riding-Hood,” replied the Wolf,
counterfeiting her voice; “who has brought you a custard and a little
pot of butter sent you by mamma.”

The good grandmother, who was in bed, because she was somewhat ill,
cried out:

“Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up.”

The Wolf pulled the bobbin, and the door opened, and then presently he
fell upon the good woman and ate her up in a moment, for it was above
three days that he had not touched a bit. He then shut the door and went
into the grandmother’s bed, expecting Little Red Riding-Hood, who came
some time afterward and knocked at the door--tap, tap.

“Who’s there?”

Little Red Riding-Hood, hearing the big voice of the Wolf, was at first
afraid; but believing her grandmother had got a cold and was hoarse,
answered:

“‘Tis your grandchild, Little Red Riding-Hood, who has brought you a
custard and a little pot of butter mamma sends you.”

The Wolf cried out to her, softening his voice as much as he could:

“Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up.”

Little Red Riding-Hood pulled the bobbin, and the door opened.

The Wolf, seeing her come in, said to her, hiding himself under the
bed-clothes:

“Put the custard and the little pot of butter upon the stool, and come
and lie down with me.”

Little Red Riding-Hood undressed herself and went into bed, where, being
greatly amazed to see how her grandmother looked in her night-clothes,
she said to her:

“Grandmamma, what great arms you have got!”

“That is the better to hug thee, my dear.”

“Grandmamma, what great legs you have got!”

“That is to run the better, my child.”

“Grandmamma, what great ears you have got!”

“That is to hear the better, my child.”

“Grandmamma, what great eyes you have got!”

“It is to see the better, my child.”

“Grandmamma, what great teeth you have got!”

“That is to eat thee up.”

And, saying these words, this wicked wolf fell upon Little Red
Riding-Hood, and ate her all up.


There were formerly a king and a queen, who were so sorry that they had
no children; so sorry that it cannot be expressed. They went to all the
waters in the world; vows, pilgrimages, all ways were tried, and all to
no purpose.

At last, however, the Queen had a daughter. There was a very fine
christening; and the Princess had for her god-mothers all the fairies
they could find in the whole kingdom (they found seven), that every one
of them might give her a gift, as was the custom of fairies in those
days. By this means the Princess had all the perfections imaginable.

After the ceremonies of the christening were over, all the company
returned to the King’s palace, where was prepared a great feast for the
fairies. There was placed before every one of them a magnificent cover
with a case of massive gold, wherein were a spoon, knife, and fork, all
of pure gold set with diamonds and rubies. But as they were all sitting
down at table they saw come into the hall a very old fairy, whom they
had not invited, because it was above fifty years since she had been out
of a certain tower, and she was believed to be either dead or enchanted.

The King ordered her a cover, but could not furnish her with a case
of gold as the others, because they had only seven made for the seven
fairies. The old Fairy fancied she was slighted, and muttered some
threats between her teeth. One of the young fairies who sat by her
overheard how she grumbled; and, judging that she might give the little
Princess some unlucky gift, went, as soon as they rose from table, and
hid herself behind the hangings, that she might speak last, and repair,
as much as she could, the evil which the old Fairy might intend.

In the meanwhile all the fairies began to give their gifts to the
Princess. The youngest gave her for gift that she should be the most
beautiful person in the world; the next, that she should have the wit
of an angel; the third, that she should have a wonderful grace in
everything she did; the fourth, that she should dance perfectly well;
the fifth, that she should sing like a nightingale; and the sixth, that
she should play all kinds of music to the utmost perfection.

The old Fairy’s turn coming next, with a head shaking more with spite
than age, she said that the Princess should have her hand pierced with a
spindle and die of the wound. This terrible gift made the whole company
tremble, and everybody fell a-crying.

At this very instant the young Fairy came out from behind the hangings,
and spake these words aloud:

“Assure yourselves, O King and Queen, that your daughter shall not die
of this disaster. It is true, I have no power to undo entirely what
my elder has done. The Princess shall indeed pierce her hand with a
spindle; but, instead of dying, she shall only fall into a profound
sleep, which shall last a hundred years, at the expiration of which a
king’s son shall come and awake her.”

The King, to avoid the misfortune foretold by the old Fairy, caused
immediately proclamation to be made, whereby everybody was forbidden, on
pain of death, to spin with a distaff and spindle, or to have so much as
any spindle in their houses. About fifteen or sixteen years after, the
King and Queen being gone to one of their houses of pleasure, the young
Princess happened one day to divert herself in running up and down the
palace; when going up from one apartment to another, she came into a
little room on the top of the tower, where a good old woman, alone, was
spinning with her spindle. This good woman had never heard of the King’s
proclamation against spindles.

“What are you doing there, goody?” said the Princess.

“I am spinning, my pretty child,” said the old woman, who did not know
who she was.

“Ha!” said the Princess, “this is very pretty; how do you do it? Give it
to me, that I may see if I can do so.”

She had no sooner taken it into her hand than, whether being very hasty
at it, somewhat unhandy, or that the decree of the Fairy had so ordained
it, it ran into her hand, and she fell down in a swoon.

The good old woman, not knowing very well what to do in this affair,
cried out for help. People came in from every quarter in great numbers;
they threw water upon the Princess’s face, unlaced her, struck her on
the palms of her hands, and rubbed her temples with Hungary-water; but
nothing would bring her to herself.

And now the King, who came up at the noise, bethought himself of
the prediction of the fairies, and, judging very well that this must
necessarily come to pass, since the fairies had said it, caused the
Princess to be carried into the finest apartment in his palace, and to
be laid upon a bed all embroidered with gold and silver.

One would have taken her for a little angel, she was so very beautiful;
for her swooning away had not diminished one bit of her complexion; her
cheeks were carnation, and her lips were coral; indeed, her eyes were
shut, but she was heard to breathe softly, which satisfied those about
her that she was not dead. The King commanded that they should not
disturb her, but let her sleep quietly till her hour of awaking was
come.

The good Fairy who had saved her life by condemning her to sleep a
hundred years was in the kingdom of Matakin, twelve thousand leagues
off, when this accident befell the Princess; but she was instantly
informed of it by a little dwarf, who had boots of seven leagues, that
is, boots with which he could tread over seven leagues of ground in one
stride. The Fairy came away immediately, and she arrived, about an hour
after, in a fiery chariot drawn by dragons.

The King handed her out of the chariot, and she approved everything
he had done, but as she had very great foresight, she thought when the
Princess should awake she might not know what to do with herself, being
all alone in this old palace; and this was what she did: she
touched with her wand everything in the palace (except the King
and Queen)--governesses, maids of honor, ladies of the bedchamber,
gentlemen, officers, stewards, cooks, undercooks, scullions, guards,
with their beefeaters, pages, footmen; she likewise touched all the
horses which were in the stables, pads as well as others, the great dogs
in the outward court and pretty little Mopsey too, the Princess’s little
spaniel, which lay by her on the bed.

Immediately upon her touching them they all fell asleep, that they might
not awake before their mistress and that they might be ready to wait
upon her when she wanted them. The very spits at the fire, as full as
they could hold of partridges and pheasants, did fall asleep also. All
this was done in a moment. Fairies are not long in doing their business.

And now the King and the Queen, having kissed their dear child without
waking her, went out of the palace and put forth a proclamation that
nobody should dare to come near it.

This, however, was not necessary, for in a quarter of an hour’s time
there grew up all round about the park such a vast number of trees,
great and small, bushes and brambles, twining one within another, that
neither man nor beast could pass through; so that nothing could be seen
but the very top of the towers of the palace; and that, too, not unless
it was a good way off. Nobody; doubted but the Fairy gave herein a very
extraordinary sample of her art, that the Princess, while she continued
sleeping, might have nothing to fear from any curious people.

When a hundred years were gone and passed the son of the King then
reigning, and who was of another family from that of the sleeping
Princess, being gone a-hunting on that side of the country, asked:

What those towers were which he saw in the middle of a great thick wood?

Everyone answered according as they had heard. Some said:

That it was a ruinous old castle, haunted by spirits.

Others, That all the sorcerers and witches of the country kept there
their sabbath or night’s meeting.

The common opinion was: That an ogre lived there, and that he carried
thither all the little children he could catch, that he might eat them
up at his leisure, without anybody being able to follow him, as having
himself only the power to pass through the wood.

The Prince was at a stand, not knowing what to believe, when a very good
countryman spake to him thus:

“May it please your royal highness, it is now about fifty years since I
heard from my father, who heard my grandfather say, that there was then
in this castle a princess, the most beautiful was ever seen; that she
must sleep there a hundred years, and should be waked by a king’s son,
for whom she was reserved.”

The young Prince was all on fire at these words, believing, without
weighing the matter, that he could put an end to this rare adventure;
and, pushed on by love and honor, resolved that moment to look into it.

Scarce had he advanced toward the wood when all the great trees, the
bushes, and brambles gave way of themselves to let him pass through; he
walked up to the castle which he saw at the end of a large avenue which
he went into; and what a little surprised him was that he saw none of
his people could follow him, because the trees closed again as soon as
he had passed through them. However, he did not cease from continuing
his way; a young and amorous prince is always valiant.

He came into a spacious outward court, where everything he saw might
have frozen the most fearless person with horror. There reigned all over
a most frightful silence; the image of death everywhere showed itself,
and there was nothing to be seen but stretched-out bodies of men and
animals, all seeming to be dead. He, however, very well knew, by the
ruby faces and pimpled noses of the beefeaters, that they were only
asleep; and their goblets, wherein still remained some drops of wine,
showed plainly that they fell asleep in their cups.

He then crossed a court paved with marble, went up the stairs and came
into the guard chamber, where guards were standing in their ranks, with
their muskets upon their shoulders, and snoring as loud as they could.
After that he went through several rooms full of gentlemen and ladies,
all asleep, some standing, others sitting. At last he came into a
chamber all gilded with gold, where he saw upon a bed, the curtains of
which were all open, the finest sight was ever beheld--a princess, who
appeared to be about fifteen or sixteen years of age, and whose bright
and, in a manner, resplendent beauty, had somewhat in it divine. He
approached with trembling and admiration, and fell down before her upon
his knees.

And now, as the enchantment was at an end, the Princess awaked, and
looking on him with eyes more tender than the first view might seem to
admit of:

“Is it you, my Prince?” said she to him. “You have waited a long while.”

The Prince, charmed with these words, and much more with the manner in
which they were spoken, knew not how to show his joy and gratitude;
he assured her that he loved her better than he did himself; their
discourse was not well connected, they did weep more than talk--little
eloquence, a great deal of love. He was more at a loss than she, and we
need not wonder at it; she had time to think on what to say to him; for
it is very probable (though history mentions nothing of it) that the
good Fairy, during so long a sleep, had given her very agreeable dreams.
In short, they talked four hours together, and yet they said not half
what they had to say.

In the meanwhile all the palace awaked; everyone thought upon their
particular business, and as all of them were not in love they were ready
to die for hunger. The chief lady of honor, being as sharp set as other
folks, grew very impatient, and told the Princess aloud that supper
was served up. The Prince helped the Princess to rise; she was entirely
dressed, and very magnificently, but his royal highness took care not
to tell her that she was dressed like his great-grandmother, and had
a point band peeping over a high collar; she looked not a bit less
charming and beautiful for all that.

They went into the great hall of looking-glasses, where they supped, and
were served by the Princess’s officers, the violins and hautboys played
old tunes, but very excellent, though it was now above a hundred years
since they had played; and after supper, without losing any time, the
lord almoner married them in the chapel of the castle, and the chief
lady of honor drew the curtains. They had but very little sleep--the
Princess had no occasion; and the Prince left her next morning to return
to the city, where his father must needs have been in pain for him. The
Prince told him:

That he lost his way in the forest as he was hunting, and that he had
lain in the cottage of a charcoal-burner, who gave him cheese and brown
bread.

The King, his father, who was a good man, believed him; but his mother
could not be persuaded it was true; and seeing that he went almost every
day a-hunting, and that he always had some excuse ready for so doing,
though he had lain out three or four nights together, she began to
suspect that he was married, for he lived with the Princess above two
whole years, and had by her two children, the eldest of which, who was
a daughter, was named Morning, and the youngest, who was a son, they
called Day, because he was a great deal handsomer and more beautiful
than his sister.

The Queen spoke several times to her son, to inform herself after
what manner he did pass his time, and that in this he ought in duty to
satisfy her. But he never dared to trust her with his secret; he feared
her, though he loved her, for she was of the race of the Ogres, and the
King would never have married her had it not been for her vast riches;
it was even whispered about the Court that she had Ogreish inclinations,
and that, whenever she saw little children passing by, she had all the
difficulty in the world to avoid falling upon them. And so the Prince
would never tell her one word.

But when the King was dead, which happened about two years afterward,
and he saw himself lord and master, he openly declared his marriage; and
he went in great ceremony to conduct his Queen to the palace. They made
a magnificent entry into the capital city, she riding between her two
children.

Soon after the King went to make war with the Emperor Contalabutte, his
neighbor. He left the government of the kingdom to the Queen his mother,
and earnestly recommended to her care his wife and children. He was
obliged to continue his expedition all the summer, and as soon as he
departed the Queen-mother sent her daughter-in-law to a country house
among the woods, that she might with the more ease gratify her horrible
longing.

Some few days afterward she went thither herself, and said to her clerk
of the kitchen:

“I have a mind to eat little Morning for my dinner to-morrow.”

“Ah! madam,” cried the clerk of the kitchen.

“I will have it so,” replied the Queen (and this she spoke in the tone
of an Ogress who had a strong desire to eat fresh meat), “and will eat
her with a sauce Robert.”

The poor man, knowing very well that he must not play tricks with
Ogresses, took his great knife and went up into little Morning’s
chamber. She was then four years old, and came up to him jumping and
laughing, to take him about the neck, and ask him for some sugar-candy.
Upon which he began to weep, the great knife fell out of his hand, and
he went into the back yard, and killed a little lamb, and dressed it
with such good sauce that his mistress assured him that she had never
eaten anything so good in her life. He had at the same time taken up
little Morning, and carried her to his wife, to conceal her in the
lodging he had at the bottom of the courtyard.

About eight days afterward the wicked Queen said to the clerk of the
kitchen, “I will sup on little Day.”

He answered not a word, being resolved to cheat her as he had done
before. He went to find out little Day, and saw him with a little foil
in his hand, with which he was fencing with a great monkey, the child
being then only three years of age. He took him up in his arms and
carried him to his wife, that she might conceal him in her chamber along
with his sister, and in the room of little Day cooked up a young kid,
very tender, which the Ogress found to be wonderfully good.

This was hitherto all mighty well; but one evening this wicked Queen
said to her clerk of the kitchen:

“I will eat the Queen with the same sauce I had with her children.”

It was now that the poor clerk of the kitchen despaired of being able
to deceive her. The young Queen was turned of twenty, not reckoning the
hundred years she had been asleep; and how to find in the yard a beast
so firm was what puzzled him. He took then a resolution, that he might
save his own life, to cut the Queen’s throat; and going up into her
chamber, with intent to do it at once, he put himself into as great
fury as he could possibly, and came into the young Queen’s room with his
dagger in his hand. He would not, however, surprise her, but told
her, with a great deal of respect, the orders he had received from the
Queen-mother.

“Do it; do it” (said she, stretching out her neck). “Execute your
orders, and then I shall go and see my children, my poor children, whom
I so much and so tenderly loved.”

For she thought them dead ever since they had been taken away without
her knowledge.

“No, no, madam” (cried the poor clerk of the kitchen, all in tears);
“you shall not die, and yet you shall see your children again; but then
you must go home with me to my lodgings, where I have concealed them,
and I shall deceive the Queen once more, by giving her in your stead a
young hind.”

Upon this he forthwith conducted her to his chamber, where, leaving her
to embrace her children, and cry along with them, he went and dressed a
young hind, which the Queen had for her supper, and devoured it with
the same appetite as if it had been the young Queen. Exceedingly was
she delighted with her cruelty, and she had invented a story to tell the
King, at his return, how the mad wolves had eaten up the Queen his wife
and her two children.

One evening, as she was, according to her custom, rambling round about
the courts and yards of the palace to see if she could smell any fresh
meat, she heard, in a ground room, little Day crying, for his mamma was
going to whip him, because he had been naughty; and she heard, at the
same time, little Morning begging pardon for her brother.

The Ogress presently knew the voice of the Queen and her children, and
being quite mad that she had been thus deceived, she commanded next
morning, by break of day (with a most horrible voice, which made
everybody tremble), that they should bring into the middle of the great
court a large tub, which she caused to be filled with toads, vipers,
snakes, and all sorts of serpents, in order to have thrown into it the
Queen and her children, the clerk of the kitchen, his wife and maid;
all whom she had given orders should be brought thither with their hands
tied behind them.

They were brought out accordingly, and the executioners were just going
to throw them into the tub, when the King (who was not so soon expected)
entered the court on horseback (for he came post) and asked, with the
utmost astonishment, what was the meaning of that horrible spectacle.

No one dared to tell him, when the Ogress, all enraged to see what had
happened, threw herself head foremost into the tub, and was instantly
devoured by the ugly creatures she had ordered to be thrown into it for
others. The King could not but be very sorry, for she was his mother;
but he soon comforted himself with his beautiful wife and his pretty
children.


Once there was a gentleman who married, for his second wife, the
proudest and most haughty woman that was ever seen. She had, by a former
husband, two daughters of her own humor, who were, indeed, exactly like
her in all things. He had likewise, by another wife, a young daughter,
but of unparalleled goodness and sweetness of temper, which she took
from her mother, who was the best creature in the world.

No sooner were the ceremonies of the wedding over but the mother-in-law
began to show herself in her true colors. She could not bear the good
qualities of this pretty girl, and the less because they made her own
daughters appear the more odious. She employed her in the meanest work
of the house: she scoured the dishes, tables, etc., and scrubbed madam’s
chamber, and those of misses, her daughters; she lay up in a sorry
garret, upon a wretched straw bed, while her sisters lay in fine rooms,
with floors all inlaid, upon beds of the very newest fashion, and where
they had looking-glasses so large that they might see themselves at
their full length from head to foot.

The poor girl bore all patiently, and dared not tell her father, who
would have rattled her off; for his wife governed him entirely. When she
had done her work, she used to go into the chimney-corner, and sit down
among cinders and ashes, which made her commonly be called Cinderwench;
but the youngest, who was not so rude and uncivil as the eldest, called
her Cinderella. However, Cinderella, notwithstanding her mean apparel,
was a hundred times handsomer than her sisters, though they were always
dressed very richly.

It happened that the King’s son gave a ball, and invited all persons of
fashion to it. Our young misses were also invited, for they cut a very
grand figure among the quality. They were mightily delighted at this
invitation, and wonderfully busy in choosing out such gowns, petticoats,
and head-clothes as might become them. This was a new trouble to
Cinderella; for it was she who ironed her sisters’ linen, and plaited
their ruffles; they talked all day long of nothing but how they should
be dressed.

“For my part,” said the eldest, “I will wear my red velvet suit with
French trimming.”

“And I,” said the youngest, “shall have my usual petticoat; but then,
to make amends for that, I will put on my gold-flowered manteau, and my
diamond stomacher, which is far from being the most ordinary one in the
world.”

They sent for the best tire-woman they could get to make up their
head-dresses and adjust their double pinners, and they had their red
brushes and patches from Mademoiselle de la Poche.

Cinderella was likewise called up to them to be consulted in all these
matters, for she had excellent notions, and advised them always for the
best, nay, and offered her services to dress their heads, which they
were very willing she should do. As she was doing this, they said to
her:

“Cinderella, would you not be glad to go to the ball?”

“Alas!” said she, “you only jeer me; it is not for such as I am to go
thither.”

“Thou art in the right of it,” replied they; “it would make the people
laugh to see a Cinderwench at a ball.”

Anyone but Cinderella would have dressed their heads awry, but she was
very good, and dressed them perfectly well They were almost two days
without eating, so much were they transported with joy. They broke above
a dozen laces in trying to be laced up close, that they might have a
fine slender shape, and they were continually at their looking-glass.
At last the happy day came; they went to Court, and Cinderella followed
them with her eyes as long as she could, and when she had lost sight of
them, she fell a-crying.

Her godmother, who saw her all in tears, asked her what was the matter.

“I wish I could--I wish I could--“; she was not able to speak the rest,
being interrupted by her tears and sobbing.

This godmother of hers, who was a fairy, said to her, “Thou wishest thou
couldst go to the ball; is it not so?”

“Y--es,” cried Cinderella, with a great sigh.

“Well,” said her godmother, “be but a good girl, and I will contrive
that thou shalt go.” Then she took her into her chamber, and said to
her, “Run into the garden, and bring me a pumpkin.”

Cinderella went immediately to gather the finest she could get, and
brought it to her godmother, not being able to imagine how this pumpkin
could make her go to the ball. Her godmother scooped out all the inside
of it, having left nothing but the rind; which done, she struck it with
her wand, and the pumpkin was instantly turned into a fine coach, gilded
all over with gold.

She then went to look into her mouse-trap, where she found six mice, all
alive, and ordered Cinderella to lift up a little the trapdoor, when,
giving each mouse, as it went out, a little tap with her wand, the mouse
was that moment turned into a fine horse, which altogether made a very
fine set of six horses of a beautiful mouse-colored dapple-gray. Being
at a loss for a coachman,

“I will go and see,” says Cinderella, “if there is never a rat in the
rat-trap--we may make a coachman of him.”

“Thou art in the right,” replied her godmother; “go and look.”

Cinderella brought the trap to her, and in it there were three huge
rats. The fairy made choice of one of the three which had the largest
beard, and, having touched him with her wand, he was turned into a fat,
jolly coachman, who had the smartest whiskers eyes ever beheld. After
that, she said to her:

“Go again into the garden, and you will find six lizards behind the
watering-pot, bring them to me.”

She had no sooner done so but her godmother turned them into six
footmen, who skipped up immediately behind the coach, with their
liveries all bedaubed with gold and silver, and clung as close behind
each other as if they had done nothing else their whole lives. The Fairy
then said to Cinderella:

“Well, you see here an equipage fit to go to the ball with; are you not
pleased with it?”

“Oh! yes,” cried she; “but must I go thither as I am, in these nasty
rags?”

Her godmother only just touched her with her wand, and, at the same
instant, her clothes were turned into cloth of gold and silver, all
beset with jewels. This done, she gave her a pair of glass slippers, the
prettiest in the whole world. Being thus decked out, she got up into her
coach; but her godmother, above all things, commanded her not to stay
till after midnight, telling her, at the same time, that if she stayed
one moment longer, the coach would be a pumpkin again, her horses mice,
her coachman a rat, her footmen lizards, and her clothes become just as
they were before.

She promised her godmother she would not fail of leaving the ball before
midnight; and then away she drives, scarce able to contain herself for
joy. The King’s son who was told that a great princess, whom nobody
knew, was come, ran out to receive her; he gave her his hand as she
alighted out of the coach, and led her into the ball, among all the
company. There was immediately a profound silence, they left off
dancing, and the violins ceased to play, so attentive was everyone to
contemplate the singular beauties of the unknown new-comer. Nothing was
then heard but a confused noise of:

“Ha! how handsome she is! Ha! how handsome she is!”

The King himself, old as he was, could not help watching her, and
telling the Queen softly that it was a long time since he had seen so
beautiful and lovely a creature.

All the ladies were busied in considering her clothes and headdress,
that they might have some made next day after the same pattern, provided
they could meet with such fine material and as able hands to make them.

The King’s son conducted her to the most honorable seat, and afterward
took her out to dance with him; she danced so very gracefully that they
all more and more admired her. A fine collation was served up, whereof
the young prince ate not a morsel, so intently was he busied in gazing
on her.

She went and sat down by her sisters, showing them a thousand
civilities, giving them part of the oranges and citrons which the Prince
had presented her with, which very much surprised them, for they did not
know her. While Cinderella was thus amusing her sisters, she heard the
clock strike eleven and three-quarters, whereupon she immediately made a
courtesy to the company and hasted away as fast as she could.

When she got home she ran to seek out her godmother, and, after having
thanked her, she said she could not but heartily wish she might go next
day to the ball, because the King’s son had desired her.

As she was eagerly telling her godmother whatever had passed at the
ball, her two sisters knocked at the door, which Cinderella ran and
opened.

“How long you have stayed!” cried she, gaping, rubbing her eyes and
stretching herself as if she had been just waked out of her sleep; she
had not, however, any manner of inclination to sleep since they went
from home.

“If thou hadst been at the ball,” said one of her sisters, “thou wouldst
not have been tired with it. There came thither the finest princess, the
most beautiful ever was seen with mortal eyes; she showed us a thousand
civilities, and gave us oranges and citrons.”

Cinderella seemed very indifferent in the matter; indeed, she asked them
the name of that princess; but they told her they did not know it, and
that the King’s son was very uneasy on her account and would give all
the world to know who she was. At this Cinderella, smiling, replied:

“She must, then, be very beautiful indeed; how happy you have been!
Could not I see her? Ah! dear Miss Charlotte, do lend me your yellow
suit of clothes which you wear every day.”

“Ay, to be sure!” cried Miss Charlotte; “lend my clothes to such a dirty
Cinderwench as thou art! I should be a fool.”

Cinderella, indeed, expected well such answer, and was very glad of the
refusal; for she would have been sadly put to it if her sister had lent
her what she asked for jestingly.

The next day the two sisters were at the ball, and so was Cinderella,
but dressed more magnificently than before. The King’s son was always by
her, and never ceased his compliments and kind speeches to her; to whom
all this was so far from being tiresome that she quite forgot what her
godmother had recommended to her; so that she, at last, counted the
clock striking twelve when she took it to be no more than eleven; she
then rose up and fled, as nimble as a deer. The Prince followed, but
could not overtake her. She left behind one of her glass slippers, which
the Prince took up most carefully. She got home but quite out of breath,
and in her nasty old clothes, having nothing left her of all her finery
but one of the little slippers, fellow to that she dropped. The guards
at the palace gate were asked:

If they had not seen a princess go out.

Who said: They had seen nobody go out but a young girl, very meanly
dressed, and who had more the air of a poor country wench than a
gentlewoman.

When the two sisters returned from the ball Cinderella asked them: If
they had been well diverted, and if the fine lady had been there.

They told her: Yes, but that she hurried away immediately when it struck
twelve, and with so much haste that she dropped one of her little glass
slippers, the prettiest in the world, which the King’s son had taken up;
that he had done nothing but look at her all the time at the ball, and
that most certainly he was very much in love with the beautiful person
who owned the glass slipper.

What they said was very true; for a few days after the King’s son caused
it to be proclaimed, by sound of trumpet, that he would marry her whose
foot the slipper would just fit. They whom he employed began to try it
upon the princesses, then the duchesses and all the Court, but in vain;
it was brought to the two sisters, who did all they possibly could
to thrust their foot into the slipper, but they could not effect it.
Cinderella, who saw all this, and knew her slipper, said to them,
laughing:

“Let me see if it will not fit me.”

Her sisters burst out a-laughing, and began to banter her. The gentleman
who was sent to try the slipper looked earnestly at Cinderella, and,
finding her very handsome, said:

It was but just that she should try, and that he had orders to let
everyone make trial.

He obliged Cinderella to sit down, and, putting the slipper to her foot,
he found it went on very easily, and fitted her as if it had been made
of wax. The astonishment her two sisters were in was excessively great,
but still abundantly greater when Cinderella pulled out of her pocket
the other slipper, and put it on her foot. Thereupon, in came her
godmother, who, having touched with her wand Cinderella’s clothes, made
them richer and more magnificent than any of those she had before.

And now her two sisters found her to be that fine, beautiful lady whom
they had seen at the ball. They threw themselves at her feet to beg
pardon for all the ill-treatment they had made her undergo. Cinderella
took them up, and, as she embraced them, cried:

That she forgave them with all her heart, and desired them always to
love her.

She was conducted to the young prince, dressed as she was; he thought
her more charming than ever, and, a few days after, married her.
Cinderella, who was no less good than beautiful, gave her two sisters
lodgings in the palace, and that very same day matched them with two
great lords of the Court.


There once lived a poor tailor, who had a son called Aladdin, a
careless, idle boy who would do nothing but play ball all day long in
the streets with little idle boys like himself. This so grieved the
father that he died; yet, in spite of his mother’s tears and prayers,
Aladdin did not mend his ways. One day, when he was playing in the
streets as usual, a stranger asked him his age, and if he was not the
son of Mustapha the tailor. “I am, sir,” replied Aladdin; “but he died
a long while ago.” On this the stranger, who was a famous African
magician, fell on his neck and kissed him, saying, “I am your uncle, and
knew you from your likeness to my brother. Go to your mother and tell
her I am coming.” Aladdin ran home and told his mother of his newly
found uncle. “Indeed, child,” she said, “your father had a brother, but
I always thought he was dead.” However, she prepared supper, and bade
Aladdin seek his uncle, who came laden with wine and fruit. He presently
fell down and kissed the place where Mustapha used to sit, bidding
Aladdin’s mother not to be surprised at not having seen him before, as
he had been forty years out of the country. He then turned to Aladdin,
and asked him his trade, at which the boy hung his head, while his
mother burst into tears. On learning that Aladdin was idle and would
learn no trade, he offered to take a shop for him and stock it with
merchandise. Next day he bought Aladdin a fine suit of clothes and took
him all over the city, showing him the sights, and brought him home at
nightfall to his mother, who was overjoyed to see her son so fine.

The next day the magician led Aladdin into some beautiful gardens a long
way outside the city gates. They sat down by a fountain and the magician
pulled a cake from his girdle, which he divided between them. They then
journeyed onward till they almost reached the mountains. Aladdin was
so tired that he begged to go back, but the magician beguiled him with
pleasant stories, and led him on in spite of himself. At last they came
to two mountains divided by a narrow valley. “We will go no farther,”
 said the false uncle. “I will show you something wonderful; only do you
gather up sticks while I kindle a fire.” When it was lit the magician
threw on it a powder he had about him, at the same time saying some
magical words. The earth trembled a little and opened in front of them,
disclosing a square flat stone with a brass ring in the middle to raise
it by. Aladdin tried to run away, but the magician caught him and gave
him a blow that knocked him down. “What have I done, uncle?” he said
piteously; whereupon the magician said more kindly: “Fear nothing, but
obey me. Beneath this stone lies a treasure which is to be yours, and
no one else may touch it, so you must do exactly as I tell you.” At the
word treasure Aladdin forgot his fears, and grasped the ring as he was
told, saying the names of his father and grandfather. The stone came up
quite easily, and some steps appeared. “Go down,” said the magician; “at
the foot of those steps you will find an open door leading into three
large halls. Tuck up your gown and go through them without touching
anything, or you will die instantly. These halls lead into a garden of
fine fruit trees. Walk on until you come to a niche in a terrace where
stands a lighted lamp. Pour out the oil it contains, and bring it to
me.” He drew a ring from his finger and gave it to Aladdin, bidding him
prosper.

Aladdin found everything as the magician had said, gathered some fruit
off the trees, and, having got the lamp, arrived at the mouth of the
cave. The magician cried out in a great hurry: “Make haste and give me
the lamp.” This Aladdin refused to do until he was out of the cave. The
magician flew into a terrible passion, and throwing some more powder
on to the fire, he said something, and the stone rolled back into its
place.

The magician left Persia for ever, which plainly showed that he was no
uncle of Aladdin’s, but a cunning magician, who had read in his magic
books of a wonderful lamp, which would make him the most powerful man in
the world. Though he alone knew where to find it, he could only receive
it from the hand of another. He had picked out the foolish Aladdin for
this purpose, intending to get the lamp and kill him afterward.

For two days Aladdin remained in the dark, crying and lamenting. At last
he clasped his hands in prayer, and in so doing rubbed the ring, which
the magician had forgotten to take from him. Immediately an enormous and
frightful genie rose out of the earth, saying: “What wouldst thou with
me? I am the Slave of the Ring, and will obey thee in all things.”
 Aladdin fearlessly replied: “Deliver me from this place!” whereupon the
earth opened, and he found himself outside. As soon as his eyes could
bear the light he went home, but fainted on the threshold. When he came
to himself he told his mother what had passed, and showed her the lamp
and the fruits he had gathered in the garden, which were, in reality,
precious stones. He then asked for some food. “Alas! child,” she said,
“I have nothing in the house, but I have spun a little cotton and will
go and sell it.” Aladdin bade her keep her cotton, for he would sell the
lamp instead. As it was very dirty she began to rub it, that it might
fetch a higher price. Instantly a hideous genie appeared, and asked what
she would have. She fainted away, but Aladdin, snatching the lamp, said
boldly: “Fetch me something to eat!” The genie returned with a silver
bowl, twelve silver plates containing rich meats, two silver cups, and
two bottles of wine. Aladdin’s mother, when she came to herself, said:
“Whence comes this splendid feast?” “Ask not, but eat,” replied Aladdin.
So they sat at breakfast till it was dinner-time, and Aladdin told his
mother about the lamp. She begged him to sell it, and have nothing to do
with devils. “No,” said Aladdin, “since chance hath made us aware of
its virtues, we will use it, and the ring likewise, which I shall always
wear on my finger.” When they had eaten all the genie had brought,
Aladdin sold one of the silver plates, and so on until none were left.
He then had recourse to the genie, who gave him another set of plates,
and thus they lived for many years.

One day Aladdin heard an order from the Sultan proclaimed that everyone
was to stay at home and close his shutters while the Princess, his
daughter, went to and from the bath. Aladdin was seized by a desire to
see her face, which was very difficult, as she always went veiled. He
hid himself behind the door of the bath, and peeped through a chink. The
Princess lifted her veil as she went in, and looked so beautiful that
Aladdin fell in love with her at first sight. He went home so changed
that his mother was frightened. He told her he loved the Princess so
deeply that he could not live without her, and meant to ask her in
marriage of her father. His mother, on hearing this, burst out laughing,
but Aladdin at last prevailed upon her to go before the Sultan and carry
his request. She fetched a napkin and laid in it the magic fruits from
the enchanted garden, which sparkled and shone like the most beautiful
jewels. She took these with her to please the Sultan, and set out,
trusting in the lamp. The Grand Vizier and the lords of council had
just gone in as she entered the hall and placed herself in front of the
Sultan. He, however, took no notice of her. She went every day for a
week, and stood in the same place. When the council broke up on the
sixth day the Sultan said to his Vizier: “I see a certain woman in the
audience-chamber every day carrying something in a napkin. Call her next
time, that I may find out what she wants.” Next day, at a sign from the
Vizier, she went up to the foot of the throne and remained kneeling till
the Sultan said to her: “Rise, good woman, and tell me what you want.”
 She hesitated, so the Sultan sent away all but the Vizier, and bade
her speak frankly, promising to forgive her beforehand for anything she
might say. She then told him of her son’s violent love for the Princess.
“I prayed him to forget her,” she said, “but in vain; he threatened to
do some desperate deed if I refused to go and ask your Majesty for the
hand of the Princess. Now I pray you to forgive not me alone, but my
son Aladdin.” The Sultan asked her kindly what she had in the
napkin, whereupon she unfolded the jewels and presented them. He was
thunderstruck, and turning to the Vizier said: “What sayest thou? Ought
I not to bestow the Princess on one who values her at such a price?” The
Vizier, who wanted her for his own son, begged the Sultan to withhold
her for three months, in the course of which he hoped his son would
contrive to make him a richer present. The Sultan granted this, and told
Aladdin’s mother that, though he consented to the marriage, she must not
appear before him again for three months.

Aladdin waited patiently for nearly three months, but after two had
elapsed his mother, going into the city to buy oil, found every one
rejoicing, and asked what was going on. “Do you not know,” was the
answer, “that the son of the Grand Vizier is to marry the Sultan’s
daughter to-night?” Breathless, she ran and told Aladdin, who was
overwhelmed at first, but presently bethought him of the lamp. He rubbed
it, and the genie appeared, saying, “What is thy will?” Aladdin replied:
“The Sultan, as thou knowest, has broken his promise to me, and the
Vizier’s son is to have the Princess. My command is that to-night you
bring hither the bride and bridegroom.” “Master, I obey,” said the
genie. Aladdin then went to his chamber, where, sure enough, at midnight
the genie transported the bed containing the Vizier’s son and the
Princess. “Take this new-married man,” he said, “and put him outside in
the cold, and return at daybreak.” Whereupon the genie took the Vizier’s
son out of bed, leaving Aladdin with the Princess. “Fear nothing,”
 Aladdin said to her; “you are my wife, promised to me by your unjust
father, and no harm shall come to you.” The Princess was too frightened
to speak, and passed the most miserable night of her life, while Aladdin
lay down beside her and slept soundly. At the appointed hour the
genie fetched in the shivering bridegroom, laid him in his place, and
transported the bed back to the palace.

Presently the Sultan came to wish his daughter good-morning. The unhappy
Vizier’s son jumped up and hid himself, while the Princess would not say
a word, and was very sorrowful. The Sultan sent her mother to her, who
said: “How comes it, child, that you will not speak to your father? What
has happened?” The Princess sighed deeply, and at last told her mother
how, during the night, the bed had been carried into some strange house,
and what had passed there. Her mother did not believe her in the least,
but bade her rise and consider it an idle dream.

The following night exactly the same thing happened, and next morning,
on the Princess’s refusal to speak, the Sultan threatened to cut off her
head. She then confessed all, bidding him to ask the Vizier’s son if it
were not so. The Sultan told the Vizier to ask his son, who owned the
truth, adding that, dearly as he loved the Princess, he had rather die
than go through another such fearful night, and wished to be separated
from her. His wish was granted, and there was an end to feasting and
rejoicing.

When the three months were over, Aladdin sent his mother to remind the
Sultan of his promise. She stood in the same place as before, and the
Sultan, who had forgotten Aladdin, at once remembered him, and sent for
her. On seeing her poverty the Sultan felt less inclined than ever to
keep his word, and asked his Vizier’s advice, who counselled him to set
so high a value on the Princess that no man living could come up to
it. The Sultan then turned to Aladdin’s mother, saying: “Good woman, a
Sultan must remember his promises, and I will remember mine, but your
son must first send me forty basins of gold brimful of jewels, carried
by forty black slaves, led by as many white ones, splendidly dressed.
Tell him that I await his answer.” The mother of Aladdin bowed low and
went home, thinking all was lost. She gave Aladdin the message, adding:
“He may wait long enough for your answer!” “Not so long, mother, as you
think,” her son replied. “I would do a great deal more than that for the
Princess.” He summoned the genie, and in a few moments the eighty slaves
arrived, and filled up the small house and garden. Aladdin made them
set out to the palace, two and two, followed by his mother. They were
so richly dressed, with such splendid jewels in their girdles, that
everyone crowded to see them and the basins of gold they carried on
their heads. They entered the palace, and, after kneeling before the
Sultan, stood in a half-circle round the throne with their arms crossed,
while Aladdin’s mother presented them to the Sultan. He hesitated no
longer, but said: “Good woman, return and tell your son that I wait for
him with open arms.” She lost no time in telling Aladdin, bidding him
make haste. But Aladdin first called the genie. “I want a scented bath,”
 he said, “a richly embroidered habit, a horse surpassing the Sultan’s,
and twenty slaves to attend me. Besides this, six slaves, beautifully
dressed, to wait on my mother; and lastly, ten thousand pieces of gold
in ten purses.” No sooner said than done. Aladdin mounted his horse and
passed through the streets, the slaves strewing gold as they went. Those
who had played with him in his childhood knew him not, he had grown so
handsome. When the Sultan saw him he came down from his throne, embraced
him, and led him into a hall where a feast was spread, intending to
marry him to the Princess that very day. But Aladdin refused, saying, “I
must build a palace fit for her,” and took his leave. Once home, he said
to the genie: “Build me a palace of the finest marble, set with jasper,
agate, and other precious stones. In the middle you shall build me a
large hall with a dome, its four walls of massy gold and silver, each
having six windows, whose lattices, all except one which is to be left
unfinished, must be set with diamonds and rubies. There must be stables
and horses and grooms and slaves; go and see about it!”

The palace was finished by the next day, and the genie carried him there
and showed him all his orders faithfully carried out, even to the laying
of a velvet carpet from Aladdin’s palace to the Sultan’s. Aladdin’s
mother then dressed herself carefully, and walked to the palace with her
slaves, while he followed her on horseback. The Sultan sent musicians
with trumpets and cymbals to meet them, so that the air resounded with
music and cheers. She was taken to the Princess, who saluted her and
treated her with great honor. At night the Princess said good-by to her
father, and set out on the carpet for Aladdin’s palace, with his mother
at her side, and followed by the hundred slaves. She was charmed at the
sight of Aladdin, who ran to receive her. “Princess,” he said, “blame
your beauty for my boldness if I have displeased you.” She told him
that, having seen him, she willingly obeyed her father in this matter.
After the wedding had taken place Aladdin led her into the hall, where a
feast was spread, and she supped with him, after which they danced till
midnight. Next day Aladdin invited the Sultan to see the palace. On
entering the hall with the four-and-twenty windows, with their rubies,
diamonds, and emeralds, he cried: “It is a world’s wonder! There is only
one thing that surprises me. Was it by accident that one window was
left unfinished?” “No, sir, by design,” returned Aladdin. “I wished
your Majesty to have the glory of finishing this palace.” The Sultan was
pleased, and sent for the best jewelers in the city. He showed them
the unfinished window, and bade them fit it up like the others. “Sir,”
 replied their spokesman, “we cannot find jewels enough.” The Sultan
had his own fetched, which they soon used, but to no purpose, for in
a month’s time the work was not half done. Aladdin, knowing that their
task was vain, bade them undo their work and carry the jewels back, and
the genie finished the window at his command. The Sultan was surprised
to receive his jewels again, and visited Aladdin, who showed him the
window finished. The Sultan embraced him, the envious Vizier meanwhile
hinting that it was the work of enchantment.

Aladdin had won the hearts of the people by his gentle bearing. He was
made captain of the Sultan’s armies, and won several battles for him,
but remained modest and courteous as before, and lived thus in peace and
content for several years.

But far away in Africa the magician remembered Aladdin, and by his magic
arts discovered that Aladdin, instead of perishing miserably in the
cave, had escaped, and had married a princess, with whom he was living
in great honor and wealth. He knew that the poor tailor’s son could only
have accomplished this by means of the lamp, and traveled night and day
until he reached the capital of China, bent on Aladdin’s ruin. As he
passed through the town he heard people talking everywhere about a
marvellous palace. “Forgive my ignorance,” he asked, “what is this
palace you speak Of?” “Have you not heard of Prince Aladdin’s palace,”
 was the reply, “the greatest wonder of the world? I will direct you
if you have a mind to see it.” The magician thanked him who spoke, and
having seen the palace, knew that it had been raised by the Genie of the
Lamp, and became half mad with rage. He determined to get hold of the
lamp, and again plunge Aladdin into the deepest poverty.

Unluckily, Aladdin had gone a-hunting for eight days, which gave the
magician plenty of time. He bought a dozen copper lamps, put them into a
basket, and went to the palace, crying: “New lamps for old!” followed
by a jeering crowd. The Princess, sitting in the hall of four-and-twenty
windows, sent a slave to find out what the noise was about, who came
back laughing, so that the Princess scolded her. “Madam,” replied the
slave, “who can help laughing to see an old fool offering to exchange
fine new lamps for old ones?” Another slave, hearing this, said: “There
is an old one on the cornice there which he can have.” Now this was the
magic lamp, which Aladdin had left there, as he could not take it out
hunting with him. The Princess, not knowing its value, laughingly
bade the slave take it and make the exchange. She went and said to the
magician: “Give me a new lamp for this.” He snatched it and bade the
slave take her choice, amid the jeers of the crowd. Little he cared, but
left off crying his lamps, and went out of the city gates to a lonely
place, where he remained till nightfall, when he pulled out the lamp
and rubbed it. The genie appeared, and at the magician’s command carried
him, together with the palace and the Princess in it, to a lonely place
in Africa.

Next morning the Sultan looked out of the window toward Aladdin’s palace
and rubbed his eyes, for it was gone. He sent for the Vizier and asked
what had become of the palace. The Vizier looked out too, and was lost
in astonishment. He again put it down to enchantment, and this time the
Sultan believed him, and sent thirty men on horseback to fetch Aladdin
in chains. They met him riding home, bound him, and forced him to go
with them on foot. The people, however, who loved him, followed, armed,
to see that he came to no harm. He was carried before the Sultan,
who ordered the executioner to cut off his head. The executioner made
Aladdin kneel down, bandaged his eyes, and raised his scimitar to
strike. At that instant the Vizier, who saw that the crowd had forced
their way into the courtyard and were scaling the walls to rescue
Aladdin, called to the executioner to stay his hand. The people, indeed,
looked so threatening that the Sultan gave way and ordered Aladdin to be
unbound, and pardoned him in the sight of the crowd. Aladdin now
begged to know what he had done. “False wretch!” said the Sultan, “come
thither,” and showed him from the window the place where his palace had
stood. Aladdin was so amazed that he could not say a word. “Where is my
palace and my daughter?” demanded the Sultan. “For the first I am not so
deeply concerned, but my daughter I must have, and you must find her
or lose your head.” Aladdin begged for forty days in which to find her,
promising, if he failed, to return and suffer death at the Sultan’s
pleasure. His prayer was granted, and he went forth sadly from the
Sultan’s presence. For three days he wandered about like a madman,
asking everyone what had become of his palace, but they only laughed and
pitied him. He came to the banks of a river, and knelt down to say his
prayers before throwing himself in. In so doing he rubbed the magic ring
he still wore. The genie he had seen in the cave appeared, and asked his
will. “Save my life, genie,” said Aladdin, “bring my palace back.” “That
is not in my power,” said the genie; “I am only the Slave of the Ring;
you must ask him of the lamp.” “Even so,” said Aladdin, “but thou canst
take me to the palace, and set me down under my dear wife’s window.” He
at once found himself in Africa, under the window of the Princess, and
fell asleep out of sheer weariness.

He was awakened by the singing of the birds, and his heart was lighter.
He saw plainly that all his misfortunes were owing to the loss of the
lamp, and vainly wondered who had robbed him of it.

That morning the Princess rose earlier than she had done since she had
been carried into Africa by the magician, whose company she was forced
to endure once a day. She, however, treated him so harshly that he dared
not live there altogether. As she was dressing, one of her women looked
out and saw Aladdin. The Princess ran and opened the window, and at the
noise she made Aladdin looked up. She called to him to come to her, and
great was the joy of these lovers at seeing each other again. After he
had kissed her Aladdin said: “I beg of you, Princess, in God’s name,
before we speak of anything else, for your own sake and mine, tell me
that has become of an old lamp I left on the cornice in the hall of
four-and-twenty windows, when I went a-hunting.” “Alas!” she said, “I am
the innocent cause of our sorrows,” and told him of the exchange of the
lamp. “Now I know,” cried Aladdin, “that we have to thank the African
magician for this! Where is the lamp?” “He carries it about with him,”
 said the Princess. “I know, for he pulled it out of his breast to show
me. He wishes me to break my faith with you and marry him, saying that
you were beheaded by my father’s command. He is for ever speaking ill of
you but I only reply by my tears. If I persist, I doubt not but he
will use violence.” Aladdin comforted her, and left her for a while.
He changed clothes with the first person he met in the town, and having
bought a certain powder, returned to the Princess, who let him in by
a little side door. “Put on your most beautiful dress,” he said to her
“and receive the magician with smiles, leading him to believe that you
have forgotten me. Invite him to sup with you, and say you wish to taste
the wine of his country. He will go for some and while he is gone I will
tell you what to do.” She listened carefully to Aladdin and when he left
she arrayed herself gaily for the first time since she left China. She
put on a girdle and head-dress of diamonds, and, seeing in a glass that
she was more beautiful than ever, received the magician, saying, to his
great amazement: “I have made up my mind that Aladdin is dead, and that
all my tears will not bring him back to me, so I am resolved to mourn no
more, and have therefore invited you to sup with me; but I am tired of
the wines of China, and would fain taste those of Africa.” The magician
flew to his cellar, and the Princess put the powder Aladdin had given
her in her cup. When he returned she asked him to drink her health in
the wine of Africa, handing him her cup in exchange for his, as a sign
she was reconciled to him. Before drinking the magician made her a
speech in praise of her beauty, but the Princess cut him short, saying:
“Let us drink first, and you shall say what you will afterward.” She set
her cup to her lips and kept it there, while the magician drained his to
the dregs and fell back lifeless. The Princess then opened the door to
Aladdin, and flung her arms round his neck; but Aladdin put her away,
bidding her leave him, as he had more to do. He then went to the dead
magician, took the lamp out of his vest, and bade the genie carry the
palace and all in it back to China. This was done, and the Princess in
her chamber only felt two little shocks, and little thought she was at
home again.

The Sultan, who was sitting in his closet, mourning for his lost
daughter, happened to look up, and rubbed his eyes, for there stood the
palace as before! He hastened thither, and Aladdin received him in the
hall of the four-and-twenty windows, with the Princess at his side.
Aladdin told him what had happened, and showed him the dead body of the
magician, that he might believe. A ten days’ feast was proclaimed, and
it seemed as if Aladdin might now live the rest of his life in peace;
but it was not to be.

The African magician had a younger brother, who was, if possible, more
wicked and more cunning than himself. He traveled to China to avenge his
brother’s death, and went to visit a pious woman called Fatima, thinking
she might be of use to him. He entered her cell and clapped a dagger to
her breast, telling her to rise and do his bidding on pain of death. He
changed clothes with her, colored his face like hers, put on her veil,
and murdered her, that she might tell no tales. Then he went toward the
palace of Aladdin, and all the people, thinking he was the holy woman,
gathered round him, kissing his hands and begging his blessing. When
he got to the palace there was such a noise going on round him that
the Princess bade her slave look out of the window and ask what was the
matter. The slave said it was the holy woman, curing people by her touch
of their ailments, whereupon the Princess, who had long desired to see
Fatima, sent for her. On coming to the Princess the magician offered up
a prayer for her health and prosperity. When he had done the Princess
made him sit by her, and begged him to stay with her always. The false
Fatima, who wished for nothing better, consented, but kept his veil down
for fear of discovery. The Princess showed him the hall, and asked him
what he thought of it. “It is truly beautiful,” said the false Fatima.
“In my mind it wants but one thing.” “And what is that?” said the
Princess. “If only a roc’s egg,” replied he, “were hung up from the
middle of this dome, it would be the wonder of the world.”

After this the Princess could think of nothing but the roc’s egg, and
when Aladdin returned from hunting he found her in a very ill humor. He
begged to know what was amiss, and she told him that all her pleasure in
the hall was spoiled for the want of a roc’s egg hanging from the dome.
“If that is all,” replied Aladdin, “you shall soon be happy.” He left
her and rubbed the lamp, and when the genie appeared commanded him to
bring a roc’s egg. The genie gave such a loud and terrible shriek that
the hall shook. “Wretch!” he cried, “is it not enough that I have done
everything for you, but you must command me to bring my master and hang
him up in the midst of this dome? You and your wife and your palace
deserve to be burnt to ashes, but that this request does not come from
you, but from the brother of the African magician, whom you destroyed.
He is now in your palace disguised as the holy woman--whom he murdered.
He it was who put that wish into your wife’s head. Take care of
yourself, for he means to kill you.” So saying, the genie disappeared.

Aladdin went back to the Princess, saying his head ached, and requesting
that the holy Fatima should be fetched to lay her hands on it. But when
the magician came near, Aladdin, seizing his dagger, pierced him to the
heart. “What have you done?” cried the Princess. “You have killed the
holy woman!” “Not so,” replied Aladdin, “but a wicked magician,” and
told her of how she had been deceived.

After this Aladdin and his wife lived in peace. He succeeded the Sultan
when he died, and reigned for many years, leaving behind him a long line
of kings.


A father had two sons, of whom the eldest was clever and bright, and
always knew what he was about; but the youngest was stupid, and
couldn’t learn or understand anything. So much so that those who saw him
exclaimed: “What a burden he’ll be to his father!” Now when there was
anything to be done, the eldest had always to do it; but if something
was required later or in the night-time, and the way led through the
churchyard or some such ghostly place, he always replied: “Oh! no,
father: nothing will induce me to go there, it makes me shudder!” for
he was afraid. Or, when they sat of an evening around the fire telling
stories which made one’s flesh creep, the listeners sometimes said:
“Oh! it makes one shudder,” the youngest sat in a corner, heard the
exclamation, and could not understand what it meant. “They are always
saying it makes one shudder! it makes one shudder! Nothing makes me
shudder. It’s probably an art quite beyond me.”

Now it happened that his father said to him one day: “Hearken, you there
in the corner; you are growing big and strong, and you must learn to
earn your own bread. Look at your brother, what pains he takes; but
all the money I’ve spent on your education is thrown away.” “My dear
father,” he replied, “I will gladly learn--in fact, if it were possible
I should like to learn to shudder; I don’t understand that a bit yet.”
 The eldest laughed when he heard this, and thought to himself: “Good
heavens! what a ninny my brother is! he’ll never come to any good;
as the twig is bent, so is the tree inclined.” The father sighed, and
answered him: “You’ll soon learn to shudder; but that won’t help you to
make a living.”

Shortly after this, when the sexton came to pay them a visit, the father
broke out to him, and told him what a bad hand his youngest son was at
everything: he knew nothing and learned nothing. “Only think! when I
asked him how he purposed gaining a livelihood, he actually asked to be
taught to shudder.” “If that’s all he wants,” said the sexton, “I can
teach him that; just you send him to me, I’ll soon polish him up.” The
father was quite pleased with the proposal, because he thought: “It will
be a good discipline for the youth.” And so the sexton took him into his
house, and his duty was to toll the bell. After a few days he woke him
at midnight, and bade him rise and climb into the tower and toll.
“Now, my friend, I’ll teach you to shudder,” thought he. He stole forth
secretly in front, and when the youth was up above, and had turned
round to grasp the bell-rope, he saw, standing opposite the hole of the
belfry, a white figure. “Who’s there?” he called out, but the figure
gave no answer, and neither stirred nor moved. “Answer,” cried the
youth, “or begone; you have no business here at this hour of the night.”
 But the sexton remained motionless, so that the youth might think that
it was a ghost. The youth called out the second time: “What do you want
here? Speak if you are an honest fellow, or I’ll knock you down the
stairs.” The sexton thought: “He can’t mean that in earnest,” so gave
forth no sound, and stood as though he were made of stone. Then the
youth shouted out to him the third time, and as that too had no effect,
he made a dash at the spectre and knocked it down the stairs, so that it
fell about ten steps and remained lying in a corner. Thereupon he tolled
the bell, went home to bed without saying a word, and fell asleep. The
sexton’s wife waited a long time for her husband, but he never appeared.
At last she became anxious, and woke the youth, and asked: “Don’t you
know where my husband is? He went up to the tower in front of you.”
 “No,” answered the youth; “but someone stood on the stairs up there just
opposite the trap-door in the belfry, and because he wouldn’t answer me,
or go away, I took him for a rogue and knocked him down. You’d better go
and see if it was he; I should be much distressed if it were.” The wife
ran and found her husband who was lying groaning in a corner, with his
leg broken.

She carried him down, and then hurried with loud protestations to the
youth’s father. “Your son has been the cause of a pretty misfortune,”
 she cried; “he threw my husband downstairs so that he broke his leg.
Take the good-for-nothing wretch out of our house.” The father was
horrified, hurried to the youth, and gave him a scolding.

“What unholy pranks are these? The evil one must have put them into your
head.” “Father,” he replied, “only listen to me; I am quite guiltless.
He stood there in the night, like one who meant harm. I didn’t know who
it was, and warned him three times to speak or begone.” “Oh!” groaned
the father, “you’ll bring me nothing but misfortune; get out of my
sight, I won’t have anything more to do with you.” “Yes, father,
willingly; only wait till daylight, then I’ll set out and learn to
shudder, and in that way I shall be master of an art which will gain me
a living.” “Learn what you will,” said the father, “it’s all one to me.
Here are fifty dollars for you, set forth into the wide world with them;
but see you tell no one where you come from or who your father is, for
I am ashamed of you.” “Yes, father, whatever you wish; and if that’s all
you ask, I can easily keep it in mind.”

When day broke the youth put the fifty dollars into his pocket, set out
on the hard high road, and kept muttering to himself: “If I could only
shudder! if I could only shudder!” Just at this moment a man came by who
heard the youth speaking to himself, and when they had gone on a bit and
were in sight of the gallows the man said to him: “Look! there is the
tree where seven people have been hanged, and are now learning to fly;
sit down under it and wait till nightfall, and then you’ll pretty soon
learn to shudder.” “If that’s all I have to do,” answered the youth,
“it’s easily done; but if I learn to shudder so quickly, then you shall
have my fifty dollars. Just come back to me to-morrow morning early.”
 Then the youth went to the gallows-tree and sat down underneath it, and
waited for the evening; and because he felt cold he lit himself a fire.
But at midnight it got so chill that in spite of the fire he couldn’t
keep warm. And as the wind blew the corpses one against the other,
tossing them to and fro, he thought to himself: “If you are perishing
down here by the fire, how those poor things up there must be shaking
and shivering!” And because he had a tender heart, he put up a ladder,
which he climbed unhooked one body after the other, and took down all
the seven. Then he stirred the fire, blew it up, and placed them all
round in a circle, that they might warm themselves. But they sat there
and did not move, and the fire caught their clothes. Then he spoke:
“Take care, or I’ll hang you up again.” But the dead men did not hear
and let their rags go on burning. Then he got angry, and said: “If you
aren’t careful yourselves, then I can’t help you, and I don’t mean to
burn with you”; and he hung them up again in a row. Then he sat down at
his fire and fell asleep. On the following morning the man came to him,
and, wishing to get his fifty dollars, said: “Now you know what it is to
shudder.” “No,” he answered, “how should I? Those fellows up there never
opened their mouths, and were so stupid that they let those few old
tatters they have on their bodies burn.” Then the man saw he wouldn’t
get his fifty dollars that day, and went off, saying: “Well, I’m blessed
if I ever met such a person in my life before.”

The youth went too on his way, and began to murmur to himself: “Oh! if I
could only shudder! if I could only shudder!” A carrier who was walking
behind him heard these words, and asked him: “Who are you” “I don’t
know,” said the youth. “Where do you hail from?” “I don’t know.” “Who’s
your father?” “I mayn’t say.” “What are you constantly muttering to
yourself?” “Oh!” said the youth, “I would give worlds to shudder, but no
one can teach me.” “Stuff and nonsense!” spoke the carrier; “come along
with me, and I’ll soon put that right.” The youth went with the carrier,
and in the evening they reached an inn, where they were to spend the
night. Then, just as he was entering the room, he said again, quite
aloud: “Oh! if I could only shudder! if I could only shudder!” The
landlord, who heard this, laughed and said: “If that’s what you’re
sighing for, you shall be given every opportunity here.” “Oh! hold your
tongue!” said the landlord’s wife; “so many people have paid for their
curiosity with their lives, it were a thousand pities if those beautiful
eyes were never again to behold daylight.” But the youth said: “No
matter how difficult, I insist on learning it; why, that’s what I’ve set
out to do.” He left the landlord no peace till he told him that in the
neighborhood stood a haunted castle, where one could easily learn to
shudder if one only kept watch in it for three nights. The King had
promised the man who dared to do this thing his daughter as wife, and
she was the most beautiful maiden under the sun. There was also much
treasure hid in the castle, guarded by evil spirits, which would then
be free, and was sufficient to make a poor man more than rich. Many had
already gone in, but so far none had ever come out again. So the youth
went to the King and spoke: “If I were allowed, I should much like
to watch for three nights in the castle.” The King looked at him, and
because he pleased him, he said: “You can ask for three things, none of
them living, and those you may take with you into the castle.” Then he
answered: “Well, I shall beg for a fire, a turning lathe, and a carving
bench with the knife attached.”

On the following day the King had everything put into the castle; and
when night drew on the youth took up his position there, lit a bright
fire in one of the rooms, placed the carving bench with the knife close
to it, and sat himself down on the turning lathe. “Oh! if I could only
shudder!” he said: “but I sha’n’t learn it here either.” Toward midnight
he wanted to make up the fire, and as he was blowing up a blaze he heard
a shriek from a corner. “Ou, miou! how cold we are!” “You fools!” he
cried; “why do you scream? If you are cold, come and sit at the fire and
warm yourselves.” And as he spoke two huge black cats sprang fiercely
forward and sat down, one on each side of him, and gazed wildly at him
with their fiery eyes. After a time, when they had warmed themselves,
they said: “Friend, shall we play a little game of cards?” “Why not?” he
replied; “but first let me see your paws.” Then they stretched out their
claws. “Ha!” said he; “what long nails you’ve got! Wait a minute: I must
first cut them off.” Thereupon he seized them by the scruff of their
necks, lifted them on to the carving bench, and screwed down their paws
firmly. “After watching you narrowly,” said he, “I no longer feel any
desire to play cards with you”; and with these words he struck them dead
and threw them out into the water. But when he had thus sent the two of
them to their final rest, and was again about to sit down at the fire,
out of every nook and corner came forth black cats and black dogs with
fiery chains in such swarms that he couldn’t possibly get away from
them. They yelled in the most ghastly manner, jumped upon his fire,
scattered it all, and tried to put it out. He looked on quietly for
a time, but when it got beyond a joke he seized his carving-knife and
called out: “Be off, you rabble rout!” and let fly at them. Some of them
fled away, and the others he struck dead and threw them out into the
pond below. When he returned he blew up the sparks of the fire once
more, and warmed himself. And as he sat thus his eyes refused to keep
open any longer, and a desire to sleep stole over him. Then he looked
around him and beheld in the corner a large bed. “The very thing,” he
said, and laid himself down in it. But when he wished to close his
eyes the bed began to move by itself, and ran all round the castle.
“Capital,” he said, “only a little quicker.” Then the bed sped on as if
drawn by six horses, over thresholds and stairs, up this way and down
that. All of a sudden--crash, crash! with a bound it turned over, upside
down, and lay like a mountain on the top of him. But he tossed the
blankets and pillows in the air, emerged from underneath, and said: “Now
anyone who has the fancy for it may go a drive,” lay down at his fire,
and slept till daylight. In the morning the King came, and when he
beheld him lying on the ground he imagined the ghosts had been too much
for him, and that he was dead. Then he said: “What a pity! and such a
fine fellow he was.” The youth heard this, got up, and said: “It’s not
come to that yet.” Then the King was astonished, but very glad, and
asked how it had fared with him. “First-rate,” he answered; “and now
I’ve survived the one night, I shall get through the other two also.”
 The landlord, when he went to him, opened his eyes wide, and said:
“Well, I never thought to see you alive again. Have you learned now what
shuddering is?” “No,” he replied, “it’s quite hopeless; if someone could
only tell me how to!”

The second night he went up again to the old castle, sat down at the
fire, and began his old refrain: “If I could only shudder!” As midnight
approached, a noise and din broke out, at first gentle, but gradually
increasing; then all was quiet for a minute, and at length, with a loud
scream, half of a man dropped down the chimney and fell before him. “Hi,
up there!” shouted he; “there’s another half wanted down here, that’s
not enough”; then the din commenced once more, there was a shrieking
and a yelling, and then the other half fell down. “Wait a bit,” he said;
“I’ll stir up the fire for you.” When he had done this and again looked
around, the two pieces had united, and a horrible-looking man sat on his
seat. “Come,” said the youth, “I didn’t bargain for that, the seat is
mine.” The man tried to shove him away, but the youth wouldn’t allow
it for a moment, and, pushing him off by force, sat down in his place
again. Then more men dropped down, one after the other, who fetching
nine skeleton legs and two skulls, put them up and played ninepins with
them. The youth thought he would like to play too, and said: “Look here;
do you mind my joining the game?” “No, not if you have money.” “I’ve
money enough,” he replied, “but your balls aren’t round enough.” Then
he took the skulls, placed them on his lathe, and turned them till they
were round. “Now they’ll roll along better,” said he, “and houp-la! now
the fun begins.” He played with them and lost some of his money, but
when twelve struck everything vanished before his eyes. He lay down and
slept peacefully. The next morning the King came, anxious for news. “How
have you got on this time?” he asked. “I played ninepins,” he answered,
“and lost a few pence.” “Didn’t you shudder then?” “No such luck,” said
he; “I made myself merry. Oh! if I only knew what it was to shudder!”

On the third night he sat down again on his bench, and said, in the most
desponding way: “If I could only shudder!” When it got late, six big men
came in carrying a coffin. Then he cried: “Ha! ha! that’s most likely
my little cousin who only died a few days ago”; and beckoning with his
finger he called out: “Come, my small cousin, come.” They placed the
coffin on the ground, and he approached it and took off the cover. In
it lay a dead man. He felt his face, and it was cold as ice. “Wait,” he
said “I’ll heat you up a bit,” went to the fire, warmed his hand, and
laid it on the man’s face, but the dead remained cold. Then he lifted
him out, sat down at the fire, laid him on his knee, and rubbed his arms
that the blood should circulate again. When that too had no effect it
occurred to him that if two people lay together in bed they warmed each
other; so he put him into the bed, covered him up, and lay down beside
him; after a time the corpse became warm and began to move. Then the
youth said: “Now, my little cousin, what would have happened if I
hadn’t warmed you?” But the dead man rose up and cried out: “Now I
will strangle you.” “What!” said he, “is that all the thanks I get? You
should be put straight back into your coffin,” lifted him up, threw him
in, and closed the lid. Then the six men came and carried him out again.
“I simply can’t shudder,” he said, “and it’s clear I sha’n’t learn it in
a lifetime here.”

Then a man entered, of more than ordinary size and of a very fearful
appearance; but he was old and had a white beard. “Oh! you miserable
creature, now you will soon know what it is to shudder,” he cried, “for
you must die.” “Not so quickly,” answered the youth. “If I am to die,
you must catch me first.” “I shall soon lay hold of you,” spoke the
monster. “Gently, gently, don’t boast too much, I’m as strong as you,
and stronger too.” “We’ll soon see,” said the old man; “if you are
stronger than I then I’ll let you off; come, let’s have a try.” Then he
led him through some dark passages to a forge, and grasping an axe he
drove one of the anvils with a blow into the earth. “I can do better
than that,” cried the youth, and went to the other anvil. The old man
drew near him in order to watch closely, and his white beard hung right
down. The youth seized the axe, cleft the anvil open, and jammed in the
old man’s beard. “Now I have you,” said the youth; “this time it’s your
turn to die.” Then he seized an iron rod and belabored the old man till
he, whimpering, begged him to leave off, and he would give him great
riches. The youth drew out the axe and let him go. The old man led him
back to the castle and showed him in a cellar three chests of gold. “One
of these,” said he, “belongs to the poor, one to the King, and the
third is yours.” At that moment twelve struck, and the spirit vanished,
leaving the youth alone in the dark. “I’ll surely be able to find a way
out,” said he, and groping about he at length found his way back to the
room, and fell asleep at his fire. The next morning the King came, and
said: “Well, now you’ve surely learned to shudder?” “No,” he answered;
“what can it be? My dead cousin was here, and an old bearded man came,
who showed me heaps of money down below there, but what shuddering is no
one has told me.” Then the King spoke: “You have freed the castle from
its curse, and you shall marry my daughter.” “That’s all charming,” he
said; “but I still don’t know what it is to shudder.”

Then the gold was brought up, and the wedding was celebrated, but the
young King, though he loved his wife dearly, and though he was very
happy, still kept on saying: “If I could only shudder! if I could only
shudder!” At last he reduced her to despair. Then her maid said: “I’ll
help you; we’ll soon make him shudder.” So she went out to the stream
that flowed through the garden, and had a pail full of little gudgeons
brought to her. At night, when the young King was asleep, his wife had
to pull the clothes off him, and pour the pail full of little gudgeons
over him, so that the little fish swam all about him. Then he awoke and
cried out: “Oh! how I shudder, how I shudder, dear wife! Yes, now I know
what shuddering is.”


There was once upon a time a poor miller who had a very beautiful
daughter. Now it happened one day that he had an audience with the King,
and in order to appear a person of some importance he told him that
he had a daughter who could spin straw into gold. “Now that’s a talent
worth having,” said the King to the miller; “if your daughter is as
clever as you say, bring her to my palace to-morrow, and I’ll put her to
the test.” When the girl was brought to him he led her into a room full
of straw, gave her a spinning-wheel and spindle, and said: “Now set to
work and spin all night till early dawn, and if by that time you haven’t
spun the straw into gold you shall die.” Then he closed the door behind
him and left her alone inside.

So the poor miller’s daughter sat down, and didn’t know what in the
world she was to do. She hadn’t the least idea of how to spin straw into
gold, and became at last so miserable that she began to cry.
Suddenly the door opened, and in stepped a tiny little man and said:
“Good-evening, Miss Miller-maid; why are you crying so bitterly?” “Oh!”
 answered the girl, “I have to spin straw into gold, and haven’t a notion
how it’s done.” “What will you give me if I spin it for you?” asked
the manikin. “My necklace,” replied the girl. The little man took the
necklace, sat himself down at the wheel, and whir, whir, whir, the wheel
went round three times, and the bobbin was full. Then he put on another,
and whir, whir, whir, the wheel went round three times, and the second
too was full; and so it went on till the morning, when all the straw
was spun away, and all the bobbins were full of gold. As soon as the sun
rose the King came, and when he perceived the gold he was astonished and
delighted, but his heart only lusted more than ever after the precious
metal. He had the miller’s daughter put into another room full of straw,
much bigger than the first, and bade her, if she valued her life, spin
it all into gold before the following morning. The girl didn’t know what
to do, and began to cry; then the door opened as before, and the tiny
little man appeared and said: “What’ll you give me if I spin the straw
into gold for you?” “The ring from my finger,” answered the girl. The
manikin took the ring, and whir! round went the spinning-wheel again,
and when morning broke he had spun all the straw into glittering gold.
The King was pleased beyond measure at the sights but his greed for gold
was still not satisfied, and he had the miller’s daughter brought into a
yet bigger room full of straw, and said: “You must spin all this away
in the night; but if you succeed this time you shall become my wife.”
 “She’s only a miller’s daughter, it’s true,” he thought; “but I couldn’t
find a richer wife if I were to search the whole world over.” When the
girl was alone the little man appeared for the third time, and said:
“What’ll you give me if I spin the straw for you once again?” “I’ve
nothing more to give,” answered the girl. “Then promise me when you
are Queen to give me your first child.” “Who knows what may not happen
before that?” thought the miller’s daughter; and besides, she saw no
other way out of it, so she promised the manikin what he demanded, and
he set to work once more and spun the straw into gold. When the
King came in the morning, and found everything as he had desired, he
straightway made her his wife, and the miller’s daughter became a queen.

When a year had passed a beautiful son was born to her, and she thought
no more of the little man, till all of a sudden one day he stepped into
her room and said: “Now give me what you promised.” The Queen was in a
great state, and offered the little man all the riches in her kingdom if
he would only leave her the child. But the manikin said: “No, a living
creature is dearer to me than all the treasures in the world.” Then the
Queen began to cry and sob so bitterly that the little man was sorry for
her, and said: “I’ll give you three days to guess my name, and if you
find it out in that time you may keep your child.”

Then the Queen pondered the whole night over all the names she had ever
heard, and sent a messenger to scour the land, and to pick up far and
near any names he could come across. When the little man arrived on the
following day she began with Kasper, Melchior, Belshazzar, and all the
other names she knew, in a string, but at each one the manikin called
out: “That’s not my name.” The next day she sent to inquire the names
of all the people in the neighborhood, and had a long list of the
most uncommon and extraordinary for the little man when he made
his appearance. “Is your name, perhaps, Sheepshanks Cruickshanks,
Spindleshanks?” but he always replied: “That’s not my name.” On the
third day the messenger returned and announced: “I have not been able to
find any new names, but as I came upon a high hill round the corner of
the wood, where the foxes and hares bid each other good-night, I saw
a little house, and in front of the house burned a fire, and round
the fire sprang the most grotesque little man, hopping on one leg and
crying:

  “To-morrow I brew, to-day I bake,
    And then the child away I’ll take;
    For little deems my royal dame
    That Rumpelstiltzkin is my name!”


You can imagine the Queen’s delight at hearing the name, and when the
little man stepped in shortly afterward and asked: “Now, my lady Queen,
what’s my name?” she asked first: “Is your name Conrad?” “No.” “Is your
name Harry?” “No.” “Is your name perhaps, Rumpelstiltzkin?” “Some demon
has told you that! some demon has told you that!” screamed the little
man, and in his rage drove his right foot so far into the ground that it
sank in up to his waist; then in a passion he seized the left foot with
both hands and tore himself in two.(1)


Once upon a time, in a very far-off country, there lived a merchant who
had been so fortunate in all his undertakings that he was enormously
rich. As he had, however, six sons and six daughters, he found that his
money was not too much to let them all have everything they fancied, as
they were accustomed to do.

But one day a most unexpected misfortune befell them. Their house
caught fire and was speedily burnt to the ground, with all the splendid
furniture, the books, pictures, gold, silver, and precious goods it
contained; and this was only the beginning of their troubles. Their
father, who had until this moment prospered in all ways, suddenly lost
every ship he had upon the sea, either by dint of pirates, shipwreck,
or fire. Then he heard that his clerks in distant countries, whom he
trusted entirely, had proved unfaithful; and at last from great wealth
he fell into the direst poverty.

All that he had left was a little house in a desolate place at least a
hundred leagues from the town in which he had lived, and to this he was
forced to retreat with his children, who were in despair at the idea of
leading such a different life. Indeed, the daughters at first hoped
that their friends, who had been so numerous while they were rich, would
insist on their staying in their houses now they no longer possessed
one. But they soon found that they were left alone, and that their
former friends even attributed their misfortunes to their own
extravagance, and showed no intention of offering them any help. So
nothing was left for them but to take their departure to the cottage,
which stood in the midst of a dark forest, and seemed to be the most
dismal place upon the face of the earth. As they were too poor to have
any servants, the girls had to work hard, like peasants, and the sons,
for their part, cultivated the fields to earn their living. Roughly
clothed, and living in the simplest way, the girls regretted unceasingly
the luxuries and amusements of their former life; only the youngest
tried to be brave and cheerful. She had been as sad as anyone when
misfortune overtook her father, but, soon recovering her natural gaiety,
she set to work to make the best of things, to amuse her father and
brothers as well as she could, and to try to persuade her sisters to
join her in dancing and singing. But they would do nothing of the sort,
and, because she was not as doleful as themselves, they declared that
this miserable life was all she was fit for. But she was really far
prettier and cleverer than they were; indeed, she was so lovely that she
was always called Beauty. After two years, when they were all beginning
to get used to their new life, something happened to disturb their
tranquillity. Their father received the news that one of his ships,
which he had believed to be lost, had come safely into port with a rich
cargo. All the sons and daughters at once thought that their poverty
was at an end, and wanted to set out directly for the town; but their
father, who was more prudent, begged them to wait a little, and, though
it was harvest time, and he could ill be spared, determined to go
himself first, to make inquiries. Only the youngest daughter had any
doubt but that they would soon again be as rich as they were before, or
at least rich enough to live comfortably in some town where they would
find amusement and gay companions once more. So they all loaded their
father with commissions for jewels and dresses which it would have taken
a fortune to buy; only Beauty, feeling sure that it was of no use, did
not ask for anything. Her father, noticing her silence, said: “And what
shall I bring for you, Beauty?”

“The only thing I wish for is to see you come home safely,” she
answered.

But this only vexed her sisters, who fancied she was blaming them for
having asked for such costly things. Her father, however, was pleased,
but as he thought that at her age she certainly ought to like pretty
presents, he told her to choose something.

“Well, dear father,” she said, “as you insist upon it, I beg that you
will bring me a rose. I have not seen one since we came here, and I love
them so much.”

So the merchant set out and reached the town as quickly as possible, but
only to find that his former companions, believing him to be dead, had
divided between them the goods which the ship had brought; and after
six months of trouble and expense he found himself as poor as when he
started, having been able to recover only just enough to pay the cost of
his journey. To make matters worse, he was obliged to leave the town
in the most terrible weather, so that by the time he was within a few
leagues of his home he was almost exhausted with cold and fatigue.
Though he knew it would take some hours to get through the forest, he
was so anxious to be at his journey’s end that he resolved to go on;
but night overtook him, and the deep snow and bitter frost made it
impossible for his horse to carry him any further. Not a house was to
be seen; the only shelter he could get was the hollow trunk of a great
tree, and there he crouched all the night which seemed to him the
longest he had ever known. In spite of his weariness the howling of the
wolves kept him awake, and even when at last the day broke he was not
much better off, for the falling snow had covered up every path, and he
did not know which way to turn.

At length he made out some sort of track, and though at the beginning it
was so rough and slippery that he fell down more than once, it presently
became easier, and led him into an avenue of trees which ended in a
splendid castle. It seemed to the merchant very strange that no snow
had fallen in the avenue, which was entirely composed of orange trees,
covered with flowers and fruit. When he reached the first court of the
castle he saw before him a flight of agate steps, and went up them, and
passed through several splendidly furnished rooms. The pleasant warmth
of the air revived him, and he felt very hungry; but there seemed to be
nobody in all this vast and splendid palace whom he could ask to give
him something to eat. Deep silence reigned everywhere, and at last,
tired of roaming through empty rooms and galleries, he stopped in a room
smaller than the rest, where a clear fire was burning and a couch was
drawn up closely to it. Thinking that this must be prepared for someone
who was expected, he sat down to wait till he should come, and very soon
fell into a sweet sleep.

When his extreme hunger wakened him after several hours, he was still
alone; but a little table, upon which was a good dinner, had been drawn
up close to him, and, as he had eaten nothing for twenty-four hours, he
lost no time in beginning his meal, hoping that he might soon have an
opportunity of thanking his considerate entertainer, whoever it might
be. But no one appeared, and even after another long sleep, from which
he awoke completely refreshed, there was no sign of anybody, though a
fresh meal of dainty cakes and fruit was prepared upon the little table
at his elbow. Being naturally timid, the silence began to terrify him,
and he resolved to search once more through all the rooms; but it was of
no use. Not even a servant was to be seen; there was no sign of life in
the palace! He began to wonder what he should do, and to amuse
himself by pretending that all the treasures he saw were his own, and
considering how he would divide them among his children. Then he went
down into the garden, and though it was winter everywhere else, here the
sun shone, and the birds sang, and the flowers bloomed, and the air was
soft and sweet. The merchant, in ecstacies with all he saw and heard,
said to himself:

“All this must be meant for me. I will go this minute and bring my
children to share all these delights.”

In spite of being so cold and weary when he reached the castle, he had
taken his horse to the stable and fed it. Now he thought he would saddle
it for his homeward journey, and he turned down the path which led to
the stable. This path had a hedge of roses on each side of it, and the
merchant thought he had never seen or smelt such exquisite flowers.
They reminded him of his promise to Beauty, and he stopped and had just
gathered one to take to her when he was startled by a strange noise
behind him. Turning round, he saw a frightful Beast, which seemed to be
very angry and said, in a terrible voice:

“Who told you that you might gather my roses? Was it not enough that I
allowed you to be in my palace and was kind to you? This is the way you
show your gratitude, by stealing my flowers! But your insolence shall
not go unpunished.” The merchant, terrified by these furious words,
dropped the fatal rose, and, throwing himself on his knees, cried:
“Pardon me, noble sir. I am truly grateful to you for your hospitality,
which was so magnificent that I could not imagine that you would be
offended by my taking such a little thing as a rose.” But the Beast’s
anger was not lessened by this speech.

“You are very ready with excuses and flattery,” he cried; “but that will
not save you from the death you deserve.”

“Alas!” thought the merchant, “if my daughter could only know what
danger her rose has brought me into!”

And in despair he began to tell the Beast all his misfortunes, and the
reason of his journey, not forgetting to mention Beauty’s request.

“A king’s ransom would hardly have procured all that my other daughters
asked.” he said: “but I thought that I might at least take Beauty her
rose. I beg you to forgive me, for you see I meant no harm.”

The Beast considered for a moment, and then he said, in a less furious
tone:

“I will forgive you on one condition--that is, that you will give me one
of your daughters.”

“Ah!” cried the merchant, “if I were cruel enough to buy my own life at
the expense of one of my children’s, what excuse could I invent to bring
her here?”

“No excuse would be necessary,” answered the Beast. “If she comes at all
she must come willingly. On no other condition will I have her. See if
any one of them is courageous enough, and loves you well enough to come
and save your life. You seem to be an honest man, so I will trust you to
go home. I give you a month to see if either of your daughters will come
back with you and stay here, to let you go free. If neither of them is
willing, you must come alone, after bidding them good-by for ever, for
then you will belong to me. And do not imagine that you can hide from
me, for if you fail to keep your word I will come and fetch you!” added
the Beast grimly.

The merchant accepted this proposal, though he did not really think any
of his daughters could be persuaded to come. He promised to return at
the time appointed, and then, anxious to escape from the presence of the
Beast, he asked permission to set off at once. But the Beast answered
that he could not go until next day.

“Then you will find a horse ready for you,” he said. “Now go and eat
your supper, and await my orders.”

The poor merchant, more dead than alive, went back to his room, where
the most delicious supper was already served on the little table which
was drawn up before a blazing fire. But he was too terrified to eat, and
only tasted a few of the dishes, for fear the Beast should be angry if
he did not obey his orders. When he had finished he heard a great noise
in the next room, which he knew meant that the Beast was coming. As he
could do nothing to escape his visit, the only thing that remained was
to seem as little afraid as possible; so when the Beast appeared and
asked roughly if he had supped well, the merchant answered humbly that
he had, thanks to his host’s kindness. Then the Beast warned him to
remember their agreement, and to prepare his daughter exactly for what
she had to expect.

“Do not get up to-morrow,” he added, “until you see the sun and hear
a golden bell ring. Then you will find your breakfast waiting for you
here, and the horse you are to ride will be ready in the courtyard. He
will also bring you back again when you come with your daughter a month
hence. Farewell. Take a rose to Beauty, and remember your promise!”

The merchant was only too glad when the Beast went away, and though he
could not sleep for sadness, he lay down until the sun rose. Then, after
a hasty breakfast, he went to gather Beauty’s rose, and mounted his
horse, which carried him off so swiftly that in an instant he had lost
sight of the palace, and he was still wrapped in gloomy thoughts when it
stopped before the door of the cottage.

His sons and daughters, who had been very uneasy at his long absence,
rushed to meet him, eager to know the result of his journey, which,
seeing him mounted upon a splendid horse and wrapped in a rich mantle,
they supposed to be favorable. He hid the truth from them at first, only
saying sadly to Beauty as he gave her the rose:

“Here is what you asked me to bring you; you little know what it has
cost.”

But this excited their curiosity so greatly that presently he told
them his adventures from beginning to end, and then they were all very
unhappy. The girls lamented loudly over their lost hopes, and the sons
declared that their father should not return to this terrible castle,
and began to make plans for killing the Beast if it should come to fetch
him. But he reminded them that he had promised to go back. Then the
girls were very angry with Beauty, and said it was all her fault, and
that if she had asked for something sensible this would never have
happened, and complained bitterly that they should have to suffer for
her folly.

Poor Beauty, much distressed, said to them:

“I have, indeed, caused this misfortune, but I assure you I did it
innocently. Who could have guessed that to ask for a rose in the middle
of summer would cause so much misery? But as I did the mischief it is
only just that I should suffer for it. I will therefore go back with my
father to keep his promise.”

At first nobody would hear of this arrangement, and her father and
brothers, who loved her dearly, declared that nothing should make them
let her go; but Beauty was firm. As the time drew near she divided
all her little possessions between her sisters, and said good-by to
everything she loved, and when the fatal day came she encouraged and
cheered her father as they mounted together the horse which had brought
him back. It seemed to fly rather than gallop, but so smoothly that
Beauty was not frightened; indeed, she would have enjoyed the journey if
she had not feared what might happen to her at the end of it. Her father
still tried to persuade her to go back, but in vain. While they were
talking the night fell, and then, to their great surprise, wonderful
colored lights began to shine in all directions, and splendid fireworks
blazed out before them; all the forest was illuminated by them, and
even felt pleasantly warm, though it had been bitterly cold before. This
lasted until they reached the avenue of orange trees, where were statues
holding flaming torches, and when they got nearer to the palace they saw
that it was illuminated from the roof to the ground, and music sounded
softly from the courtyard. “The Beast must be very hungry,” said Beauty,
trying to laugh, “if he makes all this rejoicing over the arrival of his
prey.”

But, in spite of her anxiety, she could not help admiring all the
wonderful things she saw.

The horse stopped at the foot of the flight of steps leading to the
terrace, and when they had dismounted her father led her to the little
room he had been in before, where they found a splendid fire burning,
and the table daintily spread with a delicious supper.

The merchant knew that this was meant for them, and Beauty, who was
rather less frightened now that she had passed through so many rooms and
seen nothing of the Beast, was quite willing to begin, for her long ride
had made her very hungry. But they had hardly finished their meal when
the noise of the Beast’s footsteps was heard approaching, and Beauty
clung to her father in terror, which became all the greater when she saw
how frightened he was. But when the Beast really appeared, though
she trembled at the sight of him, she made a great effort to hide her
terror, and saluted him respectfully.

This evidently pleased the Beast. After looking at her he said, in a
tone that might have struck terror into the boldest heart, though he did
not seem to be angry:

“Good-evening, old man. Good-evening, Beauty.”

The merchant was too terrified to reply, but Beauty answered sweetly:
“Good-evening, Beast.”

“Have you come willingly?” asked the Beast. “Will you be content to stay
here when your father goes away?”

Beauty answered bravely that she was quite prepared to stay.

“I am pleased with you,” said the Beast. “As you have come of your own
accord, you may stay. As for you, old man,” he added, turning to the
merchant, “at sunrise to-morrow you will take your departure. When the
bell rings get up quickly and eat your breakfast, and you will find the
same horse waiting to take you home; but remember that you must never
expect to see my palace again.”

Then turning to Beauty, he said:

“Take your father into the next room, and help him to choose everything
you think your brothers and sisters would like to have. You will find
two traveling-trunks there; fill them as full as you can. It is only
just that you should send them something very precious as a remembrance
of yourself.”

Then he went away, after saying, “Good-by, Beauty; good-by, old man”;
and though Beauty was beginning to think with great dismay of her
father’s departure, she was afraid to disobey the Beast’s orders; and
they went into the next room, which had shelves and cupboards all round
it. They were greatly surprised at the riches it contained. There were
splendid dresses fit for a queen, with all the ornaments that were to
be worn with them; and when Beauty opened the cupboards she was quite
dazzled by the gorgeous jewels that lay in heaps upon every shelf. After
choosing a vast quantity, which she divided between her sisters--for she
had made a heap of the wonderful dresses for each of them--she opened
the last chest, which was full of gold.

“I think, father,” she said, “that, as the gold will be more useful to
you, we had better take out the other things again, and fill the trunks
with it.” So they did this; but the more they put in the more room there
seemed to be, and at last they put back all the jewels and dresses they
had taken out, and Beauty even added as many more of the jewels as she
could carry at once; and then the trunks were not too full, but they
were so heavy that an elephant could not have carried them!

“The Beast was mocking us,” cried the merchant; “he must have pretended
to give us all these things, knowing that I could not carry them away.”

“Let us wait and see,” answered Beauty. “I cannot believe that he meant
to deceive us. All we can do is to fasten them up and leave them ready.”

So they did this and returned to the little room, where, to their
astonishment, they found breakfast ready. The merchant ate his with a
good appetite, as the Beast’s generosity made him believe that he might
perhaps venture to come back soon and see Beauty. But she felt sure that
her father was leaving her for ever, so she was very sad when the bell
rang sharply for the second time, and warned them that the time had come
for them to part. They went down into the courtyard, where two horses
were waiting, one loaded with the two trunks, the other for him to
ride. They were pawing the ground in their impatience to start, and the
merchant was forced to bid Beauty a hasty farewell; and as soon as he
was mounted he went off at such a pace that she lost sight of him in an
instant. Then Beauty began to cry, and wandered sadly back to her
own room. But she soon found that she was very sleepy, and as she had
nothing better to do she lay down and instantly fell asleep. And then
she dreamed that she was walking by a brook bordered with trees, and
lamenting her sad fate, when a young prince, handsomer than anyone she
had ever seen, and with a voice that went straight to her heart, came
and said to her, “Ah, Beauty! you are not so unfortunate as you suppose.
Here you will be rewarded for all you have suffered elsewhere. Your
every wish shall be gratified. Only try to find me out, no matter how I
may be disguised, as I love you dearly, and in making me happy you will
find your own happiness. Be as true-hearted as you are beautiful, and we
shall have nothing left to wish for.”

“What can I do, Prince, to make you happy?” said Beauty.

“Only be grateful,” he answered, “and do not trust too much to your
eyes. And, above all, do not desert me until you have saved me from my
cruel misery.”

After this she thought she found herself in a room with a stately and
beautiful lady, who said to her:

“Dear Beauty, try not to regret all you have left behind you, for you
are destined to a better fate. Only do not let yourself be deceived by
appearances.”

Beauty found her dreams so interesting that she was in no hurry to
awake, but presently the clock roused her by calling her name softly
twelve times, and then she got up and found her dressing-table set
out with everything she could possibly want; and when her toilet was
finished she found dinner was waiting in the room next to hers. But
dinner does not take very long when you are all by yourself, and very
soon she sat down cosily in the corner of a sofa, and began to think
about the charming Prince she had seen in her dream.

“He said I could make him happy,” said Beauty to herself.

“It seems, then, that this horrible Beast keeps him a prisoner. How
can I set him free? I wonder why they both told me not to trust to
appearances? I don’t understand it. But, after all, it was only a
dream, so why should I trouble myself about it? I had better go and find
something to do to amuse myself.”

So she got up and began to explore some of the many rooms of the palace.

The first she entered was lined with mirrors, and Beauty saw herself
reflected on every side, and thought she had never seen such a charming
room. Then a bracelet which was hanging from a chandelier caught her
eye, and on taking it down she was greatly surprised to find that it
held a portrait of her unknown admirer, just as she had seen him in her
dream. With great delight she slipped the bracelet on her arm, and went
on into a gallery of pictures, where she soon found a portrait of the
same handsome Prince, as large as life, and so well painted that as she
studied it he seemed to smile kindly at her. Tearing herself away from
the portrait at last, she passed through into a room which contained
every musical instrument under the sun, and here she amused herself for
a long while in trying some of them, and singing until she was tired.
The next room was a library, and she saw everything she had ever wanted
to read, as well as everything she had read, and it seemed to her that a
whole lifetime would not be enough to even read the names of the books,
there were so many. By this time it was growing dusk, and wax candles
in diamond and ruby candlesticks were beginning to light themselves in
every room.

Beauty found her supper served just at the time she preferred to have
it, but she did not see anyone or hear a sound, and, though her father
had warned her that she would be alone, she began to find it rather
dull.

But presently she heard the Beast coming, and wondered tremblingly if he
meant to eat her up now.

However, as he did not seem at all ferocious, and only said gruffly:

“Good-evening, Beauty,” she answered cheerfully and managed to conceal
her terror. Then the Beast asked her how she had been amusing herself,
and she told him all the rooms she had seen.

Then he asked if she thought she could be happy in his palace; and
Beauty answered that everything was so beautiful that she would be very
hard to please if she could not be happy. And after about an hour’s talk
Beauty began to think that the Beast was not nearly so terrible as she
had supposed at first. Then he got up to leave her, and said in his
gruff voice:

“Do you love me, Beauty? Will you marry me?”

“Oh! what shall I say?” cried Beauty, for she was afraid to make the
Beast angry by refusing.

“Say ‘yes’ or ‘no’ without fear,” he replied.

“Oh! no, Beast,” said Beauty hastily.

“Since you will not, good-night, Beauty,” he said.

And she answered, “Good-night, Beast,” very glad to find that her
refusal had not provoked him. And after he was gone she was very soon in
bed and asleep, and dreaming of her unknown Prince. She thought he came
and said to her:

“Ah, Beauty! why are you so unkind to me? I fear I am fated to be
unhappy for many a long day still.”

And then her dreams changed, but the charming Prince figured in
them all; and when morning came her first thought was to look at the
portrait, and see if it was really like him, and she found that it
certainly was.

This morning she decided to amuse herself in the garden, for the sun
shone, and all the fountains were playing; but she was astonished to
find that every place was familiar to her, and presently she came to the
brook where the myrtle trees were growing where she had first met the
Prince in her dream, and that made her think more than ever that he must
be kept a prisoner by the Beast. When she was tired she went back to
the palace, and found a new room full of materials for every kind of
work--ribbons to make into bows, and silks to work into flowers. Then
there was an aviary full of rare birds, which were so tame that they
flew to Beauty as soon as they saw her, and perched upon her shoulders
and her head.

“Pretty little creatures,” she said, “how I wish that your cage was
nearer to my room, that I might often hear you sing!”

So saying she opened a door, and found, to her delight, that it led into
her own room, though she had thought it was quite the other side of the
palace.

There were more birds in a room farther on, parrots and cockatoos that
could talk, and they greeted Beauty by name; indeed, she found them so
entertaining that she took one or two back to her room, and they talked
to her while she was at supper; after which the Beast paid her his usual
visit, and asked her the same questions as before, and then with a gruff
“good-night” he took his departure, and Beauty went to bed to dream of
her mysterious Prince. The days passed swiftly in different amusements,
and after a while Beauty found out another strange thing in the palace,
which often pleased her when she was tired of being alone. There was one
room which she had not noticed particularly; it was empty, except that
under each of the windows stood a very comfortable chair; and the first
time she had looked out of the window it had seemed to her that a black
curtain prevented her from seeing anything outside. But the second time
she went into the room, happening to be tired, she sat down in one of
the chairs, when instantly the curtain was rolled aside, and a most
amusing pantomime was acted before her; there were dances, and colored
lights, and music, and pretty dresses, and it was all so gay that Beauty
was in ecstacies. After that she tried the other seven windows in turn,
and there was some new and surprising entertainment to be seen from each
of them, so that Beauty never could feel lonely any more. Every evening
after supper the Beast came to see her, and always before saying
good-night asked her in his terrible voice:

“Beauty, will you marry me?”

And it seemed to Beauty, now she understood him better, that when she
said, “No, Beast,” he went away quite sad. But her happy dreams of the
handsome young Prince soon made her forget the poor Beast, and the only
thing that at all disturbed her was to be constantly told to distrust
appearances, to let her heart guide her, and not her eyes, and many
other equally perplexing things, which, consider as she would, she could
not understand.

So everything went on for a long time, until at last, happy as she was,
Beauty began to long for the sight of her father and her brothers and
sisters; and one night, seeing her look very sad, the Beast asked her
what was the matter. Beauty had quite ceased to be afraid of him. Now
she knew that he was really gentle in spite of his ferocious looks and
his dreadful voice. So she answered that she was longing to see her
home once more. Upon hearing this the Beast seemed sadly distressed, and
cried miserably.

“Ah! Beauty, have you the heart to desert an unhappy Beast like this?
What more do you want to make you happy? Is it because you hate me that
you want to escape?”

“No, dear Beast,” answered Beauty softly, “I do not hate you, and I
should be very sorry never to see you any more, but I long to see my
father again. Only let me go for two months, and I promise to come back
to you and stay for the rest of my life.”

The Beast, who had been sighing dolefully while she spoke, now replied:

“I cannot refuse you anything you ask, even though it should cost me my
life. Take the four boxes you will find in the room next to your own,
and fill them with everything you wish to take with you. But remember
your promise and come back when the two months are over, or you may have
cause to repent it, for if you do not come in good time you will find
your faithful Beast dead. You will not need any chariot to bring you
back. Only say good-by to all your brothers and sisters the night before
you come away, and when you have gone to bed turn this ring round upon
your finger and say firmly: ‘I wish to go back to my palace and see my
Beast again.’ Good-night, Beauty. Fear nothing, sleep peacefully, and
before long you shall see your father once more.”

As soon as Beauty was alone she hastened to fill the boxes with all the
rare and precious things she saw about her, and only when she was tired
of heaping things into them did they seem to be full.

Then she went to bed, but could hardly sleep for joy. And when at last
she did begin to dream of her beloved Prince she was grieved to see him
stretched upon a grassy bank, sad and weary, and hardly like himself.

“What is the matter?” she cried.

He looked at her reproachfully, and said:

“How can you ask me, cruel one? Are you not leaving me to my death
perhaps?”

“Ah! don’t be so sorrowful,” cried Beauty; “I am only going to assure
my father that I am safe and happy. I have promised the Beast faithfully
that I will come back, and he would die of grief if I did not keep my
word!”

“What would that matter to you?” said the Prince “Surely you would not
care?”

“Indeed, I should be ungrateful if I did not care for such a kind
Beast,” cried Beauty indignantly. “I would die to save him from pain. I
assure you it is not his fault that he is so ugly.”

Just then a strange sound woke her--someone was speaking not very far
away; and opening her eyes she found herself in a room she had never
seen before, which was certainly not nearly so splendid as those she
was used to in the Beast’s palace. Where could she be? She got up and
dressed hastily, and then saw that the boxes she had packed the night
before were all in the room. While she was wondering by what magic
the Beast had transported them and herself to this strange place she
suddenly heard her father’s voice, and rushed out and greeted
him joyfully. Her brothers and sisters were all astonished at her
appearance, as they had never expected to see her again, and there was
no end to the questions they asked her. She had also much to hear
about what had happened to them while she was away, and of her father’s
journey home. But when they heard that she had only come to be with them
for a short time, and then must go back to the Beast’s palace for ever,
they lamented loudly. Then Beauty asked her father what he thought could
be the meaning of her strange dreams, and why the Prince constantly
begged her not to trust to appearances. After much consideration, he
answered: “You tell me yourself that the Beast, frightful as he
is, loves you dearly, and deserves your love and gratitude for his
gentleness and kindness; I think the Prince must mean you to understand
that you ought to reward him by doing as he wishes you to, in spite of
his ugliness.”

Beauty could not help seeing that this seemed very probable; still, when
she thought of her dear Prince who was so handsome, she did not feel at
all inclined to marry the Beast. At any rate, for two months she need
not decide, but could enjoy herself with her sisters. But though they
were rich now, and lived in town again, and had plenty of acquaintances,
Beauty found that nothing amused her very much; and she often thought of
the palace, where she was so happy, especially as at home she never once
dreamed of her dear Prince, and she felt quite sad without him.

Then her sisters seemed to have got quite used to being without her, and
even found her rather in the way, so she would not have been sorry when
the two months were over but for her father and brothers, who begged her
to stay, and seemed so grieved at the thought of her departure that she
had not the courage to say good-by to them. Every day when she got up
she meant to say it at night, and when night came she put it off again,
until at last she had a dismal dream which helped her to make up her
mind. She thought she was wandering in a lonely path in the palace
gardens, when she heard groans which seemed to come from some bushes
hiding the entrance of a cave, and running quickly to see what could be
the matter, she found the Beast stretched out upon his side, apparently
dying. He reproached her faintly with being the cause of his distress,
and at the same moment a stately lady appeared, and said very gravely:

“Ah! Beauty, you are only just in time to save his life. See what
happens when people do not keep their promises! If you had delayed one
day more, you would have found him dead.”

Beauty was so terrified by this dream that the next morning she
announced her intention of going back at once, and that very night she
said good-by to her father and all her brothers and sisters, and as soon
as she was in bed she turned her ring round upon her finger, and said
firmly, “I wish to go back to my palace and see my Beast again,” as she
had been told to do.

Then she fell asleep instantly, and only woke up to hear the clock
saying “Beauty, Beauty” twelve times in its musical voice, which told
her at once that she was really in the palace once more. Everything
was just as before, and her birds were so glad to see her! But Beauty
thought she had never known such a long day, for she was so anxious to
see the Beast again that she felt as if suppertime would never come.

But when it did come and no Beast appeared she was really frightened;
so, after listening and waiting for a long time, she ran down into the
garden to search for him. Up and down the paths and avenues ran poor
Beauty, calling him in vain, for no one answered, and not a trace of him
could she find; until at last, quite tired, she stopped for a minute’s
rest, and saw that she was standing opposite the shady path she had seen
in her dream. She rushed down it, and, sure enough, there was the cave,
and in it lay the Beast--asleep, as Beauty thought. Quite glad to have
found him, she ran up and stroked his head, but, to her horror, he did
not move or open his eyes.

“Oh! he is dead; and it is all my fault,” said Beauty, crying bitterly.

But then, looking at him again, she fancied he still breathed, and,
hastily fetching some water from the nearest fountain, she sprinkled it
over his face, and, to her great delight, he began to revive.

“Oh! Beast, how you frightened me!” she cried. “I never knew how much
I loved you until just now, when I feared I was too late to save your
life.”

“Can you really love such an ugly creature as I am?” said the Beast
faintly. “Ah! Beauty, you only came just in time. I was dying because
I thought you had forgotten your promise. But go back now and rest, I
shall see you again by and by.”

Beauty, who had half expected that he would be angry with her, was
reassured by his gentle voice, and went back to the palace, where supper
was awaiting her; and afterward the Beast came in as usual, and talked
about the time she had spent with her father, asking if she had enjoyed
herself, and if they had all been very glad to see her.

Beauty answered politely, and quite enjoyed telling him all that had
happened to her. And when at last the time came for him to go, and he
asked, as he had so often asked before, “Beauty, will you marry me?”

She answered softly, “Yes, dear Beast.”

As she spoke a blaze of light sprang up before the windows of the
palace; fireworks crackled and guns banged, and across the avenue of
orange trees, in letters all made of fire-flies, was written: “Long live
the Prince and his Bride.”

Turning to ask the Beast what it could all mean, Beauty found that he
had disappeared, and in his place stood her long-loved Prince! At the
same moment the wheels of a chariot were heard upon the terrace, and two
ladies entered the room. One of them Beauty recognized as the stately
lady she had seen in her dreams; the other was also so grand and queenly
that Beauty hardly knew which to greet first.

But the one she already knew said to her companion:

“Well, Queen, this is Beauty, who has had the courage to rescue your
son from the terrible enchantment. They love one another, and only your
consent to their marriage is wanting to make them perfectly happy.”

“I consent with all my heart,” cried the Queen. “How can I ever thank
you enough, charming girl, for having restored my dear son to his
natural form?”

And then she tenderly embraced Beauty and the Prince, who had meanwhile
been greeting the Fairy and receiving her congratulations.

“Now,” said the Fairy to Beauty, “I suppose you would like me to send
for all your brothers and sisters to dance at your wedding?”

And so she did, and the marriage was celebrated the very next day
with the utmost splendor, and Beauty and the Prince lived happily ever
after.


Once upon a time there was a king who had many sons. I do not exactly
know how many there were, but the youngest of them could not stay
quietly at home, and was determined to go out into the world and try his
luck, and after a long time the King was forced to give him leave to go.
When he had traveled about for several days, he came to a giant’s house,
and hired himself to the giant as a servant. In the morning the giant
had to go out to pasture his goats, and as he was leaving the house he
told the King’s son that he must clean out the stable. “And after you
have done that,” he said, “you need not do any more work to-day, for you
have come to a kind master, and that you shall find. But what I set you
to do must be done both well and thoroughly, and you must on no account
go into any of the rooms which lead out of the room in which you slept
last night. If you do, I will take your life.”

“Well to be sure, he is an easy master!” said the Prince to himself as
he walked up and down the room humming and singing, for he thought there
would be plenty of time left to clean out the stable; “but it would be
amusing to steal a glance into his other rooms as well,” thought the
Prince, “for there must be something that he is afraid of my seeing,
as I am not allowed to enter them.” So he went into the first room.
A cauldron was hanging from the walls; it was boiling, but the Prince
could see no fire under it. “I wonder what is inside it,” he thought,
and dipped a lock of his hair in, and the hair became just as if it were
all made of copper. “That’s a nice kind of soup. If anyone were to taste
that his throat would be gilded,” said the youth, and then he went into
the next chamber. There, too, a cauldron was hanging from the wall,
bubbling and boiling, but there was no fire under this either. “I will
just try what this is like too,” said the Prince, thrusting another lock
of his hair into it, and it came out silvered over. “Such costly soup is
not to be had in my father’s palace,” said the Prince; “but everything
depends on how it tastes,” and then he went into the third room. There,
too, a cauldron was hanging from the wall, boiling, exactly the same
as in the two other rooms, and the Prince took pleasure in trying this
also, so he dipped a lock of hair in, and it came out so brightly gilded
that it shone again. “Some talk about going from bad to worse,” said the
Prince; “but this is better and better. If he boils gold here, what can
he boil in there?” He was determined to see, and went through the door
into the fourth room. No cauldron was to be seen there, but on a bench
someone was seated who was like a king’s daughter, but, whosoever she
was, she was so beautiful that never in the Prince’s life had he seen
her equal.

“Oh! in heaven’s name what are you doing here?” said she who sat upon
the bench.

“I took the place of servant here yesterday,” said the Prince.

“May you soon have a better place, if you have come to serve here!” said
she.

“Oh, but I think I have got a kind master,” said the Prince. “He has not
given me hard work to do to-day. When I have cleaned out the stable I
shall be done.”

“Yes, but how will you be able to do that?” she asked again. “If you
clean it out as other people do, ten pitchforksful will come in for
every one you throw out. But I will teach you how to do it; you must
turn your pitchfork upside down, and work with the handle, and then all
will fly out of its own accord.”

“Yes, I will attend to that,” said the Prince, and stayed sitting where
he was the whole day, for it was soon settled between them that they
would marry each other, he and the King’s daughter; so the first day of
his service with the giant did not seem long to him. But when evening
was drawing near she said that it would now be better for him to clean
out the stable before the giant came home. When he got there he had a
fancy to try if what she had said were true, so he began to work in the
same way that he had seen the stable-boys doing in his father’s stables,
but he soon saw that he must give up that, for when he had worked a very
short time he had scarcely any room left to stand. So he did what the
Princess had taught him, turned the pitchfork round, and worked with the
handle, and in the twinkling of an eye the stable was as clean as if
it had been scoured. When he had done that, he went back again into the
room in which the giant had given him leave to stay, and there he walked
backward and forward on the floor, and began to hum and sing.

Then came the giant home with the goats. “Have you cleaned the stable?”
 asked the giant.

“Yes, now it is clean and sweet, master,” said the King’s son.

“I shall see about that,” said the giant, and went round to the stable,
but it was just as the Prince had said.

“You have certainly been talking to my Master-maid, for you never got
that out of your own head,” said the giant.

“Master-maid! What kind of a thing is that, master?” said the Prince,
making himself look as stupid as an ass; “I should like to see that.”

“Well, you will see her quite soon enough,” said the giant.

On the second morning the giant had again to go out with his goats,
so he told the Prince that on that day he was to fetch home his horse,
which was out on the mountain-side, and when he had done that he might
rest himself for the remainder of the day, “for you have come to a kind
master, and that you shall find,” said the giant once more. “But do not
go into any of the rooms that I spoke of yesterday, or I will wring your
head off,” said he, and then went away with his flock of goats.

“Yes, indeed, you are a kind master,” said the Prince; “but I will go
in and talk to the Master-maid again; perhaps before long she may like
better to be mine than yours.”

So he went to her. Then she asked him what he had to do that day.

“Oh! not very dangerous work, I fancy,” said the King’s son. “I have
only to go up the mountain-side after his horse.”

“Well, how do you mean to set about it?” asked the Master-maid.

“Oh! there is no great art in riding a horse home,” said the King’s son.
“I think I must have ridden friskier horses before now.”

“Yes, but it is not so easy a thing as you think to ride the horse
home,” said the Master-maid; “but I will teach you what to do. When you
go near it, fire will burst out of its nostrils like flames from a pine
torch; but be very careful, and take the bridle which is hanging by the
door there, and fling the bit straight into his jaws, and then it will
become so tame that you will be able to do what you like with it.” He
said he would bear this in mind, and then he again sat in there the
whole day by the Master-maid, and they chatted and talked of one thing
and another, but the first thing and the last now was, how happy and
delightful it would be if they could but marry each other, and get
safely away from the giant; and the Prince would have forgotten both the
mountain-side and the horse if the Master-maid had not reminded him of
them as evening drew near, and said that now it would be better if he
went to fetch the horse before the giant came. So he did this, and
took the bridle which was hanging on a crook, and strode up the
mountain-side, and it was not long before he met with the horse, and
fire and red flames streamed forth out of its nostrils. But the youth
carefully watched his opportunity, and just as it was rushing at him
with open jaws he threw the bit straight into its mouth, and the horse
stood as quiet as a young lamb, and there was no difficulty at all in
getting it home to the stable. Then the Prince went back into his room
again, and began to hum and to sing.

Toward evening the giant came home. “Have you fetched the horse back
from the mountain-side?” he asked.

“That I have, master; it was an amusing horse to ride, but I rode him
straight home, and put him in the stable too,” said the Prince.

“I will see about that,” said the giant, and went out to the stable,
but the horse was standing there just as the Prince had said. “You have
certainly been talking with my Master-maid, for you never got that out
of your own head,” said the giant again.

“Yesterday, master, you talked about this Master-maid, and to-day you
are talking about her; ah, heaven bless you, master, why will you not
show me the thing? for it would be a real pleasure to me to see it,”
 said the Prince, who again pretended to be silly and stupid.

“Oh! you will see her quite soon enough,” said the giant.

On the morning of the third day the giant again had to go into the wood
with the goats. “To-day you must go underground and fetch my taxes,”
 he said to the Prince. “When you have done this, you may rest for the
remainder of the day, for you shall see what an easy master you have
come to,” and then he went away.

“Well, however easy a master you may be, you set me very hard work
to do,” thought the Prince; “but I will see if I cannot find your
Master-maid; you say she is yours, but for all that she may be able
to tell me what to do now,” and he went back to her. So, when the
Master-maid asked him what the giant had set him to do that day, he told
her that he was to go underground and get the taxes.

“And how will you set about that?” said the Master-maid.

“Oh! you must tell me how to do it,” said the Prince, “for I have never
yet been underground, and even if I knew the way I do not know how much
I am to demand.”

“Oh! yes, I will soon tell you that; you must go to the rock there under
the mountain-ridge, and take the club that is there, and knock on the
rocky wall,” said the Master-maid. “Then someone will come out who will
sparkle with fire; you shall tell him your errand, and when he asks you
how much you want to have you are to say: ‘As much as I can carry.’”

“Yes, I will keep that in mind,” said he, and then he sat there with the
Master-maid the whole day, until night drew near, and he would gladly
have stayed there till now if the Master-maid had not reminded him that
it was time to be off to fetch the taxes before the giant came.

So he set out on his way, and did exactly what the Master-maid had told
him. He went to the rocky wall, and took the club, and knocked on it.
Then came one so full of sparks that they flew both out of his eyes and
his nose. “What do you want?” said he.

“I was to come here for the giant, and demand the tax for him,” said the
King’s son.

“How much are you to have then?” said the other.

“I ask for no more than I am able to carry with me,” said the Prince.

“It is well for you that you have not asked for a horse-load,” said he
who had come out of the rock. “But now come in with me.”

This the Prince did, and what a quantity of gold and silver he saw! It
was lying inside the mountain like heaps of stones in a waste place, and
he got a load that was as large as he was able to carry, and with that
he went his way. So in the evening, when the giant came home with the
goats, the Prince went into the chamber and hummed and sang again as he
had done on the other two evenings.

“Have you been for the tax?” said the giant.

“Yes, that I have, master,” said the Prince.

“Where have you put it then?” said the giant again.

“The bag of gold is standing there on the bench,” said the Prince.

“I will see about that,” said the giant, and went away to the bench,
but the bag was standing there, and it was so full that gold and silver
dropped out when the giant untied the string.

“You have certainly been talking with my Master-maid!” said the giant,
“and if you have I will wring your neck.”

“Master-maid?” said the Prince; “yesterday my master talked about this
Master-maid, and to-day he is talking about her again, and the first
day of all it was talk of the same kind. I do wish I could see the thing
myself,” said he.

“Yes, yes, wait till to-morrow,” said the giant, “and then I myself will
take you to her.”

“Ah! master, I thank you--but you are only mocking me,” said the King’s
son.

Next day the giant took him to the Master-maid. “Now you shall kill him,
and boil him in the great big cauldron you know of, and when you have
got the broth ready give me a call,” said the giant; then he lay down
on the bench to sleep, and almost immediately began to snore so that it
sounded like thunder among the hills.

So the Master-maid took a knife, and cut the Prince’s little finger, and
dropped three drops of blood upon a wooden stool; then she took all the
old rags, and shoe-soles, and all the rubbish she could lay hands on,
and put them in the cauldron; and then she filled a chest with gold
dust, and a lump of salt, and a water-flask which was hanging by the
door, and she also took with her a golden apple, and two gold chickens;
and then she and the Prince went away with all the speed they could,
and when they had gone a little way they came to the sea, and then
they sailed, but where they got the ship from I have never been able to
learn.

Now, when the giant had slept a good long time, he began to stretch
himself on the bench on which he was lying. “Will it soon boil?” said
he.

“It is just beginning,” said the first drop of blood on the stool.

So the giant lay down to sleep again, and slept for a long, long time.
Then he began to move about a little again. “Will it soon be ready now?”
 said he, but he did not look up this time any more than he had done the
first time, for he was still half asleep.

“Half done!” said the second drop of blood, and the giant believed it
was the Master-maid again, and turned himself on the bench, and lay down
to sleep once more. When he had slept again for many hours, he began to
move and stretch himself. “Is it not done yet?” said he.

“It is quite ready,” said the third drop of blood. Then the giant began
to sit up and rub his eyes, but he could not see who it was who had
spoken to him, so he asked for the Master-maid, and called her. But
there was no one to give him an answer.

“Ah! well, she has just stolen out for a little,” thought the giant, and
he took a spoon, and went off to the cauldron to have a taste; but there
was nothing in it but shoe-soles, and rags, and such trumpery as that,
and all was boiled up together, so that he could not tell whether it
was porridge or milk pottage. When he saw this, he understood what had
happened, and fell into such a rage that he hardly knew what he was
doing. Away he went after the Prince and the Master-maid so fast that
the wind whistled behind him, and it was not long before he came to the
water, but he could not get over it. “Well, well, I will soon find a
cure for that; I have only to call my river-sucker,” said the giant, and
he did call him. So his river-sucker came and lay down, and drank one,
two, three draughts, and with that the water in the sea fell so low that
the giant saw the Master-maid and the Prince out on the sea in their
ship. “Now you must throw out the lump of salt,” said the Master-maid,
and the Prince did so, and it grew up into such a great high mountain
right across the sea that the giant could not come over it, and the
river-sucker could not drink any more water. “Well, well, I will soon
find a cure for that,” said the giant, so he called to his hill-borer
to come and bore through the mountain so that the river-sucker might be
able to drink up the water again. But just as the hole was made, and the
river-sucker was beginning to drink, the Master-maid told the Prince to
throw one or two drops out of the flask, and when he did this the sea
instantly became full of water again, and before the river-sucker
could take one drink they reached the land and were in safety. So they
determined to go home to the Prince’s father, but the Prince would on no
account permit the Master-maid to walk there, for he thought that it was
unbecoming either for her or for him to go on foot.

“Wait here the least little bit of time, while I go home for the seven
horses which stand in my father’s stable,” said he; “it is not far off,
and I shall not be long away, but I will not let my betrothed bride go
on foot to the palace.”

“Oh! no, do not go, for if you go home to the King’s palace you will
forget me, I foresee that.”

“How could I forget you? We have suffered so much evil together, and
love each other so much,” said the Prince; and he insisted on going home
for the coach with the seven horses, and she was to wait for him there,
by the sea-shore. So at last the Master-maid had to yield, for he was
so absolutely determined to do it. “But when you get there you must
not even give yourself time to greet anyone, but go straight into the
stable, and take the horses, and put them in the coach, and drive back
as quickly as you can. For they will all come round about you; but you
must behave just as if you did not see them, and on no account must you
taste anything, for if you do it will cause great misery both to you and
to me,” said she; and this he promised.

But when he got home to the King’s palace one of his brothers was just
going to be married, and the bride and all her kith and kin had come
to the palace; so they all thronged round him, and questioned him about
this and that, and wanted him to go in with them; but he behaved as if
he did not see them, and went straight to the stable, and got out the
horses and began to harness them. When they saw that they could not by
any means prevail on him to go in with them, they came out to him with
meat and drink, and the best of everything that they had prepared for
the wedding; but the Prince refused to touch anything, and would do
nothing but put the horses in as quickly as he could. At last, however,
the bride’s sister rolled an apple across the yard to him, and said: “As
you won’t eat anything else, you may like to take a bite of that, for
you must be both hungry and thirsty after your long journey.” And he
took up the apple and bit a piece out of it. But no sooner had he got
the piece of apple in his mouth than he forgot the Master-maid and that
he was to go back in the coach to fetch her.

“I think I must be mad! what do I want with this coach and horses?” said
he; and then he put the horses back into the stable, and went into the
King’s palace, and there it was settled that he should marry the bride’s
sister, who had rolled the apple to him.

The Master-maid sat by the sea-shore for a long, long time, waiting
for the Prince, but no Prince came. So she went away, and when she had
walked a short distance she came to a little hut which stood all alone
in a small wood, hard by the King’s palace. She entered it and asked if
she might be allowed to stay there. The hut belonged to an old crone,
who was also an ill-tempered and malicious troll. At first she would not
let the Master-maid remain with her; but at last, after a long time, by
means of good words and good payment, she obtained leave. But the hut
was as dirty and black inside as a pigsty, so the Master-maid said that
she would smarten it up a little, that it might look a little more like
what other people’s houses looked inside. The old crone did not like
this either. She scowled, and was very cross, but the Master-maid did
not trouble herself about that. She took out her chest of gold, and
flung a handful of it or so into the fire, and the gold boiled up and
poured out over the whole of the hut, until every part of it both inside
and out was gilded. But when the gold began to bubble up the old hag
grew so terrified that she fled as if the Evil One himself were pursuing
her, and she did not remember to stoop down as she went through the
doorway, and so she split her head and died. Next morning the sheriff
came traveling by there. He was greatly astonished when he saw the gold
hut shining and glittering there in the copse, and he was still more
astonished when he went in and caught sight of the beautiful young
maiden who was sitting there; he fell in love with her at once, and
straightway on the spot he begged her, both prettily and kindly, to
marry him.

“Well, but have you a great deal of money?” said the Master-maid.

“Oh! yes; so far as that is concerned, I am not ill off,” said the
sheriff. So now he had to go home to get the money, and in the evening
he came back, bringing with him a bag with two bushels in it, which he
set down on the bench. Well, as he had such a fine lot of money, the
Master-maid said she would have him, so they sat down to talk.

But scarcely had they sat down together before the Master-maid wanted to
jump up again. “I have forgotten to see to the fire,” she said.

“Why should you jump up to do that?” said the sheriff; “I will do that!”
 So he jumped up, and went to the chimney in one bound.

“Just tell me when you have got hold of the shovel,” said the
Master-maid.

“Well, I have hold of it now,” said the sheriff.

“Then you may hold the shovel, and the shovel you, and pour red-hot
coals over you, till day dawns,” said the Master-maid. So the sheriff
had to stand there the whole night and pour red-hot coals over himself,
and, no matter how much he cried and begged and entreated, the red-hot
coals did not grow the colder for that. When the day began to dawn, and
he had power to throw down the shovel, he did not stay long where he
was, but ran away as fast as he possibly could; and everyone who met him
stared and looked after him, for he was flying as if he were mad, and he
could not have looked worse if he had been both flayed and tanned, and
everyone wondered where he had been, but for very shame he would tell
nothing.

The next day the attorney came riding by the place where the Master-maid
dwelt. He saw how brightly the hut shone and gleamed through the wood,
and he too went into it to see who lived there, and when he entered and
saw the beautiful young maiden he fell even more in love with her than
the sheriff had done, and began to woo her at once. So the Master-maid
asked him, as she had asked the sheriff, if he had a great deal of
money, and the attorney said he was not ill off for that, and would at
once go home to get it; and at night he came with a great big sack of
money--this time it was a four-bushel sack--and set it on the bench by
the Master-maid. So she promised to have him, and he sat down on the
bench by her to arrange about it, but suddenly she said that she had
forgotten to lock the door of the porch that night, and must do it.

“Why should you do that?” said the attorney; “sit still, I will do it.”

So he was on his feet in a moment, and out in the porch.

“Tell me when you have got hold of the door-latch,” said the
Master-maid.

“I have hold of it now,” cried the attorney.

“Then you may hold the door, and the door you, and may you go between
wall and wall till day dawns.”

What a dance the attorney had that night! He had never had such a waltz
before, and he never wished to have such a dance again. Sometimes he was
in front of the door, and sometimes the door was in front of him, and
it went from one side of the porch to the other, till the attorney was
well-nigh beaten to death. At first he began to abuse the Master-maid,
and then to beg and pray, but the door did not care for anything but
keeping him where he was till break of day.

As soon as the door let go its hold of him, off went the attorney. He
forgot who ought to be paid off for what he had suffered, he forgot
both his sack of money and his wooing, for he was so afraid lest the
house-door should come dancing after him. Everyone who met him stared
and looked after him, for he was flying like a madman, and he could not
have looked worse if a herd of rams had been butting at him all night
long.

On the third day the bailiff came by, and he too saw the gold house
in the little wood, and he too felt that he must go and see who lived
there; and when he caught sight of the Master-maid he became so much in
love with her that he wooed her almost before he greeted her.

The Master-maid answered him as she had answered the other two, that
if he had a great deal of money, she would have him. “So far as that is
concerned, I am not ill off,” said the bailiff; so he was at once told
to go home and fetch it, and this he did. At night he came back, and he
had a still larger sack of money with him than the attorney had brought;
it must have been at least six bushels, and he set it down on the bench.
So it was settled that he was to have the Master-maid. But hardly had
they sat down together before she said that she had forgotten to bring
in the calf, and must go out to put it in the byre.

“No, indeed, you shall not do that,” said the bailiff; “I am the one to
do that.” And, big and fat as he was, he went out as briskly as a boy.

“Tell me when you have got hold of the calf’s tail,” said the
Master-maid.

“I have hold of it now,” cried the bailiff.

“Then may you hold the calf’s tail, and the calf’s tail hold you,
and may you go round the world together till day dawns!” said the
Master-maid. So the bailiff had to bestir himself, for the calf went
over rough and smooth, over hill and dale, and, the more the bailiff
cried and screamed, the faster the calf went. When daylight began to
appear, the bailiff was half dead; and so glad was he to leave loose
of the calf’s tail, that he forgot the sack of money and all else. He
walked now slowly--more slowly than the sheriff and the attorney had
done, but, the slower he went, the more time had everyone to stare and
look at him; and they used it too, and no one can imagine how tired out
and ragged he looked after his dance with the calf.

On the following day the wedding was to take place in the King’s palace,
and the elder brother was to drive to church with his bride, and the
brother who had been with the giant with her sister. But when they had
seated themselves in the coach and were about to drive off from the
palace one of the trace-pins broke, and, though they made one, two, and
three to put in its place, that did not help them, for each broke in
turn, no matter what kind of wood they used to make them of. This went
on for a long time, and they could not get away from the palace, so they
were all in great trouble. Then the sheriff said (for he too had been
bidden to the wedding at Court): “Yonder away in the thicket dwells a
maiden, and if you can get her to lend you the handle of the shovel that
she uses to make up her fire I know very well that it will hold fast.”
 So they sent off a messenger to the thicket, and begged so prettily that
they might have the loan of her shovel-handle of which the sheriff had
spoken that they were not refused; so now they had a trace-pin which
would not snap in two.

But all at once, just as they were starting, the bottom of the coach
fell in pieces. They made a new bottom as fast as they could, but, no
matter how they nailed it together, or what kind of wood they used,
no sooner had they got the new bottom into the coach and were about to
drive off than it broke again, so that they were still worse off than
when they had broken the trace-pin. Then the attorney said, for he too
was at the wedding in the palace: “Away there in the thicket dwells
a maiden, and if you could but get her to lend you one-half of her
porch-door I am certain that it will hold together.” So they again sent
a messenger to the thicket, and begged so prettily for the loan of the
gilded porch-door of which the attorney had told them that they got it
at once. They were just setting out again, but now the horses were not
able to draw the coach. They had six horses already, and now they put in
eight, and then ten, and then twelve, but the more they put in, and
the more the coachman whipped them, the less good it did; and the coach
never stirred from the spot. It was already beginning to be late in the
day, and to church they must and would go, so everyone who was in the
palace was in a state of distress. Then the bailiff spoke up and said:
“Out there in the gilded cottage in the thicket dwells a girl, and if
you could but get her to lend you her calf I know it could draw the
coach, even if it were as heavy as a mountain.” They all thought that
it was ridiculous to be drawn to church by a calf, but there was nothing
else for it but to send a messenger once more, and beg as prettily as
they could, on behalf of the King, that she would let them have the loan
of the calf that the bailiff had told them about. The Master-maid let
them have it immediately--this time also she would not say “no.”

Then they harnessed the calf to see if the coach would move; and away
it went, over rough and smooth, over stock and stone, so that they could
scarcely breathe, and sometimes they were on the ground, and sometimes
up in the air; and when they came to the church the coach began to
go round and round like a spinning-wheel, and it was with the utmost
difficulty and danger that they were able to get out of the coach and
into the church. And when they went back again the coach went quicker
still, so that most of them did not know how they got back to the palace
at all.

When they had seated themselves at the table the Prince who had been in
service with the giant said that he thought they ought to have invited
the maiden who had lent them the shovel-handle, and the porch-door,
and the calf up to the palace, “for,” said he, “if we had not got these
three things, we should never have got away from the palace.”

The King also thought that this was both just and proper, so he sent
five of his best men down to the gilded hut, to greet the maiden
courteously from the King, and to beg her to be so good as to come up to
the palace to dinner at mid-day.

“Greet the King, and tell him that, if he is too good to come to me, I
am too good to come to him,” replied the Master-maid.

So the King had to go himself, and the Master-maid went with him
immediately, and, as the King believed that she was more than she
appeared to be, he seated her in the place of honor by the youngest
bridegroom. When they had sat at the table for a short time, the
Master-maid took out the cock, and the hen, and the golden apple which
she had brought away with her from the giant’s house, and set them on
the table in front of her, and instantly the cock and the hen began to
fight with each other for the golden apple.

“Oh! look how those two there are fighting for the golden apple,” said
the King’s son.

“Yes, and so did we two fight to get out that time when we were in the
mountain,” said the Master-maid.

So the Prince knew her again, and you may imagine how delighted he was.
He ordered the troll-witch who had rolled the apple to him to be torn
in pieces between four-and-twenty horses, so that not a bit of her was
left, and then for the first time they began really to keep the wedding,
and, weary as they were, the sheriff, the attorney, and the bailiff kept
it up too.



Once upon a time, long, long ago, there were two brothers, the one rich
and the other poor. When Christmas Eve came, the poor one had not a bite
in the house, either of meat or bread; so he went to his brother, and
begged him, in God’s name, to give him something for Christmas Day. It
was by no means the first time that the brother had been forced to give
something to him, and he was not better pleased at being asked now than
he generally was.

“If you will do what I ask you, you shall have a whole ham,” said he.
The poor one immediately thanked him, and promised this.

“Well, here is the ham, and now you must go straight to Dead Man’s
Hall,” said the rich brother, throwing the ham to him.

“Well, I will do what I have promised,” said the other, and he took
the ham and set off. He went on and on for the livelong day, and at
nightfall he came to a place where there was a bright light.

“I have no doubt this is the place,” thought the man with the ham.

An old man with a long white beard was standing in the outhouse,
chopping Yule logs.

“Good-evening,” said the man with the ham.

“Good-evening to you. Where are you going at this late hour?” said the
man.

“I am going to Dead Man’s Hall, if only I am on the right track,”
 answered the poor man.

“Oh! yes, you are right enough, for it is here,” said the old man. “When
you get inside they will all want to buy your ham, for they don’t get
much meat to eat there; but you must not sell it unless you can get the
hand-mill which stands behind the door for it. When you come out again
I will teach you how to stop the hand-mill, which is useful for almost
everything.”

So the man with the ham thanked the other for his good advice, and
rapped at the door.

When he got in, everything happened just as the old man had said it
would: all the people, great and small, came round him like ants on an
ant-hill, and each tried to outbid the other for the ham.

“By rights my old woman and I ought to have it for our Christmas dinner,
but, since you have set your hearts upon it, I must just give it up to
you,” said the man. “But, if I sell it, I will have the hand-mill which
is standing there behind the door.”

At first they would not hear of this, and haggled and bargained with
the man, but he stuck to what he had said, and the people were forced
to give him the hand-mill. When the man came out again into the yard, he
asked the old wood-cutter how he was to stop the hand-mill, and when he
had learned that, he thanked him and set off home with all the speed he
could, but did not get there until after the clock had struck twelve on
Christmas Eve.

“Where in the world have you been?” said the old woman. “Here I have sat
waiting hour after hour, and have not even two sticks to lay across each
other under the Christmas porridge-pot.”

“Oh! I could not come before; I had something of importance to see
about, and a long way to go, too; but now you shall just see!” said the
man, and then he set the hand-mill on the table, and bade it first grind
light, then a table-cloth, and then meat, and beer, and everything else
that was good for a Christmas Eve’s supper; and the mill ground all that
he ordered. “Bless me!” said the old woman as one thing after another
appeared; and she wanted to know where her husband had got the mill
from, but he would not tell her that.

“Never mind where I got it; you can see that it is a good one, and the
water that turns it will never freeze,” said the man. So he ground meat
and drink, and all kinds of good things, to last all Christmas-tide, and
on the third day he invited all his friends to come to a feast.

Now when the rich brother saw all that there was at the banquet and in
the house, he was both vexed and angry, for he grudged everything his
brother had. “On Christmas Eve he was so poor that he came to me and
begged for a trifle, for God’s sake, and now he gives a feast as if he
were both a count and a king!” thought he. “But, for heaven’s sake, tell
me where you got your riches from,” said he to his brother.

“From behind the door,” said he who owned the mill, for he did not
choose to satisfy his brother on that point; but later in the evening,
when he had taken a drop too much, he could not refrain from telling how
he had come by the hand-mill. “There you see what has brought me all my
wealth!” said he, and brought out the mill, and made it grind first one
thing and then another. When the brother saw that, he insisted on having
the mill, and after a great deal of persuasion got it; but he had to
give three hundred dollars for it, and the poor brother was to keep it
till the haymaking was over, for he thought: “If I keep it as long as
that, I can make it grind meat and drink that will last many a long
year.” During that time you may imagine that the mill did not grow
rusty, and when hay-harvest came the rich brother got it, but the other
had taken good care not to teach him how to stop it. It was evening when
the rich man got the mill home, and in the morning he bade the old woman
go out and spread the hay after the mowers, and he would attend to the
house himself that day, he said.

So, when dinner-time drew near, he set the mill on the kitchen-table,
and said: “Grind herrings and milk pottage, and do it both quickly and
well.”

So the mill began to grind herrings and milk pottage, and first all
the dishes and tubs were filled, and then it came out all over the
kitchen-floor. The man twisted and turned it, and did all he could to
make the mill stop, but, howsoever he turned it and screwed it, the mill
went on grinding, and in a short time the pottage rose so high that the
man was like to be drowned. So he threw open the parlor door, but it was
not long before the mill had ground the parlor full too, and it was
with difficulty and danger that the man could go through the stream of
pottage and get hold of the door-latch. When he got the door open, he
did not stay long in the room, but ran out, and the herrings and pottage
came after him, and it streamed out over both farm and field. Now the
old woman, who was out spreading the hay, began to think dinner was long
in coming, and said to the women and the mowers: “Though the master does
not call us home, we may as well go. It may be that he finds he is not
good at making pottage and I should do well to help him.” So they began
to straggle homeward, but when they had got a little way up the hill
they met the herrings and pottage and bread, all pouring forth and
winding about one over the other, and the man himself in front of the
flood. “Would to heaven that each of you had a hundred stomachs! Take
care that you are not drowned in the pottage!” he cried as he went by
them as if Mischief were at his heels, down to where his brother dwelt.
Then he begged him, for God’s sake, to take the mill back again, and
that in an instant, for, said he: “If it grind one hour more the whole
district will be destroyed by herrings and pottage.” But the brother
would not take it until the other paid him three hundred dollars, and
that he was obliged to do. Now the poor brother had both the money and
the mill again. So it was not long before he had a farmhouse much finer
than that in which his brother lived, but the mill ground him so much
money that he covered it with plates of gold; and the farmhouse lay
close by the sea-shore, so it shone and glittered far out to sea.
Everyone who sailed by there now had to be put in to visit the rich man
in the gold farmhouse, and everyone wanted to see the wonderful mill,
for the report of it spread far and wide, and there was no one who had
not heard tell of it.

After a long, long time came also a skipper who wished to see the mill.
He asked if it could make salt. “Yes, it could make salt,” said he who
owned it, and when the skipper heard that, he wished with all his might
and main to have the mill, let it cost what it might, for, he thought,
if he had it, he would get off having to sail far away over the perilous
sea for freights of salt. At first the man would not hear of parting
with it, but the skipper begged and prayed, and at last the man sold it
to him, and got many, many thousand dollars for it. When the skipper
had got the mill on his back he did not stay there long, for he was so
afraid that the man would change his mind, and he had no time to ask
how he was to stop it grinding, but got on board his ship as fast as he
could.

When he had gone a little way out to sea he took the mill on deck.
“Grind salt, and grind both quickly and well,” said the skipper. So the
mill began to grind salt, till it spouted out like water, and when
the skipper had got the ship filled he wanted to stop the mill, but
whichsoever way he turned it, and how much soever he tried, it went on
grinding, and the heap of salt grew higher and higher, until at last the
ship sank. There lies the mill at the bottom of the sea, and still, day
by day, it grinds on; and that is why the sea is salt.



There was a miller who left no more estate to the three sons he had than
his mill, his ass, and his cat. The partition was soon made. Neither
scrivener nor attorney was sent for. They would soon have eaten up all
the poor patrimony. The eldest had the mill, the second the ass, and
the youngest nothing but the cat. The poor young fellow was quite
comfortless at having so poor a lot.

“My brothers,” said he, “may get their living handsomely enough by
joining their stocks together; but for my part, when I have eaten up my
cat, and made me a muff of his skin, I must die of hunger.”

The Cat, who heard all this, but made as if he did not, said to him with
a grave and serious air:

“Do not thus afflict yourself, my good master. You have nothing else to
do but to give me a bag and get a pair of boots made for me that I may
scamper through the dirt and the brambles, and you shall see that you
have not so bad a portion in me as you imagine.”

The Cat’s master did not build very much upon what he said. He had often
seen him play a great many cunning tricks to catch rats and mice, as
when he used to hang by the heels, or hide himself in the meal, and
make as if he were dead; so that he did not altogether despair of his
affording him some help in his miserable condition. When the Cat had
what he asked for he booted himself very gallantly, and putting his bag
about his neck, he held the strings of it in his two forepaws and went
into a warren where was great abundance of rabbits. He put bran and
sow-thistle into his bag, and stretching out at length, as if he had
been dead, he waited for some young rabbits, not yet acquainted with the
deceits of the world, to come and rummage his bag for what he had put
into it.

Scarce was he lain down but he had what he wanted. A rash and foolish
young rabbit jumped into his bag, and Monsieur Puss, immediately drawing
close the strings, took and killed him without pity. Proud of his prey,
he went with it to the palace and asked to speak with his majesty.
He was shown upstairs into the King’s apartment, and, making a low
reverence, said to him:

“I have brought you, sir, a rabbit of the warren, which my noble lord
the Marquis of Carabas” (for that was the title which puss was pleased
to give his master) “has commanded me to present to your majesty from
him.”

“Tell thy master,” said the king, “that I thank him and that he does me
a great deal of pleasure.”

Another time he went and hid himself among some standing corn, holding
still his bag open, and when a brace of partridges ran into it he drew
the strings and so caught them both. He went and made a present of these
to the king, as he had done before of the rabbit which he took in the
warren. The king, in like manner, received the partridges with great
pleasure, and ordered him some money for drink.

The Cat continued for two or three months thus to carry his Majesty,
from time to time, game of his master’s taking. One day in particular,
when he knew for certain that he was to take the air along the
river-side, with his daughter, the most beautiful princess in the world,
he said to his master:

“If you will follow my advice your fortune is made. You have nothing
else to do but go and wash yourself in the river, in that part I shall
show you, and leave the rest to me.”

The Marquis of Carabas did what the Cat advised him to, without knowing
why or wherefore. While he was washing the King passed by, and the Cat
began to cry out:

“Help! help! My Lord Marquis of Carabas is going to be drowned.”

At this noise the King put his head out of the coach-window, and,
finding it was the Cat who had so often brought him such good game,
he commanded his guards to run immediately to the assistance of his
Lordship the Marquis of Carabas. While they were drawing the poor
Marquis out of the river, the Cat came up to the coach and told the King
that, while his master was washing, there came by some rogues, who
went off with his clothes, though he had cried out: “Thieves! thieves!”
 several times, as loud as he could.

This cunning Cat had hidden them under a great stone. The King
immediately commanded the officers of his wardrobe to run and fetch one
of his best suits for the Lord Marquis of Carabas.

The King caressed him after a very extraordinary manner, and as the fine
clothes he had given him extremely set off his good mien (for he was
well made and very handsome in his person), the King’s daughter took a
secret inclination to him, and the Marquis of Carabas had no sooner cast
two or three respectful and somewhat tender glances but she fell in love
with him to distraction. The King would needs have him come into the
coach and take part of the airing. The Cat, quite overjoyed to see his
project begin to succeed, marched on before, and, meeting with some
countrymen, who were mowing a meadow, he said to them:

“Good people, you who are mowing, if you do not tell the King that
the meadow you mow belongs to my Lord Marquis of Carabas, you shall be
chopped as small as herbs for the pot.”

The King did not fail asking of the mowers to whom the meadow they were
mowing belonged.

“To my Lord Marquis of Carabas,” answered they altogether, for the Cat’s
threats had made them terribly afraid.

“You see, sir,” said the Marquis, “this is a meadow which never fails to
yield a plentiful harvest every year.”

The Master Cat, who went still on before, met with some reapers, and
said to them:

“Good people, you who are reaping, if you do not tell the King that all
this corn belongs to the Marquis of Carabas, you shall be chopped as
small as herbs for the pot.”

The King, who passed by a moment after, would needs know to whom all
that corn, which he then saw, did belong.

“To my Lord Marquis of Carabas,” replied the reapers, and the King was
very well pleased with it, as well as the Marquis, whom he congratulated
thereupon. The Master Cat, who went always before, said the same words
to all he met, and the King was astonished at the vast estates of my
Lord Marquis of Carabas.

Monsieur Puss came at last to a stately castle, the master of which was
an ogre, the richest had ever been known; for all the lands which the
King had then gone over belonged to this castle. The Cat, who had taken
care to inform himself who this ogre was and what he could do, asked
to speak with him, saying he could not pass so near his castle without
having the honor of paying his respects to him.

The ogre received him as civilly as an ogre could do, and made him sit
down.

“I have been assured,” said the Cat, “that you have the gift of being
able to change yourself into all sorts of creatures you have a mind to;
you can, for example, transform yourself into a lion, or elephant, and
the like.”

“That is true,” answered the ogre very briskly; “and to convince you,
you shall see me now become a lion.”

Puss was so sadly terrified at the sight of a lion so near him that he
immediately got into the gutter, not without abundance of trouble and
danger, because of his boots, which were of no use at all to him in
walking upon the tiles. A little while after, when Puss saw that the
ogre had resumed his natural form, he came down, and owned he had been
very much frightened.

“I have been, moreover, informed,” said the Cat, “but I know not how to
believe it, that you have also the power to take on you the shape of the
smallest animals; for example, to change yourself into a rat or a mouse;
but I must own to you I take this to be impossible.”

“Impossible!” cried the ogre; “you shall see that presently.”

And at the same time he changed himself into a mouse, and began to run
about the floor. Puss no sooner perceived this but he fell upon him and
ate him up.

Meanwhile the King, who saw, as he passed, this fine castle of the
ogre’s, had a mind to go into it. Puss, who heard the noise of his
Majesty’s coach running over the draw-bridge, ran out, and said to the
King:

“Your Majesty is welcome to this castle of my Lord Marquis of Carabas.”

“What! my Lord Marquis,” cried the King, “and does this castle also
belong to you? There can be nothing finer than this court and all the
stately buildings which surround it; let us go into it, if you please.”

The Marquis gave his hand to the Princess, and followed the King,
who went first. They passed into a spacious hall, where they found a
magnificent collation, which the ogre had prepared for his friends, who
were that very day to visit him, but dared not to enter, knowing
the King was there. His Majesty was perfectly charmed with the good
qualities of my Lord Marquis of Carabas, as was his daughter, who
had fallen violently in love with him, and, seeing the vast estate he
possessed, said to him, after having drunk five or six glasses:

“It will be owing to yourself only, my Lord Marquis, if you are not my
son-in-law.”

The Marquis, making several low bows, accepted the honor which his
Majesty conferred upon him, and forthwith, that very same day, married
the Princess.

Puss became a great lord, and never ran after mice any more but only for
his diversion.


Once upon a time there was a poor laborer who, feeling that he had not
much longer to live, wished to divide his possessions between his son
and daughter, whom he loved dearly.

So he called them to him, and said: “Your mother brought me as her dowry
two stools and a straw bed; I have, besides, a hen, a pot of pinks, and
a silver ring, which were given me by a noble lady who once lodged in my
poor cottage. When she went away she said to me:

“‘Be careful of my gifts, good man; see that you do not lose the ring or
forget to water the pinks. As for your daughter, I promise you that she
shall be more beautiful than anyone you ever saw in your life; call her
Felicia, and when she grows up give her the ring and the pot of pinks to
console her for her poverty.’ Take them both, then, my dear child,” he
added, “and your brother shall have everything else.”

The two children seemed quite contented, and when their father died they
wept for him, and divided his possessions as he had told them. Felicia
believed that her brother loved her, but when she sat down upon one of
the stools he said angrily:

“Keep your pot of pinks and your ring, but let my things alone. I like
order in my house.”

Felicia, who was very gentle, said nothing, but stood up crying quietly;
while Bruno, for that was her brother’s name, sat comfortably by the
fire. Presently, when supper-time came, Bruno had a delicious egg, and
he threw the shell to Felicia, saying:

“There, that is all I can give you; if you don’t like it, go out and
catch frogs; there are plenty of them in the marsh close by.” Felicia
did not answer, but she cried more bitterly than ever, and went away
to her own little room. She found it filled with the sweet scent of the
pinks, and, going up to them, she said sadly:

“Beautiful pinks, you are so sweet and so pretty, you are the only
comfort I have left. Be very sure that I will take care of you, and
water you well, and never allow any cruel hand to tear you from your
stems.”

As she leaned over them she noticed that they were very dry. So taking
her pitcher, she ran off in the clear moonlight to the fountain, which
was at some distance. When she reached it she sat down upon the brink
to rest, but she had hardly done so when she saw a stately lady coming
toward her, surrounded by numbers of attendants. Six maids of honor
carried her train, and she leaned upon the arm of another.

When they came near the fountain a canopy was spread for her, under
which was placed a sofa of cloth-of-gold, and presently a dainty supper
was served, upon a table covered with dishes of gold and crystal, while
the wind in the trees and the falling water of the fountain murmured the
softest music.

Felicia was hidden in the shade, too much astonished by all she saw to
venture to move; but in a few moments the Queen said:

“I fancy I see a shepherdess near that tree; bid her come hither.”

So Felicia came forward and saluted the Queen timidly, but with so much
grace that all were surprised.

“What are you doing here, my pretty child?” asked the Queen. “Are you
not afraid of robbers?”

“Ah! madam,” said Felicia, “a poor shepherdess who has nothing to lose
does not fear robbers.”

“You are not very rich, then?” said the Queen, smiling.

“I am so poor,” answered Felicia, “that a pot of pinks and a silver ring
are my only possessions in the world.”

“But you have a heart,” said the Queen. “What should you say if anybody
wanted to steal that?”

“I do not know what it is like to lose one’s heart, madam,” she replied;
“but I have always heard that without a heart one cannot live, and if it
is broken one must die; and in spite of my poverty I should be sorry not
to live.”

“You are quite right to take care of your heart, pretty one,” said the
Queen. “But tell me, have you supped?”

“No, madam,” answered Felicia; “my brother ate all the supper there
was.”

Then the Queen ordered that a place should be made for her at the table,
and herself loaded Felicia’s plate with good things; but she was too
much astonished to be hungry.

“I want to know what you were doing at the fountain so late?” said the
Queen presently.

“I came to fetch a pitcher of water for my pinks, madam,” she answered,
stooping to pick up the pitcher which stood beside her; but when she
showed it to the Queen she was amazed to see that it had turned to gold,
all sparkling with great diamonds, and the water, of which it was full,
was more fragrant than the sweetest roses. She was afraid to take it
until the Queen said:

“It is yours, Felicia; go and water your pinks with it, and let it
remind you that the Queen of the Woods is your friend.”

The shepherdess threw herself at the Queen’s feet, and thanked her
humbly for her gracious words.

“Ah! madam,” she cried, “if I might beg you to stay here a moment I
would run and fetch my pot of pinks for you--they could not fall into
better hands.”

“Go, Felicia,” said the Queen, stroking her cheek softly; “I will wait
here until you come back.”

So Felicia took up her pitcher and ran to her little room, but while she
had been away Bruno had gone in and taken the pot of pinks, leaving a
great cabbage in its place. When she saw the unlucky cabbage Felicia was
much distressed, and did not know what to do; but at last she ran back
to the fountain, and, kneeling before the Queen, said:

“Madam, Bruno has stolen my pot of pinks, so I have nothing but my
silver ring; but I beg you to accept it as a proof of my gratitude.”

“But if I take your ring, my pretty shepherdess,” said the Queen, “you
will have nothing left; and what will you do then?”

“Ah! madam,” she answered simply, “if I have your friendship I shall do
very well.”

So the Queen took the ring and put it on her finger, and mounted her
chariot, which was made of coral studded with emeralds, and drawn by six
milk-white horses. And Felicia looked after her until the winding of
the forest path hid her from her sight, and then she went back to the
cottage, thinking over all the wonderful things that had happened.

The first thing she did when she reached her room was to throw the
cabbage out of the window.

But she was very much surprised to hear an odd little voice cry out:
“Oh! I am half killed!” and could not tell where it came from, because
cabbages do not generally speak.

As soon as it was light, Felicia, who was very unhappy about her pot of
pinks, went out to look for it, and the first thing she found was the
unfortunate cabbage. She gave it a push with her foot, saying: “What are
you doing here, and how dared you put yourself in the place of my pot of
pinks?”

“If I hadn’t been carried,” replied the cabbage, “you may be very sure
that I shouldn’t have thought of going there.”

It made her shiver with fright to hear the cabbage talk, but he went on:

“If you will be good enough to plant me by my comrades again, I can tell
you where your pinks are at this moment--hidden in Bruno’s bed!”

Felicia was in despair when she heard this, not knowing how she was
to get them back. But she replanted the cabbage very kindly in his old
place, and, as she finished doing it, she saw Bruno’s hen, and said,
catching hold of it:

“Come here, horrid little creature! you shall suffer for all the unkind
things my brother has done to me.”

“Ah! shepherdess,” said the hen, “don’t kill me; I am rather a gossip,
and I can tell you some surprising things that you will like to hear.
Don’t imagine that you are the daughter of the poor laborer who brought
you up; your mother was a queen who had six girls already, and the King
threatened that unless she had a son who could inherit his kingdom she
should have her head cut off.

“So when the Queen had another little daughter she was quite frightened,
and agreed with her sister (who was a fairy) to exchange her for the
fairy’s little son. Now the Queen had been shut up in a great tower
by the King’s orders, and when a great many days went by and still she
heard nothing from the Fairy she made her escape from the window by
means of a rope ladder, taking her little baby with her. After wandering
about until she was half dead with cold and fatigue she reached this
cottage. I was the laborer’s wife, and was a good nurse, and the Queen
gave you into my charge, and told me all her misfortunes, and then died
before she had time to say what was to become of you.

“As I never in all my life could keep a secret, I could not help telling
this strange tale to my neighbors, and one day a beautiful lady came
here, and I told it to her also. When I had finished she touched me with
a wand she held in her hand, and instantly I became a hen, and there was
an end of my talking! I was very sad, and my husband, who was out
when it happened, never knew what had become of me. After seeking me
everywhere he believed that I must have been drowned, or eaten up by
wild beasts in the forest. That same lady came here once more, and
commanded that you should be called Felicia, and left the ring and
the pot of pinks to be given to you; and while she was in the house
twenty-five of the King’s guards came to search for you, doubtless
meaning to kill you; but she muttered a few words, and immediately they
all turned into cabbages. It was one of them whom you threw out of your
window yesterday.

“I don’t know how it was that he could speak--I have never heard either
of them say a word before, nor have I been able to do it myself until
now.”

The Princess was greatly astonished at the hen’s story, and said kindly:
“I am truly sorry for you, my poor nurse, and wish it was in my power to
restore you to your real form. But we must not despair; it seems to
me, after what you have told me, that something must be going to happen
soon. Just now, however, I must go and look for my pinks, which I love
better than anything in the world.”

Bruno had gone out into the forest, never thinking that Felicia
would search in his room for the pinks, and she was delighted by
his unexpected absence, and thought to get them back without further
trouble. But as soon as she entered the room she saw a terrible army
of rats, who were guarding the straw bed; and when she attempted to
approach it they sprang at her, biting and scratching furiously. Quite
terrified, she drew back, crying out: “Oh! my dear pinks, how can you
stay here in such bad company?”

Then she suddenly bethought herself of the pitcher of water, and, hoping
that it might have some magic power, she ran to fetch it, and sprinkled
a few drops over the fierce-looking swarm of rats. In a moment not a
tail or a whisker was to be seen. Each one had made for his hole as fast
as his legs could carry him, so that the Princess could safely take her
pot of pinks. She found them nearly dying for want of water, and hastily
poured all that was left in the pitcher upon them. As she bent over
them, enjoying their delicious scent, a soft voice, that seemed to
rustle among the leaves, said:

“Lovely Felicia, the day has come at last when I may have the happiness
of telling you how even the flowers love you and rejoice in your
beauty.”

The Princess, quite overcome by the strangeness of hearing a cabbage,
a hen, and a pink speak, and by the terrible sight of an army of rats,
suddenly became very pale, and fainted away.

At this moment in came Bruno. Working hard in the heat had not improved
his temper, and when he saw that Felicia had succeeded in finding her
pinks he was so angry that he dragged her out into the garden and shut
the door upon her. The fresh air soon made her open her pretty eyes, and
there before her stood the Queen of the Woods, looking as charming as
ever.

“You have a bad brother,” she said; “I saw he turned you out. Shall I
punish him for it?”

“Ah! no, madam,” she said; “I am not angry with him.

“But supposing he was not your brother, after all, what would you say
then?” asked the Queen.

“Oh! but I think he must be,” said Felicia.

“What!” said the Queen, “have you not heard that you are a Princess?”

“I was told so a little while ago, madam, but how could I believe it
without a single proof?”

“Ah! dear child,” said the Queen, “the way you speak assures me that, in
spite of your humble upbringing, you are indeed a real princess, and I
can save you from being treated in such a way again.”

She was interrupted at this moment by the arrival of a very handsome
young man. He wore a coat of green velvet fastened with emerald clasps,
and had a crown of pinks on his head. He knelt upon one knee and kissed
the Queen’s hand.

“Ah!” she cried, “my pink, my dear son, what a happiness to see you
restored to your natural shape by Felicia’s aid!” And she embraced him
joyfully. Then, turning to Felicia, she said:

“Charming Princess, I know all the hen told you, but you cannot have
heard that the zephyrs, to whom was entrusted the task of carrying my
son to the tower where the Queen, your mother, so anxiously waited for
him, left him instead in a garden of flowers, while they flew off to
tell your mother. Whereupon a fairy with whom I had quarrelled changed
him into a pink, and I could do nothing to prevent it.

“You can imagine how angry I was, and how I tried to find some means of
undoing the mischief she had done; but there was no help for it. I could
only bring Prince Pink to the place where you were being brought up,
hoping that when you grew up he might love you, and by your care be
restored to his natural form. And you see everything has come right, as
I hoped it would. Your giving me the silver ring was the sign that the
power of the charm was nearly over, and my enemy’s last chance was to
frighten you with her army of rats. That she did not succeed in doing;
so now, my dear Felicia, if you will be married to my son with this
silver ring your future happiness is certain. Do you think him handsome
and amiable enough to be willing to marry him?”

“Madam,” replied Felicia, blushing, “you overwhelm me with your
kindness. I know that you are my mother’s sister, and that by your art
you turned the soldiers who were sent to kill me into cabbages, and my
nurse into a hen, and that you do me only too much honor in proposing
that I shall marry your son. How can I explain to you the cause of my
hesitation? I feel, for the first time in my life, how happy it would
make me to be beloved. Can you indeed give me the Prince’s heart?”

“It is yours already, lovely Princess!” he cried, taking her hand in
his; “but for the horrible enchantment which kept me silent I should
have told you long ago how dearly I love you.”

This made the Princess very happy, and the Queen, who could not bear
to see her dressed like a poor shepherdess, touched her with her wand,
saying:

“I wish you to be attired as befits your rank and beauty.” And
immediately the Princess’s cotton dress became a magnificent robe of
silver brocade embroidered with carbuncles, and her soft dark hair was
encircled by a crown of diamonds, from which floated a clear white veil.
With her bright eyes, and the charming color in her cheeks, she was
altogether such a dazzling sight that the Prince could hardly bear it.

“How pretty you are, Felicia!” he cried. “Don’t keep me in suspense, I
entreat you; say that you will marry me.”

“Ah!” said the Queen, smiling, “I think she will not refuse now.”

Just then Bruno, who was going back to his work, came out of the
cottage, and thought he must be dreaming when he saw Felicia; but she
called him very kindly, and begged the Queen to take pity on him.

“What!” she said, “when he was so unkind to you?”

“Ah! madam,” said the Princess, “I am so happy that I should like
everybody else to be happy too.”

The Queen kissed her, and said: “Well, to please you, let me see what I
can do for this cross Bruno.” And with a wave of her wand she turned the
poor little cottage into a splendid palace, full of treasures; only the
two stools and the straw bed remained just as they were, to remind him
of his former poverty. Then the Queen touched Bruno himself, and made
him gentle and polite and grateful, and he thanked her and the Princess
a thousand times. Lastly, the Queen restored the hen and the cabbages
to their natural forms, and left them all very contented. The Prince and
Princess were married as soon as possible with great splendor, and lived
happily ever after.

Once upon a time there was a king who had three sons, who were all so
clever and brave that he began to be afraid that they would want to
reign over the kingdom before he was dead. Now the King, though he felt
that he was growing old, did not at all wish to give up the government
of his kingdom while he could still manage it very well, so he thought
the best way to live in peace would be to divert the minds of his sons
by promises which he could always get out of when the time came for
keeping them.

So he sent for them all, and, after speaking to them kindly, he added:

“You will quite agree with me, my dear children, that my great age makes
it impossible for me to look after my affairs of state as carefully as
I once did. I begin to fear that this may affect the welfare of my
subjects, therefore I wish that one of you should succeed to my crown;
but in return for such a gift as this it is only right that you should
do something for me. Now, as I think of retiring into the country, it
seems to me that a pretty, lively, faithful little dog would be very
good company for me; so, without any regard for your ages, I promise
that the one who brings me the most beautiful little dog shall succeed
me at once.”

The three Princes were greatly surprised by their father’s sudden fancy
for a little dog, but as it gave the two younger ones a chance they
would not otherwise have had of being king, and as the eldest was
too polite to make any objection, they accepted the commission with
pleasure. They bade farewell to the King, who gave them presents of
silver and precious stones, and appointed to meet them at the same hour,
in the same place, after a year had passed, to see the little dogs they
had brought for him.

Then they went together to a castle which was about a league from the
city, accompanied by all their particular friends, to whom they gave a
grand banquet, and the three brothers promised to be friends always,
to share whatever good fortune befell them, and not to be parted by
any envy or jealousy; and so they set out, agreeing to meet at the same
castle at the appointed time, to present themselves before the King
together. Each one took a different road, and the two eldest met with
many adventures; but it is about the youngest that you are going to
hear. He was young, and gay, and handsome, and knew everything that a
prince ought to know; and as for his courage, there was simply no end to
it.

Hardly a day passed without his buying several dogs--big and little,
greyhounds, mastiffs, spaniels, and lapdogs. As soon as he had bought a
pretty one he was sure to see a still prettier, and then he had to get
rid of all the others and buy that one, as, being alone, he found it
impossible to take thirty or forty thousand dogs about with him. He
journeyed from day to day, not knowing where he was going, until at
last, just at nightfall, he reached a great, gloomy forest. He did not
know his way, and, to make matters worse, it began to thunder, and
the rain poured down. He took the first path he could find, and after
walking for a long time he fancied he saw a faint light, and began to
hope that he was coming to some cottage where he might find shelter for
the night. At length, guided by the light, he reached the door of the
most splendid castle he could have imagined. This door was of gold
covered with carbuncles, and it was the pure red light which shone from
them that had shown him the way through the forest. The walls were of
the finest porcelain in all the most delicate colors, and the Prince saw
that all the stories he had ever read were pictured upon them; but as he
was terribly wet, and the rain still fell in torrents, he could not stay
to look about any more, but came back to the golden door. There he saw
a deer’s foot hanging by a chain of diamonds, and he began to wonder who
could live in this magnificent castle.

“They must feel very secure against robbers,” he said to himself. “What
is to hinder anyone from cutting off that chain and digging out those
carbuncles, and making himself rich for life?”

He pulled the deer’s foot, and immediately a silver bell sounded and the
door flew open, but the Prince could see nothing but numbers of hands
in the air, each holding a torch. He was so much surprised that he stood
quite still, until he felt himself pushed forward by other hands, so
that, though he was somewhat uneasy, he could not help going on. With
his hand on his sword, to be prepared for whatever might happen, he
entered a hall paved with lapis-lazuli, while two lovely voices sang:


     “The hands you see floating above
       Will swiftly your bidding obey;
     If your heart dreads not conquering Love,
       In this place you may fearlessly stay.”


The Prince could not believe that any danger threatened him when he was
welcomed in this way, so, guided by the mysterious hands, he went toward
a door of coral, which opened of its own accord, and he found himself
in a vast hall of mother-of-pearl, out of which opened a number of other
rooms, glittering with thousands of lights, and full of such beautiful
pictures and precious things that the Prince felt quite bewildered.
After passing through sixty rooms the hands that conducted him stopped,
and the Prince saw a most comfortable-looking arm-chair drawn up close
to the chimney-corner; at the same moment the fire lighted itself, and
the pretty, soft, clever hands took off the Prince’s wet, muddy clothes,
and presented him with fresh ones made of the richest stuffs, all
embroidered with gold and emeralds. He could not help admiring
everything he saw, and the deft way in which the hands waited on him,
though they sometimes appeared so suddenly that they made him jump.

When he was quite ready--and I can assure you that he looked very
different from the wet and weary Prince who had stood outside in the
rain, and pulled the deer’s foot--the hands led him to a splendid room,
upon the walls of which were painted the histories of Puss in Boots and
a number of other famous cats. The table was laid for supper with
two golden plates, and golden spoons and forks, and the sideboard was
covered with dishes and glasses of crystal set with precious stones. The
Prince was wondering who the second place could be for, when suddenly
in came about a dozen cats carrying guitars and rolls of music, who took
their places at one end of the room, and under the direction of a cat
who beat time with a roll of paper began to mew in every imaginable key,
and to draw their claws across the strings of the guitars, making the
strangest kind of music that could be heard. The Prince hastily stopped
up his ears, but even then the sight of these comical musicians sent him
into fits of laughter.

“What funny thing shall I see next?” he said to himself, and instantly
the door opened, and in came a tiny figure covered by a long black veil.
It was conducted by two cats wearing black mantles and carrying swords,
and a large party of cats followed, who brought in cages full of rats
and mice.

The Prince was so much astonished that he thought he must be dreaming,
but the little figure came up to him and threw back its veil, and he saw
that it was the loveliest little white cat it is possible to imagine.
She looked very young and very sad, and in a sweet little voice that
went straight to his heart she said to the Prince:

“King’s son, you are welcome; the Queen of the Cats is glad to see you.”

“Lady Cat,” replied the Prince, “I thank you for receiving me so kindly,
but surely you are no ordinary pussy-cat? Indeed, the way you speak and
the magnificence of your castle prove it plainly.”

“King’s son,” said the White Cat, “I beg you to spare me these
compliments, for I am not used to them. But now,” she added, “let supper
be served, and let the musicians be silent, as the Prince does not
understand what they are saying.”

So the mysterious hands began to bring in the supper, and first they put
on the table two dishes, one containing stewed pigeons and the other a
fricassee of fat mice. The sight of the latter made the Prince feel as
if he could not enjoy his supper at all; but the White Cat, seeing this,
assured him that the dishes intended for him were prepared in a separate
kitchen, and he might be quite certain that they contained neither rats
nor mice; and the Prince felt so sure that she would not deceive him
that he had no more hesitation in beginning. Presently he noticed
that on the little paw that was next him the White Cat wore a bracelet
containing a portrait, and he begged to be allowed to look at it. To his
great surprise he found it represented an extremely handsome young man,
who was so like himself that it might have been his own portrait! The
White Cat sighed as he looked at it, and seemed sadder than ever, and
the Prince dared not ask any questions for fear of displeasing her; so
he began to talk about other things, and found that she was interested
in all the subjects he cared for himself, and seemed to know quite well
what was going on in the world. After supper they went into another
room, which was fitted up as a theatre, and the cats acted and danced
for their amusement, and then the White Cat said good-night to him, and
the hands conducted him into a room he had not seen before, hung with
tapestry worked with butterflies’ wings of every color; there were
mirrors that reached from the ceiling to the floor, and a little white
bed with curtains of gauze tied up with ribbons. The Prince went to bed
in silence, as he did not quite know how to begin a conversation with
the hands that waited on him, and in the morning he was awakened by
a noise and confusion outside of his window, and the hands came and
quickly dressed him in hunting costume. When he looked out all the cats
were assembled in the courtyard, some leading greyhounds, some blowing
horns, for the White Cat was going out hunting. The hands led a wooden
horse up to the Prince, and seemed to expect him to mount it, at which
he was very indignant; but it was no use for him to object, for he
speedily found himself upon its back, and it pranced gaily off with him.

The White Cat herself was riding a monkey, which climbed even up to
the eagles’ nests when she had a fancy for the young eaglets. Never was
there a pleasanter hunting party, and when they returned to the castle
the Prince and the White Cat supped together as before, but when they
had finished she offered him a crystal goblet, which must have contained
a magic draught, for, as soon as he had swallowed its contents, he
forgot everything, even the little dog that he was seeking for the King,
and only thought how happy he was to be with the White Cat! And so the
days passed, in every kind of amusement, until the year was nearly gone.
The Prince had forgotten all about meeting his brothers: he did not even
know what country he belonged to; but the White Cat knew when he ought
to go back, and one day she said to him:

“Do you know that you have only three days left to look for the little
dog for your father, and your brothers have found lovely ones?”

Then the Prince suddenly recovered his memory, and cried:

“What can have made me forget such an important thing? My whole fortune
depends upon it; and even if I could in such a short time find a dog
pretty enough to gain me a kingdom, where should I find a horse who
would carry me all that way in three days?” And he began to be very
vexed. But the White Cat said to him: “King’s son, do not trouble
yourself; I am your friend, and will make everything easy for you. You
can still stay here for a day, as the good wooden horse can take you to
your country in twelve hours.”

“I thank you, beautiful Cat,” said the Prince; “but what good will it do
me to get back if I have not a dog to take to my father?”

“See here,” answered the White Cat, holding up an acorn; “there is a
prettier one in this than in the Dogstar!”

“Oh! White Cat dear,” said the Prince, “how unkind you are to laugh at
me now!”

“Only listen,” she said, holding the acorn to his ear.

And inside it he distinctly heard a tiny voice say: “Bow-wow!”

The Prince was delighted, for a dog that can be shut up in an acorn must
be very small indeed. He wanted to take it out and look at it, but the
White Cat said it would be better not to open the acorn till he was
before the King, in case the tiny dog should be cold on the journey. He
thanked her a thousand times, and said good-by quite sadly when the time
came for him to set out.

“The days have passed so quickly with you,” he said, “I only wish I
could take you with me now.”

But the White Cat shook her head and sighed deeply in answer.

After all the Prince was the first to arrive at the castle where he had
agreed to meet his brothers, but they came soon after, and stared in
amazement when they saw the wooden horse in the courtyard jumping like a
hunter.

The Prince met them joyfully, and they began to tell him all their
adventures; but he managed to hide from them what he had been doing, and
even led them to think that a turnspit dog which he had with him was the
one he was bringing for the King. Fond as they all were of one another,
the two eldest could not help being glad to think that their dogs
certainly had a better chance. The next morning they started in the same
chariot. The elder brothers carried in baskets two such tiny, fragile
dogs that they hardly dared to touch them. As for the turnspit, he ran
after the chariot, and got so covered with mud that one could hardly see
what he was like at all. When they reached the palace everyone crowded
round to welcome them as they went into the King’s great hall; and when
the two brothers presented their little dogs nobody could decide which
was the prettier. They were already arranging between themselves to
share the kingdom equally, when the youngest stepped forward, drawing
from his pocket the acorn the White Cat had given him. He opened it
quickly, and there upon a white cushion they saw a dog so small that it
could easily have been put through a ring. The Prince laid it upon the
ground, and it got up at once and began to dance. The King did not know
what to say, for it was impossible that anything could be prettier than
this little creature. Nevertheless, as he was in no hurry to part with
his crown, he told his sons that, as they had been so successful the
first time, he would ask them to go once again, and seek by land and sea
for a piece of muslin so fine that it could be drawn through the eye of
a needle. The brothers were not very willing to set out again, but
the two eldest consented because it gave them another chance, and they
started as before. The youngest again mounted the wooden horse, and rode
back at full speed to his beloved White Cat. Every door of the castle
stood wide open, and every window and turret was illuminated, so it
looked more wonderful than before. The hands hastened to meet him, and
led the wooden horse off to the stable, while he hurried in to find the
White Cat. She was asleep in a little basket on a white satin cushion,
but she very soon started up when she heard the Prince, and was
overjoyed at seeing him once more.

“How could I hope that you would come back to me King’s son?” she said.
And then he stroked and petted her, and told her of his successful
journey, and how he had come back to ask her help, as he believed that
it was impossible to find what the King demanded. The White Cat looked
serious, and said she must think what was to be done, but that, luckily,
there were some cats in the castle who could spin very well, and if
anybody could manage it they could, and she would set them the task
herself.

And then the hands appeared carrying torches, and conducted the Prince
and the White Cat to a long gallery which overlooked the river, from
the windows of which they saw a magnificent display of fireworks of all
sorts; after which they had supper, which the Prince liked even better
than the fireworks, for it was very late, and he was hungry after his
long ride. And so the days passed quickly as before; it was impossible
to feel dull with the White Cat, and she had quite a talent for
inventing new amusements--indeed, she was cleverer than a cat has any
right to be. But when the Prince asked her how it was that she was so
wise, she only said:

“King’s son, do not ask me; guess what you please. I may not tell you
anything.”

The Prince was so happy that he did not trouble himself at all about the
time, but presently the White Cat told him that the year was gone, and
that he need not be at all anxious about the piece of muslin, as they
had made it very well.

“This time,” she added, “I can give you a suitable escort”; and on
looking out into the courtyard the Prince saw a superb chariot of
burnished gold, enameled in flame color with a thousand different
devices. It was drawn by twelve snow-white horses, harnessed four
abreast; their trappings were flame-colored velvet, embroidered with
diamonds. A hundred chariots followed, each drawn by eight horses,
and filled with officers in splendid uniforms, and a thousand guards
surrounded the procession. “Go!” said the White Cat, “and when you
appear before the King in such state he surely will not refuse you the
crown which you deserve. Take this walnut, but do not open it until you
are before him, then you will find in it the piece of stuff you asked me
for.”

“Lovely Blanchette,” said the Prince, “how can I thank you properly for
all your kindness to me? Only tell me that you wish it, and I will
give up for ever all thought of being king, and will stay here with you
always.”

“King’s son,” she replied, “it shows the goodness of your heart that you
should care so much for a little white cat, who is good for nothing but
to catch mice; but you must not stay.”

So the Prince kissed her little paw and set out. You can imagine how
fast he traveled when I tell you that they reached the King’s palace in
just half the time it had taken the wooden horse to get there. This time
the Prince was so late that he did not try to meet his brothers at their
castle, so they thought he could not be coming, and were rather glad of
it, and displayed their pieces of muslin to the King proudly, feeling
sure of success. And indeed the stuff was very fine, and would go
through the eye of a very large needle; but the King, who was only too
glad to make a difficulty, sent for a particular needle, which was kept
among the Crown jewels, and had such a small eye that everybody saw at
once that it was impossible that the muslin should pass through it. The
Princes were angry, and were beginning to complain that it was a trick,
when suddenly the trumpets sounded and the youngest Prince came in. His
father and brothers were quite astonished at his magnificence, and after
he had greeted them he took the walnut from his pocket and opened it,
fully expecting to find the piece of muslin, but instead there was only
a hazel-nut. He cracked it, and there lay a cherry-stone. Everybody was
looking on, and the King was chuckling to himself at the idea of finding
the piece of muslin in a nutshell.

However, the Prince cracked the cherry-stone, but everyone laughed when
he saw it contained only its own kernel. He opened that and found a
grain of wheat, and in that was a millet seed. Then he himself began to
wonder, and muttered softly:

“White Cat, White Cat, are you making fun of me?”

In an instant he felt a cat’s claw give his hand quite a sharp scratch,
and hoping that it was meant as an encouragement he opened the millet
seed, and drew out of it a piece of muslin four hundred ells long, woven
with the loveliest colors and most wonderful patterns; and when the
needle was brought it went through the eye six times with the greatest
ease! The King turned pale, and the other Princes stood silent and
sorrowful, for nobody could deny that this was the most marvelous piece
of muslin that was to be found in the world.

Presently the King turned to his sons, and said, with a deep sigh:

“Nothing could console me more in my old age than to realize your
willingness to gratify my wishes. Go then once more, and whoever at the
end of a year can bring back the loveliest princess shall be married
to her, and shall, without further delay, receive the crown, for my
successor must certainly be married.” The Prince considered that he had
earned the kingdom fairly twice over but still he was too well bred
to argue about it, so he just went back to his gorgeous chariot, and,
surrounded by his escort, returned to the White Cat faster than he had
come. This time she was expecting him, the path was strewn with flowers,
and a thousand braziers were burning scented woods which perfumed the
air. Seated in a gallery from which she could see his arrival, the White
Cat waited for him. “Well, King’s son,” she said, “here you are once
more, without a crown.” “Madam,” said he, “thanks to your generosity I
have earned one twice over; but the fact is that my father is so loth to
part with it that it would be no pleasure to me to take it.”

“Never mind,” she answered, “it’s just as well to try and deserve it. As
you must take back a lovely princess with you next time I will be on
the look-out for one for you. In the meantime let us enjoy ourselves;
to-night I have ordered a battle between my cats and the river rats on
purpose to amuse you.” So this year slipped away even more pleasantly
than the preceding ones. Sometimes the Prince could not help asking the
White Cat how it was she could talk.

“Perhaps you are a fairy,” he said. “Or has some enchanter changed you
into a cat?”

But she only gave him answers that told him nothing. Days go by so
quickly when one is very happy that it is certain the Prince would never
have thought of its being time to go back, when one evening as they sat
together the White Cat said to him that if he wanted to take a lovely
princess home with him the next day he must be prepared to do what she
told him.

“Take this sword,” she said, “and cut off my head!”

“I!” cried the Prince, “I cut off your head! Blanchette darling, how
could I do it?”

“I entreat you to do as I tell you, King’s son,” she replied.

The tears came into the Prince’s eyes as he begged her to ask him
anything but that--to set him any task she pleased as a proof of his
devotion, but to spare him the grief of killing his dear Pussy. But
nothing he could say altered her determination, and at last he drew his
sword, and desperately, with a trembling hand, cut off the little white
head. But imagine his astonishment and delight when suddenly a lovely
princess stood before him, and, while he was still speechless with
amazement, the door opened and a goodly company of knights and ladies
entered, each carrying a cat’s skin! They hastened with every sign of
joy to the Princess, kissing her hand and congratulating her on being
once more restored to her natural shape. She received them graciously,
but after a few minutes begged that they would leave her alone with the
Prince, to whom she said:

“You see, Prince, that you were right in supposing me to be no ordinary
cat. My father reigned over six kingdoms. The Queen, my mother, whom he
loved dearly, had a passion for traveling and exploring, and when I
was only a few weeks old she obtained his permission to visit a certain
mountain of which she had heard many marvelous tales, and set out,
taking with her a number of her attendants. On the way they had to pass
near an old castle belonging to the fairies. Nobody had ever been into
it, but it was reported to be full of the most wonderful things, and
my mother remembered to have heard that the fairies had in their garden
such fruits as were to be seen and tasted nowhere else. She began to
wish to try them for herself, and turned her steps in the direction of
the garden. On arriving at the door, which blazed with gold and jewels,
she ordered her servants to knock loudly, but it was useless; it seemed
as if all the inhabitants of the castle must be asleep or dead. Now the
more difficult it became to obtain the fruit, the more the Queen was
determined that have it she would. So she ordered that they should bring
ladders, and get over the wall into the garden; but though the wall did
not look very high, and they tied the ladders together to make them very
long, it was quite impossible to get to the top.

“The Queen was in despair, but as night was coming on she ordered
that they should encamp just where they were, and went to bed herself,
feeling quite ill, she was so disappointed. In the middle of the night
she was suddenly awakened, and saw to her surprise a tiny, ugly old
woman seated by her bedside, who said to her:

“‘I must say that we consider it somewhat troublesome of your Majesty to
insist upon tasting our fruit; but to save you annoyance, my sisters
and I will consent to give you as much as you can carry away, on one
condition--that is, that you shall give us your little daughter to bring
up as our own.’

“‘Ah! my dear madam,’ cried the Queen, ‘is there nothing else that you
will take for the fruit? I will give you my kingdoms willingly.’

“‘No,’ replied the old fairy, ‘we will have nothing but your little
daughter. She shall be as happy as the day is long, and we will give her
everything that is worth having in fairy-land, but you must not see her
again until she is married.’

“‘Though it is a hard condition,’ said the Queen, ‘I consent, for I
shall certainly die if I do not taste the fruit, and so I should lose my
little daughter either way.’

“So the old fairy led her into the castle, and, though it was still the
middle of the night, the Queen could see plainly that it was far more
beautiful than she had been told, which you can easily believe, Prince,”
 said the White Cat, “when I tell you that it was this castle that we are
now in. ‘Will you gather the fruit yourself, Queen?’ said the old fairy,
‘or shall I call it to come to you?’

“‘I beg you to let me see it come when it is called,’ cried the Queen;
‘that will be something quite new.’ The old fairy whistled twice, then
she cried:

“‘Apricots, peaches, nectarines, cherries, plums, pears, melons, grapes,
apples, oranges, lemons, gooseberries, strawberries, raspberries, come!’

“And in an instant they came tumbling in one over another, and yet they
were neither dusty nor spoilt, and the Queen found them quite as good as
she had fancied them. You see they grew upon fairy trees.

“The old fairy gave her golden baskets in which to take the fruit away,
and it was as much as four hundred mules could carry. Then she reminded
the Queen of her agreement, and led her back to the camp, and next
morning she went back to her kingdom, but before she had gone very far
she began to repent of her bargain, and when the King came out to meet
her she looked so sad that he guessed that something had happened, and
asked what was the matter. At first the Queen was afraid to tell him,
but when, as soon as they reached the palace, five frightful little
dwarfs were sent by the fairies to fetch me, she was obliged to confess
what she had promised. The King was very angry, and had the Queen and
myself shut up in a great tower and safely guarded, and drove the little
dwarfs out of his kingdom; but the fairies sent a great dragon who ate
up all the people he met, and whose breath burnt up everything as he
passed through the country; and at last, after trying in vain to rid
himself of this monster, the King, to save his subjects, was obliged to
consent that I should be given up to the fairies. This time they came
themselves to fetch me, in a chariot of pearl drawn by sea-horses,
followed by the dragon, who was led with chains of diamonds. My cradle
was placed between the old fairies, who loaded me with caresses, and
away we whirled through the air to a tower which they had built on
purpose for me. There I grew up surrounded with everything that was
beautiful and rare, and learning everything that is ever taught to a
princess, but without any companions but a parrot and a little dog, who
could both talk; and receiving every day a visit from one of the old
fairies, who came mounted upon the dragon. One day, however, as I sat at
my window I saw a handsome young prince, who seemed to have been hunting
in the forest which surrounded my prison, and who was standing and
looking up at me. When he saw that I observed him he saluted me with
great deference. You can imagine that I was delighted to have some one
new to talk to, and in spite of the height of my window our conversation
was prolonged till night fell, then my prince reluctantly bade me
farewell. But after that he came again many times and at last I
consented to marry him, but the question was how was I to escape from my
tower. The fairies always supplied me with flax for my spinning, and by
great diligence I made enough cord for a ladder that would reach to
the foot of the tower; but, alas! just as my prince was helping me to
descend it, the crossest and ugliest of the old fairies flew in. Before
he had time to defend himself my unhappy lover was swallowed up by the
dragon. As for me, the fairies, furious at having their plans defeated,
for they intended me to marry the king of the dwarfs, and I utterly
refused, changed me into a white cat. When they brought me here I found
all the lords and ladies of my father’s court awaiting me under the same
enchantment, while the people of lesser rank had been made invisible,
all but their hands.

“As they laid me under the enchantment the fairies told me all my
history, for until then I had quite believed that I was their child, and
warned me that my only chance of regaining my natural form was to win
the love of a prince who resembled in every way my unfortunate lover.

“And you have won it, lovely Princess,” interrupted the Prince.

“You are indeed wonderfully like him,” resumed the Princess--“in voice,
in features, and everything; and if you really love me all my troubles
will be at an end.”

“And mine too,” cried the Prince, throwing himself at her feet, “if you
will consent to marry me.”

“I love you already better than anyone in the world,” she said; “but
now it is time to go back to your father, and we shall hear what he says
about it.”

So the Prince gave her his hand and led her out, and they mounted the
chariot together; it was even more splendid than before, and so was the
whole company. Even the horses’ shoes were of rubies with diamond nails,
and I suppose that is the first time such a thing was ever seen.

As the Princess was as kind and clever as she was beautiful, you may
imagine what a delightful journey the Prince found it, for everything
the Princess said seemed to him quite charming.

When they came near the castle where the brothers were to meet, the
Princess got into a chair carried by four of the guards; it was hewn out
of one splendid crystal, and had silken curtains, which she drew round
her that she might not be seen.

The Prince saw his brothers walking upon the terrace, each with a lovely
princess, and they came to meet him, asking if he had also found a wife.
He said that he had found something much rarer--a white cat! At which
they laughed very much, and asked him if he was afraid of being eaten up
by mice in the palace. And then they set out together for the town. Each
prince and princess rode in a splendid carriage; the horses were decked
with plumes of feathers, and glittered with gold. After them came the
youngest prince, and last of all the crystal chair, at which everybody
looked with admiration and curiosity. When the courtiers saw them coming
they hastened to tell the King.

“Are the ladies beautiful?” he asked anxiously.

And when they answered that nobody had ever before seen such lovely
princesses he seemed quite annoyed.

However, he received them graciously, but found it impossible to choose
between them.

Then turning to his youngest son he said:

“Have you come back alone, after all?”

“Your Majesty,” replied the Prince, “will find in that crystal chair a
little white cat, which has such soft paws, and mews so prettily, that I
am sure you will be charmed with it.”

The King smiled, and went to draw back the curtains himself, but at a
touch from the Princess the crystal shivered into a thousand splinters,
and there she stood in all her beauty; her fair hair floated over her
shoulders and was crowned with flowers, and her softly falling robe was
of the purest white. She saluted the King gracefully, while a murmur of
admiration rose from all around.

“Sire,” she said, “I am not come to deprive you of the throne you fill
so worthily. I have already six kingdoms, permit me to bestow one upon
you, and upon each of your sons. I ask nothing but your friendship, and
your consent to my marriage with your youngest son; we shall still have
three kingdoms left for ourselves.”

The King and all the courtiers could not conceal their joy and
astonishment, and the marriage of the three Princes was celebrated at
once. The festivities lasted several months, and then each king and
queen departed to their own kingdom and lived happily ever after.


Once upon a time, in a large forest, there lived an old woman and
three maidens. They were all three beautiful, but the youngest was the
fairest. Their hut was quite hidden by trees, and none saw their beauty
but the sun by day, and the moon by night, and the eyes of the stars.
The old woman kept the girls hard at work, from morning till night,
spinning gold flax into yarn, and when one distaff was empty another was
given them, so they had no rest. The thread had to be fine and even, and
when done was locked up in a secret chamber by the old woman, who twice
or thrice every summer went a journey. Before she went she gave out work
for each day of her absence, and always returned in the night, so that
the girls never saw what she brought back with her, neither would she
tell them whence the gold flax came, nor what it was to be used for.

Now, when the time came round for the old woman to set out on one of
these journeys, she gave each maiden work for six days, with the usual
warning: “Children, don’t let your eyes wander, and on no account speak
to a man, for, if you do, your thread will lose its brightness, and
misfortunes of all kinds will follow.” They laughed at this oft-repeated
caution, saying to each other: “How can our gold thread lose its
brightness, and have we any chance of speaking to a man?”

On the third day after the old woman’s departure a young prince, hunting
in the forest, got separated from his companions, and completely lost.
Weary of seeking his way, he flung himself down under a tree, leaving
his horse to browse at will, and fell asleep.

The sun had set when he awoke and began once more to try and find his
way out of the forest. At last he perceived a narrow foot-path, which he
eagerly followed and found that it led him to a small hut. The maidens,
who were sitting at the door of their hut for coolness, saw him
approaching, and the two elder were much alarmed, for they remembered
the old woman’s warning; but the youngest said: “Never before have I
seen anyone like him; let me have one look.” They entreated her to come
in, but, seeing that she would not, left her, and the Prince, coming up,
courteously greeted the maiden, and told her he had lost his way in the
forest and was both hungry and weary. She set food before him, and
was so delighted with his conversation that she forgot the old woman’s
caution, and lingered for hours. In the meantime the Prince’s companions
sought him far and wide, but to no purpose, so they sent two messengers
to tell the sad news to the King, who immediately ordered a regiment of
cavalry and one of infantry to go and look for him.

After three days’ search, they found the hut. The Prince was still
sitting by the door and had been so happy in the maiden’s company that
the time had seemed like a single hour. Before leaving he promised to
return and fetch her to his father’s court, where he would make her his
bride. When he had gone, she sat down to her wheel to make up for
lost time, but was dismayed to find that her thread had lost all
its brightness. Her heart beat fast and she wept bitterly, for she
remembered the old woman’s warning and knew not what misfortune might
now befall her.

The old woman returned in the night and knew by the tarnished thread
what had happened in her absence. She was furiously angry and told
the maiden that she had brought down misery both on herself and on the
Prince. The maiden could not rest for thinking of this. At last she
could bear it no longer, and resolved to seek help from the Prince.

As a child she had learned to understand the speech of birds, and this
was now of great use to her, for, seeing a raven pluming itself on a
pine bough, she cried softly to it: “Dear bird, cleverest of all birds,
as well as swiftest on wing, wilt thou help me?” “How can I help
thee?” asked the raven. She answered: “Fly away, until thou comest to a
splendid town, where stands a king’s palace; seek out the king’s son
and tell him that a great misfortune has befallen me.” Then she told the
raven how her thread had lost its brightness, how terribly angry the old
woman was, and how she feared some great disaster. The raven promised
faithfully to do her bidding, and, spreading its wings, flew away. The
maiden now went home and worked hard all day at winding up the yarn her
elder sisters had spun, for the old woman would let her spin no longer.
Toward evening she heard the raven’s “craa, craa,” from the pine tree
and eagerly hastened thither to hear the answer.

By great good fortune the raven had found a wind wizard’s son in the
palace garden, who understood the speech of birds, and to him he had
entrusted the message. When the Prince heard it, he was very sorrowful,
and took counsel with his friends how to free the maiden. Then he said
to the wind wizard’s son: “Beg the raven to fly quickly back to the
maiden and tell her to be ready on the ninth night, for then will I come
and fetch her away.” The wind wizard’s son did this, and the raven flew
so swiftly that it reached the hut that same evening. The maiden thanked
the bird heartily and went home, telling no one what she had heard.

As the ninth night drew near she became very unhappy, for she feared
lest some terrible mischance should arise and ruin all. On this night
she crept quietly out of the house and waited trembling at some little
distance from the hut. Presently she heard the muffled tramp of horses,
and soon the armed troop appeared, led by the Prince, who had prudently
marked all the trees beforehand, in order to know the way. When he saw
the maiden he sprang from his horse, lifted her into the saddle, and
then, mounting behind, rode homeward. The moon shone so brightly that
they had no difficulty in seeing the marked trees.

By and by the coming of dawn loosened the tongues of all the birds,
and, had the Prince only known what they were saying, or the maiden
been listening, they might have been spared much sorrow, but they were
thinking only of each other, and when they came out of the forest the
sun was high in the heavens.

Next morning, when the youngest girl did not come to her work, the old
woman asked where she was. The sisters pretended not to know, but the
old woman easily guessed what had happened, and, as she was in reality
a wicked witch, determined to punish the fugitives. Accordingly, she
collected nine different kinds of enchanters’ nightshade, added some
salt, which she first bewitched, and, doing all up in a cloth into the
shape of a fluffy ball, sent it after them on the wings of the wind,
saying:

  “Whirlwind!--mother of the wind!
  Lend thy aid ‘gainst her who sinned!
  Carry with thee this magic ball.
  Cast her from his arms for ever,
  Bury her in the rippling river.”


At midday the Prince and his men came to a deep river, spanned by so
narrow a bridge that only one rider could cross at a time. The horse on
which the Prince and the maiden were riding had just reached the middle
when the magic ball flew by. The horse in its fright suddenly reared,
and before anyone could stop it flung the maiden into the swift current
below. The Prince tried to jump in after her, but his men held him back,
and in spite of his struggles led him home, where for six weeks he shut
himself up in a secret chamber, and would neither eat nor drink, so
great was his grief. At last he became so ill his life was despaired of,
and in great alarm the King caused all the wizards of his country to be
summoned. But none could cure him. At last the wind wizard’s son said to
the King: “Send for the old wizard from Finland he knows more than all
the wizards of your kingdom put together.” A messenger was at once sent
to Finland, and a week later the old wizard himself arrived on the wings
of the wind. “Honored King,” said the wizard, “the wind has blown this
illness upon your son, and a magic ball has snatched away his beloved.
This it is which makes him grieve so constantly. Let the wind blow upon
him that it may blow away his sorrow.” Then the King made his son go
out into the wind, and he gradually recovered and told his father all.
“Forget the maiden,” said the King, “and take another bride”; but the
Prince said he could never love another.

A year afterward he came suddenly upon the bridge where his beloved met
her death. As he recalled the misfortune he wept bitterly, and would
have given all he possessed to have her once more alive. In the midst
of his grief he thought he heard a voice singing, and looked round, but
could see no one. Then he heard the voice again, and it said:

“Alas! bewitched and all forsaken,  ‘Tis I must lie for ever here!
My beloved no thought has taken  To free his bride, that was so dear.”

He was greatly astonished, sprang from his horse, and looked everywhere
to see if no one were hidden under the bridge; but no one was there.
Then he noticed a yellow water-lily floating on the surface of the
water, half hidden by its broad leaves; but flowers do not sing, and
in great surprise he waited, hoping to hear more. Then again the voice
sang:

     “Alas! bewitched and all forsaken,
       ‘Tis I must lie for ever here!
     My beloved no thought has taken
       To free his bride, that was so dear.”

The Prince suddenly remembered the gold-spinners, and said to himself:
“If I ride thither, who knows but that they could explain this to me?”
 He at once rode to the hut, and found the two maidens at the fountain.
He told them what had befallen their sister the year before, and how he
had twice heard a strange song, but yet could see no singer. They said
that the yellow water-lily could be none other than their sister, who
was not dead, but transformed by the magic ball. Before he went to bed,
the eldest made a cake of magic herbs, which she gave him to eat. In the
night he dreamed that he was living in the forest and could understand
all that the birds said to each other. Next morning he told this to the
maidens, and they said that the charmed cake had caused it, and advised
him to listen well to the birds, and see what they could tell him, and
when he had recovered his bride they begged him to return and deliver
them from their wretched bondage.

Having promised this, he joyfully returned home, and as he was riding
through the forest he could perfectly understand all that the birds
said. He heard a thrush say to a magpie: “How stupid men are! they
cannot understand the simplest thing. It is now quite a year since the
maiden was transformed into a water-lily, and, though she sings so sadly
that anyone going over the bridge must hear her, yet no one comes to
her aid. Her former bridegroom rode over it a few days ago and heard her
singing, but was no wiser than the rest.”

“And he is to blame for all her misfortunes,” added the magpie. “If he
heeds only the words of men she will remain a flower for ever. She
were soon delivered were the matter only laid before the old wizard of
Finland.”

After hearing this, the Prince wondered how he could get a message
conveyed to Finland. He heard one swallow say to another: “Come, let us
fly to Finland; we can build better nests there.”

“Stop, kind friends!” cried the Prince. “Will you do something for me?”
 The birds consented, and he said: “Take a thousand greetings from me
to the wizard of Finland, and ask him how I may restore a maiden
transformed into a flower to her own form.”

The swallows flew away, and the Prince rode on to the bridge. There he
waited, hoping to hear the song. But he heard nothing but the rushing of
the water and the moaning of the wind, and, disappointed, rode home.

Shortly after, he was sitting in the garden, thinking that the swallows
must have forgotten his message, when he saw an eagle flying above him.
The bird gradually descended until it perched on a tree close to the
Prince and said: “The wizard of Finland greets thee and bids me say that
thou mayest free the maiden thus: Go to the river and smear thyself all
over with mud; then say: ‘From a man into a crab,’ and thou wilt become
a crab. Plunge boldly into the water, swim as close as thou canst to the
water-lily’s roots, and loosen them from the mud and reeds. This done,
fasten thy claws into the roots and rise with them to the surface. Let
the water flow all over the flower, and drift with the current until
thou comest to a mountain ash tree on the left bank. There is near it
a large stone. Stop there and say: ‘From a crab into a man, from a
water-lily into a maiden,’ and ye both will be restored to your own
forms.”

Full of doubt and fear, the Prince let some time pass before he was bold
enough to attempt to rescue the maiden. Then a crow said to him: “Why
dost thou hesitate? The old wizard has not told thee wrong, neither have
the birds deceived thee; hasten and dry the maiden’s tears.”

“Nothing worse than death can befall me,” thought the Prince, “and death
is better than endless sorrow.” So he mounted his horse and went to
the bridge. Again he heard the water-lily’s lament, and, hesitating no
longer, smeared himself all over with mud, and, saying: “From a man into
a crab,” plunged into the river. For one moment the water hissed in
his ears, and then all was silent. He swam up to the plant and began
to loosen its roots, but so firmly were they fixed in the mud and reeds
that this took him a long time. He then grasped them and rose to the
surface, letting the water flow over the flower. The current carried
them down the stream, but nowhere could he see the mountain ash. At last
he saw it, and close by the large stone. Here he stopped and said: “From
a crab into a man, from a water-lily into a maiden,” and to his delight
found himself once more a prince, and the maiden was by his side. She
was ten times more beautiful than before, and wore a magnificent pale
yellow robe, sparkling with jewels. She thanked him for having freed her
from the cruel witch’s power, and willingly consented to marry him.

But when they came to the bridge where he had left his horse it was
nowhere to be seen, for, though the Prince thought he had been a crab
only a few hours, he had in reality been under the water for more than
ten days. While they were wondering how they should reach his father’s
court, they saw a splendid coach driven by six gaily caparisoned horses
coming along the bank. In this they drove to the palace. The King and
Queen were at church, weeping for their son, whom they had long mourned
for dead. Great was their delight and astonishment when the Prince
entered, leading the beautiful maiden by the hand. The wedding was at
once celebrated and there was feasting and merry-making throughout the
kingdom for six weeks.

Some time afterward the Prince and his bride were sitting in the garden,
when a crow said to them: “Ungrateful creatures! Have you forgotten the
two poor maidens who helped you in your distress? Must they spin gold
flax for ever? Have no pity on the old witch. The three maidens are
princesses, whom she stole away when they were children together, with
all the silver utensils, which she turned into gold flax. Poison were
her fittest punishment.”

The Prince was ashamed of having forgotten his promise and set out at
once, and by great good fortune reached the hut when the old woman was
away. The maidens had dreamed that he was coming, and were ready to go
with him, but first they made a cake in which they put poison, and
left it on a table where the old woman was likely to see it when she
returned. She _did_ see it, and thought it looked so tempting that she
greedily ate it up and at once died.

In the secret chamber were found fifty wagon-loads of gold flax, and as
much more was discovered buried. The hut was razed to the ground, and
the Prince and his bride and her two sisters lived happily ever after.


Once upon a time there was a king whose only child was a girl. Now the
King had been very anxious to have a son, or at least a grandson, to
come after him, but he was told by a prophet whom he consulted that his
own daughter’s son should kill him. This news terrified him so much that
he determined never to let his daughter be married, for he thought it
was better to have no grandson at all than to be killed by his grandson.
He therefore called his workmen together, and bade them dig a deep round
hole in the earth, and then he had a prison of brass built in the hole,
and then, when it was finished, he locked up his daughter. No man ever
saw her, and she never saw even the fields and the sea, but only the sky
and the sun, for there was a wide open window in the roof of the house
of brass. So the Princess would sit looking up at the sky, and watching
the clouds float across, and wondering whether she should ever get out
of her prison. Now one day it seemed to her that the sky opened above
her, and a great shower of shining gold fell through the window in the
roof, and lay glittering in her room. Not very long after, the Princess
had a baby, a little boy, but when the King her father heard of it he
was very angry and afraid, for now the child was born that should be his
death. Yet, cowardly as he was, he had not quite the heart to kill
the Princess and her baby outright, but he had them put in a huge
brass-bound chest and thrust out to sea, that they might either be
drowned or starved, or perhaps come to a country where they would be out
of his way.

So the Princess and the baby floated and drifted in the chest on the sea
all day and night, but the baby was not afraid of the waves nor of the
wind, for he did not know that they could hurt him, and he slept quite
soundly. And the Princess sang a song over him, and this was her song:

  “Child, my child, how sound you sleep!
  Though your mother’s care is deep,
  You can lie with heart at rest
  In the narrow brass-bound chest;
  In the starless night and drear
  You can sleep, and never hear
  Billows breaking, and the cry
  Of the night-wind wandering by;
  In soft purple mantle sleeping
  With your little face on mine,
  Hearing not your mother weeping
  And the breaking of the brine.”


Well, the daylight came at last, and the great chest was driven by the
waves against the shore of an island. There the brass-bound chest lay,
with the Princess and her baby in it, till a man of that country came
past, and saw it, and dragged it on to the beach, and when he had broken
it open, behold! there was a beautiful lady and a little boy. So he took
them home, and was very kind to them, and brought up the boy till he was
a young man. Now when the boy had come to his full strength the King of
that country fell in love with his mother, and wanted to marry her, but
he knew that she would never part from her boy. So he thought of a plan
to get rid of the boy, and this was his plan: A great Queen of a country
not far off was going to be married, and this king said that all his
subjects must bring him wedding presents to give her. And he made a
feast to which he invited them all, and they all brought their presents;
some brought gold cups, and some brought necklaces of gold and amber,
and some brought beautiful horses; but the boy had nothing, though he
was the son of a princess, for his mother had nothing to give him. Then
the rest of the company began to laugh at him, and the King said: “If
you have nothing else to give, at least you might go and fetch the
Terrible Head.”

The boy was proud, and spoke without thinking:

“Then I swear that I _will_ bring the Terrible Head, if it may be
brought by a living man. But of what head you speak I know not.”

Then they told him that somewhere, a long way off, there dwelt three
dreadful sisters, monstrous ogrish women, with golden wings and claws
of brass, and with serpents growing on their heads instead of hair. Now
these women were so awful to look on that whoever saw them was turned
at once into stone. And two of them could not be put to death, but the
youngest, whose face was very beautiful, could be killed, and it was
_her_ head that the boy had promised to bring. You may imagine it was no
easy adventure.

When he heard all this he was perhaps sorry that he had sworn to bring
the Terrible Head, but he was determined to keep his oath. So he went
out from the feast, where they all sat drinking and making merry, and
he walked alone beside the sea in the dusk of the evening, at the place
where the great chest, with himself and his mother in it, had been cast
ashore.

There he went and sat down on a rock, looking toward the sea, and
wondering how he should begin to fulfill his vow. Then he felt some one
touch him on the shoulder; and he turned, and saw a young man like a
king’s son, having with him a tall and beautiful lady, whose blue eyes
shone like stars. They were taller than mortal men, and the young man
had a staff in his hand with golden wings on it, and two golden serpents
twisted round it, and he had wings on his cap and on his shoes. He spoke
to the boy, and asked him why he was so unhappy; and the boy told him
how he had sworn to bring the Terrible Head, and knew not how to begin
to set about the adventure.

Then the beautiful lady also spoke, and said that “it was a foolish oath
and a hasty, but it might be kept if a brave man had sworn it.” Then the
boy answered that he was not afraid, if only he knew the way.

Then the lady said that to kill the dreadful woman with the golden wings
and the brass claws, and to cut off her head, he needed three things:
first, a Cap of Darkness, which would make him invisible when he wore
it; next, a Sword of Sharpness, which would cleave iron at one blow; and
last, the Shoes of Swiftness, with which he might fly in the air.

The boy answered that he knew not where such things were to be procured,
and that, wanting them, he could only try and fail. Then the young man,
taking off his own shoes, said: “First, you shall use these shoes till
you have taken the Terrible Head, and then you must give them back to
me. And with these shoes you will fly as fleet as a bird, or a thought,
over the land or over the waves of the sea, wherever the shoes know the
way. But there are ways which they do not know, roads beyond the borders
of the world. And these roads have you to travel. Now first you must
go to the Three Gray Sisters, who live far off in the north, and are so
very cold that they have only one eye and one tooth among the three. You
must creep up close to them, and as one of them passes the eye to the
other you must seize it, and refuse to give it up till they have told
you the way to the Three Fairies of the Garden, and _they_ will give you
the Cap of Darkness and the Sword of Sharpness, and show you how to wing
beyond this world to the land of the Terrible Head.”

Then the beautiful lady said: “Go forth at once, and do not return to
say good-by to your mother, for these things must be done quickly, and
the Shoes of Swiftness themselves will carry you to the land of the
Three Gray Sisters--for they know the measure of that way.”

So the boy thanked her, and he fastened on the Shoes of Swiftness, and
turned to say good-by to the young man and the lady. But, behold! they
had vanished, he knew not how or where! Then he leaped in the air to try
the Shoes of Swiftness, and they carried him more swiftly than the wind,
over the warm blue sea, over the happy lands of the south, over the
northern peoples who drank mare’s milk and lived in great wagons,
wandering after their flocks. Across the wide rivers, where the wild
fowl rose and fled before him, and over the plains and the cold North
Sea he went, over the fields of snow and the hills of ice, to a place
where the world ends, and all water is frozen, and there are no men, nor
beasts, nor any green grass. There in a blue cave of the ice he found
the Three Gray Sisters, the oldest of living things. Their hair was as
white as the snow, and their flesh of an icy blue, and they mumbled and
nodded in a kind of dream, and their frozen breath hung round them like
a cloud. Now the opening of the cave in the ice was narrow, and it
was not easy to pass in without touching one of the Gray Sisters. But,
floating on the Shoes of Swiftness, the boy just managed to steal in,
and waited till one of the sisters said to another, who had their one
eye:

“Sister, what do you see? do you see old times coming back?”

“No, sister.”

“Then give _me_ the eye, for perhaps I can see farther than you.”

Then the first sister passed the eye to the second, but as the second
groped for it the boy caught it cleverly out of her hand.

“Where is the eye, sister?” said the second gray woman.

“You have taken it yourself, sister,” said the first gray woman.

“Have you lost the eye, sister? have you lost the eye?” said the third
gray woman; “shall we _never_ find it again, and see old times coming
back?”

Then the boy slipped from behind them out of the cold cave into the air,
and he laughed aloud.

When the gray women heard that laugh they began to weep, for now they
knew that a stranger had robbed them, and that they could not help
themselves, and their tears froze as they fell from the hollows where no
eyes were, and rattled on the icy ground of the cave. Then they began to
implore the boy to give them their eye back again, and he could not help
being sorry for them, they were so pitiful. But he said he would never
give them the eye till they told him the way to the Fairies of the
Garden.

Then they wrung their hands miserably, for they guessed why he had come,
and how he was going to try to win the Terrible Head. Now the Dreadful
Women were akin to the Three Gray Sisters, and it was hard for them to
tell the boy the way. But at last they told him to keep always south,
and with the land on his left and the sea on his right, till he reached
the Island of the Fairies of the Garden. Then he gave them back the
eye, and they began to look out once more for the old times coming back
again. But the boy flew south between sea and land, keeping the land
always on his left hand, till he saw a beautiful island crowned with
flowering trees. There he alighted, and there he found the Three Fairies
of the Garden. They were like three very beautiful young women, dressed
one in green, one in white, and one in red, and they were dancing and
singing round an apple tree with apples of gold, and this was their
song:


     Round and round the apples of gold,
       Round and round dance we;
     Thus do we dance from the days of old
       About the enchanted tree;
     Round, and round, and round we go,
     While the spring is green, or the stream shall flow,
       Or the wind shall stir the sea!

     There is none may taste of the golden fruit
       Till the golden new time come
     Many a tree shall spring from shoot,
     Many a blossom be withered at root,
       Many a song be dumb;
     Broken and still shall be many a lute
       Or ever the new times come!

     Round and round the tree of gold,
       Round and round dance we,
     So doth the great world spin from of old,
     Summer and winter, and fire and cold,
     Song that is sung, and tale that is told,
     Even as we dance, that fold and unfold
       Round the stem of the fairy tree!


These grave dancing fairies were very unlike the Grey Women, and they
were glad to see the boy, and treated him kindly. Then they asked him
why he had come; and he told them how he was sent to find the Sword of
Sharpness and the Cap of Darkness. And the fairies gave him these, and
a wallet, and a shield, and belted the sword, which had a diamond blade,
round his waist, and the cap they set on his head, and told him that now
even they could not see him though they were fairies. Then he took it
off, and they each kissed him and wished him good fortune, and then they
began again their eternal dance round the golden tree, for it is their
business to guard it till the new times come, or till the world’s
ending. So the boy put the cap on his head, and hung the wallet round
his waist, and the shining shield on his shoulders, and flew beyond the
great river that lies coiled like a serpent round the whole world. And
by the banks of that river, there he found the three Terrible Women all
asleep beneath a poplar tree, and the dead poplar leaves lay all about
them. Their golden wings were folded and their brass claws were crossed,
and two of them slept with their hideous heads beneath their wings
like birds, and the serpents in their hair writhed out from under the
feathers of gold. But the youngest slept between her two sisters, and
she lay on her back, with her beautiful sad face turned to the sky; and
though she slept her eyes were wide open. If the boy had seen her he
would have been changed into stone by the terror and the pity of it,
she was so awful; but he had thought of a plan for killing her without
looking on her face. As soon as he caught sight of the three from far
off he took his shining shield from his shoulders, and held it up like
a mirror, so that he saw the Dreadful Women reflected in it, and did not
see the Terrible Head itself. Then he came nearer and nearer, till he
reckoned that he was within a sword’s stroke of the youngest, and he
guessed where he should strike a back blow behind him. Then he drew the
Sword of Sharpness and struck once, and the Terrible Head was cut from
the shoulders of the creature, and the blood leaped out and struck him
like a blow. But he thrust the Terrible Head into his wallet, and flew
away without looking behind. Then the two Dreadful Sisters who were left
wakened, and rose in the air like great birds; and though they could not
see him because of his Cap of Darkness, they flew after him up the wind,
following by the scent through the clouds, like hounds hunting in a
wood. They came so close that he could hear the clatter of their golden
wings, and their shrieks to each other: “_here, here,_” “_no, there;
this way he went,_” as they chased him. But the Shoes of Swiftness flew
too fast for them, and at last their cries and the rattle of their wings
died away as he crossed the great river that runs round the world.

Now when the horrible creatures were far in the distance, and the boy
found himself on the right side of the river, he flew straight eastward,
trying to seek his own country. But as he looked down from the air he
saw a very strange sight--a beautiful girl chained to a stake at the
high-water mark of the sea. The girl was so frightened or so tired that
she was only prevented from falling by the iron chain about her waist,
and there she hung, as if she were dead. The boy was very sorry for her
and flew down and stood beside her. When he spoke she raised her head
and looked round, but his voice only seemed to frighten her. Then he
remembered that he was wearing the Cap of Darkness, and that she could
only hear him, not see him. So he took it off, and there he stood before
her, the handsomest young man she had ever seen in all her life, with
short curly yellow hair, and blue eyes, and a laughing face. And he
thought her the most beautiful girl in the world. So first with one blow
of the Sword of Sharpness he cut the iron chain that bound her, and then
he asked her what she did there, and why men treated her so cruelly. And
she told him that she was the daughter of the King of that country, and
that she was tied there to be eaten by a monstrous beast out of the sea;
for the beast came and devoured a girl every day. Now the lot had fallen
on her; and as she was just saying this a long fierce head of a cruel
sea creature rose out of the waves and snapped at the girl. But the
beast had been too greedy and too hurried, so he missed his aim the
first time. Before he could rise and bite again the boy had whipped the
Terrible Head out of his wallet and held it up. And when the sea beast
leaped out once more its eyes fell on the head, and instantly it was
turned into a stone. And the stone beast is there on the sea-coast to
this day.

Then the boy and the girl went to the palace of the King, her father,
where everyone was weeping for her death, and they could hardly believe
their eyes when they saw her come back well. And the King and Queen made
much of the boy, and could not contain themselves for delight when they
found he wanted to marry their daughter. So the two were married with
the most splendid rejoicings, and when they had passed some time at
court they went home in a ship to the boy’s own country. For he could
not carry his bride through the air, so he took the Shoes of Swiftness,
and the Cap of Darkness, and the Sword of Sharpness up to a lonely place
in the hills. There he left them, and there they were found by the man
and woman who had met him at home beside the sea, and had helped him to
start on his journey.

When this had been done the boy and his bride set forth for home, and
landed at the harbor of his native land. But whom should he meet in the
very street of the town but his own mother, flying for her life from the
wicked King, who now wished to kill her because he found that she would
never marry him! For if she had liked the King ill before, she liked him
far worse now that he had caused her son to disappear so suddenly. She
did not know, of course, where the boy had gone, but thought the King
had slain him secretly. So now she was running for her very life,
and the wicked King was following her with a sword in his hand. Then,
behold! she ran into her son’s very arms, but he had only time to kiss
her and step in front of her, when the King struck at him with his
sword. The boy caught the blow on his shield, and cried to the King:

“I swore to bring you the Terrible Head, and see how I keep my oath!”

Then he drew forth the head from his wallet, and when the King’s eyes
fell on it, instantly he was turned into stone, just as he stood there
with his sword lifted!

Now all the people rejoiced, because the wicked King should rule them no
longer. And they asked the boy to be their king, but he said no, he must
take his mother home to her father’s house. So the people chose for king
the man who had been kind to his mother when first she was cast on the
island in the great chest.

Presently the boy and his mother and his wife set sail for his mother’s
own country, from which she had been driven so unkindly. But on the way
they stayed at the court of a king, and it happened that he was
holding games, and giving prizes to the best runners, boxers, and
quoit-throwers. Then the boy would try his strength with the rest, but
he threw the quoit so far that it went beyond what had ever been thrown
before, and fell in the crowd, striking a man so that he died. Now this
man was no other than the father of the boy’s mother, who had fled away
from his own kingdom for fear his grandson should find him and kill him
after all. Thus he was destroyed by his own cowardice and by chance, and
thus the prophecy was fulfilled. But the boy and his wife and his mother
went back to the kingdom that was theirs, and lived long and happily
after all their troubles.



Once upon a time there was a princess who was the prettiest creature in
the world. And because she was so beautiful, and because her hair was
like the finest gold, and waved and rippled nearly to the ground, she
was called Pretty Goldilocks. She always wore a crown of flowers, and
her dresses were embroidered with diamonds and pearls, and everybody who
saw her fell in love with her.

Now one of her neighbors was a young king who was not married. He was
very rich and handsome, and when he heard all that was said about Pretty
Goldilocks, though he had never seen her, he fell so deeply in love
with her that he could neither eat nor drink. So he resolved to send an
ambassador to ask her in marriage. He had a splendid carriage made for
his ambassador, and gave him more than a hundred horses and a hundred
servants, and told him to be sure and bring the Princess back with him.
After he had started nothing else was talked of at Court, and the King
felt so sure that the Princess would consent that he set his people to
work at pretty dresses and splendid furniture, that they might be
ready by the time she came. Meanwhile, the ambassador arrived at the
Princess’s palace and delivered his little message, but whether she
happened to be cross that day, or whether the compliment did not please
her, is not known. She only answered that she was very much obliged
to the King, but she had no wish to be married. The ambassador set off
sadly on his homeward way, bringing all the King’s presents back with
him, for the Princess was too well brought up to accept the pearls
and diamonds when she would not accept the King, so she had only kept
twenty-five English pins that he might not be vexed.

When the ambassador reached the city, where the King was waiting
impatiently, everybody was very much annoyed with him for not bringing
the Princess, and the King cried like a baby, and nobody could console
him. Now there was at the Court a young man, who was more clever and
handsome than anyone else. He was called Charming, and everyone loved
him, excepting a few envious people who were angry at his being the
King’s favorite and knowing all the State secrets. He happened to one
day be with some people who were speaking of the ambassador’s return
and saying that his going to the Princess had not done much good, when
Charming said rashly:

“If the King had sent me to the Princess Goldilocks I am sure she would
have come back with me.”

His enemies at once went to the King and said:

“You will hardly believe, sire, what Charming has the audacity to
say--that if _he_ had been sent to the Princess Goldilocks she would
certainly have come back with him. He seems to think that he is so much
handsomer than you that the Princess would have fallen in love with him
and followed him willingly.” The King was very angry when he heard this.

“Ha, ha!” said he; “does he laugh at my unhappiness, and think himself
more fascinating than I am? Go, and let him be shut up in my great tower
to die of hunger.”

So the King’s guards went to fetch Charming, who had thought no more of
his rash speech, and carried him off to prison with great cruelty. The
poor prisoner had only a little straw for his bed, and but for a little
stream of water which flowed through the tower he would have died of
thirst.

One day when he was in despair he said to himself:

“How can I have offended the King? I am his most faithful subject, and
have done nothing against him.”

The King chanced to be passing the tower and recognized the voice of his
former favorite. He stopped to listen in spite of Charming’s enemies,
who tried to persuade him to have nothing more to do with the traitor.
But the King said:

“Be quiet, I wish to hear what he says.”

And then he opened the tower door and called to Charming, who came very
sadly and kissed the King’s hand, saying:

“What have I done, sire, to deserve this cruel treatment?”

“You mocked me and my ambassador,” said the King, “and you said that
if I had sent you for the Princess Goldilocks you would certainly have
brought her back.”

“It is quite true, sire,” replied Charming; “I should have drawn such a
picture of you, and represented your good qualities in such a way,
that I am certain the Princess would have found you irresistible. But I
cannot see what there is in that to make you angry.”

The King could not see any cause for anger either when the matter was
presented to him in this light, and he began to frown very fiercely at
the courtiers who had so misrepresented his favorite.

So he took Charming back to the palace with him, and after seeing that
he had a very good supper he said to him:

“You know that I love Pretty Goldilocks as much as ever, her refusal has
not made any difference to me; but I don’t know how to make her change
her mind; I really should like to send you, to see if you can persuade
her to marry me.”

Charming replied that he was perfectly willing to go, and would set out
the very next day.

“But you must wait till I can get a grand escort for you,” said the
King. But Charming said that he only wanted a good horse to ride, and
the King, who was delighted at his being ready to start so promptly,
gave him letters to the Princess, and bade him good speed. It was on a
Monday morning that he set out all alone upon his errand, thinking of
nothing but how he could persuade the Princess Goldilocks to marry
the King. He had a writing-book in his pocket, and whenever any happy
thought struck him he dismounted from his horse and sat down under
the trees to put it into the harangue which he was preparing for the
Princess, before he forgot it.

One day when he had started at the very earliest dawn, and was riding
over a great meadow, he suddenly had a capital idea, and, springing from
his horse, he sat down under a willow tree which grew by a little river.
When he had written it down he was looking round him, pleased to find
himself in such a pretty place, when all at once he saw a great golden
carp lying gasping and exhausted upon the grass. In leaping after little
flies she had thrown herself high upon the bank, where she had lain till
she was nearly dead. Charming had pity upon her, and, though he couldn’t
help thinking that she would have been very nice for dinner, he picked
her up gently and put her back into the water. As soon as Dame Carp
felt the refreshing coolness of the water she sank down joyfully to the
bottom of the river, then, swimming up to the bank quite boldly, she
said:

“I thank you, Charming, for the kindness you have done me. You have
saved my life; one day I will repay you.” So saying, she sank down into
the water again, leaving Charming greatly astonished at her politeness.

Another day, as he journeyed on, he saw a raven in great distress. The
poor bird was closely pursued by an eagle, which would soon have eaten
it up, had not Charming quickly fitted an arrow to his bow and shot the
eagle dead. The raven perched upon a tree very joyfully.

“Charming,” said he, “it was very generous of you to rescue a poor
raven; I am not ungrateful, some day I will repay you.”

Charming thought it was very nice of the raven to say so, and went on
his way.

Before the sun rose he found himself in a thick wood where it was too
dark for him to see his path, and here he heard an owl crying as if it
were in despair.

“Hark!” said he, “that must be an owl in great trouble, I am sure it has
gone into a snare”; and he began to hunt about, and presently found a
great net which some bird-catchers had spread the night before.

“What a pity it is that men do nothing but torment and persecute poor
creatures which never do them any harm!” said he, and he took out his
knife and cut the cords of the net, and the owl flitted away into the
darkness, but then turning, with one flicker of her wings, she came back
to Charming and said:

“It does not need many words to tell you how great a service you have
done me. I was caught; in a few minutes the fowlers would have been
here--without your help I should have been killed. I am grateful, and
one day I will repay you.”

These three adventures were the only ones of any consequence that befell
Charming upon his journey, and he made all the haste he could to reach
the palace of the Princess Goldilocks.

When he arrived he thought everything he saw delightful and magnificent.
Diamonds were as plentiful as pebbles, and the gold and silver, the
beautiful dresses, the sweetmeats and pretty things that were everywhere
quite amazed him; he thought to himself: “If the Princess consents to
leave all this, and come with me to marry the King, he may think himself
lucky!”

Then he dressed himself carefully in rich brocade, with scarlet and
white plumes, and threw a splendid embroidered scarf over his shoulder,
and, looking as gay and as graceful as possible, he presented himself at
the door of the palace, carrying in his arm a tiny pretty dog which
he had bought on the way. The guards saluted him respectfully, and a
messenger was sent to the Princess to announce the arrival of Charming
as ambassador of her neighbor the King.

“Charming,” said the Princess, “the name promises well; I have no doubt
that he is good looking and fascinates everybody.”

“Indeed he does, madam,” said all her maids of honor in one breath. “We
saw him from the window of the garret where we were spinning flax, and
we could do nothing but look at him as long as he was in sight.”

“Well to be sure,” said the Princess, “that’s how you amuse yourselves,
is it? Looking at strangers out of the window! Be quick and give me my
blue satin embroidered dress, and comb out my golden hair. Let somebody
make me fresh garlands of flowers, and give me my high-heeled shoes and
my fan, and tell them to sweep my great hall and my throne, for I want
everyone to say I am really ‘Pretty Goldilocks.’”

You can imagine how all her maids scurried this way and that to make the
Princess ready, and how in their haste they knocked their heads together
and hindered each other, till she thought they would never have done.
However, at last they led her into the gallery of mirrors that she might
assure herself that nothing was lacking in her appearance, and then
she mounted her throne of gold, ebony, and ivory, while her ladies took
their guitars and began to sing softly. Then Charming was led in, and
was so struck with astonishment and admiration that at first not a word
could he say. But presently he took courage and delivered his harangue,
bravely ending by begging the Princess to spare him the disappointment
of going back without her.

“Sir Charming,” answered she, “all the reasons you have given me are
very good ones, and I assure you that I should have more pleasure in
obliging you than anyone else, but you must know that a month ago as I
was walking by the river with my ladies I took off my glove, and as I
did so a ring that I was wearing slipped off my finger and rolled into
the water. As I valued it more than my kingdom, you may imagine how
vexed I was at losing it, and I vowed to never listen to any proposal of
marriage unless the ambassador first brought me back my ring. So now
you know what is expected of you, for if you talked for fifteen days and
fifteen nights you could not make me change my mind.”

Charming was very much surprised by this answer, but he bowed low to the
Princess, and begged her to accept the embroidered scarf and the tiny
dog he had brought with him. But she answered that she did not want any
presents, and that he was to remember what she had just told him. When
he got back to his lodging he went to bed without eating any supper, and
his little dog, who was called Frisk, couldn’t eat any either, but came
and lay down close to him. All night Charming sighed and lamented.

“How am I to find a ring that fell into the river a month ago?” said
he. “It is useless to try; the Princess must have told me to do it on
purpose, knowing it was impossible.” And then he sighed again.

Frisk heard him and said:

“My dear master, don’t despair; the luck may change, you are too good
not to be happy. Let us go down to the river as soon as it is light.”

But Charming only gave him two little pats and said nothing, and very
soon he fell asleep.

At the first glimmer of dawn Frisk began to jump about, and when he had
waked Charming they went out together, first into the garden, and then
down to the river’s brink, where they wandered up and down. Charming was
thinking sadly of having to go back unsuccessful when he heard someone
calling: “Charming, Charming!” He looked all about him and thought he
must be dreaming, as he could not see anybody. Then he walked on and the
voice called again: “Charming, Charming!”

“Who calls me?” said he. Frisk, who was very small and could look
closely into the water, cried out: “I see a golden carp coming.” And
sure enough there was the great carp, who said to Charming:

“You saved my life in the meadow by the willow tree, and I promised that
I would repay you. Take this, it is Princess Goldilock’s ring.” Charming
took the ring out of Dame Carp’s mouth, thanking her a thousand times,
and he and tiny Frisk went straight to the palace, where someone told
the Princess that he was asking to see her.

“Ah! poor fellow,” said she, “he must have come to say good-by, finding
it impossible to do as I asked.”

So in came Charming, who presented her with the ring and said:

“Madam, I have done your bidding. Will it please you to marry my
master?” When the Princess saw her ring brought back to her unhurt she
was so astonished that she thought she must be dreaming.

“Truly, Charming,” said she, “you must be the favorite of some fairy, or
you could never have found it.”

“Madam,” answered he, “I was helped by nothing but my desire to obey
your wishes.”

“Since you are so kind,” said she, “perhaps you will do me another
service, for till it is done I will never be married. There is a prince
not far from here whose name is Galifron, who once wanted to marry me,
but when I refused he uttered the most terrible threats against me, and
vowed that he would lay waste my country. But what could I do? I could
not marry a frightful giant as tall as a tower, who eats up people as
a monkey eats chestnuts, and who talks so loud that anybody who has to
listen to him becomes quite deaf. Nevertheless, he does not cease to
persecute me and to kill my subjects. So before I can listen to your
proposal you must kill him and bring me his head.”

Charming was rather dismayed at this command, but he answered:

“Very well, Princess, I will fight this Galifron; I believe that he will
kill me, but at any rate I shall die in your defense.”

Then the Princess was frightened and said everything she could think of
to prevent Charming from fighting the giant, but it was of no use, and
he went out to arm himself suitably, and then, taking little Frisk with
him, he mounted his horse and set out for Galifron’s country. Everyone
he met told him what a terrible giant Galifron was, and that nobody
dared go near him; and the more he heard, the more frightened he grew.
Frisk tried to encourage him by saying: “While you are fighting the
giant, dear master, I will go and bite his heels, and when he stoops
down to look at me you can kill him.”

Charming praised his little dog’s plan, but knew that this help would
not do much good.

At last he drew near the giant’s castle, and saw to his horror that
every path that led to it was strewn with bones. Before long he saw
Galifron coming. His head was higher than the tallest trees, and he sang
in a terrible voice:

  “Bring out your little boys and girls,
  Pray do not stay to do their curls,
  For I shall eat so very many,
  I shall not know if they have any.”


Thereupon Charming sang out as loud as he could to the same tune:

  “Come out and meet the valiant Charming
  Who finds you not at all alarming;
  Although he is not very tall,
  He’s big enough to make you fall.”


The rhymes were not very correct, but you see he had made them up so
quickly that it is a miracle that they were not worse; especially as he
was horribly frightened all the time. When Galifron heard these words he
looked all about him, and saw Charming standing, sword in hand this put
the giant into a terrible rage, and he aimed a blow at Charming with his
huge iron club, which would certainly have killed him if it had reached
him, but at that instant a raven perched upon the giant’s head, and,
pecking with its strong beak and beating with its great wings so
confused and blinded him that all his blows fell harmlessly upon the
air, and Charming, rushing in, gave him several strokes with his sharp
sword so that he fell to the ground. Whereupon Charming cut off his head
before he knew anything about it, and the raven from a tree close by
croaked out:

“You see I have not forgotten the good turn you did me in killing the
eagle. To-day I think I have fulfilled my promise of repaying you.”

“Indeed, I owe you more gratitude than you ever owed me,” replied
Charming.

And then he mounted his horse and rode off with Galifron’s head.

When he reached the city the people ran after him in crowds, crying:

“Behold the brave Charming, who has killed the giant!” And their shouts
reached the Princess’s ear, but she dared not ask what was happening,
for fear she should hear that Charming had been killed. But very soon
he arrived at the palace with the giant’s head, of which she was still
terrified, though it could no longer do her any harm.

“Princess,” said Charming, “I have killed your enemy; I hope you will
now consent to marry the King my master.”

“Oh dear! no,” said the Princess, “not until you have brought me some
water from the Gloomy Cavern.

“Not far from here there is a deep cave, the entrance to which is
guarded by two dragons with fiery eyes, who will not allow anyone to
pass them. When you get into the cavern you will find an immense hole,
which you must go down, and it is full of toads and snakes; at the
bottom of this hole there is another little cave, in which rises the
Fountain of Health and Beauty. It is some of this water that I really
must have: everything it touches becomes wonderful. The beautiful things
will always remain beautiful, and the ugly things become lovely. If one
is young one never grows old, and if one is old one becomes young. You
see, Charming, I could not leave my kingdom without taking some of it
with me.”

“Princess,” said he, “you at least can never need this water, but I am
an unhappy ambassador, whose death you desire. Where you send me I will
go, though I know I shall never return.”

And, as the Princess Goldilocks showed no sign of relenting, he started
with his little dog for the Gloomy Cavern. Everyone he met on the way
said:

“What a pity that a handsome young man should throw away his life so
carelessly! He is going to the cavern alone, though if he had a
hundred men with him he could not succeed. Why does the Princess ask
impossibilities?” Charming said nothing, but he was very sad. When he
was near the top of a hill he dismounted to let his horse graze, while
Frisk amused himself by chasing flies. Charming knew he could not be far
from the Gloomy Cavern, and on looking about him he saw a black hideous
rock from which came a thick smoke, followed in a moment by one of the
dragons with fire blazing from his mouth and eyes. His body was yellow
and green, and his claws scarlet, and his tail was so long that it lay
in a hundred coils. Frisk was so terrified at the sight of it that he
did not know where to hide. Charming, quite determined to get the water
or die, now drew his sword, and, taking the crystal flask which Pretty
Goldilocks had given him to fill, said to Frisk:

“I feel sure that I shall never come back from this expedition; when I
am dead, go to the Princess and tell her that her errand has cost me
my life. Then find the King my master, and relate all my adventures to
him.”

As he spoke he heard a voice calling: “Charming, Charming!”

“Who calls me?” said he; then he saw an owl sitting in a hollow tree,
who said to him:

“You saved my life when I was caught in the net, now I can repay you.
Trust me with the flask, for I know all the ways of the Gloomy Cavern,
and can fill it from the Fountain of Beauty.” Charming was only too glad
to give her the flask, and she flitted into the cavern quite unnoticed
by the dragon, and after some time returned with the flask, filled to
the very brim with sparkling water. Charming thanked her with all his
heart, and joyfully hastened back to the town.

He went straight to the palace and gave the flask to the Princess, who
had no further objection to make. So she thanked Charming, and ordered
that preparations should be made for her departure, and they soon set
out together. The Princess found Charming such an agreeable companion
that she sometimes said to him: “Why didn’t we stay where we were? I
could have made you king, and we should have been so happy!”

But Charming only answered:

“I could not have done anything that would have vexed my master so
much, even for a kingdom, or to please you, though I think you are as
beautiful as the sun.”

At last they reached the King’s great city, and he came out to meet the
Princess, bringing magnificent presents, and the marriage was celebrated
with great rejoicings. But Goldilocks was so fond of Charming that she
could not be happy unless he was near her, and she was always singing
his praises.

“If it hadn’t been for Charming,” she said to the King, “I should never
have come here; you ought to be very much obliged to him, for he did the
most impossible things and got me water from the Fountain of Beauty, so
I can never grow old, and shall get prettier every year.”

Then Charming’s enemies said to the King:

“It is a wonder that you are not jealous, the Queen thinks there is
nobody in the world like Charming. As if anybody you had sent could not
have done just as much!”

“It is quite true, now I come to think of it,” said the King. “Let him
be chained hand and foot, and thrown into the tower.”

So they took Charming, and as a reward for having served the King so
faithfully he was shut up in the tower, where he only saw the jailer,
who brought him a piece of black bread and a pitcher of water every day.

However, little Frisk came to console him, and told him all the news.

When Pretty Goldilocks heard what had happened she threw herself at the
King’s feet and begged him to set Charming free, but the more she cried,
the more angry he was, and at last she saw that it was useless to say
any more; but it made her very sad. Then the King took it into his
head that perhaps he was not handsome enough to please the Princess
Goldilocks, and he thought he would bathe his face with the water
from the Fountain of Beauty, which was in the flask on a shelf in the
Princess’s room, where she had placed it that she might see it often.
Now it happened that one of the Princess’s ladies in chasing a spider
had knocked the flask off the shelf and broken it, and every drop of the
water had been spilt. Not knowing what to do, she had hastily swept away
the pieces of crystal, and then remembered that in the King’s room she
had seen a flask of exactly the same shape, also filled with sparkling
water. So, without saying a word, she fetched it and stood it upon the
Queen’s shelf.

Now the water in this flask was what was used in the kingdom for getting
rid of troublesome people. Instead of having their heads cut off in the
usual way, their faces were bathed with the water, and they instantly
fell asleep and never woke up any more. So, when the King, thinking
to improve his beauty, took the flask and sprinkled the water upon his
face, _he_ fell asleep, and nobody could wake him.

Little Frisk was the first to hear the news, and he ran to tell
Charming, who sent him to beg the Princess not to forget the poor
prisoner. All the palace was in confusion on account of the King’s
death, but tiny Frisk made his way through the crowd to the Princess’s
side, and said:

“Madam, do not forget poor Charming.”

Then she remembered all he had done for her, and without saying a word
to anyone went straight to the tower, and with her own hands took off
Charming’s chains. Then, putting a golden crown upon his head, and the
royal mantle upon his shoulders, she said:

“Come, faithful Charming, I make you king, and will take you for my
husband.”

Charming, once more free and happy, fell at her feet and thanked her for
her gracious words.

Everybody was delighted that he should be king, and the wedding, which
took place at once, was the prettiest that can be imagined, and Prince
Charming and Princess Goldilocks lived happily ever after.



Dick Whittington was a very little boy when his father and mother died;
so little, indeed, that he never knew them, nor the place where he was
born. He strolled about the country as ragged as a colt, till he met
with a wagoner who was going to London, and who gave him leave to walk
all the way by the side of his wagon without paying anything for his
passage. This pleased little Whittington very much, as he wanted to see
London sadly, for he had heard that the streets were paved with
gold, and he was willing to get a bushel of it; but how great was his
disappointment, poor boy! when he saw the streets covered with dirt
instead of gold, and found himself in a strange place, without a friend,
without food, and without money.

Though the wagoner was so charitable as to let him walk up by the side
of the wagon for nothing, he took care not to know him when he came to
town, and the poor boy was, in a little time, so cold and hungry that he
wished himself in a good kitchen and by a warm fire in the country.

In his distress he asked charity of several people, and one of them bid
him “Go to work for an idle rogue.” “That I will,” said Whittington,
“with all my heart; I will work for you if you will let me.”

The man, who thought this savored of wit and impertinence (though the
poor lad intended only to show his readiness to work), gave him a blow
with a stick which broke his head so that the blood ran down. In this
situation, and fainting for want of food, he laid himself down at the
door of one Mr. Fitzwarren, a merchant, where the cook saw him, and,
being an ill-natured hussy, ordered him to go about his business or she
would scald him. At this time Mr. Fitzwarren came from the Exchange, and
began also to scold at the poor boy, bidding him to go to work.

Whittington answered that he should be glad to work if anybody would
employ him, and that he should be able if he could get some victuals to
eat, for he had had nothing for three days, and he was a poor country
boy, and knew nobody, and nobody would employ him.

He then endeavored to get up, but he was so very weak that he fell down
again, which excited so much compassion in the merchant that he ordered
the servants to take him in and give him some meat and drink, and let
him help the cook to do any dirty work that she had to set him about.
People are too apt to reproach those who beg with being idle, but give
themselves no concern to put them in the way of getting business to do,
or considering whether they are able to do it, which is not charity.

But we return to Whittington, who could have lived happy in this worthy
family had he not been bumped about by the cross cook, who must be
always roasting and basting, or when the spit was idle employed her
hands upon poor Whittington! At last Miss Alice, his master’s daughter,
was informed of it, and then she took compassion on the poor boy, and
made the servants treat him kindly.

Besides the crossness of the cook, Whittington had another difficulty
to get over before he could be happy. He had, by order of his master, a
flock-bed placed for him in a garret, where there was a number of rats
and mice that often ran over the poor boy’s nose and disturbed him
in his sleep. After some time, however, a gentleman who came to his
master’s house gave Whittington a penny for brushing his shoes. This
he put into his pocket, being determined to lay it out to the best
advantage; and the next day, seeing a woman in the street with a cat
under her arm, he ran up to know the price of it. The woman (as the cat
was a good mouser) asked a deal of money for it, but on Whittington’s
telling her he had but a penny in the world, and that he wanted a cat
sadly, she let him have it.

This cat Whittington concealed in the garret, for fear she should be
beat about by his mortal enemy the cook, and here she soon killed or
frightened away the rats and mice, so that the poor boy could now sleep
as sound as a top.

Soon after this the merchant, who had a ship ready to sail, called
for his servants, as his custom was, in order that each of them might
venture something to try their luck; and whatever they sent was to pay
neither freight nor custom, for he thought justly that God Almighty
would bless him the more for his readiness to let the poor partake of
his fortune.

All the servants appeared but poor Whittington, who, having neither
money nor goods, could not think of sending anything to try his luck;
but his good friend Miss Alice, thinking his poverty kept him away,
ordered him to be called.

She then offered to lay down something for him, but the merchant told
his daughter that would not do, it must be something of his own. Upon
which poor Whittington said he had nothing but a cat which he bought
for a penny that was given him. “Fetch thy cat, boy,” said the merchant,
“and send her.” Whittington brought poor puss and delivered her to the
captain, with tears in his eyes, for he said he should now be disturbed
by the rats and mice as much as ever. All the company laughed at
the adventure but Miss Alice, who pitied the poor boy, and gave him
something to buy another cat.

While puss was beating the billows at sea, poor Whittington was severely
beaten at home by his tyrannical mistress the cook, who used him so
cruelly, and made such game of him for sending his cat to sea, that
at last the poor boy determined to run away from his place, and having
packed up the few things he had, he set out very early in the morning on
All-Hallows day. He traveled as far as Holloway, and there sat down on
a stone to consider what course he should take; but while he was thus
ruminating, Bow bells, of which there were only six, began to ring; and
he thought their sounds addressed him in this manner:

  “Turn again, Whittington,
  Thrice Lord Mayor of London.”


“Lord Mayor of London!” said he to himself, “what would not one endure
to be Lord Mayor of London, and ride in such a fine coach? Well, I’ll go
back again, and bear all the pummelling and ill-usage of Cicely rather
than miss the opportunity of being Lord Mayor!” So home he went, and
happily got into the house and about his business before Mrs. Cicely
made her appearance.

We must now follow Miss Puss to the coast of Africa. How perilous are
voyages at sea, how uncertain the winds and the waves, and how many
accidents attend a naval life!

The ship that had the cat on board was long beaten at sea, and at last,
by contrary winds, driven on a part of the coast of Barbary which was
inhabited by Moors unknown to the English. These people received our
countrymen with civility, and therefore the captain, in order to trade
with them, showed them the patterns of the goods he had on board, and
sent some of them to the King of the country, who was so well pleased
that he sent for the captain and the factor to come to his palace, which
was about a mile from the sea. Here they were placed, according to the
custom of the country, on rich carpets, flowered with gold and silver;
and the King and Queen being seated at the upper end of the room, dinner
was brought in, which consisted of many dishes; but no sooner were the
dishes put down but an amazing number of rats and mice came from all
quarters and devoured all the meat in an instant.

The factor, in surprise, turned round to the nobles and asked if these
vermin were not offensive. “Oh! yes,” said they, “very offensive; and
the King would give half his treasure to be freed of them, for they
not only destroy his dinner, as you see, but they assault him in his
chamber, and even in bed, so that he is obliged to be watched while he
is sleeping, for fear of them.”

The factor jumped for joy; he remembered poor Whittington and his
cat, and told the King he had a creature on board the ship that would
despatch all these vermin immediately. The King’s heart heaved so high
at the joy which this news gave him that his turban dropped off his
head. “Bring this creature to me,” said he; “vermin are dreadful in a
court, and if she will perform what you say I will load your ship with
gold and jewels in exchange for her.” The factor, who knew his business,
took this opportunity to set forth the merits of Miss Puss. He told his
Majesty that it would be inconvenient to part with her, as, when she
was gone, the rats and mice might destroy the goods in the ship--but to
oblige his Majesty he would fetch her. “Run, run,” said the Queen; “I am
impatient to see the dear creature.”

Away flew the factor, while another dinner was providing, and returned
with the cat just as the rats and mice were devouring that also. He
immediately put down Miss Puss, who killed a great number of them.

The King rejoiced greatly to see his old enemies destroyed by so small a
creature, and the Queen was highly pleased, and desired the cat might
be brought near that she might look at her. Upon which the factor called
“Pussy, pussy, pussy!” and she came to him. He then presented her to the
Queen, who started back, and was afraid to touch a creature who had made
such havoc among the rats and mice; however, when the factor stroked
the cat and called “Pussy, pussy!” the Queen also touched her and cried
“Putty, putty!” for she had not learned English.

He then put her down on the Queen’s lap, where she, purring, played with
her Majesty’s hand, and then sang herself to sleep.

The King, having seen the exploits of Miss Puss, and being informed that
her kittens would stock the whole country, bargained with the captain
and factor for the whole ship’s cargo, and then gave them ten times as
much for the cat as all the rest amounted to. On which, taking leave of
their Majesties and other great personages at court, they sailed with a
fair wind for England, whither we must now attend them.

The morn had scarcely dawned when Mr. Fitzwarren arose to count over
the cash and settle the business for that day. He had just entered the
counting-house, and seated himself at the desk, when somebody came,
tap, tap, at the door. “Who’s there?” said Mr. Fitzwarren. “A friend,”
 answered the other. “What friend can come at this unseasonable time?” “A
real friend is never unseasonable,” answered the other. “I come to bring
you good news of your ship Unicorn.” The merchant bustled up in such a
hurry that he forgot his gout; instantly opened the door, and who should
be seen waiting but the captain and factor, with a cabinet of jewels,
and a bill of lading, for which the merchant lifted up his eyes and
thanked heaven for sending him such a prosperous voyage. Then they told
him the adventures of the cat, and showed him the cabinet of jewels
which they had brought for Mr. Whittington. Upon which he cried out with
great earnestness, but not in the most poetical manner:

  “Go, send him in, and tell him of his fame,
  And call him Mr. Whittington by name.”


It is not our business to animadvert upon these lines; we are not
critics, but historians. It is sufficient for us that they are the words
of Mr. Fitzwarren; and though it is beside our purpose, and perhaps not
in our power to prove him a good poet, we shall soon convince the reader
that he was a good man, which was a much better character; for when some
who were present told him that this treasure was too much for such a
poor boy as Whittington, he said: “God forbid that I should deprive him
of a penny; it is his own, and he shall have it to a farthing.” He then
ordered Mr. Whittington in, who was at this time cleaning the kitchen
and would have excused himself from going into the counting-house,
saying the room was swept and his shoes were dirty and full of
hob-nails. The merchant, however, made him come in, and ordered a chair
to be set for him. Upon which, thinking they intended to make sport
of him, as had been too often the case in the kitchen, he besought his
master not to mock a poor simple fellow, who intended them no harm, but
let him go about his business. The merchant, taking him by the hand,
said: “Indeed, Mr. Whittington, I am in earnest with you, and sent for
you to congratulate you on your great success. Your cat has procured you
more money than I am worth in the world, and may you long enjoy it and
be happy!”

At length, being shown the treasure, and convinced by them that all of
it belonged to him, he fell upon his knees and thanked the Almighty for
his providential care of such a poor and miserable creature. He then
laid all the treasure at his master’s feet, who refused to take any part
of it, but told him he heartily rejoiced at his prosperity, and hoped
the wealth he had acquired would be a comfort to him, and would make
him happy. He then applied to his mistress, and to his good friend
Miss Alice, who refused to take any part of the money, but told him she
heartily rejoiced at his good success, and wished him all imaginable
felicity. He then gratified the captain, factor, and the ship’s crew for
the care they had taken of his cargo. He likewise distributed presents
to all the servants in the house, not forgetting even his old enemy the
cook, though she little deserved it.

After this Mr. Fitzwarren advised Mr. Whittington to send for the
necessary people and dress himself like a gentleman, and made him the
offer of his house to live in till he could provide himself with a
better.

Now it came to pass when Mr. Whittington’s face was washed, his hair
curled, and he dressed in a rich suit of clothes, that he turned out
a genteel young fellow; and, as wealth contributes much to give a man
confidence, he in a little time dropped that sheepish behavior which
was principally occasioned by a depression of spirits, and soon grew a
sprightly and good companion, insomuch that Miss Alice, who had formerly
pitied him, now fell in love with him.

When her father perceived they had this good liking for each other
he proposed a match between them, to which both parties cheerfully
consented, and the Lord Mayor, Court of Aldermen, Sheriffs, the Company
of Stationers, the Royal Academy of Arts, and a number of eminent
merchants attended the ceremony, and were elegantly treated at an
entertainment made for that purpose.

History further relates that they lived very happy, had several
children, and died at a good old age. Mr. Whittington served as Sheriff
of London and was three times Lord Mayor. In the last year of his
mayoralty he entertained King Henry V and his Queen, after his
conquest of France, upon which occasion the King, in consideration of
Whittington’s merit, said: “Never had prince such a subject”; which
being told to Whittington at the table, he replied: “Never had subject
such a king.” His Majesty, out of respect to his good character,
conferred the honor of knighthood on him soon after.

Sir Richard many years before his death constantly fed a great number
of poor citizens, built a church and a college to it, with a yearly
allowance for poor scholars, and near it erected a hospital.

He also built Newgate for criminals, and gave liberally to St.
Bartholomew’s Hospital and other public charities.



Once upon a time--in the days when the fairies lived--there was a king
who had three daughters, who were all young, and clever, and beautiful;
but the youngest of the three, who was called Miranda, was the prettiest
and the most beloved.

The King, her father, gave her more dresses and jewels in a month than
he gave the others in a year; but she was so generous that she shared
everything with her sisters, and they were all as happy and as fond of
one another as they could be.

Now, the King had some quarrelsome neighbors, who, tired of leaving him
in peace, began to make war upon him so fiercely that he feared he would
be altogether beaten if he did not make an effort to defend himself.
So he collected a great army and set off to fight them, leaving the
Princesses with their governess in a castle where news of the war was
brought every day--sometimes that the King had taken a town, or won a
battle, and, at last, that he had altogether overcome his enemies and
chased them out of his kingdom, and was coming back to the castle as
quickly as possible, to see his dear little Miranda whom he loved so
much.

The three Princesses put on dresses of satin, which they had had made
on purpose for this great occasion, one green, one blue, and the third
white; their jewels were the same colors. The eldest wore emeralds, the
second turquoises, and the youngest diamonds, and thus adorned they
went to meet the King, singing verses which they had composed about his
victories.

When he saw them all so beautiful and so gay he embraced them tenderly,
but gave Miranda more kisses than either of the others.

Presently a splendid banquet was served, and the King and his daughters
sat down to it, and as he always thought that there was some special
meaning in everything, he said to the eldest:

“Tell me why you have chosen a green dress.”

“Sire,” she answered, “having heard of your victories I thought that
green would signify my joy and the hope of your speedy return.”

“That is a very good answer,” said the King; “and you, my daughter,” he
continued, “why did you take a blue dress?”

“Sire,” said the Princess, “to show that we constantly hoped for your
success, and that the sight of you is as welcome to me as the sky with
its most beautiful stars.”

“Why,” said the King, “your wise answers astonish me, and you, Miranda.
What made you dress yourself all in white?

“Because, sire,” she answered, “white suits me better than anything
else.”

“What!” said the King angrily, “was that all you thought of, vain
child?”

“I thought you would be pleased with me,” said the Princess; “that was
all.”

The King, who loved her, was satisfied with this, and even pretended to
be pleased that she had not told him all her reasons at first.

“And now,” said he, “as I have supped well, and it is not time yet to go
to bed, tell me what you dreamed last night.”

The eldest said she had dreamed that he brought her a dress, and the
precious stones and gold embroidery on it were brighter than the sun.

The dream of the second was that the King had brought her a spinning
wheel and a distaff, that she might spin him some shirts.

But the youngest said: “I dreamed that my second sister was to be
married, and on her wedding-day, you, father, held a golden ewer and
said: ‘Come, Miranda, and I will hold the water that you may dip your
hands in it.’”

The King was very angry indeed when he heard this dream, and frowned
horribly; indeed, he made such an ugly face that everyone knew how angry
he was, and he got up and went off to bed in a great hurry; but he could
not forget his daughter’s dream.

“Does the proud girl wish to make me her slave?” he said to himself. “I
am not surprised at her choosing to dress herself in white satin without
a thought of me. She does not think me worthy of her consideration! But
I will soon put an end to her pretensions!”

He rose in a fury, and although it was not yet daylight, he sent for the
Captain of his Bodyguard, and said to him:

“You have heard the Princess Miranda’s dream? I consider that it means
strange things against me, therefore I order you to take her away into
the forest and kill her, and, that I may be sure it is done, you must
bring me her heart and her tongue. If you attempt to deceive me you
shall be put to death!”

The Captain of the Guard was very much astonished when he heard this
barbarous order, but he did not dare to contradict the King for fear of
making him still more angry, or causing him to send someone else, so he
answered that he would fetch the Princess and do as the King had said.
When he went to her room they would hardly let him in, it was so early,
but he said that the King had sent for Miranda, and she got up quickly
and came out; a little black girl called Patypata held up her train, and
her pet monkey and her little dog ran after her. The monkey was called
Grabugeon, and the little dog Tintin.

The Captain of the Guard begged Miranda to come down into the garden
where the King was enjoying the fresh air, and when they got there, he
pretended to search for him, but as he was not to be found, he said:

“No doubt his Majesty has strolled into the forest,” and he opened the
little door that led to it and they went through.

By this time the daylight had begun to appear, and the Princess, looking
at her conductor, saw that he had tears in his eyes and seemed too sad
to speak.

“What is the matter?” she said in the kindest way. “You seem very
sorrowful.”

“Alas! Princess,” he answered, “who would not be sorrowful who was
ordered to do such a terrible thing as I am? The King has commanded me
to kill you here, and carry your heart and your tongue to him, and if I
disobey I shall lose my life.”

The poor Princess was terrified, she grew very pale and began to cry
softly.

Looking up at the Captain of the Guard with her beautiful eyes, she said
gently:

“Will you really have the heart to kill me? I have never done you any
harm, and have always spoken well of you to the King. If I had deserved
my father’s anger I would suffer without a murmur, but, alas! he is
unjust to complain of me, when I have always treated him with love and
respect.”

“Fear nothing, Princess,” said the Captain of the Guard. “I would far
rather die myself than hurt you; but even if I am killed you will not
be safe: we must find some way of making the King believe that you are
dead.”

“What can we do?” said Miranda; “unless you take him my heart and my
tongue he will never believe you.”

The Princess and the Captain of the Guard were talking so earnestly that
they did not think of Patypata, but she had overheard all they said, and
now came and threw herself at Miranda’s feet.

“Madam,” she said, “I offer you my life; let me be killed, I shall be
only too happy to die for such a kind mistress.”

“Why, Patypata,” cried the Princess, kissing her, “that would never do;
your life is as precious to me as my own, especially after such a proof
of your affection as you have just given me.”

“You are right, Princess,” said Grabugeon, coming forward, “to love such
a faithful slave as Patypata; she is of more use to you than I am, I
offer you my tongue and my heart most willingly, especially as I wish to
make a great name for myself in Goblin Land.”

“No, no, my little Grabugeon,” replied Miranda, “I cannot bear the
thought of taking your life.”

“Such a good little dog as I am,” cried Tintin, “could not think of
letting either of you die for his mistress. If anyone is to die for her
it must be me.”

And then began a great dispute between Patypata, Grabugeon, and Tintin,
and they came to high words, until at last Grabugeon, who was quicker
than the others, ran up to the very top of the nearest tree, and let
herself fall, head first, to the ground, and there she lay--quite dead!

The Princess was very sorry, but as Grabugeon was really dead, she
allowed the Captain of the Guard to take her tongue; but, alas! it
was such a little one--not bigger than the Princess’s thumb--that they
decided sorrowfully that it was of no use at all: the King would not
have been taken in by it for a moment!

“Alas! my little monkey,” cried the Princess, “I have lost you, and yet
I am no better off than I was before.”

“The honor of saving your life is to be mine,” interrupted Patypata,
and, before they could prevent her, she had picked up a knife and cut
her head off in an instant.

But when the Captain of the Guard would have taken her tongue it turned
out to be quite black, so that would not have deceived the King either.

“Am I not unlucky?” cried the poor Princess; “I lose everything I love,
and am none the better for it.”

“If you had accepted my offer,” said Tintin, “you would only have had me
to regret, and I should have had all your gratitude.”

Miranda kissed her little dog, crying so bitterly, that at last she
could bear it no longer, and turned away into the forest. When she
looked back the Captain of the Guard was gone, and she was alone, except
for Patypata, Grabugeon, and Tintin, who lay upon the ground. She could
not leave the place until she had buried them in a pretty little mossy
grave at the foot of a tree, and she wrote their names upon the bark of
the tree, and how they had all died to save her life. And then she began
to think where she could go for safety--for this forest was so close to
her father’s castle that she might be seen and recognized by the first
passer-by, and, besides that, it was full of lions and wolves, who would
have snapped up a princess just as soon as a stray chicken. So she began
to walk as fast as she could, but the forest was so large and the sun
was so hot that she nearly died of heat and terror and fatigue; look
which way she would there seemed to be no end to the forest, and she
was so frightened that she fancied every minute that she heard the King
running after her to kill her. You may imagine how miserable she was,
and how she cried as she went on, not knowing which path to follow, and
with the thorny bushes scratching her dreadfully and tearing her pretty
frock to pieces.

At last she heard the bleating of a sheep, and said to herself:

“No doubt there are shepherds here with their flocks; they will show me
the way to some village where I can live disguised as a peasant girl.
Alas! it is not always kings and princes who are the happiest people in
the world. Who could have believed that I should ever be obliged to run
away and hide because the King, for no reason at all, wishes to kill
me?”

So saying she advanced toward the place where she heard the bleating,
but what was her surprise when, in a lovely little glade quite
surrounded by trees, she saw a large sheep; its wool was as white as
snow, and its horns shone like gold; it had a garland of flowers round
its neck, and strings of great pearls about its legs, and a collar of
diamonds; it lay upon a bank of orange-flowers, under a canopy of cloth
of gold which protected it from the heat of the sun. Nearly a hundred
other sheep were scattered about, not eating the grass, but some
drinking coffee, lemonade, or sherbet, others eating ices, strawberries
and cream, or sweetmeats, while others, again, were playing games. Many
of them wore golden collars with jewels, flowers, and ribbons.

Miranda stopped short in amazement at this unexpected sight, and was
looking in all directions for the shepherd of this surprising flock,
when the beautiful sheep came bounding toward her.

“Approach, lovely Princess,” he cried; “have no fear of such gentle and
peaceable animals as we are.”

“What a marvel!” cried the Princess, starting back a little. “Here is a
sheep that can talk.”

“Your monkey and your dog could talk, madam,” said he; “are you more
astonished at us than at them?”

“A fairy gave them the power to speak,” replied Miranda. “So I was used
to them.”

“Perhaps the same thing has happened to us,” he said, smiling
sheepishly. “But, Princess, what can have led you here?”

“A thousand misfortunes, Sir Sheep,” she answered.

“I am the unhappiest princess in the world, and I am seeking a shelter
against my father’s anger.”

“Come with me, madam,” said the Sheep; “I offer you a hiding-place which
you only will know of, and where you will be mistress of everything you
see.”

“I really cannot follow you,” said Miranda, “for I am too tired to walk
another step.”

The Sheep with the golden horns ordered that his chariot should be
fetched, and a moment after appeared six goats, harnessed to a pumpkin,
which was so big that two people could quite well sit in it, and was all
lined with cushions of velvet and down. The Princess stepped into it,
much amused at such a new kind of carriage, the King of the Sheep took
his place beside her, and the goats ran away with them at full speed,
and only stopped when they reached a cavern, the entrance to which
was blocked by a great stone. This the King touched with his foot, and
immediately it fell down, and he invited the Princess to enter without
fear. Now, if she had not been so alarmed by everything that had
happened, nothing could have induced her to go into this frightful cave,
but she was so afraid of what might be behind her that she would have
thrown herself even down a well at this moment. So, without hesitation,
she followed the Sheep, who went before her, down, down, down, until she
thought they must come out at the other side of the world--indeed, she
was not sure that he wasn’t leading her into Fairyland. At last she saw
before her a great plain, quite covered with all sorts of flowers, the
scent of which seemed to her nicer than anything she had ever smelled
before; a broad river of orange-flower water flowed round it and
fountains of wine of every kind ran in all directions and made the
prettiest little cascades and brooks. The plain was covered with the
strangest trees, there were whole avenues where partridges, ready
roasted, hung from every branch, or, if you preferred pheasants, quails,
turkeys, or rabbits, you had only to turn to the right hand or to the
left and you were sure to find them. In places the air was darkened by
showers of lobster-patties, white puddings, sausages, tarts, and all
sorts of sweetmeats, or with pieces of gold and silver, diamonds and
pearls. This unusual kind of rain, and the pleasantness of the whole
place, would, no doubt, have attracted numbers of people to it, if the
King of the Sheep had been of a more sociable disposition, but from all
accounts it is evident that he was as grave as a judge.

As it was quite the nicest time of the year when Miranda arrived in this
delightful land the only palace she saw was a long row of orange trees,
jasmines, honeysuckles, and musk-roses, and their interlacing branches
made the prettiest rooms possible, which were hung with gold and silver
gauze, and had great mirrors and candlesticks, and most beautiful
pictures. The Wonderful Sheep begged that the Princess would consider
herself queen over all that she saw, and assured her that, though for
some years he had been very sad and in great trouble, she had it in her
power to make him forget all his grief.

“You are so kind and generous, noble Sheep,” said the Princess, “that I
cannot thank you enough, but I must confess that all I see here seems to
me so extraordinary that I don’t know what to think of it.”

As she spoke a band of lovely fairies came up and offered her amber
baskets full of fruit, but when she held out her hands to them they
glided away, and she could feel nothing when she tried to touch them.

“Oh!” she cried, “what can they be? Whom am I with?” and she began to
cry.

At this instant the King of the Sheep came back to her, and was so
distracted to find her in tears that he could have torn his wool.

“What is the matter, lovely Princess?” he cried. “Has anyone failed to
treat you with due respect?”

“Oh! no,” said Miranda; “only I am not used to living with sprites and
with sheep that talk, and everything here frightens me. It was very kind
of you to bring me to this place, but I shall be even more grateful to
you if you will take me up into the world again.”

“Do not be afraid,” said the Wonderful Sheep; “I entreat you to have
patience, and listen to the story of my misfortunes. I was once a king,
and my kingdom was the most splendid in the world. My subjects loved me,
my neighbors envied and feared me. I was respected by everyone, and it
was said that no king ever deserved it more.

“I was very fond of hunting, and one day, while chasing a stag, I left
my attendants far behind; suddenly I saw the animal leap into a pool of
water, and I rashly urged my horse to follow it, but before we had gone
many steps I felt an extraordinary heat, instead of the coolness of the
water; the pond dried up, a great gulf opened before me, out of which
flames of fire shot up, and I fell helplessly to the bottom of a
precipice.

“I gave myself up for lost, but presently a voice said: ‘Ungrateful
Prince, even this fire is hardly enough to warm your cold heart!’

“‘Who complains of my coldness in this dismal place?’ I cried.

“‘An unhappy being who loves you hopelessly,’ replied the voice, and at
the same moment the flames began to flicker and cease to burn, and I
saw a fairy, whom I had known as long as I could remember, and whose
ugliness had always horrified me. She was leaning upon the arm of a
most beautiful young girl, who wore chains of gold on her wrists and was
evidently her slave.

“‘Why, Ragotte,’ I said, for that was the fairy’s name, ‘what is the
meaning of all this? Is it by your orders that I am here?’

“‘And whose fault is it,’ she answered, ‘that you have never understood
me until now? Must a powerful fairy like myself condescend to explain
her doings to you who are no better than an ant by comparison, though
you think yourself a great king?’

“‘Call me what you like,’ I said impatiently; ‘but what is it that you
want--my crown, or my cities, or my treasures?’

“‘Treasures!’ said the fairy, disdainfully. ‘If I chose I could make
any one of my scullions richer and more powerful than you. I do not
want your treasures, but,’ she added softly, ‘if you will give me your
heart--if you will marry me--I will add twenty kingdoms to the one you
have already; you shall have a hundred castles full of gold and five
hundred full of silver, and, in short, anything you like to ask me for.’

“‘Madam Ragotte,’ said I, ‘when one is at the bottom of a pit where one
has fully expected to be roasted alive, it is impossible to think of
asking such a charming person as you are to marry one! I beg that you
will set me at liberty, and then I shall hope to answer you fittingly.’

“‘Ah!’ said she, ‘if you really loved me you would not care where you
were--a cave, a wood, a fox-hole, a desert, would please you equally
well. Do not think that you can deceive me; you fancy you are going to
escape, but I assure you that you are going to stay here and the first
thing I shall give you to do will be to keep my sheep--they are very
good company and speak quite as well as you do.

“As she spoke she advanced, and led me to this plain where we now stand,
and showed me her flock, but I paid little attention to it or to her.

“To tell the truth, I was so lost in admiration of her beautiful slave
that I forgot everything else, and the cruel Ragotte, perceiving this,
turned upon her so furious and terrible a look that she fell lifeless to
the ground.

“At this dreadful sight I drew my sword and rushed at Ragotte, and
should certainly have cut off her head had she not by her magic arts
chained me to the spot on which I stood; all my efforts to move were
useless, and at last, when I threw myself down on the ground in despair,
she said to me, with a scornful smile:

“‘I intend to make you feel my power. It seems that you are a lion at
present, I mean you to be a sheep.’

“So saying, she touched me with her wand, and I became what you see. I
did not lose the power of speech, or of feeling the misery of my present
state.

“‘For five years,’ she said, ‘you shall be a sheep, and lord of this
pleasant land, while I, no longer able to see your face, which I loved
so much, shall be better able to hate you as you deserve to be hated.’

“She disappeared as she finished speaking, and if I had not been too
unhappy to care about anything I should have been glad that she was
gone.

“The talking sheep received me as their king, and told me that they,
too, were unfortunate princes who had, in different ways, offended the
revengeful fairy, and had been added to her flock for a certain number
of years; some more, some less. From time to time, indeed, one regains
his own proper form and goes back again to his place in the upper world;
but the other beings whom you saw are the rivals or the enemies of
Ragotte, whom she has imprisoned for a hundred years or so; though even
they will go back at last. The young slave of whom I told you about is
one of these; I have seen her often, and it has been a great pleasure to
me. She never speaks to me, and if I were nearer to her I know I should
find her only a shadow, which would be very annoying. However, I noticed
that one of my companions in misfortune was also very attentive to this
little sprite, and I found out that he had been her lover, whom the
cruel Ragotte had taken away from her long before; since then I have
cared for, and thought of, nothing but how I might regain my freedom.
I have often been in the forest; that is where I have seen you, lovely
Princess, sometimes driving your chariot, which you did with all the
grace and skill in the world; sometimes riding to the chase on so
spirited a horse that it seemed as if no one but yourself could have
managed it, and sometimes running races on the plain with the Princesses
of your Court--running so lightly that it was you always who won the
prize. Oh! Princess, I have loved you so long, and yet how dare I
tell you of my love! what hope can there be for an unhappy sheep like
myself?”

Miranda was so surprised and confused by all that she had heard that
she hardly knew what answer to give to the King of the Sheep, but she
managed to make some kind of little speech, which certainly did not
forbid him to hope, and said that she should not be afraid of the
shadows now she knew that they would some day come to life again.
“Alas!” she continued, “if my poor Patypata, my dear Grabugeon, and
pretty little Tintin, who all died for my sake, were equally well off, I
should have nothing left to wish for here!”

Prisoner though he was, the King of the Sheep had still some powers and
privileges.

“Go,” said he to his Master of the Horse, “go and seek the shadows of
the little black girl, the monkey, and the dog: they will amuse our
Princess.”

And an instant afterward Miranda saw them coming toward her, and their
presence gave her the greatest pleasure, though they did not come near
enough for her to touch them.

The King of the Sheep was so kind and amusing, and loved Miranda so
dearly, that at last she began to love him too. Such a handsome
sheep, who was so polite and considerate, could hardly fail to please,
especially if one knew that he was really a king, and that his strange
imprisonment would soon come to an end. So the Princess’s days passed
very gaily while she waited for the happy time to come. The King of
the Sheep, with the help of all the flock, got up balls, concerts, and
hunting parties, and even the shadows joined in all the fun, and came,
making believe to be their own real selves.

One evening, when the couriers arrived (for the King sent most carefully
for news--and they always brought the very best kinds), it was announced
that the sister of the Princess Miranda was going to be married to
a great Prince, and that nothing could be more splendid than all the
preparations for the wedding.

“Ah!” cried the young Princess, “how unlucky I am to miss the sight of
so many pretty things! Here am I imprisoned under the earth, with no
company but sheep and shadows, while my sister is to be adorned like a
queen and surrounded by all who love and admire her, and everyone but
myself can go to wish her joy!”

“Why do you complain, Princess?” said the King of the Sheep. “Did I say
that you were not to go to the wedding? Set out as soon as you please;
only promise me that you will come back, for I love you too much to be
able to live without you.”

Miranda was very grateful to him, and promised faithfully that nothing
in the world should keep her from coming back. The King caused an escort
suitable to her rank to be got ready for her, and she dressed herself
splendidly, not forgetting anything that could make her more beautiful.
Her chariot was of mother-of-pearl, drawn by six dun-colored griffins
just brought from the other side of the world, and she was attended by a
number of guards in splendid uniforms, who were all at least eight feet
high and had come from far and near to ride in the Princess’s train.

Miranda reached her father’s palace just as the wedding ceremony began,
and everyone, as soon as she came in, was struck with surprise at
her beauty and the splendor of her jewels. She heard exclamations
of admiration on all sides; and the King her father looked at her so
attentively that she was afraid he must recognize her; but he was so
sure that she was dead that the idea never occurred to him.

However, the fear of not getting away made her leave before the marriage
was over. She went out hastily, leaving behind her a little coral casket
set with emeralds. On it was written in diamond letters: “Jewels for the
Bride,” and when they opened it, which they did as soon as it was found,
there seemed to be no end to the pretty things it contained. The King,
who had hoped to join the unknown Princess and find out who she was,
was dreadfully disappointed when she disappeared so suddenly, and gave
orders that if she ever came again the doors were to be shut that she
might not get away so easily. Short as Miranda’s absence had been, it
had seemed like a hundred years to the King of the Sheep. He was waiting
for her by a fountain in the thickest part of the forest, and the ground
was strewn with splendid presents which he had prepared for her to show
his joy and gratitude at her coming back.

As soon as she was in sight he rushed to meet her, leaping and bounding
like a real sheep. He caressed her tenderly, throwing himself at her
feet and kissing her hands, and told her how uneasy he had been in
her absence, and how impatient for her return, with an eloquence which
charmed her.

After some time came the news that the King’s second daughter was going
to be married. When Miranda heard it she begged the King of the Sheep
to allow her to go and see the wedding as before. This request made him
feel very sad, as if some misfortune must surely come of it, but his
love for the Princess being stronger than anything else he did not like
to refuse her.

“You wish to leave me, Princess,” said he; “it is my unhappy fate--you
are not to blame. I consent to your going, but, believe me, I can give
you no stronger proof of my love than by so doing.”

The Princess assured him that she would only stay a very short time, as
she had done before, and begged him not to be uneasy, as she would be
quite as much grieved if anything detained her as he could possibly be.

So, with the same escort, she set out, and reached the palace as the
marriage ceremony began. Everybody was delighted to see her; she was
so pretty that they thought she must be some fairy princess, and the
Princes who were there could not take their eyes off her.

The King was more glad than anyone else that she had come again, and
gave orders that the doors should all be shut and bolted that very
minute. When the wedding was all but over the Princess got up quickly,
hoping to slip away unnoticed among the crowd, but, to her great dismay,
she found every door fastened.

She felt more at ease when the King came up to her, and with the
greatest respect begged her not to run away so soon, but at least to
honor him by staying for the splendid feast which was prepared for the
Princes and Princesses. He led her into a magnificent hall, where all
the Court was assembled, and himself taking up the golden bowl full of
water, he offered it to her that she might dip her pretty fingers into
it.

At this the Princess could no longer contain herself; throwing herself
at the King’s feet, she cried out:

“My dream has come true after all--you have offered me water to wash my
hands on my sister’s wedding day, and it has not vexed you to do it.”

The King recognized her at once--indeed, he had already thought several
times how much like his poor little Miranda she was.

“Oh! my dear daughter,” he cried, kissing her, “can you ever forget my
cruelty? I ordered you to be put to death because I thought your dream
portended the loss of my crown. And so it did,” he added, “for now your
sisters are both married and have kingdoms of their own--and mine shall
be for you.” So saying he put his crown on the Princess’s head and
cried:

“Long live Queen Miranda!”

All the Court cried: “Long live Queen Miranda!” after him, and the young
Queen’s two sisters came running up, and threw their arms round her
neck, and kissed her a thousand times, and then there was such a
laughing and crying, talking and kissing, all at once, and Miranda
thanked her father, and began to ask after everyone--particularly
the Captain of the Guard, to whom she owed so much; but, to her great
sorrow, she heard that he was dead. Presently they sat down to the
banquet, and the King asked Miranda to tell them all that had happened
to her since the terrible morning when he had sent the Captain of the
Guard to fetch her. This she did with so much spirit that all the guests
listened with breathless interest. But while she was thus enjoying
herself with the King and her sisters, the King of the Sheep was waiting
impatiently for the time of her return, and when it came and went, and
no Princess appeared, his anxiety became so great that he could bear it
no longer.

“She is not coming back any more,” he cried. “My miserable sheep’s
face displeases her, and without Miranda what is left to me, wretched
creature that I am! Oh! cruel Ragotte; my punishment is complete.”

For a long time he bewailed his sad fate like this, and then, seeing
that it was growing dark, and that still there was no sign of the
Princess, he set out as fast as he could in the direction of the town.
When he reached the palace he asked for Miranda, but by this time
everyone had heard the story of her adventures, and did not want her to
go back again to the King of the Sheep, so they refused sternly to let
him see her. In vain he begged and prayed them to let him in; though
his entreaties might have melted hearts of stone they did not move the
guards of the palace, and at last, quite broken-hearted, he fell dead at
their feet.

In the meantime the King, who had not the least idea of the sad thing
that was happening outside the gate of his palace, proposed to Miranda
that she should be driven in her chariot all round the town, which was
to be illuminated with thousands and thousands of torches, placed in
windows and balconies, and in all the grand squares. But what a sight
met her eyes at the very entrance of the palace! There lay her dear,
kind sheep, silent and motionless, upon the pavement!

She threw herself out of the chariot and ran to him, crying bitterly,
for she realized that her broken promise had cost him his life, and for
a long, long time she was so unhappy that they thought she would have
died too.

So you see that even a princess is not always happy--especially if she
forgets to keep her word; and the greatest misfortunes often happen to
people just as they think they have obtained their heart’s desires!


There was, once upon a time, a man and his wife fagot-makers by trade,
who had several children, all boys. The eldest was but ten years old,
and the youngest only seven.

They were very poor, and their seven children incommoded them greatly,
because not one of them was able to earn his bread. That which gave
them yet more uneasiness was that the youngest was of a very puny
constitution, and scarce ever spoke a word, which made them take that
for stupidity which was a sign of good sense. He was very little, and
when born no bigger than one’s thumb, which made him be called Little
Thumb.

The poor child bore the blame of whatsoever was done amiss in the house,
and, guilty or not, was always in the wrong; he was, notwithstanding,
more cunning and had a far greater share of wisdom than all his brothers
put together; and, if he spake little, he heard and thought the more.

There happened now to come a very bad year, and the famine was so great
that these poor people resolved to rid themselves of their children. One
evening, when they were all in bed and the fagot-maker was sitting with
his wife at the fire, he said to her, with his heart ready to burst with
grief:

“Thou seest plainly that we are not able to keep our children, and I
cannot see them starve to death before my face; I am resolved to lose
them in the wood to-morrow, which may very easily be done; for, while
they are busy in tying up fagots, we may run away, and leave them,
without their taking any notice.”

“Ah!” cried his wife; “and canst thou thyself have the heart to take thy
children out along with thee on purpose to lose them?”

In vain did her husband represent to her their extreme poverty: she
would not consent to it; she was indeed poor, but she was their mother.
However, having considered what a grief it would be to her to see them
perish with hunger, she at last consented, and went to bed all in tears.

Little Thumb heard every word that had been spoken; for observing, as
he lay in his bed, that they were talking very busily, he got up softly,
and hid himself under his father’s stool, that he might hear what they
said without being seen. He went to bed again, but did not sleep a wink
all the rest of the night, thinking on what he had to do. He got up
early in the morning, and went to the river-side, where he filled his
pockets full of small white pebbles, and then returned home.

They all went abroad, but Little Thumb never told his brothers one
syllable of what he knew. They went into a very thick forest, where they
could not see one another at ten paces distance. The fagot-maker began
to cut wood, and the children to gather up the sticks to make fagots.
Their father and mother, seeing them busy at their work, got away from
them insensibly, and ran away from them all at once, along a by-way
through the winding bushes.

When the children saw they were left alone, they began to cry as loud as
they could. Little Thumb let them cry on, knowing very well how to get
home again, for, as he came, he took care to drop all along the way the
little white pebbles he had in his pockets. Then he said to them:

“Be not afraid, brothers; father and mother have left us here, but I
will lead you home again, only follow me.”

They did so, and he brought them home by the very same way they came
into the forest. They dared not go in, but sat themselves down at the
door, listening to what their father and mother were saying.

The very moment the fagot-maker and his wife reached home the lord of
the manor sent them ten crowns, which he had owed them a long while, and
which they never expected. This gave them new life, for the poor people
were almost famished. The fagot-maker sent his wife immediately to the
butcher’s. As it was a long while since they had eaten a bit, she bought
thrice as much meat as would sup two people. When they had eaten, the
woman said:

“Alas! where are now our poor children? they would make a good feast of
what we have left here; but it was you, William, who had a mind to lose
them: I told you we should repent of it. What are they now doing in the
forest? Alas! dear God, the wolves have perhaps already eaten them up;
thou art very inhuman thus to have lost thy children.”

The fagot-maker grew at last quite out of patience, for she repeated it
above twenty times, that they should repent of it, and that she was in
the right of it for so saying. He threatened to beat her if she did not
hold her tongue. It was not that the fagot-maker was not, perhaps, more
vexed than his wife, but that she teased him, and that he was of the
humor of a great many others, who love wives to speak well, but
think those very importunate who are continually doing so. She was
half-drowned in tears, crying out:

“Alas! where are now my children, my poor children?”

She spoke this so very loud that the children, who were at the gate,
began to cry out all together:

“Here we are! Here we are!”

She ran immediately to open the door, and said, hugging them:

“I am glad to see you, my dear children; you are very hungry and weary;
and my poor Peter, thou art horribly bemired; come in and let me clean
thee.”

Now, you must know that Peter was her eldest son, whom she loved above
all the rest, because he was somewhat carroty, as she herself was. They
sat down to supper, and ate with such a good appetite as pleased both
father and mother, whom they acquainted how frightened they were in
the forest, speaking almost always all together. The good folks were
extremely glad to see their children once more at home, and this joy
continued while the ten crowns lasted; but, when the money was all gone,
they fell again into their former uneasiness, and resolved to lose them
again; and, that they might be the surer of doing it, to carry them to a
much greater distance than before.

They could not talk of this so secretly but they were overheard by
Little Thumb, who made account to get out of this difficulty as well as
the former; but, though he got up very early in the morning to go and
pick up some little pebbles, he was disappointed, for he found the
house-door double-locked, and was at a stand what to do. When their
father had given each of them a piece of bread for their breakfast,
Little Thumb fancied he might make use of this instead of the pebbles by
throwing it in little bits all along the way they should pass; and so he
put the bread in his pocket.

Their father and mother brought them into the thickest and most obscure
part of the forest, when, stealing away into a by-path, they there left
them. Little Thumb was not very uneasy at it, for he thought he could
easily find the way again by means of his bread, which he had scattered
all along as he came; but he was very much surprised when he could not
find so much as one crumb; the birds had come and had eaten it up, every
bit. They were now in great affliction, for the farther they went the
more they were out of their way, and were more and more bewildered in
the forest.

Night now came on, and there arose a terribly high wind, which made them
dreadfully afraid. They fancied they heard on every side of them the
howling of wolves coming to eat them up. They scarce dared to speak or
turn their heads. After this, it rained very hard, which wetted them to
the skin; their feet slipped at every step they took, and they fell into
the mire, whence they got up in a very dirty pickle; their hands were
quite benumbed.

Little Thumb climbed up to the top of a tree, to see if he could
discover anything; and having turned his head about on every side, he
saw at last a glimmering light, like that of a candle, but a long way
from the forest. He came down, and, when upon the ground, he could see
it no more, which grieved him sadly. However, having walked for some
time with his brothers toward that side on which he had seen the light,
he perceived it again as he came out of the wood.

They came at last to the house where this candle was, not without an
abundance of fear: for very often they lost sight of it, which happened
every time they came into a bottom. They knocked at the door, and a good
woman came and opened it; she asked them what they would have.

Little Thumb told her they were poor children who had been lost in the
forest, and desired to lodge there for God’s sake.

The woman, seeing them so very pretty, began to weep, and said to them:

“Alas! poor babies; whither are ye come? Do ye know that this house
belongs to a cruel ogre who eats up little children?”

“Ah! dear madam,” answered Little Thumb (who trembled every joint of
him, as well as his brothers), “what shall we do? To be sure the wolves
of the forest will devour us to-night if you refuse us to lie here; and
so we would rather the gentleman should eat us; and perhaps he may take
pity upon us, especially if you please to beg it of him.”

The Ogre’s wife, who believed she could conceal them from her husband
till morning, let them come in, and brought them to warm themselves at a
very good fire; for there was a whole sheep upon the spit, roasting for
the Ogre’s supper.

As they began to be a little warm they heard three or four great raps at
the door; this was the Ogre, who had come home. Upon this she hid them
under the bed and went to open the door. The Ogre presently asked if
supper was ready and the wine drawn, and then sat himself down to table.
The sheep was as yet all raw and bloody; but he liked it the better for
that. He sniffed about to the right and left, saying:

“I smell fresh meat.”

“What you smell so,” said his wife, “must be the calf which I have just
now killed and flayed.”

“I smell fresh meat, I tell thee once more,” replied the Ogre, looking
crossly at his wife; “and there is something here which I do not
understand.”

As he spoke these words he got up from the table and went directly to
the bed.

“Ah, ah!” said he; “I see then how thou wouldst cheat me, thou cursed
woman; I know not why I do not eat thee up too, but it is well for thee
that thou art a tough old carrion. Here is good game, which comes very
quickly to entertain three ogres of my acquaintance who are to pay me a
visit in a day or two.”

With that he dragged them out from under the bed one by one. The poor
children fell upon their knees, and begged his pardon; but they had to
do with one of the most cruel ogres in the world, who, far from having
any pity on them, had already devoured them with his eyes, and told
his wife they would be delicate eating when tossed up with good
savory sauce. He then took a great knife, and, coming up to these poor
children, whetted it upon a great whet-stone which he held in his left
hand. He had already taken hold of one of them when his wife said to
him:

“Why need you do it now? Is it not time enough to-morrow?”

“Hold your prating,” said the Ogre; “they will eat the tenderer.

“But you have so much meat already,” replied his wife, “you have no
occasion; here are a calf, two sheep, and half a hog.”

“That is true,” said the Ogre; “give them their belly full that they may
not fall away, and put them to bed.”

The good woman was overjoyed at this, and gave them a good supper; but
they were so much afraid they could not eat a bit. As for the Ogre,
he sat down again to drink, being highly pleased that he had got
wherewithal to treat his friends. He drank a dozen glasses more than
ordinary, which got up into his head and obliged him to go to bed.

The Ogre had seven daughters, all little children, and these young
ogresses had all of them very fine complexions, because they used to
eat fresh meat like their father; but they had little gray eyes, quite
round, hooked noses, and very long sharp teeth, standing at a
good distance from each other. They were not as yet over and above
mischievous, but they promised very fair for it, for they had already
bitten little children, that they might suck their blood.

They had been put to bed early, with every one a crown of gold upon her
head. There was in the same chamber a bed of the like bigness, and it
was into this bed the Ogre’s wife put the seven little boys, after which
she went to bed to her husband.

Little Thumb, who had observed that the Ogre’s daughters had crowns of
gold upon their heads, and was afraid lest the Ogre should repent his
not killing them, got up about midnight, and, taking his brothers’
bonnets and his own, went very softly and put them upon the heads of
the seven little ogresses, after having taken off their crowns of gold,
which he put upon his own head and his brothers’, that the Ogre might
take them for his daughters, and his daughters for the little boys whom
he wanted to kill.

All this succeeded according to his desire; for, the Ogre waking about
midnight, and sorry that he deferred to do that till morning which
he might have done over-night, threw himself hastily out of bed, and,
taking his great knife,

“Let us see,” said he, “how our little rogues do, and not make two jobs
of the matter.”

He then went up, groping all the way, into his daughters’ chamber, and,
coming to the bed where the little boys lay, and who were every soul of
them fast asleep, except Little Thumb, who was terribly afraid when
he found the Ogre fumbling about his head, as he had done about his
brothers’, the Ogre, feeling the golden crowns, said:

“I should have made a fine piece of work of it, truly; I find I drank
too much last night.”

Then he went to the bed where the girls lay; and, having found the boys’
little bonnets,

“Ah!” said he, “my merry lads, are you there? Let us work as we ought.”

And saying these words, without more ado, he cut the throats of all his
seven daughters.

Well pleased with what he had done, he went to bed again to his wife.
So soon as Little Thumb heard the Ogre snore, he waked his brothers, and
bade them all put on their clothes presently and follow him. They stole
down softly into the garden, and got over the wall. They kept running
about all night, and trembled all the while, without knowing which way
they went.

The Ogre, when he awoke, said to his wife: “Go upstairs and dress those
young rascals who came here last night.”

The wife was very much surprised at this goodness of her husband, not
dreaming after what manner she should dress them; but, thinking that
he had ordered her to go and put on their clothes, she went up, and was
strangely astonished when she perceived her seven daughters killed, and
weltering in their blood.

She fainted away, for this is the first expedient almost all women find
in such cases. The Ogre, fearing his wife would be too long in doing
what he had ordered, went up himself to help her. He was no less amazed
than his wife at this frightful spectacle.

“Ah! what have I done?” cried he. “The wretches shall pay for it, and
that instantly.”

He threw a pitcher of water upon his wife’s face, and, having brought
her to herself, said:

“Give me quickly my boots of seven leagues, that I may go and catch
them.”

He went out, and, having run over a vast deal of ground, both on
this side and that, he came at last into the very road where the poor
children were, and not above a hundred paces from their father’s house.
They espied the Ogre, who went at one step from mountain to mountain,
and over rivers as easily as the narrowest kennels. Little Thumb, seeing
a hollow rock near the place where they were, made his brothers hide
themselves in it, and crowded into it himself, minding always what would
become of the Ogre.

The Ogre, who found himself much tired with his long and fruitless
journey (for these boots of seven leagues greatly fatigued the wearer),
had a great mind to rest himself, and, by chance, went to sit down upon
the rock where the little boys had hid themselves. As it was impossible
he could be more weary than he was, he fell asleep, and, after reposing
himself some time, began to snore so frightfully that the poor children
were no less afraid of him than when he held up his great knife and was
going to cut their throats. Little Thumb was not so much frightened as
his brothers, and told them that they should run away immediately toward
home while the Ogre was asleep so soundly, and that they should not be
in any pain about him. They took his advice, and got home presently.
Little Thumb came up to the Ogre, pulled off his boots gently and put
them on his own legs. The boots were very long and large, but, as they
were fairies, they had the gift of becoming big and little, according to
the legs of those who wore them; so that they fitted his feet and legs
as well as if they had been made on purpose for him. He went immediately
to the Ogre’s house, where he saw his wife crying bitterly for the loss
of the Ogre’s murdered daughters.

“Your husband,” said Little Thumb, “is in very great danger, being taken
by a gang of thieves, who have sworn to kill him if he does not give
them all his gold and silver. The very moment they held their daggers
at his throat he perceived me, and desired me to come and tell you the
condition he is in, and that you should give me whatsoever he has of
value, without retaining any one thing; for otherwise they will kill him
without mercy; and, as his case is very pressing, he desired me to make
use (you see I have them on) of his boots, that I might make the more
haste and to show you that I do not impose upon you.”

The good woman, being sadly frightened, gave him all she had: for this
Ogre was a very good husband, though he used to eat up little children.
Little Thumb, having thus got all the Ogre’s money, came home to his
father’s house, where he was received with abundance of joy.

There are many people who do not agree in this circumstance, and pretend
that Little Thumb never robbed the Ogre at all, and that he only thought
he might very justly, and with a safe conscience, take off his boots
of seven leagues, because he made no other use of them but to run after
little children. These folks affirm that they are very well assured of
this, and the more as having drunk and eaten often at the fagot-maker’s
house. They aver that when Little Thumb had taken off the Ogre’s boots
he went to Court, where he was informed that they were very much in pain
about a certain army, which was two hundred leagues off, and the success
of a battle. He went, say they, to the King, and told him that, if he
desired it, he would bring him news from the army before night.

The King promised him a great sum of money upon that condition. Little
Thumb was as good as his word, and returned that very same night with
the news; and, this first expedition causing him to be known, he got
whatever he pleased, for the King paid him very well for carrying his
orders to the army. After having for some time carried on the business
of a messenger, and gained thereby great wealth, he went home to his
father, where it was impossible to express the joy they were all in at
his return. He made the whole family very easy, bought places for his
father and brothers, and, by that means, settled them very handsomely in
the world, and, in the meantime, made his court to perfection.



In a town in Persia there dwelt two brothers, one named Cassim, the
other Ali Baba. Cassim was married to a rich wife and lived in plenty,
while Ali Baba had to maintain his wife and children by cutting wood in
a neighboring forest and selling it in the town. One day, when Ali Baba
was in the forest, he saw a troop of men on horseback, coming toward him
in a cloud of dust. He was afraid they were robbers, and climbed into
a tree for safety. When they came up to him and dismounted, he counted
forty of them. They unbridled their horses and tied them to trees. The
finest man among them, whom Ali Baba took to be their captain, went a
little way among some bushes, and said: “Open, Sesame!”(1) so plainly
that Ali Baba heard him. A door opened in the rocks, and having made the
troop go in, he followed them, and the door shut again of itself. They
stayed some time inside, and Ali Baba, fearing they might come out and
catch him, was forced to sit patiently in the tree. At last the door
opened again, and the Forty Thieves came out. As the Captain went in
last he came out first, and made them all pass by him; he then closed
the door, saying: “Shut, Sesame!” Every man bridled his horse and
mounted, the Captain put himself at their head, and they returned as
they came.



Then Ali Baba climbed down and went to the door concealed among the
bushes, and said: “Open, Sesame!” and it flew open. Ali Baba, who
expected a dull, dismal place, was greatly surprised to find it large
and well lighted, hollowed by the hand of man in the form of a vault,
which received the light from an opening in the ceiling. He saw rich
bales of merchandise--silk, stuff-brocades, all piled together, and gold
and silver in heaps, and money in leather purses. He went in and the
door shut behind him. He did not look at the silver, but brought out as
many bags of gold as he thought his asses, which were browsing outside,
could carry, loaded them with the bags, and hid it all with fagots.
Using the words: “Shut, Sesame!” he closed the door and went home.

Then he drove his asses into the yard, shut the gates, carried the
money-bags to his wife, and emptied them out before her. He bade her
keep the secret, and he would go and bury the gold. “Let me first
measure it,” said his wife. “I will go borrow a measure of someone,
while you dig the hole.” So she ran to the wife of Cassim and borrowed a
measure. Knowing Ali Baba’s poverty, the sister was curious to find out
what sort of grain his wife wished to measure, and artfully put some
suet at the bottom of the measure. Ali Baba’s wife went home and set the
measure on the heap of gold, and filled it and emptied it often, to her
great content. She then carried it back to her sister, without noticing
that a piece of gold was sticking to it, which Cassim’s wife perceived
directly her back was turned. She grew very curious, and said to Cassim
when he came home: “Cassim, your brother is richer than you. He does not
count his money, he measures it.” He begged her to explain this riddle,
which she did by showing him the piece of money and telling him where
she found it. Then Cassim grew so envious that he could not sleep, and
went to his brother in the morning before sunrise. “Ali Baba,” he said,
showing him the gold piece, “you pretend to be poor and yet you measure
gold.” By this Ali Baba perceived that through his wife’s folly Cassim
and his wife knew their secret, so he confessed all and offered Cassim a
share. “That I expect,” said Cassim; “but I must know where to find the
treasure, otherwise I will discover all, and you will lose all.” Ali
Baba, more out of kindness than fear, told him of the cave, and the very
words to use. Cassim left Ali Baba, meaning to be beforehand with him
and get the treasure for himself. He rose early next morning, and set
out with ten mules loaded with great chests. He soon found the place,
and the door in the rock. He said: “Open, Sesame!” and the door opened
and shut behind him. He could have feasted his eyes all day on the
treasures, but he now hastened to gather together as much of it as
possible; but when he was ready to go he could not remember what to say
for thinking of his great riches. Instead of “Sesame,” he said: “Open,
Barley!” and the door remained fast. He named several different sorts of
grain, all but the right one, and the door still stuck fast. He was so
frightened at the danger he was in that he had as much forgotten the
word as if he had never heard it.

About noon the robbers returned to their cave, and saw Cassim’s mules
roving about with great chests on their backs. This gave them the alarm;
they drew their sabres, and went to the door, which opened on their
Captain’s saying: “Open, Sesame!” Cassim, who had heard the trampling of
their horses’ feet, resolved to sell his life dearly, so when the door
opened he leaped out and threw the Captain down. In vain, however, for
the robbers with their sabres soon killed him. On entering the cave they
saw all the bags laid ready, and could not imagine how anyone had got in
without knowing their secret. They cut Cassim’s body into four quarters,
and nailed them up inside the cave, in order to frighten anyone who
should venture in, and went away in search of more treasure.

As night drew on Cassim’s wife grew very uneasy, and ran to her
brother-in-law, and told him where her husband had gone. Ali Baba did
his best to comfort her, and set out to the forest in search of Cassim.
The first thing he saw on entering the cave was his dead brother. Full
of horror, he put the body on one of his asses, and bags of gold on the
other two, and, covering all with some fagots, returned home. He drove
the two asses laden with gold into his own yard, and led the other to
Cassim’s house. The door was opened by the slave Morgiana, whom he knew
to be both brave and cunning. Unloading the ass, he said to her: “This
is the body of your master, who has been murdered, but whom we must bury
as though he had died in his bed. I will speak with you again, but now
tell your mistress I am come.” The wife of Cassim, on learning the fate
of her husband, broke out into cries and tears, but Ali Baba offered to
take her to live with him and his wife if she would promise to keep
his counsel and leave everything to Morgiana; whereupon she agreed, and
dried her eyes.

Morgiana, meanwhile, sought an apothecary and asked him for some
lozenges. “My poor master,” she said, “can neither eat nor speak, and
no one knows what his distemper is.” She carried home the lozenges and
returned next day weeping, and asked for an essence only given to those
just about to die. Thus, in the evening, no one was surprised to hear
the wretched shrieks and cries of Cassim’s wife and Morgiana, telling
everyone that Cassim was dead. The day after Morgiana went to an old
cobbler near the gates of the town who opened his stall early, put a
piece of gold in his hand, and bade him follow her with his needle and
thread. Having bound his eyes with a handkerchief, she took him to the
room where the body lay, pulled off the bandage, and bade him sew the
quarters together, after which she covered his eyes again and led him
home. Then they buried Cassim, and Morgiana his slave followed him to
the grave, weeping and tearing her hair, while Cassim’s wife stayed at
home uttering lamentable cries. Next day she went to live with Ali Baba,
who gave Cassim’s shop to his eldest son.

The Forty Thieves, on their return to the cave, were much astonished to
find Cassim’s body gone and some of their money-bags. “We are certainly
discovered,” said the Captain, “and shall be undone if we cannot find
out who it is that knows our secret. Two men must have known it; we have
killed one, we must now find the other. To this end one of you who
is bold and artful must go into the city dressed as a traveler, and
discover whom we have killed, and whether men talk of the strange manner
of his death. If the messenger fails he must lose his life, lest we be
betrayed.” One of the thieves started up and offered to do this, and
after the rest had highly commended him for his bravery he disguised
himself, and happened to enter the town at daybreak, just by Baba
Mustapha’s stall. The thief bade him good-day, saying: “Honest man, how
can you possibly see to stitch at your age?” “Old as I am,” replied the
cobbler, “I have very good eyes, and will you believe me when I tell you
that I sewed a dead body together in a place where I had less light than
I have now.” The robber was overjoyed at his good fortune, and, giving
him a piece of gold, desired to be shown the house where he stitched
up the dead body. At first Mustapha refused, saying that he had been
blindfolded; but when the robber gave him another piece of gold he began
to think he might remember the turnings if blindfolded as before. This
means succeeded; the robber partly led him, and was partly guided by
him, right in front of Cassim’s house, the door of which the robber
marked with a piece of chalk. Then, well pleased, he bade farewell to
Baba Mustapha and returned to the forest. By and by Morgiana, going out,
saw the mark the robber had made, quickly guessed that some mischief was
brewing, and fetching a piece of chalk marked two or three doors on each
side, without saying anything to her master or mistress.

The thief, meantime, told his comrades of his discovery. The Captain
thanked him, and bade him show him the house he had marked. But when
they came to it they saw that five or six of the houses were chalked
in the same manner. The guide was so confounded that he knew not what
answer to make, and when they returned he was at once beheaded for
having failed. Another robber was dispatched, and, having won over Baba
Mustapha, marked the house in red chalk; but Morgiana being again too
clever for them, the second messenger was put to death also. The Captain
now resolved to go himself, but, wiser than the others, he did not
mark the house, but looked at it so closely that he could not fail to
remember it. He returned, and ordered his men to go into the neighboring
villages and buy nineteen mules, and thirty-eight leather jars, all
empty except one, which was full of oil. The Captain put one of his men,
fully armed, into each, rubbing the outside of the jars with oil from
the full vessel. Then the nineteen mules were loaded with thirty-seven
robbers in jars, and the jar of oil, and reached the town by dusk. The
Captain stopped his mules in front of Ali Baba’s house, and said to Ali
Baba, who was sitting outside for coolness: “I have brought some oil
from a distance to sell at to-morrow’s market, but it is now so late
that I know not where to pass the night, unless you will do me the favor
to take me in.” Though Ali Baba had seen the Captain of the robbers in
the forest, he did not recognize him in the disguise of an oil merchant.
He bade him welcome, opened his gates for the mules to enter, and
went to Morgiana to bid her prepare a bed and supper for his guest. He
brought the stranger into his hall, and after they had supped went again
to speak to Morgiana in the kitchen, while the Captain went into the
yard under pretense of seeing after his mules, but really to tell his
men what to do. Beginning at the first jar and ending at the last, he
said to each man: “As soon as I throw some stones from the window of the
chamber where I lie, cut the jars open with your knives and come out,
and I will be with you in a trice.” He returned to the house,
and Morgiana led him to his chamber. She then told Abdallah, her
fellow-slave, to set on the pot to make some broth for her master, who
had gone to bed. Meanwhile her lamp went out, and she had no more oil in
the house. “Do not be uneasy,” said Abdallah; “go into the yard and take
some out of one of those jars.” Morgiana thanked him for his advice,
took the oil pot, and went into the yard. When she came to the first jar
the robber inside said softly: “Is it time?”

Any other slave but Morgiana, on finding a man in the jar instead of the
oil she wanted, would have screamed and made a noise; but she, knowing
the danger her master was in, bethought herself of a plan, and answered
quietly: “Not yet, but presently.” She went to all the jars, giving
the same answer, till she came to the jar of oil. She now saw that her
master, thinking to entertain an oil merchant, had let thirty-eight
robbers into his house. She filled her oil pot, went back to the
kitchen, and, having lit her lamp, went again to the oil jar and filled
a large kettle full of oil. When it boiled she went and poured enough
oil into every jar to stifle and kill the robber inside. When this brave
deed was done she went back to the kitchen, put out the fire and the
lamp, and waited to see what would happen.

In a quarter of an hour the Captain of the robbers awoke, got up,
and opened the window. As all seemed quiet, he threw down some little
pebbles which hit the jars. He listened, and as none of his men seemed
to stir he grew uneasy, and went down into the yard. On going to the
first jar and saying, “Are you asleep?” he smelt the hot boiled oil, and
knew at once that his plot to murder Ali Baba and his household had been
discovered. He found all the gang was dead, and, missing the oil out of
the last jar, became aware of the manner of their death. He then forced
the lock of a door leading into a garden, and climbing over several
walls made his escape. Morgiana heard and saw all this, and, rejoicing
at her success, went to bed and fell asleep.

At daybreak Ali Baba arose, and, seeing the oil jars still there, asked
why the merchant had not gone with his mules. Morgiana bade him look
in the first jar and see if there was any oil. Seeing a man, he started
back in terror. “Have no fear,” said Morgiana; “the man cannot harm
you: he is dead.” Ali Baba, when he had recovered somewhat from his
astonishment, asked what had become of the merchant. “Merchant!” said
she, “he is no more a merchant than I am!” and she told him the whole
story, assuring him that it was a plot of the robbers of the forest, of
whom only three were left, and that the white and red chalk marks had
something to do with it. Ali Baba at once gave Morgiana her freedom,
saying that he owed her his life. They then buried the bodies in Ali
Baba’s garden, while the mules were sold in the market by his slaves.

The Captain returned to his lonely cave, which seemed frightful to
him without his lost companions, and firmly resolved to avenge them by
killing Ali Baba. He dressed himself carefully, and went into the town,
where he took lodgings in an inn. In the course of a great many journeys
to the forest he carried away many rich stuffs and much fine linen, and
set up a shop opposite that of Ali Baba’s son. He called himself Cogia
Hassan, and as he was both civil and well dressed he soon made friends
with Ali Baba’s son, and through him with Ali Baba, whom he was
continually asking to sup with him. Ali Baba, wishing to return his
kindness, invited him into his house and received him smiling, thanking
him for his kindness to his son. When the merchant was about to take his
leave Ali Baba stopped him, saying: “Where are you going, sir, in such
haste? Will you not stay and sup with me?” The merchant refused, saying
that he had a reason; and, on Ali Baba’s asking him what that was, he
replied: “It is, sir, that I can eat no victuals that have any salt
in them.” “If that is all,” said Ali Baba, “let me tell you that there
shall be no salt in either the meat or the bread that we eat to-night.”
 He went to give this order to Morgiana, who was much surprised. “Who is
this man,” she said, “who eats no salt with his meat?” “He is an honest
man, Morgiana,” returned her master; “therefore do as I bid you.” But
she could not withstand a desire to see this strange man, so she helped
Abdallah to carry up the dishes, and saw in a moment that Cogia Hassan
was the robber Captain, and carried a dagger under his garment. “I am
not surprised,” she said to herself, “that this wicked man, who intends
to kill my master, will eat no salt with him; but I will hinder his
plans.”

She sent up the supper by Abdallah, while she made ready for one of the
boldest acts that could be thought on. When the dessert had been served,
Cogia Hassan was left alone with Ali Baba and his son, whom he thought
to make drunk and then to murder them. Morgiana, meanwhile, put on a
head-dress like a dancing-girl’s, and clasped a girdle round her waist,
from which hung a dagger with a silver hilt, and said to Abdallah: “Take
your tabor, and let us go and divert our master and his guest.” Abdallah
took his tabor and played before Morgiana until they came to the door,
where Abdallah stopped playing and Morgiana made a low courtesy. “Come
in, Morgiana,” said Ali Baba, “and let Cogia Hassan see what you can
do”; and, turning to Cogia Hassan, he said: “She’s my slave and my
housekeeper.” Cogia Hassan was by no means pleased, for he feared
that his chance of killing Ali Baba was gone for the present; but he
pretended great eagerness to see Morgiana, and Abdallah began to play
and Morgiana to dance. After she had performed several dances she drew
her dagger and made passes with it, sometimes pointing it at her own
breast, sometimes at her master’s, as if it were part of the dance.
Suddenly, out of breath, she snatched the tabor from Abdallah with her
left hand, and, holding the dagger in her right hand, held out the tabor
to her master. Ali Baba and his son put a piece of gold into it, and
Cogia Hassan, seeing that she was coming to him, pulled out his purse to
make her a present, but while he was putting his hand into it Morgiana
plunged the dagger into his heart.

“Unhappy girl!” cried Ali Baba and his son, “what have you done to ruin
us?”

“It was to preserve you, master, not to ruin you,” answered Morgiana.
“See here,” opening the false merchant’s garment and showing the dagger;
“see what an enemy you have entertained! Remember, he would eat no salt
with you, and what more would you have? Look at him! he is both the
false oil merchant and the Captain of the Forty Thieves.”

Ali Baba was so grateful to Morgiana for thus saving his life that he
offered her to his son in marriage, who readily consented, and a few
days after the wedding was celebrated with greatest splendor.

At the end of a year Ali Baba, hearing nothing of the two remaining
robbers, judged they were dead, and set out to the cave. The door opened
on his saying: “Open Sesame!” He went in, and saw that nobody had been
there since the Captain left it. He brought away as much gold as he
could carry, and returned to town. He told his son the secret of
the cave, which his son handed down in his turn, so the children and
grandchildren of Ali Baba were rich to the end of their lives.


Once upon a time there dwelt on the outskirts of a large forest a poor
woodcutter with his wife and two children; the boy was called Hansel and
the girl Grettel. He had always little enough to live on, and once, when
there was a great famine in the land, he couldn’t even provide them with
daily bread. One night, as he was tossing about in bed, full of cares
and worry, he sighed and said to his wife: “What’s to become of us? how
are we to support our poor children, now that we have nothing more for
ourselves?” “I’ll tell you what, husband,” answered the woman; “early
to-morrow morning we’ll take the children out into the thickest part
of the wood; there we shall light a fire for them and give them each a
piece of bread; then we’ll go on to our work and leave them alone. They
won’t be able to find their way home, and we shall thus be rid of them.”
 “No, wife,” said her husband, “that I won’t do; how could I find it in
my heart to leave my children alone in the wood? The wild beasts would
soon come and tear them to pieces.” “Oh! you fool,” said she, “then we
must all four die of hunger, and you may just as well go and plane the
boards for our coffins”; and she left him no peace till he consented.
“But I can’t help feeling sorry for the poor children,” added the
husband.

The children, too, had not been able to sleep for hunger, and had heard
what their step-mother had said to their father. Grettel wept bitterly
and spoke to Hansel: “Now it’s all up with us.” “No, no, Grettel,” said
Hansel, “don’t fret yourself; I’ll be able to find a way to escape, no
fear.” And when the old people had fallen asleep he got up, slipped
on his little coat, opened the back door and stole out. The moon was
shining clearly, and the white pebbles which lay in front of the house
glittered like bits of silver. Hansel bent down and filled his pocket
with as many of them as he could cram in. Then he went back and said to
Grettel: “Be comforted, my dear little sister, and go to sleep: God will
not desert us”; and he lay down in bed again.

At daybreak, even before the sun was up, the woman came and woke the two
children: “Get up, you lie-abeds, we’re all going to the forest to fetch
wood.” She gave them each a bit of bread and said: “There’s something
for your luncheon, but don’t you eat it up before, for it’s all you’ll
get.” Grettel took the bread under her apron, as Hansel had the stones
in his pocket. Then they all set out together on the way to the forest.
After they had walked for a little, Hansel stood still and looked back
at the house, and this maneuver he repeated again and again. His father
observed him, and said: “Hansel, what are you gazing at there, and why
do you always remain behind? Take care, and don’t lose your footing.”
 “Oh! father,” said Hansel, “I am looking back at my white kitten, which
is sitting on the roof, waving me a farewell.” The woman exclaimed:
“What a donkey you are! that isn’t your kitten, that’s the morning sun
shining on the chimney.” But Hansel had not looked back at his kitten,
but had always dropped one of the white pebbles out of his pocket on to
the path.

When they had reached the middle of the forest the father said: “Now,
children, go and fetch a lot of wood, and I’ll light a fire that you
may not feel cold.” Hansel and Grettel heaped up brushwood till they had
made a pile nearly the size of a small hill. The brushwood was set fire
to, and when the flames leaped high the woman said: “Now lie down at the
fire, children, and rest yourselves: we are going into the forest to cut
down wood; when we’ve finished we’ll come back and fetch you.” Hansel
and Grettel sat down beside the fire, and at midday ate their little
bits of bread. They heard the strokes of the axe, so they thought their
father was quite near. But it was no axe they heard, but a bough he had
tied on a dead tree, and that was blown about by the wind. And when they
had sat for a long time their eyes closed with fatigue, and they fell
fast asleep. When they awoke at last it was pitch dark. Grettel began
to cry, and said: “How are we ever to get out of the wood?” But Hansel
comforted her. “Wait a bit,” he said, “till the moon is up, and then
we’ll find our way sure enough.” And when the full moon had risen he
took his sister by the hand and followed the pebbles, which shone like
new threepenny bits, and showed them the path. They walked on through
the night, and at daybreak reached their father’s house again. They
knocked at the door, and when the woman opened it she exclaimed: “You
naughty children, what a time you’ve slept in the wood! we thought
you were never going to come back.” But the father rejoiced, for
his conscience had reproached him for leaving his children behind by
themselves.

Not long afterward there was again great dearth in the land, and the
children heard their mother address their father thus in bed one night:
“Everything is eaten up once more; we have only half a loaf in the
house, and when that’s done it’s all up with us. The children must be
got rid of; we’ll lead them deeper into the wood this time, so that
they won’t be able to find their way out again. There is no other way
of saving ourselves.” The man’s heart smote him heavily, and he thought:
“Surely it would be better to share the last bite with one’s children!”
 But his wife wouldn’t listen to his arguments, and did nothing but scold
and reproach him. If a man yields once he’s done for, and so, because he
had given in the first time, he was forced to do so the second.

But the children were awake, and had heard the conversation. When the
old people were asleep Hansel got up, and wanted to go out and pick up
pebbles again, as he had done the first time; but the woman had barred
the door, and Hansel couldn’t get out. But he consoled his little
sister, and said: “Don’t cry, Grettel, and sleep peacefully, for God is
sure to help us.”

At early dawn the woman came and made the children get up. They received
their bit of bread, but it was even smaller than the time before. On the
way to the wood Hansel crumbled it in his pocket, and every few minutes
he stood still and dropped a crumb on the ground. “Hansel, what are you
stopping and looking about you for?” said the father. “I’m looking back
at my little pigeon, which is sitting on the roof waving me a farewell,”
 answered Hansel. “Fool!” said the wife; “that isn’t your pigeon, it’s
the morning sun glittering on the chimney.” But Hansel gradually threw
all his crumbs on the path. The woman led the children still deeper into
the forest farther than they had ever been in their lives before. Then
a big fire was lit again, and the mother said: “Just sit down there,
children, and if you’re tired you can sleep a bit; we’re going into the
forest to cut down wood, and in the evening when we’re finished we’ll
come back to fetch you.” At midday Grettel divided her bread with
Hansel, for he had strewn his all along their path. Then they fell
asleep, and evening passed away, but nobody came to the poor children.
They didn’t awake till it was pitch dark, and Hansel comforted his
sister, saying: “Only wait, Grettel, till the moon rises, then we shall
see the bread-crumbs I scattered along the path; they will show us the
way back to the house.” When the moon appeared they got up, but they
found no crumbs, for the thousands of birds that fly about the woods
and fields had picked them all up. “Never mind,” said Hansel to Grettel;
“you’ll see we’ll find a way out”; but all the same they did not. They
wandered about the whole night, and the next day, from morning till
evening, but they could not find a path out of the wood. They were very
hungry, too, for they had nothing to eat but a few berries they found
growing on the ground. And at last they were so tired that their legs
refused to carry them any longer, so they lay down under a tree and fell
fast asleep.

On the third morning after they had left their father’s house they set
about their wandering again, but only got deeper and deeper into the
wood, and now they felt that if help did not come to them soon they must
perish. At midday they saw a beautiful little snow-white bird sitting on
a branch, which sang so sweetly that they stopped still and listened to
it. And when its song was finished it flapped its wings and flew on in
front of them. They followed it and came to a little house, on the roof
of which it perched; and when they came quite near they saw that the
cottage was made of bread and roofed with cakes, while the window was
made of transparent sugar. “Now we’ll set to,” said Hansel, “and have a
regular blow-out.(1) I’ll eat a bit of the roof, and you, Grettel,
can eat some of the window, which you’ll find a sweet morsel.” Hansel
stretched up his hand and broke off a little bit of the roof to see what
it was like, and Grettel went to the casement and began to nibble at it.
Thereupon a shrill voice called out from the room inside:

  “Nibble, nibble, little mouse,
  Who’s nibbling my house?”

The children answered:

  “Tis Heaven’s own child,
  The tempest wild,”

and went on eating, without putting themselves about. Hansel, who
thoroughly appreciated the roof, tore down a big bit of it, while
Grettel pushed out a whole round window-pane, and sat down the better
to enjoy it. Suddenly the door opened, and an ancient dame leaning on
a staff hobbled out. Hansel and Grettel were so terrified that they let
what they had in their hands fall. But the old woman shook her head and
said: “Oh, ho! you dear children, who led you here? Just come in and
stay with me, no ill shall befall you.” She took them both by the hand
and let them into the house, and laid a most sumptuous dinner before
them--milk and sugared pancakes, with apples and nuts. After they had
finished, two beautiful little white beds were prepared for them, and
when Hansel and Grettel lay down in them they felt as if they had got
into heaven.


The old woman had appeared to be most friendly, but she was really an
old witch who had waylaid the children, and had only built the little
bread house in order to lure them in. When anyone came into her power
she killed, cooked, and ate him, and held a regular feast-day for the
occasion. Now witches have red eyes, and cannot see far, but, like
beasts, they have a keen sense of smell, and know when human beings pass
by. When Hansel and Grettel fell into her hands she laughed maliciously,
and said jeeringly: “I’ve got them now; they sha’n’t escape me.” Early
in the morning, before the children were awake, she rose up, and when
she saw them both sleeping so peacefully, with their round rosy cheeks,
she muttered to herself: “That’ll be a dainty bite.” Then she seized
Hansel with her bony hand and carried him into a little stable, and
barred the door on him; he might scream as much as he liked, it did him
no good. Then she went to Grettel, shook her till she awoke, and
cried: “Get up, you lazy-bones, fetch water and cook something for your
brother. When he’s fat I’ll eat him up.” Grettel began to cry bitterly,
but it was of no use; she had to do what the wicked witch bade her.

So the best food was cooked for poor Hansel, but Grettel got nothing but
crab-shells. Every morning the old woman hobbled out to the stable and
cried: “Hansel, put out your finger, that I may feel if you are getting
fat.” But Hansel always stretched out a bone, and the old dame, whose
eyes were dim, couldn’t see it, and thinking always it was Hansel’s
finger, wondered why he fattened so slowly. When four weeks had passed
and Hansel still remained thin, she lost patience and determined to wait
no longer. “Hi, Grettel,” she called to the girl, “be quick and get some
water. Hansel may be fat or thin, I’m going to kill him to-morrow and
cook him.” Oh! how the poor little sister sobbed as she carried the
water, and how the tears rolled down her cheeks! “Kind heaven help us
now!” she cried; “if only the wild beasts in the wood had eaten us, then
at least we should have died together.” “Just hold your peace,” said the
old hag; “it won’t help you.”

Early in the morning Grettel had to go out and hang up the kettle full
of water, and light the fire. “First we’ll bake,” said the old dame;
“I’ve heated the oven already and kneaded the dough.” She pushed Grettel
out to the oven, from which fiery flames were already issuing. “Creep
in,” said the witch, “and see if it’s properly heated, so that we can
shove in the bread.” For when she had got Grettel in she meant to close
the oven and let the girl bake, that she might eat her up too. But
Grettel perceived her intention, and said: “I don’t know how I’m to do
it; how do I get in?” “You silly goose!” said the hag, “the opening is
big enough; see, I could get in myself,” and she crawled toward it, and
poked her head into the oven. Then Grettel gave her a shove that sent
her right in, shut the iron door, and drew the bolt. Gracious! how she
yelled, it was quite horrible; but Grettel fled, and the wretched old
woman was left to perish miserably.

Grettel flew straight to Hansel, opened the little stable-door, and
cried: “Hansel, we are free; the old witch is dead.” Then Hansel sprang
like a bird out of a cage when the door is opened. How they rejoiced,
and fell on each other’s necks, and jumped for joy, and kissed one
another! And as they had no longer any cause for fear, they went in the
old hag’s house, and here they found, in every corner of the room, boxes
with pearls and precious stones. “These are even better than pebbles,”
 said Hansel, and crammed his pockets full of them; and Grettel said:
“I too will bring something home,” and she filled her apron full. “But
now,” said Hansel, “let’s go and get well away from the witch’s wood.”
 When they had wandered about for some hours they came to a big lake.
“We can’t get over,” said Hansel; “I see no bridge of any sort or kind.”
 “Yes, and there’s no ferry-boat either,” answered Grettel; “but look,
there swims a white duck; if I ask her she’ll help us over,” and she
called out:

  “Here are two children, mournful very,
  Seeing neither bridge nor ferry;
  Take us upon your white back,
  And row us over, quack, quack!”


The duck swam toward them, and Hansel got on her back and bade his
little sister sit beside him. “No,” answered Grettel, “we should be too
heavy a load for the duck: she shall carry us across separately.” The
good bird did this, and when they were landed safely on the other side,
and had gone for a while, the wood became more and more familiar to
them, and at length they saw their father’s house in the distance. Then
they set off to run, and bounding into the room fell on their father’s
neck. The man had not passed a happy hour since he left them in the
wood, but the woman had died. Grettel shook out her apron so that the
pearls and precious stones rolled about the room, and Hansel threw down
one handful after the other out of his pocket. Thus all their troubles
were ended, and they lived happily ever afterward.

My story is done. See! there runs a little mouse; anyone who catches it
may make himself a large fur cap out of it.



A poor widow once lived in a little cottage with a garden in front of
it, in which grew two rose trees, one bearing white roses and the other
red. She had two children, who were just like the two rose trees; one
was called Snow-white and the other Rose-red, and they were the sweetest
and best children in the world, always diligent and always cheerful; but
Snow-white was quieter and more gentle than Rose-red. Rose-red loved
to run about the fields and meadows, and to pick flowers and catch
butterflies; but Snow-white sat at home with her mother and helped her
in the household, or read aloud to her when there was no work to do. The
two children loved each other so dearly that they always walked about
hand in hand whenever they went out together, and when Snow-white said,
“We will never desert each other,” Rose-red answered: “No, not as long
as we live”; and the mother added: “Whatever one gets she shall share
with the other.” They often roamed about in the woods gathering berries
and no beast offered to hurt them; on the contrary, they came up to them
in the most confiding manner; the little hare would eat a cabbage leaf
from their hands, the deer grazed beside them, the stag would bound past
them merrily, and the birds remained on the branches and sang to them
with all their might.

No evil ever befell them; if they tarried late in the wood and night
overtook them, they lay down together on the moss and slept till
morning, and their mother knew they were quite safe, and never felt
anxious about them. Once, when they had slept all night in the wood and
had been wakened by the morning sun, they perceived a beautiful child
in a shining white robe sitting close to their resting-place. The figure
got up, looked at them kindly, but said nothing, and vanished into the
wood. And when they looked round about them they became aware that they
had slept quite close to a precipice, over which they would certainly
have fallen had they gone on a few steps further in the darkness. And
when they told their mother of their adventure, she said what they had
seen must have been the angel that guards good children.

Snow-white and Rose-red kept their mother’s cottage so beautifully clean
and neat that it was a pleasure to go into it. In summer Rose-red looked
after the house, and every morning before her mother awoke she placed
a bunch of flowers before the bed, from each tree a rose. In winter
Snow-white lit the fire and put on the kettle, which was made of brass,
but so beautifully polished that it shone like gold. In the evening when
the snowflakes fell their mother said: “Snow-white, go and close the
shutters,” and they drew round the fire, while the mother put on her
spectacles and read aloud from a big book and the two girls listened and
sat and span. Beside them on the ground lay a little lamb, and behind
them perched a little white dove with its head tucked under its wings.

One evening as they sat thus cosily together someone knocked at the door
as though he desired admittance. The mother said: “Rose-red, open
the door quickly; it must be some traveler seeking shelter.” Rose-red
hastened to unbar the door, and thought she saw a poor man standing in
the darkness outside; but it was no such thing, only a bear, who poked
his thick black head through the door. Rose-red screamed aloud and
sprang back in terror, the lamb began to bleat, the dove flapped its
wings, and Snow-white ran and hid behind her mother’s bed. But the bear
began to speak, and said: “Don’t be afraid: I won’t hurt you. I am half
frozen, and only wish to warm myself a little.” “My poor bear,” said the
mother, “lie down by the fire, only take care you don’t burn your fur.”
 Then she called out: “Snow-white and Rose-red, come out; the bear will
do you no harm; he is a good, honest creature.” So they both came out of
their hiding-places, and gradually the lamb and dove drew near too, and
they all forgot their fear. The bear asked the children to beat the snow
a little out of his fur, and they fetched a brush and scrubbed him till
he was dry. Then the beast stretched himself in front of the fire, and
growled quite happily and comfortably. The children soon grew quite at
their ease with him, and led their helpless guest a fearful life. They
tugged his fur with their hands, put their small feet on his back, and
rolled him about here and there, or took a hazel wand and beat him
with it; and if he growled they only laughed. The bear submitted to
everything with the best possible good-nature, only when they went too
far he cried: “Oh! children, spare my life!

  “Snow-white and Rose-red,
  Don’t beat your lover dead.”

When it was time to retire for the night, and the others went to bed,
the mother said to the bear: “You can lie there on the hearth, in
heaven’s name; it will be shelter for you from the cold and wet.” As
soon as day dawned the children led him out, and he trotted over the
snow into the wood. From this time on the bear came every evening at
the same hour, and lay down by the hearth and let the children play what
pranks they liked with him; and they got so accustomed to him that the
door was never shut till their black friend had made his appearance.

When spring came, and all outside was green, the bear said one morning
to Snow-white: “Now I must go away, and not return again the whole
summer.” “Where are you going to, dear bear?” asked Snow-white. “I
must go to the wood and protect my treasure from the wicked dwarfs.
In winter, when the earth is frozen hard, they are obliged to remain
underground, for they can’t work their way through; but now, when the
sun has thawed and warmed the ground, they break through and come up
above to spy the land and steal what they can; what once falls into
their hands and into their caves is not easily brought back to light.”
 Snow-white was quite sad over their friend’s departure, and when she
unbarred the door for him, the bear, stepping out, caught a piece of
his fur in the door-knocker, and Snow-white thought she caught sight of
glittering gold beneath it, but she couldn’t be certain of it; and the
bear ran hastily away, and soon disappeared behind the trees.

A short time after this the mother sent the children into the wood to
collect fagots. They came in their wanderings upon a big tree which lay
felled on the ground, and on the trunk among the long grass they
noticed something jumping up and down, but what it was they couldn’t
distinguish. When they approached nearer they perceived a dwarf with a
wizened face and a beard a yard long. The end of the beard was jammed
into a cleft of the tree, and the little man sprang about like a dog
on a chain, and didn’t seem to know what he was to do. He glared at the
girls with his fiery red eyes, and screamed out: “What are you standing
there for? Can’t you come and help me?” “What were you doing, little
man?” asked Rose-red. “You stupid, inquisitive goose!” replied the
dwarf; “I wanted to split the tree, in order to get little chips of
wood for our kitchen fire; those thick logs that serve to make fires for
coarse, greedy people like yourselves quite burn up all the little food
we need. I had successfully driven in the wedge, and all was going well,
but the cursed wood was so slippery that it suddenly sprang out, and the
tree closed up so rapidly that I had no time to take my beautiful white
beard out, so here I am stuck fast, and I can’t get away; and you silly,
smooth-faced, milk-and-water girls just stand and laugh! Ugh! what
wretches you are!”

The children did all in their power, but they couldn’t get the beard
out; it was wedged in far too firmly. “I will run and fetch somebody,”
 said Rose-red. “Crazy blockheads!” snapped the dwarf; “what’s the good
of calling anyone else? You’re already two too many for me. Does
nothing better occur to you than that?” “Don’t be so impatient,” said
Snow-white, “I’ll see you get help,” and taking her scissors out of
her pocket she cut off the end of his beard. As soon as the dwarf felt
himself free he seized a bag full of gold which was hidden among the
roots of the tree, lifted it up, and muttered aloud: “Curse these rude
wretches, cutting off a piece of my splendid beard!” With these words he
swung the bag over his back, and disappeared without as much as looking
at the children again.

Shortly after this Snow-white and Rose-red went out to get a dish of
fish. As they approached the stream they saw something which looked like
an enormous grasshopper springing toward the water as if it were going
to jump in. They ran forward and recognized their old friend the dwarf.
“Where are you going to?” asked Rose-red; “you’re surely not going to
jump into the water?” “I’m not such a fool,” screamed the dwarf. “Don’t
you see that cursed fish is trying to drag me in?” The little man
had been sitting on the bank fishing, when unfortunately the wind had
entangled his beard in the line; and when immediately afterward a big
fish bit, the feeble little creature had no strength to pull it out; the
fish had the upper fin, and dragged the dwarf toward him. He clung on
with all his might to every rush and blade of grass, but it didn’t help
him much; he had to follow every movement of the fish, and was in great
danger of being drawn into the water. The girls came up just at the
right moment, held him firm, and did all they could to disentangle his
beard from the line; but in vain, beard and line were in a hopeless
muddle. Nothing remained but to produce the scissors and cut the beard,
by which a small part of it was sacrificed.

When the dwarf perceived what they were about he yelled to them: “Do
you call that manners, you toad-stools! to disfigure a fellow’s face? It
wasn’t enough that you shortened my beard before, but you must now
needs cut off the best bit of it. I can’t appear like this before my own
people. I wish you’d been in Jericho first.” Then he fetched a sack of
pearls that lay among the rushes, and without saying another word he
dragged it away and disappeared behind a stone.

It happened that soon after this the mother sent the two girls to the
town to buy needles, thread, laces, and ribbons. Their road led over a
heath where huge boulders of rock lay scattered here and there. While
trudging along they saw a big bird hovering in the air, circling slowly
above them, but always descending lower, till at last it settled on
a rock not far from them. Immediately afterward they heard a sharp,
piercing cry. They ran forward, and saw with horror that the eagle had
pounced on their old friend the dwarf, and was about to carry him off.
The tender-hearted children seized hold of the little man, and struggled
so long with the bird that at last he let go his prey. When the dwarf
had recovered from the first shock he screamed in his screeching voice:
“Couldn’t you have treated me more carefully? You have torn my thin
little coat all to shreds, useless, awkward hussies that you are!” Then
he took a bag of precious stones and vanished under the rocks into his
cave. The girls were accustomed to his ingratitude, and went on their
way and did their business in town. On their way home, as they were
again passing the heath, they surprised the dwarf pouring out his
precious stones on an open space, for he had thought no one would pass
by at so late an hour. The evening sun shone on the glittering stones,
and they glanced and gleamed so beautifully that the children stood
still and gazed on them. “What are you standing there gaping for?”
 screamed the dwarf, and his ashen-gray face became scarlet with rage.
He was about to go off with these angry words when a sudden growl was
heard, and a black bear trotted out of the wood. The dwarf jumped up in
great fright, but he hadn’t time to reach his place of retreat, for the
bear was already close to him. Then he cried in terror: “Dear Mr.
Bear, spare me! I’ll give you all my treasure. Look at those beautiful
precious stones lying there. Spare my life! what pleasure would you get
from a poor feeble little fellow like me? You won’t feel me between your
teeth. There, lay hold of these two wicked girls, they will be a tender
morsel for you, as fat as young quails; eat them up, for heaven’s sake.”
 But the bear, paying no attention to his words, gave the evil little
creature one blow with his paw, and he never moved again.

The girls had run away, but the bear called after them: “Snow-white
and Rose-red, don’t be afraid; wait, and I’ll come with you.” Then they
recognized his voice and stood still, and when the bear was quite close
to them his skin suddenly fell off, and a beautiful man stood beside
them, all dressed in gold. “I am a king’s son,” he said, “and have been
doomed by that unholy little dwarf, who had stolen my treasure, to roam
about the woods as a wild bear till his death should set me free. Now he
has got his well-merited punishment.”

Snow-white married him, and Rose-red his brother, and they divided the
great treasure the dwarf had collected in his cave between them. The
old mother lived for many years peacefully with her children; and she
carried the two rose trees with her, and they stood in front of her
window, and every year they bore the finest red and white roses.



Once upon a time an old queen, whose husband had been dead for many
years, had a beautiful daughter. When she grew up she was betrothed to
a prince who lived a great way off. Now, when the time drew near for her
to be married and to depart into a foreign kingdom, her old mother gave
her much costly baggage, and many ornaments, gold and silver, trinkets
and knicknacks, and, in fact, everything that belonged to a royal
trousseau, for she loved her daughter very dearly. She gave her a
waiting-maid also, who was to ride with her and hand her over to the
bridegroom, and she provided each of them with a horse for the journey.
Now the Princess’s horse was called Falada, and could speak.

When the hour for departure drew near the old mother went to her
bedroom, and taking a small knife she cut her fingers till they bled;
then she held a white rag under them, and letting three drops of blood
fall into it, she gave it to her daughter, and said: “Dear child, take
great care of this rag: it may be of use to you on the journey.”

So they took a sad farewell of each other, and the Princess stuck the
rag in front of her dress, mounted her horse, and set forth on the
journey to her bridegroom’s kingdom. After they had ridden for about
an hour the Princess began to feel very thirsty, and said to her
waiting-maid: “Pray get down and fetch me some water in my golden cup
out of yonder stream: I would like a drink.” “If you’re thirsty,” said
the maid, “dismount yourself, and lie down by the water and drink; I
don’t mean to be your servant any longer.” The Princess was so thirsty
that she got down, bent over the stream, and drank, for she wasn’t
allowed to drink out of the golden goblet. As she drank she murmured:
“Oh! heaven, what am I to do?” and the three drops of blood replied:

  “If your mother only knew,
  Her heart would surely break in two.”

But the Princess was meek, and said nothing about her maid’s rude
behavior, and quietly mounted her horse again. They rode on their
way for several miles, but the day was hot, and the sun’s rays smote
fiercely on them, so that the Princess was soon overcome by thirst
again. And as they passed a brook she called once more to her
waiting-maid: “Pray get down and give me a drink from my golden
cup,” for she had long ago forgotten her maid’s rude words. But the
waiting-maid replied, more haughtily even than before: “If you want a
drink, you can dismount and get it; I don’t mean to be your servant.”
 Then the Princess was compelled by her thirst to get down, and bending
over the flowing water she cried and said: “Oh! heaven, what am I to
do?” and the three drops of blood replied:

  “If your mother only knew,
  Her heart would surely break in two.”

And as she drank thus, and leaned right over the water, the rag
containing the three drops of blood fell from her bosom and floated down
the stream, and she in her anxiety never even noticed her loss. But the
waiting-maid had observed it with delight, as she knew it gave her power
over the bride, for in losing the drops of blood the Princess had become
weak and powerless. When she wished to get on her horse Falada again,
the waiting-maid called out: “I mean to ride Falada: you must mount
my beast”; and this too she had to submit to. Then the waiting-maid
commanded her harshly to take off her royal robes, and to put on her
common ones, and finally she made her swear by heaven not to say a word
about the matter when they reached the palace; and if she hadn’t taken
this oath she would have been killed on the spot. But Falada observed
everything, and laid it all to heart.

The waiting-maid now mounted Falada, and the real bride the worse horse,
and so they continued their journey till at length they arrived at the
palace yard. There was great rejoicing over the arrival, and the Prince
sprang forward to meet them, and taking the waiting-maid for his bride,
he lifted her down from her horse and led her upstairs to the royal
chamber. In the meantime the real Princess was left standing below in
the courtyard. The old King, who was looking out of his window, beheld
her in this plight, and it struck him how sweet and gentle, even
beautiful, she looked. He went at once to the royal chamber, and asked
the bride who it was she had brought with her and had left thus standing
in the court below. “Oh!” replied the bride, “I brought her with me to
keep me company on the journey; give the girl something to do, that she
may not be idle.” But the old King had no work for her, and couldn’t
think of anything; so he said, “I’ve a small boy who looks after the
geese, she’d better help him.” The youth’s name was Curdken, and the
real bride was made to assist him in herding geese.

Soon after this the false bride said to the Prince: “Dearest husband,
I pray you grant me a favor.” He answered: “That I will.” “Then let the
slaughterer cut off the head of the horse I rode here upon, because it
behaved very badly on the journey.” But the truth was she was afraid
lest the horse should speak and tell how she had treated the Princess.
She carried her point, and the faithful Falada was doomed to die.
When the news came to the ears of the real Princess she went to the
slaughterer, and secretly promised him a piece of gold if he would do
something for her. There was in the town a large dark gate, through
which she had to pass night and morning with the geese; would he “kindly
hang up Falada’s head there, that she might see it once again?” The
slaughterer said he would do as she desired, chopped off the head, and
nailed it firmly over the gateway.

Early next morning, as she and Curdken were driving their flock through
the gate, she said as she passed under:


  “Oh! Falada, ‘tis you hang there”;

and the head replied:

  “‘Tis you; pass under, Princess fair:
  If your mother only knew,
  Her heart would surely break in two.”

Then she left the tower and drove the geese into a field. And when they
had reached the common where the geese fed she sat down and unloosed
her hair, which was of pure gold. Curdken loved to see it glitter in the
sun, and wanted much to pull some hair out. Then she spoke:

  “Wind, wind, gently sway,
  Blow Curdken’s hat away;
  Let him chase o’er field and wold
  Till my locks of ruddy gold,
  Now astray and hanging down,
  Be combed and plaited in a crown.”


Then a gust of wind blew Curdken’s hat away, and he had to chase it over
hill and dale. When he returned from the pursuit she had finished
her combing and curling, and his chance of getting any hair was gone.
Curdken was very angry, and wouldn’t speak to her. So they herded the
geese till evening and then went home.

The next morning, as they passed under the gate, the girl said:

  “Oh! Falada, ‘tis you hang there;”

and the head replied:

  “‘Tis you; pass under, Princess fair:
  If your mother only knew,
  Her heart would surely break in two.”

Then she went on her way till she came to the common, where she sat down
and began to comb out her hair; then Curdken ran up to her and wanted to
grasp some of the hair from her head, but she called out hastily:

  “Wind, wind, gently sway,
  Blow Curdken’s hat away;
  Let him chase o’er field and wold
  Till my locks of ruddy gold,
  Now astray and hanging down,
  Be combed and plaited in a crown.”


Then a puff of wind came and blew Curdken’s hat far away, so that he had
to run after it; and when he returned she had long finished putting
up her golden locks, and he couldn’t get any hair; so they watched the
geese till it was dark.

But that evening when they got home Curdken went to the old King, and
said: “I refuse to herd geese any longer with that girl.” “For what
reason?” asked the old King. “Because she does nothing but annoy me
all day long,” replied Curdken; and he proceeded to relate all her
iniquities, and said: “Every morning as we drive the flock through the
dark gate she says to a horse’s head that hangs on the wall:

     “‘Oh! Falada, ‘tis you hang there’;

and the head replies:

     “‘’Tis you; pass under, Princess fair:
     If your mother only knew,
     Her heart would surely break in two.’”


And Curdken went on to tell what passed on the common where the geese
fed, and how he had always to chase his hat.

The old King bade him go and drive forth his flock as usual next day;
and when morning came he himself took up his position behind the dark
gate, and heard how the goose-girl greeted Falada. Then he followed her
through the field, and hid himself behind a bush on the common. He soon
saw with his own eyes how the goose-boy and the goose-girl looked after
the geese, and how after a time the maiden sat down and loosed her hair,
that glittered like gold, and repeated:

  “Wind, wind, gently sway,
  Blow Curdken’s hat away;
  Let him chase o’er field and wold
  Till my locks of ruddy gold
  Now astray and hanging down,
  Be combed and plaited in a crown.”

Then a gust of wind came and blew Curdken’s hat away, so that he had to
fly over hill and dale after it, and the girl in the meantime quietly
combed and plaited her hair: all this the old King observed, and
returned to the palace without anyone having noticed him. In the evening
when the goose-girl came home he called her aside, and asked her why she
behaved as she did. “I may not tell you why; how dare I confide my woes
to anyone? for I swore not to by heaven, otherwise I should have lost my
life.” The old King begged her to tell him all, and left her no peace,
but he could get nothing out of her. At last he said: “Well, if you
won’t tell me, confide your trouble to the iron stove there,” and he
went away. Then she crept to the stove, and began to sob and cry and to
pour out her poor little heart, and said: “Here I sit, deserted by all
the world, I who am a king’s daughter, and a false waiting-maid has
forced me to take off my own clothes, and has taken my place with my
bridegroom, while I have to fulfill the lowly office of goose-girl.

  “If my mother only knew
  Her heart would surely break in two.”


But the old King stood outside at the stove chimney, and listened to her
words. Then he entered the room again, and bidding her leave the stove,
he ordered royal apparel to be put on her, in which she looked amazingly
lovely. Then he summoned his son, and revealed to him that he had got
the false bride, who was nothing but a waiting-maid, while the real one,
in the guise of the ex-goose-girl, was standing at his side. The young
King rejoiced from his heart when he saw her beauty and learned how good
she was, and a great banquet was prepared, to which everyone was bidden.
The bridegroom sat at the head of the table, the Princess on one side of
him and the waiting-maid on the other; but she was so dazzled that she
did not recognize the Princess in her glittering garments. Now when they
had eaten and drunk, and were merry, the old King asked the waiting-maid
to solve a knotty point for him. “What,” said he, “should be done to a
certain person who has deceived everyone?” and he proceeded to relate
the whole story, ending up with, “Now what sentence should be passed?”
 Then the false bride answered: “She deserves to be put stark naked into
a barrel lined with sharp nails, which should be dragged by two white
horses up and down the street till she is dead.”

“You are the person,” said the King, “and you have passed sentence on
yourself; and even so it shall be done to you.” And when the sentence
had been carried out the young King was married to his real bride, and
both reigned over the kingdom in peace and happiness.



THERE was once upon a time a widow who had two daughters. The eldest
was so much like her in the face and humor that whoever looked upon the
daughter saw the mother. They were both so disagreeable and so proud
that there was no living with them.

The youngest, who was the very picture of her father for courtesy and
sweetness of temper, was withal one of the most beautiful girls ever
seen. As people naturally love their own likeness, this mother even
doted on her eldest daughter and at the same time had a horrible
aversion for the youngest--she made her eat in the kitchen and work
continually.

Among other things, this poor child was forced twice a day to draw water
above a mile and a-half off the house, and bring home a pitcher full
of it. One day, as she was at this fountain, there came to her a poor
woman, who begged of her to let her drink.

“Oh! ay, with all my heart, Goody,” said this pretty little girl;
and rinsing immediately the pitcher, she took up some water from the
clearest place of the fountain, and gave it to her, holding up the
pitcher all the while, that she might drink the easier.

The good woman, having drunk, said to her:

“You are so very pretty, my dear, so good and so mannerly, that I cannot
help giving you a gift.” For this was a fairy, who had taken the form
of a poor country woman, to see how far the civility and good manners of
this pretty girl would go. “I will give you for a gift,” continued the
Fairy, “that, at every word you speak, there shall come out of your
mouth either a flower or a jewel.”

When this pretty girl came home her mother scolded her for staying so
long at the fountain.

“I beg your pardon, mamma,” said the poor girl, “for not making more
haste.”

And in speaking these words there came out of her mouth two roses, two
pearls, and two diamonds.

“What is it I see there?” said the mother, quite astonished. “I think I
see pearls and diamonds come out of the girl’s mouth! How happens this,
child?”

This was the first time she had ever called her child.

The poor creature told her frankly all the matter, not without dropping
out infinite numbers of diamonds.

“In good faith,” cried the mother, “I must send my child thither.
Come hither, Fanny; look what comes out of thy sister’s mouth when she
speaks. Wouldst not thou be glad, my dear, to have the same gift given
thee? Thou hast nothing else to do but go and draw water out of the
fountain, and when a certain poor woman asks you to let her drink, to
give it to her very civilly.”

“It would be a very fine sight indeed,” said this ill-bred minx, “to see
me go draw water.”

“You shall go, hussy!” said the mother; “and this minute.”

So away she went, but grumbling all the way, taking with her the best
silver tankard in the house.

She was no sooner at the fountain than she saw coming out of the wood
a lady most gloriously dressed, who came up to her, and asked to drink.
This was, you must know, the very fairy who appeared to her sister,
but now had taken the air and dress of a princess, to see how far this
girl’s rudeness would go.

“Am I come hither,” said the proud, saucy one, “to serve you with water,
pray? I suppose the silver tankard was brought purely for your ladyship,
was it? However, you may drink out of it, if you have a fancy.”

“You are not over and above mannerly,” answered the Fairy, without
putting herself in a passion. “Well, then, since you have so little
breeding, and are so disobliging, I give you for a gift that at every
word you speak there shall come out of your mouth a snake or a toad.”

So soon as her mother saw her coming she cried out:

“Well, daughter?”

“Well, mother?” answered the pert hussy, throwing out of her mouth two
vipers and two toads.

“Oh! mercy,” cried the mother; “what is it I see? Oh! it is that wretch
her sister who has occasioned all this; but she shall pay for it”; and
immediately she ran to beat her. The poor child fled away from her, and
went to hide herself in the forest, not far from thence.

The King’s son, then on his return from hunting, met her, and seeing her
so very pretty, asked her what she did there alone and why she cried.

“Alas! sir, my mamma has turned me out of doors.”

The King’s son, who saw five or six pearls and as many diamonds come out
of her mouth, desired her to tell him how that happened. She thereupon
told him the whole story; and so the King’s son fell in love with
her, and, considering himself that such a gift was worth more than any
marriage portion, conducted her to the palace of the King his father,
and there married her.

As for the sister, she made herself so much hated that her own mother
turned her off; and the miserable wretch, having wandered about a good
while without finding anybody to take her in, went to a corner of the
wood, and there died.


ONCE upon a time there lived a king who was so just and kind that his
subjects called him “the Good King.” It happened one day, when he was
out hunting, that a little white rabbit, which his dogs were chasing,
sprang into his arms for shelter. The King stroked it gently, and said
to it:

“Well, bunny, as you have come to me for protection I will see that
nobody hurts you.”

And he took it home to his palace and had it put in a pretty little
house, with all sorts of nice things to eat.

That night, when he was alone in his room, a beautiful lady suddenly
appeared before him; her long dress was as white as snow, and she had
a crown of white roses upon her head. The good King was very much
surprised to see her, for he knew his door had been tightly shut, and he
could not think how she had got in. But she said to him:

“I am the Fairy Truth. I was passing through the wood when you were out
hunting, and I wished to find out if you were really good, as everybody
said you were, so I took the shape of a little rabbit and came to your
arms for shelter, for I know that those who are merciful to animals will
be still kinder to their fellow-men. If you had refused to help me
I should have been certain that you were wicked. I thank you for the
kindness you have shown me, which has made me your friend for ever. You
have only to ask me for anything you want and I promise that I will give
it to you.”

“Madam,” said the good King, “since you are a fairy you no doubt know
all my wishes. I have but one son whom I love very dearly, that is why
he is called Prince Darling. If you are really good enough to wish to do
me a favor, I beg that you will become his friend.”

“With all my heart,” answered the Fairy. “I can make your son the
handsomest prince in the world, or the richest, or the most powerful;
choose whichever you like for him.”

“I do not ask either of these things for my son,” replied the good
King; “but if you will make him the best of princes, I shall indeed be
grateful to you. What good would it do him to be rich, or handsome, or
to possess all the kingdoms of the world if he were wicked? You
know well he would still be unhappy. Only a good man can be really
contented.”

“You are quite right,” answered the Fairy; “but it is not in my power to
make Prince Darling a good man unless he will help me; he must himself
try hard to become good, I can only promise to give him good advice, to
scold him for his faults, and to punish him if he will not correct and
punish himself.”

The good King was quite satisfied with this promise; and very soon
afterward he died.

Prince Darling was very sorry, for he loved his father with all his
heart, and he would willingly have given all his kingdoms and all his
treasures of gold and silver if they could have kept the good King with
him.

Two days afterward, when the Prince had gone to bed, the Fairy suddenly
appeared to him and said:

“I promised your father that I would be your friend, and to keep my word
I have come to bring you a present.” At the same time she put a little
gold ring upon his finger.

“Take great care of this ring,” she said: “it is more precious than
diamonds; every time you do a bad deed it will prick your finger, but
if, in spite of its pricking, you go on in your own evil way, you will
lose my friendship, and I shall become your enemy.”

So saying, the Fairy disappeared, leaving Prince Darling very much
astonished.

For some time he behaved so well that the ring never pricked him, and
that made him so contented that his subjects called him Prince Darling
the Happy.

One day, however, he went out hunting, but could get no sport, which
put him in a very bad temper; it seemed to him as he rode along that his
ring was pressing into his finger, but as it did not prick him he did
not heed it. When he got home and went to his own room, his little dog
Bibi ran to meet him, jumping round him with pleasure. “Get away!” said
the Prince, quite gruffly. “I don’t want you, you are in the way.”

The poor little dog, who didn’t understand this at all, pulled at his
coat to make him at least look at her, and this made Prince Darling so
cross that he gave her quite a hard kick.

Instantly his ring pricked him sharply, as if it had been a pin. He was
very much surprised, and sat down in a corner of his room feeling quite
ashamed of himself.

“I believe the Fairy is laughing at me,” he thought. “Surely I can have
done no great wrong in just kicking a tiresome animal! What is the good
of my being ruler of a great kingdom if I am not even allowed to beat my
own dog?”

“I am not making fun of you,” said a voice, answering Prince Darling’s
thoughts. “You have committed three faults. First of all, you were out
of temper because you could not have what you wanted, and you thought
all men and animals were only made to do your pleasure; then you were
really angry, which is very naughty indeed; and lastly, you were
cruel to a poor little animal who did not in the least deserve to be
ill-treated.

“I know you are far above a little dog, but if it were right and
allowable that great people should ill-treat all who are beneath them, I
might at this moment beat you, or kill you, for a fairy is greater than
a man. The advantage of possessing a great empire is not to be able to
do the evil that one desires, but to do all the good that one possibly
can.”

The Prince saw how naughty he had been, and promised to try and do
better in future, but he did not keep his word. The fact was he had been
brought up by a foolish nurse, who had spoiled him when he was little.
If he wanted anything he only had to cry and fret and stamp his feet
and she would give him whatever he asked for, which had made him
self-willed; also she had told him from morning to night that he would
one day be a king, and that kings were very happy, because everyone was
bound to obey and respect them, and no one could prevent them from doing
just as they liked.

When the Prince grew old enough to understand, he soon learned that
there could be nothing worse than to be proud, obstinate, and conceited,
and he had really tried to cure himself of these defects, but by that
time all his faults had become habits; and a bad habit is very hard to
get rid of. Not that he was naturally of a bad disposition; he was truly
sorry when he had been naughty, and said:

“I am very unhappy to have to struggle against my anger and pride every
day; if I had been punished for them when I was little they would not be
such a trouble to me now.”

His ring pricked him very often, and sometimes he left off what he was
doing at once; but at other times he would not attend to it. Strangely
enough, it gave him only a slight prick for a trifling fault, but when
he was really naughty it made his finger actually bleed. At last he got
tired of being constantly reminded, and wanted to be able to do as he
liked, so he threw his ring aside, and thought himself the happiest of
men to have got rid of its teasing pricks. He gave himself up to doing
every foolish thing that occurred to him, until he became quite wicked
and nobody could like him any longer.

One day, when the Prince was walking about, he saw a young girl who was
so very pretty that he made up his mind at once that he would marry her.
Her name was Celia, and she was as good as she was beautiful.

Prince Darling fancied that Celia would think herself only too happy if
he offered to make her a great queen, but she said fearlessly:

“Sire, I am only a shepherdess, and a poor girl, but, nevertheless, I
will not marry you.”

“Do you dislike me?” asked the Prince, who was very much vexed at this
answer.

“No, my Prince,” replied Celia; “I cannot help thinking you very
handsome; but what good would riches be to me, and all the grand dresses
and splendid carriages that you would give me, if the bad deeds which I
should see you do every day made me hate and despise you?”

The Prince was very angry at this speech, and commanded his officers to
make Celia a prisoner and carry her off to his palace. All day long the
remembrance of what she had said annoyed him, but as he loved her he
could not make up his mind to have her punished.

One of the Prince’s favorite companions was his foster-brother, whom
he trusted entirely; but he was not at all a good man, and gave Prince
Darling very bad advice, and encouraged him in all his evil ways. When
he saw the Prince so downcast he asked what was the matter, and when
he explained that he could not bear Celia’s bad opinion of him, and was
resolved to be a better man in order to please her, this evil adviser
said to him:

“You are very kind to trouble yourself about this little girl; if I were
you I would soon make her obey me. Remember that you are a king, and
that it would be laughable to see you trying to please a shepherdess,
who ought to be only too glad to be one of your slaves. Keep her in
prison, and feed her on bread and water for a little while, and then, if
she still says she will not marry you, have her head cut off, to teach
other people that you mean to be obeyed. Why, if you cannot make a girl
like that do as you wish, your subjects will soon forget that they are
only put into this world for our pleasure.”

“But,” said Prince Darling, “would it not be a shame if I had an
innocent girl put to death? For Celia has done nothing to deserve
punishment.”

“If people will not do as you tell them they ought to suffer for it,”
 answered his foster-brother; “but even if it were unjust, you had better
be accused of that by your subjects than that they should find out that
they may insult and thwart you as often as they please.”

In saying this he was touching a weak point in his brother’s character;
for the Prince’s fear of losing any of his power made him at once
abandon his first idea of trying to be good, and resolve to try and
frighten the shepherdess into consenting to marry him.

His foster-brother, who wanted him to keep this resolution, invited
three young courtiers, as wicked as himself to sup with the Prince,
and they persuaded him to drink a great deal of wine, and continued to
excite his anger against Celia by telling him that she had laughed at
his love for her; until at last, in quite a furious rage, he rushed off
to find her, declaring that if she still refused to marry him she should
be sold as a slave the very next day.

But when he reached the room in which Celia had been locked up, he was
greatly surprised to find that she was not in it, though he had the key
in his own pocket all the time. His anger was terrible, and he vowed
vengeance against whoever had helped her to escape. His bad friends,
when they heard him, resolved to turn his wrath upon an old nobleman who
had formerly been his tutor; and who still dared sometimes to tell the
Prince of his faults, for he loved him as if he had been his own son. At
first Prince Darling had thanked him, but after a time he grew impatient
and thought it must be just mere love of fault-finding that made his old
tutor blame him when everyone else was praising and flattering him. So
he ordered him to retire from his Court, though he still, from time
to time, spoke of him as a worthy man whom he respected, even if he no
longer loved him. His unworthy friends feared that he might some day
take it into his head to recall his old tutor, so they thought they now
had a good opportunity of getting him banished for ever.

They reported to the Prince that Suliman, for that was the tutor’s name,
had boasted of having helped Celia to escape, and they bribed three men
to say that Suliman himself had told them about it. The Prince, in great
anger, sent his foster-brother with a number of soldiers to bring his
tutor before him, in chains, like a criminal. After giving this order he
went to his own room, but he had scarcely got into it when there was
a clap of thunder which made the ground shake, and the Fairy Truth
appeared suddenly before him.

“I promised your father,” said she sternly, “to give you good advice,
and to punish you if you refused to follow it. You have despised my
counsel, and have gone your own evil way until you are only outwardly a
man; really you are a monster--the horror of everyone who knows you. It
is time that I should fulfil my promise, and begin your punishment. I
condemn you to resemble the animals whose ways you have imitated. You
have made yourself like the lion by your anger, and like the wolf by
your greediness. Like a snake, you have ungratefully turned upon one who
was a second father to you; your churlishness has made you like a bull.
Therefore, in your new form, take the appearance of all these animals.”

The Fairy had scarcely finished speaking when Prince Darling saw to his
horror that her words were fulfilled. He had a lion’s head, a bull’s
horns, a wolf’s feet, and a snake’s body. At the same instant he found
himself in a great forest, beside a clear lake, in which he could see
plainly the horrible creature he had become, and a voice said to him:

“Look carefully at the state to which your wickedness has brought you;
believe me, your soul is a thousand times more hideous than your body.”

Prince Darling recognized the voice of the Fairy Truth and turned in
a fury to catch her and eat her up if he possibly could; but he saw no
one, and the same voice went on:

“I laugh at your powerlessness and anger, and I intend to punish your
pride by letting you fall into the hands of your own subjects.”

The Prince began to think that the best thing he could do would be to
get as far away from the lake as he could, then at least he would not
be continually reminded of his terrible ugliness. So he ran toward the
wood, but before he had gone many yards he fell into a deep pit which
had been made to trap bears, and the hunters, who were hiding in a tree,
leaped down, and secured him with several chains, and led him into the
chief city of his own kingdom.

On the way, instead of recognizing that his own faults had brought this
punishment upon him, he accused the Fairy of being the cause of all his
misfortunes, and bit and tore at his chains furiously.

As they approached the town he saw that some great rejoicing was being
held, and when the hunters asked what had happened they were told that
the Prince, whose only pleasure it was to torment his people, had been
found in his room, killed by a thunder-bolt (for that was what was
supposed to have become of him). Four of his courtiers, those who had
encouraged him in his wicked doings, had tried to seize the kingdom
and divide it between them, but the people, who knew it was their bad
counsels which had so changed the Prince, had cut off their heads, and
had offered the crown to Suliman, whom the Prince had left in prison.
This noble lord had just been crowned, and the deliverance of the
kingdom was the cause of the rejoicing “For,” they said, “he is a good
and just man, and we shall once more enjoy peace and prosperity.”

Prince Darling roared with anger when he heard this; but it was still
worse for him when he reached the great square before his own palace. He
saw Suliman seated upon a magnificent throne, and all the people crowded
round, wishing him a long life that he might undo all the mischief done
by his predecessor.

Presently Suliman made a sign with his hand that the people should be
silent, and said: “I have accepted the crown you have offered me, but
only that I may keep it for Prince Darling, who is not dead as you
suppose; the Fairy has assured me that there is still hope that you may
some day see him again, good and virtuous as he was when he first came
to the throne. Alas!” he continued, “he was led away by flatterers.
I knew his heart, and am certain that if it had not been for the bad
influence of those who surrounded him he would have been a good king and
a father to his people. We may hate his faults, but let us pity him and
hope for his restoration. As for me, I would die gladly if that could
bring back our Prince to reign justly and worthily once more.”

These words went to Prince Darling’s heart; he realized the true
affection and faithfulness of his old tutor, and for the first time
reproached himself for all his evil deeds; at the same instant he felt
all his anger melting away, and he began quickly to think over his
past life, and to admit that his punishment was not more than he had
deserved. He left off tearing at the iron bars of the cage in which he
was shut up, and became as gentle as a lamb.

The hunters who had caught him took him to a great menagerie, where he
was chained up among all the other wild beasts, and he determined to
show his sorrow for his past bad behavior by being gentle and obedient
to the man who had to take care of him. Unfortunately, this man was very
rough and unkind, and though the poor monster was quite quiet, he often
beat him without rhyme or reason when he happened to be in a bad temper.
One day when this keeper was asleep a tiger broke its chain, and flew at
him to eat him up. Prince Darling, who saw what was going on, at
first felt quite pleased to think that he should be delivered from his
persecutor, but soon thought better of it and wished that he were free.

“I would return good for evil,” he said to himself, “and save the
unhappy man’s life.” He had hardly wished this when his iron cage flew
open, and he rushed to the side of the keeper, who was awake and was
defending himself against the tiger. When he saw the monster had got out
he gave himself up for lost, but his fear was soon changed into joy, for
the kind monster threw itself upon the tiger and very soon killed it,
and then came and crouched at the feet of the man it had saved.

Overcome with gratitude, the keeper stooped to caress the strange
creature which had done him such a great service; but suddenly a voice
said in his ear:

“A good action should never go unrewarded,” and at the same instant the
monster disappeared, and he saw at his feet only a pretty little dog!

Prince Darling, delighted by the change, frisked about the keeper,
showing his joy in every way he could, and the man, taking him up in his
arms, carried him to the King, to whom he told the whole story.

The Queen said she would like to have this wonderful little dog, and
the Prince would have been very happy in his new home if he could have
forgotten that he was a man and a king. The Queen petted and took
care of him, but she was so afraid that he would get too fat that she
consulted the court physician, who said that he was to be fed only upon
bread, and was not to have much even of that. So poor Prince Darling was
terribly hungry all day long, but he was very patient about it.

One day, when they gave him his little loaf for breakfast, he thought
he would like to eat it out in the garden; so he took it up in his mouth
and trotted away toward a brook that he knew of a long way from the
palace. But he was surprised to find that the brook was gone, and where
it had been stood a great house that seemed to be built of gold and
precious stones. Numbers of people splendidly dressed were going into
it, and sounds of music and dancing and feasting could be heard from the
windows.

But what seemed very strange was that those people who came out of the
house were pale and thin, and their clothes were torn, and hanging in
rags about them. Some fell down dead as they came out before they had
time to get away; others crawled farther with great difficulty; while
others again lay on the ground, fainting with hunger, and begged a
morsel of bread from those who were going into the house, but they would
not so much as look at the poor creatures.

Prince Darling went up to a young girl who was trying to eat a few
blades of grass, she was so hungry. Touched with compassion, he said to
himself:

“I am very hungry, but I shall not die of starvation before I get my
dinner; if I give my breakfast to this poor creature perhaps I may save
her life.”

So he laid his piece of bread in the girl’s hand, and saw her eat it up
eagerly.

She soon seemed to be quite well again, and the Prince, delighted to
have been able to help her, was thinking of going home to the palace,
when he heard a great outcry, and, turning round, saw Celia, who was
being carried against her will into the great house.

For the first time the Prince regretted that he was no longer the
monster, then he would have been able to rescue Celia; now he could only
bark feebly at the people who were carrying her off, and try to follow
them, but they chased and kicked him away.

He determined not to quit the place till he knew what had become of
Celia, and blamed himself for what had befallen her.

“Alas!” he said to himself, “I am furious with the people who are
carrying Celia off, but isn’t that exactly what I did myself, and if I
had not been prevented did I not intend to be still more cruel to her?”

Here he was interrupted by a noise above his head--someone was opening
a window, and he saw with delight that it was Celia herself, who came
forward and threw out a plate of most delicious-looking food, then the
window was shut again, and Prince Darling, who had not had anything to
eat all day, thought he might as well take the opportunity of getting
something. He ran forward to begin, but the young girl to whom he
had given his bread gave a cry of terror and took him up in her arms,
saying:

“Don’t touch it, my poor little dog--that house is the palace of
pleasure, and everything that comes out of it is poisoned!”

At the same moment a voice said:

“You see a good action always brings its reward,” and the Prince found
himself changed into a beautiful white dove. He remembered that white
was the favorite color of the Fairy Truth, and began to hope that he
might at last win back her favor. But just now his first care was for
Celia, and rising into the air he flew round and round the house, until
he saw an open window; but he searched through every room in vain. No
trace of Celia was to be seen, and the Prince, in despair, determined
to search through the world till he found her. He flew on and on for
several days, till he came to a great desert, where he saw a cavern,
and, to his delight, there sat Celia, sharing the simple breakfast of an
old hermit.

Overjoyed to have found her, Prince Darling perched upon her shoulder,
trying to express by his caresses how glad he was to see her again,
and Celia, surprised and delighted by the tameness of this pretty white
dove, stroked it softly, and said, though she never thought of its
understanding her:

“I accept the gift that you make me of yourself, and I will love you
always.”

“Take care what you are saying, Celia,” said the old hermit; “are you
prepared to keep that promise?”

“Indeed, I hope so, my sweet shepherdess,” cried the Prince, who was
at that moment restored to his natural shape. “You promised to love me
always; tell me that you really mean what you said, or I shall have to
ask the Fairy to give me back the form of the dove which pleased you so
much.”

“You need not be afraid that she will change her mind,” said the Fairy,
throwing off the hermit’s robe in which she had been disguised and
appearing before them.

“Celia has loved you ever since she first saw you, only she would not
tell you while you were so obstinate and naughty. Now you have repented
and mean to be good you deserve to be happy, and so she may love you as
much as she likes.”

Celia and Prince Darling threw themselves at the Fairy’s feet, and
the Prince was never tired of thanking her for her kindness. Celia
was delighted to hear how sorry he was for all his past follies and
misdeeds, and promised to love him as long as she lived.

“Rise, my children,” said the Fairy, “and I will transport you to the
palace, and Prince Darling shall have back again the crown he forfeited
by his bad behavior.”

While she was speaking, they found themselves in Suliman’s hall, and his
delight was great at seeing his dear master once more. He gave up the
throne joyfully to the Prince, and remained always the most faithful of
his subjects.

Celia and Prince Darling reigned for many years, but he was so
determined to govern worthily and to do his duty that his ring, which he
took to wearing again, never once pricked him severely.


There was a man who had fine houses, both in town and country, a deal
of silver and gold plate, embroidered furniture, and coaches gilded all
over with gold. But this man was so unlucky as to have a blue beard,
which made him so frightfully ugly that all the women and girls ran away
from him.

One of his neighbors, a lady of quality, had two daughters who were
perfect beauties. He desired of her one of them in marriage, leaving to
her choice which of the two she would bestow on him. They would neither
of them have him, and sent him backward and forward from one another,
not being able to bear the thoughts of marrying a man who had a blue
beard, and what besides gave them disgust and aversion was his having
already been married to several wives, and nobody ever knew what became
of them.

Blue Beard, to engage their affection, took them, with the lady their
mother and three or four ladies of their acquaintance, with other young
people of the neighborhood, to one of his country seats, where they
stayed a whole week.

There was nothing then to be seen but parties of pleasure, hunting,
fishing, dancing, mirth, and feasting. Nobody went to bed, but all
passed the night in rallying and joking with each other. In short,
everything succeeded so well that the youngest daughter began to think
the master of the house not to have a beard so very blue, and that he
was a mighty civil gentleman.

As soon as they returned home, the marriage was concluded. About a
month afterward, Blue Beard told his wife that he was obliged to take
a country journey for six weeks at least, about affairs of very great
consequence, desiring her to divert herself in his absence, to send for
her friends and acquaintances, to carry them into the country, if she
pleased, and to make good cheer wherever she was.

“Here,” said he, “are the keys of the two great wardrobes, wherein I
have my best furniture; these are of my silver and gold plate, which is
not every day in use; these open my strong boxes, which hold my money,
both gold and silver; these my caskets of jewels; and this is the
master-key to all my apartments. But for this little one here, it is the
key of the closet at the end of the great gallery on the ground floor.
Open them all; go into all and every one of them, except that little
closet, which I forbid you, and forbid it in such a manner that, if you
happen to open it, there’s nothing but what you may expect from my just
anger and resentment.”

She promised to observe, very exactly, whatever he had ordered; when
he, after having embraced her, got into his coach and proceeded on his
journey.

Her neighbors and good friends did not stay to be sent for by the
new married lady, so great was their impatience to see all the rich
furniture of her house, not daring to come while her husband was there,
because of his blue beard, which frightened them. They ran through all
the rooms, closets, and wardrobes, which were all so fine and rich that
they seemed to surpass one another.

After that they went up into the two great rooms, where was the best
and richest furniture; they could not sufficiently admire the number
and beauty of the tapestry, beds, couches, cabinets, stands, tables, and
looking-glasses, in which you might see yourself from head to foot; some
of them were framed with glass, others with silver, plain and gilded,
the finest and most magnificent ever were seen.

They ceased not to extol and envy the happiness of their friend, who in
the meantime in no way diverted herself in looking upon all these rich
things, because of the impatience she had to go and open the closet on
the ground floor. She was so much pressed by her curiosity that, without
considering that it was very uncivil to leave her company, she went
down a little back staircase, and with such excessive haste that she had
twice or thrice like to have broken her neck.

Coming to the closet-door, she made a stop for some time, thinking upon
her husband’s orders, and considering what unhappiness might attend her
if she was disobedient; but the temptation was so strong she could not
overcome it. She then took the little key, and opened it, trembling, but
could not at first see anything plainly, because the windows were shut.
After some moments she began to perceive that the floor was all covered
over with clotted blood, on which lay the bodies of several dead women,
ranged against the walls. (These were all the wives whom Blue Beard had
married and murdered, one after another.) She thought she should have
died for fear, and the key, which she pulled out of the lock, fell out
of her hand.

After having somewhat recovered her surprise, she took up the key,
locked the door, and went upstairs into her chamber to recover herself;
but she could not, she was so much frightened. Having observed that the
key of the closet was stained with blood, she tried two or three times
to wipe it off, but the blood would not come out; in vain did she wash
it, and even rub it with soap and sand; the blood still remained, for
the key was magical and she could never make it quite clean; when the
blood was gone off from one side, it came again on the other.

Blue Beard returned from his journey the same evening, and said he had
received letters upon the road, informing him that the affair he went
about was ended to his advantage. His wife did all she could to convince
him she was extremely glad of his speedy return.

Next morning he asked her for the keys, which she gave him, but with
such a trembling hand that he easily guessed what had happened.

“What!” said he, “is not the key of my closet among the rest?”

“I must certainly have left it above upon the table,” said she.

“Fail not to bring it to me presently,” said Blue Beard.

After several goings backward and forward she was forced to bring him
the key. Blue Beard, having very attentively considered it, said to his
wife,

“How comes this blood upon the key?”

“I do not know,” cried the poor woman, paler than death.

“You do not know!” replied Blue Beard. “I very well know. You were
resolved to go into the closet, were you not? Mighty well, madam; you
shall go in, and take your place among the ladies you saw there.”

Upon this she threw herself at her husband’s feet, and begged his pardon
with all the signs of true repentance, vowing that she would never more
be disobedient. She would have melted a rock, so beautiful and sorrowful
was she; but Blue Beard had a heart harder than any rock!

“You must die, madam,” said he, “and that presently.”

“Since I must die,” answered she (looking upon him with her eyes all
bathed in tears), “give me some little time to say my prayers.”

“I give you,” replied Blue Beard, “half a quarter of an hour, but not
one moment more.”

When she was alone she called out to her sister, and said to her:

“Sister Anne” (for that was her name), “go up, I beg you, upon the top
of the tower, and look if my brothers are not coming over; they promised
me that they would come to-day, and if you see them, give them a sign to
make haste.”

Her sister Anne went up upon the top of the tower, and the poor
afflicted wife cried out from time to time:

“Anne, sister Anne, do you see anyone coming?”

And sister Anne said:

“I see nothing but the sun, which makes a dust, and the grass, which
looks green.”

In the meanwhile Blue Beard, holding a great sabre in his hand, cried
out as loud as he could bawl to his wife:

“Come down instantly, or I shall come up to you.”

“One moment longer, if you please,” said his wife, and then she cried
out very softly, “Anne, sister Anne, dost thou see anybody coming?”

And sister Anne answered:

“I see nothing but the sun, which makes a dust, and the grass, which is
green.”

“Come down quickly,” cried Blue Beard, “or I will come up to you.”

“I am coming,” answered his wife; and then she cried, “Anne, sister
Anne, dost thou not see anyone coming?”

“I see,” replied sister Anne, “a great dust, which comes on this side
here.”

“Are they my brothers?”

“Alas! no, my dear sister, I see a flock of sheep.”

“Will you not come down?” cried Blue Beard

“One moment longer,” said his wife, and then she cried out: “Anne,
sister Anne, dost thou see nobody coming?”

“I see,” said she, “two horsemen, but they are yet a great way off.”

“God be praised,” replied the poor wife joyfully; “they are my brothers;
I will make them a sign, as well as I can, for them to make haste.”

Then Blue Beard bawled out so loud that he made the whole house tremble.
The distressed wife came down, and threw herself at his feet, all in
tears, with her hair about her shoulders.

“This signifies nothing,” says Blue Beard; “you must die”; then, taking
hold of her hair with one hand, and lifting up the sword with the other,
he was going to take off her head. The poor lady, turning about to him,
and looking at him with dying eyes, desired him to afford her one little
moment to recollect herself.

“No, no,” said he, “recommend thyself to God,” and was just ready to
strike...

At this very instant there was such a loud knocking at the gate that
Blue Beard made a sudden stop. The gate was opened, and presently
entered two horsemen, who, drawing their swords, ran directly to Blue
Beard. He knew them to be his wife’s brothers, one a dragoon, the other
a musketeer, so that he ran away immediately to save himself; but the
two brothers pursued so close that they overtook him before he could get
to the steps of the porch, when they ran their swords through his body
and left him dead. The poor wife was almost as dead as her husband, and
had not strength enough to rise and welcome her brothers.

Blue Beard had no heirs, and so his wife became mistress of all his
estate. She made use of one part of it to marry her sister Anne to a
young gentleman who had loved her a long while; another part to buy
captains commissions for her brothers, and the rest to marry herself to
a very worthy gentleman, who made her forget the ill time she had passed
with Blue Beard.


Once upon a time there was an old king who was so ill that he thought to
himself, “I am most likely on my death-bed.” Then he said, “Send Trusty
John to me.” Now Trusty John was his favorite servant, and was so called
because all his life he had served him so faithfully. When he approached
the bed the King spake to him: “Most trusty John, I feel my end is
drawing near, and I could face it without a care were it not for my son.
He is still too young to decide everything for himself, and unless you
promise me to instruct him in all he should know, and to be to him as a
father, I shall not close my eyes in peace.” Then Trusty John answered:
“I will never desert him, and will serve him faithfully, even though it
should cost me my life.” Then the old King said: “Now I die comforted
and in peace”; and then he went on: “After my death you must show him
the whole castle, all the rooms and apartments and vaults, and all the
treasures that lie in them; but you must not show him the last room in
the long passage, where the picture of the Princess of the Golden Roof
is hidden. When he beholds that picture he will fall violently in love
with it and go off into a dead faint, and for her sake he will encounter
many dangers; you must guard him from this.” And when Trusty John had
again given the King his hand upon it the old man became silent, laid
his head on the pillow, and died.

When the old King had been carried to his grave Trusty John told the
young King what he had promised his father on his death-bed, and added:
“And I shall assuredly keep my word, and shall be faithful to you as I
have been to him, even though it should cost me my life.”

Now when the time of mourning was over, Trusty John said to him: “It
is time you should see your inheritance. I will show you your ancestral
castle.” So he took him over everything, and let him see all the riches
and splendid apartments, only the one room where the picture was he
did not open. But the picture was placed so that if the door opened
you gazed straight upon it, and it was so beautifully painted that
you imagined it lived and moved, and that it was the most lovable and
beautiful thing in the whole world. But the young King noticed that
Trusty John always missed one door, and said: “Why do you never open
this one for me?” “There is something inside that would appall you,” he
answered. But the King replied: “I have seen the whole castle, and shall
find out what is in there”; and with these words he approached the door
and wanted to force it open. But Trusty John held him back, and said: “I
promised your father before his death that you shouldn’t see what that
room contains. It might bring both you and me to great grief.” “Ah!
no,” answered the young King; “if I don’t get in, it will be my certain
destruction; I should have no peace night or day till I had seen what
was in the room with my own eyes. Now I don’t budge from the spot till
you have opened the door.”

Then Trusty John saw there was no way out of it, so with a heavy heart
and many sighs he took the key from the big bunch. When he had opened
the door he stepped in first, and thought to cover the likeness so that
the King might not perceive it; but it was hopeless: the King stood on
tiptoe and looked over his shoulder. And when he saw the picture of the
maid, so beautiful and glittering with gold and precious stones, he fell
swooning to the ground. Trusty John lifted him up, carried him to bed,
and thought sorrowfully: “The curse has come upon us; gracious heaven!
what will be the end of it all?” Then he poured wine down his throat
till he came to himself again. The first words he spoke were: “Oh! who
is the original of the beautiful picture?” “She is the Princess of the
Golden Roof,” answered Trusty John. Then the King continued: “My love
for her is so great that if all the leaves on the trees had tongues they
could not express it; my very life depends on my winning her. You are my
most trusty John: you must stand by me.”

The faithful servant pondered long how they were to set about the
matter, for it was said to be difficult even to get into the presence of
the Princess. At length he hit upon a plan, and spoke to the King: “All
the things she has about her--tables, chairs, dishes, goblets, bowls,
and all her household furniture--are made of gold. You have in
your treasure five tons of gold; let the goldsmiths of your kingdom
manufacture them into all manner of vases and vessels, into all sorts of
birds and game and wonderful beasts; that will please her. We shall
go to her with them and try our luck.” The King summoned all his
goldsmiths, and they had to work hard day and night, till at length the
most magnificent things were completed. When a ship had been laden with
them the faithful John disguised himself as a merchant, and the King had
to do the same, so that they should be quite unrecognizable. And so
they crossed the seas and journeyed till they reached the town where the
Princess of the Golden Roof dwelt.

Trusty John made the King remain behind on the ship and await his
return. “Perhaps,” he said, “I may bring the Princess back with me, so
see that everything is in order; let the gold ornaments be arranged and
the whole ship decorated.” Then he took a few of the gold things in his
apron, went ashore, and proceeded straight to the palace. When he came
to the courtyard he found a beautiful maiden standing at the well,
drawing water with two golden pails. And as she was about to carry away
the glittering water she turned round and saw the stranger, and asked
him who he was. Then he replied: “I am a merchant,” and opening his
apron, he let her peep in. “Oh! my,” she cried; “what beautiful gold
wares!” she set down her pails, and examined one thing after the other.
Then she said: “The Princess must see this, she has such a fancy for
gold things that she will buy up all you have.” She took him by the hand
and let him into the palace, for she was the lady’s maid.

When the Princess had seen the wares she was quite enchanted, and said:
“They are all so beautifully made that I shall buy everything you have.”
 But Trusty John said: “I am only the servant of a rich merchant, what
I have here is nothing compared to what my master has on his ship; his
merchandise is more artistic and costly than anything that has ever been
made in gold before.” She desired to have everything brought up to her,
but he said: “There is such a quantity of things that it would take many
days to bring them up, and they would take up so many rooms that
you would have no space for them in your house.” Thus her desire and
curiosity were excited to such an extent that at last she said: “Take me
to your ship; I shall go there myself and view your master’s treasures.”

Then Trusty John was quite delighted, and brought her to the ship; and
the King, when he beheld her, saw that she was even more beautiful than
her picture, and thought every moment that his heart would burst. She
stepped on to the ship, and the King led her inside. But Trusty John
remained behind with the steersman, and ordered the ship to push off.
“Spread all sail, that we may fly on the ocean like a bird in the air.”
 Meanwhile the King showed the Princess inside all his gold wares, every
single bit of it--dishes, goblets, bowls, the birds and game, and all
the wonderful beasts. Many hours passed thus, and she was so happy that
she did not notice that the ship was sailing away. After she had seen
the last thing she thanked the merchant and prepared to go home; but
when she came to the ship’s side she saw that they were on the high
seas, far from land, and that the ship was speeding on its way under
full canvas. “Oh!” she cried in terror, “I am deceived, carried away and
betrayed into the power of a merchant; I would rather have died!” But
the King seized her hand and spake: “I am no merchant, but a king of as
high birth as yourself; and it was my great love for you that made me
carry you off by stratagem. The first time I saw your likeness I fell to
the ground in a swoon.” When the Princess of the Golden Roof heard this
she was comforted, and her heart went out to him, so that she willingly
consented to become his wife.

Now it happened one day, while they were sailing on the high seas,
that Trusty John, sitting on the forepart of the ship, fiddling away to
himself, observed three ravens in the air flying toward him. He ceased
playing, and listened to what they were saying, for he understood their
language. The one croaked: “Ah, ha! so he’s bringing the Princess of
the Golden Roof home.” “Yes,” answered the second, “but he’s not got her
yet.” “Yes, he has,” spake the third, “for she’s sitting beside him on
the ship.” Then number one began again and cried: “That’ll not help him!
When they reach the land a chestnut horse will dash forward to greet
them: the King will wish to mount it, and if he does it will gallop away
with him, and disappear into the air, and he will never see his bride
again.” “Is there no escape for him?” asked number two. “Oh! yes, if
someone else mounts quickly and shoots the horse dead with the pistol
that is sticking in the holster, then the young King is saved. But who’s
to do that? And anyone who knows it and tells him will be turned into
stone from his feet to his knees.” Then spake number two: “I know more
than that: even if the horse is slain, the young King will still not
keep his bride: when they enter the palace together they will find a
ready-made wedding shirt in a cupboard, which looks as though it were
woven of gold and silver, but is really made of nothing but sulphur and
tar: when the King puts it on it will burn him to his marrow and bones.”
 Number three asked: “Is there no way of escape, then?” “Oh! yes,”
 answered number two: “If someone seizes the shirt with gloved hands and
throws it into the fire, and lets it burn, then the young King is saved.
But what’s the good? Anyone knowing this and telling it will have half
his body turned into stone, from his knees to his heart.” Then number
three spake: “I know yet more: though the bridal shirt too be burnt, the
King hasn’t even then secured his bride: when the dance is held after
the wedding, and the young Queen is dancing, she will suddenly grow
deadly white, and drop down like one dead, and unless some one lifts her
up and draws three drops of blood from her right side, and spits them
out again, she will die. But if anyone who knows this betrays it, he
will be turned into stone from the crown of his head to the soles of his
feet.” When the ravens had thus conversed they fled onward, but Trusty
John had taken it all in, and was sad and depressed from that time
forward; for if he were silent to his master concerning what he had
heard, he would involve him in misfortune; but if he took him into his
confidence, then he himself would forfeit his life. At last he said: “I
will stand by my master, though it should be my ruin.”

Now when they drew near the land it came to pass just as the ravens had
predicted, and a splendid chestnut horse bounded forward. “Capital!”
 said the King; “this animal shall carry me to my palace,” and was about
to mount, but Trusty John was too sharp for him, and, springing up
quickly, seized the pistol out of the holster and shot the horse dead.
Then the other servants of the King, who at no time looked favorably on
Trusty John, cried out: “What a sin to kill the beautiful beast that was
to bear the King to his palace!” But the King spake: “Silence! let him
alone; he is ever my most trusty John. Who knows for what good end he
may have done this thing?” So they went on their way and entered
the palace, and there in the hall stood a cupboard in which lay the
ready-made bridal shirt, looking for all the world as though it were
made of gold and silver. The young King went toward it and was about to
take hold of it, but Trusty John, pushing him aside, seized it with his
gloved hands, threw it hastily into the fire, and let it burn The
other servants commenced grumbling again, and said: “See, he’s actually
burning the King’s bridal shirt.” But the young King spoke: “Who knows
for what good purpose he does it? Let him alone, he is my most trusty
John.” Then the wedding was celebrated, the dance began, and the bride
joined in, but Trusty John watched her countenance carefully. Of a
sudden she grew deadly white, and fell to the ground as if she were
dead. He at once sprang hastily toward her, lifted her up, and bore her
to a room, where he laid her down, and kneeling beside her he drew three
drops of blood from her right side, and spat them out. She soon
breathed again and came to herself; but the young King had watched the
proceeding, and not knowing why Trusty John had acted as he did, he flew
into a passion, and cried: “Throw him into prison.” On the following
morning sentence was passed on Trusty John, and he was condemned to be
hanged. As he stood on the gallows he said: “Every one doomed to
death has the right to speak once before he dies; and I too have that
privilege?” “Yes,” said the King, “it shall be granted to you.” So
Trusty John spoke: “I am unjustly condemned, for I have always been
faithful to you”; and he proceeded to relate how he had heard the
ravens’ conversation on the sea, and how he had to do all he did in
order to save his master. Then the King cried: “Oh! my most trusty John,
pardon! pardon! Take him down.” But as he uttered the last word Trusty
John had fallen lifeless to the ground, and was a stone.

The King and Queen were in despair, and the King spake: “Ah! how ill
have I rewarded such great fidelity!” and made them lift up the stone
image and place it in his bedroom near his bed. As often as he looked at
it he wept and said: “Oh! if I could only restore you to life, my most
trusty John!” After a time the Queen gave birth to twins, two small
sons, who throve and grew, and were a constant joy to her. One day when
the Queen was at church, and the two children sat and played with their
father, he gazed again full of grief on the stone statue, and sighing,
wailed: “Oh, if I could only restore you to life, my most trusty John!”
 Suddenly the stone began to speak, and said: “Yes, you can restore me
to life again if you are prepared to sacrifice what you hold most dear.”
 And the King cried out: “All I have in the world will I give up for your
sake.” The stone continued: “If you cut off with your own hand the heads
of your two children, and smear me with their blood, I shall come back
to life.” The King was aghast when he heard that he had himself to put
his children to death; but when he thought of Trusty John’s fidelity,
and how he had even died for him, he drew his sword, and with his own
hand cut the heads off his children. And when he had smeared the stone
with their blood, life came back, and Trusty John stood once more safe
and sound before him. He spake to the King: “Your loyalty shall be
rewarded,” and taking up the heads of the children, he placed them on
their bodies, smeared the wounds with their blood, and in a minute they
were all right again and jumping about as if nothing had happened.
Then the King was full of joy, and when he saw the Queen coming, he hid
Trusty John and the two children in a big cupboard. As she entered he
said to her: “Did you pray in church?” “Yes,” she answered, “but my
thoughts dwelt constantly on Trusty John, and of what he has suffered
for us.” Then he spake: “Dear wife, we can restore him to life, but the
price asked is our two little sons; we must sacrifice them.” The Queen
grew white and her heart sank, but she replied: “We owe it to him on
account of his great fidelity.” Then he rejoiced that she was of the
same mind as he had been, and going forward he opened the cupboard, and
fetched the two children and Trusty John out, saying: “God be praised!
Trusty John is free once more, and we have our two small sons again.”
 Then he related to her all that had passed, and they lived together
happily ever afterward.



One summer’s day a little tailor sat on his table by the window in
the best of spirits, and sewed for dear life. As he was sitting thus a
peasant woman came down the street, calling out: “Good jam to sell,
good jam to sell.” This sounded sweetly in the tailor’s ears; he put
his frail little head out of the window, and shouted: “up here, my good
woman, and you’ll find a willing customer.” The woman climbed up the
three flights of stairs with her heavy basket to the tailor’s room, and
he made her spread out all the pots in a row before him. He examined
them all, lifted them up and smelled them, and said at last: “This jam
seems good, weigh me four ounces of it, my good woman; and even if it’s
a quarter of a pound I won’t stick at it.” The woman, who had hoped to
find a good market, gave him what he wanted, but went away grumbling
wrathfully. “Now heaven shall bless this jam for my use,” cried the
little tailor, “and it shall sustain and strengthen me.” He fetched some
bread out of a cupboard, cut a round off the loaf, and spread the jam on
it. “That won’t taste amiss,” he said; “but I’ll finish that waistcoat
first before I take a bite.” He placed the bread beside him, went
on sewing, and out of the lightness of his heart kept on making his
stitches bigger and bigger. In the meantime the smell of the sweet jam
rose to the ceiling, where heaps of flies were sitting, and attracted
them to such an extent that they swarmed on to it in masses. “Ha! who
invited you?” said the tailor, and chased the unwelcome guests away. But
the flies, who didn’t understand English, refused to let themselves
be warned off, and returned again in even greater numbers. At last the
little tailor, losing all patience, reached out of his chimney corner
for a duster, and exclaiming: “Wait, and I’ll give it to you,” he beat
them mercilessly with it. When he left off he counted the slain, and
no fewer than seven lay dead before him with outstretched legs. “What a
desperate fellow I am!” said he, and was filled with admiration at his
own courage. “The whole town must know about this”; and in great haste
the little tailor cut out a girdle, hemmed it, and embroidered on it in
big letters, “Seven at a blow.” “What did I say, the town? no, the whole
world shall hear of it,” he said; and his heart beat for joy as a lamb
wags his tail.

The tailor strapped the girdle round his waist and set out into the wide
world, for he considered his workroom too small a field for his prowess.
Before he set forth he looked round about him, to see if there was
anything in the house he could take with him on his journey; but he
found nothing except an old cheese, which he took possession of. In
front of the house he observed a bird that had been caught in some
bushes, and this he put into his wallet beside the cheese. Then he went
on his way merrily, and being light and agile he never felt tired. His
way led up a hill, on the top of which sat a powerful giant, who was
calmly surveying the landscape. The little tailor went up to him, and
greeting him cheerfully said: “Good-day, friend; there you sit at your
ease viewing the whole wide world. I’m just on my way there. What do you
say to accompanying me?” The giant looked contemptuously at the tailor,
and said: “What a poor wretched little creature you are!” “That’s a good
joke,” answered the little tailor, and unbuttoning his coat he showed
the giant the girdle. “There now, you can read what sort of a fellow
I am.” The giant read: “Seven at a blow”; and thinking they were human
beings the tailor had slain, he conceived a certain respect for the
little man. But first he thought he’d test him, so taking up a stone in
his hand, he squeezed it till some drops of water ran out. “Now you do
the same,” said the giant, “if you really wish to be thought strong.”
 “Is that all?” said the little tailor; “that’s child’s play to me,” so
he dived into his wallet, brought out the cheese, and pressed it till
the whey ran out. “My squeeze was in sooth better than yours,” said he.
The giant didn’t know what to say, for he couldn’t have believed it
of the little fellow. To prove him again, the giant lifted a stone and
threw it so high that the eye could hardly follow it. “Now, my little
pigmy, let me see you do that.” “Well thrown,” said the tailor; “but,
after all, your stone fell to the ground; I’ll throw one that won’t come
down at all.” He dived into his wallet again, and grasping the bird in
his hand, he threw it up into the air. The bird, enchanted to be free,
soared up into the sky, and flew away never to return. “Well, what do
you think of that little piece of business, friend?” asked the tailor.
“You can certainly throw,” said the giant; “but now let’s see if you can
carry a proper weight.” With these words he led the tailor to a huge oak
tree which had been felled to the ground, and said: “If you are strong
enough, help me to carry the tree out of the wood.” “Most certainly,”
 said the little tailor: “just you take the trunk on your shoulder; I’ll
bear the top and branches, which is certainly the heaviest part.” The
giant laid the trunk on his shoulder, but the tailor sat at his ease
among the branches; and the giant, who couldn’t see what was going on
behind him, had to carry the whole tree, and the little tailor into the
bargain. There he sat behind in the best of spirits, lustily whistling a
tune, as if carrying the tree were mere sport. The giant, after dragging
the heavy weight for some time, could get on no further, and shouted
out: “Hi! I must let the tree fall.” The tailor sprang nimbly down,
seized the tree with both hands as if he had carried it the whole way
and said to the giant: “Fancy a big lout like you not being able to
carry a tree!”

They continued to go on their way together, and as they passed by a
cherry tree the giant grasped the top of it, where the ripest fruit
hung, gave the branches into the tailor’s hand, and bade him eat. But
the little tailor was far too weak to hold the tree down, and when the
giant let go the tree swung back into the air, bearing the little tailor
with it. When he had fallen to the ground again without hurting himself,
the giant said: “What! do you mean to tell me you haven’t the strength
to hold down a feeble twig?” “It wasn’t strength that was wanting,”
 replied the tailor; “do you think that would have been anything for a
man who has killed seven at a blow? I jumped over the tree because the
huntsmen are shooting among the branches near us. Do you do the like if
you dare.” The giant made an attempt, but couldn’t get over the tree,
and stuck fast in the branches, so that here too the little tailor had
the better of him.

“Well, you’re a fine fellow, after all,” said the giant; “come and spend
the night with us in our cave.” The little tailor willingly consented to
do this, and following his friend they went on till they reached a cave
where several other giants were sitting round a fire, each holding
a roast sheep in his hand, of which he was eating. The little tailor
looked about him, and thought: “Yes, there’s certainly more room to turn
round in here than in my workshop.” The giant showed him a bed and bade
him lie down and have a good sleep. But the bed was too big for the
little tailor, so he didn’t get into it, but crept away into the corner.
At midnight, when the giant thought the little tailor was fast asleep,
he rose up, and taking his big iron walking-stick, he broke the bed
in two with a blow, and thought he had made an end of the little
grasshopper. At early dawn the giants went off to the wood, and quite
forgot about the little tailor, till all of a sudden they met him
trudging along in the most cheerful manner. The giants were terrified at
the apparition, and, fearful lest he should slay them, they all took to
their heels as fast as they could.

The little tailor continued to follow his nose, and after he had
wandered about for a long time he came to the courtyard of a royal
palace, and feeling tired he lay down on the grass and fell asleep.
While he lay there the people came, and looking him all over read on his
girdle: “Seven at a blow.” “Oh!” they said, “what can this great hero of
a hundred fights want in our peaceful land? He must indeed be a mighty
man of valor.” They went and told the King about him, and said what a
weighty and useful man he’d be in time of war, and that it would be well
to secure him at any price. This counsel pleased the King, and he sent
one of his courtiers down to the little tailor, to offer him, when he
awoke, a commission in their army. The messenger remained standing by
the sleeper, and waited till he stretched his limbs and opened his eyes,
when he tendered his proposal. “That’s the very thing I came here for,”
 he answered; “I am quite ready to enter the King’s service.” So he was
received with all honor, and given a special house of his own to live
in.

But the other officers resented the success of the little tailor, and
wished him a thousand miles away. “What’s to come of it all?” they asked
each other; “if we quarrel with him, he’ll let out at us, and at every
blow seven will fall. There’ll soon be an end of us.” So they resolved
to go in a body to the King, and all to send in their papers. “We are
not made,” they said, “to hold out against a man who kills seven at a
blow.” The King was grieved at the thought of losing all his faithful
servants for the sake of one man, and he wished heartily that he had
never set eyes on him, or that he could get rid of him. But he didn’t
dare to send him away, for he feared he might kill him along with his
people, and place himself on the throne. He pondered long and deeply
over the matter, and finally came to a conclusion. He sent to the tailor
and told him that, seeing what a great and warlike hero he was, he
was about to make him an offer. In a certain wood of his kingdom there
dwelled two giants who did much harm; by the way they robbed, murdered,
burned, and plundered everything about them; “no one could approach them
without endangering his life. But if he could overcome and kill these
two giants he should have his only daughter for a wife, and half his
kingdom into the bargain; he might have a hundred horsemen, too, to back
him up.” “That’s the very thing for a man like me,” thought the little
tailor; “one doesn’t get the offer of a beautiful princess and half a
kingdom every day.” “Done with you,” he answered; “I’ll soon put an end
to the giants. But I haven’t the smallest need of your hundred horsemen;
a fellow who can slay seven men at a blow need not be afraid of two.”

The little tailor set out, and the hundred horsemen followed him. When
he came to the outskirts of the wood he said to his followers: “You wait
here, I’ll manage the giants by myself”; and he went on into the wood,
casting his sharp little eyes right and left about him. After a while
he spied the two giants lying asleep under a tree, and snoring till
the very boughs bent with the breeze. The little tailor lost no time in
filling his wallet with stones, and then climbed up the tree under
which they lay. When he got to about the middle of it he slipped along a
branch till he sat just above the sleepers, when he threw down one stone
after the other on the nearest giant. The giant felt nothing for a long
time, but at last he woke up, and pinching his companion said: “What did
you strike me for?” “I didn’t strike you,” said the other, “you must be
dreaming.” They both lay down to sleep again, and the tailor threw down
a stone on the second giant, who sprang up and cried: “What’s that for?
Why did you throw something at me?” “I didn’t throw anything,” growled
the first one. They wrangled on for a time, till, as both were tired,
they made up the matter and fell asleep again. The little tailor began
his game once more, and flung the largest stone he could find in his
wallet with all his force, and hit the first giant on the chest. “This
is too much of a good thing!” he yelled, and springing up like a madman,
he knocked his companion against the tree till he trembled. He gave,
however, as good as he got, and they became so enraged that they tore up
trees and beat each other with them, till they both fell dead at once on
the ground. Then the little tailor jumped down. “It’s a mercy,” he said,
“that they didn’t root up the tree on which I was perched, or I should
have had to jump like a squirrel on to another, which, nimble though I
am, would have been no easy job.” He drew his sword and gave each of
the giants a very fine thrust or two on the breast, and then went to
the horsemen and said: “The deed is done, I’ve put an end to the two of
them; but I assure you it has been no easy matter, for they even tore up
trees in their struggle to defend themselves; but all that’s of no use
against one who slays seven men at a blow.” “Weren’t you wounded?” asked
the horsemen.

“No fear,” answered the tailor; “they haven’t touched a hair of my
head.” But the horsemen wouldn’t believe him till they rode into the
wood and found the giants weltering in their blood, and the trees lying
around, torn up by the roots.

The little tailor now demanded the promised reward from the King, but he
repented his promise, and pondered once more how he could rid himself
of the hero. “Before you obtain the hand of my daughter and half my
kingdom,” he said to him, “you must do another deed of valor. A unicorn
is running about loose in the wood, and doing much mischief; you must
first catch it.” “I’m even less afraid of one unicorn than of two
giants; seven at a blow, that’s my motto.” He took a piece of cord and
an axe with him, went out to the wood, and again told the men who had
been sent with him to remain outside. He hadn’t to search long, for the
unicorn soon passed by, and, on perceiving the tailor, dashed straight
at him as though it were going to spike him on the spot. “Gently,
gently,” said he, “not so fast, my friend”; and standing still he waited
till the beast was quite near, when he sprang lightly behind a tree; the
unicorn ran with all its force against the tree, and rammed its horn so
firmly into the trunk that it had no strength left to pull it out again,
and was thus successfully captured. “Now I’ve caught my bird,” said the
tailor, and he came out from behind the tree, placed the cord round its
neck first, then struck the horn out of the tree with his axe, and when
everything was in order led the beast before the King.

Still the King didn’t want to give him the promised reward and made a
third demand. The tailor was to catch a wild boar for him that did a
great deal of harm in the wood; and he might have the huntsmen to help
him. “Willingly,” said the tailor; “that’s mere child’s play.” But he
didn’t take the huntsmen into the wood with him, and they were well
enough pleased to remain behind, for the wild boar had often
received them in a manner which did not make them desire its further
acquaintance. As soon as the boar perceived the tailor it ran at him
with foaming mouth and gleaming teeth, and tried to knock him down; but
our alert little friend ran into a chapel that stood near, and got out
of the window again with a jump. The boar pursued him into the church,
but the tailor skipped round to the door, and closed it securely. So the
raging beast was caught, for it was far too heavy and unwieldy to spring
out of the window. The little tailor summoned the huntsmen together,
that they might see the prisoner with their own eyes. Then the hero
betook himself to the King, who was obliged now, whether he liked it or
not, to keep his promise, and hand him over his daughter and half his
kingdom. Had he known that no hero-warrior, but only a little tailor
stood before him, it would have gone even more to his heart. So the
wedding was celebrated with much splendor and little joy, and the tailor
became a king.

After a time the Queen heard her husband saying one night in his sleep:
“My lad, make that waistcoat and patch these trousers, or I’ll box your
ears.” Thus she learned in what rank the young gentleman had been born,
and next day she poured forth her woes to her father, and begged him to
help her to get rid of a husband who was nothing more nor less than a
tailor. The King comforted her, and said: “Leave your bedroom door open
to-night, my servants shall stand outside, and when your husband is
fast asleep they shall enter, bind him fast, and carry him on to a
ship, which shall sail away out into the wide ocean.” The Queen was
well satisfied with the idea, but the armor-bearer, who had overheard
everything, being much attached to his young master, went straight to
him and revealed the whole plot. “I’ll soon put a stop to the business,”
 said the tailor. That night he and his wife went to bed at the usual
time; and when she thought he had fallen asleep she got up, opened the
door, and then lay down again. The little tailor, who had only pretended
to be asleep, began to call out in a clear voice: “My lad, make that
waistcoat and patch those trousers, or I’ll box your ears. I have killed
seven at a blow, slain two giants, led a unicorn captive, and caught a
wild boar, then why should I be afraid of those men standing outside my
door?” The men, when they heard the tailor saying these words, were so
terrified that they fled as if pursued by a wild army, and didn’t dare
go near him again. So the little tailor was and remained a king all the
days of his life.



My father had a small estate in Nottinghamshire, and I was the third
of four sons. He sent me to Cambridge at fourteen years old, and after
studying there three years I was bound apprentice to Mr. Bates, a famous
surgeon in London. There, as my father now and then sent me small sums
of money, I spent them in learning navigation, and other arts useful to
those who travel, as I always believed it would be some time or other my
fortune to do.

Three years after my leaving him my good master, Mr. Bates, recommended
me as ship’s surgeon to the “Swallow,” on which I voyaged three years.
When I came back I settled in London, and, having taken part of a
small house, I married Miss Mary Burton, daughter of Mr. Edmund Burton,
hosier.

But my good master Bates died two years after; and as I had few friends
my business began to fail, and I determined to go again to sea. After
several voyages, I accepted an offer from Captain W. Pritchard, master
of the “Antelope,” who was making a voyage to the South Sea. We set sail
from Bristol, May 4, 1699; and our voyage at first was very prosperous.

But in our passage to the East Indies we were driven by a violent storm
to the north-west of Van Diemen’s Land. Twelve of our crew died from
hard labor and bad food, and the rest were in a very weak condition.
On the 5th of November, the weather being very hazy, the seamen spied
a rock within 120 yards of the ship; but the wind was so strong that we
were driven straight upon it, and immediately split. Six of the crew,
of whom I was one, letting down the boat, got clear of the ship, and we
rowed about three leagues, till we could work no longer. We therefore
trusted ourselves to the mercy of the waves; and in about half an hour
the boat was upset by a sudden squall. What became of my companions in
the boat, or those who escaped on the rock or were left in the vessel,
I cannot tell; but I conclude they were all lost. For my part, I swam as
fortune directed me, and was pushed forward by wind and tide; but when
I was able to struggle no longer I found myself within my depth. By this
time the storm was much abated. I reached the shore at last, about eight
o’clock in the evening, and advanced nearly half a mile inland, but
could not discover any sign of inhabitants. I was extremely tired, and
with the heat of the weather I found myself much inclined to sleep. I
lay down on the grass, which was very short and soft, and slept sounder
than ever I did in my life for about nine hours. When I woke, it was
just daylight. I attempted to rise, but could not; for as I happened to
be lying on my back, I found my arms and legs were fastened on each side
to the ground; and my hair, which was long and thick, tied down in the
same manner. I could only look upward. The sun began to grow hot, and
the light hurt my eyes. I heard a confused noise about me, but could
see nothing except the sky. In a little time I felt something alive
and moving on my left leg, which, advancing gently over my breast, came
almost up to my chin, when, bending my eyes downward, I perceived it to
be a human creature, not six inches high, with a bow and arrow in his
hands, and a quiver at his back. In the meantime I felt at least forty
more following the first. I was in the utmost astonishment, and roared
so loud that they all ran back in a fright; and some of them were
hurt with the falls they got by leaping from my sides upon the ground.
However, they soon returned, and one of them, who ventured so far as to
get a full sight of my face, lifted up his hands in admiration. I lay
all this while in great uneasiness; but at length, struggling to get
loose, I succeeded in breaking the strings that fastened my left arm
to the ground; and at the same time, with a violent pull that gave me
extreme pain, I a little loosened the strings that tied down my hair, so
that I was just able to turn my head about two inches. But the creatures
ran off a second time before I could seize them, whereupon there was a
great shout, and in an instant I felt above a hundred arrows discharged
on my left hand, which pricked me like so many needles. Moreover, they
shot another flight into the air, of which some fell on my face, which
I immediately covered with my left hand. When this shower of arrows
was over I groaned with grief and pain, and then, striving again to get
loose, they discharged another flight of arrows larger than the first,
and some of them tried to stab me with their spears; but by good luck
I had on a leather jacket, which they could not pierce. By this time
I thought it most prudent to lie still till night, when, my left
hand being already loose, I could easily free myself; and as for the
inhabitants, I thought I might be a match for the greatest army they
could bring against me if they were all of the same size as him I
saw. When the people observed that I was quiet they discharged no more
arrows, but by the noise I heard I knew that their number was increased;
and about four yards from me, for more than an hour, there was a
knocking, like people at work. Then, turning my head that way as well
as the pegs and strings would let me, I saw a stage set up, about a foot
and a half from the ground, with two or three ladders to mount it. From
this, one of them, who seemed to be a person of quality, made me a long
speech, of which I could not understand a word, though I could tell from
his manner that he sometimes threatened me, and sometimes spoke with
pity and kindness. I answered in few words, but in the most submissive
manner; and, being almost famished with hunger, I could not help showing
my impatience by putting my finger frequently to my mouth, to signify
that I wanted food. He understood me very well, and, descending from the
stage, commanded that several ladders should be set against my sides, on
which more than a hundred of the inhabitants mounted, and walked toward
my mouth with baskets full of food, which had been sent by the King’s
orders when he first received tidings of me. There were legs and
shoulders like mutton but smaller than the wings of a lark. I ate
them two or three at a mouthful, and took three loaves at a time. They
supplied me as fast as they could, with a thousand marks of wonder at
my appetite. I then made a sign that I wanted something to drink. They
guessed that a small quantity would not suffice me, and, being a most
ingenious people, they slung up one of their largest hogsheads, then
rolled it toward my hand, and beat out the top. I drank it off at a
draught, which I might well do, for it did not hold half a pint. They
brought me a second hogshead, which I drank, and made signs for more;
but they had none to give me. However, I could not wonder enough at the
daring of these tiny mortals, who ventured to mount and walk upon my
body, while one of my hands was free, without trembling at the very
sight of so huge a creature as I must have seemed to them. After some
time there appeared before me a person of high rank from his Imperial
Majesty. His Excellency, having mounted my right leg, advanced to my
face, with about a dozen of his retinue, and spoke about ten minutes,
often pointing forward, which, as I afterward found, was toward the
capital city, about half a mile distant, whither it was commanded by his
Majesty that I should be conveyed. I made a sign with my hand that was
loose, putting it to the other (but over his Excellency’s head, for
fear of hurting him or his train), to show that I desired my liberty.
He seemed to understand me well enough, for he shook his head, though
he made other signs to let me know that I should have meat and drink
enough, and very good treatment. Then I once more thought of attempting
to escape; but when I felt the smart of their arrows on my face and
hands, which were all in blisters and observed likewise that the number
of my enemies increased, I gave tokens to let them know that they might
do with me what they pleased. Then they daubed my face and hands with a
sweet-smelling ointment, which in a few minutes removed all the smarts
of the arrows. The relief from pain and hunger made me drowsy, and
presently I fell asleep. I slept about eight hours, as I was told
afterward; and it was no wonder, for the physicians, by the Emperor’s
orders, had mingled a sleeping draught in the hogsheads of wine.

It seems that, when I was discovered sleeping on the ground after my
landing, the Emperor had early notice of it, and determined that I
should be tied in the manner I have related (which was done in the
night, while I slept), that plenty of meat and drink should be sent me,
and a machine prepared to carry me to the capital city. Five hundred
carpenters and engineers were immediately set to work to prepare the
engine. It was a frame of wood, raised three inches from the ground,
about seven feet long and four wide, moving upon twenty-two wheels. But
the difficulty was to place me on it. Eighty poles were erected for this
purpose, and very strong cords fastened to bandages which the workmen
had tied round my neck, hands, body, and legs. Nine hundred of the
strongest men were employed to draw up these cords by pulleys fastened
on the poles, and in less than three hours I was raised and slung
into the engine, and there tied fast. Fifteen hundred of the Emperor’s
largest horses, each about four inches and a half high, were then
employed to draw me toward the capital. But while all this was done I
still lay in a deep sleep, and I did not wake till four hours after we
began our journey.

The Emperor and all his Court came out to meet us when we reached the
capital; but his great officials would not suffer his Majesty to risk
his person by mounting on my body. Where the carriage stopped there
stood an ancient temple, supposed to be the largest in the whole
kingdom, and here it was determined that I should lodge. Near the great
gate, through which I could easily creep, they fixed ninety-one chains,
like those which hang to a lady’s watch, which were locked to my
left leg with thirty-six padlocks; and when the workmen found it was
impossible for me to break loose, they cut all the strings that bound
me. Then I rose up, feeling as melancholy as ever I did in my life. But
the noise and astonishment of the people on seeing me rise and walk were
inexpressible. The chains that held my left leg were about two yards
long, and gave me not only freedom to walk backward and forward in a
semicircle, but to creep in and lie at full length inside the temple.
The Emperor, advancing toward me from among his courtiers, all most
magnificently clad, surveyed me with great admiration, but kept beyond
the length of my chain. He was taller by about the breadth of my nail
than any of his Court, which alone was enough to strike awe into the
beholders, and graceful and majestic. The better to behold him, I lay
down on my side, so that my face was level with his, and he stood three
yards off. However, I have had him since many times in my hand, and
therefore cannot be deceived. His dress was very simple; but he wore a
light helmet of gold, adorned with jewels and a plume. He held his sword
drawn in his hand, to defend himself if I should break loose; it was
almost three inches long, and the hilt was of gold, enriched with
diamonds. His voice was shrill, but very clear. His Imperial Majesty
spoke often to me, and I answered; but neither of us could understand a
word.


After about two hours the Court retired, and I was left with a strong
guard to keep away the crowd, some of whom had had the impudence to
shoot their arrows at me as I sat by the door of my house. But the
colonel ordered six of them to be seized and delivered bound into my
hands. I put five of them into my coat pocket; and as to the sixth, I
made a face as if I would eat him alive. The poor man screamed terribly,
and the colonel and his officers were much distressed, especially when
they saw me take out my penknife. But I soon set them at ease, for,
cutting the strings he was bound with, I put him gently on the ground,
and away he ran. I treated the rest in the same manner, taking them one
by one out of my pocket; and I saw that both the soldiers and people
were delighted at this mark of my kindness.

Toward night I got with some difficulty into my house, where I lay on
the ground, as I had to do for a fortnight, till a bed was prepared for
me out of six hundred beds of the ordinary measure.

Six hundred servants were appointed me, and three hundred tailors made
me a suit of clothes. Moreover, six of his Majesty’s greatest scholars
were employed to teach me their language, so that soon I was able to
converse after a fashion with the Emperor, who often honored me with his
visits. The first words I learned were to desire that he would please
to give me my liberty, which I every day repeated on my knees; but he
answered that this must be a work of time, and that first I must swear a
peace with him and his kingdom. He told me also that by the laws of the
nation I must be searched by two of his officers, and that as this could
not be done without my help, he trusted them in my hands, and whatever
they took from me should be returned when I left the country. I took up
the two officers, and put them into my coat pockets. These gentlemen,
having pen, ink, and paper about them, made an exact list of everything
they saw, which I afterward translated into English, and which ran as
follows:

“In the right coat pocket of the great Man-Mountain we found only one
great piece of coarse cloth, large enough to cover the carpet of your
Majesty’s chief room of state. In the left pocket we saw a huge silver
chest, with a silver cover, which we could not lift. We desired that it
should be opened, and one of us stepping into it found himself up to the
mid-leg in a sort of dust, some of which flying into our faces sent us
both into a fit of sneezing. In his right waistcoat pocket we found a
number of white thin substances, folded one over another, about the size
of three men, tied with a strong cable, and marked with black figures,
which we humbly conceive to be writings. In the left there was a sort of
engine, from the back of which extended twenty long poles, with which,
we conjecture, the Man-Mountain combs his head. In the smaller pocket on
the right side were several round flat pieces of white and red metal, of
different sizes. Some of the white, which appeared to be silver, were
so large and heavy that my comrade and I could hardly lift them. From
another pocket hung a huge silver chain, with a wonderful kind of engine
fastened to it, a globe half silver and half of some transparent metal;
for on the transparent side we saw certain strange figures, and thought
we could touch them till we found our fingers stopped by the shining
substance. This engine made an incessant noise, like a water-mill, and
we conjecture it is either some unknown animal, or the god he worships,
but probably the latter, for he told us that he seldom did anything
without consulting it.

“This is a list of what we found about the body of the Man-Mountain, who
treated us with great civility.”

I had one private pocket which escaped their search, containing a pair
of spectacles and a small spy-glass, which, being of no consequence to
the Emperor, I did not think myself bound in honor to discover.



My gentleness and good behavior gained so far on the Emperor and his
Court, and, indeed, on the people in general, that I began to have hopes
of getting my liberty in a short time. The natives came by degrees to be
less fearful of danger from me. I would sometimes lie down and let five
or six of them dance on my hand; and at last the boys and girls ventured
to come and play at hide-and-seek in my hair.

The horses of the army and of the royal stables were no longer shy,
having been daily led before me; and one of the Emperor’s huntsmen, on a
large courser, took my foot, shoe and all, which was indeed a prodigious
leap. I amused the Emperor one day in a very extraordinary manner. I
took nine sticks, and fixed them firmly in the ground in a square. Then
I took four other sticks, and tied them parallel at each corner, about
two feet from the ground. I fastened my handkerchief to the nine sticks
that stood erect, and extended it on all sides till it was as tight as
the top of a drum; and I desired the Emperor to let a troop of his best
horse, twenty-four in number, come and exercise upon this plain. His
majesty approved of the proposal, and I took them up one by one, with
the proper officers to exercise them. As soon as they got into order
they divided into two parties, discharged blunt arrows, drew their
swords, fled and pursued, and, in short, showed the best military
discipline I ever beheld. The parallel sticks secured them and their
horses from falling off the stage, and the Emperor was so much delighted
that he ordered this entertainment to be repeated several days, and
persuaded the Empress herself to let me hold her in her chair within
two yards of the stage, whence she could view the whole performance.
Fortunately no accident happened, only once a fiery horse, pawing with
his hoof, struck a hole in my handkerchief, and overthrew his rider and
himself. But I immediately relieved them both, and covering the hole
with one hand, I set down the troop with the other as I had taken them
up. The horse that fell was strained in the shoulder; but the rider was
not hurt, and I repaired my handkerchief as well as I could. However,
I would not trust to the strength of it any more in such dangerous
enterprises.

I had sent so many petitions for my liberty that his Majesty at length
mentioned the matter in a full council, where it was opposed by none
except Skyresh Bolgolam, admiral of the realm, who was pleased without
any provocation to be my mortal enemy. However, he agreed at length,
though he succeeded in himself drawing up the conditions on which I
should be set free. After they were read I was requested to swear to
perform them in the method prescribed by their laws, which was to hold
my right foot in my left hand, and to place the middle finger of my
right hand on the crown of my head, and my thumb on the top of my right
ear. But I have made a translation of the conditions, which I here offer
to the public:

“Golbaste Mamarem Evlame Gurdile Shefin Mully Ully Gue, Most Mighty
Emperor of Lilliput, delight and terror of the universe, whose dominions
extend to the ends of the globe, monarch of all monarchs, taller than
the sons of men, whose feet press down to the center, and whose head
strikes against the sun, at whose nod the princes of the earth shake
their knees, pleasant as the spring, comfortable as the summer, fruitful
as autumn, dreadful as winter: His Most Sublime Majesty proposeth to the
Man-Mountain, lately arrived at our celestial dominions, the following
articles, which by a solemn oath he shall be obliged to perform:

“First. The Man-Mountain shall not depart from our dominions without our
license under the great seal.

“Second. He shall not presume to come into our metropolis without our
express order, at which time the inhabitants shall have two hours’
warning to keep within doors.

“Third. The said Man-Mountain shall confine his walks to our principal
high roads, and not offer to walk or lie down in a meadow or field of
corn.

“Fourth. As he walks the said roads he shall take the utmost care not to
trample upon the bodies of any of our loving subjects, their horses or
carriages, nor take any of our subjects into his hands without their own
consent.

“Fifth. If an express requires extraordinary speed the Man-Mountain
shall be obliged to carry in his pocket the messenger and horse a six
days’ journey, and return the said messenger (if so required) safe to
our imperial presence.

“Sixth. He shall be our ally against our enemies in the island of
Blefuscu, and do his utmost to destroy their fleet, which is now
preparing to invade us.

“Lastly. Upon his solemn oath to observe all the above articles,
the said Man-Mountain shall have a daily allowance of meat and drink
sufficient for the support of 1,724 of our subjects, with free access to
our royal person, and other marks of our favor. Given at our palace at
Belfaburac, the twelfth day of the ninety-first moon of our reign.”

I swore to these articles with great cheerfulness, whereupon my chains
were immediately unlocked, and I was at full liberty.

One morning, about a fortnight after I had obtained my freedom,
Reldresal, the Emperor’s secretary for private affairs, came to my
house, attended only by one servant. He ordered his coach to wait at
a distance, and desired that I would give him an hour’s audience. I
offered to lie down that he might the more conveniently reach my
ear; but he chose rather to let me hold him in my hand during our
conversation. He began with compliments on my liberty, but he added
that, save for the present state of things at Court, perhaps I might not
have obtained it so soon. “For,” he said, “however flourishing we may
seem to foreigners, we are in danger of an invasion from the island of
Blefuscu, which is the other great empire of the universe, almost as
large and as powerful as this of his Majesty. For as to what we have
heard you say, that there are other kingdoms in the world, inhabited
by human creatures as large as yourself, our philosophers are very
doubtful, and rather conjecture that you dropped from the moon, or one
of the stars, because a hundred mortals of your size would soon destroy
all the fruit and cattle of his Majesty’s dominions. Besides, our
histories of six thousand moons make no mention of any other regions
than the two mighty empires of Lilliput and Blefuscu, which, as I was
going to tell you, are engaged in a most obstinate war, which began in
the following manner: It is allowed on all hands that the primitive
way of breaking eggs was upon the larger end; but his present Majesty’s
grandfather, while he was a boy, going to eat an egg, and breaking it
according to the ancient practice, happened to cut one of his fingers.
Whereupon the Emperor, his father, made a law commanding all his
subjects to break the smaller end of their eggs. The people so highly
resented this law that there have been six rebellions raised on that
account, wherein one emperor lost his life, and another his crown. It is
calculated that eleven hundred persons have at different times suffered
rather than break their eggs at the smaller end. But these rebels,
the Bigendians, have found so much encouragement at the Emperor of
Blefuscu’s Court, to which they always fled for refuge, that a bloody
war, as I said, has been carried on between the two empires for
six-and-thirty moons; and now the Blefuscudians have equipped a large
fleet, and are preparing to descend upon us. Therefore his Imperial
Majesty, placing great confidence in your valor and strength, has
commanded me to set the case before you.”

I desired the secretary to present my humble duty to the Emperor, and
to let him know that I was ready, at the risk of my life, to defend him
against all invaders.


It was not long before I communicated to his Majesty the plan I formed
for seizing the enemy’s whole fleet. The Empire of Blefuscu is an island
parted from Lilliput only by a channel eight hundred yards wide. I
consulted the most experienced seamen on the depth of the channel, and
they told me that in the middle, at high water, it was seventy glumguffs
(about six feet of European measure). I walked toward the coast, where,
lying down behind a hillock, I took out my spy-glass, and viewed the
enemy’s fleet at anchor--about fifty men-of-war, and other vessels. I
then came back to my house and gave orders for a great quantity of
the strongest cables and bars of iron. The cable was about as thick as
packthread, and the bars of the length and size of a knitting-needle. I
trebled the cable to make it stronger, and for the same reason twisted
three of the iron bars together, bending the ends into a hook. Having
thus fixed fifty hooks to as many cables, I went back to the coast,
and taking off my coat, shoes, and stockings, walked into the sea in my
leather jacket about half an hour before high water. I waded with what
haste I could, swimming in the middle about thirty yards, till I felt
ground, and thus arrived at the fleet in less than half an hour. The
enemy was so frightened when they saw me that they leaped out of their
ships and swam ashore, where there could not be fewer than thirty
thousand. Then, fastening a hook to the hole at the prow of each ship,
I tied all the cords together at the end. Meanwhile the enemy discharged
several thousand arrows, many of which stuck in my hands and face. My
greatest fear was for my eyes, which I should have lost if I had
not suddenly thought of the pair of spectacles which had escaped the
Emperor’s searchers. These I took out and fastened upon my nose, and
thus armed went on with my work in spite of the arrows, many of which
struck against the glasses of my spectacles, but without any other
effect than slightly disturbing them. Then, taking the knot in my hand,
I began to pull; but not a ship would stir, for they were too fast
held by their anchors. Thus the boldest part of my enterprise remained.
Letting go the cord, I resolutely cut with my knife the cables that
fastened the anchors, receiving more than two hundred shots in my face
and hands. Then I took up again the knotted end of the cables to which
my hooks were tied, and with great ease drew fifty of the enemy’s
largest men-of-war after me.

When the Blefuscudians saw the fleet moving in order, and me pulling at
the end, they set up a scream of grief and despair that it is impossible
to describe. When I had got out of danger I stopped awhile to pick out
the arrows that stuck in my hands and face, and rubbed on some of
the same ointment that was given me at my arrival. I then took off my
spectacles, and after waiting about an hour, till the tide was a little
fallen, I waded on to the royal port of Lilliput.

The Emperor and his whole Court stood on the shore awaiting me. They saw
the ships move forward in a large half-moon, but could not discern me,
who, in the middle of the channel, was under water up to my neck. The
Emperor concluded that I was drowned, and that the enemy’s fleet was
approaching in a hostile manner. But he was soon set at ease, for, the
channel growing shallower every step I made, I came in a short time
within hearing, and holding up the end of the cable by which the fleet
was fastened, I cried in a loud voice: “Long live the most puissant
Emperor of Lilliput!” The Prince received me at my landing with all
possible joy, and made me a Nardal on the spot, which is the highest
title of honor among them.

His Majesty desired that I would take some opportunity to bring all the
rest of his enemy’s ships into his ports, and seemed to think of nothing
less than conquering the whole Empire of Blefuscu, and becoming the sole
monarch of the world. But I plainly protested that I would never be the
means of bringing a free and brave people into slavery; and though
the wisest of the Ministers were of my opinion, my open refusal was so
opposed to his Majesty’s ambition that he could never forgive me. And
from this time a plot began between himself and those of his Ministers
who were my enemies, that nearly ended in my utter destruction.

About three weeks after this exploit there arrived an embassy from
Blefuscu, with humble offers of peace, which was soon concluded, on
terms very advantageous to our Emperor. There were six ambassadors, with
a train of about five hundred persons, all very magnificent. Having been
privately told that I had befriended them, they made me a visit, and
paying me many compliments on my valor and generosity, invited me
to their kingdom in the Emperor their master’s name. I asked them to
present my most humble respects to the Emperor their master, whose
royal person I resolved to attend before I returned to my own country.
Accordingly, the next time I had the honor to see our Emperor I desired
his general permission to visit the Blefuscudian monarch. This he
granted me, but in a very cold manner, of which I afterward learned the
reason.

When I was just preparing to pay my respects to the Emperor of Blefuscu,
a distinguished person at Court, to whom I had once done a great
service, came to my house very privately at night, and without sending
his name desired admission. I put his lordship into my coat pocket, and,
giving orders to a trusty servant to admit no one, I fastened the door,
placed my visitor on the table, and sat down by it. His lordship’s face
was full of trouble; and he asked me to hear him with patience, in a
matter that highly concerned my honor and my life.

“You are aware,” he said, “that Skyresh Bolgolam has been your mortal
enemy ever since your arrival, and his hatred is increased since
your great success against Blefuscu, by which his glory as admiral is
obscured. This lord and others have accused you of treason, and several
councils have been called in the most private manner on your account.
Out of gratitude for your favors I procured information of the whole
proceedings, venturing my head for your service, and this was the charge
against you:

“First, that you, having brought the imperial fleet of Blefuscu into the
royal port, were commanded by his Majesty to seize all the other ships,
and put to death all the Bigendian exiles, and also all the people of
the empire who would not immediately consent to break their eggs at the
smaller end. And that, like a false traitor to his Most Serene Majesty,
you excused yourself from the service on pretence of unwillingness to
force the consciences and destroy the liberties and lives of an innocent
people.

“Again, when ambassadors arrived from the Court of Blefuscu, like a
false traitor, you aided and entertained them, though you knew them to
be servants of a prince lately in open war against his Imperial Majesty.

“Moreover, you are now preparing, contrary to the duty of a faithful
subject, to voyage to the Court of Blefuscu.

“In the debate on this charge,” my friend continued, “his Majesty often
urged the services you had done him, while the admiral and treasurer
insisted that you should be put to a shameful death. But Reldresal,
secretary for private affairs, who has always proved himself your friend
suggested that if his Majesty would please to spare your life and only
give orders to put out both your eyes, justice might in some measure be
satisfied. At this Bolgolam rose up in fury, wondering how the secretary
dared desire to preserve the life of a traitor; and the treasurer,
pointing out the expense of keeping you, also urged your death. But his
Majesty was graciously pleased to say that since the council thought the
loss of your eyes too easy a punishment, some other might afterward be
inflicted. And the secretary, humbly desiring to be heard again, said
that as to expense your allowance might be gradually lessened, so that,
for want of sufficient food you should grow weak and faint, and die in
a few months, when his Majesty’s subjects might cut your flesh from your
bones and bury it, leaving the skeleton for the admiration of posterity.

“Thus, through the great friendship of the secretary the affair was
arranged. It was commanded that the plan of starving you by degrees
should be kept a secret; but the sentence of putting out your eyes was
entered on the books. In three days your friend the secretary will come
to your house and read the accusation before you, and point out the
great mercy of his Majesty, that only condemns you to the loss of
your eyes--which, he does not doubt, you will submit to humbly and
gratefully. Twenty of his Majesty’s surgeons will attend, to see the
operation well performed, by discharging very sharp-pointed arrows into
the balls of your eyes as you lie on the ground.

“I leave you,” said my friend, “to consider what measures you will take;
and, to escape suspicion, I must immediately return, as secretly as I
came.”

His lordship did so; and I remained alone, in great perplexity. At first
I was bent on resistance; for while I had liberty I could easily with
stones pelt the metropolis to pieces; but I soon rejected that idea with
horror, remembering the oath I had made to the Emperor, and the favors
I had received from him. At last, having his Majesty’s leave to pay
my respects to the Emperor of Blefuscu, I resolved to take this
opportunity. Before the three days had passed I wrote a letter to my
friend the secretary telling him of my resolution; and, without waiting
for an answer, went to the coast, and entering the channel, between
wading and swimming reached the port of Blefuscu, where the people, who
had long expected me, led me to the capital.

His Majesty, with the royal family and great officers of the Court, came
out to receive me, and they entertained me in a manner suited to the
generosity of so great a prince. I did not, however, mention my disgrace
with the Emperor of Lilliput, since I did not suppose that prince would
disclose the secret while I was out of his power. But in this, it soon
appeared, I was deceived.


Three days after my arrival, walking out of curiosity to the northeast
coast of the island, I observed at some distance in the sea something
that looked like a boat overturned. I pulled off my shoes and stockings,
and wading two or three hundred yards, I plainly saw it to be a real
boat, which I supposed might by some tempest have been driven from a
ship. I returned immediately to the city for help, and after a huge
amount of labor I managed to get my boat to the royal port of Blefuscu,
where a great crowd of people appeared, full of wonder at sight of so
prodigious a vessel. I told the Emperor that my good fortune had thrown
this boat in my way to carry me to some place whence I might return to
my native country, and begged his orders for materials to fit it up, and
leave to depart--which, after many kindly speeches, he was pleased to
grant.

Meanwhile the Emperor of Lilliput, uneasy at my long absence (but never
imagining that I had the least notice of his designs), sent a person of
rank to inform the Emperor of Blefuscu of my disgrace; this messenger
had orders to represent the great mercy of his master, who was content
to punish me with the loss of my eyes, and who expected that his brother
of Blefuscu would have me sent back to Lilliput, bound hand and foot,
to be punished as a traitor. The Emperor of Blefuscu answered with many
civil excuses. He said that as for sending me bound, his brother knew
it was impossible. Moreover, though I had taken away his fleet he was
grateful to me for many good offices I had done him in making the peace.
But that both their Majesties would soon be made easy; for I had found
a prodigious vessel on the shore, able to carry me on the sea, which
he had given orders to fit up; and he hoped in a few weeks both empires
would be free from me.

With this answer the messenger returned to Lilliput; and I (though the
monarch of Blefuscu secretly offered me his gracious protection if I
would continue in his service) hastened my departure, resolving never
more to put confidence in princes.

In about a month I was ready to take leave. The Emperor of Blefuscu,
with the Empress and the royal family, came out of the palace; and I lay
down on my face to kiss their hands, which they graciously gave me. His
Majesty presented me with fifty purses of sprugs (their greatest gold
coin) and his picture at full length, which I put immediately into one
of my gloves, to keep it from being hurt. Many other ceremonies took
place at my departure.

I stored the boat with meat and drink, and took six cows and two bulls
alive, with as many ewes and rams, intending to carry them into my own
country; and to feed them on board, I had a good bundle of hay and a bag
of corn. I would gladly have taken a dozen of the natives; but this was
a thing the Emperor would by no means permit, and besides a diligent
search into my pockets, his Majesty pledged my honor not to carry away
any of his subjects, though with their own consent and desire.

Having thus prepared all things as well as I was able, I set sail. When
I had made twenty-four leagues, by my reckoning, from the island of
Blefuscu, I saw a sail steering to the northeast. I hailed her, but
could get no answer; yet I found I gained upon her, for the wind
slackened; and in half an hour she spied me, and discharged a gun. I
came up with her between five and six in the evening, Sept. 26, 1701;
but my heart leaped within me to see her English colors. I put my cows
and sheep into my coat pockets, and got on board with all my little
cargo. The captain received me with kindness, and asked me to tell him
what place I came from last; but at my answer he thought I was raving.
However, I took my black cattle and sheep out of my pocket, which, after
great astonishment, clearly convinced him.

We arrived in England on the 13th of April, 1702. I stayed two months
with my wife and family; but my eager desire to see foreign countries
would suffer me to remain no longer. However, while in England I made
great profit by showing my cattle to persons of quality and others; and
before I began my second voyage I sold them for 600_l_. I left 1500_l_.
with my wife, and fixed her in a good house; then taking leave of her
and my boy and girl, with tears on both sides, I sailed on board the
“Adventure.”



Once upon a time there was a man who had a meadow which lay on the side
of a mountain, and in the meadow there was a barn in which he stored
hay. But there had not been much hay in the barn for the last two years,
for every St. John’s eve, when the grass was in the height of its vigor,
it was all eaten clean up, just as if a whole flock of sheep had gnawed
it down to the ground during the night. This happened once, and it
happened twice, but then the man got tired of losing his crop, and
said to his sons--he had three of them, and the third was called
Cinderlad--that one of them must go and sleep in the barn on St. John’s
night, for it was absurd to let the grass be eaten up again, blade and
stalk, as it had been the last two years, and the one who went to watch
must keep a sharp look-out, the man said.

The eldest was quite willing to go to the meadow; he would watch the
grass, he said, and he would do it so well that neither man, nor beast,
nor even the devil himself should have any of it. So when evening came
he went to the barn, and lay down to sleep, but when night was drawing
near there was such a rumbling and such an earthquake that the walls and
roof shook again, and the lad jumped up and took to his heels as fast as
he could, and never even looked back, and the barn remained empty that
year just as it had been for the last two.

Next St. John’s eve the man again said that he could not go on in this
way, losing all the grass in the outlying field year after year, and
that one of his sons must just go there and watch it, and watch well
too. So the next oldest son was willing to show what he could do. He
went to the barn and lay down to sleep, as his brother had done; but
when night was drawing near there was a great rumbling, and then an
earthquake, which was even worse than that on the former St. John’s
night, and when the youth heard it he was terrified, and went off,
running as if for a wager.

The year after, it was Cinderlad’s turn, but when he made ready to go
the others laughed at him, and mocked him. “Well, you are just the right
one to watch the hay, you who have never learned anything but how to sit
among the ashes and bake yourself!” said they. Cinderlad, however, did
not trouble himself about what they said, but when evening drew near
rambled away to the outlying field. When he got there he went into the
barn and lay down, but in about an hour’s time the rumbling and creaking
began, and it was frightful to hear it. “Well, if it gets no worse than
that, I can manage to stand it,” thought Cinderlad. In a little time
the creaking began again, and the earth quaked so that all the hay flew
about the boy. “Oh! if it gets no worse than that I can manage to stand
it,” thought Cinderlad. But then came a third rumbling, and a third
earthquake, so violent that the boy thought the walls and roof had
fallen down, but when that was over everything suddenly grew as still
as death around him. “I am pretty sure that it will come again,” thought
Cinderlad; but no, it did not. Everything was quiet, and everything
stayed quiet, and when he had lain still a short time he heard something
that sounded as if a horse were standing chewing just outside the barn
door. He stole away to the door, which was ajar, to see what was there,
and a horse was standing eating. It was so big, and fat, and fine a
horse that Cinderlad had never seen one like it before, and a saddle
and bridle lay upon it, and a complete suit of armor for a knight, and
everything was of copper, and so bright that it shone again. “Ha, ha! it
is thou who eatest up our hay then,” thought the boy; “but I will stop
that.” So he made haste, and took out his steel for striking fire, and
threw it over the horse, and then it had no power to stir from the spot,
and became so tame that the boy could do what he liked with it. So he
mounted it and rode away to a place which no one knew of but himself,
and there he tied it up. When he went home again his brothers laughed
and asked how he had got on.

“You didn’t lie long in the barn, if even you have been so far as the
field!” said they.

“I lay in the barn till the sun rose, but I saw nothing and heard
nothing, not I,” said the boy. “God knows what there was to make you two
so frightened.”

“Well, we shall soon see whether you have watched the meadow or not,”
 answered the brothers, but when they got there the grass was all
standing just as long and as thick as it had been the night before.

The next St. John’s eve it was the same thing, once again: neither of
the two brothers dared to go to the outlying field to watch the crop,
but Cinderlad went, and everything happened exactly the same as on the
previous St. John’s eve: first there was a rumbling and an earthquake,
and then there was another, and then a third: but all three earthquakes
were much, very much more violent than they had been the year before.
Then everything became still as death again, and the boy heard something
chewing outside the barn door, so he stole as softly as he could to
the door, which was slightly ajar, and again there was a horse standing
close by the wall of the house, eating and chewing, and it was far
larger and fatter than the first horse, and it had a saddle on its back,
and a bridle was on it too, and a full suit of armor for a knight, all
of bright silver, and as beautiful as anyone could wish to see. “Ho,
ho!” thought the boy, “is it thou who eatest up our hay in the night?
but I will put a stop to that.” So he took out his steel for striking
fire, and threw it over the horse’s mane, and the beast stood there as
quiet as a lamb. Then the boy rode this horse, too, away to the place
where he kept the other, and then went home again.

“I suppose you will tell us that you have watched well again this time,”
 said the brothers.

“Well, so I have,” said Cinderlad. So they went there again, and there
the grass was, standing as high and as thick as it had been before, but
that did not make them any kinder to Cinderlad.

When the third St. John’s night came neither of the two elder brothers
dared to lie in the outlying barn to watch the grass, for they had been
so heartily frightened the night that they had slept there that they
could not get over it, but Cinderlad dared to go, and everything
happened just the same as on the two former nights. There were three
earthquakes, each worse than the other, and the last flung the boy from
one wall of the barn to the other, but then everything suddenly
became still as death. When he had lain quietly a short time, he heard
something chewing outside the barn door; then he once more stole to the
door, which was slightly ajar, and behold, a horse was standing just
outside it, which was much larger and fatter than the two others he had
caught. “Ho, ho! it is thou, then, who art eating up our hay this time,”
 thought the boy; “but I will put a stop to that.” So he pulled out his
steel for striking fire, and threw it over the horse, and it stood as
still as if it had been nailed to the field, and the boy could do just
what he liked with it. Then he mounted it and rode away to the place
where he had the two others, and then he went home again. Then the two
brothers mocked him just as they had done before, and told him that they
could see that he must have watched the grass very carefully that night,
for he looked just as if he were walking in his sleep; but Cinderlad did
not trouble himself about that, but just bade them go to the field and
see. They did go, and this time too the grass was standing, looking as
fine and as thick as ever.

The King of the country in which Cinderlad’s father dwelt had a daughter
whom he would give to no one who could not ride up to the top of the
glass hill, for there was a high, high hill of glass, slippery as ice,
and it was close to the King’s palace. Upon the very top of this the
King’s daughter was to sit with three gold apples in her lap, and the
man who could ride up and take the three golden apples should marry her,
and have half the kingdom. The King had this proclaimed in every church
in the whole kingdom, and in many other kingdoms too. The Princess was
very beautiful, and all who saw her fell violently in love with her,
even in spite of themselves. So it is needless to say that all the
princes and knights were eager to win her, and half the kingdom besides,
and that for this cause they came riding thither from the very end of
the world, dressed so splendidly that their raiments gleamed in the
sunshine, and riding on horses which seemed to dance as they went, and
there was not one of these princes who did not think that he was sure to
win the Princess.

When the day appointed by the King had come, there was such a host of
knights and princes under the glass hill that they seemed to swarm, and
everyone who could walk or even creep was there too, to see who won the
King’s daughter. Cinderlad’s two brothers were there too, but they would
not hear of letting him go with them, for he was so dirty and black
with sleeping and grubbing among the ashes that they said everyone would
laugh at them if they were seen in the company of such an oaf.

“Well, then, I will go all alone by myself,” said Cinderlad.

When the two brothers got to the glass hill, all the princes and knights
were trying to ride up it, and their horses were in a foam; but it was
all in vain, for no sooner did the horses set foot upon the hill than
down they slipped, and there was not one which could get even so much as
a couple of yards up. Nor was that strange, for the hill was as smooth
as a glass window-pane, and as steep as the side of a house. But they
were all eager to win the King’s daughter and half the kingdom, so they
rode and they slipped, and thus it went on. At length all the horses
were so tired that they could do no more, and so hot that the foam
dropped from them and the riders were forced to give up the attempt. The
King was just thinking that he would cause it to be proclaimed that the
riding should begin afresh on the following day, when perhaps it might
go better, when suddenly a knight came riding up on so fine a horse that
no one had ever seen the like of it before, and the knight had armor of
copper, and his bridle was of copper too, and all his accoutrements were
so bright that they shone again. The other knights all called out to him
that he might just as well spare himself the trouble of trying to ride
up the glass hill, for it was of no use to try; but he did not heed
them, and rode straight off to it, and went up as if it were nothing at
all. Thus he rode for a long way--it may have been a third part of the
way up--but when he had got so far he turned his horse round and rode
down again. But the Princess thought that she had never yet seen so
handsome a knight, and while he was riding up she was sitting thinking,
“Oh! how I hope he may be able to come up to the top!” And when she saw
that he was turning his horse back she threw one of the golden apples
down after him, and it rolled into his shoe. But when he had come down
from off the hill he rode away, and that so fast that no one knew what
had become of him.

So all the princes and knights were bidden to present themselves before
the King that night, so that he who had ridden so far up the glass hill
might show the golden apple which the King’s daughter had thrown down.
But no one had anything to show. One knight presented himself after the
other, and none could show the apple.

At night, too, Cinderlad’s brothers came home again and had a long story
to tell about riding up the glass hill. At first, they said, there was
not one who was able to get even so much as one step up, but then came
a knight who had armor of copper, and a bridle of copper, and his armor
and trappings were so bright that they shone to a great distance, and it
was something like a sight to see him riding. He rode one-third of the
way up the glass hill, and he could easily have ridden the whole of it
if he had liked; but he had turned back, for he had made up his mind
that that was enough for once. “Oh! I should have liked to see him too,
that I should,” said Cinderlad, who was as usual sitting by the chimney
among the cinders. “You, indeed!” said the brothers, “you look as if you
were fit to be among such great lords, nasty beast that you are to sit
there!”

Next day the brothers were for setting out again, and this time too
Cinderlad begged them to let him go with them and see who rode; but no,
they said he was not fit to do that, for he was much too ugly and dirty.
“Well, well, then I will go all alone by myself,” said Cinderlad. So the
brothers went to the glass hill, and all the princes and knights began
to ride again, and this time they had taken care to roughen the shoes of
their horses; but that did not help them: they rode and they slipped as
they had done the day before, and not one of them could get even so far
as a yard up the hill. When they had tired out their horses, so that
they could do no more, they again had to stop altogether. But just as
the King was thinking that it would be well to proclaim that the riding
should take place next day for the last time, so that they might have
one more chance, he suddenly bethought himself that it would be well to
wait a little longer to see if the knight in copper armor would come on
this day too. But nothing was to be seen of him. Just as they were still
looking for him, however, came a knight riding on a steed that was much,
much finer than that which the knight in copper armor had ridden, and
this knight had silver armor and a silver saddle and bridle, and all
were so bright that they shone and glistened when he was a long way off.
Again the other knights called to him, and said that he might just as
well give up the attempt to ride up the glass hill, for it was useless
to try; but the knight paid no heed to that, but rode straight away
to the glass hill, and went still farther up than the knight in copper
armor had gone; but when he had ridden two-thirds of the way up he
turned his horse around, and rode down again. The Princess liked this
knight still better than she had liked the other, and sat longing that
he might be able to get up above, and when she saw him turning back she
threw the second apple after him, and it rolled into his shoe, and as
soon as he had got down the glass hill he rode away so fast that no one
could see what had become of him.

In the evening, when everyone was to appear before the King and
Princess, in order that he who had the golden apple might show it, one
knight went in after the other, but none of them had a golden apple to
show.

At night the two brothers went home as they had done the night before,
and told how things had gone, and how everyone had ridden, but no one
had been able to get up the hill. “But last of all,” they said, “came
one in silver armor, and he had a silver bridle on his horse, and a
silver saddle, and oh, but he could ride! He took his horse two-thirds
of the way up the hill, but then he turned back. He was a fine fellow,”
 said the brothers, “and the Princess threw the second golden apple to
him!”

“Oh, how I should have liked to see him too!” said Cinderlad.

“Oh, indeed! He was a little brighter than the ashes that you sit
grubbing among, you dirty black creature!” said the brothers.

On the third day everything went just as on the former days. Cinderlad
wanted to go with them to look at the riding, but the two brothers would
not have him in their company, and when they got to the glass hill there
was no one who could ride even so far as a yard up it, and everyone
waited for the knight in silver armor, but he was neither to be seen nor
heard of. At last, after a long time, came a knight riding upon a horse
that was such a fine one, its equal had never yet been seen. The knight
had golden armor, and the horse a golden saddle and bridle, and these
were all so bright that they shone and dazzled everyone, even while the
knight was still at a great distance. The other princes and knights were
not able even to call to tell him how useless it was to try to ascend
the hill, so amazed were they at sight of his magnificence. He rode
straight away to the glass hill, and galloped up it as if it were no
hill at all, so that the Princess had not even time to wish that he
might get up the whole way. As soon as he had ridden to the top, he took
the third golden apple from the lap of the Princess and then turned his
horse about and rode down again, and vanished from their sight before
anyone was able to say a word to him.

When the two brothers came home again at night they had much to tell of
how the riding had gone off that day, and at last they told about the
knight in the golden armor too. “He was a fine fellow, that was! Such
another splendid knight is not to be found on earth!” said the brothers.

“Oh, how I should have liked to see him too!” said Cinderlad.

“Well, he shone nearly as brightly as the coal-heaps that thou art
always lying raking among, dirty black creature that thou art!” said the
brothers.

Next day all the knights and princes were to appear before the King and
Princess--it had been too late for them to do it the night before--in
order that he who had the golden apple might produce it. They all went
in turn, first princes, and then knights, but none of them had a golden
apple.

“But somebody must have it,” said the King, “for with our own eyes we
all saw a man ride up and take it.” So he commanded that everyone in the
kingdom should come to the palace, and see if he could show the apple.
And one after the other they all came, but no one had the golden apple,
and after a long, long time Cinderlad’s two brothers came likewise. They
were the last of all, so the King inquired of them if there was no one
else in the kingdom left to come.

“Oh! yes, we have a brother,” said the two, “but he never got the golden
apple! He never left the cinder-heap on any of the three days.”

“Never mind that,” said the King; “as everyone else has come to the
palace, let him come too.”

So Cinderlad was forced to go to the King’s palace.

“Hast thou the golden apple?” asked the King.

“Yes, here is the first, and here is the second, and here is the third,
too,” said Cinderlad, and he took all three apples out of his pocket,
and with that drew off his sooty rags, and appeared there before them in
his bright golden armor, which gleamed as he stood.

“Thou shalt have my daughter, and the half of my kingdom, and thou hast
well earned both!” said the King. So there was a wedding, and Cinderlad
got the King’s daughter, and everyone made merry at the wedding, for all
of them could make merry, though they could not ride up the glass hill,
and if they have not left off their merry-making they must be at it
still.


There was a sultan, who had three sons and a niece. The eldest of the
Princes was called Houssain, the second Ali, the youngest Ahmed, and the
Princess, his niece, Nouronnihar.

The Princess Nouronnihar was the daughter of the younger brother of the
Sultan, who died, and left the Princess very young. The Sultan took upon
himself the care of his daughter’s education, and brought her up in his
palace with the three Princes, proposing to marry her when she arrived
at a proper age, and to contract an alliance with some neighboring
prince by that means. But when he perceived that the three Princes, his
sons, loved her passionately, he thought more seriously on that affair.
He was very much concerned; the difficulty he foresaw was to make them
agree, and that the two youngest should consent to yield her up to their
elder brother. As he found them positively obstinate, he sent for them
all together, and said to them: “Children, since for your good and
quiet I have not been able to persuade you no longer to aspire to
the Princess, your cousin, I think it would not be amiss if every one
traveled separately into different countries, so that you might not
meet each other. And, as you know I am very curious, and delight in
everything that’s singular, I promise my niece in marriage to him that
shall bring me the most extraordinary rarity; and for the purchase of
the rarity you shall go in search after, and the expense of traveling, I
will give you every one a sum of money.”

As the three Princes were always submissive and obedient to the Sultan’s
will, and each flattered himself fortune might prove favorable to him,
they all consented to it. The Sultan paid them the money he promised
them; and that very day they gave orders for the preparations for their
travels, and took their leave of the Sultan, that they might be the more
ready to go the next morning. Accordingly they all set out at the same
gate of the city, each dressed like a merchant, attended by an officer
of confidence dressed like a slave, and all well mounted and equipped.
They went the first day’s journey together, and lay all at an inn, where
the road was divided into three different tracts. At night, when they
were at supper together, they all agreed to travel for a year, and to
meet at that inn; and that the first that came should wait for the rest;
that, as they had all three taken their leave together of the Sultan,
they might all return together. The next morning by break of day, after
they had embraced and wished each other good success, they mounted their
horses and took each a different road.

Prince Houssain, the eldest brother, arrived at Bisnagar, the capital
of the kingdom of that name, and the residence of its king. He went and
lodged at a khan appointed for foreign merchants; and, having learned
that there were four principal divisions where merchants of all sorts
sold their commodities, and kept shops, and in the midst of which
stood the castle, or rather the King’s palace, he went to one of these
divisions the next day.

Prince Houssain could not view this division without admiration. It was
large, and divided into several streets, all vaulted and shaded from the
sun, and yet very light too. The shops were all of a size, and all
that dealt in the same sort of goods lived in one street; as also the
handicrafts-men, who kept their shops in the smaller streets.

The multitude of shops, stocked with all sorts of merchandise, as the
finest linens from several parts of India, some painted in the most
lively colors, and representing beasts, trees, and flowers; silks and
brocades from Persia, China, and other places, porcelain both from Japan
and China, and tapestries, surprised him so much that he knew not how to
believe his own eyes; but when he came to the goldsmiths and jewelers he
was in a kind of ecstacy to behold such prodigious quantities of wrought
gold and silver, and was dazzled by the lustre of the pearls, diamonds,
rubies, emeralds, and other jewels exposed to sale.

Another thing Prince Houssain particularly admired was the great number
of rose-sellers who crowded the streets; for the Indians are so great
lovers of that flower that no one will stir without a nosegay in his
hand or a garland on his head; and the merchants keep them in pots in
their shops, that the air is perfectly perfumed.

After Prince Houssain had run through that division, street by street,
his thoughts fully employed on the riches he had seen, he was very much
tired, which a merchant perceiving, civilly invited him to sit down in
his shop, and he accepted; but had not been sat down long before he
saw a crier pass by with a piece of tapestry on his arm, about six feet
square, and cried at thirty purses. The Prince called to the crier,
and asked to see the tapestry, which seemed to him to be valued at an
exorbitant price, not only for the size of it, but the meanness of the
stuff; when he had examined it well, he told the crier that he could
not comprehend how so small a piece of tapestry, and of so indifferent
appearance, could be set at so high a price.

The crier, who took him for a merchant, replied: “If this price seems
so extravagant to you, your amazement will be greater when I tell you I
have orders to raise it to forty purses, and not to part with it under.”
 “Certainly,” answered Prince Houssain, “it must have something very
extraordinary in it, which I know nothing of.” “You have guessed it,
sir,” replied the crier, “and will own it when you come to know that
whoever sits on this piece of tapestry may be transported in an instant
wherever he desires to be, without being stopped by any obstacle.”

At this discourse of the crier the Prince of the Indies, considering
that the principal motive of his travel was to carry the Sultan, his
father, home some singular rarity, thought that he could not meet with
any which could give him more satisfaction. “If the tapestry,” said he
to the crier, “has the virtue you assign it, I shall not think forty
purses too much, but shall make you a present besides.” “Sir,” replied
the crier, “I have told you the truth; and it is an easy matter to
convince you of it, as soon as you have made the bargain for forty
purses, on condition I show you the experiment. But, as I suppose you
have not so much about you, and to receive them I must go with you to
your khan, where you lodge, with the leave of the master of the shop, we
will go into the back shop, and I will spread the tapestry; and when we
have both sat down, and you have formed the wish to be transported into
your apartment of the khan, if we are not transported thither it shall
be no bargain, and you shall be at your liberty. As to your present,
though I am paid for my trouble by the seller, I shall receive it as a
favor, and be very much obliged to you, and thankful.”

On the credit of the crier, the Prince accepted the conditions, and
concluded the bargain; and, having got the master’s leave, they went
into his back shop; they both sat down on it, and as soon as the Prince
formed his wish to be transported into his apartment at the khan he
presently found himself and the crier there; and, as he wanted not a
more sufficient proof of the virtue of the tapestry, he counted the
crier out forty pieces of gold, and gave him twenty pieces for himself.

In this manner Prince Houssain became the possessor of the tapestry,
and was overjoyed that at his arrival at Bisnagar he had found so rare
a piece, which he never disputed would gain him the hand of Nouronnihar.
In short, he looked upon it as an impossible thing for the Princes his
younger brothers to meet with anything to be compared with it. It was
in his power, by sitting on his tapestry, to be at the place of meeting
that very day; but, as he was obliged to stay there for his brothers, as
they had agreed, and as he was curious to see the King of Bisnagar and
his Court, and to inform himself of the strength, laws, customs, and
religion of the kingdom, he chose to make a longer abode there, and to
spend some months in satisfying his curiosity.

Prince Houssain might have made a longer abode in the kingdom and
Court of Bisnagar, but he was so eager to be nearer the Princess that,
spreading the tapestry, he and the officer he had brought with him sat
down, and as soon as he had formed his wish were transported to the inn
at which he and his brothers were to meet, and where he passed for a
merchant till they came.

Prince Ali, Prince Houssain’s second brother, who designed to travel
into Persia, took the road, having three days after he parted with
his brothers joined a caravan, and after four days’ travel arrived at
Schiraz, which was the capital of the kingdom of Persia. Here he passed
for a jeweler.

The next morning Prince Ali, who traveled only for his pleasure, and
had brought nothing but just necessaries along with him, after he had
dressed himself, took a walk into that part of the town which they at
Schiraz called the bezestein.

Among all the criers who passed backward and forward with several sorts
of goods, offering to sell them, he was not a little surprised to see
one who held an ivory telescope in his hand of about a foot in length
and the thickness of a man’s thumb, and cried it at thirty purses. At
first he thought the crier mad, and to inform himself went to a shop,
and said to the merchant, who stood at the door: “Pray, sir, is not that
man” (pointing to the crier who cried the ivory perspective glass at
thirty purses) “mad? If he is not, I am very much deceived.”

“Indeed, sir,” answered the merchant, “he was in his right senses
yesterday; I can assure you he is one of the ablest criers we have, and
the most employed of any when anything valuable is to be sold. And if he
cries the ivory perspective glass at thirty purses it must be worth as
much or more, on some account or other. He will come by presently, and
we will call him, and you shall be satisfied; in the meantime sit down
on my sofa, and rest yourself.”

Prince Ali accepted the merchant’s obliging offer, and presently
afterward the crier passed by. The merchant called him by his name, and,
pointing to the Prince, said to him: “Tell that gentleman, who asked
me if you were in your right senses, what you mean by crying that ivory
perspective glass, which seems not to be worth much, at thirty purses.
I should be very much amazed myself if I did not know you.” The crier,
addressing himself to Prince Ali, said: “Sir, you are not the only
person that takes me for a madman on account of this perspective glass.
You shall judge yourself whether I am or no, when I have told you its
property and I hope you will value it at as high a price as those I have
showed it to already, who had as bad an opinion of me as you.

“First, sir,” pursued the crier, presenting the ivory pipe to the
Prince, “observe that this pipe is furnished with a glass at both ends;
and consider that by looking through one of them you see whatever object
you wish to behold.” “I am,” said the Prince, “ready to make you all
imaginable reparation for the scandal I have thrown on you if you will
make the truth of what you advance appear,” and as he had the ivory pipe
in his hand, after he had looked at the two glasses he said: “Show me
at which of these ends I must look that I may be satisfied.” The crier
presently showed him, and he looked through, wishing at the same time to
see the Sultan his father, whom he immediately beheld in perfect health,
set on his throne, in the midst of his council. Afterward, as there was
nothing in the world so dear to him, after the Sultan, as the Princess
Nouronnihar, he wished to see her; and saw her at her toilet laughing,
and in a pleasant humor, with her women about her.

Prince Ali wanted no other proof to be persuaded that this perspective
glass was the most valuable thing in the world, and believed that if
he should neglect to purchase it he should never meet again with such
another rarity. He therefore took the crier with him to the khan where
he lodged, and counted him out the money, and received the perspective
glass.

Prince Ali was overjoyed at his bargain, and persuaded himself that,
as his brothers would not be able to meet with anything so rare and
admirable, the Princess Nouronnihar would be the recompense of his
fatigue and trouble; that he thought of nothing but visiting the Court
of Persia incognito, and seeing whatever was curious in Schiraz and
thereabouts, till the caravan with which he came returned back to the
Indies. As soon as the caravan was ready to set out, the Prince joined
them, and arrived happily without any accident or trouble, otherwise
than the length of the journey and fatigue of traveling, at the place of
rendezvous, where he found Prince Houssain, and both waited for Prince
Ahmed.

Prince Ahmed, who took the road of Samarcand, the next day after his
arrival there went, as his brothers had done, into the bezestein, where
he had not walked long but heard a crier, who had an artificial apple
in his hand, cry it at five and thirty purses; upon which he stopped the
crier, and said to him: “Let me see that apple, and tell me what virtue
and extraordinary properties it has, to be valued at so high a rate.”
 “Sir,” said the crier, giving it into his hand, “if you look at the
outside of this apple, it is very worthless, but if you consider its
properties, virtues, and the great use and benefit it is to mankind, you
will say it is no price for it, and that he who possesses it is master
of a great treasure. In short, it cures all sick persons of the most
mortal diseases; and if the patient is dying it will recover him
immediately and restore him to perfect health; and this is done after
the easiest manner in the world, which is by the patient’s smelling the
apple.”

“If I may believe you,” replied Prince Ahmed, “the virtues of this apple
are wonderful, and it is invaluable; but what ground have I, for all you
tell me, to be persuaded of the truth of this matter?” “Sir,” replied
the crier, “the thing is known and averred by the whole city of
Samarcand; but, without going any further, ask all these merchants you
see here, and hear what they say. You will find several of them will
tell you they had not been alive this day if they had not made use of
this excellent remedy. And, that you may better comprehend what it is,
I must tell you it is the fruit of the study and experiments of a
celebrated philosopher of this city, who applied himself all his
lifetime to the study and knowledge of the virtues of plants and
minerals, and at last attained to this composition, by which he
performed such surprising cures in this town as will never be forgot,
but died suddenly himself, before he could apply his sovereign remedy,
and left his wife and a great many young children behind him, in very
indifferent circumstances, who, to support her family and provide for
her children, is resolved to sell it.”

While the crier informed Prince Ahmed of the virtues of the artificial
apple, a great many persons came about them and confirmed what he said;
and one among the rest said he had a friend dangerously ill, whose life
was despaired of; and that was a favorable opportunity to show Prince
Ahmed the experiment. Upon which Prince Ahmed told the crier he would
give him forty purses if he cured the sick person.

The crier, who had orders to sell it at that price, said to Prince
Ahmed: “Come, sir, let us go and make the experiment, and the apple
shall be yours; and I can assure you that it will always have the
desired effect.” In short, the experiment succeeded, and the Prince,
after he had counted out to the crier forty purses, and he had delivered
the apple to him, waited patiently for the first caravan that should
return to the Indies, and arrived in perfect health at the inn where the
Princes Houssain and Ali waited for him.

When the Princes met they showed each other their treasures, and
immediately saw through the glass that the Princess was dying. They then
sat down on the carpet, wished themselves with her, and were there in a
moment.

Prince Ahmed no sooner perceived himself in Nouronnihar’s chamber than
he rose off the tapestry, as did also the other two Princes, and went
to the bedside, and put the apple under her nose; some moments after the
Princess opened her eyes, and turned her head from one side to another,
looking at the persons who stood about her; and then rose up in the bed,
and asked to be dressed, just as if she had waked out of a sound sleep.
Her women having presently informed her, in a manner that showed their
joy, that she was obliged to the three Princes for the sudden recovery
of her health, and particularly to Prince Ahmed, she immediately
expressed her joy to see them, and thanked them all together, and
afterward Prince Ahmed in particular.

While the Princess was dressing the Princes went to throw themselves at
the Sultan their father’s feet, and pay their respects to him. But when
they came before him they found he had been informed of their arrival by
the chief of the Princess’s eunuchs, and by what means the Princess had
been perfectly cured. The Sultan received and embraced them with the
greatest joy, both for their return and the recovery of the Princess his
niece, whom he loved as well as if she had been his own daughter, and
who had been given over by the physicians. After the usual ceremonies
and compliments the Princes presented each his rarity: Prince Houssain
his tapestry, which he had taken care not to leave behind him in the
Princess’s chamber; Prince Ali his ivory perspective glass, and Prince
Ahmed his artificial apple; and after each had commended their present,
when they put it into the Sultan’s hands, they begged of him to
pronounce their fate, and declare to which of them he would give the
Princess Nouronnihar for a wife, according to his promise.

The Sultan of the Indies, having heard, without interrupting them, all
that the Princes could represent further about their rarities, and
being well informed of what had happened in relation to the Princess
Nouronnihar’s cure, remained some time silent, as if he were thinking
on what answer he should make. At last he broke the silence, and said
to them: “I would declare for one of you children with a great deal of
pleasure if I could do it with justice; but consider whether I can do it
or no. ‘Tis true, Prince Ahmed, the Princess my niece is obliged to
your artificial apple for her cure; but I must ask you whether or no
you could have been so serviceable to her if you had not known by Prince
Ali’s perspective glass the danger she was in, and if Prince Houssain’s
tapestry had not brought you so soon. Your perspective glass, Prince
Ali, informed you and your brothers that you were like to lose the
Princess your cousin, and there you must own a great obligation.

“You must also grant that that knowledge would have been of no service
without the artificial apple and the tapestry. And lastly, Prince
Houssain, the Princess would be very ungrateful if she should not
show her acknowledgment of the service of your tapestry, which was so
necessary a means toward her cure. But consider, it would have been of
little use if you had not been acquainted with the Princess’s illness
by Prince Ali’s glass, and Prince Ahmed had not applied his artificial
apple. Therefore, as neither tapestry, ivory perspective glass, nor
artificial apple have the least preference one before the other, but, on
the contrary, there’s a perfect equality, I cannot grant the Princess to
any one of you; and the only fruit you have reaped from your travels is
the glory of having equally contributed to restore her health.

“If all this be true,” added the Sultan, “you see that I must have
recourse to other means to determine certainly in the choice I ought
to make among you; and that, as there is time enough between this and
night, I’ll do it to-day. Go and get each of you a bow and arrow, and
repair to the great plain, where they exercise horses. I’ll soon come to
you, and declare I will give the Princess Nouronnihar to him that shoots
the farthest.”

The three Princes had nothing to say against the decision of the Sultan.
When they were out of his presence they each provided themselves with a
bow and arrow, which they delivered to one of their officers, and went
to the plain appointed, followed by a great concourse of people.

The Sultan did not make them wait long for him, and as soon as he
arrived Prince Houssain, as the eldest, took his bow and arrow and shot
first; Prince Ali shot next, and much beyond him; and Prince Ahmed last
of all, but it so happened that nobody could see where his arrow fell;
and, notwithstanding all the diligence that was used by himself and
everybody else, it was not to be found far or near. And though it was
believed that he shot the farthest, and that he therefore deserved the
Princess Nouronnihar, it was, however, necessary that his arrow
should be found to make the matter more evident and certain; and,
notwithstanding his remonstrance, the Sultan judged in favor of Prince
Ali, and gave orders for preparations to be made for the wedding, which
was celebrated a few days after with great magnificence.

Prince Houssain would not honor the feast with his presence. In short,
his grief was so violent and insupportable that he left the Court, and
renounced all right of succession to the crown, to turn hermit.

Prince Ahmed, too, did not come to Prince Ali’s and the Princess
Nouronnihar’s wedding any more than his brother Houssain, but did not
renounce the world as he had done. But, as he could not imagine what had
become of his arrow, he stole away from his attendants and resolved to
search after it, that he might not have anything to reproach himself
with. With this intent he went to the place where the Princes Houssain’s
and Ali’s were gathered up, and, going straight forward from there,
looking carefully on both sides of him, he went so far that at last
he began to think his labor was all in vain; but yet he could not help
going forward till he came to some steep craggy rocks, which were
bounds to his journey, and were situated in a barren country, about four
leagues distant from where he set out.


When Prince Ahmed came pretty nigh to these rocks he perceived an arrow,
which he gathered up, looked earnestly at it, and was in the greatest
astonishment to find it was the same he shot away. “Certainly,” said he
to himself, “neither I nor any man living could shoot an arrow so far,”
 and, finding it laid flat, not sticking into the ground, he judged that
it rebounded against the rock. “There must be some mystery in this,”
 said he to himself again, “and it may be advantageous to me. Perhaps
fortune, to make me amends for depriving me of what I thought the
greatest happiness, may have reserved a greater blessing for my
comfort.”

As these rocks were full of caves and some of those caves were deep, the
Prince entered into one, and, looking about, cast his eyes on an iron
door, which seemed to have no lock, but he feared it was fastened.
However, thrusting against it, it opened, and discovered an easy
descent, but no steps, which he walked down with his arrow in his
hand. At first he thought he was going into a dark, obscure place, but
presently a quite different light succeeded that which he came out of,
and, entering into a large, spacious place, at about fifty or sixty
paces distant, he perceived a magnificent palace, which he had not then
time enough to look at. At the same time a lady of majestic port and air
advanced as far as the porch, attended by a large troop of ladies, so
finely dressed and beautiful that it was difficult to distinguish which
was the mistress.

As soon as Prince Ahmed perceived the lady, he made all imaginable
haste to go and pay his respects; and the lady, on her part, seeing him
coming, prevented him from addressing his discourse to her first, but
said to him: “Come nearer, Prince Ahmed, you are welcome.”

It was no small surprise to the Prince to hear himself named in a place
he had never heard of, though so nigh to his father’s capital, and he
could not comprehend how he should be known to a lady who was a stranger
to him. At last he returned the lady’s compliment by throwing himself at
her feet, and, rising up again, said to her:

“Madam, I return you a thousand thanks for the assurance you give me of
a welcome to a place where I believed my imprudent curiosity had made
me penetrate too far. But, madam, may I, without being guilty of ill
manners, dare to ask you by what adventure you know me? and how you, who
live in the same neighborhood with me, should be so great a stranger to
me?”

“Prince,” said the lady, “let us go into the hall, there I will gratify
you in your request.”

After these words the lady led Prince Ahmed into the hall. Then she sat
down on a sofa, and when the Prince by her entreaty had done the same
she said: “You are surprised, you say, that I should know you and not be
known by you, but you will be no longer surprised when I inform you who
I am. You are undoubtedly sensible that your religion teaches you to
believe that the world is inhabited by genies as well as men. I am the
daughter of one of the most powerful and distinguished genies, and my
name is Paribanou. The only thing that I have to add is, that you seemed
to me worthy of a more happy fate than that of possessing the Princess
Nouronnihar; and, that you might attain to it, I was present when you
drew your arrow, and foresaw it would not go beyond Prince Houssain’s.
I took it in the air, and gave it the necessary motion to strike against
the rocks near which you found it, and I tell you that it lies in your
power to make use of the favorable opportunity which presents itself to
make you happy.”

As the Fairy Paribanou pronounced these last words with a different
tone, and looked, at the same time, tenderly upon Prince Ahmed, with
a modest blush on her cheeks, it was no hard matter for the Prince to
comprehend what happiness she meant. He presently considered that the
Princess Nouronnihar could never be his and that the Fairy Paribanou
excelled her infinitely in beauty, agreeableness, wit, and, as much
as he could conjecture by the magnificence of the palace, in immense
riches. He blessed the moment that he thought of seeking after his arrow
a second time, and, yielding to his love, “Madam,” replied he, “should
I all my life have the happiness of being your slave, and the admirer
of the many charms which ravish my soul, I should think myself the most
blessed of men. Pardon in me the boldness which inspires me to ask this
favor, and don’t refuse to admit me into your Court, a prince who is
entirely devoted to you.”

“Prince,” answered the Fairy, “will you not pledge your faith to me,
as well as I give mine to you?” “Yes, madam,” replied the Prince, in an
ecstacy of joy; “what can I do better, and with greater pleasure?
Yes, my sultaness, my queen, I’ll give you my heart without the least
reserve.” “Then,” answered the Fairy, “you are my husband, and I am
your wife. But, as I suppose,” pursued she, “that you have eaten nothing
to-day, a slight repast shall be served up for you, while preparations
are making for our wedding feast at night, and then I will show you the
apartments of my palace, and you shall judge if this hall is not the
meanest part of it.”

Some of the Fairy’s women, who came into the hall with them, and guessed
her intentions, went immediately out, and returned presently with some
excellent meats and wines.

When Prince Ahmed had ate and drunk as much as he cared for, the Fairy
Paribanou carried him through all the apartments, where he saw diamonds,
rubies, emeralds and all sorts of fine jewels, intermixed with pearls,
agate, jasper, porphyry, and all sorts of the most precious marbles.
But, not to mention the richness of the furniture, which was
inestimable, there was such a profuseness throughout that the Prince,
instead of ever having seen anything like it, owned that he could not
have imagined that there was anything in the world that could come up to
it. “Prince,” said the Fairy, “if you admire my palace so much, which,
indeed, is very beautiful, what would you say to the palaces of the
chief of our genies, which are much more beautiful, spacious, and
magnificent? I could also charm you with my gardens, but we will let
that alone till another time. Night draws near, and it will be time to
go to supper.”

The next hall which the Fairy led the Prince into, and where the cloth
was laid for the feast, was the last apartment the Prince had not seen,
and not in the least inferior to the others. At his entrance into it
he admired the infinite number of sconces of wax candles perfumed with
amber, the multitude of which, instead of being confused, were placed
with so just a symmetry as formed an agreeable and pleasant sight. A
large side table was set out with all sorts of gold plate, so finely
wrought that the workmanship was much more valuable than the weight of
the gold. Several choruses of beautiful women richly dressed, and whose
voices were ravishing, began a concert, accompanied with all sorts of
the most harmonious instruments; and when they were set down at table
the Fairy Paribanou took care to help Prince Ahmed to the most delicate
meats, which she named as she invited him to eat of them, and which
the Prince found to be so exquisitely nice that he commended them with
exaggeration, and said that the entertainment far surpassed those of
man. He found also the same excellence in the wines, which neither he
nor the Fairy tasted of till the dessert was served up, which consisted
of the choicest sweetmeats and fruits.

The wedding feast was continued the next day, or, rather, the days
following the celebration were a continual feast.

At the end of six months Prince Ahmed, who always loved and honored the
Sultan his father, conceived a great desire to know how he was, and
that desire could not be satisfied without his going to see; he told the
Fairy of it, and desired she would give him leave.

“Prince,” said she, “go when you please. But first, don’t take it amiss
that I give you some advice how you shall behave yourself where you are
going. First, I don’t think it proper for you to tell the Sultan your
father of our marriage, nor of my quality, nor the place where you have
been. Beg of him to be satisfied in knowing you are happy, and desire
no more; and let him know that the sole end of your visit is to make him
easy, and inform him of your fate.”

She appointed twenty gentlemen, well mounted and equipped, to attend
him. When all was ready Prince Ahmed took his leave of the Fairy,
embraced her, and renewed his promise to return soon. Then his horse,
which was most finely caparisoned, and was as beautiful a creature as
any in the Sultan of Indies’ stables, was led to him, and he mounted him
with an extraordinary grace; and, after he had bid her a last adieu, set
forward on his journey.

As it was not a great way to his father’s capital, Prince Ahmed soon
arrived there. The people, glad to see him again, received him with
acclamations of joy, and followed him in crowds to the Sultan’s
apartment. The Sultan received and embraced him with great joy,
complaining at the same time, with a fatherly tenderness, of the
affliction his long absence had been to him, which he said was the more
grievous for that, fortune having decided in favor of Prince Ali his
brother, he was afraid he might have committed some rash action.

The Prince told a story of his adventures without speaking of the Fairy,
whom he said that he must not mention, and ended: “The only favor I
ask of your Majesty is to give me leave to come often and pay you my
respects, and to know how you do.”

“Son,” answered the Sultan of the Indies, “I cannot refuse you the leave
you ask me; but I should much rather you would resolve to stay with me;
at least tell me where I may send to you if you should fail to come, or
when I may think your presence necessary.” “Sir,” replied Prince Ahmed,
“what your Majesty asks of me is part of the mystery I spoke to your
Majesty of. I beg of you to give me leave to remain silent on this head,
for I shall come so frequently that I am afraid that I shall sooner be
thought troublesome than be accused of negligence in my duty.”

The Sultan of the Indies pressed Prince Ahmed no more, but said to him:
“Son, I penetrate no farther into your secrets, but leave you at your
liberty; but can tell you that you could not do me a greater pleasure
than to come, and by your presence restore to me the joy I have not
felt this long time, and that you shall always be welcome when you come,
without interrupting your business or pleasure.”

Prince Ahmed stayed but three days at the Sultan his father’s Court, and
the fourth returned to the Fairy Paribanou, who did not expect him so
soon.

A month after Prince Ahmed’s return from paying a visit to his father,
as the Fairy Paribanou had observed that the Prince, since the time that
he gave her an account of his journey, his discourse with his father,
and the leave he asked to go and see him often, had never talked of the
Sultan, as if there had been no such person in the world, whereas before
he was always speaking of him, she thought he forebore on her account;
therefore she took an opportunity to say to him one day: “Prince, tell
me, have you forgot the Sultan your father? Don’t you remember the
promise you made to go and see him often? For my part I have not forgot
what you told me at your return, and so put you in mind of it, that you
may not be long before you acquit yourself of your promise.”

So Prince Ahmed went the next morning with the same attendance as
before, but much finer, and himself more magnificently mounted,
equipped, and dressed, and was received by the Sultan with the same
joy and satisfaction. For several months he constantly paid his visits,
always in a richer and finer equipage.

At last some viziers, the Sultan’s favorites, who judged of Prince
Ahmed’s grandeur and power by the figure he cut, made the Sultan jealous
of his son, saying it was to be feared he might inveigle himself into
the people’s favor and dethrone him.

The Sultan of the Indies was so far from thinking that Prince Ahmed
could be capable of so pernicious a design as his favorites would make
him believe that he said to them: “You are mistaken; my son loves me,
and I am certain of his tenderness and fidelity, as I have given him no
reason to be disgusted.”

But the favorites went on abusing Prince Ahmed till the Sultan said: “Be
it as it will, I don’t believe my son Ahmed is so wicked as you would
persuade me he is; how ever, I am obliged to you for your good advice,
and don’t dispute but that it proceeds from your good intentions.”

The Sultan of the Indies said this that his favorites might not know the
impressions their discourse had made on his mind; which had so alarmed
him that he resolved to have Prince Ahmed watched unknown to his grand
vizier. So he sent for a female magician, who was introduced by a back
door into his apartment. “Go immediately,” he said, “and follow my son,
and watch him so well as to find out where he retires, and bring me
word.”

The magician left the Sultan, and, knowing the place where Prince Ahmed
found his arrow, went immediately thither, and hid herself near the
rocks, so that nobody could see her.

The next morning Prince Ahmed set out by daybreak, without taking leave
either of the Sultan or any of his Court, according to custom. The
magician, seeing him coming, followed him with her eyes, till on a
sudden she lost sight of him and his attendants.

As the rocks were very steep and craggy, they were an insurmountable
barrier, so that the magician judged that there were but two things
for it: either that the Prince retired into some cavern, or an abode of
genies or fairies. Thereupon she came out of the place where she was hid
and went directly to the hollow way, which she traced till she came
to the farther end, looking carefully about on all sides; but,
notwithstanding all her diligence, could perceive no opening, not so
much as the iron gate which Prince Ahmed discovered, which was to be
seen and opened to none but men, and only to such whose presence was
agreeable to the Fairy Paribanou.

The magician, who saw it was in vain for her to search any farther, was
obliged to be satisfied with the discovery she had made, and returned to
give the Sultan an account.

The Sultan was very well pleased with the magician’s conduct, and said
to her: “Do you as you think fit; I’ll wait patiently the event of your
promises,” and to encourage her made her a present of a diamond of great
value.

As Prince Ahmed had obtained the Fairy Paribanou’s leave to go to the
Sultan of the Indies’ Court once a month, he never failed, and the
magician, knowing the time, went a day or two before to the foot of the
rock where she lost sight of the Prince and his attendants, and waited
there.

The next morning Prince Ahmed went out, as usual, at the iron gate, with
the same attendants as before, and passed by the magician, whom he knew
not to be such, and, seeing her lie with her head against the rock,
and complaining as if she were in great pain, he pitied her, turned his
horse about, went to her, and asked her what was the matter with her,
and what he could do to ease her.

The artful sorceress looked at the Prince in a pitiful manner, without
ever lifting up her head, and answered in broken words and sighs, as
if she could hardly fetch her breath, that she was going to the capital
city, but on the way thither she was taken with so violent a fever that
her strength failed her, and she was forced to lie down where he saw
her, far from any habitation, and without any hopes of assistance.

“Good woman,” replied Prince Ahmed, “you are not so far from help as you
imagine. I am ready to assist you, and convey you where you will meet
with a speedy cure; only get up, and let one of my people take you
behind him.”

At these words the magician, who pretended sickness only to know where
the Prince lived and what he did, refused not the charitable offer he
made her, and that her actions might correspond with her words she made
many pretended vain endeavors to get up. At the same time two of the
Prince’s attendants, alighting off their horses, helped her up, and set
her behind another, and mounted their horses again, and followed the
Prince, who turned back to the iron gate, which was opened by one of his
retinue who rode before. And when he came into the outward court of the
Fairy, without dismounting himself, he sent to tell her he wanted to
speak with her.

The Fairy Paribanou came with all imaginable haste, not knowing what
made Prince Ahmed return so soon, who, not giving her time to ask him
the reason, said: “Princess, I desire you would have compassion on this
good woman,” pointing to the magician, who was held up by two of his
retinue. “I found her in the condition you see her in, and promised her
the assistance she stands in need of, and am persuaded that you, out of
your own goodness, as well as upon my entreaty, will not abandon her.”

The Fairy Paribanou, who had her eyes fixed upon the pretended sick
woman all the time that the Prince was talking to her, ordered two of
her women who followed her to take her from the two men that held her,
and carry her into an apartment of the palace, and take as much care of
her as she would herself.

While the two women executed the Fairy’s commands, she went up to Prince
Ahmed, and, whispering in his ear, said: “Prince, this woman is not so
sick as she pretends to be; and I am very much mistaken if she is not an
impostor, who will be the cause of a great trouble to you. But don’t
be concerned, let what will be devised against you; be persuaded that
I will deliver you out of all the snares that shall be laid for you. Go
and pursue your journey.”

This discourse of the Fairy’s did not in the least frighten Prince
Ahmed. “My Princess,” said he, “as I do not remember I ever did or
designed anybody an injury, I cannot believe anybody can have a thought
of doing me one, but if they have I shall not, nevertheless, forbear
doing good whenever I have an opportunity.” Then he went back to his
father’s palace.

In the meantime the two women carried the magician into a very fine
apartment, richly furnished. First they sat her down upon a sofa, with
her back supported with a cushion of gold brocade, while they made a bed
on the same sofa before her, the quilt of which was finely embroidered
with silk, the sheets of the finest linen, and the coverlet
cloth-of-gold. When they had put her into bed (for the old sorceress
pretended that her fever was so violent she could not help herself in
the least) one of the women went out, and returned soon again with a
china dish in her hand, full of a certain liquor, which she presented to
the magician, while the other helped her to sit up. “Drink this liquor,”
 said she; “it is the Water of the Fountain of Lions, and a sovereign
remedy against all fevers whatsoever. You will find the effect of it in
less than an hour’s time.”

The magician, to dissemble the better, took it after a great deal of
entreaty; but at last she took the china dish, and, holding back her
head, swallowed down the liquor. When she was laid down again the two
women covered her up. “Lie quiet,” said she who brought her the china
cup, “and get a little sleep if you can. We’ll leave you, and hope to
find you perfectly cured when we come again an hour hence.”

The two women came again at the time they said they should, and found
the magician up and dressed, and sitting upon the sofa. “Oh, admirable
potion!” she said: “it has wrought its cure much sooner than you told me
it would, and I shall be able to prosecute my journey.”

The two women, who were fairies as well as their mistress, after they
had told the magician how glad they were that she was cured so soon,
walked before her, and conducted her through several apartments, all
more noble than that wherein she lay, into a large hall, the most richly
and magnificently furnished of all the palace.

Fairy Paribanou sat in this hall on a throne of massive gold, enriched
with diamonds, rubies, and pearls of an extraordinary size, and attended
on each hand by a great number of beautiful fairies, all richly clothed.
At the sight of so much majesty, the magician was not only dazzled, but
was so amazed that, after she had prostrated herself before the throne,
she could not open her lips to thank the Fairy as she proposed. However,
Paribanou saved her the trouble, and said to her: “Good woman, I am glad
I had an opportunity to oblige you, and to see you are able to pursue
your journey. I won’t detain you, but perhaps you may not be displeased
to see my palace; follow my women, and they will show it you.”

Then the magician went back and related to the Sultan of the Indies all
that had happened, and how very rich Prince Ahmed was since his marriage
with the Fairy, richer than all the kings in the world, and how there
was danger that he should come and take the throne from his father.

Though the Sultan of the Indies was very well persuaded that Prince
Ahmed’s natural disposition was good, yet he could not help being
concerned at the discourse of the old sorceress, to whom, when she was
taking her leave, he said: “I thank thee for the pains thou hast taken,
and thy wholesome advice. I am so sensible of the great importance it is
to me that I shall deliberate upon it in council.”

Now the favorites advised that the Prince should be killed, but the
magician advised differently: “Make him give you all kinds of wonderful
things, by the Fairy’s help, till she tires of him and sends him away.
As, for example, every time your Majesty goes into the field, you are
obliged to be at a great expense, not only in pavilions and tents for
your army, but likewise in mules and camels to carry their baggage. Now,
might not you engage him to use his interest with the Fairy to procure
you a tent which might be carried in a man’s hand, and which should be
so large as to shelter your whole army against bad weather?”

When the magician had finished her speech, the Sultan asked his
favorites if they had anything better to propose; and, finding them
all silent, determined to follow the magician’s advice, as the most
reasonable and most agreeable to his mild government.

Next day the Sultan did as the magician had advised him, and asked for
the pavilion.

Prince Ahmed never expected that the Sultan his father would have
asked such a thing, which at first appeared so difficult, not to say
impossible. Though he knew not absolutely how great the power of genies
and fairies was, he doubted whether it extended so far as to compass
such a tent as his father desired. At last he replied: “Though it is
with the greatest reluctance imaginable, I will not fail to ask the
favor of my wife your Majesty desires, but will not promise you to
obtain it; and if I should not have the honor to come again to pay you
my respects that shall be the sign that I have not had success. But
beforehand, I desire you to forgive me, and consider that you yourself
have reduced me to this extremity.”

“Son,” replied the Sultan of the Indies, “I should be very sorry if what
I ask of you should cause me the displeasure of never seeing you more. I
find you don’t know the power a husband has over a wife; and yours would
show that her love to you was very indifferent if she, with the power
she has of a fairy, should refuse you so trifling a request as this I
desire you to ask of her for my sake.” The Prince went back, and was
very sad for fear of offending the Fairy. She kept pressing him to
tell her what was the matter, and at last he said: “Madam, you may have
observed that hitherto I have been content with your love, and have
never asked you any other favor. Consider then, I conjure you, that
it is not I, but the Sultan my father, who indiscreetly, or at least I
think so, begs of you a pavilion large enough to shelter him, his Court,
and army from the violence of the weather, and which a man may carry in
his hand. But remember it is the Sultan my father asks this favor.”

“Prince,” replied the Fairy, smiling, “I am sorry that so small a matter
should disturb you, and make you so uneasy as you appeared to me.”

Then the Fairy sent for her treasurer, to whom, when she came, she said:
“Nourgihan”--which was her name--“bring me the largest pavilion in my
treasury.” Nourgiham returned presently with the pavilion, which she
could not only hold in her hand, but in the palm of her hand when she
shut her fingers, and presented it to her mistress, who gave it to
Prince Ahmed to look at.

When Prince Ahmed saw the pavilion which the Fairy called the largest in
her treasury, he fancied she had a mind to jest with him, and thereupon
the marks of his surprise appeared presently in his countenance; which
Paribanou perceiving burst out laughing. “What! Prince,” cried she, “do
you think I jest with you? You’ll see presently that I am in earnest.
Nourgihan,” said she to her treasurer, taking the tent out of Prince
Ahmed’s hands, “go and set it up, that the Prince may judge whether it
may be large enough for the Sultan his father.”

The treasurer went immediately with it out of the palace, and carried it
a great way off; and when she had set it up one end reached to the very
palace; at which time the Prince, thinking it small, found it large
enough to shelter two greater armies than that of the Sultan his
father’s, and then said to Paribanou: “I ask my Princess a thousand
pardons for my incredulity; after what I have seen I believe there
is nothing impossible to you.” “You see,” said the Fairy, “that the
pavilion is larger than what your father may have occasion for; for
you must know that it has one property--that it is larger or smaller
according to the army it is to cover.”

The treasurer took down the tent again, and brought it to the Prince,
who took it, and, without staying any longer than till the next day,
mounted his horse, and went with the same attendants to the Sultan his
father.

The Sultan, who was persuaded that there could not be any such thing
as such a tent as he asked for, was in a great surprise at the Prince’s
diligence. He took the tent and after he had admired its smallness his
amazement was so great that he could not recover himself. When the tent
was set up in the great plain, which we have before mentioned, he found
it large enough to shelter an army twice as large as he could bring into
the field.

But the Sultan was not yet satisfied. “Son,” said he, “I have already
expressed to you how much I am obliged to you for the present of the
tent you have procured me; that I look upon it as the most valuable
thing in all my treasury. But you must do one thing more for me, which
will be every whit as agreeable to me. I am informed that the Fairy,
your spouse, makes use of a certain water, called the Water of the
Fountain of Lions, which cures all sorts of fevers, even the most
dangerous, and, as I am perfectly well persuaded my health is dear to
you, I don’t doubt but you will ask her for a bottle of that water for
me, and bring it me as a sovereign medicine, which I may make use of
when I have occasion. Do me this other important piece of service, and
thereby complete the duty of a good son toward a tender father.”

The Prince returned and told the Fairy what his father had said;
“There’s a great deal of wickedness in this demand?” she answered, “as
you will understand by what I am going to tell you. The Fountain of
Lions is situated in the middle of a court of a great castle, the
entrance into which is guarded by four fierce lions, two of which sleep
alternately, while the other two are awake. But don’t let that frighten
you: I’ll give you means to pass by them without any danger.”

The Fairy Paribanou was at that time very hard at work, and, as she had
several clews of thread by her, she took up one, and, presenting it
to Prince Ahmed, said: “First take this clew of thread. I’ll tell you
presently the use of it. In the second place, you must have two horses;
one you must ride yourself, and the other you must lead, which must be
loaded with a sheep cut into four quarters, that must be killed to-day.
In the third place, you must be provided with a bottle, which I will
give you, to bring the water in. Set out early to-morrow morning, and
when you have passed the iron gate throw the clew of thread before you,
which will roll till it comes to the gates of the castle. Follow it, and
when it stops, as the gates will be open, you will see the four lions:
the two that are awake will, by their roaring, wake the other two, but
don’t be frightened, but throw each of them a quarter of mutton, and
then clap spurs to your horse and ride to the fountain; fill your bottle
without alighting, and then return with the same expedition. The lions
will be so busy eating they will let you pass by them.”

Prince Ahmed set out the next morning at the time appointed by the
Fairy, and followed her directions exactly. When he arrived at the
gates of the castle he distributed the quarters of mutton among the
four lions, and, passing through the midst of them bravely, got to the
fountain, filled his bottle, and returned back as safe and sound as he
went. When he had gone a little distance from the castle gates he turned
him about, and, perceiving two of the lions coming after him, he drew
his sabre and prepared himself for defense. But as he went forward he
saw one of them turned out of the road at some distance, and showed by
his head and tail that he did not come to do him any harm, but only to
go before him, and that the other stayed behind to follow, he put his
sword up again in its scabbard. Guarded in this manner, he arrived at
the capital of the Indies, but the lions never left him till they had
conducted him to the gates of the Sultan’s palace; after which they
returned the same way they came, though not without frightening all
that saw them, for all they went in a very gentle manner and showed no
fierceness.

A great many officers came to attend the Prince while he dismounted his
horse, and afterward conducted him into the Sultan’s apartment, who was
at that time surrounded with his favorites. He approached toward the
throne, laid the bottle at the Sultan’s feet, and kissed the rich
tapestry which covered his footstool, and then said:

“I have brought you, sir, the healthful water which your Majesty desired
so much to keep among your other rarities in your treasury, but at the
same time wish you such extraordinary health as never to have occasion
to make use of it.”

After the Prince had made an end of his compliment the Sultan placed him
on his right hand, and then said to him: “Son, I am very much obliged
to you for this valuable present, as also for the great danger you have
exposed yourself to upon my account (which I have been informed of by
a magician who knows the Fountain of Lions); but do me the pleasure,”
 continued he, “to inform me by what address, or, rather, by what
incredible power, you have been secured.”

“Sir,” replied Prince Ahmed, “I have no share in the compliment your
Majesty is pleased to make me; all the honor is due to the Fairy my
spouse, whose good advice I followed.” Then he informed the Sultan what
those directions were, and by the relation of this his expedition let
him know how well he had behaved himself. When he had done the Sultan,
who showed outwardly all the demonstrations of great joy, but secretly
became more jealous, retired into an inward apartment, where he sent for
the magician.

The magician, at her arrival, saved the Sultan the trouble to tell her
of the success of Prince Ahmed’s journey, which she had heard of before
she came, and therefore was prepared with an infallible means, as she
pretended. This means she communicated to the Sultan who declared it
the next day to the Prince, in the midst of all his courtiers, in these
words: “Son,” said he, “I have one thing more to ask of you, after which
I shall expect nothing more from your obedience, nor your interest with
your wife. This request is, to bring me a man not above a foot and a
half high, and whose beard is thirty feet long who carries a bar of
iron upon his shoulders of five hundredweight, which he uses as a
quarterstaff.”

Prince Ahmed, who did not believe that there was such a man in the world
as his father described, would gladly have excused himself; but the
Sultan persisted in his demand, and told him the Fairy could do more
incredible things.

The next day the Prince returned to his dear Paribanou, to whom he told
his father’s new demand, which, he said, he looked upon to be a thing
more impossible than the two first; “for,” added he, “I cannot imagine
there can be such a man in the world; without doubt, he has a mind to
try whether or no I am so silly as to go about it, or he has a design on
my ruin. In short, how can he suppose that I should lay hold of a man
so well armed, though he is but little? What arms can I make use of to
reduce him to my will? If there are any means, I beg you will tell them,
and let me come off with honor this time.”

“Don’t affright yourself, Prince,” replied the Fairy; “you ran a risk in
fetching the Water of the Fountain of Lions for your father, but there’s
no danger in finding out this man, who is my brother Schaibar, but is so
far from being like me, though we both had the same father, that he is
of so violent a nature that nothing can prevent his giving cruel marks
of his resentment for a slight offense; yet, on the other hand, is so
good as to oblige anyone in whatever they desire. He is made exactly as
the Sultan your father has described him, and has no other arms than a
bar of iron of five hundred pounds weight, without which he never stirs,
and which makes him respected. I’ll send for him, and you shall judge
of the truth of what I tell you; but be sure to prepare yourself against
being frightened at his extraordinary figure when you see him.” “What!
my Queen,” replied Prince Ahmed, “do you say Schaibar is your brother?
Let him be never so ugly or deformed I shall be so far from being
frightened at the sight of him that, as our brother, I shall honor and
love him.”

The Fairy ordered a gold chafing-dish to be set with a fire in it under
the porch of her palace, with a box of the same metal, which was a
present to her, out of which taking a perfume, and throwing it into the
fire, there arose a thick cloud of smoke.

Some moments after the Fairy said to Prince Ahmed: “See, there comes my
brother.” The Prince immediately perceived Schaibar coming gravely with
his heavy bar on his shoulder, his long beard, which he held up before
him, and a pair of thick mustachios, which he tucked behind his ears and
almost covered his face; his eyes were very small and deep-set in his
head, which was far from being of the smallest size, and on his head he
wore a grenadier’s cap; besides all this, he was very much hump-backed.

If Prince Ahmed had not known that Schaibar was Paribanou’s brother,
he would not have been able to have looked at him without fear, but,
knowing first who he was, he stood by the Fairy without the least
concern.

Schaibar, as he came forward, looked at the Prince earnestly enough to
have chilled his blood in his veins, and asked Paribanou, when he first
accosted her, who that man was. To which she replied: “He is my husband,
brother. His name is Ahmed; he is son to the Sultan of the Indies. The
reason why I did not invite you to my wedding was I was unwilling to
divert you from an expedition you were engaged in, and from which I
heard with pleasure you returned victorious, and so took the liberty now
to call for you.”

At these words, Schaibar, looking on Prince Ahmed favorably, said: “Is
there anything else, sister, wherein I can serve him? It is enough
for me that he is your husband to engage me to do for him whatever he
desires.” “The Sultan, his father,” replied Paribanou, “has a curiosity
to see you, and I desire he may be your guide to the Sultan’s Court.”
 “He needs but lead me the way I’ll follow him.” “Brother,” replied
Paribanou, “it is too late to go to-day, therefore stay till to-morrow
morning; and in the meantime I’ll inform you of all that has passed
between the Sultan of the Indies and Prince Ahmed since our marriage.”

The next morning, after Schaibar had been informed of the affair, he and
Prince Ahmed set out for the Sultan’s Court. When they arrived at the
gates of the capital the people no sooner saw Schaibar but they ran and
hid themselves; and some shut up their shops and locked themselves up in
their houses, while others, flying, communicated their fear to all they
met, who stayed not to look behind them, but ran too; insomuch that
Schaibar and Prince Ahmed, as they went along, found the streets all
desolate till they came to the palaces where the porters, instead
of keeping the gates, ran away too, so that the Prince and Schaibar
advanced without any obstacle to the council-hall, where the Sultan was
seated on his throne, and giving audience. Here likewise the ushers,
at the approach of Schaibar, abandoned their posts, and gave them free
admittance.

Schaibar went boldly and fiercely up to the throne, without waiting to
be presented by Prince Ahmed, and accosted the Sultan of the Indies in
these words: “Thou hast asked for me,” said he; “see, here I am; what
wouldst thou have with me?”

The Sultan, instead of answering him, clapped his hands before his eyes
to avoid the sight of so terrible an object; at which uncivil and rude
reception Schaibar was so much provoked, after he had given him the
trouble to come so far, that he instantly lifted up his iron bar and
killed him before Prince Ahmed could intercede in his behalf. All that
he could do was to prevent his killing the grand vizier, who sat not far
from him, representing to him that he had always given the Sultan his
father good advice. “These are they, then,” said Schaibar, “who gave him
bad,” and as he pronounced these words he killed all the other viziers
and flattering favorites of the Sultan who were Prince Ahmed’s enemies.
Every time he struck he killed some one or other, and none escaped but
they who were not so frightened as to stand staring and gaping, and who
saved themselves by flight.

When this terrible execution was over Schaibar came out of the
council-hall into the midst of the courtyard with the iron bar upon his
shoulder, and, looking hard at the grand vizier, who owed his life to
Prince Ahmed, he said: “I know here is a certain magician, who is a
greater enemy of my brother-in-law than all these base favorites I
have chastised. Let the magician be brought to me presently.” The grand
vizier immediately sent for her, and as soon as she was brought Schaibar
said, at the time he fetched a stroke at her with his iron bar: “Take
the reward of thy pernicious counsel, and learn to feign sickness
again.”

After this he said: “This is not yet enough; I will use the whole town
after the same manner if they do not immediately acknowledge Prince
Ahmed, my brother-in-law, for their Sultan and the Sultan of the
Indies.” Then all that were there present made the air echo again
with the repeated acclamations of: “Long life to Sultan Ahmed”; and
immediately after he was proclaimed through the whole town. Schaibar
made him be clothed in the royal vestments, installed him on the throne,
and after he had caused all to swear homage and fidelity to him went
and fetched his sister Paribanou, whom he brought with all the pomp and
grandeur imaginable, and made her to be owned Sultaness of the Indies.

As for Prince Ali and Princess Nouronnihar, as they had no hand in the
conspiracy against Prince Ahmed and knew nothing of any, Prince Ahmed
assigned them a considerable province, with its capital, where they
spent the rest of their lives. Afterwards he sent an officer to Prince
Houssain to acquaint him with the change and make him an offer of which
province he liked best; but that Prince thought himself so happy in his
solitude that he bade the officer return the Sultan his brother thanks
for the kindness he designed him, assuring him of his submission; and
that the only favor he desired of him was to give him leave to live
retired in the place he had made choice of for his retreat.



In the reign of the famous King Arthur there lived in Cornwall a lad
named Jack, who was a boy of a bold temper, and took delight in hearing
or reading of conjurers, giants, and fairies; and used to listen eagerly
to the deeds of the knights of King Arthur’s Round Table.

In those days there lived on St. Michael’s Mount, off Cornwall, a huge
giant, eighteen feet high and nine feet round; his fierce and savage
looks were the terror of all who beheld him.

He dwelt in a gloomy cavern on the top of the mountain, and used to wade
over to the mainland in search of prey; when he would throw half a dozen
oxen upon his back, and tie three times as many sheep and hogs round his
waist, and march back to his own abode.

The giant had done this for many years when Jack resolved to destroy
him.

Jack took a horn, a shovel, a pickaxe, his armor, and a dark lantern,
and one winter’s evening he went to the mount. There he dug a pit
twenty-two feet deep and twenty broad. He covered the top over so as to
make it look like solid ground. He then blew his horn so loudly that the
giant awoke and came out of his den crying out: “You saucy villain! you
shall pay for this I’ll broil you for my breakfast!”

He had just finished, when, taking one step further, he tumbled headlong
into the pit, and Jack struck him a blow on the head with his pickaxe
which killed him. Jack then returned home to cheer his friends with the
news.

Another giant, called Blunderbore, vowed to be revenged on Jack if ever
he should have him in his power. This giant kept an enchanted castle in
the midst of a lonely wood; and some time after the death of Cormoran
Jack was passing through a wood, and being weary, sat down and went to
sleep.

The giant, passing by and seeing Jack, carried him to his castle, where
he locked him up in a large room, the floor of which was covered with
the bodies, skulls and bones of men and women.

Soon after the giant went to fetch his brother who was likewise a giant,
to take a meal off his flesh; and Jack saw with terror through the bars
of his prison the two giants approaching.

Jack, perceiving in one corner of the room a strong cord, took courage,
and making a slip-knot at each end, he threw them over their heads, and
tied it to the window-bars; he then pulled till he had choked them. When
they were black in the face he slid down the rope and stabbed them to
the heart.

Jack next took a great bunch of keys from the pocket of Blunderbore,
and went into the castle again. He made a strict search through all
the rooms, and in one of them found three ladies tied up by the hair
of their heads, and almost starved to death. They told him that their
husbands had been killed by the giants, who had then condemned them to
be starved to death because they would not eat the flesh of their own
dead husbands.

“Ladies,” said Jack, “I have put an end to the monster and his wicked
brother; and I give you this castle and all the riches it contains, to
make some amends for the dreadful pains you have felt.” He then very
politely gave them the keys of the castle, and went further on his
journey to Wales.

As Jack had but little money, he went on as fast as possible. At length
he came to a handsome house. Jack knocked at the door, when there came
forth a Welsh giant. Jack said he was a traveler who had lost his way,
on which the giant made him welcome, and let him into a room where there
was a good bed to sleep in.

Jack took off his clothes quickly, but though he was weary he could not
go to sleep. Soon after this he heard the giant walking backward and
forward in the next room, and saying to himself:

  “Though here you lodge with me this night,
  You shall not see the morning light;
  My club shall dash your brains out quite.”


“Say you so?” thought Jack. “Are these your tricks upon travelers? But
I hope to prove as cunning as you are.” Then, getting out of bed, he
groped about the room, and at last found a large thick billet of wood.
He laid it in his own place in the bed, and then hid himself in a dark
corner of the room.

The giant, about midnight, entered the apartment, and with his bludgeon
struck many blows on the bed, in the very place where Jack had laid the
log; and then he went back to his own room, thinking he had broken all
Jack’s bones.

Early in the morning Jack put a bold face upon the matter, and walked
into the giant’s room to thank him for his lodging. The giant started
when he saw him, and began to stammer out: “Oh! dear me; is it you? Pray
how did you sleep last night? Did you hear or see anything in the dead
of the night?”

“Nothing to speak of,” said Jack, carelessly; “a rat, I believe, gave me
three or four slaps with its tail, and disturbed me a little; but I soon
went to sleep again.”

The giant wondered more and more at this; yet he did not answer a word,
but went to bring two great bowls of hasty-pudding for their breakfast.
Jack wanted to make the giant believe that he could eat as much as
himself, so he contrived to button a leathern bag inside his coat, and
slip the hasty-pudding into this bag, while he seemed to put it into his
mouth.

When breakfast was over he said to the giant: “Now I will show you a
fine trick. I can cure all wounds with a touch; I could cut off my head
in one minute, and the next put it sound again on my shoulders. You
shall see an example.” He then took hold of the knife, ripped up the
leathern bag, and all the hasty-pudding tumbled out upon the floor.

“Ods splutter hur nails!” cried the Welsh giant, who was ashamed to be
outdone by such a little fellow as Jack, “hur can do that hurself”;
so he snatched up the knife, plunged it into his own stomach, and in a
moment dropped down dead.

Jack, having hitherto been successful in all his undertakings, resolved
not to be idle in future; he therefore furnished himself with a horse,
a cap of knowledge, a sword of sharpness, shoes of swiftness, and an
invisible coat, the better to perform the wonderful enterprises that lay
before him.

He traveled over high hills, and on the third day he came to a large and
spacious forest through which his road lay. Scarcely had he entered the
forest when he beheld a monstrous giant dragging along by the hair
of their heads a handsome knight and his lady. Jack alighted from his
horse, and tying him to an oak tree, put on his invisible coat, under
which he carried his sword of sharpness.

When he came up to the giant he made several strokes at him, but could
not reach his body, but wounded his thighs in several places; and at
length, putting both hands to his sword and aiming with all his might,
he cut off both his legs. Then Jack, setting his foot upon his neck,
plunged his sword into the giant’s body, when the monster gave a groan
and expired.

The knight and his lady thanked Jack for their deliverance, and invited
him to their house, to receive a proper reward for his services. “No,”
 said Jack, “I cannot be easy till I find out this monster’s habitation.”
 So, taking the knight’s directions, he mounted his horse and soon after
came in sight of another giant, who was sitting on a block of timber
waiting for his brother’s return.

Jack alighted from his horse, and, putting on his invisible coat,
approached and aimed a blow at the giant’s head, but, missing his aim,
he only cut off his nose. On this the giant seized his club and laid
about him most unmercifully.

“Nay,” said Jack, “if this be the case I’d better dispatch you!” so,
jumping upon the block, he stabbed him in the back, when he dropped down
dead.

Jack then proceeded on his journey, and traveled over hills and dales,
till arriving at the foot of a high mountain he knocked at the door of a
lonely house, when an old man let him in.

When Jack was seated the hermit thus addressed him: “My son, on the top
of this mountain is an enchanted castle, kept by the giant Galligantus
and a vile magician. I lament the fate of a duke’s daughter, whom they
seized as she was walking in her father’s garden, and brought hither
transformed into a deer.”

Jack promised that in the morning, at the risk of his life, he would
break the enchantment; and after a sound sleep he rose early, put on his
invisible coat, and got ready for the attempt.

When he had climbed to the top of the mountain he saw two fiery
griffins, but he passed between them without the least fear of danger,
for they could not see him because of his invisible coat. On the castle
gate he found a golden trumpet, under which were written these lines:

  “Whoever can this trumpet blow
  Shall cause the giant’s overthrow.”


As soon as Jack had read this he seized the trumpet and blew a shrill
blast, which made the gates fly open and the very castle itself tremble.

The giant and the conjurer now knew that their wicked course was at an
end, and they stood biting their thumbs and shaking with fear. Jack,
with his sword of sharpness, soon killed the giant, and the magician was
then carried away by a whirlwind; and every knight and beautiful lady
who had been changed into birds and beasts returned to their proper
shapes. The castle vanished away like smoke, and the head of the giant
Galligantus was then sent to King Arthur.

The knights and ladies rested that night at the old man’s hermitage, and
next day they set out for the Court. Jack then went up to the King, and
gave his Majesty an account of all his fierce battles.

Jack’s fame had now spread through the whole country, and at the King’s
desire the duke gave him his daughter in marriage, to the joy of all his
kingdom. After this the King gave him a large estate, on which he and
his lady lived the rest of their days in joy and contentment.



     And many a hunting song they sung,
       And song of game and glee;
     Then tuned to plaintive strains their tongue,
       “Of Scotland’s luve and lee.”
      To wilder measures next they turn
       “The Black, Black Bull of Norroway!”
      Sudden the tapers cease to burn,
       The minstrels cease to play.


In Norroway, langsyne, there lived a certain lady, and she had three
dochters. The auldest o’ them said to her mither: “Mither, bake me a
bannock, and roast me a collop, for I’m gaun awa’ to seek my fortune.”
 Her mither did sae; and the dochter gaed awa’ to an auld witch
washerwife and telled her purpose. The auld wife bade her stay that day,
and gang and look out o’ her back door, and see what she could see. She
saw nocht the first day. The second day she did the same, and saw nocht.
On the third day she looked again, and saw a coach-and-six coming along
the road. She ran in and telled the auld wife what she saw. “Aweel,”
 quo’ the auld wife, “yon’s for you.” Sae they took her into the coach,
and galloped aff.

The second dochter next says to her mither: “Mither, bake me a bannock,
and roast me a collop, fur I’m gaun awa’ to seek my fortune.” Her mither
did sae; and awa’ she gaed to the auld wife, as her sister had dune. On
the third day she looked out o’ the back door, and saw a coach-and-four
coming along the road. “Aweel,” quo’ the auld wife, “yon’s for you.” Sae
they took her in, and aff they set.

The third dochter says to her mither: “Mither, bake me a bannock, and
roast me a collop, for I’m gaun awa’ to seek my fortune.” Her mither did
sae; and awa’ she gaed to the auld witch-wife. She bade her look out
o’ her back door, and see what she could see. She did sae; and when she
came back said she saw nocht. The second day she did the same, and saw
nocht. The third day she looked again, and on coming back said to the
auld wife she saw nocht but a muckle Black Bull coming roaring alang the
road. “Aweel,” quo’ the auld wife, “yon’s for you.” On hearing this she
was next to distracted wi’ grief and terror; but she was lifted up and
set on his back, and awa’ they went.

Aye they traveled, and on they traveled, till the lady grew faint wi’
hunger. “Eat out o’ my right lug,” says the Black Bull, “and drink out
o’ my left lug, and set by your leavings.” Sae she did as he said, and
was wonderfully refreshed. And lang they gaed, and sair they rade, till
they came in sight o’ a very big and bonny castle. “Yonder we maun be
this night,” quo’ the bull; “for my auld brither lives yonder”; and
presently they were at the place. They lifted her aff his back, and took
her in, and sent him away to a park for the night. In the morning,
when they brought the bull hame, they took the lady into a fine shining
parlor, and gave her a beautiful apple, telling her no to break it till
she was in the greatest strait ever mortal was in in the world, and that
wad bring her o’t. Again she was lifted on the bull’s back, and after
she had ridden far, and farer than I can tell, they came in sight o’ a
far bonnier castle, and far farther awa’ than the last. Says the bull
till her: “Yonder we maun be the night, for my second brither lives
yonder”; and they were at the place directly. They lifted her down
and took her in, and sent the bull to the field for the night. In the
morning they took the lady into a fine and rich room, and gave her the
finest pear she had ever seen, bidding her no to break it till she was
in the greatest strait ever mortal could be in, and that wad get her out
o’t. Again she was lifted and set on his back, and awa’ they went. And
lang they gaed, and sair they rade, till they came in sight o’ the far
biggest castle, and far farthest aff, they had yet seen. “We maun be
yonder the night,” says the bull, “for my young brither lives yonder”;
and they were there directly. They lifted her down, took her in, and
sent the bull to the field for the night. In the morning they took her
into a room, the finest of a’, and gied her a plum, telling her no to
break it till she was in the greatest strait mortal could be in, and
that wad get her out o’t. Presently they brought hame the bull, set the
lady on his back, and awa’ they went.

And aye they gaed, and on they rade, till they came to a dark and ugsome
glen, where they stopped, and the lady lighted down. Says the bull to
her: “Here ye maun stay till I gang and fight the deil. Ye maun seat
yoursel’ on that stane, and move neither hand nor fit till I come back,
else I’ll never find ye again. And if everything round about ye turns
blue I hae beated the deil; but should a’ things turn red he’ll hae
conquered me.” She set hersel’ down on the stane, and by-and-by a’ round
her turned blue. O’ercome wi’ joy, she lifted the ae fit and crossed it
owre the ither, sae glad was she that her companion was victorious. The
bull returned and sought for but never could find her.

Lang she sat, and aye she grat, till she wearied. At last she rase and
gaed awa’, she kedna whaur till. On she wandered till she came to a
great hill o’ glass, that she tried a’ she could to climb, bat wasna
able. Round the bottom o’ the hill she gaed, sabbing and seeking a
passage owre, till at last she came to a smith’s house; and the smith
promised, if she wad serve him seven years, he wad make her iron shoon,
wherewi’ she could climb owre the glassy hill. At seven years’ end she
got her iron shoon, clamb the glassy hill, and chanced to come to the
auld washerwife’s habitation. There she was telled of a gallant young
knight that had given in some bluidy sarks to wash, and whaever washed
thae sarks was to be his wife. The auld wife had washed till she was
tired, and then she set to her dochter, and baith washed, and they
washed, and they better washed, in hopes of getting the young knight;
but a’ they could do they couldna bring out a stain. At length they set
the stranger damosel to wark; and whenever she began the stains came
out pure and clean, but the auld wife made the knight believe it was her
dochter had washed the sarks. So the knight and the eldest dochter were
to be married, and the stranger damosel was distracted at the thought
of it, for she was deeply in love wi’ him. So she bethought her of her
apple, and breaking it, found it filled with gold and precious jewelry,
the richest she had ever seen. “All these,” she said to the eldest
dochter, “I will give you, on condition that you put off your marriage
for ae day, and allow me to go into his room alone at night.” So
the lady consented; but meanwhile the auld wife had prepared a
sleeping-drink, and given it to the knight, wha drank it, and never
wakened till next morning. The lee-lang night ther damosel sabbed and
sang:

  “Seven lang years I served for thee,
  The glassy hill I clamb for thee,
  The bluidy shirt I wrang for thee;
  And wilt thou no wauken and turn to me?”


Next day she kentna what to do for grief. She then brak the pear, and
found it filled wi’ jewelry far richer than the contents o’ the apple.
Wi’ thae jewels she bargained for permission to be a second night in
the young knight’s chamber; but the auld wife gied him anither
sleeping-drink, and he again sleepit till morning. A’ night she kept
sighing and singing as before:

“Seven lang years I served for thee,” &c. Still he sleepit, and she
nearly lost hope a’thegither. But that day when he was out at the
hunting, somebody asked him what noise and moaning was yon they heard
all last night in his bedchamber. He said he heardna ony noise. But they
assured him there was sae; and he resolved to keep waking that night
to try what he could hear. That being the third night, and the damosel
being between hope and despair, she brak her plum, and it held far the
richest jewelry of the three. She bargained as before; and the auld
wife, as before, took in the sleeping-drink to the young knight’s
chamber; but he telled her he couldna drink it that night without
sweetening. And when she gaed awa’ for some honey to sweeten it wi’, he
poured out the drink, and sae made the auld wife think he had drunk it.
They a’ went to bed again, and the damosel began, as before, singing:

  “Seven lang years I served for thee,
  The glassy hill I clamb for thee,
  The bluidy shirt I wrang for thee;
  And wilt thou no wauken and turn to me?”

He heard, and turned to her. And she telled him a’ that had befa’en her,
and he telled her a’ that had happened to him. And he caused the auld
washerwife and her dochter to be burned. And they were married, and he
and she are living happy till this day, for aught I ken.


There were ance twa widows that lived on a small bit o’ ground, which
they rented from a farmer. Ane of them had twa sons, and the other had
ane; and by-and-by it was time for the wife that had twa sons to send
them away to seeke their fortune. So she told her eldest son ae day to
take a can and bring her water from the well, that she might bake a cake
for him; and however much or however little water he might bring, the
cake would be great or sma’ accordingly; and that cake was to be a’ that
she could gie him when he went on his travels.

The lad gaed away wi’ the can to the well, and filled it wi’ water, and
then came away hame again; but the can being broken the maist part of
the water had run out before he got back. So his cake was very sma’; yet
sma’ as it was, his mother asked if he was willing to take the half of
it with her blessing, telling him that, if he chose rather to have the
hale, he would only get it wi’ her curse. The young man, thinking he
might hae to travel a far way, and not knowing when or how he might get
other provisions, said he would like to hae the hale cake, com of his
mother’s malison what like; so she gave him the hale cake, and her
malison alang wi’t. Then he took his brither aside, and gave him a
knife to keep till he should come back, desiring him to look at it every
morning, and as lang as it continued to be clear, then he might be sure
that the owner of it was well; but if it grew dim and rusty, then for
certain some ill had befallen him.

So the young man set out to seek his fortune. And he gaed a’ that day,
and a’ the next day; and on the third day, in the afternoon, he came up
to where a shepherd was sitting with a flock o’ sheep. And he gaed up
to the shepherd and asked him wha the sheep belanged to; and the man
answered:


     “The Red Etin of Ireland
       Ance lived in Bellygan,
     And stole King Malcolm’s daughter,
       The King of fair Scotland.
     He beats her, he binds her,
       He lays her on a band;
     And every day he dings her
       With a bright silver wand
     Like Julian the Roman
     He’s one that fears no man.
     It’s said there’s ane predestinate
       To be his mortal foe;
     But that man is yet unborn
       And lang may it be so.”

The young man then went on his journey; and he had not gone far when he
espied an old man with white locks herding a flock of swine; and he gaed
up to him and asked whose swine these were, when the man answered:

     “The Red Etin of Ireland”--
          

Then the young man gaed on a bit farther, and came to another very old
man herding goats; and when he asked whose goats they were, the answer
was:

     “The Red Etin of Ireland”--


This old man also told him to beware of the next beasts that he should
meet, for they were of a very different kind from any he had yet seen.

So the young man went on, and by-and-by he saw a multitude of very
dreadfu’ beasts, ilk ane o’ them wi’ twa heads, and on every head four
horns. And he was sore frightened, and ran away from them as fast as he
could; and glad was he when he came to a castle that stood on a hillock,
wi’ the door standing wide to the wa’. And he gaed into the castle for
shelter, and there he saw an auld wife sitting beside the kitchen fire.
He asked the wife if he might stay there for the night, as he was tired
wi’ a lang journey; and the wife said he might, but it was not a good
place for him to be in, as it belanged to the Red Etin, who was a very
terrible beast, wi’ three heads, that spared no living man he could get
hold of. The young man would have gone away, but he was afraid of the
beasts on the outside of the castle; so he beseeched the old woman to
conceal him as well as she could, and not to tell the Etin that he was
there. He thought, if he could put over the night, he might get away in
the morning without meeting wi’ the beasts, and so escape. But he had
not been long in his hidy-hole before the awful Etin came in; and nae
sooner was he in than he was heard crying:

  “Snouk but and snouk ben,
  I find the smell of an earthly man;
  Be he living, or be he dead,
  His heart this night shall kitchen my bread.”




The monster soon found the poor young man, and pulled him from his hole.
And when he had got him out he told him that if he could answer him
three questions his life should be spared. The first was: Whether
Ireland or Scotland was first inhabited? The second was: Whether man was
made for woman, or woman for man? The third was: Whether men or
brutes were made first? The lad not being able to answer one of these
questions, the Red Etin took a mace and knocked him on the head, and
turned him into a pillar of stone.

On the morning after this happened the younger brither took out the
knife to look at it, and he was grieved to find it a’ brown wi’ rust. He
told his mother that the time was now come for him to go away upon
his travels also; so she requested him to take the can to the well for
water, that she might bake a cake for him. The can being broken, he
brought hame as little water as the other had done, and the cake was as
little. She asked whether he would have the hale cake wi’ her malison,
or the half wi’ her blessing; and, like his brither, he thought it best
to have the hale cake, come o’ the malison what might. So he gaed away;
and everything happened to him that had happened to his brother!

The other widow and her son heard of a’ that had happened frae a fairy,
and the young man determined that he would also go upon his travels, and
see if he could do anything to relieve his twa friends. So his mother
gave him a can to go to the well and bring home water, that she might
bake him a cake for his journey. And he gaed, and as he was bringing
hame the water, a raven owre abune his head cried to him to look, and
he would see that the water was running out. And he was a young man of
sense, and seeing the water running out, he took some clay and patched
up the holes, so that he brought home enough water to bake a large cake.
When his mother put it to him to take the half-cake wi’ her blessing,
he took it in preference to having the hale wi’ her malison; and yet the
half was bigger than what the other lads had got a’thegither.

So he gaed away on his journey; and after he had traveled a far way he
met wi’ an auld woman, that asked him if he would give her a bit of his
bannock. And he said he would gladly do that, and so he gave her a piece
of the bannock; and for that she gied him a magical wand, that she said
might yet be of service to him if he took care to use it rightly. Then
the auld woman, who was a fairy, told him a great deal that whould
happen to him, and what he ought to do in a’ circumstances; and after
that she vanished in an instant out o’ his sight. He gaed on a great way
farther, and then he came up to the old man herding the sheep; and when
he asked whose sheep these were, the answer was:

      “The Red Etin of Ireland
        Ance lived in Bellygan,
      And stole King Malcolm’s daughter,
        The King of fair Scotland.
      He beats her, he binds her,
        He lays her on a band;
      And every day he dings her
        With a bright silver wand.
      Like Julian the Roman,
      He’s one that fears no man,
      But now I fear his end is near,
        And destiny at hand;
      And you’re to be, I plainly see,
        The heir of all his land.”

(Repeat the same inquiries to the man attending the swine and the man
attending the goats, with the same answer in each case.)


When he came to the place where the monstrous beasts were standing, he
did not stop nor run away, but went boldly through among them. One came
up roaring with open mouth to devour him, when he struck it with his
wand, and laid it in an instant dead at his feet. He soon came to the
Etin’s castle, where he knocked, and was admitted. The auld woman that
sat by the fire warned him of the terrible Etin, and what had been the
fate of the twa brithers; but he was not to be daunted. The monster soon
came in, saying:

  “Snouk but and snouk ben,
  I find the smell of an earthly man;
  Be he living, or be he dead,
  His heart shall be kitchen to my bread.”

He quickly espied the young man, and bade him come forth on the floor.
And then he put the three questions to him, but the young man had been
told everything by the good fairy, so he was able to answer all the
questions. When the Etin found this he knew that his power was gone. The
young man then took up the axe and hewed off the monster’s three heads.
He next asked the old woman to show him where the King’s daughters lay;
and the old woman took him upstairs and opened a great many doors, and
out of every door came a beautiful lady who had been imprisoned there by
the Etin; and ane o’ the ladies was the King’s daughter. She also took
him down into a low room, and there stood two stone pillars that he had
only to touch wi’ his wand, when his two friends and neighbors started
into life. And the hale o’ the prisoners were overjoyed at their
deliverance, which they all acknowledged to be owing to the prudent
young man. Next day they a’ set out for the King’s Court, and a gallant
company they made. And the King married his daughter to the young man
that had delivered her, and gave a noble’s daughter to ilk ane o’ the
other young men; and so they a’ lived happily a’ the rest o’ their
days.
