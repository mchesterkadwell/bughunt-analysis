With big tin trumpet and little red drum. 
Marching like soldiers, the children come! 

It 's this way and that way they circle and file — 

My I but that music of theirs is fine / 
This way and that way, and after a while 
They march straight into this heart of mine! 
A sturdy old heart, but it has to succumb 
To the blare of that t7'timpet and beat of that drum / 

Come on, little people, from cot and from hall — 
This heart it hath welcome and room for you all! 
It will sing you its songs and warm you with love. 
As your dear little arms with my ar?7is intertwine ; 
It will rock you away to the dreamland above — 
Oh, a jolly old heart is this old heart of mine. 
And jollier still is it bound to become 
When you blow that big trumpet and beat that red drum ! 

So come ; thougJi I see not his dear little face 

And hear not his voice in this jubilant place, 

I knoiv he were happy to bid me enshrine 

His memory deep in my heart with your play — 
Ah me! but a love that is sweeter t/ian mine 
Holdeth my boy iit its keeping to-day ! 
And my Jieart it is lonely — so, little folk, come, 
MarcJi in and tnake merry wit/i trumpet and drum!

HAVE you ever heard of the Sugar-Plum Tree? 
'Tis a marvel of great renown! 
It blooms on the shore of the Lollipop sea 

In the garden of Shut-Eye Town; 
The fruit that it bears is so wondrously sweet 

(As those who have tasted it say) 
That good little children have only to eat 
Of that fruit to be happy next day. 

When you 've got to the tree, you would have 
a hard time 

To capture the fruit which I sing; 
The tree is so tall that no person could climb 

To the boughs where the sugar-plums swing ! 




But up in that tree sits a chocolate cat, 
And a gingerbread dog prowls below — 

And this is the way you contrive to get at 
Those sugar-plums tempting you so: 



Vou say but the word to that gingerbread dog 

And he barks with such terrible zest 
That the chocolate cat is at once all agog, 

As her swelling proportions attest. 
And the chocolate cat goes cavorting around 

From this leafy limb unto that, 
And the sugar-plums tumble, of course, to the 
ground — 

Hurrah for that chocolate cat! 



There are marshmallows, gumdrops, and pep- 
permint canes, 

With stripings of scarlet or gold. 
And you carry away of the treasure that rains 

As much as your apron can hold! 



So come, little child, cuddle closer to me 
In your dainty white nightcap and gown. 

And I '11 rock you away to that Sugar-Plum 
Tree 
In the garden of Shut-Eye Town. 



KRiNKEN was a little child, — 
It was summer when he smiled 
Oft the hoary sea and grim 
Stretched its white arms out to him, 
Calling, " Sun-child, come to me ; 
Let me warm my heart with thee i " 
But the child heard not the sea. 

Krinken on the beach one day 

Saw a maiden Nis at play; 

Fair, and very fair, was she. 

Just a little child was he. 
" Krinken," said the maiden Nis, 
" Let me have a little kiss,— - 

Just a kiss, and go with me 

To the summer-lands that be 

Down within the silver sea." 



Krinken was a little child, 
By the maiden Nis beguiled; 
Down into the calling sea 
With the maiden Nis went he. 

But the sea calls out no more; 
It is winter on the shore, — 
Winter where that little child 
Made sweet summer when he smiled 
Though 't is summer on the sea 
Where with maiden Nis went he, — 
Summer, summer evermore, — 
It is winter on the shore, 
Winter, winter evermore. 

Of the summer on the deep 
Come sweet visions in my sleep; 
His fair face lifts from the sea, 
His dear voice calls out to me, — 
These my dreams of summer be. 

Krinken was a little child, 
By the maiden Nis beguiled; 




Oft the hoary sea and grim 
Reached its longing arms to him, 
Crying, "Sun-child, come to me; 
Let me warm my heart with thee ! " 
But the sea calls out no more; 
It is winter on the shore, — 
Winter, cold and dark and wild; 
Krinken was a little child, — 
It was summer when he smiled; 
Down he went into the sea. 
And the winter bides with me. 
Just a little child was he. 



MY dolly is a dreadful care, — 
Her name is Miss Amandy; 
I dress her up and curl her hair, 

And feed her taffy candy. 
Yet heedless of the pleading voice 

Of her devoted mother, 
She will not wed her mother's choice. 
But says she '11 wed another. 

I 'd have her wed the china vase, — 

There is no Dresden rarer; 
You might go searching every place 

And never find a fairer. 
He is a gentle, pinkish youth, — 

Of that there 's no denying; 
Yet when I speak of him, forsooth, 

Amandy falls to crying! 



She loves the drum — that's very plain — 

And scorns the vase so clever ; 
And weeping, vows she will remain 

A spinster doll forever ! 
The protestations of the drum 

I am convinced are hollow; 
When once distressing times should come, 

How soon would ruin follow ! 

Yet all in vain the Dresden boy 

From yonder mantel woos her; 
A mania for that vulgar toy. 

The noisy drum, imbues her! 
In vain I wheel her to and fro, 

And reason with her mildly, — 
Her waxen tears in torrents flow, 

Her sawdust heart beats wildly. 

I 'm sure that when I 'm big and tall, 
And wear long trailing dresses, 

I sha'n't encourage beaux at all 
Till mama acquiesces; 




Our choice will be a suitor then 
As pretty as this vase is,— 

Oh, how we '11 hate the noisy men 
With whiskers on their faces! 



THE mill goes toiling slowly around 
With steady and solemn creak, 
And my little one hears in the kindly sound 

The voice of the old mill speak. 
While round and round those big white wings 

Grimly and ghosthke creep, 
My little one hears that the old mill sings: 
"Sleep, little tulip, sleep!" 

The sails are reefed and the nets are drawn, 

And, over his pot of beer, 
The fisher, against the morrow's dawn. 

Lustily maketh cheer; 
He mocks at the winds that caper along 

From the far-off clamorous deep — 
But we — we love their lullaby song 

Of " Sleep, little tulip, sleep ! " 



Old dog Fritz in slumber sound 

Groans of the stony mart — 
To-morrow how proudly he '11 trot you round, 

Hitched to our new milk-cart! 
And you shall help me blanket the kine 

And fold the gentle sheep 
And set the herring a-soak in brine — 

But now, little tulip, sleep ! 

A Dream- One comes to button the eyes 
That wearily droop and blink, 

While the old mill buffets the frowning skies 
And scolds at the stars that wink; 

Over your face the misty wings 

Of that beautiful Dream-One sweep, 

And rocking your cradle she softly sings ^ 
'^ Sleep, little tulip, sleep!" 


WILLIE and Bess, Georgie and May — 
Once, as these children were hard at play, 
An old man, hoary and tottering, came 
And watched them playing their pretty game. 
He seemed to wonder, while standing there, 

What the meaning thereof could be — 
Aha, but the old man yearned to share 
Of the little children's innocent glee 
As they circled around with laugh and shout 
And told their rime at counting out: 
" Intry-mintry, cutrey-corn, 
Apple-seed and apple-thorn; 
Wire, brier, limber, lock, 
Twelve geese in a flock; 
Some flew east, some flew west, 
Some flew over the cuckoo's nest ! " 



Willie and Bess, Georgie and May — 
Ah, the mirth of that summer-day ! 
'T was Fa,ther Time who had come to share 
The innocent joy of those children there; 
He learned betimes the game they played 

And into their sport with them went he — 
How could the children have been afraid, 

Since Httle they recked whom he might be ? 
They laughed to hear old Father Time 
Mumbling that curious nonsense rime 

Of " Intry-mintry, cutrey-com, 

Apple-seed and apple-thorn; 

Wire, brier, limber, lock. 

Twelve geese in a flock; 

Some flew east, some flew west. 

Some flew over the cuckoo's nest!" 



Willie and Bess, Georgie and May, 
And joy of summer — where are they? 
The grim old man still standeth near 
Crooning the song of a far-ofl" year ; 


And into the winter I come alone, 

Cheered by that mournful requiem, 
Soothed by the dolorous monotone 

That shall count me off as it counted 
them — 
The solemn voice of old Father Time 
Chanting the homely nursery rime 

He learned of the children a summer mom 
When, with " apple-seed and apple-thorn," 
Life was full of the dulcet cheer 
That bringeth the grace of heaven anear — 
The sound of the little ones hard at play- 
Willie and Bess, Georgie and May. 




ALL day long they come and go — 
Pittypat and Tippytoe; 
Footprints up and down the hall, 

Playthings scattered on the iioor, 
Finger-marks along the wall, 
Tell-tale smudges on the door — 
By these presents you shall know 
Pittypat and Tippytoe. 

How they riot at their play! 
And a dozen times a day 

In they troop, demanding bread — 

Only buttered bread will do. 
And that butter must be spread 
Inches thick with sugar too! 
And I never can say " No, 
Pittypat and Tippytoe!" 



Sometimes there are griefs to soothe, 
Sometimes ruffled brows to smooth; 
For (I much regret to say) 

Tippytoe and Pittypat 
Sometimes interrupt their play 
With an internecine spat; 
Fie, for shame! to quarrel so — 
Pittypat and Tippytoe! 

Oh the thousand worrying things 
Every day recurrent brings! 

Hands to scrub and hair to brushy 
Search for playthings gone amiss. 
Many a wee complaint to hush, 
Many a little bump to kiss; 
Life seems one vain, fleeting show 
To Pittypat and Tippytoe! 

And when day is at an end, 
There are little duds to mend: 
Little frocks are strangely torn, 

Little shoes great holes reveal, 
Little hose, but one day worn, 
Rudely yawn at toe and heel! 



Who but you could work such woe, 
Pittypat and Tippytoe? 

But when comes this thought to me; 
"Some there are that childless be," 
Stealing to their little beds. 

With a love I cannot speak. 
Tenderly I stroke their heads — 
Fondly kiss each velvet cheek. 
God help those who do not know 
A Pittypat or Tippytoe! 

On the floor and down the hall, 

Rudely smutched upon the wall. 

There are proofs in every kind 

Of the havoc they have wrought, 
And upon my heart you 'd find 

Just such trade-marks, if you sought; 
Oh, how glad I am 't is so, 
Pittypat and Tippytoe! 



HUSH, bonnie, dinna greit; 
Moder will rocke her sweete,- 
Balow, my boy ! 
When that his toile ben done, 
Daddie will come anone, — 
Hush thee, my lyttel one; 
Balow, my boy). 

Gin thou dost sleepe, perchaunce 
Fayries will come to daunce, — 

Balow, my boy! 
Oft hath thy moder scene 
Moonlight and mirkland queene 
Daunce on thy slumbering een, — 

Balow, my boy! 



Then droned a bomblebee 
Saftly this songe to thee: 
"Balow, my boy!" 

And a wee heather bell, 
Pluckt from a fayry dell, 
Chimed thee this rune hersell: 
" Balow, my boy ! " 

Soe, bonnie, dinna greit; 
Moder doth rock her sweete,- 

Balow, my boy! 
Give mee thy lyttel hand, 
Moder will hold it and 
Lead thee to balow land,—* 

Balow, my boy! 




THE Hawthorne children — seven in all- 
Are famous friends of mine, 
And with what pleasure I recall 
How, years ago, one gloomy fall, 
I took a tedious railway line 
And journeyed by slow stages down 
Unto that sleepy seaport town 
(Albeit one worth seeing). 
Where Hildegarde, John, Henry, Fred, 
And Beatrix and Gwendolen 
And she that was the baby then — 
These famous seven, as aforesaid, 
Lived, moved, and had their being. 

The Hawthorne children gave me such 

A welcome by the sea, 
That the eight of us were soon in touch. 
And though their mother marveled much, 

Happy as larks were we I 



Egad I was a boy again 
With Henry, John, and Gwendolen ! 
And, oh ! the funny capers 
I cut with Hildegarde and Fred ! 
The pranks we heedless children played, 
The deafening, awful noise we made — 
'T would shock my family, if they read 
About it in the papers! 



The Hawthorne children all were smart; 

The girls, as I recall. 
Had comprehended every art 
Appealing to the head and heart, 

The boys were gifted, all; 
'T was Hildegarde who showed me how 
To hitch the horse and milk a cow 

And cook the best of suppers; 
With Beatrix upon the sands 
I sprinted daily, and was beat, 
While Henry stumped me to the feat 
Of walking round upon my hands 

Instead of on my " uppers." 


The Hawthorne children liked me besf 

Of evenings, after tea; 
For then, by general request, 
I spun them yams about the west — 

And all involving Me! 
I represented how I 'd slain 
The bison on the gore-smeared plain, 

And divers tales of wonder 
I told of how I 'd fought and bled . 
In Injun scrimmages galore. 
Till Mrs. Hawthorne quoth " No more ! " 
And packed her darlings off to bed 

To dream of blood and thunder! 



They must have changed a deal since then : 

The misses tall and fair 
And those three lusty, handsome men. 
Would they be girls and boys again 

Were I to happen there, 
Down in that spot beside the sea 
Where we made such tumultuous glee 




In dull autumnal weather? 
Ah me! the years go swiftly by, 
And yet how fondly I recall 
The week when we were children all — 
Dear Hawthorne children, you and I — - 
Just eight of us, together! 



SLEEP, little pigeon, and fold your wings — 
Little blue pigeon with velvet eyes; 
Sleep to tne singing of mother-bird swinging — 
Swinging the nest where her little one lies. 

Away out yonder I see a star— 
Silvery star with a tinkling song; 

To the soft dew falling I hear it calling — 
Calling and tinkling the night along. 

In through the window a moonbeam comes — 
Little gold moonbeam with misty wings; 

All silently creeping, it asks : " Is he sleeping — 
Sleeping and dreaming while mother sings ? " 



LITTLE BLUE PIGEON 25 

Up from the sea there floats the sob 

Of the waves that are breaking upon the 
shore, 
As though they were groaning in anguish, and 
moaning — 
Bemoaning the ship that shall come no more. 

But sleep, little pigeon, and fold your wings — 
Little blue pigeon with mournful eyes; 

Am I not singing? — see, I am swinging — 
Swinging the nest where my darling lies. 



SOME time there ben a lyttel boy 
That wolde not renne and play, 
And helpless like that little tyke 
Ben allwais in the way. 
" Goe, make you merrie with the rest," 
His weary moder cried; 
But with a frown he catcht her gown 
And hong untill her side. 

That boy did love his moder well. 

Which spake him faire, I ween; 
He loved to stand and hold her hand 

And ken her with his een; 
His cosset bleated in the croft. 

His toys unheeded lay, — 
He wolde not goe, but, tarrying soe, 

Ben allwais in the way. 
26 



Godde loveth children and doth gird 

His throne with soche as these, 
And he doth smile in plaisaunce while 

They cluster at his knees; 
And some time, when he looked on earth 

And watched the bairns at play, 
He kenned with joy a lyttel boy 

Ben allwais in the way. 

And then a moder felt her heart 

How that it ben to-torne. 
She kissed eche day till she ben gray 

The shoon he use to worn; 
No bairn let hold untill her gown 

Nor played upon the floore, — 
Godde's was the joy; a lyttel boy 

Ben in the way no more! 



EVERY evening, after tea, 
Teeny-Weeny comes to me. 
And, astride my willing knee, 

Plies his lash and rides away; 
Though that palfrey, all too spare^ 
Finds his burden hard to bear, 
Teeny-Weeny does n't care; 
He commands, and I obey! 

First it 's trot, and gallop then; 
Now it 's back to trot again; 
Teeny-Weeny likes it when 

He is riding fierce and fast. 
Then his dark eyes brighter grow 
And his cheeks are all aglow: 
" More ! " he cries, and never " Whoa ! 
Till the horse breaks down at last. 
28 


Oh, the strange and lovely sights 

Teeny- Weeny sees of nights, 

As he makes those famous flights 

On that wondrous horse of his! 
Oftentimes before he knows, 
Wearylike his eyelids close, 
And, still smiling, off he goes 

Where the land of By-low is. 

There he sees the folk of fay 
Hard at ring-a-rosie play. 
And he hears those fairies say: 
" Come, let 's chase him to and fro ! 
But, with a defiant shout. 
Teeny puts that host to rout; 
Of this tale I make no doubt, 
Every night he tells it so. 

So I feel a tender pride 
In my boy who dares to ride 
That fierce horse of his astride. 
Off into those misty lands ; 



And as on my breast he lies, 
Dreaming in that wondrous wis£&gt; 
I caress his folded eyes, 

Pat his Httle dimpled hands. 

On a time he went away, 
Just a Uttle while to stay, 
And I 'm not ashamed to say 

I was very lonely then; 
Life without him was so sad, 
You can fancy I was glad 
And made merry when I had 

Teeny-Weeny back again! 

So of evenings, after tea. 
When he toddles up to me 
And goes tugging at my knee, 

You should hear his palfrey neigh i 
You should see him prance and shy, 
When, with an exulting cry, 
Teeny-Weeny, vaulting high, 

Plies his lash and rides away! 





IS listening soul hears no echo of battle, 
No psean of triumph nor welcome of fame; 
But down through the years comes a little 
one's prattle, 
And softly he murmurs her idolized name. 
And it seems as if now at his heart she were 
clinging 
As she clung in those dear, distant years to 
his knee; 
He sees her fair face, and he hears her sweet 
singing— 
And NelUe is coming from over the sea. 

While each patriot's hope stays the fullness of 
sorrow, 
While our eyes are bedimmed and our 
voices are low, 



He dreams of the daughter who comes with 
the morrow 
Like an angel come back from the dear 
long ago. 
Ah, what to him now is a nation's emotion, 

And what for our love or our grief careth he ? 
A swift-speeding ship is a-sail on the ocean. 
And Nellie is coming from over the sea! 

O daughter — my daughter! when Death 
stands before me 
And beckons me off to that far misty shore, 
Let me see your loved form bending tenderly 
o'er me. 
And feel your dear kiss on my lips as of yore. 
In the grace of your love all my anguish abating, 
I '11 bear myself bravely and proudly as he, 
And know the sweet peace that hallowed his 
waiting 
When NelHe was coming from over the sea. 



I^HE sky is dark and the hills are white 
As the storm-king speeds from the north 
to-night; 
And this is the song the storm-king sings, 
As over the world his cloak he flings: 

"Sleep, sleep, little one, sleep"; 
He rustles his wings and gruffly sings: 
"Sleep, little one, sleep." 

On yonder mountain-side a vine 
Clings at the foot of a mother pine; 
The tree bends over the trembling thing, 
And only the vine can hear her sing: 
" Sleep, sleep, little one, sleep — 
What shall you fear when I am here? 
Sleep, little one, sleep." 


The king may sing in his bitter flight, 
The tree may croon to the vine to-night, 
But the Httle snowflake at my breast 
Liketh the song / sing the best — 

Sleep, sleep, httle one, sleep; 
Weary thou art, a-next my heart 

Sleep, Httle one, sleep. 



1PRAY that, risen from the dead, 
I may in glory stand — 
A crown, perhaps, upon my head, 
But a needle in my hand. 

I Ve never learned to sing or play., 
So let no harp be mine; 

From birth unto my dying day, 
Plain sewing 's been my line. 

Therefore, accustomed to the end 
To plying useful stitches, 

I '11 be content if asked to mend 
The Uttle angels' breeches. 





SOME TIME 

LAST night, my darling, as you slept, 
• I thought I heard you sigh, 
And to your little crib I crept, 

And watched a space thereby; 
Then, bending down, I kissed your brow- 

For, oh! I love you so — 
You are too young to know it now, 
But some time you shall know. 

Some time, when, in a darkened place 

Where others come to weep. 
Your eyes shall see a weary face 

Calm in eternal sleep; 
The speechless lips, the wrinkled brow, 

The patient smile may show — 
You are too young to know it now, 

But some time you shall know. 


Look backward, then, into the years. 

And see me here to-night — 
See, O my darHng ! how my tears 

Are falling as I write; 
And feel once more upon your brow 

The kiss of long ago — 
You are too young to know it now. 

But some time you shall know. 


s I am sitting in the sun upon the porch 

to-day, 
1 look with wonder at the elm that stands 

across the way; 
I say and mean " with wonder," for now it 

seems to me 
That elm is not as tall as years ago it used 

to be! 
The old fire-hangbird 's built her nest therein 

for many springs — 
High up amid the sportive winds the curious 

cradle swings, 
But not so high as when a little boy I did 

my best 
To scale that elm and carry off the old fire- 

hangbird's nest! 



The Hubbard boys had tried in vain to reach 
the homely prize 

That dangled from that upper outer twig in 
taunting wise, 

And once, when Deacon Turner's boy had 
almost grasped the limb. 

He fell! and had to have a doctor operate 
on him ! 

Philetus Baker broke his leg and Orrin Root 
his arm- — 

But what of that? The danger gave the 
sport a special charm! 

The Bixby and the Cutler boys, the New- 
tons and the rest 

Ran every risk to carry off the old fire-hang- 
bird's nest! 



I can remember that I used to knee my 

trousers through, 
That mother used to wonder how my legs 

got black and blue, 


And how she used to talk to me and make 

stern threats when she 
Discovered that my hobby was the nest in 

yonder tree; 
How, as she patched my trousers or greased 

my purple legs, 
She told me 't would be wicked to destroy a 

hangbird's eggs, 
A.nd then she 'd call on father and on gran'pa 

to attest 
That they, as boys, had never robbed an old 

fire-hangbird's nest! 



Yet all those years I coveted the trophy flaunt- 
ing there, 

While, as it were in mockery of my abject 
despair. 

The old fire-hangbird confidently used to 
come and go, 

As if she were indifferent to the bandit horde 
below ! 



And sometimes clinging to her nest we thought 

we heard her chide 
The callow brood whose cries betrayed the 

fear that reigned inside : 
" Hush, Httle dears ! all profitless shall be their 

wicked quest — 
I knew my business when I built the old fire- 

hangbird's nest ! " 



For many, very many years that mother-bird 
has come 

To rear her pretty little brood within that cozy 
home. 

She is the selfsame bird of old — I 'm certain 
it is she — 

Although the chances are that she has quite 
forgotten me. 

Just as of old that prudent, crafty bird of com- 
pound name 

(And in parenthesis I '11 say her nest is still 
the same); 



Just as of old the passion, too, that fires the 

youthful breast 
To dimb unto and comprehend the old fire- 

hangbird's nest 1 



I like to see my old-time friend swing in that 

ancient tree. 
And, if the elm 's as tall and sturdy as it used 

to be, 
I 'm sure that many a year that nest shall in 

the breezes blow. 
For boys are n't what they used to be a forty 

years ago ! 
The elm looks shorter than it did when bro- 
ther Rufe and I 
Beheld with envious hearts that trophy flaunted 

from on high; 
He writes that in the city where he 's living 

'way out West 
His little boys have never seen an old fire- 

hangbird's nest! 



Poor little chaps! how lonesomelike their city 

life must be — 
1 wish they 'd come and live awhile in this 

old house with me! 
They 'd have the honest friends and healthful 

sports I used to know 
When brother Rufe and I were boys a forty 

years ago. 
So, when they grew from romping lads to 

busy, useful men, 
They could recall with proper pride their 

country life again; 
And of those recollections of their youth I 'm 

sure the best 
Would be of how they sought in vain the olc^ 

fire-hanojbird's nest! 


BUTTERCUP, Poppy, Forget-me-not — 
These three bloomed in a garden spot; 
And once, all merry with song and play, 
A little one heard three voices say: 
"Shine and shadow, summer and spring, 
O thou child with the tangled hair 
And laughing eyes! we three shall bring 
Each an offering passing fair." 
The little one did not understand, 
But they bent and kissed the dimpled hand. 

Buttercup gamboled all day long. 
Sharing the httle one's mirth and song; 
Then, stealing along on misty gleams, 
Poppy came bearing the sweetest dreams. 



Playing and dreaming — and that was all 
Till once a sleeper would not awake; 
Kissing the little face under the pall, 
We thought of the words the third flower 
spake; 
And we found betimes in a hallowed spot 
The solace and peace of Forget-me-not. 

Buttercup shareth the joy of day, 
Glinting with gold the hours of play; 
Bringeth the poppy sweet repose, 
When the hands would fold and the eyes 
would close; 
And after it all — the play and the sleep 

Of a little hfe — what cometh then? 
To the hearts that ache and the eyes that 
weep 
A new flower bringeth God's peace again. 
Each one serveth its tender lot— 
Buttercup, Poppy, Forget-me-not. 




WYNKEN, Blynken, and Nod one night 
Sailed off in a wooden shoe — 
Sailed on a river of crystal light, 
Into a sea of dew. 
"Where are you going, and what do you 
wish ? " 
The old moon asked the three. 
"We have come to fish for the herring fish 
That live in this beautiful sea; 
Nets of silver and gold have we ! " 
Said Wynken, 
Blynken, 
And Nod. 

The old moon laughed and sang a song, 
As they rocked in the wooden shoe. 

And the wind that sped them all night long 
Ruffled the waves of dew. 


The little stars were the herring fish 
That lived in that beautiful sea — 
"Now cast your nets wherever you wish — 
Never afeard are we " ; 
So cried the stars to the fishermen three: 
Wynken, 
Blynken, 
And Nod. 



All night long their nets they threw 

To the stars in the twinkling foam — 
Then down from the skies came the wooden shoe, 

Bringing the fishermen home; 
'T was all so pretty a sail it seemed 

As if it could not be, 
And some folks thought 't was a dream they'd 
dreamed 
Of sailing that beautiful sea—' 
But I shall name you the fishermen three: 
Wynken, 
Blynken, 
And Nod. 




Wynken and Blynken are two little eyes, 

And Nod is a little head, 
And the wooden shoe that sailed the skies 

Is a wee one's trundle-bed. 
So shut your eyes while mother sings 

Of wonderful sights that be, 
And you shall see the beautiful things 
As you rock in the misty sea, 
Where the old shoe rocked the fishermen 
three : 

Wynken, 
Blynken, 
And Nod. 



GOLD AND LOVE FOR DEARIE 

OUT on the mountain over the town, 
All night long, all night long, 
The trolls go up and the trolls go down, 

Bearing their packs and singing a song; 
And this is the song the hill-folk croon. 
As they trudge in the light of the misty 

moon — 
This is ever their dolorous tune: 
" Gold, gold ! ever more gold — 

Bright red gold for dearie!" 

Deep in the hill a father delves 
All night long, all night long; 

None but the peering, furtive elves 
Sees his toil and hears his song; 


Merrily ever the cavern rings 
As merrily ever his pick he swings, 
And merrily ever this song he sings: 
" Gold, gold ! ever more gold — 

Bright red gold for dearie!" 

Mother is rocking thy lowly bed 
All night long, all night long, 
Happy to smooth thy curly head, 

To hold thy hand and to sing her *song : 
'Tis not of the hill-folk dwarfed and old, 
Nor the song of thy father, stanch and bola- 
And the burthen it beareth is not of gold. 
But it 's "Love, love! nothing but love^ 
Mother's love for dearie ! " 


DEAREST, how hard it is to say 
That all is for the best, 
Since, sometimes, in a grievous way- 
God's will is manifest. 

See with what hearty, noisy glee 

Our little ones to-night 
Dance round and round our Christmas tree 

With pretty toys bedight. 

Dearest, one voice they may not hear. 

One face they may not see— 
Ah, what of all this Christmas cheer 

Cometh to you and me ? 



Cometh before our misty eyes 

That other little face, 
And we clasp, in tender, reverent wise; 

That love in the old embrace. 



Dearest, the Christ-Child walks to-night. 

Bringing his peace to men, 
A.nd he bringeth to you and to me the light 

Of the old, old years again. 



Bringeth the peace of long ago, 
When a wee one clasped your knee 

.And lisped of the morrow — dear one, you 
know — 
And here come back is he ! 



Dearest, 't is sometimes hard to say 

That all is for the best. 
For, often, in a grievous way 

God's will is manifest. 




But in the grace of this holy night 
That bringeth us back our child, 

Let us see that the ways of God are right, 
And so be reconciled. 




You *RE not so big as you were then, 
.. O little brook! — 
I mean those hazy summers when 
We boys roamed, full of awe, beside 
Your noisy, foaming, tumbling tide, 
And wondered if it could be true 
That there were bigger brooks than you, 
O mighty brook, O peerless brook! 

All up and down this reedy place 

Where lives the brook, 
We angled for the furtive dace; 
The redwing-blackbird did his best 
To make us think he 'd built his nest 
Hard by the stream, when, like as not. 
He 'd hung it in a secret spot 

Far from the brook, the telltale brook 1 




And often, when the noontime heat 

Parboiled the brook, 
We 'd draw our boots and swing our feet 
Upon the waves that, in their play, 
Would tag us last and scoot away; 
And mother never seemed to know 
What burnt our legs and chapped them so — 

But father guessed it was the brook! 



And Fido — how he loved to swim 

The cooling brook, 
Whenever we 'd throw sticks for him; 
And how we boys did wish that we 
Could only swim as good as he — 
Why, Daniel Webster never was 
Recipient of such great applause 

As Fido, battling with the brook! 



But once — O most unhappy day 

For you, my brook! — 
Came Cousin Sam along that way; 



And, having lived a spell out West, 
Where creeks are n't counted much at best, 
He neither waded, swam, nor leapt, 
But, with superb indifference, stept 

Across that brook — our mighty brook! 

Why do you scamper on your way, 

You little brook. 
When I come back to you to-day? 
Is it because you flee the grass 
That lunges at you as you pass, 
As if, in playful mood, it would 
Tickle the truant if it could. 

You chuckling brook — you saucy brook? 

Or is it you no longer know — 

You fickle brook — 
The honest friend of long ago ? 
The years that kept us twain apart 
Have changed my face, but not my heart— 
Many and sore those years, and yet 
T. fancied you could not forget 

That happy time, my playmate brook! 



Oh, sing again in artless glee, 

My little brook, 
The song you used to sing for me — 
The song that 's lingered in my ears 
So soothingly these many years; 
My grief shall be forgotten when 
I hear your tranquil voice again 

And that sweet song, dear little brook! 




o, pretty bee, did you see my croodlin' doo ? 

Ho, little lamb, is she jinkin' on the lea? 

Ho, bonnie fairy, bring my dearie back 

to me — 

Got a lump o' sugar an' a posie for you, 

Only bring me back my wee, wee croodlin' doo ! 

Why! here you are, my litde croodlin' doo! 
Looked in er cradle, but did n't find you 

there — 
Looked f'r my wee, wee croodlin' doo 
ever' where; 
Be'n kind lonesome all er day withouten you — 
Where you be'n, my teeny, wee, wee croodlin' 
doo? 



Now you go balow, my little croodlin' doo; 
Now you go rockaby ever so far, — 
Rockaby, rockaby up to the star 
That 's winkin' an' blinkin' an' singin' to you, 
As you go balow, my wee, wee croodlin' doo) 


LITTLE Mistress Sans-Merci 
J Fareth world-wide, fancy free: 
Trotteth cooing to and fro, 

And her cooing is command — 
Never ruled there yet, I trow, 
Mightier despot in the land. 
And my heart it Heth where 
Mistress Sans-Merci doth fare. 

Little Mistress Sans-Merci — 
She hath made a slave of me! 
"Go," she biddeth, and I go — 
"Come," and I am fain to come — 
Never mercy doth she show. 
Be she wroth or frolicsome. 
Yet am I content to be 
Slave to Mistress Sans-Merci! 


Little Mistress Sans-Merci 
Hath become so dear to me 
That I count as passing sweet 

All the pain her moods impart, 
And I bless the little feet 

That go trampling on my heart: 
Ah, how lonely life would be 
But for little Sans-Merci ! 

Little Mistress Sans-Merci, 
Cuddle close this night to me, 
And the heart, which all day long 

Ruthless thou hast trod upon. 
Shall outpour a soothing song 
For its best beloved one — 
All its tenderness for thee. 
Little Mistress Sans-Merci! 



10NCE knew all the birds that came 
And nested in our orchard trees, 
For every flower I had a name — 

My friends were woodchucks, toads, and bees; 
I knew where thrived in yonder glen 

What plants would soothe a stone-bruised 
toe — 
Oh, I was very learned then, 
But that was very long ago. 

I knew the spot upon the hill 

Where checkerberries could be found, 

I knew the rushes near the mill 

Where pickerel lay that weighed a pound! 



I knew the wood — the very tree 

Where lived the poachingj saucy crow, 

And all the woods and crows knew me — 
But that was very long ago. 

And pining for the joys of youth, 

I tread the old familiar spot 
Only to learn this solemn truth: 

I have forgotten, am forgot. 
Yet here 's this youngster at my knee 

Knows all the things I used to know« 
To think I once was wise as he! — 

But that was very long ago. 

I know it 's folly to complain 

Of whatsoe'er the fates decree, 
Yet, were not wishes all in vain, 

I tell you what my wish should be: 
I *d wish to be a boy again. 

Back with the friends I used to know. 
For I was, oh, so happy then — 

But that was very long ago! 



THE fire upon the hearth is low, 
And there is stillness everywhere, 
And, like wing'd spirits, here and there 
The firehght shadows fluttering go. 
And as the shadows round me creep, 
A childish treble breaks the gloom, 
And softly fi"om a further room 
Comes : " Now I lay me down to sleep." 

And, somehow, with that little prayer 
And that sweet treble in my ears, 
My thought goes back to distant years, 

And lingers with a dear one there; 


And as I hear my child's amen, 

My mother's faith comes back to me — 
Crouched at her side I seem to be, 

And mother holds my hands again. 

Oh, for an hour in that dear place — 

Oh, for the peace of that dear time— 
Oh, for that childish trust sublime — 

Oh, for a glimpse of mother's face! 

Yet, as the shadows round me creep, 
I do not seem to be alone — 
Sweet magic of that treble tone 

And " Now I lay me down to sleep ! '' 



Cobbler. 
Stork, I am justly wroth, 

For thou hast wronged me sore; 
The ash roof- tree that shelters thee 

Shall shelter thee no more! 

Stork. 
Full fifty years I 've dwelt 

Upon this honest tree, 
And long ago (as people know!) 

I brought thy father thee. 
What hail hath chilled thy heart, 

That thou shouldst bid me go ? 
Speak out, I pray — then I '11 away. 

Since thou commandest so. 



Cobbler. 
Thou tellest of the time 

When, wheehng from the west, 
This hut thou sought'st and one 
thou brought'st 

Unto a mother's breast. 
/ was the wretched child 

Was fetched that dismal morn— 
'T were better die than be (as I) 

To life of misery born ! 
And hadst thou borne me on 

Still farther up the town, 
A king I 'd be of high degree, 

And wear a golden crown! 
For yonder lives the prince 

Was brought that selfsame day: 
How happy he, while — look at me! 

I toil my life away ! 
And see my little boy — 

To what estate he 's born ! 
Why, when I die no hoard leave I 

But poverty and scorn. 
And thou hast done it all — 


I might have been a king 
And ruled in state, but for thy hate, 
Thou base, perfidious thing ! 



Stork. 
Since, cobbler, thou dost speak 

Of one thou lovest well, 
Hear of that king what grievous thing 

This very morn befell. 
Whilst round thy homely bench 

They well-beloved played, 
In yonder hall beneath a pall 

A little one was laid; 
Thy well-beloved's face 

Was rosy with delight, 
But 'neath that pall in yonder hall 

The little face is white; 
Whilst by a merry voice 

Thy soul is filled with cheer. 
Another weeps for one that sleeps 

All mute and cold anear; 
One father hath his hope, 



And one is childless now; 
He wears a crown and rules a town— « 

Only a cobbler thou I 
Wouldst thou exchange thy lot 

At price of such a woe ? 
I '11 nest no more above thy door, 

But, as thou bidst me, go. 

Cobbler. 
Nay, stork! thou shalt remain — 

I mean not what I said; 
Good neighbors we must always be, 

So make thy home o'erhead. 
I would not change my bench 

For any monarch's throne. 
Nor sacrifice at any price 

My darling and my own! 
Stork! on my roof-tree bide. 

That, seeing thee anear, 
I '11 thankful be God sent by thee 

Me and my darling here ! 




LAST night, whiles that the curfew bell ben 
J ringing, 

I heard a moder to her dearie singing 

"Lollyby, lolly, lollyby"; 
And presently that chylde did cease hys weeping, 
And on his moder's breast did fall a-sleeping 
To "lolly, lolly, lollyby." 

Faire ben the chylde unto his moder clinging, 
But fairer yet the moder's gentle singing — 

"Lollyby, lolly, lollyby"; 
And angels came and kisst the dearie smiling 
In dreems while him hys moder ben beguiHng 
With "lolly, lolly, lollyby." 


 

Then to my harte sales I : " Oh, that thy 

beating 
Colde be assuaged by some sweete voice re- 
peating 
'Lollyby, lolly, lollyby'; 
That like this lyttel chylde I, too, ben sleeping 
With plaisaunt phantasies about me creeping, 
To 'lolly, lolly, lollyby ' ! " 

Some time — mayhap when curfew bells are 

ringing— 
A. weary harte shall heare straunge voices 

singing 

"Lollyby, lolly, lollyby"; 
Some time, mayhap, with Chryst's love round 

me streaming, 
I shall be lulled into eternal dreeming, 
With "lolly, lolly, lollyby." 



1 WONDER ef all wimmin air 
Like 'Lizzie is when we go out 
To theaters an' concerts where 

Is things the papers talk about. 
Do other wimmin fret an' stew 

Like they wuz bein' crucified — 
Frettin' a show or concert through, 
With wonderin' ef the baby cried ? 

Now Lizzie knows that gran'ma 's there 
To see that everything is right, 

Yet Lizzie thinks that gran'ma's care 
Ain't good enuff fr baby, quite; 

Yet what am I to answer when 
She kind uv fidgets at my side, 

An' asks me every now and then: 

" I wonder if the baby cried ? " 



Seems like she seen two little eyes 

A-pinin' fr their mother's smile — 
Seems like she heern the pleadin' cries 

Uv one she thinks uv all the while; 
An' so she 's sorry that she come, 

An' though she alius tries to hide 
The truth, she 'd ruther stay to hum 

Than wonder ef the baby cried. 

Yes, wimmin folks is all alike — 

By Lizzie you kin jedge the rest; 
There never wuz a little tyke, 

But that his mother loved him best. 
And nex' to bein' what I be — 

The husband uv my gentle bride — 
I 'd wisht I wuz that croodlin' wee, 

With Lizzie wonderin' ef I cried. 



1 THOUGHT myself, indeed, secure 
So fast the door, so firm the lock; 
But, lo! he toddling comes to lure 
My parent ear with timorous knock. 

My heart were stone could it withstand 

The sweetness of my baby's plea, — 
That timorous, baby knocking and 
"Please let me in, — it 's only me." 

I threw aside the unfinished book, 
Regardless of its tempting charms, 

And, opening wide the door, I took 
My laughing darling in my arms. 



Who knows but in Eternity, 

I, like a truant child, shall wait 

The glories of a life to be, 

Beyond the Heavenly Father's gate ? 

And will that Heavenly Father heed 

The truant's supplicating cry, 
As at the outer door I plead, 
«'T is I, O Father! only I?" 




A CHILD was singing at his play — 
I heard the song, and paused to hear; 
His mother moaning, groaning lay, 
And, lo! a specter stood anear! 

The child shook sunlight from his hair, 
And caroled gaily all day long — 

Aye, with that specter gloating there, 
The innocent made mirth and song ! 

How like to harvest fruit wert thou, 
O sorrow, in that dismal room — 

God ladeth not the tender bough 

Save with the joy of bud and bloom! 




STRANGE that the city thoroughfare, 
Noisy and busthng all the day, 
Should with the night renounce its care 
And lend itself to children's play! 

Oh, girls are girls, and boys are boys, 
And have been so since Abel's birth, 

And shall be so till dolls and toys 
Are with the children swept from earth. 

The selfsame sport that crowns the day 
Of many a Syrian shepherd's son, 

Beguiles the little lads at play 
By night in stately Babylon. 

I hear their voices in the street, 

Yet 't is so different now from then! 

Come, brother! from your winding-sheet, 
And let us two be boys again ! 


THE little toy dog is covered with dust, 
But sturdy and stanch he stands; 
And the little toy soldier is red with rust, 

And his musket molds in his hands. 
Time was when the little toy dog was new, 

And the soldier was passing fair; 
And that was the time when our Little Boy Blue 
Kissed them and put them there. 

" Now, don't you go till I come," he said, 
" And don't you make any noise ! '* 
So, toddling off to his trundle-bed, 

He dreamt of the pretty toys ; 
And, as he was dreaming, an angel song 

Awakened our Little Boy Blue — 
Oh! the years are many, the years are long, 
But the little toy friends are true! 



Aye, faithful to Little Boy Blue they stand, 

Each in the same old place — 
Awaiting the touch of a little hand, 

The smile of a little face; 
And they wonder, as waiting the long years 
through 

In the dust of that little chair. 
What has become of our Little Boy Blue, 

Since he kissed them and put them there. 


 

I'm going to write a letter to our oldest boy 
who went 
Out West last spring to practise law and run 

for president; 
I '11 tell him all the gossip I guess he 'd like 

to hear, 
For he has n't seen the home-folks for going 

on a year! 
Most generally it 's Marthy does the writing, 

but as she 
Is suffering with a felon, why, the job devolves 

on me — 
So, when the supper things are done and put 

away to-night, 
I '11 draw my boots and shed my coat and 

settle down to write.  


I '11 tell him crops are looking up, with pros- 
pects big for corn, 

That, fooling with the barnyard gate, the off- 
ox hurt his horn; 

That the Templar lodge is doing well — Tim 
Bennett joined last week 

When the prohibition candidate for Congress 
came to speak; 

That the old gray woodchuck 's living still 
down in the pasture-lot, 

A- wondering what 's become of little William, 
like as not! 

Oh, yes, there 's lots of pleasant things and 
no bad news to tell. 

Except that old Bill Graves was sick, but now 
he 's up and well. 

Cy Cooper says — (but I '11 not pass my word 

that it is so. 
For Cy he is some punkins on spinning yarns, 

you know) — 
He says that, since the freshet, the pickerel 

are so thick 


In Baker's pond you can wade in and kill 
'em with a stick! 

The Hubbard girls are teaching school, and 
Widow Cutler's Bill 

Has taken Eli Baxter's place in Luther East- 
man's mill; 

Old Deacon Skinner's dog licked Deacon 
Howard's dog last week, 

And now there are two lambkins in one flock 
that will not speak. 

The yellow rooster froze his feet, a-wadin' 

through the snow, 
And now he leans agin the fence when he 

starts in to crow; 
The chestnut colt that was so skittish when 

Jie went away — 
I 've broke him to the sulky and I drive him 

every day! 
We 've got pink window curtains for the front 

spare-room up-stairs, 
And Lizzie 's made new covers for the parlor 

lounge and chairs ; 



We 've roofed the barn and braced the elm 
that has the hangbird's nest — 

Oh, there 's been lots of changes since our 
William went out West! 



Old Uncle Enos Packard is getting mighty 
gay— 

He gave Miss Susan Birchard a peach the 
other day! 

His late lamented Sarah hain't been buried 
quite a year, 

So his purring 'round Miss Susan causes criti- 
cism here. 

At the last donation party, the minister opined 

That, if he 'd half suspicioned what was com- 
ing, he 'd resigned; 

For, though they brought him slippers like he 
was a centipede, 

His pantry was depleted by the consequential 
feed! 

These are the things I '11 write him — our boy 
that 's in the West; 



And I '11 tell him how we miss him — his 

mother and the rest; 
Why, we never have an apple-pie that mother 

does n't say: 
''''He liked it so — I wish that he could have 

a piece to-day ! " 
I '11 tell him we are prospering, and hope he 

is the same — 
That we hope he '11 have no trouble getting 

on to wealth and fame; 
And just before I write " good-by from father 

and the rest," 
I '11 say that "mother sends her love," and 

that will please him best. 

For when / went away from home, the weekly 

news I heard 
Was nothing to the tenderness I found in that 

one word — &gt; 
The sacred name of mother — why, even now 

as then. 
The thought brings back the saintly face, the 

gracious love again; 



And in my bosom seems to come a peace that 

is divine, 
As if an angel spirit communed a while with 

mine; 
And one man's heart is strengthened by the 

message from above, 
A-nd earth seems nearer heaven when " mother 

sends her love." 




MY harp is on the willow-tree, 
Else would I sing, O love, to thee 
A song of long-ago — 
Perchance the song that Miriam sung 
Ere yet Judea's heart was wrung 
By centuries of woe. 

I ate my crust in tears to-day. 

As scourged I went upon my way — 

And yet my darling smiled; 
Aye, beating at my breast, he laughed — 
My anguish curdled not the draught — 

'T was sweet with love, my child! 


The shadow of the centuries lies 
Deep in thy dark and mournful eye 

But, hush ! and close them now ', 
And in the dreams that thou shalt drran? 
The light of other days shall seem 

To glorify thy brow! 

Our harp is on the willow-tree — 
I have no song to sing to thee, 

As shadows round us roll; 
But, hush and sleep, and thou shalt hear 
Jehovah's voice that speaks to cheer 

Judea's fainting soul ! 





COME, Harvey, let us sit a while and talk 
about the times 
Before you went to selling clothes and I to 

peddling rimes — 
The days when we were little boys, as naughty 

little boys 
As ever worried home-folks with their ever- 
lasting noise! 
Egad ! and, were we so disposed, I '11 venture 

we could show 
The scars of wallopings we got some forty 

years ago; 
What wallopings I mean I think I need not 

specify — 
Mother's whippings did n't hurt, but father's! 

oh, my ! 



The way that we played hookey those many 

years ago — 
We 'd rather give 'most anything than have 

our children know! 
The thousand naughty things we did, the 

thousand fibs we told — 
Why, thinking of them makes my presbyte- 

rian blood run cold! 
How often Deacon Sabine Morse remarked 

if we were his 
He 'd tan our " pesky little hides until the 

blisters riz ! " 
It 's many a hearty thrashing to that Deacon 

Morse we owe — 
Mother's whippings did n't count — father's did, 

though ! 

We used to sneak off swimmin' in those care- 
less, boyish days, 

And come back home of evenings with our 
necks and backs ablaze; 

How mother used to wonder why our clothes 
were full of sand, 




But father, having been a boy, appeared to 
understand. 

And, after tea, he 'd beckon us to join him 
in the shed 

Where he 'd proceed to tinge our backs a 
deeper, darker red; 

Say what we will of mother's, there is none 
will controvert 

The proposition that our father's lickings al- 
ways hurt! 

For mother was by nature so forgiving and 

so mild 
That she inclined to spare the rod although 

she spoiled the child; 
And when at last in self-defense she had to 

whip us, she 
Appeared to feel those whippings a great deal 

more than we ! 
But how we bellowed and took on, as if we 'd 

like to die — 
Poor mother really thought she hurt, and that 's 

what made her cry! 




Then how we youngsters snickered as out the 

door we slid, 
For mother's whippings never hurt, though 

father's always did. 

In after years poor father simmered down to 
five feet four, 

But in our youth he seemed to us in height 
eight feet or more ! 

Oh, how we shivered when he quoth in cold, 
suggestive tone: 
" I '11 see you in the woodshed after supper all 
alone ! " 

Oh, how the legs and arms and dust and trouser 
buttons flew — 

What florid vocalisms marked that vesper inter- 
view ! 

Yes, after all this lapse of years, I feelingly assert, 

With all respect to mother, it was father's whip- 
pings hurt! 

The little boy experiencing that tingling 'neath 

his vest 
Is often loath to realize that all is for the best j 




Yet, when the boy gets older, he pictures with 

deHght 
The buffetings of childhood — as we do here 

to-night. 
The years, the gracious years, have smoothed 

and beautified the ways 
That to our little feet seemed all too rugged 

in the days 
Before you went to selling clothes and I to 

peddling rimes — 
So, Harvey, let us sit a while and think upon 

those times. 



1WAS a mother, and I weep; 
The night is come — the day is sped— 
The night of woe profound, for, oh, 
My Httle golden son is dead ! 

The pretty rose that bloomed anon 
Upon my mother breast, they stole; 

They let the dove I nursed with love 
Fly far away — so sped my soul! 

That falcon Death swooped down upon 
My sweet-voiced turtle as he sung; 

'T is hushed and dark where soared the lark. 
And so, and so my heart was wrung ! 


Before my eyes, they sent the hail 
Upon my green pomegranate-tree — 

Upon the bough where only now 
A rosy apple bent to me. 

They shook my beauteous almond-tree, 
Beating its glorious bloom to death — 

They strewed it round upon the ground, 
And mocked its fragrant dying breath, 

I was a mother, and I weep; 

I seek the rose where nestleth none-=- 
No more is heard the singing bird — 

I have no little golden son! 

So fall the shadows over me. 
The blighted garden, lonely nest. 

Reach down in love, O God above ! 
And fold my darling to thy breast 




A MOONBEAM floateth from the skies. 
Whispering : " Heigho, my dearie ; 
I would spin a web before your eyes — 
A beautiful web of silver light 
Wherein is many a wondrous sight 
Of a radiant garden leagues away, 
Where the softly tinkling Hlies sway 
And the snow-white lambkins are at play* 
Heigho, my dearie!" 

A brownie stealeth from the vine. 

Singing : " Heigho, my dearie ; 
And will you hear this song of mine — 
A song of the land of murk and mist 
Where bideth the bud the dew hath kist? 




Then let the moonbeam's web of light 
Be spun before thee silvery white, 
And I shall sing the livelong night — 
Heigho, my dearie ! " 

The night wind speedeth from the sea, 
Murmuring : " Heigho, my dearie ; 

I bring a mariner's prayer for thee; 

So let the moonbeam veil thine eyes. 

And the brownie sing thee lullabies-— 

But I shall rock thee to and fro, 

Kissing the brow he loveth so. 

And the prayer shall guard thy bed, I trow^ 
Heigho, my dearie!" 




Aha! a traitor in the camp, 
, A rebel strangely bold, — 
A lisping, laughing, toddling scamp. 
Not more than four years old! 

To think that I, who 've ruled alone 

So proudly in the past, 
Should be ejected from my throne 

By my own son at last! 

He trots his treason to and fro, 

As only babies can. 
And says he '11 be his mamma's beau 

When he 's a " gweat, big man " ! 

You stingy boy! you 've always had 

A share in mamma's heart. 
Would you begrudge your poor old dad 

The tiniest little part? 



That mamma, I regret to see, 
Inclines to take your part, — 

As if a dual monarchy 

Should rule her gentle heart! 

But when the years of youth have sped. 

The bearded man, I trow, 
Will quite forget he ever said 

He 'd be his mamma's beau. 

Renounce your treason, Httle son,- 
Leave mamma's heart to me; 

For there will come another one 
To claim your loyalty. 

And when that other comes to you, 
God grant her love may shine 

Through all your life, as fair and true 
As mamma's does through mine ! 




WHEN brother Bill and I were boys, 
How often in the summer we 
Would seek the shade your branches made, 

O fair and gracious bell-flower tree! 
Amid the clover bloom we sat 

And looked upon the Holyoke range, 
While Fido lay a space away, 
Thinking our silence very strange. 

The woodchuck in the pasture-lot, 

Beside his furtive hole elate, 
Heard, off beyond the pickerel pond, 

The redwing-blackbird chide her mate. 
The bumblebee went bustling round, 

Pursuing labors never done — 
With drone and sting, the greedy thing 

Begrudged the sweets we lay upon! 



Our eyes looked always at the hills — 

The Holyoke hills that seemed to stand 
Between us boys and pictured joys 

Of conquest in a further land! 
Ah, how we coveted the time 

When we should leave this prosy place 
And work our wills beyond those hills, 

And meet creation face to face! 

You must have heard our childish talk — 

Perhaps our prattle gave you pain; 
For then, old friend, you seemed to bend 

Your kindly arms about us twain. 
It might have been the wind that sighed, 

And yet I thought I heard you say: 
"Seek not the ills beyond those hills — 

Oh, stay with me, my children, stay!" 

See, I Ve come back; the boy you knew 
Is wiser, older, sadder grown; 

I come once more, just as of yore — 
I come, but see ! I come alone I 



The memory of a brother's love, 
Of blighted hopes, I bring with me, 

And here I lay my heart to-day — 
A weary heart, O bell-flower tree! 

So let me nestle in your shade 

As though I were a boy again, 
And pray extend your arms, old friend. 

And love me as you used to then. 
Sing softly as you used to sing. 

And maybe I shall seem to be 
A little boy and feel the joy 

Of thy repose, O bell-flower tree! 



OH, listen, little Dear-My-Soul, 
To the fairy voices calling, 
Foi the moon is high in the misty sky 

And the honey dew is falling; 
lb the midnight feast in the clover bloom 

The bluebells are a-ringing. 
And it 's " Come away to the land of fay " 
That the katydid is singing. 

Oh, slumber, little Dear-My-Soul, 

And hand in hand we '11 wander — 
Hand in hand to the beautiful land 

Of Balow, away off yonder; 
Or we '11 sail along in a lily leaf 

Into the white moon's halo — 
Over a stream of mist and dream 

Into the land of Balow. 


Or, you shall have two beautiful wings — 

Two gossamer wings and airy, 
And all the while shall the old moon smile 

And think you a little fairy; 
And you shall dance in the velvet sky, 

And the silvery stars shall twinkle 
And dream sweet dreams as over their beams 

Your footfalls softly tinkle. 




[LOVED him so; his voice had grown 
Into my heart, and now to hear 
The pretty song he had sung so long 

Die on the Hps to me so dear! 
He a child with golden curls, 

And I with head as white as snow — 
\ knelt down there and made this pray'r: 
"God, let me be the first to go!" 

How often I recall it now: 

My darling tossing on his bed, 
I sitting there in mute despair. 

Smoothing the curls that crowned his head. 
They did not speak to me of death — 

A feeling here had told me so; 
What could I say or do but pray 

That I might be the first to go? 



Yet, thinking of him standing there 

Out yonder as the years go by, 
Waiting for me to come, I see 

'T was better he shoulu wait, not I. 
For when I walk the vale of death, 

Above the wail of Jordan's flow 
Shall rise a song that shall make me strong— 

The call of the child that was first to go. 




FAIR is the castle up on the hill — 
Hushaby, sweet my own ! 
The night is fair, and the waves are still. 
And the wind is singing to you and to me 
In this lowly home beside the sea — 
Hushaby, sweet my own ! 

On yonder hill is store of wealth — 

Hushaby, sweet my own ! 
And revelers drink to a little one's health; 
But you and I bide night and day 
For the other love that has sailed away — 

Hushaby, sweet my own! 

See not, dear eyes, the forms that creep 

Ghostlike, O my own! 
Out of the mists of the murmuring deep; 
Oh, see them not and make no cry 
Till the angels of death have passed us by- 

Hushaby, sweet my own! 



Ah, little they reck of you and me — 

Hushaby, sweet my own! 
In our lonely home beside the sea; 
They seek the castle up on the hill, 
And there they will do their ghostly will — 

Hushaby, O my own! 

Here by the sea a mother croons 
" Hushaby, sweet my own ! " 
In yonder castle a mother swoons 
While the angels go down to the misty deep 
Bearing a little one fast asleep — 
Hushaby., sweet my own! 




OMOTHER-MY-LOVE, if you '11 give me your 
hand, 
And go where I ask you to wander, 
I will lead you away to a beautiful land — 

The Dreamland that 's waiting out yonder. 

We '11 walk in a sweet-posie garden out there 

Where moonlight and starlight are streaming 

And the flowers and the birds are filling the air 

With the fragrance and music of dreaming. 

There '11 be no little tired-out boy to undress, 

No questions or cares to perplex you; 
There '11 be no Httle bruises or bumps to caress, 

Nor patching of stockings to vex you. 
For I '11 rock you away on a silver-dew stream, 

And sing you asleep when you 're weary. 
And no one shall know of our beautiful dream 

But you and your own little dearie, 


And when I am tired I '11 nestle my head 

In the bosom that 's soothed me so often, 
And the wide-awake stars shall sing in my 
stead 
A song which our dreaming shall soften. 
So, Mother-My-Love, let me take your dear 
hand, 
And away through the starlight we '11 wan- 
der — 
Away through the mist to the beautiful land — 
The Dreamland that 's waiting out yonder! 



OME hither, lyttel childe, and lie upon my 

breast to-night, 
For yonder fares an angell yclad In raimaunt 

white. 
And yonder sings ye angell as onely angells 

may. 
And his songe ben of a garden that bloometh 

farre awaye. 

To them that have no lyttel childe Godde 

sometimes sendeth down 
A lyttel childe that ben a lyttel angell of his 

owne; 
And if so bee they love that childe, he will- 

eth it to staye, 
But elsewise, in his mercie, he taketh it awaye. 




And sometimes, though they love it, Godde 

yearneth for ye childe, 
And sendeth angells singing, whereby it ben 

beguiled; 
They fold their arms about ye lamb that 

croodleth at his play, 
And beare him to ye garden that bloometh 

farre awaye. 

I wolde not lose ye lyttel lamb that Godde 
hath lent to me ; 

If I colde sing that angell songe, how joy- 
some I sholde be ! 

For, with mine arms about him, and my mu- 
sick in his eare. 

What angell songe of paradize soever sholde I 
feare ? 



Soe come, my lyttel childe, and lie upon my 

breast to-night, 
For yonder fares an angell yclad in raimaunt 

white, 




And yonder sings that angell, as onely angells 

may, 
And his songe ben of a garden that bloom- 

eth farre awaye. 




IF thou wilt shut thy drowsy eyes, 
My mulberry one, my golden sun ! 
The rose shall sing thee lullabies. 

My pretty cosset lambkin ! 
And thou shalt swing in an almond-tree, 
With a flood of moonbeams rocking thee- 
A silver boat in a golden sea, 

My velvet love, my nestling dove, 
My own pomegranate blossom! 

The stork shall guard thee passing well 
All night, my sweet! my dimple-feet! 

And bring thee myrrh and asphodel. 
My gentle rain-of-springtime ! 


And for thy slumbrous play shall twine 
The diamond stars with an emerald vine 
To trail in the waves of ruby wine, 
My myrtle bloom, my heart's perfume, 
My little chirping sparrow! 

And when the mom wakes up to see 

My apple bright, my soul's delight! 

The partridge shall come calling thee. 

My jar of milk-and-honey ! 
Yes, thou shalt know what mystery Hes 
In the amethyst deep of the curtained skies, 
If thou wilt fold thy onyx eyes. 
You wakeful one, you naughty son. 
You cooing little turtle! 




1 COUNT my treasures o'er with care,— 
The Httle toy my darHng knew, 
A httle sock of faded hue, 
A Httle lock of golden hair. 

Long years ago this holy time. 
My little one — my all to me — 
Sat robed in white upon my knee, 

And heard the merry Christmas chime. 

'• Tell me, my little golden-head, 

If Santa Claus should come to-night, 
What shall he bring my baby bright,- 
What treasure for my boy?" I said. 



And then he named this little toy, 
While in his round and mournful eyes 
There came a look of sweet surprise, 

That spake his quiet, trustful joy. 

And as he lisped his evening prayer 
He asked the boon with childish grace; 
Then, toddling to the chimney-place. 

He hung this little stocking there. 

That night, while lengthening shadows crept 
I saw the white-winged angels come 
With singing to our lowly home 

And kiss my darling as he slept. 

They must have heard his little prayer, 
For in the morn, with rapturous face. 
He toddled to the chimney-place. 

And found this little treasure there. 

They came again one Christmas-tide,— 
That angel host, so fair and white; 
And, singing all that glorious night, 

They lured my darling from my side. 



A little sock, a little toy, 
A little lock of golden hair, 
The Christmas music on the air, 

A watching for my baby boy ! 

But if again that angel train 

And golden-h^ad come oack for me, 

To bear me tc Eternity 
vlj/ svaTcmn^ vvii not le n, rain. 



HUSH, little one, and fold your hands— 
The sun hath set, the moon is high; 
The sea is singing to the sands, 

And wakeful posies are beguiled 
By many a fairy lullaby — 

Hush, little child — my Httle child! 

Dream, little one, and in your dreams 

Float upward from this lowly place — 
Float out on mellow, misty streams 
To lands where bideth Mary mild. 
And let her kiss thy little face, 
You little child — my little child! 




Sleep, little one, and take thy rest — 

With angels bending over thee, 
Sleep sweetly on that Father's breast 

Whom our dear Christ hath reconciled — 
But stay not there — come back to me, 
Oh, little child — 7ny little child! 



1WAS just a little thing 
When a fairy came and kissed me; 
Floating in upon the light 
Of a haunted summer night, 
Lo, the fairies came to sing 
Pretty slumber songs and bring 

Certain boons that else had missed me. 
From a dream I turned to see 
What those strangers brought for me, 
When that fairy up and kissed me — 
Here, upon this cheek, he kissed me! 

Simmerdew was there, but she 
Did not like me altogether; 
Daisybright and Turtledove, 
Pilfercurds and Honey love, 
Thistleblow and Amberglee 
On that gleaming, ghostly sea 



Floated from the misty heather, 
And around my trundle-bed 
Frisked, and looked, and whispering said — - 

Solemnlike and all together: 
"y(?u shall kiss him, Ganderfeather ! " 

Ganderfeather kissed me then — 

Ganderfeather, quaint and merry! 
No attenuate sprite was he, 
— But as buxom as could be; — 
Kissed me twice, and once again^ 
And the others shouted when 

On my cheek uprose a berry 
Somewhat Hke a mole, mayhap, 
But the kiss-mark of that chap 

Ganderfeather, passing merry — 

Humorsome, but kindly, very ! 

I was just a tiny thing 

When the prankish Ganderfeather 
Brought this curious gift to me 
With his fairy kisses three; 
Yet with honest pride I sing 



That same gift he chose to bring 
Out of yonder haunted heather. 
Other charms and friendships fly — 
Constant friends this mole and I, 
Who have been so long together. 
Thank you, Httle Ganderfeather ! 


BAMBINO in his cradle slept; 
And by his side his grandam grim 
Bent down and smiled upon the child, 
And sung this lullaby to him, — 
This " ninna and anninia " : 

" When thou art older, thou shalt mind 
To traverse countries far and wide, 
And thou shalt go where roses blow 
And balmy waters singing glide — 
So ninna and anninia! 

"And thou shalt wear, trimmed up in points, 
A famous jacket edged in red, 
And, more than that, a peaked hat. 
All decked in gold, upon thy head — 
Ah! ninna and anninia! 
123 



" Then shalt thou carry gun and knife, 
Nor shall the soldiers bully thee; 
Perchance, beset by wrong or debt, 
A mighty bandit thou shalt be^ 
So ninna and anninial 

"No woman yet of our proud race 

Lived to her fourteenth year unwed ^ 
The brazen churl that eyed a girl 

Bought her the ring or paid his head ^ 
So ninna and anninia! 

"But once came spies (I know the thieves!) 
And brought disaster to our race; 
God heard us when our fifteen men 

Were hanged within the market-place— 
But ninna and anninia! 

" Good men they were, my babe, and true,— 
Right worthy fellows all, and strong; 
Live thou and be for them and me 
Avenger of that deadly wrong — 
So ninna and anninia ! " 



AFTER dear old grandma died, 
Hunting through an oaken chest 
In the attic, we espied 

What repaid our childish quest; 
'T was a homely little slate, 
Seemingly of ancient date. 

On its quaint and battered face 

Was the picture of a cart, 
Drawn with all that awkward grace 

Which betokens childish art; 
But what meant this legend, pray: 
"Homer drew this yesterday"? 
125 


Mother recollected then 

What the years were fain to hide- 
She was but a baby when 

Little Homer lived and died; 
Forty years, so mother said, 
Little Homer had been dead. 

This one secret through those years 
Grandma kept from all apart, 

Hallowed by her lonely tears 
And the breaking of her heart ; 

While each year that sped away 

Seemed to her but yesterday. 

So the homely little slate 

Grandma's baby's fingers pressed. 

To a memory consecrate, 
Lieth in the oaken chest. 

Where, unwilling we should know, 

Grandma put it, years ago. 


 

A WORD TO THE CHILDREN 

Dear Children: Our little winged neighbors of 
the fields and hedges can help to give us a happy 
summer. If we watch the insects we will learn a 
great deal that is worth knowing. 

We can watch them everywhere, for even in the 
cities certain of them are always to be seen. In the 
parks and often in the crowded streets we may see 
butterflies and bees, bilt the best place to make their 
acquaintance is in the garden or out in the fields. 

The way to know them is to look, look, look. 

We can read about them, but that is not enough; 
we must also watch them with our own eyes. 

Think how pleasant it will be to take a summer 
walk and see little friends and acquaintances on every 
side. 

And think how busy we can keep, watching the 
affairs of our funny little insect neighbors. 

I hope you will all succeed in persuading some 
friejidly farmer to give you a piece of beebread out 




of his hives this summer, and that you will also get 
a good number of cocoons and chrysalids to look at 
through the winter. 

A happy summer to you.

BUTTERFLIES 

Gkeat ships are sailing on the broad blue 
sea ; their sails are white or gray and they 
can cross the ocean. 

See these little ships a-sailing in the 
air; their sails are all bright colors. 

They are the butterflies, and their 
wings are their sails. 

Sometimes they are blown out to sea and wrecked, 
for if they fall into the water they cannot get out 
again. 

MONARCHS 

Look ! the air is full of Monarchs. 

That is the name of this large butterfly that has dark 
yellow-red wings with black veins. 

Does it not look like a monarch among the insect 
folk? 

Can you count all the Monarchs you can see ? 

John says he can get as far as twenty, but they 
move about so rapidly that he cannot then tell which 
he has counted and which he has not. 




They seem to be sailing about for the pleasure of it, 
but many of them are at rest on the golden-rods. 

See ! the golden-rods seem to have blossomed out 
into butterflies. 

Monarchs, what are you doing on the golden-rods? 

They are walking daintily about on long, black legs 
_ that look like threads. 




May says they have only, four legs, which puzzles 
her, as she knows that insects have six legs. Look 
more carefully. Ah! now you see how it is. 

They have four long legs and two short ones, for the 
front legs are very small and the Monarchs hold them 
up close to their bodies, so we have to look sharp to 
see them. 

Why are the front legs of the Monarchs so small 
and useless? 







Doubtless the front legs were once strong and large 
enough to walk with, but for some reason this family 
of butterflies ceased to use these two legs, and they 
gradually grew smaller and weaker. 

You will remember that if an organ is not used, it 
dwindles away in course of time. 

There is a large family of butterflies with small 
front legs; they are called the Four- 
footed butterflies. 

May says the Monarchs are doing 
something besides walking about on 
the golden-rods* They uncui'l a longy 
black, threadlike tongue, and this 
they thrust into the little golden- 
rod flowers and suck out the 
nectar that is there. 

Look at the 
tongue ; it seems 
to have a joint 
in the middle, ¡ª 
at least it is ^^ 
bent in the (y^ 
middle. ^^' 







Now watch this one near us put the tip of that long 
tongue into first one tiny golden-rod flower and then 
another. 

The Monarchs seem to enjoy golden-rod nectar. 

Golden-Rod Flowers 

Do you know of the golden-rod flowers ? 
Each spray of golden-rod is made up of many separate 
flowers. The flowers are gathered into little clusters. 
Here is one branch from a large spray. 
.How many flowers are there on it ? 
Yes ; I thought you would all say four. 
Well, there are more than twenty. 
Each of those that you think is a single flower 
is really a cluster of tiny flowers. 
We will take off one little cluster. 
Now we will take it apart and look at one of the 
tiny flowers. 

We shall have to use a magnifying glass to 
see it Well. 

See what a perfect little flower it is under the glass. 
Yes, May, it looks somewhat like a little lily. 
Who would guess that the golden-rods were made up 
of so many, many tiny flowers ! 

There is a drop of nectar for the butterflies in each 
little flower tube. 






And now you see why the butterflies need such 
slender tongues. 

They could not reach the nectar hidden away in the 
bottoms of the tiny flower cups unless they had tongues 
as slender as threads. 

See them go from flower to flower ; they know just 
what to do with those tongues of theirs. 

Other insect folk are searching for the nectar, but 
there are more butterflies than anything else. 

The bumblebees are burying their flat faces deep in 
the golden-rod flowers, for they, too, have long, slender 
tongues. 

The Tongue, Eyes, and Antenna 

No, May, the tongues of the bees are not so long and 
slender as are those of the butterflies, and therefore the 
bees cannot reach the nectar so well as can o\ir dainty 
butterflies. 

The tongue of the 
butterfly is really a 
long tube. The mouth 
parts are modified to 
make it. It is not like the sharp tube of the bugs. 
The butterfly cannot pierce with its tongue. 

Do you know what becomes of the long tongue when 
the butterfly is not using it ? 








Yes, May, it is coiled up like a watch spring. 
What a pretty way to take care of it ! 
See the little coiled tongue under the butterfly's head. 
And see its black eyes. How round they are ! 

Yes, you are right, Charlie ; they 
^;Ji0^ are compound eyes, but I do not 

know how many 
facets they have. 
Facets, you remem- 
ber, are the small 
eyes into which 
these large ones are 
divided. 
Nearly all adult insects have com- 
pound eyes, you know. 

Eutterflies see well. We have to be 
careful when we go near one or it will 

/fly away before we have a chance 
to get a good look at it. 
Yes^ Mayj our butterfly has a little 
round head and two pretty, delicate 
' 1/ ./autennaN with a knob at the end of 
each. 
Watch it examine the little flowers 
of the golden-rod with its anten- 
'^ UEJD, or feelers as we also call them. 





before it uncurls its tongue. It touches first one flower, 
then another. 

Yes, little Nell, it is smelUng to see where the nectar 
is. I see you remember that insects smell with their 
feelers. 

As soon as our butterfly finds a flower that is full of 
nectar, out comes that long, black tongue, and the tip 
of it soon finds its way into the little flower cup. 

Wings 

Be careful, Ned, my boy ! You will break the butter- 
fly's wings if you handle it so carelessly. 

What could it do with broken wings ? 

It could not go a-sailing in the air, ¡ª that is, if its 
wings were too badly injured. 

There goes one with wings all rags and tatters ! 

What do you suppose has happened to it ? 

Sometimes birds bite the wings of the butterflies. 

They think they can catch them by their wings ; but 
it is not easy for a bird to catch one of the large 
butterflies in this way. 

Often all that the bird gets for his trouble is a mouth- 
ful of dry butterfly wing, and the butterfly is not much 
the worse for the encounter, ¡ª that is, unless the bird 
takes too big a bite, or bites one wing a great deal 





Motiardy 



more than the other, so that the butterfly cannot 
balance itself. 

A butterfly can lose a good deal of sail and still keep 
afloat, so long as both sails are clipped alike. But if 
one is cut and the other not, that is a sad 
matter ; butterfly tries to float off in the 
air and tumbles to the ground instead. 

Birds do not often bite 

the wings of the Monarchs; 

they have a very disagree- 

al>le taste and the birds know it 

and do not often try to eat one. 






Viceroys 

Now what do you think ? 

Here is a butterfly that is not 

' a Monarch. It is called the Viceroy. 

The birds like the taste of this 

butterfly, but it looks so much 

like a Monarch that they do not often 

catch it. They think it is an ill-tasting 

Monarch and let it severely alone. 

It is smaller than the Monarch, and has a 
black band running across the middle of its hind wings. 
See if you can find a Viceroy. 
It belongs to the Four-footed butterflies. 






Mimicry 



A good many insects mimic other insects. 

They do it for protection. 

You will always find that the insects mimicked are 
those able to care for themselves. 

The helpless ones mimic the others. 

Bad-smelling or bad-tasting insects are very apt to be 
mimicked by those that are not disagreeable. 

Protective mimicry is adopted by a great many insects. 

The fierce stinging insects are apt to be mimicked by 
those that have no sting. Some flies and beetles look 
so much like bumblebees or wasps that you would not 
dare touch them. 

Yes, May, some insects mimic leaves and twigs in 
order to escape notice. 

One butterfly, which is not found in our country, 
mimics the leaves of certain shrubs so exactly that you 
would have to look sharp indeed to detect it. Those I 
have seen in museums are brownish in color and look 
exactly like a dead leaf on a twig. 

On the next page is a picture of a twig with a butter- 
fly on it, and at first glance you do not know which is the 
butterfly. It has its wings folded together over its back. 

Yes, John, we see only the under side of its wings. 
The upper side is not dull and brown ; it is bright in 



^ -^y^ on 




color, ¡ª blue, orange, and black, I 
think. But when this butterfly comes 
to rest it folds up its wings dull side 
out, and you see that there are 
lines like the veining of leaves 
them. You can imagine that 



butterfly sitting on a twig with its leaf- 
like wings folded over its body and say- 
ing, "Now, bird, find me if you can." 
Other insects, as you know, are the 
color of the earth or of the leaves, so that you 
can scarcely see them unless they move. 
When insects are colored like their surroundings we 
say that their coloring is protective. 

Can you think of any other insects that have pro- 
tective coloring? 

Yes, John, the little brown moths tha;t hide close to 
the roots of the grass. 

Yes, the Walking Sticks have protective coloring. 
Nell says tree toads have protective coloring, for they 
can change their color to suit their surroundings. 
That makes the rest of the children laugh. 
Do you know why they laugh, little Nell ? 
Yes, she says she knows. Tree toads are not insects, 
but the protective coloring of insects made her think of 
tree toads. 



That is right, Nell; tree toads have protective col- 
oring like the insects. A great many animals have 
protective coloring. 

John asks whether insects change their color to suit 
their surroimdings, as some other animals do. 

Now, John, I cannot answer you. I do not know 
whether they do or not. 

As a rule they do not, but I should not like to say it 
never happens. 

This I do know, that grasshoppers are differently 
colored in different places. 

For instance, those near the seashore are often 
nearly white, just the color of the sand they hop on, 
and in places where the soil or rock is black, or very 
dark brown, the grasshoppers are of the same color. 

Young insects are often different in color from 
the adults, and this is usually the case where the 
surroimdings are different. 

'No, MoUie, not all insects have protective coloring. 

Some are very bright and very different in color 
from their surroundings. 

Such are our Monarchs. 

Perhaps they wish to be seen. 

I think the very bright butterflies that come out in 
the sunshine are usually offensive to the birds. This 
being the case, it is an advantage to the butterflies to 







have the birds recognize them quickly, before taking a 
taste, you see. 

Butterflies have another way of escaping birds. 
Some kinds fly very swiftly indeed, suddenly and 
frequently changing their course. They go zigzagging 
along at such a rapid rate that no bird can follow. 

The Monarchs do not need to fly so fast; their 

disagreeable flavor protects them. Often their great 

wings move slowly as they sail in the air, though when 

they wish they can dart about at a very rapid rate. 

Yes, little Nell, the butterfly's wings, as well as its 

,;^ legs, are attached to its thorax, 

and its abdomen is divided into 

segments, like the abdomens of 

all the insects. 

It has four large wings, two on 
each side, which it holds up over its 
back when it is at rest. 

It cannot fold them away. 
Nell has caught one of the 
Monarchs, which she is hold- 
ing carefully by the wings. 




Scales 

See how dusty her little fingers are. 

The dust comes from the wings of the butterfly. 

See, it rubs oflE and then the wing is not so pretty. 

No, I do not think it hurts the butterfly to hold it 
carefully by the wings. It rubs the pretty color oflE, 
though. 

Yes, May, some of the butterflies have wings that look 
old and worn, and no doubt they are old and worn. 

It does not take long for them to look so if the 
butterfly gets caught under a bush, or in any place 
where it beats its wings against something in trying 
to escape and thus scrapes ofE the bright dust. 

Mollie thinks the butterfly's wing is powdered with 
this bright dust on purpose to look beautiful, and that 
undoubtedly is true. 

Would you like to see some butterfly-wing dust 
under the microscope? 

You shall see it when we go home. 

"What is that, Mollie, ¡ª Let us go home now and see it ? 

Well, so we will. It is not far, and we can come 
back to the butterflies again. 

This wing dust that you are to see is not from a 
Monarch ; it is from other butterflies, and from a moth 
or two. 






Now, Mollie, all is ready, and you may be the first 
to look. 

"Oh! oh!" 

I thought you would be surprised. 

Mollie says the butterfly-wing dust 
is like fairy-fish scales from fairy fish 
' that live in rainbows. 
Indeed, these tiny scales are wonder- 
fully beautiful, ¡ª they are so delicate, 
and so lovely in coloring. 
Yes, John^ small as they are, they are 
linished off with exquisite perfection. 
'^ No matter how much we 
^ were to magnify them, they 
' would never seem coarse or rough. 
ou wonder why anything so small 
and unimportant as the dust on the 
butterfly's wing should have 
been so carefully made? 

Well, my boy, that is 

Nature's way. Everjrthing 

is done perfectly, and the small 

things are as carefully finished as 

the large ones. 

May says she thinks we could learn a 
lesson from that. 







scales, 
flies, you 



Indeed, May, I am sure we could. 
Ned has not yet seen these beautiful scales through 

the microscope. 

Yes, Ned, they do look like 
dainty stick-tight seeds 
made of thin glass. 

These little objects are 
really tmy scales; not fish 
scales, of course, but insect 
These are from, several species of butter- 
know, and so they are of different shapes. 
Yes, May, each species has scales different from 
the scales of other species. Yes, indeed, I think it is 
wonderful. 

Now look through the microscope again. 
Here is a piece of wing with a few scales attached. 
See how they overlap. 
They protect the wing and 
strengthen it as well as beautify it. 
Look, too, at the wing where the 
scales have been rubbed off. It is 
no longer bright in color. It looks 
like a piece of oiled paper. 

Yes, May, the little dots on it are 
where the scales that have been brushed off were 
fastened. 







What a beautiful and wonderful thing is the butter- 
fly's wing ! 

We name the butterfly order from these scales on 
the wings, just as we named the caddice-fly order from 
the hairs on the wings. 

Yes, May, the insects in an order are no doubt closely 
related to each other, more closely than insects of 
different orders. 

You see they are alike in other 

j^ ways than in their wings, al- 

y though we have chosen to name the 

orders from some peculiarity of the wings. 

K^ John is anxious to know the name 

^^,^ of the butterfly order. 

It is the Lep-i-dop-te-ra. 
The word comej^ from the Greek ^<^on, a wing, and 
lepis^ a scale. Scale Wing, ¡ª that is the name of the 
order of our butterfly. 

May wants to know why we do not say " lepis-pteron," 
instead of " lepidoptera." 

For one reason, it is easier to say " lepidoptera." 
Other reasons you will understand when you have 
grown a little older and have studied a little more about 
how words are formed. 

I hope you will like to study how words are made 
some day, for words are very interesting. 





Scales and Hairs 

Now I think you would like to know 
something more' about scales 
and hairs. 

Both of them grow out 
from the skin, as you know. 

If you look at the wing of 
the moth close up to the body, you 
will see hairs mingled with the scales, 
and you will find scales almost as thin 
as hairs; for scales are only flattened hairs, 
modified hairs, you know. 

What, Ned, ¡ª fish scales are not flattened hairs? 
Oh, but they are. 

Scales and hairs and feathers are all really the same. 

Scales and feathers are modified hairs ; they all grow 
out from the skin in the same way. 

¡ö Yes, May, the hairs are modified to suit the needs of 
those that wear them. 

The hairs of the fox grow very thick to make him a 
warm fur coat, that he may not suffer in the freezing 
winter. 

The hairs on the bird are large and flattened out into 
feathers to make a smooth covering, as well as a warm 
one, when the bird flies through the air. Feathers are 


lighter than fur and they lie down flat and keep in 
place better when the wind blows. Feathers help make 
useful wings for the birds. 

The birds could not fly unless their hairs were modi- 
fied into feathers. 

Imagine a bird clad in fur like a fox! 

The fish does not need fur or feathers. It needs 
hairs that are short, flat, and homy, so that it can slip 
easily through the water. Therefore its hairs are modi- 
fied into smooth, flat scales. Some insects have spines 
that are modified hairs, and the Lepidoptera have, as 
you know, modified hairs that are scales to protect their 
wings and make them beautiful. 

So now you know how useful hairs are to all the 
animals. 

Fritillaries 

Let us take a walk in the woods. 

How dark and mysterious it is under the big trees ! 

We see no butterflies here, for they like the sunshine. 

Now we come out into a sunny glade. And here are 
butterflies in bright array. 

Pretty ones, we are very glad to meet you on our 
walk. 

See those two butterflies over there. They are called 
Fritillaries, 



How they go flitting up and down in the sunshine ! 

Now they are gone. No, there they come back again. 

The same butterfly will flit up and down a sunny 
opening in the woods all day long. 

They love the sunshine. 

They love the air beating in per- 
fumed waves against their wings. 

And surely they love the swift^ 
strong movement of their flight. 

It is beautiful, butterflies, to 
flit thus swiftly up and down the 
sunny spaces in the woods. 

These yellowish-brown butter- 
flies, with their wings bordered 
and marked with black, their 
hinder ones often embroidered 
with silver spots, are very often seen. 

They are the Fritillaries, and we have more than fifty 
species of them, and ¡ª yes, they too have tiny, helpless 
fore feet. They belong to the Four-footed butterflies. 




Red Admiral 

So does our charming Red Admiral. 
Do you know the Red Admiral ? 
Come, then, and make its acquaintance. 







I see one on that thistle head. 

Butterflies love the thistles. 
Where there are thistles you will be sure to 
¡ö' see butterflies. 

The thistle head, like the 
golden-rod, as you 
know, is made up of 
a great many small, 
tubular flowers. 
In each little flower tube is 
a drop of nectar. 

The Red Admiral is a 
beauty. How rich the colors 
of its purple-black wings, with 
orange-colored bands and 
white spots! 

Indeed, May, the Four-footed 
butterflies are a large family, 
and many of them are very beautiful. 




The Mourning Cloak 

One of the commonest of this family is the Mourning 
Cloak. 

You all know it. 

It flies about all summer long, and it is everywhere. 



The wings are dark brown, with a broad yellow 
border along the margins. The yellow border is 
embroidered with brown, and there is a row of blue 
spots above it, on the upper side of the wings. 

See! here comes a Mourning Cloak, flitting down the 
sutmy glade as though on purpose to let us see it. 

It is on its way to the thistle. It, too, is fond of 
thistle nectar. 

The tube of the little thistle flower is longer than 
that of the golden-rod; consequently not so many in- 
sects can eiijoy thistle nectar. Their tongues are not 
long enough to reach it. 

But the tongues of the butterflies can easily reach it. 

If you watch the butterflies, you will find that they 
visit a great many flowers which store their nectar 
at the bottom of long, slender tubes. 

The table of the butterflies is spread 
all summer long with bright and fragrant 
blossoms, ¡ªdelicate dishes that hold 
delicious nectar for them. 

And the butterflies do what in 
return for this royal feast that is 
always ready ? May says they carry pel 
len from one flower to another. Pollen, 
you will remember, is necessary to tho 
forming of the seeds. 





Pollen 





What, Ned, ¡ª you have forgotten what pollen is ? 
Do you not remember the dust in the little flower 
boxes which we call anthers? 

You shall see the jpicture of a lily; 
for the anthers show plainly there. 

There are six anthers, crescent 
shaped, and balanced on long, slen- 
der stems. The crescent-shaped an- 
ther is full of pollen dust, ¡ª tiny grains that fall 
out when the flower is ripe. 

At the center of the lily you can see the seed 
pod. There is a long, tubular stem growing from 
the top of it, and this stem ends in a knob. 

If the pollen touches the knob it remains there. 
Yes, the knob when ripe is sticky and holds the 
pollen grain. Soon the substance of the pollen grain 
finds its way down the long, slender tube to the seeds in 
the pod. This pollen substance unites with the seeds 
and then the seeds develop into plants. 
The seeds cannot grow without pollen. 
If it were not for the insects, most of the pollen 
would fall out of the anthers and be wasted. 

Bees and other nectar-eating insects visit the flowers 
and thus scatter the pollen. 





The butterfly also comes for nectar. It touches the 
ripe anther with its fuzzy back, or with its legs or its 
tongue. The pollen clings to the butterfly and then 
the butterfly, all dusty with pollen, goes to another 
flower and, brushing against the sticky knob^ 
leaves some pollen grains on it. 

Now you know what cargo is 
borne by these brave little ships 
of the air. 

They do not cgLrry bales of 
merchandise, like the great 
ships of the sea, but the 
freight they bear is as precious as 
the cargoes of the ships. 

Were it not for the insect folk who 
bear pollen from plant to plant, there 
would be no seeds formed on some species 
of plants, and if there were no seeds 
there would soon be no plants. 

Were it not for the insect folk, there would be fewer 
flowers to cheer us ; and without our friends the insects 
we should have less food to eat, for they carry the 
pollen that helps to form the seeds for our fruits and 
vegetables. 

When the flower receives the pollen we say that it is 
fertilized. Many kinds of insects fertilize the flowers. 





The butterflies help to fertilize the golden-rods. When 
they put long tongues into tiny nectar cups, they rub 
off pollen grains to carry to the next golden-rod ; for 
each little golden-rod flower has its tiny pollen cases, 
and each has its seed pod. 

Is it not a pleasant thought that we owe our lovely 
flowers to our beautiful insect friends ? and that we owe 
our insect friends to our flowers ? For if it were not for 
the flowers, our fairy-winged insects that make the 
world so cheery would not be with us, for the flowers 
supply the nourishment on which they live. 

Where the Butterflies come From 

Where do the butterflies come from ? little Nell wants 
to know. 

Where do you think they come from, little Nell ? 

Yes, they are hatched out of eggs. Butterflies often 
lay their eggs on the leaves or twigs of plants, and 
one day last summer I saw a Monarch butterfly hover- 
ing over some milkweeds. It darted down every little 
while and rested on a leaf for just a second, then off 
again, only to return to another leaf. Every time it 
thus rested on the milkweed leaf it left there a tiny 
green egg. Of course I picked some of those milkweeds 
and took them home and put them in water. What do 
you suppose happened in a few days ? 






Yes, the eggs hatched. 

Do you think they hatched into butterflies ? 

No, you all know better than that. Out of butterfly 
eggs are hatched little larvaB, and the larvaB of butter- 
flies are caterpillars. 

Yes, John, the caterpillar is a larva. 

Caterpillars never lay eggs, for only adult insects do 
that. 

No, indeed. May, caterpillars are not " worins " ! 

Some people call everything that creeps a worm, just 



as they call all 
I will tell you 
insects at alL

Worms never

never have the 
body divided into 
head, thorax, and 
abdomen. 




winged insects bugs, 
something : worms are not 
They belong to 
of animals, 
have legs or 






Some larvaB look like worms, but they transform 
finally into insects, with head, thorax, abdomen, and 
six legs. 

Worms never do that. 

Yes, Ned, the angleworm, or earthworm, is a true 
worm. There is not much difference between its head 
end and its tail end. It never has legs or wings, no 
matter how long it lives. 

The Larva 

When the little caterpillars (the larvae, you know) 
first hatched out of the Monarch's eggs, they were so 
tiny that one could hardly tell their color and shape ; 
but you know what they at once began to do. Yes, eat, 
eat, eat, eat ; and grow, grow, grow. 

It was great fun to watch them from day to day, 
they grew so fast and changed so rapidly. In two or 
three days the little dots of things looked quite like 
caterpillars with their yellow bodies ringed with black. 

Oh, yes, they shed their skins a number of times 
before they were full grown ; and you could tell when 
they were about to do it, for they would stop eating for 
several hours and look quite pale and faded. 

The outer skin that loosened and fell off was so 
very thin and delicate that you had to look carefully 
to find it. 



How bright their colors were after they had shed 
their skins, and how fast they grew ! 

Do you know, I see some milkweeds over there in the 
fence comer, and I should n't wonder if you could find 
some Monarch caterpillars there. Go and see. 

The Monarch Caterpillar 

Ah, yes ! now you know just how they 
look. You wonder what those two long, 
black horns near the head end are for ? 

And see ! there are two shorter ones 
near the tail end. 

No, they are not antennae. 

The butterfly has anten- 
nae, but the caterpillar has not. 
These horns do not grow from 
the head, you see, but from one 
of the rings back of the head. 

May has noticed that they cotne 
out of a black ring and, in sliort, 
look like an elongation of the black 
skin, and I am sure that is just 
what they are, ¡ª modified skin. 

As to their use, the caterpillar seems 
to use them like feelers, and ]jrobably they 
are sensitive, though I do not know whether 






they contain nerves of scent or not. But you see the 
caterpillar waves them about when it moves, as though 
it were using them to help find its way. 

No, indeed, caterpillars do not usually have these 
horns, ¡ª only the Monarch caterpillars and a few others. 

See its little, shining black head. Can you find its 
tiny, simple eyes ? 

Its body is not divided into thorax and abdomen. 
The segments are alike, except that there are legs 
attached to some of them. 

The -first three segments back of the head each bear 
a pair of short, sharp-pointed, jointed legs, with little 
feet at the ends. 

What is that. May, ¡ª it has several short, fat legs in 
the middle of its body ? Yes, we can see them quite 
plainly. 

True, Mollie, there are little clasping feet at the end 
of these short elephant legs. 

This caterpillar has four pairs of them in the middle 
of the body, and if you look at the tip end of the body 
you will find another pair. 

These extra legs are called "pro-legs." They are not 
jointed, and I can tell you something about them that 
you will like to know. 

They are merely modified skin. The skin is modified 
to do duty as legs. 





Yes, Mollie^ the skin is very changeable ; it readily 
assumes new forms. 

The caterpillar is supplied with prolegs because it has 
such a heavy, clumsy body to pull around. 

No, May, not all caterpillars have five pairs of pro- 
legs, though nearly all do. 

We shall meet a caterpillar that has less than ten 
prolegs, ¡ª that is, less than five pairs, you know, ¡ª and 
we shall meet one that has mure 
than ten. 

Generally, however, the true 
caterpillars have ten prolegs. 

Now see its little jaws move as 
it chews the edge of the leaf. 

Yes, John, the jaws of insects move sidti- 
ways, instead of up and down like ours- 

No, they have no teeth, but the jaws themBelves are 
quite hard and homy, and are sharp on the edges. In 
some insects they are notched like little saws on the edges. 

Yes, Mollie, this is just like the caterpillars 1 raised 
from the eggs, and I will tell you what happened to them. 

One day one of them stopped eating. It moved rest- 
lessly about and I saw threads of silk on the milkweed 
leaves. 

It had eaten enough. It began to feel the strange 
changes that were taking place in its little body, and it 



wished to creep away to undergo the wonderful trans- 
formation in store for it. It left the milkweed and 
began to wander about the room. So I put it in a large 
\ ^ pqpny box and shut the cover down. 

This safe hiding place was what it wanted, 
and it soon spun a little button of silk out of 
ita mouth on the under side of the box cover, 
and this button it grasped firmly with the two 
prolegs at the tail end of the body. 
Then it let go with all its other legs imtil it 
was hanging by its hind feet. It did not hang 
head down, but curled up a little, as you see 
in the picture. It hung there for a whole day, 
and then ¡ª the caterpillar skin split open and dropped 
off, and there remained, not a caterpillar, but a very 
beautiful little pupa. 

The Pupa 

This pupa looked as though made of delicate pea- 
green glass, and there were sparkling gold dots on it, 
and a line of shining gold halfway around the upper 
part of its body. 

You can hardly imagine anything more beautiful or 
anything more different from a yellow-and-black-ringed 
caterpillar. 





You see it had molted for the last time, and under its 
old skin was the hard pupa skin, like a shell. 

Yes, Mollie, the hard pupa shell is needed to protect 
it in its resting stage. 

In its larval or eating stage it can move about and 
curl up and wriggle, if disturbed. In its pupal or resting 
^tage it cannot help itself, and so it has this hard, shell- 
like skin, which, like all insect skins, is made of chitin. 

Some day you will find a strange and beautiful little 
object attached to a fence rail or a bush. It will be 
pale green with golden spots on it. It will be 
hard and smooth, and of a* strange shape. 

It will not look at all like a caterpillar 
or a butterfly, but you will know that it 
is the pupa of a Monarch butterfly. 

Some caterpillars are covered with 
hairs and some have spines on their 
bodies. But the pupa shell has no hairs, 
although it is sometimes supplied with 
sharp points. Sometimes it is very beautiful 
like a jewel, or, we might say, like a jewel case in 
which is inclosed the beautiful butterfly. 

The pupa of the butterfly has a name of its own. 
It is called a "chrysalis," or "chrysalid." Chrysalis 
comes from a Greek word meaning gold. So in its 
golden case the jewel lies. But not all chrysalids are 







golden, or pale 
green spotted 
¡öwith gold* Some are 
diill brown. 




know if the pupa ormnr^t move 
at all. Yes, if you touch it, it will sometimes 
move its abdomen. You can see the abdominal segments 
quite plainly as it hangs head down. You can also see 
the eyes if you look carefully, and the antennae and 
legs too, all soldered down into an immovable jacket. 

But soon it will be free. The chrysalid shell will 
split down the back, and out will come the butterfly 
that has been folded up inside. 

Under the chrysalid skin a wonderful trans- 
formation takes place: the form of the but- 
terfly gradually becomes perfected ; antennae, 
wing pads, legs, ¡ª all are there. 



In the beautiful green pupa case of the Monarch you 
can see in part what is taking place. 

In a few days the green shell will look darker and 
the veins on the tiny wings inside can be seen. Soon 
after this you can distinguish the bright colors of the 
wings. Such tiny wings ! not so long as the little pupa 
case. 

When the wings begin to shine through you must 
look often, for the coming out of the butterfly is close 
at hand. When the moment arrives the pupa shell will 
split open and out will drop a fat butterfly with tiny 
little wings. 

The Adult 

This fat butterfly will cling to the now empty pupa 
case with its slender, black legs. Then, before your 
very eyes, the soft little wing pads will lengthen and 
broaden and stiffen, the body will become slender, and 
in a few minutes there will be hanging from the empty 
pupa shell a perfect butterfly, ¡ª the adult as we call 
it, ¡ª opening and shutting its bright new wings. 

Now look at the pupa shell ! You will be astonished 
to see that it is no longer green with gold markings, 
but a little torn bag of thin, transparent chitin. 

When the butterfly has rested until those wonderful 
wings are fully expanded, away it flies, without learning 





how, just as though it had been flying all its life. 
Away it flies out into the lovely world it has 
never seen before. 

Ned says it did see the world ¡ª when it 
was a caterpillar. 
Ah, Ned! the caterpillar is not made for 
seeing. You have forgotten that its eyes are 
small and simple. 

Its one concern is to eat, and it doubtless finds its 
food not so much by seeing as by smelling. It can 
probably distinguish light from darkness, and perhaps 
can also see very near objects, but that may be all its 
eyes are capable of. 

It must await the wonderful transformation before it 
can really see the world. 

And now you will be interested to know that the wings 
of the butterfly are made of modified Q skin. 

The full-sized wings could not of ^^II course find 
room in the little pupa shell, and (^^L/^m A 

so they remain small and soft 
until they are free, when the air and 
moisture, rushing into them, stretch a 
them out into their perfect form. 'V [ 

Yes, Charlie, the butterfly imder- 
goes a complete metamorphosis. The 
larva is very unlike the adult, and it goet? into the' 






motionless pupa state, from which it emerges a trans- 
formed creature, as unUke the clumsy, creeping cater- 
pillar as you can imagine. 

You had better find some more of these caterpillars 
and take them home. Put a fresh milkweed stalk in 
a glass of water and the caterpillars will not leave it 
until they are ready to transform. As soon as one tries 
to leave the milkweed, put it in a box and it will soon 
become a chrysalid. It will take about a week for the 
chrysaUd to transform into a butterfly. 

Sometimes it happens that the caterpillar is not 
changed into a chrysalid. There is a fly on the watch. 
Although the Monarch caterpillar has such a disagree- 
able odor and taste that birds let it alone, yet this fly 
does not find it unpleasant. On the contrary it looks 
eagerly about for these caterpillars, and when it finds 
one it lays an egg or two in its body. 

That, as you may imagine, is the end of the poor 
caterpillar, although you would not suspect there was 
anything the matter. It eats and grows and finally 
hangs itself up to become a chrysalid. By this time 
the fly's larvaB, which have been living inside the cater- 
pillar, are ready to undergo their transformation. So 
out they come, little whitish maggots, that fall to the 
ground, into which they burrow, later to emerge as 
perfect flies. 





The poor caterpillar has been so nearly eaten up by 
these merciless, uninvited guests that it can only die. 

This is very often the fate of the Monarch cater- 
pillars that live out of doors. But if you are fortunate 
enough to get the eggs you will have nothing of the 
sort to fear. 

The Swallowtails 

Now let us go out again and 
take a run across the 
meadow. 

The golden-rod still 
lights the hedges, 
but where are the 
Monarchs ? 
What has become of the 
great Bwarm we saw a few 
days ago? 
Who can understand the ways of the Mon- 
archs ? Suddenly they appear in thousands ; the air is 
full of them. 

Then they disappear ; they have gone somewhere else 
and you only see one here and there. 
But to-day we have the Swallowtails. 
See ! on the edge of that pool are five or six of them 
sipping the water. 








Yes, Ned, they are called Swallowtails 
from the long, tail-like extensions on the 
hinder wings. 

Watch that one rise and sail away. 
It is a handsome little craft ; its sails are 
of yellow, banded with black. 

These yellow and black Swallowtails are 
called Turnus butterflies. 

Perhaps if we look on those weeds in 
the fence corner we may find the cater- 
pillar of the Turnus. 

Ah! here is one. Strange Jittle creature! 
Nell says it has big eyes like a fish. 
John declares that those spots 
are not its eyes. They are only 
marks on its body. 

See if you can find its tiny 
head ¡ª its little dots 
of eyes are not easy to 
find. 

Mabel thinks it is 
lying on a spider's web. 

No, Mabel, it is lying ^ 
on a bed of its own weav- 
ing. It made that little 
mattress of silk. 








Yes, the silk was first in a liquid form in the head of 
the caterpillar. It hardened into silk when the cater- 
pillar spun it out. 

Mabel says she knows of another Swallowtail, ¡ª a 
black one with yellow and blue markings on the wings. 
^:?^ That is the Black Swallowtail, 

^MC4: and it is a beauty. 
^"^^^ Besides the orange and yellow 

¡ª -^i" spots on its wings there are patches 
covered with shining blue or green scales. 
Oh, yes, indeed! the yellow spots are 
made of yellow scales. Rub off the scales 
and you have only a thin, papery, color- 
leyss wing left. 

The larva of the Black Swallowtail is 
the well-known green caterpillar, with 
black rings and yellow spots on it, that 
sometimes covers the leaves of the pars- 
nip or caraway plants. 
Mollie says she saw some in the fence corner yester- 
day. Let us go and get them. 

Are n't they gay fellows ! Why, why ! what is the 
matter ? 

Nell's caterpillar has horns! She poked it with a 
stick and it shot out two soft, yellow horns from behind 
its head. What a caterpillar ! 





The yellow horns are pretty on its green body, but, oh 
dear ! what an odor they give off ! It is fairly sickening. 

Ned says that it makes that vile odor for the same 
reason that the grasshopper makes molasses, ¡ª it wishes 
to be let alone. 

I think that is so. 

If you poke these larvae they will punish you. 

They wish to be let alone so that they can eat, eat, 
eat. 

Yes, May, I think they are so brightly colored because 
they want to be seen and recognized at once. 

No bird would eat such vile-smelling things, and they 
do not want a bird to mistake them for an edible cater- 
pillar and swallow them down before it discovers its 
mistake. So they shine out, bright flags of warning. 
Birds soon learn .^.^^^ to recognize vile-smelling 

caterpillars and ^^UJJ^*'^^--^ ^ l^t them alone. 

Here, under this ^t^^ll^sl^^'^^i^ twig, is the 
chrysalis of one of ^?^^^ our Swallow- 

tails. Strange little brown ^'^ object! 

Not only is it suspended by the two prolegs at the 
tail end, but it is also supported by a silken line 
thrown about its body. 

Evidently it does not wish to be blown away. 

We will take the chrysalid home and perhaps we 
shall see the butterfly come out of it. 






Watch the Swallowtail butterfly on that flower. 

It has six long, black legs. 

The Swallowtails do not belong to the Four-footed 
butterflies. 

We do not distinguish the butterflies by their legs so 
much as by their wings. 

Each species has its wings veined differently. 

It is very difficult to study the veining on the wings 
of the butterflies, ¡ª too difficult for us now, but some 
time you may want to do it. 



Sulphur Butterflies and Spring Azures 

Little Nell says she knows where there are some little 
yellow butterflies. She sees them every day clustered 
around a wet spot by the roadside. 

Oh, yes, here they are ! They are the Sulphur butter- 
flies. We see them everywhere in the 
summer time, for they love to hover 
about wet places. Sometimes dozens 
of them will stand around a mud 
puddle. The little larvae feed on 
clover. 
?r There goes a white one. That 
J¡ì^^^^^^i-H^^<;' is a Cabbage butterfly, ¡ª a pretty 
^"^ * little nuisance. 






Mollie wants to 
know why it is a 
nuisance. 

John says he can guess* 
He thinks the larvae feed on cab- 
bage leaves. 

They do, and that is why it 
is called the Cabbage butterfly. The 
next time you go into the garden, examine the 
cabbages to see if there are wormholes in them. If 
so, you wUl doubtless be able to find a little cater- 
pillar, just the color of the cabbage leaf, with yellow 
bands running the length of its body, ¡ª that is the 
larva of the Cabbage butterfly. 

It is not always easy to find these larvae, for they 
burrow into the very heart of the cabbage, where it is 
tenderest and juiciest, and also where they do the most 
harm. 

The Sulphur and Cabbage butterflies do not belong 
to the Four-footed butterflies, but, like the Swallowtails, 
their chrysalids are lashed fast by a silken cord. 

Another lovely little roadside frequenter is the Spring 
Azure. It is much smaller than the Cabbage butterfly, 
and gets its name from its color. 

Azure, you know, means blue, ¡ª sky color, ¡ª and 
these daintiest of butterflies are of this color. 




They are like flower petals fluttering in the sunshine. 

They, too, like wet places, and, as in the case of the 
Cabbage butterfly, you will sometimes find great num- 
bers of them grouped about a wet place in the road. 

They flutter up, a shining company, when any one 
approaches them. 

The under side of their lovely wings is pearly gray 
or white, with tiny black spots. 

Yes, indeed, Charlie, there are a very great many 
species of butterflies. 

Some are large and some are small. Some are 
bright in color and some are dull. But they are all 
beautiful. 

Yes, May, they all began life as caterpillars. Every 
butterfly was first a lowly, nearly blind, creeping 
caterpillar. 




MOTHS 



The Luna Moth 

Here is John with a prize. 

He found it by the roadside, and he says it is, a 
pea-green Swallowtail butterfly. 

What a beauty ! 

Little Nell says that it has windows in its wings. 

The round wing spots are transparent like glass, and 
they are bordered with beautiful bright-colored scales. 




But, John, this is not a butterfly ; it is a moth. 
MoUie says she always thought moths were little 
gray things that ate our clothes. 

Ah, but there are a great many kinds of moths, 
Mollie. Some are tiny gray things and some are very 
large and handsome, like this one. 
How do I know that it is a moth? 
There are several ways to tell the moths from the 
butterflies. One way is by the antennae. You remem* 
ber that the antenna of the butterfly is thread- 
like, with a knob at the end. 

Now look at the antennae of our beauti- 
ful green moth. You see they are flat and 
broad and are fringed along the sides like 
little feathers. 

No, not all moths have feathered antennae, 
but no moths have antennae with knobs at the tips. 
Another way to tell the moths from the 
butterflies is by the manner in which they 
h(4d their wings. 
When the butterfly is at rest it holds 
its wings close together and straight 
up over its back. 

Yes, Nellie, that is why it is so easy 

to pick up a butterfly by the wings. 

The moth does not hold its wings up in this way. 










Some moths, like the one John has here, 
allow the wmgs to lie out flat. 

Others fold them down on the sides of the 
body, making a sort of tent roof over the 
back, as shown in this picture. 

Another difference is that butterflies fly in the day- 
time, while most of the moths appear at night or in the 
dusk. They flutter about the iiight-bloomiiig 
flowers, from which they extract nectar. 

This exquisite creature that John has 
brought us is the Luna moth. 

Luna is the Latin word for moon, and [^ 
it is derived from a word mean- 
ing to shine. 

This, then, is the shining 
moth, the moth of the moon, 
¡ª or we might call it the moonlight moth. 

May says she thinks it is mysterious and lovely like 
moonlight. 

Yes, and it flits about in the moonlight. 

Mabel says that of all the beautiful insects she has 
seen she thinks the Luna moth is the loveliest. 

And Ned thinks that nothing else so well deserves 
its name. 

Beautiful Luna! 

See what wonderful colors are in the wings. 






Its eye spots, or wing windows, are edged with red 
and yellow, and it has a margin of purple along the 
outer edge of the front wings. 

Its legs are a dull purple-red, and its body is heavily 

dressed in a coat of snow-white down, while its wings 

are an exquisite pale green color ; but no 

words can describe the beauty 

of this moth. 

Yes, Mayj moths belong to the 

same order as the butter- 

^ flies, ¡ª to the Lepidoptera. 

Nell says that our Luna is fuzzier than a butterfly. 

The moths are generally thicker and fuzzier than 

the butterflies. 

John wants to know from what kind of a caterpillar 
the Luna comes. 

It is a large caterpillar, as you would expect, and it 
is a handsome one. It is over three inches long when 
fully grown, and it is pale green in color, ¡ª not quite the 
color of the wings of the moth, but rather more bluish. 
It has a light yellow stripe running the length of its 
body on each side, and there are yellow bars across its 
back, with tufts of hairs growing from the top of each 
segment. 

Now see Ned's eyes sparkle! He has one of these 
caterpillars in a box in his pocket to show us. What 





a gorgeous great fellow ! And how plainly the spiracks 
show on its sides ! 

It feeds on the leaves of forest trees, and when it is 
ready to become a pupa it does not attach itself by the 
prolegs to some strong support and there transform in 
the open air. 

Oh, no ; this larva spins itself a snug cradle of silk. 

We call this cradle of the moth a ^' cocoon." ? 

Many species of moths make cocoons, though there 
are some that do not. 

The Luna likes to weave its cocoon on the ground 
among the fallen leaves, which it wraps about the 
outside of the cocoon. If you look under the trees in 
the fall of the year, 
may find some of the 
cocoons of the 

Luna moth ¡ª ^^??^^i'?/?^;^l'^^ 

lying like ripe "~^::: ^1;^^ M m |^^ f 

fruit on the grouinl " 

The Silk Moth 

Yes, John, the silkworm is the larva of a moth. 
It is really not a worm but a caterpillar. 

It is a very old friend of man ; for ages it has been 
cultivated for its silk, and the cocoon of this caterpillar 
is the source of our beautiful silk cloths. 





The silkworm ¡ª to use ita Gommon 
rjative of China, where for centurie^^ 
raised with 



name ¡ª is a 
it has been 
the great- 
est care, 
80 that it 
has changed 
very 
much 




animal It 
kind of mill 



in color and in the 

quality of its silk. 
In short, it has be- 
come a domestic 
feeds on the leaves of a certain 
berry tree that is also foimd in 
China. Of course the silkworm is no longer confined to 
China, but is raised in other parts of the world, ¡ª in Italy, 
for instance, whole families devoting all their time to 
the care of the silkworm. Even the little children help. 

Here is the pic- 
ture of a 

""¡ª ^^--^ It is a light<3olored 
caterpillar and it is about the size shown here. 





Yes, Mollie, it has a 
queer wrinkled hump on \ 
its back, but in spite of 
that it is rather a dainty 
looking little creature, 
and a great eater, as 
all caterpillars are. V^ 

When full grown 
the caterpillars weave a 
thick, smooth, roundish 
cocoon of very strongs fine 
threads which are pale yellow 
or white in color. 

Here is a picture of this cocoon, \ 'M^ my dears. 
As you can see, it is not much larger .f :^ than your 
mother's thimble, and yet from it / :^a^ can be un- 
wound a silken thread two miles ^ w long! 

This thread is indeed delicate! It is so fine that 
you can hardly see it, and within this wonderful cradle 
made of this fine silk lies a very dainty little pupa that 

finally becomes a pale and pretty 

moth, as you see here. 

It is creamy white in 

color, with some faint 

brownish lines on the wings. 

Only a few of the moths are allowed 



to come forth in a silk-raising establishment, ¡ª just 
enough to supply plenty of eggs for future use. 

The reason is not far to seek. If the moth emerges 
the cocoon is torn and the silk ruined. So after the 
cocoons are made they are heated hot enough to kill 
the pupae within. 

Before the silk is unwound the cocoon has to be 
soaked in boiling water to dissolve the gummy sub- 
stance that fastens the dehcate threads together and 
makes the cocoon waterproof to protect the little in- 
mate against wet weather. 

The silk used to be unwound by hand, but it is now 
done dexterously by machinery. 

The threads may be bleached or dyed any color that 
is desired. 

Silk cloth is not woven of single threads, but the 
fine threads are twisted together into coarser, stronger 
ones, though some of these are still very fine. More 
and more strands are twisted together to make coarser 
threads for weaving, and, also for making sewing 
silks. 

Our little silkworm is one of the most valuable of our 
insect friends, and its cocoons are every year worth 
many millions of dollars. 

Mabel wants to know if we could not use the silk 
from the cocoon of the Luna moth. 



No, the Luna moth makes a thin cocoon that contains 
very little silk, not enough to be of use. 

We have a large native moth, however, whose silk is 
sometimes used, but this silk is not so fine and beautiful 
as that of the silkworm. 

The Polyphemus 

The name of this native silk moth is the Polyphemus. 

Fortunately I have one of them to show you. 

Charlie thinks it is almost as beautiful as the Luna. 

It is yellowish brown in color, 
you see, with beau- 
tiful markings on 
the wings. 

Yes, like the 
Luna it has a little 
windowlike spot ¡ª 
"eye spot" it is called ¡ª on each 
of its wings. 

Its copoon looks like tliat of the 
Luna, but it contains much more silk. 

The caterpillar feeds on the leaves of 
forest and fruit trees, and it too rolls a 
leaf about its cocoun, weaving a strong 
band of silk about the twig to which the 
leaf grows, so that when the leaf is ready to 






fall it cannot do so. The cocoon hangs dangling to the 
tree, though sometimes it is made among the leaves on 
the ground. 

The Cecropia 

Another of these large cocoon-making moths common 

among us is the Cecropia. 
See tills one that flew into 
the sitting room 
one night. Is it 
not a wonder! It 
has on a red and 
white velvet coat, and 
its brown wings are beau- 
tifully marked with red 
and black and gray and white. 
Noj it has no windowlike spots 
in its wings, but it has a large, 
white, crescent-shaped spot, bordered 
with red and black, on each wing. 
It is a fuzzy fellow. 
And here, my dears, is its larva. 
Did you ever see such a big caterpillar ? And really 
it is very handsome. 

See the tubercles along its body. Do they not, make 
you think of the buttons on a gorgeous uniform ? 



Those near the head are like red coral, and see ! some 
of the others are bright blue and some yellow. 

No, it will not hurt you. 

You can let it walk on your hand. 

What is that, May,- ¡ª you wouldn't let it walk on 
your hand for anything in the world? 

Well, I don't believe it wants to walk on your hand. 

Now I will tell you what to do with it. 

Put it in a large box with netting over the top. Give 
it fresh apple or oak leaves every day ¡ª all it can eat. 

After a few days something will happen. 

Spinning 

Something is happening in the box with the Cecropia 
caterpillar. 

A large silken cocoon is growing like magic there. 

The larva has done eating ; it has become a spinner, 
¡ª a weaver, industrious, wonderful. 

See it toss its head about. A glistening thread follows 
wherever that little head moves. 

The silk is within the caterpillar in the form of a 
liquid. 

This liquid silk is drawn out in a fine thread through 
a spinning apparatus in the upper lip. 

The upper lip is modified to form a spinneret. 






As soon as the fine thread of liquid silk comes in 
contact with the air it hardens. 

Fine as it is, it is surrounded by a gummy substance 
that causes the threads to stick together. 

Thus supplied with plenty of the best of materials 
made in its own little body, our weaver is eager to 
work. 

It touches its lip to the side of the box ¡ª the thread 
clings there. It throws its head to the other side of the 
cocoon and again fastens the thread. 
Thus back and forth it weaves, the glistening threads 
quickly fallinfj into place. 

It makes an outer shell of silk smeared thick with 

the gummy substance to keep out the wet. 

Then it weaves a looser layer of soft, silken 

threads, and finishes by a close-woven 

cover to its body. 

No wonder you love to watch this 
matchless weaver, who spins his 
thread as he uses it and makes 
this strong, brown cocoon. 

By to-morrow he will be 

almost lost to view and in 

four or five days the cradle 

of the moth will be finished. 

What happens next ? 






Could you look within the silken walls, you would see 
strange things. 

The caterpillar that retired from our view soon dis- 
appears forever. 

A caterpillar went in, but a caterpillar will never 
come out again. 

If we could see through the cocoon a few days after 
it is spun, we should find a little shriveled-up mass, the 
skin of the caterpillar. But that 
is not aU. In front of it 
we should see, in place of 
the caterpillar, a pupa. 

Look carefully at the 
pupa. It bears hints of 
coming moth. 

The abdominal segments are plainly to be seen, with 
their large spiracles. 

The thorax, too, is distinguishable. 

Look close! see the antennae soldered down to the 
front of the thorax ! 

Legs, too, you can get a hint of, and the wing' pads 
show plainly, all tightly fastened down. 

This pupa hes motionless before us. It is hard and 
brown, but it is not dead. 

Touch it, and it will show that it is alive ; it will move 
its abdominal segments back and forth. 







That is the only motion it can make. 
You see the pupa of the moth looks like the chrys- 
alid of the butterfly. It is shaped very much like it, 
only it 13 heavier and clumsier looking, and I 
^lo not think the pupa of the moth is ever 
brightly colored like the 
pupa or chrysalid of cer- 
tain of the butterflies. 
We can take the pupa 
from the cocoon, if we 
are careful, and look at 
it and return it to its 
cradle without harming 
it. It will still transform. 
These cocoons are made in the fall of 
the year and the pupa lies through the 
winter in its snug cradle, but it knows 
when spring comes. An astonishing 
change then comes over it. 
The dark brown pupa shell is burst asunder, the silk 
at one end of the cocoon is moistened, the threads are 
pushed aside or broken, and out of the open prison the 
beautiful moth comes forth. 

It has left its dry, chitinous pupa shell in the cocoon* 
It clings to the cocoon or to the nearest object until its 
small wing pads expand and its wings harden; then 





when night spreads a curtain of darkness over the earth 
it will fly about. 

The caterpillar of the Cecropia, as yqu see, builds a 



ooloi\ 
attached to tree 



tent-shaped cocoon, dark brown in 

You can find these little tents 
twigs in the fall of the year. 

The Cecropia does not usually 
wrap a leaf about its cocoon 
like the Polyphemus, and it 
attaches the cocoon firmly to 
twigs, so that 
it is not often 
seen lying on 
ground. 

The Prometh 

The Prometlj 
another of the 
Silkworms, as tl 
cocoon-making moths are 

sometimes called. It is not as large, however, as our 
Polyphemus or Cecropia. 

It looks a little like a smaller edition of the Cecropia, 
and it is the most abundant of all these large moths. 

We often see its cocoons hanging on lilac bushes. 





It is a very pretty cocoon, wrapped in a leaf; but Pro- 
metheus is far more careful of herself than is Luna. 

She is not going to he on the ground among the 
fallen leaves! She carefully winds silk all over the 
stem of the leaf and around the twig to which the leaf 
grows. 

Thus she ties the leaf to its own twig, as Poly- 
phemus often does, and all winter long the little 
cocoon swings back and forth in the wind. 

The pupa inside lies safe, 
waiting for the 



The Io 

Ah, Charlie ! you have 
something to show us. 

It is another of the Giant 
Silkworms, ¡ª it is the Io 
moth. 

You see it has red fore 
wings, which shows that it is a female moth. The male 
Io is yellow, and he is a good deal smaller than the female. 
Yes, May, the male insect is often quite different in 
appearance from the female, and he is almost always 
smaller. 

You will find the males of the butterflies and moths 
noticeably smaller than the females as a rule, and the 
female moths have \ narrower antennsB than the males. 

Iti is a ^^ wicked-looking 

It is covered all over 

s^harp prickles that 

sting like nettles if 

you touch them. 

Yes, that is its method of 

protecting itself. 

You may be sure it does

down each of its sides. Most children know them and 
are careful not to touch them. 

No, John, not many of the caterpillars are as well 
protected as our venomous lo ; that is, they are not so 
well protected from us. 

A good many of them are gifted with a bad flavor 
that keeps the birds at bay, and little Nell says truly 
that like the grasshoppers a good many of them "make 
molasses " and spit it out on oiu- fingers when we touch 
them. 

The Woolly Bear 

No, Mabel, not all moths make cocoons, though a good 
many do. 

Butterflies never make cocoons. 
You can get some very beautiful moths by collecting 
cocoons and keeping them until the moths come out. 

Look for them all summer, but particularly in the fall 
of the year. , 

Be careful not to mistake a case of spider's eggs for 
--__^ a cocoon. 

^ The case in which the spider 

/ r lays its eggs sometimes looks 
very much like a little cocoon, for 
cocoons are not always large. 
What do you suppose hatches out 






of the little fuzzy cocoons we so often see in fence 
corners ? 

See, John has one of these little cocoons. 

They are not made wholly of silk. They are made 
of felt, like a felt hat, you know. The caterpillar takes 
the hairs from its own body and with a little silk and 
gum mats them together into a feltlike substance. 

John says it must be a hairy caterpillar that 
does this. Yes, it is our little friend the 
Woolly Bear. You all know tlie fellow witli 
a heavy coat of fur, black at 
the head and tail ends and 
tawny in the middle, and that 
suddenly curls up when you 
touch him. 

We often see him hastening along the 
paths in the fall of the year. 

His real name is the Isabella Tiger moth. 

A near relative to this one is the Yellow Bear, a very 
common caterpillar indeed, with a coat of long, yellow 
hairs. 

It also makes its cocoon out of its own hairs, and 
the moth that emerges is the snowy white little miller 
with black dots on its wings, that we sometimes sur- 
prise into daylight flight when we walk in the grass or 
among the bushes. 








Millers and Other Moths 

^^ Oh, indeed, there are a great many 
species of inothB, Some are large and 
V^ some are smalL Some make cocoons 
and some do not. Some come from 
smooth caterpillars and some from hairy 
or prickly ones. 
We call the smaller moths millers. 
You all know the millers. 

Most of the moths drop their wings down 
roof -like over their backs when they 
^^^f are not flying. Very few, except the 
^f Giant Silkworms, keep their wings 
spread. No, not all moths have feathery 
antemue. Some have long, slim ones, 
bnt without knobs at the ends. 
Knobbed antennae belong to the but- 
terflies, you know. There are 
many, many moths, ¡ª and just 



as many caterpillars. In the summer time caterpil- 
lars seem to be everywhere, ¡ª green ones and brown 
ones, striped and streaked and spotted and speckled 
ones, smooth ones and fuzzy ones, spiny and prickly ones, 
bright ones and dull ones, tufted ones and humpbacked 
ones, large ones and small ones, ¡ª and they all eat, 
eat, eat the green leaves, or the fruits, or the bark, 
or the wood. 

Some we can pick up, others have a very bad odor, 
and others again are covered with prickles that sting 
like nettles. 

Some moths are our good friends, like those that give 
us silk ; others do us no harm ; but a good many are 
very destructive to vegetation while in the larval state. 

The Akmy Worm and Tent Caterpillar 

Yes, May, the Army worms are caterpillars. They 
are not worms. 

We often see caterpillars that we call Army worms, 
but we do not notice them particularly luiless they 
occur in very large numbers. 

This caterpillar is about an inch and a half long and 
is striped with yellow and black. It has no hairs on its 
body, therefore we say it is naked. 

You know why the Army worm has its name. 





Yes, Ned, it sometimes appears in countless numbers, 
¡ª an army that goes marching over the fields destrojdng 
everything before it. An army of these caterpillars is 
a terrible sight to the farmer. 

The miller that comes from the Army worm is dull 
brown with a white spot on each fore wing. 

Another troublesome larva is the Tent caterpillar. 
You have seen its tents many a time in the apple trees. 
When these tents are first made they are often quite 
handsome, but ; the caterpillars, unlike the spiders, 
housekeepers. They take no, pains 
to keep their web clean, and it 
soon becomes very- 
dirty and disagreeable 
to look at. 

These caterpillars 
are social in their 
habits; they do not 
wander far from home. 

night they all return 
to the tent they have made. 
h you suppose they talk over 
events of the day? 
They are often seen hanging from 
the leaf by a thread of silk. 

Wherever the Tent caterpillar goes it spins its thread. 





Perhaps it does so in order to find its way 
home at night. I do not think it can see where 
to go with its tiny, simple eyes. 

It may use the thread as Ariadne used the 
clue to help Theseus find his way out of 
the labyrinth. 

Do you know the story of Ariadne and the 
labyrinth? Get somebody to tell it to you. 

The Tent caterpil j^ lars are very destructive to 

farmers dread them and 
with torches when the cater-

that come from these cat- 
close together on a twig and 
stance that protects them from

The brown moths

cater pillars 

They travel 




along the twigs and 
branches until they 
find a fork that 
suits them. 

Here they 
make their 

tent and eat the buds and young leaves of the tree. 
Is it not wonderful how the moths and butterflies 






remember just what kind of leaves the larvae must have 
to eat ? The butterfly and the moth eat nothing but 
honey or fruit juice. The caterpillars need certain kinds 
of leaves. 

Each butterfly, each moth, remembers to lay the eggs 
on or near the right kind of plant, so that when the 
little caterpillars hatch out they will have food. 

You see they provide for their young although they 
pay no attention to them after the eggs are once laid. 

John says he thinks all insects provide 
for their young. 

Very true, John; but some are more 
careful parents than others. 

However, all remem- 
ber to lay the eggs in 
places that are suitable fur 
the young. 

The Measuring Worm 

What is little Nell looking at so care- 
fully? 

She has a Measuring worm on her finger. 

May thinks it should be called a " measuring 
caterpillar.'' 

It certainly is a caterpillar, 

What a cunning fellow! 




See how industriously it is measuring little Nell's 
finger. There it goes! 

No, it has not fallen to the ground. It is suspended 
in mid-air by a cord of silk. 

The Measuring worms are cautious travelers. They 
are always provided with a silken cable to catch them 
in case they fall. 

May has just discovered that the Measuring worm 
has no prolegs in the middle of its body. 

John says that is why it walks in loops. 

Having no legs in the middle, it draws those at the 
tail end close up to those at the head end and humps 
up its back at every step. 

No, it has not as many prolegs as the 
other caterpillars. Generally it has 
only four instead of ten. 

Have you ever seen a little /^ 7 
brown Measuring worm / ^ ] 
standing on its hind feet, its , \\' . w 
body stiff and straight like 
a little dead twig on a bush ? 

Yes, you all know what that 
means. Little Loop worm has no idea of being swal- 
lowed by a bird, so all day long he stands reared up 
on end and " plays possum/' but when night comes he 
gets down and goes to feeding in the safe darkness. 



The moths of the Measuring worms are dainty little 
creatures that fly up when we go for a walk in the 
woods or fields. 

Many of these moths do us no harm, but others are 
very troublesome, as the Cankerworm, which is the 
most destructive of all the Measuring worms. 

The innocent- ^^^^ V y looking little 

moth lays her ^^^^^^^^^^^ff" ^ggs on fruit or 
shade trees, and ^K^^rw^^^ when they hatch 
the little caterpil ^^^--^ ^K^^ lo^^g proceed to eat 
the leaves of the tree on which they find themselves. 

When full grown they let themselves down from the 
tree by their silk thread and bury themselves in the 
ground to pass the pupal stage. 

One kind of Cankerworm makes a little cocoon 
down in the ground; the other kind just hollows out 
a place and transforms without troubling itself to make 
a cocoon. 

Ned wants to know how the moth finds its way to 
the upper world again. He says he should not think 
it could dig its way out of the ground without soiling 
its wings. 

No, it could not. 

It comes to the surface of the earth while it is still 
a hard, smooth pupa. It wriggles up by moving its 
abdominal segments. 



There is something very curious about the Canker- 
worms. The female moths have rudimentary wings, 
and so of course they cannot fly. 

They have to climb up the tree to lay their eggs on 
the branches. 

People sometimes paint a ring of tar or some other 
sticky substance around the trunks of their trees and 
thus prevent the moth from going up to lay the eggs. 

The Gypsy Moth 

No, John, we cannot get rid of the Gypsy moth so 
easily. It has, you know, become a serious nuisance in 
New England. 

It did not originally belong to this country, but was 
brought here from Europe. 

The female lays the eggs in a^*; 
mass and covers them with hairs f rom^ 
her own body. k^ 

She is quite a pretty little mothj ^^-^-^ 
with dark markings on her wings. 

The caterpillar of the Gypsy moth is quite a gay 
looking brigand. If it were not so troublesome a ma- 
rauder, we might admire its black body striped with 
yellow lines and ornamented with red and yellow tuber- 
cles bearing stiff, black hairs. 






A large force of men have to be hired each spring 
to collect and destroy the egg clusters and cocoons 
of the Gypsy moth from the trees in the parks of 
Boston and in many adjoining towns. 



The Codlin Moth 

Caterpillars cause us very great trouble. We have to 
be constantly fighting some of them in order to have 
anything to eat ourselves. 

Some species eat our vegetables, others our grains, 
and yet others our fruits. 

There is the Codlin moth, for instance. You may not 
know the moth itself, but you all know its larva, the 
little white " worm " at the cores of apples. 

It bores into the apple through the bud, eats all it 
wants, and when ready to transform, bores out through 
the side of the apple. This larva 
does look very much like a worm, 
but it is not a worm. 

Because it has lived in apple 
cores for so many generations its 
legs are very small and weak. 

But, you see, it transforms into 
a moth, so it cannot be a worm. 
If you keep the larva from a 




wormy apple for some time and give it plenty to eat, 
you may have a chance to watch it spin its little 
cocoon. The next spring, early, out of the cocoon will 
come a very dainty, lovely little moth dressed in pearly 
gray or rose pink robes. 

It looks far too beautiful to be mischievous. 

But be not deceived ! 

This elegant little fairy, if she gets the chance, will 
lay an egg in the bud end of the young apple soon after 
the petals have fallen, and there will be another wormy 
apple to testify to the activity of the Codlin moth. 

The Leaf Rollers 

See here ! Who do you suppose rolled 
this leaf up in that clever fashion ? 

Let us unroll it. Ah! that is easier 
said than done. See ! it has been fastened 
together by threads of silk. But in spite 
of that let us imroll it and find out, if we 
can, who this Leaf roller is. 

Ah ! I thought so. See that little 
caterpillar scurry back out of sight. 
He is very much frightened to have 
his home thus invaded. He rolls himself up in a 
leaf to hide from the light and then he is also 



safer from hungry birds and preying insects. Very 
many of the Leaf rollers eat the leaves which they roll 
about themselves. 

It must be very convenient to wrap yourself up and 
then find your blankets good to eat when you are 
hungry. 

May says that the edges of these blankets are bound 
with silk just like the edge of the blanket that mother 
made for baby. 

Look closely at this, all of you, and I think you will 
see a difference. 

See, May ; the caterpillars do indeed fasten the edges 
of the leaf together with silk, but they do not sew 
through and through as mother did, making a pretty 
silken binding. 

Some species fasten several leaves together, forming 
quite a web. Some of them mine into the leaf, making 
tunnels all over it. 

Oh, yes, you have all seen these leaves rolled up or 
embroidered by the caterpillars, and sometimes the work 
is done by the tiniest of tiny larvae that transform into 
minute but very beautiful little moths. 

Of course you all remember that caterpillars are 
larvce, and that the larva is the first stage of the insect 
after it comes out of the egg. 





The Sphinx Moth 



Listen ! What sound is that we hear ? 

Mollie says it is a humming bird. 

Let us look, ¡ª there, in the trumpet flower over 
the fence. 

Is it a humming bird ? 

No, it is a Humming-bird moth. 

What a pretty thing ! See it poise before the flower 
on steady, whirring wings. How quickly it darts about ! 

It has very strong wings, ¡ª stronger than any other 
moth, although some Hawk moths are small. Because 
of its strong wings it is also called the Hawk moth, for 
hawks, you know, have great strength of wing. 

These moths usually fly in the twilight, though we 
sometimes see one in the daytime. 






These moths, I think, have the longest tongues of any 
of the Lepidoptera. Such tongues can reach to the 
bottom of the flowers that have the longest tubes. 

Yes, John, these are also called Sphinx moths. 

The reason is ^^mm,. rather curious. 

The Egyptian f ^K Sphinx, jou remember, is 
a great stone f f/\ 1 image half buried m the 
sands of the V 7 J desert. It has the body 
of a lion and J the face of a woman. 




It is a great mytjtery t.L>Tj|7 ^he modern world, though 
no doubt it was once a temple built by the ancient 
Egyptians for the worship of their gods. 

Of course you cannot understand why any one should 
be reminded of the Hawk moth when thinking of the 
Sphinx of Egypt. 

Indeed, the resemblance is very fanciful and refers 
not to the moth but to the queer-acting larva, which is 
really a great beauty. When disturbed or when it is 
resting it rears up in a ridiculous manner, and people 
have imagined it looks like the Sphinx ! 


I do not think it does ; but at least it is mysterious, 
like the Sphinx. 

It goes down into the ground to 
transform. The pupa is dark brown 
and is large, as you 
would expect. You 
may see it by saving the 
caterpillars and letting 
them transform in a box 
of earth. 

Some species transform 
above ground in little shel- 
ters made by fastening 
leaves together with 
silk. Silk is certainly very convenient for the cater- 
pillars. Many of them are always ready with a supply. 

No, Ned, the butterfly and moth cannot make silk ; 
that power belongs exclusively to the larva. 

The large, green Tomato worm is the larva of one of 

our largest and hand- 
somest Sphinxes. 
Its pupa is often 
plowed up in gardens 
and can be recognized quickly because the tongue case 
is not soldered down to the body, as in other pupae, but is 
free, like a handle. 




The Sphinxes are very handsome creatures, though 
their upper wings are not brilliantly colored. They are 
rather sober-looking brown moths and carry their wings 
folded down over their bodies. 

You need to look closely to see how beautiful these 
sober-hued wings are. The Sphinxes are at their best 
when flying, for what is prettier than a Humming-bird 
moth hovering in front of a flower? 

Other Brown Moths 

There are a great many big brown 
moths that are not Sphinxes. 

They often fly in at the window at night 
and insist upon singeing their wings over 
the flame of the lamp. 

Sometimes we see them resting on the 
wall in the morning, ¡ª those that have escaped being 

burned, ¡ª their wings 
like long, brown cloaks 
about them, folded over 
their backs, as is the fashion 
of the moths. 
But if they raise their upper 
wings, these brown moths are no longer dull. 

The under wings are often gayly trimmed with 
bright colors, ¡ª red and yellow and white. 





The Clothes Moth 

What eats holes in our best clothes and rums our 
furs? 

Nobody needs an introduction to the silvery little 
rascal that invades every home and causes us to worry 
over cedar chests, camphor, or moth 
balls as soon as winter is over. ^SL^^^^^^J^^ 

And yet if you were to see one of ^^^^ 




these little pests under the microscope, 

you could not help admiring it. / 

Its tiny wings are bordered with lovely fringes and 
covered with silvery scales. No fairy could be more 
daintily dressed. 

The little moths themselves do no harm ; it is their 
larvae that feed on our clothes. 

The eggs are laid on woolen cloth or fur. They 
hatch into tender little caterpillars that creep about in 
the dark, eating holes in the clothes. 

They spin a tube as they go ¡ª that is, some of them 
do ¡ª and mix bits of cloth with their own silk. In 
this tube a wonderful transformation takes place when, 
instead of a creeping caterpillar, there presently emerges 
a winged creature. 

Those that do not build tubes make a tiny silken 
cocoon in which to transform. 







The Flannel Moth and Meal Moth 

If the Clothes moths eat wool, here is a fellow who 
looks as if he were made of wool. See, it is the 
Flannel moth, and surely if ever an insect was well 
named, it is this one. 

Yes, it is very pretty with its cream- 
colored body and its fuzzy wings. 

The caterpillars of these moths differ 
from all other caterpillars by having an 
extra number of prolegs. 
Instead of ten prolegs they have fourteen. Yes, Nell, 
they have seven pairs of prolegs instead of five pairs. 

They make queer-looking cocoons, too, ¡ª queer not 
only in shape, but opening by a sort of trap i door. 
Here is one of them. 

Another which is almost as com- 
mon in our houses as the Clothes 
moth is the Indian-meal moth, 
whose larva gets into meal and 
dried fruits. This little, whitish, 
wormlike creature not only eati^ 
meal but spins delicate silken tubes all through them. 
Yes, indeed, we are all familiar with the traces of 
these little nuisances, though we may not know by sight 
the little moth that comes from the troublesome visitors. 




our fruit and 






The Skippers 

Just see the strange-looking caterpillar Amy 
has brought us! 

What a remarkably large head and long neck 
it has ! She found it rolled up in a leaf, 

I think it is the larva of one of the 
Skippers. These dark-colored little 
fellows seem to belong to both the 
butterflies and the moths. 

They fly in the daytime, which is like the butterflies, 
but they have stout bodies like the moths. 

Their antennaa are like those of the butterflies, except- 
ing that there is usually a little sharp tip beyond the 
knob, and they hold their wings like them. 

The pupa of the Skippers resembles the pupa of the 
moth, and the larva builds a slight cocoon, which is 

very decidedly a moth 
characteristic. 
Oh, yes, the Skippers are 
common enough, Ned. 
Do you not remember the brown 
butterfies that dart suddenly from 
a bush as you walk along ? 
They flash ahead and are resting on 
another bush so quickly that we cannot 





see what has become of them miless we are very 
attentive indeed. 

It is their habit of making these short, swift flights 
that has given them their name. 

They have big heads and their brown wings have 
white patches on them, and often patches through 
which the light shows. 

The Bagworm Moth 

Little Nell has foimd a caddice worm crawling on a 
tree. 

How very remarkable ! 

See, does it not look like a caddice ? 

^ No, indeed, it is not one. It is 
the queerest of the moths and its 
name of Bagworm moth is well 
bestowed. 

The larva makes its bag of silk 
and little twigs and moves about 
until it is full grown. 

Then it fastens its bag to a twig. 

One often sees these queer little 

cases dangling like so many brown 

tassels from the twigs of a tree. 

Within the bag the pupa forms and 





the moth comes out. But the female moth never leaves 
the home of her infancy. 

She has no wings, so when she emerges from the 
pupa case she remains within the bag. 

Here the eggs are laid, and when they hatch the 
little caterpillars creep out and each makes a tiny bag 
for itself. 

As it grows it enlarges the bag at the open end. 

The males come out of the bags as soon as they leave 
the pupa case, for they have wings with which to fly. 

Collecting Caterpillars 

Indeed, May, there is no end to the moths and 
butterflies. 

We might study them for years and yet we should 
not know them all. 

The best we have been able to do is to make the 
acquaintance of some of the more common ones, and 
of course in learning about them we have learned 
to know something of the habits of all Lepidop- 
tera, for in a general way they are alike. 

A very pleasant way to make the acquaint- 
ance of the butterflies and moths is to collect 
the caterpillars wherever you find them and take 
them home and keep them to look at. 







Towards the end of summer and in the autumn we 
often see large caterpillars wandering about apparently 
going nowhere. In reality they are seeking a place in 
which to metamorphose. They have done eating larval 
food forever. They will never consume another leaf. 
The silk glands in the heads of those that spin are 
now full to overflowing. 

If you take these wandering ones and put them in a 
box of earth, you may have the pleasure of owning some 
very beautiful butterflies and moths. Give them plenty 
of room and fresh air and at least six inches of good 
clean earth. 

If they are cocoon makers they will soon begin to 

\{ spin ; if they are not they will attach themselves to the 

^ sides of the box and become chrysalids, or they will 

burrow down into the ground, there to undergo the 

great change. 

Yes, indeed, Charlie ; another good way is to collect 
the caterpillars with a supply of the leaves on which 
they are feeding. 

Keep them well fed in the box of earth and do not 
forget to give them a drop of water occasionally. Cat- 
erpillars are thirsty creatures and eagerly drink up a 
few drops of water sprinkled on the leaves. 

The substance of the leaf itself does not seem to con- 
tain quite enough moisture to satisfy them, and it is 






I' 






quite interest- 
ing to watch 
the little mouths 
search around 
near the drop of water until it is 
found, when it is quickly sucked up. 
Of course the box in which the cat- 
,¡ª L tME^ erpillars are kept will need to be covered 
yS'Vl ^*th a piece of netting to prevent the 

captives from walking off when they have 
done eating and are ready to hunt up a good 
place in which to transform. 

There is no pleasanter way of amusing oneself out of 
doors in the fall of the year than in hunting for the 
caterpillars and watching them prepare for their winter 
sleep. Later in the season ¡ª in October and November, 
and indeed all through the winter ¡ª we can hunt for the 
cocoons attached to the twigs of trees, or dangling on 
slender cords from bushes, or safely tucked away in 
fence corners, the crevices of old stone walls, under 
piazza roofs, or anywhere else where protection is 
afforded to the helpless occupants of the cocoons. 



Yes, May, it is much more interesting to go walking 
with some object in. view. Even in the winter months 
when the snow is deep on the ground we can enjoy the 
woods and fields, and even then we can add to our store 
of cocoons. It is only necessary to keep our eyes open 
as we walk along. You know we can learn to see 
things by looking very carefully at first, then after 
a while we will notice the things about us without 
making any apparent effort. 

Oh, yes, we can have butterflies and moths even in 
midwinter by keeping the cocoons in the warm house. 
The heat causes them to undergo their metamorphosis 
more rapidly. 

Yes, it is a pity to have them come out too early, for 
they cannot fly out of doors, and soon die. 

Remember to keep the earth in the caterpillar box a 
little moist if the box is kept in the warm house, other- 
wise the dry air may cause the wings to shrivel up 
before they have had time fully to expand. 

I am sure you will have a great deal of pleasure 
watching the caterpillars and the beautiful butterflies 
and moths. 









FLIES 

Buzz! buzz! buzz! 

Listen to the flies. ^ 

They take possession of the ^"^^ 
earth in the summer time. 

We cannot keep them out of our 
houses even with screens. 

They seem to enjoy walking over our _Z^\^ 
faces when we are asleep, particularly 
in the early morning. But though the flies __vr-^ 
are so troublesome they also do a great deal of good. 

What, May, you cannot imagine how a fly can be 
of any use ? 

Nevertheless, the fly helps to keep the world clean. 

Like the turkey buzzard it is a very good scavenger. 

You know how quickly dead animals decompose in 
warm countries, and how bad any sort of refuse matter 
is in those regions. 

Well, the buzzard is always on hand. As soon as an 
animal dies he is there, and in a few hours not a vestige 
remains but polished bones that the hot sun soon makes 
perfectly dry and clean. 





The buzzards watch about the peoples' houses and 
quickly consume anything that is thrown out. 

So useful are these large, awkward birds that no one 
f^^\ ever thinks of killing one. Indeed, in many places, 
there is a heavy fine imposed for killing a buzzard 
that in spite of its good deeds is no beauty. Its 
lead is bare and suggests its horrible food ; 
is body is large and awkward, though when 
t flies it is one of the most beautiful things 
in nature. It spreads its great wings and 
soars and floats in the air for hours at a 
time, seeming scarce to move a pinion. 
The flies are the insect buzzards. 
They help the buzzards in hot countries, 
and in the North where there are no buz- 
zards they perform an important service. 

You see it is not the adult fly that does the work. It 
is the larva. 

John says it never occurred to 

him that flies came from larvae. ,-¡ª*-- 

But they do. -^^^^ 

The larva of the fly is the little -iir 

footless thing we call a maggot. 

Probably you have all seen maggots in decaying 
animal or vegetable matter, and here is the picture of 
some enlarged. 





The fly lays the egg and it soon hatches into this 
little white wormlike creature. 

No, it is not really a worm, though it much resembles 
one. 

Why is it not a worm, May ? 

Yes, because it will transform into a six-legged 
winged creature. True worms never do that. 

Cheese Skippers 

Maggots are often found in cheese, where they are 
called skippers because they skip about so when 
disturbed. 

How can they skip without legs ? 

That is easy enough for a maggot. It just doubles 
its head end and tail end close together and suddenly 
straightens out. 

Some people think that maggots are natural to some 
kinds of cheese, but this is not so. 

There are no maggots excepting those that hatch 
from the eggs of flies. The cheese maggot comes from 
the egg of a small black fly only half as large as a 
house fly; these maggots are also found on ham and 
bacon. 

If food is covered so that flies cannot get into it, it 
will never contain maggots. 






Flesh Flies 

Some species of flies lay their eggs in meat, and we 
have to be careful in the summer time not to leave the 
meat exposed or we shall be sure to find little patches 
of small white eggs on it. 

These are the eggs of the flesh-eating flies. 



Metamorphosis of Flies 

When maggots have eaten and grown and molted in 
the usual way, they change into pupae. 

Sometimes they make a cocoon of delicate silk before 
they change, but some species remain in the last larval 
skin, which shrinks and hardens into 
a pupa case and is called a puparium. 
Yes, John, the flies imdergo a com- 
plete metamorphosis; here are pic- 
tures of the adult fly, the long, slen- 
der maggot, and the shorter, thicker 
puparium. 

Yes, indeed, these are all. a good 
deal magnified, so that we can see 
them distinctly. 

No, May, flies do not grow after 
their final metamorphosis. When 









they come out of the pupa state as winged flies 
they are as large as they ever will be. 

This is true of all insects. They do not grow 
after their last molt. 

The flies do all their growing while they are maggots. 
The tiny flies we sometimes see will not grow any 
larger. They are a small species. They 
come from small maggots. 

There are a great many species of flies 
in the world. Some are large and some 
are small, but they all have their mouth 
parts formed into a tube for sucking, and some can 
also pierce with their mouth tube. 

Yes, indeed, John, some flies are very 
troublesome or even dangerous to us, and 
on the whole it is a question whether the 
Fly Order is not more injurious than bene- 
ficial to the human race. 

Although the flies are scavengers, and although the 
larvae of some species live on certain injurious insects 
and destroy them, yet many of the flies are instru- 
mental in spreading diseases. 
1/1 1 The fly crawls over or sucks the blood 
of the diseased animals or persons and 
then carries the poison to a healthy person. 
It has recently been discovered that flies 






carry the germs of malaria, as we have heard, and are 
important instruments in spreading this troublesome 
disease. 

The House Fly 

The fly we know best is the common house fly. 
Perhaps you would like to know its name. It is the 
Musca domestica. 

You all know very well indeed how it 
looks, with its big eyes and glassy wings. 

Under a magnifying glass its body is 
rather hairy, although it looks so smooth to 
the naked eye. 

Yes, Ned, the fly has only two wings, and in that 
respect it differs from other insects. 

As you might guess, the Fly Order is the Diptera, 
from pteroii, a wing, and dis^ two. 

Behind the wings and in place of the hind 
wings, which are lacking, you can see on each 
side a little threadlike stalk with a knob on 
top. It is called the halter. 

Nearly all flies have these halteres. 

They are really rudimentary wings, and they show 
that once the fly had four wings. 

For some reason the hind wings dwindled to these 
halteres. 




There is nothing unusual about the legs of the fly. 
They are used for walking and for holding fast. 

Yes, little Nell, we remember about the foot of the 
fly, and how it is able to cling to smooth surfaces by 
the sticky hairs on the pulvillus. 

Yes, May, the antennsB are rather curious. They are 
short and thick and ^itMMU f ^^^ down in front of 
the face, with a little ' ^^j^^^ - featherlike bristle 
sticking out of each. *^ The tongue, you 

know, is doubled back under the head when not in use. 

You have all watched the fly eat with its thick short 
tongue, which is in the form of a tube by which it 
sucks up its food. 

House flies lay their eggs in horse manure, and so 
where the stable is near the house, flies will appear in 
swarms that blacken the walls. 

As the fly lays over one hundred eggs, and as it takes 
only about ^ week for the adult to appear after the egg 
is laid, you see there is opportunity for a good many 
flies to be bom in the course of a season. 

Stables should be kept very clean indeed, as house 
flies are known to carry diseases, and every means 
should be adopted to lessen their numbers. 

No, May, house flies do not bite. 

Ned says he has always heard that when the flies 
bite it is a sign of rain. 






That is so, but it is not the house fly that bites. The 
house fly is very annoying by walking over us and tick- 
ling our faces, but its tongue can only suck up juices. 

There is a fly, however, that looks like the house fly 
unless examined very carefully; this one bites and is 
the nuisance that finds shelter in our houses to escape 
an approaching storm. 

Some flies as you very well know are able to pierce 
with the mouth tube ; such is the horsefly and the fly 
that comes before the rain. 





The Horsefly 

See, there goes a big 
black horsefly ! 

Not all horseflies 
are large, however, 

and not all are black. Some have 

white patches on their wings, but 

large or small, black or not, they all can 

bile. They worry horses and cattle nearly 

to death in the summer time. 

They hide in the bushes by the roadside 

and when you come driving along, out they 

d'art and pounce upon your poor horses. 

Some of them bite us as well as our horses. 






When riding or driving tlirough 
the woods in summer we should 
always put branches of leaves in 
the horses' bridles, letting them 
hang over their ears and heads ' 
to keep off these flies; the 
Wild Indigo plant is a 
good one to use. It 
grows nearly everywhere 
along the roadsides; it 
bushy, and the flies dislike it. 

Now I must tell you something 
rather curious about the horsefly. It Ls the female alone 
that bites. The mouth parts of the male are small and 
are not able to pierce tough skin, and so he contents him- 
self with flower juices and water for his frugal repast. 
It is only the female among all the blood-sucking flies 
that is able to commit painful depredations 
upon our persons. For the most part 
she, too, contents herself with flower 
juices and other vegetable food, 
but when she gets her chance, ¡ª 
well, she makes the most of it. 

The horseflies are also called 
"gadflies" and '^deerflies." The 
bite of the gadfly is painful, but 





it does not last long, for fortunately it does not poison 
the blood as does the bite of the mosquito. But it is 
a dangerous fly, nevertheless, for it is known to carry 
disease germs to healthy horses and cattle. 

Horseflies are most abundant near wet places in the 
woods, and the larvae of some of them live in the water. 

The eggs are laid in the summer time and soon hatch 
into larvae. The larvae of the common black horseflies 
hibernate, and the adults come out early the next season, 
so we have the horsefly with us all simimer. 

Yes, the horsefly often spoils the pleasure of a walk 
or a drive in the country for us as well as for our 
horses, for several species of horseflies also bite human 
beings. 

John says he once had to walk by the horse's side to 
brush off the horseflies that clustered in a black cloud 
about its face and ears, driving the poor animal almost 
crazy. 

This often happens in wooded roads in midsimimer. 
I once drove a horse that was very sensitive to these 
flies. When even a single one settled on his neck or ear 
he would begin to groan in the most heartrending man- 
ner and continue to do so until I got out and brushed 
away the fly. You see that was his way of saying, 
" Please, dear mistress, come and take that tormenting 
fly away from my head." 






The Crane Fly 

Now do see that crane fly on the wall. What legs! 

Long Legs, I should think you would always be trip- 
pmg over yourself. 

Yes, MoUie, how plainly the halteres show on the 
crane fly ! 

Our crane flies do not bite. Suppose our friend here 
had a mouth tube as long as its legs, and sharp withal ! 





Now let US go to the little brook across 
^^ ^¡êJ^ the field and look along the edge. See, there 
by the roots of those weeds ¡ª what is 
it ? A spider's web full of crane flies ? 
No, just crane flies, numbers of 
them, all hanging together 
by their long legs. 

See, there are 





two or three of 
them dancing about. 



They lay their eggs in running water, though some 
species lay them in the ground. 

Yes, they look considerably like enormous mosquitoes, 
but fortunately for us they are not mosquitoes. 



The Mosquito 

Now, May, what do you think the mosquito is? 

May says she knows what it is, ¡ª 
it is a nuisance. ^^ 

Yes, it is a nuisance, but it is also 
a fly. 

Yes, my dears, the mosquito is 
but a species of biting fly. 

Like the other biting flies it is ^ 
only the female that bites. 




> 





She alone has power to suck our blood. 
The male mosquito is a harmless 
and pretty little gentleman^ 
who eats the sweet nectar of 
flowers and spares us, because 
he cannot bite. 

Although we may be 
tempted ¡ª when in a mos- 
quito-infested region ¡ª to 
believe that mosquitoes live upon nothing but human 
blood, yet as a matter of fact their principal diet is 
vegetable juices, flower nectar especially, and they are 

all, male and female alike, 
very fond of sweets, attack- 
ing the molasses jug as 
voraciously as flies when 
they get the chance. 

It is only a few out of 
the whole number of mos- 
quitoes living at any one 
time that get a chance to 
taste blood. 

The females, however, 
are very fond of it, and bite 
not only long-suffering humanity but horses and cattle 
as well, sometimes worrying the poor creatures sick, for 





unfortunately the bite of the mosquito is poisonous, and 
that is why it is so irritating to the skin. It probably 
injects a httle of its saliva into the wound it makes. 

Mosquitoes do not confine their attention to warm- 
blooded animals, but have been seen complacently filling 
a long-felt want from the heads of young fish, the 
chrysalids of butterflies, and presumably they would 
attack any Hving creature that they could reach and 
whose skin was not too tough. 

Since mosquitoes lay their eggs in water, much can 
be done towards getting rid of them by draining the 
swamps and filling up the wet places. 

Sometimes kerosene oil is put on ponds to destroy 
the mosquito larvae. 

Mosquitoes breed not only in swamps and ponds but 
in any stagnant water, and as it needs but a few days 
for the larvae to develop, a very small quantity of water 
will suffice to accommodate a large and hungry swarm 
of these unwelcome guests. 

Eain-water barrels are often the unsuspected strong- 
holds whence pour forth mighty hosts of bloodthirsty 
barbarians to make life miserable for the innocent 
inmates of country houses. 

You all know the larva of the mosquito. Yes, Mabel, 
it is the curious " wriggler " we so often see in stagnant 
water. 






Here are some in a tumbler. They 
look longer than they are, for the 
glass sides of the tumbler magnify 
them. 

The mosquito lays its eggs in a 
mass that floats like a raft on top 
of the water. When the weather 
is warm the eggs hatch in a few 
hours, and out of each egg comes 
a wriggler. 

This remarkable larva is often seen head down and 
tail up near the surface of the water. 

It seems to be standing on its head for no reason 
whatever. But it has a very good reason. Coming out 
of the side of its abdomen near the tip is a tube in 
_ which are two air vessels, and it is the 
tip end of this tube it is sticking out 
of the water. 

You see that is the way it breathes. 
At the tip of the abdomen are six 
hairs and four little flaps that give it 
quite an ornamental appearance. These 
appendages, however, are not for orna- 
ment, but to aid in propelling this active little larva 
through the water, for, as you very well know, it does 
not remain quietly breathing all day long. 





It comes to the surface for air; then snap, skip, 
whirligig, wriggle ! What has become of it ? It seems 
to have taken a fit; but no, it has merely taken itself 
to the bottom of the water, where it goes whirligigging 
about for something to eat. It has a big head, you 
see, and there are hairs about its ever-ready mouth that 
are in constant motion, fanning into it tiny particles of 
animal and vegetable matter. 

It molts and becomes a pupa, but do not imagine 
that this extraordinary creature does anything so ordi- 
nary as to retire into a cocoon or a puparium and keep 
quiet while undergoing its final metamorphosis. That 
would be expecting too much. 

Its larval stage lasts about a week in hot weather, ¡ª 
longer if the weather is cool, ¡ª and then it assumes the 
pupal form, which is but little less active than the larval 
form, though now it no longer eats, its mouth parts 
being sealed up, so to speak. 

But it breathes, coming to the surface of the water 

j^ as before, only now its breathing 

tubes are two in number and stand 
out from its thorax like a pair of 
little horns. 

It remains at the top of the 
water with the tips of its breathing 
tubes out, unless it is disturbed. 








when presto! it descends to the bottom as lively a 
wriggler as ever. 

Its pupal stage lasts but two or three days as a rule, 
when there emerges our well-known but not well-loved 
mosquito. 

The adult finds some snug comer before winter 
arrives and hibernates, coming forth at the first breath 
.of spring to lay its eggs. 

Sometimes these hibernating mosquitoes wake up 
during the few warm days that occasionally come in 
the winter time, and then they like to refresh themselves 
by biting us. 

Where there are long spells of dry weather the mos- 
quito does not die. Oh, no, it patiently waits for the 
rains to come and make pools and ponds in which it 
can lay its eggs. 

Yes, Charlie, there are a good many species of mos- 
quitoes in the world, and their transformations are not 
all just alike; the one we know best transforms as I 
have just told you. You can easily watch 
J it and see for yourself. 





Ned wants to know how the mosquitoes give us 
malaria. 

So you have heard about that, Ned. 

It would seem that certain species of mosquitoes are 
infested by the tiny malaria germs, and that these 
germs pass from the tube of the mosquito into the 
blood of the person bitten by this poisonous insect. 

It is now supposed that this is the principal, perhaps 
the only, way by which the malarial germ finds its way 
into human blood. 

No, little Nell, the mosquito does not sing by rubbing 
its wings together. Perhaps it does not sing on purpose. 
The humming sound we so hate to hear is caused by 
the rapid movement of its wings during flight. As 
soon as it comes to rest this sound ceases, as you well 
know. 

If it could come silently to its feast, we should not 
defeat its purpose so often. 

Warned by the tiny, shrill trumpet tones of the 
advancing one, we are often able to brush it away or 
even to kill it before it has had a chance to regale itself 
at our expense. 

Some flies, however, have a true voice and sing when 
we hold their wings immovable ; but how this is accom- 
plished we can learn better from the bee people, who 
have this power of song developed to a high degree. 






The Gnat and the Gall 

Yes, Ned, gnats are small flies, and some of them are 
as troublesome as mosquitoes, for they come silently, 
and the first intimation we have of their presence is the 
pain of their sharp little mouth ^ tube in our skin. 

There is one family of very 
tiny gnats with whose work 
we are better acquainted 
than with the gnat itself- 

Look at that willow 
over there. See how '^^^J 
many curious fruits it 
seems to be bearing. 

Yes, May, they look like M^ j 'M\ 
azalea buds, ¡ª the large buds \wl f^jjm 
the flowers come from. But ->fe.\(lLt>^i 
these are not flower buds. 
Once they were leaf buds, 
but a minute gnat laid its 
eggs on the young leaf bud M4\ 
and out hatched tiny maggots 

that ate into the bud and prevented its proper develop- 
ment. 

Instead of growing out into a healthy twig covered 
with leaves, the willow bud, when attacked by these 







larvie, thickens without lengthening, and finally becomes 
this queer stunted thing which we call a gall. 
If we were to open one of these galls early in 
the summer we should find the little maggot 
inside " as snug as a bug in a rug." 
It has a little room there in which 
it lives not only all summer but all 
winter, too, changing to a pupa early 
the next spring. 

When the willow buds are well formed 
and just ready to leaf out, the pupa in 
the gall bursts its bonds and out steps 
Madam Gnat, who loses no time in de- 
|X)siting her eggs on the young buds. 

You have all noticed the little swell- 
ings on pine twigs, but you may not 
know that these, too, are formed by the larvae of gnats. 
The larvae eat the bark of the pine twig, which causes 
the gummy sap to ooze out. This hardens, forming a 
covering about the larvae. In their little waterproof 
house they undergo their transformations. 

And there are the round golden-rod galls. They, too, 
are made by the maggot of a fly. 

The maggots that spoil our golden-rods have a happy 
time doing it. Think of living in a house whose walls 
were a golden-rod stem. 






Within this golden-rod gall in a little cell just 
large enough to hold it the little larva passes its 
days, to come forth at last a pretty fly, with no 
care but to seek other golden-rods upon 
which to lay its eggs. 

No, indeed, John, the flies are not re- 
sponsible for all kinds of galls, as you will 
discover in time. Indeed, the golden-rod has 
another gall on its stem that is made by the 
larva of a moth. It is oblong instead of 
round, and when you break it, it is hollow. 

The Hessian Fly 

Some of the great larvaB are very destruc- 
tive to grains and to clover, as they feed on 
the young seeds. 

The Hessian fly is one of the most formi- 
dable enemies to wheat that we have in this country, 
and it has destroyed many millions of dollars' worth of 
grain. It attacks rye and barley as well as wheat. 

It is a tiny fly, but its deeds are great. It lays its 
eggs on the wheat leaf, and the larvae crawl down to 
the stalk just where the leaf grows from it and there 
they feed on the juices of the plant to such an extent 
as to destroy the life of the grain. 




no 




The Hessian fly is not native to this country, or, as 
we say, it is not indigenous. It is supposed to have 
been brought to this country in the grain which the 
Hessian troops fed their horses in the War of the 
Revolution. 







Parasites 

There are a great many species of flies in the world, 
and a great many more in this country than we could 
make the acquaintance of in an ordinary lifetime ; but 
though we cannot know everything about all of them, 
we are glad to know something about a few of them. 

Quite a number of flies lay their eggs on other 
insects or in their nests, and the fly larvaB thus devour 
the other insects or their larvaB. These parasites are bene- 
ficial when the larvae they attack are harmful to us. 

Ned wants to know just what " parasite '* means. 

Well, Ned, long ago those people who did not work 
for themselves but who ate at the tables of the rich and 
earned their welcome by flattery were called 
parasites. 

The word came to be applied a] 
animals that live in or on other 
animals and at their expense. 
It is also used of plants that^ 
suck out the juices of other 
plants instead of getting their 
food from the earth. 

The mistletoe is a parasite. 
It grows on the limbs of trees 
and sends its roots through the 




into the sap and so lives without taking any trouble. 
When a fly lays its eggs on the larva of a beetle and 
the fly larva feeds on the larva of the beetle, then we 
very justly call the fly larva a parasite. 

Yes, May, lice are parasites, and so are bird lice and 
fleas and bedbugs. 

Some insects are parasitic in the larval form and not 
in the adult form, as is the case with certain flies. 
Some are parasitic in the adult and not in the larval 
form, as the fleas that do not suck blood until they are 
full grown. Some, like the lice, are parasitic in both 
larval and adult form. 

When insects are parasites in the adult form they are 
nearly always ^'degraded," as we say; that is, they 
have lost certain organs that their kind usually have. 
The bedbug is a degraded form, ¡ª it has lost its wings, 
¡ª and the lice are yet more degraded, having lost all 
the higher characteristics of the Bug Order to which 
they belong. They cannot fly and they cannot see well ; 
they are not much better than living machines for 
sucking blood. 

No, indeed, John, an animal is not a parasite because 
it eats other animals. 

Our swift dragon flies that hunt and capture insects 
are not parasites. Only those insects that live in another 
animal or on it and feed upon it are called parasites. 




The Robber Fly 

Yes, Mollie, that fellow is a fly. 
You thought so because you have been 
watching it a long time and found it had 
but two wings. It is easily alarmed, so if we wish to 
see it we must be very quiet. 

It has a long abdomen, which is unusual in flies. 
It is the robber fly ¡ª and there ! ¡ª now you ^ 
know why. ¡ª -^-^T 

Did you see it pounce upon that large 
green fly and grab it ferociously ? Now 
it is sitting on that twig eating its prey. 
These robber flies well deserve their name. 

J They are strong and fierce and some of 

^/ them are even able to capture and consume 

J that other notable robber, the dragon fly. 

The larvaB of these highwajnnen, so far as 

\ is known, live in the ground and prey upon 

the larvae of beetles. 










Beelike Flies 

Mollie looks deKghted. 
She says she has found a fly that 
mimics a bee. 

She thought it was a bee for a long 
time, but something in its behavior as 
it hovered over the flowers aroused her suspicions, and 
upon looking yet more carefully she discovered it had 
but two wings! 

Yes, Mollie, that is a trick some flies 
play upon the rest of the world.. They 
look like bees. Some of them are clothed in 
beelike hairs, some mimic the big bumble- 
bee with his yellow jacket, and some mimic wasps and 
hornets. 

Some of these masqueraderS go boldly into the nests 
of the bees and lay their eggs on the larvaB there ; others 
parasitize the eggs of moths, grasshoppers, or other 
insects. Most of them like to hover about the flowers 
and drink the nectar. 

They dart about so quickly that it is not easy to 
catch them, and most people would think twice before 
taking hold of one, as only those who are careful 
observers know that these gay deceivers are not bees 
at all but just harmless flies. 





The Botfly 

The larvae of the flies are often beneficial to us from 
their habit of parasitizing other insects, some destroying 
plant lice, some ants, and some even clearing our gar- 
dens of snails ; but there is one fly whose larvaB have the 
most outrageous habits of any known insect. This is 
the botfly. 

There are several species of it, and one that closely 
resembles a honeybee lays its eggs on the legs of 
horses. 

The horses are afraid of it, as in some way they know 
it is an enemy. 

When the eggs are laid, the horse, > 
annoyed by them, licks them off and 
swallows them. 

This is what the botfly wants. 
When the eggs hatch the larvae fasten 
themselves to the coat of the horse's 
stomach until they are ready to become pupae, when 
they pass from the horse in the dung and crawl into 
some safe place to transform. 

They do not. make a cocoon, but remain in the pupal 
skin, which under such circumstances, you remember, is 
called a puparium. They do not need a cocoon and 
they have no silk with which to make one. 








There is another botfly that 
troubles cattle and is often called 
the ox warble. 

It lays its eggs on the legs or 
backs of cattle, when as before the animal licks them 
off. These larvaB do not want to get to the stomach, 
but burrow through the walls of the oesophagus and 
wander about through the animal's tissues for several 
months, finally taking up their abode on its back just 
under the skin. Here the larva becomes spiny, and 
boring a hole through the skin, remains with its breath- 
ing pores close to the orifice. When ready to become 
a pupa it bores its way out and drops to the ground, 

where it transforms within a puparium. 
The sheep botfly is another member of 

this disreputable family. It lays its eggs in 

the nostrils of sheep, and the larvae creep 

up into the head and horns. 

When full grown they come down again 

and fall to the ground, where they transform. 




The Bluebottle and Apple Flies 

The bluebottle fly that buzzes about so crazily when 
it gets caught in a room is the rascal ¡ª or one of the 
best known of the rascals ¡ª that lay their eggs on our 




meat and spoil it. It is a handsome little nuisance with 
its polished blue % ^^ body and its red 
eyes, but Madam x^^Hj^ Bluebottle, your 
deeds are not as fair ^Mj|^U2^ as your looks. 

The larva of the z' ^ Codlin moth is not 
the only apple eater we have. 

There is a fly whose larva bores tunnels all through 
the pulp of the apple. 

Salt-Water Flies 

Among the queerest of the fly folk are the salt- 
water flies. 

The larvaB of these live in the salt lakes of the West, 
and even in alkaline water in which nothing else 
can live. 

In eastern California is the very strange Lake Mono, 
whose water is nauseous to the taste and slippery to the 
touch. But this is the breeding place of such enormous 
numbers of certain salt-water flies that the larvae can 
be collected by bushels from the shores where they 
have drifted. There in olden time went the Indians, 
who collected these larvae, dried them in the sun, rubbed 
off the outer skin of the puparium, and used the rest 
for food. 


Fruit Flies 

We are all acquainted with the little fruit flies, 
those tiny things that swarm over ripe fruit late in the 
summer. We cannot leave a dish of grapes standing on 
the table but that these little thieves will find it. 

They eat the fruit, and they also lay their eggs on it. 

The larvae are also fond of canned fruit and even of 
pickles. They seem to enjoy life in a bath of brine or 
of vinegar, and unless we seal our cans perfectly they 
will be very apt to spoil the contents for us. 

So-called Ticks 

There are also parasitic flies that look like lice and 
that live on birds and other animals. These are called 
ticks, but they are not real ticks. The real ticks are not 
insects in the proper sense of the word. Our troublesome 
wood ticks are closely related to the spiders, and they, 
you know, are not insects. No, indeed, spiders are not true 
insects ; they have eight legs instead of six, and the adult 
has the head and thorax soldered together in one piece 
instead of being separate; there are also other differences. 

Yes, Charlie, the daddy longlegs, or grandfather gray- 
beard, as it is also called, has eight legs, and it is not an 
insect. 





Early Comers 

The fly folk are perhaps the earliest of all to appear 
in the spring. Which do you think would come first, a 
mosquito or a Monarch butterfly ? 

Ah, yes, John, you have thought about it. The mos- 
quito can find food at once. We often see mosquitoes 
and gnats around the early-blossoming willow flowers ; 
but the Monarch butterfly must wait until the milkweeds 
are up in order to lay its eggs on the leaves. 

Insects appear when the plant they feed upon or lay 
their eggs upon is ready for them. 




THE FLEA FOLK 

The prize jumpers are certainly the fleas. 
Grasshoppers and crickets do very well, 
but for real get-over-the-ground high jumping 
you must go to the flea. 

Oh, yes, it is a parasite and a troublesome 

one, yet we do not loathe it as we do other 

Fieamagnitied parasitcs that trouble us. It is such a hard, 

shiny little rascal, and it is so ridiculous in its frantic 

efforts to get away from us. 

It has paid the penalty of living on other animals 
and has lost almost everything but its jump. 

Its wings have gone, and its eyes are merely two 
ocelli. Its antennaB are small and short, but no doubt it 
can smell very well with them. 

From long slipping about between the hairs of animals 
the fleas have become modified, ¡ª an aid in that pleas- 
ing occupation. Their bodies are flat sideways, and they 
are shaped somewhat like flaxseeds standing on edge. 

They have strong, sharp mouth tubes, and their order 
has been named the Siphonaptera, from siphon^ a tube, 
and apteros, wingless. 





No, indeed, John ; they could not be named from their 
wings because they have none, so they are named from 
their lack of wings. 

You see, in the other orders we know, some of the 
members had wings ; not so the Flea Order. 

That ancient and honorable order is entirely wingless. 

The fleas are distinguished the world over by their 
lively manners. For their size they can outjump any 
other living thing, and this they accomplish by their 
very large and strong hind legs. 

Our domestic fleas lay their eggs on 
the hairs of dogs and cats, and these 
eggs, not being fastened in any way,-^ 
fall to the floor or the ground, where 
they hatch into little wormlike larvae Fiea magnified 

that feed on the decaying matter they find in the dust. 

In a week or two these larvae spin delicate cocoons 
and retire from the trials of life for a time. But they 
are not long inactive ; in three or four days they come 
out of their cocoons and find themselves possessed of all 
the powers of champion leapers. 

Cat and dog fleas readily turn their attention to us, 
though the owners of pet animals usually try to think 
they do not. 

A great many wild animals, including birds, are the 
unwilling victims of different species of fleas, and in 








some countries they are such a nuisance as to make 
living in those otherwise delightful places almost 
unbearable. 








The Ladybird 

Ladybird, ladybird, fly away home ; 

Your house is on fire and your children will burn. 

Thus sings little Nell to the ladybird, often also called 
ladybug, on her finger. And see ! it has flown away* ^:¡êj 

The ladybng is not a bug. '' "* "* 

May says you might know that from its name, 
because almost everything that is called a bug 
is n't a bug. 

Anyway, the ladybug is not a l3ng; it is a 
beetle, which is another matter entirely. 

Did you watch it spread its wings? 

Yes, Ned; they are four in number, and* 
like some other wings we know of, the upper pair are 
not used for flying. 

True, Charlie ; it is the upper wings of the grass- 
hoppers and of all the other Orthoptera that are modified 







to serve as wing covers, and it is so with the' pretty 
beetle folk. 

The upper wings are hard and small ; sometimes they 
are not large enough to cover the abdomen. They do not 
overlap on top like the wing covers of the Orthoptera, 
but they meet together in a straight line down the back. 

They are called elytra ; they used to be called shards, 
¡ª a word still used in poetry. Under the elytra he 
the inner wings, which are thin and large. These are 
sometimes a great deal longer than the elytra. 




The May Beetle 

Here is a May beetle whose wings 
we can spread out. 

Yes, Nellie ; the elytra are not 

used in flying. The beetle 

raises them up out of the 

way so that the inner 

wings will have ^ , 



room for their movements. "^ 
Now I am sure you wonder how 

these long wings can be tucked ^ 

away under the short elytra. 
Let us look at our friend May 

beetle again. We will slowly open 

one wing. There! now you see. 









The under wing has a sort of joint about halfway down 
so that it can be doubled in two. When thus doubled it 
can be easily folded down under the wing cover. 

_^ The May beetle sometimes has a deal of 

trouble tucking these under wings into 

place, and the ends of them stick out in 

a funny way after the elytra have been 

shut down. 

The inner wings of soi?ie of the 
?^beetles are very large, and they are 
^ "y folded and crumpled up in various ways to 
make them fit under the elytra. 

Here is one, a near relative to the 
May beetle, that saves itself .¡ª 
the trouble of opening its 
elytra when it flies. 

The elytra do not fit down tightly 
over the sides, so the clever little beetle just slips its 
wings out from under the closed elj^tra, and slips them 
back under when it is done using them. 

The Beetle Order is named from the elytra. The 
beetles are the sheath wings or Coleoptera, from coleos, 
a sheath, and pteron, a wing. 

You will not find the beetle folk sucking up their 
food, for their mouth parts are not modified into tubes. 
They have jaws with which they seize their prey. 





' 


I The larvse o¡ê the beetles are six-footed as a rule and 
^/Mk}'-t7r^T-=~-^^\ ^ a^e called grubs. 
-^^^^^^I ^M^lXk ^^ Y^"' ^^^^^^5 we often dig 
" ^ up big white ones when work- 

ing in the garden, and we find 
them in rotten wood and under 
i^^^^^;^:^^ ' J^ boards and stones. 
l^ S^"j The metamorphosis of the 

^^^^-Vl / beetles is complete. They 
;J L change from larvaa into motion- 
less pupae that are in some cases 
very funny little dolls indeed. 

The Number of Insects on Earth 

There are a great many beetles in the world, and we 
have more than eleven thousand species in oiu: country. 

It is difficult to say, John, which order of insects is 
the largest. 

You must remember that not all the insects in the 
world are yet known; there are thousands of species 
still unnamed, but the Beetle Order is a very large one, 
and so is the Diptera or Fly Order. Yes, May ; so is the 
Hemiptera or Bug Order, and the Lepidoptera or Butter- 
fly and Moth Order. 

The insects far outnumber all the rest of the animals 
in the world put together. 









And there 
are good reasons 
for this. The small 
size of the insects is in 
their favor, as is also 
their power of 
flight. 

John asks how 
their power to fly 
c:an help them. 
Being able to fly 
they can more easily escape 
their enemies, and they can also change their environment. 
What is their environment, Mabel wants to know. 
The environment of a creature is that which sur- 
rounds and influences it. 

We say it is suited to its environment when the 
temperature and moisture and food supply suit it and 
when there is freedom from enemies. 

A creature that is not suited to its environment can- 
not prosper and often cannot live. An aphis that 




happens to be bom in a fertile region in a warm dry 
season finds itself in a good environment unless a man 
comes along and deluges it with kerosene emulsion, 
when its environment is no longer good. 

Yes, we speak of environment with respect to people, 
and we do not consider a city slum a good environment 
for a child to grow up in. A clean, bright home with 
good influences is a fortunate environment for any 
child. 

When an insect finds its environment bad for it, 
when, for instance, the food supply fails, it can spread 
its wings and fly away to pastures new. 

The Ladybird again 

But how far we have wandered away from little 
Nell's ladybug ! Hers was red with black spots on it, 
but there are a good many species of these little friends 
of ours, and some are black or yellow with white or red 
or yellow spots. All of them have the power to give off 
a bad odor if we happen to disturb them. 

But we can easily excuse them for this when we 
remember what good friends they are on the whole. 
What do you suppose the larvaB of the ladybug live on ? 

As a rule they are predaceous, that is, they eat living 
creatures, and many of them revel in feasts of plant lice. 




Some destroy scale bugs and are exceedingly valuable 
to fruit growers. Do you know that < 
fomia is the proud possessor of a lady- 
bug purposely imported from \V 
Australia to destroy certain de- \^ 
structive scale insects, and it is \/ doing it tool 

The hop growers have a ladybug f / that they call 
'' nigger " because it is black, and they prize it above 
everything because it destroys the hop louse. 

The adults as well as the larvaB are predaceous, and 
we have reason enough for our kindly feelings towards 
the pretty ladybugs. 

When the ladybug larva is ready to become a pupa it 
attaches itself to something by its 
tail end, the larval skin splits down 
the back and discloses an odd- 
looking little pupa, though sometimes it stays within 
the larval skin to transform. 









The Tiger Beetle 

What beauty is this that 
crosses our path? 
See it shine ! A most brilliant 
green you are, lovely one, like 
y^J^/^^^i^ a livmg jewel. 

"No, no. Master John; you 
cannot catch me," he seems to say as he flits off just 
out of reach, and now he is waiting in the path again. 
But see, his head is turned this way. The tiger beetle 
does not mean to be taken by surprise. 

Yes, it is a tiger beetle; and you can always know it 
by its very quick motions and its sudden flight. It flies 
much better than the rest of the beetle folk, and it is a 
champion runner. 

Why is it called a tiger beetle ? If you knew it better, 
MoUie, you would not need to ask. You have not seen 
it pounce upon other insedis, for both 
the brilliant adult and the homely larva 
are fierce hunters. Moreover, the adults 
are often spotted and striped in quite 
a tigerish fashion. 

The larvaB live in burrows in the 
earth. Watch the little holes in the 
footpaths and see if you do not some 







day find a pair of tiny pincers at the opening 
of one. These pincers will very likely turn 
out to be the jaws of a tiger-beetle larva. 
There the little rascal waits, jaws wide open, 
all ready to close over any unfortunate 
insect that sets foot on this pitfall. 

No, these fellows are not as clever as the 
ant-lion larvaa; they do not build a funnel ' 

for the unwary to tumble into. 

The tiger-beetle larvaB are modified to live in their 
holes. They have a hump on the back and two stout 
hooks on the hump to hold them fast in case there comes 
a tug of war between themand some unwilling captive. 
Now see ! Mollie is the wise one to-day. She has 
been looking carefully at the path as we walked along 
and she thinks she has found the larva of a tiger beetle. 
Where is John with his trowel? But before we try 
to dig him out let us run a straw into the burrow so we 
won't lose the direction. 
Dig carefully, John. 
There, he has found it, and oh, how 
indignant it is! See, it has hold of 
the end of the straw ! It is biting it 
for all it is worth. 

There now, little larva, you need not 
get into such a temper. Nobody is going to hurt you. 












The Ground Beetle 

See that ground beetle ! It will soon 
make a meal of the caterpillar. 

Yes, the ground beetles generally live 

, on the ground under stones and sticks 

y and come prowling out after prey.- A 

.y good many of them prefer to come out 

at night. 

The larvaa live under stones, too, and 
^ / if we search we may find one. Yes, this 
]j / is one ; it is black, you see. 
But not all the larvae of the 
l^'iji- gi'o^iid beetles are black, 
^-^'-^ though they are all shaped a 
good deal like this one. See its little jaws ! 
/ Ravenous one, we know what you 
/ do with those jaws. 
\?( Many of the ground beetles are black in color 
'^^'i3 V^^ ^^^ y^^ often see them running when you 
lift up stones. 

But here is one that is not black. It is 

the Searcher, with its brilliant green wings. 

Ah, yes, you can guess why it is called 

the Searcher. These fellows that live in 

the grass and imder stones do not fly. They run when 







they have business on hand. Because they have not 
used their wings for so long a time, what do you think 
has happened? 

John guesses their wings may have disappeared. 

And so they have in many species. The wing covers 
are there, but if you were to lift them up you would 
find the inner wings mere rudiments. 

Because they would not fly when they could they 
cannot now fly at all; they must spend their lives in 
running about. 

Yes, indeed. May; it is so with all living things. If 
an organ is not used at all if becomes useless. If you 
were to tie up one of your arms, after a while it would 
get so weak you could not use it. The more an organ 
is rightly used the stronger it grows. If we look with 
our eyes and try to remember what we see, our eyes 
learn to see better and our minds to remember better. 

The only way to keep and to improve our powers is 
to use them. 

The ground beetles have lost their wings, but they 
have very fine strong legs because they have used them 
so much. 

You know how many beetles have the power to give 
off a bad odor. Well, our ground beetles are no excep- 
tion, and the little Bombardier, with its yellowish thorax 
and legs and its black or blue wing covers, is the chief 






performer in this respect. It gets its name from its 
habit of squirting an offensive fluid upon any one who 
disturbs it. This fluid, when coming in contact with 
the air, quickly vaporizes and looks like smoke. 

. This queer little gun is used 

j^ / '^'f / ^iisparingly upon any insect that 




-w>^^ 



presumes to attack the well-armed brigadier who thus 
bombards the enemy. 

Yes, Mollie; I am sure you have often seen these 
queer fellows. \ 

¡ö ' ? J/

.M^^'' 




The Water Beetle 

Not all the insects that dart about our ponds belong 
to the Bug Order. 

There are water beetles as well as water bugs. 







You can tell which are beetles and which are bugs by 
their mouth parts. The bugs, you know, suck up their 
food through a mouth tube, which they readily thrust 
into your finger tip if you give them the chance. The 
beetles have only jaws 'with which to nip inquisitive 
fingers. 

The predaceous diving beetles or Water Tigers are 
very common in still water, and Ned has a plan for our 
afternoon. 

We are to go with him to a pond not far off, where 
there are a great many of those fellows. 

Now here we are and here they are. See the polished 
dark brown beetles that are floating head downward 
near the surface of the water, 
a.s though from this po^^itiou 
ol" adviiiitage to keep an eye on 
'their neighbors down below and 
welcome any straggler into 
evei^ready stomach^s. 




The diving beetles have well-developed wings, and 
they fly from pond to pond in search of food. 

Yes, John; they change their environment to suit 
their needs. 

These corsairs are pleasanter to watch than to handle, 
for like so many of the beetle folk they protect them- 
selves by bad odors. 

If you touch one it gives off a disgusting milky fluid 
from the thorax just back of the head ; and not satisfied 
with this it will also pop at you a suffocating yellow 
liquid from two glands near the end of its tail. 

Why, yes, Charlie ; you can try it if you want to ; take 
the net and catch one. There, now you are satisfied. 
Yes, it is a horrible smelling little wretch when it 
wishes to be. 

Little Nell wants to know what those tiny black 
~^ _ things are that go darting about every- 



^Qi>_^^^^^TZ^'~~ where like comets in the water. 
: ¡ª ^^l'^i;S^ ,^^^ Mabel says they are the W 
-^[^^ pi^^ ¡ª .'' Yes, that is one name for them 



¡ª ? How shiny they are ! and how absurd 
in their gyrations ! 

They, too, are diving beetles, and when they go to 
the bottom they take a bubble of air. 

If we could put one under the magnifying glass we 
sliould see what strange legs it has. 








But here is a picture that will show us. 

The hind ones are greatly modified for 

swimming ; they are large and broad when 

we stretch them out. The joints are flat, 

the tarsal joints particularly 

being shaped almost like the j^^^ 

fins of a fish. This is why^^j 

^ they can flash about so quickly. -^ 

They are no pleasanter to handle than ^ 

the Water Tigers, for as soon as you touch ^ 

them they give out an ill-smelling milky z:r 

fluid from nearly every joint in their bodies. ^ 

The Whirligig lays its eggs on water plants, and the 
little larvae are predaceous. The adult Whirligigs can 
fly, and they can also squeak by rubbing the under side 
of the wing covers against the body. 

The diving beetles, or Water Tigers, 
are also able to squeak. 

The Great Water Beetles 

There are quite a number of aquatic 
beetles besides these we have been 
watching, and one of the most inter- 
esting is the large, black water scaven- 
ger, or great water beetle, that makes a 
silken cocoon in which to lay its eggs. 







It spins this cocoon from a spinneret at the tail end, 
much as a spider spins its web. It also has a sharp spine 
on its breast that pierces fingers that handle it carelessly. 

The full-grown larvae of these big fellows are black 
in color, and, of course, they are aquatic. 

Yes, Mabel ; aquatic means living in water. The 
creatures that live all the time in the water are aquatic. 

Yes, indeed, fish are aquatic. What larvae besides 
those of the beetles can you think of that are aquatic ? 

Yes, the dragon fly and May fly larvae, and the caddice 
larvae, and mosquito larvae, oh, there is a long list of them. 
But remember that aquatic animals must all breathe air. 



The Burying Beetles 







See what little Nell has found ! 

No, no, don't touch it, dear. 
The poor httle bird is 
dead, and now, see ! the 
/ \ , beetles are at work 
^J]^ burying it. 
^ Yes, May ; that is what 
1|T[I__ they are doing. You have often 
seen those queer-looking red 
spotted beetles about dead ani- 
mals, but you did not know what they were doing? 





Well, that is what they are doing, burying the little 
animals that die in the woods or the fields. 

They are called the burying beetles, or the sexton 
beetles. 

Y^s, indeed, John ; they will really and truly bury the 
little bird. You watch and see if they don't. 

Yes, Charlie ; they dig under the bird ; you can see 
one all gone but its tail. Their front legs are modified 
for digging ; see how broad and thick they are. 

Why, yes, John ; catch one if you want to, but let me 
:wam you that these Gravediggers do not smell like 
violets or roses. 

Ah, yes, one can now get a good look at you, old fel- 
low. See how short its wing covers are ; they -^^ 
do not nearly cover its abdomen. 

And what queer clublike antennae it has. ^_¡êE 

Poor fellow, he is so anxious to get back to _^ 
his grave digging, suppose we let him go. 

Indeed, Mabel, these are thorough little 
grave makers. 

They burrow under the animal until they 
have made an excavation into which it settles, and they 
keep on digging away until the hole is deep enough to 
receive it. Even then they do not stop, but actually 
sink it two or three inches below the surface of the 
ground. 






Then what do you think ? Those tireless little work- 
ers throw the dirt back into the hole until the animal is 
well covered. 

Why do they do this? Well, John, for the usual 
reason that these insects take an interest in decaying 
matter. Now can you guess ? 

That is right, my boy ; they want the bird as food for 
their larvaB.. When it is buried the female beetles dig 
down to it and deposit their eggs on it. 

The larvae are hard, flat, black things that smell 
¡ª my, how they do smell ! 

Why, yes, indeed, John ; you can mark the place 
where the little bird lies, and after a few days you 
can dig it up. 

See May hold her nose, but you know you don't 
have to come. May. 
Oh, you want to come ! Well, I thought so. 
These Gravediggers are interesting in spite of their 
bad odor, and they are wise little people too. 

If they find a dead animal small enough for them to 
handle, they are bound to have it, and if it is lying on 
ground too hard to dig into, these clever little people 
roll it to a softer spot. Sometimes they will move an 
animal several feet to a suitable burial place. 

It will take them about twenty-four hours to bury 
this little bird, but they will work much longer than that 




if necessary. Even if you were to fasten the bird with 
sticks or tie it with strings to the top of the ground, 
they would manage to get it loose and bury it. 

The Rove Beetle ^ 

Now this is a rove beetle. 

It is also anxious to have a share in the body of 
the bird, but it will not help to bury it. 

Yes, Ned ; its wings are ridiculous, they are so 
short, like a little jacket over the upper part of its 
abdomen. But let me tell you, the rove beetle can 
fly in spite of appearances. 

Its wings are long if its wing covers are short, and 
when it wishes to fly it spreads a pair of wings as long 
as its body, or even longer. 

The rove beetle sometimes has trouble in getting these 
long wings tucked away under the short elytra, and if 
you watch you may see it using its legs or the end of its 
abdomen to push them under. 

These beetles are usually quite small insects, though 
some species are large, as this one we have found. If 
you touch it, you will be treated to an odor that out- 
ranks even that of the Gravedigger, and often they 
raise up the tip of the abdomen as if they meant to 
sting. But they have no sting, ¡ª only the horrid scent 





glands, which are .almost as bad as a sting. Some of 
them are colored like a bumblebee, and dressed in bee- 
like hairs, with a form, too, like that of a bee. 

I think you are right, May ; when such a beetle raises 
the tip of the abdomen most creatures would think it 
was a. bee getting ready to sting, and thus we have a 
case of protective mimicry. 

The Carpet Beetle 

Poor Mollie ! So your are tired out helping your mother 
hunt for buffalo moths. 

You know how they look, then. Yes, and you know 
they are not moths at all ; you think they are some sort 
of larva. 

Grood, Mollie ! Your interest in insects is making 
you observe carefully and think well. 

You are right about the buffalo moth. It is not a 
moth at all, nor is it a bug. The tiny fat grub cov- 
ered with brown hairs is the larva of a beetle. The 
carpet beetle it is called. 

It is a nuisance where it finds its way into houses, 
the larva eating carpets, clothes, furs, and feathers. It 
is more troublesome even than the clothes moth. 

The adult carpet beetle is a pretty little black, white, 
and red thing that looks like a small ladybug. It feeds 
on pollen, but comes into the house to lay its eggs. 







The Click Beetle 

Ah, Charlie ! So you have caught a click 
beetle. 

The children often call it snapping bug 
and skipjack. 

Is he not a beauty with his dark gray 
wings and the two velvety spots on his thorax '^'^ 

What is that, Little Nell? You used to 
think those were his eyes, but now you know 
better? 

Yes, indeed ; none of us would mistake those spots for 
his eyes now. His little eyes are in front of his head, 
just back of the antennaB. 

The click beetle lays its eggs on the ground or on the 
bark of trees, and the larvaB of some species do a good 
deal of damage to the roots of grains 
other plants. 

You will be surprised 

w \'-x vv^i^y^yo^^ A>wc?vi4. y.wicx-y ^q know that the larva 

of the click beetle is the 
^long, hard, slender wire- 
worm we often dig up in 
the garden or see under the bark of decaying trees. You 
would not guess that this queer object was the larva of 
a beetle. 





Yes, John ; it is generally yellowish brown in color. 
It does a great deal of mischief in some places ; but the 
adult is harmless enough, and we are all well acquainted 
with it. 

Yes, indeed, MoUie ; we have all put the click beetles 
on their backs to see them spring into the air. As they 
spring they turn over and come down on their feet, or 
at least try to, for they don't always succeed. 

What is that, Nell ? If at first they don't succeed, 
they try, try again ? ^^ 

So they do, Nell; so 
they do. 

Now turn this fellow 
over and you wiU see how he 
turns his somersault. The thorax is provided with a 
spine that fits in a groove on the abdomen. 

When you turn the beetle on his back he bends him- 
self upwards, resting on his head 
and the tip of his abdomen. 
Then suddenly he straightens 
out; the spine strikes against the groove in the abdo- 
men and acts as a spring to toss him into the air. 

Yes, indeed; he will work this spring while we hold 
him, so that it is quite difficult to prevent his smooth 
body from snapping out from between our fingers. 
What a surprise we get the first time we touch one ! 







The scientific name of these fellows is el'a-ter, and 
elater comes from the same Greek word that " elastic " 
comes from. 

Yes, when we catch them they tuck their antennae 
close down against the under side of the thorax, so that 
they look as though they had none. 

I have no doubt you are right, Ned ; they do so to 
protect those delicate threads from being broken. 

Yes, little Nell ; they ^^play possum" when we take 
hold of them. They lie as though dead. 

We have a good many elaters in this country. Some 
of them are quite small and have no eye-spots on the 
thorax. 

There are elaters in Central and South America, also 
in Mexico and the West Indies, that shine in the dark. 

Here is a picture of one of them. 

The two spots on the thorax emit a bright 
light, as does also the end of the abdomen. 

Yes, John ; they are like our fireflies only they 
shine very much brighter. 

Some of the large ones make a light bright 
enough to read by, and the people use them 
when traveling at night. They are put to a pretty use 
by the ladies of the countries where they are found. 
The cucuyos, as they are called, are caught and kept 
in little cages of fine wire and fed on sugar cane. 





Now when milady is ready to go to a party she 
takes her little cucuyos, puts them in gauze bags, and 
fastens them in her hair or on her dress, where they 
shine, ¡ª Uving jewels to enhance her beauty. When she 
comes home again she carefully gives her 
Il\ shming little friends a bath to refresh them. 
'\^ They have to be bathed twice a day and 
f' carefully fed and cared for or they will 
f^^ die and their shining light go out. 
^^ Yes, they light up the dark 
woods at night like so many 
little lamps. It is said that 
travelers who have to be out 
at night fasten cucuyos to 
their boots, and when they 
are through using them they 
carefully return them to the 
bushes. 
Yes, May; it is a pity the larvaB 
re so destructive, as the elaters are 
such pretty and interesting little creatures. 









The Buprestids 

No, my boy, that is not an elater. 
It looks like one, but it has no spine 
to jump with, and it is much handsomer 
in color than the black or gray elaters. 
See, it shines like some bright metal, 
and it is of a bronze color. You 
always know these fellows by their color. 

They are the buprestids, and their larvse 
wood borers. 

They are queer larvaB that have no legs 
that seem to have a very big head. But tht 
head is really tiny, and it is the segments back 
of it that are enlarged. It is a mischievous 
little creature, for it bores under the bark 
of trees and into the solid wood. Some 
injure apple trees in this way, and some 
prefer forest trees. 








The Firefly 




Ah, yes, Mollie ! that little loose-winged thing 
is a firefly. 

It is not a fly, of course ; it is a beetle, but 
its elytra are quite soft, not like the usual hard 
wing covers of the beetle folk. 
You cannot see it shine in the daytime, but if you 
turn it over, you will see the tail end of its abdomen 
turn white every few moments ; and if you take it into 
a dark room, the last segments of the abdomen will 
shine out as though they were burning instead of 
seeming white. 

You cannot see its light in the daytime, because the 
brilliant sunlight overpowers its feeble little ray. But 
at night, which is the time it flies, its little lamps are 
seen shining all through the woods in the summer time. 
Yes, the little light givers love to fly over damp 
meadows, and sometimes the air seems to be spangled 
with tiny stars, there are so many of these little insects 
flashing all at once. 

Once in a while we see a soft greenish light shining 
steadily from some spot on the ground. This is a form of 
firefly not very common in our country ; it is called the 
glowworm. It is only the female that shines. She has 
no wings and is grublike in form. 




Yes, John ; we sometimes see a shining spot moving 
over the ground at night ; this is a firefly larva walking 
about, for the larvaB of our fireflies have the power to 
shine. 

Why, John, no doubt they shine as a signal to each 
other. It is their way of saying to their friends, " Here 
I am," and a pretty way it is too. 

Yes, indeed, we do love to see the fireflies on a dark 
night. 

Their larvae are dark-colored little fellows that, as a 
rule, live in the earth and eat snails and soft-bodied 
insects. 

Yes, indeed, they are harmless, and we are all glad 
that the child of the pretty firefly is not our enemy. 

No, little Nell ; the firefly cannot biun your fingers. 

We do not know how it makes its wonderful light. 

There are many beetles that look like the fireflies 
but that give no light. You all remember the long, 
narrow, black and yellow fellows that swarm over the 
golden-rods in the fall. They are soft like the fireflies, 
and are nearly related to them. 








The Stag Beetle 

So here we have Mr. Stag Beetle ! 
He is so named because of his jaws that 
in some species of the stag beetles are enor- 
mous and branched like the antlers of a stag. 

Digging into this 
rotten stump brings 
us to the larva of 
our stag beetle. See, 
it is a fat, white grub 
that lives on decayed 
wood. When ready 
to transform it makes 
for itself a nice little cocoon of 
the chips it has gnawed off. 

There are a great many stag beetles in the world, 
and some of them are remarkable looking creatures. 




i^M.y.hr- 











The Lamellicorn Beetle 

Now here goes a tumblebiig- 

Well met, little ball roller. Where 
do you suppose it is off to, 
May ? And why do you sup- 
pose it is so solemnly rolling 
that ball along ? 

Ah, tumblebug, tumble- 
bug ! we know your ways and why you are working so 
hard this summer day. 

How fast it trundles along ! 

True, John ; it does seem absurd to stand upside down 
and push a ball along behind one. But that is the 
tumbleb^g's way. 

See ! see ! Little Madam Tumblebug has climbed to 
the top of her ball and thrust out her little turtle head 
as far as she can to look about her. 

Why do I say little Madam Tumble- 
bug ? How do I know it is not little Mr, 
Tumblebug? 

Mr. Tumblebug would not take the 
trouble to roll a ball all by him- 
self. Often you will see him .^^ 
helping, though. And when he ^ -^i! 
is once at it he works with a will. 









Ah, yes ; over there is a pair of them rolling the ball 
together. The larger of the two is the female. 

True, Mollie ; his lordship does n't seem to help much. 
Half the time he is in the way, and now ¡ª the ras- 
cal ! ¡ª he is actually riding on the 
ball and letting his partner roll 
him along! 

There! he has tumbled 
off head over heels, and 
the ball has trundled off 
without him. Serves you 
right, sir. 
But see ! he is up and after it, 
and now he is doing his share. 
He walks ahead and pulls. 

Yes, indeed, little Nell; 
he still walks on , ^ '^^ 
his head. 

That is the way 
of the tumblebugs 
when they have a ball to roll. 

Now they have crossed the road and ¡ª is it possible 
they are going to try to climb up that bank ? 

There goes the ball ! Poor little fellows ! But they 
are after it. See them run. Now they have found it 
and rolled it back to the bank. 








There ! that naughty little male is on top of the ball 
again, and is making his partner lift him as well. 

But see ! he is not naughty ; he is wise. He has 
caught hold of the bank with his hind feet, and now 
he is pulling with all his might, while she pushes. 

See ! he is now on the top 
of the bank with his feet 
securely hooked in some 
weeds. She is almost stand- 
ing on her head and bal- 
ancing the ball, on the tip of 
her abdomen. 

Dear me! it is going to 
roll back again. No ; he has 
a better hold with his left 
foot. See him pull, and see " ¡ª ^^^ ' 

her push ! There ! hurrah ! it is up, and they are roll- 
ing it along as quietly as though they had done nothing 
uncommon. I should think they would want to stop 
and shake hands. 

Well done, little tumblebugs. You knew what you 
were about; and you, little gentleman, were wiser 
than we. 

It is not fair to judge a tumblebug by human standards. 

Yes, John; we should try to put ourselves in the 
tumblebug's shoes before we judge it. 






Indeed, May, you are right. We should never judge 
anybody without first understanding the matter from 
the other person's point of view. 

But where have our tumblebugs gone ? 

Ah, yes ; they have rolled their ball under that pile of 
dead leaves. See, they are burying it. 

Now you can guess what all this ball rolling is 
about. 

That i^ so, Mollie ; the female wishes to lay her eggs 
in the ball, and when it is buried she will do so. 

Sometimes the ball is made of rich earth, but gener- 
ally it is made of cow dung or of horse manure. 

These black tumblebugs are nearly always to be 
found in cow pastures. 

They fly well, and go whizzing over the ground until 
they find what they want. 

John has caught a tumblebug for us to look at. Ah ! 
it has a good strong means of defense. But we are 
going to look at you, sir, in spite of the dreadful odor 
you give forth to prevent us. 

Right, May ; it is not a bug at all ; it is a beetle. 

It is a scavenger, clearing up the dirt of the pastures ; 
it is a lamellicom scavenger. 

There are numbers of lamellicom beetles, and the 
family gets its name lamellicom from the shape of the 
antennae. 




You see they are like clubs at the end, and the clubs 
are made of the last segments of the antennae, which 
are flattened and enlarged like plates. 

LamelUcorn comes from two Latin words meaning 
plate and horn, so they are plate horns, or plate 
antennae, and the beetles that bear such antennae are 
called lamellicorn beetles. 

Here is a picture of the antennae enlarged. 
Yes, indeed ; such antennae afford room for a great 
many sense organs, and the tumblebugs can smell 
exceedingly well. The adults eat decaying animal 
and vegetable matter, as do also the larvae. 

Why do you suppose the tumblebugs roll a 
ball of food material off by itself and biu-y it? 
Why do they not lay the eggs right in the manure ? 

They are wise little people. They know that many 
voracious larvae live in dung, and that these would 
devour their eggs or larvae; for other insects besides 
tumblebugs use maniu-e for food. So 
they cut out a ball from the general 
supply and roll it to a safe place. 
Here is one making 
ball. See, the ball is 
p^.r^ nearly separated from 
y j^i^^ VT^Ti ^ r" , the rest of the manure. 
"^ ' '-=^;^ ¡ª ^^ - Watch and see how it uses 







its little flat, sharp-edged head for a spade. Now its 
head is quite out of sight under the wall. See it pat 
the ball with its little hands. 

It digs and pats until the ball is quite firm and round 
before it tries to roll it. 

Here is a picture of the front foot enlarged. 

You see the tarsus is very small ; it is often turned 
under out of the way. 

The tibia is flat and broad. Yes, Charlie ; it is modi- 
fied to form a good tool for patting and digging. 

No, May ; not all the turablebugs are black. Some are 
very beautiful in color, and shine like polished metal. 

Yes, you have aU seen the shining green or bronze- 
colored tumblebugs, but they are not as common as 
these black fellows. 

No, Nell, we do not need to ask why they are called 
tumblebugs. It is enough to see them tumbling around 
on the ground. Very often their ball rolls away with 
them, and over and over they go, clinging to it as well 
as they can. 

Moreover, tumblebugs are great fighters. Sometimes 
one will come along and try to take the ball from 
another instead of making one for herself. When this 
happens there is trouble. The one attacked starts off with 
her ball ; the would-be robber grasps it and tries to roll 
it in another direction. Then comes a tug of war, or 





rather a tumble of war, in which one finally succeeds in 
rolling the ball away from the other. The other at once 
gives chase and the pulling and tumbling about begin 
all over again. Sometimes both leave the ball and grap- 
ple with each other. After wrestling awhile one con- 
quers the other and goes back to the ball, but the enemy 
was not really conquered and in a moment is racing 
after the receding ball. How the trouble is finally settled 
I have never been able to find out. 

The sacred scarab of Egypt is a_^^ 
tumblebug. 

It is larger and more ornamental 
than our tumblebugs, but it provides 
for its young in the same way. 

Here is a picture of the Egyptian -^~ 
scarab. 

It was held sacred by the ancient 
Egyptians because of its habit of roll- 
ing a ball of earth which to them was symbolical of the 
world. Connected with this beetle there were a great 
many superstitions which you may some time read about. 

It was carved in stone and in jewels and put in the 
tombs of the dead, and it is also seen carved on pillars 
and in temples. The Egyptian stone scarab is often 
seen in museums. It is flat on the under side, which is 
marked with hieroglyphics. 








Here is a picture showing the upper and the 
under sides of a scarab. 

There are other lamellicorn scavengers besides 
the tumblebugs in our pastures. 

One of them is a big black fellow with a horn 
on its thorax, but it does not roll a ball. It digs 
a deep tunnel under the manure and carries the 
manure down to a hollow place at the bottom 
of the tunnel. Here the eggs are laid. Probably it fills 
up the tunnel, but I cannot say 
certainly about that. 

Yes, John ; our May beetles, or 
June bugs, as they are also called, 
are lamellicorn beetles, but they 
are not scavengers. 

Their antennaB are like those of 
the tumblebugs, but their larvaB, 
which are rather large white 
grubs, live in the earth and eat the roots of grasses and 
other plants. They sometimes do a very great deal of 
damage. The adult May beetles eat foliage and often 
injure young trees. 

The goldsmith beetle is very much like the May beetle, 
only it is yellow, and the head and thorax shine as 
though they had been polished. They are blundering 
fellows like the May beetles and often come whizzing 








into the room at night, striking against the lamp, 
thumping on the wall, getting tangled in our hair^ and 
finally tumbling on their backs in the comer. 

Yes, little Nell; we hear their funny little feet scratch, 
scratch, scratching in their efforts to turn over'. And 
then what do we say ? " Oh ! never mind; it's nothing . 
but a clumsy old May beetle." 



The Long-Horned Beetles 




Z-^-^-ZrZ-^'OOO-Z-^rZ-OOO ! 

Who is this humming low as he flies over the lawn? 
Ah ! the big, black Prionus. 
Rascal, what are you doing there ? 








What, John, ¡ª it digs holes in the lawn? 
Yes, it lays its eggs on the roots of the 
trees into which the larvae bore. 

This is one of the Long-homed beetles. 
See how spiny is the thin edge of its 
thorax. 

Yes, MoUie ; its legs are strong and large, 

and it is a great digger and a strong runner. 

The larvae of the Long-homed beetles are 

soft, whitish grubs, but they have very hard 

and powerful little jaws. 

Most of the Long-horned beetles lay their 
eggs on the limbs or tmnks of trees and 
the larvaB bore into the solid wood, 
where they are very destructive. 
Here is one of the Long-homed 
beetles that often come flying 
into a lighted room at night. He 
is quite a beauty with his straight, 
tan-colored wings. Yes ; he has 
three little sharp spines like 
needle points on each side of the ^ 
thorax. 

Yes, May; some of the Long- 
homed beetles are very beauti- 
ful indeed. 






Ah, see ! May has one of these beauties for " ^^ 
us to look at. 

It is the beautiful maple borer, and gay it 
is, with its black dress marked with yellow. 
It is too bad that our beauty should lay its ^ 
eggs on the sugar maples that the larvaB may 
bore into the trees. 

Another beauty belonging to this family is 
the Cloaked Knotty-horn. 

Here is one that Mabel found the 
other day and kept to show us. 

Yes, little Nell ; it wears a yellow 

i^ cloak over its shining blue dress. The 

upper part. of the blue elytra, you see, 

is bright yellow. And no wonder it is 

called Knotty-horn ! 

Yes, Mabel; its antennae are 
composed of large, 
triangular segments, which is the 
case with the antennae in a number 
of the members of this family. 

Perhaps for the longest-horned of the Long-horns 
we should go to the sawyer. This beautiful gray 
and brown nuisance lays its eggs on pine and fir trees 
and the larvae bore into the solid wood, sometimes 
there being enough of them to kill the tree. 








The sawyers are funny little people and they wave 
their long antennae about in quite a captivating manner. 

A near relative to this sawyer is the round-headed 
apple-tree borer, ¡ª a pale brown beetle, smaller than the 




sawyer, and with two white stripes running down its 
back from head to tail. It is one of the worst enemies 
our apple trees have, as the larva lives nearly three years 
and spends its time boring through the wood of the tree. 
There are a great many Long-homed beetles. 







The Colorado Potato Beetle 

Charlie says he has had enough 
of beetles. 

He has had to help "bug" his ^^i^Vi 
father's potatoes. 

Fortunately the potato bug, or 
Colorado potato beetle, as it is bet- 
ter called, is not as abundant as 
it used to be ; but it is still all 
too common. 

Oh, yes ! we all know how \ 
the little nuisance looks, with V, 
its striped back. And we know 
how its disagreeable reddish- 
yellow grubs look. 

We have all seen them in the potato fields. 

Had you lived before the year 1859 you would not 
have been troubled by the potato beetle. 

It then lived near the foot of the Rocky Mountains, 
feeding on the sand spur, a plant belonging to the 
potato family. But when the white settlers began to 
plant potatoes in Colorado, their foliage tasted so much 
better than sand-spur leaves to the discriminating bee- 
tles that they left their sand spurs and swarmed over 
the potatoes. 






Gradually they found their way eastward from potato 
patch to potato patch, until in about fifteen years they 
had conquered the country to the Atlantic Ocean. 

They lay their eggs on the potato leaves, which are 
devoured by the voracious larvaB. Some of the bee- 
tles remain underground in the pupal state all winter, 
the adult beetles emerging in the summer at the right 
time to lay their eggs on the young potato plants. 

True enough, John ; the potato beetle prospered 
greatly by changing its environment. 

The sand spurs at the foot of the Rocky Mountains 
supported but a small colony of beetles compared to the 
hordes that now devastate the country. 

Yes, Nell ; potato leaves were better food than sand 
spurs, and no doubt the beetles enjoyed the milder climate 
of the East. Anyway they multiplied prodigiously, two 
or three broods appearing in one season. 



The Oil Beetle 

May, why do you look so mischievous, and 

what are you holding so carefully in that box ? 

Oh ! an insect, a beautiful blue insect. Be 

\ careful how we open the box or it will kill us. 

Dear me ! has it such a tremendous sting, 

then? 






No sting at all. 

Then how can it kill us ? 

Open the box and we shall see. 

Phew! WeU, weU! 

You have been teasing it, May, and it does smell bad 
enough to make us want to drop it and run away. 

It is a beetle, in spite of the fact that its elytra over- 
lap. How short the elytra are ! 

Yes, Nell ; they do look like an old-fashioned over- 
skirt such as you were looking at in an old magazine of 
your mother's this morning. 

This queer, dark blue little scent bottle gets its strong 
odor from a yellow liquid that oozes out of its joints 
when disturbed, and because of this yellow, oily liquid it 
is sometimes called the oil beetle. 

It is not a pleasant beetle by any means, and you 
may be sure the birds let it severely alone, although 
it is so soft and juicy. 

Now I will tell you something odd about it. It is a 
blister beetle. Blister plasters are very often made of 
beetles. These plasters blister the skin and are used 
in sickness. The plasters are often called Spanish-fly 
blisters, because they used to be made from Spanish 
beetles that were easily collected. 

The beetles are dried and powdered, and then mixed 
with an ointment and spread on cloth. 






^^-¡ª- 



Those who collect the beetles as well as those who 
powder them have to be very careful or they will get 
their hands blistered. ? 
Yes ; I think that if you handled May's 
blue beetle much it would probably 
blister your hands. 

These fellows are quite often found 
on buttercups. 

The larvae of the blister beetles have 
a curious way of getting their living. 
The eggs are sometimes laid in 
flowers and the larvae watch for 
the coming of a bee to which they 
can attach themselves. They suck 
j the blood of the bee and when it flies 
home they leave it and eat its honey and its larvae. 

Not all the blister beetles are shaped like our blue oil 
beetle, but they all have soft elytra. Here is a picture 
of three of them. 




The Weevils 

What is that, John? There is no use going chest- 
nutting this year, the nuts are so wormy? 

Then at least let us gain something from the 
worms. 

What do you think they are ? 








Ah, I see ; you believe they are the larvae of some- 
thing. Yes, the little fat, white grubs that eat the 
chestnuts before you get a chance to are larvae, and 
I think that most of them belong to the weevils. 

The weevils are great nut eaters and we find the 
grubs also in acorns. 

The weevils are the snout beetles, and for the most 
part they are little fellows. 

The head is prolonged in front into a long beak or 
snout, and at first you might mistake them for bugs. 
But the long, slender snout is not a tube. At the tip 
end of it are tiny jaws, which though so small are yet 
very hard and strong, enabling the beetle to bore through 
nut shells. 

It is rather a pretty little gray or brown nuisance and 
its antennae, as you see, are bent at a sharp angle and 
are fastened halfway down the snout. 







Some weevils are able to bore into the hard 
hickory nut and some injure grain and 
seeds. Some again eat fruit, and 
one is very destructive to the 
plum, sometimes quite destroy- 
ing the whole crop. The beetle 
lays her eggs in the 
^^^^ fruit and the larvae eat 
^^^^ it. The rascals we find 
wormy cherries are usually weevil 
grubs. 
The weevils have cunning little pads on their feet, 
and what do you suppose they use their 
long snouts for ? 

Yes ; they bore into nuts, fruits, and 
grain with them. 

They bore a hole with the snout, then 
they lay an egg in the hole and poke it 
down with the snout. 











Lady Bombus 

Now who comes droning over the flowers ? 

See! she has settled on a clover head 
and is burying her face in it. 

Everybody knows our friend Bumble- 
bee. And I think we all like her lady- 
ship and love to see her hovering 
about the flowers and digging her 
shining black face down into them. 

Yes, John ; she is after the 
honey. She is a fine bee and we \ 
will call her Lady Bombus, be- 
cause Bombus is the name of the 
genus to which she belongs. 

No ; it will do no harm to catch 
her, if you can. 

See ! John has put a tumbler i , m 
over her and slipped a postal card 
under the tumbler so that she can- 
not escape. What a buzzing ! How angry my lady is ! 


MoUie says she" has caught bumblebees in pumpkin 
blossoms to hear them sing. When you see one in the 
bottom of the flower you just double the petals over the 
top ¡ª and there you have your prisoner. 

Yes, they do sing, but not as we do; their song 
comes from their spiracles where their vocal organs 
are located. 

You see they breathe at the spiracles, so it is quite 
natural they should sing there too ; but they also sing ¡ª 
or buzz ¡ª by vibrating the upper part of the body and 
the upper parts of the wings. If you touch the thorax 
of one of these singing bees, you will/(2eZ the song as 
well as hear it. 

Yes, May ; it can be felt very distinctly through the 
delicate petals of our pumpkin flower, which vibrate so 
rapidly as to tickle our fingers sometimes. 

May says an angry bumblebee emits a bad odor. So 
it does, as you can easily discover from our captive here 
in the tumbler. It is a strange odor the angry bee 
gives forth, a little like honey and a good deal like 
bee poison. 

Poor frightened little bee ! Now she has settled down 
on the clover head that John squeezed in through a 
crack between the card and the rim of the tumbler. 

She seems to have forgotten her excitement as she 
explores the treasures of the clover. 





Her Wings 

Just notice her wings folded over her back. 

Yes ; her back is broader than her wings, 
which do look small for such a heavy body. 

They are large enough, however, to enable 
her to dart about with great rapidity, and fly 
very swiftly indeed when she makes a " bee 
line" for home. It is because she can move 
her wings so quickly that she can fly so well. 

Yes, Mollie; we get the expression "bee line" from 
.. the bees, because they take the most 
£¤- direct route home when they have a 







bee's back ? If you were to go home with Lady Bombus 
you could guess. 

John says he has been to her home, which is in a hol- 
low under ground. She has to crawl down between the 
grass blades and through a little hole in the ground ; and 
when she finally reaches her nest she still needs narrow 
wings in order to move about in the restricted space. 

We have here a dead bumblebee that was found in the 

house the other day, so we can easily examine its wings. 

There are four, you see, and they are all used in flying. 

The outer ones are larger and the inner 

^>ones slip under them, out of the way, 

when the wings are folded. 

These brown wings are thin and gauzy, 
though not nearly so delicate as the wings 
of the honeybee. 
It is the gauzy wings that give the name to the Bee 
Order, ¡ª membrane-wings, or Hymenoptera. 

No ; you cannot always see four wings on a bee. The 
reason is that these champion flyers have a way of hook- 
ing together the two wings on each side, 
thus making one strong wing. ""^^^^^^^N^ 

Yes, indeed. May ; they do really hook ^^-^ 
the wings together. You can see the hooks with the 
little magnifying glass. There is a row of them on 
the upper edge of the under wing. 






Now look on the lower edge of the upper wing and 
you will find a sort of fold or groove into which these 
hooks catch. 

You can quite easily hook the wings together, and 
when you have done so ¡ª see, John has done it ! ¡ª you 
would have to look carefully indeed to discover that 
there were two wings. 

All bees, so far as I know, have these wing fasteners. 

What an old fuzzy coat our bumblebee is ! Jacket of 
yellow fur and abdomen clad in bands of black \s 
and yellow fur ! 

What is that, May ? She may be pretty, but 
she certainly is not good-natured ? 

Ah, May ! you surely do not judge her fairly. 

Of course she will sting you if you pick her up in 
your fingers. But who can blame her for that ? She is 
only defending herself from what she thinks is an enor- 
mous and terrible enemy. 

If you do not frighten her, she is the gentlest of insects 
and never stings unless you threaten her nest or herself. 

Honey and Beebread 

Now just see what we can do with her. All bees are 
very fond of honey and will leave any other sweet for 
it. Knowing we were to look at bees to-day, Mollie 







brought a little bottle of honey, 
'and now we will put a drop of 
it on my finger. 

What, Nell, ¡ª you want it on 
your finger ? 
Are you sure you will not be afraid when 
^ the bee crawls on your finger to get it? 
No, you are not afraid of old Fuzzy Bumbles? 
Well, then, stick the end of your finger in the honey. 
Now raise the tumbler a little bit and put the tip of your 
finger in. 

Ah, how quickly those sensitive antennae know that 
honey is near ! Lady Bombus is already tapping Nell's 
finger with her feelers. 

Yes, Ned ; the antennae are bent at a sharp angle in 
the middle; that is one way by which we know the 
bees, ¡ª they all have these bent antennae. 

Ah ! now Lady Bombus has clasped her two front feet 
about Nell's finger while she sucks up the honey. 

Raise the tumbler very gently, John ; now remove it 
altogether. See ! she does not move away. Now Nell, 
slowly raise your finger. Don't be afraid ; it will never 
enter her good little heart to sting you. 

There ! she has clasped two more feet about Nell's fin- 
ger. Now she has let go of the card altogether and is 
clinging to the little girl's finger eating the honey. 






While she is thus busy let us take a good look at 
those yellow balls on her hind legs. 

Do you know what they are made of ? John says he 
has part of one that fell off when she was so excitedly 
buzzing about in the tumbler after he first caught her. 

It is soft, you see, and pastelike, something like stiff 
cake dough. 

It smells like honey and has a sweetish taste. 

Yes, it is beebread ; and our little lady here is taking 
it home to the nest to feed the young bees. 

John says it is made of pollen gathered from the 
flowers and mixed with nectar to make it stick together. 







Pollen Baskets 




Charlie thinks that is a funny place to carry it. 

Perhaps it is a, very good place when you come to 
think of it. 

You see it is on the outside of the hind legs, where it 
is as much out of the way as it very well can be. 

There is something peculiar about the hind l^s of 
bumblebees. They 'are modified to form baskets in 
which to carry pollen. 
^^^^ Look at this picture of a bee's leg magnified. 

The femur, you see, is very broad, and is hol- 
lowed on the outside, the hollow being bordered 
by stiff hairs. You can see this little basket 
quite plainly on our dead bee. 

Yes, indeed ; this arrangement exists on purpose that 
the bee may carry home her pollen. 

Have you ever watched a bumblebee collecting pollen ? 

She wallows about over the pollen-covered flower, 
working with her hairy legs and getting her hairy body 
all dusted over with the little pollen grains that stick 
to the hairs. Then she rubs her hind legs, which are 
covered on the tibias with little stiff and hairy combs, 
over her body and collects the pollen, which she finally 
scrapes from one leg into the basket of the other. 

We must watch her do it this very day. 






Combs and Brushes 




Yes, you are quite right, 
Ned; those other spines and 
brushes on the leg are to keep 
our pretty friend clean. She is constantly cleaning her 
face, and her body, and her gauzy wings with her legs. 

Yes ; she carries her combs and brushes on her legs. 

May says she is doubling up her fore leg and drawing 
it over her antenna. Yes, that is in order that she may 
clean the antenna. 

Perhaps you do not know that she has a round comb 
on the upper end of her tibia. Well, she has, right at 
the joint. And there is a hard little scraper hanging 
down from the lower end of the femur. 

When she draws her leg over the antenna, the an- 
tenna slips into the round comb; then she shuts the 
scraper down on it, and as she pulls the antenna 
through every particle of dust is cleaned off. 

Clever? Well, I should think so ! 

If you examine this picture, perhaps you can see how 
it is done. And if you examine the bee's leg with a ^^ 
magnifying glass, you will see yet better. ^"^^/^ 

Yes, all bees have these cleaners for their /Jx I 

antennae, ¡ª one on each fore leg. While ^/"^ ^.^^-"'^^ 
we have been talking about the antennae ^ 






cleaners our bee has flown away. No doubt she has 
gone home with her load of honey. 

What good will the honey do those at home when 
she has eaten it herself, May wants to know. 

Well, the truth is, May, she has n't eaten it. She has 
only swallowed it, and when she likes she can pump it 
up again and put it into the places provided for it in 
her nest. 

The Honey Sac 

She has a little sac in her body on purpose to hold 
nectar from the flowers while she is carrying it home. 
It is a tiny sac as clear as a bubble and holds only a 
small drop. 

No, May; nectar is not just the same as honey. The 
bees collect the sweet nectar from the flowers and in 
some way convert it into honey. If you were to gather 
nectar, you could not change it into honey, but the bees 
are able to do so. 

Yes, they sometimes swallow pollen, too, and this 
goes into the honey sac with the nectar ; but there is a 
tiny strainer in this remarkable honey sac, by means of 
which the pollen is all strained out, and only the clear, 
pure honey left to go into the honeycomb. 

What, Nell ¡ª your bee has comeback ? She cannot live 
far away, and she wants the rest of that drop of honey. 







See ! she goes straight to Nell's finger. Now 
she has settled on it and is finishing the drop 
which, fortunately, Nell had not wiped off. 



W^l_y <^:2 ___^? ^ ^^^^^^^^^3^ 









The Tongue 

Watch her little black tongue go in and out. 

How fast she licks it up ! 

She lets down a sort of stiff tube first, and out of /\ 
the lower end of it comes wriggling a soft little 
tongue. 

That tongue is so important. Lady Bombus, that 
we shall have to consider it. See ! here is a picture 
of it magnified. You see the hairy little tongue 
coming down below the sheath. 







Well, that sheath is not so simple as it looks. 
Here is another picture showing how it can be 

separated into four parts. 

The four stiff parts lie olose together, forming 

the tube in which the long tongue lies. 

Yes, John; she has good strong little jaws; but 

these you can see better when her tongue sheath 

is folded back under her head, which is where she 
carries it when it is not in use. 

Here is a picture showing the jaws open. The jaws 
are very useful to some bees, ¡ª more useful ,,''"x 
to some others than to the bimiblebees. /i ti 

All insects have these mouth parts, only|>r^*^ 
they are shaped differently in different species, i x^""""^ 

They are quite distinct in the grasshopper, ^ 
and quite short. You can see them move when the 
grasshopper eats. 

In some insects the mouth parts are all separate and 
of about the same size. 

Yes, John ; it is so in the grasshoppers. 

In some insects a portion of the mouth parts are very- 
large, while other parts are very small. In some the 
mouth parts grow together to form tubes, as you know. 

In our bees the mouth parts form tubes without grow- . 
ing together. 

We must now look at your home, little bee. 





The Nest 



How can we do this ? Why, a man was plowing near 
here yesterday, and he plowed up a biunblebees' nest. 

Yes, indeed; there loas a time! The man ran, and 
the horses ran, and everybody was very much excited 
for a little while. One of the horses was stung twice, 
and the man who had his hat off fighting the bees that 
were buzzing around him had a jab from a stinger on 
the top of his head. 

You could not blame the bees for trying to defend 
their home. 

Sometimes boys dig up bumblebees' nests for the sake 
of the honey there. 

What, May, ¡ª you should think they would be pretty- 
looking objects ? 

Oh! they run when the bees get after them, and 
fight them off with their caps. And if they do get 
stung, why that is nothing compared to the fun of 
taking the nest, ¡ª so they think. 

But to return to our plowed-up bumblebees' nest. 

Towards night, when the bees had quieted down, some 
of us went out and picked up the nest and put it in a 
box, and there it is, ready to be looked at. 

No ; I hardly think the bees that are in the box will 
sting us. There are only a few old ones left, and they 







do not seem at all ugly. They seem to understand 
there is no lifee fighting any more. 

See ! here is the nest. Yes ; it does look like a giant 



honeycomb, 
it, though* 




Toil would hardly care to eat 
It i^ not made of wax. 

In order to under- 
stand just how it 
was made, we shall 
, have to go back 
to last spring, 
when this nest 
was first started. There was only one bee to start it, ¡ª 
one large queen bee. 

Yes, Nell ; we can call her Queen Bombus. 
She had been lying all winter hidden away in some 
safe comer, and as soon as spring came out she crawled 
and flew about to find, a place to make her home. 

Finally she selected a little hole she found in the 
ground in the meadow. 

Perhaps the hole once held a mouse's nest. 
But it was vacant then, and Queen Bombus by 
carrying out bits of earth soon enlarged it until it 
suited her. 

Then she flew to the flowers and gathered balls of 
pollen on her hind legs. She hurried home with load 
after load of pollen, until she had quite a lump of it. 




In this pollen she laid a few eggs, and from these there 
soon hatched ¡ª what do you think? 

John thinks some sort of larva hatched out. 



Young Bees 

Yes, John ; out of the eggs hatched little white, leg- 
less things more helpless even than a maggot, for they 
could not even skip about. 

They stayed quietly in the mass of pollen, which, of 
course, they ate ; and of course they grew and grew fast. 
By the time they had eaten quite a little den about 
themselves they were ready to become pupae. When 
this happened they began to spin silk from their 
mouths, as the caterpillars do, and soon each larva had 
made a silken cocoon about itself. It is the silken 
cocoons that we have here in the box. These cells that 
look like honeycomb are made of silk instead of wax, 
and they hold young bees instead of honey. 

As soon as the bee larva has spun its cocoon it trans- 
forms into a pupa and lies quite still for a few days. 

Then you know what happens next. Yes ; it trans- 
forms into a perfect winged bee, bites its way out, 
and begins the work of living in the outer world. 

Here is one of the young bees just coming 
out. It is a little fellow and ¡ª yes, it has white 





hair. But its fuzz will turn yellow in a day or two. 
Young bees start out in life very pale and dainty little 
things. 

This is a worker bee, and they are never as large as 
the queens. 

Workers 

When the queen bee starts her nest she lays only a 
few eggs at first. These hatch into workers. As soon 
as the workers are strong enough, they go out in search 
of honey and pollen. 

But they do not desert their home and start one of 
their own. No, indeed; these faithful little workers fly 
to the old nest with their booty and help the queen 
mother, who now stays at home andjeaves all the food 
gathering to the workers. 

The pollen comes in fast now, with so many to bring 
it, the queen lays many eggs, and young bees ¡ª always 
workers ¡ª begin to appear in large numbers. 

The worker bee is a small female, but it lays no eggs 
as a rule. It is the nurse and the housekeeper, taking 
care of the nest and carrying home the food. 

Because the bees live together in this way in com- 
munities, all working together for the common good, 
we call them " social " insects. If one were separated 
from the rest it would soon die. 






Yes, May; the reason we see only small bumblebees 
in the middle of the summer is because the big queens 
are staying at home. 

Oh, yes ; the little bees can sting, but they do not go 
about looking for trouble. They never sting unless 
they are very much excited. But if you disturb their 
nest you may be sure they will punish you to the best 
of their ability. 

Sometimes the workers fill the empty cocoons with 
honey. Their honey is rather strong in flavor, but 
children like to eat it. Bears like it, too, and in spite 






of the frantic stings of the luckless workers Bruin will 
rip open a bees' nest, if he can find it, and eat up every- 
thing there. 

Sometimes there is quite a good deal of wax found in 
a bumblebees' nest, and then again there will be none at 
all. It is the honeybees that are so skillful in wax making. 

Queens and Drones 

Mollie wants to know where the queen bee comes 
from, ¡ª if only workers hatch out of the eggs. 

Well, late in the summer a few of the larvae turn into 
big queens. Others of the larvae turn into king bees ; these 
are also large, though not quite so large as the queens. 
What is that. May, ¡ª you never heard of a king bee ? 
Oh, yes, you have, only you called it by another name. 
We usually call the king bees drones. 
Only the male bee is a drone. 

Yes, May ; he is always scolded for being 
lazy, but that is not fair. 
He has no honey sac and no pollen baskets, 
so he cannot help provision the hive. 

He is the big, square-bodied bee with long 
antennae that we often see sitting on the flowers 
in the fall. You can easily tell him by his long, 
drooping feelers and his large wings. 






If you watch the bumblebees on the flowers in the 
fall, you will soon be quite sure which are the drones. 
And when you are sure, you can safely put your hand 
over one and pick him up. 

He will laake a great buzzing, but he will not sting. 

Ned says he saw a boy once who had his hand full 
of big bumblebees that did not sting him. No 
doubt, Ned, they were droneSj aod you could 
have handled them as well as he. 

The drone is perfectly harmless, and 
reason is that he has no sting. 

The sting of the bee is its ovipositor, aud 
females, therefore, have stings. 

May wants to know ^^^^ 
what would happen if ^^ '^^^''^ ^ \^^^ 
you should take up a ^|>^^i^ ^,K/ 
bee, thinking it was a \^ 

drone, and it should turn out to 
be a queen. / 

In that case you might pay 
the penalty of yoin: mistake, 
though the queens do 
not like to stiug. 

After all,- a bee sting 
isn't so terrible, and there is not 
much danger of making a mistake 







if you are careful. The long, drooping antennaB and the 
square end to the abdomen, set with rather stiff hairs, 
readily distinguish the drone. 

Ned asks if it is true that the bumblebees turn the 
drones out to perish in the fall of the year. 
- No, Ned ; that is not true of the bumblebees. 

When fall comes all the bumblebees excepting the 
young queens die. These hide away until the next 
season, when they come out and each one starts a nest 
for herself. 

We see them in the spring, flying about, poking into 
every rubbish pile, and examining carefully the side- 
walks and the fields ; for they build their nests in any 
convenient and sheltered spot, and what farmer has 
not had a bumblebees' nest in one of his 
sheds where things were thrown down in 
a less orderly manner than they might 
have been? 

The bees will take possession and will 
H, heartily sting anybody who interferes. 

The Sting 

The queens do not like to sting. You see, the sting 
sometimes sticks fast and cannot be pulled out again. 
When this happens the frightened bee jerks loose, 






leaving her sting in the wound. This is a fatal accident, 
and the bee soon dies as a result of it. 

This happens less frequently to the large, strong 
bumblebees than to the smaller honeybees. Indeed, 
a honeybee almost always loses its sting when it jabs 
it into a human being's tough skin, and it is almost 
impossible to make the honeybee queen sting. You can 
tease her and pinch her, and yet she will not run the 
risk of losing her precious sting by runniag it into you. 
Queen bees never like to sting anything but another bee. 

Yes, Ned ; I guess most everybody knows how the 
little black bee sting looks with the little bubble at the 
top. 

That little bubble that comes out with the sting is 
really the cause of almost all the pain the sting 
occasions. 

John says he has heard it is a sac of poison. 

And that is just what it is, ¡ª a sac of poison. 

The muscles in the body of the bee squeeze this 
poison down through the sting into your skin, and it 
is the poison that makes the tiny woimd so painful and 
causes the flesh about it to swell so badly. 

If it were not for the poison, a bee sting would not 
hurt any more than a pin prick. 

Why do you suppose the sting sticks so fast ? 

Well, for the same reason a fishhook sticks. 






Ned says it is the barbs on the end of a hook that 
make it stick. 

And if you can believe it, Ned, this outrageous little 
sting has ever so many tiny barbs at its end. 

They are too small to be seen without a strong mag- 
nifying glass, but' they are very efficient, nevertheless. 
Here is a picture of a sting magnified. 
? Now is n't that a pretty thuig to stick into your 
skin? 

The bee's sting was doubtless not given to it in 
the first place as a weapon of defense, but for quite 
another purpose, which we will discover later. 

But the bee learned to use it as a means of defense, 
and now that is the only use to which it is put by 
the bee family. 

The bumblebees are our good friends, and we should 
never needlessly kill one or break up a nest. If it were 
not for the bimiblebees we would have no red clover, 
as their long tongues alone are able to 
fertilize the little clover blossoms that you 
know are packed together in each clover 
head. If you examine a clover head care- 
fully you will understand about it. 







Lady Apis 

Fairy, fairy on the flowers, who are you, little 
fairy? 

See what dainty wings ! and how fast they buzz ! 
May says she thinks the honeybees are the prettiest 
of all the insects. 

MoUie says she loves to hear them hum and she 
loves to see them flying about. 

They have tongues like the bumblebee, only not so 
long. They cannot get the red-clover honey, but they 
can get that from the little white clover, ¡ª and how 
they do love it ! You will always see honeybees where 
there is a field of white clover, and we all 
know how delicious 
white-clover honey is. 
No, the honeybee is 
not called Bombus, 
but Apis. But like the 
bumblebee it is, as you 
know, a social insect, 
living in communi- 
ties and all working 
together for 
Ai^i^ the common 
good. 







Yes, John; our little Lady Apis is formed very much 
like her big relative, Lady Bombus, as to legs, tongue, 
and sting. 

She carries her pollen in baskets on the hind legs and 
stings in defense of her home. 

She has antenna cleaners and a honey sac, but in one 
respect she differs from the other bees of this country. 

Wax 

Ned says he can guess what that is; it is her wax- 
making habit. 

Right, Ned ; the honeybee is the great wax maker of 
the world. 

Now where do you suppose this wax comes from ? 

Mollie says she guesses the bee collects the wax from 
plants. 

No, Mollie ; our dainty bee actually makes the wax. 

She sweats it out on the under side of the abdomen. 
There it appears as little white scales that lie in depres- 
sions like little pockets on the rings of the abdomen. 

Now, Nell, what are you laughing so about ? 

You never heard of anything so funny as sweating 
out wax ? 

Well, it may be funny, but it is a very useful habit 
to the bees. 





You see the bees live in a hive or a hollow tree, and 
they do not die when winter comes. They all live, 
queen and workers, ¡ª all but the drones. There are a 
great many thousands of bees in a hive and it takes a 
large supply of food to carry them through the winter. 

You know very well what their food is. It is honey 
and beebread. 

Yes, Nell; they live on bread and honey. 

Their bread is made of pollen mixed with honey and 
is like the mass of pollen the bumblebees store away. 

No, indeed. May; our dainty bees are not satisfied to 
live on beebread alone. They want pure honey as well, 
and so they make the delicate honeycomb from the wax 
that oozes out of their own clean little bodies. 

You can see the bees gathering honey on any sum- 
mer's day, and you must not forget their little honey 
sac with the strainer that holds the clear honey, free 
from any impurity. 

The making of honeycomb is one of the most Wi)n- 
derful things in the world. 

If you could look into a hive when the honeycomb 
was being made you would find the wax-making bees 
hung up like a curtain in the hive, clinging to each 
other by their feet and keeping perfectly still. 

No, John; the bees do not all make wax at once. 
Only part of them do this while the others are off after 







honey or doing other work in the hive. 
I'be wax-making bees gorge themselves 
with honey, and then keep 
still until the heavy meal 
digests. A part of the honey 
* they have eaten becomes con- 
verted mto wax. 

Yes, May; eating honey is 
very different from carrying it in 
the honey sac. When the bees eat 
it, it passes on through the honey 
/ \f]!^ S i^^^ sac into the stomach, where it is 
digested. They can pass it on when they 
please, and they can hold it back in the honey sac when 
they please. 

Ned is surprised that bees have stomachs. 
The truth is, Ned, all animals are alike in a general 
way. All of them, from the humblest up to man him- 
self, breathe, digest food, and give off waste substances 
from the body in essentially the same way. 

When you have studied living things more you will 
understand this beautiful truth. 






Honeycomb 



Now about honeycomb. 

When the wax has filled the little pockets of the 
wax workers, they take this brittle substance in their 
little mandibles, or jaws, and chew it, so you see 
how very useful the hard little jaws are to the honey- 
bees. They chew the wax until it is soft and can be 
molded into shape. Then the fim begins. 

You know how a piece of honeycomb looks. 

Yes, Nell ; it is like a great. /^\^^ many long little 
boxes piled up close together. 

Yes, they really are boxes, or 
cans, or cups, just as you _3 __f 
choose to think of them. ; 

Well, the bees have to ,^^'Mp f^:^^ --^ >^^ 

make these wax cups, and yon '^^^([l^^ ^ ¡ê^ 
must not forget that the honeycomb 
has a double set of cups piled up bottom to bottom 
and opening on opposite sides of the comb. 

How do you suppose the little bees do it ? 

Try it yourself with a lump of wax. Make if you can 
just one of those fragile cells, and make it as thin and 
as perfect in form as the bee makes it. 

My dears, you could not do it. Try as long and as 
hard as you like, you could not do it. 






Yet the bees, dozens at a time, work together on the 
honeycomb. They mold the wax into shape with their 
homy mandibles, they pat it with their feet, they pinch 
it and pull it, all standing side by side and working 
together. 

No, May; one bee does not make a whole cell; ever 
so many bees work at each cell, and yet they do not 
get in each other's way nor do they interfere with each 
other's work. 

When they get through there is the marvelous honey- 
comb, made of munberless cells, perfect, empty, ready 
for the honey. 

If you look at honeycomb carefully, you will see 
there is a top and a bottom to it. If you stand it upside 
down, the honey will run out. 

See this honeycomb. Now is it right 
side up or wrong side up ? 
Yes, it is wrong side up. 
If the caps at the end should break, 
the honey would run out. 

Now John is holding it right side up, and you see 
the cells slant up a little, so 
that the top is higher than 
the bottom. 

This helps the bee when 
she is filling the comb with 







honey. It does not run out but remains in place uniil 
she can get the cap on. 

Yes, Nell ; when the cell is full, the bee makes a tight 
wax cap or cover over the top. 

No, John; the cells are not all of exactly the same 
size, even in the middle of the comb. But they are 
nearly the same size, excepting that sometimes, in the 
corners, the cells are large in size or irregular in form 
to fill up the space. 

True, May ; the cells are not curved and smooth inside 
like a cup. They are six-sided, excepting again those 
on the edges, which are somewhat rounded on 
the outside. 

Why do you think the bee makes six-sided 
cells ? 

If you draw a figure with six equal sides, you 
will see. You can place six-sided figures around it and 
fill up all the space. 

Now draw a five-, or a seven-, or an eight-sided figure, 
and you will see how impossible it would 
be to finish it and make a honeycomb of it. 
John says squares would fit together as 
well as hexagons. 

That is true, John. And why do you suppose the 
bees do not make four-sided cells instead of six-sided 
ones ? 








' Yes, that is true ; the four-sided cups would not be 
nearly so strong. 

And so our Uttle architects have wisely chosen the 
one form of cell best suited to their needs. 

Do all the wax cells in the hive contain honey ? 
Nell says they do. 

John says they do not. Last summer he was on a 
farm where they took honey out of old-fashioned hives, 
and there were a great many cells that contained bee- 
bread instead of honey. 

We do not often see beebread these days, because 
man has made very clever hives for the bees, 'and these 
hives have little boxes on top. The bees put the bee- 
bread in the lower part of the hive in the honeycomb 
there, near the young. 

But in the top of the hive, where the little boxes are 
placed, the bees store the extra 
honey, and this hardly ever con- 
tains beebread. 

Yes ; the little glass cases of 
honey we buy in stores are taken 
from the tops of the hives. The 
wooden frames are put in a row, 
and when they are filled with 
honey they are taken out, and 
the glass sides put on to protect 








them on their way to market. We all like to eat the 
honey out of these glass cases. 

No, the bees do not miss this honey. They have 
plenty stored away in the bottom of the hive. And 
then you know that if honey should get scarce towards 
spring, the bee keeper, who is always on the watch, 
would find it out and feed the bees on sugar and water. 



Beehives 

Our neighbor has a hive, and I am sure he will be 
glad to have us make it a visit. 

We will be careful not to go too near, or we may 
get stung. Bees in the field and V on the flowers will 
not sting; but if you go near 
their hive they are apt to. 

Yes, indeed; you can 
clearly see the upper part 
where the little honey 
frames are stored. All I 
you have to do is to 
lift that top off and 
take out the frames 
of honey. 

You would n't like to be the 
one to do it, May ? 






Oh, but the beemaster understands just how to man- 
age, and he seldom gets stung. 

His wise little bees learn to know him, too, and allow 
him to do what they would not submit to from a stranger. 

Sometimes he blows a little smoke on the bees from 
a smoker that comes on purpose, and this smoke quiets 
them imtil he can escape with the honey. 

It is great fun to keep bees. 

Mollie wants to know what is in the lower part of 
that hive*. 

Ah, Mollie ! there is something very important down 
there. 

K you could see in, you would find it full of honey- 
comb and bees. Oh, such quantities of bees ! 

And if you were to examine the honeycomb, you 
would find some of it containing honey and some of it 
something else. 

Yes, Ned ; some of it would be found to contain bee- 
bread. But that is not all. Yet other wax cells would 
contain neither beebread nor honey, but something very 
different. 

See how excited Nell is ! 

Yes, my dear ; you have guessed it. Some of the 
waxen cells contain eggs and larvae. 

The queen bee lays an egg in the cell, and soon this 
hatches into a little larva, like the bumblebee larva. 







The Larv^ and Pup^ 

There is just one queen in the hive, and she lays all 
the eggs. 

As soon as the egg hatches the worker bees feed it ; 
for these cells are not packed full of food upon which 
the larva can feed at pleasure. 

No ; each honeybee larva lies in its waxen cradle and 
waits for the good nurse bees to come along and fill its 
little mouth, as the old bird feeds the young ones. 

When the larvae have grown and molted their very 
delicate skins o¡êE; ¡ª so delicate you can hardly see them, 
¡ª and have finished their larval development, then what 
do you suppose happens ? 

Why, the nurse bees cap over the open end of the cell 
with a cover of wax ; and there are those larvae with 
nothing to do but to turn into 
pupae. 

The first thing they do is to 
spin a cap of silk over the door 
end of their prison. 

I don't know why they do 
that, unless it is a " survival," as we say of a habit 
that was once useful to them. 

Of course the bees have progressed very far indeed 
from what they once were. 





Very likely the young bees in bygone ages made a 
cocoon as the bumblebee larvae still do, and maybe they 
have not quite outgrown the habit, although they no 
longer need a cocoon, protected as they are in their 
beautiful wax cradles. 

What, May, ¡ª was there once a time when bees did 
not make honeycomb ? 

I am sure of it. They learned to do it gradually, 
until it finally assumed its present perfect form. 

But to return to those larvae. They soon change, as 
you will have guessed, into pupae, and in the picture of 
magnified brood cells you can see them. 

When their time is up the pupae cut a hole in their 
wax cover with their hard little mandibles, and out they 
come, perfect honeybees. 

Workers and Drones 

You can readily imagine that the greater number of 
the bees that come out are workers. 

All through the early part of the summer the workers 
come forth in great numbers ; thousands upon thousands 
appear, and as soon as they bite free from their prison 
cells they go to work. 

Some do the work of the hive, keeping it clean and 
ventilating it ; others fly forth in search of pollen and 






honey with which to feed the many hungry 
mouths in the hive and fill the 
empty cells. 

Yes; there are a very great many 
cells in a beehive, ¡ª enough to hold 
the brood and the honey, too. 

Yes, Mollie ; the bees use the , 
same cradle cells over and over ^ 
again. 

As soon as a bee comes out the 
careful nurses clean the cell, and the 
queen lays another egg in it. 

Mollie is asking where the drones 
come from. 

Knowing as you do about the bumble- 
bees, I am sure you can guess what kind of 
bees the drones are. 

Yes ; they are the male bees, and like the bumblebee 
drones they come out in the fall of the year. 

But they do not come from common honeycomb cells. 

No, indeed; the workers build larger cells for the 
drones. They are just like honeycomb cells, only larger. 

Of course these large cells are comparatively few in 
number, though there may be hundreds of them. 

The queen lays an egg in each drone cell, but this egg 
of the drone is different from the eggs of the workers. 






It hatches into a larva that grows into a large pupa 
and finally bites its way out, like the worker bees. 
Do you think you could tell a drone bee by sight ? 
Yes, he is larger than the worker. 
Like the bumblebee drone he has long, 
drooping antennae, and his wings are 
larger in proportion to his body than 
the worker's wings. 

He, too, has no sting, no collecting 
baskets on his legs, and his tongue is small and weak. 
No, he has no honey sac. 
He cannot work. 

You have all heard how he is turned out of the hive 
in the fall of the year. 

The poor fellows are driven forth to perish of cold 
and himger, and sometimes the workers even sting 
them to death. 

You see the bees cannot a¡êEord to have idle mouths to 
feed during the long winter, and so the poor drones are 
sacrificed. 

The Queen 

Now about the queen. She is generally the only per- 
fect female in the hive ; for the workers, as you know, 
are imperfect females that do not lay eggs. Well, there 
comes a time when there are several queens, and this is 






generally somewhat late in the season, ¡ª about the time 
the drones appear. 

The history of the queen is very remarkable, as I 
suppose the history of a queen ought to be. 

Her cell is very different from any other fy^'^ 
cell in the hive. ^{ 

See if you can tell which are the queen 
cells in the picture. 

Yes,they are much larger than the honey- 
comb cells, are thimble shaped, and hang 
mouth down. Now the strangest part is to come. 

The queen lays an egg, exactly like a worker's egg, in 
the queen cell. 

When this egg hatches the nurse bees feed it on a 
kind of food they make on purpose. This food is so 
nutritious that the larvae fed on it develop into perfect 
females, larger than the workers and able to lay the 
necessary eggs. 

May says she should think they might feed worker 
larvae on this food and make queens of them. 

So they can. And so they sometimes do, ¡ª that is, if 
the larva is not too old. 

If the queen should die before she had laid eggs in 
the queen cells, the workers would enlarge a worker 
cell and feed the yoimg larva on queen food, and she 
would develop into a queen. 





Yes ; it is very, very wonderful. 

But suppose the queen does not die, and suppose that 
finally there hatches out a young queen. What will 
happen ? 

Both cannot stay in the same hive. There would be 
trouble indeed. So the old queen departs with a few 
thousands of workers. 

Swarming 

This, you know, is what happens when the bees 
swarm. 

Out the bees come and sit around idle on the outside 
of the hive until it is half covered with them. 

Now all is ready and off they go, streaming, circling, 
gathering closer and closer, until there is a solid mass 
of bees with the dethroned queen somewhere in the 
middle. 

How in the world they can fly huddled together 
like that is a mystery. But they can, and they can 
all go for the same point, too, which seems even more 
wonderful. 

The question now is where to go. 

Generally they soon stop somewhere on the branch 
of a tree or on a bush before taking the final journey. 

This is the time the bee keeper appears. He collects 
them in a new hive, which he puts in a comfortable 




place, and generally they stay, though sometimes they 
do not like the new home and soon leave it. 

No; there is not much danger of getting stung by 
swarming bees; they are usually harmless at that time, 
though I should not advise one who did not understand 
bees to interfere with them. 

If the bee man does not take the swarm, what do you 
think becomes of it? 

Yes, John; it escapes to the woods and there in a hol- 
low tree it makes its new home. 

Nellie is asking how it knew where to go. 

Probably the bees send out scouts to find the new hive 
before they swarm, and these scouts direct them. 

Oh, yes, indeed; the bees are wise. In some respects 
they are wiser than we. 

If they find the opening to the new nest too large, or 
if there are holes in the nest, these clever little home 
makers know what to do. 

Away go the workers and collect a quantity of sticky 
varnish from plant buds and other places, and with this 
" propolis," as it is called, they plaster up all the holes. 






Care of the Home 

There are no better housekeepers than the bees. 
They know the value of fresh air, and you can imagine 
there is need of it in such a crowded house with only 
one small entrance. 

So these good bees ventilate their home. Some of 
them stand at the entrance and fan their wings very 
fast indeed, thus changing the air inside. 

Meantime what has been happening in the 
hive that the queen bee and the swarm so 
iniceremoniously left ? 

Well, the young queen flies out of the hive 
and high up in the air, where she mates with a 
drone. Then she comes back to the hive and 
the regular work of life goes on. 

The yoimg queen begins to lay eggs, and soon 
libber own progeny appear in large numbers to 
I \^ swell the size of the family. 
Vi^^ May wants to know about the other young 
)\r queens. 

If there are several queens all in a hive, 
the first queen to hatch out sometimes 
behaves very despotically indeed. 
She goes to the queen cells, pulls off the caps, 
*and stings the helpless occupants to death. 






If two queens hatch out at the same time, there is a 
fight unless the workers prevent it by surroimding the 
queens and keeping them apart. 

Sometimes several swarms will leave a hive in one 
season and each one, of course, will need a queen. In 
such cases the queens are not allowed to kiU each other. 

There are honeybees all over the world, though they 
are not all just like our honeybees. 

Now what do you think? 

Our only native honeybee is our old friend bimible- 
bee. The hive bees were brought to this country from 
Europe by the early settlers. 

No, MoUie; the Indians had no honey excepting what 
they could get from the bimiblebees' nests, until the 
white man brought the hive bees. 

Yes, there are a great many wild swarms now. The 
bees have left the hives of man's providing and gone to 
housekeeping in homes of their own finding. 

They dearly love a hollow tree, and these " bee 
trees," as they are called, are sought for the honey they 
contain.

LiiOKG Bees 

John says he has helped find a bee tree and it is great 
sport. 

You can soon learn to " line " bees, as it is called. 
Yes; when you see honeybees on the flowers catch 
two or three of them in a net. Then feed one of them 
all the honey it wants and let it go. It will rise up in 
-s. the air and make a " bee line " for its home. 

^-.^ Go some distance away and feed and liber- 

"^ ^ ate another bee. It will also make 

" ^ . a " bee line " for home, and 

^ ^ ^ the point at which these 

"^:^ two lines come together 

^ ^^ -^ " " " must be the home of 

^ ^-- - '"¡ö " the bee. See, here is a bee going 

^ straight to the hive. 

Here is another going straight to the same hive. 
By watching what directions the two bees take, one 
can soon learn to find the hive or the tree in which 
they live. 

It is fun to line bees even if you do not want to get 
the honey. 

No; it is not easy to get honey out of a tree. You 
have to chop the tree down, or at least chop a hole in 
it, ¡ª and there are the bees to settle with. 






No, indeed, Ned ; not ( all bees have as fine 
hives provided for them 
as those of our neighbor. 

The old-fashioned liives 
were just box.es from 
which the honey and 
beebread were taken, 
all in the combs 
together, and the 
poor bees were 
smoked to death. 

Now the hives 
are opened, the pure honey taken 
out from the top, and the rest not disturbed. Sometimes 
the bees are quieted with smoke, but not killed. 

In the South the hollow trunks of sweet-gum trees 
are used for beehives ; these are called bee gums. 

They are often very picturesque standing in the 
flower gardens, but they are not so good for the bees as 
the fine modem hives. 







Abtificial Comb 



May wants to know if it is true ihsii people now 
make artificial honeycomb. 

Yes and no, May. Very often the beeswax is melted 
up after the honey has been extracted, and this wax is 
pressed by machinery into sheets covered on both sides 
with hollows the shape of the bottom of a honeycomb. 

These sheets of pressed wax are hung up in the hives, 
and if you will believe it, the bees go to work and pull 
out the edges of the wax and complete the honeycomb! 

You see, this saves a great deal of time for the bees. 

Instead of secreting wax and building the honeycomb 
from the beginning, they can finish up this prepared 
wax and spend their time bringing in honey. 

In this way the bee men succeed in getting the bees 
to make a great deal more honey. 

What, May, ¡ª you should think the supply of wax 
would give out? 

Oh, but they do not make all the honeycomb this 
way! No, indeed; the bees still continue to make a 
great deal themselves. 

Yes, indeed, John ; another advantage in giving the 
bees a sheet of wax to start with, or a little piece of a 
sheet hung in their little frames, is that the bees are 
thus encouraged to build straight combs. In the 





old-fashioned box hives the combs soraetimea 

stand .side way a or even at right angles to 

each other, and it is then impossible to take 

them out unbroken. 

Oh, there is so much that is interesting about bees, 

we could spend the whole summer over them and then 

not know all. 




The Burly Carpenter 




Listen ! What do you 

suppose is in that stick 

John has in his hand ? Such 

a buzzing ! Ah ! he has his finger over 

a round hole on one side of it. What cart it be? 

Put the stick in a glass jar, John, take away your finger, 

and let us see if anything will come out of the hole. 

Ah, see! there comes a little f>^AK 
shining, coal-black head, and now 
out pops, in a state of great ex- 
citement, ¡ª who ? 
Madam Bumble? 

May says it does 
not look quite like Bumble, although it resembles her. 

No ; and the more you look at it, the more you feel 
sure it is not a bumble (^ \ bee.- For one thing, do 
you not remember what |r^^ a long face Bumblebee 
has ? It is just like this, V^f long and narrow. Do 
you not think this long face makes her look rather 
solemn and wise? 


This new bee has a round little face, and its 
black abdomen is hard and shining, with no 
hairs on it. See, the abdomen lacks the black 
and yellow furry coat of our bumblebee. 

How excited it^ is ! 

Yes, John; it is a carpenter bee, and it made the 
round hole in the stick. 

These bees get their name because they work in wood. 

That round, strong head is supplied with very power- 
ful jaws, and with these jaws our little friend bites bits 
out of hard wood. We find these holes in dead branches, 
and often in the beams and boards of houses. 

John has split open the stick with his 
strong knife, and you can see the 
channel the little workman has 
excavated. She will some- 
times make a channel several ^^|^^^^ inches long 
in the hardest of wood. You^^^^ can imagine the 
mischief these bees often do ¡ö in countries where 
they are very abundant. Indeed, I have seen a house in 
the South quite ruined by them. 

May asks why they do it. 

Well, May, the carpenter bee is not like the honeybee 
or the bumblebee in its habits. 

It is not a "social bee"; it does not live in large 
communities in which all help to do the work. 







This bee lives alone and makes its own nest. There 
iire never any workers to help it. So we call it a 
" solitary bee." 

This little bee, with no hive full of workers to depend 
upon, must find a safe nest for her progeny. Now can 
you guess why she makes these channels in the heart 
of the wood ? 

Yes, indeed ; it is in order that she may have a safe 
place to rear her young. 



Her Nest 

Look at the hind leg of Madam Carpenter Bee. 
MoUie says it looks like the little brush with which 
her mother cleans the lamp chimneys. 

That little black brush serves her instead 
of a basket for carrying pollen. 
=^, _ Yes; she manages to attach to her 
leg-brushes good big loads of pollen, mixed 
with honey, and home she goes to deposit it. 
When she has ^placed a lump about the size of a bean 
in the bottom of her tunnel, she lays an egg on it and 
then builds a partition of sawdust and sahva in front 
of it. The sawdust she makes herself, biting the wood. 
Away she goes, faithful little mother, and gathers 
another limip of pollen upon which she also lays an 








egg, and seals up the end "as before. She continues in 
this way until she has her tunnel quite filled with little 
compartments, each containing an egg and pollen enough 
to feed a larva. 

Nell wants to know why she separates the little com- 
partments with partitions of sawdust. 

I suspect it is in order that these voracious larvaB will 
not eat more than their share of the pollen. Each one has 
its own supply and with that it must be satisfied. 

When the eggs have hatched and the 
larvae have eaten all there is to eat, 
then each one 

spins itself 
a little cocoon 
within which it becomes a 
pupa. The egg that was lowest down in the gallery 
was laid first. Now what will happen if it gets ready 
to come out first as a full-grown carpenter bee ? 

How in the world can it get past all those other larvae 
and the partitions ? 

May says that perhaps it bites another hole out 
through the side of the stick. 

But it could not do that in the beam of a house. 

No, Nature has attended to this matter ; and strange 
to say, the last-laid egg is the first to become a perfect 
bee. 








It easily finds its way out through its sawdust parti- 
tion and through the entrance hole. 

Then No. 2 bites through its sawdust partition, 
crawls out through the empty cell of No. 1, and so 
on until all are out. 

There are a great many carpenter bees flying about 
in some parts of the South, and they have a funny way 
of poising in the air and then suddenly darting off with 
tremendous rapidity. 

It is only the female that has brushes 
' on the hind legs. She alone carries pollen. 
Tliere are male carpenters, or drones, but 
no workers. 

The carpenter bees do not live in com- 
munities like the bumblebees ; 
they are solitary in their habits 
and so there is no need of 
workers. 
Sting ? Well, I guess they can sting ! 
But they will not trouble you unless 
you trouble them. Queen bees never 
like to sting, and drones cannot. 






The Masons 

Way down South, where the houses are often made of 
logs chinked with clay, and where they have chimneys 
made of stones and mortar, one often sees the clay and 
mortar riddled with round holes, 
and bees constantly going in 
and out of them. Some- 
times you might imagine 
there was a swarm 
located somewhere in 
the walls of the house the 

bees go in and out in such large numbers. No, they 
do not sting the people who live in the house; they 
attend to their own affairs, flying straight to the holes 
in the walls which they have made themselves. Because 
they work in mortar or in banks of hard earth they are 
called mason bees. 

They are solitary bees that live very much like the 
carpenter bees, and you can imagine that they are a 
nuisance where they exist in large numbers. 



The Miners 

John says we must not sit down on this pleasant bank. 
Oh, yes ! we now see why. 

If we were to sit down here, we should close up the 
front doors to a great many homes. 

See all these little holes in the ground. And see who 
are going in and out of them. 
Yes, May ; the little owners of these 
^ underground nests are bees, but you 
need not run, for they have no desire 
to sting you. 

I do not believe they would sting even if you sat on 
the entrance to their nests, but they would be very much 
troubled, poor little mothers. For that is what they are, 
¡ª little mother bees. They have dug these holes, and 
are now busy storing them with pollen, which they bring 
home from the flowers. 

What, John, ¡ª you do not see any pollen on their 
legs as they go in ? 

That is because they do not carry pollen on their legs. 
They have another method of transporting it. If you 
were to look at the under side of the abdomen, you would 
find it covered with long collecting hairs, and when the 
bee goes into its nest these hairs are covered thick with 
pollen. 





No; you cannot see the pollen load on these busy 
miners unless you catch them. See how quickly they 
pop into their holes. 

See ! there goes one. 

No, indeed; they are not ^^ social" bees, although 
they like to build their nests so close together. Each 
bee has its own nest and no other bee helps to make it. 

These pretty bees dig a hole in the ground by taking 
out the earth, bit by bit, in their jaws. They do not 
make a single tube like our carpenter, but when they 
have sunk their main shaft they form side passages, 
each of which ends in a pocket. In these little 
pockets the mother bee places the pollen and 
lays an egg on each mass of it. 

Some of these little bees have long tongues 
like the honeybees and some have short tongues, 
but as they do not collect honey to store up, the 
length of the tongue is not of much consequence, 
as long as they are able to get enough to eat. 

May says she should think the ants and other 
insects would crawl down and get the pollen and 
eat the larvse of the miner bees. 

No, May; our bee is too careful a mother for that. As 
soon as she has stocked her pockets with pollen and laid 
her eggs, she fills in the opening to the gallery with dirt 
through which the young bees have to dig their way out. 



^^t' 








Rose-Leaf Blankets 

Perhaps the cunningest of these bee 

, homes is made by a little bee that bores 

into the stems of shrubs and wraps 

its masses of pollen in pieces cut 

from rose leaves. 

There is a rosebush over there on which 

these little ones have been at work. 

Let us see who will be the first to find 
a leaf cut by the bees. 
Ah! here comes Nell, the first to find the leaf. You 
did well, Nell; there are four of these leaflets from which 
our pretty bee has cut her nursery blankets. 
And now you shall see the nursery itself. 
Are they not dainty cradles? You can 
plainly see the rose leaves wrapped about the 
pollen. 

There is a bee even daintier than this one, 
for she takes flower petals in which to wrap 
her pollen. 

You will certainly be able to find the solitary bees 
if you look, and it is well worth while to watch their 
cunning ways. 

There are a great many kinds of solitary bees in the 
world. 








Lady Vespa 

John says he has found a 
paper house so small that we 
could carry it in one hand and 
yet not one of us would dare 
touch it* 

We can guess whose house it 
is. It is the home of Madam 
Wasp that you have found. 

Ned says that it isn't a 
wasps' nest but a hornets' nest 
that John means. 

But, Ned, a hornet is only one kind of wasp. 

You remember there are several kinds of bees. Well, 
there are also several kinds of wasps. 

Like the bees, the wasps are social or solitary. 

Hornets and yellow jackets are social wasps. They 
always live in communities. 

May wants to know if the wasps are not very much 
like the bees, for she has been looking at some of the 


hornets that John caught and has with him in a box 
with a net over the top. 

Yes, indeed, May; they belong to the same order. 
Who can remember its name? 

Nell is the first to say it. Yes, it is the Hymenoptera. 

We find the wings and the sting of the wasp like the 
wings and sting of the bee, differing very slightly in 
unimportant details. There is one thing about the 
wings though that we will be sure to notice; that is, 
they look so narrow when folded. 

This is not because they are narrow, but because they 
are folded lengthwise, like a fan, when not in use. 

els to legs, we will look in vain for pollen baskets 
^ on the hind legs of the wasps. The wasps do 

j I not live on pollen, so of course they do not need 
V baskets in which to carry it. 

Yes, John; they do eat honey, but they are not 
wholly dependent upon it, and their tongues are 
short and flat, so we never see them on those flowers 
that have long tubes. 

Our big black and white hornet is the largest of our 
social wasps, and quite a formidable antagonist it is with 
its large, strong sting. 

The yellow jackets are like the hornets excepting that 
their bodies are black and yellow instead of black and 
white, and they do not grow quite so large. 




Yes, May; the hornets and some of the yellow jackets 
build their nests out of doors, often hanging them to 
the tree limbs or under the eaves of houses; but some 
species of yellow jackets, like the bumblebees, build 
their nests underground. 




Paper Houses 

The nest, as you see, is not made of wax. 
Yes, MoUie; it is made of gray paper. 
Nell wants to know if they sweat out the paper, as 
the bees sweat out the wax. 





No, Nell, they do not. They make the paper in quite 
another way. 

The wasps were the very first paper makers in the 
world, and man has just learned to make his paper out 
of the materials the wasps use. 

Who knows what is used to-day for making the paper 
our newspapers are printed on? 

Yes; such paper is made from wood pulp, ¡ª wood 
ground up and mixed with certain substances and 
pressed into paper. 

My dears, that is just what the wasps did thousands 
of years ago. They bit out the pieces from dead wood 
and chewed it with their sticky saliva until it could be 
spread out and would harden. 

You can see the wasps in the summer time biting 
out bits of wood and then flying home with them rolled 
into a ball which they carry under their necks. This 
little lump of wood pulp they spread out into paper 
which quickly dries and hardens. 

John wants to know when the hornets make their 
nests. 

The nest is started in the early spring by one hornet. 

Yes, May; this is the queen hornet that has been 
hiding away somewhere over winter. 

In this respect the wasps' nest is like the bumble- 
bees'. 






"¡ö"y^ The large queen wasp collects wood pulp 

^ ""^ ' and makes with it a little group of four or 
five cells shaped like honeycomb 
cells. These she speedily covers 
with a dome of paper. And there the little 
home hangs, for all the world like a paper 
bell with a group of cells for a clapper. 

Young Wasps 

You can guess what Madam Vespa puts into those 
paper cells. 

No, indeed ; she does not fill them with food first and 
then lay an egg in the food, as the solitary bees do ; she 
behaves like the honeybees in the way she lays her eggs 
and cares for her young. 

In each empty cell she lays an egg, and when the eggs 
hatch good Mother Vespa has all the little larvaB to feed. 

What food do you suppose she carries home to these 
ravenous youngsters? The country butcher will tell you 
that the wasps steal his meat. Indeed, they do. They 
bite out bits of meat and fly home with them and put 
them into the hungry little mouths. They also like 
fruit and sugar, and they chew up insects to 
feed the young. Yes, they are omnivorous, 
which means they eat both animal and vegetable food 






Yes, May; young wasps are as hard to bring up as 
young birds. 

They have to be fed one by one by the mother wasp, 
and they have to be kept warm. 

But it does not take them many days to grow, and 
then you know what happens. 

Yes, May ; they change into pupaB. Just before this 
happens they spin their cocoon and shut themselves 
into their gray paper cradles by a pretty white cap of 
silk over the open end. 

Mollie says she should think they would fall out of 
the cells that hang mouth down. 

Sometimes they do, but they have a way of clinging 
fast, so that this fatal accident does not often happen. 
Yes, John ; if they fall out they perish, 
as the mother wasp is not able to put them 
back again. 
Well, after a few more days you know what 
happens next. These youngsters, changed into perfect 
wasps, bite open the silken cap they put on their cells, 
and out they come. 

Yes, Mollie; you are right. Out of these first cells 
come worker wasps, and when there are enough workers 
to attend to everything the queen no longer goes abroad. 
She stays at home and lays the eggs, and the workers 
enlarge the nest and feed the young. 





the social wasps ^5 

Enlarging the Nest 

John says he does n't see how it 
is possible to enlarge the nest after 
the outer cover has been put on. 

The wasps have solved this prob- 
lem, though not in a very eco- 
nomical manner. 

Outside the first cover, and a 
little space from it, they build 
another. Then they bite away the inside one. . 

Yes, May ; it is like building a house and finding it 
too small, and adding to it by building walls and a 
roof about it, and then knocking out the inside walls 
and roof. 

Nell says she should think their house would be in 
confusion all the time. 

Not so much so as our houses would be, if built by 
their plan. For paper is easy to work with, and the 
wasps are very quick and very neat, carrying out every 
little scrap and dropping it on the ground. 
Here is a picture of half a nest about 
I K^^'^k ^1^^^^ ^^^ walls have been built. 
V\'m^^ Rapidly the nest grows, and the 
outer wall is kept quite thick and 
made of many layers to protect 






the treasures within from wet weather and also from 
sudden changes of temperature. 

When the paper comb is as large around as the 
largest nest could hold, it still contains too few cells to 
accommodate the rapidly increasing family. 

If you examine a nest, you will quickly 
how this difficulty is overcome. 
\s the nest increases in diameter 
it also increases in length, 
and below the first round 
paper comb is suspended 
another, and then another 
and another. 

So the work goes on, the 

inner walls being constantly 

torn down, the outer ones 

made, and new combs added 

until the nest reaches the for- 

idable proportions it sometimes 

les. 

You can imagine that the wasps are very 
easily excited when any one comes near their fragile 
tenement; and as they have strong and effective 
weapons always at hand, they are ready at a moment's 
notice to sting you whenever they can find an un- 
protected spot. 





Yes, indeed ; they, too, have a poison sac attached to 
their sting. As a rule wasps will not sting unless mo- 
lested, and like the bees they learn to know their friends. 

Indeed, wasps have been tamed so that their owner 
could handle their nest, and cut it open and look into 
it when he pleased without any danger of being stung. 

But I do not advise anybody to try this. 

Queens, Workeks, and Drones 

Thus far our nest has a queen and many workers. 
Who can guess what happens next ? 

Yes, John ; towards the end of the summer the wasps 
build some large cells around the outer edge of the 
combs, and they often make the lowest comb entirely 
of these large cells. 

Of course you all know what come out of them. 

Yes ; out of some come large drones, 
and out of others come young queens. ^--^ 

There are no bitter feelings between 
the queens of a wasps' nest. They all live happily 
together imtil cold weather comes, when all leave the 
nests, the queens to hide away until the following 
spring, the drones and workers to perish. 

Yes ; it is safe to take a hornets' nest into the house 
after cold weather has come. 





Some say they have found live wasps in the nest then, 
but it is not usually the case. 

Probably the nests are too fragile to bear the winter 
storms, and the queens prefer a safer hiding place. 

Yes, Ned; the wasp drones are stingless, and there- 
fore harmless. You can recognize them, as you can the 
drones of the bees, by their long-drooping 
antennae, their large size, big wings, 
and square bodies. 

Ned says he thinks the wasps are 
as interesting as the bees. 

May says they are not so pretty 
and they do not give us honey. 
But surely they are interesting 
enough. 
And do not forget that they were the 
very first paper makers. 




Lady Polistes 

Ned says he has found a 
nest just started. It has r 
outer cover, and is hang- 
ing to a twig on that bush over 
there. Let us go and see. 

Ah, Ned! this is not our friend Vespa. The wasp 
that made this nest has a long, slender, brown body 






with a yellow line around it. See ! there she comes, a 
dainty little lady who does not look at all fierce. 

No, this is not a hornet nor a yellow jacket. 

It is our little friend Polistes, and she does not put 
an outer covering about her home. 

It is a very small and fragile affair, you see, when 
compared to the stately abode of Vespa. 

But Polistes manages to make it answer her purpose. 

She is a pretty little wasp and very easily tamed. 

You could go at night and cut off the twig with her 
house on it and put it in a box and take it home, and 
Polistes would soon become very friendly. 

Yes, indeed; the little nest, as you can see, is made 
of paper, and this Polistes collects as Vespa does. 

The story of her home is about the same as that of 
Vespa' s, and the drones, which come out in the fall, have 
white faces. You often see them sitting on rocks sun- 
ning themselves. 

Polistes sometimes comes into the house and often 
builds her nest under the roof of a shed ; indeed, 
we seldom find her in an unprotected place like 
this bush. Sometimes there will be a great many i 
of these little nests close together. 

You need have no fear of Polistes, for 
unless you actually take hold of her or touch 
her nest she will not sting you. 











. Yes, indeed; her wings lock together like the wings 
~**"^ of the bees and like those of Vespa, and 

when not flying she folds them together 
lengthwise like a fan, thus making them 
look very long and narrow. 
There are a good many species of these 
little paper-comb makers in the world, and 
they are always pretty and gentle and interesting to 
watch. It is surprising how many cunning things they 
do. Watch them when you get a chance and see if 
they are not wise and clever little housekeepers. 







Little Friend Mud Dauber 

What do you think? Ned says he 
has caught Polistes making her nest 
of mud. 

We must attend to that, Ned. 
Let us go to the shed where Ned 
saw this strange sight. 

Ah! there is the nest, but where, 
oh where, is Polistes? 

Here comes the owner of those 
mud caves. But do you call this wasp 
Polistes? Look at the long-waisted, yellow-legged 

dame! Surely that is not our 
little brown Polistes. 
No, Ned, this is not 

Polistes. It is not a social 

"^ wasp at all ; it does not live in communities 
of queens, workers, and drones. 

This is a solitary wasp. It lives alone and builds its 
nest aU by itself. 


This is the mud dauber. 
You can easily guess why it has this name. 
Yes, it makes its nest of mud. 
Let us watch this one and see how she does it. 
See, she has flown away, but not far. She is 
resting by the wet place near the bam pimip. 
And see! she is digging out mud and rolling 
^ it into a ball. 

Yes, Nell; she seems to be standing on her head in 
her eagerness. 

Now she is flying back to the shed with a little ball 
of mud held close imder her head. 

We will go, too, and see what she does with it. 
There, she is spreading it out over that unfinished 
cell, ¡ª and what a loud buzzing she keeps up! 

Yes, May ; it is as though she were singing at her work. 
Some of the cells you see are entirely closed up. 
What do you suppose is in them? 

John says he knows; he broke one open the other day 
and it was full of spiders. 

MoUie wants to know what spiders were doing in a 
wasps' nest. 

If we were to wait and watch our little mud dauber 
long enough, we should easily find out. 

When her mud cell is finished, all but closing up one 
end, she goes hunting. 





She does not provision her children's larder with pol- 
len and honey, but with fresh insects or spiders that she 
stings for the purpose. 

No; she does not sting her victims to death. She 
merely paralyzes them so that they remain quiet. 

On the body of one of them she lays an egg. When 
the cell is full of insects or spiders, she seals up the 
end and leaves her offspring to its fate. 

You can imagine what now happens. 

The egg hatches and the wasp larva at 
once begins the consumption of the spiders, 
or whatever the careful mother has provided. 
You see the creatures being alive remain fresh, 
so that the larva has fresh food all the time. 

By the time it has eaten up everything in 
the cell it has grown and molted until it is I 
ready to become a pupa. 

This it does, sometimes remaining in the pupa 
state all winter and coming out in the spring. 

Do you remember what we said awhile ago about the 
sting of the bee having been originally used for some 
other pm-pose than defense ? 

Yes, John says he guesses now what that sting means. 
It was first used as a hunter uses his spear, ¡ª to secure 
prey for food. It is believed that long ago the bee also 
used its sting to secure its prey, and that in course of 








time it learned to live on pollen and honey, preserv- 
ing the sting as a weapon of defense. 

No ; there are no workers among the mud daubers, 
¡ª only queens and drones. 

It is great fim to watch these little masons at 
work, and they are so gentle that one can 
stand quite close to them without any 
danger of being stung. 

Yes, May; their wings are narrow, but 
they do not fold them fanlike; only the 
social wasps fold the wings that way. 

Yes, the wasps are flesh eaters as a 
rule. They like insects or meat, although 
they also eat honey and are fond of fruit 
juices and all sweet things ; but they feed 
their young mostly on animal food. The 
solitary wasps, that shut their infants up in 
a roomful of food and let them help them- 
selves, always provide animal food, ¡ª 
never pollen, so far as I know. 

Yes; there are many species of the mud 
^^^^n^ daubers, and a very common one is bright 
blue in color. 

Yes ; I am sure you have all seen this 

beautiful, shining, blue wasp. And most of us 

have seen a pretty black mud dauber that builds a long 







tunnel of mud and divides it into cells, as the wood 
borers divide their tunnels. 

If you take a mud dauber's nest into the house in the 
fall, the wasps will come out quite early in the spring; 
and if you touch them gently with your finger and feed 
them honey or candy as 
soon as they bite the cap 
off, before they are even out of 
the cells, they will become perfectly tame, and 
will not sting you unless you hurt them. 

The Diggers and Miners 

May wants us to come and see a wasp dig a hole in 
the ground. 

See ! she digs with her fore feet like a dog and kicks 
the dirt out behind her. She has nearly disappeared. 
What do you think she will do when she gets 
her hole completed ? 

Yes, she will provision it. She will go 
on many a hunting expedition for 
caterpillars or other insects 

pleasing to her taste, and vihen^^^^^^^ii^^^y.^^^ 
she has gathered her store of food, '^^^ "^, 

andr tucked it away in the bottom of her hole, she will 
lay an egg on it and then close up the hole. 








The digger wasps are very, very interesting, 
and often they are very large and handsome. 

You must watch them and find out for your- 
selves the clever things they do. 

Yes f there are wasps that bore into wood to 
make their nests. 

Sometimes you will find a dried elder twig 
full of little cells placed end to end, as the f. 
carpenter bee places its cells, but these little ones belong 
not to Madam Carpenter but to a little miner wasp. 

There are a great many wasps in this country, and 
they are well worth watching. 

One handsome fellow that we occasionally see is by 
most people believed to be an ant. It is called the velvet 
ant because of the velvety fur that clothes its body. 

What, May, ¡ª you have seen it ? It is bright red and 
runs very fast ? 

Yes; that is the velvet ant, and it is the female 
which we see running so swiftly along the ground. 
She has no wings. 

What, May, ¡ª you never succeeded in catching her ? 
Tt 19 fortunate for you that you did not. 
My dears, if you catch this brilliant wasp 
in your fingers, you will be sorry 
for a long time after, for she 




J?^ 



has a most formidable sting. 




Running here, running there, running every- 
where, are the ants. 

We cannot walk in the country in the 
summer time without seeing them. 

Yes, John; they have been studied a 
great deal, and yet we do not know so 
very much about them. You see, they 
have their nests underground, so that 
it is usually rather hard to 
study them. 

The ants 
belong to 
bees, ¡ª to 

May is 
that when 

But 
We have 





the same family as the 
the Hymenoptera. 
wondering how we know 
they have no wings, 
they do have wings. May. 
often seen winged ants 
\ flying about in vast 
numbers in the summer. 
Yes, MoUie; they appear 
suddenly some day and cover 
everything ; then they as suddenly disappear. 


Now where do you suppose these flying 
"^ants come from? 

Yes, out of the nests. 
Down underground in the ants' nests 
these winged members of the family appear 
among coimtless numbers that have no wings. 
The ants that never have wings are the workers. 
Yes, May; like the bee and wasp workers, the ant 
workers are imperfect females. 

Now you can guess what the winged ants are. 
Yes ; they are the males and females, the fathers and 
mothers of the community. 

There are a great many species of ants, more than we 
could study in a whole summer, or in a dozen summers. 
Some of them live in the ground, making burrows in 
which the eggs are laid and the young reared. 

The Larv^ and Pup^ 

The ants take very good care of their young. As soon 
as the eggs hatch the busy workers feed the helpless 
larvae. These larvae look very much like bee larvae. 

Yes, they are little white grubs without legs or 
wings. When they are ready to pupate, which means, 
you know, to become pupae, many species spin for 
themselves a neat little cocoon. 







When an ant nest is broken into, the ants hastily 
catch up these cocoons and attempt to escape with them. 

Many people think these cocoons are the ants' eggs, 
but the eggs are so tiny that they are seen only by 
those who look very carefully for them. 

No, indeed, MoUie ; they are not as large as the head 
of a pin. 

Some ants' nests have winding galleries where the 
nurseries are located and where food is stored, for the 
ants, like the bees, live through the winter. 



The Queen 

Now about the winged ants. 

They fly out at certain times, many 
colonies together, and mate, after 
which the male ants, like the drones, 
die, and the females return to the 
nests. 

When the female goes back 
into the nest her flying days are over. She 
has no further use for her wings, so what do you think 
she does ? She pulls them off and leaves them outside. 

The female is very much larger than the workers, and 
in this way you can always recognize her. She lays 
the eggs for the whole colony, and unlike the queen 







bee, she does not hate the other queens ; so that 
several are sometimes found livmg happily together 
in the same nest. 

Sometimes a number of workers will take a young 
queen and start a new nest. With some species the 
young queen starts her own nest without any help, the 
first workers that hatch out quickly relieving her of all 
responsibility. 

The Ants' Cows 

Yes, the ants do many remarkable things. You have 
all heard about their fondness for the aphides, or plant 
lice, which are sometimes called the ants' cows. 

Ants are fond of sweets, and so they befriend the 
aphides for the honeydew which they afford. 

Wherever there are aphides on the plants one is 
pretty sure to find ants, and the ants may be seen 
caressing the aphides with their antennae in order, so 
it is said, to coax them to give forth the honeydew. 

Some species of ants take care of the aphides, driv- 
ing off their enemies and even carrying them to new 
feeding places when the old ones are exhausted, just 
as a herdsman takes his cattle to new pastures when 
the old fail. 

. When winter approaches, these wise ants carry the 
aphid eggs into their o\vn warm nests and take care of 







them until they hatch the following spring, when the ants 

carry the young aphides out and put them on the leaves. 

Yes, May ; all this is truly very wonderful. The ants 

do so many wise things that they fill us with amazement. 





In some species there are different kinds of 
workers, ¡ª small ones for general work and 
large ones with enormous heads that are called |> 
soldier ants, and that are believed to fight ^~" 
for the colony and to protect it. 

Yes, it is quite true. May, that some ants 
keep slaves. There is a long, reddish-brown 
or yellowish ant that does this, and the ants 
captured are black. 

Out sallies the marauding army until the 
nest of the poor black ants has been ap- 
proached, when forth rush the blacks, and 
there is a terrific combat in which the 
ants tear off each other's legs and even 
heads, which they leave strewn on the 
field of battle. Their weapons are not 
guns and swords, but their powerful jawa, 

If the attacking army conquers, it enters the 
nest of the defeated army and triumphantly carries 






off all the pupaB and larvaB it finds there. These are 
taken home and carefully raised, for they are destined 
to do the whole work of the colony for their masters. 

The young slave ants, thus brought up in a strange 
nest, do not leave it, but become very warmly attached 
to their masters, for whom they wilHngly labor. 

Some species of ants have depended so long and so 
entirely upon the services of their slaves that they have 
lost the power even of feeding themselves, and starve to 
death, with food within reach, unless a slave is at hand 
to put it in their mouths. 

They have retained only one power, and that is to 

fight and 
^g^=^ capture 
slaves. 

Wars and Other Occupations 

Oh, yes ; ants are great fighters, and two colonies will 
often go to war where there are no slaves involved. 

These ant wars are sometimes very formidable affairs, 
lasting many hours, or even two or three days, and 
involving thousands upon thousands of slain and 
wounded. 

Yes, John ; it is true that some species of ants in hot 
countries plant and raise their own grain, and some 







have gardens in their underground nests in which they 
grow a sort of plant that serves them as food. 

Some build tunnels or passages from their nests 
to their himting or collecting grounds, so they 
can run safely back and forth with no danger 
of being molested by enemies. 

Some go in armies after provisions and ran- 
sack the people's houses from top to bottom, 
leaving nothing behind that they can carry 
off, ¡ª that is, nothing good to eat. When 
the people see an army of ants coming, they 
catch up the baby, cover tightly or take 
away what food they wish to keep, and 
leave the ants to " clean house," which they 
very thoroughly do, killing and carrying 
away all the cockroaches and other trouble- 
some insects that may have taken up their 
abode there. 

Nell says she has heard that some ants 
carry parasols. 

Well, you can call them parasols if you 
like. There are certain Mexican ants that 
go up certain trees and bite off the leaves, which their 
comrades down below collect and carry home over 
their heads, reminding one of a procession with raised 
umbrellas. They store the leaves in their nests. 






Yes, the legs of the ants are like those of the bees 
and wasps. They have the antenna cleaners, like the 
bees and wasps, but of course they have no baskets or 
pollen brushes on their legs, for they have no use for 

such implements. 

They eat a great many things 
-and use both animal and vege- 
table food, which they carry 
^"^ home in their jaws. They 
have a way of telling each other when they find a piece 
of food too heavy for one ant to lift. Who has not 
seen several of these wise little sisters tugging away at 
one load, which together they pull into the nest ? 

They have remarkable brains, though it is impossible 
for us to know just how muqh thinking they do. 

Their antennae are very sensitive, and they know each 
other and seem affectionate. 

Bees and wasps recognize members from the same 
hive and fight strangers ; but the bees and wasps do not 
caress each other as the ants do, and if a bee or a w.asp 
gets hurt its friends do not try to help it. 

But the ants ! how tenderly they clean off an unfor- 
tunate comrade and care for it ! 

When they meet they touch each other with their 
antennae, and in this way seem to convey messages. 
Yes ; they send out scouts when they are ready to go 





on a slave-hunting expedition or on a y marauding ex- 
pedition for food J so when the ^^..^¡ªtime comes all 
is ready, and / ^^.^^^^^^ ^^^ army pours 

forth, going / Jli:^^^ straight to the right 

place with J^r out losing time or wandering aim- 
lessly about. 
Ants behave in very curious ways, and 
do many things that we cannot under- 
stand; it has even been supposed that they 
play games and dance about to express their 
happiness. . 
They often use dead insects as food, and if an 
unfortunate ant from another colony gets into 
the wrong nest it may be attacked, slain, and 
stored away for future consumption. 

But if one of their own number dies, you will 
see no such conduct. The dead comrade will be 
carried respectfully out, the bearer sometimes ac- 
companied by other ants, and laid down a long 
distance from the nest. They never eat the mem- 
bers of their own colony. 

Yes, indeed ; the ants are probably the wisest 
and most remarkable of all the insects. There 
are a great many species, and probably there 
are more ants creeping about the earth than any 
other kind of insect. 






No, not all ants live in the ground ; some live under 
the bark of trees, and some in dead wood or in the 
walls of houses. 

They are all sizes, ¡ª from the tiny little yellow ants 
so small that we can hardly see them, to the enormous 
black or red-and-black ants that sometimes get into 
our pantries. They are a very great nuisance to us, but 
there are so many of them and they are so well pro- 
tected in their homes undergroimd that it is impossible 
to exterminate them. 

In warm countries the ants sometimes make the life 
of man a burden, or even drive him away altogether. 



Mound Builders 

Yes, Ned ; some ants build large mounds 

with galleries running all through 

them, ¡ª very wonderful 

structures indeed, 

and very terrible 

for anybody to sit 

upon. For the 

ants can bite 

quite severely 

with their little 

jaws, and, like 





the bees and wasps, some of them have stings. Indeed, 
people have lost their lives from accidentally stumbling 
into one of these great ant-hills and being instantly 
covered with the angry insects. 

There are some very curious ants, in Mexico I think, 
that build mounds. Certain of the workers are modified 
to form, ¡ª guess what ? 

No, not soldiers with enormous heads. You could 
never, never guess. They are modified to form honey jars. 

The other workers gather a sort of honey and feed 
these accommodating bottles that cling fast to the roof 
and store away the honey until the abdomen becomes 
little more than a skinful of it, and as large as a currant. 
Later, when the honey season is over, the living bottles 
give up their contents to their comrades. 

John says he has heard that the people sometimes 
gather these honey ants and have them for dessert, 
eating them as we do ripe grapes. 

There, there. May ; you know you are not obliged to 
eat any of them. 

White Ants 

Ned wants to know if white ants are the same as the 
other ants. 

No, indeed, Ned ; the white ants, or termites, as they 
are sometimes called, are not ants at all. 







They belong to quite a different family, one more 
nearly related to the dragon flies than to the ants. 

Sometimes in the woods we find imder a stone a col- 
lection of grayish white little creatures that remind us 
a little of ants, though if we look at them carefully we 
will instantly see they are not. They are the termites, 
and they have the name " white ants " because their 
habits are so similar to those of the true ants. 

They have winged males and females and wingless 
workers, and live in communities and often do much 
damage. We are not much troubled by them in the 






North, but in tropical countries they are a terrible pest, 
destrojdng the walls and beams of houses, and, in fact, 
anjrthing made of wood, into which they bore, eating 
out everything but an outer shell. 






John says he has brought us some apples, but he fears 
^(, we will not enjoy their flavor. 

See ! the rogue has some oak apples, 
/or oak balls, or galls; you can take 
your choice of names. 

No, indeed ; we shall not care to 
eat them. They are not apples at 
all, ¡ª just little cradles. 

This is how it happened. A cer- 
tain insect laid an egg on the oak 
the egg hatched the little white, leg- 
to eat, and as soon as it began to 
eat, the skin of the leaf began to change and grow 
into this strange form. 

If we open one of these galls, we shall find a hard 
kernel at the center and the space between filled with 
a spongy material. If we crack the hard kernel, we 
shall find at its center either a fat little larva or a 
hard, brown, round, little pupa. 

The maker of these strange growths on the oak trees 
is a little insect that looks somewhat like a fly, but is 

260 




leaf, and when 
less larva began 





really closely related to the bees, wasps, and ants, ¡ª like 
them, belonging to the Hymenoptera. It is called the 
gallfly. There are a number of these gallflies that 
produce different kinds of galls. 

The galls on certain oaks that grow in Asia are quite 
useful, being frequently employed in the manufacture 
of ink. 

Oh, yes ; there are a great many kinds of galls on 
different plants, and a good many of them are caused 
by gallflies, though there are many kinds caused by 
other insects. 

No; the gallfly does not look much like a bee or 
a wasp, but if you were to examine it carefully you 
would discover that it really is very similar to them 
in structure. 

The truth is, the gallfly is one of those common 
insects that we know very well by sight, but concerning 
whose real nature we are usually quite ignorant. 

I quite agree with John, who thinks that the very 
best thing we get from studjdng the insects is the 
knowledge that they are really like all other animals. 

Yes, they differ in details, but all living things are 
essentially alike, ¡ª all need air and food, and all are 
able to employ their powers in like manner. 







My ! What is that ? 
I don't wonder you ask. 

Of all the insects we have seen, none equals this 
with its long streamers. 

That, my dears, is an ichneumon fly. 
Oh, no, it is not a fly at all; it belongs 
to the ^^ Hjonenoptera. 

What do^. you suppose those long streamers are 
for ? It is V^ hard to believe, but they are the ovi- 
positor ; and ^ slender as they are, the sharp point 
at the tip of one ^ of them can bore into the hardest 
wood. When egg- \\ laying time arrives Madam 
Ichneumon searches \\ about on a tree trunk until 
she thinks she has\\ located the burrow where in 



the wood of the tree 
tail, which is another 
There Madam Ichneu 
parts of the long oviposi 
her body, braces her long 
ceeds to bore a hole into the 
the burrow of the homtail 




lives the larva of a hom- 
of the Hymenoptera. 
mon shuts together the 
tor, curves it up over 
legs firmly, and pro- 
tree, as far as 
When she 





has bored into the burrow she deposits an egg there, and 

when the larva hatches it creeps about until it has found 

the homtail larva, when it proceeds to suck the blood 

of its hapless victim. When the ichneumon larva 

has reached its full size it transforms into a pupa^ 

and emerging, still within 

the. tree, it finds its way out 

through any convenient hole^ 

or if there is none, it bites its 

way through to the outside 

world. 

Only the females have these 
long streamers, and sometimes the 
long ovipositor is the cause of Madam Ichneumon's 
death, for it gets so tightly wedged into the tree trunk 
that she cannot pull it out again. 

Yes, indeed, John; the larva of the ichneumon is a 
parasite. It is parasitic on the larvae of another insect. 
These parasites are very valuable, killing as they do the 
tree borers. 

There are a great many ichneumons, though most of 
them are small in size, and the parasitic habits of the 
larvae make them the friend of man. 

Some ichneumons lay their eggs on caterpillars or 
other insects injurious to fruit or grain, and the larvae 
live inside their insect host. 






The host, May, is the insect that entertains the para- 
site, although very much against its will. 

The host caterpillar in some cases spins its cocoon and 
then dies, and the parasite makes its cocoon within the 
cocoon of its host. 

Again, certain ichneumon larvae live in the caterpillar 
until they have attained their growth, when they come 

out and spin their little silken 
^^f)f)/ii\{)i\. y cocoons on the back of the cater- 






pillar, which now soon perishes, 
having been literally devoured 
by its iminvited guests. 

We sometimes see these poor caterpillars walking 
about covered with cocoons. 

Even the aphides have their ichneumons, and tiny 
things they are, as you can imagine. 

Bees and wasps and indeed many kinds of insects 
are the victims of the many species of ichneumons that 
abound in the world. Some of these ichneumons are 
brilliant in coloring, and when you see a glittering, 
green fly, with long antennae that constantly vibrate, 
hunting along the path or on the side of a house, you 
may be pretty sure it is an ichneumon looking for a 
wasp in whose nest it can lay its egg. 



John has brought us a homtail, and he wonders if it 
is the one that burrows in trees and into whose burrow 
the big ichneumon lays its eggs. 

Yes, John, it is the very same. You see the long, 
hard horn at the end of the abdomen. Well, that is the 
boring instrument, and a powerful one it is for its size. 

Yes; like the ovipositor of the ichneumon, that of 
the horntail sometimes gets wedged in so tightly that 
it cannot be pulled out. 

The larvae of the homtails bore channels through the 
solid wood and are very destructive to trees. 

Yes, indeed ; the Hymenoptera is a large order, and its 
members present very different appearances and have 
very different habits. 

Yes, May ; the ovipositor is a curiously modified organ 
in the Hymenoptera. 

In the bees, wasps, and some ants it is a sting ; in the 
ichneumons it is a boring instrument for drilling holes 
in wood or piercing the bodies of insects. There is 
another family of Hymenoptera that have the oviposi- 
tor modified to form a saw, by means of which it saws 
little slits, for depositing eggs, in leaves or twigs. 




These are the sawflies, and 



great nuisances they are. If J j /Jjf^ 

Here is an enlarged picture y^ 
of the saw of one of them. 

There are two saws placed side by side, and these 
can be moved up and down. 

Yes, John ; it is only the female that has the saws, 
and so it is the mother of the family who wields this 
potent implement. 

The larva of some of the sawflies look like cater- 
pillars, only they have from twelve to sixteen prolegs, 
while true caterpillars, as you know, do not have more 
than ten, with the exception of the Flannel moths. 
Who remembers how many legs the caterpillars of 
the Flannel njoths have ? 
Yes, May; they have the large number of 
fourteen. 

You can recognize the caterpillarlike larvae 
' of the sawflies generally by their queer habit 
of turning the abdomen sideways. 






Yes, we have had a full summer and have become 
acquainted with a good many interesting insect folk. 
We have by no means become acquainted with all, nor 
do we know everything about those we have watched. 

But we have seen and learned enough to enable us to 
understand something of what we see going on about 
us in the insect world, and enough to make us interested 
in what we may afterwards read about the insect folk. 

The books and magazines will keep informing us, and, 
best of all, let us keep ^\ on looking for ourselves. 

After all. that m ^ );/ / the best way tu learn. 









PREFATORY NOTE 


In these days many strange, true stories 
about animals are being written and read, 
but it seems to me that some of our most 
intimate and interesting animal compan- 
ions are being overlooked. So I have 
tried to write about a few of them. These 
stories are true. I know this, for Mary 
and I have really seen almost every- 
thing I have told; and they seem to 
us strange. If there have slipped into 
the stories occasional slight attempts to 
show some reason for the strange things 
or to point an unobtrusive moral, it is 
because the teacher¡¯s habit has over- 
come the story-teller¡¯s intention. So the 
slips may be pardoned. 

Of course I recognize that it is taking 
great chances nowadays with one¡¯s repu- 




tation for honesty and truth-telling to 
write or tell stories about animal behav- 
ior. Nature writers seem to be held, as 
a class, not to be above suspicion. But 
is a truthful man to be kept silent by 
criticism or abuse, or, on the other hand, 
is he to surrender, even for cash, to bad 
examples? I call out, ¡°No!¡± and beat 
on the table as I say this until the pens 
and paper hop, and Mary asks, ¡°No 
what?¡± Which reminds me that I must 
make some exception to my sweeping 
declaration of the truth of the whole of 
this little book. I am not responsible 
for Mary! She is, bless her, a child of 
dreams, and sometimes her dreams get 
into her talk. So some of Mary in this

I FIRST got acquainted with Mary when 
she was collecting tarantula holes. This 
appealed to me strongly. It was so much 
more interesting than collecting postmarks 
or even postage-stamps. 

It is part of my work, the part which is 
really my play ¡ª to go out and look at 
things. To do the same, I found out, is 
Mary¡¯s play ¡ª which is, of course, her most 
serious employment. We easily got ac- 
quainted when we first met, and made an 
arrangement to go out and look at things, 
and collect some of them, together. So 
after Mary had shown me that collecting 
tarantula holes is really quite simple ¡ª al- 
though at first thought of ic you may not 
think so ¡ª I proposed to her to come along 


and help me collect a few wasp holes. They 
are smaller of course than tarantula holes 
and do not make quite such a fine showing 
when you get them home, but they have 
several real advantages over the spider bur- 
rows, only one of which I need tell you now. 
This one is, that you can watch the wasps 
make their holes because they do it in the 
daytime, while you can¡¯t watch the taran- 
tula make its hole because it does it at 
night. So Mary and I went together to 
the place of the wasps. 

I ought to tell you right away that Mary 
and I live in California. This explains to 
you partly why we are so happy in our 
rambles, because for any one whose work 
or whose) play it is to go out and look at 
things, California is a wonderfully good 
place to live in. In fact, I know of none 
better. But I should tell you more of 
where we live, because California is so many 
places at once; that is, so many different 
kinds of places, such as high mountains. 






burning deserts, great forests, fertile plains, 
salt lakes, blue ocean, low soft hills, wide 
level marshes, fragrant orchards, brilliant 
flower gardens, hot springs and volcanic 
cones, deep cafions and rushing rivers, ¡ª 0, 
indeed, almost all the kinds of places that 
the physical geography tells about. 

Mary and I live in a beautiful valley be- 
tween two ranges of mountains and very 
near the marsh-lined shores of a great ocean 
bay. Over beyond one range of mountains 
is the ocean itself stretching blue and rip- 
ply all the way to China, while beyond the 
other range of mountains is a desert with 
jackrabbits and burrowing owls and cac- 
tuses. Not the worst ¡ª or best ¡ª sort of 
desert like that far south toward Mexico, 
but one that gets a little rain, and hence 
is called a ¡°Land of Great Possibilities¡± 
by men who sell pieces of it now and then 
to people from Maine. 

It is easy for us to get from the little 
town in which we live to several very good 




places for looking at things. The foothills 
and mountain sides with their forests and 
coverts and swift little brooks; the orchards 
and flower gardens and grain and grass 
fields; the wide flat marshes with their salt- 
grass and pickle-weed, their wide channels 
and pools, and finally the bay itself; all 
are near by and all are fine places for 
observing and collecting things. 

When I met Mary first ¡ª the time she was 
collecting tarantula holes ¡ª we were on the 
gentle slopes of the lower foothills of the 
mountains. The big hairy tarantulas are 
very numerous there, although one rarely 
sees them because they mostly stay in their 
holes in daytime. There are tarantula 
hawks there too, enormous black and rusty- 
red wasps with wings stretching three 
inches from tip to tip. Mary and I saw 
one of these giant wasps swoop down on a 
big tarantula just as he came out of his 
hole one evening after sundown, and that 
was a battle to remember, and it had a 





very strange ending. The tarantula ¡ª but 
I must save that battle for another chapter 
all to itself. I must try and stick to the 
wasp holes in this one. 

It was a day in September. This month 
in California is the last one of the long, 
rainless, sun-filled summer, and everywhere 
it is very dry and brown. The valley floors 
and foothill slopes lie thirsty and cracking 
under the ardent sun, and a thin cover of 
fine dust lies on all the leaves of the live- 
oak and eucalyptus trees. Everything out 
of doors is waiting for the first rain. The 
birds are still and the frogs all hidden away. 
The insects buzz about rather heavily and 
keep pretty well under cover. If one wants 
to see much lowly life it is necessary to go 
to the banks of the few persisting streams 
or lakes or to the shores of bay or ocean. 
So Mary and I left the dry foothill 
slopes and their many silk-lined holes 
with a big black hairy tarantula sitting 
quietly at the bottom of each, and took 





the gently dropping dusty road to the 
marshes. 

I like the salt marshes of California. 
They are a change and relief, in their sooth- 
ing monotony and simple plant life, from 
the lush and variegated flower fields, the 
dense and hostile chaparral thickets, the 
dark forests of great trees, and the miles 
of artificial plantations of orchards and 
vines. On the marshes you are greater 
and more important than the plants. In 
an orchard or a giant-tree forest, you feel 
second-rate someway. The fruit-trees 
have men for servants, while to the giant 
trees with their outlook from a height of 
three hundred feet and their memories of 
two thousand years, a man is no more than 
an ant. But in the marshes you feel that 
you are much more important a kind of 
creature than the pickle-weed, and that is 
almost the only plant that grows there. 

There are 'many curious little bare dry 
spots in the marshes where we know it. 





Flat, smooth, salt-encrusted, clean white 
spots rather circular in outline, and per- 
haps twenty feet in diameter. All around 
is the low thick growth of fat-leaved pickle- 
weed, but for some reason it doesn¡¯t invade 
these pretty little empty rooms. Mary and 
I like to lie on the clean dry floor of one of 
these unroofed rooms and look up at the 
blue sky and out beyond the low side walls 
of pickle-weed far across the flat marsh 
stretches, over the shining bay, and on 
through the quivering blue to the beauti- 
ful mountains that bound our views on 
both sides. On clear afternoons we can 
see a gleaming white speck on the top of 
the highest mountain in the eastern range. 
That is the famous Lick Observatory, where 
the astronomers are looking always into 
the sky to read the riddle of the stars and 
planets and comets. We feel rather small, 
Mary and I, when we realize that we are 
only loafing or at best watching insignifi- 
cant little insects and collecting wasp holes 






that lie at our noses¡¯ ends, while those men 
up there are looking at wonders millions of 
miles away. But we are so interested and 
contented with our small doings and small 
wonders that we do not at all envy the 
astronomers on the mountain top. While 
they watch the conflagrations of the stars 
and the mighty sailing of the planets 
through the blackness of space, we watch 
the work and play and living of our lowly 
companions on the sun-flooded marshes. 
They like the cold glittering sky; we like 
the warm brown earth. 

We had been lying quietly on the white 
salt sand in one of the unroofed marsh 
rooms for some time this September day 
before we saw the first wasp begin to work. 
She was standing on her head, apparently, 
and biting most energetically with her jaws, 
cutting a little circle in the salt crust. 
When she got the circle all cut, she tugged 
and buzzed 'until she dug up, unbroken, 
the little circular piece (perhaps one-third 




ot an inch across) of crust. She dragged 
this about three inches away. Then she 
returned to the spot thus cleaned and dug 
out with her sharp jaws a bit or pellet of 
soil. Holding this in her mouth, she flew 
away about a foot and dropped it. Then 
came back. Then dug out another pellet 
of soil and carried and dropped it a foot or 
so away. Then back again and so on un- 
til it was plain that she was digging out a 
little cylindrical vertical hole or burrow. 
As the hole got deeper, the wasp had to 
crawl down into it, first with head and 
fore legs, then with head and half her body; 
finally her whole body, long legs, wings 
and all, was hidden as she dug deeper and 
deeper. She had to come out of the hole 
of course to carry away each bit of dug up 
soil. She always backed upward out of 
the burrow, and all the while she was dig- 
ging she kept up a low humming sound. 
It was this humming sound that attracted 
our attention to other narrow-waisted 



wasps like the first one. By moving about 
cautiously and listening and looking care- 
fully, we found more than a dozen others 
digging holes, each one going about the 
work just like every other one. 

When our first wasp had made its hole 
deep enough ¡ª this took a pretty long time; 
we found out later that it was about three 
inches deep ¡ª she brought back the first 
little circular piece of salt crust and care- 
fully put it over the top of the burrow, 
thus covering it up entirely and making it 
look as if no hole were there. Then she 
flew away, out of the little bare room and 
off into the pickle-weed somewhere. We 
waited several minutes but she didn¡¯t come 
back, so we turned our eyes to another 
wasp near by which had its hole only just 
begun. It was interesting to see how 
closely like the first wasp this second one 
worked. Prying and pulling with the jaws, 
the same fluttering of the wings and hum- 
ming, the same backing out of the hole and 




the swift little flight for a foot or two feet 
away from the hole to drop the pellet of 
soil. 

I tried to point out to Mary that this 
was the way animals do which work by 
instinct and not by reason. That all the 
animals of the same kind do things in the 
same way, and that they do them without 
any teaching or imitating or reasoning out. 
They are born with the knowledge and 
skill and the impulse to do the things in 
the particular way they do. But Mary 
found this very tiresome and let her eyes 
rove, and it is well she did or we might not 
have made our great (hscovery: a really 
thrilling discovery it was for us, too. 

The first wasp had come back! But not 
empty handed, or rather not empty 
mouthed, for in her pointed jaws she held 
a limp measuring-worm about an inch and 
a quarter long. A measuring-worm or 
looper is the caterpillar of a certain kind of 
moth, and it loops or measures when it 




walks because it has no feet on the middle 
of the under side of the body as other 
caterpillars have, and so has to draw its 
tail pretty nearly up its head to take a 
step forward. This naturally makes its 
body rise up in a fold or loop. ¡°See,¡± 
cried Mary, ¡°the wasp is going to put the 
measuring-worm into the hole.¡± 

That is exactly what happened. How 
the was]) could tell where the hole was, 
was surprising, for it had so carefully put 
the bit of salt crust in place that you 
couldn¡¯t tell the top of the hole from the 
rest of the crust-covered ground. But our 
wasp came straight to the right place. 
Perhaps as a carrier-])igcon comes to its 
loft from a hundred miles away, or a cat 
carried away in a bag to a strange place 
finds its way quickly back home. 

Some of the other wasps that we watched 
later weren¡¯t so sure of their holes, though, 
and other people who have watched digger- 
wasj)s in other places have found them 



showing varying degrees of uncertainty 
about locating their nests. Mr. and Mrs. 
Peckham, who have studied the behavior 
of the various kinds of digger-wasps more 
than anybody else in this country, have 
concluded that the wasps ¡°are guided in 
their movements by their memory of local- 
ities. They go from place to place quite 
readily because they are familiar with the 
details of the landscape in the district they 
inhabit. Fair eyesight and a moderately 
good memory on their part are all that 
need be assumed in this simple explana- 
tion of the problem.¡± 

But quite different from this conclusion 
is that of Fabre, the wonderful French ob- 
server of wasps, who experimented on them 
in regard to this matter of finding and know- 
ing their holes, by carrying them away 
shut up in a dark box to the center of a 
village three kilometers from the nesting 
ground, and releasing them after being 
kept all night in the dark boxes. These 




wasps when released in the busy town, cer- 
tainly a place never visited by them before, 
immediately mounted vertically to above 
the roofs and then instantly and energet- 
ically flew south, which was the direction of 
their holes. Nine separate wasps released 
one at a time did this without a moment¡¯s 
hesitation, and the next day Fabre found 
them all at work again at their hole-dig- 
ging. He knew them by two spots of white 
paint he had put on each one. 

¡°Are the wasps guided by memory when 
placed by man beyond their bearings and 
carried to great distances into regions with 
which they are unacquainted and in un- 
known directions?¡± asks Fabre. ¡°By 
memory so quick that when, having reached 
a certain height at which they can in some 
sort take their bearings, they launch them- 
selves with all their power of wing towards 
that part of the horizon where their nests 
are? Is it memory which traces their 
aerial way across regions seen for the first 





time? Evidently not,¡± emphatically de- 
clares Fabre. So there you are. Where 
doctors (of science) fall out it is not for you 
or me to decide. 

But Mary was growing excited. ¡°See, 
she has put the worm down and is prying 
up the top of the hole. She has got it off. 
She is¡ª¡± 

¡°Ss-h,¡± say I, for wasps can hear. Or, 
wait; that¡¯s quite dogmatic. Wasps fly 
away when you talk too loud. That¡¯s bet- 
ter. That¡¯s not judging wasp doing by 
what we can do. That is just telling an 
observed fact. 

Mary ¡°ssh¡±-ed, but she pointed a plump 
little finger; a finger trembling with ex- 
citement. The wasp had gone down into 
the uncovered hole with the worm. Then 
she backed out, found the lid, covered up 
the hole and flew away into the pickle- 
weed again! 

In twenty minutes she came back, with 
another limp measuring-worm, straight to 





the covered hole; worm dropped on the 
ground; lid taken off; worm dragged in; 
wasp backed out; lid carefully replaced; 
flight to the distant jungle of pickle- weed 
again! 

O, this was exciting. Mary fairly ex- 
ploded into exclamations and questions 
after the wasp was well away. What are 
the worms for? Are they dead? The 
second one seemed to wriggle feebly a little 
on the ground by the nest while the wasp 
was getting off the lid. Will she bring 
more? Will she fill the hole full of worms? 
Now I knew the answers to some of these 
questions, for I had been in this happy 
place before, but I wanted Mary to find 
out, to discover ¡ª exquisite and prideful 
pleasure ¡ª for herself. So I remained 
dumb. 

Three more times the wasp brought 
worms. Three more times went through 
all the performance. But the last time 
she didn¡¯t come up for a long time; that 




is, for several minutes, and when she did 
come, instead of putting the salt crust on 
the hole, she got a little pellet of soil and 
dropped it in; and then another, and many 
others. Sometimes she scraped them in 
with her front feet, but there weren¡¯t many 
bits of soil close enough for that, for she had 
carried them all a foot or so away as she 
brought them out of the hole. She worked 
very industriously: jumping and running 
about, making little buzzing leaps and 
flights, until she had quite filled up the 
hole with the five dead worms in the bot- 
tom. 

Then she did the most wonderful thing. 
With her fore feet she pawed and raked the 
surface until it was quite smooth, and with 
her jaws and horny head she pressed down 
and tamped the fine bits of soil until they 
were a little below the surface of the salt 
crust around the hole, and then she brought 
again the little circular lid or top of salt 
crust and carefully put it in the little de- 






pression on the top of the filled-in burrow, 
so that it fitted perfectly with the hard 
uncut salt crust around the hole¡¯s edge! 

This is true. Does it seem wonderful to 
you? Why? Because we think that other 
animals cannot do what would be a very 
simple thing indeed for us? Our wasp was 
evidently concealing the whereabouts of 
her worm-stored burrow. I don¡¯t say that 
she wanted to conceal it; or decided to con- 
ceal it; or even intended to conceal it. She 
was simply, I say, concealing it. That 
seems quite certain, doesn¡¯t it? Well, this 
action of cutting out and replacing the bit 
of salt crust over the burrow was about the 
simplest and most effective way of con- 
cealing the hole that could be reasoned 
out, if we ourselves were to undertake it. 
The wasp, and all the other wasps of the 
same kind in our marshes, concealed their 
holes in the way that our reason would 
suggest to us as the best way. But I do 
not say anything about the wasp¡¯s mental 





processes toward getting at this behavior. 
One thing is pretty sure. Among a score 
or hundred of us doing this work, there 
would be pretty sure to be some to do it in 
a different sort of way from the others. 
The wasps of the same kind all do it alike. 
Perhaps that is the chief difference between 
reason and instinct. 

But if our digger-wasp ¡ª whose name is 
Ammophila, the sand-lover ¡ª made Mary¡¯s 
and my eyes bulge out by her cleverness, 
what shall we think of that other Ammo- 
phila that Dr. Williston watched on the 
plains of Kansas, or that other one still 
which the Peckhams studied in Wisconsin? 
These other Ammophilas, instead of using 
their hard heads to tamp down the soil in 
the hole, hunted about until they found a 
suitable little stone which, held tightly in 
the jaws, was used as a tool to pack and 
smooth the dirt! And the Kansas wasp 
did another odd thing. Instead of making 
its hole of the same caliber or width all the 




way down, the upper half-inch or so was 
made of greater diameter than the rest of 
the burrow so that a little circular shelf 
ran around the inside of the hole half an 
inch below the top. Now when the clever 
Kansas wasp closed the burrow each time 
it went away to hunt for measuring-worms, 
it did it in a curious way. I quote the 
exact words of Professor Williston, the ob- 
server: "When the excavation had been 
carried to the required depth¡± ¡ª this is our 
professional way of saying, when the hole 
had been dug deep enough ¡ª "the wasp, 
after surveying the premises, flying away, 
soon returned with a large pebble in its 
mandibles, which it carefully deposited 
within the opening; then, standing over 
the entrance upon her four posterior feet, 
she rapidly and most amusingly scraped 
the dust, ¡®hand over hand¡¯ back beneath 
her till she had filled the hole above the 
stone to the tqp. [The stone of course was 
resting on the little circular shelf half an 



inch down in the hole.] . . . When she had 
heaped up the dirt to her satisfaction, she 
again flew away and immediately returned 
with a smaller pebble, perhaps an eighth 
of an inch in diameter, and then standing 
more nearly erect, with the front feet 
folded beneath her, she pressed down the 
dust all over and about the opening, 
smoothing off the surface and accompany- 
ing the action with a peculiar rasping 
sound.¡± 

Is this not a creature of wits, this Kansas 
wasp? And an undaunted worker? For 
each time she went away to get a nice 
fat looper, she covered up her hole in 
this elaborate way, and each time she 
came back, she had to remove the half- 
inch of tamped-down soil and the little 
covering stone resting on the shelf in 
the hole. 

The Peckhams, too, saw an Ammophila 
in Wisconsin use a pebble as a tool, and 
what is especially interesting and impor- 





tant, this wasp was only a single individual 
of several others watched by the observers, 
all these wasps being of one kind, that is, 
belonging to the same species. The tool- 
user thus revealed an individuality that 
made its actions seem to be dictated by 
something else than rigid instinct; cer- 
tainly so if instinct is to be defined as un- 
taught and unreasoned behavior common 
to all the individuals of a kind. In fact 
the Peckhams (most persistent, practised 
and intelligent observers) insist that ¡® ¡® in 
all the processes of Ammophila the char- 
acter of the work differs with the indi- 
vidual.¡± 

But where is Mary in all this digression 
of mine? Never fear for Mary. While I 
was mumbling about instinct and reason 
and automatism and individual idiosyn- 
crasy, Mary was crawling slowly and cau- 
tiously about over the salt-crust floor of 
our room, counting the wasp holes in course 
of making, and she was making a second 





discovery. The measuring-worms, limp 
and lifeless as they appeared, were really 
not dead! She had seen at least two, left 
lying on the ground by the hole while the 
wasp prized off the cover, give feeble wrig- 
gles, and one that she poked with a pin 
squirmed rather energetically. That is, it 
did if she poked it at one end, but not if 
she poked it in the middle, which is such a 
great discovery .that it really gets to be 
science! 

Now as one is entitled to take violent 
measures for the sake of science, Mary and 
I decided after considerable serious discus- 
sion to ¡°collect¡± the hole which our wasp 
had finished and apparently left for good. 
So we dug it up, and on the spot we exam- 
ined it and all of its insides. And we found 
it quite true that the loopers were not dead, 
but they were paralyzed! When we poked 
a head or tail, each worm could squirm just 
a little, but if we touched them in the mid- 
dle, they didn't know it, and on one of 





them, the top one, we found a little shin- 
ing white speck. 

Mary¡¯s excitement became merged into 
an intense thoughtfulness. Then she cried 
aloud with eyes shining: ¡°My, its the egg! 
the egg of the wasp! and the worms are for 
food for the young wasp when it hatches!¡¯¡¯ 

Ah, Mary, you have wits! Have you 
ever heard any one tell about this? Did 
you really guess it, or pot guess it, but 
actually reason it out for yourself? Mary, 
I have great hopes of you. 

For it is quite true what Mary says. The 
little white seed-like thing glued on to the 
last looper¡¯s body is the egg of the wasp, 
and the stung and paralyzed but not killed 
measuring-worms are the food stored up 
by this extremely clever narrow-waisted 
mother for the wingless, footless, blind, 
almost helpless wasp grub, when it shall 
hatch from the egg. Down in the dark- 
ness of the cell, there will be a horrible 
tragedy. For days and weeks together the 



wasp grub will nibble away on the helpless 
loopers until all five are eaten alive! Then 
the grub will change to a winged wasp with 
strong sharp jaws with which she will dig 
her way up and out of the noisome prison 
and into the free air and sunlight of the 
marsh room. And she will then dig holes 
of her own, find and sting and store loopers, 
lay an egg on one, and close up the hole just 
as her mother did. Or at least all this 
would happen if we hadn¡¯t collected the 
hole. But it will happen in the other holes. 

But why should the loopers be only par- 
alyzed instead of killed? Isn¡¯t it plain 
that if killed they would only be decaying 
carrion by the time the wasp grub was 
ready to eat them, and young wasps must 
have fresh meat, not dead and decayed 
flesh. And if the loopers were simply put 
in alive, not paralyzed, wouldn¡¯t their vio- 
lent squirming in the hole surely crush the 
delicate egg or the more delicate newly 
hatched wasp grub? Or wouldn¡¯t they 





simply dig their way with their heavy jaws 
out of the hole and away? Or, indeed, 
could the slender-bodied mother wasp carry 
and handle successfully a strong squirming 
looper over an inch long? The reason for 
the paralyzing of the worms is plain then. 
But how is this extraordinary condition 
brought about? And the answer to this, 
which Mary and I didn¡¯t discover for our- 
selves, but had to find out from the 
accounts of the men who did, like Fabre 
and others, reveals the most extraordinary 
thing that our wasps do. Most people 
think the wasps that live in communities 
or large families in big paper nests (the 
yellow- jackets and hornets) are the most 
interesting and most intelligent or clever 
of the wasps. But Mary and I do not 
think so. The solitary wasps do the most 
wonderful things, and of all they do, the 
paralyzing of the insects they store up as 
food for their young is the hardest to 
explain on any basis except that of wasp 



reasoning. But of course we don¡¯t have to 
explain it, which is fortunate for the high 
record of truth we are trying to establish 
in this book. 

Fabre, the patient Frenchman, waited 
for years and years for a chance to see just 
how the Ammophila paralyzes her victims, 
and at last he saw and understood it. To 
understand the matter from Fabre¡¯s ac- 
count of it, we must remember that the 
measuring-worm¡¯s body is made up of a 
series of rings or body segments, in each 
of which (except the very last) is a little 
nerve center or brain situated just under 
the skin on the under side of the body. And 
all this row of brains is connected by a 
slender nerve cord running along the mid- 
dle line of the under side of the long body. 
Now Fabre saw that the wasp darted its 
sting into each looper, ¡°once for all at the 
fifth or sixth segment of the victim.¡± And 
when he pricked the stung worms with a 
needle in various parts of the body, he 



found, just as Mary did, that the needle 
could entirely pierce the middle of the body 
(which is where the fifth and sixth segments 
are), without causing any movement of the 
worm. ¡°But prick even slightly a seg- 
ment in front or behind and the caterpillar 
struggles with a violence proportioned to 
the distance from the poisoned segment.¡± 

Now what is the reason, asks Fabre, for 
the wasp¡¯s selecting this particular spot for 
stinging the worm, and he answers his own 
question as follows: 0 *^H 

¡°The loopers have the following organi- 
zation, counting the head as the first seg- 
ment: Three pairs of true feet on rings two, 
three, and four; four pairs of membranous 
feet on rings seven, eight, nine, and ten, 
and a last similar pair set on the thirteenth 
and final ring; in all eight pairs of feet, the 
first seven making two marked groups ¡ª 
one of three, the other of four pairs. These 
two groups are divided by two segments 
without feet, which are the fifth and sixth. 




¡°Now, to deprive the caterpillar of 
means of escape, and to render it motion- 
less, will the Hymenopteron [that¡¯s the 
wasp] dart its sting into each of the eight 
rings provided with feet? Especially will 
it do so when the prey is small and weak? 
Certainly not: a single stab will suffice if 
given in a central spot, whence the torpor 
produced by the venomous droplet can 
spread gradually . with as little delay as 
possible into the midst of those segments 
which bear feet. There can be no doubt 
which to choose for this single inoculation; 
it must be the fifth or sixth, which separate 
the two groups of locomotive rings. The 
point indicated by rational deduction is 
also the one adopted by instinct. Finally, 
let us add that the egg of the Ammophila 
is invariably laid on the paralyzed ring. 
There, and there alone, can the young larva 
bite without inducing dangerous contor- 
tions; where a needle prick has no effect, 
the bite of a grub will have none either. 





and the prey will remain immovable until 
the nursling has gained strength and can 
bite farther on without danger.¡± 

But some Ammophilas catch much larger 
caterpillars than the inch-long, slender, lit- 
tle loopers. Fabre found a wasp dragging 
to its nest a caterpillar weighing fifteen 
times the weight of the wasp. Does one 
stab suffice for such a giant caterpillar? 
Here is what Fabre saw: An Ammophila 
was noticed scratching in the ground around 
the crown of a plant. She was ¡°pulling up 
little grass roots, and poking her head under 
the tiny clods which she raised up, and run- 
ning hurriedly, now here, now there, round 
the thyme, visiting every crack which gave 
access under it; yet she was not digging a 
burrow, but hunting something hidden un- 
derground, as was shown by manoeuvres 
like those of a dog trying to get a rabbit 
out of its hole. And presently, disturbed 
by what was going on overhead and closely 
tracked by the Ammophila, a big gray 




worm made up his mind to quit his abode 
and come up to daylight. It is all over 
with him; the hunter is instantly on the 
spot, gripping the nape of his neck and 
holding on in spite of his contortions. Set- 
tled on the monster¡¯s back, the Ammophila 
bends her abdomen, and, methodically, de- 
liberately ¡ª ^like a surgeon thoroughly fa- 
miliar with the anatomy of his subject ¡ª 
plunges a lancet into the ventral surface of 
every segment, from the first to the last. 
Not one ring is omitted; with or without 
feet each is stabbed in due order from the 
front to the back.¡± 

This is what the patient, careful observer 
saw, with all the ¡°leisure and ease required 
for an irreproachable observation.¡± ¡°The 
wasp acts,¡± says Fabre, ¡°with a precision 
of which science might be jealous; it knows 
what man but rarely knows; it is acquaint- 
ed with the complex nervous system of its 
victim, and keeps repeated stabs for those 
with numerous ganglia. I said Tt knows; 




is acquainted¡¯ ; what I ought to say is, ¡®It 
acts as if it did.¡¯ What it does is suggested 
to it; the creature obeys, impelled by in- 
stinct, without reasoning on what it does. 
But whence comes this sublime instinct? 
Can theories of atavism, of selection, of the 
struggle for life, interpret it reasonably?¡± 

When I had finished reading this to Mary 
she looked up and said softly; ¡°Of course 
I don¡¯t understand all this that he says 
about ¡®avatism and selection¡¯ and so on, 
but I think the wasp knows. Don¡¯t you?¡¯¡¯ 

¡°Mary,¡± I reply promptly, ¡°the word is 
¡®atavism,¡¯ not ¡®avatism,¡¯ please remem- 
ber!¡¯¡¯ 

¡°I hope I can,¡± said Mary. 





The meadow lark on the fence post be- 
hind my house is unusually voluble this 
uncertain morning; maybe he is getting 
his day¡¯s singing off before the sun shall 
hide, discomfited,^ ^behind the unrolling 
cloud furls. A solemn grackle, with yellow 
eyes and bronzed neck, stalks with cocking 
head in the wet green of the well-groomed 
front lawn; a whisking bevy of gold- 
finches, which chat to each other in high- 
pitched hurried phrases, disposes itself with 
much concern in the bare tree across the 
road, and swinging along overhead, a wood- 
pecker cries its harsh greetings. But the 
hfe here on the street is tame and usual 
compared to that busy living and to those 
eventful happenings taking place in a re- 



moter corner of the garden. There where 
the warm dust is figured with the dainty 
tracks of the quail hosts and the flower- 
flies hum their contentedest note; there 
in that half-artificial, half-wild covert of 
odorous vegetation, a life in miniature, with 
the excitement and stresses, the failures 
and successes and the inevitable comedies 
and tragedies of any world of life is going 
on, with the history of it all unrecorded. 

Mary has just cdfne to call on me, bring- 
ing an unkempt bouquet of Scotch broom 
from the garden. On these branches of 
broom are many conspicuous white spots. 
They are not flowers, for it is not broom 
flower time, and the flowers are yellow when 
their time does come. But these white 
spots, soft little cottony masses, like little 
pillows or cushions, and with regular tiny 
flutings along the top, have puzzled Mary, 
and she has come to ask me about them, 
for I am supf)Osed to know all things. Well, 
luckily, I do happen to know about these. 







but I suggest that we go into the garder 
together and see if we can find out. Th( 
truth is, I am glad of an excuse to get awa) 
from this tiresome German book aboui 
Entwicklungslehre. And then, too, I wani 
to look at things and talk with Mary. 

Mary has such a fascinatingly serioui 
way of doing things that aren¡¯t serious ai 
all. She has got the curious notion latel) 
that many little people live among th( 
grasses, the grass people she calls them, anc 
that that is the reason there are so man] 
very little white flowers coming up ini m3 
lawn. My own notion had been that som* 

ij 

rascally seedsman had sold me unclear 
grass seed, but Mary¡¯s notion that the grisi 
people are planting and raising these litt^ 
flowers for their own special delectation is 
of course, a much wiser one. So when w< 
walk on the lawn, we go very slowly, and ] 
have to poke constantly among the grasses 
with my stick as we move along so that th< 
little people may know we are coming anc 






have time to scurry away from under our 
great boots. 

When we got out to the row of brooms, 
we found many of the soft white cushions 
on all the bushes. But some of them were 
torn and dishevelled. And in these torn 
masses many tiny round particles could be 
seen. These little black specks are simply 
eggs, insect eggs, as I told Mary, and soon 
she had discovered among them some 
slightly larger but still very small red spots 
which were waving tiny black feet and 
feelers about. They were of course the 
baby insects just hatching from the eggs. 

¡°Does the mother lay the eggs in these 
little white cushions and then go away and 
leave them?¡± asks Mary. 

¡°No, she stays right by them,¡± I answer. 

¡°But where is she then? I can¡¯t ¡ª Yes 
I can too,¡± cries Mary in great triumph. 
¡°Here she is at one end of the egg cushion. 
She is a part ¡®of it.¡± 

¡°Well, no, not exactly,¡± I have to say. 




¡°It is part of her, or rather she spins the 
cushion, which is really a sac or soft box 
of white wax, in which to lay her eggs. 
Something the way the spiders do, you 
know. Only their egg box is made of silk 
and usually fastened to a fence rail or on 
the bark of a tree and left there. But some 
of the spiders, the large, swiftly running, 
black kinds that live under stones, carry 
the silken ball with the eggs inside about 
with them, fastened to the end of the body. 
Well, this cottony cushion scale insect ¡ª 
that¡¯s its right name ¡ª keeps its waxen sac 
of eggs fastened to it, but as the egg sac is 
much larger than the insect itself, it can¡¯t 
run about any more, but has to stay for all 
the rest of the time until it dies in the spot 
where it makes the sac. However, as it 
gets all the food it wants by sticking its 
slender little beak into the broom or other 
plant it is on and sucking up the fresh sap, 
it gets on very well.¡± 

¡°But what makes some of the egg cush- 




ions ¡ª how pretty they arc, too! ¡ª so torn 
and pulled open,¡± asks Mary, who has lis- 
tened to my long speech very nicely. She 
often gets impatient when I lecture for too 
many minutes together. 

¡°That is for you to find out,¡± I say. 
¡°There is a dreadful thing going on here if 
you can only see it. But a rather good 
thing too. Good for the broom bushes 
anyway, and as they are my broom bushes 
and I like their flowers, good for me.¡± 

Just then a very stubby, round-backed, 
quick little red beetle with black spots 
walked off a broom stem on to Mary¡¯s hand. 
She didn¡¯t scream, of course, nor even jerk 
her hand away. She may learn when she 
is older to be frightened when pretty, harm- 
less, little lady-bird beetles walk on her. 
But now she likes all sorts of small animals, 
and is not afraid at all. 

Mary is not at all slow to understand 
things, and when this hard-bodied little 
beetle, with a body like half a red-and-black 


pill, walked oh the broom on to her hand, 
she guessed that he might have something 
to do with the torn-up egg cushions. So it 
didn¡¯t take her long to find another little 
beast like him actually nosing about in an 
egg sac and voraciously snapping up all the 
unfortunate tiny, red, black-legged baby 
scale insects. He ate the eggs, too, and 
seemed to take some bites at the mother 
insect herself, and then Mary found more 
of the lady-bird beetle's, and still more. 
They were on all the broom bushes where 
the white cushions were. And so one of 
the dreadful tragedies going on in my gar- 
den was soon quite plain to Mary, and she 
was very sorry for the helpless white in- 
sects. 

¡°Where did the red beetles come from?¡± 
she asked pretty soon. 

¡°From Australia,¡± I answered. ¡°Or 
rather their great-great-grandparents did. 
These particular beetles were probably born 
right here in the garden, because a colony 





of them live here. But they couldn¡¯t if 
there were not some cottony cushion scale 
insects here too. For this particular kind 
of lady-bird beetle can¡¯t live on any other 
food ¡ª at least they don¡¯t ¡ª except this par- 
ticular kind of scale insect and its eggs, 
which is surely a curious thing, isn¡¯t it?¡± 

But Mary is so used to finding that the 
insects have extremely unusual and curious 
habits ¡ª that is, habits different from ours 
¡ª that she doesn¡¯t get excited any more 
when I tell her about them. She does 
though when she finds them out for her- 
self, which makes me wonder if I haven¡¯t 
wasted a good deal of time in my life giv- 
ing lectures to students about things in- 
stead of always making them find out for 
themselves. And maybe I am wasting 
some more time now while I am writing! 

¡°How did they come from Australia?¡± 
asks Mary. For she knows that Australia 
is several thousand miles away across the 
ocean from California, and lady-bird beetles 





do not swim. At least not from Australia 
to America. So I have to give Mary an- 
other informing lecture, and this is it: 

¡°Years and years ago, there lived in some 
fragrant-leaved orange-trees in Australia 
some white cottony cushion insects whose 
life was untroubled by other cares than 
those of eating and of looking after the 
children. As each insect was fastened for 
life on the leaf or twig that supplied it with 
all the food it needed, which was simply an 
occasional drink of sap, and as the white 
insects always died before their children 
were born, neither of these cares was very 
harassing. On thousands of other similar 
fragrant-leaved orange-trees in Australia 
lived millions of other similar white insects. 
And for a long time this race of white in- 
sects enjoyed life. Those were happy days. 
But on a time there came into one of the 
trees a few small red beetles, who eagerly 
and persistently set about the awful busi- 
ness of eating the defenceless white insects. 




From this tree the red beetles, or the chil- 
dren of them, went to other trees where 
white insects lived, and with unrelenting 
rapacity and uncloyed appetite ate all the 
white insects they could find. And so in 
other trees; and finally, with years, the red 
beetles had invaded all of the thousands of 
fragrant-leaved orange-trees in Australia, 
and had eaten nearly all of the millions of 
white insects. 

¡°One day a very small orange-tree was 
taken out of the ground in Australia and 
sent with many others across the ocean to 
California. On this small tree there were 
a few of the white insects. The little tree 
was planted again in California and soon 
put out many fresh fragrant leaves. The 
white insects were astonished and rejoiced 
that day after day went by without the ap- 
pearance of any red beetles. The white 
insects increased in numbers; there were 
thousands of fragrant-leaved orange-trees 
in California, and in a few years there were 



millions of white insects in them. One 
morning a man stood among the trees and 
said, 'Confound these bugs; they¡¯ll ruin me; 
what shall I do?¡¯ and a man who knew said, 
¡®Get some red beetles from Australia.¡¯ So 
this orange-grower, with some others, paid 
a man to go to Australia and collect some 
live red beetles. The collector went across 
the ocean, three weeks¡¯ steady steaming, and 
sent back a few of the voracious little bee- 
tles in a pill box. They were put into a 
tree in a California orange-orchard in which 
there were many cottony cushion scale in- 
sects. The red insects promptly began eat- 
ing the white ones; and their children and 
grandchildren and great-grandchildren 
have kept up this eating ever since. And 
so the orange-growers never tire of telling 
how the red beetles (whose name is Veda- 
lia) were brought from Australia to save 
them from ruin by the white insects (whose 
name is Icerya).¡± 

Now there are not many cottony cush- 





ion scales left in CaUforina. A very prom- 
ising colony of them seems to have sprung 
up in my Scotch broom bushes. But the 
red beetles have found their way there 
already, as Mary and I discovered to-day, 
and so we think that by the time the broom 
flowers come, there will be few white in- 
sects left in the bushes. 









This is the story of a fight. In the first 
story of this book, I said that Mary and I 
had seen a remarkable fight one evening at 
sundown on the slopes of the bare brown 
foothills west of the campus. It was not 
a battle of armies ¡ª we have seeii\th^^f, too, 
in the little world we watch, ¡ª but a com- 
bat of gladiators, a struggle between two 
champions born and bred for fighting, and 
particularly for fighting each other. One 
champion was Eurypelma, the great, black, 
hairy, eight-legged, strong-fanged taran- 
tula of California, and the other was Pepsis, 
a mighty wasp in dull-blue mail, with rusty- 
red wings and a poisonous javelin of a 
sting that might well frighten either you 
or me. Do you have any wasp in your 




neighborhood of the ferocity and strength 
and size of Pepsis? If not, you can hardly 
realize what a terrible creature she is. 
With her strong hard-cased body an inch 
and a half long, borne on powerful wings 
that expand fully three inches, and her 
long and strong needle-pointed sting that 
darts in and out like a flash and is always 
full of virulent poison, Pepsis is certainly 
queen of all the wasp amazons. But if 
tbcit is PC, no less is Eurypelma greatest, 
most areadful, and fiercest, and hence king, 
of all the spiders in this country. In South 
America and perhaps elsewhere in the 
tropics, live the fierce bird-spiders with 
thick legs extending three inches or more 
on each side of their ugly hairy bodies. 
Eurypelma, the California tarantula, is not 
quite so large as that, nor does he stalk, 
pounce on and kill little birds as his South 
American cousin is said, to do, but he is 
nevertheless a tremendous and fear-inspir- 
ing creature among the small beasties of 
field and meadow. 








But not all Eurypelmas are so ferocious; 
or at least are not ferocious all the time. 
There are individual differences among 
them. Perhaps it is a matter of age or 
health. Anyway, I had a pet tarantula 
which I kept in an open jar in my room 
for several weeks, and I could handle him 
with impunity. He would sit gently on 
my hand, or walk deliberately up my arm, 
with his eight, fixed, shining, little reddish 
eyes staring hard at me,¡°apc| hi^ long 
seven-jointed hairy legs swinging gently 
and rhythmically along, without a sign of 
hesitation or excitement. His hair was 
almost gray and perhaps this hoariness 
and general sedateness betokened a ripe 
old age. But his great fangs were un- 
blunted, his supply of poison undiminished, 
and his skill in striking and killing his 
prey still perfect, as often proved at his 
feeding times. He is quite the largest 
Eurypelma I have ever seen. ' He measures 
¡ª ^for I still have his body, carefully stuffed. 



and fastened on a block with legs all 
spread out ¡ª live inches from tip to tip of 
opposite legs. 

At the same time that I had this hoary 
old tarantula, I had another smaller, coal- 
black fellow who went into a perfect ecstasy 
of anger and ferocity every time any one 
came near him. He would stand on his 
hind legs and paw wildly with fore legs and 
palpi, and lunge forward fiercely at my 
inquisitive^ pciicit I found him originally 
in the niiddle of an entry into a classroom, 
holding at bay an entire excited class of 
art students armed with mahl-sticks and 
paint-brushes. The students were mostly 
women, and I was hailed as deliverer and 
greatest dompteur of beasts when I scooped 
Eurypelma up in a bottle and walked off 
with him. 

But this is not telling of the sundown 
fight that Mary and I saw together. We 
had been over to the sand-cut by the golf 
links, after mining-bees, and were coming 




home with a fine lot of their holes and 
some of the bees themselves, when Mary 
suddenly called to me to ¡°see the nice 
tarantula.¡± 

Perhaps nice isn¡¯t the best word for him, 
but he certainly was an unusually impos- 
ing and fluffy-haired and fierce-looking 
brute of a tarantula. He had rather an 
owly way about him, as if he had come 
out from his hole too early and was dazed 
and half-blinded by the light. Tarantulas 
are night prowlers; they do all their hunt- 
ing after dark, dig their holes and, indeed, 
carry on all the various businesses of their 
life in the night-time. The occasional one 
found walking about in daytime has made 
a mistake, someway, and he blunders 
around quite like an owl in the sunshine. 

All of a sudden, while Mary and I were 
smiling at this too early bird of a taran- 
tula, he went up on his hind legs in fight- 
ing attitude, and at the same instant down 
darted a great tarantula hawk, that is, a 




Pepsis wasp. Her armored body glinted 
cool and metallic in the red sunset light, 
and her great wings had a suggestive shin- 
ing of dull fire about them. She checked 
her swoop just before reaching Eurypelma, 
and made a quick dart over him, and then 
a quick turn back, intending to catch the 
tarantula in the rear. But lethargic and 
owly as Eurypelma had been a moment 
before, he was now all alertness and agility. 

-A * 

He had to be. He was defending his life. 
One full fair stab of the poisoned javelin, 
sheathed but ready at the tip of tlie flexi- 
ble, blue-black body hovering over him, 
and it would be over with Eurypelma. 
And he knew it. Or perhaps he didn¡¯t. But 
he acted as if he did. He was going to do 
his best not to be stabbed; that was sure. 
And Pepsis was going to do her best to 
stab; that also was quickly certain. 

At the same time Pepsis knew ¡ª or any- 
way acted as if she did ¡ª that to be struck 
by one or both of those terrible vertical, 





poison-filled fangs was sure death. It 
would be like a blow from a battle-axe, 
with the added horror of mortal poison 
poured into the wound. 

So Eurypelma about-faced like a flash, 
and Pepsis was foiled in her strategy. She 
flew up and a yard away, then returned 
to the attack. She flew about in swift 
circles over his head, preparatory to darting 
in again. But Iturypelma was ready. As 
she swooped viciously do>vn, he lunged up 
and forward with a half-leap, half-forward 
fall, and came within an ace of striking the 
trailing blue-black abdomen with his reach- 
ing fangs. Indeed it seemed to Mary and 
me as if they really grazed the metallic 
body. But evidently they had not pierced 
the smooth armor. Nor had Pepsis in that 
breathless moment of close quarters been 
able to plant her lance. She whirled up, 
high this time but immediately back, al- 
though a little more wary ¡®evidently, for 
she checked her downward plunge three 




or four inches from the dancing champion 
on the ground. And so for wild minute 
after minute it went on; Eurypelrna always 
up and tip-toeing on those strong hind legs, 
with open, armed mouth always toward 
the point of attack, and Pepsis ever dart- 
ing down, up, over, across, and in and 
out in dizzy dashes, but never quite 
closing. 

Were Mary and I excited? Not a word 
could we utter>-only now and then a swift 
intake of breath; a stifled ¡°0¡± or ¡°Ah¡± 
or ¡°See.¡± And then of a sudden came the 
end. Pepsis saw her chance. A lightning 
swoop carried her right on to the hairy 
champion. The quivering lance shot home. 
The poison coursed into the great soft body. 
But at the same moment the terrible fangs 
struck fair on the blue armor and crashed 
through it. Two awful wounds, and the 
wings of dull fire beat violently only to 
strike up a little cloud of dust and whirl 
the mangled body around and around. 




Fortunately Death was merciful, and the 
brave amazon made a quick end. 

But what of Eurypelma, the killer? Was 
it well with him? The sting-made wound 
itself was of little moment; it closed as 
soon as the lancet withdrew. But not be- 
fore the delicate poison sac at its base in- 
side the wasp-body had contracted and 
squirted down the slender hollow of the 
sting a drop of liquid fire. And so it was 
not well with Eurypelma in his insides. 
Victor he seemed to be, but if he could 
think, he must have had grave doubts 
about the joys of victory. 

For a curious drowsiness was coming 
over him. Perhaps, disquieting thought, it 
was the approaching stupor of the poison¡¯s 
working. His strong long legs became 
limp, they would not work regularly, they 
could not hold his heavy hairy body up 
from the ground. He would get into his 
hole and rest. But it was too late. And 
after a few uneven steps, victor Eury- 




pelma settled heavily down beside his 
amazon victim, inert and forevermore 
beyond fighting. He was paralyzed. 

And so Mary and I brought him home 
in our collecting box, together with the 
torn body of Pc})sis with her wings of slow 
fire dulled by the dust of her last struggles. 
And though it is a whole month now since 
Eurypclma received his stab from the poi- 
soned javelin of Pepsis, he has not recov- 
ered; nor will he ever. When you touch 
him, he draws up slowly one leg after 
another, or moves a palpus feebly. But it 
is living death; a hopeless paralytic is the 
king. 

Dear reader, you are of course as bright 
as Mary, and so you have noticed, as she 
did right away, the close j)arallel between 
what ha])pencd to Eurypelma and what 
happened to the measuring-worms brought 
by Ammophila to her nest burrow as de- 
scribed in the first story in this book. And 
so, like Mary, yon realize that the vendetta 





or life feud between the tarantula family 
and the family of Pepsis, the tarantula 
hawk, is based on reasons of domestic 
economy rather than on those of sentiment, 
which determine vendettas in Corsica and 
feuds in Kentucky. 

To be quite j)lain, Pepsis fights Eury- 
pelma to get his huge, juicy body for food 
for her young; and Eurypelma fights Pepsis 
to keep from becoming paralyzed proven- 
der. If Pepsis had escaped unhurt in the 
combat at which Mary and I ¡± assisted,¡± as 
the French say, as enthralled spectators, 
we should have seen her drag by mighty 
effort the limp, paralyzed, spider giant to 
her nest hole not far distant ¡ª a great hole 
twelve inches deep and with a side cham- 
ber at the bottom. There she would have 
thrust him down the throat of the burrow, 
and then crawled in and laid an egg on the 
helpless beast, from which in time would 
have hatched the carnivorous ¡®wasp grub. 
Pepsis has many close allies among the 





wasps, all black or steely blue with smoky 
or dull-bronze wings, and they all use 
spiders, stung and paralyzed, to store 
their nest holes with. 

¡°Do the little black and blue wasps 
hunt the little spiders and the larger ones 
the big spiders?¡± asks Mary. 

¡°Exactly,¡± I respond, ¡°and the giant 
wasp of them all, Pepsis, the queen of the 
wasp amazons, hunts only the biggest 
spider of them all, Eurypelma, the taran- 
tula king, and we have seen her do it.¡± 

¡°Well,¡± says Mary, ¡°even if she wants 
him for her children to eat, it¡¯s a real ben- 
detta, isn¡¯t it?¡± 

¡°Indeed it is,¡± I answer, ¡° it¡¯s more real, 
and fiercer, and more relentless, and more 
persistent than any human vendetta that 
ever was. For every Pepsis mother in the 
world is always hunting for Eurypelmas to 
fight. And not all Corsicans have a ven- 
detta on hand, nor all Kentuckians a 
feud.¡± 






¡°It seemed that some one was calling 
to me in a whisper ¡ª ¡®Sahib! Sahib! Sa- 
hib!¡¯ exactly as my bearer used to call me 
in the mornings. I fancied that I was de- 
lirious until a handful of sand fell at my 
feet. Then I looked up and saw a head 
peering down into the amphitheater ¡ª the 
head of Dunnoo, my dog-boy, who at- 
tended to my collies. As soon as he had 
attracted my attention, he held up his 
hand and showed a rope. I motioned, 
staggering to and fro the while, that he 
should throw it down. It was a couple of 
leather punkah-ropes knotted together, 
with a loop at one end. I s]ipj)ed the loop 
over my head and under my arms; heard 
 






Dunnoo urge something forward; was con 
scious that I was being dragged, face down- 
ward, up the steep sand-slope, and the 
next instant found myself choked and 
half-fainting on the sand-hills overlooking 
the crater.¡± 

And then Mary broke in. We were ly- 
ing in a sunny warm spot on an open hill- 
side a little way off the road, and I was 
reading aloud from a favorite author. 

¡°That is a fairy story,¡± said Mary, ¡°and 
I thought we were not going to read any 
more fairy stories now that I am grown 
up.¡± 

Mary¡¯s idea of being grown up is to be 
more than three feet eleven inches high 
and to have her hair no longer in two 
braids. 

¡°Not exactly a fairy story,¡± I replied. 
¡°For Kipling rather prefers soldiers to 
fairies and machines to caps of invisibility. 
Of course, though, he wrote the Mowgli 
stories.¡± 




¡°But those are not fairy stories,¡± inter- 
rupted Mary. ¡°Those were about a real 
boy and real animals only a long way off 
and different from ours.¡± 

¡°Ah-um, real? Well, perhaps; any- 
way, the Mowgli animals seem more real 
than most real animals. But this story of 
the sand-pit and the man sliding down 
into it and not being able to get out isn¡¯t 
impossible at all. Only the other people 
down in the bottom seem a little unusual.¡± 

¡°No, there can¡¯t be any such place,¡± 
said Mary positively, ¡°and as there can¡¯t 
be any such place, nobody could have slid 
into it or been in the bottom, and so it is 
a fairy story. Any story that isn¡¯t so is a 
fairy story.¡± 

¡°Well, that makes it easy to tell a fairy 
story from the other kinds, and I never 
knew exactly how before. But I once saw 
a place much like the sand-pit that Mor- 
rowbie Jukes slid into, or thit Kipling 
says he slid into. It is on the side of a 




great mountain in Oregon; Mt. Hood its 
name is. I had climbed far above timber 
line, that is, above where all the trees and 
bushes stop because it is too cold for them 
to live, and there is only bare rocks and 
snow and ice, and had sat down to rest 
near a great snowbank a mile long. As I 
looked back down the mountain I saw a 
curious yellowish smoke rising in little 
puffs and curls. I decided find out 
about this smoke on my way down; per- 
haps it was the beginning of a forest fire, 
and ought to be put out. 

¡°Well, when I got to it there was no 
fire; the puffs and curls were not smoke. 
It was a real Morrowbie Jukes pit; a great 
crater-like hole in the mountain, with its 
side so steep that the loose volcanic sand 
and rocks (for the whole mountain is an 
old volcano) kept slipping down in little 
avalanches from which puffs and curls of 
fine yellow' dust kept rising and drifting 
lazily away. If I had made the mistake 






of going too close to the edge, I should 
certainly have started one of these ava- 
lanches and gone slipping and sliding, 
faster and faster, to the very bottom, a 
thousand feet below.¡± 

¡°My!¡± said Mary; ¡°and were there 
horrible people in the bottom, and 
crows?¡± 

¡°Well, really, Mary, I couldn¡¯t see on 
account of the dust-smoke.¡± 

¡°Of course there weren¡¯t, probably,¡± 
said Mary thoughtfully and a little wist- 
fully. 

¡°Probably not,¡± I had to reply regret- 
fully. 

But a bright thought came to me. I re- 
membered something. Several days before 
I had tramped along this hillside road near 
which Mary and I were lying and I had 
seen ¡ª well, just wait. So I said to Mary; 
¡°But I know where there is a Morrowbie 
Jukes pit, several of them, indeed, near 
here. Sha¡¯n¡¯t we go and see them?¡± 





¡°Why, of course,¡± said Mary rather 
severely. 

¡°Let us go galloping as Morrowbie Jukes 
did,¡± said I. So we took hold of hands 
and as soon as we got out of the chapar- 
ral, we went galloping, hop, hop, hoppity, 
hop, down the road. I must confess that 
I got out of breath pretty soon and my 
knees seemed to creak a little. And when 
a swift motor-car came exploding by, go- 
ing up the hill, all the people stared and 
smiled to see an elderly gentleman with 
spectacles and a long coat hop-hopping 
along with a yellow-haired red-cheeked 
little girl in knee skirts. But we don¡¯t 
mind people much! They simply don¡¯t 
know all the things that go with being 
happy. 

Pretty soon ¡ª and it was high time, for 
I had only three breaths left ¡ª we came to 
a place where the road bent sharply around 
the hillside and was especially broad. 

¡°Now, Mary,¡± I said, ¡°be careful and 




don¡¯t fall in. I¡¯m afraid I could not get 
you out.¡± 

¡°Fall in where? Get me out of what?¡± 
asked Mary, quite puzzled. She was star- 
ing about excitedly, looking most of the 
time down into the canon with its spiry 
redwood trees pushing far up from the bot- 
tom. And then suddenly she saw. She 
flopped down on her hands and knees in 
the warm sand by the roadside and cried 
out, ¡°What funny little holes!¡± 

¡°Why, Mary,¡± I said with pained sur- 
prise. ¡°You don¡¯t really mean to call 
these awful Morrowbie Jukes pits ¡®funny 
little holes¡¯ ! That isn¡¯t fair after all we¡¯ve 
done to find them. Especially alter my 
galloping all the way right to the very edge 
of this largest one.¡± 

As I spoke I pointed it out with the toe 
of my shoe, but inadvertently filled it all 
up by poking a couple of tablespoonfuls 
of sand and dust into it. But size is quite 
a relative matter, and for the tiny creatures 





with whom Mary and I have to deal, the 
little crater-like holes in the sand of the 
roadside are large and dangerous ])its. We 
sprawled down on our stomachs among the 
pits to see what we could see. 

Mary saw first. Ah, those bright eyes! 
My spectacles are rather in the way out-of- 
doors, I find. But if I keep on getting 
younger ¡ª and I certainly am younger since 
I got acc^uainted with Mary ¡ª I shall be 
able soon to leave them at home in my 
study when I go out to see things. 

Mary, then, saw first. What she saw 
were two very small shining, brown, gen- 
tly curved, sharp-pointed, sickle-like jaws 
sticking up out of the loose sand in the very 
bottom of one of the pits. They moved 
once, these curved and pointed jaws, and 
that movement caught Mary¡¯s eye. 

¡°It¡¯s the dragon of the pit,¡¯¡¯ I cried. 
¡°Dig him out!¡¯¡¯ 

So Mary dug him out. He was very 
spry and had a strong tendency to shuffle 



backwards down into the hiding sand. 
But it takes a keen dragon to get away 
from Mary, and this one wasn¡¯t and 
didn¡¯t. 

He was an ugly little brute, squat and 
hump-backed, with sand sticking to his 
thinly haired body. But he was fierce- 
looking for all his diminutivencss. Re- 
member again that whether a thing is big 
or little to you depends on whether you 
are big or little. This dragon of the sand- 
pit was little to us. He is terribly big to 
the ants. 

When Mary got him out and had put 
him down on the sand near the pit, he 
trotted about very actively but always 
backwards. He seems to have got so used 
to pulling backwards against the frantic 
struggles of his prey to get up and out of 
the pit, that he can now only move that 
way. After we watched him ¡¯a while, we 
¡°collected¡± him; that is, put him into a 
bottle, with some sand, to take home and 





see if we could keep him in our room of 
live things. Then we turned our attention 
to another crater. It was about three 
inches across at the top and about two 
inches deep; a symmetrical little broad- 
mouthed funnel with the loose sand-slopes 
just as steep as they could be. The slight- 
est disturbance, a touch with a pencil- 
point for example, would start little sand 
avalanches down the slopes anywhere. It 
is, of course, easy to see how this horrible 
pit-trap works. And, in fact, in the very 
next moment we saw actually how it did 
work. 

A foraging brown ant that was running 
swiftly over the ground plunged squarely 
over the verge of the crater before she 
could stop. She certainly tried hard to 
stop when once over, but it was too late. 
Slipping and sliding with the rolling sand- 
grains, dowli she went right toward those 
waiting scimitar-like jaws. 

Now, these jaws deserve a word of de- 




scription. Because, horrible as they may 
seem to the unfortunate ants, they are so 
well arranged for their particular purpose 
that they must attract our admiration. 
The dragon of the pit, ant-lion he is usually 
called, has no open, yawning mouth behind 
those projecting jaws, as might be expected. 
Indeed there is no mouth at all, just a 
throat, thirsty for ant blood! The slender 
scimitar jaws have each a groove on the 
concave inner side, and down this groove 
runs the blood of the struggling victim, 
held impaled on the sharp points of the 
curving mandibles. The two fine grooves 
lead directly into the throat, and thus 
there is no need of open mouth with lips 
and tongue, such as other insects have. 

¡°But see,¡± cried Mary, ¡°the ant has 
stopped sliding. It is going to get out!¡± 

Ah, Mary, you are not making allowance 
for all the resources of this dreadful dragon 
of the pit. Not only is the pit a nearly 
perfect trap, and the eager jaws at the 





bottom more deadly than any array of 
spilces or spears at the bottom of an ele- 
phant pit, but there is another most effect- 
ive thing about this fatal dragon¡¯s trap, 
and that is this: it is not merely a passive 
trap, but an active one. Already it is in 
action. And Mary sees now how hopeless 
it is with the ant. For a shower of sand 
is being thrown up from the bottom of the 
pit against the ant and it is again sliding 
down. The dragon has a flat, broad head 
and powerful neck muscles, and has wit 
enough to shovml up and hurl masses of 
dry sand-grains against the victim on the 
loose slopes. And this starts the ava- 
lanche again, and so down slides the frantic 
ant. 

What follows is too painful for Mary 
and me to watch and certainly too cruel 
to describe. But one must live, and why 
not ant-lions as well as ants? If truth 
must be told, many ants have as cruel 
habits and as bloodthirsty tastes as the 




ant-dragon. Indeed, more cruel and re- 
volting habits. For ants have a gastro- 
nomic fondness for the babies of other 
ants, which is a fondness quite different 
from that which they ought to have. It 
means that they like these babies ¡ª to eat. 
Some communities of ants, indeed, spend 
most of their time fighting other com- 
munities just to rob them of their babies, 
which they carry off to their own nests and 
use in horrible cannibalistic feasts. 

Mary and I had seen enough of tlie Mor- 
rowbie Jukes pits. So we went back to 
our little open sunny spot in the chaparral 
on the hillside and lay quiet and silent for 
a long time. Then Mary murmured, ¡°I 
wonder how the ant-lion digs its pit.¡± 

¡°I can tell you, Mary,¡± I replied. ¡°For 
a man who once saw one digging told me. 
It is this way: First he makes a circular 
groove the full circumference of the top of 
the pit. Then he burrows into the sand 
inside of the groove and piles sand-grains 





on top of his flat, horny, shovel-like head 
with his fore feet. This sand he tosses over 
the groove so that it will fall outside. He 
works his way all around the groove, doing 
this over and over, and then makes another 
groove inside the first, and digs up and 
tosses the sand out as before. And so on, 
groove after groove, each inside the one 
made before, thus gradually making a con- 
ical pit with the sides as steep as the loose 
sand will lie. The pit must always be 
made in a dry sandy spot, and is usually 
located in a warm sunny place at the foot 
of a large rock. This man said that it is 
easy to get the ant-lions to dig pits in 
boxes of sand in the house, and so we can 
try with our ¡®collected¡¯ fellow.¡± 

Mary was silent some moments. Then 
she said softly, ¡°But how will he get any- 
thing to eat?¡± 

¡°Why,¡± said I, ¡°of course we can give 
him ¡ª ¡± Mary looked up at me in a spe- 
cial way she has. I go on, more slowly, 




but still without very much hesitation; 
¡°But, of course, we sha¡¯n¡¯t do that, shall 
we?¡± 

And Mary said quietly: ¡°No, we sha¡¯n¡¯t.¡± 

We rested our chins on our hands and 
lay still, looking down over the chaparral- 
covered hillside and far out across the hazy 
valley. On the distant bay were little 
white specks, small schooners that carry 
wood and tan-bark and hay from the bay 
towns to San Francisco; and across the 
blue bay lifted the bare, brown mountains 
of the Coast Range, with always that gleam- 
ing white spot of the Observatory a-tiptop 
of the highest peak. It was a soft, lan- 
guid, lazy day. Such a peace-giving, re- 
laxing, healing day! And we were so en- 
veloped by it, Mary and I, that we simply 
lay still and happy, with hardly a word. I 
had, of course, intended to give Mary an 
informing lecture about how the ugly, hor- 
rid ant-lion finally stops preying on ants 
and roUs himself up in a neat little silk-and- 




sand ball, and changes into a beautiful, 
slender-bodied, gauzy-winged creature 
without any resemblance at all to its earlier 
incarnation. But I didn¡¯t. It was too fine 
a day to spoil with informing lectures. 

And so Mary and I lay still and happy. 
Finally it was time to go. As we went 
down the road we ])assed again the place 
of the pits, and Mary looked once more at 
the neat little craters with their patient 
waiting jaws at the bottom. 

¡°I wonder,¡± she said, musingly, ¡°if Mr. 
Kipling ever saw an ant-lion pit.¡± 

¡°I wonder,¡± said I. 






Argiope of the Silver Shield is the hand- 
somest spider that Mary and I know. Do 
you know a handsomer? Or are you of 
those who have prejudices, and hold all 
spiders to be ugly, hateful things? We are 
so sorry for you if you are, for that means 
you can never enjoy having a pet Argiope. 
The truth is, Mary and I like clever and 
skillful people, but when we can¡¯t find that 
kind, we rather prefer clever and skillful 
spiders and wasps or other lowly beasties 
to the other sort of people, which shows 
just how far a fancy for nature may lead 
one. 

It is rather bad, of course, to prefer to 
chum with a spider, even such a wonder- 
fully handsome and clever one as Argiope, 



instead of with a human soul. But that 
isn¡¯t our situation exactly. We prefer 
human souls to anything else on earth, but 
not human stomachs and livers and human 
bones and muscles and sick human nerves. 
And, someway, too many people leave on 
one an impression of bowels or sore eyes 
rather than one of mind and soul. So we 
rush to the fields or woods or roads after 
such an experience and live a while with 
the keen bright eyes, the sensitive feelers, 
the dexterous feet and claws and teeth, and 
the sharp wits of the small folk who, 
while not human, are nevertheless inhabi- 
tants and possessors of this earth, side by 
side with us, and are truly our blood- 
cousins, though some incredible number of 
generations removed. 

Mary and I scraped acquaintance with 
our Argiope in a cypress-tree. That is, 
Argiope had her abiding-place there; she 
was there on her great symmetrical orb- 
web, with its long strong foundation lines. 











its delicate radii and its many circles with 
their thousands of tiny drops of viscid stuff 
to make them sticky. In the center was 
the hub, her resting-place, whence the 
radii ran out, and where she had spun a 
broad zigzaggy band of white silk on which 
she stood or sat head downward. Her 
eight long, slender, sensitive legs were out- 
stretched and rested by their tips lightly 
on the bases of the taut radii so that they 
could feel the slightest disturbance in the 
web. These many radii, besides support- 
ing the sticky circles or spiral, which was 
the real catching part of the web, acted 
like so many telegraph lines to carry news 
of the catching to waiting Argiope at the 
center. 

I have said that Mary and I think Ar- 
giope of the Silver Shield the most hand- 
some spider we know. There are, however, 
other Argiopes to dispute the ¡¯glory with 
our favorite; for example, a golden-yellow- 
and-black one and another beautiful silver- 





and-russet one. Other people, too, may 
fancy other spiders; perhaps the little pink- 
and-white crab-spiders of the flower-cups, 
or the curious spiny Acrosomas and Gaster- 
acanthas with their brilliant colors and bi- 
zarre patterns and shape. Others may 
like the strawberry Epeira, or the diadem- 
spider, or the beautiful Nephilas. There 
are enough kinds and colors and shapes of 
spiders to satisfy all tastes. But we like 
best and admire most the long-legged, 
agile, graceful Argiopes, and particularly 
her of the silver shield. Her full, firm body 
with its flat, shield-shaped back, all shin- 
ing silver and crossed by staring black-and- 
yellow stripes, the long tapering legs 
softly ringed with brown and yellow, the 
shining black eyes on their little rounded 
hillock of a forehead, and the broad, brown 
under body with eight circular silver spots; 
all go to make our Argiope a richly dressed 
and stately queen of spiders. But the 
royal consort ¡ª O, the less said of him, the 




better. A veritable dwarf; insignificant, 
inconspicuous and afraid for his life of his 
glorious mate. How such a queen could 
ever ¡ª but there, how tiresome, for that is 
what gets said of most matches, royal or 
plebeian. 

Mary and I brought Argiope in from her 
home in the cypress-tree and put her in a 
fine, roomy, light and airy cage, where she 
could live quietly and unmolested by ene- 
mies, and where we could see to it that she 
should not lack for food. There are many 
of the small creatures with whicli we get 
acquainted that do not object at all to be- 
ing brought into our well-lighted, well-ven- 
tilated, warm vivarium ¡ª that means live- 
room. Creatures of sedentary habits, and 
all the web-making spiders are of course 
that, ought not to object at all and iTsually 
do not seem to. For they get two things 
that they cannot be sure of outside: pro- 
tection and plenty of food. A rgiope seemed 
perfectly content and settled right down to 





spinning a glistening new web, a marvel of 
symmetry and skillful construction, in her 
roomy cage, and in a day or two was seated 
quietly but watchfully on the broad-banded 
hub in the center, with her toes on her tele- 
graph lines, ready for good news. It was, 
of course, our duty to see that she was not 
disappointed. 

The message she wanted was from some 
struggling fly fastened anywhere in the 
broad expanse of web. So we tossed in a 
fly. It buzzed about a moment, then 
blundered into the web which it shook 
violently in its struggle to escape. Argiope 
rushed at once out upon the web. 

¡°How can she run about on the sticky 
web without getting caught, too?¡± inter- 
rupts Mary. 

I think a moment, then with some dig- 
nity reply: ¡°Pretty soon, please, Mary.¡± 

Argiope, I repeat, rushed at once out 
upon the web, seized the fly in her jaws 
and ran back to the hub with it, where she 




appeared to wet it all over, squeeze it into 
a ball and then proceed to feed upon it, 
holding and manipulating it skillfully all the 
time in her jaws. Evidently Argiope was 
very hungry, for as you will see, this is not 
her usual way of taking care of her prey. 

¡°Now, Mary, what was it you asked?¡± 

¡°Oh, just how the spider can run around 
SO fast on the web without sticking to it 
and getting caught or tearing it all to 
pieces.¡± 

¡°Ah, ¡ª ah, yes. Well, Mary, I don¡¯t 
know! that is, exactly; or, well not even 
very close to exactly. But she docs it, 
you see.¡± 

¡°Yes, I see,¡± said Mary, demurely, and 
¡ª can it be that Mary is slightly winking 
one eye? I do hope not. 

¡°Of course you know, Mary, that the 
web is made of two kinds of silk or rather 
two kinds of lines? Oh, you didn¡¯t know?¡± 
Mary has shaken her head. 

¡°Well it is,¡± I continue, with my usual 




manner of teacher-who-knows somewhat 
restored again. ¡°The foundation lines, 
tlie radii and a first set of circles are all 
made of lines without any sticky stuff on 
them. As you sec¡± ¡ª and I touch my pen- 
cil confidently to a radius, with the manner 
of a parlor magician. ¡°Then the spider, 
on this foundation, spins in another long 
spiral, the present circles of the web, which 
is liberally supi)lied with tiny, shining drop- 
lets of viscid silk that never dries, but stays 
moist and very sticky all the time. This 
is the true catching part of the web.¡± 

¡°We surely must watch her spin a web 
sometime,¡± breaks in eager Mary. 

¡°We certainly must,¡± say I, and con- 
tinue. ¡°Now perhaps when Argiope runs 
out on the web from her watching-place at 
the hub, she only puts her long delicate feet 
on the unsticky radii. Or perhaps her feet 
are made in some peculiar way so that they 
do not stick to the circles. As a matter of 
fact, a spider¡¯s foot is remarkably fash- 





ioned, with curious toothed claws, and 
hosts of odd hairs, some knobbed, some 
curved and hook-like, and some forming 
dense little brushes. But after all, Mary, 
the truth is, I don¡¯t know really how it is 
that spiders can run about over their webs 
without getting stuck to them.¡± 

After my long discursus about web-mak- 
ing and spider¡¯s feet, it seemed time to give 
Argiope another fly. Indeed her bright 
little black eyes seemed to Mary to be shin- 
ing with eagerness for more fly, although 
she still had the remains of the first one in 
her jaws ¡ª gracious, Argiope¡¯ s jaws, please, 
not Mary¡¯s! 

So we tossed in another fly. We hope 
you won¡¯t think this cruel. But flies are 
what Argiope eats, and if she was out in the 
garden, she would be catching them, and, 
what is worse, they would not be the dis- 
gusting and dangerous house-flies and blue- 

o 

bottles that we feed her, but all sorts of 
innocent and beautiful little picture-winged 





flower-flies and pomace-flies and what not. 
House-flies and stable-flies and bluebottles 
are truly dangerous because they help 
spread human diseases, especially typhoid 
fever. So if we are to live safely they 
should be killed. Or, better, prevented 
from hatching and growing at all. 

So we tossed in another fly. Argiope 
immediately dropped the nearly finished 
first fly into the web, ran out to the new 
one and pounced on it, seizing it with her 
fore legs. Then she doubled her abdomen 
quickly underneath her and there issued 
from the spinnerets at its tip a jet, a flat 
jet of silk, which was caught uj^ by the hind 
feet and wrapped around the fly as it was 
rolled over and over by the front feet. She 
tumbled it about, all the time wrapping it 
with the issuing band of silk, until it was 
completely enswathed. Then she left it 
fastened in the web, went back to the hub, 
and resumed her feeding on the first fly. 
But soon she finished this entirely, dropped 




the wreck out of the web and went out and 
got the second fly, bringing it back to the 
hub to eat. 

¡°But why,¡± asked Mary, ¡°does Argiope 
wrap the fly up so carefully in silk? Why 
not just kill it by biting, and then leave it 
in the web until she wants it?¡± 

¡°Perhaps,¡± I answer, ¡°she wants to 
make it helpless before she comes to close 
quarters with it. You notice she holds it 
away from her body with her fore feet and 
pulls the silk band out far with her hind 
feet so that her body does not touch the 
fly at all while she wraps it. Perhaps she 
is not sure that it isn¡¯t a bee or some other 
stinging insect. It buzzes loud enough to 
make me think it a bee.¡± 

So Mary and I decided to try some ex- 
periments with our Argiope to find out, if 
possible, first, if she could tell a bee from a 
fly, and second, if so, whether she treated 
it differently, and third, why she wraps 
her prey up so carefully before coming to 





too close quarters with it. We feel quite 
proud of these experiments because we 
seemed to be doing something really scien- 
tific; and we know that Experimental 
Zoology, that is, studying animals by ex- 
perimenting with them, is quite the most 
scientific thing going nowadays among pro- 
fessional naturalists. So here are our notes 
exactly as we wrote them during our ex- 
perimenting. This is, of course, the cor- 
rect manner for publishing real scientific 
observations, because it gives the critical 
reader a chance to detect flaws in our tech- 
nique! 

OUR NOTES ON THE BEHAVIOR OF ARGIOPE 

¡°Nov. i8, 4:45 P.M.; released a fly in the 
cage. The spider pounced upon it, seized 
it with fore and third pair of legs, threw 
out a band of silk and enswathed it, tum- 
bling it Over and over with her hind feet 
about thirteen times, hence enswathed it 
in thirteen wrappings of silk. The fly was 





then disconnected from the web, the spider 
making but little attempt to mend the gap. 
It was carried to the hub and eaten. While 
the feast was going on, a honey-bee [with 
sting extracted; we didn¡¯t want to run any 
risks with Argiope!] was liberated in the 
cage. As soon as it touched the web, the 
spider was upon it, throwing out a band of 
silk in a sheet a quarter of an inch broad. 
[¡®Drawing out¡¯ would be more accurate, 
for the spinnerets cannot spurt out silk; 
silk is drawn out and given its band char- 
acter by lightning-like movements of the 
comb-toothed hind feet.] With her hind 
legs Argiope turned the bee over and over 
twenty-five or twenty-six times, thus en- 
swathing it with twenty-five or twenty-six 
wrappings of the silken sheet. 

¡°No sooner was the bee enswathed than 
a second bee was liberated in the cage and 
caught in the web. This was treated by 
the spider like bee No. i. 

¡°Nov. 20, 8:15 A.M.; Argiope perfectly 





still in center of hub, feeding on bee No. 2. 
The only thing that reveals the feeding is 
a slight moving of the bee¡¯s body as the 
juices are sucked up. Remains of bee 
No. I dropped to the bottom of the 
cage. 

¡°Fed all day, 8:15 a.m. to 5 p.m., on bee 
No. 2. 

¡°At 2:30 P.M., a box-elder bug, which is 
very ill-smelling, was thrown into the web. 
Argiope did nothing for three minutes, then 
went out on the web to it and wrapped, 
making five complete turns; then went 
away. Probably not hungry, as she has 
had two bees and a fly in three days. 

¡°Nov. 21, 8:15 A.M.; box-elder bug fin- 
ished during last night. Old web replaced 
by a new one with twenty-nine radii, eleven 
complete spirals and several partial spirals. 
The hub is formed of fine irregular web- 
bing about an inch and a half in diameter, 
without the viscid droplets that cover the 
spirals. An open space of about a half- 





inch intervenes between the hub and the 
beginning of the spirals. 

¡°4:30 P.M.; liberated a fly in the cage. 
Argiope pounced upon it and began to eat 
immediately, not taking time or trouble to 
enswath it. 

¡°While the fly was being devoured, we 
liberated a strong-smelling box-elder bug 
in the cage. It flew into the web. Ar- 
giope, by a quick movement, turned on the 
hub toward the bug and stood in halting 
position for eight seconds, then approached 
the bug slowly, hesitated for a second or 
two, then wrapped it about with five wrap- 
pings, halted again, and finally finished 
with five more wrappings. The bug was 
then attached to the web where it had first 
touched, the spider passing back to the cen- 
ter and resuming her meal. 

¡°When the fly was finished, Argiope 
walked over to the bug, grasped it in her 
mandibles, walked up to the hub, turned 
herself about so that her head was down- 



ward, manipulated the bug with her fore 
and third pair of feet until it seemed to be 
in right position for her with reference to 
the hub of the web, and began to feed. 

¡°5 P.M.j bee liberated in cage with sting 
not extracted. Argiope leaped instantane- 
ously to the spot where it was caught, 
enswathed it with great rapidity thirty- 
seven times, then bit at it, and enswathed 
it five times more, making forty-two com- 
plete wrappings in all, then left it fastened 
in the web and resumed feeding upon the 
bug. All the time she was wrapping it, 
Argiope kept her body well clear of the 
bee¡¯s body, the spinnerets being fully one- 
half an inch from the bee, making the 
broad band of issuing silk very noticeable. 
In biting it, which she seemed to do with 
marked caution, she of course had to bite 
through the silken covering. 

¡°A few minutes later a second bee, with 
sting, was liberated in the cage, caught in 
the web and rapidly pounced on by the 




spider. As before, she turned it over and 
over with great rapidity, using apparently 
all of her legs. She enswathed it fifty times, 
bit it, and then wrapped it with five more 
silken sheets, making fifty-five wrappings in 
all. Leaving it hung to the web, she went 
back to the bug. 

¡°Before Argiope had reached the bug, 
bee No. 3 was caught in the web at the 
exact spot where bee No. 2 was hung up. 
In its efforts to disentangle its feet, it shook 
the whole web violently. In spite of the 
violent vibration of the web, Argiope pur- 
sued her course to the bug at the hub of 
the web, adjusted herself with head down- 
ward, and resumed feeding. 

¡°Query: Did Argiope think the web- 
shaking due to futile struggles of the well- 
wrapped bee No. 2, and hence needing no 
attention? 

¡°Vibration of the web continued. After 
several seconds had elapsed, Argiope seemed 
suddenly to realize that her efforts were 



called for out on the web, for she pounced 
down as rapidly as before and rolled and 
tumbled both bees together, enswathing both 
in the same sheet of silk, never stopping 
until she had given them fifty-five wrap- 
pings. After biting twice, she wrapped 
them with five more turns, bit again, and 
wrapped again with seven more turns, mak- 
ing sixty-seven in all. Argiope then re- 
turned to her bug. 

"Query: Does Argiope distinguish bees 
from flies? 

"Further query: Does Argiope distin- 
guish bees with stings from bees with stings 
extracted? 

"Nov. 22, 9:45 A.M.; Argiope feeding at 
hub on bees Nos. 2 and 3 introduced into 
cage yesterday afternoon. With her right 
second leg she holds taut a line connected 
with bee No. i. 

¡°10:25 A.M.; packet dropped to the bot- 
tom of the cage, the juices of only one of 
the bees having been sucked out. The 



web is constructed at an angle so that any- 
thing dropped from the center falls free 
of it. 

"5 P.M.; began feeding again on bee 
No. I. 

"Nov. 23, 9:30 A.M.; another bee re- 
leased in cage, caught in web and en- 
swathed approximately thirty turns by 
Argiope. 

¡°Nov. 25, 8:30 A.M.; the web has been 
destroyed during the night. 

¡°Nov. 26, Argiope has made an entirely 
new web. 

¡°Nov. 30, 2 P.M.; gave Argiope a bee 
with sting. It was wrapped forty-seven 
times, but not so expeditiously as has been 
her wont. Later another bee was liberated 
in the cage, caught and wrapped about 
forty-five times. 

¡°Dec. 2, II A.M.; the body of a live bee 
was bathed in fluid from the freshly 
crushed body of a box-elder bug [very 
malodorous], and the bee liberated in 






Argiope¡¯s cage, and soon caught in the 
web. The bee was not very lively and 
did not shake the web violently, but 
Argiope rushed to it without hesitation, 
wrapped it with twenty-five turns of silk 
and returned to the hub of the web. 

¡°Dec. 3 ; Argiope stayed all day in the 
upper part of the web, on foundation lines, 
with head downward. 

¡°Dec. 5; yesterday Argiope moved 
down to her normal place on the hub. 
To-day she is on the hub, but in reversed 
position [head up], and with legs bent and 
limp, not straight out and stiffened as 
usual. 

¡°Dec. 6; Argiope hung all day from 
foundation lines of upi)er part of web, in 
reversed position [head up], with legs limp 
and bent. 

¡°Dec. 7; Argiope hanging by first and 
second right legs, from upper part of web; 
barely alive. 

¡°Dec. 8; Argiope dead.¡± 






An entire colony of those strange little 
people, the Orange-dwellers, were killed in 
our town yesterday morning. And not a 
newspaper reporter found it out! Just one 
of the Orange-dwellers escaped, and as 
Mary and I were the means of saving his 
life, and are taking care of him as well as 
we can (Mary has him now on a small 
piece of orange-rind in a pill box), he has 
told us the story of his life and something 
about the other orange-dwelling people. 
Some of the Orange-dwellers live in Mex- 
ico; some live in Florida, and some in 
California; in fact they are to be found 
wherever oranges grow. Of course, you 
have guessed already that the Orange- 
dwellers are not human beings; they are 
not really people; they are insects. 



The name of the Orange-dweller we had 
saved, and with whom we became very 
well ac(iuainted, is so long and strange that 
I shall tell you merely his nickname, which 
is Citrinus. The oranges on which Citri- 
mis and a great many of his brothers and 
sisters and cousins lived grew in Mexico, 
and when these oranges were ripe, they 
were gathered and packed into boxes and 
sent to our town. Imagine if you can the 
fearful strangeness of it! To have one¡¯s 
world plucked from its place in space, 
wrapped up in tissue-paper, and packed 
into a great box with a lot of other worlds; 
then sent off through space to some other 
place whete enormous giants were waiting 
impatiently for breakfast! When Citrinus¡¯s 
world reached our town, one of these giants, 
who is my brother, took it up, and saying, 
¡°Sec, what a specked orange,¡± straight- 
way began unwittingly to kill all of the 
Orange-dwellers on it by vigorously rub- 
bing and scra])ing it. For Citrinus and his 


companions were the specks! That is all 
an Orange-dweller seems to be when care- 
lessly looked at; simply a little circular, 
scale-like, blackish or reddish-brown speck 
on the shining surface of the orange, his 
world. You can find the Orange-dwellers 
almost any morning at breakfast. 

When my brother began to scrape off 
the specks, I hastily interfered, but only in 
time to save one of the little people, Cit- 
rinus, whom, as I have said, Mary has since 
faithfully cared for. He will soon die, 
however, for he has lived already nearly 
three months, and that is a ripe age for an 
Orange-dweller. But he has had time 
enough to tell me a great deal about his 
life, and as it is such a curious story, and 
is undoubtedly true, I venture to repeat 
it here to you. As a matter of fact I 
must confess ¡ª still Mary says that of course 
Citrinus can talk, because he talks with 
other Orange-dwellers later in the story, 
and so of course can talk to us now. 




Citrinus has lived for almost his whole 
life on the orange on which we found him. 
His mother lived on one of the fragrant 
leaves of the tree on which the orange 
grew. She was, as Citrinus is now, simply 
a reddish-brown circular speck on the 
bright-green orange-leaf; and because she 
couldn¡¯t walk, she had to get all her food 
in a peculiar way. She had a long (that 
is, long for such a tiny creature), slender, 
pointed hollow beak or sucking-tube, which 
she thrust right into the tender orange- 
leaf, and through which she sucked up the 
rich sap or juice which kept flowing into 
the leaf from the twig it hung on. She 
had thus a constant supply of food always 
ready and convenient; whenever she was 
hungry she simply sucked orange-sap into 
her mouth until she was satisfied. This is 
the way all the Orange-dwellers get their 
food, the very youngest of the family being 
able to take care of itself from the day of 
its birth. They never taste any other kind 



of food but the juice from the leaf or twig 
or golden orange on which they live. 

Citrinus is one of a large number of 
brothers and sisters, more than fifty in- 
deed, who were hatched from tiny reddish 
eggs which the mother laid under her own 
body. Before laying the eggs, Citrinus¡¯s 
mother had built a thin shell or roof of 
wax over her back, and after the eggs were 
laid she soon died and her body shriveled 
up, leaving the eggs safely housed under 
the waxen roof. When the baby Orange- 
dwellers were hatched, each had six legs 
and a delicate little sucking-beak project- 
ing from his small plump body. Citrinus 
and his brothers and sisters scrambled out 
from under the wax shell and started out 
each for himself to explore the world. 
First, however, each thrust his beak into 
the leaf and took a good drink of sap. 
Then they were ready to begin their jour- 
neying. But a terrible thing happened! 

Just as Citrinus was pulling his beak out 





of the soft leaf, he saw a great six-legged 
beast, in shape like a turtle, with shining 
red-and-black back and fearful snapping 
jaws. On each side of its head, which it 
moved slowly from side to side, it had an 
immense eye, which looked like a hemi- 
spherical window, with hundreds of panes 
of glass in it. The beast¡¯s legs were large 
and powerful, and on each foot there were 
two claws, eacli of them as long as the 
whole body of Citrinus. Truly this was 
an appalling sight, and all of the little 
Orange-dwellers ran as fast as they could, 
which, unfortunately, wasn¡¯t very fast. 
The beast leisurely caught up in its great 
jaws one after another of Citrinus¡¯ s brothers 
and sisters, and crushed and tore their ten- 
der bodies to pieces and ate them! 

Now this beast, which seemed so large to 
Citrinus, w'as what is to us a very small 
and pretty insect, one of the lady-bird 
beetles. These beetles care for no other 
food than plump Orange-dwellers and 




other equally toothsome small insects; and 
instead of being sorry for its victims, we 
are glad it eats them! This seems very 
cruel indeed, but there are so many, many 
millions of the Orange-dwellers all suck- 
ing the juice of orange-trees that although 
they are so small, and each one drinks so 
little sap, yet altogether they do a great 
amount of damage to the orange-trees, 
often killing all the trees in a large orchard. 
So the lady-birds are a great help to the 
orange-growers. 

Little Citrinus escaped from the Beetle 
by crawling into a small, dark hole in the 
surface of the leaf; but he was badly 
frightened. This was his first experience 
with the terrible dangers of the world, with 
the struggle for life, which is going on so 
bitterly among the people of his kind, the 
insects. For although there would seem 
to be enough plants and trees to serve as 
food for all of them, many insects find it 
easier or prefer to eat other insects than to 





live on plant food. Now because the in- 
sects which live on plant food do injury to 
our fruit-trees and vegetables and grain 
crops by their eating, we call them inju- 
rious insects; while we call the insect-eating 
kinds beneficial insects, because they de- 
stroy the injurious insects. 

But little Citrinus didn¡¯t look at the 
matter at all in this light. He thought 
the lady-bird beetle a very cruel and 
wicked being, and resolved to warn every 
Orange-dweller he met in his travels to 
beware of the cruel, turtle-shaped beast 
with the shining black-and-red back. As 
he wandered on from leaf to leaf along 
the tender twigs in the top of the tree, 
he met many other Orange-dwellers, 
whom he would have told all about 
the Beetle, but he found that all of 
them had had experiences as sad as his; 
in fact he soon learned that of all the 
Orange-dwellers who are born, only a very, 
very few escape the Beetles and other de- 





vouring beasts who pursue them. And 
he was highly indignant when one shrewd 
Orange-dweller told him that it really was 
a good thing for the race of Orange-dwellers 
that so many of them were killed. For, 
the shrewd Orange-dweller said, if all of 
us who are born should live and have fam- 
ilies, and not die until old age came on, 
there would soon be so many of us that we 
should eat all the orange-trees in the 
world, and then we should all starve to 
death. And this is quite true. 

Finally Citrinus came to a remarkable 
being, a very beautiful being indeed. It 
had two long, slender, waving feelers on 
its head, four large ball-shaped eyes, and, 
strangest of all, two delicate gauzy wings. 
This beautiful creature greeted Citrinus 
kindly and asked him where he was going. 
Citrinus, who was at first a little afraid of 
the strange creature, was reassured by its 
kind greeting, and answered simply, ¡°I 
don¡¯t know. My brothers and sisters were 




all eaten by the Beetle; my father and 
mother I have never seen; and no one has 
told me where to go.¡± 

The stranger smiled a little sadly and 
said, ¡°That is the common story among us 
Orange-dwellers. Our fathers and mothers 
always die before we are born. It is a 
great pity Yes, before my little Orange- 
dweller children are born ¡ª ¡± 

¡°What,¡± cried Citrinus, ¡°are you an 
Orange-dweller; you, who are so different 
from me?¡± 

¡°Indeed I am,¡± replied the gauzy-winged 
creature. ¡°I am an old Orange-dweller. 
Oh, I know it seems strange to you,¡± he 
continued, noticing the look of astonish- 
ment on Citrinus¡¯s face, ¡°but some day 
you will look just like me. You will have 
wings, and be able to fly; and will have 
long feelers on your head to hear and to 
smell with, and big eyes to see all around you 
with. You will have some strange experi- 
ences, though, before you become like me.¡± 



¡°But as I had started to say, we fathers, 
and the mothers too for that matter, al- 
ways die before you youngsters are hatched 
out of your eggs. Now I shall probably 
die to-morrow or next day, because I have 
lived three days already, and that is a 
long time to live without eating.¡± 

Little Citrinus could hardly believe his 
senses. It was so wonderful. ¡°But why 
don¡¯t you eat,¡± urged Citrinus, who felt 
very badly to think of any one¡¯s going 
without food for three days. He always 
took a drink of sap every few minutes. 

¡°Why, how absurd,¡± replied the winged 
Orange-dweller, ¡°don¡¯t you see I have 
nothing to eat with? No sucking-beak, no 
mouth at all. When I get my wings and 
my four eyes, I lose my mouth, and can¡¯t 
eat or drink any more.¡± 

This was incredible; but when Citrinus 
looked at the head of his companion, he saw 
it was perfectly true. He had no mouth. 
Citrinus gently waved his little sucking- 




beak, to be sure he still had it. Suddenly 
he began to cry; a sad thought had come 
to him. ¡°And did my mother starve to 
death too?¡± he sobbed. 

¡°Not at all, little one,¡± rather impa- 
tiently exclaimed the other. Little Cit- 
rinus seemed to know so very little, indeed. 
¡°Your mother was not at all like me. 
When she was full-grown she had no wings, 
no legs, and no eyes, but she had a very 
long beak, and could suck up a great deal 
of orange-sap. If you will listen and not 
interrupt, I will tell you how we Orange- 
dwellers grow. When we are hatched 
from our eggs we are all alike, brothers and 
sisters. We each have a plump little body, 
six legs, two eyes, and a sucking-beak to 
get food with. We walk about for a few 
days, and finally stop on some nice green 
leaf or juicy orange, and stick our beaks 
far in and go to sleep, or do something very 
like it. We never walk about any more. 
Indeed, if you are a girl Orange-dweller 





you never leave this spot, but live all the 
rest of your life and die here. However, 

I am getting too far along in my story. 
While we are asleep we shed all of our skin, 
fold it up into a little ball or cushion and 
put it on our backs, together with some 
wax which comes out of small holes in our 
bodies. While shedding our skin we make 
a great change in our bodies. We lose 
our legs! So we simply remain where we 
went to sleep, with our beaks stuck into 
the leaf, sucking the sap. After a few days 
we go to sleep again, and again we shed 
our skins and fold them on our backs. But 
at this time something even more wonder- 
ful than before happens to our bodies. 
That is, to the bodies of the boy Orange- 
dwellers. For this time we lose our suck- 
ing-beaks, but we regain our six legs, and 
in addition we get a second pair of eyes, 
we find on our heads a pair of long, slen- 
der, hairy feelers, and, most pleasing of all, 
we have been provided with a pair of wings. 





Our wings are not yet full-grown or ready 
to fly with, so we still remain quietly in 
our resting-place for a few days longer, 
when we shed our skin once more, and 
then fly away, looking just as I do now. 
Our sisters, though, when they shed their 
skins the second time, make no change in 
their bodies, except to grow larger. They 
remain with their sucking-beaks thrust 
into the leaf. They keep increasing the 
size of the wax scale or shell over their 
backs, until they are entirely covered by 
it. Now they look just as your mother 
did. From above, all one can see is the 
flat circular wax scale with two spots on 
it, where the folded-up cast skins are. Un- 
derneath the scale lies the Orange-dweller, 
with its sucking-beak stuck into the sap, 
but with no legs or wings or long, hairy 
feelers. After a while she lays a lot of 
eggs under her body, and then dies. And 
soon the new family is born. Now this is 
the way we grow, and all of the wonder- 




ful things which have happened to me will 
happen to you, ¡ª ^if the Beetle does not get 
you.¡± 

With that the winged Orange-dweller 
flew away, and little Citrinus was left alone, 
wondering over the strange story. After 
taking a drink of sap from the leaf on which 
he was standing, he wandered aimlessly 
about until he came to a large yellow ball 
hanging from the branch, which gave out 
a delightful odor. Scrambling down the 
slender stem by which it was suspended, 
he walked out on to the shining surface of 
the orange; for, of course, that is what 
the yellow ball was. He tried a drink of 
sap from the ball and found it delicious. 
He decided to stay on the ball, the more 
readily as he was getting rather tired with 
his long traveling, and a sort of sleepy 
feeling was coming over him. So thrust- 
ing his beak far into the ball, he went to 
sleep. How long he slept he doesn¡¯t know, 
but when he awoke he could hardly be- 






lieve his senses. He had no legs; and on 
his back there was a thin shell of wax and 
a little packet. He realized, too, that he 
was bigger than he was before he went to 
sleep. Then the strange story told him 
by the winged Orange-dweller came back 
to him, and he knew that the stranger had 
told the truth. The first great change had 
happened. He was delighted, for he 
thought it would be very pleasant to have 
wings and fly about wherever he wished, 
to see the world. 

Suddenly a great shock came: his World 
trembled, then shook violently, and, with 
a quick wrench, started to move swiftly 
through space. Then came a stop, a ser- 
ies of shocks and curious whirlings, and 
then a filmy-white cloud settled down over 
it all, shutting out the sunlight and the 
blue sky. Finally there came a few more 
shocks and wrenches, and then total dark- 
ness and silence. Citrinus had held on to 
his world all through this, because his beak 



was still thrust into the fragrant surface, 
and now he felt thankful that he had come 
alive through these series of world catas- 
trophes and convulsions and still had all 
the food he could possibly use. 

After a few days, when Citrinus¡¯s world 
all nicely wrapped in tissue-paper and 
packed in a box with ninety-nine other 
similar worlds had traveled a thousand 
miles, the sunlight came again, and soon 
after came that greatest danger of all ¡ª 
that danger from which I saved him by 
staying my brother¡¯s hand in its ruthless 
rubbing off of the specks on his break- 
fast orange! Now Citrinus and Mary and 
I are all waiting impatiently for the day 
when he shall get his beautiful wings and 
his two pairs of eyes. 








When Mary and I came to examine our 
ant-lion dragon the day after our adven- 
tures among the Morrowbie Jukes pits, we 
found him dead in the bottle of sand. Per- 
haps his haughty spirit of dragon could not 
stand such ignominious bottling up, or per- 
haps there wasn¡¯t enough air. Anyway, 
His Fierceness was dead. His cruel curved 
jaws would seize and pierce no more forag- 
ing ants. His thirsty throat would never 
again be laved by the fresh blood of vic- 
tims. Vale dragon! 

But there are more dragons than one in 
our world. Not only more ant-lion drag- 
ons, but more other kinds of dragons. And 
this is one of the great advantages that 
Mary and I enjoy in our looking about in 






the fields and woods for interesting things. 
If we were looking for the dragons of fairy 
stories, we could only expect to find one 
kind ¡ª if, indeed, we could expect to find 
any kind at all in these days when so few 
fairies are left. If we could find it, how- 
ever, it would be a monstrous beast in a 
forest cavern, with scaled body and clawed 
feet and great ugly head that breathed fire 
and smoke from its gaping mouth. That 
would be an interesting sort of dragon to 
see, we confess, more interesting than the 
great one, a hundred yards long, that we 
saw in a Chinese procession in Oakland, 
with two excited Chinamen jumping about 
in front of its head and jabbing at its eyes 
with spears. And more interesting than 
the one that roars and spits at Siegfried on 
the stage while the big orchestra goes off 
into wild clamors of 0-see-the-dragon mu- 
sic. But we do not expect ever to find a 
real fairy-story dragon any more, and so 
we content ourselves with trying to find as 






many different kinds of real dragons as we 
can in our world of little folk on the cam- 
pus. These dragons are rather small, but 
they are unusually fierce and voracious, to 
make up for their lack of size. And so they 
serve very well to interest us. 

To make up for the death of the ant- 
lion dragon of the sand-pits, I promised to 
take Mary to see the Dragon of Lagunita. 
Or rather the dragons, for there are many 
in Lagunita, and indeed many in several 
other places on the campus. Have I ex- 
plained that Lagunita is a pretty Spanish 
word for ¡° little lake,¡± and that our Lagu- 
nita is just what its name means, and be- 
sides is as pretty as its name? There is 
only one trouble about it. And that is, 
that every year, in the long, rainless, sun- 
fiUed summer, it dries up to nothing but 
a shallow, parched hollow in the ground, 
and all the dragons have to move. But 
this moving is a remarkable performance. 
For while during the spring the Lagunita 





dragons live rather inactively in their lairs 
under the water, when summer comes they 
all transform themselves into great flpng 
dragons of the air, and swoop and swirl 
about in a manner very terrif5dng to see. 

The morning we were to make our jour- 
ney to Lagunita, I came to Mary¡¯s house 
with a rake over my shoulder. 

¡°But what are you going to do with the 
rake?¡± said Mary. 

¡°One doesn¡¯t go to seek a dragon with- 
out weapons,¡± I replied with dignity. 
¡°And a rake is a much more formidable 
weapon in the hands of a man who knows 
how to rake than a gun in the hands of a 
man who doesn¡¯t know how to shoot.¡± I 
am something of an amateur gardener, but 
not at all the holder of a record at clay 
pigeons nor king of a Schutzen-verein. So 
I carried my rake. 

¡°Then what weapon shall I carry?¡± asks 
Mary. 

I ponder seriously. 





¡°A tin lunch-pail,¡± I finally reply. 

¡°With luncheon in?¡± asks Mary. 

¡°Empty,¡± I say. 

So we start. 

I have already said that Lagunita is a 
pretty little lake. It lies just under the 
first of the foothills that rise ridge after 
ridge into the forested mountains that sep- 
arate us from the ocean. Indeed, it is on 
the first low step up from the valley floor, 
and from its enclosing bank or shore one 
gets a good view of the level, reaching val- 
ley thickly set with live-oak trees and 
houses and fields. Around the little lake 
have grown up pines, willows and other 
beautiful trees, and at one side a tiny 
stream comes in during the wet season. 
There is no regular outlet, but the water 
which usually begins to come in about 
November keeps filling the shallow bowl 
of the lake higher and higher until by 
spring it is nearly bank full and may even 
overflow. Then as the long dry summer 





season sets in, the level of the water grows 
lower and lower until in August or Sep- 
tember there is only left a small muddy 
puddle crammed with surprised and de- 
spairing little fishes and salamanders and 
water-beetles and the like, who are not at 
all accustomed to such behavior on the 
part of a lake. And then a few days later 
they are all gasping their last breaths there 
together on the scum-covered, waterless 
bottom. 

But when Lagunita is really a lake, it is 
a very pretty one, and Mary and I love to 
go there and sit on the bank under the wil- 
lows near the horse paddocks and watch 
the college boys rowing about in their 
graceful, narrow, long-oared shells. These 
swift-darting boats look like great water- 
skaters, only white instead of black. , You 
know the long-legged, active water-skaters 
or water-striders that skim about over the 
surface of ponds or quiet backwater pools 
in streams in summer time? 



So Mary and I went to Lagunita with 
our rake and tin lunch-pail to hunt for 
dragons. No shining armor; no great 
two-handed sword; no cap of invisibility. 
Just a rake and a tin lunch-pail. 

¡°Where, Mary, do you think is the like- 
liest place for the dragon?¡¯¡¯ I ask. 

Mary answers promptly, ¡°There at the 
foot of the steep stony bank where the big 
willow-tree hangs over.¡± 

We go there. I grasp my rake firmly 
with both hands. I reach far out over the 
shallow water. Then I beat the rake sud- 
denly down through the water to the bot- 
tom, and with a quick strong pull I drag it 
out, raking out with it a great mass of oozy 
mud and matted leaves. I drag this well 
up on shore, and both Mary and I flop 
down on our knees and begin pawing 
about in it. Suddenly Mary calls out, 
¡°I¡¯ve got one,¡± and holds up in her fin- 
gers an extraordinary, kicking, twisting 
creature with six legs, a big head, and a 




thick, ugly body on which seem to be the 
beginnings of several fins or wings. It 
has, this creature, two great staring eyes, 
and stout, sharp-pointed spines stick out 
from various parts of the body. 

¡°Put him in the lunch-pail,¡± I shout. 
I had already filled it half-full of water 
from the lake. 

Then I found one; then Mary another, 
and then I still another. It was truly 
great sport, this dragon-hunting. 

We put them all into the lunch-pail 
where they lay sullenly on the bottom, 
glaring at each other, but not offering to 
fight, as we rather hoped they would. 

Then, what to do? These dragons in 
their regular lairs at the bottom of Lagu- 
nita might do a lot of most interesting 
things, but dredged up in this summary 
way and deposited in a strange tin pail in 
the glaring light of day, they seemed 
wholly indisposed to carry on any per- 
formances of dragon for our benefit. So 





we decided to take them home, and try to 
fix up for them a still smaller lakelet than 
Lagunita; one, say, in a tub! Then, per- 
haps, they would feel more at home and 
ease, and might do something for us. 

So we took them home. And we fixed 
a tub with sand in the bottom, water over 
that, and over the top of the tub a screen 
of netting that would let air and sunlight 
in, but not dragons out. Then we collected 
some miscellaneous small water-beasties 
and a few water-plants, and put them in, 
and so really had a very comfortable and 
home-like place for the dragons. They 
seemed to take to it all right; we called 
our new lakelet Monday Pond, because of 
some relation between the tub and wash- 
day, I suppose, and we had very good fun 
with our dragons for several weeks. Think 
of the advantage of having your dragon 
right at home! If it is a bad day, or we 
are lazy, or there may be visitors who stay 
too long so there is only a little time for 




ourselves, how convenient it is to have a 
dragon ¡ª or indeed a whole brood of dragons 
¡ª right in your study. Much better, of 
course, than to have to sail to a distant 
island and tramp through leagues of forest 
or thorny bushes or over burning desert 
or among spouting volcanoes to find your 
dragon, as most princes in fairy stories 
have to do. 

I can¡¯t, of course, venture to tell you of 
all the interesting things that Mary and I 
saw our dragons do. Two or three will 
have to do. Or my publisher will cry, 
¡°Cut it short; cut it short, I say.¡± And 
that will hurt me, for he is really a most 
forbearing publisher, and quite in the way 
of a friend. The three things shall be, 
one, eating, and what with; two, getting 
a new skin, and why; and third, changing 
from an under-water, crawling, squirmy, 
ugly dragon into an aerial, whizzing, flash- 
ing, dashing, beautiful-winged dragon, and 
when. Of course one of the most impor- 





tant things about any dragon is what and 
how he eats; and the other most important 
thing about Mary¡¯s and my special kind of 
dragon is his remarkable change. This 
was to us much more remarkable than hav- 
ing three heads or even getting a new head 
every time an old one is cut off, which seems 
to be rather a usual habit of fairy-book 
dragons. 

The dragons lay rather quietly on the 
sand at the bottom of Monday Pond most 
of the time. Sometimes one would be up 
a little way on the shore, that is, the side 
of the tub, or clinging to one of the plant- 
stems. When poked with a pencil, ¡ª and 
we were fearless about poking them, if the 
pencil were a long one, ¡ª they would half- 
walk, half-swim away. But mostly they 
lay pretty well concealed, waiting for some- 
thing to happen. What would happen oc- 
casionally was this: a young May-fly or a 
water-beetle would come swimming or walk- 
ing along; if it passed an inch away from 




the dragon, all right; but if its path brought 
it closer, an extraordinary ¡° catcher,¡± rather 
like a pair of long nippers or tongs, 
would shoot out like a flash from the head 
of the dragon and seize on the unfortunate 
beastie. Then the ¡° catcher¡¯ ¡¯ would fold up 
in such a way as to bring the victim against 
the dragon¡¯s mouth, which is provided with 
powerful, sharp-toothed jaws. These jaws 
then had their turn. And that was the end 
of the May-fly. 

Mary was rather shocked when she saw 
the dragon first u.sc its ¡± catcher.¡± She 
wanted to rescue the poor May-fly. But 
after all she has got pretty well used to 
seeing tragedies in insect life. They seem 
to be necessary and normal. Many insects 
depend upon other animals for food, just 
as we do. Only fortunately we don¡¯t have 
to catch and kill our own steer or pig 
or lamb or chicken. We turn the bloody 
business over to men who like ¡ª well, at 
least, who do it for us. But in the world of 





lower animals each one is usually his own 
butcher. 

Mary soon wanted to see the dragon¡¯s 
¡°catcher,¡± and so we dredged one out of 
Monday Pond, and put him on the study- 
table. As he faced us with his big eyes 
glaring from his broad heavy head, he 
looked very fierce. But curiously enough, 
he didn¡¯t seem to have any jaws; nor even 
a mouth. The whole front of his face was 
smooth and covered over by a sort of mask, 
so that his terrible jaws and catching nip- 
pers were invisible. However, we soon un- 
derstood this. The mask was the folded-up 
¡° catcher ¡± so disposed that it served, when 
not in use, actually to hide its own iniquity 
as well as that of the yawning mouth be- 
hind. Only when some small insect, all 
unsuspecting this smooth masked face, 
comes close, do the long tongs unfold, 
shoot out, and reveal the waiting jaws and 
thirsty throat. A veritable dragon indeed; 
sly and cruel and ever hungry for living prey. 




One day when we were looking into Mon- 
day Pond, Mary saw a curious object that 
looked more like a hollow dragon than any- 
thing else. It had all the shape and size 
of one of the dragons; the legs and eyes 
and masked face, the pads on the back 
that looked like half-fledged wings. But 
there was a transparency and emptiness 
about it that was uncanny and ghost-like. 
Then, too, when we looked more closely 
there was a great rent down the back. 
And that made the mystery plain. The 
real dragon, the flesh and blood and breath- 
ing live dragon, had come out of that long 
tear, leaving his skin behind! It was his 
complete skin, too, back and sides and 
belly, out to the tips of his feelers and down 
to his toes and claws. 

¡°But why should he shed his skin? 
Hasn¡¯t he any skin now?¡± asked Mary. 

¡°Of course he must have a skin. How 
could he keep his blood in, and what 
would his muscles be fastened to, for he is 




a boneless dragon, and his skeleton is his 
outside shell, with his muscles fastened to 
it? So how could he live at all without a 
skin? He must have a new skin.¡± 

And, of course, that was exactly it. He 
had cast his old skin, as a snake does, 
and had got a brand-new one. Why 
shouldn¡¯t a dragon change his skin if a 
snake can? 

But Mary is persistent about her ¡°why s,¡± 
and I was quite ready for her next ques- 
tion, which came after a moment of mus- 
ing. 

¡°Why should he shed his old skin and 
get a new one? Is the new one different; 
a different color or shape or some- 
thing?¡± 

¡°No; not a different color or different 
shape especially, but a different size. The 
dragon is growing up. He is like a boy 
who keeps on wearing age-nine clothes un- 
til they are too short in the sleeves, too 
tight in the back, and too high-water in the 




legs. Then one day he sheds his age-nine 
suit and gets an age-eleven one. See?¡± 

¡®¡®What a funny professor you are! Is 
that the way you lecture to your classes?¡± 

¡®¡®Gracious, no, Mary! This is the way: 
As the immature dragon grows older, his 
constant assimilation of food tends to 
create a natural increase in size. But the 
comparative inelasticity of his chitinized 
cuticula prevents the actual expansion, to 
any considerable degree, of his body mass. 
Thus all the cells of the body become tur- 
gid, and altogether a great pressure is 
exerted outwards against the enclosing 
cuticular wall. This wall then suddenly 
splits along the longimesial line of the 
dorsum, and through this rent the dragon 
extricates itself in soft and defenceless 
condition, but of markedly larger size. 
The new cuticula, which is pale, elastic 
and thin at first, soon becomes thicker, 
strongly chitinized and dark. The old 
cuticle, or exuvia, which has been moulted, 





is curiously complete, and is a hollow or 
shell-like replica of the external appear- 
ance of the dragon even to the finest de- 
tails. How is that, Mary?¡± 

¡°Very instruct ¡ª instructing¡± ¡ª with an 
effort ¡ª ¡°indeed,¡± replies Mary, with grave 
face. ¡°But I guess I understand the 
change from age-nine to age-eleven clothes 
better.¡± 

And then we saw the third wonderful 
happening in our dragon¡¯s life that I said 
we should tell about. We saw one of the 
dragons getting wings! That is, changing 
from an ugly, blackish, squat, crawling 
creature into a glorious long-bodied, reun- 
bow-tinted, flying dragon. Another dragon 
had crawled up above the water on a plant- 
stem and was also ¡°moulting its chitinized 
cuticula.¡± But it was coming out from 
the old skin in very different shape and 
color. I had forgotten, when I told Mary 
that they only changed in size after cast- 
ing the skin, about the last moulting. 




Each dragon casts its skin several times in 
its life, but the last time it does it, it makes 
the wonderful change I¡¯ve already spoken 
about, from crawling to fl}dng dragon. 
And it was one of these last skin-castings 
that was going on now under our very 
eyes. 

I can¡¯t describe all that happened. You 
must see it for yourself some time. How, 
out of the great rent in the old skin along 
the back, the soft damp body of the dragon 
squeezes slowly out, with its constant rev- 
elation of delicate changing color and its 
graceful new shape; how out of the odd 
shapeless pads on the back come four, long, 
narrow, shining, transparent wings, with 
complex framework of fine little veins, or 
ribs, and thin flexible glassy membrane 
stretched over them; how the new head 
looks with its enormous, sparkling, iri- 
descent eyes making nearly two-thirds of 
it and so cleverly fitted on the body that 
it can turn nearly entirely around on the 




neck. And then how the body fills out 
and takes shape, and the wings get larger 
and larger, and everything more and more 
beautifully colored! All this you will have 
to see for yourself some time when you have 
a Monday Pond in your own study, with a 
brood of dragons in. 

¡°It is wonderful, isn¡¯t it, Mary? How 
would you like to see twenty, thirty, forty, 
oh, a hundred dragons doing this all at 
once. We can if we want to. All we have 
to do is to go over to Lagunita some morn- 
ing early, very early, just a little after sun- 
rise ¡ª for that is their favorite time ¡ª and 
we shall see scores of dragons crawling up 
out of the water on stones, plants, sticks, 
anything convenient, and sloughing off 
their dirty, dark, old skins and coming 
out in their beautiful iridescent green and 
violet and purple new skins, with their 
long slender body and great flashing wings. 
They sit quietly on the stones and plant- 
stems until the warm rising sun dries them 



and their new skins get firm and all nicely 
fitted, and then they begin their new hfe, 
¡ª wheeling and dashing over the lake and 
among the hills and bushes and above the 
grasses and grain along the banks. Like 
eagles and hawks they are seeking their 
prey. Watch that little gnat buzzing there 
in the air. A flying dragon swoops by and 
there is no gnat there any longer. It has 
been caught in the curious basket-like trap 
which the dragon makes with its spiny 
legs all held together, and it is being crushed 
and chewed by the great jaws. Still a 
dragon, you see, for all of its new beauty!¡± 

Mary muses. ¡°Not all beautiful things 
in the world are good, are they?¡± she mur- 
murs. 

¡°Mary, you are a philosopher,¡± I say. 

:|e He )ie * 3ie 

As I read this over I realize quite as 
keenly, I hope, as you do, my reader, how 
little there is in this story. And yet find- 
ing out this little was real pleasure to Mary 





and me. Now we must perforce estimate 
the pleasures and pains, the likes and dis- 
likes, of other people by our own. And 
however untrue this estimate may be for any 
one other person, it must be fairly true for 
any considerable number of persons. There- 
fore ¡ª and this is the reason for putting 
down our simple experiences with the in- 
sects for other people to read and perhaps 
to be stirred by to see and do similar things 
¡ª therefore, I say, other people, some other 
people, also must be able to get pleasure 
from what we do. 

Now if there is any way and any means 
of getting clean pleasure into the crowded 
days of our living, then that way and 
means should be suggested and opened to 
as many as possible. Mary and I, you see, 
have the real proselyting spirit; we are mis- 
sionaries of the religion of the unroofed tem- 
ples. And we want all to be saved! So 
we give testimony willingly of our own ex- 
periences, and of the saving grace of our 





belief. We have no names for our idols, 
nor any formulation of our creed. But in 
various voice and word we do gladly con- 
fess over and over again the reality of the 
happiness that comes to us from our hours 
with the lowly w'orld that we are coming to 
know better and better. And any one of 
these happy hours may contain no more 
than the little that has been told in this 
story of the ¡°Dragon of Lagunita,¡± and 
yet be really and truly a happy hour. 






¡°Are you comfortable, Mary?¡¯¡¯ I ask, 
¡°and shall I begin?¡¯¡¯ 

¡°Yes; in just a mimite,¡± Mary replies; 
¡°I want to sit so that 1 can sec; both ways, 
Lagunita that way and the brown field with 
the tarantula holes that way,¡± and she 
sweeps half the horizon with a chubby 
hand. 

We are half-sitting, half-lying, in the 
shade at the base of a live-oak on a little 
knoll back of the campus, whcicce we can 
look down on the rcHl-tiled roofs and warm 
buffy walls of the Ouadrangle, and on be- 
yond to the Arboretum with its great eu- 
calyptuses sticking out above the other 
trees. We can catch glimpses of the bay, 
too, and of the white houses of the care- 



takers of the oyster-beds perched on piles 
above the water like ancient Swiss lake- 
dwellers. 

Strolling about over the brown field of 
the tarantula holes and carrying bundles 
of sticks, and stooping down now and then 
to strike at the ground with one of the 
sticks, are several young men. Sophomores 
by their hats, and one of them with a red 
jacket on; 

"Gowfin¡¯ a¡¯ the day, 

Daein¡¯ nae wark ava¡¯; 

Rinnin¡¯ aboot wi¡¯ a peck o' sticks 
Efter a wee bit ba¡¯!¡± 

Mary recites this in a pretty singsong. 

¡°Why, Mary, where did you learn that?¡± 
I ask in surprise. 

¡°From the Scotch lady that I take of.¡± 

¡°Take of! What is it you take of her? 
I hope not measles or smallpox, or ¡ª ¡± 

¡°Why no, of course not. Music. That¡¯s 
what all young ladies take.¡± 





¡°Oh, I see! It is catching, isn¡¯t it? I 
have seen some bad cases, especially in 
small towns. Every young lady, even just 
girls¡± ¡ª I glance sidewise at Mary ¡ª ¡°down 
with it. But is that what those boys over 
there are doing? I hope they won¡¯t inter- 
fere with the tarantulas. They probably 
don¡¯t know what lively times there are at 
nights in that field. Scores of big black 
tarantulas racing about, hunting, and hun- 
dreds of beetles and things racing about, 
trying to keep from being eaten. Well, 
I¡¯d better begin, because we have to get 
back by luncheon time. I have a most 
profound lecture to give on Orthogenesis 
and Heterogenesis to that unfortunate 
Evolution class at two o¡¯clock.¡± 

¡°Fm aU ready,¡± said Mary, looking up at 
me with confidence. She appreciates the 
kind of lectures I give outdoors, even if the 
lunch-gorged students don¡¯t appreciate my 
efforts ex cathedra. 

¡°Well this summer invasion that I prom- 




ised to tell you about happened when 1 
was a boy in a little town in Kansas. It 
was in Centennial year; the one-hundredth 
anniversary of the freedom of the United 
States^ and the summer of the Centennial 
Exposition at Philadelphia. 

¡°I was going down town one day in July 
to buy some meat for dinner. I was going 
because my mother had sent me. Natu- 
rally this promised to be a very uninterest- 
ing excursion. But you never can tell. 

¡°When I had got fairly down to Com- 
mercial Street, I saw that all the people 
were greatly excited. Some were talking 
loudly, but most were staring up toward 
the siin, shading their eyes with their 
hands. Then I heard old Mr. Beasley say: 
¡®That¡¯s surely them all right; doggon, 
they¡¯ll eat us up.¡¯ 

¡°My heart jumped. Who could be com- 
ing from the sun to cat us up? I burst into 
excited questions. ¡®Who are coming, Mr. 
Beasley? I can¡¯t see anybody.¡¯ 





¡°¡®Hoppers is cornin¡¯, boy; see that sort 
o¡¯ shiny thin cloud uji there jest off the 
edge o¡¯ the sun? Well, them¡¯s hoppers.¡¯ 

¡°¡®But how¡¯ll they cat us up, Mr. Beas- 
ley? No grasshopper can eat me up.¡¯ 

¡°¡®They¡¯ll cat us up with their doggoned 
terbaccy-spittin¡¯ mouths; thet¡¯s how. And 
they¡¯ll eat you up by catin¡¯ everything you 
want to eat; thet¡¯s how, too. Havin¡¯ noth- 
in¡¯ to cat is jest about the same as bein¡¯ et, 
accordin¡¯ to the way I looks at things.¡¯ 

¡°It is evident that Mr. Beasley was a 
philosopher and a pessimist; that is, a man 
who sees the disagreeable sides of things, 
who doesn¡¯t sec the silvery lining to the 
dark clouds. In fact, in this particular 
case Mr. Beasley was seeing a very dark 
lining to that silvery cloud ¡®jest off the 
edge 0¡¯ the sun.¡¯ 

¡°I stared at the thin shining cloud for a 
long time, wondering if it were really true 
that it was grasshoppers. People said the 
silvery shimmer was made by the reflec- 




tion of the sunlight from the gauzy wings 
of the hosts of flying insects. It occurred 
to me that if the hoppers were just off the 
edge of the sun, they would all be burned 
up, or at least have their wings so scorched 
that they would fall to the ground. How- 
ever, as the sun is 90,000,000 miles away 
from the earth, it would take a very long 
time for the scorched grasshoppers to fall 
all the way. I guessed that we might 
have a rain of dead and crippled hoppers 
about Christmas-time. Anyway there were 
no grasshoppers now, dead or alive, in the 
street. And I decided, rather disappoint- 
edly, that we probably shouldn¡¯t get to 
see any of the live hoppers at all. Then I 
asked Mr. Beasley where they came from. 

¡®¡°Rocky Mountains,¡¯ he answered, 
shortly. 

¡°This seemed a bit steep, for the nearest 
of the Rocky Mountains are nearly a thou- 
sand miles west of Kansas. And to think 
of grasshoppers flying a thousand miles! 



A bit too much, that was. Still I thought 
I ought to go home and tell the folks. But 
mother interrupted me in my picturesque 
tale with a dry request for the meat. Oh, 
yes. Oh ¡ª well, I had forgotten. So the 
first disagreeable result for me from the 
grasshopper invasion of Kansas in the sum- 
mer of 1876 was a painful domestic inci- 
dent. 

¡°But Mr. Beasley was right. The grass- 
hoppers had come. Next morning all the 
boys were out, each with a folded news- 
paper for flapper and a cigar-box with lid 
tacked on and a small hole just large 
enough to push a hopper through cut in 
one end. The rumor was we were to be 
paid five cents for every hundred hoppers, 
dead or alive, that we brought in. As a 
matter of fact nobody paid us, but we 
worked hard for nearly half a day; that 
is as long as it was fun and novelty. By 
noon the grasshoppers were an old story 
to us. And besides there were too many 





of them. Hundreds, thousands, millions, ¡ª 
oh, billions and trillions I suppose. And 
all eating, eating, eating! 

¡°First all the softer fresher green things. 
The vegetables in the little backyard gar- 
dens; the sweet corn and green peas and 
tomato- and jrotato-vines. Then the flow- 
ers and the grasses of the front yards. Then 
the leaves of the dooryard trees. Then the 
fresh green twigs of the trees! Then the 
bark on the younger branches!! 

¡°And you could hear them eat! Nip- 
ping and crunching, tearing and chewing. 
It got to be terrible, and everybody so 
downcast and gloomy. And the most aw- 
ful stories of what was going on out in 
the great corn-liclds and meadows and 
pastures. Ruin, ruin, ruin was what the 
hop])ers were mumbling as they chewed. 

¡°And then the reports from the other 
states in the great Mississippi Valley corn- 
belt came in by telegraph and letter. Over 
thousands and thousands of square miles 





of the great granary of the land were 
spread the hordes of hoppers. Farmers 
and stockmen were being ruined. Then 
the storekeepers and bankers that sell 
things and lend money to the farmers. 
Then the lawyers and doctors that depend 
on the farmers¡¯ troubles to earn a living. 
Then the millers and stock-brokers and 
capitalists of the great cities that make 
their fortunes out of handling and buying 
and selling the grain the farmers send in 
long trains to the centers of population. 
Everybody, the whole country, was aghast 
and appalled at the havoc of the hopper. 

¡°What to do? How long will they keep 
up this devastation? Have they come to 
settle and stay in Kansas and Nebraska 
and Iowa? What will the country do in 
the future for corn and wheat and pigs and 
fat cattle? 

¡°Well, it would be too long a story to 
tell of how all the entomologists went to 
work studying the grasshoppers and their 





ways: their outsides and insides, their 
hopping and their flying, their egg-la5dng 
and the growth and development of the 
little hoppers; how the birds, and what 
kinds, stuffed on them, and the robber- 
flies and the tachina flies and the red mites 
and the tiny braconids and chalcids at- 
tacked them and laid eggs on them, and 
their grubs burrowed into them; and every- 
thing else about them. But all the time 
the hoppers kept right on eating; at least 
they did where there was anything left to 
eat. Stories were told of their following 
roots of plants and trees down into the 
ground to eat them; of how they stripped 
great trees of bark and branches; of how 
they massed on the warm rails of railroads 
at nights and stopped trains; of how en- 
terprising towns by offering rewards to 
farmers collected and killed with kerosene 
great winrows and mounds composed of 
innumerable bushels and tons of grass- 
hoppers. 


*¡®Some people of active mind and fertile 
imagination suggested that if the grass- 
hoppers were going to eat up all our usual 
food, we should learn to eat them! And 
they got chemists to figure out how much 
proteids and carbohydrates and hydrocar- 
bons and ash, etc., there was in every little 
hopper¡¯s body. And there was a remark- 
able dinner given in St. Louis by a famous 
entomologist to some prominent men of 
that city, in which grasshoppers were served 
in several different ways: hopper sauU, 
hopper au gratin, hopper escallopp^, hopper 
souffle, and so on. The decision of the 
guests ¡ª those who lasted through the din- 
ner ¡ª was that ¡®the dry and chippy char- 
acter of the tibiae was a serious objection 
to grasshoppers as food for man.¡¯ 

¡°But you want to know the end of it 
Mary, don¡¯t you? Well, it was a very sim- 
ple end. Simply, indeed, that the hoppers 
went back! Yes, actually, when autumn 
came they all ¡ª ^that is, all that hadn¡¯t been 





eaten by birds and toads and lizards, or 
collected by farmers and burned, or hadn¡¯t 
got walked on by horses and people, or 
hadn¡¯t got studied to death by entomolo- 
gists ¡ª flew up into the air and sailed back 
lo the Rocky Mountains. Or at least they 
started that way. I never heard if any of 
them really got all the thousand of miles 
back. Ihit whereas in the summer they 
had all been flying southeast, in the fall 
they all began flying northwest. 

¡°But some of them had laid eggs in the 
ground in little cornucopia-like packets 
before dying or flying away. And much 
alarm was caused by predictions that mil- 
lions of new hoppers would come out of 
the ground in the coming spring and eat 
all the crops while young, even if the old 
ones or more like them didn¡¯t come again 
in the summer and eat the mature crops. 
But these predictions were only partly ful- 
filled. Not many hatched out in the 
spring, and those that did seemed to be 


more anxious to get back to the Rocky 
Mountains where their brethren were than 
to eat the Kansas crops. Indeed as soon 
as the young hoppers got their wings ¡ª and 
that takes several weeks after they come 
from the egg ¡ª they began flying north- 
west. 

¡°So this remarkable and terrible inva- 
sion was over. And all the poor farmers, 
and the bankrupt or about to be bankrupt 
storekeepers and bankers and the idle 
lawyers and doctors and the terrified cap- 
italists and the hard-studying entomolo- 
gists drew a long breath of relief together.¡± 

¡°But have the hoppers come back any 
time since 1876?¡± asks Mary. 

¡°No, that was the last invasion. There 
had been earlier ones, though, one or two 
of them just as bad as the Centennial-year 
one. Indeed Kansas was called the Grass- 
hopper State on account of these terrible 
summer invasions. There was a bad one 
in 1866 and another in 1874. The inva- 




sions of 1874 and 1876 cost the farmers of 
the Mississippi Valley at least fifty millions 
of dollars in crops eaten up.¡± 

¡°But what made them come to Kansas? 
Why didn¡¯t they stay in the Rocky Moun- 
tains? It¡¯s much more beautiful and in- 
teresting there than in Kansas, isn¡¯t it?¡¯¡¯ 

¡°Much, Mary. But it probably wasn¡¯t 
a matter of scenery with these tourist hop- 
pers. Much more likely a matter of food. 
In those days there were no farmers with 
irrigated fields on the great plateaus along 
the eastern base of the Rocky Mountains 
in Colorado and Wyoming. Nothing much 
but sage-brush and not overmuch of that 
grew there. And probably there simply 
wasn¡¯t enough food for all the hoppers. So 
in seasons when there were too many hop- 
pers or too little food ¡ª ^and if there was one, 
there was also the other ¡ª ^they flew up into 
the air, spread their broad wings and 
sailed away on the winds from the north- 
west for a thousand miles to Nebraska and 



Kansas and Texas. And that made an 
invasion.¡± 

¡°But, then, why didn¡¯t they stay there, 
where there were cornfields and wheat- 
fields and vegetables?¡± persisted Mary. 

¡°Mary, I can only tell you what the hard- 
studpng entomologists decided about this, 
and published along with all the other 
things they found out, or thought they 
did, in several big volumes devoted to the 
grasshoppers. They found out that the 
hoppers tried to go back because they 
couldn¡¯t stay! That is, odd as it may 
seem, either the climate or the low altitude 
or something else uncomfortable about 
Kansas and Missouri disagrees with the 
Rocky-Mountain hoppers and they can¡¯t 
live there permanently. They can¡¯t raise 
a family there successfully; at least it 
doesn¡¯t last for more than one generation. 
They have to live on the high plateaus of 
the northern Rockies, but they can get on 
very well for a single summer away from 




home. Then they must get back if they 
can. And so it was that the hoppers that 
came to Kansas solved the weighty prob- 
lem and relieved the great anxiety of the 
farmers and the whole country in general 
as to what was to become of the great grain- 
lickls of the Middle West, by going back 
home again. 

¡°And will they ever evade Kansas 
again?¡¯¡¯ 

¡°'I'liat, Mary, is not a question for a 
stick-to-what-is-known scientific person like 
me to answer. But as ever since farms 
and grain-lields and vegetable gardens have 
been established on the Rocky Mountain 
])lateaus by the farmers who kee]) moving 
west, the hoppers haven¡¯t come back to 
Kansas, and as this is jnobably because 
they have enough food at home in these 
Colorado and Wyoming fields, I should be 
very much surprised if they ever come back 
to Kansas again.¡± 

¡°Yes, but weren¡¯t you surprised that 



first time you saw them in the Sentinel 
year?¡± 

¡®¡®Mary, you are a (juibbler. Well, then. 
I¡¯ll say that I don¡¯t think they¡¯ll ever make 
another foreign invasion. There!¡± 

It is time for ns to stroll home for lunch- 
eon. As we get nj) from under the live- 
oak, a stum]))'-bodied little grasshopper 
whirs away in front of us. 

¡®¡®To think that such a little thing could 
make a summer evasion one thousand 
miles away from heng¡± said Mary. 

¡®¡®Much littler things have done much 
bigger things,¡± I rejily, with my serious 
manner of lecturer-after-luncheon. 




We were sitting in the warm sun on the 
very tip-top of Bungalow Hill. This is a 
gentle crest that rises three hundred and 
fifty feet above the campus level, and gives 
one a wonderful view far up and down the 
beautiful valley and across the blue bay to 
the lifting mountains of the Coast Range. 
Scpiare-shouldered old Mt. Diablo standing 
as giant warder just inside the Golden Gate, 
the ocean entrance to California, looms 
massive and threatening directly to our 
east, while to its south stretches the long 
brown range with its series of peaks. Mis- 
sion, Mt. Hamilton, Isabella, and so on, 
way down to the twdn Pachecos that guard 
the pass over into the de.sert. In the north 
rises Mt. Tamalpais, the wonderful fog 
mountain that looks down on the busy life 




at its feet of San Francisco, and its clus- 
tering child cities growing up rapidly these 
days, while the mother is l5dng ill of her 
wounds by earthquake and conflagration. 
To the south stretch the long orchard 
leagues of the Santa Clara Valley, with the 
little white spots of towns peeping out 
from the massed trees so jealous of every 
foot of fertile ground. And to the west ¡ª 
ah, that is the view that Mary and I lie 
hours long to look at and drink in and feel, 
¡ª "our view,¡± we call it. 

We think we see things there that other 
people cannot. We see these things es- 
pecially well when we half-close our eyes, 
and describe what we see in a sort of low, 
drowsy, monotone murmur. Then the 
fringe of towering spiry redwoods along 
the crest of the mountain range that lies 
between us and the great ocean and lifts 
its forested flanks full two thousand feet 
above xis, becomes a long row of giants¡¯ 
spears sticking up above the battlements 



of a mighty castle. And the shadow-filled 
somber slashes and tunnel-like holes of the 
dropping canons arc the great entrances 
and doors to this castle. At our feet the 
broad shallow Canada that stretches all 
along the foot of the mountains and was 
made ages ago by some tremendous earth- 
quake seems, seen through our half-closed 
eyes, to be full of water and to be really a 
broad moat shutting off all access to the 
castle. 

The giants themselves we have never 
yet seen. But some day when the light is 
just right, and they are stirring themselves 
to look out at the world, we probably shall. 
Perhaps if we had been up here that day 
not long ago when the last earthquake 
came, we should have seen the giants look- 
ing out to see who was knocking at their 
gates. For it will take an earthquake¡¯s 
knocking ever to be felt in the heart of 
that mountain castle where the giants keep 
themselves. 





The air was so clear tliis day that it 
seemed as if we could s(;e each individual 
great redwood, each red-trunked, glossy- 
leaved madrono, each thicket of crooked 
manzanita and purpling Ceanothus, on the 
whole mountain side. Straight across 
through the clear blue-tinged atmosphere 
above the Canada to the shoulders and 
canons, tli(' forests and clear spaces and 
chaparral of the mountain flanks, we look. 
And it rests our eyes that are so tired of 
reading. It is good to be a-stretch on sun- 
bathed liungalow Hill this afternoon in 
October. The rains will be coming in a 
few weeks and then we can¡¯t be out so 
much. Or at any rate wc can¡¯t lie close 
to tlie warm, brown, dry earth as we can 
now. But the rains will bring the fresh, 
green grasses and the flowers. If they 
come early enough the manzanitas will 
have on their little trembling pink-white 
lily-of-the-\'alley bells by (ihristmas-day, 
and the wild currants will be all green-and- 



rose color, with little leaves and a myriad 
fragrant blossoms. 

But Mary has found something. She 
had turned over a little flattish stone and 
under it was ¡ª life! Living things dis- 
turbed in their work, their play, their lay- 
ing up of riches, their care of their children; 
little animate creatures revealed in all the 
intimacies of their housekeeping and daily 
life. 

But they didn¡¯t lose their presence of 
mind, these active, knowing little ants, 
when the Catastrophe came. There was 
work to be done at once and wisely. First, 
the saving of the children; and so in the 
moment that passed between Mary's over- 
turning of the stone and our immediate 
shifting into comfortable position on our 
stomachs, head in hands, for watching, 
half of the racing workers had each a lit- 
tle white parcel in its jaws and was speed- 
ing with it along the galleries toward the 
underground chambers. 




¡°Ants¡¯ eggs/¡¯ said Mary. 

¡°No,¡± said I. ¡°That¡¯s a popular delu- 
sion. These little white things are not 
ants¡¯ eggs, but ants¡¯ babies. They are the 
already hatched and partly grown young 
ants, the larvae and pupae, which are so 
well looked after by the nurse ants. For 
these young ants are quite helpless, like 
young bees in the brood-cells in a honey- 
bee hive. And they have to be fed chewed 
food, and as they have no legs and so can¡¯t 
walk, they have to be carried from the cool 
dark nurseries up into the warmer lighter 
chambers for air and heat every day al- 
most, and then carried back down again. 
See how gently the nurse ant holds this 
baby in its jaws; jaws that are sharp and 
strong and that can bite fiercely and hold 
on grimly in battle.¡± 

And I hand Mary my little pocket-lens 
through which she tries to look with both 
eyes at once. She could, of course, if she 
would keep her blessed eyes far enough 




away, but as she persists in holding the 
glass at the tip of her nose as she has seen 
me do, and as she cannot shut one eye 
and keep the other open, as I can, and 
have done now so many years that I have 
wrinkles all round the shut-up eye, why, 
she makes bad work of it. So she hands 
back the lens with a polite "thank you,¡± 
and sticks to her own keen unaided eyes. 
And sees more than I do! 

For in the next breath she cries, with a 
little note of triumph in her voice: "But 
some of the ant babies are walking. See 
there! And you said they have no legs. 
I can see them; little stumpy blackish legs 
sticking out from their soft white body! 
And some of the ants are carr5dng these 
babies with legs; I can see them!¡± 

I squirm around nearer Mary. True 
enough there are some little white chubby 
creatures walking slowly around in the 
narrow runways. But I know they cannot 
be ant larvae. For ant larvae have no legs 




and simply can¡¯t walk. What are they? 
1 get out the little pocket-lens. And the 
mystery is solved. They are the ¡°ant- 
cattle,¡± the curious little mealy-bugs that 
many kinds of ants bring into their nests 
and take care of for the sake of getting 
from them a constant supply of ¡°honey- 
dew.¡± This ¡°honey-dew¡± which the mealy- 
bugs make and give off from their bodies 
is a sweetish syrupy fluid of which almost 
all ants, even those most fiercely carnivo- 
rous, arc very fond. And as the mealy- 
bugs and plant-lice that make the honey- 
dew are quite defenceless, soft-bodied, 
mostly wingless and rather sedentary in- 
sects, the bright-witted ants establish col- 
onics, or ¡°herds,¡± of them in their nests, or 
visit and protect colonics of them living on 
plants near the ant-nest. Some kinds of 
ants even build earthen ¡°sheds,¡± or tents, 
over groups of honey-dew insects on plant- 
stems. The mealy-bugs arc white because 
they cover their soft little bodies with del- 




icate threads or flakes of glistening white 
wax which they make in their bodies and 
pour out through tiny openings in the 
skin. 

We watch the busy, excited ants until 
they have carried all their babies and cat- 
tle down into the underground nursery 
chambers, out of harm¡¯s way. Then we 
put the stone carefully back in place, and 
roll back again to where we can watch the 
wonderful mountains in the west. The 
redwood-fringed crest stands so sharply out 
against the sky-line that we really can 
distinguish every tree that lifts its head 
above the crest, although they arc several 
miles away from us. These great trees, 
which are the giants¡¯ jagged spears, arc one 
hundred and fifty feet high, some of them, 
and as big around at the base as one of 
the massive columns in the Cologne 
Cathedral. 

Finally I say, rather lazily, ¡°Mary, shall 
I tell you about the special way the clever 



lyS Insect Stories 

little brown ant of the Illinois corn-fields 
takes care of its cattle?¡± 

"Yes, please, if it isn¡¯t too long,¡± says 
Mary. 

Mary and I are on perfectly frank terms. 
We are polite, but also inclined to be hon- 
est. And Mary is not going to be an un- 
resisting victim of a garrulous old professor. 
But Mary need not be afraid that I sha¡¯n¡¯t 
know when I am boring her. We have 
wireless communication, Mary and I. 
That¡¯s one, probably the principal, reason 
why we are such good companions. No 
true companionship can possibly persist 
without wireless and wordless communica- 
tion. 

¡°All right,¡± I answer, ¡°here goes, Mary. 
Say when!¡± 

¡°I forget how many millions of bushels 
of corn were raised in the state of Illinois 
last year, but they were very many. And 
that means thousands and thousands of 
acres of corn-fields. Now in all these com- 


fields there live certain tiny soft-bodied 
insects called corn-root aphids. Their food 
is the sap of the growing corn-plants which 
they suck from the roots. Although each 
corn-root aphid is only about one-twentieth 
of an inch long and one-twenty-fifth of an 
inch wide and has a sucking-beak simply 
microscopic in size, yet there are so many 
millions of these little insects all with their 
microscopic little beaks stuck into the 
corn-roots and all the time drinking, drink- 
ing the sap which is the life-blood of the 
corn-plants that they do a great deal of 
injury to the corn-fields of Illinois and 
cause a great loss in money to the farmers. 

¡°So the wise men have studied the ways 
and life of these little aphids to see if some 
way can be devised to keep them in check. 
The aphids live only two or three weeks, 
but each one before it dies gives birth to 
about twelve young aphids. Now this is 
a very rapid rate of increase. If all the 
young which are born live their allotted 




two or three weeks and produce in their 
turn twelve new aphids, we should have 
about ten trillion descendants in a year 
from a single mother aphid. Ten trillion 
corn-root aphids, tiny as they are, would 
make a strip or belt ten feet wide and two 
hundred and thirty miles long! 

¡°Some other kinds of a]:)hids multiply 
themselves even more rai)idly. An English 
naturalist has figured out that a single-stem 
mother of the common aphis, or ¡®green- 
fly¡¯ of the rose, would give origin, at its 
regular rate of multiplication and provided 
each individual born lived out its natural 
life, which is only a few days at best, to 
over thirty-three (puntrillions of rose aphids 
in a single season, ecpial in weight to more 
than a billion and a half of men. Of course 
such a thing never happens, because so 
many of the young aphids get eaten by 
lady-bird beetles and flower-fly larvae and 
other enemies before they come to be old 
enough to produce young. 




¡°However, besides this rapid increase of 
the corn-root aphids, there is something 
else that helps them to be so formidable a 
pest. And this is that they find very good 
and zealous friends in the millions of little 
brown ants that also live in the Illinois 
corn-fields. These swift, strong, brave lit- 
tle ants make their runways and nests all 
through the corn-fields, and are very de- 
voted helpers of the soft-bodied helpless 
aphids. For the aphids pay for this help 
by acting as ¡®cattle¡¯ for the ants. 

¡°This is what Professor Forbes, a very 
careful and a very honest naturalist, found 
out about the ants and the aphids. The 
eggs of the aphids, hosts of shining black, 
round, little seed-like eggs, are laid late in 
the autumn. These eggs are gathered by 
the ants and heaped up in piles in the 
galleries of their nests, or sometimes in 
special chambers made by widening the 
runways here and there. All through the 
winter these eggs are cared for by the ants, 




being carried down into the deeper and 
warmer chambers in the coldest weather, 
and brought up nearer the surface when it 
is warm. When the sunny days of spring 
begin to come, the eggs are even brought 
up above ground and scattered about in 
the sunshine, then carried down again at 
night. The little ants may be seen some- 
times turning the eggs over and over and 
carefully licking them as if to clean them 
of dust-particles. 

¡°In the late spring the aphid eggs hatch, 
and the young must have sap to drink 
right away. Their little beaks are thirsty 
for the plant-juices that are their only 
food. But there are no tender corn-roots 
ready for them in the fields because the 
corn has not yet been planted. What, then, 
shall the hungering baby aphids and their 
foster-mothers, the little brown ants, do? 

¡°This is what happens. Although it is 
too early yet for the corn to be growing, 
there are various kinds of weeds that be- 




gin to sprout with the coming on of spring, 
and two of these, especially, the smart- 
weed and the pigeon-grass, abundant and 
wide-spread in all the Mississippi Valley, 
are sure to be growing in the fields. While 
the aphids much prefer corn-roots to live 
on, they will get along very well on the 
roots of smart-weed or pigeon-grass. So 
the clever little brown ants put the almost 
helpless baby aphids on the tender roots of 
these weeds, and there their tiny beaks 
begin to be satisfied. Don¡¯t you call that 
clever, Mary?¡± 

¡°Clever! Gracious!¡± says Mary. ¡°Do 
you know Professor Forbes? Is he really 
¡ª does he always tell the¡ª¡± 

I interrupt. I am sensitive about such 
questions. I answer rather sharply. ¡°Yes, 
I do know him; and yes, he always tells 
the truth. Don¡¯t interrupt any more, 
please, for there is still more of the story.¡± 
Mary is silent. 

¡°Well, the aphids stay on the smart- 




weed roots until the corn is planted, which 
is in about ten days, and the kernels begin 
to germinate and to send down the tender 
juice-filled roots. And then the little 
brown ants take the aphids, now getting 
larger and stronger, of course, but still too 
helpless or stupid to do much for them- 
selves except to suck sap, and carry them 
from the smart-weed roots to the corn- 
roots ¡ª What¡¯s that, Mary?¡± 

But Mary had said nothing; just drawn 
in her breath with a little sound. Still I 
think it best to remind her that I do know 
Professor Forbes and that he really does 
always tell the truth. In fact, I quote to 
Mary this honest professor¡¯s exact words 
about this transfer of the aphids from the 
weed-roots to the corn-roots. This is what 
he writes in his intensely interesting ac- 
count of the whole life of these little in- 
sects; ¡°In many cases in the field, we 
have found the young root aphis on sprout- 
ing weeds (especially pigeon-grass) which 




have been sought out by the ants before 
the leaves had shown above the ground; 
and, similarly, when the field is planted to 
com, these ardent explorers will frequently 
discover the sprouting kernel in the earth, 
and mine along the starting stem and place 
the plant aphids upon it.¡± 

¡°And the little brown ants do all this 
so as to get honey-dew from the aphids?¡± 
asks Mary. 

¡°Exactly,¡± I reply. ¡°The ants take 
such good care of the aphids not because 
they pity their helplessness or just want 
to be good, but because they know, by 
some instinct or reason, that these are the 
insects that, when they grow up, make 
honey-dew, which is the kind of food that 
ants seem to like better than any other. 
Indeed not only the little brown ants alone 
take care of the corn-root aphids to get 
honey-dew, but at least six other kinds of 
ants that live in the Illinois corn-fields do 
it. But the little brown ants are the most 





abundant and seem to give the aphids the 
best care.¡± 

¡°It is exactly like keeping cows, isn¡¯t 
it,¡± says Mary. ¡°But they don¡¯t have to 
milk them.¡± 

¡°Well,¡± I reply, ¡°I don¡¯t know what 
you would call it, but some other ants that 
take care of some other kinds of honey- 
dew insects seem to have to carry on a 
sort of milking performance to make them 
pour out their sweet liquid. The ants have 
to pat or rub them with their hairy little 
feelers; sort of tickle them to get them to 
squeeze out a little drop of honey-dew. 
The truth is, Mary, if I should tell you the 
really amazing things that ants do, you 
simply wouldn¡¯t believe me at all. But 
the next time we go out. I¡¯ll take you to 
see for yourself an ant community right 
on the campus that does some remarkable 
things. I¡¯d much rather have you see the 
things yourself than tell you about them.¡± 

¡°I¡¯d rather, too,¡± says Mary, which isn¡¯t 






exactly the nicest thing she could say, but 
I know what she means. It¡¯s that seeing 
is better than being told by anybody. 

And then the up-and-down ¡° ding, dang, 
dong, ding,¡± of the clock-bells begins its 
little song in four verses that means the 
end of an hour. And then come the six 
slow deep calls of the biggest bell that tell 
what hour it is. It is the hour for us to 
go home. 










¡°But why didn¡¯t he go back if he liked 
France so much better; and if he had 
plenty of money?¡¯¡¯ asked Mary. 

¡°Ah, well, even having plenty of money 
doesn¡¯t always make it possible to do just 
what we prefer,¡¯¡¯ I say. ¡°The truth is, ¡ª 
if it is the truth, and not just malicious 
gossip, ¡ª ^it was exactly because he had 
plenty of money that he couldn¡¯t go back. 
He is supposed to have got that money in 
some wrong way. Anyway, he didn¡¯t seem 
to care to go back to la belle France, but 
preferred to live solitarily here, and to 
plant Hnes of trees and lay out little lakes 
and build rockwork towers and make ter- 
races and driveways and paths, all in very 
formal lines, as in the parks at Versailles 






and St. Cloud, which were the playgrounds 
of French kings and the pride of all France.¡± 

Mary and I were seated on a curious 
little cement-and-stonc imitation tower- 
ruin that stuck up out of Frenchman¡¯s 
Pond, which is near the campus, and is a 
good place for seeing things and getting 
away from the classroom bells. A long 
row of scraggly Lombardy poplars stretches 
away from the pond along an old terraced 
roadway with a cave opening on it . Around 
two sides of the little lake is a rockwork 
wall, and across one end, where the pond 
narrows, is a picturesque stone bridge of 
single span. Everything is neglected, and 
altogether Frenchman¡¯s Pond and its sur- 
roundings are a good imitation of some- 
thing old and foreign in this glaringly new 
and extremely Californian bit of the world. 
It is a favorite place for us to come when 
I want to tell Mary stories of the castles 
on the Rhine. We get a proper atmos- 
phere. 




It was so sunny and warm tliis morning 
that we had given up chatting and were 
simply sitting or sprawling as comfortably 
as we could on the irregular top of our Aus- 
sichtsthurm. A few fl3dng dragons, some 
in bronze-red mail, some in greenish blue, 
were wheeling about over the pond, and a 
meadow-lark kept up a most cheerful sing- 
ing in the pasture nearby. It was really 
just the sort of day and place and feeling 
that Mary and I like best. We knew we 
ought, as persevering Nature students, to 
get down and poke around in the weeds 
and ooze of the edges of the pond so as to 
see things. But we didn¡¯t want to do it, 
and so we didn¡¯t. That is one perfectly 
beautiful thing about the way Mary and I 
study Nature. We don¡¯t when we don¡¯t 
want to. 

But if we didn¡¯t climb down to the live 
things this day at Frenchman¡¯s Pond, they 
came up to us. One of the flying dragons 
actually swooped so close to our heads that 



we could hear its shining brittle wings 
crackle, and only a few minutes after, a 
curious delicate little creature' with four 
gauzy wings, a pair of projecting eyes with 
a fixed stare, and three long hair-like tails 
on its body, lit on Mary¡¯s hand and walked 
slowly and rather totteringly up her bare 
wrist and fore arm. Then without any 
fluttering or struggling, it slowly fell over 
on one side and lay quite still. It was 
dead! 

This rather took our breath away. We 
are only too well accustomed, unfortu- 
nately, to seeing death come to our little 
companions; they do not live long, at best, 
and then so many of them get killed and 
eaten. But they usually make some pro- 
test when Death approaches. They do not 
surrender their brief joy of living in such 
utterly unresisting way as this little crea- 
ture did. But when I had got my spec- 
tacles properly adjusted, I saw what it was 
that had died so quietly and suddenly. 





The little gauzy-winged creature was a 
May-fly, or ephemera, and life with the 
May-flies is such a truly ephemeral thing, 
and death comes regularly so soon and so 
swiftly, and without any apparent illness 
or injury intervening between health and 
dissolution, that we naturalists have ceased 
to wonder at it. Although this is not be- 
cause we understand it at all. Far from 
it. Indeed the death of any creature, ex- 
cept from obvious accident or wasting ill- 
ness, is one of the mysteries of life. Which 
sounds rather Irish, but is just what I 
mean. 

But Mary was looking thoughtfully at 
this dead little May-fly in her hand. It was 
so soft and delicate of body, had such frail 
and filmy wings, that it seemed that it 
must have been very ill-fitted to cope with 
the hard conditions of insect living, to 
escape the numerous insect-feeding crea- 
tures and to find food and shelter for it- 
self, to be successful, in a word, in the 




"struggle for existence¡±! And in a way, 
this is quite true. But, in another way, 
it is not true. For the May-flies, in their 
flying stage, make up for their frailness 
and feebleness, their inability to feed ¡ª 
they have really no mouth-parts and do 
not eat at all in their few hours or days of 
flying life ¡ª by existing in enormous num- 
bers, and millions may be killed, or may 
die from very feebleness, and yet there are 
enough left to lay the eggs necessary for a 
new generation, and that is success in life 
for them. Nothing else is necessary; their 
whole aim and achievement in life seems 
to be to lay eggs and start a new genera- 
tion of May-flies. 

I settled back into a still more comfort- 
able position and said: "Did I ever tell 
you, Mary, of the May-flies¡¯ dance of death 
I saw in Lucerne once, not far from the old 
bridge across the Reuss with its famous 
pictures of our own dance of death? Well, 
then, we¡¯ll just about have time before the 






tower-clock calls us home. Do you want 
to hear about it?¡± 

¡°Yes, please,¡± said Mary. 

¡°Well, I had been studying in a great 
university in an old German town all the 
spring and early summer and had come to 
Switzerland for my vacation. You know 
there are splendid mountains there ¡ª ¡± 

¡°The Alps,¡± interrupted Mary. ¡°The 
highest is Mt. Blanc, 15,730 feet above the 
sea.¡± 

How Mary does know her geog- 
raphy! 

¡® ¡®And beautiful lakes,¡± I continue. ¡® ¡®And 
the roads are good for tramping, and the 
hotels cheap. Anyway, the ones the stu- 
dents go to. I had come to Lucerne from 
Zurich¡ª¡± 

¡°Noted for its silks and university where 
women can go,¡± Mary broke in again. 

Bless me, what¡¯s the use of going to 
Europe anyway, if you learn ever3rthing 
about everywhere in the grades? 




¡°And had gone straight to the Muhlen- 
hrucke,¡± I go on, ¡ª ¡°that¡¯s the old bridge 
all covered with a roof that crosses the 
Reuss only a few rods from where it flows 
out of the lake; the lake of Lucerne, you 
know.¡± 

¡°Of course,¡± said Mary. 

¡°For it is on the ceiling of that bridge,¡± 
I persist, ¡°that these curious old Dance of 
Death pictures are painted, and I had 
heard a great deal about them. They show 
how everybody is dancing through life to 
his grave. Not very pleasant pictures, 
Mary.¡± 

¡°Very unpleasant, I should think,¡± says 
Mary, positively. ¡°I hope you didn¡¯t 
look at them long.¡± 

¡°No, because, for one reason, it was get- 
ting too dark to see them. The sun had 
set behind the Gutsch ¡ª that¡¯s a pretty hill 
just west of Lucerne ¡ª and the electric 
lights were already flashing along the lake- 
shore promenade. You know what a won- 




derfully beautiful lake Lucerne is, of course, 
Mary?¡± 

¡°Yes; it is unsurpassed in Switzerland, 
perhaps in Europe, for magnificence of 
scenery,¡± replies Mary, in level voice. 

I resolve to cut geographic informa- 
tion out of any further stories I tell Mary. 
Do they commit Baedeker to memory 
nowadays in the schools? 

¡°Exactly,¡± I manage to reply without 
betraying too much astonishment at this 
revelation of the American educational 
method. 

¡°Well, along the shore of this unsur- 
passed lake at the town of Lucerne there 
is a broad promenade with trees and 
benches and electric lights. Behind it 
are the big hotels all in a curving row, and 
after dinner all the people come out and 
stroll about while the band plays. It is a 
fine sight.¡± 

Mary seemed to be getting a little less 
than interested. She squirmed into a new 





position on the rough rockwork and then, 
looking out over the little pond with its 
hawking dragons whizzing back and forth, 
she asked: ¡°What about the May-flies, 
please?¡± 

I really believe she knew all about the 
hotels and promenade and the band. 
What wonderful schools! 

¡°I was coming ¡ª I have just come to 
them,¡± I reply with dignity. 

I am a professor and have a certain 
stock supply of dignity to draw on when 
necessary. It isn¡¯t often necessary with 
Mary. 

¡°Well, as I came from the covered Miih- 
lenbrucke and out on to the lake-shore 
promenade, I saw a little crowd of people 
gathered under and about a brilliant arc- 
light hanging in an open place in front of 
the great Schweizerhof Hotel. The light 
seemed to me curiously hazy, and even 
before I got near the crowd I had made a 
guess at what was going on. My guess 




that it was a May-fly dance of death was 
quite right. Perhaps it would really be 
better to call it a ¡®dance of life,¡¯ for it 
really was sort of a great wedding dance. 
But it was a dance of death, too, for the 
dancers were falling dead or dying out of 
the dizzying whirly circles by thousands. 
How many hundreds or thousands or mil- 
lions of May-flies there were in the dense 
circling cloud about the light, I have no 
idea. But the air for twenty feet every 
way from the light was full of them, and 
the ground for a circle of thirty or forty 
feet underneath was not merely covered 
with the delicate dead creatures, but was 
covered for from one to two inches deep! 

¡°The crowd of promcnaders looked on 
in gaping wonder. Not one seemed to 
know what kind of creature this was, nor 
of course anything about what was really 
going on; that this was all of the few hours 
of feverish life which these May-flies en- 
joyed in their winged state, and that they 





gave it all up to the business of mating 
and egg-la5nng; where they came from, 
how they had lived before, why they 
should be here to-night and no other in 
the whole year, all these things which it 
seems to me the onlookers ought to have 
wanted to know, nobody seemed to know, 
nor anybody seemed particularly to care 
to. 

¡°But there are places in the world where 
the people do want to know these things, 
and a great many more, about the May- 
flies. One such place is the Thousand 
Islands in the St. Lawrence River. One 
day I was sailing down this river among 
the Thousand Islands, and the acquaint- 
anceship of a small and unusually dehcate 
kind of May-fly was forced on me by the 
hundreds of them that persisted in alight- 
ing on my clothes, my hat, and my hair. 
They kept walking unsteadily about over 
my face and hands and the open pages of 
the book I was trying to read. And they 




kept dying, dying, all around. One would 
light on the outer edge of the page, and 
before it had walked across to the begin- 
ning of a sentence, it would die and its 
body would slide gently down into the 
back of the book and ¡ª be a book- 
marker!¡± 

¡°That¡¯s not a very nice way to talk 
about the poor little dead May-flics,¡± said 
Mary, rather seriously. 

¡°It isn¡¯t, Mary, I know,¡± said I. ¡°But 
we¡¯ve got to relieve the gloom of this tale 
someway, don¡¯t you think? There is too 
much wholesale death in it to suit my pub- 
lisher! And so I am trying to introduce 
a little jocularity into it, don¡¯t you see, 
Mary?¡± 

¡°People are not supposed to be very 
funny at funerals,¡± said Mary, severely. 
¡°Where did the little Thousand Islands 
May-flies come from, and why do the people 
there want to know about them?¡± 

¡°Because there are so many May-flies 



that they are a great pest. Not by eating 
crops ¡ª for there aren¡¯t any, I suppose, and 
the May-flies don¡¯t eat anything an5rway ¡ª 
nor by carrying malaria, but just by living 
and dying all over; everywhere in one¡¯s 
summer cottage, down on the river-bank 
where you are watching the sunset, under 
the trees when you are lying in your ham- 
mock and trying to read, in your rowboat 
when you are paddling about to visit your 
neighbors on other islands. To be walked 
on and died on by hundreds and hundreds 
of little flies, and all the time, grows to be 
very uncomfortable. So the May-flies or 
river-flies or lake-flies as they are variously 
called are cordially hated by all the Thou- 
sand-Islanders and the St. Lawrence- 
Riverers. And the people want to know 
about where they come from, and how they 
live, and all about them, indeed, so as to 
try to find some way to be rid of 
them.¡± 

¡°And do you know where they come 





from, and how they live, and all about 
them,¡± asks Mary, with a slightly roguish 
manner, I fear. 

¡°Well, I know something. In the first 
place, after the dance of death, the few 
that don¡¯t die fly out over the lake or 
river or pond and drop a lot of little eggs 
into it. Then they die happy ¡ª if May- 
flies can be happy. Mind you, I don¡¯t say 
they can. We are the only animals that 
we know can be happy. And we mostly 
aren¡¯t. From the eggs hatch young May- 
flies without wings or long thread-like tails, 
but just little, flat, under- water creatures 
with gills along the sides so they can 
breathe without coming up to the surface. 
Some kinds burrow into the mud at the 
bottom, some kinds make little tubes or 
cases in which to live, while others stay 
mostly on the under side of stones. They 
eat little water-plants or broken-up stuff 
they find in the water, although some eat 
other little live animals, even other young 





May-flies. And many of them get eaten 
themselves. They are favorite food of the 
under- water dragons. Y ou remember, don¡¯t 
you, Mary, how our dragons of Lagunita 
would snap up the young May-flies in 
Monday Pond? 

¡°Well, these young May-flies ¡ª the ones 
that don¡¯t get eaten by dragons, stone- 
flies, water-tigers, and other May-flies ¡ª 
grow larger slowly, and wing-pads begin 
to grow on their backs. In a year, maybe, 
or two years for some kinds, they are 
ready for their great change. And this 
comes very suddenly. Some late after- 
noon or early evening thousands of young 
May-flies of the same kind, living in the 
same lake or river, swim up to the surface 
of the water, and, after resting there a few 
moments, suddenly split their skin along 
the back of the head and perhaps a little 
way farther along the back, and like a 
flash squirm out of this old skin, spread 
out their gauzy wings and fly away. They 




do this so quickly that your eye can hardly 
follow the performance.¡± 

¡°And then they all fly to the light and 
begin their dance of death,¡± breaks in 
Mary. 

¡°No, wait; they are not yet quite ready 
for that. First, they do a very unusual 
thing; something that no other kinds of 
insects have ever been seen to do. This 
is it: They fly away to a plant or bush or 
tree at the water¡¯s edge, and there they 
cling for a little while and then cast their 
skin again.¡± 

¡°The new skin they have just got, with 
the wings and everything?¡± asks Mary. 

¡°Exactly; the new skin. It comes ofl 
of the wings, off of the long tails and the 
short feelers, and all the rest of the body. 
No other kind of insect but the May-fly 
casts its skin once its wings are outspread. 
But now the May-fly is ready for its dizzy 
dance. And as it has only a few hours to 
do it in, it usually starts as soon as there 




are any lights to dance about. Think of 
it, to come up from under the water, get 
your wings and be a real May-fly, not just 
a crawling thing on the bottom of a pond, 
and have only one evening to live in! Prob- 
ably to dance the whole evening through is 
about the best thing to do under such cir- 
cumstances.¡± 

¡°Don¡¯t any of the poor May-flies live for 
more than one evening?¡± asks Mary. ¡° It 
does seem a shame to put in so long a time, 
one year, two years for some, getting ready 
to fly and then have only one evening or 
night for flying.¡± 

¡°Well, yes, some do, Mary. That is, 
there are many different kinds of May- 
flies; some large ones, some small ones, 
some kinds with four wings, some kinds 
with only two, and the length of the 
fl3dng time is not the same for all these 
kinds. Some live a day, some two, some 
perhaps even three or four. But there are 
several kinds whose flying life is just a few 





hours; they are born, that is, as flying 
creatures, after sundown and they die be- 
fore the next sunrise. The first kind of 
May-fly whose life was ever carefully stud- 
ied ¡ª this was nearly two hundred and fifty 
years ago, by a famous naturalist of Hol- 
land ¡ª lives only five hours after it comes 
from the water. But remember what a 
fine long time they have being young! If 
we could be young ¡ª but there, that¡¯s fool- 
ish. Mary, the chimes in the tower-clock 
are sounding. Listen!¡± 

And we sit perfectly still and hear the 
beautiful Haydn changes on the four bells, 
and then count twelve clear strokes of the 
big clock-bell that come all the way from 
the Quadrangle to us, softened and mel- 
lowed by the distance. We must go home 
to luncheon. And after luncheon I must 
go and lecture ¡ª Ugh! How sad! ¡ª sad for 
the students and sad for me. But that¡¯s 
the way we do it, and until we find the real 
way, we must all continue to suffer together. 




¡°Come, Mary, we¡¯re off. How would 
you like to be a May-fly?¡¯¡¯ 

¡°And have only one day to live when 
I¡¯m all grown up?¡¯¡¯ 

¡°You might be saved some troubles, 
Mary.¡± 





Fuzzy was distinguished from most of 
her brothers and sisters, when we first be- 
came acquainted with her, by the fine 
head of hair which she had. It has been 
several weeks now since we first saw her, 
and there are bald places already ¡ª so stren- 
uous has been her life. To be sure that we 
should be able to recognize her even after 
she became worn and bald, like the others, 
we dabbed a spot of white paint on her 
back between the shoulders, and although 
old age and its attendant ills, including 
the loss of much of her hair, have come on 
rapidly, the white spot is still there, and 
we know Fuzzy whenever we see her. 

We were watching what was going on in 
Fuzzy¡¯s glass house at the very time that 


Fuzzy first came out of her six-sided little 
private nursery room. In this she had 
spent all of her three weeks of getting 
hatched from an egg ¡ª we had seen her 
own very egg laid by the queen mother! 
¡ª then of living as a helpless baby bee 
without wings or feet or eyes or feelers, 
and having to be fed bee- jelly and bee- 
bread by the nurses, and then as a slowly 
maturing young bee with legs and wings 
and eyes and feelers all forming and grow- 
ing. Part of this time she had been shut 
up in her room by having the door sealed 
with wax, and she had had no food at all. 
But she had been fed enough at first to 
last her through the days when she had no 
food. 

It was the twentieth or twenty-first day 
since she had been born, that is, had 
hatched from the little, long, white, seed- 
like egg that the queen bee had laid in this 
six-sided waxen room or cell. And Fuzzy 
was all ready to come out into the world. 







So she tried her strong new trowel-like 
jaws on the thin waxen door of her room, 
and found no trouble at all in biting a hole 
through it large enough to let her wriggle 
out. Which she did right under our very 
eyes. 

Indeed we had planned Fuzzy¡¯s glass 
house and had had it built in the way you 
see it in Sekko¡¯s picture just so we could 
see plainly and certainly what goes on in 
the house of a bee family. Everybody has 
watched bees outside gather pollen and 
drink nectar and hang in great swarms, 
and do the various other things they do 
in their outdoor life. But not everybody 
has seen what goes on indoors. Many peo- 
ple have seen the inside of a hive every 
now and then. But it is always when the 
bees are greatly excited and often when 
the people are too. And so besides seeing 
that the honey and pollen are in such and 
such combs and cells and the young bees 
in others, some of them in open and some 




in closed cells, and perhaps a few other 
things, one doesn¡¯t learn much by peering 
into a hive through a mass of smoke-dazed 
bees while dodging a few extra-lively and 
energetic ones! 

Mary and I had watched bees outside 
and we had looked into lots of hives and, 
of course, had learned a little about indoor 
bee ways. But ever since we got Fuzzy¡¯s 
glass-sided house built and a community 
of pretty amber-bodied gentle Italians liv- 
ing in it, we have never got over being 
sorry for ourselves in the old days and 
sorry for other people all the time. For 
it is so easy and sure, so vastly entertain- 
ing and utterly fascinating to sit quietly 
and comfortably in chairs (one of us on 
each side) for hours together and see all 
the many things that go on in the bee¡¯s 
house. The bees are not disturbed in the 
sliglitest by our having the black cloth 
jacket off of the hive and by the light shin- 
ing in through the great window-like sides 




of the house, nor by Mary¡¯s bright eyes and 
my round spectacles staring ever so hard 
at them. 

We have seen the queen lay her eggs, 
the little bees hatch out, the nurse bees 
feed them, the foragers come in and dance 
their whirling dervish dance and unload 
their baskets of pollen and sacs of honey, 
the wax-makers hang in heavy festoons and 
make wax, the carrying bees carry the wax 
to the comb-builders, and the comb-builders 
build comb of it, the house-cleaners and the 
ventilators clean house and ventilate, and 
the guards stopping intruders at the door. 
We have heard the piping of the new 
queens in their big thimble-like cells, and 
seen them come out, and the terrible ex- 
citement and sometimes awful tragedy 
that follows; we have seen the wild ecstasy 
that comes before swarming out, and the 
swarming itself begin in the house; we 
have looked in at night and found some of 
the bees resting, but others working, and 





always some on guard; we have seen the 
lazy drones loaf all the morning and then 
swing out on their midday flight and come 
back and fall to drinking honey again; we 
have seen a great battle when our gentle 
Italians fought like demons and repulsed 
a fierce attack of foraging black Germans, 
and again a nomad band of yellow-jackets; 
and we have seen the provident workers 
kill the drones and even drag young worker 
bees from their cells when the first cold 
weather comes on. We have seen, in truth, 
a very great deal of all the wonderful life 
that these wise and versatile little crea- 
tures live in their nearly perfect coopera- 
tive community. But above all we have 
followed with special interest and affec- 
tionate pride the education and experi- 
ences of Fuzzy, our most particular friend 
in all the thousands of our gentle Italian 
family. 

Fuzzy must have been very glad to get 
out finally from her tight, dark, little cell 




and into the airy, light hive, with all of her 
sisters and brothers moving around so lively 
and busily. And she must have been es- 
pecially delighted when she went to the 
open door of the house for a peek out ¡ª 
for she wasn¡¯t allowed really to go out- 
doors for exactly eight days ¡ª and saw the 
beautiful arcades of the outer Quadrangle 
underneath her and the red-tiled roof on a 
level with her, and then the great eucalyp- 
tus trees and the beautiful live-oaks in the 
field beyond, and far off on the horizon 
the crest of the distant mountains, with 
the giant redwoods standing up against 
the sky-line. You have a glimpse in 
Sekko¡¯s picture of all this that Fuzzy saw 
that day. That is, if she could see so 
much. I am afraid she couldn¡¯t. 

¡°But what are those other bees doing 
to her,¡± cried Mary in some alarm, as two 
or three workers crowded around Fuzzy 
just as she came from her cell. ¡°Are they 
trying to bite her?¡± 





¡°Not the least in the world,¡± I hasten 
to answer reassuringly. ¡°Just look sharp 
and you will see.¡± And Mary did look 
sharp and did sec. And she clapped her 
hands with glee. ¡°Why, they are licking 
her with their long tongues; cleaning her, 
just as a cat docs her little kittens,¡± sang 
Mary. Which was exactly so. For a bee 
just out from its nursery cell is a very 
mussed-up looking, and, I expect, rather 
dirty little creature. And it needs clean- 
ing. 

It was soon after Fuzzy had got cleaned 
and had her hair brushed and had begun 
to wander around in an aimless way in the 
glass-sided house that we got hold of her 
and dabbed the spot of white paint on her 
back. We did it this way. She had 
walked up to just under the roof of the 
house near where you sec (in Sekko¡¯s pic- 
ture) one of the cork-stoppers sticking up 
like a little chimney-pot. These corks 
stop up two round holes in the roof which 




we had made for the express purpose of 
putting things, ¡ª other insects, say, ¡ª into 
the hive to see what the bees would do 
with them, and also to take out a bee when 
we wanted to experiment with it. When 
Fuzzy got up just under one of the holes, 
we took the cork-stopper out gently and 
thus let her come walking slowly up and 
out on top of the roof. Then we caught 
and held her very gently with a pair of 
flat-bladed tweezers, and put the white 
paint on. Then we dropped her back 
through the hole and put the cork in its 
hole. 

We watched Fuzzy for a long time after 
she came out of her cell that day, and al- 
though she walked about a great deal, she 
only once ventured near the real door or 
entrance-slit of the hive through which 
the foraging bees were constantly coming 
and going. And next day we watched 
many hours and looked often between 
regular watching times, always finding 





Fuzzy in the house. And so for eight 
days. And then she made her first ex- 
cursion outside. 

It was interesting to watch her on this 
eighth day. She would fly a little way 
out, then turn around and come in. Then 
she would fly out farther, turn around, 
hover a little in front of the window, and 
finally come in again. A lot of other 
young bees were doing the same thing. 
They seemed to be getting acquainted 
with things around the door of the house 
so they would know how to find it when 
they came back from a long trip. On the 
ninth day Fuzzy brought in her first loads 
of pollen, two great masses of dull rose- 
red pollen held securely in the pollen- 
baskets on her hind legs. And after that 
she brought many other loads of pollen 
and later sacs of honey. 

But you must not imagine that Fuzzy 
was idle during all those eight days before 
she went outside of the glass house. Not 



a bit of it. No bees are idle. But yes, 
the drones. Big, blunt-bodied, hairy, 
blundersome creatures that move slowly 
about over the combs. Not over the 
nursery combs where there is work to be 
done, feeding and caring for the young 
bees. Dear me, no. But over the pantry 
combs. They keep close to the honey- 
pots and bread-] ars. But even they have 
their work. Each day from spring into 
late summer they all, or nearly all, fly out 
about eleven o¡¯clock and circle and trav- 
erse the air for long di.stances in search 
of queens. Then in the early afternoon 
they come back and fall to sipping honey 
again. 

However, to return to Fuzzy and her 
work in those first eight days spent all 
inside the house. One day Mary saw 
Fuzzy stretching her head down into one 
open cell after another in the brood-comb. 
At the bottom of each of these cells was a 
little white grub; a very young bee, of 





course, only one or two or three or four 
days out from the egg. Several days be- 
fore (it takes only three days for a bee¡¯s 
egg to hatch) we had seen the beautiful 
long slender-bodied queen moving slowly 
about over these cells, with her little circle 
of attendants all moving with her with 
their heads always facing toward her. 
She would thrust her long hind body down 
into one of these empty cells and stand 
there (juietly for two or three minutes. 
Then draw her body out and go on to 
another. And in the cell she had just left 
we could see plainly a tiny seed-like white 
speck stuck to the bottom of the cell. It 
was an egg of course. That is nearly all 
the queen does; she simply goes about all 
through the spring and summer laying 
eggs, one at a time, in the nursery or brood- 
cells. There is one other thing she does, 
or really several things, at the time of the 
appearance or the birth of a new queen. 
But that will come later. 




We do seem to have trouble keeping to 
Fuzzy and her life, don¡¯t we? Well, when 
Mary saw Fuzzy sticking her head down 
into the cells with the bee-grubs in, she 
knew at once what Fuzzy was doing. For 
it was plain that the young bees had to 
have something to eat and it was plain, 
too, that they couldn¡¯t get it for them- 
selves, for they have no legs, and can¡¯t 
even crawl out of their cells. Fuzzy was 
feeding them. She would drink a lot of 
honey from a honey-cell, and cat a lot of 
pollen from a pollen-filled cell, and then 
make in her mouth or front stomach (for 
bees have two stomachs, one in front of 
the other), or in certain glands in her head 
(it doesn¡¯t seem to be exactly known 
which), a very rich sort of food called bee- 
jelly. Then she sticks the tip of her long 
tongue into the mouth of the helpless, 
soft-bodied little white bee-grub and pours 
the food into it. After the bee-grub is 
two or three days old, the nurse bees ¡ª 




and that is what Fuzzy could be called 
now ¡ª feed the babies some honey and 
pollen in addition to this made-up bee- 
jelly, unless the baby is to be a queen bee, 
and then it gets only the rich bee-jelly all 
the time. 

Mary thought Fuzzy should have a neat 
cap and white apron on and drew a clever 
little picture of Fuzzy as a nurse. But we 
arc being very careful in this book not to 
fool anybody, and if we should print the 
picture Mary drew, some people would be 
stupid enough to think that we meant 
them to believe that the nurse bees wear 
uniforms! We say right now that they 
don¡¯t, and that you can¡¯t tell them from 
the other bees except that most of them 
are the younger or newly issued bees and 
hence haven¡¯t lost any of their hair, and so 
look ¡°fuzzier¡± than the other bees in the 
hive. For just as with Fuzzy, so with the 
other younger bees; they stay in the hive 
for a week or more and act as nurses. 



When they once are allowed to go out, 
and begin bringing in pollen and honey, 
however, then the new bees are ready to 
do any of the many other things that have 
to be done inside the hive. One day Mary 
saw Fuzzy standing quite still on the floor 
of the house, with her head pointed away 
from the door and held rather low, while 
her body was tilted up at an angle. She 
just stood there immovable and apparently 
doing nothing at all. Suddenly Mary 
called out: ¡°Why, what has happened to 
Fuzzy.? Her wings are gone!¡¯¡¯ I hurried 
to look. And it did seem, for a minute, 
as if Mary were right. Which would have 
been a most surprising and also a most 
terrible thing. But my eyes seemed to 
see a sort of blur or haze just over Fuzzy¡¯s 
back, and I bade Mary look close at this 
blur with her sharp eyes. And Mary 
solved the mystery. 

¡°She is fanning her wings so fast that 
you can¡¯t see them,¡¯¡¯ cried Mary. ¡°And 



here is another bee about two inches in 
front of Fuzzy doing the same thing; and 
another,¡± called out Mary, who was greatly 
excited. And it rather did seem as if these 
bees had gone crazy, or were having a very 
strange game, or something. Until I made 
Mary remember what would happen to us 
if not just three or four or five or six of us, 
but many thousand ¡ª indeed in Fuzzy¡¯s 
house there are more than ten thousand ¡ª 
were shut up in one house with but a 
single small opening to let fresh air in and 
bad air out. For bees breathe just as we 
do, that is, take fresh air into their bodies 
and give out poisonous air. And then 
Mary understood. Fuzzy and the other 
bees fanning their wings so fast and stead- 
ily were ventilating the house! They were 
making air-currents that would carry the 
poisonous air, laden with carbonic-acid 
gas, out of the door, and then fresh air 
would come in to replace it. 

And another time Fuzzy kept Mary 



guessing a little while about what she was 
doing. We had looked all through the 
crowds of nurses and wax-makers and 
comb-builders and house-cleaners without 
finding Fuzzy. And we decided she was 
out on a foraging trip, when Mary caught 
sight of our white-spotted chum loafing 
about in the little glass-covered runway 
that leads from the outer opening into the 
house proper, a sort of little glass-roofed 
entry we have arranged so that we can see 
the foragers as they alight and come in, and 
the various otlier things that go on by the 
door. Fuzzy seemed to be loafing, but 
both Mary and I have seen so much of the 
feverish activity and the constant work of 
bees in the hive, and out of it for that mat- 
ter, that we never expect to find a worker 
honey-bee really loafing. They literally 
work themselves to death, dying some- 
times at the very door of the hive, with the 
heavy baskets of pollen on their thighs, 
the gathering and carrying of which has 




been the killing of them. Only the bees 
that over-winter in the hive must have 
some sj)are moments on their hands. And 
here in California even these are few, for 
a certain amount of foraging goes on prac- 
tically all the year round. 

But Fuzzy did seem to be loafing there 
in the entry. Until Mary¡¯s sharp eyes 
discovered her important business. She 
was one of the warders at the gate, a guard 
or sentinel told off, with one or two others, 
to test each arrival at the entrance. As a 
forager would alight and start to walk in 
through the entry. Fuzzy would trot up 
to it and feel it with her sensitive antennae. 
If the newcomer were a member of the 
community, all right; it was passed in. 
But if not, ¡ª if it were one of the vicious 
black Germans from the other observation 
hive that stands close by, opening out of 
the same window indeed, ¡ª there would be 
an instant alarm and a quick attack. Two 
or three Italians would pounce on the in- 





trader, who would either hurry away or, 
if bold enough to fight, would get stung to 
death and pitched unceremoniously out of 
the entry. Or if it were a stray yellow- 
jacket attracted by the alluring odor of 
honey from the hive, one of the same 
things would happen. One day not a 
single German came, but an army, a guer- 
rilla band intent on pillage and murder. 
And then there was a grand battle ¡ª but 
we must wait a minute for that. 

There were also other enemies of Fuzzy¡¯s 
glass house besides German bees and yel- 
low wasps. There is a delicate little 
moth, bee-moth it is called, that slips into 
the hive at night all noiselessly and with- 
out betraying its presence to any of the 
bees if it can help it. And it lays, very 
quickly indeed, a lot of tiny round eggs in 
a crack somewhere. It doesn¡¯t seem to 
try to get out. At any rate it rarely does 
get out. For it almost always gets found 
out and stung to death and pulled and 



torn into small pieces by the enraged bees, 
who seem to go almost frantic whenever 
they discover one of these innocent-seem- 
ing little gray-and-brown moths in the 
house. And well they may, for death and 
destruction of the community follow in 
the train of the bee-moth. From the eggs 
hatch little si.xteen-footed grubs that keep 
well hidden in the cracks, only venturing 
out to feed on the wax of the comb near- 
est them. As they grow they need more 
and more wax, but they protect them- 
selves while getting it by spinning a silken 
web which prevents the bees from getting 
at them. Wherever they go they spin 
silken lines and little webs until, if several 
bee-moths have managed to lay their eggs 
in the hive and several hundred of their 
voracious wax-eating grubs are spinning 
tough silken lines and webs through all 
the corridors and rooms of the bees¡¯ house, 
the household duties get so difficult to 
carry on that the bee community begins 



to dwindle; the unfed young die in their 
cells, the indoor workers starve, and the 
breakdown of the whole hive occurs. 
Such a thing happened in this very glass 
house of Fuzzy¡¯s a year before we got ac- 
quainted with Fuzzy herself. And we 
had to get a new family of bees to come 
and live in the house after we had cleaned 
out and washed and sterilized all the 
cracks and corners so that no live eggs of 
the terrible bee-moth remained. 

Some days we found Fuzzy at work 
with several companions on more ])r()saic 
and commonplace things about the house; 
chores they might be called. She had to 
help clean house occasionally. For the 
bees are extremely cleanly housekeepers, 
with a keen eye for all fallen bits of wax, 
or bodies of dead bees, or any kind of dirt 
that might come from the housekeeping of 
so large a family. Every day the hive is 
thoroughly cleaned. If there conies a day 
when it is not, that is a bad sign. There 





is something wrong with the bee commu- 
nity. They haven¡¯t enough food, or they 
arc getting sick, or something else irregu- 
lar and distressing is happening. 

Also the house has to be ¡°calked¡± occa- 
sionally to keep out draughts and more 
particularly creeping enemies of the hive, 
like bcc-moths and bee-lice. The cracks 
are pasted over with propolis, which is 
made from resin or gum brought in from 
certain trees. If something gets into the 
hive that can¡¯t be carried out, then the 
bees cover it up with propolis. If they 
find a bee-moth grub in a crack where they 
can¡¯t get to it to sting it to death, they 
wall it up, a living prisoner, with propolis. 
Once our bees kept coming in with a curi- 
ous new kind of propolis; a greenish oily- 
looking stuff that stuck to their legs and 
got on their faces and bodies and wouldn¡¯t 
clean off. We discovered that they were 
trying to unpaint a near-by house as fast 
as it was being freshly painted! 



Fuzzy took her turn at all these odd 
jobs, and though she was beginning to 
show here and there a few places where 
her luxuriant hair was rubbed off a little, 
she was still as lively and willing and in- 
dustrious as ever. Every day we liked 
her more and more and wished, how many 
times, that we could talk with her and tell 
her how much we liked her, and have her 
tell us how she enjoyed life in the glass 
house. But we could only watch her and 
keep acquainted with all her manifold 
duties and hope that nothing would hap- 
pen to her on her long foraging trips for 
pollen and nectar and propolis. When- 
ever Mary and I came to the glass house 
and couldn¡¯t find Fuzzy, we were in a sort 
of fever of excitement and apprehension 
until she came in with her great loads of 
white or yellow or red pollen and went to 
shaking and dancing and whirling about 
in the extraordinary way that she and her 
mates have while hunting for a suitable 


pantry cell in which to unload ncr pollen- 
baskets. Sometimes she would walk and 
dance and whirl over almost all of the pol- 
len-cells in the house before she would 
linally decide on one. Then she would 
stand over it and pry with the strong 
sharp spines on her middle legs at the 
solidly packed pollen loads on her hind 
legs, trying to loosen them so they would 
fall into the cell. Sometimes she simply 
couldn¡¯t get the pollen loads loose, and 
then a companion would help her. And 
after they were loosened and had fallen 
into the cell, she or a companion would ram 
her head down into the cell and pack and 
tamp the soft sticky pollen loads down 
into one even mass. And then how in- 
dustriously she would clean herself, draw- 
ing her antennae through the neat little 
antennae combs on her front legs, and lick- 
ing herself with her long flexible tongue, 
or getting licked by her mates all over. 

Perhaps as she was washing herself after 



a hard foraging trip, the stately and grace- 
ful queen of the house would come walk- 
ing slowly by, looking for empty cells in 
which to lay eggs. Then Fuzzy would 
turn around, head toward the queen, and 
form part of the little circle of honor that 
always kept forming and re-forming around 
the queen mother. For the honey-bee 
queen is the mother of all the great family, 
and her relation to the community is 
really the mother relation rather than 
that of a reigning queen. She does not 
order the bees; indeed, the worker bees 
seem to order her. They determine what 
cells she may have to lay eggs in and when 
she shall be superseded by a new queen. 
And when they decide for a new queen, 
they immediately set to work in a very 
interesting way to make one. 

This is the way, as Mary and I saw it 
through the glass sides of Fuzzy¡¯s house. 
First, a little group of workers went to 
work tearing down, apparently, some comb 




already made; that is, they began on the 
lower edge of a brood-comb, in the cells of 
which the old queen had just laid eggs, 
to tear out the partitions between two or 
three of the cells. What became of the eggs 
we couldn¡¯t tell, for they are very small, 
and the bees were so crowded together 
that we could see only the general results 
of their activity. Soon it was evident that 
they were building as well as tearing down, 
and a new cell, much larger than the usual 
kind and quite different in shape, began to 
take form. It was like a thimble, only 
longer and slenderer, and it had the wide 
end closed and the narrower tapering end 
open. They worked excitedly and rapidly, 
and the new cell steadily grew in length. 
Never was it left alone for a minute. Al- 
ways there were bees coming and going 
and always some clustered about. It was 
a constant center of interest and excite- 
ment. 

Mary and I knew of course that this was 




a queen cell, and that at its base there was 
one of the eggs laid by the old queen in a 
worker cell. This egg hatched, we knew, 
in a few days, although we could not see 
the little grub, but nurse bees were about 
constantly besides the cell-builders, and all 
the bees that came to the wonderful new 
cell seemed to realize that a very impor- 
tant, if at present rather grubby and 
wholly helpless, personage was in it. The 
cell finally got to be more than an inch 
long, and at the end of five days it was 
capped. A lot of milky bee-jelly had 
been stored in it before capping. After 
this nothing happened for seven days. 

Mary was in the room where the glass 
bee-houses are, and I was in an adjoining 
room, with the door between the two 
open. As I sat peering through my big 
microscope, I seemed to hear a curious un- 
usual sound from the bee-room, a sort of 
piping rather high-pitched but muffled. 
Perhaps it was Mary trying a new song. 




She has a good assortment of noises. But 
now came another sound; lower-pitched 
but louder than the other; a trumpet-call, 
only of course not as loud as the soldiers¡¯ 
trumpets or the ones on the stage when the 
King is about to come in. Then the shrill 
piping again; and again the trumpet an- 
swer. And finally a third and new sound, 
but this last unmistakably a Mary sound. 
And with it came the dear girl herself, with 
her hair standing on ¡ª well, no, I cannot 
truthfully say standing on end, but trying 
to. And her eyes shooting sparks and her 
mouth open and her hands up. 

¡°The bees,¡± she gasped, ¡°the bees are 
doing it!¡± 

There was no doubt of what ¡°it¡± meant. 
It was this sounding of pipes and trum- 
pets; these battle calls. 

I leaped to my feet; that is, if an elderly 
professor, who has certain twinges in his 
joints occasionally, can really leap. Any- 
way I knocked over my chair ¡ª and pre- 




cious near my microscope ¡ª in getting up, 
and started for the bees. And that shows 
the high degree of my excitement. But 
never before in all the years I had played 
with bees had I heard the trumpet chal- 
lenges of queen bees to the death duel. In- 
side the cell was the new queen shut up in 
darkness, but ready and eager to come out, 
and piping her challenge. And outside, 
brave and fearless, if old and worn, was the 
mother queen trumpeting back her de- 
fiance. It was the spirit of the Amazons. 

And what excitement in the hive! Sim- 
ply frantic were the thousands of workers. 
We watched them racing about wildly; up, 
down, across, back; but mostly clustering 
in the bottom near the queen cell. And 
working industriously at the cell itself, a 
a group of builders, strengthening and 
thickening the cell¡¯s walls especially at 
the closed lower end. They seemed to be, 
yes, they were, preventing the new queen 
inside from coming out. She was probably 




gnawing away with her trowel-like jaws at 
the soft wax from the inside, while they 
were putting on more wax and keeping her 
a prisoner. 

This went on for two or three days. 
The piping and trumpeting kept up inter- 
mittently, and the thickening of the cell 
constantly. Until the time came! 

And now I am going to disappoint you 
dreadfully. But much less than Mary and 
I were disappointed. We were not there 
when the time came! 

The bees were excited, I have said. 
Mary and I were excited, I have said. The 
bees put in all their time being excited and 
watching the queen cell. We put in most 
of ours. But we had to eat and we had to 
sleep. The bees didn¡¯t seem to. And so 
we missed the coming out. What a pity! 
How unfair to us! And to you. 

As there is by immemorial honey-bee 
tradition but one queen in a community 
at one time, when new queens issue from 





the great cells, something has to happen. 
This may be one of three things: either the 
old and new queens battle to death, and it 
is believed that in such battles only does 
a queen bee ever use her sting, or the 
workers interfere and kill either the old 
or new queen by ¡°balling¡± her (gathering 
in a tight suffocating mass about her), or 
either the old (usually old) or new queen 
leaves the hive with a swarm, and a new 
community is founded. In Fuzzy¡¯s com- 
munity this last thing happened when the 
new queen came out. 

Mary and I were on hand very early the 
morning of the third day after the piping 
and trumpeting had begun. As we jerked 
the black cloth jacket off the hive to see 
how things were, we were astonished at 
the new excitement that was apparent in 
the hive; the bees seemed to be in a per- 
fect frenzy and had suspended all other 
operations except racing about in appar- 
ent utter dementia. We could find neither 




the old queen nor the new queen in the 
seething mass, nor could we even see 
whether the queen cell was open or still 
sealed up. 

Another curious thing was that the tak- 
ing off of the black cloth jacket seemed to 
affect the bees very strongly. They had 
suddenly become very sensitive to light, 
and while, when the jacket was on, they all 
seemed to be making towards the bottom 
and especially towards the exit corner, 
which was the lower corner next to the 
window, as soon as we lifted off the jacket 
they seemed all to rush up to the top where 
the light was strongest. So nearly simul- 
taneous and uniform were the turning and 
rushing up that the whole mass of bees 
seemed to flow like some thick mottled 
liquid. 

It was evident that all this was the ex- 
citement and frenzy of swarming. And it 
was also evident that the bees, in their 
great excitement, were finding their way 




to the outlet by the light that came 
in through it. And when we removed the 
cloth jacket we confused them because the 
light now came into the hive from both 
sides and was especially strong at the top, 
which was nearest the greatest o.\i)anse of 
the outer window. So wc finally let the 
jacket stay on, and after a considerable 
time of violent exertion, the bees began to 
issue pell-mell from the door of the house. 
The first comers waited for the others, 
and there was pretty soon formed a great 
mass of excited bees around the doorway, 
and clustered on the stone window-sill 
just outside. Then suddenly the whole 
mass took wing and flew away together. 
And pretty soon all was quiet in the hive. 

Mary and I had been nearly as excited 
as the bees, and we were glad to sit and 
rest a little and get breath again. Soon it 
was luncheon time and we went off to 
Mary¡¯s house without looking into the 
hive. We had had just about all the bee 





observing we needed for one forenoon. 
But almost the first thing that Mary did 
at the table was to straighten up suddenly 
and cry out, ¡°I wonder if Fuzzy swarmed!¡± 
And thereafter that was all we thought of, 
and we made a very hasty meal of it. And 
the moment we got up we hurried back to 
Fuzzy¡¯s home and jerked off the black 
jacket. 

How quiet everything was inside. And 
how lessened the number of bees. Fully 
one-third of the community must have 
gone out. We set to work looking care- 
fully at all the remaining bees. It was 
only a minute or two before Mary clapped 
her hands and cried, ¡® ¡® She¡¯ s here 1 ¡± ¡® ¡® She ¡± 

was Fuzzy, of course. And we were both 
very glad that Fuzzy had not deserted the 
glass house¡ª and us. 

Some one came in and said that a ¡°lot 
of your bees are out here hanging on to 
a bush.¡± But we had seen ¡°swarms¡± 
before, and were much more interested 




in finding out what the bees do inside 
after a swarm has gone off than in watch- 
ing the swarm outside. We knew that 
¡°scouts¡± would fly away soon from the 
great hanging bunch or swarm to look for 
a suitable new home; a hollow tree, a de- 
serted hive, a box in hedge corner, any 
place protected and dark, and when they 
had found one, they would come back, and 
soon the whole swarm would fly off to the 
new house. Once one of our swarms 
started down a chimney of a neighbor¡¯s 
house, and immensely surj^rised the good 
people by coming out, with a great buzzing, 
into the fireplace! And another swarm, 
not finding a suitable indoors place, sim- 
ply began to build new combs hanging 
down from the branch of a cypress-tree in 
the Arboretum, and really made an out- 
door home there, carrying on all the work 
of a bee-community for months. But 
usually a bee-swarm gets found by some 
bee-keeper and put into an empty hive. 





And that is what happened to our desert- 
ers. 

After Mary had found Fuzzy, who seemed 
to have lost considerable hair and to have 
got pretty well rubbed in the grand melee, 
she continued to ])eer carefully through the 
glass side of the hive. And I looked care- 
fully too. Of course we wanted to find 
out about the (picens. Was there any 
queen left in our hive? We knew there 
must be a (picen with the swarm; bees 
don¡¯t go off without a (piecn. So if the 
old and new (jueen had fought and one had 
been killed, or if the workers had ¡°balled¡± 
the new queen when she came out, there 
could be no queen left in the hive. Of 
course this would not be very serious. 
For there were many eggs and also many 
just-hatched bee-grubs in the brood-combs, 
and the workers could easily make a new 
queen. But this wasn¡¯t necessary, for we 
soon found a graceful, slender-bodied bee, 
but so fresh and brightly colored and clean 




that we knew her to be the new queen and 
not the old. 

Things were perfectly normal and quiet. 
Some foragers were coming and going; 
house-cleaners were busily at work on the 
floor of the house, and nurses were moving 
about over the brood-cells. Not a trace 
of the wild frenzy of the forenoon. What a 
puzzling thing it is to see all the signs of 
tremendous mental excitement in other 
animals and yet not to be able to under- 
stand in the least their real condition! 
They may seem to do things for reasons 
and impulses that lead us to do things, but 
we can¡¯t be at all sure that their mental 
or nervous proces.ses, their impulses and 
stimuli, are those which control us. We 
can¡¯t po.ssibly put ourselves in their ])laces. 
For we are made differently. And there- 
fore it is plainly foolish to try to interpret 
the behavior of the lower animals on a 
basis of our understanding of our own 
behavior. Insects may see colors we can- 





not see; may hear sounds we cannot hear; 
smell odors too delicate for us to smell. 
In fact, from our observations and experi- 
ments, we are sure they do all these things. 
The world to them, then, is different from 
the world to us. And their behavior is 
based on their appreciation by their senses 
in their own way of this different 
world. 

What determines which queen shall leave 
the hive with the swarm? What deter- 
mines which five thousand out of fifteen 
thousand worker bees, all apparently simi- 
larly stimulated and excited, shall swarm 
out, and which ten thousand shall stay in? 
These are questions too hard for us to an- 
swer. We may take refuge in Maeter- 
linck¡¯s poetical conception of the ¡°spirit 
of the hive.¡± Let us say that the ¡°spirit 
of the hive¡± decides these things. As 
well as what workers shall forage and what 
ones clean house; what bees shall venti- 
late and what make wax and build comb. 




Which is simply to say that we don¡¯t know 
what decides all these things. 

The reduction in numbers of the in- 
mates of Fuzzy¡¯s house made it much 
easier to follow closely the behavior of 
any one bee, or any special group of bees 
doing some one thing. And both Mary 
and I had long wanted to sec as clearly as 
possible just what goes on when the bees 
are making wax and building comb. We 
had often examined, on the bodies of dead 
bees, the four pairs of five-sided wax- 
plates on the under side of the hind body. 
We knew that the wax comes out of skin- 
glands under these plates as a liquid, and 
oozes through the pores of the plates, 
spreading out and hardening in thin sheets 
on the outside of the plates. To produce 
the wax certain workers eat a large amount 
of honey, and then mass together in a 
curtain or festoon hanging down from the 
ceiling of the hive or frame. Here they 
increase the temperature of their bodies 




by some strong internal exertion; and after 
several hours or sometimes two or three 
clays, the line glistening wax-sheets appear 
on the wax-plates. Tliese sheets get 
larger and larger until they project beyond 
the edges of the body, when they either 
fall off or are plucked off by other workers. 

It was only two or three days after the 
excitement of the swarming out that 
Mary and I saw one of these curtains or 
hanging festoons of bees making wax, and 
you may be sure we tried to watch it close- 
ly. The bees hung to each other by their 
legs and kept quite still. The curtain hung 
down fully six inches from the ceiling of 
the house, and the first or upper row of 
bees had therefore to sustain the hanging 
weight of all those below. And there were 
certainly several hundred bees in the cur- 
tain. The wax-scales began to appear on 
the second day. And many of them fell 
off and down to the floor of the house. 
Some of the scales were plucked off by 




Other workers and carried in their mouths 
to where a new comb had been started be- 
fore the swarming, and either used by 
themselves to help in (lie coinb-biiilding or 
given to comb-buildcrs already at work. 
Some of the scales wcmc pluckc'd off by 
the wax-making workers themselves, who 
then left the curtain ami carried the 
wax-scales to the seat of the comb-build- 
ing operations. Various other workers 
picked up from the lloor the fallen scales 
and carried them to the comb-builders. 
These building be(?s would chew u|) ])ieces 
of wax in their mouths, mixing it with 
saliva, and then would f)ress and mould it 
with their little trowel-like jaws against 
the comb, so as to build up steadily the 
familiar six-sided cells. 

Each layer of comb is comjrosed of a 
double tier or layer of these cells, a com- 
mon partition or base serving as bottom 
of each tier. The cells to be used for brood 
are of two sizes, smaller ones for workers 





to be reared in, and larger ones for the 
drones. Sometimes the queen lays drone 
eggs in worker cells and then the cells have 
to be built up higher when the drone-grub 
gets too large for its cell. Sometimes, too, 
the worker bees lay eggs ¡ª this happens 
often in a hive bereft by some accident of 
its queen ¡ª but these eggs can only hatch 
into drones. Occasionally the workers 
make a mistake and build a queen cell 
around a drone egg. This happened once 
in our hive when there were no queen-laid 
eggs in the brood-cells, and some workers 
had laid eggs. The workers tried to make 
a new queen out of one of these eggs, but 
of course only a worthless drone came out 
of the queen cell. In building comb and 
cells for storing honey, new wax is almost 
exclusively used, but for brood-comb old 
wax and wax mixed with pollen may be 
used. Any comb or part of a comb not 
needed may be torn down and the wax 
used to build new comb or to cap cells with. 

 

I have said that the nearest neighbors 
of Fuzzy¡¯s family arc a lot of black Ger- 
man bees, housed in a larger liouse than 
Fuzzy¡¯s, but one also with glass sides so 
that we can see what goes on inside. The 
door of the house opens throiigli the same 
large window as that of Fuzzy¡¯s house, 
but the foragers coming back from their 
long trips rarely make a mistake in the 
doors, the Germans coming to their door 
and the Italians to theirs. The German 
community is much the larger, there being 
probably thirty or forty thousand workers 
in it, although of course only one queen, 
and only a few hundred drones. Some- 
times the foragers, both Germans and Ital- 
ians, make the mistake of coming to the 
wrong window of the room in which their 
houses are. There are five large windows 
all alike in the west wall of this room, and 
often we find our bees bumping against the 
other windows, especially the ones just 
next to the right one. They can¡¯t, of 





course, see in through these windows be- 
cause the room is much darker than out- 
side, and so all that the home-coming bees 
can see as they approach the building is 
a row of similar windows separated from 
each other by similar spaces of buffy stone. 
And keen as our bees are in finding their 
way straight to their hives from distant 
flower-fields, this repetition of similar win- 
dows seems to confuse some of them. 

But what I started to tell about is some- 
thing that happened between the neigh- 
boring bcc-houscs (juite different from the 
troubles of the bees finding their way 
home. It was something that gave Mary 
and me the principal excitement that we 
had in all our many days of watching 
bees. 

Mary ami I do not want to say that the 
Gennan bees knew that a third of Fuzzy¡¯s 
community had swarmed out and gone 
away. Though how they could help know- 
ing it really seems more a puzzle, for there 



was excitement and buzzing and window- 
sill covered and air full of bees enough to 
have told everybody within a rod of what 
was going on in the Italian house. But it 
was true that Fuzzy¡¯s community had 
never been troubled at all seriously 
by the belligerent (icrmans, until after 
it had been much reduced in strength 
by the loss of one-third of its members. 
And then this trouble did come, and came 
soon. So it looks as if tlic (lermans real- 
ized the weakness of their neighbors. But 
perhaps not. 

Just as our other exciting time beginning 
with the piping of the new (jneen and last- 
ing until the subsequent swarming was a 
discovery of Mary¡¯s, .so with this new time 
of high excitement; high excitement I 
may say both on our part and the bees¡¯. 
Mary was in the room where the bees arc, 
although not at the moment watching 
them, when she heard a sound of violent 
buzzing and humming. It grew quickly 





louder and shriller, and in a moment both 
communities were in an uproar. 

It was a battle, a great battle. On the 
one hand, a struggle by brutal invaders 
intent on sacking the home and pillaging 
the stores of a community given to ways of 
peace and just now reduced in numbers by 
a migration or exodus from home of a large 
group of restless spirits; on the other hand, 
a struggle for home and property and the 
lives of hundreds of babies by this weak 
and presumably timid and unwarlike peo- 
ple. A great band of Germans were at 
the door of Fuzzy¡¯s house trying to get 
in! They buzzed and pushed and ran 
their stings in and out of their bodies, 
and crowded the entry way full. But the 
Italian workers and guards had roused 
their community, and pouring out from the 
hive into the narrow entry was a stream 
of angry and brave amber bees, ready to 
fight to the death for their home. 

It was really a terrific struggle. The 




Italians, few in numbers as a community, 
were yet enough to oppose on fairly equal 
terms the band of Germans, for by no 
means all the Germans had come from 
their house. And the Italians had the 
great advantage of being defenders. They 
had only to keep out the black column 
trying to force its way in through the 
narrow door and entry. And they were 
no laggards in battle. They fought with 
perfect courage and great energy. Often 
a small group of Italians would force its 
way out of the door and into the very 
midst of the Germans outside on the win- 
dow-sill. These brave bees were all killed, 
overwhelmed by the superior numbers of 
the enemy. But not until they had left 
many dying Germans on the stone window- 
ledge were their own paralyzed and dying 
bodies hustled out of the way. 

In many cases the combat took on the 
character of duels between single pairs of 
combatants. A German and an Italian 




would clasp each other with jaws and legs, 
and thus interlocked and whirling over and 
over with violent beating of their wings 
would stab at each other until one or both 
were mortally wounded. All the time the 
frenzietl ball would be rolling nearer and 
nearer the outer ('dge of the treacherous 
sloping window-ledge, until finally over it 
would go, whirling in the air through the 
thirty feet of fall to the ground below. 
Here the .struggle would go on, if the 
fighters wen' not too stunned by the fall, 
until one or both bees were dead or para- 
lyzed. 

It is really too jiainful to tell of this fight. 
And it was painful to watch. But the end 
came soon. And it was a glorious victory 
for Fuzzy and her companions. The Ger- 
man robbers flew back, what were left of 
them, to their own hive. Mary and I 
tried all through the light to watch Fuzzy. 
Hut we saw her only once; she was in the 
entry then and nearly in the front row of 





fighters. We were glad to see her so 
brave, but fearful for her fate. After the 
fight we looked an.xiously througli the 
hive for our little white-spotted friend. 
We didn¡¯t see her, and were ready to 
mourn her for lost, wlien Mary happened 
to look out on the window-ledge where a 
few Italians were pushing the remaining 
paralyzed or dead Ciermans off. There 
was Fuzzy dragging, with murh (¡®ffort, a 
dead, black bee along tlic rough stone. 

We were very happy, then, and wanted 
more than ever to be able to talk to our 
brave little champion and rejoice with 
her over the splendid vii'tory. But we 
could only do as Fuzzy seemed to be doing. 
That is, take up again the work that lay 
at our hands. My work was to go into 
the lecture-room and talk to a class about 
the absence of intelligence and mind and 
spirit in the lower animals and the de- 
pendence of their behavior upon physics 
and chemistry and mechanics! Mary¡¯s 





work was to go out into the poppy-field 
and talk with the little grass people whom 
she never sees or hears, but knows are 
tliere. 










It was one evening not long after our 
afternoon on Bungalow Hill, where Mary 
had found the mealy-bugs in the runways 
of an ant¡¯s nest under a stone, and I had 
told her about the clever little brown ants 
and their aphid cattle in the Illinois corn- 
fields. Ever since that afternoon Mary 
had been asking (juestions about ants, and 
so this evening I was translating bits to 
her from a new Herman book about ants. 
It told about the cruel forays of the hordes 
of the great fighting and robbing Ecitons 
of the Amazons; of the extraordinary 
mutually helpful relations between the 
Aztec ants and the Imbauba tree of South 
America, which result in the ants getting 
a comfortable home and special food from 





the treCj while the tree gets protection 
through the Aztecs from the leaf-stealing 
Ecodomas. It told of the ants that live 
in the hollow leaves of the Dischidia plants 
in the Philippine Islands, and the way the 
plants get even by sending slender aerial 
rootlets into the leaves to feed on the dead 
bodies of the ants that die in the nests. 
It told of the ants in this country that 
build sheds of wood-pulp over colonies of 
honey-dew insects or ant-cattle on the 
stems of plants; of the fungus-garden 
ants of South America and Mexico and 
Texas that bite off little pieces of green 
leaves and make beds of them in special 
chambers in their underground nests, so 
that certain moulds grow on these leaf- 
beds and provide a special kind of food 
for the ant-gardeners. It told of the ants 
that make slaves of other ants, and get to 
depend so much on these slaves that they 
can¡¯t even care for their own children, and 
it told about the honey-ants of the Garden 





of the Gods that make some of the workers 
in each nest ¡ª but that¡¯s what this story 
is going to tell about, so we had better 
wait. 

But it was all a veritable fairy-story 
book, as any good book about the ways 
and life of ants must be. And Mary lis- 
tened eagerly. She liked it. When going- 
home time came she had, however, one 
insistent question to ask. ¡°Wliat can I 
see?¡± she demanded. ¡°What can I see 
right away; to-morrow?¡± 

¡°Mary you can ¡ª sec ¡ª to-morrow,¡± ¡ª and 
I think rapidly, ¡ª ¡°you can see ¡ª to-mor- 
row,¡± ¡ª still thinking, ¡ª ¡°ah, yes ¡ª yes you 
can; you can see them to-morrow.¡± 

¡°But what can I see to-morrow?¡± 

¡°Why the animated honey-jars; didn¡¯t 
I say what? No? Well, to-morrow we 
can go to see them; in the Arboretum at 
the foot of the big Monterey pine. I think 
I remember the exact place.¡± 

¡°But I thought the honey-ants weth 




only in Mexico and New Mexico and Colo- 
rado,¡± says Mary. ¡°Didn¡¯t the book say 
that?¡± 

¡°Yes, that kind; but we have a kind of 
our own here in California. The sort that 
McCook found in the Garden of the Gods 
and studied all that summer twenty-five 
years ago is found only there and in the 
Southwest, but there are two or three 
other kinds of honey-ants known, and one 
of them that has never been told about in 
the books at all is right here on the cam- 
pus. 'there are several of the nests here, 
or were a few years ago, aiul we¡¯ll go to- 
morrow and try to find one. It will be 
fine, won¡¯t it?¡± 

¡°Fine,¡± said Mary. ¡°Good-night.¡± 

And so the next morning we went. The 
Arboretum is a place where once were 
planted almost all the kinds of trees that 
t^'ow wild in ('alifornia, besides many other 
^r^ljiinds from Australia and Japan and New 
/.ealand ami Peru and Chili and several of 







the other Pacific Ocean countries. But 
the big, swift-growing eucalyptuses and 
Monterey pines have crowded out many of 
the other more tender and less-pushing 
kinds. However, it is still a wonderful 
place of trees. Many birds live there; 
swift troops of the beautiful plumed Cali- 
fornia quails; crimson-throated Anna hum- 
ming-birds, crestless California jays, fidget- 
ing finches and j uncos, spunky sparrows 
and wrens, chattering chickadees and tit- 
mice, fierce little fly-catchers and kinglets. 
There are winding paths and little-used 
roads in it, and altogether it is a fine place 
to go when one has only a short hour for 
walking and seeing things. 

And so Mary and I came with a garden- 
trowel and a glass fruit-jar to the foot of 
the big Monterey pine near the toyon. A 
toyon, if you arc an Easterner and need 
telling, is the tree that bears the red ber- 
ries for Christmas for us Pacific-Coast ''rs. 
It is our holly, as the Ceanothus io'''our 





lilac, and the poison-oak is our autumn- 
red sumac. 

At the foot of the Monterey pine we be- 
gan our search for the honey-ants. We 
didn¡¯t, of course, expect to find them walk- 
ing about with their swollen bodies full of 
amber honey, for the honey-bearers are 
supposed not to walk around, but to stay 
inside the nest, in a special chamber made 
for them. We looked rather for the honey- 
gatherers, the worker foragers. 

Pretty soon Mary found a swift little 
black ant. But, no, it was an Apheeno- 
gastcr that ¡ª 

¡°A feeno-gasscr?¡± asks Mary. ¡°What 
is that?¡¯¡¯ 

¡°That has the curious, flat -bodied dwarf 
crickets living with it in its nests,¡± I con- 
tinue. ¡° Myrmccophila, the ant-lover, they 
call this little cricket which has lost its 
win^s and its voice and is altogether an 
ins(i^nificant and meek little guest unbidden 
but' .tolerated at the ant¡¯s table. And here. 





here is a big black-and-brovvn carpenter- 
ant going home with a seed in its mouth.¡± 

¡®¡®Where is its home? Does it build a 
house out of wood? Let¡¯s follow it,¡± 
Mary bursts in. 

¡°No, we are after honey-ants, remember. 
We mustn¡¯t let ourselves get distracted by 
all these others. The carpenter-ants do 
make them.selvcs a home of wood, but 
they do it by gnawing out galleries and 
chambers in a dead tree trunk or stump 
or in a neglected timber. That isn¡¯t 
exactly building, but it is at least a kind 
of carpentering, a sort of ¡ª ¡± 

¡°Is this one?¡± interrupts Mary, poking 
violently at an angry red-headed little 
slave-maker ant that seemed anxious to 
get off to its home where its slaves, which 
are other ants captured when still young 
and unacquainted with tlieir rightful fam- 
ily, do all the work of food-getting and 
cleaning and taking care of the babies. 

And then I recognized a Prenolepis, that 





is, ¡ª and I do beg pardon, ¡ª one of our cam- 
pus honey-ants. Of course I suppose they 
are elsewhere in California and perhaps 
north in Oregon and east in Nevada and 
Arizona, but I have only seen them here, 
and hence always think of them as belong- 
ing exclusively with us campus-dwellers. 
It was a little brown ant with black hind 
body and paler under side. It isn¡¯t par- 
ticularly impressive, for it is only about 
one-eighth of an inch long, and its colors 
and appearance are much like those of 
many other ants, but there is something 
about it sulficiently distinctive to let one 
recognize it at sight. 

The thing to do now, of course, was to 
find its nest. There are various ways of 
finding the nest of any particular ant you 
may happen to discover running about 
loose over the country, but not one of them 
am I going to tell you. They are good 
things to work out for yourself. Mary and 
I know how, and so we had little trouble 





and didn¡¯t have to spend much time in 
finding the home of our wandering Preno^ 
lepis , ¡ª there it is again, ¡ª campus honey- 
ant I mean. And that is a fair name for 
it, for McCook who found the famous 
honey-ants of the (harden of the (iods in 
Colorado named his kind Myrmccocystus 
melliger hortusdcoriim, wliich is straiglit 
Latin and Greek for the ¡°lioney-pot ant 
of the Garden of the Gods.¡± But whal a 
name for a little ant one-eighth of an inch 
long to carry! 

It would take too many words and I am 
afraid would be too trivial a story for even 
this very happy-go-lucky little book to 
tell how Mary and I dug and dug in the 
ground near the foot of the trcng and how 
carefully we worked with our garden- 
trowel and mostly with our fingers! And 
how we traced out runway after runway 
and opened chamber after chamber of the 
honey-ant¡¯s nest until we found the honey- 
pantry with its strange jars of sweetness 




all hanging from the roof. The picture 
that Mary carefully sketched in, and that 
Sekko Shimada painted for us with his 
dainty Japanese brushes and little saucers 
of costly Japanese ink, shows very well 
])art of the nest, that part that had one of 
the honey-rooms in. You won¡¯t see the 
base of the Monterey pine-tree in the pic- 
ture, nor any of the other trees that were 
all around, because Mary didn¡¯t put them 
into her sketch, and we forgot to tell Sekko 
where the nest was. But the galleries and 
houey-chamber and the ants themselves 
are all right in Sekko¡¯s picture. 

In some of the galleries w'e had found 
ants with considerably swollen hind bodies, 
which evidently had the stomach or crop 
w'ell filled with some nearly transparent, 
pale yellowish-brown liquid. But it was 
not until we discovered the honey-pantry 
that we saw the extraordinary fully laden 
real live honey- jars, which were, of course, 
nothing but some of the worker ants hang- 



ing by their feet from the roof of the cham- 
ber, with their hind bodies enormously 
swollen by the great (jnantity of honey 
held in the crop. In opening the cham- 
ber we dislodged two or three of the honey- 
jars that fell to the floor and could hardly 
turn over or walk at all, so helpless were 
they. And one of them broke and the 
honey came out in a big drop, and I tasted 
it on the tip of my little finger, and it was 
sweet. So it was surely honey. And you 
should have seen how eagerly two or three 
other workers in the chamber, without 
swollen bodies, lapped up this sweet drop 
that came out of the body of the poor, 
broken honey-jar! 

As we had broken into the home of the 
honey-ants and had pretty nearly wrecked 
it, it seemed only fair that we should try 
to help our honey-ants begin another home 
under as kindly conditions as possible. So 
we put as many of them as we could find, 
foraging workers, honey-holders, and the 





(jueen whom we found in a special queen 
rooiUj into our glass fruit-jar with some 
soil, and brought them all home and put 
them into a formicary. Which is simply 
an artificial ants¡¯ nest, or house already 
arrangcfl for ants to live in. It has a place 
to hold food and has dark rooms and sunny 
rooms, cool rooms and warm ones, all nicely 
fixed with runways connecting them, and 
food is |)nf in as often as necessary and 
always in one ])lacc, which the ants learn 
to know very soon, indeed. This makes 
housekeeping easy and pleasant for the 
ants, and lets us see a great deal of how it 
is carried on, because there are glass sides 
and top to the house, so that by lifting lit- 
tle pieces of black cardboard or cloth we 
can look in and watch the ants at work. 

The honey-ants¡¯ colony seemed to live 
very contentedly in our formicary, for they 
went ahead with all their usual business of 
laying eggs and rearing babies and feeding 
them, and finding honey and getting the 




honey- jars loaded with it and hung by 
their feet from the ceiling of their room, 
and all the other things that go on regu- 
larly in a honey-ant¡¯s house. 

The principal thing we wanted to do, 
however, was to learn how the honey-jars 
got filled and also how they got emptied 
again! And this was not at all hard to 
find out, although we never found out cer- 
tainly where the worker foragers got their 
honey in the Arboretum. McCook found 
that his foragers in the Garden of the Gods 
gathered a sweet honey-dew liquid that 
oozed out in little drops from certain live 
oak-galls near the nest. But our ants 
seemed to be getting their honey from some- 
where up in the pine-tree, for there was a 
constant stream of them going up and 
down the trunk. Besides, many of those 
coming down had swollen bodies partially 
filled with honey, while none of those go- 
ing up did. Now the only honey supply 
in the pine-tree that we know is the honey- 




clew given off liberally by a brown roundish 
scale insect that lives on the pine-needles. 
So we think our honey-ants gathered their 
honey material from these honey-dew 
scale insects. But we have seen them 
collect honey stuff from various aphids and 
also from the growing twigs of live-oak 
trees. They seem to be willing to take 
it wherever they can find it. 

Of course we had to pro\ide a supply of 
honey for our indoor colony, and this sup- 
ply was eagerly and constantly visited by 
the foraging workers. They would lap it 
up and then go into the nest and feed the 
live honey-pots! That is, a well-fed for- 
ager would go into the honey-pantry and 
force the honey out from its own crop 
through its mouth into the mouth of one 
of the live honey-jars. Undoubtedly the 
honey-bee honey wo furnished them was 
considerably changtxl while in the body of 
the foraging worker. 

But all the time the nurses and workers 



inside the nest needed honey for food. And 
this they got by going to the honey-pantry, 
and by some gentle means inducing the 
live honey-pots to give up some of their 
store. Mouth to mouth the feeder and 
the filled honey-ant would stand or cling 
for some minutes. And there was no 
doubt of what was going on. The honey- 
pot was this time forcing honey out of its 
own over-filled crop and into the mouth 
of the nurse. 

Thus all the time there went on a con- 
stant emptying and replenishing of the 
strange honey-pots. What an extraor- 
dinary kind of life! Nothing to do but to 
drink and disgorge honey; to cling mo- 
tionless to the ceiling of a little room, or 
lie helpless, or feebly dragging about on 
the floor and be pumped into and pumped 
out of! To have one¡¯s body swollen to 
several times its natural size by an over- 
loaded stomach, and to be likely to burst 
from a fall or deep scratch! 




But there is simply no telling before- 
hand what remarkable condition of things 
you may find in an ant¡¯s nest. There is 
an ardent naturalist student of ants in the 
great museum of natural history in New 
York, who keeps publishing short ac- 
counts of the new things he is all the time 
discovering about the habits and life of 
ants. And if I didn¡¯t know him to be not 
only a perfectly truthful man but a trained 
and rigorously careful observer and scien- 
tific scholar, I should simply put his 
stories aside as preposterous. But on the 
contrary, as I do know them to be true, I 
am more and more coming to be able to 
believe anything anybody says or guesses 
about ants! Which is, of course, not a 
good attitude for a professor! 

Ur. Wheeler, this New York student of 
ants, is putting a great deal of what he 
knows about ants into a large book which, 
when published, will make a whole shelf- 
ful of green, red, blue, and yellow fairy 




books hide their faded colors in shame. 
For tellers of fairy tales cannot even think 
of things as extraordinary and strange as 
the things that ants actually do! 

But what a prosaic lecture this story of 
the animated honey-jars has come to be. 
Mary is long ago asleep, curled up in a big 
leather arm-chair in my study, and I sit 
here in the falling dusk, straining my be- 
spectacled eyes to write what will, I am 
afraid, only put other little girls to slcej). 
Which is not at all my idea in writing this 
book. It is, indeed, just the opposite. It 
is to make anybody who reads it open his 
eyes. But, ¡°Schluss,¡± as my old Leipzig 
professor used to say at the end of his long 
dreary lecture. So Schluss it is! 










There are eight different kinds of oak- 
trees growing on or near the campus 
where Mary and I live. And each kind of 
oak-tree has several kinds of houses pecu- 
liar and special to it. Which makes al- 
together a great many styles and sizes of 
houses of oak for Mary and me to get 
acquai>ited with. For we have made up 
our minds to know them all, and some- 
thing about the creatures that live in 
them. This is a large undertaking, we are 
finding, but an intensely intcre.sting and 
delightful one. Some of it is quite scien- 
tific, too, which makes us proud and ser- 
ious. We are keeping notes, as we did 
about Argiope and the way it handled flies 
and bees, and some day we shall print 





these notes in the proceedings of a learned 
society, and make a real sensation in the 
scientific world. Anyway we think we 
shall. Just now, however, we shall only 
tell the very simplest things about these 
houses of oak and their inhabitants, for 
we suppose you wouldn¡¯t be interested in 
the harder things; perhaps, indeed, not 
even understand them all. 

Although, as I have already said, there 
are eight different kinds of oak-trees growing 
in our valley and mountains, two of these 
kinds, the live-oaks and the white oaks, 
are by far the most common and numer- 
ous. As one stands upon the mountain 
tops or foothills and looks down and over 
the broad valley, all still and drowsy under 
the warm afternoon sun, it seems as if you 
were looking at a single great orchard with 
the trees in it in close-set regular lines and 
plots in some places, and irregularly scat- 
tered and farther apart in other places. 
Where they are regular and close together. 



they really are orchard trees; where they 
are irregular and widely spaced and larger, 
they are the beautiful live-oaks and white 
oaks that grow in all the grain-fields and 
meadows and pastures of our valley. The 
live-oaks ha\e small lea\es, dark green 
and close together, and the lioad of the tree 
is dense and like a great ball; the white 
oaks have larger, less thickly set leaves of 
lighter green, and the branches are more 
irregular and straying and tliey often send 
down delicate pendent lines that swing 
and dance in the wind like long tassels. 
The live-oaks have leaves on all the year 
through; the white oaks lose theirs in 
November. 

In both of these kinds of trees the oak 
houses can be found, but especially in the 
white oaks. And there are, as I have 
said, many kinds of the houses. Wary 
and I have found little round ones, big 
bean-shaped ones, little star-shaped ones, 
slender cornucopia-like ones, green, whit- 





ish, rcd-stripcd, pink-spotted, smooth, 
hairy, rough-coated, spiny ones, and still 
other kinds. Some of the houses arc on 
the leaves, some on the leaf-stems, some on 
the little twigs, and some on the branches. 
Some of the houses stay in the trees all 
through the year, but most of them drop 
off in the autumn, especially in the white- 
oak trees, just as the leaves do. 

Wc go out and hunt for the houses in 
the trees and among the fallen leaves on 
the ground under the trees. They are 
sometimes, especially the little ones, hard 
to find, for their colors and shapes often 
seem to fit in with their surroundings, so 
as to make them very hard to see. But 
others, like the big ball-shaped white ones 
shown in Sekko vShiinada¡¯s picture, are, on 
the contrary, very conspicuous. If the 
houses arc on the ground, or even if they 
arc still on the tree anti wc think they are 
all through being made ¡ª and there are 
various ways of knowing about this, but 





the most important is the time of year¡ª 
Mary and 1 bring them home with us and 
put them in little bags of line cloth netting, 
tarlatan usually, the houses that arc alike 
and from one place being put together in 
a single bag. Then we tie a string around 
the mouth of the bag and wait for the 
dwellers in the houses to come out. 

For one has to be careful about trying 
to see the oak-house dwellers before they 
are ready to come out. It is much better 
to await their own sweet pleasure in this 
matter, than to go digging or prying in, 
for the houses have no doors or windows 
until just at the time the dwellers come 
out! In fact they make the doors as they 
come out. You will sec, after we tell you 
a little more, that this arrangement is a 
very good one. Even as it is, various un- 
welcome intruders find their way into the 
house much to the annoyance and even to 
the fatal disaster of the inmates. 

So we wait until the dwellers are ready 





to come out. Or if occasionally we really 
think Wit oui^ht to see how things are go- 
ing on inside, we (dioj) a house or two open 
and see what w(^ can sec. What this is, 
usually, is a house¡¯s insides very unusual 
and curious, for th(^ rooms occupy so little 
space and the walls so much. vSometimes 
thc're is only one room and that right in 
the middle, all the rest of the house being 
just a dense or sometimes loose and s]X)ngy 
wall all around it. In the single room, or 
in each of the several rooms, we lind a 
curled-up little shining white grub with- 
out legs, and of course without wings, and 
with a head that doesn¡¯t seem much like 
a head, for it has no eyes nor feelers, and 
most of the time is drawn back into the 
body of the grub so that it is hardly visi- 
ble at all. l)Ut there is a mouth on this 
silly sort of head, and the grub cats. What 
it eats is part of its own house! 

The houses, or galls, as the entomologists 
call them, are of course not actually made 




by the insects that live in them; they arc 
made by the oak-tree on which they are. 
But they are only made at the demand, 
so to speak, of the insects. Tliat is, the 
oak-galls are formed only where a gall- 
insect has pricked a live leaf or stem or 
twig with her sharp, sting-like little egg- 
layer, and has left an egg in the plant-tis- 
sue. Nor does the gall begin to foi in even 
yet. It begins only after the young gall- 
insect is hatched from the egg, or at least 
begins to devcloj) inside the egg. Then 
the gall grows rapidly. The tree s(mu1s an 
extra supply of sap to this s])()t, and the 
plant-cells multijdy, and the liousc Ixigins 
to form around the little white grub. Now 
this house or gall not only encloses and 
protects the insect, but it j)rovides it with 
food in the form of {)lant-sap and a spcicial 
mass or layer of soft nutritious plant-tis- 
sue lying right around the grub. So the 
gall-insect not only lives in the house, but 
eats it! 




After it is full-grown, the grub stops eat- 
ing. Then the house, or gall, stops grow- 
ing and becomes harder and changes from 
greenish to some other color, and, in most 
cases, pretty soon drops off the tree to the 
ground. The gall-insect is still alive in- 
side, of course, but is perfectly quiet and 
is simply waiting. It is at this time in 
the life of the houses and their dwellers 
that Mary and I collect them and bring 
them home and put them into little tar- 
latan bags. This is autumn, the time that 
the trees in the East turn yellow and red, 
but in California do not. They just stay 
green, but get quiet or turn brown or sim- 
ply drop off tlieir leaves and stand bare. 

All through the autumn and winter the 
gall-insects do nothing inside their houses. 
Indeed we can take them out and keep 
them in little \'ials, and most of them get 
on very well. They require no food; they 
simply want to be let alone. But in early 
spring ¡ª and spring in California comes 




very early; indeed, it comes in winter! ¡ª 
they wake up and in a short time change 
into stout-bodied little real insect-looking 
insects with six legs, four wings, a round 
head with feelers and eyes and whatever 
else an insect¡¯s head ouglit to have. Es- 
pecially sharp jaws. For each gall-dweller 
has now to got out of its house. And as 
there arc no doors, it has to make them. 
Which it docs with its sharp jaws, gnaw- 
ing a tunnel from the center of the house 
right out through the thick hard wall to 
the outside. 

When it gets out it flies around in lively 
manner for a few days, finally settling on 
a sprouting oak-leaf or bud or green stem 
or twig, and laying a few eggs, or several, 
or many, according to the habits of its 
special kind, and then it dies. And when 
the tiny white grubs hatch from these eggs, 
new houses begin to be made around them 
by the oak-trees, and a new generation of 
gall-insects is fairly started. 



But not all the dwellers in the houses of 
oak have such a smooth and easy life as I 
have described. There will often come 
out of one of the galls that Mary and I 
have in a tarlatan bag, not one kind of in- 
sect, but several kinds, and only one of 
these kinds is the regular proper house- 
owner. 'I'lie others are interlopers. Some 
of them may be only uninvited but not 
esi^ceially harmful guests, just other kinds 
of gall-insects that seem to have given up 
the habit ¡ª if they e\cr had it ¡ª of starting 
houses of their own, and ha\ e adopted the 
cuckoo-like way of laying their eggs in the 
just-starting houses of other gall-insects. 
The grubs, or young of these messmate 
gall-insects, live in, and feed on, the same 
house, with the rightful dwellers, but as the 
oak-tree has plenty of sap and the gall- 
house is usually large enough for all, there 
is generally no harm done by these cuckoo 
intruders. 

But some of the intruding insects that 





come from our galls are not so harmless. 
They arc the ones called parasites. They 
live in the houses not for the sak(^ of tlie 
protection or the food furnished by the 
house, but in order to eat the actual 
dwellers in the house. Often and often 
not a single real gall-insect would come 
out in the spring from many of our col- 
lected houses, but only a little swarm, or 
sometimes just two or three or even one, 
of these insect-devouring jxuasites that 
has eaten up the rightful owners of the 
houses. 

There arc other enemies, too, of the oak- 
house dwellers. ]>irds like to })ec,k into the 
soft, growing galls to get at the tidbits in- 
side. And predaceous beetles and other 
strong-] awed insects with a fondness lor 
helpless, soft-bodied, juicy grubs would 
like to gnaw into the houses. So the 
houses have to protect the dwellers inside, 
and they do this in various ways. Some 
are extra thick-walled or have an extra- 





hard outer shell. Some are covered with 
spines or hairs. Some have a viscous gluey 
excretion, some have a very bad odor, 
some are so colored and patterned that 
they are very hard to distinguish from the 
foliage or from the fallen leaves around 
them, and, finally, some secrete a sweet- 
ish honey-dew which attracts ants, and 
these fierce visitors, who are content with 
the honey-dew, jirobably drive away many 
visiting parasites and predaceous insects. 

I Jut it would be tiresome to go on and 
tell you all the things we are finding out 
about the houses of oak and the insects 
that live in them. Of how we have got 
them to lay their eggs right before our 
eyes on little fresh branches that we bring 
into the house. Of how the houses begin 
to form under the bark or leaf surface as 
mere little swellings and then break through 
and get larger and larger and take on their 
characteristic form and color. Of how we 
have to study the gall-dwellers with a mi- 




croscope, for the largest that we have found 
yet ¡ª the ones that make the big galls 
shown in Sekko's picture ¡ª are only one- 
fifth of an inch long, while others are not 
more than one-twenty-fifth of an inch long. 
Of how some kinds have to lay their eggs 
always on the same kind of oak-tree, while 
others prick different kinds of oaks. 

Nor can we tell of the questions and 
problems that we are trying to answer. 
As why it is that two galls made by two 
different kinds of gall-insects, but in the 
same parts, as leaves, of the same oak- 
tree, should be so different, or why the 
galls in different kinds of trees, though 
made by the same kind of insect, should 
be alike, as they usually are. And why 
with some kinds of the house-dwellers the 
children grow up to be different from the 
mother, but their own children grow up 
like the grandmother, and different from 
themselves. Or how they know not to lay 
too many eggs in one place, the ones mak- 




ing little galls often laying several to many 
eggs in one leaf, but the ones making large 
galls being careful to lay only one egg 
in a leaf. And a lot of other things that 
they do that need explaining. 

Perhaps we shall find out the reason for 
some of these things. But naturalists have 
known the houses of oak-insects for two 
hundred years now, and if they haven¡¯t 
found the answers to some of these (jues- 
tions yet, perhaps no one ever can. But 
that isn¡¯t a good way to look at Nature. 
And so Mary and I don¡¯t. We think we 
may make a great discovery any day. We 
are like prospectors in the gold mountains. 
We never give up; we always keep prying 
and peering. The worst of it is, I suppose 
you think, that we always keep talking 
too. Well, this is the last sentence of this 
dose of talking; or next to last. For this 
is the

of this rambling, talky, little book. 










dear little friendswhen the ten polliwogs came to spend a day with me some two years ago i promised to tell you stories of how they and their neighbors live in the pond i wanted to tell the stories at once but this is a busy world and storytelling is only play so there were many things to be done before i could sit down to my desk and hold my pen while the stories slid out of it onto paper i wonder where all my ten polliwogs are now one cannot come to know pond people quite so well as those who live in the forest or in the meadow yet down in the shining water they live and build their homes and learn much that they need to know and wherever people are living and working and playing there are stories to be found the pond people cannot be well or happy long away from the water and you can only come to know them by watching the ponds and brooks if you do that and are very quiet the minnows will swim to where you are the mud turtles will waddle out on the logs in the sunshine and you may even see a crayfish walking backward along the sand but if you should see a very large black bug with fore legs which open and shut like jackknivesthen keep away from him for that is belostoma some time you may see him under the electric lights in the city for he likes to sprawl around there and you can look at him on land but let him alone remember that the dragonflies and many of their friends who seem to do nothing but play in the sunshine have lived long in the dusky pond and that this life in the air comes only after a long time of getting ready remember that if you pick up a turtle or catch minnows in a net you must not leave the turtle on his back or keep any waterbreathing people like the minnows in the air watch them for a little while and then let them go free and then remember be sure to remember this that you are not to get acquainted with the pond people by tumbling into the water or by going into it with your shoes and stockings on if you do that your mothers will say we wish that mrs pierson had never written about the pond people and if they should say that just think how i would feel the biggest frog stretched the four toes of his right forefoot then he stretched the four toes of his left forefoot next he stretched the five toes of his right hindfoot and last of all he stretched the four toes of his left hindfoot then he stretched all seventeen toes at once he should have had eighteen toes to stretch like his friends and neighbors but something had happened to the eighteenth one a great many years before none of the pond people knew what had happened to it but something had and when the tadpoles teased him to tell them what he only stared at them with his great eyes and said my children that story is too sad to tell after the biggest frog had stretched all his toes he stretched his legs and twitched his lips he poked his head out of the mud a very very little way and saw a minnow swimming past good day said he is it time to get up time exclaimed the minnow looking at him with her mouth open i should say it was why the watercress is growing now every one who lives in a pond knows that when the watercress begins to grow it is time for all the winter sleepers to awaken the biggest frog crawled out of the mud and poked this way and that all around the spot where he had spent the cold weather wake up he said wake up wake up the water grew dark and cloudy because he kicked up so much mud but when it began to clear again he saw the heads of his friends peeping up everywhere out of that part of the pond bottom seven of them had huddled close to him all winter come out he cried the spring is here and it is no time for frogs to be asleep asleep no indeed exclaimed his sister an elderly and hardworking frog as she swam to the shore and crawled out on it she ate every bit of food that she found on the way for neither she nor any of the others had taken a mouthful since the fall before the younger frogs followed through the warmer shallow water until they were partly out of it there is always a biggest frog in every pond all the young frogs thought how fine it would be to become the biggest frog of even a very small puddle for then they could tell the others what to do now they looked at their leader and each said to himself perhaps some day i shall begin the concert the biggest frog found a comfortable place and sat down he toed in with his eight front toes as wellbred frogs do and all his friends toed in with their eight front toes he toed out with his nine back toes and all his friends toed out with their ten back toes one young yellow brown frog said how i wish i did not have that bothersome fifth toe on my left hindfoot it is so in the way besides there is such a style about having ones hind feet different he spoke just loud enough for the biggest frog to hear any one would know from this remark that he was young and foolish for when people are wise they know that the most beautiful feet and ears and bodies are just the way that they were first made to be now the biggest frog swallowed a great deal of air filled the sacs on each side of his neck with it opened his big mouth and sang croakily frogs frogs frogs frogs frogs frogs frogs frogs and all the others sang frogs frogs frogs as long as he the gulls heard it and the muskrats heard it and all were happy because spring had come a beautiful young green brown frog who had never felt grownup until now tried to sing with the others but she had not a strong voice and was glad enough to stop and visit with the biggest frogs sister dont you wish we could sing as loudly as they can said she no answered the biggest frogs sister i would rather sit on the bank and think about my spring work work first you know and pleasure afterward oh said the green brown frog then you dont want to sing until your work is done you may be very sure i dont want to sing then answered the older frog i am too tired besides after the eggs are laid there is no reason for wanting to sing why not asked the green brown frog i dont see what difference that makes that said the older frog wisely is because you are young and have never laid eggs the great time for singing is before the eggs are laid there is some singing afterward but that is only because people expect it of us and not because we have the same wish to sing after she had said all this which was a great deal for a frog to say at once she shut her big mouth and slid her eyelids over her eyes there was another question which the green brown frog wanted very much to ask but she had good manners and knew that it was impolite to speak to any frog whose eyes were not open so she closed her own eyes and tried to think what the answer would be when she opened them again the biggest frogs sister had hopped away and in her place sat the yellow brown frog the same handsome young fellow who had found one of his toes in the way it quite startled her to find him sitting so close to her and she couldnt think of anything to say so she just looked at him with her great beautiful eyes and toed in a little more with her front feet that made him look at them and see how pretty they were although of course this was not the reason why she had moved them the yellow brown frog hopped a little nearer and sang as loudly as he could frogs frogs frogs frogs frogs frogs frogs frogs then she knew that he was singing just for her and she was exceedingly happy she swallowed air very fast because she seemed to be out of breath from thinking what she should answer she had wanted to ask the biggest frogs sister what she should say if any one sang to her alone she knew that if she wanted to get away from him all she had to do was to give a great jump and splash into the water she didnt want to go away yet she made believe that she did for she hopped a little farther from him he knew she was only pretending though for she hadnt hopped more than the length of a grassblade so he followed her and kept on singing because she knew that she must say something she just opened her mouth and sang the first words that she could think of and what she sang was eggs eggs eggs eggs eggs eggs eggs eggs as it happened this was exactly what she should have sung so he knew that she liked him they stayed together for a long long time and he sang a great deal and very loudly and she sang a little and very softly after a while she remembered that she was now a fully grown frog and had spring work to do and she said to him i really must lay some eggs i am going into the water then i will go too said he and they gave two great leaps and came down with two great splashes the green brown frog laid eggs for four days and the yellow brown frog stayed with her all that time and took care of the eggs after she had laid them they were covered with a sort of green jelly which made them stick to each other as they floated in little heaps on the water the frogs thought that a good thing for then when the tadpoles hatched each would have playmates near one day after the eggs were all laid and were growing finely for frogs eggs grow until the tadpoles are ready to eat their way out the green brown frog sat alone on the bank of the pond and the biggest frogs sister came to her she had a queer smile around the corners of her mouth frogs have excellent mouths for smiling but it takes a very broad smile to go way across so when they smile a little it is only at the corners how are your eggs growing she asked oh answered the green brown frog sadly i cant tell which ones they are thats just like a young frog said the biggest frogs sister is there any reason why you should know which ones they are it isnt as though you were a bird and had to keep them warm or as though you were a mink and had to feed your children the sun will hatch them and they will feed themselves all they need i think said the green brown frog that my eggs
 were a little better than the rest yes croaked the biggest frogs sister every frog thinks that and i wanted to have my own tadpoles to look after sighed the green brown frog why asked the biggest frogs sister cant you take any comfort with a tadpole unless you laid the egg from which he was hatched i never know one of my own eggs a day after it is laid there are such a lot floating around that they are sure to get mixed but i just make the best of it how asked the green brown frog looking a little more cheerful oh i swim around and look at all the eggs and whenever i see any tadpoles moving in them i think those may be mine as they are hatched i help any one who needs it poor sort of frog it would be who couldnt like other peoples tadpoles i believe ill do that way said the green brown frog and then she added what a comfort it will be if any of them are cross or rude to think im glad i dont know that they are mine yes said the biggest frogs sister i often tell my brother that i pity people who have to bring up their own children it is much pleasanter to let them grow up as they do and then adopt the best ones do you know i have almost decided that you are my daughter my brother said this morning that he thought you looked like me one fine day in spring a great flock of sandhill cranes came from the south they were flying high and quietly because the weather was bright if it had been stormy or if they had been flying by night as they usually did they would have stayed nearer the ground and their leader would have trumpeted loudly to let his followers know which way he was going they would also have trumpeted but more softly to tell him that they were coming after they were a fine company to look upon orderly strong and dignified their long necks were stretched out straight ahead their long legs straight behind and they beat the air with slow regular strokes of the strong wings as they came near the pond they flew lower and lower until all swept down to the earth and alighted tall and stately by the edge of the water they had eaten nothing for several days and were soon hunting for food some on land and some in the water for they had stopped to feed and rest those who hunted in the water did so very quietly a crane would stand on one leg with his head against his breast so quietly that one might think him asleep but as soon as anything eatable came near he would bend his body stretch out his neck open his long slender bill and swallow it at one gulp then he would seem to fall asleep again while most of the cranes were still feeding some of them were stalking through the woods and looking this way and that flying up to stand on a tree and then flying down to stand on the ground they were those who thought of staying there for the summer when the flock arose to fly on again eight cranes stayed behind they watched their friends fly away and stood on the ground with their necks and bills uplifted and mouths open while they trumpeted or called out goodbye stop for us in the fall the flying cranes trumpeted back we will dont forget us that night they slept near together as they had done when with the large flock and one crane kept awake to watch for danger while the others tucked their heads under their wings they were fine looking even when they slept and some people never look well unless they are awake they were brownishgray with no bright markings at all and their long legs gave them a very genteel look the tops of their heads were covered with warty red skin from which grew short black feathers that looked more like hairs one morning when the cranes awakened a fine young fellow began to strut up and down before the rest bowing low and leaping high into the air and every now and then whooping as loudly as he could the gulls who had spent the winter by the pond screamed to each other the crane dance has begun even the frogs who are afraid of cranes crept quietly near to look on it was not long before another young crane began to skip and hop and circle around drooping his wings and whooping as he went every crane danced brothers and sisters and all and as they did so they looked lovingly at each other and admired the fine steps and enjoyed the whooping this went on until they were so tired they could hardly stand and had to stop to eat and rest when they were eating the young fellow who had begun the dance stalked up to the sister of one of his friends as she stood in the edge of the pond gracefully balanced on one leg she did not turn her head towards him although having such a long and slender neck she could have done so with very little trouble she stood with her head on her breast and looked at the water after a while he trumpeted softly as though he were just trying his voice then she gave a pretty little start and said oh are you here how you did frighten me i am sorry he said i did not want to frighten you and he looked at her admiringly it was just for a minute she answered of course i am not frightened now that i know who it is then they stood and fished for a long time without saying anything when she flew away she said that is a very pleasant fishingplace he stood on the other leg for a while and thought how sweet her voice sounded as she said it then he thought that if she liked the place so well she might come there again the next day he wondered why he could not come too although everybody knows that a crane catches more if he fishes alone the next morning when the cranes danced he bowed to her oftener than to any of the rest and he thought she noticed it they danced until they were almost too tired to move and indeed he had to rest for a while before he went to feed as she stalked off toward the pond she passed him and she said over her shoulder i should think you would be hungry i am almost starved after she had gone he wondered why she had said that if he had been an older crane and understood the ways of the world a little better he would have known that she meant arent you coming to that fishingplace i am going now still although he was such a young crane and had never danced until this year he began to think that she liked him and enjoyed having him near so he flew off to the fishingplace where he had seen her the day before and he stalked along to where she was and stood close to her while she fished once when he caught something and swallowed it at one gulp she looked admiringly at him and said what fine big mouthfuls you can take that pleased him of course because cranes think that big mouthfuls are the best kind so he tipped his head to one side and watched his neck as the mouthful slid down to his stomach he could see it from the outside a big bunch slowly moving downward he often did this while he was eating he thought it very interesting he pitied shortnecked people then he said pooh i can take bigger mouthfuls than that you ought to see what big mouthfuls i can take she changed and stood on her other leg i saw you dancing this morning she said now it was not at all queer that she should have seen him dancing for all the eight cranes had danced together but he thought it very wonderful did you notice to whom i bowed he asked he was so excited that his knees shook and he had to stand on both legs at once to keep from falling when a crane is as much excited as that it is pretty serious to my sister she asked carelessly as she drew one of her long tailfeathers through her beak no said he i bowed to her sister he thought that was a very clever thing to say but she suddenly raised her head and said there i have forgotten something and flew off as she had done the day before he wondered what it was long afterward he asked her what she had forgotten and she said she couldnt rememberthat she never could remember what she had forgotten it made him feel very badly to have her leave him so he wanted a chance to tell her something yet whenever he tried to it seemed to stick in his bill he began to fear that she didnt like him and the next time the cranes danced he didnt bow to her so much but he strutted and leaped and whooped even more and she strutted and leaped and whooped almost as loudly as he when they were all tired out and had stopped dancing she said to him i am so tired let us go off into the woods and rest you may be very sure he was glad to go and as he stalked off with her he led the way to a charming nestingplace he didnt know just how to tell what he wanted to but he had seen another crane bowing to her and was afraid she might marry him if he was not quick now he pointed with one wing to this nestingplace and said how would you like to build a nest there she looked where he had pointed i she said why it is a lovely place but i could never have a nest alone let me help you he said i want to marry and have a home why said she as she preened her feathers that is a very good plan when did you think of it so they were married and mrs sandhill crane often told her friends afterward that mr crane was so much in love with her that she just had to marry him they were very very happy and after a whilebut that is another story when i grow up said one young minnow i am going to be a bullhead and scare all the little fishes im not said his sister im going to be a sucker and lie around in the mud lazy lazy cried the other young minnows wiggling their front fins at her what is the matter asked a father minnow swimming in among them with a few graceful sweeps of his tail and stopping himself by spreading his front fins he had the beautiful scarlet coloring on the under part of his body which father minnows wear in the summertime that is most of them do but some wear purple what is the matter he asked again balancing himself with his top fin and his two hind ones then all the little minnows spoke at once he says that when he grows up he is going to be a bullhead and frighten all the small fishes and she
 says that she is going to be a sucker and lie around in the mud and we say that suckers are lazy and they are lazy arent they i am surprised at you began the father minnow severely to think that you should talk such nonsense you ought to know but just then a mother minnow swam up to him the snapping turtle is looking for you she said father minnow hurried away and she turned to the little ones i heard what you were saying she remarked with a twinkle in her flat round eyes which of you is going to be a wild duck wont somebody be a frog she had had more experience in bringing up children than father minnow and she didnt scold so much she did make fun of them though sometimes and you can do almost anything with a young minnow if you love him a great deal and make fun of him a little whyee said the young minnows we wouldnt think of being wild ducks and we couldnt be frogs you know frogs have legsfour of them a fish couldnt be a frog if he wanted to no said mother minnow a fish cannot be anything but a fish and a minnow cannot be anything but a minnow so if you will try to be just as good minnows as you can we will let the little bullheads and suckers do their own growing up she looked at them all again with her flat round eyes which saw so much and were always open because there was nothing to make them shut she saw one tiny fellow hiding behind his brother have you torn your fin again she asked yesm just a little said he a boy caught me when he was in wading and i tore it when i flopped away from him dreadful said she how you do look if you are so careless you will soon not have a whole fin to your backor your front either children you must remember to swim away from boys when the cows wade in to drink you may stay among them if you wish they are friendly we pond people are afraid of boys although some of them are said not to be dangerous pooh said one young minnow all the pond people are not so afraid the bloodsuckers say they like them the mother minnow looked very severe when he said this but she only replied very well when you are a bloodsucker you may stay near boys as long as you are a minnow you must stay away now she added swim along the whole school of you i am tired and want a nap in the pondweed so they all swam away and she wriggled her silvery brown body into the soft green weeds and had a good sleep she was careful to hide herself for there were some people in the pond whom she did not want to have find her and being a fish she could not hear very distinctly if they came near of course her eyes were open even when she was asleep because she had no eyelids but they were not working although they were open that is an uncomfortable thing about being a fishone cannot hear much one cannot taste much either or feel much yet when one has always been a fish and is used to it it is not so hard she slept a long time and then the whole school of young minnows came to look for her we are afraid they cried we feel so very queerly we dont know how we feel either and that is the worst part of it it might be in our stomachs or it might be in our fins and perhaps there is something wrong with our gillcovers wake up and tell us what is the matter the mother minnow awakened and she felt queerly too but being older she knew what was the matter that she said is the storm feeling but said the young minnows there isnt any storm no she answered wisely not now and there hasnt been any they said no she answered again the storm you feel is the storm that is going to be and shall we always feel it so they asked always before a storm she said why asked the young minnows because said she there is no answer to that question but just because when the storm comes you cannot smell your food and find it so you must eat all you can before then eat everything you can find and be quick as she spoke she took a great mouthful of pondweed and swallowed it all but one of the young minnows swam quickly away to do as she had told them to this young minnow wanted to know just how and why and all about it so he stayed to ask questions you know there are some questions which fishes cannot answer and some which oxen cannot answer and some which nobody can answer and when the mother minnow told the young minnows what she did she had nothing more to tell but there are some young minnows who never will be satisfied and who tease and tease and tease and tease hurry along and eat all you can said the mother minnow to him again i want to know said he opening his mouth very wide indeed and breathing in a great deal of water as he spoke i want to know where i feel queerly i cant tell said the mother minnow between mouthfuls no fish can tell well what makes me feel queerly there the storm said she how does it make me feel queerly i dont know said the mother minnow who does know asked the young minnow nobody said she swallowing some more pondweed of one kind and then beginning on another do eat something or you will be very hungry by and by well why does a storm make me feel so asked he because said she she said it very firmly and she was quite right in saying it then for there was a cause yet she could not tell what it was there are only about seven times in ones life when it is right to answer in this way and what the other six are you must decide for yourself just then there was a peal of thunder which even a minnow could hear and the wind blew until the slender forest trees bent far over the rain came down in great drops which pattered on the water of the pond and started tiny circles around each drop every circle spreading wider and wider until it touched other circles and broke down in the darkened water the fishes lay together on the bottom and wondered how long it would last and hoped it would not be a great great while before they could smell their food again one little fellow was more impatient than the others didnt you eat enough to last you they said i didnt eat anything he answered not anything they exclaimed why not because said he and that was not right for he did know the reason his mother looked at him and he looked at her and she had a twinkle in her round flat eyes poor child she thought he must be hungry but she said nothing nobody can truthfully say that the sticklebacks are not good fathers there are no other fish fathers who work so hard for their children as the sticklebacks do as to the stickleback motherswell that is different this particular stickleback father had lived ever since he had left the nest with a little company of his friends in a quiet place near the edge of the pond sometimes when they tired of staying quietly at home they had made short journeys up a brook that emptied into the pond it was a brook that flowed gently over an even bed else they would never have gone there for sticklebacks like quiet waters when they swam in this little stream they met the brook trout who were much larger than they and who were the most important people there now this stickleback was a year old and knew much more than he did the summer before when the alder tassels and pussy willows hung over the edge of the pond in the springtime he began to think seriously of life he was no longer really young and the days were past in which he was contented to just swim and eat and sleep it was time he should build a home and raise a family if he wanted to ever be a grandfather he had a few relatives who were greatgrandfathers and one who was a greatgreatgrandfather that does not often happen because to be a stickleback greatgreatgrandfather one must be four years old and few sticklebacks live to that age as he began to think about these things he left the company of his friends and went to live by himself he chose a place near the edge of the pond to be his home and he brushed the pondbottom there with his tail until he had swept away all the loose sticks and broken shells he told some pond snails who were there that they must move away because he wanted the place at first they didnt want to go but when they saw how fierce he looked they thought about it again and decided that perhaps there were other places which would suit them quite as wellindeed they might find one that they liked even better besides as one of them said to his brother they had to remember that in ponds it is always right for the weak people to give up to the strong people it will take us quite a while to move they said to him for you know we cannot hurry but we will begin at once all the rest of that day each snail was lengthening and shortening his one foot which was his only way of walking you can see how slow that must be for a snail cannot lift his foot from one place and put it down in another or he would have nothing to stand on while he was lifting it this was a very hard day for them yet they were cheerful and made the best of it well said one as he stopped to rest his foot im glad we dont have to build a home when we do find the right place how i pity people who have to do that yes said his brother there are not many so sure of their homes as we and what people want of so much room i cant understand a muskrat told me he wanted room to turn around in his house i dont see what use there is in turning round do you no answered the other snail beginning to walk again it is just one of his silly ideas my shell is big enough to let me draw in my whole body and that is house room enough for any person the stickleback had not meant to look fierce at the pond snails he had done so because he couldnt help it all his fins were bristling with sharp points of bone and he had extra bonepoints sticking out of his back besides wearing a great many of his flat bones on the outside all his family had these extra bones and that was why they were called sticklebacks they were a brave family and not afraid of many things although they were so small there came a time when the stickleback father
 wanted to look fierce but that was later now he went to work to build his nest first he made a little hollow in the pondbottom and lined it with watergrass and tiny pieces of roots next he made the sidewalls of the same things and last of all the roof when it was done he swam carefully into it and looked around under and beside and over him were soft grasses and roots at each end was an open doorway it is a good nest he said a very good nest for my first one now i must ask some of my friends to lay eggs in it for me before doing this he went to look at the homes built by his neighbors after he left the company in the quiet pool many others did the same until the only sticklebacks left there were the dullcolored ones the egglayers the nestbuilders had been dullcolored too but in the springtime there came beautiful red and blue markings on their bodies until now they were very handsome fellows it is sad to tell still it is true that they also became very cross at this time perhaps it was the work and worry of nestbuilding that made them so yet whatever it was every brightcolored stickleback wanted to fight every other brightcolored stickleback that was how it happened that when this one went to look at the nest of an old friend with whom he had played ever since he was hatched this same friend called out dont you come near my nest the visiting stickleback replied i shall if i want to then they swam at each other and flopped and splashed and pushed and jabbed until both were very tired and sore and each was glad to stay by his own home this was the time when they wanted to look fierce  soon the dullcolored sticklebacks came swimming past waving their tails gracefully and talking to each other now this fine fellow who had sent the snails away and built his nest who had fought his old friend and come home again swam up to a dullcolored stickleback and said wont you lay a few eggs in my nest im sure you will find it comfortable she answered why yes i wouldnt mind laying a few there and she tried to look as though she had not expected the invitation while she was carefully laying the eggs in the nest he stood ready to fight anybody who disturbed her she came out after a while and swam away before she went she said arent you ashamed to fight so we dullcolored ones never fight she held her fins very stiff as she spoke because she thought it her duty to scold him the dullcolored sticklebacks often did this they thought that they were a little better than the others so they swam around together and talked about things and sometimes forgot how hard it was to be the nestbuilder and stay at home and work then they called upon the brightcolored sticklebacks for they really liked them very much and told them what they should do that was why this one said we dullcolored ones never fight have you ever been red and blue asked the nestbuilder nno said she but i dont see what difference that makes well it does make a difference said he when a fellow is red and blue he cant help fighting ill be as goodnatured as any of you after i stop being red and blue of course she could not say anything more after that so she swam off to her sisters the brightcolored stickleback looked at the eggs she had laid they were sticky like the eggs of all fishes so that they stuck to the bottom of the nest he covered them carefully and after that he was really a stickleback father it is true that he did not have any stickleback children to swim around him and open their dear little mouths at him but he knew that the eggs would hatch soon and that after he had built a nest and covered the eggs in it the tiny sticklebacks were beginning to grow however he wanted more eggs in his nest so he watched for another dullcolored stickleback and called her in to help him he did this until he had almost an hundred eggs there and all this time he had fought every brightcolored stickleback who came near him he became very tired indeed but he had to fight you know because he was red and blue and he had covered all the eggs and guarded them else they would never have hatched the dullcolored sticklebacks were also tired they had been swimming from nest to nest laying a few eggs in each now they went off together to a quiet pool and ate everything they could find to eat and visited with each other and said it was a shame that the brightcolored sticklebacks had fought so and told how they thought little sticklebacks should be brought up and now the red and blue markings on the stickleback father grew paler and paler until he did not have to fight at all and could call upon his friends and see how their children were hatching one fine day his first child broke the shell and then another and another until he had an hundred beautiful stickleback babies to feed he worked hard for them and some nights when he could stop and rest his fins ached as though they would drop off but they never did as the stickleback children grew stronger they swam off to take care of themselves and he had less to do when the last had gone he left the old nest and went to the pool where the dullcolored sticklebacks were they told him he was not looking well and that he hadnt managed the children right and that they thought he tried to do too much he was too tired to talk about it so he just said perhaps and began to eat something yet down in his fatherly heart he knew it was worth doing he knew too that when spring should come once more he would become red and blue again and build another nest and fight and work and love as he had done before there is nothing in the world better than working for ones own little sticklebacks said he when the caddis fly felt like laying eggs she crawled down the stalk of one of the pond plants and laid them there she covered them with something sticky so that they were sure to stay where she put them there she said as she crawled up to the air again my work is done soon after this she lay down for a long long rest what with flying and visiting and laying eggs she had become very tired and it was not strange for she had not eaten a mouthful since she got her wings this had puzzled the dragonflies very much they could not understand it because they were always eating they would have liked to ask her about it but they went to sleep for the night soon after she got up and whenever she saw them coming she flew away i do not seem to feel hungry said she so why should i eat besides she added i couldnt eat if i wanted to my mouth is so small and weak i ate a great deal while i was growingquite enough to last meand it saves time not to bother with hunting food now when her eggs hatched the larvæ were slender soft sixfooted babies called caddis worms they were white and they showed as plainly in the water as a pondlily does on the top of it it is not safe to be white if one is to live in the water certainly not unless one can swim fast and turn quickly and there is a reason for this as any one of the pond people will tell you even the fishes wear all their white on the under side of their bodies so that if they swim near the top of the water a hungry fish hawk is not so likely to see them and pounce down on them the caddis worms soon found that white was not a good color to wear and they talked of it among themselves they were very bright larvæ one day the biggest one was standing on a stem of pickerelweed when his sister came toward him she did not come very fast because she was neither swimming nor walking but biting herself along all the caddis worms did this at times for their legs were weak she reached as far forward as she could and fastened her strong jaws in the weed then she gave a jerk and pulled her body ahead it is a very good way to travel said she and such a saving of ones legs now she was in so great a hurry that sometimes when she pulled herself ahead she turned a halfsomersault and came down on her back what is the matter called the biggest caddis worm dont hurry so there is lots of time that was just him for he was lazy everybody said so i must hurry said she and she breathed very fast with the white breathing hairs that grew on both sides of her body she picked herself up from her last somersault and stood beside her brother near enough to speak quite softly i have been getting away from belostoma she said and i was dreadfully afraid he would catch me well youre all right now arent you asked her brother and that was also like him as long as he could have enough to eat and was comfortable he did not want to think about anything unpleasant no im not she answered and i wont be so long as any hungry fish or waterbug can see me so plainly im tired of being white you are not so white as you were said her brother none of us children are our heads and the front part of our bodies are turning brown and getting harder that was true and he was particularly hardheaded yes but what about the rest of us said she and surely there was some excuse for her if she was impatient if belostoma can see part of me and chase that he will find the rest of me rather near by keep quiet then and see if you dont get hard and brown all over said he i never shall said she i went to the clams and asked them if i would and they said no im going to build a house to cover the back part of my body and youd better do the same thing the biggest caddis worm looked very much surprised whatever made you think of that said he i suppose because there wasnt anything else to think of said she one has to think of something i dont said he she started away to where her other brothers and sisters were where are you going cried he going to build my house answered she youd better come too not now said he i am waiting to get the rest of my breakfast ill come by and by the biggest caddis worm stood on the pickerelweed and ate his breakfast then he stood there a while longer i do not think it is well to work right
 after eating he said below him in the water his brothers and sisters were busily gathering tiny sticks stones and bits of broken shell with which to make their houses each caddis worm found his own and fastened them together with a sort of silk which he pulled out of his body they had nobody to show them how so each planned to suit himself and no two were exactly alike im going to make my house big enough so i can pull in my head and legs when i want to said one so am i cried all the other caddis worms after a while somebody said im going to have an open door at the back of my house then each of his busy brothers and sisters cried so am i when the tiny houses were done each caddis worm crawled inside of his own and lay with head and legs outside the front door the white part of their bodies did not show at all and if they wanted to do so they could pull their heads in even belostoma the giant waterbug might have passed close to them then and not seen them at all lets hook ourselves in cried one caddis worm and all the others answered lets so each hooked himself in with the two stout hooks which grew at the end of his body and there they were as snug and comfortable as clams about this time the big brother came slowly along the stem of pickerelweed what said he you havent got your houses done already yes answered the rest joyfully see us pull in our heads and they all pulled in their heads and poked them out again he was the only whitebodied person in sight i must have a home said he i wish one of you worms would give me yours you could make yourself another you know there is lots more stuff make it yourself they replied help yourself to stuff but i dont know how he said and you do whose fault is that asked his sister then she was afraid that he might think her cross and she added quickly well tell you how if youll begin the biggest caddis worm got together some tiny sticks and stones and pieces of broken shell but it wasnt very much fun working alone then they told him what to do and how to fasten them to each other with silk be sure you tie them strongly they said oh thats strong enough he answered itll do anyhow if it comes to pieces i can fix it his brothers and sisters thought he should make it stouter yet they said nothing more for he would not have liked it if they had and they had already said so once when he crawled into his house and hooked himself in there was not a caddis worm in sight and they were very proud to think how they had planned and built their houses they did not know that caddis worms had always done so and they thought themselves the first to ever think of such a thing the biggest caddis worms house was not well fastened together and every day he said i really must fix it tomorrow but when tomorrow came it always proved to be today and besides he usually found something more interesting to be done it took him a great deal of time to change his skin and that could not be easily put off he grew so fast that he was likely to awaken almost any morning and find his head poking through the top of his skin and lazy as he was he would not have the pond people see him around with a crack in the skin of his head right where it showed so when this happened he always pulled his body through the crack and threw the old skin away there was sure to be a whole new one underneath you know when they had changed their skin many times the caddis worms became more quiet and thoughtful at last the sister who had first planned to build houses fastened hers to a stone and spun gratings across both its front and its back doors i am going to sleep she said to grow my feelers and get ready to fly and breathe air i dont want anybody to awaken me all i want to do is to sleep and grow and breathe the water will come in through the gratings so i shall be all right i couldnt sleep in a house where there was not plenty of fresh water to breathe then she cuddled down and dozed off and when her brothers and sisters spoke of her they called her the caddis nymph they did not speak of her many times however for they soon fastened their houses to something solid and spun gratings in their doorways and went to sleep one day a wateradder came around where all the caddis houses were umhum said he to himself there used to be a nice lot of caddis worms around here and now i havent seen one in ever so long i suppose they are hidden away somewhere asleep well i must go away from here and find my dinner i am nearly starved the front half of my stomach hasnt a thing in it he whisked his tail and went away but that whisk hit a tiny house of sticks stones and bits of broken shell and a fat sleeping caddis nymph rolled out it was the biggest brother soon belostoma the giant waterbug came that way what is this he exclaimed as he saw the sleeping caddis nymph somebody built a poor house to sleep in you need to be cared for young caddis he picked up the sleeping caddis nymph in his stout forelegs and swam off nobody knows just what happened after that when the other caddis nymphs awakened they bit through their gratings and had a good visit before they crawled out of the pond into their new home the air has anybody seen my biggest brother asked one nymph of another but everybody answered no each looked all around with his two farapart eyes and then they decided that he must have awakened first and left the water before them but you know that he could not have done so because he could never be a caddis fly unless he finished the nymphsleep in his house and he did not do that he had stopped being a caddis worm when he turned into a caddis nymph nobody will ever know just what did become of him unless belostoma tellsand belostoma is not likely to tell it was a bright warm april day when the first tadpole of the season ate his way out of the jellycovered egg in which he had come to life he was a very tiny dark brown fellow it would be hard to tell just what he did look like for there is nothing in the world that one tadpole looks like unless it is another tadpole he had a very small head with a busy little mouth opening on the front side of it just above each end of this mouth was a shining black eye and on the lower side of his head was a very wiggly tail somewhere between his head and the tip of this were his small stomach and places for legs but one could not see all that in looking at him it seemed as if what was not head was tail and what was not tail was head when the first tadpole found himself free in the water he swam along by the great green floating jellymass of frogs eggs and pressed his face up close to first one egg and then another he saw other tadpoles almost as large as he and they were wriggling inside their egg homes he couldnt talk to them through the jellymasshe could only look at them and they looked greenish because he saw them through green jelly they were really dark brown like him he wanted them to come out to play with him and he tried to show them that it was more interesting where he was so he opened and shut his hard little jaws very fast and took big tadpolemouthfuls of green jelly perhaps it was seeing this and perhaps it was because the warm sunshine made them restlessbut for some reason the shutin tadpoles nibbled busily at the eggcovering and before long were in the water with their brother they all looked alike and nobody except that one particular tadpole knew who had been the first to hatch he never forgot it and indeed why should he if one has ever been the first tadpole he is quite sure to remember the loneliness of it all his life soon they dropped to the bottom of the pond and met their neighbors they were such little fellows that nobody paid much attention to them the older pond people often seemed to forget that the tadpoles heard what they said and cared too the minnows swam in and out among them and hit them with their fins and slapped them with their tails and called them littlebigmouths and the tadpoles couldnt hit back because they were so little the minnows didnt hurt the tadpoles but they made fun of them and even the smallest minnow would swim away if a tadpole tried to play with him then the eels talked among themselves about them i shall be glad said one old father eel when these youngsters hide their breathinggills and go to the top of the water so shall i exclaimed a mother eel they keep their tails wiggling so that it hurts my eyes to look at them why cant they lie still and be good now the tadpoles looked at each other with their shining black eyes what are our breathinggills they asked they must be these little things on the sides of our heads they are cried the first tadpole the biggest frog said so but i dont see where we can hide them because they wont come off and how could we ever breathe water without them hear the children talk exclaimed the green brown frog who had come down to look the tadpoles over and decide which were hers why you wont always want to breathe water before long you will have to breathe air by swallowing it and then you cannot stay long under water i must go now i am quite out of breath goodbye then the tadpoles looked again at each other she didnt tell us what to do with our breathinggills they said one of the tadpoles who had hatched last swam up to the first tadpole your breathinggills are not so large as mine she said they surely are he exclaimed for he felt very big indeed having been the first to hatch oh but they are not cried all his friends they dont stick out as they used to and that was true for his breathinggills were sinking into his head and they found that this was happening to all the older tadpoles the next day they began going to the top to breathe air the oldest ones first and so on until they were all there they thought it much pleasanter than the bottom of the pond but it was not so safe there were more dangers to be watched for here and some
 of the careless young tadpoles never lived to be frogs it is sad yet it is always so sometimes the frogs came to see them and onceonce after the tadpoles had gotten their hindlegs the biggest frog sat in the marsh near by and told them stories of his tadpolehood he said that he was always a very good little tadpole and always did as the frogs told him to do and that he was such a promising little fellow that every mother frog in the pond was sure that he had been hatched from one of her eggs and were you asked one tadpole who never listened carefully and so was always asking stupid questions the biggest frog looked at him very sternly no said he i was not each wanted me as her son but i never knew to which i belonged i never knew still he added it does not so much matter who a frogs mother is if the frog is truly great then he filled the sacs on each side of his neck with air and croaked loudly his sister afterward told the tadpoles that he was thinking of one of the forest people the ground hog who was very proud because he could remember his grandfather the green brown frog came often to look at them and see how they were growing she was very fond of the first tadpole why you have your forelegs she exclaimed one morning how you do grow what will i have next he asked more legs or another tail the green brown frog smiled the whole length of her mouth and that was a very broad smile indeed look at me she said what change must come next to make you look like a frog you havent any tail he said slowly is that all the difference between us tadpoles and frogs that is all the difference now she answered but it will take a long long time for your tail to disappear it will happen with that quite as it did with your breathinggills you will grow bigger and bigger and bigger and it will grow smaller and smaller and smaller until some day you will find yourself a frog she shut her mouth to get her breath because you know frogs can only breathe a little through their skins and then only when they are wet most of their air they take in through their noses and swallow with their mouths closed that is why they cannot make long speeches when their mouths are open they cannot swallow air after a while she spoke again it takes as many years to make a newly hatched tadpole into a fully grown frog she said as there are toes on one of your hindfeet the first tadpole did not know what a year was but he felt sure from the way in which she spoke that it was a long long time and he was in a hurry to grow up i want to be a frog sooner he said crossly it isnt any fun at all being a tadpole the green brown frog swam away he was becoming so disagreeable the first tadpole became crosser and crosser and was very unreasonable he did not think of the pleasant things which happened every day but only of the trying ones he did not know that frogs often wished themselves tadpoles again and he sulked around in the pondweed all day every time he looked at one of his hindfeet it reminded him of what the green brown frog had said and he even grew out of patience with his tailthe same strong wiggly little tail of which he had been so proud horrid old thing he said giving it a jerk wont i be glad to get rid of you then he thought of somethingfoolish vain little first tadpole that he was he thought and he thought and he thought and he thought and when his playmates swam around him he wouldnt chase them and when they asked him what was the matter he just answered oh nothing as carelessly as could be the truth was that he wanted to be a frog right away and he thought he knew how he could be he didnt want to tell the other tadpoles because he didnt want any one else to become a frog as soon as he after a while he swam off to see the snapping turtle he was very much afraid of the snapping turtle and yet he thought him the best one to see just now i came to see if you would snap off my tail said he your what said the snapping turtle in his most surprised way my tail answered the first tadpole who had never had a tail snapped off and thought it could be easily done i want to be a frog today and not wait certainly said the snapping turtle with pleasure no trouble at all anything else i can do for you no thank you said the first tadpole only you wont snap off too much will you not a bit answered the snapping turtle with a queer look in his eyes and if any of your friends are in a hurry to grow up i shall be glad to help them then he swam toward the first tadpole and did as he had been asked to do the next morning all the other tadpoles crowded around to look at the first tadpole whyee they cried where is your tail i dont know he answered but i think the snapping turtle could tell you what is this asked the green brown frog swimming up to them did the snapping turtle try to catch you you poor little fellow how did it happen she was very fond of the first tadpole and had about decided that he must be one of her sons well he said slowly for he didnt want the other tadpoles to do the same thing i met him last evening and he snapped at you exclaimed the green brown frog it is lucky for you that he doesnt believe in eating hearty suppers that is all i have to say but you are a very foolish tadpole not to keep out of his way as you have always been told you must then the first tadpole lost his temper im not foolish and im not a tadpole he said i asked him to snap it off and now i am a frog oho said the voice of the yellow brown frog behind him you are a frog are you lets hear you croak then come out on the bank and have a hopping match with me ii dont croak yet stammered the first tadpole aand i dont care to hop you are just a tailless tadpole said the yellow brown frog sternly dont any more of you youngsters try such a plan or some of you will be tadpoleless tails and a good many of you wont be anything the old snapping turtle waited all morning for some more tadpoles who wanted to be made into frogs but none came the biggest frog croaked hoarsely when he heard of it tails tails tails tails tails tails tails tails said he that youngster will never be a strong frog tadpoles must be tadpoles tails and all for a long time if they hope to ever be really fine frogs like me and that is so as any frog will tell you the green brown frog sighed as she crawled out on the bank what a silly tadpole she said im glad he isnt my child when the little water spiders first opened their eyes and this was as soon as they were hatched they found themselves in a cosy home of one room which their mother had built under the water this room had no window and only one door there was no floor at all when father stickleback had asked mrs spider why she did not make a floor she had looked at him in great surprise and said why if i had built one i should have no place to go in and out she really thought him quite stupid not to think of that it often happens you know that really clever people think each other stupid just because they live in different ways afterward mrs water spider saw father sticklebacks nest and understood why he asked that question when her home was done it was half as large as a big acorn and a charming place for water spider babies the side walls and the rounding ceiling were all of the finest spider silk and the bottom was just one round doorway the house was built under the water and fastened down by tiny ropes of spider silk which were tied to the stems of pond plants mrs water spider looked at it with a happy smile next i must fill it with air said she and then it will be ready i am out of breath now she crept up the stem of the nearest plant and sat in the air for a few minutes eating her lunch and resting next she walked down the stem until just the end of her body was in the air she stood so with her head down then gave a little jerk and dove to her home as she jerked she crossed her hindlegs and caught a small bubble of air between them and her body when she reached her home she went quickly in the open doorway and let go of her bubble it did not fall downward to the floor as bubbles do in most houses and there were two reasons for this in the first place there was no floor in the second place air always falls upward in the water this fell up until it reached the rounded ceiling and had to stop just as it fell a drop of water went out through the open doorway the home had been full of water you know but now that mrs spider had begun to bring in air something had to be moved to make a place for it she brought down thirteen more bubbles of air and then the house was filled with it on the lower side of the open doorway there was water and on the upper side was air and each stayed where it should when mrs spider came into her house she always had some air caught in the hairs which covered her body even when she did not bring a bubble of it in her hindlegs she had to have plenty of it in her home to keep her from drowning for she could not breathe water like a fish side doors may be all right for sticklebacks said she for they do not need air but i must have bottom doors and i will have them too after she had laid her eggs she had some days in which to rest and visit with the waterboatmen who lived near they were great friends belostoma used to ask the waterboatmen who were his cousins why they were so neighborly with the water spiders i dont like to see you so much with eightlegged people he said they are not our kind belostoma was very proud of his family we know that they have rather too many legs to look well said mrs waterboatman but they are pleasant and we are interested in the same things you know we both carry air about with us in the water and so few of our neighbors seem to care anything for it she was a sensible little person and knew that people who are really fond of their friends do not care how many legs they have she carried her air under her wings but there
 were other waterboatmen near relatives who spread theirs over their whole bodies and looked very silvery and beautiful when they were under water one day when mrs water spider was sitting on a lilypad and talking with her friends a waterboatman rose quickly from the bottom of the pond as soon as he got right side up and that means as soon as he got to floating on his back he said to her i heard queer sounds in your house i was feeding near there and the noise startled me so that i let go of the stone i was holding to and came up i think your eggs must be hatching really exclaimed mrs water spider i shall be so glad a house always seems lonely to me without children she dove to her house and found some very fine water spider babies there you may be sure she did not have much time for visiting after that she had to hunt food and carry it down to her children and when they were restless and impatient she stayed with them and told them stories of the great world sometimes they teased to go out with her but this she never allowed wait until you are older she would say it will not be so very long before you can go safely the children thought it had been a long long time already and one of them made a face when his mother said this she did not see him and it was well for him that she did not he should have been very much ashamed of himself for doing it the next time mrs water spider went for food one of the children said i tell you what lets do lets all go down to the doorway and peek out they looked at each other and wondered if they dared that was something their mother had forbidden them to do there was no window to look through and they wanted very much to see the world at last the little fellow who had made a face said im going to anyway after that his brothers and sisters went too and this shows how if good little spiders listen to naughty little spiders they become naughty little spiders themselves all the children ran down and peeked around the edge of the door but they couldnt see much besides water and they had seen that before they were sadly disappointed somebody said im going to put two of my legs out somebody else said ill put four out a big brother said im going to put six out and then another brother said ill put eight out dare you to you know what naughty little spiders would be likely to do then well they did it and as it happened they had just pulled their last legs through the open doorway when a stickleback father came along arent you rather young to be out of the nest said he in his most pleasant voice poor little water spiders they didnt know he was one of their mothers friends and he seemed so big to them and the bones on his cheeks made him look so queer and the stickles on his back were so sharp that every one of them was afraid and let go of the wall of the houseand then every one of them rose quickly to the top into the light and the open air they crawled upon a lilypad and clung there frightened and feeling weak in all their knees the dragon flies flew over them the wild ducks swam past them and on a log not far away they saw a long row of mud turtles sunning themselves why nothing dreadful happened one cannot tell perhaps it was bad enough as it was for they were so scared that they could only huddle close together and cry we want our mother here mrs water spider found them she came home with something for dinner and saw her house empty of course she knew where to look for as she said if they stepped outside the door they would be quite sure to tumble up into the air she took them home one at a time and how she ever did it nobody knows when they were all safely there and had eaten the food that was waiting for them mrs spider who had not scolded them at all said look me straight in the eye every one of you will you promise never to run away again instead of saying at once yes mother as they should have done one of them answered why we didnt run away we were just peeking around the edge of the doorway and we got too far out and somebody came along and scared us so that we let go and then we couldnt help falling up into the air oh no said their mother you couldnt help it then of course but who told you that you might peep out of the door the little water spiders hung their heads and looked very much ashamed their mother went on you neednt say that you were not to blame you were to blame and you began to run away as soon as you took the first step toward the door only you didnt know that you were going so far tell me she said whether you would ever have gone to the top of the water if you had not taken that first step the little water spiders were more ashamed than ever but they had to look her in the eye and promise to be good it is very certain that not one of those children even peeped around the edge of the doorway from that day until their mother told them that they might go into the world and build houses for themselves remember just one thing she said as they started away always take your food home to eat and they always did for no water spider who has been well brought up will ever eat away from his own home when the twenty little mud turtles broke their eggshells one hot summer day and poked their way up through the warm sand in which they had been buried they looked almost as much alike as so many raindrops the mother turtle who was sunning herself on the bank near by said to her friends why there are my children did you ever see a finer family i believe i will go over and speak to them most of the young mud turtles crawled quickly out of the sand and broken shells and began drying themselves in the sunshine one slow little fellow stopped to look at the broken shells stubbed one of his front toes on a large piece and then sat down until it should stop aching wait for me he called out to his brothers and sisters im coming in a minute the other little turtles waited but when his toe was comfortable again and he started toward them he met a very interesting snail and talked a while with him come on said the biggest little turtle dont lets wait any longer he can catch up so they sprawled along until they came to a place where they could sit in a row on an old log and they climbed onto it and sat just close enough together and not at all too close then the slow little turtle came hurrying over the sand with a rather cross look in his eyes and putting his feet down a little harder than he needed toquite as though he were out of patience about something why didnt you turtles wait for me he grumbled i was coming right along just then the mother turtle came up good morning said she i believe you are my children the little mud turtles looked at each other and didnt say a word this was not because they were rude or bashful but because they did not know what to say and that you know was quite right for unless one has something worth saying it is far better to say nothing at all she drew a long mud turtle breath and answered her own question yes she said you certainly are for i saw you scrambling out of the sand a little while ago and you came from the very place where i laid my eggs and covered them during the first really warm nights this year i was telling your father only yesterday that it was about time for you to hatch the sun has been so hot lately that i was sure you would do well the mother turtle stretched her head this way and that until there was hardly a wrinkle left in her neckskin she was so eager to see them all why are you not up here with your brothers and sisters she asked suddenly of the slow little turtle who was trying to make a place for himself on the log they didnt wait for me he said i was coming right along but they wouldnt wait i think they are just as mea the mother turtle raised one of her forefeet until all five of its toes with their strong claws were pointing at him she also raised her head as far as her upper shell would let her so you are the one she said i thought you were when i heard you trying to make the others wait it is too bad she looked so stern that the slow little turtle didnt dare finish what he had begun to say yet down in his little turtle heart he thought now they are going to catch it he was sure his mother was going to scold the other turtle children for leaving him he wanted to see what they would do so he looked out of his right eye at the ten brothers and sisters on that side and out of his left eye at the nine brothers and sisters on that side he could do this very easily because his eyes were not on the front of his head like those of some people but one on each side i have raised families of young turtles every year said the mother turtle the first year i had only a few children the next year i had more and so it has goneevery year a few more children than the year beforeuntil now i never know quite how many i do have but there is always one slow little turtle who lags behind and wants the others to wait for him that makes him miss his share of good things and then he is quite certain to be cross and think it is somebody elses fault the slow little turtle felt the ten brothers and sisters on his right side looking at him out of their left eyes and the nine brothers and sisters on his left side looking at him out of their right eyes he drew in his head and his tail and his legs until all they could see was his rounded upper shell his shell sidewalls and the yellow edge of his flat lower shell he would have liked to draw them in too but of course he couldnt do that i did hope said the mother turtle that i might have one family without such a child in it i cannot help loving even a slow child who is cross if he is hatched from one of my eggs yet it makes me sadvery very sad try to get over this she said to the slow little turtle before it is too late and you she added turning to his brothers and sisters must be patient with him we shall not
 have him with us long what do you mean asked the slow little turtle peeping out from between his shells im not going away you do not want to said his mother but you will not be with us long unless you learn to keep up with the rest something always happens to pond people who are too slow i cannot tell you what it will be yet it is sure to be something i remember so well my first slow childand how he she began to cry and since she could not easily get her forefeet to her eyes she sprawled to the pond and swam off with only her head and a little of her upper shell showing above the water the slow little turtle was really frightened by what his mother had said and for a few days he tried to keep up with the others nothing happened to him and so he grew careless and made people wait for him just because he was not quite ready to go with them or because he wanted to do this or look at that or talk to some other person he was a very trying little turtle yet his mother loved him and did not like it when the rest called him a land tortoise it is all right you know to be a land tortoise when your father and mother are land tortoises and these cousins of the turtles look so much like them that some people cannot tell them apart that is because they forget that the tortoises live on land have higher back shells and move very very slowly turtles live more in the water and can move quickly if they will this is why other turtles sometimes make fun of a slow brother by calling him a land tortoise one beautiful sunshiny afternoon when most of the twenty little turtles were sitting on a floating log by the edge of the pond their mother was with some of her friends on another log near by she looked often at her children and thought how handsome their roundedup back shells were in the sunshine with the little red and yellow markings showing on the black she could see their strong little pointed tails too and their webbed feet with a stout claw on each toe she was so proud that she could not help talking about them is there any sight more beautiful she said than a row of good little turtles yes said a fine old fellow who was floating near her a row of their mothers he was a turtle whom she had never liked very well but now she began to think that he was rather agreeable after all she was just noticing how beautifully the skin wrinkled on his neck when she heard a splash and saw two terrible great twolegged animals wading into the pond from the shore boys she cried boys and she sprawled off the end of her log and slid into the water all her friends following her the biggest little turtle saw these great animals coming toward him he sprawled off the end of his log and slid into the water and all his brothers and sisters followed him except the slow little turtle wait for me he said im coming in just a then one of these great animals stooped over and picked him up and held him bottom side uppermost and rapped on that side which was flat and on the other side which was rounded and stared at him with two great eyes next the other great animal took him and turned him over and rapped on his shells and stared at him the poor slow little turtle drew in his head and tail and legs and kept very very still he wished that he had sidepieces of shell all around now instead of just one on each side between his legs he was thinking over and over something has happened something has happened and he knew that back in the pond his mother would be trying to find him and could not the boys carried him to the edge of the meadow and put him down on the grass he lay perfectly still for a long long time and when he thought they had forgotten about him he tried to run away then they laughed and picked him up again and one of them took something sharp and shiny and cut marks into his upper shell this did not really give him pain yet as he said afterward it hurts almost as much to think you are going to be hurt as it does to be hurt it was not until the sun went down that the boys let the slow little turtle go then he was very very tired but he wanted so much to get back to his home in the pond that he started at once by moonlight this was the first time he had ever seen the moon for except when they are laying eggs turtles usually sleep at night he was not quite sure which way he should go and if it had not been for the kindness of the tree frog he might never have seen his brothers and sisters again you know the tree frog had been carried away when he was young before he came to live with the meadow people so he knew how to be sorry for the slow little turtle the tree frog hopped along ahead to show the way and the turtle followed until they reached a place from which they could see the pond good night said the tree frog you can find your way now good night said the turtle i wish i might help you some time never mind me said the tree frog help somebody else and it will be all right he hopped back toward his home and for a long time afterward the turtle heard his cheerful pukrrrup pukrrrup sounding over the dewy grass and through the still air at the edge of the pond the slow little turtle found his nineteen brothers and sisters sound asleep im here he cried joyfully poking first one and then another of them with his head the biggest little turtle moved without awakening i tell you im not hungry he murmured i dont want to get up and again he fell fast asleep so the slow little turtle did not disturb him but cuddled inside his two shells and went to sleep also he was so tired that he did not awaken until the sun was high in the sky when he did open his eyes his relatives were sitting around looking at him and he remembered all that had happened before he slept does my shell look very bad he cried i wish i could see it oh i am so glad to get back ill never be slow again never never his mother came and leaned her shell lovingly against his if you will only learn to keep up with your brothers and sisters she said i shall not be sorry that the boys carried you off you just wait and see said the slow little turtle and he was as good as his word after that he was always the first to slip from the log to the water if anything scared them and when one day a strange turtle from another pond came to visit he said to the turtles who had always lived there why do you call that young fellow with the marked shell the slow little turtle he is the quickest one in his family the pond people looked at each other and laughed that is queer they said after this we will call him the quick little turtle this made him very happy and when once in a while somebody forgot and by mistake called him the quick slow little turtle he said he rather liked it because it showed that a turtle neednt keep his faults if he did have them the dragonflies have always lived near the pond not the same ones that are there now of course but the greatgreatgreatgrandfathers of these a person would think that after a family had lived so long in a place all the neighbors would be fond of them yet it is not so the dragonflies may be very good peopleand even the snapping turtle says that they arestill they are so peculiar that many of their neighbors do not like them at all even when they are only larvæ or babies they are not good playmates for they have such a bad habit of putting everything into their mouths indeed the stickleback father once told the little sticklebacks that they should not stir out of the nest unless they would promise to keep away from the young dragonflies the stickleback mothers said that it was all the fault of the dragonfly mothers what can you expect exclaimed one of them when dragonfly eggs are so carelessly laid i saw a dragonfly mother laying some only yesterday and how do you suppose she did it just flew around in the sunshine and visited with her friends and once in a while flew low enough to touch the water and drop one in it is disgraceful the minnow mothers did not think it was so much in the way the eggs were laid although said one i always lay mine close together instead of scattering them over the whole pond they thought the trouble came from bad bringing up or no bringing up at all each egg you know when it is laid drops to the bottom of the pond and the children are hatched and grow up there and do not even see their fathers and mothers now most of the larvæ were turning into nymphs which are halfgrown dragon flies they had been short and plump and now they were longer and more slender and there were little bunches on their shoulders where the wings were growing under their skin they had outgrown their old skins a great many times and had to wriggle out of them to be at all comfortable when a dragonfly child became too big for his skin he hooked the two sharp claws of each of his six feet firmly into something unfastened his skin down the back and wriggled out leaving it to roll around in the water until it became just part of the mud like most growing children the dragonfly larvæ and nymphs had to eat a great deal their stomachs were as long as their bodies and they were never really happy unless their stomachs were full they always ate plain food and plenty of it and they never ate between meals they had breakfast from the time they awakened in the morning until the sun was high in the sky then they had dinner until the sun was low in the sky and supper from that time until it grew dark and they went to sleep but never a mouthful between meals no matter how hungry they might be they said this was their only rule about eating and they would keep it they were always slow children you would think that with six legs apiece and three joints in each leg they might walk quite fast yet they never did when they had to they hurried in another way by taking a long leap through the water of course they breathed water like their neighbors the fishes and the tadpoles they did not breathe
 it into their mouths or through gills but took it in through some openings in the back part of their bodies when they wanted to hurry they breathed this water out so suddenly that it sent them quickly ahead the snapping turtle had called them bothering bugs one day when he was cross and that was the day after he had been cross and just before the day when he was going to be cross again and they didnt like him and wanted to get even they all put their queer little threecornered heads together and there was an ugly look in their great staring eyes horrid old thing said one larva i wish i could sting him well you cant said a nymph turning towards him so suddenly that he leaped you havent any sting and you never will have so you just keep still it was not at all nice in her to speak that way but she was not well brought up you know and that perhaps is a reason why one should excuse her for talking so to her little brother she was often impatient and said she could never go anywhere without one of the larvæ tagging along i tell you what lets do said another nymph lets all go together to the shallow water where he suns himself and lets all stand close to each other and then when he comes along lets stick out our lips at him both lips asked the larvæ well our lower lips anyway answered the nymph our upper lips are so small they dont matter well do it exclaimed all the dragonfly children and they started together to walk on the pondbottom to the shallow water they thought it would scare the snapping turtle dreadfully they knew that whenever they stuck out their lower lips at the small fishes and bugs they swam away as fast as they could the giant waterbug belostoma was the only bug who was not afraid of them when they made faces indeed the lower lip of a dragonfly child might well frighten people for it is fastened on a long jointed armlike thing and has pincers on it with which it catches and holds its food most of the time the dragonfly child keeps the joint bent and so holds his lip up to his face like a mask but sometimes he straightens the joint and holds his lip out before him and then its pincers catch hold of things he does this when he is hungry when they reached the shallow water the dragonfly children stood close together with the larvæ in the middle and the nymphs all around them the snapping turtle was nowhere to be seen so they had to wait arent you scared whispered one larva to another scared dah whos afraid answered he oh look cried a nymph there go some grownup dragonflies over our heads just you wait until i change my skin once more and then wont i have a good time ill dry my wings and then ill shh said one of the larvæ here comes the snapping turtle sure enough there he came through the shallow water his wet backshell partly out of it and shining in the sunlight he came straight toward the dragonfly children and they were glad to see that he did not look hungry they thought he might be going to take a nap after his dinner then they all stood even closer together and stuck out their lower lips at him they thought he might run away when they did this they felt sure that he would at least be very badly frightened the snapping turtle did not seem to see them at all it was queer he just waddled on and on coming straight toward them ahhh said he how sleepy i do feel i will lie down in the sunshine and rest he took a few more steps which brought his great body right over the crowd of dragonfly children i think i will draw in my head said he the dragonfly children looked at each other and my tail here two of the youngest larvæ began to cry and lie down he began to draw in his legs very very slowly and just as his great hard lower shell touched the mud the last larva crawled out under his tail the nymphs had already gotten away oh said the dragonfly children to each other wasnt it awful humph said the snapping turtle talking to himselfhe had gotten into the way of doing that because he had so few friendshow dreadfully they did scare me then he laughed a grim snapping turtle laugh and went to sleep there was but one snapping turtle in the pond and he was the only person there who had ever been heard to wish for another he had not always lived there and could just remember leaving his brothers and sisters when he was young i was carried away from my people he said and kept on land for a few days then i was brought here and have made it my home ever since one could tell by looking at him that he was related to the mud turtles he had upper and lower shells like them and could draw in his head and legs and tail when he wanted to his shells were gray quite the color of a claybank and his head was larger than those of the mud turtles his tail was long and scaly and pointed and his forelegs were large and warty there were fine strong webs between his toes as there were between the toes of his relatives the mud turtles when he first came to live in the pond people were sorry for him and tried to make him feel at home he had a chance to win many friends and have all his neighbors fond of him but he was too snappy when the water was just warm enough and his stomach was full and he had slept well the night before and everything was exactly as he wished it to beah then he was a very agreeable turtle and was ready to talk in the most gracious way to his neighbors that was all very well anybody can be goodnatured when everything is exactly right and he can have his own way but the really delightful people you know are the ones who are pleasant when things go wrong it was a mud turtle father who first spoke to him i hope youll like the pond said he we think it very homelike and comfortable humph shallow little hole snapped the one who had just come i bump my head on the bottom every time i dive that is too bad exclaimed the mud turtle father i hope you dive where there is a soft bottom sometimes i do and sometimes i dont answered the snapping turtle i cant bother to swim down slowly and try it and then go back to dive when i want to dive i want to dive and thats all there is to it yes said the mud turtle father i know how it is when one has the diving feeling i hope your head will not trouble you much and that you will soon be used to our waters he spread his toes and swam strongly away pushing against the water with his webbed feet humph said the snapping turtle to himself it is all very well to talk about getting used to these waters but i never shall i can hardly see now for the pain in the right side of my head where i bumped it or was it the left side i hit queer i cant remember then he swam to shallow water and drew himself into his shell and lay there and thought how badly he felt and how horrid the pond was and what poor company his neighbors were and what a disagreeable world this is for snapping turtles the mud turtle father went home and told his wife all about it what a disagreeable fellow she said but then he is a bachelor and bachelors are often queer i never was said her husband oh said she and being a wise wife she did not say anything else she knew however that mr mud turtle was a much more agreeable fellow since he had married and learned to think more of somebody else than of himself it is the people who think too much of themselves you know who are most unhappy in this world the eels also tried to be friendly and when he dove to the bottom called to him to stay and visit with them you must excuse us from making the first call they said we go out so little in the daytime humph said the snapping turtle do you good to get away from home more no wonder your eyes are weak when you lie around in the mud of the dark pondbottom all day indeed ill not stay you can come to see me like other people then he swam away and told the clams what he had said and he acted quite proud of what was really dreadful rudeness itll do them good to hear the truth said he i always speak right out they are as bad as the wateradder they have no backbone the clams listened politely and said nothing they never did talk much the snapping turtle was mistaken though when he said that the eels and the wateradder had no backbone they really had much more than he but they wore theirs inside while his was spread out in the shape of a shell for everybody to see he did not even try to keep his temper he became angry one day because belostoma the giant waterbug ate something which he wanted for himself his eyes glared and his horny jaws snapped and he waved his long pointed scaly tail in a way which was terrible to see you are a goodfornothing bug he said you do no work and you eat more than any other person of your size here nobody likes you and there isnt a little fish in the pond who would be seen with you if he could help it they all hide if they see you coming ill be heartily glad when you get your wings and fly away dont let any of your friends lay their eggs in this pond ive seen enough of your family of course this made belostoma feel very badly he was not a popular bug and it is possible that if he could have had his own way he would have chosen to be a crayfish or a stickleback rather than what he was as for his not workingthere was nothing for him to do so how could he work he had to eat or he would not grow and since the snapping turtle was a hearty eater himself he should have had the sense to keep still about that belostoma told the mud turtles what the snapping turtle had said and the mud turtle father spoke of it to the snapping turtle by that time the snapping turtle was feeling better natured and was very gracious belostoma shouldnt remember those things said he moving one warty foreleg when i am angry i often say things that i do not mean but then i get right over it i had almost forgotten my little talk with him i dont see any reason for telling him i am sorry he is very silly to think so much of it he lifted his big head quite
 high and acted as though it was really a noble thing to be ugly and then forget about it he might just as sensibly ask people to admire him for not eating when his stomach was full or for lying still when he was too tired to swim when the mud turtle mother heard of this she was quite out of patience all he cares for said she is just snapping turtle snapping turtle snapping turtle when he is goodnatured he thinks everybody else ought to be and when he is badtempered he doesnt care how other people feel he will never be any more agreeable until he does something kind for somebody and i dont see any chance of that happening there came a day though when the pond people were glad that the snapping turtle lived there two boys were wading in the edge of the pond splashing the water and scaring all the people who were near them the sticklebacks turned pale all over as they do when they are badly frightened the yellow brown frog was so scared that he emptied out the water he had saved for wetting his skin in dry weather he had a great pocket in his body filled with water for if his skin should get dry he couldnt breathe through it and unless he carried water with him he could not stay ashore at all the boys had even turned the mud turtle father onto his back in the sunshine where he lay waving his feet in the air but not strong enough to get right side up again the snapping turtle was taking a nap in deep water when the frightened fishes came swimming toward him as fast as their tails would take them what is the matter said he boys cried they boys the dreadful splashing turtleturning kind humph said the snapping turtle ill have to see about that how many are there two cried the sticklebacks and minnows together and there is only one of me said the snapping turtle to himself i must have somebody to help me oh belostoma he cried as the giant waterbug swam past help me drive those boys away with pleasure said belostoma who liked nothing better than this kind of work off they started for the place where the boys were wading the snapping turtle took long strong strokes with his webbed feet and belostoma could not keep up with him the snapping turtle saw this jump onto my back cried he you are a light fellow hang tight belostoma jumped onto the snapping turtles claycolored shell and when he found himself slipping off the back end of it he stuck his claws into the snapping turtles tail and held on in that way he knew that he was not easily hurt even if he did make a fuss when he bumped his head as soon as they got near the boys the snapping turtle spoke over his backshell to belostoma slide off now said he and drive away the smaller boy dont stop to talk with these bloodsuckers so belostoma slid off and swam toward the smaller boy and he ran out his stout little sucking tube and stung him on the leg just then the snapping turtle brought his horny jaws together on one of the larger boys feet there was a great splashing and dashing as the boys ran to the shore and three bloodsuckers who had fastened themselves to the boys legs did not have time to drop off and were carried ashore and never seen again  there said the snapping turtle thats done i dont know what the pond people would do if you and i were not here to look after them belostoma im glad i happened along said the giant waterbug quietly but you will have to do it all after this im about ready to leave the pond i think ill go tomorrow going tomorrow exclaimed the snapping turtle im sorry of course i know you can never come back but send your friends here to lay their eggs we mustnt be left without some of your family thank you said belostoma and he did not show that he remembered some quite different things which the snapping turtle had said before about his leaving the pond and that showed that he was a very wise bug as well as a brave one humph said the snapping turtle there is the mud turtle father on his back and he ran to him and pushed him over onto his feet oh thank you cried the mud turtle mother i was not strong enough to do that always glad to help my neighbors said the snapping turtle pleasant day isnt it i must tell the fishes that the boys are gone the poor little fellows were almost too scared to swim and he went away with a really happy look on his face there said the mud turtle mother to her husband he has begun to help people and now he likes them and is contented i always told you so none of the pond people were alone more than the wateradders the snapping turtle was left to himself a great deal until the day when he and belostoma drove away the boys after that his neighbors began to understand him better and he was less grumpy so that those who wore shells were soon quite fond of him belostoma did not have many friends among the smaller people and only a few among the larger ones they said that he was cruel and that he had a bad habit of using his stout sucking tube to sting with still belostoma did not care he said a giant waterbug does not always live in the water i shall have my wings soon and leave the water and marry after that i shall fly away on my wedding trip mrs belostoma may go with me if she feels like doing so after laying her eggs here i shall go anyway and i shall flutter and sprawl around the light and sting people who bother me and have a happy time that was belostomas way he would sting people who bothered him but then he always said that they need not have bothered him and perhaps that was so with the wateradders it was different they were goodnatured enough yet the mud turtles and snapping turtle were the only ones who ever called upon them and found them at home the small people without shells were afraid of them and the clams and pond snails never called upon any one the minnows said they could not bear the looks of the addersthey had such ugly mouths and such quick motions the larger fishes kept away on account of their children who were small and tender one might think that the sandhill cranes the fish hawks and the other shore families would have been good friends for them but when they called the adders were always away people said that the adders were afraid of them the yellow brown frog wished that the adders could be scared badly scared some time so scared that a chilly feeling would run down their backs from their heads clear to the tips of their tails i wish said he that the chilly feeling would be big enough to go way through to their bellies their bellies are only the front side of their backs anyway he added because they are so thin of course this was a dreadful wish to make but people said that one of the adders had frightened the yellow brown frog so that he never got over it and this was the reason he felt so the wateradders were certainly the cleverest people in the pond and there was one mother adder who was so very bright that they called her the clever wateradder she could do almost anything and she knew it she talked about it too and that showed bad taste and was one reason why she was not liked better she could swim very fast could creep glide catch hold of things with her tail hang herself from the branch of a tree lift her head far into the air leap dart bound and dive all her family could do these things but she could do them a little the best one day she was hanging over the pond in a very graceful position with her tail twisted carelessly around a willow branch the snapping turtle and a mud turtle father were in the shallow water below her her slender forked tongue was darting in and out of her open mouth she was using her tongue in this way most of the time it is useful in feeling of things she said and then i have always thought it quite becoming she could see herself reflected in the still water below her and she noticed how prettily the dark brown of her back shaded into the white of her belly you see she was vain as well as clever the snapping turtle felt cross today and had come to see if a talk with her would not make him feel better the mud turtle was tired of having the children sprawl around him and of mrs mud turtle telling about the trouble she had to get the right kind of food the clever wateradder spoke first of the weather it must be dreadfully hot for the shore people she said think of their having to wear the same feathers all the year and fly around in the sunshine to find food for their children ah yes said the mud turtle how they must wish for shells humph said the snapping turtle what for to fly with let them come in swimming with their children if they are warm and tired the wateradder laughed in her snaky way and showed her sharp teeth i have heard she said that when the wild ducks bring their children here to swim they do not always take so many home as they brought the snapping turtle became very much interested in his warty right foreleg and did not seem to hear what she said the mud turtle smiled i have heard she went on that when young ducks dive head first they are quite sure to come up again but that when they dive feet first they never come up what do you mean asked the snapping turtle and he was snappy about it oh nothing replied the wateradder swinging her head back and forth and looking at the scales on her body i know what you mean said the snapping turtle and you know what you mean but i have to eat something and if i am swimming under the water and a duckling paddles along just above me and sticks his foot into my mouth i am likely to swallow him before i think the wateradder saw that he was provoked by what she had said so she talked about something else i think the ducks spoil their children said she they make such a fuss over them and they are not nearly so bright as my children why mine hatch as soon as the eggs are laid and go hunting at once they are no trouble at all i never worry about mine said the mud turtle although their mother thinks it is not safe for them
 all to sleep at once as they do on a log in the sunshine it isnt said the adder decidedly i never close my eyes none of us adders do nobody can ever say that we close our eyes to danger they couldnt shut their eyes if they wanted to because they had no eyelids but she did not speak of that how stupid people are she said most of them remarked the turtles all of them she said except us adders and the turtles i even think that some of the turtles are a little queer dont you we have thought so said the mud turtle they certainly are agreed the snapping turtle who was beginning to feel much better natured what did you say asked the adder who like all her family was a little deaf ouch exclaimed the snapping turtle ouch ouch what is the matter asked the mud turtle then he began to slap the water with his short stout tail and say ouch two naughty young waterboatmen had swum quietly up on their backs and stung the turtles on their tails then they swam away pushing themselves quickly through the water with swift strokes of their hairy oarlegs ahhh exclaimed the snapping turtle and he backed into the mud knowing that fine soft mud is the best thing in the world for stings ahhh exclaimed the mud turtle if i could only reach my tail with my head or even with one of my hind feet reach your tail with your head asked the wateradder in her sweetest voice nothing is easier and she wound herself around the willow branch in another graceful position and took the tip of her tail daintily between her teeth humph said the snapping turtle and he pulled his tail out of the mud and swam away ugh said the mud turtle and he swam away with the snapping turtle what a rude person she is they said always trying to show how much more clever she is than other people we would rather be stupid and polite after a while the snapping turtle said but then you know we are not stupid of course not replied the mud turtle not even queer when the sandhill cranes were married they began to work for a home of their own to be sure they had chosen a place for it beforehand yet there were other things to think about and some of their friends told them it would be very foolish to build on the ground there are so many accidents to ground nests these friends said there are snakes you know and rats and a great many other people whom you would not want to have look in on your children besides something might fall on it the young couple talked this all over and decided to build in a tree we are not afraid of snakes and rats they said but we would fear something falling on the nest they were talking to quite an old crane when they said this do you mean to build in a tree said he my dear young friends dont do that just think a high wind might blow the nest down and spoil everything do whatever you wish but dont build in a tree then he flew away dear me exclaimed young mrs crane one tells me to do this and never to do that another tells me to do that and never to do this i shall just please myself since i cannot please my friends and which place do you choose asked her husband who always liked whatever she did i shall build on the ground she said decidedly if the tree falls it may hit the nest and it may not but if we build in the tree and it falls we are sure to hit the ground how wise you are exclaimed her husband i believe people get in a way of building just so and come to think that no other way can be right which shows that mr sandhill crane was also wise both worked on the nest bringing roots and dried grasses with which to build it up sometimes they went to dance with their friends and when they did they bowed most of the time to each other they did not really care very much about going because they were so interested in the nest this they had to build quite high from the ground on account of their long legs if i were a duck said mrs sandhill crane it would do very well for me to sit on the nest but with my legs never i would as soon sit on two bare branches as to have them doubled under me so she tried the nest until it was just as high as her legs were long when it was high enough she laid in it two gray eggs with brown spots after that she did no more dancing but stood with a leg on either side of the nest and her soft body just over the eggs to keep them warm it was very tiresome work and sometimes mr crane covered the eggs while she went fishing the cranes are always very kind to their wives this you know was the first time that either had had a nest and it was all new and wonderful to them they thought that there never had been such a beautiful home they often stood on the ground beside it and poked it this way and that with their bills and said to each other just look at this fine root that i wove in or have you noticed how well that tuft of dried grass looks where i put it as it came near the time for their eggs to hatch they could hardly bear to be away long enough to find food one day young mr sandhill crane came home much excited our neighbors the cranes who live across the pond said he had two children hatched this morning oh how glad i am cried his wife how glad i am those eggs were laid just before ours which must hatch very soon now that is what i thought said he i feel so sorry for them though for i saw their children and they are dreadfully homelynot at all like their parents who are quite goodlooking i must see them myself said his wife and if you will cover the eggs while i go for food i will just peep in on them i will hurry back she flew steadily across the pond which was not very wide and asked to see the babies she had never seen any crane children you know since she herself was little she thought them very ugly to look at and wondered how their mother could seem bright and cheerful with two such disappointing children she said all the polite things that she honestly could then got something to eat and flew home they are very very homely she said to her husband and i think it queer all their older children are goodlooking she had hardly said this when she heard a faint tapping sound in the nest she looked and there was the tip of a tiny beak showing through the shell of one egg she stood on one side of the nest watching and her husband stood on the other while their oldest child slowly made his way out they dared not help for fear of hurting him and besides all the other cranes had told them that they must not oh look cried the young mother what a dear little bill ah said the young father did you ever see such a neck look at those legs cried she what a beautiful child he is he looks just like you said the father and i am glad of it ah no said she he is exactly like you and she began to clear away the broken eggshell soon the other crane baby poked her bill out and again the young parents stood around and admired their child they could not decide which was the handsomer but they were sure that both were remarkable babies they felt more sorry than ever for their neighbors across the pond who had such homely children they took turns in covering their own damp little cranes and were very very happy before this it had been easy to get what food they wanted for there had been two to work for two now there were two to work for four and that made it much harder there was no time for dancing and both father and mother worked steadily yet they were happier than ever and neither would have gone back to the careless old days for all the food in the pond or all the dances on the beach the little cranes grew finely they changed their down for pinfeathers and then these grew into fine brownish gray feathers like those which their parents wore they were good children too and very well brought up they ate whatever food was given to them and never found fault with it when they left the nest for the first time they fluttered and tumbled and had trouble in learning to walk a mud turtle father who was near told them that this was because their legs were too long and too few well said the brother as he picked himself up and tried to stand on one leg while he drew the other foot out of the tangled grass they may be too long but im sure there are enough of them when im thinking about one i never can tell what the other will do still it was not long before they could walk and wade and even fly then they met the other pond people and learned to tell a stickleback from a minnow they did not have many playmates the saucy little kingfishers sat on branches over their heads the wild ducks waddled or swam under their very bills the fish hawks floated in air above them and the gulls screamed hoarsely to them as they circled over the pond yet none of them were longlegged and stately the things that the other birds enjoyed most they could not do and sometimes they did not like it very well one night they were talking about the gulls when they should have been asleep and their father told them to tuck their heads right under their wings and not let him hear another word from them they did tuck their heads under their wings but they peeped out between the feathers and when they were sure their father and mother were asleep they walked softly away and planned to do something naughty im tired of being good said the brother the gulls never are good they scream and snatch and contradict and have lots of fun lets be bad just for fun all right said his sister what shall we do thats the trouble said he i cant think of anything naughty that i really care for each stood on one leg and thought for a while we might run away said she where would we go asked he we might go to the meadow said she so they started off in the moonlight and went to the meadow but all the people there were asleep except the tree frog and he scrambled out of the way as soon as he saw them coming because he thought they might want a late supper this isnt any fun said the brother lets go to the forest they went to
 the forest and saw the bats flitting in and out among the trees and the bats flew close to the cranes and scared them the great horned owl stood on a branch near them and stared at them with his big round eyes and said who who waughhooo then the brother and sister stood closer together and answered if you please sir we are the crane children but the great horned owl kept on staring at them and saying who who waughhooo until they were sure he was deaf and answered louder and louder still the screech owls came also and looked at them and bent their bodies over as if they were laughing and nodded their heads and shook themselves then the crane children were sure that they were being made fun of so they stalked away very stiffly and when they were out of sight of the owls they flew over toward the farmhouse they were not having any fun at all yet and they meant to keep on trying for what was the good of being naughty if they didnt they passed horses and cows asleep in the fields and saw the brown hog lying in the pen with a great many little brown pigs and one white pig sleeping beside her nobody was awake except collie the shepherd dog who was sitting in the farmyard with his nose in the air barking at the moon go away he said to the crane children who were walking around the yard go away i must bark at the moon and i dont want anybody around they did not start quite soon enough to please him so he dashed at them and ran around them and barked at them instead of at the moon until they were glad enough to fly straight home to the place where their father and mother were sleeping with their heads under their wings are you going to tell them asked the brother i dont know answered the sister when morning came they looked tired and their father and mother seemed so worried about them that they told the whole story we didnt care so very much about what we did they said but we thought it would be fun to be naughty the father and mother looked at each other in a very knowing way a great many people think that said the mother gently they are mistaken after all it is really more fun to be good well i wish the gulls wouldnt scream goodygoody at us said the brother what difference does that make asked his father why should a crane care what a gull says why ii dont know stammered the brother i guess it doesnt make any difference after all the next day when the crane children were standing in the edge of the pond a pair of young gulls flew down near them and screamed out goodygoody then the crane brother and sister lifted their heads and necks and opened their long bills and trumpeted back baddybaddy there they said to each other now we are even when the oldest dragonfly nymph felt that the wings under her skin were large enough she said goodbye to her water friends and crawled slowly up the stem of a tall cattail all the other dragonfly nymphs crowded around her and wished that their wings were more nearly ready and the larvæ talked about the time when they should become nymphs the oldest nymph the one who was going away told them that if they would be good little larvæ and eat a great deal of plain food and take care not to break any of their legs or to hurt either of their short stiff little feelers they would some day be fine great nymphs like her then she crawled slowly up the cattail stem and when she drew the tenth and last joint of her body out of the water her friends turned to each other and said she is really gone they felt so badly about it that they had to eat something at once to keep from crying the oldest nymph now stopped breathing water and began to breathe air she waited to look at the pond before she went any farther she had never seen it from above and it looked very queer to her it was beautiful and shining and because the sky above it was cloudless the water was a most wonderful blue there was no wind stirring so there were no tiny waves to sparkle and send dancing bits of light here and there it was one of the very hot and still summer days which dragonflies like best a sad look came into the nymphs great eyes as she stood there the pond is beautiful she said but when one looks at it from above it does not seem at all homelike she shook her threecornered head sadly and rubbed her eyes with her forelegs she thought she should miss the happy times in the mud with the other children a virgin dragonfly lighted on the cattail next to hers she knew it was a virgin dragonfly because he had black wings folded over his back and there were shimmering green and blue lights all over his body and wings he was very slender and smaller than she good morning said he are you just up yes said she looking bashfully down at her forefeet she did not know how to behave in the air it was so different from the water couldnt have a finer day said he very glad youve come excuse me there is a friend to whom i must speak then he flew away with another virgin dragonfly hurry up and get your skin changed said a voice above her and there was a fine great fellow floating in the air over her head ill tell you a secret when you do dragonflies care a great deal for secrets so she quickly hooked her twelve sharp claws into the cattail stem and unfastened her old skin down the back and wriggled and twisted and pulled until she had all her six legs and the upper part of her body out this made her very tired and she had to rest for a while the old skin would only open down for a little way by her shoulders and it was hard to get out through such a small place next she folded her legs close to her body and bent over backward and swayed this way and that until she had drawn her long slender body from its outgrown covering she crawled away from the empty skin and looked it over it kept the shape of her body but she was surprised to find how fast she was growing slender even then and she had been out only a short time she was much longer and thinner than she had been and her old skin looked much too short for her how styles do change she said i remember how proud i was of that skin when i first got it and now i wouldnt be seen in it her beautiful gauzy wings with their dark veinings were drying and growing in the sunshine she was weak now and had them folded over her back like those of the virgin dragonfly but as soon as she felt rested and strong she meant to spread them out flat the fine big dragonfly lighted beside her how are your wings said he almost dry she answered joyfully and she quivered them a little to show him how handsome they were well said he ill tell you the secret now and of course you will never speak of it i saw you talking with a virgin dragonfly he may be all right but he isnt really in our set you know and youd better not have anything to do with him thank you she said i wont she thought it very kind in him to tell her he soon flew away and as she took her first flight into the air a second big dragonfly overtook her ill tell you a secret said he if you will never tell i wont said she i saw you talking to a virgin dragonfly a while ago you may have noticed that he folded his wings over his back the big dragonflies never do this and you must never be seen with yours so thank you she said i wont but when they were drying i had to hold them in that way of course said he we all do things then that we wouldnt afterward before long she began egglaying flying low enough to touch her body to the water now and then and drop a single egg this egg always sank at once to the bottom and she took no more care of it a third big dragonfly came up to her i want to tell you something he said put your head close to mine she put her head close to his and he whispered i saw you flying with my cousin a few minutes ago i dislike to say it but he is not a good friend for you whatever you do dont go with him again go with me thank you said she yet she began to wonder what was the matter she saw that just as soon as she visited with anybody somebody else told her that she must not do so again down in the pond they had all been friends she wondered if it could not be so in the air she rubbed her head with her right foreleg and frowned as much as she could you know she couldnt frown very much because her eyes were so large and close together that there was only a small frowningplace left she turned her head to see if any one else was coming to tell her a secret her neck was very very slender and did not show much because the back side of her head was hollow and fitted over her shoulders no other dragonfly was near instead she saw a swallow swooping down on her she sprang lightly into the air and the swallow chased her when he had his beak open to catch her as he flew she would go backward or sidewise without turning around this happened many times and it was well for her that it was so for the swallow was very hungry and if he had caught herwell she certainly would never have told any of the secrets she knew the swallow quite lost his patience and flew away grumbling i wont waste any more time he said on trying to catch somebody who can fly backward without turning around ridiculous way to fly the dragonfly thought it an exceedingly good way however and was even more proud of her wings than she had been legs are all very well she said to herself as far as they go and ones feet would be of very little use without them but i like wings better now that i think of it she added i havent walked a step since i began to fly i understand better the old saying make your wings save your legs they certainly are very good things to stand on when one doesnt care to fly night came and she was glad to sleep on the under side of a broad leaf of pickerelweed she awakened feeling stupid and lazy she could not think what was the matter until she heard her friends talking about the weather then she knew that dragonflies are certain to feel so on dark and wet days i dont see
 what difference that should make she said im not afraid of rain ive always been careless about getting my feet wet and it never hurt me any ugh said one of her friends youve never been wet in spots or hit on one wing by a great raindrop that has fallen clear down from a cloud i had a raindrop hit my second right knee once and it has hurt me ever since i have only five good knees left and i have to be very careful about lighting on slippery leaves it was very dull nobody seemed to care about anybody or anything the fine big dragonflies who had been so polite to her the day before hardly said good morning to her now when she asked them questions they would say nothing but yes or no or i dont know and one of them yawned in her face oh dear she said how i wish myself back in the pond where the rain couldnt wet me id like to see my old friends and some of the dear little larvæ i wish more of the nymphs would come up she looked all around for them and as she did so she saw the shining backshell of the snapping turtle showing above the shallow water i believe ill call on him she said he may tell me something about my old friends and anyway it will cheer me up she lighted very carefully on the middle of his backshell and found it very comfortable good morning said she have you no snapped he i havent and i dont mean to dear me said she that is too bad i dont see why said he is there any particular reason why i should i thought you might have just happened to said she and i should like to know how they are what are you talking about snapped he i was going to ask if you had seen the dragonfly children lately she said and as she spoke she made sure that she could not slip she felt perfectly safe where she was because she knew that no matter how cross he might be he could not reach above the edges of his backshell well why didnt you say so in the first place he snapped instead of sitting there and talking nonsense they are all right a lot of the nymphs are going into the air today now that he had said a few ugly things he began to feel better natured youve changed a good deal since the last time i saw you when was that asked she it was one day when i came remarkably near sitting down on a lot of you dragonfly children he chuckled you were a homely young nymph then and you stuck out your lower lip at me oh said she then you did see us of course i did answered he havent i eyes id have sat down on you too if i hadnt wanted to see you scramble away the larvæ always are full of mischief but then they are young you nymphs were old enough to know better i suppose we were she said i didnt think you saw us why didnt you tell us oh said the snapping turtle i thought id have a secret if i cant keep a secret for myself i know that nobody can keep it for me secrets can swim faster than any fish in the pond if you once let them get away from you i thought id better not tell i might want to sit on you some other time you know youll never have the chance said she with a twinkle in her big eyes it is my turn to sit on you and after that they were very good friendsas long as she sat on the middle of his shell the eels were as different from the clams as people well could be it was not alone that they looked unlike but that they had such different ways of enjoying life the clams were chubby people each comfortably settled in his own shell which he could open or shut as he chose they never wanted to live anywhere else or to get beyond the edges of their own pearllined shells the eels were long slender and slippery people looking even more like snakes than they did like fishes they were always careful to tell new acquaintances though that they were not even related to the snakes to be sure they would say we do not wear our fins like most fishes but that is only a matter of taste after all we should find them dreadfully in the way if we did and that was just like the eelsthey were always so ready to explain everything to their friends they were great talkers they would talk about themselves and their friends and the friends of their friends and the pond and the weather and the state of the mud and what everything was like yesterday and what it would be likely to be like tomorrow and did you really think so and why the wateradder used to say that they were the easiest people in the pond to visit with for all one had to do was to keep still and look very much interested perhaps that may have been why the clams and they were such good friends the clams you know were a quiet family unless a clam was very very much excited he never said more than yes no or indeed they were excellent listeners and some of the most popular people in the pond those who were in trouble told the clams and they would say indeed or ah in such a nice way that their visitor was sure to leave feeling better others who wanted advice would go to them and talk over their plans and tell them what they wanted to do and the clams would say yes and then the visitors would go away quite decided and say we really didnt know what to do until we spoke to the clams about it but they agree with us perfectly the clams were also excellent people to keep secrets and as the eels were forever telling secrets that was all very well mother eel was fussy she even said so herself and if a thing bothered her she would talk and talk and talk until even her own children were tired of hearing about it now she was worrying over the pond water i do not think it nearly so clean as it was last year she said and the mud is getting positively dirty our family are very particular about that and i think we may have to move i do dread the moving though it is so much work with a family the size of mine and mr eel is no help at all with the children she was talking with mother mud turtle when she said this and the little eels were wriggling all around her as she spoke then they began teasing her to go until she told them to swim away at once and play with the young minnows im afraid i shall have to go said she if only on account of the children i want them to see something of the world it is so dull in this pond were you ever out of it she asked turning suddenly to mrs mud turtle oh yes answered she i go quite often and one of my sons took a very long trip to the meadow he went with some boys it was most exciting is that the one with thepeculiar backshell asked mother eel yes replied mother mud turtle sweetly he is very modest and does not care to talk about it much but i am really quite pleased some people travel and show no sign of it afterward one would never know that they had left home mother eel wondered if she meant her but with him it is different he shows marks of having been in the great world outside mother eel wriggled a little uneasily i think i must tell you after all she said i have really made up my mind to go mr eel thinks it foolish and would rather stay here but i am positive that we can find a better place and we must consider the children he thinks he cares as much for them as i do yet he would be willing to have them stay here forever he was hatched here and thinks the pond perfect we get to talking about it sometimes and i say to him mr eel where would those children be now if it were not for me and what does he say then asked the mud turtle mother nothing answered mother eel with a smart little wriggle there is nothing for him to say yes we shall certainly move i am only waiting for the right kind of night it must not be too light or the land people would see us not too dark or we could not see them and then the grass must be dewy it would never do for us to get dry you know or we should all be sick but please dont speak of this dear mrs turtle i would rather leave quietly when the time comes so the mud turtle mother remembered that it was a secret and told nobody except the mud turtle father and he did not speak of it to anybody but the snapping turtle did you say that it was a secret asked the snapping turtle yes said the mud turtle father it is a great secret humph said the snapping turtle then why did you tell me that same day when the stickleback father came to look for nineteen or twenty of his children who were missing mother eel told him about her plans i thought you would be interested in hearing of it she said but i shall not mention it to anybody else you may be sure i shall not speak of it said he and probably he would not have told a person if it had not been that he forgot and talked of it with the snails he also forgot to say that it was a secret and so they spoke freely of it to the crayfishes and the caddis worms the caddis worms were playing with the tadpoles soon after this and one of them whispered to a tadpole right before the others although he knew perfectly well that it was rude for him to do so now dont you ever tell said he aloud uhuh answered the tadpole and everybody knew that he meant no even if they hadnt seen him wave his hindlegs sidewise of course not having the right kind of neck for it he couldnt shake his head then the other tadpoles and caddis worms wanted to tell secrets and they kept whispering to each other and saying out loud now dont you ever tell when a caddis worm told a tadpole anything he said the eels are going to move away and when a tadpole told a secret to a caddis worm he just moved his lips and said sissel sissel sisselsiss im only making believe you know but he was sure to add out loud now dont you tell and the caddis worm would answer uhuh the eel mother also spoke to the biggest frog asking him to watch the grass for her and tell her when it was dewy enough for moving he was afraid he might forget it and so told his sister and asked her to help him remember and she was afraid that she might forget so she spoke to her friend the green brown frog about it the yellow brown frog afterward said that he heard it from her one night it was neither
 too dark nor too light and the dew lay heavy on the grass then mother eel said to her children now stop your wriggling and listen to me every one of you we shall move because the mud here is so dirty you are going out into the great world and i want you to remember everything you feel and see you may never have another chance the little eels were so excited that they couldnt keep still and she had to wait for them to stop wriggling when they were quiet she went on all the eels are goingyour uncles and aunts and cousinsand you children must keep with the older ones be careful where you wriggle to and dont get on anybody elses tail she led the way out of the water and wriggled gracefully up the bank although it was quite steep at that place i came this way she said because i felt more as though this was the way to come she closed her mouth very firmly as she spoke mr eel had thought another way better they had to pass through crowds of pond people to reach the shore for everybody had kept awake and was watching the older ones cried out goodbye we shall miss you and waved their fins or their legs or their tails whichever seemed the handiest the younger ones teased the little eels and tried to hold them back and told them theyd miss lots of fun and that they guessed theyd wish themselves back in the pond again when they got onto the shore the frogs and the mud turtles were there and it was a long time before they could get started on their journey one of the little eels was missing and his mother had to go back for him she found that a mischievous young stickleback had him by the tail when at last they were all together on the bank the eel father said to his wife are you sure that the cranes and fish hawks dont know about our moving because if they did i know she said it would be dreadful if they found out and we have been so late in getting started we shall have to stop at the very first water we find now whether we like it or not she lay still and thought i have a feeling said she that we should go this way so that way they went dragging their yellow bellies over the ground as carefully as they could their dark green backs with their long fringes of back fins hardly showing in the grass it was a good thing that their skin was so fat and thick for sometimes they had to cross rough places that scraped it dreadfully and even rumpled the tiny scales that were in it while their long fringes of belly fins became worn and almost ragged if your scales were on the outside said their father like those of other fishes you wouldnt have many left mother eel was very tired and did not say much her friends began to fear that she was ill at last she spoke i do not see she said how people found out that we were to move you didnt tell anybody said mr eel no indeed said she and she really believed it that was because she had talked so much that she couldnt remember what she did say it is always so with those that talk too much three stickleback mothers and several clams were visiting under the lilypads in the early morning mother eel was also there yes she said i am glad to come back and be among my old friends and the children are happier here as i often tell mr eel there is no place like ones home we had a hard journey but i do not mind that we are rested now and travel does teach people so much i should think you would get dreadfully tired of being in the water all the time i want my children to see the world now they know grass and trees and air and dry ground there are not many children of their age who know more than they we stayed in a brook the one day we were gone so they have felt running water too it was cleani will say that for itbut it was no place for eels and so we came back there is no telling how long she would have kept on talking if she had not been called away as soon as she left the sticklebacks began to talk about her so she thinks we must be tired of staying in the water all the time said one it doesnt tire me nearly so much as it would to go dragging myself over the country wearing out my fins on the ground indeed said a clam to whom she turned as she spoke well ill tell you what i think said another stickleback mother i think that if she didnt care so much for travel herself she would not be dragging her family around to learn grass and trees some night they will be learning owls or men and that will be the end of them i do not believe in it at all said the first speaker i certainly would not want my sons to learn these things for they must grow up to be good nestbuilders and babytenders i have told their fathers particularly to bring them up to be careful housekeepers with my daughters it is different for a long time nobody spoke then a clam said what a difference there is in mothers it quite startled the sticklebacks to hear a clam say so much it showed how interested he was and well he might be the clam who brings up children has to do it alone and be both father and mother to them and of course that is hard work it is hard too because when a little clam is naughty his parent can never say that he takes his naughtiness from any one else and there is a difference in fathers too exclaimed one finelooking stickleback mother i say that a fathers place is by the nest and that if he does his work there well he will not have much time to want to travel or to loaf around by the shore the clams looked at each other and said nothing some people thought that the stickleback mothers were lazy just then a crayfish mother came swimming slowly along stopping often to rest her legs were almost useless there were so many little crayfishes clinging to them now look at her said one stickleback just look at her she laid her eggs at the beginning of last winter and fastened them to her legs said she was so afraid something would happen if she left them and that this was a custom in her family anyway now they have hatched and her children hang on to her in the same way the crayfish mother stopped with a sigh isnt it dreadfully warm said she we havent found it so answered the sticklebacks while the clams murmured no let me take some of your children said one stickleback perhaps carrying them has made you warm and tired the crayfish stuck her tailpaddles into the mud and spread her pinchingclaws in front of her family oh no thank you said she they wont be contented with any one but me that must make it hard for you said another stickleback politely she was thinking how quickly she would shake off the little crayfishes if they were her children it does answered their mother it is hard for i carried the eggs on my legs all through the cold weather and until it was very warm again and now that they are hatched the children hang on with their pinchingclaws still i cant bear to shake them off poor little things she held up first one leg and then another to show off her dangling babies i dont know what will happen to them when i cast my shell said she i shall have to soon for i can hardly breathe in it my sister changed hers some time ago and her new one is getting hard already oh theyll be all right said a stickleback cheerfully their fathers tell me that my children learn remarkably fast how to look out for themselves but my children cant walk yet said the crayfish mother and they dont know how to swim what of that asked a stickleback who was beginning to lose her patience they can learn cant they they have eight legs apiece havent they besides the ones that have pincers isnt that enough to begin on and havent they tailpaddles i suppose so said their mother with a sigh but they dont seem to want to go i must put them to sleep now and try to get a little rest myself for the sun is well up the next night she awakened and remembered what the sticklebacks had said so she thought she would try shaking her children off it is for your own good she said and she waved first one leg and then another when she got four of her legs free and stood on them to shake the other four her children scrambled back to her and took hold again with their strong little pinchingclaws then she gave it up you dear tiny things she said but i do wish you would walk instead of making me carry you we dont want to they cried we dont know how there there said their mother no to be sure you dont the next night though they had to let go for their mother was casting her shell when it was off she lay weak and helpless on the pondbottom and her children lay around her they behaved very badly indeed come here and let me catch hold of you cried one i cant walk said another because i dont know how some of them were so cross that they just lay on their backs and kicked with all their eight feet and screamed i wont try it was dreadful the crayfish mother was too weak to move and when the wise old crayfish came along she spoke to him my children will not walk said she even when i tell them to he knew that it was because when she had told them to do things before she had not made them mind i will see what i can do said he but you must not say a word he walked backward to where they were and kept his face turned toward their mother which was polite of him do you want the eels to find you here he said in his gruffest voice if you dont youd better run what a scrambling there was in one way or another every little crayfish scampered away some went forward some went sidewise and some went backward some didnt keep step with themselves very well at first but they soon found out how even the crossest ones who were lying on their backs flopped over and were off the wise old crayfish turned to their mother it is no trouble to teach tenlegged children to walk said he if you go at it in the right way the little crayfishes soon got together again and while they were talking one of their many aunts came along with all her children hanging to her legs then the little crayfishes who had just learned
 to walk pointed their pinchingclaws at their cousins and said shhh fore id let my mother carry me babies the day after the eels left the pond people talked of nothing else it was not that they were so much missed for the eels you know do not swim around in the daytime they lie quietly in the mud and sleep or talk it is only at night that they are really lively still as the mother mud turtle said they had known that they were there and the mud seemed empty without them the larger people had been sorry to have them go and some of them felt that without the eels awake and stirring the pond was hardly a safe place at night i think it is a good deal safer remarked a minnow who usually said what she thought i have always believed that the eels knew what became of some of my brothers and sisters although of course i do not know why didnt you ask them said a stickleback why replied the minnow if i had gone to the eels and asked them that my other brothers and sisters would soon be wondering what had become of me i have heard some queer things about the eels myself said the stickleback but i have never felt much afraid of them i suppose i am braver because i wear so many of my bones on the outside just then a wise old crayfish came along walking sidewise what do you think about the eels asked the stickleback turning suddenly to him the crayfish stuck his tail into the mud he often did this when he was surprised it seemed to help him think when he had thought for a while he waved his big pinchingclaws and said it would be better for me not to tell what i think i used to live near them this showed that the wise old crayfish had been well brought up and knew he should not say unpleasant things about people if he could help it when there was need of it he could tell unpleasant truths and indeed that very evening he did say what he thought of the eels that was when he was teaching some young crayfishes his pupils their mother had brought up a large family and was not strong she had just cast the shell which she had worn for a year and now she was weak and helpless until the new one should harden on her it is such a bother she said to keep changing ones shell in this way but it is a comfort to think that the new one will last a year when i do get it while their mother was so weak the wise old crayfish amused the children and taught them things which all crayfishes should know every evening they gathered around him some of them swimming to him some walking forward some sidewise and some backward it made no difference to them which way they came they were restless pupils and their teacher could not keep them from looking behind them each one had so many eyes that he could look at the teacher with a few and at the other little crayfishes with a few more and still have a good many eyes left with which to watch the tadpoles these eyes were arranged in two big bunches and unless you looked very closely you might think that they had only two eyes apiece they had good ears and there were also fine smellingbristles growing from their heads the wise old crayfish sometimes said that each of his pupils should sit in a circle of six teachers so that he might be taught on all sides at once that is the way in which children should learn he said all around at once but i do the best i can and i at least teach one side of each this evening the wise old crayfish was very sleepy there had been so much talking and excitement during the day that he had not slept so much as usual and now when he should have been wide awake he felt exceedingly dull and stupid when he tried to walk his eight legs stumbled over each other and the weak way in which he waved his pinchingclaw legs showed how tired he was after he had told his pupils the best way to hold their food with their pinchingclaws and had explained to them how it was chewed by the teeth in their stomachs one mischievous little fellow called out i want to know about the eels my mother would never let me go near them and now theyve moved away and i wont ever see them and i think its just horrid eels my children said their teacher are long slender sharpnosed slippery people with a fringe of fins along their backs and another fringe along their bellies they breathe through very small gillopenings in the backs of their heads they have large mouths and teeth in their mouths and they are always sticking out their lower jaws and how do began the biggest little crayfish ask me that tomorrow said their teacher stretching his eight walking legs and his two pinchingclaw legs and his tail paddles but remember this one thingif you ever see an eel get out of his way dont stop to look at him we wont said one little crayfish who thought it smart to be saucy well look to stop at him all of which meant nothing at all and was only said to annoy his teacher they scrambled away over the pondbottom upsetting snails jiggling the young clams and racing with each other where the bottom was smooth beat you running backward cried the saucy crayfish to the biggest little crayfish and they scampered along backward in the moonlit water there was an old log on the bottom of the pond and they sat on that to rest the biggest little crayfish had beaten i would like to see an eel said he id like to see them running on the land said the saucy one pooh said the biggest one thats all you know they dont run on land well i guess they do replied the saucy one i know as much about it as you do eels swim they dont run said the biggest one guess i know well they dont swim in air said the saucy one thats the stuff that lies on top of the water and the ground and people cant swim in it so there well ive seen the wild ducks swim in it they swim with their legs in the water and with their wings in the air said the biggest one i dont believe it said the saucy one anyhow eels run on land eels swim on land said the biggest one eels run eels swim run swim then the two little crayfishes who had been talking louder and louder and becoming more and more angry glared at each other and jerked their feelers and waved their pinchingclaws in a very very ugly way they did not notice a great green and yellow person swimming gently toward them and they did not know that the eels had come back to live in the old pond again mother eel opened her big mouth very wide on land she said decidedly as she swallowed the biggest little crayfish eels wriggle then she swallowed the saucy crayfish there said she ive stopped that dreadful quarrel and she looked around with a satisfied smile during the warm weather the minks did not come often to the pond then they had to stay nearer home and care for their babies in the winter when food was not so plentiful and their youngest children were old enough to come with them they visited there every day it was not far from their home the minks lived by a waterfall in the river and had burrows in the banks where the young minks stayed until they were large enough to go out into the world then the fathers and mothers were very busy for in each home there were four or five or six children hungry and restless and needing to be taught many things they were related to the weasels who lived up by the farmyard and had the same slender and elegant bodies and short legs as they like the weasels they sometimes climbed trees but that was not often they did most of their hunting in the river swimming with their bodies almost all under water and diving and turning and twisting gracefully and quickly when they hunted on land they could tell by smelling just which way to go for their food the minks were a very dark brown and scattered through their close soft fur were long shining hairs of an even darker shade which made their coats very beautiful indeed the fur was darker on their backs than on the under part of their bodies and their tapering bushy tails were almost black their under jaws were white and they were very proud of them perhaps it was because they had so little white fur that they thought so much of it you know that is often the waywe think most of those things which are scarce or hard to get there was one old mink by the river who had a white tip on his tail and that is something which many people have never seen it is even more uncommon than for minks to have white upper lips and that happens only once in a great while this mink was a bachelor and nobody knew why some people said it was because he was waiting to find a wife with a white tip on her tail yet that could not have been for he was too wise to wait for something which might never happen however it was he lived alone and fished and hunted just for himself he could dive more quickly stay under water longer and hunt by scent better than any other mink round there his fur was sleeker and more shining than that of his friends and it is no wonder that the sisters of his friends thought that he ought to marry when the minks visited together somebody was sure to speak of the bachelors luck they said that whatever he did he was always lucky it is all because of a white tip on his tail they said that makes him lucky the young minks heard their fathers and mothers talking and wished that they had been born with white tips on their tails so that they could be lucky too once the bachelor heard them wishing this and he smiled and showed his beautiful teeth and told them that it was not the tip of his tail but his whole body that made him lucky he did not smile to show his teeth because he was not at all vain he just smiled and showed his teeth there was a family of young minks who lived at the foot of the waterfall where the water splashed and dashed in the way they liked best there were four brothers and two sisters in this family and the brothers were bigger than the sisters as mink brothers always are although they were all the same age one was very much larger than any of the rest
 and so they called him big brother he thought there was never such a fine mink as the bachelor and he used to follow him around and look at the tip on his tail and wish that he was lucky like him he wished to be just like him in every way but one he did not want to be a bachelor the other young minks laughed at big brother and asked him if he thought his tail would turn white if he followed the bachelor long enough big brother stood it very patiently for a while then he snarled at them and showed his teeth without smiling and said he would fight anybody who spoke another word about it minks are very brave and very fierce and never know when to stop if they have begun to fight so after that nobody dared tease big brother by saying anything more about the bachelor sometimes they did look at his tail and smile but they never spoke and he pretended not to know what they meant by it a few days after this the bachelor was caught in a trapa common clumsy wooden trap put together with nails and twine it was not near the river and none of his friends would have found him if big brother had not happened along he could hardly believe what he saw was it possible that a trap had dared to catch a mink with a whitetipped tail then he heard the bachelor groan and he knew that it was so he hurried up to where the trap was cant you get out said he no said the bachelor i cant the best way to get out is not to get inand ive gotten in cant you do something with your lucky tail to make the trap open asked big brother i could do something with my teeth answered the bachelor if they were only where the tip of my tail is why are minks always walking into traps he was trying hard not to be cross but his eyes showed how he felt and that was very cross indeed then big brother became much excited i have good teeth said he tell me what to do if you will help me out said the bachelor i will give you my luck and what shall i do with the tail i have asked the young mink who thought that the bachelor was to give him his whitetipped tail never mind now answered the bachelor and he told the young mink just where to gnaw for a long time there was no sound but that of the young minks teeth on the wood of the trap the bachelor was too brave to groan or make a fuss when he knew there was anybody around to hear big brothers mouth became very sore and his stomach became very empty but still he kept at work he was afraid somebody would come for the trap and the mink in it before he finished now try it said he after he had gnawed for quite a while the bachelor backed out as far as he could but his body stuck in the hole you are rumpling your beautiful fur cried the young mink never mind the fur answered the bachelor i can smooth that down afterward you will have to gnaw a little on this side and he raised one of his hind feet to show where he meant it was a beautiful hindfoot thickly padded and with short partly webbed toes and no hair at all growing between them the claws were short sharp and curved big brother gnawed away now try it said he the bachelor backed carefully out through the opening and stood there looking tired and hungry and very much rumpled you are a fine young mink said he we will get something to eat and then we will see about making you lucky they went to the river bank and had a good dinner the bachelor ate more than big brother for his mouth was not sore but big brother was very happy he thought how handsome he would look with a whitetipped tail and how after he had that he could surely marry whoever he wished it was the custom among his people to want to marry the best looking and strongest indeed it is so among all the pond people and that is one reason why they care so much about being goodlooking it is very hard for a young mink to have the one he loves choose somebody else just because the other fellow has the bushiest tail or the longest fur or the thickest pads on his feet now said the bachelor we will talk about luck we will go to a place where nobody can hear what we say they found such a place and lay down the bachelor rolled over three times and smoothed his fur he was still so tired from being in the trap then he looked at the young mink very sharply so you want my tail said he you said you would give me your luck answered big brother and everybody knows that your luck is in your tail the bachelor smiled what will you do with the tail you have said he i dont know answered big brother you wouldnt want to wear two asked the bachelor oh no answered big brother how that would look well how will you put my tail in place of yours asked the bachelor i dont know answered the young mink but you are so wise that i thought you might know some way he began to feel discouraged and to think that the bachelors offer didnt mean very much after all dont you think said the bachelor slowly dont you think that if you could have my luck you could get along pretty well with your own tail why yes said the young mink who had begun to fear he was not going to get anything yes but how could that be the bachelor smiled again i always tell people said he that my luck is not in my tail and they never believe it i will tell you the secret of my luck and you can have luck like it if you really care enough he looked all around to make sure that nobody was near and he listened very carefully with the two little round ears that were almost hidden in his headfur then he whispered to big brother this is the secret always do everything a little better than anybody else can is that all asked the young mink that is enough answered the bachelor keep trying and trying and trying until you can dive deeper stay under water longer run faster and smell farther than other minks then you will have good luck when theirs is poor you will have plenty to eat when they are hungry you can beat in every fight you can have sleek shining fur when theirs is dull luck is not a matter of whitetipped tails the more the young mink thought about it the happier he became i dont see that i am to have your luck after all said he when i have learned to do everything in the very best way it will be luck of my own of course answered the bachelor then it is a kind of luck that cannot be lost if i carried mine in the tip of my tail somebody might bite it off and leave me unlucky big brother kept the secret and worked until he had learned to be as lucky as the bachelor then he married the person he wanted and she was very very handsome it is said that one of their sons has a whitetipped tail but that may not be so one warm day in winter when some of the pussywillows made a mistake and began to grow because they thought spring had come a party of muskrats were visiting in the marsh beside the pond all around them were their winter houses built of mud and coarse grasses these homes looked like heaps of dried rushes unless one went close to them if one did that he could plainly see what they were and if one happened to be a muskrat and could dive and go into them through their watery doorways he would find under the queer roof of each a warm dry room in which to pass the cold days fine weather said every muskrat to his neighbor couldnt sleep all of such a day as this they spoke in that way you know because they usually sleep in the daytime and are awake at night we wish it would always be warm weather said the young muskrats whats the use of winter hard to tell answered one muskrat who had lived in the marsh longer than the rest hard to tell i know it always gives me a good appetite though then all the muskrats laughed they were a jolly goodnatured company and easy to get along with the other pond people liked them much better than they did their neighbors the minks the wild ducks who nested in the sedges were quite willing that the young muskrats should play with their children and the mud hens were not afraid of them mud hens cannot bear minks they say that when a mud chicken is missing from the nest there is quite sure to be a mink somewhere near with a full stomach and down around the corners of his mouth perhaps if the wild ducks and the mud hens were raising their families in the winter time it might be different for then the muskrats get hungry enough to eat almost anything in spring and summer when they can find fresh grasses and young rushes or a few parsnips carrots and turnips from the farmers fields other animals are quite safe in the winter they live mostly on roots fine day screamed the gulls as they swept through the air pity the frogs dont come out to enjoy it yes great pity chuckled the old muskrat how glad you would be to see them he smiled all around his little mouth and showed his gnawing teeth he knew that the frogs were better off asleep in the mud at the bottom of the pond than they would be sitting in the sunshine with a few hungry gulls above them the turtles were sleeping all winter too in the banks of the pond the eels were lying at the bottom stupid and drowsy and somewhere the wateradders were hidden away dreaming of spring of all the birds who lived by the water only the gulls were there and they were not popular it is true that they helped keep the pond sweet and clean and picked up and carried away many things which made the shore untidy still they were rude and talked too loudly and wore their feathers in such a way that they looked like fine large birds when really they were lean and skinny and small the other pond people said that was just like them always pretending to be more than they really were fifteen young muskrats all brothers and sisters and all born the summer before started off to look at the old home where they were children together that is to say they were not all there at once but there were five born early in the season and when they were old enough to look out for themselves five more came to live in the old nest and when these were old enough
 to leave the nest another five were born it doesnt mean so much to muskrats to be brothers and sisters as it does to some people still they remembered that they were related and they played more with each other than with those young muskrats who were only their cousins or friends their mother was very proud of them and loved to watch them running around on their short legs and to hear them slap their long scaly tails on the water when they dove they had short downy fur almost black on the back soft gray underneath and a reddish brown everywhere else there was very little fur on their tails or on their feet and those parts were black these fifteen children had been fairly well brought up but you can see that their mother had many cares so it is not strange if they sometimes behaved badly in some other families where there were only nine or ten babies all the season they had been brought up more strictly like all young muskrats they were full of fun and there were few pleasanter sights than to see them frolicking on a warm moonlight evening when they looked like brown balls rolling and bounding around on the shore or plunging into the water if they had all been exactly the same age it would have been even pleasanter for the oldest five would put on airs and call the others the children and the next five would call the youngest five babies although they were all well grown there was no chance for the youngest five to call other muskrats babies so when they were warm and well fed and goodnatured they laughed and said who cares when they were cold and hungry they slapped their tails on the ground or on the water and said dont you think youre smart when they got to talking so and their mother heard it she would say now children in such a way that they had to stop their father sometimes slapped them with his tail teasing is not so very bad you know although it is dreadfully silly but when people begin by teasing they sometimes get to saying things in earnesteven really hateful mean things and that was what made the muskrat father and mother stop it whenever they could now the whole fifteen crowded around the old summer home and some of them went in one way and some of them went in another for every muskrats summer house has several burrows leading to it when they reached the old nest at the end all of them tried to get in at once and they pushed each other around with their broad little heads scrambled and clutched and held on with their strong little feet five of them said its our turn first were the oldest and five more said well its our turn next anyway cause were next oldest the others said you might give up to us because were the youngest they pushed and scrambled some more and one of the youngest children said to one of the oldest well i dont care im just as big as you are which was so and the older one answered back well youre not so goodlooking which was also true then part of the brothers and sisters took sides with one and part took sides with the other what had been a lovely frolic became an unpleasant disgraceful quarrel and they said such things as these fore id make such a fuss whos making any more fuss than you are id like to know oh yes youre big enough but youre just as homely as you can be so there quit poking me you slapped your tail on my back im going to tell on you fellows i dare you to wont you catch it though and many more things which were even worse think of it fifteen young muskrats who really loved each other talking like that because they couldnt decide whether the oldest or the youngest or the halfwaybetween brothers and sisters should go first into the old nest and it didnt matter a bit who was oldest or who was youngest and it never would have happened had it not been for their dreadful habit of teasing just as they had become very hot and angry they heard their mothers voice say now children but they were too much excited to mind and they did not stop until their father came and slapped them with his tail then they kept still and listened to their mother she told them that they should leave the place at once and not one of them should even set foot in the old nest suppose somebody had gotten hurt she said this made the young muskrats look very sober for they knew that the muskrat who is hurt in winter never gets well after she had let them think about this for a while she said i shall punish you all for this then there was no quarrel among her children to see who should have the first turnnot at all one young muskrat said arent you going to let us play any more yes said she i shall let you play all the rest of the day but i shall choose the games the oldest five will play mud turtles in winter the next five will play frogs in winter and the youngest five will play snakes in winter the way to play these games is to lie perfectly still in some dark place and not say a word the young muskrats looked at each other sorrowfully they thought it sounded very much the same as being sent to bed for being naughty they did not dare say anything for they knew that although their mother was gentle as muskrats are most of the time she could be very severe so they went away quietly to play what she had told them they must but it was not much fun to play those games when all the others were having a fine time in the sunshine there were nine of the young muskrats who did not tease any after that even the other six were more careful

    THE GNOMIES


    As I lay awake in the white moonlight,
    I heard a sweet singing in the wood--
          'Out of bed,
          Sleepyhead,
          Put your white foot now,
          Here are we,
          'Neath the tree,
          Singing round the root now!'

    I looked out of window in the white moonlight,
    The trees were like snow in the wood--
          'Come away
          Child and play,
          Light wi' the gnomies;
          In a mound,
          Green and round,
          That's where their home is!
          'Honey sweet,
          Curds to eat,
          Cream and frumènty,
          Shells and beads,
          Poppy seeds,
          You shall have plenty.'

    But soon as I stooped in the dim moonlight
    To put on my stocking and my shoe,
    The sweet, sweet singing died sadly away,
    And the light of the morning peep'd through:
    Then instead of the gnomies there came a red robin
    To sing of the buttercups and dew.




    BLUEBELLS


    Where the bluebells and the wind are,
    Fairies in a ring I spied,
    And I heard a little linnet
    Singing near beside.

    Where the primrose and the dew are,
    Soon were sped the fairies all:
    Only now the green turf freshens,
    And the linnets call.




    LOVELOCKS


    I watched the Lady Caroline
    Bind up her dark and beauteous hair;
    Her face was rosy in the glass,
    And 'twixt the coils her hands would pass,
        White in the candleshine.

    Her bottles on the table lay,
    Stoppered yet sweet of violet;
    Her image in the mirror stooped
    To view those locks as lightly looped
        As cherry-boughs in May.

    The snowy night lay dim without,
    I heard the Waits their sweet song sing;
    The window smouldered keen with frost;
    Yet still she twisted, sleeked and tossed
        Her beauteous hair about.




    O DEAR ME!


    Here are crocuses, white, gold, grey!
      'O dear me!' says Marjorie May;
    Flat as a platter the blackberry blows:
      'O dear me!' says Madeleine Rose;
    The leaves are fallen, the swallows flown:
      'O dear me!' says Humphrey John;
    Snow lies thick where all night it fell:
      'O dear me!' says Emmanuel.




    TARTARY


    If I were Lord of Tartary,
      Myself and me alone,
    My bed should be of ivory,
      Of beaten gold my throne;
    And in my court should peacocks flaunt,
    And in my forests tigers haunt,
    And in my pools great fishes slant
      Their fins athwart the sun.

    If I were Lord of Tartary,
      Trumpeters every day
    To all my meals should summon me,
      And in my courtyards bray;
    And in the evenings lamps should shine,
    Yellow as honey, red as wine,
    While harp, and flute, and mandoline,
      Made music sweet and gay.

    If I were Lord of Tartary,
      I'd wear a robe of beads,
    White, and gold, and green they'd be--
      And small, and thick as seeds;
    And ere should wane the morning-star,
    I'd don my robe and scimitar,
    And zebras seven should draw my car
      Through Tartary's dark glades.

    Lord of the fruits of Tartary,
      Her rivers silver-pale!
    Lord of the hills of Tartary,
      Glen, thicket, wood, and dale!
    Her flashing stars, her scented breeze,
    Her trembling lakes, like foamless seas,
    Her bird-delighting citron-trees
      In every purple vale!




    THE BUCKLE


    I had a silver buckle,
    I sewed it on my shoe,
    And 'neath a sprig of mistletoe
    I danced the evening through!

    I had a bunch of cowslips,
    I hid 'em in a grot,
    In case the elves should come by night
    And me remember not.

    I had a yellow riband,
    I tied it in my hair,
    That, walking in the garden,
    The birds might see it there.

    I had a secret laughter,
    I laughed it near the wall:
    Only the ivy and the wind
    May tell of it at all.




    THE HARE


    In the black furrow of a field
    I saw an old witch-hare this night;
    And she cocked her lissome ear,
    And she eyed the moon so bright,
    And she nibbled o' the green;
    And I whispered 'Whsst! witch-hare,'
    Away like a ghostie o'er the field
    She fled, and left the moonlight there.




    BUNCHES OF GRAPES


    'Bunches of grapes,' says Timothy;
    'Pomegranates pink,' says Elaine;
    'A junket of cream and a cranberry tart
      For me,' says Jane.

    'Love-in-a-mist,' says Timothy;
    'Primroses pale,' says Elaine;
    'A nosegay of pinks and mignonette
      For me,' says Jane.

    'Chariots of gold,' says Timothy;
    'Silvery wings,' says Elaine;
    'A bumpity ride in a wagon of hay
      For me,' says Jane.




    JOHN MOULDY


    I spied John Mouldy in his cellar,
    Deep down twenty steps of stone;
    In the dusk he sat a-smiling,
      Smiling there alone.

    He read no book, he snuffed no candle;
    The rats ran in, the rats ran out;
    And far and near, the drip of water
      Went whisp'ring about.

    The dusk was still, with dew a-falling,
    I saw the Dog-star bleak and grim,
    I saw a slim brown rat of Norway
      Creep over him.

    I spied John Mouldy in his cellar,
    Deep down twenty steps of stone;
    In the dusk he sat a-smiling,
      Smiling there alone.




    THE FLY


    How large unto the tiny fly
      Must little things appear!--
    A rosebud like a feather bed,
      Its prickle like a spear;

    A dewdrop like a looking-glass,
      A hair like golden wire;
    The smallest grain of mustard-seed
      As fierce as coals of fire;

    A loaf of bread, a lofty hill;
      A wasp, a cruel leopard;
    And specks of salt as bright to see
      As lambkins to a shepherd.




    SONG


    O for a moon to light me home!
      O for a lanthorn green!
    For those sweet stars the Pleiades,
    That glitter in the twilight trees;
      O for a lovelorn taper! O
      For a lanthorn green!

    O for a frock of tartan!
      O for clear, wild, grey eyes!
    For fingers light as violets,
    'Neath branches that the blackbird frets;
      O for a thistly meadow! O
      For clear, wild grey eyes!

    O for a heart like almond boughs!
      O for sweet thoughts like rain!
    O for first-love like fields of grey,
    Shut April-buds at break of day!
      O for a sleep like music!
      For still dreams like rain!




    I SAW THREE WITCHES


    I saw three witches
    That bowed down like barley,
    And took to their brooms 'neath a louring sky,
    And, mounting a storm-cloud,
    Aloft on its margin,
    Stood black in the silver as up they did fly.

    I saw three witches
    That mocked the poor sparrows
    They carried in cages of wicker along,
    Till a hawk from his eyrie
    Swooped down like an arrow,
    And smote on the cages, and ended their song.

    I saw three witches
    That sailed in a shallop,
    All turning their heads with a truculent smile,
    Till a bank of green osiers
    Concealed their grim faces,
    Though I heard them lamenting for many a mile.

    I saw three witches
    Asleep in a valley,
    Their heads in a row, like stones in a flood,
    Till the moon, creeping upward,
    Looked white through the valley,
    And turned them to bushes in bright scarlet bud.




    THE SILVER PENNY


    'Sailorman, I'll give to you
      My bright silver penny,
    If out to sea you'll sail me
      And my dear sister Jenny.'

    'Get in, young sir, I'll sail ye
      And your dear sister Jenny,
    But pay she shall her golden locks
      Instead of your penny.'

    They sail away, they sail away,
      O fierce the winds blew!
    The foam flew in clouds,
      And dark the night grew!

    And all the wild sea-water
      Climbed steep into the boat;
    Back to the shore again
      Sail they will not.

    Drowned is the sailorman,
      Drowned is sweet Jenny,
    And drowned in the deep sea
      A bright silver penny.




    THE NIGHT-SWANS


    'Tis silence on the enchanted lake,
    And silence in the air serene,
    Save for the beating of her heart,
    The lovely-eyed Evangeline.

    She sings across the waters clear
    And dark with trees and stars between,
    The notes her fairy godmother
    Taught her, the child Evangeline.

    As might the unrippled pool reply,
    Faltering an answer far and sweet,
    Three swans as white as mountain snow
    Swim mantling to her feet.

    And still upon the lake they stay,
    Their eyes black stars in all their snow,
    And softly, in the glassy pool,
    Their feet beat darkly to and fro.

    She rides upon her little boat,
    Her swans swim through the starry sheen,
    Rowing her into Fairyland--
    The lovely-eyed Evangeline.

    'Tis silence on the enchanted lake,
    And silence in the air serene;
    Voices shall call in vain again
    On earth the child Evangeline.

    'Evangeline! Evangeline!'
    Upstairs, downstairs, all in vain.
    Her room is dim; her flowers faded;
    She answers not again.




    THE FAIRIES DANCING


    I heard along the early hills,
    Ere yet the lark was risen up,
    Ere yet the dawn with firelight fills
    The night-dew of the bramble-cup,--
    I heard the fairies in a ring
    Sing as they tripped a lilting round
    Soft as the moon on wavering wing.
    The starlight shook as if with sound,
    As if with echoing, and the stars
    Prankt their bright eyes with trembling gleams;
    While red with war the gusty Mars
    Rained upon earth his ruddy beams.
    He shone alone, adown the West,
    While I, behind a hawthorn-bush,
    Watched on the fairies flaxen-tressed
    The fires of the morning flush.
    Till, as a mist, their beauty died,
    Their singing shrill and fainter grew;
    And daylight tremulous and wide
    Flooded the moorland through and through;
    Till Urdon's copper weathercock
    Was reared in golden flame afar,
    And dim from moonlit dreams awoke
    The towers and groves of Arroar.




    REVERIE


    When slim Sophia mounts her horse
       And paces down the avenue,
    It seems an inward melody
         She paces to.

    Each narrow hoof is lifted high
      Beneath the dark enclust'ring pines,
    A silver ray within his bit
        And bridle shines.

    His eye burns deep, his tail is arched,
      And streams upon the shadowy air,
    The daylight sleeks his jetty flanks,
        His mistress' hair.

    Her habit flows in darkness down,
      Upon the stirrup rests her foot,
    Her brow is lifted, as if earth
        She heeded not.

    'Tis silent in the avenue,
      The sombre pines are mute of song,
    The blue is dark, there moves no breeze
        The boughs among.

    When slim Sophia mounts her horse
      And paces down the avenue,
    It seems an inward melody
        She paces to.




    THE THREE BEGGARS


    'Twas autumn daybreak gold and wild,
      While past St Ann's grey tower they shuffled,
    Three beggars spied a fairy-child
        In crimson mantle muffled.

    The daybreak lighted up her face
      All pink, and sharp, and emerald-eyed;
    She looked on them a little space,
        And shrill as hautboy cried:--

    'O three tall footsore men of rags
      Which walking this gold morn I see,
    What will ye give me from your bags
        For fairy kisses three?'

    The first, that was a reddish man,
      Out of his bundle takes a crust:
    'La, by the tombstones of St Ann,
        There's fee, if fee ye must!'

    The second, that was a chesnut man,
      Out of his bundle draws a bone:
    'La, by the belfry of St Ann,
        And all my breakfast gone!'

    The third, that was a yellow man,
      Out of his bundle picks a groat,
    'La, by the Angel of St Ann,
        And I must go without.'

    That changeling, lean and icy-lipped,
      Touched crust, and bone, and groat, and lo!
    Beneath her finger taper-tipped
        The magic all ran through.

    Instead of crust a peacock pie,
      Instead of bone sweet venison,
    Instead of groat a white lilie
        With seven blooms thereon.

    And each fair cup was deep with wine:
      Such was the changeling's charity,
    The sweet feast was enough for nine,
        But not too much for three.

    O toothsome meat in jelly froze!
      O tender haunch of elfin stag!
    O rich the odour that arose!
        O plump with scraps each bag!

    There, in the daybreak gold and wild,
      Each merry-hearted beggar man
    Drank deep unto the fairy child,
        And blessed the good St Ann.




    THE DWARF


    'Now, Jinnie, my dear, to the dwarf be off,
        That lives in Barberry Wood,
    And fetch me some honey, but be sure you don't laugh,--
      He hates little girls that are rude, are rude,
        He hates little girls that are rude.'

    Jane tapped at the door of the house in the wood,
        And the dwarf looked over the wall,
    He eyed her so queer, 'twas as much as she could
      To keep from laughing at all, at all,
        To keep from laughing at all.

    His shoes down the passage came clod, clod, clod,
        And when he opened the door,
    He croaked so harsh, 'twas as much as she could
      To keep from laughing the more, the more,
        To keep from laughing the more.

    As there, with his bushy red beard, he stood,
        Pricked out to double its size,
    He squinted so cross, 'twas as much as she could
      To keep the tears out of her eyes, her eyes,
        To keep the tears out of her eyes.

    He slammed the door, and went clod, clod, clod,
        But while in the porch she bides,
    He squealed so fierce, 'twas as much as she could
      To keep from cracking her sides, her sides,
        To keep from cracking her sides.

    He threw a pumpkin over the wall,
        And melons and apples beside,
    So thick in the air, that to see 'em all fall,
      She laughed, and laughed, till she cried, cried, cried,
        Jane laughed and laughed till she cried.

    Down fell her teardrops a pit-apat-pat,
        And red as a rose she grew;--
    'Kah! kah!' said the dwarf, 'is it crying you're at?
      It's the very worst thing you could do, do, do,
        It's the very worst thing you could do.'

    He slipped like a monkey up into a tree,
        He shook her down cherries like rain;
    'See now,' says he, cheeping, 'a blackbird I be,
      Laugh, laugh, little Jinnie, again-gain-gain,
        Laugh, laugh, little Jinnie, again.'

    Ah me! what a strange, what a gladsome duet
        From a house i' the deeps of a wood!
    Such shrill and such harsh voices never met yet
      A-laughing as loud as they could-could-could,
        A-laughing as loud as they could.

    Come Jinnie, come dwarf, cocksparrow, and bee,
        There's a ring gaudy-green in the dell,
    Sing, sing, ye sweet cherubs, that flit in the tree;
      La! who can draw tears from a well-well-well,
        Who ever drew tears from a well!




    ALULVAN


    The sun is clear of bird and cloud,
    The grass shines windless, grey, and still,
    In dusky ruin the owl dreams on,
    The cuckoo echoes on the hill;
      Yet soft along Alulvan's walks
        The ghost at noonday stalks.

    His eyes in shadow of his hat
    Stare on the ruins of his house;
    His cloak, up-fasten'd with a brooch,
    Of faded velvet grey as mouse,
      Brushes the roses as he goes:
        Yet wavers not one rose.

    The wild birds in a cloud fly up
    From their sweet feeding in the fruit;
    The droning of the bees and flies
    Rises gradual as a lute;
      Is it for fear the birds are flown,
        And shrills the insect-drone?

    Thick is the ivy o'er Alulvan,
    And crisp with summer-heat its turf;
    Far, far across its empty pastures
    Alulvan's sands are white with surf:
      And he himself is grey as sea,
        Watching beneath an elder-tree.

    All night the fretful, shrill Banshee
    Lurks in the chambers' dark festoons,
    Calling for ever, o'er garden and river,
    Through magpie changing of the moons:
      'Alulvan, O, alas! Alulvan,
        The doom of lone Alulvan!'




    THE PEDLAR


    There came a Pedlar to an evening house;
    Sweet Lettice, from her lattice looking down,
    Wondered what man he was, so curious
    His black hair dangled on his tattered gown:
    Then lifts he up his face, with glittering eyes,--
    'What will you buy, sweetheart?--Here's honeycomb,
    And mottled pippins, and sweet mulberry pies,
    Comfits and peaches, snowy cherry bloom,
    To keep in water for to make night sweet:
    All that you want, sweetheart,--come, taste and eat!'

    Ev'n with his sugared words, returned to her
    The clear remembrance of a gentle voice:--
    'And O! my child, should ever a flatterer
    Tap with his wares, and promise of all joys
    And vain sweet pleasures that on earth may be;
    Seal up your ears, sing some old happy song,
    Confuse his magic who is all mockery:
    His sweets are death.' Yet, still, how she doth long
    But just to taste, then shut the lattice tight,
    And hide her eyes from the delicious sight!

    'What must I pay?' she whispered. 'Pay!' says he,
    'Pedlar I am who through this wood do roam,
    One lock of hair is gold enough for me,
    For apple, peach, comfit, or honeycomb!'
    But from her bough a drowsy squirrel cried,
    'Trust him not, Lettice, trust, oh trust him not!'
    And many another woodland tongue beside
    Rose softly in the silence--'Trust him not!'
    Then cried the Pedlar in a bitter voice,
    'What, in the thicket, is this idle noise?'

    A late, harsh blackbird smote him with her wings,
    As through the glade, dark in the dim, she flew;
    Yet still the Pedlar his old burden sings,--
    'What, pretty sweetheart, shall I show to you?
    Here's orange ribands, here's a string of pearls,
    Here's silk of buttercup and pansy glove,
    A pin of tortoiseshell for windy curls,
    A box of silver, scented sweet with clove:
    Come now,' he says, with dim and lifted face,
    'I pass not often such a lonely place.'

    'Pluck not a hair!' a hidden rabbit cried,
    'With but one hair he'll steal thy heart away,
    Then only sorrow shall thy lattice hide:
    Go in! all honest pedlars come by day.'
    There was dead silence in the drowsy wood;
    'Here's syrup for to lull sweet maids to sleep;
    And bells for dreams, and fairy wine and food
    All day thy heart in happiness to keep';--
    And now she takes the scissors on her thumb,--
    'O, then, no more unto my lattice come!'

    O sad the sound of weeping in the wood!
    Now only night is where the Pedlar was;
    And bleak as frost upon a too-sweet bud
    His magic steals in darkness, O alas!
    Why all the summer doth sweet Lettice pine?
    And, ere the wheat is ripe, why lies her gold
    Hid 'neath fresh new-pluckt sprigs of eglantine?
    Why all the morning hath the cuckoo tolled,
    Sad to and fro in green and secret ways,
    With lonely bells the burden of his days?

    And, in the market-place, what man is this
    Who wears a loop of gold upon his breast,
    Stuck heartwise; and whose glassy flatteries
    Take all the townsfolk ere they go to rest
    Who come to buy and gossip? Doth his eye
    Remember a face lovely in a wood?
    O people! hasten, hasten, do not buy
    His woful wares; the bird of grief doth brood
    There where his heart should be; and far away
    Dew lies on grave-flowers this selfsame day!




    THE GREY WOLF


    'A fagot, a fagot, go fetch for the fire, son!'
      'O, Mother, the wolf looks in at the door!'
    'Cry Shoo! now, cry Shoo! thou fierce grey wolf fly, now;
      Haste thee away, he will fright thee no more.'

    'I ran, O, I ran, but the grey wolf ran faster,
      O, Mother, I cry in the air at thy door,
    Cry Shoo! now, cry Shoo! but his fangs were so cruel,
      Thy son (save his hatchet) thou'lt never see more.'




    THE OGRE


    'Tis moonlight on Trebarwith Vale,
      And moonlight on an Ogre keen,
    Who prowling hungry through the dale
      A lone cottage hath seen.

    Small with thin smoke ascending up
      Three casements and a door:--
    The Ogre eager is to sup,
      And here seems dainty store.

    Sweet as a larder to a mouse,
      So to him staring down,
    Seemed the sweet-windowed moonlit house,
      With jasmine overgrown.

    He snorted, as the billows snort
      In darkness of the night,
    Betwixt his lean locks tawny-swart,
      He glowered on the sight.

    Into the garden sweet with peas
      He put his wooden shoe,
    And bending back the apple trees
      Crept covetously through;

    Then, stooping, with an impious eye
      Stared through the lattice small,
    And spied two children which did lie
      Asleep, against the wall.

    Into their dreams no shadow fell,
      Of his disastrous thumb
    Groping discreet, and gradual,
      Across the quiet room.

    But scarce his nail had scraped the cot
      Wherein these children lay,
    As if his malice were forgot,
      It suddenly did stay.

    For faintly in the ingle-nook
      He heard a cradlesong,
    That rose into his thoughts and woke
      Terror them among.

    For she who in the kitchen sat
      Darning by the fire,
    Guileless of what he would be at,
      Sang sweet as wind or wire:--

    'Lullay, thou little tiny child,
      By-by, lullay, lullie;
    Jesu of glory, meek and mild,
      This night remember ye!

    'Fiend, witch, and goblin, foul and wild,
      He deems 'em smoke to be;
    Lullay, thou little tiny child,
      By-by, lullay, lullie!'

    The Ogre lifted up his eyes
      Into the moon's pale ray,
    And gazed upon her leopard-wise,
      Cruel and clear as day;

    He snarled in gluttony and fear:
      'The wind blows dismally,
    Jesu in storm my lambs be near,
      By-by, lullay, lullie!'

    And like a ravenous beast which sees
      The hunter's icy eye,
    So did this wretch in wrath confess
      Sweet Jesu's mastery.

    He lightly drew his greedy thumb
      From out that casement pale,
    And strode, enormous, swiftly home,
      Whinnying down the dale.




    DAME HICKORY


    'Dame Hickory, Dame Hickory,
    Here's sticks for your fire,
    Furze-twigs, and oak-twigs,
    And beech-twigs, and briar!'
    But when old Dame Hickory came for to see,
    She found 'twas the voice of the false faerie.

    'Dame Hickory, Dame Hickory,
    Here's meat for your broth,
    Goose-flesh, and hare's flesh,
    And pig's trotters both!'
    But when old Dame Hickory came for to see,
    She found 'twas the voice of the false faerie.

    'Dame Hickory, Dame Hickory,
    Here's a wolf at your door,
    His teeth grinning white,
    And his tongue wagging sore!'
    'Nay!' said Dame Hickory, 'ye false faerie!'
    But a wolf 'twas indeed, and famished was he.

    'Dame Hickory, Dame Hickory,
    Here's buds for your tomb,
    Bramble, and lavender,
    And rosemary bloom!'
    'Hush!' said Dame Hickory, 'ye false faerie,
    Ye cry like a wolf, ye do, and trouble poor me.'




    THE PILGRIM


    'Shall we carry now your bundle,
        You old grey man?

    Over hill and over meadow,
    Lighter than an owlet's shadow,
    We will whirl it through the air,
    Through blue regions shrill and bare;

    Shall we carry now your bundle,
        You old grey man?'

    The Pilgrim lifted up his eyes
    And saw three fiends, in the skies,
    Stooping o'er that lonely place
        Evil in form and face.

    'O leave me, leave me, leave me,
        Ye three wild fiends!

    Far it is my feet must wander,
    And my city lieth yonder;
    I must bear my bundle alone,
    Help nor solace suffer none:

    O leave me, leave me, leave me,
        Ye three wild fiends!'

    The fiends stared down with greedy eye,
    Fanning the chill air duskily,
    'Twixt their hoods they stoop and cry:--

    'Shall we smooth the path before you,
        You old grey man?

    Sprinkle it green with gilded showers,
    Strew it o'er with painted flowers?
    Shall we blow sweet airs on it,
    Lure the magpie there to flit?

    Shall we smooth the path before you,
        You old grey man?'

    'O silence, silence, silence!
        Ye three wild fiends!

    Over bog, and fen, and boulder,
    I must bear it on my shoulder,
    Beaten of wind, torn of briar,
    Smitten of rain, parched of fire:

    O silence, silence, silence!
        Ye three wild fiends!'

    It seemed a smoke obscured the air,
    Bright lightning quivered in the gloom,
    And a faint voice of thunder spake
    Far in the lone hill-hollows--'Come!'
    Then half in fury, half in dread,
    The fiends drew closer down and said:--

    'Grey old man but sleep awhile;
        Sad old man!

    Thorn, and dust, and ice, and heat;
    Tarry now, sit down and eat;
    Heat, and ice, and dust, and thorn;
    Stricken, footsore, parched, forlorn,--
    Juice of purple grape shall be
    Youth and solace unto thee.

    With sweet wire and reed we'll haunt you;
    Songs of the valley shall enchant you;
    Rest now, lest this night you die:
    Sweet be now our lullaby:

    'Grey old man, come sleep awhile,
        Stubborn old man!'

    The pilgrim crouches terrified
    At stooping hood, and glassy face,
    Gloating, evil, side by side;
    Terror and hate brood o'er the place;
    He flings his withered hands on high
    With a bitter, breaking cry:--

    'Leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me,
        Ye three wild fiends:
    If I lay me down in slumber,
      Then I lay me down in wrath;
    If I stir not in sweet dreaming,
      Then I wither in my path;
    If I hear sweet voices singing,
        'Tis a demon's lullaby,
    And in "hideous storm and terror"
        Wake but to die!'

    And even while he spake, the sun
    From the sweet hills pierced the gloom,
    Kindling th' affrighted fiends upon.
    Wild flapped their wings, as if in doom,
    He heard a dismal hooting laughter:--

    Nought but a little rain fell after,
    And from the cloud whither they flew
    A storm-sweet lark rose in the blue:
    And his bundle seemed of flowers
        In his solitary hours.




    THE GAGE


    'Lady Jane, O Lady Jane!
    Your hound hath broken bounds again,
      And chased my timorous deer, O;
        If him I see,
        That hour he'll dee;
      My brakes shall be his bier, O.'

    'Lord Aërie, Lord Aërie,
    My hound, I trow, is fleet and free,
      He's welcome to your deer, O;
        Shoot, shoot you may,
        He'll gang his way,
      Your threats we nothing fear, O.'

    He's fetched him in, he's fetched him in,
    Gone all his swiftness, all his din,
      White fang, and glowering eye, O:
        'Here is your beast,
        And now at least
      My herds in peace shall lie, O.'

    "In peace!" my lord, O mark me well!
    For what my jolly hound befell
      You shall sup twenty-fold, O!
        For every tooth
        Of his, i'sooth,
      A stag in pawn I hold, O.

    'Huntsman and horn, huntsman and horn,
    Shall scare your heaths and coverts lorn,
      Braying 'em shrill and clear, O;
        But lone and still
        Shall lift each hill,
      Each valley wan and sere, O.

    'Ride up you may, ride down you may,
    Lonely or trooped, by night or day,
      My hound shall haunt you ever:
        Bird, beast, and game
        Shall dread the same,
      The wild fish of your river.'

    Her cheek is like the angry rose,
    Her eye with wrath and pity flows:
      He gazes fierce and round, O,--
        'Dear Lord!' he says,
        'What loveliness
      To waste upon a hound, O.

    'I'd give my stags, my hills and dales,
    My stormcocks and my nightingales
      To have undone this deed, O;
        For deep beneath
        My heart is death
      Which for her love doth bleed, O.'

    Wanders he up, wanders he down,
    On foot, a-horse, by night and noon:
      His lands are bleak and drear, O;
        Forsook his dales
        Of nightingales,
      Forsook his moors of deer, O.

    Forsook his heart, ah me! of mirth;
    There's nothing lightsome left on earth:
      Only one scene is fain, O,
        Where far remote
        The moonbeams gloat,
      And sleeps the lovely Jane, O.

    Until an eve when lone he went,
    Gnawing his beard in dreariment,
      Lo! from a thicket hidden,
        Lovely as flower
        In April hour,
      Steps forth a form unbidden.

    'Get ye now down, Lord Aërie,
    I'm troubled so I'm like to dee,'
      She cries, 'twixt joy and grief, O;
        'The hound is dead,
        When all is said,
      But love is past belief, O.

    'Nights, nights I've lain your lands to see,
    Forlorn and still--and all for me,
      All for a foolish curse, O;
        Now here am I
        Come out to die,
      To live unlov'd is worse, O!'

    In faith, this lord, in that lone dale,
    Hears now a sweeter nightingale,
      And lairs a tend'rer deer, O;
        His sorrow goes
        Like mountain snows
      In waters sweet and clear, O!

    Let the hound bay in Shadowland,
    Tuning his ear to understand
      What voice hath tamed this Aërie;
        Chafe, chafe he may
        The stag all day,
      And never thirst nor weary.

    Now here he smells, now there he smells,
    Winding his voice along the dells,
      Till grey flows up the morn, O;
        Then hies again
        To Lady Jane,
      No longer now forlorn, O.

    Ay, as it were a bud, did break
    To loveliness for Aërie's sake,
      So she in beauty moving
        Rides at his hand
        Across his land,
      Beloved as well as loving.




    AS LUCY WENT A-WALKING


    As Lucy went a-walking one wintry morning fine,
    There sate three crows upon a bough, and three times three is nine:
    Then 'O!' said Lucy, in the snow, 'it's very plain to see
    A witch has been a-walking in the fields in front of me.'

    Then stept she light and heedfully across the frozen snow,
    And plucked a bunch of elder-twigs that near a pool did grow:
    And, by and by, she comes to seven shadows in one place
    All stretched by seven poplar-trees against the sun's bright face.

    She looks to left, she looks to right, and in the midst she sees
    A little well of water clear and frozen 'neath the trees;
    Then down beside its margent in the crusty snow she kneels,
    And hears a magic belfry a-ringing with sweet bells.

    But when the belfry ceased to sound yet nothing could she see,
    Save only frozen water in the shadow of the tree.
    But presently she lifted up her eyes along the snow,
    And sees a witch in brindled shawl a-frisking to and fro.

    Her shoes were buckled scarlet that capered to and fro,
    And all her rusty locks were wreathed with twisted mistletoe;
    But never a dint, or mark, or print, in the whiteness for to see,
    Though danced she high, though danced she fast, though danced she
        lissomely.

    It seemed 'twas diamonds in the air, or little flakes of frost;
    It seemed 'twas golden smoke around, or sunbeams lightly tost;
    It seemed an elfin music like to reeds and warblers rose:
    'Nay!' Lucy said, 'it is the wind that through the branches flows.'

    And as she peeps, and as she peeps, 'tis no more one, but three,
    And eye of bat, and downy wing of owl within the tree,
    And the bells of that sweet belfry a-pealing as before,
    And now it is not three she sees, and now it is not four.

    'O! who are ye,' sweet Lucy cries, 'that in a dreadful ring,
    All muffled up in brindled shawls, do caper, frisk, and spring?'
    'A witch and witches, one and nine,' they straight to her reply,
    And looked upon her narrowly, with green and needle eye.

    Then Lucy sees in clouds of gold sweet cherry-trees upgrow,
    And bushes of red roses that bloomed above the snow;
    She smells all faint the almond-boughs that blow so wild and fair,
    And doves with milky eyes ascend fluttering in the air.

    Clear flow'rs she sees, like tulip buds, go floating by like birds,
    With wavering tips that warbled sweetly strange enchanted words;
    And as with ropes of amethyst the boughs with lamps were hung,
    And clusters of green emeralds like fruit upon them clung.

    'O witches nine, ye dreadful nine, O witches seven and three!
    Whence come these wondrous things that I this Christmas morning see?'
    But straight, as in a clap, when she of Christmas says the word,
    Here is the snow, and there the sun, but never bloom nor bird;

    Nor warbling flame, nor gloaming-rope of amethyst there shows,
    Nor bunches of green emeralds, nor belfry, well, and rose,
    Nor cloud of gold, nor cherry-tree, nor witch in brindled shawl,
    But like a dream which vanishes, so vanished were they all.

    When Lucy sees, and only sees, three crows upon a bough,
    And earthly twigs, and bushes hidden white in driven snow,
    Then 'O!' said Lucy, 'three times three is nine--I plainly see
    Some witch has been a-walking in the fields in front of me.'




    THE ENGLISHMAN


    I met a sailor in the woods,
      A silver ring wore he,
    His hair hung black, his eyes shone blue,
      And thus he said to me:--

    'What country, say, of this round earth,
      What shore of what salt sea,
    Be this, my son, I wander in,
      And looks so strange to me?'

    Says I, 'O foreign sailorman,
      In England now you be,
    This is her wood, and this her sky,
      And that her roaring sea.'

    He lifts his voice yet louder,
      'What smell be this,' says he,
    'My nose on the sharp morning air
      Snuffs up so greedily?'

    Says I, 'It is wild roses
      Do smell so winsomely,
    And winy briar too,' says I,
      'That in these thickets be.'

    'And oh!' says he, 'what leetle bird
      Is singing in yon high tree,
    So every shrill and long-drawn note
      Like bubbles breaks in me?'

    Says I, 'It is the mavis
      That perches in the tree,
    And sings so shrill, and sings so sweet,
      When dawn comes up the sea.'

    At which he fell a-musing,
      And fixed his eye on me,
    As one alone 'twixt light and dark
      A spirit thinks to see

    'England!' he whispers soft and harsh,
      'England!' repeated he,
    'And briar, and rose, and mavis,
      A-singing in yon high tree.

    'Ye speak me true, my leetle son,
      So--so, it came to me,
    A-drifting landwards on a spar,
      And grey dawn on the sea.

    'Ay, ay, I could not be mistook;
      I knew them leafy trees,
    I knew that land so witcherie sweet,
      And that old noise of seas.

    'Though here I've sailed a score of years,
      And heard 'em, dream or wake,
    Lap small and hollow 'gainst my cheek,
      On sand and coral break;

    '"Yet now, my leetle son," says I,
      A-drifting on the wave,
    "That land I see so safe and green
      Is England, I believe.

    '"And that there wood is English wood,
      And this here cruel sea,
    The selfsame old blue ocean
      Years gone remembers me,

    "A-sitting with my bread and butter
      Down ahind yon chitterin' mill;
    And this same Marinere"--(that's me),
      "Is that same leetle Will!--

    "That very same wee leetle Will
      Eating his bread and butter there,
    A-looking on the broad blue sea
      Betwixt his yaller hair!"

    'And here be I, my son, throwed up
      Like corpses from the sea,
    Ships, stars, winds, tempests, pirates past,
      Yet leetle Will I be!'

    He said no more, that sailorman,
      But in a reverie
    Stared like the figure of a ship
      With painted eyes to sea.




    THE PHANTOM


    'Upstairs in the large closet, child,
      This side the blue-room door,
    Is an old Bible, bound in leather,
      Standing upon the floor;

    'Go with this taper, bring it me;
      Carry it on your arm;
    It is the book on many a sea
      Hath stilled the waves' alarm.'

    Late the hour, dark the night,
      The house is solitary,
    Feeble is a taper's light
      To light poor Ann to see.

    Her eyes are yet with visions bright
      Of sylph and river, flower and fay,
    Now through a narrow corridor
      She takes her lonely way.

    Vast shadows on the heedless walls
      Gigantic loom, stoop low:
    Each little hasty footfall calls
      Hollowly to and fro.

    In the dim solitude her heart
      Remembers tearlessly
    White winters when her mother was
      Her loving company.

    Now in the dark clear glass she sees
      A taper mocking hers,--
    A phantom face of light blue eyes,
      Reflecting phantom fears.

    Around her loom the vacant rooms,
      Wind the upward stairs,
    She climbs on into a loneliness
      Only her taper shares.

    Her grandmother is deaf with age;
      A garden of moonless trees
    Would answer not though she should cry
      In anguish on her knees.

    So that she scarcely heeds--so fast
      Her pent-up heart doth beat--
    When, faint along the corridor,
      Falleth the sound of feet:--

    Sounds lighter than silk slippers make
      Upon a ballroom floor, when sweet
    Violin and 'cello wake
      Music for twirling feet.

    O! in an old unfriendly house,
      What shapes may not conceal
    Their faces in the open day,
      At night abroad to steal?

    Even her taper seems with fear
      To languish small and blue;
    Far in the woods the winter wind
      Runs whistling through.

    A dreadful cold plucks at each hair,
      Her mouth is stretched to cry,
    But sudden, with a gush of joy,
      It narrows to a sigh.

    It is a wilding child which comes
      Swift through the corridor,
    Singing an old forgotten song,
      This ancient burden bore:--

    'Thorn, thorn, I wis,
    And roses twain,
      A red rose and a white,
    Stoop in the blossom, bee, and kiss
      A lonely child good-night.

    'Swim fish, sing bird,
    And sigh again,
      I that am lost am lone,
    Bee in the blossom never stirred
      Locks hid beneath a stone!'--

    Her eye was of the azure fire
      That hovers in wintry flame;
    Her raiment wild and yellow as furze
      That spouteth out the same;

    And in her hand she bore no flower,
      But on her head a wreath
    Of faded flag-flowers that did yet
      Smell sweetly after death.

    Clear was the light of loveliness
      That lit her face like rain;
    And sad the mouth that uttered
      Her immemorial strain.

        *     *     *     *

    Gloomy with night the corridor
      Is now that she is gone,
    Albeit this solitary child
      No longer seems alone.

    Fast though her taper dwindles down,
      Heavy and thick the tome,
    A beauty beyond fear to dim
      Haunts now her alien home.

    Ghosts in the world malignant, grim,
      Vex many a wood, and glen,
    And house, and pool,--the unquiet ghosts
      Of dead and restless men.

    But in her grannie's house this spirit--
      A child as lone as she--
    Pining for love not found on earth,
      Ann dreams again to see.

    Seated upon her tapestry-stool,
      Her fairy-book laid by,
    She gazes in the fire, knowing
      She hath sweet company.




    THE MILLER AND HIS SON


    A twangling harp for Mary,
      A silvery flute for John,
    And now we'll play the livelong day,
      'The Miller and his Son.'

    'The Miller went a-walking
      All in the forest high,
    He sees three doves a-flitting
      Against the dark blue sky:

    'Says he, "My son, now follow
      These doves so white and free,
    That cry above the forest,
      And surely cry to thee."

    "I go, my dearest Father,
      But O! I sadly fear,
    These doves so white will lead me far,
      But never bring me near."

    'He kisses the Miller,
      He cries, "Awhoop to ye!"
    And straightway through the forest
      Follows the wood-doves three.

    'There came a sound of weeping
      To the Miller in his Mill;
    Red roses in a thicket
      Bloomed over near his wheel;

    'Three stars shone wild and brightly
      Above the forest dim:
    But never his dearest son
      Returns again to him.

    'The cuckoo shall call "Cuckoo!"
      In vain along the vale,
    The linnet, and the blackbird,
      The mournful nightingale;

    'The Miller hears and sees not,
      A-thinking of his son;
    His toppling wheel is silent;
      His grinding done.

    '"Ye doves so white," he weepeth,
      "Ye roses on the tree,
    Ye stars that shine so brightly,
      Ye shine in vain for me!"

    'I bade him follow, follow,
      He said, "O Father dear,
    These doves so white will lead me far
      But never bring me near!"'

    A twangling harp for Mary,
      A silvery flute for John,
    And now we'll play the livelong day,
      'The Miller and his Son.'




    DOWN-ADOWN-DERRY


    Down-adown-derry,
    Sweet Annie Maroon,
    Gathering daisies
    In the meadows of Doone,
    Sees a white fairy
    Skip buxom and free
    Where the waters go brawling
    In rills to the sea;
        Singing down-adown-derry.

    Down-adown-derry,
    Sweet Annie Maroon
    Through the green grasses
    Runs fleetly and soon,
    And lo! on a lily
    She sees one recline
    Whose eyes in her wee face
    Like the water-sparks shine;
        Singing down-adown-derry.

    Down-adown-derry,
    And shrill was her tune:--
    'Come to my water-house,
    Annie Maroon,
    Come in your pink gown,
    Your curls on your head,
    To wear the white samite
    And rubies instead';
        Singing down-adown-derry.

    'Down-adown-derry,
    Lean fish of the sea,
    Bring lanthorns for feasting
    The gay Faërie;
    And it's dancing on sand 'tis
    That's smoother than wool;--
    Foam-fruit and wild honey
    To pleasure you full';
        Singing down-adown-derry.

    Down-adown-derry,
    Sweet Annie Maroon
    Looked large on the fairy
    Curled wan as the moon;
    And all the grey ripples
    To the Mill racing by,
    With harps and with timbrels
    Did ringing reply;
        Singing down-adown-derry.

    'Down-adown-derry,'
    Sang the Fairy of Doone,
    Piercing the heart of
    Sweet Annie Maroon;
    And lo! when like roses
    The clouds of the sun
    Faded at dusk, gone
    Was Annie Maroon;
        Singing down-adown-derry.

    Down-adown-derry,
    The daisies are few;
    Frost twinkles powd'ry
    In haunts of the dew;
    Only the robin
    Perched on a white thorn,
    Can comfort the heart of
    A father forlorn;
        Singing down-adown-derry.

    Down-adown-derry,
    There's snow in the air;
    Ice where the lily
    Bloomed waxen and fair;
    He may call o'er the water,
    Cry--cry through the Mill,
    But Annie Maroon, alas!
    Answer ne'er will;
        Singing down-adown-derry.




    THE SUPPER


    A wolf he pricks with eyes of fire
    Across the night's o'ercrusted snows,
        Seeking his prey,
        He pads his way
    Where Jane benighted goes,
      Where Jane benighted goes.

    He curdles the bleak air with ire,
    Ruffling his hoary raiment through,
        And lo! he sees
        Beneath the trees
    Where Jane's light footsteps go,
      Where Jane's light footsteps go.

    No hound peals thus in wicked joy,
    He snaps his muzzle in the snows,
        His five-clawed feet
        Do scamper fleet
    Where Jane's bright lanthorn shows,
      Where Jane's bright lanthorn shows.

    Now his greed's green doth gaze unseen
    On a pure face of wilding rose,
        Her amber eyes
        In fear's surprise
    Watch largely as she goes,
      Watch largely as she goes.

    Salt wells his hunger in his jaws,
    His lust it revels to and fro,
        Yet small beneath
        A soft voice saith,
    'Jane shall in safety go,
      Jane shall in safety go.'

    He lurched as if a fiery lash
    Had scourged his hide, and through and through,
        His furious eyes
        O'erscanned the skies,
    But nearer dared not go,
      But nearer dared not go.

    He reared like wild Bucephalus,
    His fangs like spears in him uprose,
        Ev'n to the town
        Jane's flitting gown
    He grins on as she goes,
      He grins on as she goes.

    In fierce lament he howls amain,
    He scampers, marvelling in his throes
        What brought him there
        To sup on air,
    While Jane unarmèd goes,
      While Jane unarmèd goes.




    THE ISLE OF LONE


    Three dwarfs there were which lived on an isle,
      And the name of the isle was Lone,
    And the names of the dwarfs were Alliolyle,
      Lallerie, Muziomone.

    Alliolyle was green of een,
      Lallerie light of locks,
    Muziomone was mild of mien,
      As ewes in April flocks.

    Their house was small and sweet of the sea,
      And pale as the Malmsey wine;
    Their bowls were three, and their beds were three,
      And their nightcaps white were nine.

    Their beds were of the holly-wood,
      Their combs of the tortoiseshell,
    Their mirrors clear as wintry flood,
      Frozen dark and snell.

    So each would lie on his plumpy pillow,
      The moon for company,
    And hear the parrot scream to the billow,
      And the billow roar reply.--

    Sulphur parrots, and parrots red,
      Scarlet, and flame, and green;
    And five-foot apes that jargonèd
      In feathery-tufted treen.

    And oh, or ever the dawning shed
      On dreams a narrow flame,
    Three gaping dwarfs gat out of bed
      And gazed upon the same.

    At dawn they fished, at noon they snared
      Young foxes in the dells,
    At even on dew-berries they fared,
      And blew in their twisted shells.

    Dark was the sea they gambolled in,
      And thick with silver fish,
    Dark as green glass blown clear and thin
      To be a monarch's dish.

    They sate to sup in a jasmine bower,
      Lit pale with flies of fire,
    Their bowls the hue of the iris-flower,
      And lemon their attire.

    Sweet wine in little cups they sipped,
      And golden honeycomb
    Into their bowls of cream they dipped,
      Whipt light and white as foam.

    Alliolyle, where the salt sea flows,
      Taught three old apes to sing,
    And there to the moon, like a full-blown rose,
      They capered in a ring.

    But down to the shore skipped Lallerie,
      His parrot on his thumb,
    And the twain they scritched in mockery,
      While the dancers go and come.

    So, alas! in the evening, rosy and still,
      Light-haired Lallerie
    Bitterly quarrelled with Alliolyle
      By the yellow-sanded sea.

    The rising moon swam sweet and large
      Before their furious eyes,
    And they rolled and rolled to the coral marge
      Where the surf for ever cries.

    Too late, too late, comes Muziomone:
      Clear in the clear green sea
    Alliolyle lies not alone,
      But clasped with Lallerie.

    He blows on his shell plaintive notes;
      Ape, parraquito, bee
    Flock where a shoe on the salt wave floats,--
      The shoe of Lallerie.

    He fetches nightcaps, one and nine,
      Grey apes he dowers three,
    His house as fair as the Malmsey wine
      Seems sad as cypress-tree.

    Three bowls he brims with honeycomb
      To feast the bumble bees,
    Saying, 'O bees, be this your home,
      For grief is on the seas!'

    He sate him lone in a coral grot,
      At the flowing of the tide;
    When ebbed the billow, there was not,
      Save coral, aught beside.

    So hairy apes in three white beds,
      And nightcaps, one and nine,
    On moonlit pillows lay three heads
      Bemused with dwarfish wine.

    A tomb of coral, the dirge of bee,
      The grey apes' guttural groan
    For Alliolyle, for Lallerie,
      For thee, O Muziomone!




    THE SLEEPING BEAUTY


    The scent of bramble sweets the air,
      Amid her folded sheets she lies,
    The gold of evening in her hair,
      The blue of morn shut in her eyes.

    How many a changing moon hath lit
      The unchanging roses of her face!
    Her mirror ever broods on it
      In silver stillness of the days.

    Oft flits the moth on filmy wings
      Into his solitary lair;
    Shrill evensong the cricket sings
      From some still shadow in her hair.

    In heat, in snow, in wind, in flood,
      She sleeps in lovely loneliness,
    Half folded like an April bud
      On winter-haunted trees.




    THE HORN


    Hark! is that a horn I hear,
      In cloudland winding sweet--
    And bell-like clash of bridle-rein,
      And silver-shod light feet?

    Is it the elfin laughter of
      Fairies riding faint and high,
    'Neath the branches of the moon,
      Straying through the starry sky?

    Is it in the globèd dew
      Such sweet melodies may fall?
    Wood and valley--all are still,
      Hushed the shepherd's call.

    Hark! is that a horn I hear
      In cloudland winding sweet?
    Or gloomy goblins marching out
      Their captain Puck to greet?




    CAPTAIN LEAN


    Out of the East a hurricane
      Swept down on Captain Lean--
    That mariner and gentleman
      Will ne'er again be seen.

    He sailed his ship against the foes
      Of his own country dear,
    But now in the trough of the billows
      An aimless course doth steer.

    Powder was violets to his nostril,
      Sweet the din of the fighting-line,
    Now he is flotsam on the seas,
      And his bones are bleached with brine.

    The stars move up along the sky,
      The moon she shines so bright,
    And in that solitude the foam
      Sparkles unearthly white.

    This is the tomb of Captain Lean,
      Would a straiter please his soul?
    I trow he sleeps in peace,
      Howsoever the billows roll!




    THE PORTRAIT OF A WARRIOR


    His brow is seamed with line and scar;
      His cheek is red and dark as wine;
    The fires as of a Northern star
      Beneath his cap of sable shine.

    His right hand, bared of leathern glove,
      Hangs open like an iron gin,
    You stoop to see his pulses move,
      To hear the blood sweep out and in.

    He looks some king, so solitary
      In earnest thought he seems to stand,
    As if across a lonely sea
      He gazed impatient of the land.

    Out of the noisy centuries
      The foolish and the fearful fade;
    Yet burn unquenched these warrior eyes,
      Time hath not dimmed nor death dismayed.




    HAUNTED


    From out the wood I watched them shine,--
      The windows of the haunted house,
    Now ruddy as enchanted wine,
      Now dim as flittermouse.

    There went a thin voice piping airs
      Along the grey and crooked walks,--
    A garden of thistledown and tares,
      Bright leaves, and giant stalks.

    The twilight rain shone at its gates,
      Where long-leaved grass in shadow grew;
    And black in silence to her mates
      A voiceless raven flew.

    Lichen and moss the lone stones greened,
      Green paths led lightly to its door,
    Keen from her lair the spider leaned,
      And dusk to darkness wore.

    Amidst the sedge a whisper ran,
      The West shut down a heavy eye,
    And like last tapers, few and wan,
      The watch-stars kindled in the sky.




    THE RAVEN'S TOMB


    'Build me my tomb,' the Raven said,
    'Within the dark yew-tree,
    So in the Autumn yewberries
    Sad lamps may burn for me.
    Summon the haunted beetle,
    From twilight bud and bloom,
    To drone a gloomy dirge for me
    At dusk above my tomb.
    Beseech ye too the glowworm
    To bear her cloudy flame,
    Where the small, flickering bats resort,
    Whistling in tears my name.
    Let the round dew a whisper make,
    Welling on twig and thorn;
    And only the grey cock at night
    Call through his silver horn.
    And you, dear sisters, don your black
    For ever and a day,
    To show how sweet a raven
    In his tomb is laid away.'




    THE CHRISTENING


    The bells chime clear,
    Soon will the sun behind the hills sink down;
    Come, little Ann, your baby brother dear
    Lies in his christening-gown.

    His godparents
    Are all across the fields stepped on before,
    And wait beneath the crumbling monuments,
    This side the old church door.

    Your mammie dear
    Leans frail and lovely on your daddie's arm;
    Watching her chick, 'twixt happiness and fear,
    Lest he should come to harm.

    All to be blest
    Full soon in the clear heavenly water, he
    Sleeps on unwitting of't, his little breast
    Heaving so tenderly.

    I carried you,
    My little Ann, long since on this same quest,
    And from the painted windows a pale hue
    Lit golden on your breast;

    And then you woke,
    Chill as the holy water trickled down,
    And, weeping, cast the window a strange look,
    Half smile, half infant frown.

    I scarce could hear
    The larks a-singing in the green meadows,
    'Twas summertide, and budding far and near
    The hedges thick with rose.

    And now you're grown
    A little girl, and this same helpless mite
    Is come like such another bud half-blown,
    Out of the wintry night.

    Time flies, time flies!
    And yet, bless me! 'tis little changed am I;
    May Jesu keep from tears those infant eyes,
    Be love their lullaby!




    THE MOTHER BIRD


    Through the green twilight of a hedge
    I peered, with cheek on the cool leaves pressed,
    And spied a bird upon a nest:
    Two eyes she had beseeching me
    Meekly and brave, and her brown breast
    Throbb'd hot and quick above her heart;
    And then she oped her dagger bill,--
    'Twas not a chirp, as sparrows pipe
    At break of day; 'twas not a trill,
    As falters through the quiet even;
    But one sharp solitary note,
    One desperate, fierce, and vivid cry
    Of valiant tears, and hopeless joy,
    One passionate note of victory:
    Off, like a fool afraid, I sneaked,
    Smiling the smile the fool smiles best,
    At the mother bird in the secret hedge
    Patient upon her lonely nest.




    THE CHILD IN THE STORY GOES TO BED


    I prythee, Nurse, come smooth my hair,
      And prythee, Nurse, unloose my shoe,
    And trimly turn my silken sheet
      Upon my quilt of gentle blue.

    My pillow sweet of lavender
      Smooth with an amiable hand,
    And may the dark pass peacefully by
      As in the hour-glass droops the sand.

    Prepare my cornered manchet sweet,
      And in my little crystal cup
    Pour out the blithe and flowering mead
      That forthwith I may sup.

    Withdraw my curtains from the night,
      And let the crispèd crescent shine
    Upon my eyelids while I sleep,
      And soothe me with her beams benign.

    From far-away there streams the singing
      Of the mellifluent nightingale,--
    Surely if goblins hear her lay,
      They shall not o'er my peace prevail.

    Now quench my silver lamp, prythee,
      And bid the harpers harp that tune
    Fairies which haunt the meadowlands
      Sing clearly to the stars of June.

    And bid them play, though I in dreams
      No longer heed their pining strains,
    For I would not to silence wake
      When slumber o'er my senses wanes.

    You Angels bright who me defend,
      Enshadow me with curvèd wing,
    And keep me in the darksome night
      Till dawn another day do bring.




    THE CHILD IN THE STORY AWAKES


    The light of dawn rose on my dreams,
      And from afar I seemed to hear
    In sleep the mellow blackbird call
      Hollow and sweet and clear.

    I prythee, Nurse, my casement open,
      Wildly the garden peals with singing,
    And hooting through the dewy pines
      The goblins all are winging.

    O listen the droning of the bees,
      That in the roses take delight!
    And see a cloud stays in the blue
      Like an angel still and bright.

    The gentle sky is spread like silk,
      And, Nurse, the moon doth languish there,
    As if it were a perfect jewel
      In the morning's soft-spun hair.

    The greyness of the distant hills
      Is silvered in the lucid East,
    See, now the sheeny-plumèd cock
      Wags haughtily his crest.

    'O come you out, O come you out,
      Lily, and lavender, and lime;
    The kingcup swings his golden bell,
      And plumpy cherries drum the time.

    'O come you out, O come you out!
      Roses, and dew, and mignonette,
    The sun is in the steep blue sky,
      Sweetly the morning star is set.'




    THE LAMPLIGHTER


    When the light of day declineth,
    And a swift angel through the sky
    Kindleth God's tapers clear,
    With ashen staff the lamplighter
    Passeth along the darkling streets
    To light our earthly lamps;

    Lest, prowling in the darkness,
    The thief should haunt with quiet tread,
    Or men on evil errands set;
    Or wayfarers be benighted;
    Or neighbours bent from house to house
    Should need a guiding torch.

    He is like a needlewoman
    Who deftly on a sable hem
    Stitches in gleaming jewels;
    Or, haply, he is like a hero,
    Whose bright deeds on the long journey
    Are beacons on our way.

    And when in the East cometh morning,
    And the broad splendour of the sun,
    Then, with the tune of little birds
    Ringing on high, the lamplighter
    Passeth by each quiet house,
    And putteth out the lamps.




    CECIL


    Ye little elves, who haunt sweet dells,
    Where flowers with the dew commune,
    I pray you hush the child, Cecil,
        With windlike song.

    O little elves, so white she lieth,
    Each eyelid gentler than the flow'r
    Of the bramble, and her fleecy hair
        Like smoke of gold.

    O little elves, her hands and feet
    The angels muse upon, and God
    Hath shut a glimpse of Paradise
        In each blue eye.

    O little elves, her tiny body
    Like a white flake of snow it is,
    Drooping upon the pale green hood
        Of the chill snowdrop.

    O little elves, with elderflower,
    And pimpernel, and the white hawthorn,
    Sprinkle the journey of her dreams:
        And, little elves,

    Call to her magically sweet,
    Lest of her very tenderness
    She do forsake this rough brown earth
        And return to us no more.




    I MET AT EVE


    I met at eve the Prince of Sleep,
    His was a still and lovely face,
    He wandered through a valley steep
      Lovely in a lonely place.

    His garb was grey of lavender,
    About his brows a poppy-wreath
    Burned like dim coals, and everywhere
      The air was sweeter for his breath.

    His twilight feet no sandals wore,
    His eyes shone faint in their own flame,
    Fair moths that gloomed his steps before
      Seemed letters of his lovely name.

    His house is in the mountain ways,
    A phantom house of misty walls,
    Whose golden flocks at evening graze,
      And witch the moon with muffled calls.

    Upwelling from his shadowy springs
    Sweet waters shake a trembling sound,
    There flit the hoot-owl's silent wings,
      There hath his web the silkworm wound.

    Dark in his pools clear visions lurk,
    And rosy, as with morning buds,
    Along his dales of broom and birk
      Dreams haunt his solitary woods.

    I met at eve the Prince of Sleep,
    His was a still and lovely face,
    He wandered through a valley steep,
      Lovely in a lonely place.




    LULLABY


    Sleep, sleep, lovely white soul!
    The singing mouse sings plaintively,
    The sweet night-bird in the chesnut-tree--
    They sing together, bird and mouse,
    In starlight, in darkness, lonely, sweet,
    The wild notes and the faint notes meet--
      Sleep, sleep, lovely white soul!

    Sleep, sleep, lovely white soul!
    Amid the lilies floats the moth,
    The mole along his galleries goeth
    In the dark earth; the summer moon
    Looks like a shepherd through the pane
    Seeking his feeble lamb again--
      Sleep, sleep, lovely white soul!

    Sleep, sleep, lovely white soul!
    Time comes to keep night-watch with thee
    Nodding with roses; and the sea
    Saith 'Peace! Peace!' amid his foam
    White as thy night-clothes; 'O be still!'
    The wind cries up the whisp'ring hill--
      Sleep, sleep, lovely white soul!




    ENVOY


    There clung three roses to a stem,
    Did all their hues of summer don,
    But came a wind and troubled them,
      And all were gone.

    I heard three bells in unison
    Clap out some transient heart's delight,
    Time and the hour brought silence on
      And the dark night.

    Doth not Orion even set!
    O love, love, prove true alone,
    Till youthful hearts ev'n love forget,
      Then, child, begone!


my dear little friends you can never guess how much i have enjoyed writing these stories of the nighttime and i must tell you how i first came to think of doing so i once knew a girland she was not a very little girl eitherwho was afraid of the dark and i have known three boys who were as brave as could be by daylight but who would not run on an errand alone after the lamps were lighted they never seemed to think what a beautiful restful growing time the night is for plants and animals and even for themselves i thought that if they knew more of what happens between sunset and sunrise they would love the night as well as i it may be that you will never see bats flying freely or find the owls flapping silently among the trees without touching even a twig perhaps while these things are happening you must be snugly tucked in bed but that is no reason why you should not be told what they do while you are dreaming before this you know i have told you more of what is done by daylight in meadow forest farmyard and pond it would be a very queer world if we could not know about things without seeing them for ourselves and you may like to think when you are going to sleep that hundreds and thousands of tiny outofdoor people are turning and stretching and going to find their food in the morning when you are dressing in your sunshiny rooms they are cuddling down for a good days rest i think i ought to tell you that i have not been alone when writing these stories i have often been in the meadow and the forest at night and have seen and heard many interesting things but my good cat silvertip has known far more than i of the nightdoings of the outofdoor people he has been beside me at my desk and although at times he has shut his eyes and taken catnaps while i wrote there have been many other times when he has taken the pen right out of my hand he has even tried running the typewriter with his dainty white paws and he has gone over every story i have written i do not say that he has written any himself but you can see that he has been very careful what i wrote and i have learned a great deal from him that i never knew before he is a very good and clever cat and if you like these stories i am sure it must be partly because he had a paw in the writing of them when the speckled hen wanted to sit there was no use in trying to talk her out of the idea for she was a very set hen so after the farmers wife had worked and worked and barred her out of first one nestingplace and then another she gave up to the speckled hen and fixed her a fine nest and put thirteen eggs into it they were black spanish eggs but the speckled hen did not know that the hens that had laid them could not bear to sit so unless some other hen did the work which they left undone there would have been no black spanish chickens this is always their way and people have grown used to it now nobody thinks of asking a black spanish hen to sit although it does not seem right that a hen should be unwilling to bring up chickens supposing nobody had been willing to bring her up still the black spanish hens talk very reasonably about it we will lay plenty of eggs they say but some of the common hens must hatch them they do their share of the farmyard work only they insist on choosing what that share shall be when the speckled hen came off the nest with eleven black chickens two of the eggs did not hatch she was not altogether happy i wanted them to be speckled said she and not one of the whole brood is that was why she grew so restless and discontented in her coop although it was roomy and clean and she had plenty given her to eat and drink she was quite happy only when they were safely under her wings at night and such a time as they always had getting settled when the sunbeams came more and more slantingly through the trees the chickens felt less and less like running around their tiny legs were tired and they liked to cuddle down on the grass in the shadow of the coop then the speckled hen often clucked to them to come in and rest but they liked it better in the open air the speckled hen would also have liked to be out of the coop yet the farmer kept her in he knew what was best for hens with little chickens and also what was best for the tender young lettuce and radishes in his garden when the sun was nearly down the speckled hen clucked her cometobed cluck which was quite different from her food cluck or her hawk cluck and the little black chickens ran between the bars and crawled under her feathers then the speckled hen began to look fatter and fatter and fatter for each chicken who nestled beneath her sometimes one little fellow would scramble up on to her back and stand there while she turned her head from side to side looking at him with first one and then the other of her round yellow eyes and scolding him all the time it never did any good to scold but she said she had to do something and with ten other children under her wings it would never do for her to stand up and tumble him off all the time that they were getting settled for the night the chickens were talking in sleepy little cheeps and now and then one of them would poke his head out between the feathers and tell the speckled hen that somebody was pushing him then she would be more puzzled than ever and cluck louder still sometimes too the chickens would run out for another mouthful of cornmeal mush or a few more drops of water there was one little fellow who always wanted something to drink just when he should have been going to sleep the speckled hen used to say that it took longer for a mouthful of water to run down his throat than it would for her to drink the whole panful of course it did take quite a while because he couldnt hurry it by swallowing he had to drink as all birds do by filling his beak with water and then holding it up until the last drop had trickled down into his stomach when the whole eleven were at last safely tucked away for the night the speckled hen was tired but happy they are good children she often said to herself if they are black spanish they might be just as mischievous if they were speckled still i do wish that those stylishlooking whiteeared black spanish hens would raise their own broods i dont like to be hatchmother to other hens chickens then she would slide her eyelids over her eyes and doze off and dream that they were all speckled like herself there came a day when the coop was raised and they were free to go where they chose there was a fence around the vegetable garden now and netting around the flowerbeds but there were other lovely places for scratching up food for nipping off tender young green things for picking up the fine gravel which every chicken needs and for wallowing in the dust then the black spanish chickens became acquainted with the other fowls whom they had never met before they were rather afraid of the shanghai cock because he had such a gruff way of speaking and they liked the dorkings yet the ones they watched and admired and talked most about were the black spanish cock and hen there were many fowls on the farm who did not have family names and the speckled hen was one of these they had been there longer than the rest and did not really like having new people come to live in the poultryyard it was trying too when the older hens had to hatch the eggs laid by the newcomers it is said that this was what made the speckled hen leave the eleven little black spanish chickens after she had been out of the coop for a while they had been very mischievous and disobedient one day and she walked off and left them to care for themselves while she started to raise a family of her own in a stolen nest under the strawstack when night came eleven little black spanish chickens did not know what to do they went to look for their old coop but that had been given to another hen and her family they walked around looking very small and lonely and wished they had minded the speckled hen and made her love them more at last they found an old potatocrate which reminded them of a coop and so seemed rather homelike it stood top down upon the ground and they were too big to crawl through its barred sides so they did the best they could and huddled together on top of it if there had not been a stoneheap near they could not have done that for their wingfeathers were not yet large enough to help them flutter the bravest chicken went first picking his way from stone to stone until he reached the highest one balancing himself awhile on that stretching his neck toward the potatocrate looking at it as though he were about to jump and then seeming to change his mind and decide not do so after all the chickens on the ground said he was afraid and he said he wasnt any more afraid than they were then after a while he did jump a queer floppy squawky kind of jump but it landed him where he wanted to be after that it was his turn to laugh at the others while they stood teetering uncertainly on the top stone they were very lonely without the speckled hen and each chicken wanted to be in the middle of the group so that he could have others to keep him warm on all sides somebody laughed at the most mischievous chicken and told him he could stand on the potatocrates back without being scolded and he pouted his bill and said much fun that would be all i cared about standing on the speckled hens back was to make her scold it is very shocking that he should say such things but he did say exactly that they slept safely that night and only awakened when the cocks crowed a little while after midnight after that they slept until sunrise and when the shanghais and dorkings came down from the appletree where they had been roosting the black spanish chickens stirred and cheeped and looked at their feathers to see how much they had grown during the night then they pushed and squabbled for their breakfast
 every night they came back to sleep on the potatocrate at last they were able to spring up into their places without standing on the stonepile and that was a great day they talked about it long after they should have been asleep and were still chattering when the shanghai cock spoke if you black spanish chickens dont keep still and let us sleep said he some owl or weasel will come for you and i shall be glad to have him that scared the chickens and they were very quiet it made the black spanish hen uneasy though and she whispered to the black spanish cock and wouldnt let him sleep until he had promised to fight anybody who might try to carry one of the chickens away from the potatocrate the next night first one chicken and then another kept tumbling off the potatocrate they lost their patience and said such things as these to each other you pushed me you know you did well he pushed me didnt either did too well i couldnt help it if i did the shanghai cock became exceedingly cross because they made so much noise and even the black spanish cock lost his patience you may be my children said he but you do not take your manners from me is there no other place on this farm where you can sleep excepting that old crate we want to sleep here answered the chicken on the ground there is plenty of room if those fellows wouldnt push then he flew up and clung and pushed until some other chicken tumbled off well said the black spanish cock and he would have said much more if the black spanish hen had not fluttered down from the appletree to see what was the matter when he saw the expression of her eyes he decided to go back to his perch there is not room for you all said the black spanish hen one must sleep somewhere else there is room said the chickens contradicting her we have always roosted on here there is not room said the black spanish hen once more how do your feathers grow finely said they and your feet they are getting very big was the answer do you think the speckled hen could cover you all with her wings if she were to try it now the chickens looked at each other and laughed they thought it would take three speckled hens to cover them but she used to said the black spanish hen she did not say anything more she just looked at the potatocrate and at them and at the potatocrate again then she walked off after a while one of the chickens said i guess perhaps there isnt room for us all there the mischievous one said if you little chickens want to roost there you may i am too large for that sort of thing then he walked up the slanting board to the appletree branch and perched there beside the young shanghais you should have seen how beautifully he did it his toes hooked themselves around the branch as though he had always perched there and he tucked his head under his wing with quite an air before long his brothers and sisters came also and heard him saying to one of his new neighbors oh yes i much prefer appletrees but when i was a chicken i used to sleep on a potatocrate just listen to him whispered the black spanish cock and he hasnt a tailfeather worth mentioning never mind answered the black spanish hen let them play that they are grown up if they want to they will be soon enough she sighed as she put her head under her wing and settled down for the night it made her feel old to see her children roosting in a tree it was a bright moonlight night when the oldest wigglers in the rainbarrel made up their mind to leave the water they had always been restless and discontented children but it was not altogether their fault how could one expect any insect with such a name to float quietly when the mosquito mothers laid their long and slender eggs in the rainbarrel they had fastened them together in boatshaped masses and there they had floated until the wigglers were strong enough to break through the lower ends of the eggs into the water it had been only a few days before they were ready to do this then there had been a few more days and nights when the tiny wigglers hung head downward in the water and all one could see by looking across the barrel was the tips of their breathing tubes sometimes if they were frightened a young wiggler would forget and get head uppermost for a minute but he was always ashamed to have this happen and made all sorts of excuses for himself when it did wellbred little wigglers tried to always have their heads down and mosquitoes who stopped to visit with them and give good advice told them such things as these the wiggler who keeps his head up may never have wings and up with your tails and down with your eyes if you would be mannerly healthy and wise when they were very young they kept their heads way down and breathed through a tube that ran out near the tailend of their bodies this tube had a cluster of tiny winglike things on the very tip which kept it floating on the top of the water they had no work to do so they just ate food which they found in the water and wiggled and played tag and whenever they were at all frightened they dived to the bottom and stayed there until they were out of breath that was never very long there were many things to frighten them sometimes a stray horse stopped by the barrel to drink sometimes a robin perched on the edge for a few mouthfuls of water and once in a while a dragonfly came over to visit from the neighboring pond it was not always the biggest visitor who scared them the worst the horses tried not to touch the wigglers while a robin was only too glad if he happened to get one into his bill with the water the dragonflies were the worst for they were the hungriest and they were so much smaller that sometimes the wigglers didnt see them coming sometimes too when they thought that a dragonfly was going the other way some of them stayed near the top of the water only to find when it was too late that a dragonfly can go backward or sidewise without turning around when they were a few days old the wigglers began to change their skins this they did by wiggling out of their old ones and wearing the new ones which had been growing underneath this made them feel exceedingly important and some of them became disgracefully vain one wiggler would not dive until he was sure a certain robin had seen his new suit it was because of that vanity he never lived to be a mosquito after they had changed their skins a few times they had two breathingtubes apiece instead of one and these two grew out near their heads and their heads were much larger at the tailend of his body each wiggler now had two leaflike things with which he swam through the water because they used different breathingtubes those wigglers who had moulted or cast their skins several times now floated in the water with their heads just below the surface and their tails down when a wiggler is old enough for this he is called a pupa or halfgrown one there are often young mosquito children of all ages in the same barreleggs wigglers and pupæ all together there is plenty of room and plenty of food but because they have no work to do there is much time for quarrelling and talking about each other this year the oldest brother had put on so many airs that nobody liked it at all and several of the wigglers had been heard to say that they couldnt bear the sight of him he had such a way of saying when i was a young wiggler and had to keep my head down or repeating up with your tails and down with your eyes if you would be mannerly healthy and wise one little wiggler crossed his feelers at him and they say that it is just as bad to do that as to make faces besides it is so much easierif you have the feelers to cross now the oldest brother and those of his brothers and sisters who had hatched from the same eggmass were talking of leaving the rainbarrel forever it was a bright moonlight night and they longed to get their wings uncovered and dried for then they would be fullgrown mosquitoes resting most of the day and having glorious times at night the oldest brother was jerking himself through the water as fast as he could giving his jointed body sudden bends first this way and then that and when he met anyone nearly his own age he said come with me and cast your skin it is a fine evening for moulting sometimes they answered all right and jerked or wiggled or swam along with him and sometimes a pupa would answer im afraid im not old enough to slip out of my skin easily then the oldest brother would reply dont stop for that youll be older by the time we begin that was true of course and all members of mosquito families grow old very fast so it happened that when the moon peeped over the farmhouse showing her bright face between the two chimneys twentythree pupæ were floating close to each other and making ready to change their skins for the last time it was very exciting all the young wigglers hung around to see what was going on and pushed each other aside to get the best places the oldest brother was much afraid that somebody else would begin to moult before he was ready and all the brothers were telling their sisters to be careful to split their skins in the right place down the back and the sisters were telling them that they knew just as much about moulting as their brothers did every little while the oldest brother would say now wait dont one of you fellows split his old skin until i say so then two or three of his brothers would become impatient because their outer skins were growing tighter every minute and would say why not and would grumble because they had to wait the truth was that the oldest brother could not get his skin to crack although he jerked and wiggled and took very deep breaths and he didnt want any one else to get ahead of him at last it did begin to open and he had just told the others to commence moulting when a mosquito mother stopped to lay a few eggs in the barrel dear me said she you are not
 going to moult tonight are you yes we are answered the oldest brother giving a wiggle that split his skin a little farther well be biting people before morning you said the mosquito mother with a queer little smile i wouldnt count on doing that but you young people may get into trouble if you moult now for it looks like rain she waved her feelers upward as she spoke and they noticed that heavy black clouds were piling up in the sky even as they looked the moon was hidden and the wind began to stir the branches of the trees it will rain she said and then the water will run off the roof into this barrel and if you have just moulted and cannot fly you will be drowned pooh answered the oldest brother guess we can take care of ourselves im not afraid of a little water then he tried to crawl out of his old skin the mosquito mother stayed until she had laid all the eggs she wanted to and then flew away not one of the pupæ had been willing to listen to her although some of the sisters might have done so if their brothers had not made fun of them at last twentythree soft and tired young mosquitoes stood on their castoff pupaskins waiting for their wings to harden it is never easy work to crawl out of ones skin and the last moulting is the hardest of all it was then when they could do nothing but wait that these young mosquitoes began to feel afraid the night was now dark and windy and sometimes a sudden gust blew their floating pupa skins toward one side of the barrel they had to cling tightly to them for they suddenly remembered that if they fell into the water they might drown the oldest one found himself wishing to be a wiggler again wigglers are never drowned thought he who are you going to bite first asked one of his brothers he answered very crossly i dont know and i dont care im not hungry cant you think of anything but eating why what else is there to think about cried all the floating mosquitoes well there is flying said he humph i dont see what use flying would be except to carry us to our food said one mosquito sister she afterward found out that it was good for other reasons after that they didnt try to talk with their oldest brother they talked with each other and tried their legs and wished it were light enough for them to see their wings mosquitoes have such interesting wings you know thin and gauzy and with delicate fringes around the edges and along the line of each vein the sisters too were proud of the pockets under their wings and were in a hurry to have their wings harden so that they could flutter them and hear the beautiful singing sound made by the air striking these pockets they knew that their brothers could never sing and they were glad to think that they were ahead of them for once it was not really their fault that they felt so for the brothers had often put on airs and laughed at them then came a wonderful flash of lightning and a long roll of thunder and the trees tossed their beautiful branches to and fro while big raindrops pattered down on to the roof overhead and spattered and bounded and rolled toward the edge under which the rainbarrel stood fly cried the oldest brother raising his wings as well as he could we cant where to cried the rest fly any way anywhere screamed the oldest brother and in some wonderful way the whole twentythree managed to flutter and crawl and sprawl up the side of the building where the raindrops fell past but did not touch them there they found older mosquitoes waiting for the shower to stop even the oldest brother was so scared that he shook and when he saw that same mosquito mother who had told him to put off changing his skin he got behind two other young mosquitoes and kept very still perhaps she saw him for it was lighter then than it had been she did not seem to see him but he heard her talking to her friends i told him she said that he might better put off moulting but he answered that he could take care of himself and that he would be out biting people before morning did he say that cried the other old mosquitoes he did she replied then they all laughed and laughed and laughed again and the young mosquito found out why it was because mosquito brothers have to eat honey and only the sisters may bite people and suck their blood he had thought so often how he would sing around somebody until he found the nicest juiciest spot and then settle lightly down and bite and suck until his slender little body was fat and round and red with its stomachful of blood and that could never be he could never sing and he would have to sit around with his stomach full of honey and see his eleven sisters gorged with blood and hear them singing sweetly as they flew if mosquito fathers had ever come to the barrel he might have found this out but they never did he sneaked off by himself until he met an early bird and thenwell you know birds must eat something and the mosquito was right there of course after that his brothers and sisters had a chance to do as they wanted to and the eleven sisters bit thirteen people the very next night and had the loveliest kind of mosquito time there was hardly a night of his life when the little brother of the raccoon family was not reproved by his mother for teasing mrs raccoon said she didnt know what she had done to deserve such a child when she spoke like this to her neighbors they sighed and said it must be trying but he may outgrow it the oldest wolverene though told the skunk that his cousin mrs raccoons husband had been just as bad as that when he was young i do not want you to say that i said so he whispered because he might hear of it and be angry but it is true the oldest wolverene didnt say whether mr raccoon outgrew this bad habit yet it would seem that his wife had never noticed it you must not think that mr raccoon was dead oh no indeed every night he was prowling through the forest on tiptoe looking for food but mrs raccoon was a very devoted mother and gave so much time and attention to her children that she was not good company for her husband he did not care much for home life and the children annoyed him exceedingly so he went away and found a hole in another tree which he fitted up for himself there he slept through the day and until the setting of the sun told him that it was time for his breakfast raccoons like company and he often had friends in to sleep with him sometimes these friends were raccoons like himself with wives and children and then they would talk about their families and tell how they thought their wives were spoiling the children the four little raccoons who lived with their mother in the dead branch of the big oaktree had been born in april when the forest was sweet with the scent of wild violets and every one was happy beautiful pink and white trilliums raised their threecornered flowers above their threefold leaves and nodded with every passing breeze yellow adderstongue was there with cranesbill geraniums squirrelcorn and spring beauties besides hepaticas and windflowers and the dainty bishopscap the young raccoons did not see these things for their eyes would not work well by daylight and when after dark their mother let them put their heads out of the hole and look around they were too far from the ground to see the flowers sleeping in the dusk below they could only sniff sniff sniff with their sharp little turnedup noses and wonder what flowers look like any way when their mother was with them for a time and that was while they were drinking the warm milk that she always carried for them she told them stories of the flowers and trees she had begun by telling them animal stories but she found that it made them cowardly just supposing one young raccoon had said a great big dreadful snail should come up this tree and eat us all the mother told them that snails were small and slow and weak and never climbed trees or ate people but it did no good and her children were always afraid of snails until they had seen one for themselves after that she told them stories of the flowers and when they asked if the flowers would ever come to see them she said no indeed you will never see them until you can climb down the tree and walk among them for they grow with their feet in the ground and never go anywhere there were many stories which they wanted over and over again but the one they liked best of all was that about the wicked wicked poison ivy and the gentle spotted touchmenot who grew near him and undid all the trouble that the ivy made when the night came for the young raccoons to climb down from their tree and learn to hunt all the early spring blossoms were gone and only the ripening seedvessels showed where nodding flowers had been you would have expected the raccoon children to be disappointed yet there were so many other things to see and learn about that it was not until three nights later that they thought much of the flowers they might not have done so then if little sister had not lost her hold upon the oaktree bark and fallen with her forepaws on a scarlet jackinthepulpit berry they had to learn to climb quickly and strongly up all sorts of trees perhaps mrs raccoon had chosen an oak for her nest because that was rough and easily climbed there were many good places for raccoons to grip with their twenty strong claws apiece after they had learned oaks they took maples ironwoods and beecheseach a harder lesson than the one before when you climb a tree said their mother always look over the trunk and the largest branches for hidingplaces whether you want to use one then or not why asked three of the four children big brother who was rather vain was looking at the five beautiful black rings and the beautiful black tip of his wonderful bushy tail between the black rings were whitish ones and he thought such things much more interesting than holes in trees because said the mother raccoon you may be far
 from home some night and want a safe place to sleep in all day or if a man and his dogs are chasing you you must climb into the first hidingplace you can we raccoons are too fat and slow to run away from them and the rings on our tails and the black patches on our broad faces might show from the ground if the hole is a small one make it cover your head and your tail anyway and as much of your brown body fur as you can mother raccoon looked sternly at big brother because he had not been listening and he gave a slight jump and asked wwhat did you say what did i say she replied you should have paid better attention yes m said big brother who was now very meek i shall not repeat it said his mother but i will tell you not to grow vain of your fur it is very handsome and so is that of your sisters and your brother so is mine and so was your fathers the last time i saw him yet nearly all the trouble that raccoons have is on account of their fur never try to show it off the time came for the young raccoons to stop drinking milk from their mothers body and when they tried to do so she only walked away from them i cannot work so hard to care for you said she i am so tired and thin now that my skin is loose and you must find your own food you are getting forty fine teeth apiece and i never saw a better lot of claws on any raccoon family if i do say it they used to go hunting together for it is the custom for raccoons to go in parties of from five to eight hunt all night and then hide somewhere until the next night they did not always come home at sunrise and it made a pleasant change to sleep in different trees one day they all cuddled down in the hollow of an old maple just below where the branches come out mother raccoon had climbed the tree first and was curled away in the very bottom of the hole the four children were not tired and hadnt wanted to go to bed at all little sister had made a dreadful face when her mother called her up the tree and if it had not already been growing light mrs raccoon would probably have seen it and punished her big sister curled down beside her mother and little sister was rather above them and beside mischievous little brother last of all came big brother who had stopped to scratch his ear with his hind foot he was very proud of his little round ears and often scratched them in this way to make sure that the fur lay straight on them he was so slow in reaching the hole that before he got into it a robin had begun his morning song of cheerily cheerily cheerup and a chipmunk perched on a stump to make his morning toilet he got all settled and little brother was half asleep beside him when he remembered his tail and sat up to have one more look at it little brother growled sleepily and told him to let his old tail alone and come to bed as long as they couldnt hunt any more but big brother thought he saw a sandburr on his tail and wanted to pull it out before it hurt the fur then he began to look at the bare tough pads on his feet and to notice how finely he could spread his toes those of his front feet he could spread especially wide he balanced himself on the edge of the hole and held them spread out before him it was still dark enough for him to see well come here little brother he cried wake up and see how big my feet are getting mother raccoon growled at them to be good children and go to sleep but her voice sounded dreamy and far away because she had to talk through part of her own fur and most of her daughters little brother lost his patience unrolled himself with a spring jumped to the opening and knocked his brother down it was dreadful of course big brother was not much hurt for he was very fat and his fur was both long and thick but he turned over and over on his way to the ground before he alighted on his feet he turned so fast and little brothers eyes hurt him so that it looked as though big brother had about three heads three tails and twelve feet he called out as he fell and that awakened the sisters who began to cry and mother raccoon who was so scared that she began to scold such a time mother raccoon found out what had happened and then she said to little brother did you mean to push him down no maam answered little brother hanging his head anyhow i didnt mean to after i saw him going perhaps i did mean to before that you see he was a truthful raccoon even when he was most naughty and there is always hope for a raccoon who will tell the truth no matter how hard it is to do so big brother climbed slowly up the trunk of the oaktree while more and more of the daytime people came to look at him he could not see well now and so was very awkward when he reached the hole he was hot and cross and complained to his mother make him quit teasing me he said pointing one forepaw at little brother i will answered mother raccoon but you were just as much to blame as he for if you had cuddled down quietly when i told you to you would have been dreaming long ago now you must sleep where i was at the lower end of the hole little brother must go next and i do not want to hear one word from either of you sisters next and i will sleep by the opening you children must remember that it is no time for talking to each other or looking at claws or getting sandburrs out of your tails after you have been sent to bed go to sleep and dont awaken until the sun has gone down and you are ready to be my good little raccoons again her children were asleep long before she was and she talked softly to herself after they were dreaming they do not mean to be naughty she said yet it makes my fur stand on end to think what might have happened i ought not to have curled up for the day until they had done so mothers should always be at the top of the heap then she fixed herself for a long restful days sleep it was not often that the little ground hogs were left alone in the daytime before they were born their mother had been heard to say that she had her opinion of any ground hog who would be seen out after sunrise mr ground hog felt in the same way and said if he ever got to running around by daylight like some of his relatives people might call him a woodchuck he thought that any one who ate twigs beets turnips young treebark and other green things from sunset to sunrise ought to be able to get along until the next sunset without a lunch he said that any ground hog who wanted more was a pig after the baby ground hogs were born matters were different they could not go out at night to feed for themselves and their stomachs were so tiny and held so little at a time that they had to be filled very often mr ground hog was never at home now and the care all fell upon his hardworking wife you know my dear he had said that i should only be in the way if i were to stay at home for i am not clever and patient with children as you are no i think i will go away and see to some matters which i have rather neglected of late when the children are grown up and you have more time to give me i will come back to you then mr ground hog trotted away to join a party of his friends who had just told their wives something of the same sort and they all went together to the farmers turnip patch and had a delightful time until morning mrs ground hog looked after him as he trotted away and wished that she could go too he looked so handsome with the moonlight shining down on his long thick reddish fur and showing the black streak on his back where the fur was tipped with gray he was fat and shaky with a baggy skin and when he stopped to sit up on his haunches and wave his paws at her and comb his facefur she thought him just as handsome as he had been in the early spring when they first met that had been in a parsnip patch where there was good feeding until the farmer found that the ground hogs were there and dug the rest of his vegetables and stored them in his cellar such midnight meals as they had eaten there together mrs ground hog said she never saw a parsnip afterward without thinking of their courtship she had been as handsome as he and there were many other ground hogs who admired her but now she was thin and did not have many chances to comb her fur with her fore paws she could not go with him to the turnip patch because she did not wish to go so far from her babies thinking of that reminded her to go into her sidehill burrow and see what they were doing then she lay down and let them draw the warm milk from her body while they were feeding she felt of them and thought how fast they were growing it would be only a short time before they could trot around the fields by themselves and whistle shrilly as they dodged down into their own burrows ah said she this is better than turnip patches or even parsnips when they had finished their mother left them and went out to feed she had always been a hearty eater but now she had to eat enough more to make the milk for her babies she often thought that if ground hog babies could eat anything else their father might have learned to help feed them she thought of this especially when she saw the great horned owl carrying food home to his son and daughter it is what comes of being fourlegged said she and i wouldnt be an owl for anything so i wont grumble after this she was more cheerful when she left the burrow she always said i am going out to feed and i shall not be gone very long dont be afraid for you have a good burrow and it is nice and dark outside the children would cry and you will surely come home before sunrise surely she always answered as she trotted away then the children would rest happily in their burrownest but now mrs ground hog was hungry and it was broad daylight she knew that it was because her children grew bigger every day and had to have more and more milk this meant that she must eat more or else when they wanted milk there would not be enough ready she knew that she must begin
 to feed by day as well as by night and she was glad that she could see fairly well if the sun were not shining into her eyes children said she to them just as they finished their morning lunch i am very hungry and i am going out to feed you will be quite safe here and i want you to be good while i am gone the young ground hogs began to cry and clutch at her fur with their weak little paws oh dont go they said please dont go we dont want to stay alone in the daytime were afraid i must said she or i shall have no milk for you and then you wouldnt have me lie here all day too hungry to sleep would you nno said they but youll come back soon wont you yes said she and she shook off their clinging paws and poked back the daughter who caught on again and trotted away as fast as she could it was the first time that she had been out by daylight and everything looked queer the colors looked too bright and there seemed to be more noise than usual and she met several people whom she had never seen before she stopped for a minute to look at an ovenbirds nest the motherbird was inside sitting there very still and brave although she was much frightened goodmorning said mrs ground hog i was just admiring your nest i have never seen it by daylight goodmorning answered the ovenbird im glad you fancy my nest but i hope you dont like to eat meat meat answered mrs ground hog i never touch it and she smiled and showed all her teeth oh exclaimed the ovenbird i see you dont for you have gnawingteeth rather like those of the rabbits then she hopped out of the nest and let mrs ground hog peep in to see how the inside was finished and also to see the four speckled eggs which lay there it is a lovely nest said mrs ground hog and those eggs are beauties but i promised the children that i would hurry goodby she trotted happily away while mrs ovenbird settled herself upon her eggs again and thought what a pleasant call she had had and what an excellent and intelligent person mrs ground hog was all this time the children at home were talking together about themselves and what their mother had told them once there was a long pause which lasted until the brother said im not afraid are you of course not said they because there isnt anything to be afraid of said he not anything said they and i wouldnt be afraid anyway said he neither would we answered the sisters there was another long pause she said wed be just as safe as if it were dark said the big sister of course said the brother and she said shed come back as soon as she could said the second sister i wish shed come now said the smallest sister there was another long pause you dont suppose anybody would come here just to scare us do you asked the second sister see here said the brother i wish youd quit saying things to make a fellow afraid you dont mean that you are frightened exclaimed the three sisters together and the smallest one added why you are too i can feel you tremble well i dont care said the brother im not afraid of people anyhow if it were only dark i wouldnt mind oh are you afraid of the daylight too cried each of the sisters so am i then they all trembled together i tell you what lets do said the smallest sister lets all stop looking toward the light end of the burrow and cuddle up together and cover our eyes and make believe its night they did this and felt better they even played that they heard the few noises of the nighttime a crow cawed outside and the brother said did you hear that owl that was the great horned owl the one who had to hatch the eggs you know when another crow cawed the smallest sister said was that his cousin the screech owl yes answered the big sister he is the one who used to bring things for the great horned owl to eat so they amused themselves and each other and really got along very well except when once in a while they opened their eyes a little crack to see if it were not getting really dark then they had to begin all over again at last their mother came and what a comfort it was how glad she was to be back and how much she had to tell them all about the ovenbirds nest and the four eggs in it and how the ovenbirds spent their nights in sleeping and their days in work and play i wonder if the little ovenbirds will be scared when they have to stay alone in the daytime said the smallest sister they would be more scared if they had to stay alone at night said their mother at night exclaimed all the young ground hogs why it is dark then they might be afraid of the darkness said their mother then the children laughed and thought she was making fun of them they drank some milk and went to sleep like good little ground hogs but even after he was half asleep the big brother laughed out loud at the thought of the ovenbird babies being scared at night he could understand any ones being afraid of daylight but darkness it was not very many nights after big brother had tumbled from the mapletree when he and the other children were invited to a raccoon party down by the pond the water was low and in the small pools by the shore there were many freshwater clams and small fishes such as raccoons like best of all a family of six young raccoons who lived very near the pond had found them just before sunrise when they had to climb off to bed they knew there was much more food there than they could eat alone so their mother had let them invite their four friends who lived in the hollow of the oaktree the party was to begin the next evening at moonrise and the four children who lived in the oaktree got their invitation just as they were going to sleep for the day they were very much excited over it for they had never been to a party i wish we could go now said big brother yes lots of fun it would be now answered little brother the sun is almost up and there are no clouds in the sky we couldnt see a thing unless we shaded our eyes with our fore paws and if we had to use our fore paws in that way we couldnt eat you do eat at parties dont you asked little sister who had not quite understood what was said of course shouted her brothers that is what parties are for i thought maybe you talked some said big sister i suppose you do have to some said big brother but i know you eat ive heard people tell about parties lots of times and they always began by telling what they ate thats what makes it a party oh i wish it were night and time to go sighed little brother i dont said little sister i wouldnt have any fun if i were to go now id rather wait until my stomach is empty there said their mother you children have talked long enough now curl down and go to sleep the birds are already singing their morning songs and the owls and bats were dreaming long ago it will make nighttime come much sooner if you do not stay awake were not a bit sleepy cried all the young raccoons together that makes no difference at all said their mother and she spoke quite sternly cuddle down for the day now cover your eyes and stop talking i do not say you must sleep but you must stop talking they knew that when she spoke in that way and said must there was nothing to do but to mind so they cuddled down and every one of them was asleep before you could drop an acorn mother raccoon had known it would be so when they awakened early the next night each young raccoon had to make himself look as neat as possible there were long fur to be combed faces and paws to be washed and twentythree burrs to be taken out of little brothers tail he began to take them out himself but his mother found that whenever he got one loose he stuck it onto one of the other children so she scolded him and made him sit on a branch by himself while she worked at the burrs sometimes she couldnt help pulling the fur and then he tried to wriggle away youve got enough out he cried let the rest go you should have thought sooner how it would hurt she said you have been told again and again to keep away from the burrs and you are just as careless as you were the first night you left the tree then she took out another burr and dropped it to the ground ouch said he let me go not until i am done she answered no child of mine shall ever go to a party looking as you do after that little brother tried to hold still and he had time to think how glad he was that he hadnt stuck any more burrs on the other children if he had gotten more onto them he would have had to wait while they were pulled off again and then they might have been late for the party if he had been very good he would have been glad they didnt have to be hurt as he was but he was not very good and he never thought of that when he was ready at last mother raccoon made her four children sit in a row while she talked to them remember to walk on your toes said she although you may stand flatfooted if you wish dont act greedy if you can help it go into the water as much as you choose but dont try to dive even if they dare you to raccoons can never learn to dive no matter how well they swim and be sure to wash your food before you eat it all the young raccoons said yesm and thought they would remember every word the first moonbeam shone on the top of the oaktree and mrs raccoon said now you may go be good children and remember what i told you dont stay too long start home when you see the first light in the east yesm said the young raccoons as they walked off very properly toward the pond after they were well away from the oaktree they heard their mother calling to them remember to walk on your toes raccoons cannot go very fast and the moon was shining brightly when they reached the pond and met their six friends such frolics as they had in the shallow water swimming twisting turning scooping up food with their busy fore paws going up and down the beach and rolling on the sand they never once remembered what their mother had told them and they acted exactly as they had been in the habit of doing
 every day big brother looked admiringly at his own tail every chance he got although he had been told particularly not to act as if he thought himself finelooking little brother rolled into a lot of sandburrs and got his fur so matted that he looked worse than ever big sister snatched food from other raccoons and not one of them remembered about walking on tiptoe little sister ate half the time without washing her food of course that didnt matter when the food was taken from the pond but when they found some on the beach and ate it without washingthat was dreadful no raccoon who is anybody at all will do that the mother of the family of six looked on from a tree near by the children did not know that she was there what manners said she i shall never have them invited here again just then she saw one of her own sons eat without washing his food and she groaned out loud my children are forgetting too she said i have told him hundreds of times that if he did that way every day he would do so at a party but he has always said he would remember the mother of the four young raccoons was out hunting and found herself near the pond how noisy those children are she said to herself night people should be quiet she tiptoed along to a pile of rocks and peeped between them to see what was going on she saw her childrens footprints on the sand aha said she so they did walk flatfooted after all she heard somebody scrambling down a tree near by goodevening said a pleasant raccoon voice near her it was the mother of the six are you watching the childrens party asked the newcomer i hope you did not notice how badly my son is behaving i have tried to teach my children good manners but they will be careless when i am not looking and then of course they forget in company that made the mother of the four feel more comfortable i know just how that is said she mine mean to be good but they are so careless it is very discouraging the two mothers talked for a long time in whispers and then each went to her hole when the four young raccoons came home it was beginning to grow light and they kept close together because they were somewhat afraid their mother was waiting to see them settled for the day she asked if they had a good time and said she was glad they got home promptly they had been afraid she would ask if they had washed their food and walked on their toes she even seemed not to notice little brothers matted coat when they awakened the next night the mother hurried them off with her to the same pond where they had been to the party i am going to visit with the mother of your friends said she and you may play around and amuse yourselves the young raccoons had another fine time although little brother found it very uncomfortable to wear so many burrs they played tag in the trees and ate and swam and lay on the beach while they were lying there the four from the oaktree noticed that their mother was walking flatfooted there was bright moonlight and anybody might see her they felt dreadfully about it then they saw her begin to eat food which she had not washed they were so ashamed that they didnt want to look their friends in the eye they didnt know that their friends were feeling in the same way because they had seen their mother doing illmannered things after they reached home big brother said very timidly to his mother did you know you ate some food without washing it oh yes she answered it is such a bother to dip it all in water and you walked flatfooted said little brother well why shouldnt i if i want to said she the children began to cry ppeople will think you dont know any bbetter said they we were ddreadfully ashamed oh said their mother oh oh so you think that my manners are not so good as yours is that it the young raccoons looked at each other in a very uncomfortable way we suppose we dont always do things right ourselves they answered but you are grown up yes replied their mother and you will be for a long time nobody spoke and little sister sobbed out loud then mrs raccoon spoke more gently the sun is rising said she we will go to sleep now and when we awaken tomorrow night we will try to have better manners so that we need not be ashamed of each other at parties or at home long after the rest were dreaming big sister nudged big brother and awakened him i understand it now she said she did it on purpose who did what asked he why our mother she was rude on purpose to let us see how it looked big brother thought for a minute of course said he of course she did well she wont ever have to do it again for me nor for me said big sister then they went to sleep the skunks did not go into society at all they were very unpopular and so many people feared or disliked them that nobody would invite them to a party indeed if they had been invited to a party and had gone the other guests would have left at once the small people of the forest feared them because they were meateaters and the larger ones disliked them because of their disagreeable habits the skunks were handsome and quiet but they were quicktempered and as soon as one of them became angry he threw a horrible smelling liquid on the people who displeased him it was not only horrible smelling but it made those who had to smell it steadily quite sick and would indeed have killed them if they had not kept in the fresh air if a drop of this liquid got on to a person even his wife and children had to keep away from him for a long time and the skunks were so unreasonable they would not stop to see what was the real trouble but if anybody ran into them by mistake in the darkness they would just as likely as not throw the liquid at once among themselves they seemed to be quite happy there were from six to ten children born at a time in each family these children lived in the burrow with their father and mother until the next spring sleeping steadily through the coldest weather of winter and only awakening when it was warm enough for them to enjoy life when spring came the children found themselves grownup and went off to live their own lives in new holes while their mothers took care of the six or seven or eight or nine or ten new babies there was one very interesting skunk family in the forest with the father mother and eight children living in one hole no two of them were marked in exactly the same way although all were stoutly built had small heads little round ears and beautiful long tails covered with soft drooping hair their fur was rather long and handsome and they were dark brown or black nearly all over most of them had a streak of white on the forehead a spot of it on the neck some on the tail and a couple of stripes of it on their backs one could see them quite easily by starlight on account of the white fur the skunks were really very proud of their white stripes and spots it is not so much having the white fur mrs skunk had been heard to say as it is having it where all can see it most animals wear the dark fur on their backs and the light on their bellies and that is to make them safer from enemies but we dare to wear ours in plain sight we are never afraid and what she said was true although it hardly seemed modest for her to talk about it in that way it would have been more polite to let other people tell how brave her family were perhaps however if somebody else had been telling it he would have said that part of their courage was rudeness father skunk always talked to his children as his father had talked to him and probably as his grandfather had also talked when he was raising a family never turn out of your way for anybody said he let the other fellow step aside remember that no matter whom you meet and no matter how large the other people may be if they see you they will get out of your path and if they cant it is not your fault dont speak to them and dont hurry always take your time father skunk was slow and stately it was a sight worth seeing when he started off for a nights ramble walking with a slow and measured gait and carrying his fine tail high over his back he always went by himself one is company two is a crowd he would say as he walked away when they were old enough the young skunks began to walk off alone as soon as it was dark mother skunk also went alone and perhaps she had the best time of all for it was a great rest not to have eight babies tumbling over her back and getting under her feet and hanging on to her with their thirtytwo paws and sometimes even scratching her with their one hundred and sixty claws they still slept through the days in the old hole so they were together much of the time but they did not hunt in parties as raccoons and weasels do one of the brothers had no white whatever on his tail so they called him the blacktailed skunk he had heard in some way that there was an ovenbirds nest on the ground by the fern bank and he made up his mind to find it the very next night and eat the eggs which were inside another brother was called the spotted skunk because the spot on his neck was so large he had found the ovenbirds nest himself while on his way home in the early morning he would have liked to rob it then but he had eaten so much that night that he thought it better to wait so it happened that when the family awakened the next night two of the children had important plans of their own neither of them would have told for anything but they couldnt quite keep from hinting about it as they made themselves ready to go out aha said the blacktailed skunk i know something you dont know oh tell us cried four or five of the other children while the spotted skunk twisted his head and said you dont either i do too replied the blacktailed skunk children children exclaimed mrs skunk while their father said that he couldnt see where his children got their quarrelsome disposition for none of his people had ever contradicted or disputed his wife
 told him that she really thought them very good and that she was sure they behaved much better than most skunks of their age then their father walked off in his most stately manner putting his feet down almost flat and carrying his tail a little higher than usual i do know something that you dont repeated the blacktailed skunk and its something nice too aw said the spotted skunk i dont believe it and i dont care anyhow i know you dont know and i know youd want to know if you knew what i know said the blacktailed skunk who was now getting so excited that he could hardly talk straight children exclaimed their mother not another word about that i do wish you would wake up goodnatured he started it said the spotted skunk and were not quarrelling anyhow but i guess hed give a good deal to know where im going children repeated their mother go at once i will not have you talking in this way before your brothers and sisters do not stop to talk but go so the two brothers started out for the night and each thought he would go a roundabout way to fool the other the blacktailed skunk went to the right and the spotted skunk went to the left but each of them you know really started to rob the ovenbirds nest it was a very dark night even the stars were all hidden behind thick clouds and one could hardly see ones forepaws while walking but of course the nightprowlers of the forest are used to this and fourfooted people are not so likely to stumble and fall as twofooted ones besides young skunks have to remember where logs and stumps of trees are just as other people have to remember their lessons so it happened that while mrs ovenbird was sleeping happily with her four eggs safe and warm under her breast two people were coming from different ways to rob her such a snug nest as it was she had chosen a tiny hollow in the fern bank and had cunningly woven dry grasses and leaves into a ballshaped nest which fitted neatly into the hollow and had a doorway on one side the blacktailed skunk sneaked up to the nest from one side the spotted skunk sneaked up from the other side once the blacktailed skunk thought he heard some other creature moving toward him at the same minute the spotted skunk thought he heard somebody so he stopped to listen neither heard anything mrs ovenbird was sure that she heard a leaf rustle outside and it made her anxious until she remembered that a dead twig might have dropped from the beechtree overhead and hit the dry leaves below slowly the two brothers crept toward the nest and each other they moved very quietly because each wanted to catch the motherbird if he could close to the nest hollow they crouched and sprang with jaws open and sharp teeth ready to bite there was a sudden crashing of leaves and ferns the two brothers had sprung squarely at each other each was bitten growled and ran away and how they did run it is not often you know that skunks go faster than a walk but when they are really scared they move very very swiftly mrs ovenbird felt her nest roof crush down upon her for a minute as two people rolled and growled outside then she heard them running away in different directions and knew that she was safe for a time at least in the morning she repaired her nest and told her bird friends about it they advised her to take her children away as soon as possible after they were hatched if the skunks have found your nest they said you may have another call from them when the blacktailed skunk came stealing home in the first faint light just before sunrise he found the spotted skunk telling the rest of the family how some horrible great fierce beast had pounced upon him in the darkness and bitten him on the shoulder it was so dark said he that i couldnt see him at all but i am sure it must have been a bear they turned to tell the blacktailed skunk about his brothers misfortune and saw that he limped badly did the bear catch you too they cried yes answered he it must have been a bear it was so big and strong and fierce but i bit him too i wouldnt have run away from him only he was so much bigger than i that was just the way with me said the spotted skunk i wouldnt have run if he hadnt been so big you should have thrown liquid on him said their father then he would have been the one to run the brothers hung their heads we never thought they cried we think it must have been because we were so surprised and didnt see him coming well said their father sternly i suppose one must be patient with children but such unskunklike behavior makes me very much ashamed of you both then the two bitten brothers went to bed in disgrace although their mother was sorry for them and loved them as mothers will do even when their children are naughty or cowardly one night some time later these two brothers happened to meet down by the fern bank it was bright moonlight and they stopped to visit for both were feeling very goodnatured the blacktailed skunk said come with me and ill show you where there is an ovenbirds nest all right answered the spotted skunk and then ill show you one ive just been waiting for a bright night said the blacktailed skunk because i came here once in the dark and had bad luck it was near here said the spotted skunk that i was bitten by the bear they stopped beside a tiny hollow there is the nest said the blacktailed skunk pointing with one of his long forefeet why that is the one i meant exclaimed the spotted skunk i found it first said the blacktailed skunk and id have eaten the eggs before if that bear hadnt bitten me just at that minute the two skunks had a new idea we do believe cried they that we bit each other we certainly did said the spotted skunk but well never tell said the blacktailed skunk now they added together lets eat everything but they didnt in fact they didnt eat anything for the eggs were hatched and the young birds had left the nest only the day before now that spring had come and all the green things were growing the cutworms crawled out of their winter sleepingplaces in the ground and began to eat the tenderest and best things that they could find they felt rested and hungry after their quiet winter for they had slept without awakening ever since the first really cold days of fall there were many different kinds of cutworms brothers and sisters cousins and second cousins so of course they did not all look alike they had hatched the summer before from eggs laid by the owlet moths their mothers and had spent the time from then until cold weather in eating and sleeping and eating some more of course they grew a great deal but then you know one can grow without taking time especially for it it is well that this is so if people had to say i can do nothing else now i must sit down and grow awhile there would not be so many large people in the world as there are they would become so interested in doing other things that they would not take the time to grow as they should now the cutworms were fine and fat and just as heedless as cutworms have been since the world began they had never seen their parents and had hatched without any one to look after them they did not look like their parents for they were only worms as yet but they had the same habit of sleeping all day and going out at night and never thought of eating breakfast until the sun had gone down they were quite popular in underground society and were much liked by the earthworms and may beetle larvæ who enjoyed hearing stories of what the cutworms saw above ground the may beetle larvæ did not go out at all because they were too young and the earthworms never knew what was going on outside unless somebody told them they often put their heads up into the air but they had no eyes and could not see for themselves the cutworms were bold saucy selfish and wasteful they were not good children although when they tried they could be very entertaining and one always hoped that they would improve before they became moths sometimes they even told the earthworms and may beetle larvæ stories that were not so and that shows what sort of children they were it was dreadful to tell such things to people who could never find out the difference one spotted cutworm heard a couple of earthworms talking about ground moles and told them that ground moles were large birds with four wings apiece and legs like a caterpillars they did not take pains to be entertaining because they wanted to make the underground people happy but because they enjoyed hearing them say what bright fellows those cutworms are really exceedingly clever and doing it for that reason took all the goodness out of it one bright moonlight night the cutworms awakened and crawled out on top of the ground to feed they lived in the farmers vegetable garden so there were many things to choose from young beets just showing their redveined leaves above their shining red stems turnips cleanlooking onions holding their slender leaves very stiff and straight radishes with just a bit of their rosy roots peeping out of the earth and crisp pale green lettuce crinkled and shaking in every passing breeze it was a lovely growing time and all the vegetables were making the most of the fine nights for you know that is the time when everything grows best sunshiny days are the best for coloring leaves and blossoms but the time for sinking roots deeper and sending shoots higher and unfolding new leaves is at night in the beautiful stillness some cutworms chose beets and some chose radishes two or three liked lettuce best and a couple crawled off to nibble at the sweet peas which the farmers wife had planted they never ate all of a plant ah no and that was one way in which they were wasteful they nibbled through the stalk where it came out of the ground and then the plant tumbled down and withered while the cutworm went on to treat another in the same way well exclaimed one spotted cutworm as he crawled
 out from his hole i must have overslept guess i stayed up too late this morning youd better look out said one of his friends or the ground mole will get you he likes to find nice fat little cutworms who sleep too late in the evening neednt tell me answered the spotted cutworm its the early mole that catches the cutworm i dont know when i have overslept myself so have you fellows been up ever since sunset yes they answered and one saucy fellow added i got up too early i awakened and felt hungry and thought id just come out for a lunch i supposed the birds had finished their supper but the first thing i saw was a robin out hunting she was not more than the length of a beanpole from me and when i saw her cock her head on one side and look toward me i was sure she saw me but she didnt after all lucky for me that i am green and came up beside the lettuce i kept still and she took me for a leaf st said somebody else there comes the ground mole they all kept still while the mole scampered to and fro on the dewy grass near them going faster than one would think he could with such very very short legs his pink digging hands flashed in the moonlight and his pink snout showed also but the dark soft fur of the rest of his body could hardly be seen against the brown earth of the garden it may have been because he was not hungry or it may have been because his fur covered over his eyes so but he went back to his underground runway without having caught a single cutworm then the cutworms felt very much set up they crawled toward the hole into his runway and made faces at it as though he were standing in the doorway they called mean things after him and pretended to say them very loudly yet really spoke quite softly then they began to boast that they were not afraid of anybody and while they were boasting they ate and ate and ate and ate here and there the young plants drooped and fell over and as soon as one did that the cutworm who had eaten on it crawled off to another guess the farmer will know that weve been here said they we dont care he doesnt need all these vegetables what if he did plant them let him plant some more if he wants to what business has he to have so many anyhow if he wont share with other people you would have thought to hear them that they were exceedingly kind to leave any vegetables for the farmer in among the sweet peas were many little tufts of purslane and purslane is very good to eat as anybody knows who has tried it but do you think the cutworms ate that not a bit of it we can have purslane any day they said and now we will eat sweet peas one little fellow added you wont catch me eating purslane its a weed now cutworms do eat weeds but they always seem to like best those things which have been carefully planted and tended if the purslane had been set in straight rows and the sweet peas had just come up of themselves everywhere it is quite likely that this young cutworm would have said you wont catch me eating sweet peas they are weeds as the moon rose higher and higher in the sky the cutworms boasted more and more they said there were no robins clever enough to find them and that the ground mole dared not touch them when they were together and that it was only when he found one alone underground that he was brave enough to do so they talked very loudly now and bragged dreadfully until they noticed that the moon was setting and a faint yellow light showed over the treetops in the east time to go to bed for the day called the spotted cutworm where are you going to crawl in they had no regular homes you know but crawled into the earth wherever they wanted to and slept until the next night here are some fine holes already made said a green cutworm and big enough for a garter snake they are smooth and deep and a lot of us can cuddle down into each im going into one of them who made those holes asked the spotted cutworm and why are they here oh who cares who made them answered the green cutworm guess theyre ours if we want to use them perhaps the farmer made them said the spotted cutworm and if he did i dont want to go into them oh whos afraid of him cried the other cutworms come along no answered the spotted cutworm i wont i dont want to and i wont do it the hole i make to sleep in will not be so large nor will it have such smooth sides but ill know all about it and feel safe goodmorning then he crawled into the earth and went to sleep the others went into the smooth deep holes made by the farmer with his hoe handle the next night there was only one cutworm in the garden and that was the spotted cutworm nobody has ever seen the lazy ones who chose to use the smooth deep holes which were ready made the spotted cutworm lived quite alone until he was fullgrown then he made a little oval room for himself in the ground and slept in it while he changed into a black owlet moth after that he flew away to find a wife and live among her people it is said that whenever he saw a cutworm working at night he would flutter down beside him and whisperthe cutworm who is too lazy to bore his own sleepingplace will never live to become an owlet moth from the time when she was a tiny goldengreen caterpillar miss polyphemus had wanted to go into society she began life on a maple leaf with a few brothers and sisters who hatched at the same time from a cluster of flattened eggs which their mother had laid there ten days before the first thing she remembered was the light and color and sound when she broke the shell open that may morning the first thing she did was to eat the shell out of which she had just crawled then she got acquainted with her brothers and sisters many of whom had also eaten their eggshells although two had begun at once on maple leaves it was well that she took time for this now for the family were soon scattered and several of her sisters she never saw again she found it a very lovely world to live in there was so much to eat yes and there were so many kinds of leaves that she likedoak hickory apple maple elm and several others sometimes she wished that she had three mouths instead of one in those days she had few visitors it is true that other caterpillars happened along once in a while but they were almost as hungry as she and they couldnt speak without stopping eating they could of course if they talked with their mouths full but she had too good manners for that and besides she said that if she did she couldnt enjoy her food so much you must not think that it was wrong in her to care so much about eating she was only doing what is expected of a polyphemus caterpillar and you would have to do the same if you were a polyphemus caterpillar when she was ten days old she had to weigh ten times as much as she did the morning that she was hatched when she was twenty days old she had to weigh sixty times as much when she was a month old she had to weigh six hundred and twenty times as much and when she was fifty days old she had to weigh four thousand times as much as she did at hatching every bit of this flesh was made of the food she ate that is why eating was so important you know and if she had chosen to eat the wrong kind of leaves just because they tasted good she would never have become such a fine great caterpillar as she did she might better not eat anything than to eat the wrong sort and she knew it still she often wished that she had more time for visiting and thought that she would be very gay next year when she got her wings ill make up for it then she said to herself when my growing is done and i have time for play then she ate some more good plain food for she knew that there would be no happy mothtimes for caterpillars who did not eat as they should she had five vacations of about a day each when she ate nothing at all these were the times when she changed her skin crawling out of the tight old one and appearing as fresh and clean as possible in the new one which was ready underneath after her last change she was ready to plan her cocoon and she was a most beautiful caterpillar she was about as long as a small cherry leaf and as plump as a caterpillar can be she was light green with seven slanting yellow lines on each side of her body and a purplishbrown vshaped mark on the back part of each side there were many little orangecolored bunches on her body which showed beautiful gleaming lights when she moved growing out of these bunches were tiny tufts of bristles she had three pairs of real legs and several pairs of makebelieve ones her real legs were on the front part of her body and were slender these she expected to keep always the makebelieve ones were called prolegs they grew farther back and were fat awkward jointless things which she would not need after her cocoon was spun but for them she would have had to drag the back part of her body around like a snake with them the back part of her body could walk as well as the front although not quite so fast she always took a few steps with her real legs and then waited for her prolegs to catch up as the weather grew colder the polyphemus caterpillar hunted around on the ground for a good place for her cocoon she found an excellent twig lying among the dead leaves and decided to fasten to that then began her hardest work spinning a fluffy mass of graywhite silk which clung to the twig and to one of the dry leaves and was almost exactly the color of the leaf other caterpillars came along and stopped to visit for they did not have to eat at cocoonspinning time better fasten your cocoon to a tree said a pale bluishgreen promethea caterpillar put it inside a curled leaf like mine and wind silk around the stem to strengthen it then you can swing every time the wind blows and the silk will keep the leaf from wearing out but i dont want to swing answered the polyphemus caterpillar id rather lie still and think about things fasten to the twig of a tree
 advised a pale green cecropia caterpillar with red yellow and blue bunches then the wind just moves you a little fasten it to a twig and taper it off nicely at each end and then yes said the polyphemus caterpillar and then the bluejays and chickadees will poke wheat or corn or beechnuts into the upper end of it i dont care to turn my sleeping room into a corncrib just here some other polyphemus caterpillars came along and agreed with their relative go ahead with your tree homes said they we know what we want and well see next summer who knew best the polyphemus cocoons were spun on the ground where the dead leaves had blown in between some stones and no wandering cows or sheep would be likely to step on them first a mass of coarse silk which it took half a day to make then an inside coating of a kind of varnish then as much silk as a caterpillar could spin in four or five days next another inside varnishing and the cocoons were done as the polyphemus caterpillars snuggled down for the long winters sleep each said to himself something like this those poor caterpillars in the trees how cold they will be i hope they may come out all right in the spring but i doubt it very much and when the cecropia and promethea caterpillars dozed off for the winter they said what a pity that those polyphemus caterpillars would lie around on the ground well we advised them what to do so it isnt our fault they all had a lovely winter and swung or swayed or lay still just as they had chosen to do early in the spring the farmers wife and little girl came out to find wild flowers and scraped the leaves away from among the stones out rolled the cocoon that the first polyphemus caterpillar had spun and the farmers wife picked it up and carried it off she might have found more cocoons if the little girl had not called her away this was how it happened that one may morning a little girl stood by the sittingroom window in the white farmhouse and watched miss polyphemus crawl slowly out of her cocoon a few days before a sour milkylooking stuff had begun to trickle into the lower end of the cocoon softening the hard varnish and the soft silken threads until a tiny doorway was opened now all was ready and miss polyphemus pushed out she was very wet and weak and forlorn oh said she to herself it is more fun to be a new caterpillar than it is to be a new moth ive only six legs left and it will be very hard worrying along on these i shall have to give up walking it was discouraging you can see how it would be she had been used to having so many legs and had looked forward all the summer before to the time when she should float lightly through the air and sip honey from flowers she had dreamed of it all winter and now here she waswet and weak with only six legs left and four very small and crumpled wings her body was so big and fat that she could not hold it up from the windowsill she wanted to cryit was all so sad and disappointing she would have done so had she not remembered how very unbecoming it is to cry when she remembered that she decided to take a nap instead and that was a most sensible thing to do for crying always makes matters worse while sleeping makes them better when she awakened she felt much stronger and more cheerful she was drier and her body felt lighter this was because the fluids from it were being pumped into her wings that was making them grow and the beautiful colors began to show more brightly on them i wonder she said to herself if moths always feel so badly when they first come out if she had but known it there were at that very time hundreds of moths as helpless as she clinging to branches leaves and stones all through the forest there were many polyphemus moths just out for in their family it is the custom for all to leave their cocoons at just about such a time in the morning perhaps she would have felt more patient if she had known this for it does seem to make hard times easier to bear when one knows that everybody else has hard times also of course other people always are having trouble but she was young and really believed for a time that she was the only uncomfortable moth in the world all day long her wings were stretching and growing smooth when it grew dark she was nearly ready to fly then the farmers wife lifted her gently by the wings and put her on the inside of the wire windowscreen when the lights in the house were all put out the moonbeams shone in on miss polyphemus and showed her beautiful sandcolored body and wings with the dark border on the front pair and the lighter border on the back pair on the back ones were dark eyespots with clear places in the middle through which one could see quite clearly i would like to fly sighed miss polyphemus and i believe i could if it were not for this horrid screen she did not know that the farmers wife had put her there to keep her safe from night birds until she was quite strong the wind blew in sweet with the scent of wild cherry and shadtree blossoms and poor miss polyphemus looked over toward the forest where she had lived when she was a caterpillar and wished herself safely there much good it does me to have wings when i cannot use them said she i want something to eat there is no honey to be sucked out of wire netting i wish i were a happy caterpillar again eating leaves on the trees she was not the first moth who has wished herself a caterpillar but she soon changed her mind there fluttered toward her another polyphemus moth a handsome fellow marked exactly as she was only with darker coloring his body was more slender and his feelers were very beautiful and feathery she was fat and had slender feelers ah said he i thought i should find you soon indeed she replied i wonder what made you think that my feelers of course said he they always tell me where to find my friends you know how that is yourself i said she as she changed her position a little i am just from my cocoon this was my comingout day and so you have not met any one yet he asked ah this is a strange worlda very strange world i would advise you to be very careful with whom you make friends there are so many bad moths you know goodevening said a third voice near them and another polyphemus moth with feathery feelers alighted on the screen he smiled sweetly at miss polyphemus and scowled fiercely at the other moth it would have ended in a quarrel right then and there if a fourth moth had not come at that minute one after another came until there were nine handsome fellows on the outside and miss polyphemus on the inside of the screen trying to entertain them all and keep them from quarrelling it made her very proud to think so many were at her comingout party still she would have enjoyed it better she thought if some whom she had known as caterpillars could be there to see how much attention she was having paid to her there was one caterpillar whom she had never liked she only wished that she could see her now still society tires one very much and it was hard to keep her guests from quarrelling when she got to talking with one about mapletrees another was sure to come up and say that he had always preferred beech when he was a caterpillar and the two outside would glare at each other while she hastily thought of something else to say at last those outside got to fighting there was only one the handsomest of all who said he thought too much of his feelers to fight anybody supposing i should fight and break them off said he i couldnt smell a thing for the rest of my life he was very sensible and really the eight other fellows were fighting on account of miss polyphemus for whenever they thought she liked one best they began to bump up against him  toward morning the farmers wife awakened and looked at miss polyphemus when she saw that she was strong enough to fly she opened the screen and let her go by that time three of those with feathery feelers were dead three were brokenwinged and clinging helplessly to the screen and two were so busy fighting that they didnt see miss polyphemus go the handsome great fellow who did not believe in fighting went with her and they lived in the forest after that but she never cared for society again beyond the forest and beside the river lay the marsh where the muskrats lived this was the same marsh to which the young frog had taken some of the meadow peoples children when they were tired of staying at home and wanted to travel when they went with him you remember they were gay and happy the sun was shining and the way did not seem long when they came back they were cold and wet and tired and thought it very far indeed one could never get them to say much about it some people like what others do not and ones opinion of a marsh must always depend on whether he is a grasshopper or a frog but whether people cared to live there or not the marsh had always been a pleasant place to see in the spring the tall tamaracks along the edge put on their new dresses of soft needleshaped green leaves the marshmarigolds held their bright faces up to the sun and hundreds of happy little people darted in and out of the tussocks of coarse grass there was a warm wet earthy smell in the air and near the pussywillows there was also a faint bitterness then the marsh hens made their nests and the sandpipers ran mincingly along by the quiet pools in summer time the beautiful moccasin flowers grew in family groups and over in the higher dryer part were masses of white boneset tall spikes of creamy foxglove and slender purple vervain in the fall the cattails stood stiffly among their yellow leaves and the redwinged blackbirds and the bobolinks perched upon them to plan their journey to the south even when the birds were gone and the cattails were ragged and worneven then the marsh was an interesting place soft snow clung to the brown seed clusters of boneset and filled the open silverygray
 pods of the milkweed in among the brown tussocks of grass ran the dainty footprints of mice and minks and here and there rose the coneshaped winter homes of the muskrats the muskrats were the largest people there and lived in the finest homes it is true that if a mink and a muskrat fought the mink was likely to get the better of the muskrat but people never spoke of this although everybody knew that it was so the muskrats were too proud to do so the minks were too wise to and the smaller people who lived near did not want to offend the muskrats by mentioning it it is said that an impudent young mouse did say something about it once when the muskrats could overhear him and that not one of them ever spoke to him again the next time he said goodevening to a muskrat the muskrat just looked at him as though he didnt see him or as though he had been a stick or a stone or something else uneatable and uninteresting the muskrats were very popular for they were kind neighbors and never stole their food from others that was why nobody was jealous of them although they were so fat and happy their children usually turned out very well even if they were not at all strictly brought up you know when a father and mother have to feed and care for fifteen or so children each summer there is not much time for teaching them to say please and thank you and pardon me sometimes these young muskrats did snatch and quarrel as on that night when fifteen of them went to visit their old home and all wanted to go in first you may recall how on that dreadful night their father had to spank them with his scaly tail and their mother sent them to bed they always remembered it and you may be very sure their parents did it makes parents feel dreadfully when their children quarrel and it is very wearing to have to spank fifteen at once particularly when one has to use his tail with which to do it there was one old bachelor muskrat who had always lived for himself and had his own way more than was good for him if he had married it would not have been so and he would have grown used to giving up to somebody else he was a finelooking fellow with soft short reddishbrown fur which shaded almost to black on his back and to a light gray underneath there were very few hairs on his long flat scaly tail and most of these were in two fringes one down the middle of the upper side and the other down the middle of the lower side his tiny ears hardly showed above the fur on his head and he was so fat that he really seemed to have no neck at all to look at his feet you would hardly think he could swim for the webs between his toes were very very small and his feet were not large he was like all other muskrats in using a great deal of perfume and it was not a pleasant kind being so strong and musky he thought it quite right and it was better so for he couldnt help wearing it and you can just imagine how distressing it would be to see a muskrat going around with his nose turned up and all the time finding fault with his own perfume nobody could remember the time when there had been no muskrats in the marsh the ground hog who lived near the edge of the forest said that his grandfather had often spoken of seeing them at play in the moonlight and there was an old rattlesnake who had been married several times and wore fourteen joints in his rattle who said that he remembered seeing muskrats there before he cast his first skin and it was not strange that after their people had lived there so long the muskrats should be fond of the marsh one day in midsummer the farmer and his men came to the marsh with spades and grubhoes and measuring lines all of them had on high rubber boots and they tramped around and measured and talked and rooted up a few huckleberry bushes and drove a good many stakes into the soft and spongy ground then the dinnerbell at the farmhouse rang and they went away it was a dull cloudy day and a few of the muskrats were out if it had been sunshiny they would have stayed in their burrows they paddled over to where the stakes were and smelled of them and gnawed at them and wondered why the men had put them there i know said one young muskrat who had married and set up a home of his own that spring i know why they put these stakes in oh do listen cried the young muskrats wife he knows and will tell us all about it nobody ever told me this said the young husband i thought it out myself the ground hog once said that they put small pieces of potato into the ground to grow into whole big ones and they have done the same sort of thing here you see the farmer wanted a fence and so he stuck down these stakes and before winter he will have a fence well grown humph said the bachelor muskrat it seemed as though he had meant to say more but the young wife looked at him with such a frown on her furry forehead that he shut his mouth as tightly as he could he never could quite close it and said nothing else do you mean to tell me said one who had just sent five children out of her burrow to make room for another lot of babies that they will grow a fence here where it is so wet fences grow on high land that is what i said answered the young husband slapping his tail on the water to make himself seem more important well said the anxious mother if they go to growing fences and such things around here i shall move every one of my children will want to play around it and as like as not will eat its roots and get sick then the men came back and all the muskrats ran toward their burrows dived into the water to reach the doors of them and then crawled up the long hallways that they had dug out of the bank until they got to the large rooms where they spent most of their days and kept their babies that night the young husband was the first muskrat to come out and he went at once to the line of stakes he had been lying awake and thinking while his wife was asleep and he was afraid he had talked too much he found that the stakes had not grown any and that the men had begun to dig a deep ditch beside them he was afraid that his neighbors would point their paws at him and ask how the fence was growing and he was not brave enough to meet them and say that he had been mistaken he went down the river bank and fed alone all night while his wife and neighbors were grubbing and splashing around in the marsh or swimming in the river near their homes the young muskrats were rolling and tumbling in the moonlight and looking like furry brown balls after it began to grow light he sneaked back to his burrow every day the men came in their high rubber boots to work and every day there were more ditches and the marsh was drier by the time that the flowers had all ripened their seeds and the forest trees were bare the marsh was changed to dry ground and the muskrats could find no water there to splash in one night and it was a very very dark one they came together to talk about winter it is time to begin our coldweather houses said one old muskrat i have never started so soon but we are to have an early winter yes and a long one too added his wife who said that mr muskrat never told things quite strongly enough it will be cold said another muskrat and we shall need to build thick walls why asked a little muskrat sh said his mother the question is said the old muskrat who had first spoken where we shall build why asked the little muskrat pulling at his mothers tail shh said his mother there is no water here except in the ditches said the oldest muskrat and of course we would not build beside them why not asked the little muskrat and this time he actually poked his mother in the side shhh said she how many times must i speak to you dont you know that young muskrats should be seen and not heard but i cant be seen he whimpered it is so dark that i cant be seen and youve just got to hear me of course after he had spoken in that way to his mother and interrupted all the others by his naughtiness he had to be punished so his mother sent him to bed that is very hard for young muskrats for the night you know is the time when they have the most fun the older ones talked and talked about what they should do they knew as they always do know just what sort of winter they were to have and that they must begin to build at once some years they had waited until a whole month later but that was because they expected a late and mild winter at last the oldest muskrat decided for them we will move tomorrow night said he we will go to the swamp on the other side of the forest and build our winter homes there all the muskrats felt sad about going and for a minute it was so still that you might almost have heard a milkweed seed break loose from the pod and float away then a gruff voice broke the silence i will not go it said i was born here and i will live here i never have left this marsh and i never will leave it they could not see who was speaking but they knew it was the bachelor the oldest muskrat said afterward that he was so surprised you could have knocked him over with a blade of grass of course you couldnt have done it because he was so fat and heavy but that is what he said and it shows just how he felt the other muskrats talked and talked and talked with him but it made no difference his brothers told him it was perfectly absurd for him to stay that people would think it queer and that he ought to go with the rest of his relatives yet it made no difference you should stay he would reply our family have always lived here when the muskrat mothers told him how lonely he would be and how he would miss seeing the dear little ones frolic in the moonlight he blinked and said well i shall just have to stand it then he sighed and they went away saying to each other what a tender heart he had and what a pity it was that he had never married one of them spoke as though he had been in love with her some years before but
 the others had known nothing about it the muskrat fathers told him that he would have no one to help him if a mink should pick a quarrel with him i can take care of myself then said he and showed his strong gnawing teeth in a very fierce way it was only when the dainty young muskrat daughters talked to him that he began to wonder if he really ought to stay he lay awake most of one day thinking about it and remembering the sad look in their little eyes when they said that they should miss him he was so disturbed that he ate only three small roots during the next night the poor old bachelor had a hard time then but he was so used to having his own way and doing what he had started to do and not giving up to anybody that he stayed after all the others went away and he began to build his winter house beside the biggest ditch he placed it among some bushes so that if the water in the ditch should ever overflow they would help hold his house in place he built it with his mouth bringing great mouthfuls of grass roots and rushes and dropping them on the middle of the heap sometimes they stayed there and sometimes they rolled down if they rolled down he never brought them back for he knew that they would be useful where they were when it was done the house was shaped like a pine cone with the stem end down for after he had made it as high as a tall milkweed he finished off the long slope up which he had been running and made it look like the other sides after that he began to burrow up into it from below the right way to do he knew was to have his doorway under water and dive down to it other winters he had done this and had given the water a loud slap with his tail as he dived now there was not enough water to dive into and when he tried slapping on it his tail went through to the ditch bottom and got muddy he had to fix the doorway as best he could and then he ate out enough of the inside of his house to make a good room and poked a small hole through the roof to let in fresh air after the house was done he slept there during the days and prowled around outside at night he slept there but ate none of the roots of which it was made until the water in the ditch was frozen hard he knew that there would be a long long time when he could not dig fresh roots and must live on those at night the marsh seemed so empty and lonely that he hardly knew what to do he didnt enjoy his meals and often complained to the mice that the roots did not taste so good to him as those they used to have when he was young he tried eating other things and found them no better when there was bright moonlight he sat upon the highest tussock he could find and thought about his grandfathers and grandmothers if they had not eaten their houses he once said to a mouse this marsh would be full of them no it wouldnt answered the mouse who didnt really mean to contradict him but thought him much mistaken if the houses hadnt been eaten they would have been blown down by the wind and beaten down by rains and washed away by floods it is better so who wants things to stay the way they are forever and ever id rather see the trees drop their leaves once in a while and grow new ones than to wear the same old ones after they are ragged and faded the bachelor muskrat didnt like this very well but he couldnt forget it when he awakened in the daytime he would think about it and at night he thought more he was really very forlorn and because he had nobody else to think about he thought too much of himself and began to believe that he was lame and sick when he sat on a tussock and remembered all the houses which his grandparents had built and eaten he became very sad and sighed until his fat sides shook he wished that he could sleep through the winter like the ground hog or through part of it like the skunk but just as sure as night came his eyes popped open and there he wasawake when spring came he thought of his friends who had gone to the swamp and he knew that last years children were marrying and digging burrows of their own the poor old bachelor wanted to go to them yet he was so used to doing what he had said he would and disliked so much to let anybody know that he was mistaken that he chose to stay where he was without water enough for diving and with hardly enough for swimming how it would have ended nobody knows had the farmer not come to plough up the old drained marsh for planting celery then the bachelor went he reached his new home in the early morning and the mothers let their children stay up until it was quite light so that he might see them plainly isnt it pleasant here they cried dont you like it better than the old place oh it does very well he answered but you must remember that i only moved because i had to oh yes we understand that said one of the mothers but we hope you will really like it here afterward her husband said to her dont you know he was glad to come whats the use of being so polite poor old fellow she answered he is so queer because he lives alone and im sorry for him just see him eat and truly it was worth while to watch him for the roots tasted sweet to him and although he had not meant to be he was very happyfar happier than if he had had his own way the red fox had been well brought up his mother was a most cautious person and devoted to her children when he did things which were wrong he could never excuse himself by saying that he did not know better of course it is possible that he was like his father in being so reckless yet none of his two brothers and three sisters were like him they did not remember their father in fact they had never seen him and their mother seldom spoke of him his mother had taken all the care of her six children even pulling fur from her own belly to make a soft nest covering for them when they were first born they were such helpless babies their eyes and ears were closed for some time and all they could do was to tumble each other around and drink the warm milk that their mother had for them they had three burrows to live in all of them in an open field between the forest and the farmhouse sometimes they lived in the first sometimes in the second and sometimes in the third one night when their mother went out to hunt she smelled along the ground near the burrow and then came back there has been a man near here she said and i shall take you away that excited the little foxes very much and each wanted to be the first to go but she hushed them up and said that if they talked so loudly as that some man might catch them before they moved and then she said nothing more yet they knew from the way she moved her tail that it would be dreadful to have a man catch them while she was carrying them to another burrow one at a time those who were left behind talked about men i wish i knew why men are so dreadful said the first it must be because they have very big mouths and sharp teeth i wonder what color their fur is said another now these young foxes had seen nobody but their mother if she had not told them that different animals wore different colored furs they would have thought that everybody looked just like her with long reddishyellow fur and that on the hinder part of the back quite grizzled throat belly and the tip of the tail white and the outside of the ears black they were very sure however that no other animal had such a wonderful tail as she with each of its long reddish hairs tipped with black and the beautiful brush of pure white at the end in fact she had told them so the next time their mother came back the four children who were still there cried out please tell us what color is a mans fur she was a sensible and prudent fox and knew it was much more important to keep her children from being caught than it was to answer all their questions at once besides she already had one child in her mouth when they finished their question and she would not put him down for the sake of talking and that also was right you know for one can talk at any time but the time to do work is just when it needs to be done after they were snugly settled in the other burrow she lay down to feed them and while they were drinking their milk she told them about men men she said are the most dreadful animals there are other animals will not trouble you unless they are hungry but a man will chase you even when his stomach is full they have four legs of courseall animals havebut they use only two to walk upon their front legs they use for carrying things we carry with our mouths yet the only thing i ever saw a man have in his mouth was a short brown stick that was afire at one end i thought it very silly for he couldnt help breathing some of the smoke and he let the stick burn up and then threw the fire away however men are exceedingly silly animals one of the little red foxes stopped drinking long enough to say you didnt tell us what color their fur is the only fur they have said mother fox is on their heads they usually have fur on the top and back parts of their heads and some of them have a little on the lower part of their faces they may have black red brown gray or white fur it is never spotted the children would have liked to ask more questions but mother fox had eaten nothing since the night before and was in a hurry to begin her hunt one could never tell all that happened to the little red foxes they moved from burrow to burrow many times they learned to eat meat which their mother brought them instead of drinking milk from her body they frolicked together near the doorway of their home and while they did this their mother watched from the edge of the forest ready to warn them if she saw men or dogs coming she had chosen to dig her burrows in the middle of a field because then there was no chance for men or dogs to sneak up to them unseen as there would have been in the forest yet she feared that her children would be playing
 so hard that they might forget to watch they slept most of the day and at night they were always awake when they were old enough they began to hunt for themselves mother fox gave them a great deal of good advice and then paid no more attention to them after that she took her naps on a sunny hillside lying in a beautiful soft reddishyellow bunch with her bushy tail curled around to keep her feet warm and shade her eyes from the light the six brothers and sisters seldom saw each other after this foxes succeed better in life if they live alone and of course they wanted to succeed the eldest brother was the reckless one his mother had done her best by him and still he was reckless he knew by heart all the rules that she had taught him but he did not keep them these were the rules always run on hard dry things when you can soft wet places take more scent from your feet and dogs can follow your trail better on them never go into any place unless you are sure you can get out keep your tail dry a fox with a wet tail cannot run well if dogs are chasing you jump on to a rail fence and run along the top of it or walk in a brook always be willing to work for your food that which you find all ready and waiting for you may be the bait of a trap always walk when you are hunting the fox who trots will pass by that which he should find for a while he said them over to himself every night when he started out then he began to skip a night once in a while next he got to saying them only when he had been frightened the day before after that he stopped saying them altogether i am a fullgrown fox now he said to himself and such things are only good for children i guess i know how to take care of myself he often went toward the farmhouse to hunt sometimes for grapes sometimes for vegetables and sometimes for heartier food collie had chased him away but collie was growing old and fat and had to hang his tongue out when he ran so the red fox thought it only fun he trotted along in the moonlight his light slender body seeming to almost float over the ground and his beautiful tail held straight out behind his short slender legs were strong and did not tire easily and as long as he could keep his tall dry he outran collie easily sometimes he would get far ahead and sit down to wait for him then he would call out saucy things to the panting dog and only start on when collies nose had almost touched him fine evening he once said hope your nose works better than your legs do that was a mean thing to say you know but collie always keeps his temper and only answered its sweating finely thank you he answered that way because it is the sweat on a dogs nose which makes it possible for him to smell and follow scents which drynosed people do not even know about then the fox gave a long light leap and was off again and collie had to lie down to breathe i think said he that i can tend sheep better than i can chase foxesand it is a good deal easier still collie didnt like to be beaten and he lay awake the rest of the night thinking how he would enjoy catching that fox every little while he heard the red fox barking off in the fields and it made him twitch his tail with impatience now the red fox was walking carefully toward the farmhouse and planning to catch a turkey he had watched the flocks of turkeys all afternoon from his sleepingplace on the hillside every time he opened his eyes between naps he had looked at them as they walked to and fro in the fields talking to each other in their gentle complaining voices and moving their heads back and forth at every step if his stomach had not been so full he would have tried to catch one then he made up his mind to try it that night and decided that he would rather have the plump lightcolored one than any of her darker sisters he did not even think of catching the old gobbler for he was so big and strong and fiercelooking he had just begun to walk with the turkey mothers and children during the summer they had had nothing to do with each other when the red fox reached the farmyard he found them roosting on the low branches of an appletree a long board had been placed against it to let the chickens walk up now the chickens were in the henhouse but the board was still there the red fox looked all around it was a starlight night the farmhouse was dark and quiet collie was nowhere to be seen once he heard a horse stamp in his sleep then all was still again the red fox walked softly up the slanting board the gobbler stirred the red fox stopped with one foot in the air when he thought him fast asleep he went on the gobbler stirred again and so did the others the red fox sprang for the plump lightcolored one she jumped also and with the others flew far up to the top of the barn the red fox ran down the board with five buff tailfeathers in his mouth he was much out of patience with himself if i hadnt stopped to pick for her he said i could have caught one of the others easily enough he sneaked around in the shadows to see if the noise made by the turkeys had awakened the farmer or collie the farmhouse was still and dark collie was not at home i will look at the henhouse said the red fox he walked slowly and carefully to the henhouse the big door was closed and bolted he walked all around and into the poultry yard there was a small opening through which the fowls could pass in and out the red fox managed to crawl though but it was not easy it squeezed his body and crushed his fur he had to push very hard with his hind feet to get through at all when he was inside it took him some time to get his breath thats the tightest place i ever was in said he softly but i always could crawl through a very small hole he found the fowls all roosting too high for him perhaps if the henhouse had been larger he might have leaped and caught one but there was not room for one of his finest springs he went to the nests and found many eggs there these he broke and ate they ran down in yellow streams from the corners of his mouth and made his long fur very sticky you can just imagine how hard it would be to eat raw eggs from the shell with only your paws in which to hold them one egg was light and slippery he bit hard to break that one and when it broke it was hollow not a drop of anything to eat in it and then it cut his lip a little too so that he could not eat more without its hurting he jumped and said something when he was cut the shanghai cock who was awakened by the noise said that he exclaimed brambles and traps but it may not have been anything so bad as that we will hope it was not the shanghai cock awakened all the other fowls dont fly off your perch he cried stay where you are stay where where you are stay where you are the other cocks kept saying eruuuu as they do when hawks are near the hens squawked and squawked and squawked until they were out of breath when they got their breath they squawked some more the red fox knew that it was time for him to go the farmer would be sure to hear the noise he put his head out of the hole through which he had come in and he pushed as hard as he could with his hind feet and scrambled with his fore feet his fur was crushed worse than ever and he was squeezed so tightly that he could hardly breathe you see it had been all he could do to get in through the hole and now he had nine eggs in his stomach excepting what had run down at the corners of his mouth and he was too large to pass through the fowls saw what was the matter and wanted to laugh they thought it very funny and yet the sooner he could get away the better they would like it the red fox had his head outside and saw a light flash in the farmers room then he heard doors open and the farmer came toward the henhouse with a lantern in his hand collie came trotting around the corner of the house the red fox made one last desperate struggle and then lay still when the farmer picked him up and tied a rope around his neck he had to pull him backward into the henhouse to do it the red fox was very quiet and gentle as people of his family always are when caught collie pranced around on two legs and barked as loudly as he could the fowls blinked their round yellow eyes in the lantern light and the farmers man ran out for an empty chickencoop into which to put the red fox collie was usually quite polite but he had not forgotten how rude the red fox had been to him and it was a fine chance to get even good evening he barked oh good evening im glad you came dont think you must be going excuse me but your mouth worked better than your legs didnt it the red fox shut his eyes and pretended not to hear the dirt from the floor of the henhouse had stuck to his eggcovered fur and he looked very badly they put him in a chickencoop with a board floor so that he couldnt burrow out and he curled down in a little heap and hid his face with his tail collie hung around for a while and then went off to sleep after he was gone the red fox cleaned his fur i got caught this time he said but it wont happen again now i must watch for a chance to get away it will surely come it did come but that is another story several very large families of fireflies lived in the marsh and were much admired by their friends who were awake at night once in a while some young firefly who happened to awaken during the day would go out and hover over the heads of the daylight people he never had any attention paid to him then however for during the day he seemed like a very commonplace little beetle and nobody even cared to look at him a second time the only remarkable thing about him was the soft light that shone from his body and that could only be seen at night the older fireflies told the younger ones that they should get all the sleep they could during the daytime if they were to flutter and frisk all night most of them did this but two young fireflies who cared more about seeing
 the world than they did about minding their elders used to run away while the rest were dreaming each thought herself very important and was sure that if the others missed her they wouldnt sleep a wink all day one night they planned to go by daylight to the farthest corner of the marsh they had heard a couple of young muskrats talking about it and thought it might be different from anything they had seen they went to bed when the rest did and pretended to fall asleep when she was sure that the older fireflies were dreaming one of them reached over with her right hind leg and touched the other just below the edge of her left wingcover are you ready she whispered yes answered the friend who happened to be the smaller of the two come on then said the larger one picking her way along on her six tiptoes it was already growing light and they could see where they stepped but you know it is hard to walk over rough places on two tiptoes so you can imagine what it must be on six there are some pleasant things about having many legs there are also some hard things it is a great responsibility when well away from their sleeping relatives they lifted their wingcovers spread their wings and flew to the farthest corner of the marsh they were not afraid of being punished if caught for they were orphans and had nobody to bring them up they were afraid that if the other fireflies awakened they would be called silly or foolish young bugs they thought that they were old enough to take care of themselves and did not want advice oh wouldnt they make a fuss if they knew exclaimed the larger firefly they think we need to be told every single thing said the smaller firefly guess were old enough now to go off by ourselves said the larger firefly i guess so answered the smaller firefly im not afraid if it is light and i can see pretty near as well as i can at night just then a flycatcher darted toward them and they had to hide he had come so near that they could look down his throat as he flew along with his beak open the fireflies were so scared that their feelers shook i wish that bird would mind his own business grumbled the larger firefly thats just what he was doing said a voice beside them as a garter snake drew himself through the grass then their feelers shook again for they knew that snakes do not breakfast on grass and berries did you ever see such luck said the smaller firefly if it isnt birds it is snakes perfectly dreadful answered the other i never knew the marsh to be so full of horrid people besides my eyes are bothering me and i cant see plainly so are mine said the smaller firefly are you going to tell the other fireflies all about things tonight i dont know that i will said the larger firefly ill make them ask me first then they reached the farther corner of the marsh and crawled around to see what they could find their eyes bothered them so that they could not see unless they were close to things so it was useless to fly they peeped into the cool dark corners under the skunk cabbage leaves and lay down to rest on a bed of soft moss a few stalks of last years teazles stood stiff and brown in the corner of the fence the smaller firefly alighted on one and let go in such a hurry that she fell to the ground ouch she cried it has sharp hooks all over it while they were lying on the moss and resting they noticed a queer plant growing near it had a flower of green and dark red which was unlike any other blossom they had ever seen the leaves were even queerer each was stiff and hollow and grew right out of the ground instead of coming from a stalk im going to crawl into one of them said the larger firefly there is something sweet inside i believe it will be lots better than the skunk cabbage she balanced herself on the top of a fresh green leaf im going into this one said the other firefly as she alighted on the edge of a browntipped leaf it looks nice and dark inside we must tell about this at the party tonight even if they dont ask us then they repeated together the little verse that some of the pond people use when they want to start together  tussock mud water and log  muskrat snake turtle and frog  here we go into the bog when they said bog each dropped quickly into her own leaf for a minute nobody made a sound then there was a queer sputtering choking voice in the fresh green leaf and exactly the same in the browntipped one after that a weak little voice in the green leaf said abuschougerh i fell into water another weak voice from the browntipped one replied gtschagust so did i on the inside of each leaf were many stiff hairs all pointing downward when the fireflies dropped in they had brushed easily past these hairs and thought it rather pleasant now that they were sputtering and choking inside and wanted to get out these same hairs stuck into their eyes and pushed against their legs and made them exceedingly uncomfortable the water too had stood for some time in the leaves and did not smell good perhaps it would be just as well not to tell all the things which those two fireflies said for they were tired and out of patience after a while they gave up trying to get out until they should be rested it was after sunset when they tried the last time and the light that shone from their bellies brightened the little green rooms where they were they rested and went at it carefully instead of in the angry jerky way which they had tried before slowly one foot at a time they managed to climb out of the doorway at the top as they came out they heard the squeaky voice of a young mouse say oh where did those bright things come from they also heard his mother answer those are only a couple of foolish fireflies who have been in the leaves of the pitcherplant all day after they had eaten something they flew toward home they knew that it would be late for the party and they expected to surprise and delight everybody when they reached there on the way they spoke of this im dreadfully tired said one but i suppose we shall have to dance in the air with the rest or they will make a fuss yes said the other it spoils everything if we are not there and well have to tell where weve been and what weve done and whom we have seen when we would rather go to sleep and make up what we lost during the daytime as they came near the middle of the marsh they were surprised to see the mild summer air twinkling with hundreds of tiny lights as their friends and relatives flew to and fro in the dusk well said the larger firefly i think they might have waited for us humph said the smaller firefly if they cant be more polite than that i wont play after weve had such a dreadfully hard time too said the larger firefly got most eaten by a flycatcher and scared by a garter snake and shut up all day in the pitcherplant i wont move a wing to help on their old party so two very tired and cross young fireflies sat on a last years cattail and sulked people didnt notice them because they were sitting and their bright bellies didnt show after a long time an elderly firefly came to rest on the cattail and found them good evening said he have you danced until you are tired they looked at each other but before either could speak one of their young friends alighted beside them and said the same thing then the smaller firefly answered we have been away said she and we are not dancing tonight going away did you say asked the elderly firefly who was rather deaf i hope you will have a delightful time then he bowed and flew off dont stay long added their young friend we shall be so lonely without you after he also was gone the two runaways looked into each others eyes we were not even missed they cried we had a bad time and nobody makes any fuss they were dancing without us poor little fireflies they were much wiser after that for they had learned that two young fireflies were not so wonderfully important after all and that if they chose to do things which it was never meant young fireflies should do they would be likely to have a very disagreeable time but that other fireflies would go on eating and dancing and living their own lives to be happy they must keep the firefly laws one day the three big kittens who lived with their mother in the farmers barn had a dreadful quarrel if their mother had been with them she would probably have cuffed each with her fore paw and scolded them soundly she was not with them because she had four little new kittens lying beside her in the hayloft over the stalls you would think that the older kittens must have been very proud of their baby brothers and sisters yet they were not they might have done kind little things for their mother but they didnt they just hunted food for themselves and never took a mouthful of it to her and this does not prove that they were bad kittens it just shows that they were young and thoughtless the brown kitten the one whose fur was black and yellow mixed so finely as to look brown had climbed the barn stairs to see them when he reached their corner he sat down and growled at them his mother said nothing at first but when he went so far as to switch his tail in a threatening way she left her new babies and sprang at him and told him not to show his whiskers upstairs again until he could behave properly his sisters the yellow kitten and the white kitten stayed downstairs they didnt dislike babies so much as their brother they just didnt care anything about them cats never care much about kittens you know unless they are their own and big brothers always say that they cant bear them now these three older kittens were perfectly able to care for themselves it was a long time since their mother stopped feeding them and they were already excellent hunters they had practised crouching crawling and springing before they left the hayloft sometimes they hunted wisps of hay that moved when the wind blew in through the open door
 sometimes they pounced on each other and sometimes they hunted the grasshoppers who got brought in with the hay it was when they were doing this once that they were so badly scared but that is a story which has already been told there was no reason why they should feel neglected or worry about getting enough to eat if one of them had poor luck in hunting all he had to do was to hang around the barn when the cows were brought up and go into the house with the man when he carried the great pails full of foamy milk then if the kittens acted hungry mewed very loudly and rubbed up lovingly against the farmers wife they were sure to get a good dishful of warm milk you can see how unreasonable they were they had plenty to eat and their mother loved them just as much as ever but they felt hurt and sulked around in corners and answered each other quite rudely and would not run after a string which the farmers little girl dangled before them they were not cross all the time because they had been up the whole night and had to sleep they stopped being cross when they fell asleep and began again as soon as they awakened the hens who were feeding around became so used to it that as soon as they saw a kitten twist and squirm and act like awakening they put their heads down and ran away as fast as they could they did not even keep themselves clean oh they licked themselves over two or three times during the day but not thoroughly the yellow kitten did not once try to catch her tail and scrub it and actually wore an unwashed tail all day it didnt show very plainly because it was yellow but that made it no cleaner the white kitten went around with her fore paws looking really disgraceful the brown kitten scrubbed his ears in a sort of halfhearted way and paid no attention to the place under his chin when he did his ears he gave his paw one lick and his ear one rub and repeated this only six times everybody knows that a truly tidy cat wets his paw with two licks cleans his ear with two rubs and does this over and over from twenty to forty times before he begins on the other ear toward night they quarrelled over a dishful of milk which the farmers wife gave them there was plenty of room for them all to put their heads into the dish at once and lap until each had his share if it had not been for their whiskers there would have been no trouble these hit and each told the others to step back and wait nobody did and there was such a fuss that the farmers wife took the dish away and none of them had any more they began to blame each other and talk so loudly that the man drove them all away as fast as they could scamper now that they were separated each began to grow more and more discontented the brown kitten had crawled under the carriage house and as soon as it was really dark he stole off to the forest my mother has more kittens he said and my sisters get my whiskers all out of shape and ill go away and never come back i wont say goodby to them either i guess theyll feel badly then and wish theyd been nicer to me if they ever find me and want me to come back i wont go not if they beg and beg ill just turn my tail toward them and walk away the brown kitten knew that cats sometimes went to live in the woods and got along very well he was not acquainted with one who had done this his mother had told him and his sisters stories of cats who chose to live so she said that was one thing which showed how much more clever they were than dogs dogs you know cannot live happily away from men although there may be the best of hunting around them i will find a good hollow tree said he for my home and i will sleep there all day and hunt at night i will eat so much that i shall grow large and strong then when i go out to hunt the forest people will say sh here comes the brown cat as he thought this he was running softly along the country road toward the forest once in a while he stopped to listen and stood with his head raised and turned and one fore foot in the air he kept his ears pointed forward all the time so as to hear better when he passed the marsh he saw the fireflies dancing in the air sometimes they flew so low that a kitten might catch them he thought he would try so he crawled through the fence and toward the place where they were dancing he passed two tired ones sitting on a leaf and never saw them that was because their wings covered their sides so well that no light shone past and their bright bellies were close to the leaf he had almost reached the dancers when he found his paws getting wet and muddy that made him turn back at once for mud was something he couldnt stand i wish i had something to eat he said as he took a bite of catnip this is very good for a relish but not for a whole meal he trotted on toward the forest thinking about milk and fireflies and several other things when he was stopped by some great winged person flying down toward him and then sweeping upward and alighting on a branch the brown kitten drew back stiffly and said haaah who who to who asked the person on the branch the brown kitten answered it is i but the question came again who who to who that made the brown kitten remember that since his voice was not known in the forest nobody could tell anything by his answer this time he replied i am the brown kitten if you please and i have come to live in the forest who who to who was the next question and the brown kitten thought he was asked to whose home he was going i am not going to anybody he said i just wanted to come and left my old home suddenly i shall live alone and have a good time i didnt even tell my mother who who to who said the great horned owl for it was he my mmother said the brown kitten and then he ran away as fast as he could he had seen the owl more clearly as he spoke and the owls face reminded him a little of his mother and made him want to see her he ran so fast that he almost bumped into the skunk who was taking a dignified stroll through the forest and sniffing at nearly everything he saw it was very lucky you know that he did not quite run into the skunk for skunks do not like to be run into and if he had done so other people would soon have been sniffing at him the brown kitten thought that the skunk might be related to him they were about the same size and the brown kitten had been told that his relatives were not only different colors but different shapes his mother had told of seeing some manx kittens who had no tails at all and he thought that the skunks elegant longhaired one neednt prevent his being a cat good evening said the brown kitten would you mind telling me if you are a cat cat no growled the skunk they sometimes call me a woodkitty but they have no right to i am a skunk skunk skunk and i am related to the weasles step out of my path a family of young raccoons in a tree called down teasingly to him to come up but after he had started they told him to go down and then laughed at him because he had to go tail first he did not know that forest climbers turn the toes of their hind feet backward and scamper down head first still it would have made no difference if he had known for his toes wouldnt turn he found something to eat now and then and he looked for a hollow tree he found only one and that was a bee tree so he couldnt use it all around him the most beautiful mushrooms were pushing up from the ground white yellow orange red and brown they were and looked so plump and fair that he wanted to bite them he knew however that some of them were very poisonous so he didnt even lick them with his eager rough little pink tongue he was just losing his kitten teeth and his new cat teeth were growing and they made him want to bite almost everything he saw one kind of mushroom which he thought the prettiest of all grew only on the trunks of fallen beech trees it was white and had a great many little branches all very close together most of the plants which he saw were sound asleep every plant has to sleep you know and most of them take a long nap at night some of them like the waterlilies also sleep on cloudy days he was very fond of the clovers but they had their leaflets folded tight and only the mushrooms the evening primroses and a few others were wide awake everybody whom he met was a stranger and he began to feel very lonely cats do not usually mind being alone indeed they rather like it still you can see how hard it would be for a kitten who had always been loved and cared for to find himself alone in a dark forest where great birds ask the same questions over and over and other people make fun of him you wouldnt like it yourself if you were a kitten at last when he was prowling along an old forest road and hoping to meet a tender young woodmouse he saw a couple of lightcolored animals ahead of him they looked to him very much like kittens but he remembered how the skunk had snubbed him when taken for a cat and he kept still he ran to overtake them and see more clearly and just as he reached them they all came to a turn in the road before he could speak or they could notice that he was there the wind roared through the branches above and just ahead two terrible great eyes glared at them out of an old log they all stopped with their backfur bristling and their tails arched stiffly not a sound did one of them make they lifted first one foot and then another and backed slowly and silently away when they had gone far enough they turned quickly and ran down the old road as fast as their twelve feet could carry them they never stopped until they were in the road for home and could look back in the starlight and be sure that nobody was following them then they stared at each otherthe yellow kitten the white kitten and the brown kitten did you run away to live in the forest asked the sisters did you asked the brown kitten youll never tell said they never said he well then we did run
 away and met each other just before you came we meant to live in the forest so did i said he and i couldnt find any hollow tree did you meet that dreadful bird said theythe one who never hears your answers and keeps asking you over and over yes said he dont you ever tell haha screamed a laughing little screechowl who had seen what had happened in the old forest road and flapped along noiselessly behind them three big kittens afraid of foxfire oho oho now all of them had heard about foxfire and knew it was the light which shines from some kinds of rotten wood in the dark but they held up their heads and answered were not afraid of foxfire haha screamed the screechowl again thought you saw big eyes glaring at you only foxfire dare you to come back if you are not afraid we dont want to go back answered the brown kitten we havent time haha screamed the screechowl havent time where are you going going home of course answered the brown kitten and then he whispered to his sisters lets all right said they and they raced down the road as fast as they could go to this day their mother does not know that they ever ran away from home but it was only foxfire the weasels were very unpopular with most of the forest people the pond and meadow people did not like them and those who lived in the farmyard couldnt bear them something went wrong there every time that a weasel came to call once you know the dorking hen was so frightened that she broke her wonderful shiny egg and there were other times when even worse things had happened usually there was a chicken or two missing after the weasel had gone the weasels were very fond of their own family however and would tell their best secrets to each other that meant almost as much with them as to share food for they were very inquisitive and always wanted to know all about everything they minded their own business but they minded everybodys else as well if you told a thing to one weasel you might be sure that before the night was over every weasel in the neighborhood would know all about it they told other people too when they had a chance they were dreadful gossips if they saw a person do something the least unusual they thought about it and talked about it and wondered what it meant and decided that it meant something very remarkable and became very much excited at such times they made many excuses to go calling and always managed to tell about what they had seen what they had heard and what they were perfectly certain it meant they went everywhere and could go quietly and without being noticed they were small people about as long as rats but much more slender and with such short legs that their bodies seemed to almost lie on the ground all their fur was brown except that on their bellies and the inside of their legs which was pure white sometimes the fur on their feet matched their backs and sometimes it matched their bellies that was as might happen you can easily see how they could steal along over the brown earth or the dead leaves and grass without showing plainly in winter they turned white and then they did not show on the snow the very tip of their short tails stayed a pale brown but it was so tiny as hardly to be noticed any hawk in the air who saw just that bit of brown on the snow beneath him would be likely to think it a leaf or a piece of bark and pay no more attention to it the weasel mothers were very careful of their children and very brave it made no difference how great the danger might be they would stay by their babies and fight for them and such workers as they were it made no difference to them whether it was day or night they would burrow or hunt just the same when they were tired they slept and when they awakened they began at once to do something several families lived in the high bank by the edge of the forest just where the ground slopes down to the marsh they had lived there year after year and had kept on adding to their burrows there was only one doorway to each burrow and that was usually hidden by some leaves or a stone they were hardly as large as chipmunks holes and easily hidden it is a good thing to have a fine large home said the weasels but we build for comfort not for show all the weasel burrows began alike with a straight narrow hall then more halls branched off from this and every little way there would be a room in which to turn around or rest in some of these they stored food in others they had nothing but bones and things which were left from their meals each burrow had one fine large room bigger than an ovenbirds nest with a soft bed of leaves and fur some of the rooms were so near the top of the ground that a weasel could dig his way up in a few minutes if he needed another door they were the loveliest sort of places for playing hideandseek and that is a favorite weasel game only every weasel wants to seek instead of hiding there was never a bit of loose earth around these homes and that is the one secret which weasels will not tell out of the familythey never tell what they do with the earth they dig out it just disappears weasels like to hunt in parties they say there is no fun in doing anything unless you have somebody with whom to talk it over one night four of them went out together as soon as it was dark they were young fellows and had planned to go to the farmers henhouse for the first time they started to go there but of course they wanted to see everything by the way they would run straight ahead for a little while then turn off to one side as ants do poking into a chipmunks hole or climbing a tree to find a birds nest eating whatever food they found and talking softly about everything it is disgraceful the way that chipmunk keeps house said one of them as he came back from going through a burrow under a tree halfeaten food dropped right on the floor of the burrow in the most careless way it was only a nut if it had been anything i cared for i would have eaten it myself then they gossiped about chipmunks and said that although they always looked trim and neat there was no telling what sort of housekeepers they were and that it really seemed as though they would do better to stay at home more and run about the forest less the chipmunk heard all this from the tree where he had hidden himself and would have liked to speak right out and tell them what he thought of callers who entered ones home without knocking and sneaked around to see how things were kept he knew better than to do so however he knew that when four hungry weasels were out hunting their supper it was an excellent time to keep still he was right and there are many times when it is better for angry people to keep still even if they are not afraid of being eaten after they had gone he came down it was lucky for me he said that i awakened hungry and ate a lunch if i hadnt been awake to run away theres no telling where i would be now there are some things worse than having people think you a poor housekeeper just as the chipmunk was finishing his lunch one of the weasels whispered to the others to stop there is somebody coming said he lets wait and see what he is doing it was the blacktailed skunk who came along slowly sniffing here and there and once in a while stopping to eat a few mouthfuls doesnt it seem to you that he acts very queerly said one of the weasels to the rest very replied another and he doesnt look quite as usual i dont know that i ever saw him carry his tail in just that way id like to know where he is going said another i guess he doesnt think anybody will see him lets follow him said the fourth weasel who had not spoken before while he was near them they hid behind a hemlock log out of which many tiny hemlocks were growing once in a while they peeped between the soft fringy leaves of these to see what he was doing they were much excited he is putting his nose down to the ground one would say it must be that he has found something then another would poke his little head up through the hemlocks and look at the skunk he couldnt have found anything after all he would say i cant hear him eating it is very strange the rest would murmur now it just happened that the blacktailed skunk had scented the weasels and knew that they were near he had also heard the rustling behind the hemlock log he knew what gossips weasels are and he guessed that they were watching him so he decided to give them something to think about he knew that they would often fight people larger than themselves but he was not afraid of anybody he did not care to fight them either for if he got near enough to really enjoy it they would be likely to bite him badly and when a weasel has set his teeth into anybody it is not easy to make him let go i rather think said he to himself that there will be four very tired young weasels sleeping in their burrows tomorrow hes walking away whispered one of the weasels where do you suppose he is going well have to find out said the others as they crept quietly out of their hidingplaces the skunk went exactly where he wanted to whenever he found food he ate it the weasels who followed after found nothing left for them they became very hungry but if one of them began to think of going off for a lunch the skunk was certain to do something queer sometimes he would lie down and laugh then the weasels would peep at him from a hidingplace and whisper together what do you suppose makes him laugh they would ask it must be that he is thinking of something wonderful which he is going to do we must not lose sight of him once he met the spotted skunk his brother and they whispered together for a few minutes then the spotted skunk laughed and as he passed on the blacktailed skunk called back to him be sure not to tell any one i do not want it known what i am doing then the four young weasels nudged each other and said there we knew it all the time after that nobody spoke
 about being hungry all they cared for was the following of the blacktailed skunk once when they were in the marsh they were so afraid of being seen that they slipped into the ditch and swam for a way they were good swimmers and didnt much mind but it just shows how they followed the skunk once he led them over to the farm and they remembered their plan of going to the henhouse they were very very hungry and each looked at the others to see what they thought about letting the skunk go and stopping for a hearty supper still nobody spoke of doing so one weasel whispered now we shall surely see what he is about he ought to know that he cannot do wrong or mischievous things without being found out and since we discover it ourselves we shall certainly feel free to speak of it collie the watchdog was sleeping lightly and came rushing around the corner of the house to see what strangers were there but when he saw who they were he dropped his tail and walked away he was old enough to know many things and he knew too much to fight either a skunk or a weasel every one lets skunks alone and it is well to let weasels alone also for although they are so small they bite badly now the blacktailed skunk turned to the forest and walked toward his hole the screechowl passed them flying homeward and several times bats darted over their heads when they went by the bats cave they could tell by the sound that ten or twelve were inside hanging themselves up for the day a dim light showed in the eastern sky and the day birds were stirring and beginning to preen their feathers what do you think it means whispered the weasels he seems to be going home do you suppose he has changed his mind when he reached his hole the blacktailed skunk stopped and looked around the weasels hid themselves under some fallen leaves i bid you goodmorning said the skunk looking toward the place where they were i hope you are not too tired this walk has been very easy for me but i fear it was rather long for weasels besides i have found plenty to eat and have chosen smooth paths for myself goodmorning i have enjoyed your company when even the tip of his tail was hidden in the hole the weasels crawled from under the leaves and looked at each other we believe he knew all the time that we were following him they said he acted queerly just to fool us the wretch yet after all you see he had done only what he did every night and it was because they were watching and talking about him that they thought him going on some strange errand when the days grew short and chilly and bleak winds blew out of the great bluegray cloud banks in the west many of the forest people went to sleep for the winter and not only they but over in the meadow the tree frog and the garter snake had already crawled out of sight and were dreaming sweetly the song birds had long before this started south and the banks of the pond and its bottom of comfortable soft mud held many sleepers under the water the frogs had snuggled down in groups out of sight some of the turtles were there also and some were in the bank the ground hogs had grown stupid and dozy before the last leaves fluttered to the ground and had been the first of the furbearers to go to bed for the winter there were so many interesting things to see and do in the late fall days that they tried exceedingly hard to keep awake a weasel was telling a ground hog something one dayand it was a very interesting piece of gossip only it was rather unkind and so might better not be told herewhen he saw the ground hog winking very slow and sleepy winks and letting his head droop lower and lower once he asked him if he understood the ground hog jumped and opened his eyes very wide indeed and said oh yes yes perfectly ohahahahahah his yawn didnt look so big as it sounds because his mouth was so small he tried to act politely interested but just as the weasel reached the most exciting part of his story the ground hog rolled over sound asleep the next day he said goodby to his friends wished them a happy winter and said he might see some of them before spring as he should come out once to make the weather i only hope i shall awaken in time he said but i am fat enough to sleep until the violets are up he had to be fat you know to last him through the cold weather without eating he was so stout that he could hardly waddle his big looseskinned body dragged when he walked and was even shakier than ever he really couldnt hurry by jumping and he was so short of breath that he could barely whistle when he went into his hole the raccoons went after the ground hog and the skunks were later still they never slept so very long and said they didnt really need to at all and wouldnt except that they had nothing to do and it made housekeeping easier it saved so much not to have to go out to their meals in the coldest weather when the large people were safely out of the way the smaller ones had their best times the muskrats were awake but they had their big houses to eat and were not likely to trouble mice and squirrels there was not much to fear except owls and weasels the ground hogs had once tried to get the great horned owl to go south when the cranes did and he had laughed in their faces towhoo said he not i im not afraid of cold weather you dont know how warm feathers are i never wear anything else furs are all right but they are not feathers he and his relatives sat all day in their holes and seldom flew out except at night sometimes when the day was not too bright they made short trips out for luncheon it was very unfortunate for any mouse to be near at those times now the snow had fallen and the beautiful still cold days had come the weasels fur had changed from brown to white as it does in cold countries in winter the chipmunks had taken their last scamper until early spring and were living each alone in their comfortable burrows they were most independent and thrifty no one ever heard of a chipmunk lacking food unless some robber had carried off his nuts and corn the mice think that it must be very dull for a chipmunk to stay by himself all winter since he does not sleep steadily the chipmunks do not find it so one of them said dull i never find it dull when i am awake i eat or clean my fur or think if i had any one staying with me he might rouse me when i want to sleep or pick the nut that i want for myself or talk when i am thinking no thank you i will go calling when i want company the mice make winter their playtime then the last summers babies are all grown up and able to look out for themselves and the fathers and mothers have a chance to rest the meadow mice come together in big parties and build groups of snug winter homes under the snow of the meadow with many tiny covered walks leading from one to another their food is all around themgrass roots and brown seedsand there is so much of it that they never quarrel to see who shall have this root and who shall have that they sleep during the daytime and awaken to eat and visit and have a good time at night sometimes they are awakened in the daytime as they were when the grouse broke through the snow near them that was an accident and the grouse felt very sorry about it they had snuggled down in a cozy family party near by and were just starting out for a stroll one morning when the eldest son stumbled and fell and crushed through the snow into the little settlement of meadow mice the young grouse was much ashamed of his awkwardness i am so sorry he said im not used to my snowshoes yet this is the first winter i have worn them that is all right said the oldest mouse politely it must be hard to manage them at first we hope you will have better luck after this then they bowed to each other and the grouse walked off to join his brothers and sisters lifting his feet with their newly grown feather snowshoes very high at every step the meadow mice went to work to make their homes neat again yet they never looked really right until that snow had melted and more had fallen one might think that the meadow mice and the grouse would care less for each other after that but it was not so it never is so if people who make trouble are quick to say that they are sorry and those who were hurt will keep patient and forgiving it was only the night after this happened that one of the deer mice had a great fright his home was in a bee tree in the forest the bees and he had always been the best of friends and now that they were keeping close to their honeycomb all winter the deer mouse had taken a small room in the same tree it helped to keep him warm when he slept close to the bees for there was always some heat coming from their bodies once in a while too he took a nibble of honey and they did not mind the deer mouse did not keep much of his own winter food where he lived he had a few beechnuts near by and when the weather was very stormy indeed he ate some of these there was room for many more in the storeroom another hole in the bee tree but he liked to keep food in many places it is wiser said he supposing i had them all here and this tree should be blown down and it should fall in such a way that i couldnt reach the hole what would i do then he was talking to a rabbit when he said this the rabbit never stored up food himself yet he sometimes told other people how he thought it should be done he was sure it would be better to have all the nuts in one place as the chipmunks did and now that the deer mouse had given his reasons he was just as sure as ever the bee tree is not very likely to blow down in that way said he there is not much danger not much but some answered the deer mouse hollow trees fall more quickly than solid ones you may store your food where you please and ill take care of mine the deer mouse spoke very decidedly although he was perfectly polite his beautiful brown eyes looked squarely at the rabbit
 and you could tell by the position of his slender long tail that he was much in earnest the rabbit went home the deer mouse put away hundreds and hundreds of beechnuts these he took carefully out of their shells and laid in nicely lined holes in treetrunks he used leaves for lining these places besides keeping food in the trees he hid little piles of nuts under stones and logs and tucked seeds into chinks of fences or tiny pockets in the ground he had worked in the wheatfield after the grain was cut picking up and carrying away the stray kernels which had fallen from the sheaves he never counted the places where food was stored but he was happy in thinking about them when he lay down to sleep in the morning he always knew where the next nights meals were coming from there was not a thriftier happier person in the forest he was gentle goodnatured and exceedingly businesslike he was also very handsome with large ears and white belly and feet the night after his cousins the meadow mice had been so frightened by the grouse this deer mouse started out for a good time he called on the meadow mice ate a chestnut which he dug up in the edge of the forest scampered up a fencepost and tasted of his hidden wheat to be sure that it was keeping well and then went to the tree where most of his beechnuts were stored he was not quite certain that he wanted to eat one but he wished to be sure that they were all right before he went on he had been invited to a party by some other deer mice and so you see it wouldnt do for him to spoil his appetite they would be sure to have refreshments at the party i suppose they are all right said he as he started to run up the tree still it is just as well to be sure my whiskers he exclaimed when he reached the hole if that isnt just like a red squirrel the opening into the tree had been barely large enough for him to squeeze through and now he could pass in without crushing his fur around the edge of it were many marks of sharp teeth somebody had wanted to get in and had not found the doorway large enough the deer mouse went inside and sat on his beechnuts then he thought and thought and thought he knew very well that it was a red squirrel for the red squirrels are not so thrifty as most of the nuteaters they make a great fuss about gathering food in the fall and frisk and chatter and scold if anybody else comes where they are busy for all that the chipmunks and the deer mice work much harder than they it is not always the person who makes the greatest fuss you know who does the most a red squirrel is usually out of food long before spring comes and after that he takes whatever he can lay his paws on sometimes the chipmunks tell them that they should be ashamed of themselves and work harder then the red squirrels sigh and answer oh that is all very well for you to say still you must remember that we have not such cheek pouches as you the deer mouse thought of these things cheek pouches cried he i have no cheek pouches but i lay up my own food it is only an excuse when they say that i dont think much of people who make excuses he passed through the doorway several times to see just how big it was he found it was not yet large enough for a red squirrel then he scampered over the snow to a friends home im not going to the party said he i have some work to do work said the friend work in winter but before he had finished speaking his caller had gone all night long the deer mouse carried beechnuts from the old hidingplace to a new one he wore quite a path in the snow between one tree and the other his feet were tiny but there were four of them and his long tail dragged after him it was not far that he had to go the new place was one which he had looked at before it was in a maple tree and had a long and very narrow opening leading to the storeroom it was having to go so far into the tree that had kept the deer mouse from using it before now he liked it all the better for having this if that red squirrel ever gnaws his way in here he said he wont have any teeth left for eating when the sun rose the deer mouse went to sleep in the maple tree the red squirrel came and gnawed at the opening into his old storeroom if he had gnawed all day he would surely have gotten in as it was he had to spend much time hunting for food he found some frozen apples still hanging in the orchard and bit away at them until he reached the seeds inside he found one large acorn but it was old and tasted musty he also squabbled with another red squirrel and chased him nearly to the farmyard then collie heard them and chased him most of the way back when night came and he ran off to sleep in his hollow tree he had made the hole almost but not quite large enough he could smell the beechnuts inside and it made him hungry to think how good they would taste i will get up early tomorrow morning and come here he said i can gnaw my way in before breakfast and then he went off in fine leaps to his home and was soon sound asleep in summer he often frolicked around half of the night but now it was cold and when the sun went down he liked to get home quickly and wrap up warmly in his tail the red squirrel was hardly out of sight when the deer mouse came along his path in the snow and up to his old storeroom his dainty white feet shook a little as he climbed and he hardly dared look in for fear of finding the hole empty you can guess how happy he was to find everything safe all night long he worked and when morning came it was a very tired little deer mouse who carried his last beechnut over the trodden path to its safe new resting place he was tired but he was happy there was just one other thing that he wanted to do he wanted to see that red squirrel when he found the beechnuts gone he waited near by for him to come it was a beautiful still winter morning when the hoarfrost clung to all the branches and the shadows which fell upon the snow looked fairly blue it was so cold the deer mouse crouched down upon his dainty feet to keep them warm and wrapped his tail carefully around to help along came the red squirrel dashing finely and not noticing the deer mouse at all a few leaps brought him to the tree a quick run took him to the hole and then he began to gnaw the deer mouse was growing sleepy and decided not to wait longer he ran along near the red squirrel oh goodmorning said he beautiful day i see you are getting that hole ready to use hope you will like it i liked it very well for a while but i began to fear it wasnt safe whwhat do you mean asked the red squirrel sternly he had seen the deer mouses eyes twinkle and he was afraid of a joke oh answered the deer mouse with a careless whisk of his tail i had some beechnuts there until i moved them you had exclaimed the red squirrel he did not gnaw any after that he suddenly became very friendly you couldnt tell me where to find food i suppose said he id eat almost anything the deer mouse thought for a minute i believe said he that you will find plenty in the farmers barn but you must look out for the dog thank you said the red squirrel i will go there said the deer mouse after he had whisked out of sight he has gone to steal from the farmer still men have so very much that they ought to share with squirrels and that you know is true the hawkmoths are acquainted with nearly everybody and are great society people they are invited to companies given by the daylight set and also to parties given at night by those who sleep during the day this is not because the hawkmoths are always awake oh dear no there is nobody in pond forest meadow marsh or even in houses who can be well and strong and happy without plenty of sleep the hawkmoths were awake more or less during the day but it was not until the sun was low in the western sky that they were busiest when every tree had a shadow two or three times as long as the tree itself then one heard the whirrr of wings and the hawkmoths darted past they staid up long after the daylight people went to bed the catbird who sang from the tip of the topmost maple tree branch long after most of his bird friends were asleep said that when he tucked his head under his wing the hawkmoths were still flying in that way of course they became acquainted with the people of the nighttime there was one fine large hawkmoth who used to be a tomato worm when he was young although he really fed as much upon potato vines as upon tomato plants he was handsome from the tip of his long slender suckingtongue to the tip of his trim gray body his wings were pointed and light gray in color with four blackish lines across the hind ones his body was also gray and over it and his wings were many dainty markings of black or very dark gray on the back part of it he had ten square yellow spots edged with black there were also twenty tiny white spots there but he did not care so much for them he always felt badly to think that his yellow spots showed so little that couldnt be helped of course and he should have been thankful to have them at all another thing which troubled him was the fact that he couldnt see his own yellow spots he would have given a great deal to do so he could see the yellow spots of other hawkmoths who had been tomato worms when he was but that was not like seeing his own he had tried and tried and it always ended in the same wayhis eyes were tired and his back ached his body was so much stouter and stiffer than that of his butterfly cousins that he could not bend it easily when he got to thinking about his yellow spots he often flew away to the farmers potatofields where the young tomato worms were feeding he would fly around them and cry out look at my yellow spots are they not fine then he would dart away to the vegetablegarden and balance himself in the air over the tomato plants the humming of his wings would make the tomato worms there look up and he would say if
 you are good little worms and eat a great deal you may some day become fine moths like me and have ten yellow spots apiece sometimes he even went down to the corner where the farmer had tobacco plants growing and showed his yellow spots to the tomato worms there he never went anywhere else for these worms do not care for other things to eat everywhere that he went the tomato worms exclaimed oh oh what beautiful yellow spots what wonderful yellow spots when he flew away they would not eat for a while but rested on their fat prolegs raised the front part of their bodies in the air folded their six little real legs under their chins and thought and thought and thought they always sat in that position when they were thinking and they had a great many cousins who did the same thing it was a habit which ran in the family when other people saw them sitting in this way with their real legs crossed under their chins they always cried look at the sphinxes although not one of them knew what a sphinx really was and that was just one of their habits this was why the hawkmoths were sometimes called sphinxmoths it was not kind in the hawkmoth to come and make the tomato worms discontented if he had stayed away they would have thought it the loveliest thing in the world to be fat green tomato worms with two sorts of legs and each with a horn standing up on the hind end of his body that is not the usual place for horns still it does very well and these horns are worn only for looks they are never used for poking or stinging before the hawkmoth came to visit them the tomato worms had thought it would be quiet and restful and pleasant to lie all winter in their shining brown pupacases in the ground waiting for the spring to finish turning them into moths now they were so impatient to get their yellow spots that they could hardly bear the idea of waiting they did not even care about the long slender tonguecase which every tomatoworm has on his pupacase and which looks like a handle to it one day the tomato worms told the rubythroated hummingbird about all this the hummingbird was a very sensible fellow and would no doubt have been a hardworking husband and father if his wife had not been so independent he had been a most devoted lover and helped build a charming nest of fernwool and plantdown and cover it with beautiful graygreen lichens when done it was about as large as half of a hens egg and a morningglory blossom would have more than covered it the lichens were just the color of the branch on which it rested and one could hardly see where it was that is the nicest thing to be said about a nest if a bird ever asks you what you think of his nest and you wish to say something particularly agreeable you must stare at the tree and ask where is it then when he has shown it to you you may speak of the soft lining or the fine weaving or the stout way in which it is fastened to the branches after this nest was finished and the two tiny white eggs laid in it mrs hummingbird cared for nothing else she would not go honeyhunting with her husband or play in the air with him as she used to do he tried to coax her by darting down toward her as she sat covering her eggs and by squeaking the sweetest things he could think of into her ear but she acted as though she cared more for the eggs than for him and did not even squeak sweet things back so of course he went away and let her hatch and bring up her children as she chose it was certainly her fault that he left her she might not have been able to leave the eggs but she could have squeaked now that the rubythroated hummingbird had no home cares he made many calls on his friends they were very short calls for he would seldom sit down yet he heard and told much news while he balanced himself in the air with his tiny feet curled up and his wings moving so fast that one could not see them when the tomato worms told him how they felt about the hawkmoths yellow spots he became very indignant those poor young worms he said to himself it is a shame and something must be done about it the more he thought the angrier he became and his feathers fairly stood on end he hardly knew what he was doing and ran his long slender bill into the same flowers several times although he had taken all the honey from them at first that night when the sun had set and the silvery moon was peeping above a violetcolored cloud in the eastern sky the rubythroated hummingbird sat on the tip of a sprucetree branch and waited for the hawkmoth i hope nobody else will hear me talking said he it would sound so silly if i were overheard he sat very still his tiny feet clutching the branch tightly it was late twilight now and really time that he should go to sleep but he had decided that if he could possibly keep awake he would teach the hawkmoth a lesson i wish he would hurry said he i can hardly keep my eyes open he did not yawn because he had not the right kind of mouth for it you know a yawn ought to be nearly round his beak would have made one a great great many times higher than it was wide and that would have been exceedingly unbecoming to him yellow evening primroses grew near the sprucetree and the tall stalks were opening their flowers for the night above the seedpods and below the buds on each stalk two three or four blossoms were slowly unfolding the rubythroated hummingbird did not often stay up long enough to see this and he watched the four smooth yellow petals of one untwist themselves until they were free to spring wide open he had watched five blossoms when he heard the hawkmoth coming then he darted toward the primroses and balanced himself daintily before one while he sucked honey from it whirrrr the hawkmoth was there good evening said he rather late for you isnt it it is a little answered the hummingbird growing a bit chilly too isnt it i should think youd be cold without feathers mine are such a comfort feel as good as they look and that is saying a great deal the hawkmoth balanced himself before another primrose and seemed to care more about sucking honey up his long tonguetube than he did about talking i think it is a great thing to have a touch of bright color too said the hummingbird the beautiful red spot on my throat looks particularly warm and becoming when the weather is cool you ought to have something of the sort i have yellow spotsten of them answered the hawkmoth sulkily you have exclaimed the hummingbird in the most surprised way oh yes i think i do remember something about them it is a pity they dont show more mrs hummingbird never wears bright colors she says it would not do people would see her on her nest if she did excepting the red spot she is dressed like mewhite breast green back and head and black wings and tail green is another good color you should wear some green the hawkmoth murmured that he didnt see any particular use in wearing green oh said the hummingbird it is just the thing to wearneat never looks dusty here the hawkmoth drew back for his own wings you know were almost dust color and matches the leaves perfectly the hawkmoth said something about having to go and thinking that the primrose honey was not so good as usual i thought it excellent said the hummingbird perhaps you do not get it so easily as i ah yes you use a tonguetube what different ways different people do have now i like honey but i could not live many days on that alone what i care most for is the tiny insects that i find eating it and you cannot eat meat what a pity i must say that you seem to make the best of it though and do fairly well oh must you go well good night the hawkmoth flew away feeling very much disgusted he had always thought himself the most beautiful person in the neighborhood he rather thought so still yet it troubled him to know that others did not think so and he began to remember how many times he had heard people admire the rubythroated hummingbird he never liked him after that but neither did he brag the young tomato worms soon forgot what the hawkmoth had said to them and became happy and contented once more the rubythroated hummingbird never cared to talk about it yet he was once heard to say that he would rather offend the hawkmoth and even make him a little unhappy than to have him bothering the poor little tomato worms all the time

A WORD TO THE CHILDREN


DEAR CHILDREN,--The very best way to know the insects is to go
and watch them. Watch them whenever you can, and each time you will find
out something new. Books will help you, but you must watch, too. Look
more than you read.

If you need to catch them, put them under a tumbler, and feed them and
give them a drop of water every day to drink. Slip a card under the rim
of the tumbler on one side so as to let in the air. If you do not know
what to feed them, or if they will not eat, let them go after a day or
two.

If you wish to kill an injurious insect, do it _quickly and completely_.
Remember the insects are alive, and we should not make them suffer
unnecessarily.

Of course you must try to make your captives feel at home. If they live
in the sand, put sand in the tumbler and tie a piece of netting over the
top so they cannot escape.

If they live in the water, put them in a tumbler of water. And when you
have secured your captives, watch them as much as you can.

If you do not know how to pronounce the words in this book, study the
glossary at the back and it will help you.

I hope you will have a very happy time getting acquainted with your
little insect neighbors.

Come, children; come with me.

Come to a pond I know of.

See how the water shines in the sun.

Over there is an old log lying on the edge of the pond.

It is covered with green moss, and a green frog is sitting on one end of
it.

Let us go and sit on the other end.

Goop! he says, and--plump! he has jumped into the water.

That is too bad, frog; we did not mean to disturb you.

How pretty it is here!

See the pickerel weed growing out in the water with its arrow-shaped
leaves, and its spikes of purple flowers.

See, down in the water are little fish, and very likely pollywogs are
there too, and lots of queer little things.

But who is this darting over the pond?

Ah, we know you.

You are our queer little, dear little old dragon fly.

Look, children; see the dragon flies darting about like flashes of light
in every direction.

They are having such a good time.

Whizz! One flashed right past Mollie's ear.

   

Pretty people, I wish one of you would come and sit by us a little
while, so we could get a good look at you.

What is that, Ned? You have found a large one lying on the ground?

Sure enough; it is a beauty too, with a green body and silver wings.

Something seems to be wrong with it; it does not fly nor try to get
away.

What a big one it is!

My! my! what eyes!

Don't crowd, Amy; let little Nell see too.

What is that you say, Richard? "It catches mosquitoes and gnats and
flies and other insects while flying."

Yes, and that is why it has such big eyes. We should need big eyes
ourselves if we were to spend our time chasing mosquitoes.

Two eyes you have, little dragon fly, like the rest of us, but your eyes
are not like ours.

No, indeed!

Each of your big eyes is made up of a great many small eyes packed close
together.

Do you know, children, that some of the largest of the dragon flies have
as many as twenty thousand facets, or small eyes, in each large eye?

Think of it! Forty thousand eyes in one little dragon fly head. It
_ought_ to see well.

These facets are six-sided, excepting those along the edge, which are
rounded on the outside. You cannot see their real shape without a
microscope, they are so small. But here is a picture of some facets as
they look under the microscope.

   

Eyes like these, made up of many facets, we call compound eyes.

All grown-up insects have compound eyes, though not many have as large
ones as the dragon fly.

Only insects that chase other insects or that need to see in the dark
have very large eyes.

See what a big mouth the dragon fly has. Its jaws do not show unless it
opens its lower lip, which fits over its mouth like a mask.

I should not care to have it bite my finger.

It could not hurt very much, and its bite is not poisonous, still I
shall handle it carefully.

Some call the dragon fly a darning needle, and say it sews up people's
ears when they lie on the grass. This is not true. It does not sew up
anything. It has nothing to sew with.

   

Why should it want to sew up people's ears, anyway?

It does nothing unpleasant but bite fingers, and it never goes out of
its way to do that.

If we let it alone, it always lets us alone.

It is our good friend because it catches mosquitoes. For this reason it
is sometimes called mosquito hawk.

We should never kill a dragon fly.

Sometimes it is called a spindle, I suppose because it is long and
slender like a spindle.

Down South the colored people believe the dragon fly brings dead snakes
to life, and they call it snake doctor.

In some places it is called snake feeder.

But it has nothing to do with snakes, dead or alive.

The French have given it a pretty name, _demoiselle_, or damsel fly, and
that is quite deserved, for the dragon fly is a graceful little
creature, as pretty as pretty can be.

   

See, sticking out of the front of its head are two little feelers, or
antennæ, as we must call them.

They are very short, but it does not need long ones.

Insects smell with their feelers, you know, but our dragon flies see so
well they do not need to smell very well, I suppose.

See how it can turn its head around. That is because it has a little
short neck between its head and its body.

Its eyes, its mouth, and its antennæ belong to its head.

Of course our demoiselle can fly well; one need only look at those wings
to know that.

To fly well is quite as necessary to one of its habits as to see well.

What would be the use of seeing an insect if it could not fly fast
enough to catch it?

We all like your pretty wings, little dragon fly; they look like glass
and they shine so in the sun.

How fast the wings can move! See that dragon fly skimming over the pond;
its wings make a whizzing sound as it darts about.

   

Why does it zigzag so?

Why doesn't it fly in a straight line?

Yes, Mollie, you are right, it goes zigzagging along after insects.

It sees one it wants off at one side--whizz! around it turns after it.

Shouldn't you like to fly like that, children?

And yet we would not be willing to exchange our arms and hands for
wings.

We could not whittle a stick nor write a letter if we had only wings.

In fact we could not do most of the things we now do.

I am glad I have my hands.

We are glad, too, that the dragon flies have their pretty, swift wings.

They have four wings, all nearly the same size and shape, you see, and
they are all stiff and shining.

Some dragon flies, like this one we have picked up, always keep their
wings spread out.

   

But over there, standing on the end of that stick, is another kind.

When it rests its wings are folded together.

What a pretty one it is! Do you see it?

It is small, but so pretty.

It is bright blue and shines as though it had been polished.

Sometimes birds catch these smaller dragon flies, though birds, as a
rule, are not fond of any of them.

They are so hard and their wings are so stiff I should think a bird
might almost as well swallow nails.

I am sure no bird could swallow one of the big ones, wings and all!

But frogs can.

A frog will try to swallow almost anything it can catch, and it watches
for the dragon flies when they come to lay their eggs in the water.

Suddenly it jumps out, and away goes poor dragon fly into that great
wide frog-mouth.

   

Now look at the legs of the dragon fly. It has six.

Every dragon fly has six legs.

They are rather short and small for so large an insect, but that is
because it does not need large, strong legs.

You never saw a dragon fly dig a hole, or run, or even walk, did you?

Their legs are not arranged for walking. All six of them are directed
forwards as though they were reaching out after something. And so they
are--reaching out after insects.

Dragon fly catches his prey while he is flying, and he grasps the
insects with his feet.

He snatches one, and then what?

Does he sit down somewhere and eat it?

Not he, he is far too hungry for that; he continues his swift flight,
and as he flies he eats.

As soon as he has finished one fly or gnat, zip! he snatches another.

He has an insatiable appetite, consuming hundreds of insects in the
course of a day. Nor does he confine his attention to flies and gnats
and mosquitoes and such small fry. He catches what he can. A large
dragon fly will even gorge himself on one of the large-sized
butterflies, and one has been seen calmly chewing away at an enormous
wasp!

No, indeed, Mabel, the dragon fly does not eat the wings of the
butterfly, it eats only the soft body.

Probably nothing eats a butterfly, wings and all. Birds and insects
sometimes catch butterflies, and you often see the bright wings lying on
the ground. The wings of insects are not worth eating, and are almost
always cast aside by the creatures that eat the insects.

Besides catching insects with their legs, the dragon flies cling fast to
things with them, but when they wish to move they do not walk, they fly.

Yes, indeed, Frank, you are right; their legs are jointed.

That is so they can move them easily and fold them up when they want
to.

They would find it as hard to get along without joints to their legs as
we should.

Wouldn't we be stiff if we had no joints!

See, the legs and wings are fastened to the middle part of the body, the
_thorax_, we call it.

All insects have the legs and wings attached to the thorax.

The rest of the body is the abdomen. See how long it is.

   

It is the long abdomen that gives the dragon fly its name of spindle, I
suppose.

The abdomen is jointed, and it can curl up.

All grown-up insects have a head, a thorax, and a jointed abdomen.


What are you looking at, Charlie?

Something moving in the bottom of the pond?

Let us get it out.

Here, we will dip it out with this cup.

What a lot of stuff!

Sticks and mud--and--what is that?

Something alive, surely.

Let us put some clean water in the cup and examine what we have found.

My! my! what a queer little thing!

What do you suppose it is?

Ah, I know now, but I do not think you could ever, ever guess, not if
you tried a week.

It is a young dragon fly!

It does not look much like its shiny-winged parents.

It looks like I don't know what, with a face like--well, when you look
right in front of it, like a pug dog.

Queer! Well, I should think so! What is that, Amy? Am I sure it is a
dragon fly?

Yes, there is no mistake; a dragon fly one day dropped an egg in the
pond, and out of it hatched--this.

   

It will some day become a shiny-winged dragon fly and catch mosquitoes.

We will call it larva, and we will watch it a little while.

Look and see if it has a head, a thorax, and an abdomen.

Are there antennæ on its head? And has it eyes?

If you were to look at its eyes with a microscope, you would find that
they are made of six-sided facets, like the eyes of the grown-up dragon
fly.

They are compound eyes, but they are not as large as the eyes of the
grown-up dragon fly.

How many legs has it? What are its legs fastened to?

Yes, Nellie, thorax is right.

Its six legs are fastened to its thorax. I am glad you remembered
thorax.

Has it a jointed abdomen? and has it wings?

Look! did you see that?

It opened its innocent-looking face all of a sudden, just darted it out
into a long-handled spoon, with hooks at the end, and hooked up that
little grub.

Now it is holding the grub on the hooks in front of its mouth and eating
it as greedily as if it were half starved.

   

So that is why its face looks so queer.

It is its long under lip all folded up in front like a mask that makes
it look like a pug dog.

When it pleases it darts out that lip, and any unlucky insect or snail
may fall a prey to its greedy appetite.

It is said that the larvæ of some dragon flies even eat pollywogs and
small fishes.

Ned wants to know if "larvæ" means the same as "larva."

Yes, it is the plural form of the word. When we speak of only one we say
"larva"; when we speak of more than one, instead of saying "larvas," we
say "larvæ."

The dragon fly larvæ are terrible gluttons, and hidden under the mask
are strong jaws for chewing up their prey.

Their legs are quite large and strong, too, for they crawl about the
bottom of the pond or up the stalks of the plants.

They do not move about very fast, but they do shoot out that under lip
very, very, _very_ fast indeed, so good-by to any little live thing in
the pond that comes within reach of it.

The dragon fly larvæ do not all look alike. They are different in the
different species of dragon flies, and, like the rest of us, they change
as they grow older.

Yes, May, you can keep the dragon fly larvæ until they change into
dragon flies.

You must supply them with fresh water and with enough to eat.

And you must put a net over the bowl or aquarium in which you keep them,
otherwise as soon as they are able they will fly away.

How can they fly without wings?

Oh, but they are going to have wings. You know they are young dragon
flies in spite of their strange appearance.

Be sure and feed them enough, or else they will eat each other, and that
would be a pity; and be sure there are some water plants for them to
hide under and crawl upon.

You can give them a little fresh fish or a tiny bit of very fresh meat,
though they like best the living things they find in the bottom of the
pond.

   

When the dragon fly larva first hatches it is very small and its legs
are rather long and spidery, but it eats and eats and eats,--my, how it
eats!

And it grows and grows, and one day it finds its skin too tight.

A tight skin must be rather uncomfortable.

But the larva does not care much for its skin.

It merely splits it open down the back and pulls itself out.

Perhaps you think it must be yet more uncomfortable to be without a
skin.

But it is not without a skin. It is covered by a new and soft one that
soon hardens, and that is larger than the old one.

It wriggles out of its old skin as though it were an old coat, and
leaves it clinging to the weeds in the pond.

Sometime you may find these cast-off dragon fly overcoats.

After it has shed its skin the dragon fly continues to grow. It keeps on
growing until it has outgrown its new skin.

Then what do you think it does?

Yes, Charlie, that is right, it sheds this skin too.

   

When it sheds its skin we say it moults.

It moults several times, and at last little short wings appear. At first
it has no wings at all, you know.

Amy wonders how the larva breathes under water.

Ah, Master Ned, you are laughing too soon. You think insects do not have
to breathe, but you are very much mistaken, sir.

Insects do have to breathe.

They would die if they could get no air to breathe.

Some of the dragon fly larvæ have an odd arrangement for breathing under
water. They have a sort of syringe in the end of the body, and there are
breathing pores or gills in the syringe.

The water goes in and out of this syringe, and the larva breathes as the
fish does, by means of its gills.

Yes, May, its gills are in its syringe, which seems very odd,--you see
the dragon fly larva breathes at its tail end instead of at its head
end.

Mollie thinks it is an upside-down, inside-out sort of a creature
anyway. But it knows what it is about.

Ned wants to know how it can get any air to breathe when it lives under
water.

The truth is, there is always air mixed in with water, and it is this
air the larva breathes when the water goes in and out of the syringe.

It uses the syringe for another purpose too. When it pleases it can
shoot out the water with great force, and thus propel itself quite a
distance.

By means of the syringe it can leap through the water faster than it can
move by its slow-going legs.

Mollie wants to know if we can see the syringe.

No, it is inside the body.

But there is a kind of dragon fly that has a pair of gills outside, at
the end of the abdomen, instead of the syringe inside.

The best I can do is to show you a picture of one. Some day we may find
it in the pond.

   

Those two feather-like parts at the tail end are gills.

Yes, John, it can propel itself through the water by rowing, as it were,
with these gills.

There are some species of dragon fly larvæ that swim by moving the tip
of the abdomen from side to side, as a fish moves its body when it
swims.

But now let us return to our funny larva that lives at the bottom of the
pond. It stays down there, eating and growing and moulting, for nine or
ten months or even longer; then something very wonderful happens.

It suddenly feels a great desire to get up to the top of the pond.

   

It climbs up a weed or a stick until it is clear out of the water.

Then its skin splits down the back for the last time, and out there
pulls itself, not a larva, but a weak-looking dragon fly, with soft and
flabby little wings.

Now is its hour of danger, and now is the time for such birds as like
the taste of young dragon flies to help themselves.

Catbirds seem to have a special fondness for these helpless insects, and
have been known to eat them before the flabby little wings had grown
stiff.

If the birds do not find the newly emerged dragon fly, it remains
motionless an hour or so, but it does not remain unchanged.

Its wings stretch out and harden.

Bright metallic colors begin to play over them and over its body; and
all at once--off it darts, away and away, glittering in the sunshine, a
swift, beautiful winged creature.

Towards the end of summer you will often see dragon flies darting about
in every direction.

They seem to come in swarms and I think they usually come where there
are ponds or marshes, for in such places there are many gnats and
mosquitoes.

Mollie wants to know why it would not be a good plan for people who live
where there are many mosquitoes to raise dragon flies?

That is a very sensible idea, Mollie, and it has been tried.

Yes, indeed; some men once collected dragon fly larvæ, and took care of
them until they changed into dragon flies.

Then what do you think happened?

As soon as they got their wings, away went those dragon flies,--away
and away, without stopping to catch a single mosquito for the men who
had taken the trouble to raise them.

The dragon flies will not stay at home.

They fly so fast and so far there is no use raising them.

They are among the swiftest and strongest of insects.

How do the larvæ get in the ponds? Frank is asking.

I will tell you what I know about it.

   

The winged dragon flies mate, and the female then drops her eggs in the
water or lays them on twigs in the water, where they hatch out into
larvæ.

The dragon flies have to be very careful when they go close to the water
to lay their eggs.

You all know why.

Yes, it is because the frogs are on the watch to catch them.

   

The mother dragon fly knows the larvæ have to live in the water, and so
she takes pains to put the eggs there; sometimes she even crawls down
under the water on stems of plants to lay her eggs. Isn't she a wise
little mother?

There are a good many species of dragon flies.

Some are large and some are small.

Some are bright and some are dull.

There are black ones and bright blue ones, or green ones with blue eyes.

Some are marked with red and yellow.

They are a very gay family.

The dragon fly family is also a very old one.

Indeed, it is one of the oldest families on earth.

Long before there were bees or butterflies or dogs or horses or human
beings, there were dragon flies.

Don't you suppose that may be why the dragon fly is such a
strange-looking insect?

It does not look like other insects; it is very old-fashioned, like the
pine trees.

Pine trees, too, belong to a very old plant family that lived long ago,
before there were oaks or maples, or other trees that shed their leaves.

Now we must go home.

Good-by, green frog, you may come back to your log now.

Good-by, pretty dragon fly people, we shall never forget you.

Good-by, pleasant pond and moss-grown log, we hope to see you often
again.

   

Come, children, and see! Hundreds and hundreds of them are dancing
about.

What are they? Yes, May, they do make us think of the dragon flies, but
they are like fairy demoiselles.

They are the May flies, fairy ships sailing in the sea of air.

See how they are tossed about.

Many have fallen to the ground, which is covered with them.

They live but a day, or sometimes only a few hours, and so they are
called day flies, and also ephemeræ, which means short-lived.

They have eyes, as you can see, little round eyes, but their mouth is so
tiny they cannot eat.

Strange little beings to come into the world so helpless!

How different from the strong, fierce dragon flies!

See their dainty little legs. Six, you see, and legs and wings grow out
from the thorax.

Have they an abdomen?

See the long threads at the end of it, they look like slender tails. How
they spread these threads out as they fly!

They have four wings, but the wings are not shaped like those of the
dragon fly, and they are very much more delicate.

 

Yes, May, I agree with you, they look like fine lace.

The fore wings, you see, are larger than the hind ones.

Richard asks, "Where do May flies come from? and why are they called May
flies?"

Now, Richard, one question at a time, if you please, and the last shall
come first because it is easier to answer.

They are called May flies because they often come out in the month of
May, though sometimes not until June, and some species are as late as
July in appearing.

   

We shall have to look into the ponds and little streams to discover
where they come from.

See, John has scooped up some little speckled grubs out of the mud. Is
it possible that _they_ are the larvæ of our fairy May flies? _They_
have a mouth!--see what big jaws for such little creatures.

And what do you suppose they eat?

No doubt they, too, live on animal food.

No doubt they move about in the mud and catch what they can.

You see, John had to dig them up; they like to burrow in the weeds and
mud, and some of them even make tunnels of mud in which to protect their
soft bodies. Their short, stout legs enable them to dig well.

Their bodies are soft, but their jaws are not. O dear, no!

   

The grown-up May flies mate, and then the female drops her eggs on the
surface of the water. When she does this a fish will very often jump up
and seize her, for fish are very fond of May flies, and lucky are the
May flies to escape these ravenous enemies.

The eggs are heavy and sink to the bottom, where they hatch into these
queer-looking larvæ that eat and grow and shed their skin just like the
dragon fly larvæ.

Those brushes along their sides are the gills they breathe with.

See the gills moving swiftly back and forth; they look as though the
larva wished to swim with them, but this is not why it moves them so
constantly.

The continual motion of the gills stirs up the water and keeps our larva
supplied with fresh air.

Nellie is asking what gills are.

Well, gills in fishes and in such insects as have gills, and in crabs
and lobsters and other creatures that live in the water, are parts that
often look like fringes or flat plates.

The gills of fishes have a great many blood vessels running through
them. The walls of these blood vessels are very thin, and the oxygen
from the air that is in the water passes into the blood that is in the
gills, and then this blood, all full of oxygen, circulates through the
fish's body.

You see in fishes the blood vessels come into the gills and get the
oxygen.

In insects it is different. There are air tubes running like tiny pipes
all through the gills and into the body of the insect. The oxygen of the
air that is in the water passes out through the walls of these tubes
into the blood of the insect.

Yes, John, in fishes the blood comes to the air, in insects the air goes
to the blood. The air passes into the air tubes of the insects, and thus
is carried all through their bodies.

The blood takes the oxygen out of the air.

Without oxygen in the blood no animal could live.

Now let us go back to our May flies. They remain in the larval state a
year, and some species remain two years. Think of living in the mud for
two long years!

In the mud they creep about, eating, eating, eating. Then some summer
day they leave the mud and swim to the surface of the water.

Pop! they are gone.

They were so quick about it we could not see what happened.

The larval skin burst open and forth leaped the May fly, like a winged
fairy from a prison cell.

They do not come out slowly and wait for their wings to dry like the
dragon fly.

   

They spring out all of a sudden and fly away, leaving their cast-off
skin in the pond.

Unless their motions were quick they might be snapped up by the fish
that are so fond of them.

But though they seem to emerge thus quickly into perfect winged May
flies, they are not quite done with infancy. They are still wrapped
about by a very delicate skin that they have to get rid of. So they fly
to a bush near the water and stay a little while until this skin splits
and comes off, and they are free.

In spite of their quick motions when they spring from the water, many of
the May flies fall back into it and are caught by the fish.

   here, as the text is broken 

It is said that the trout become fat and good-flavored when the May
flies emerge, they eat so many of them. And what the fish do not catch
the birds try to. Swallows and other insect-loving birds have a glorious
feast when the May flies come out. For a season they live in the midst
of more delicacies than they can possibly use.

Fish like the May fly larvæ, too, which is probably the reason the larvæ
have learned to live in the mud, out of reach.

Fishermen dig up the larvæ for bait, so you see the May flies have a
hard time to get safely through the world.

But in spite of difficulties a great many of them live, and some summer
day out they come trooping.

They spring all at once from the surface of the water as by magic,
hundreds and thousands, yes, millions of them. They fill the air, they
cover everything.

The great naturalist Swammerdam, who was the first to make a thorough
study of the May flies, thus tells us how they appeared in France one
year:--

"I then saw a sight beyond all expectation. The ephemeræ filled the air
like the snowflakes in a dense snowstorm.

"The steps were covered to a depth of two, three, or even four inches. A
tract of water five or six feet across was completely hidden, and as the
floating insects slowly drifted away, others took their places. Several
times I was obliged to retreat to the top of the stairs from the
annoyance caused by the ephemeræ, which dashed in my face, and got into
my eyes, mouth, and nose."

These swarms of May flies appear only from three to five days at a
time.

Wherever there are streams there are May flies, and the canals of
Holland make good breeding places for them; no wonder, then, the Dutch,
who you know live in Holland, have a saying, "As thick as May flies."

Although so many of the May flies perish at once, multitudes of them
drop their eggs into the water to renew the race of May flies.

Is it not wonderful that after so long a period of creeping about in the
mud as larvæ, these graceful and beautiful little creatures have but a
few hours in which to dance joyously about in the upper air on wings of
gossamer? Some, indeed, live less than an hour, and some, that come out
in the evening, finish their dance of life and perish before sunrise,
without ever having seen the beautiful daylight.

Yes, strange little beings are they.

They do us no harm and we should not kill them.

Let them live their short lives and be happy.




John has been fishing.

What do you think he caught?

Nary fish, my dears, but a goodly number of stone flies, which he has
brought to show us.

Yes, Mollie, they do remind us a very little of our May flies, only, of
course, they are many times larger.

It is rather a clumsy creature in spite of its large wings, and John
says he had no trouble whatever in catching it.

See, it has four wings, and the hind ones are the larger.

Yes, May, they fold up in plaits, like the sticks of a fan.

See its long antennæ and its compound eyes. Its eyes are not so large as
are those of the dragon fly. It does not spend its time pursuing other
insects, but is more like the May fly after it gets its wings.

Yes, Ned, it lives longer than the May fly, but it does not live very
long, and it eats little.

It is a pretty little gray thing as it rests on the side of John's box,
with its wings folded like a gossamer cloak over its body.

   

It lays its eggs in the water, and out of them hatch little six-legged
larvæ that are not troubled by want of appetite. If the winged stone fly
does not eat, its larva does; it is like the other larvæ we know, always
devouring something.

   

Yes, Charlie, it feeds on living creatures, greatly relishing the larvæ
of the May flies, or any other luckless insect infants it can capture.

It grows fast and moults several times, and when winter comes it hides
away, only to come forth at the first breath of spring and continue its
eating.

Like other larvæ that live under water, it does its breathing by means
of gills, and these gills are in little tufts just above the base of
each leg.

It lives under stones, which is why it is called the stone fly, and it
slides quickly around a corner when you lift up its stone.

Fish are very fond of it, and hunt it as eagerly as it hunts larvæ.
Since it makes good bait for brook trout, its life is always in danger.
It finishes its growth in early summer, and emerges from its larval
skin as a perfect winged insect.

Yes, indeed, John, you can often find dozens of the cast-off skins of
the stone flies along the brook sides in the month of June.

The stone flies are harmless little people, and we should never kill one
needlessly.

   

May has something here for us to look at. She says it is a slippery
rascal. Let us see it. Oh, yes, you have it in that little box. See, the
box has a glass top. May cut the top off the box herself, and fastened
in a little pane of glass so we could see the rascal without danger of
its escaping.

   

Pretty rascal! Like a little silver fish slipping about the box.

Yes, Charlie, it is called the silver fish. A land fish? Why, yes, it
would be a land fish if it were a fish at all. But in spite of its name
it is no fish. It is covered with shining scales, though, that are very
much like fish scales, and it is shaped a good deal like a fish.

Oh, yes, it is an insect. You see it has six legs. But it has no wings.

No, it is not a young one.

It never will have any wings, no matter how old it may get to be.

It is flat, you see, and its scales make it very slippery, so that it is
hard to catch and yet harder to hold on to after you have caught it. It
goes flashing about like a little silver dart, and it loves to eat
starch.

That is why May calls it a rascal. It eats the starch from the paste
that fastens on her wall paper, and from book-bindings, so you see it
makes things fall to pieces. But my! what a pretty rascal it is! Besides
its name of silver fish, it is also called fish moth, though it is not a
moth at all. It is also called bristle-tail, because of the long,
bristle-like parts at the end of its body; and in some places it is
called a slink, because, you know, it loves dark places, and when you
uncover it in the daytime, it slips around a corner into the dark again.

Yes, it seems to slink about as if it were ashamed of itself, but it is
not ashamed; it does not like the light, and it does not like us to see
it.

Perhaps it is afraid of us.






Children, here is a cockroach.

It was one of the first insects that came to live on the earth;
cockroaches were here before people, and they are here yet.

You do not think it is pretty?

Neither do I.

I don't know anybody who thinks a cockroach pretty.

Oh, no, it won't bite you.

It will only get into your pantry and eat your food.

It will walk around in the night and frighten you if you go suddenly
into the kitchen.

It will not frighten you on purpose, but when it hears you coming, it
will run, and then maybe you will scream and run too.

What is that, May? You've a good mind to scream and run as it is?

Very well, scream and run if you want to; the cockroach won't care.

We do not often see these big black fellows in the North, but sometimes
we do. Down South cockroaches seem to be everywhere.

What, May? You are never going South, then?

Well, you do not need to go; the cockroaches won't care.

They have little heads and long antennæ, like threads.

What is that, May? You don't care anything about their heads? You don't
want to know anything about cockroaches?

Oh, yes, you want to know about cockroaches. Remember how old they are.

They have six legs, you see.

You don't care how many legs they have?

Oh, yes, you do. They could not walk if they had no legs.

You wish they couldn't walk?

Dear me, May; you don't seem to like cockroaches.

Poor old cockroaches.

   

Think how old they are.

What is that you say? They are old enough to know better?

Why, May, what have they ever done to you?

Nothing, only you don't like them?

Well, well, they don't like you, either. Poor old cockroaches; nobody
seems to like them.

Perhaps they don't care.

Will you let me tell you where they came from?

They do not belong to this country.

Their natural home is tropical Asia.

You see, about four hundred years ago, the ships that bore fruits and
other merchandise from India and other warm countries in Asia, bore, as
well, a number of little, flat, reddish brown stowaways.

   

Stowaways, as you know, are people that do not buy their tickets, but
that hide among the ship's cargo, and so get free transportation to
other countries.

Well, these little flat stowaways were not human beings, they were
insects. Yes, May, they were the cockroaches.

When they landed from their hot land of Asia in cold England, they must
have wondered what was to become of them. Many of them no doubt died,
for they cannot stand cold weather at all; but some of them were
carried, with the fruits and other things, quite unintentionally, of
course, for nobody guessed they were there, into warm cellars and
kitchen cupboards.

_Then_ they felt at home!

They knew better than to leave the cosey nooks where they could hide
away and sleep all day, and when they came out at night would find a
delicious supper close at hand.

They are great eaters, you know, so what with the good things in the
pantry and the warmth of the kitchen quarters they prospered wherever
they could find a kitchen to live in.

Soon they spread all over the large cities of England and finally into
even remote country districts.

Of course they found their way to the United States of America, and in
many houses in the North they have taken lodging. But down South, where
it is always warm enough, they have prospered greatly, and they are
there in far greater numbers than in the North.

Besides, there is a large American cockroach that belongs to tropical
America, but that has found its way pretty well over the country. And
there are cockroaches that live in the woods, some of them coming in the
night to visit our houses and help themselves from our pantries.

Yes, Mollie, the cockroaches eat almost anything they can find, and what
they do not eat they spoil by an ill-smelling liquid they give out when
disturbed.

It is this liquid that makes the cockroaches so very offensive to us.
We cannot bear to touch one because of it.

Cockroaches eat one variety of food that nobody objects to their having.
They are fond of bed bugs and greedily devour them.

Besides the large, dark, reddish brown cockroaches there is a little
tan-colored fellow that is often very troublesome.

   

It is not a native of this country, but is supposed to have been brought
to England by soldiers from the Crimea, and later it found its way to
America.

We call it the croton bug, but it is not a bug at all, it is a
cockroach.

It is particularly numerous about water pipes, and, like the rest of the
cockroaches, it hides in the daytime.

At night out troop crowds and crowds of the little tan-colored water
bugs. They run about the floor, and over the pantry shelves. They get
into everything they can find, and have a beautiful time.

They are funny little fellows, and if they were not so troublesome, we
might admire them.

How they can run!

All the cockroaches run very fast, so that it is hard to catch one. And
they are hard and smooth, too, which makes it yet more difficult to
catch them. They are well made to escape their enemies, and they are so
flat they can hide in cracks or almost anywhere.

No, May, they do not fly very much. You see this one has short wings. It
is a male cockroach. The female of this species of cockroach has no
wings at all, only little hints of wings, as it were.

Such little useless wings we call "rudimentary" wings.

John says he thinks that is a long word for short wings.

Yes, but it is not a hard word,--ru-di-ment-ary, see if you can remember
it.

The croton bugs have longer wings and they sometimes fly.

If you were to spread out the wings of a cockroach, you would find it
had four.

What is that, May? You wouldn't spread them out for anything?

Yet wise men have been very much interested in our poor, ill-smelling
old cockroaches, and have studied carefully all about them.

   

If you dislike to touch the cockroach so much, perhaps you will look at
this picture of a croton bug.

See, the upper wings are different; the cockroach does not fly with
them, he merely uses them to cover up the under wings, and we call them
wing covers.

It is the under wings the cockroach flies with.

Cockroaches may not be pleasant, but who can say they are not
interesting?

What other insect lays its eggs in little bandboxes?

Here is one of the little boxes, shiny and hard.

   

This little case is at first a sticky substance that soon hardens. The
eggs lie in it side by side in two rows.

These cases remain attached to the abdomen of the female cockroach until
the eggs are all laid. Then the case falls off, and soon out runs a
crowd of infant cockroaches.

   

The case is something like a satchel that shuts with a spring. The
youngsters are packed close together, side by side, with their heads
towards the mouth of the satchel.

As soon as one hatches it pushes open the side of the case and creeps
out. Then the case springs together again to protect the rest of the
brood.

They are funny fellows when they first come out, little and
white-looking. But they eat and grow of course, and shed their skins,
and after each moult they become darker in color.

Now, do look again at this cockroach I have taken such pains to catch
for you and put into the tumbler.

I think even May will own that it has a cunning little head.

See it turn its head around to look at us.

After all, the cockroach is a knowing little fellow.

This one is hungry; it has had nothing to eat for some time. We will
give it this crumb of cake.

Be careful, or it will get away; it can run very fast, and it is very
quick, you see, in all its motions.

Ah, it is examining the crumb with the tips of its long antennæ.

See how daintily it touches the crumb.

It can smell with its antennæ, you know.

Now it has decided the cake is good to eat.

See how eager it is!

   

It almost stands on its head to reach just the part it wants.

John says he does not understand how insects smell with their antennæ.

I can tell you a little about it, John.

If you look at one of the cockroach's antennæ under the magnifying
glass, you will see it is made up of a good many short pieces, or
segments, as we call them, fastened together end to end.

Yes, Mollie, that is why it can move about so easily. It can curl up
like a whiplash, you see.

Next the head is a round segment that fits into a socket.

   

Double up your right fist and fit it into the half-closed palm of your
left hand.

There! That is like the ball-and-socket joint.

You see you can move your fist around in all directions.

The insect can move its antennæ in all directions because they are
fastened to its head by ball-and-socket joints.

On the segments of the antennæ, particularly towards the tip, are little
dots.

You cannot see the dots without the help of a strong microscope, but
they are there.

These little dots are sensitive spots. There is a nerve coming from the
insect's brain to each dot.

Some of the dots are sensitive to odors, just as the nerves of our nose
are sensitive to odors.

May thinks it is very funny that the insects smell with antennæ instead
of with noses.

The insects, no doubt, would think it very funny for us to smell with,
noses instead of with antennæ, if they thought about it at all.

The little dots on the antennæ are extremely sensitive to smells. They
are often much more sensitive than our noses.

Put a bit of food at some distance from a hungry cockroach, and it will
not be long before a pair of long, sensitive feelers will come waving to
and fro out of some dark corner.

   

Little Mrs. Cockroach has smelled the dainty morsel, and, as soon as it
is dark, out she will run, her feelers moving eagerly this way and that,
until she has found it.

Yes, May, insects also feel with their antennæ. That is why the antennæ
are often called "feelers."

There are other dots on the segments that are sensitive to touch.
Sometimes there are tiny hairs on the antennæ, also sensitive to touch.

The little fellows feel and smell, yes, and oftentimes _hear_ with their
antennæ.

Many insects have spots sensitive to sound on the antennæ.

Yes, indeed, May, it is wonderful that such tiny threads as an insect's
antennæ should hold so many kinds of sensitive spots.

An insect's antennæ are among the most wonderful things in the world.

And _I_ think a cockroach, in spite of its bad reputation, is a very
wonderful little fellow.

What is that, May? Our cockroach is drawing one of its antennæ through
its mouth?

Ah, yes, see it clean its antenna, children.

It seems to nibble at it as it draws it through its mouth.

Insects are very careful to keep their antennæ clean.

It would not do to let these sensitive spots become covered with dust,
you know.

   



Isn't this a pretty place to sit down and--

"Ouch! ow! ow! ow!"

Why, May, what is the matter?

Anybody would think you had seen a cockroach.

What has she found, John?

   

Oh, it is a walking stick!

Why do I call it that?

Look and see.

Does it not look like a stick?

And does it not walk?

Then why is not walking stick a good name for it?

May thinks its legs look like a collection of pine needles, for they are
green and flat on the upper joints.

It is as pretty as it is queer, with its brown body and its green legs.

This is the male walking stick; the female has brown legs. She is brown
all over, just the color of dried leaves, and she is not as slender as
her mate.

Mollie thinks it is the long and slender thorax that makes the walking
stick look so queer.

See its thorax. Its six legs are attached to its thorax, which is as
long and as slender as the abdomen.

John thinks it looks queer because everything about it is so long and
slender.

   

Long antennæ, long legs, long thorax, long abdomen--that is Mr. Walking
Stick.

Sir, why do you have such long antennæ? Can you hear and feel and smell
extra well because of them?

I wish you could tell us about them.

Now where is it?

Oh, yes, it is standing on that brown twig. It is so nearly the color of
the twig and so much the shape of a little stick itself, that it is not
easy to find it.

There, it is walking off again.

   

It has a good name, for I am sure that if a stick tried to walk, it
could not do it more awkwardly.

See now, what it is doing, hanging by one foot from that twig.

How still it is.

Who would imagine, seeing it thus for the first time, that it was a
living creature?

The walking sticks feed on leaves, and I suppose their queer shape and
their color protect them from being eaten by birds.

A bird would have to be very close to a walking stick to tell it from a
twig.

The female drops the eggs on the ground, and leaves them to hatch out
and make their way in the world as best they can.

   

The young walking sticks look just like their parents, only of course
they are very small, and they are green in color, like the leaves they
eat.

Yes, little Nell, I should like to find some too; they must be cunning
little things.

They eat and grow and moult, and eat and grow and moult, until they are
grown up.

There are a good many species of walking sticks in the world,
particularly in hot countries; and to their family belong the longest of
known insects, some being nearly a foot long. Just imagine a walking
stick a foot long!

And some of them are quite prettily colored, though certain species are
not pleasant to handle, as they give forth a bad-smelling milky fluid
when disturbed.

They are gentle little folk, all of them, and move slowly about over the
leaves and twigs, not wishing to harm any living thing.

Some members of the walking stick family have wings, and these are even
more curious than those that have none.

Their wings and legs are flattened to look like leaves, so that it is
very difficult to find them among the foliage.

   

Yes, May, they are also the color of the leaves they live among.

Here is a picture of one that will give some idea of these strange
little people.

We have none of these leaf-like insects in our country, but we do have a
near relative to the walking sticks, though it does not feed on leaves,
I assure you.

How many of you are acquainted with his lordship, the praying mantis?

   

Charlie says he has seen these fellows in Kansas, and Nellie says she
has a cousin in the South who has told her about them.

Here is a picture of one; is it not a beauty!

Its wings are green and its body is brown, so that it can stealthily
creep about among the foliage without being noticed.

When at rest it holds its front legs up as though it were raising its
arms in an attitude of devotion.

But not a thought of devotion lies in that cruel little head. There is
only one idea there; and if any unwary insect were to come along, those
devotional arms would be thrust out with incredible rapidity, and the
unfortunate insect clasped tightly in them.

Then the mantis, hugging its prey in the strong trap-like clasp of its
spiked legs, would coolly proceed to devour it alive, eating it as a boy
would eat an apple.

   

This praying mantis is called a "mule-killer" in the South, where the
people think the brown liquor it spits out of its mouth, when disturbed,
is fatal to mules.

The mantis is also called a devil-horse, a rear-horse, a camel-cricket,
and many other names inspired by its outlandish appearance.

Some have even thought it looked wise, standing in that knowing attitude
with extended arms, and so it has been called prophet and soothsayer, as
though it could foretell what is going to happen.

Undoubtedly it never foretells anything but the approaching death of
some insect and possibly a coming change in the weather, for insects
often know when the weather is going to change long before we do.

Although our mantes are brown or green, there are a great many species
living in hot countries that are much more brightly attired; and when
you find yourself on a visit to the tropics, you must look for the
flower mantis.

It mimics in color the brilliant hues of the showy orchids in which it
hides.

It does not seem to wear its gorgeous robes from a love for the
beautiful, however, but rather that it may the better lie concealed in
the heart of the gay flowers, to pounce upon unsuspecting insects that
come there for refreshing draughts of honey.

   

In some parts of Africa the mantis is worshipped by the natives, and in
France these fellows are believed to point out the way to travellers by
stretching out one leg when questioned.

Its strange attitude, with uplifted arms, has won the mantis regard in
all parts of the world, though the insects it clasps in these uplifted
arms would not be likely to share the good opinion held of this hardy
cannibal.

For it is a cannibal, and enjoys eating another mantis as much as
anything else.

The mantes are terrible fighters, too, and if there is a meeting between
two of them, there is very apt to be a battle in which one is vanquished
and devoured by the other.

Our mantis lays its eggs, thirty or forty in number, on tree twigs, and
they are embedded in a soft substance that soon becomes very tough and
horny. These strange egg-cases of the mantis are easily recognized
because they look as though they were braided on top, as you can see in
the picture.

   

Yes, May, the tough covering is to protect the eggs from wet and from
prying birds and hungry insects.

The young mantes are similar to their parents, only they have no wings.
But they hold up their spiny front legs and catch insects, and they grow
and moult in the usual way.

While we have been talking about leaf-like insects and mule-killers our
walking stick has gone off.

   

Well, well, let him go, and good luck go with him.

I am glad you like the walking stick, children.

And now, May, let me tell you something.

This queer fellow is a very near relative of your friend, the
cockroach.

   


Don't you often wonder where they come from? The swarms of grasshoppers
in the late summer?

Charlie says he walked across a field last night where he believes there
were as many grasshoppers as there were blades of grass.

Just think of it! and yet they do not seem to do any harm.

In some places, however, they do a great deal of harm.

They come flying in swarms that darken the sun, and they settle on the
trees and the crops and eat up every green thing. There is nothing a
Western farmer dreads so much as the passing of the grasshoppers.

Grasshoppers are funny little fellows, and we like them--when there are
not too many of them.

Summer would not seem quite like summer unless we heard the grasshoppers
shrilling.

There are a great many species of them, and we have placed them in two
divisions,--The Shorthorned Grasshoppers and The Longhorned
Grasshoppers.

   



They have no horns, of course, but some have short antennæ that stick
out like little horns, and those we call shorthorned.

The right name for the shorthorned grasshoppers is locusts.

We call another insect a locust, but the shorthorned grasshoppers are
the true locusts.

Some say it was these locusts that John the Baptist ate with his honey
in the wilderness.

   

A good many people in different parts of the world still eat locusts.

They are said to be good food when roasted, but I would rather eat
roasted peanuts.

Come here, little locust, and let us look at you.

Now, stand still, and show us your short "horns."

See its eyes!

Yes, May, they are compound eyes, but I do not know how many facets they
have.

What a funny little rabbit face it has.

See it move its little mouth parts.

It bites bits out of the leaves and chews them up very fast.

Has it teeth? May is asking.

Well, yes, but not like our teeth. Sometime you must see the mouth parts
of the grasshopper under the microscope. They are very interesting.

Mollie says the locust has a cape on.

John says the cape is the top of its thorax.

   

Frank has been counting its legs; he says it has six.

See it walk. It uses all six legs to walk with.

But it does something besides walk with its hind legs.

Yes, it jumps with them. How long and large they are! Now watch it jump.

See! It draws those long hind legs close up to its body, then suddenly
straightens them out--and away it goes as though it had been shot from a
spring board.

John says its hind legs work just like a spring, and so they do. It can
leap several times the length of its body. Amy thinks it should be
called a grass-jumper instead of a grasshopper.

Suppose we all look carefully at the locust's long hind leg, segment by
segment.

What, John? You do not know what a segment is?

Well, a segment is the part between two joints. The joints are where
the leg bends, you know.

May proposes that we draw a picture of the long hind leg.

It will be fun to try.

There are two tiny segments close to the body.

If you are not careful, you will find only one.

You must look sharp to see both of them.

How well Charlie has drawn his! He has both the little segments.

   

The one next the body we will mark I, and we will call it the coxa.

The next little one we will mark II, and that we will call the
trochanter.

The long, strong one, III, we will call the femur.

The next one, long and narrow, we will mark IV, and call the tibia.

All the rest of the leg, made of several short segments, we will call
the tarsus, and we will mark it V.

Now how are we to remember all those hard names?

Here is a jingle that perhaps will help us:--

  _Coxa_ first, and then _trochanter_,
  Number three the _femur_ stands,
  After this, the long, straight _tibia_,
  And last of all the _tarsus_ comes.

Now let us see who can learn it first.

Charlie says we are taking a good deal of trouble over the hind legs of
a grasshopper.

   

Very true, Mr. Philosopher, but let me tell you something.

When we have learned the names of the segments in the grasshopper's hind
leg, we have learned the names of the segments in the legs of all
insects.

You see all the legs are made on one common plan, and it is very
convenient, as you will soon see, to have the parts named.

What a fine set of drawings of the grasshopper's hind leg we have!

Why do you suppose the coxa and trochanter are so small?

Yes, John, it is in order that the leg can move easily.

The grasshopper can turn its leg in almost any direction because of
these small upper segments.

It can put its leg up over its head if it wants to. Next to the little
coxa and trochanter is the longest and largest segment in the
grasshopper's leg; I suppose nobody remembers its name.

Listen to little Nell,--"number three the _femur_ stands."

So it does, and what a very useful femur it is!

If it were not for the long femur and the long, slender tibia, the
grasshopper would not be a grasshopper--it could not hop at all.

Watch the grasshopper, and see how he uses those long segments to jump
with.

   

First he draws the tibia close up to the femur--now he is off!

He just straightened those long hind legs out with a jerk, and away he
went!

   

What do you suppose the two little sharp spines at the end of the tibia
are for?

What, May? You did not see any spines?

   

Look again.

See, Charlie has drawn them very plainly in his picture of the
grasshopper's leg. Mark them _s_, Charlie.

Now we must all look at Charlie's picture.

He says he thinks he knows what the spines are for--they are to keep
the grasshopper from slipping when he makes his leap forward.

I have no doubt Charlie is right.

May wants us to look at the beautiful little hinge x where the femur and
the tibia are fastened together.

   

Let us mark it _X_.

See the little ball on the end of the tibia. How well it fits into the
hollow on the end of the femur.

In order to see this hollow or groove, you must look on the under side
of the leg.

Yes, John, it reminds us of the ball-and-socket joint, only this is a
hinge joint, and does not move in so many directions.

The tibia can move towards the femur and away from it on this hinge.

When our little friend gets ready to jump, he draws the tibia close up
to the femur. When he jumps, he pushes the femur quickly away from the
tibia.

If you watch the grasshoppers, you will soon understand just how they
use their hind legs in jumping.

The tarsus bends easily.

It has three joints.

The last segment is a cunning little foot.

What is John doing?

He is looking at the grasshopper's foot through the magnifying glass.
Wise John!

Let us all look.

Yes, Charlie, we will try to draw it.

Mollie has hers drawn already. Do not hurry too much, Mollie. You cannot
draw well if you hurry.

See the sharp claw on each side of the foot.

   

Let us mark these claws _a_ and _b_.

Between them is a flat little pad which we may as well mark _c_.

May says her picture looks like a crazy pond lily.

Let us see, May. Well, it _is_ rather funny.

If I were you, I should try again. Any child can learn to draw who will
keep trying.

Touch the grasshopper's foot with the tip of your finger.

How the little foot clings to you!

It clings by the two little claws that have caught in your skin, and
that hold fast.

   

What do you suppose the little pad between the claws is for?

It is important, I can tell you.

John says he has heard there is a little pad in the fly's foot that
enables it to walk on glass.

Yes, and it is the same with the grasshopper.

The little pad between the claws is fringed with hairs.

You can see them with a good magnifying glass.

Out of the tip of each hair comes a little drop of sticky liquid.

This fastens the foot to any smooth surface.

Many insects have these sticky hairs on their foot pads.

When a fly walks up a window pane, it does it by gluing its feet, one
after the other, to the glass.

I don't wonder you laugh.

No, Mollie, the glue does not harden and hold it fast.

The fly can easily pull its foot loose. The grasshopper cannot walk on
glass quite as well as the fly. Its foot pads do not cling so well.

   

Would you not like to know the name of these curious little foot pads?

We call the foot pad a _pulvillus_.

Some insects do not have sticky hairs on the pulvillus.

There are beetles that simply put the pulvillus so flat against a smooth
surface that it stays there by the pressure of the air above.

Some people think that is the way the pulvillus on the fly's foot acts.

Perhaps it acts both ways, sucking fast and sticking by hairs.

John wants to know if the beetle's pulvillus does not act just like the
"sucker" that boys make.

The sucker, you know, is a round piece of leather with a string attached
to the middle.

When the leather is wet and laid flat on the floor or on a smooth stone,
all the air below it is pushed out, and the air above presses so hard
that a boy cannot pull the leather up from the floor.

   

You can peel it up from one edge and let the air under easily enough,
and then a baby could lift it.

When the insect wants to move, it peels its foot loose.

It can do this very quickly.

Mollie wants to know what all these little sharp spines on the back of
the tibia are for.

Let us look at them.

There is a double row of them.

Do they not look a little like a comb?

I suspect that is what they are, the grasshopper's comb.

Insects are very neat little folks.

They are always cleaning their wings and their legs and their antennæ
and their bodies.

The spines on their legs are very convenient for that.

Charlie says he thinks the grasshopper's legs are as good as a whole box
of tools.

So they are, and you have not yet heard all they can do.

The funniest is to come.

Mr. Grasshopper sings his song with his hind legs!

He rubs the inside of his femurs against the outside of his wings.

There is a row of very fine spines down the inside of the femur for the
use of the little fiddler.

He scrapes away with these on his wing covers.

Yes, Ned, his femur is his violin bow, and his wing cover is his violin.

The noise he makes does not sound much like a violin, little Nell
thinks.

No, indeed, it does not.

It is the shrilling sound we hear in the grass in the summer time.

   

It is only the male grasshopper that sings.

The little lady grasshopper sits still and listens to him.

Now, let us look at the other legs.

The front pair are the smallest.

Can you find the little coxa and trochanter?

Yes, Charlie, we will draw the little front leg.

Let us number the segments as we did those of the hind leg.

See, the femur is larger than the other segments, but it is small as
compared to the femur of the hind leg.

The tibia is shorter, too, than the tibia of the hind leg.

The little tarsus is like the tarsus of the hind leg with its claws and
its pulvillus, only, of course, it is smaller.

The middle pair of legs is like the front pair, only larger.

Now, see how the legs are placed on the grasshopper's body.

   

The front pair are directed forward. When the insect walks, they pull.

The middle and hind legs are directed backward. When the insect walks,
they push.

Well, little legs, you all have your own work to do, and you surely do
it very well.

Let me see, who has front legs as odd as the grasshopper's hind legs.

Yes, Mollie, the mantis has.

Let us look again at the mantis.

Here is another picture of it.

Its hind legs are just common walking legs, you see.

And so are its middle legs.

   

John says they are directed forward instead of backward.

You can see why.

They have to take the place of the front legs, that do not touch the
ground at all.

They have to hold Mr. Mantis up, and pull him along when he wants to
walk.

Now, let us see if we can make anything out of these front legs.

The coxa is small and close to the body.

The trochanter, II, is very large and long.

Yes, Charlie, it increases the size and strength of the leg very
greatly, by being thus enlarged.

The femur, III, is large and strong, too, and it has a row of sharp,
spiny teeth down the inside.

The tibia, IV, is also well supplied with cruel teeth, and at the end of
it is the tarsus, as you see.

You know how the mantis uses these legs. The joint between the tibia and
femur is a strong hinge joint. If can shut the tibia close to the femur,
the spiny teeth of the one locking into the spiny teeth of the other,
and forming a terrible trap for the insects that are so unfortunate as
to get caught in its merciless grip.

Altogether, you see, it is quite a terrible leg, though it has no more
segments than a common leg.

The segments are changed in shape and size from the regular leg
segments.

When any part is changed from the regular shape or size, we say it is
_modified_.

The front legs of the mantis are modified to catch and hold its prey.

Yes, John, the hind legs of the grasshopper are modified too.

They are modified to jump with.

Ned says he didn't know there was so much to learn about a little thing
like an insect's leg.

Yes, indeed, there is a great deal to learn about all living things.

I wonder how you would like to look at the grasshopper's wings for a
little while.

Here is one with large wings.

   

See how they lie along each side of the body.

They come together on top like the ridge of a sloping house roof.

Yes, May, they are the roof to the grasshopper's body, and they help to
protect it.

Let us gently spread them out.

Ah! these roof wings are not what the locust flies with at all.

See, folded up under them is a pair of delicate gauzy wings.

   

If we are careful, we can spread them out.

We will use this dead grasshopper that Charlie has found.

What pretty wings! So dainty! And how cleverly they are folded up, like
little fans.

Who would imagine such delicate gauzy wings were folded away under the
hard, stiff roof wings.

The roof wings are called wing covers, because they cover up these
pretty inner wings.

The locust does not fly with the wing covers.

It spreads them out wide to get them out of the way.

It flies with the inner wings.

   

How pretty the flying wings are when they are spread out!

See, over there goes a grasshopper whose flying wings are bright yellow.

And there goes another with red flying wings.

Some of the grasshoppers are almost as pretty as butterflies when they
are flying.

They show their gay inner wings only during flight.

As soon as the grasshopper comes to rest the inner wings close of
themselves.

The wing joints act like springs.

The grasshopper does not have to think about shutting up its wings.

   

John says it has a spring in its wing covers too.

Open the wing cover.

There, it locks itself, as it were, and stays open without any effort on
the part of the grasshopper.

You see the grasshopper wants its wing covers to stay open and out of
the way of the inner wings when it flies.

So it just opens them, and there they are.

It moves the inner wings very fast indeed when it is flying. It would
not do at all for them to be fastened open.

If it did not move them, it could not fly. The wings fairly _whirr_,
they go so fast. They beat against the air, and thus the grasshopper is
pushed along through the air.

As soon as it is done flying it stops moving the wings, and they
instantly close of themselves.

   

Then it unlocks the wing covers and they shut down over the inner wings.
They shut down very tightly. They overlap, as you can see, just below
where they are fastened to the insect's body. Thus they form a very good
roof.

   

What wonderful wings the grasshopper has!

And there is something more to be said about them.

Some species of locusts use their wings as musical instruments. When
they wish to, they rub the upper end of the inner wings against the
upper end of the wing covers when they are flying.

This makes the crackling sound we sometimes hear when the locusts fly.

What is that, Mollie? You have caught a locust that has no wings at all?

Who can guess why?

Ah, yes, our wise John says he thinks it is because it is a young one.

What makes you think so, John?

I know, you remembered the larva of the dragon fly and of the May fly.

   

Those larvæ had no wings at first, but the wings grew, and finally at
the last moult they were full-sized.

When first hatched, the locust larva is like the full-grown locust,
only, of course, it is very small, and it has no wings at all.

It is a little dot of a thing with an enormous head.

Here are three clinging to a blade of grass.

Are they not funny little rascals!

The baby locust eats and grows and moults until, finally, the wings
begin to show as little pads at its sides.

   

It is easy to find these half-grown grasshoppers in the middle of the
summer.

Here is one that little Nell has caught.

See its wing pads.

Mollie says they are rudimentary wings.

It continues to eat and grow and moult, and the little wings are moulted
off with the rest of the skin--for the wings of the insect are only
modified parts of the skin.

But there are new and larger wings underneath, and these grow and are
moulted off with the next skin, until, at last, the grasshopper is
full-grown, with full-grown wings.

It will not moult any more after that.

When full-grown, the females lay their eggs.

Where do you suppose they lay their eggs?

Some of them make a hole in the ground.

The end of the abdomen is very strong and sharp, and the locust can make
a hole with it quite easily.

When the hole is made, then the eggs are laid in it, and the locust
covers the opening to the hole with a sticky substance to keep out the
wet.

The eggs usually lie in the ground all winter.

   

Just think of the locust eggs there are under our feet as we cross the
fields!

Millions and millions of little eggs are hidden in the ground.

Early in the next summer the little eggs hatch, and then tiny locusts
creep up out of the earth and go hopping about everywhere.

Most of the full-grown locusts die in the fall.

As you know, the young ones have no wings, and this is why there are so
few winged locusts early in the summer.

Some locusts make their holes in fence rails or in old stumps.

It is the locusts, or shorthorned grasshoppers, that sometimes come in
swarms that darken the sun.

There is nothing the Western farmer dreads so much as a swarm of
locusts.

I have heard how the grasshoppers came in Kansas one year.

They appeared all of a sudden in countless millions.

They were piled up against the fences clear to the top.

They swarmed into the houses, and in places on the railroad track they
were piled so deep the trains could not run through them.

Think of a railway train being stopped by grasshoppers!

They stripped every leaf from the trees and left them as bare as in
winter.

They ate up every blade of grass.

But in the East they do not do so much damage, though they sometimes
cause the farmers serious loss. When summer comes we may listen to their
cheery din with pleasure.

I am sure we shall enjoy the merry sounds of the grasshoppers all the
more now that we know something about how they are made, and something
about the little fellow that makes them.

   




Probably it was the longhorned grasshoppers that Charlie saw so many of
in the meadow.

Look, next time, Charlie, and see if the swarms that start up before you
have not long, slender antennæ.

See, here is one.

Its antennæ are like threads, and they are longer than its body.

If you were to look at its tarsus, you would find it had four joints
instead of three.

Otherwise, the longhorned, or meadow grasshoppers are very much like the
locusts, or shorthorned grasshoppers.

John says he thinks the meadow grasshoppers are more slender and
delicate in shape.

That is true, as a rule, though there are some species of the locusts
that are as slender as the longhorned grasshoppers.

But there is one thing about these longhorned fellows that will amuse
you.

Some of them have ears on their front legs!

It is not uncommon for insects to have hearing organs on their front
legs.

You know what an ear is. It is something to hear with. The hearing part
of our own ears is way inside, out of sight.

The outer part of the ear, that we can take hold of, is only a sort of
funnel to gather up the sound, and we could still hear if this part of
our ears were cut off.

Way back inside the ear is a little curtain, or eardrum, made of a thin
membrane.

When sounds enter the ear they cause the eardrum to tremble or vibrate,
and this excites the nerve of hearing that is behind the eardrum.

Now some grasshoppers have a little flat membrane on the tibia of each
front leg. It is an eardrum. Behind it is the nerve of hearing. When
sounds strike the eardrum it vibrates and excites the nerve of hearing.

   

So you see the insects have _ears_, though they have no funnel-like
outsides to them.

So, after all, there isn't so _very_ much difference between the way the
grasshoppers hear, and the way we hear, although they do hear with their
legs.

Yes, Ned, it is about the same thing when they hear with sensitive spots
on their antennæ.

The sounds strike the sensitive spots, which are tiny eardrums, and
cause the nerves that come to them to hear.

You see, after all, an ear is only a membrane able to vibrate when
sounds strike it and a nerve sensitive to those sounds.

It does not matter much where the ear is located. Our ears are on either
side of our head, and so are the ears of all the higher animals.

But the ears of the insects are more useful to them when on the antennæ,
or the legs, or some have them on the abdomen. An ear is an ear wherever
it happens to be, and the insects hear well enough with theirs.

   

In many species of the longhorned grasshoppers, the male has a curious
musical instrument on his wing covers, close to where they grow from the
body.

Little Mr. Grasshopper sings to his lady-love by rubbing the upper parts
of the wing covers together. You see the round places at _X_,--those are
the modified parts of the wing cover, by means of which he can make his
music.

What is that, May? Your grasshopper has a long sword at the end of its
body?

   

Yes, that is its ovipositor. Ovipositor means "egg-placer."

With this long, sharp ovipositor the grasshopper can roughen the bark of
twigs or make holes in the stems of plants or in the earth.

Then the eggs are guided down through the long ovipositor to the place
prepared for them, and fastened there by a gummy substance.

   

Only the female grasshoppers have the long, sword-shaped ovipositor.

The ovipositor of the locust is not long and sword-like.

It is short, but it is strong and sharp, and you remember how the locust
uses it to dig with.

Yes, indeed, Mollie, there are a great many species of locusts and
grasshoppers, and some of them are very beautiful.

In hot countries they sometimes grow to an enormous size.

May is asking why they make molasses.

No, Ned, of course it isn't molasses. Children call it molasses because
it looks like it.

Now, May, where does it make its molasses?

In its mouth, you say, and then it spits it out on your finger.

What? You don't like its old molasses on your finger?

No, of course not.

It smells bad, and it is sticky and disagreeable to the touch, and if
you happen to put your finger in your mouth it has a nasty taste.

   

John says he hates to touch the grasshopper on account of this molasses.

You _all_ do?

Well, I guess that is why it makes its molasses; it doesn't want you to
touch it.

It doesn't want birds to eat it, or other insects to bother it, and so
it smears them with this ill-smelling, sticky liquid.

Some birds eat it, however, in spite of its molasses.

Turkeys do.

What is that, Ned? turkeys are not birds, you think?

What are they?

If you think about it, you will have to come to the conclusion that
turkeys are birds.

Then chickens and ducks and geese must be birds?

Well, so they are. They are all birds.

But to return to turkeys.

A flock of turkeys will spread out in a long line, and go across a
field, driving the grasshoppers ahead of them, and eating them as fast
as they can pick them up.

It is a funny sight to see a big flock of turkeys hunting grasshoppers
in a meadow.

It is not funny to the grasshoppers, though.

What is that, Charlie? The grasshopper somehow reminds you of the
praying mantis?

Do you know it is a near relative of the mantis?

Now, I will tell you something funny about the mantis.

It makes "molasses" like the grasshopper. Yes, it is this harmless
"molasses" that has given it the name of "mule-killer."

I will tell you something else. If you lie down in the grass and watch
the grasshoppers, you will have a good time, and you will see some
strange things.

Nobody can tell you very much about the grasshoppers--or about the
living creature. The best way is to use your own eyes and watch.

Just lie down in the grass perfectly still, and soon the insects that
live in the grass will begin to appear.

   

What they will do you must find out for yourselves; but you may be sure
it will be worth finding out,--the funny, clever, wise little
people!--ah! they are good to watch.

They will soon go on chirping and shrilling and rasping and kricking and
tapping and whizzing and whirring and buzzing all about you; and if you
listen sharp, perhaps you can understand some of the things they say.

And this I am sure of; if you really watch and listen, you can learn to
know the different insects by their sounds, just as you can know the
birds by their songs. You can even tell whether you are listening to the
meadow grasshopper, or the locust.

If I thought you were not tired of hearing how grasshoppers are made, I
should tell you some more.

John says he would like to know some more.

Well, then, I will tell you about their rings.

You can see the rings of the grasshopper people very plainly in their
abdomens.

   

Here is a picture of a grasshopper. It is not all drawn. The legs and
wings are not shown, and the abdomen is drawn by itself so you can see
it easily.

There are ten rings, you see.

The rings are covered with a hard, horny substance.

This horny substance is what makes the body of the insect so stiff. It
would be soft but for the chitin, as the horny substance is called.

It is better for the insect to have a chitinous covering.

If you had no bones, you would be glad to have your skin hardened with
chitin.

You see how it is, you wear your skeleton inside. Your skeleton is of
bones; it is an inside skeleton.

The grasshoppers and all the insects wear their skeleton outside. It is
made of chitin; it is an outside skeleton.

Insects have no bones.

They do not need any. They are kept stiff by the chitin.

Each ring in the insect's abdomen is made of four pieces, the back
piece, the side pieces, and the under piece. You can see the back piece
and one side piece in the picture, but you cannot see the other side
piece nor the under piece without turning the insect over.

The rings are made in pieces so the insect can move.

Suppose each ring were made of one stiff piece like a finger ring. What
a poor stiff, old grasshopper it would be! The rings are called
segments.

Segment number one has only a back piece, you see.

All the other segments have four pieces.

Segments two, three, four, five, six, seven, and eight are alike.

Segments nine and ten are modified to form the ovipositor.

The segments are fastened together by skin. The skin is soft so the
segments can move back and forth.

The segments can be crowded close together to shorten the abdomen.

The segments can be separated from each other to lengthen the abdomen.

There is no chitin in the skin between the segments. It is soft so the
segments can move.

Do you know how a telescope is made?

The abdomen of the insect can lengthen and shorten somewhat like a
telescope.

It is easy to see the rings in the abdomen of the locust or grasshopper.

Now, what about the thorax?

That, you tell me, has no rings.

   

Look again, and look carefully.

You will have to see another picture.

This is a picture of the head and thorax of the grasshopper. It is drawn
to show the separate parts of the thorax.

Yes, John, the thorax has three segments. They are grown so close
together you would not suspect it until you looked very close.

The front legs are fastened to the first segment.

What is fastened to the middle segment?

Yes, May, the middle pair of legs and the wing covers.

Mollie says the long hind legs and the flying wings are fastened to the
third or hind segment.

Oh, you funny little folks! you are all made up of rings.

Yes, indeed, little Nell, the segments of the thorax are made of chitin;
they are very stiff.

Ned thinks the segments of the legs are made of chitin too.

Their outside shell certainly is.

The whole outer shell of the insect is made of the horny chitin.

You hard little chitin-covered, segmented people, you are very different
from us.

Ah! yes, May, they are like us in many ways.

Indeed, Mollie, insects do have brains.

They have muscles, too, to move their little bodies with.

We have muscles under our skin, you know. The muscles move our arms and
legs and bodies.

If you clasp your fingers around your arm and then move your arm, you
can feel the muscles.

The insects have muscles inside their chitinous shells. The muscles move
their bodies.

The muscles are very, very strong.

They are stronger for their size than the muscles of a horse.

John, do you know how heavy a load a horse can pull?

Well, it cannot pull a load equal to the weight of its own body.

Now, listen to this,--almost any insect can pull a load that is five
times the weight of its body!

Ah, yes, some insects can pull a much heavier weight than that. The
honey bee, for instance, can pull a load twenty times as heavy as its
body.

And think how our little insect friends can jump! Why, a kangaroo cannot
begin to jump like a grasshopper.

No, indeed, Ned, the finest jumper in the world of men cannot begin to
jump as well as a grasshopper, not even with the aid of a spring board.
He is a mere baby in comparison.

Ah, yes, we can do a great many things better than the grasshoppers,
but, you see, they can do some things better than we can.

What is that, John?

You want to know about the mouth parts of the grasshopper?

Suppose we leave the mouth parts.

They are difficult to understand. We have had a good many new names to
learn lately.

What, May? You can't remember such hard words?

Oh, yes, of course you can.

You don't mind learning "rhinoceros," and "Mississippi," and
"Popocatepetl," and "eenie, meenie, monie mike," and they are quite as
hard as femur and tibia; and, besides, you have a femur yourself! Did
you know it?

Your thigh bone, like the grasshopper's thigh, is called a femur.

Yes, Mollie, there is a bone in your leg called the tibia, and you have
a tarsus in your foot.

So, after all, when you are learning hard words about insects you are
learning a great deal besides, as you will find.

   



Katy did!

Katy didn't!

Katy did!

Well, well, did she or didn't she, and what of it anyway.

Come here, Katy did and Katy didn't, the children want to see you.

She's a pretty little Did and Didn't, isn't she.

Katy, why do you not know your own mind and always tell the same story?

Krick--krick--krick, there, she is talking; that's her way of saying
"Katy did."

Krick--krick--krickkrick. Now she has said "Katy didn't."

Well, we never shall know anything more about it.

No, little Nell, she doesn't really say Katy did or Katy didn't, but it
sounds like that, and we make believe she says it.

John says he is sure the katydids are first cousins to the grasshoppers
and locusts, and so they are.

They are very closely related to--which division of locusts, do you
think?

Oh, yes, the longhorned, of course.

See their long, long antennæ, and the male has the same little musical
places on his wings, little membranes that vibrate and make his song of
Katy did and Katy didn't.

   

No, the little lady katydid cannot sing--only the little male, and he
keeps it up all night long.

We sometimes wish he would get tired or sleepy and stop, but he never
does.

Why do you suppose he likes to sing so well in the night?

The katydids generally live on trees and bushes.

Yes, they are a beautiful, pale green people, and that is one reason we
do not often see them. It is not easy to find a katydid among the green
leaves.

The female katydids have a long sword-shaped ovipositor with which they
roughen the bark on twigs, and place the eggs there, fastening them with
a gummy substance.

The egg is glued fast so it will not fall off.

It hatches into a little dot of a katydid that has no wings, but, like
the larvæ of the other insects we know about, it eats and grows and
moults, and at last its wings and the rest of its body are full grown.

It casts its skin for the last time; it is no longer a larva, but a
full-grown insect.

Yes, May, we call the young of all insects larvæ.

   

See this dainty katydid that Charlie has caught for us.

How pretty it is!

Its feelers are like long green threads.

And how sensitive they are!

It quickly starts away when we touch one of the feelers.

Yes, Mollie, the katydid walks more than the grasshopper.

It can jump well with those long, slender hind legs. How beautiful its
hind legs are! They are longer and more delicate than those of the
grasshopper.

And its wings, how gauzy and dainty! Its wing covers are not so stiff as
those of the grasshopper. They look almost like flying wings, they are
so delicate.

See, they open, and fasten themselves open, like the wing covers of the
grasshopper; and when they are at rest they overlap like the wings of
the grasshopper.

The inner wings are like fine lace.

They look too delicate for use, and yet the katydid flies very well
indeed with them.

They are a little longer than the wing covers.

   

When the katydid is at rest you can see the tips of the wings extending
beyond the ends of the wing covers.

The part of the inner wing that extends beyond the wing covers is green,
like the wing covers, you see.

But the rest of the inner wing is not green, it is like very thin glass,
or like fine isinglass.

Look for a moment at the long curved ovipositor of the female katydid.

If you look sharp, you will see teeth on it like a little saw. It is
with these teeth the little katydid is able to rasp the surface of the
twigs, and make a place to fasten her eggs to.

Her wings are wrapped about her form like an ample cloak of green.

   

Now, my little katydid, you may fly away if you want to.

We are very much obliged to you for letting us look at you, and we hope
we have not troubled you too much.

See her go!

How prettily the katydids fly.

They seem almost like little birds.

I am sure they love to fly about in the bright summer-time.

Happy katydids.





Now what strange-looking little creature are you?

John says it looks like a grasshopper, only it has no wings and its body
is not that of a grasshopper.

May says it looks like a cricket, only it has the long legs of a
grasshopper.

It is called the cricket-like grasshopper, and it is partly like a
cricket, as you see, and partly like a grasshopper.

It is a funny little fellow that lives around in dark corners, usually
in the woods.

Do see those long, spiny legs!

   

How he _can_ jump.

He has strong, short, sharp spines on the femurs and on the tibias.

He has spines on all his legs, and what long feet he has!

Yes, Nell, his antennæ are longer than anything else about him. I
should think they would be in his way.

He has no wings at all, and he never will have any.

He has two pairs of feelers in front of his mouth that show very
plainly. They show more plainly than the mouth parts of the grasshopper,
though they are quite like them.

Yes, Ned, they are larger than the mouth parts of the grasshopper.

There is another little fellow very similar to the cricket-like
grasshopper.

It has no wings, and the top of the thorax is like a broad shield.

It is called the shield-backed grasshopper.

See if you can find one of them.

   


   


Chirp! chirp!

Chirp! chirp!

Ah, listen to that cheery song. It is the cricket on the hearth singing
thus gayly.

Dear little cricket; he lives in the corner by the fireplace. When all
is still we hear his cheery chirp! chirp! chirp!

Sometimes he comes peering out and runs across the hearth, a little
black fireside fairy.

Do you know one of the prettiest stories in the world has been written
about a cricket?

Charles Dickens wrote it, and it is called "The Cricket on the Hearth."

Be sure to read this beautiful story. If you do not own it, ask to have
it for Christmas. It is in the book of "Christmas Tales," a book that
everybody ought to have.

Grasshoppers and katydids are pleasant people, but they live out of
doors, and they do not seem quite so much like our very own little
friends as the crickets.

Of course the crickets live out of doors, too, only once in a while one
of them comes into the house to live with us.

We hear them chirping in the grass and among the stones.

   

There is a certain place near the seashore where the rocks are alive
with the black cricket folk.

They come peeping out at you from all sides. They skip over the rocks,
and you will often see a pair of long feelers and an inquisitive little
head looking around a corner.

You too, know there are crickets, little Nell?

Let us go and see them.

Ah, yes, there is one, looking at us out of inquisitive eyes, over there
by that big stone.

   

Of course they are cousins to the grasshoppers. I knew you would guess
that right away.

Yes, John, the little cricket people have flat backs.

Their wing covers do not make a peaked roof over their backs, but are
flat on top and bent down at the sides like a box cover.

   

They are not so long as the wings of the grasshopper, but they overlap
on top.

Sometimes they are not so long as the body of the cricket.

Just watch now!

How spry the cricket folk are!

They jump well, but they also run well. They are always running about as
though they enjoyed it.

It is not easy to catch one of them unless we, too, are "as spry as a
cricket."

Funny little rascals, to come peeping at us like that, from out the
crevices in the stones.

When we stir,--pop! they are back out of sight.

They eat leaves, and they enjoy a piece of nice, ripe fruit, or a bit of
juicy vegetable.

See here, one has jumped on my hand and is sitting quite still.

It is a male cricket.

   

How do I know that?

May says because it has no ovipositor.

Yes, that is one way to know.

Look at his wing covers.

  : MALE CRICKET 

See how they are ribbed.

  : FEMALE CRICKET 

Now look at this cricket Mabel has caught. It is a female, and its
wings, you see, are not ornamented like those of the male.

   

Do you know the meaning of his heavily ribbed wing covers?

Why, his wing covers are his musical instruments. See one of them
magnified.

It is divided into spaces like so many little drum-heads. The ridge that
runs across the top of the wing is something like a file in structure.

When little Mr. Cricket is in the mood for chirping, he raises his wing
covers and rubs them together.

This throws the stiff membranes of which the wing covers are made into
vibration, and the result is the cheery call of our little black fairy.

Little Nell says the cricket is more like a brownie than a fairy, and
maybe she is right.

You can easily see the crickets rub their wings together if you watch in
the fall of the year.

John says, Why do you have to watch in the fall of the year?

Now who can guess?

Yes, May, it is because the crickets are then full-grown, and have
large wing covers. At first, in the early summer, they have no wings,
and so of course, we could not see them chirp.

The whole grasshopper tribe is a vocal one; the males all have musical
instruments, and in Japan, the people are so fond of the song of _their_
grasshopper folk, which are not quite like ours, that they make tiny
cages for them.

The chirpers are caught and put in these cages, and sold in the city
streets.

Yes, little Nell, the crickets make molasses. So do the katydids.

All these little hopping neighbors of ours seem to understand the useful
art of molasses making.

The mole crickets are different from the others.

   

They burrow in the ground like a mole, and we do not often see them.

The strangest thing about them is their hands.

No, of course they are not really hands, but they look like them.

All the joints of the fore legs are modified to form strong digging
tools, and they look very much like the paws of the mole.

   

They are troublesome fellows, sometimes, when they eat the tender roots
of the vegetables in the garden.

You all have seen the little tree cricket, but you might not recognize
it as a cricket, it is such a pale little creature.

Its light green body may often be seen on bushes in the summer-time,
and, if you look carefully, the form will tell you what the little one
is.

   




The crickets, grasshoppers, walking sticks, praying mantes, and
cockroaches, strange as it may seem, are all near relatives to each
other.

They all belong to one large family or order, the ORTHOPTERA.

Or-thop-te-ra, is it not a hard word!

It will not seem so hard when you know what it means.

It comes from two Greek words _orthos_, meaning straight, and _pteron_,
meaning a wing.

Straight-wing.

And do you know, it does not mean that the _upper_ wings are straight,
but that the under wings are folded down in long straight lines.

Now let us see if we can tell in what ways all of our Orthoptera are
alike.

They all have--?

"Four wings"--that is right, little Nell.

What, John? the walking sticks have no wings?

   

Not our walking sticks, but yet they belong to a winged family. You
remember the tropical walking sticks that have queer leaf-like wings, do
you not?

Are the four wings alike?

No, John says, the upper ones are narrow and stiff and serve as wing
covers.

The inner ones are broader and more delicate. They fold up when not in
use and are used to fly with.

Very good indeed, John. Now I will tell you something. The Orthoptera
all have mouth parts made to bite with. They do not bite anything but
what they eat, however. They are quite harmless so far as we are
concerned.

The young Orthoptera look like the old ones, only they have no wings.
They hatch out of the egg with a head, a six-legged thorax, and an
abdomen.

Now, come, let us look at all of our orthopterous friends again,
cockroaches first.

   

How do they get about, John?

Yes, indeed, they run, the rascals. They run fast too. They are flat and
their six legs are very much alike. They are well built for running and
hiding in cracks.

Suppose we call them the _Running Orthoptera_.

Now, look at our mantis.

He does not run very much. How is he different from the others?

Ah, yes, he has big front legs, and little Nell says he grabs things
with them.

   

So he does. Now, what shall we call these grabbers?

The Grabbing Orthoptera, Ned says.

Suppose we say instead the _Grasping Orthoptera_, because grasping
sounds a little better than grabbing. Do you not think so?

   

Now for Mr. Walking Stick.

We cannot very well call him a member of the Running Orthoptera, can we?

Ah, Mollie has it. We must call his kind the _Walking Orthoptera_.

His six legs are all long and slender, and he moves them slowly.

   

Now for those fellows with the long hind legs, the locusts and katydids
and crickets. Yes, all of you are ready to name them.

We call them--what?

May says, the Hopping Orthoptera.

John thinks Jumping Orthoptera would sound better.

And that is what we name them, the _Jumping Orthoptera_.

How many kinds of Jumping Orthoptera are we acquainted with, Ned? Now,
think before you speak.

He says we know the shorthorned grasshoppers, or locusts, the
longhorned, or meadow, grasshoppers, and the crickets.

Very well done, Ned.

May wants to know what has become of the katydids and the cricket-like
grasshoppers--she thinks Ned has left them out.

Ned says they belong to the longhorned grasshoppers.

Now you shall have a list of the Orthoptera that will help you to
remember them.

If we can group together things that are like each other, it is easier
to remember them.

       ORDER ORTHOPTERA.

      _Running Orthoptera._
          Cockroaches, Croton Bugs.
      _Grasping Orthoptera._
          Praying Mantis.
      _Walking Orthoptera._
          Walking Sticks.
      _Jumping Orthoptera._
          Shorthorned Grasshoppers, or Locusts.
          Longhorned, or Meadow, Grasshoppers.
          Crickets.

There are a great many species of Orthoptera in the world, and we have
seen but a very few of them.

But I can tell you, we feel a little better acquainted with you
orthopterous fellows than we did.

The dragon fly says we have not given him a place.

But, dear dragon fly, you belong to another family. You are not an
orthopterous insect.

Your order is called the ODO-NA-TA.

The wings of the Odonata are very different from those of the
Orthoptera.

   

You remember how they are?

Yes, Ned, they are stiff and covered with a close network of fine veins,
and all four of them are alike.

No wing covers, you see.

I do not know why they have the name Odonata.

The young Odonata are not like their parents, excepting that they have a
head, a thorax with six legs, and an abdomen. But they certainly do not
look like their parents!

No, John, the May flies do not belong to the Odonata. Their wings are
quite different.

   

Do you not remember how small the hind wings are?

The name of their order is EPH-E-MER-I-DA.

There is a big name for a little insect!

It comes from the Greek word _ephemeros_, and you know what it means.

What? Has everybody forgotten about the dainty little ephemeræ, that
live but a day?

That is what _ephemeros_ means, lasting but a day.

The stone flies have four wings, but they are not like those of the
Odonata, or of the Ephemerida.

Do you remember how the hind wings are folded?

Yes, May, in plaits, so these are the plaited wings, or
PLE-COP-TE-RA, from _pteran_, a wing, and _plecos_, plaited.

The little silver fish, as you remember, has no wings at all,
so its order is called THY-SA-NU-RA, from its bristle tail,
_thysanos_, in Greek, meaning a tassel, and _oura_, the tail.




   


Now, my children, do you know what a bug is? Most people do not.

They call every insect a "bug," but bugs are bugs, flies are flies, ants
are ants, and neither flies nor ants are bugs.

Indeed, no insects are bugs--excepting just bugs!

Our croton bugs are not really bugs. They do not belong to the bug
family.

   

A bug has four wings--when it has any.

But its wings are not like those of the Orthoptera or Odonata or
Ephemerida or Plecoptera.

Some bugs have no wings.

Young bugs are like old bugs, only smaller, and they have no wings.

You remember the Orthoptera and Odonata bite their food.

They chew it up and swallow it.

Bugs do not bite, they suck. Their mouth parts are often grown together
in the form of a tube that is sometimes very sharp.

They stick these sharp tubes or beaks into their food, and suck it up.





What, May; you want to see a bug? Well, that is easy enough.

Here is one in this pond at our feet. Do you know it?

   

Yes, John; it is the water boatman.

Nell says she doesn't see it.

There, Nell, that little thing that shines like silver under the water.
It is clinging to a weed.

No, we cannot see it very well unless we catch it.

Ned, do you think you can be spry enough to scoop it out with the net?

There, he has it,--no, it is off.

Well, we shall never see that one again; but here, in this corner of the
pond, see, several of them.

   

Now don't be in too great a hurry, Ned; they are hard to catch.

He has it!

Here, don't touch it,--bugs are biters, remember.

Put it in this tumbler of water, and clap the cover over
it--quick--so!--now we have it.

What is that, Mollie? I just said bugs do not bite, and now I call them
biters?

I don't wonder you are puzzled.

They do _not_ bite, but they pierce with their mouth tubes, and that
feels just as though they bit us. So we commonly speak of bugs as
biting.

If you wish to be very exact, we will hereafter speak of bugs as
piercing or sucking.

Now, Mr. Water Boatman, we are going to have a good look at you.

Nell says it is not like silver any more, but just a little black and
gray speckled bug.

That is because it is now on top of the water. When it goes under it is
surrounded with a layer of air, and that is what makes it look as though
it had on a silver dress.

May wants to know how it manages to take a layer of air down under the
water. If you were to look at it with a magnifying glass, May, you would
see it is covered with fine hairs; the air becomes entangled in these
hairs. Do you not remember how the leaf of the jewel weed, or
touch-me-not, as it is also called, shines when you plunge it in water?
It, too, is covered with fine hairs that hold air. Many leaves shine in
this way when put under water, and always because of the fine hairs
that prevent the air from being pushed out by the water. You see the
hairs on the bugs serve the same purpose as those on the leaves; they
hold fast the air.

Our water boatman breathes this air that surrounds him.

You know how insects breathe do you not?

Dear me, then I shall have to tell you.

They have no lungs; of course, so they cannot breathe with lungs as we
do.

Take a long breath--see how your chest rises--that is because you filled
your lungs full of air.

Well, the insects have to breathe air.

Every living thing has to breathe air. Nothing in the world could live
without air.

Even plants breathe the air, you know.

Now, there is a little row of holes or pores along each side of the
abdomen of the insect.

These are the breathing pores. No, May, the insects do not breathe
through their mouths, they breathe through their sides.

   

You can see the breathing pores, or spiracles, as they are called, very
plainly in many insects.

You can see them on the abdomen of the locust, and in some caterpillars
they are bright-colored spots.

There are spiracles on the sides of the thorax, too, but they do not
show so plainly as those on the abdomen.

The spiracles open into air tubes that carry air to the blood of the
insect.



If you watch a grasshopper or a bee, you can plainly see it breathe. The
abdomen moves in the bee as though it were panting. These movements of
the abdomen cause the air to go in and out. All insects move their
abdomens to send the air in and out, but it does not show plainly in all
of them, for, though insects need air, some of them can get along with
very little.

Yes, John, insects have blood. It is not just like our blood, but still
it is blood.

It is not generally red in color, though sometimes it is reddish, and
sometimes it is brown, or violet, or even bright green.

Yes, that seems strange to you, but you remember how ears are ears, and
serve to hear with, no matter where on the body of the creature they are
located. So blood is blood, and serves the purpose of blood, no matter
what its color. The blood of some insects has a very bad odor, and in
the case of certain beetles, when they are disturbed, this foul-smelling
liquid oozes out of the joints of the legs.

Yes, Mabel, it is probably used, like the "molasses" of other little
friends we know, to repel enemies.

But to return to breathing. Some larvæ breathe by gills, and do not have
spiracles until they are grown up, but all grown-up insects breathe by
spiracles.

Yes, John, the larvæ of the dragon flies and May flies breathe with
gills.

I thought you would remember that.

The water boatman breathes by spiracles, and carries his supply of air
with him. All grown-up bugs breathe by spiracles.

Now look down into the pond. I think you will see some water boatmen
anchored near the bottom.

Yes, May, they cling by their front feet. Their hind pair of legs are
rather odd-looking; they have a fringe of hairs on the inside.

John says their hind legs are modified to swim with.

Very good, John.

The hind legs are the oars that row these little boats about in the
water.

But why are the little boats that have come to anchor down there moving
their paddles so constantly?

Ah, yes; it is because they want fresh air to breathe.

You know there is always air in pond water, and they keep their paddles
moving, so as to change the envelope of air that surrounds them.

   

They know what to do to take care of themselves, if they _are_ nothing
but little bugs.

When winter comes, they go down to the bottom of the pond and bury
themselves in the mud. They lie there without moving or breathing until
spring, when out they come, as lively as ever.

Yes, certain other animals pass the winter in this way; the bears, for
instance, find a snug den and sleep all through the coldest winter
weather. We call this winter sleep of animals hibernation, and many of
the insects hibernate.

Yes, Ned, hibernating animals can get on with very little air; they
sometimes seem to need none at all, and they take no food.

May wants to know what these queer water boatmen eat.

They suck out the juices of other insects.

They must lay their eggs in the water, little Nell thinks.

And so they do, on water plants.

Near the city of Mexico there are species that lay enormous quantities
of eggs in the ponds, and what do you think? The Indians mix these eggs
with meal, make them into cakes, and eat them.

The Mexican bugs are gathered by the ton, too, and sent to England as
food for cage birds, fish, and poultry.

Little Nell thinks there must be a great many bugs in a ton. Indeed,
there are, probably about twenty-five millions of them; so you can
imagine Mexico is well supplied with water boatmen!

When the young ones hatch out they look like their parents, only, of
course, they are tiny little dots of things that have no wings.

But they eat and grow and moult like other larvæ until they are
full-grown insects.

What have you discovered, Ned? You look surprised.

The water boatman has no antennæ!

It doesn't seem to have any. But look carefully and I think you will
find some tiny ones tucked away under its head.

Nell wants to know if the water boatman has a thorax and an abdomen.

Indeed, it has, but you will have to look carefully to see them. Its
abdomen is short and thick and hard. The water boatman is much more
compact in form than the Orthoptera, or any of the other insects we have
studied.

You are right, John, an insect with a long abdomen, like the
grasshopper, could not get on very well in the water.

Now, May, take the cover off the tumbler. There!

Our water boatman was not slow to make use of his wings.

Well, good-by and good luck to you, little water boatman.

   


What, John? You know a water boatman that swims on its back?

That makes Nell laugh, and no wonder.

Yes, there is a little bug that swims on its back.

   

It is very much like the water boatman, and it has long paddles made of
its queer hind legs.

Unlike the water boatman, however, its back is not flat but is shaped
like the keel of a boat.

This being the case, it just turns over and swims with its keel-shaped
back in the water.

It is sometimes called the back-swimmer, and most boys are well
acquainted with it.

What do you think about catching it in your fingers, Ned?

Ah, you do not like to!

It has a very sharp beak for sucking the life out of other insects, and
if you succeed in getting hold of it, it will stick that into your
finger.

And my! how it does sting!

It is not an easy matter to catch it, however,--it is such a quick
little rascal.




A good many kinds of bugs live in the water, but perhaps the oddest of
all is the giant water bug.

It _is_ a giant!

Have you ever seen very large, flat brown bugs lying on the ground under
the electric street lamps?

Those are the giant water bugs.

They fly in the night from pond to pond, and are attracted by bright
lights.

They fly into the electric lights, and are killed in great numbers
sometimes.

This is such a common habit with them that in some places they are
called electric light bugs.

A good many people never saw these bugs until they were found dead
under the electric lights, and so they imagined they did not exist until
electric lights were invented.

But that is a very foolish notion; the bugs were here thousands of years
before electric lights were dreamed of.

The giant water bugs are not pleasant to handle when alive.

If you ever succeed in catching one in the water, which is not easy,
they slip about so quickly, be sure and not take it in your fingers.

The California children call a species they have there "toe-biters," and
they say they bite their toes when they go in wading.

The giant water bugs are the largest of living bugs, and they even kill
and eat fish.

Their fore legs can shut up like a jackknife. The tibia shuts into a
groove in the femur, and thus the bug is able to seize and hold its
prey.

It clasps its victim in its arms, as it were, and calmly proceeds to
suck out its blood.

In some species of the giant water bugs the female does not leave her
eggs in the pond to take care of themselves; she puts them on the back
of her mate, who is obliged to carry all of his progeny about with him
until they relieve him by hatching out and swimming off to see life for
themselves.




LITTLE MRS. SHORE BUG

   


May says she wants to hear more about bugs. Well, there is little Mrs.
Shore Bug. I think you must all know her.

She is the little bug that flies along in front of you on the seashore,
or, indeed, on the edge of any body of water.

She flits along just in front of you, and is so quick in her motions
that you will hardly ever catch her.

She does not fly far--she alights just far enough ahead to make you try
again to capture her, but when you think you have her, she isn't there!

   

She has sped off on one of her short flights, and so she will continue
to do as long as you continue to chase her.




Then there are the water striders.

They are bugs, and it is easy to guess how they got their name.

You surely remember the longlegged, dark colored fellows that straddle
about on top of the water, in ponds or in still pools in streams?

Who has not tried to catch them!

And how very seldom any one succeeds!

May knows where we can see some water striders close at hand.

They are on the pond in the meadow. Let us go.

Ah, you little ones! There you are, scampering over the water on your
airy, fairy feet, as though you were on dry land.

   

How they flash about! And what cunning dimples their little feet make on
the water when they stand still!

If we keep very quiet, they will stop darting about in that wild way,
and we can see them better.

Now, water striders, why do you behave so, and what do you eat?

Eat? Why, insects, of course. And as to behavior, they may well wonder
more at ours than we at theirs.

They skate about on the surface of the water all summer, and when winter
comes they hide away at the bottom of the pond, right under the water,
or along the edges of the banks.

When the warm spring sunshine wakes up the sleeping plants, then the
little water striders wake up too.

Out they come, to resume their endless skating and insect catching, but
now they lay their eggs, gluing them fast to water weeds.

The young water striders look like their parents, and they, too, like to
go circling and flashing over the top of the water, with their long legs
spread out.





What do you suppose is in this box?

Little Nell may open it.

There, out he comes--slowly, as though he were looking around and
thinking about it.

   

May says, "Hello, Mr. Walking Stick, you here again?"

Ho! ho! _is_ it Mr. Walking Stick?

You look again.

Mollie thinks, if she were going to name it, she would call it Mr.
Walking Threads.

Yes, it is more slender than even the walking stick.

What is that, John? You thought insects had six legs, and this has only
four?

Now, here is something for us to think about.

Ned says it has six long threads that might be legs, but it does not
walk on the two front ones.

It seems to use them as antennæ.

   

Ned says those front ones look to him to be jointed just like the
others, and he thinks they are legs.

Mollie says they have no little feet like the others, and she thinks
they are antennæ.

Well, well, what are we to do? Think of its having feelers that look
like legs or legs that look like feelers, so that you cannot tell which
they are!

Now it is beginning to move, and--Oh, ho, that long part in front is not
its head!

   

See, it separates into two--what?

Surely, two front legs.

See, they were folded up, somewhat like the front legs of the mantis,
only these could fold close together, being threadlike.

So the long threads are antennæ after all.

Now it has raised its head, which we easily see is quite round, with
tiny eyes, and the antennæ are growing out from the front of it.

What is it? A walking stick? A mantis?

   

Why! why! There it goes, sailing off in the air with a queer little
fluttering motion of its whole body.

It has wings!

John has caught it and brought it back.

Now let us see those wings, you strange little creature.

You will have to look close, but there they are, narrow, short, such
tiny wings! How _do_ you suppose it flies with them?

You seem queerer and queerer the more we look at you, little
what-shall-we-call-you.

But we know you are not a walking stick because our walking sticks have
no wings.

The truth is you are a--bug!

Yes, this little threadlike creature belongs to the same order as the
big flat giant water bug.

It grasps its victim, in its fore feet like the mantis, but instead of
biting its prey it sucks out the juices.

You would hardly expect such a delicate creature to catch and kill other
insects, yet such is the case.

No, I do not think it will pierce your finger with its beak. I have
often handled them, and have never been stung by one. We often see them
walking about in the grass and along paths.






IF we pay a visit to that hawthorn bush we shall probably find
a bug to our liking. Yes, here is one.

It is a tiny thing, I know, but wait until you see it under the
microscope.

Ah, I thought you would be pleased!

Nell says it looks as though it had on a lace party dress.

Is it not a dainty fairy!

We call it the lace bug.

It does not suck the juices of other insects, but instead it sucks the
juices of plants.

Its eggs are very curious. It lays them on leaves and glues them fast.
They look like little out-growths of the leaf.

The young lace bugs are like their parents in form, only, of course,
they have no wings and so they are not pretty.

   

Fairy lace bug, we are glad to make your acquaintance.




Now, here is a bug we all loathe. It is round and flat, and reddish
brown in color, and it has a disgusting odor.

But though we hate this bug, it is very fond of us. It has a short,
sharp tube folded down under its head, and this tube it likes to raise
up and stick into the skin of people, and suck out their blood.

It has no wings, only a pair of little scales where its wings should be.
Yes, May, these scales are rudimentary wings, and they are good for
nothing. It once had wings, but it preferred to go slipping about in
cracks and hiding in beds, until in course of time no wings grew, which
served it right.

It has antennæ and eyes and spiracles; indeed, it has everything a bug
should have but wings and good manners.

We call it the bed bug because its favorite home is in beds, so that it
can sally forth at night and feast upon its sleeping victims.

It lays its eggs in cracks and crevices, and each egg is like a little
jar with a rim and a lid at the top. When the young one hatches it
pushes off the lid. The young are in shape like their parents, only they
are very light colored, and almost transparent. They look like ghosts of
bugs, but they are very voracious ghosts indeed, and they eat and moult
and grow and become darker colored until they reach maturity.

One strange thing about them is that they can live a very long time with
nothing to eat, so that houses long vacated may still contain these
nuisances, that sally forth, eager to round out their emaciated forms at
the expense of the new occupants of the house.

The barn swallow is sadly afflicted by a species of these unwelcome
visitors to its nest, and the poor bats are also victimized by a species
of bed bug.

The bad odor comes from a liquid poured out of the back of young bugs,
and from the under side of old ones.

These insects are very undesirable acquaintances, and they breed so fast
that even one, brought into a house, may cause it to become generally
infested in a few weeks.

Eternal vigilance and great cleanliness are the housekeeper's only
safeguards.

There are some species of bugs that closely resemble the bed bugs, only
they have wings, and live on flowers or in the cracks of the bark of
trees.





There are a great many kinds of bugs on the leaves and flowers in
summer, and some of them do much damage by eating the vegetation.

One of the most troublesome of these is the red bug. Here is a picture
of one.

Its wings look as if they had an X drawn on them.

Let us spread out one of the wings.

Why do you all laugh?

Sure enough, Ned, how _can_ we spread out the wings of a bug in a
picture?

   

But there is a way out of that difficulty.

Yes, another picture.

Only the upper wings are spread out.

You see, the half of the wing next the body is stiff like a wing cover,
and the other half is thin and silky, and folds up under the stiff part.
When the insect flies it spreads out the under wings, too, for there is
a pair of thin, flying wings folded on the body under these upper wings.

These upper wings, that are half wing cover and half flying wing, are
characteristic of the bug order.

Not all the bugs have them, but a great many have.

The name of the bug order is HEM-IP-TERA, meaning half-wing.
You see why.

Yes, John, the word "hemiptera" comes from two Greek words, _hemi_,
meaning half, and, as you know, _pteron_, meaning a wing.

The young red bugs are like the old ones, excepting in color.

What do we call the young of insects, little Nell?

Yes, we call them larvæ. These red bug larvæ are bright red with black
legs.

They pierce the cotton plants in the South, and suck out the juices.

Of course, they grow and moult until they arrive at the adult form.

What, John? You do not know what "adult" means? Adult means "grown-up."

It is a short way of saying grown-up; and after this, when we mean a
grown-up insect, let us say an adult insect.

To return to the red bug. When it reaches the adult state, it is not
such a bright red, but rather of a reddish color with brownish wings
striped with light yellow.

Beside eating the juices of the cotton plants and thus injuring or even
killing them, the red bugs stain the white cotton and spoil it.

They are also troublesome in some parts of Florida, where they pierce
the skins of the oranges, and cause the fruit to decay.

   



There are a great many bugs injurious to vegetation, among them the
little chinch bugs.

They are so small, each one no larger than a plant louse, that you would
not think they could do much harm.

One of them could not, but when they appear in millions, then they are
terrible.

Here is one magnified to show the white wing covers with black markings.

   

Would you believe that this tiny insect has destroyed millions of
dollars' worth of grain in the United States?

What, Charlie? you should think they could be killed out? That is a very
difficult task. You see they are so small, and they breed so fast. There
are two broods of them in one year, and when they have eaten one grain
field they start off, millions strong, to another.

Of course a great many methods have been tried for getting rid of them,
and one very curious method you will like to hear about.

You know insects are subject to diseases.

What, Nell, you never heard of a sick bug?

Yet it seems they are sick sometimes, and certain diseases kill them.
Chinch bugs are not as healthy in some places as in others.

There is a contagious disease that kills them off in very great numbers.

Ned says he can guess what remedy the people apply to the healthy chinch
bugs that are eating their grain.

Yes, they introduce diseased chinch bugs into the grain fields with the
healthy ones. The contagion spreads and the bugs die!

There is another way of getting rid of some kinds of troublesome
insects. That is, to introduce an insect not injurious to vegetation,
that will prey upon the injurious ones.






One of the bugs we know the best and like the least is the stink bug.

It deserves its name.

John says he had one on his hand this morning.

How did you like it, John?

Did any of you ever pick berries where these bugs were?

See what a face Mollie is making! It is very evident that _she_ has.



What a nasty taste they give the delicious fruit.

Even the flavor of the red raspberry is spoiled if one of these bugs
pollutes it.

What makes them smell so? May is asking.

The disgusting odor is caused by a liquid that is ejected out of little
pores on the under side of the thorax.

The bug can eject this liquid when it pleases.

Most members of the bug order can eject a disagreeable liquid, though
few of them do it so successfully as the stink bug.

If the stink bug is not disturbed, it does not give forth the bad odor;
but when we jostle the bushes in getting the berries, that startles it,
and we get the benefit of its alarm.

Yes, undoubtedly the bugs make a bad odor for the same reason the
grasshoppers make molasses. They wish to repel their enemies.

Very few birds ever touch a stink bug.

Nell thinks a bird would be crazy to eat a stink bug.

Mollie says if it were not crazy when it began, it surely would be
before it got through!

Not only the bugs make these disagreeable odors.

Many other insects do.

The cockroaches, as we know, and one reason we dislike them so is
because of this offensive odor.

Some species of crickets, too, and indeed many, many insects give forth
odors from glands that exist just for that purpose.

No, indeed, these odors are not all alike. Some have a strangling
quality like ammonia, and sometimes the odors are not disagreeable. Some
insects have sweet odors, like perfumes.

   

The pleasant odors are not used to repel, but to attract.

If an insect wishes to see its mate, it may be able to give forth a
pleasant odor that will reach a long way through the air, and the mate,
smelling it, will follow it to its source. You see, this pleasant odor
is one way of talking; at least it is one way of sending a message.

Insects can detect odors much better than we can.

No doubt many insects produce odors that affect other insects, but that
are so faint we cannot smell them at all.

The sense of smell, even in the human being, is very wonderful. It is
the keenest of all the senses.

You have studied weights and measures, and you know how small a quantity
a grain of anything is. Well, you will be astonished to know that your
nose can detect the presence of 1/2,760,000,000 of a grain of mercaptan,
a substance having a very bad smell.

   

So you see, insects that can smell very, very much better than we would
be greatly influenced by the odors of other insects.

Some of the stink bugs, although so disagreeable if disturbed, are very
useful to us, as they eat other insects injurious to vegetation.

Most of them, however, eat fruits and vegetables, and some species do a
vast amount of mischief.





Yes, John, lice are bugs, and very mean bugs too.

They have lived at the expense of other creatures so long that they
cannot exist unless they have a living body to feed on.

Here is a picture of one very much enlarged. No wings, no beauty, a pale
white thing, all claws and mouth.

   

It has a long sucking tube by which it pierces the skin, and a sucking
stomach by which it pumps the blood into its mouth.

Such creatures are called parasites.

Yes, bed bugs are parasites too.

Besides the lice that live on human beings, there are species that
infest animals.





Bird lice are not lice!

That is, they do not belong to the bug order.

They belong to a small order by themselves, but they are parasites like
the lice.

The little white book lice that scurry away when we open an old book
that has been standing on the back shelf, are not lice, either; they
also belong to a little order of their own, and are constructed very
differently from the true lice.




May says she wishes that locust would keep quiet. It makes her warmer
than ever to hear him carrying on so this hot day.

John says it is the weather that is warm, not the song of the locust.

And yet, locusts generally sing during the hottest part of the summer,
so that we have learned to associate them with warm weather.

Since we must listen to its shrill out-cry, I wish we could also see
it.

Ah, that is a wish soon gratified! Here comes one out of John's pocket.

   

John says it is _not_ a locust.

Ah, yes, the shorthorned grasshoppers are the real locusts, and this
fellow has somehow got the name.

But it is not a locust.

It is also called the dog-day harvest fly, but it is not a fly, though
it looks considerably like one.

Really, you know, it is a--bug!

Yes, it belongs to the bug order.

Its true name is cicada, and its shrill midsummer song has been famous
from the beginning of time.

   

It looks like an enormous fly, but its mouth parts are the mouth parts
of the bug, and in other respects it resembles the members of the bug
order, when it is examined closely.

What glassy wings!

Let us spread them out carefully. Four of them it has.

The cicada, you see, has no wing covers. Nor are its upper wings, half
wing cover, and half wing, like those of so many of the bugs.

No, all four of its wings are alike, and all four are flying wings.

When it is at rest, the inner wings slip out of sight under the outer
ones, which fold down like a roof over its body.

See how beautifully the wings, are veined.

You think cicada has a very broad back, Nell?

So it has, and a broad head.

   

See its black eyes on the corners of its head!

How many facets have its eyes?

I wish I knew, but I do not. This, however, I can tell you. If you look
on the top of its head between its compound eyes, with a magnifying
glass, you will find it has three little eyes there.

These small eyes are simple, and are called _ocelli_.

Many insects have ocelli, indeed, some of the grasshoppers have these
extra eyes on top of their head.

May says the grasshoppers are very astonishing insects.

You think you know all about them, and you are all the time finding out
something new. You would not be apt to notice these little ocelli on the
grasshopper's head, they are so small, and besides, some of the
grasshoppers do not have them.

Yes, Mollie, it is the same with the crickets and katydids. Some species
have ocelli, and some have not.

If you look full in the face of a cicada, you can see the three little
round ocelli between the compound eyes.

   

They show very plainly with a magnifying glass.

Indeed, it is difficult to explain what the ocelli are for.

Some think they are to see objects close at hand, while the compound
eyes see more distant objects.

Others think the ocelli are only capable of distinguishing light from
darkness.

Yet others think they are merely a "survival" of the eyes of the worms.
You know, way back in time, before there were winged insects there were
worms. In some way the insects are descended from the worms, and though
they have got rid of many of their wormlike parts they still retain some
of them, and probably among these are the ocelli.

When an animal of any kind keeps organs that belonged to its ancestors,
but that are of no use to it, we say these organs are "survivals." They
have not yet had time wholly to disappear.

Yes, John, the time may come when the ocelli will disappear from the
insects. A good many insects have lost them already.

Indeed, you are right, May; they have lost them because they did not use
them. When an animal ceases to use an organ in course of time, for lack
of exercise, that organ dwindles away and disappears. It generally takes
a very long time for this to happen.

Yes, Mabel, thousands or even millions of years may pass before an organ
that has gone out of use entirely disappears. As generations succeed
each other each generation loses a little power in that organ until,
finally, there is no organ left.

John is puzzled to know just what is meant by an organ. It is some
particular part of the creature. An arm is an organ, a stomach is an
organ, an eye is an organ. The whole creature is made up of organs, and
is called an _organism_.

Your whole body, John, is an organism, but your legs and arms are
organs. Now, I think you understand.

Our cicada has one organ that is very interesting; it is the little
apparatus by which it sings.

Turn it over, Ned, and all of you look at the two thin plates lying
against the abdomen just below the thorax.

Those membranes are like two little kettle drums, and they are its song
organs.

There are other membranes beneath them, and large muscles within the
body to move the membranes.

The membranes being set in rapid vibration we get the shrill cry of the
locust.

Only the male has the kettle drums. In the female these organs are
rudimentary, and she is dumb.

   

Cicada, you are a pretty little thing with your clear, glasslike wings
and your black body with red and green trimming. See its mouth lying in
that little groove under its head. It is a tube, and sharp. The cicada
sticks it into a leaf or young twig to suck out the juice.

Nell wants to know if the young cicadas are like the old ones. Indeed,
they would be cunning little things if they were, and--yes, they _would_
look very much like flies.

But the young cicadas are queer babies, indeed. They do not look very
much like their parents, although they have a head, a thorax, and an
abdomen.

   

The female cicada makes a slit in the bark of the tree twig with her
ovipositor and lays the eggs there. As soon as they hatch out, the tiny
cicadas drop down to the ground and burrow into the earth.

You would not know that they are cicadas, they are such queer-looking
little things. But they have strong, sucking mouth parts with which they
pierce holes in the roots of trees and suck out the juices.

Of course these larvæ grow and moult and continue to do so until they
have moulted a good many times and grown quite large.

They stay down under the ground two years.

At the end of that time they crawl up to the surface of the earth in the
early summer.

They climb trees, or weeds, or fence posts, and then the skin splits
down the back for the last time, and out comes a full-grown cicada with
bright glassy wings.

The wings of the larva do not grow at each moult like the wings of the
grasshopper.

The larva never gets beyond short little wing pads. See John's eyes
twinkling! I believe--yes, he has! He has brought us the cast-off skin
of a cicada to look at.

   

Why, John, you are like a good fairy to us to-day, giving us just the
things we want just when we want them.

Now, see this little shell. See the front legs, like strong paws to dig
with. And see its little glassy eyes, and its little wing pads!

It is a perfect cast of the cicada larva.

Yes, May, this little cast is made of chitin, and it will last a long
time. Chitin is a very indestructible substance; even fire will not
destroy it, but in course of time the moisture and the acids in the
earth destroy it, so that at last the millions of cicada shells and
grasshopper cast-off skins, which are also of chitin, and cricket
moults, and all the other little cast-aside chitinous overcoats of the
insects, return again to the earth and the air whence they came. The
minerals and gases that compose them let go of each other, as it were,
and the chitin is no longer chitin.

Amy says she has seen these little cicada shells hundreds of times but
did not know what they were.

Yes, we are sure to find them almost every summer.

If we look, we will also find other larvæ shells. Down in the grass are
the cast-off coats of the grasshoppers and the crickets.

All we need do is to look, and we shall be sure to find them--like
unsubstantial ghosts of the active little wearers.

No doubt you all have heard of the seventeen-year locusts. They, too,
are cicadas, and they look very much like this one, only it takes the
young ones seventeen years to complete their growth.

Think of living in the ground and sucking the juices out of the earth
and of tree roots for seventeen years!

   

How would you like to do it?

But no doubt the cicada is quite happy living in this way.

At the end of seventeen years the cicadas come up out of the earth in
great swarms.

They cast their skins for the last time. The queer little shells are
seen everywhere, and the air resounds with the songs of the freed
prisoners.

In the South it takes only thirteen years for these cicadas to develop.

   

I once went up the side of a beautiful mountain in North Carolina, where
was such a mighty host of cicadas in the trees that I could not hear my
companion speak, and a little way off the noise sounded like a torrent
of rushing water.




Why, little Nell! What is the matter?

You do wish the frogs would stop spitting on the grass?

Let me see; why, poor child, she is all covered with frog spittle.

That is kind, Ned. See, he is wiping her apron off with some fresh,
clean leaves. Let us rest awhile under this shady tree.

John, pick that grass blade with the frog spittle on it. Be careful not
to disturb it.

   

There is a surprise in store for you; this white frothy substance that
is so abundant in some places in the summer and that looks like spittle
is--guess what?

Frog spittle, May says. So you think the frogs spit on the grass do you?
They must be tall frogs to reach up so high.

With this little twig let us carefully brush away the white froth.

Now see.

Yes, there is something in the centre of it.

It is the larva of a--bug!

   

The female bug, and here is one of the little things, lays the egg on
the leaf or twigs, and when it hatches the young bug sucks out the sap
of the plant which finally appears as this white froth.

The larva remains surrounded by the froth until its transformations are
complete.

Just before the last moult it stops sucking out sap. The froth dries
about it in the form of a little room, and in this it undergoes its last
moult and comes out--an adult bug.

The froth is supposed to be used as a protection, and it may be against
some enemies, but there are certain wasps that delight in invading the
frothy masses and hauling out the unwilling morsels within to feed to
their young.

No, little Nell, the frogs have nothing whatever to do with this frothy
substance which was called frog spittle before people understood about
the little insect that made it.

They really thought the frogs did it.

The adult spittle insect is called a frog hopper, and it has the power
of leaping very well.

   



Just see this bush! Be careful not to shake it.

It is covered with such pretty, bright-colored little insects.

   

There, May ran against the bush and see--they are hopping wildly off in
every direction.

Yes, little Nell, they do sound like rain drops pattering on the leaves.

They are prettier than the spittle insects and more slender, but they
hop about in very much the same way.

The larvæ do not make froth, however.

These are the leaf hoppers.

What big heads they have!

And how daintily their green forms are pencilled with red lines.

There are a great many species of the leaf hoppers, and not all of them
are as pretty as these.

   

Some of them are very small indeed, and some do great damage to the
grain crops and the fruits.

They suck out the juices of the plants.

If you sweep the insect net over bushes or through the grass in
midsummer, you will be pretty sure to draw in a good collection of leaf
hoppers.

Most of us are only too well acquainted with the rose-leaf hopper that
swarms on rose bushes and kills the leaves. If we have not noticed the
insect itself, we have not failed to notice the little white skins that
it has cast off and left clinging to the leaves.

Yes, these are the little skins it discards when it moults.

John says we can kill them by washing the bushes with strong soap suds.

   

Ned says it is better yet to spray them.

It is better and also easier to spray them than to wash them.

You know there are machines for spraying trees and other plants. They
consist of a tank to hold the liquid that is to be sprayed and a pump to
force it through a rubber pipe with a sprinkler at the end.

Very often a mixture of soap and kerosene oil, known as "kerosene
emulsion," is used to spray with.

Paris green and blue vitriol, both very poisonous, are often used on
grape vines before the grapes are formed, and very gaudy vines they are
for a little while after this bright poison has been sprayed upon them.

Although insects are so very interesting, we have to protect ourselves
against many species in order to live.

Yes, John, it is oftentimes merely a question which shall profit by the
crops we plant, the insects or ourselves.

Sometimes the insects win, sometimes we win, but it is a closely
contested warfare all the time.

We plough the land and take care of it, we plant the seeds and keep out
the weeds. Then, when we have a fine crop growing, along come certain
destructive insects, feeling very happy, no doubt, to have found such a
feast.

Now the fight begins. They attack the crop, we attack them. We spray
them with poisons, burn up their eggs, do everything we know how to get
rid of them.

Wise men have spent many years of close study finding out the habits of
the insects destructive to grains and fruits, in order to be able to
destroy them.

Although many of the plant hoppers are such nuisances to us, there is
one family of hoppers that is seldom a nuisance.




Do you know the tree hoppers,--absurd little jokers that they are?

Oh, yes, they are hard and three cornered, like animated beechnuts, as
somebody has said.

Yes, some of them have humps on their backs and some have horns.

   

John says he once made a collection of tree hoppers and put them in a
box with a reading glass over the top, and showed them to his friends to
make them laugh.

May says she saw them, and they reminded her of Brownies.

Would it not be fun to have a tree hopper Brownie book!

The tree hoppers jump about on the bushes and eat the juices of the
plants, but there are not usually enough of them to do damage. They
seldom come in swarms like some of the leaf hoppers, though sometimes
they do.




THE JUMPING PLANT LICE


The jumping plant lice are nearly related to the tree hoppers, but they
do not look at all like them.

Under the magnifying glass they look like tiny cicadas.

See, here is a picture of one enlarged.

   

Their natural size is no larger than a plant louse.

Have you not often seen them clustered close together on the young twigs
of pear trees--tiny, light-colored things that jumped in all directions
when you touched the twig?

The name of the plant louse that infests pear trees is the pear-tree
psylla. It is very destructive to pear trees, sucking out the juices of
the young shoots.

The pear trees can be saved by spraying them with kerosene emulsion as
soon as the young leaves have opened in the spring.





Now, let us go in search of the aphids, or aphides, as they are also
called. We shall not have to search far.

   

In a very dry season we generally need not search at all. All we need do
is to examine the nearest weed to find plenty of aphides.

Yes, they are the little plant lice that seem at times to cover every
growing thing.

Sometimes they are green, sometimes brown, or gray, or reddish, in
color.

They are tiny creatures, but what they lack in size they more than make
up in numbers.

Go now, and find some aphides.

Ah, here you all come, each bearing a leaf or a twig on which are
aphids.

There was no trouble in finding them!

They do not hop like the jumping plant lice when they are disturbed.
They remain where they are unless they are very much shaken up.

See, most of them are without wings, though here are a few with
beautiful transparent wings.

Antennæ they have, long and threadlike. And see, the knowing little
eyes!

They seem to be anchored to the leaf.

Hold the leaf up to the light, and see if you can discover what they are
doing.

Ah, see those mouth tubes firmly stuck into the leaf. There they stand
all day long and suck out the juice.

   

Ned says he should think they would burst.

But they do not; they grow. And they also get rid of a large part of the
superfluous sap in a curious way.

They use what they need to grow on, and the rest escapes from the
insect's body in the form of "honey dew." It is a sweet liquid of which
ants and bees are very fond.

What, John, you have heard that the aphids give out honey dew from two
little horns near the tip of the abdomen?

Let us see if we can find these horns. Yes, we can see them plainly, and
_very_ plainly with a magnifying glass.

But now listen; the honey dew does not come from the horns. On the end
of some of the horns, or tubes, we can see a drop of clear liquid.

For a long time people believed this was honey dew, but instead, it is a
waxy substance which is not sweet.

It has been very carefully studied by wise men who tell us it contains
no sugar and is probably used as a means of defence, as aphides have
been seen to smear the faces of insect enemies with this wax.

There are a great many species of aphides, and not all of them have the
little tubes or horns on their backs. But probably many that have no
horns give forth honey dew.

It is really a waste substance from the body of the aphid.

Ants are so fond of the honey dew that certain species of aphides have
been called the _ants' cows_, because the ants take care of them for the
sake of the honey dew.

Some ants protect the aphids from their enemies. They drive off those
insects that would devour the aphids, and when winter comes these ants
carry the aphids down into their warm nests under ground, and keep them
safe through the cold weather.

The aphides cannot stand wet weather, but after a long spell of dry
weather they will be found in great abundance.

   

Sometimes they eat so fast and so much that the honey dew falls like a
shower from the trees upon which they are. It covers the ground beneath
and the leaves of plants, and makes everything very sticky and
disagreeable to the touch. The dust settles on it, too and a growth
something like mould often turns it black--as we find to our discomfort.

But when the honey dew is fresh the bees love it. They collect large
quantities of it and make it into honey. Squirrels like it to.

It is great fun to watch the nimble squirrel folk sitting in the trees
and holding a leaf between their little hands while they lick off the
honey dew.

Children sometimes suck the honey dew from the leaves in back country
places, where sugar is scarce and where candy is seldom to be had.

Which side of the leaf does the aphid prefer?

Yes, it is on the under side always.

I wonder why.

John says the aphides would be better protected in case of a shower.

Ned says the skin is tenderer on the under side and easier to pierce.

Mollie thinks they want to be in the shade out of the hot sunshine.

I should not wonder if all of these reasons were right.

My little aphid, how many wings have you when you have any?

Yes, little Nell, they have four of the daintiest, prettiest little
wings you ever saw.

   

True enough, most of them have no wings at all.

   

John thinks those must be young ones.

Sometimes they are, but not always. Many of the adult aphids have no
wings.

The aphids are very curious insects, and when you are older I hope you
will remember to study them carefully.

No, John, not all species of aphides make honey dew.

Some form instead a white, powdery substance that is seen scattered over
the body.

May says that must be the kind she has.

Let us see. Yes, May's aphids produce the white powder instead of honey
dew.

That is _their_ way of getting rid of the waste matter.

May says she is glad to know that; she thought her aphids had something
the matter with them. They seemed to be falling to pieces.

No, May, they are not falling to pieces; that powder can all be rubbed
off, and there are your aphids whole and sound beneath it.

Do you know that some species of your funny little tree hoppers secrete
honey dew also, and even have ants to attend them? See if you can find
some of these this summer.

Sometimes aphids live on the roots of plants as well as on the leaves.

Yes, indeed, May, they are very destructive insects. We have to spray
our house plants to get rid of them, and often our garden flowers as
well, and they do a great deal of damage to fruits and vegetables, and
one of them, the phylloxera, has nearly destroyed the vineyards of
France. It lives on the leaves of some species of grapes and on the
roots of others. We have to be very careful about getting grape vines
from Europe to plant in this country on account of the phylloxera.

   

What have you found now, John? Ah, yes, an alder branch, with a white,
cottony substance on it. You have been poking into it with a little
stick, and you think there are insects beneath it.

What, May, you always thought that white stuff was a plant growth, like
mould?

We can easily find out. Get out some of the little things inside if you
can, John. It is not easy to separate them from their cottony covering
without crushing them, but now we can see quite well with the magnifying
glass--and yes--you see they are little insects.

We call them the woolly aphids.

They also secrete honey dew.

You say the ground below the alder bush was all sticky and black, John?

That was the honey dew, blackened by a little plant something like
mould, that grows on it.

We often see woolly plant lice in the summer-time on different plants,
and one species injures apple trees. It gets on the roots as well as on
the tender bark of young trees and kills them.

Yes, indeed, Mollie, the aphids are bugs. They belong to the bug order,
which is a very large and important insect family, and contains some
members that are exceedingly troublesome to us.




What, May, you are tired out?

What have you been doing?

Oh, yes, washing the scales off the leaves of your mother's window fern.

   

It must indeed have been a task; what did you wash them off with? Why
did you use soap suds?

Because your mother told you to; well, that is a good reason, but why do
you think she told you to use soap suds?

You say you don't know, but you think very likely these scales are some
sort of bug, as everything nowadays seems to be bugs.

Well, I don't know about everything being bugs, but those scales
certainly are. They are scale bugs.

Did you stop to look at them under the magnifying glass?

   

No, but you brought a piece of the fern for us to look at.

It will be necessary to put it under the microscope.

There, now look.

Yes, that scale looks like a tiny mussel shell; but look carefully, and
you will see it has legs.

Lift it up with the point of a pin, and under it you will find a mass of
eggs. Yes, Ned; it is like a quantity of eggs under a dish cover.

The cover is the female scale bug, and she has laid all those eggs.

Yes, the scales we see on so many plants are the scale bugs.

They are not all alike in shape, or size, or color; here is a different
kind, you see.

   

But they are all very prolific; that is to say, they produce a great
many young, and do it in a short time.

Yes, John, the tiny, dark-colored scales that look like little oyster
shells on the skins of oranges are a form of scale bug, and a very
troublesome one, too, to the orange grower.

But though most of these insects are troublesome, the family is redeemed
by a few members that are of great value to us.

One of these is the scale bug that supplies shellac, and all that comes
from it to our markets. These curious bugs give forth a resinous
substance that envelops the eggs and glues them to the twigs whose
juices the bug sucks out. It is this resinous substance that is
collected by breaking off the twigs where the insects are. It is used
for varnishes, as you know, and for polishing wood and other substances.

There are other scale bugs that secrete wax, and some of them produce it
so abundantly, and of such good quality, that it has become an article
of commerce. China wax, which is wax of a very fine quality, is secreted
by a Chinese scale bug, and the wax is used for making fine candles, as
well as for other purposes.

In Mexico we have the cochineal insect, which is a scale bug that lives
on a cactus that grows in Mexico.

Like many others of the scale bugs, the cochineal males have wings and
are not so scalelike as their helpless mates.

But they are of no use to us. It is only the female cochineal we use.

She is raised in great numbers in cactus gardens planted on purpose.

Here is the picture of a cactus with cochineal insects upon it.

   

These insects contain a very brilliant, red coloring matter that is used
by us in dyeing leather and wool, and in making paints. The insects are
gathered and dried, and thus sent to market.

Although a few of them are useful to us, the scale bugs, on the whole,
are a serious pest; and they are found on nearly all kinds of plants all
over the world.

You should think all the plants would soon be gone, so many insects eat
them?

Well, they would, only other things eat the insects.

Insects have a great many enemies, after all.

Sometimes the weather is bad for them, the season is too hot or too
cold, too wet or too dry, and then they do not appear in large numbers.

Sometimes one kind of insect eats another kind.

Sometimes tiny plants, like moulds, grow on the insects and kill them;
and birds destroy a very large number.

If the farmers only knew how much good the birds do them, they would
never allow one to be killed. Even the crows that pull up their corn are
worth many times the corn they eat in the insects they destroy. There is
scarcely a bird but what is of value to the farmer.

The hawks that catch his chickens catch more mice and moles in his
fields, than chickens in his barn-yard.

And as for the robins, the blue jays, and all the small birds, they do
more to save the growing plants, than all the soap suds and kerosene
emulsion that were ever made.

No one should ever shoot a bird. The birds are our natural protectors
against the vast armies of insects, that, but for the birds, would soon
destroy us by eating up our food plants.

What is that, May? You belong to an Audubon Society for the protection
of the birds?

Yes, I know you do, and so do John and Ned and Mollie and little Nell.

I wish every child in the United States belonged to the Audubon Society.
Then our birds would be safe. They would never be killed as they are now
for foolish women to wear on their hats.

When the Audubon Society children grew up they would not wear dead
birds, of course, and their children would be taught better, so that
after a while the Audubon Society people would be the only ones left,
and so the birds would be safe.

Let us get as many people to belong to the Audubon Society as we can.

What is that, Amy? You have learned more interesting things about birds
in the Audubon Society than you ever knew in your life before?

Yes, I am sure you have, and what could be lovelier to study about than
the birds.

What is that you are saying, Ned? You love to go bird hunting? Ah, I see
your eyes twinkle, sir; I know how you go hunting. You hunt with your
mother's opera glass! That is the proper way to hunt birds.

We can learn more from watching one bird with a glass than we could from
shooting a hundred.

But you do shoot them, John? Yes, I know about that, too. I know what
kind of a shooting instrument you got for Christmas, sir, and I have
seen the birds you shot!

Yes, nearly all of us have seen them, and how well he does it!

What, Amy, you think John ought to be ashamed of himself to go about
shooting birds, and we ought to be ashamed of ourselves to talk so about
it?

There, now, don't be vexed with Amy, children. She has known us but a
little while, and she has not seen John's birds, so I do not wonder she
feels indignant.

What is that, May? You have one of John's birds right here in your
school-bag? Show it to Amy.

Isn't it pretty! It is a very charming photograph of a catbird on its
nest.

You see John shoots birds with a camera! His father gave him a beautiful
one for Christmas, and he has made good use of it.

How long did it take you to get that bird, John?

Just hear! He spent more than a week getting acquainted with the bird so
it would sit still on the nest while he took its picture.

I am sure that was a week well spent.

John says he feels better acquainted with the catbird than he would have
been if he had read fifty books about it.

And I am sure he is right. The only way to enjoy a bird and to know it,
is to watch it alive.

A camera is the very best gun in the world for catching birds. And it is
really much better fun to take their pictures than to shoot and kill
them.

It seems to me we have strayed a long way from bugs.

May says she thinks birds are much more interesting than bugs.

That may be, but still we want to know about bugs, too.

Do you think you will know a bug when you see it now?

No, I do not believe you can be sure of that. But at least you know
something about a few bugs.

Some day you will study more carefully how insects are formed, and then
you will understand better how we decide what order they belong to.

We group together the insects that are most like each other.

   



No more bugs, if you please.

We are to make the acquaintance of another order of insect folk this
time.

   

I think we can find some worthy members of this new order if we go with
John to a brook he knows of.

Here we are, and it certainly is a lovely brook, whether we find a
dobson in it or not.

Yes, Nell, the dobson is the new insect we shall try to find.

Now, be careful and not get your clothes too wet, but we have to turn
over the stones along the edge of the brook until we find what we are
after.

Mollie wants to know how she is to know it if she finds it.

Well, Mollie, whatever you find that is interesting you must show us.
Even though it is not what we are searching for, we shall enjoy seeing
it.

Look at little Nell! She has tumbled into the brook. Her foot slipped,
and down she went.

Don't cry, deary, you are not wet enough to do any harm. The warm sun
will soon dry you.

No, indeed, you will not have to go home.

   

Perhaps you will be the first one to find a dobson after all.

Hurrah! hurrah! hear John shout!

He must have found the first dobson.

Yes, he has.

What, May? It is a horrid monster, and you have a good mind to scream?

Well, scream if you want to; that won't do any harm.

It _isn't_ pretty! but we shall like to look at it. You see it is a
larva and a big one, dark gray in color and with a thick leathery skin.

Mollie says it reminds her a little of the larva of the May fly; that
is, in shape.

Let us look at a picture of the May-fly larva.

You see it has a head, a thorax to which is attached the six legs and
the rudimentary wings, and an abdomen, all distinctly separated from
each other.

   

The dobson has a head, but no thorax.

The body behind the head is divided into segments that all look very
much alike, and there is a pair of legs attached to each of the first
three segments.

The dobson eats other larvæ that it chews up with its strong jaws.

It lives almost three years in the larval state, so you see it has
plenty of time in which to grow. Of course it moults. It is usually to
be found under stones in swift, running water. Those two pairs of hooks
at the tip of its body are its anchors.

It clasps them about a bit of stone or a stick that is firmly lodged,
and then it can bid defiance to the swirling stream.

Ned wonders why it is always found hiding under stones.

Listen to John, he says fishes are very fond of dobsons, and that is why
they hide away.

Fishermen hunt the dobsons for bait; so you see they have a hard time in
spite of their large size and their strong jaws.

When they have lived nearly three years in the water they crawl out on
the bank and hollow out a place under a stone.

Here they lie, apparently dead, but they are not dead.

They are undergoing a wonderful transformation.

It takes about a month for this transformation, or _metamorphosis_, as
it is called, to be completed.

All of our other insect friends have changed gradually from larval to
adult form. At each moult they became a little more like their parents,
and finally at the last moult, without any resting period, out sprang
the perfect insect.

Not so the dobson. It goes into its hole in the bank a larva, almost
exactly like the larva that hatched from the egg, only, of course, it is
larger. There is no hint of wings. It has no separate thorax and
abdomen. Could we see under the bank where it has crept, to undergo its
great metamorphosis, we should find, not a larva, but a strange-looking,
motionless object.

   

Here is the picture of one. See its little wing pads. And now it has a
thorax and an abdomen.

It seems to have changed and been turned to some hard substance.

In this state it is called the _pupa_, which means doll. Is it not a
cunning insect doll? But it is not really a doll. Although so still and
apparently lifeless, yet it lives.

Some day it will burst its pupa shell and pull itself out--not a larva
now, not a pupa, but a strong-winged insect.

In its adult form, it is known as the horned corydalus.

There! I thought John was saving one for us. He had it in a box in his
pocket. Now see what a--a--what shall I say? A beauty? or a monster?
That is just as you feel about it.

It certainly is an alarming-looking insect.

This one is a male, as we can tell by the long, curved jaws that look
very dangerous; but in this instance the creature's appearance is worse
than its bite, and the real biter is the female whose jaws are smaller
but very useful in nipping tormentors or biting prey.

Now here she is--a fit mate for her formidable-looking companion.


John, you were fortunate in your hunting.

In spite of its terrifying appearance, see what wonderful wings the
corydalus has.

See! John has spread out the wings of the female.

They are indeed beautiful.

May cannot understand how those great wings came out of those little
wing pads.

When the wings were first pulled out of the wing pads they were small,
but they rapidly expanded and became thin and broad and long as the air
touched them.

You will understand that better after a while.

The corydalus differs from all the other insects we have studied, in its
metamorphosis.

It begins life far more unlike its parents than the other insects we
have been looking at, for they had the thorax and abdomen distinct from
the beginning. Instead of changing gradually and remaining active all
the time up to the final metamorphosis, our corydalus goes into the pupa
state, and in that motionless condition transforms to the perfect
insect.

This is called a complete metamorphosis.

When the change is gradual, without any pupa form, any stopping place as
it were, the change is said to be an incomplete metamorphosis.

Yes, the metamorphosis of the grasshoppers is incomplete, and of the
katydids and the crickets and all the other insects we have studied
until we came to the dobson.

Another name for the larva of insects that undergo an incomplete
metamorphosis is _nymph_. Some books speak of the nymph of the
grasshopper, and never of the larva of the grasshopper. Such books use
the word _larva_ only in speaking of the young of insects that undergo a
complete metamorphosis.

Yes, Ned, they would speak of the nymph of the dragon fly, and the nymph
of the May fly and the nymph of the cricket and the katydid, but they
would speak of the larva of the corydalus.

Egg, nymph, adult,--those are the stages of insects that have an
incomplete metamorphosis.

Egg, larva, pupa, adult,--those are the stages of insects that have a
complete metamorphosis.

No, it is not wrong to say larva instead of nymph. I only want you to
know how the word nymph is used, so that when you see it in reading
about insects you will know what it means.

The corydalus lays its eggs near the water, and it lays a great
many--sometimes nearly three thousand. Think of that! The young larvæ
crawl into the water as soon as they are hatched, and those that escape
the hungry fishes grow into these large larvæ and finally metamorphose
into the big-horned corydalus.

It is such a remarkably fierce-looking creature that it has received
many names that are neither complimentary nor beautiful, such as
conniption bug, alligator, and dragon, and numerous others equally
expressive.

Now, we must go home. Let us put the dobson back into the brook.

It does no harm, and we will not kill it.

Yes, Ned, there are smaller insects like the corydalus that are near
relatives to it, and I am sure you have often seen them.



Here is our little Lacewing.

   

May says it is a darling, like a woodland fairy clad all in green.

And, oh, its eyes! Are they not beautiful? They shine like gold.

Do its wings not remind you a little of the wings of the corydalus?

May says no, indeed; that has ugly brown wings.

But look again, May. See how these wings are veined, and do you not
remember how you admired the silvery wings of the corydalus when we
spread them out?

Yes, it belongs to the same order as the corydalus.

The name of the insect order to which they both belong is Neuroptera,
from _neuron_, a nerve, and _pteron_--who remembers what _pteron_ means?

Yes, a wing. Nerve-winged.

What does that mean?

It means that the wings are crossed by many nerves or veins. Yes, that
is what gives them their lacelike appearance.

Pretty golden eye, why do we not oftener see you on the trees and
bushes? It is only by accident we found you to-day, down in the grass.

The truth is, this pretty fairy hides by day and comes out at night to
lay its eggs. Like the May fly, the adult lacewing does not eat. It is a
helpless little beauty, though it has one powerful means of defence, as
you will discover if you touch it.

Ah, yes; you have already detected it! It gives forth such an offensive
odor that nothing, one should think, could have the hardihood to eat it.

May says she supposes the larva of the lacewing is a little monster like
that of the corydalus.

But you will not expect to find it as large as a dobson.

I think if we hunt about a little, we can find one.

Here is one on the leaf. See what a little fellow! And how fast it runs!

   

We shall have to take it captive, in order to get a chance to see it.

It is a funny little larva, with jaws that are _tre-men-dous_ for one of
its size.

Why do you suppose it has such jaws?

May says, for the usual reason, to eat up other larvæ.

Yes; but wait till I tell you another name for this larva.

It is also called the aphis lion.

Aphis, you know, is the same as aphid, or plant louse. In other words it
is the plant-louse lion.

Ah, yes; you are quite willing it should devour the aphids.

And it does. It is very fond of them, though it will also devour any
unlucky insect it is strong enough to overcome.

It has a terrible appetite, this child of the pretty lacewing.

It would even eat its brothers and sisters before they hatched out of
the egg if it could get at them.

The pretty lacewing knows what an appetite her ever hungry larvæ will
have, and so she protects them against each other.

Clever little mother! she lays the eggs in such a way that the larvæ
that hatch out first cannot devour the rest of the eggs.

How do you think she manages it?

Here are some of her eggs on this leaf.

Yes, John; each one is on top of a slender stalk.

The stalk is of stiff silk.

There they are, like a little forest, with an egg for each tree top.

   

When an egg hatches the young aphis lion drops down to the leaf and runs
about like a ravening lion seeking some living thing to devour.

Above his head, quite unsuspected by him, are the eggs out of which his
brothers and sisters have not yet hatched.

What a feast he could have if he knew about it!

And what a sad little cannibal he would be!

The larva of the aphis lion has no distinct thorax. Its legs are
attached to the upper segments of the body, and its metamorphosis is
like that of the corydalus.

When about to become a pupa, it makes for itself a little covering of
white silk. Here it lies quite motionless and undergoes the final
transformation.

Yes, its metamorphosis is complete.

It bites an opening through its silken walls, and out steps--not the
hungry, little, all-devouring aphis lion, but this elegant lady with her
pale-green lacelike wings and her large, golden eyes.

You see the aphis lion is our very good friend.

It helps us get rid of the aphids, and we should never kill a lacewing
or a child of the lacewing.




John has found something he wants us all to see.

We will go with him.

Now we will sit down on this sand bank and look at what he has to show
us. See! those smooth little funnels in the sand.

   

Those are what we have come out to see.

Let us watch them a while.

Mollie says an ant is walking close to the rim of the funnel she is
watching. Now the ant slips over the edge and slides down the smooth
sides of the funnel.

And see! from the bottom of the funnel leap out two curved jaws
and--good-by, ant!

The ant has been dragged down out of sight through a hole in the bottom
of the funnel.

What a strange proceeding!

Who can be living down there at the bottom of the funnel?

We are sorry to disturb such a pretty piece of work, but we shall have
to dig out one of the funnels. We shall have to be quick, too.

There, there, under the trowel! No, it is gone. There it is again. Dig
fast, Ned. That is right. He has put it with a trowelful of sand into
our box.

We will gently shake out the sand until we uncover it.

Mabel says it is just what she thought it was--a larva.

Yes, it is a larva.

   

You see it looks a little like the lacewing larva, and it, too, belongs
to the Neuroptera.

What jaws!

How do you suppose it makes its tunnel?

If we give it plenty of sand, and keep very quiet, perhaps it will go to
work.

There! it is throwing the sand about.

May says it is using its own head as a trowel. Yes, it is shovelling the
sand away with its head.

Why is Ned laughing? Oh, see the ant lion he is watching! An ant slid
part way down its funnel and tried to climb out again, and the ant lion
down below is flinging sand at it.

There! it has succeeded in making the poor ant slip; down it goes, and
now the ant lion has seized it and dragged it down under the ground.

It is easy to find these pit-falls of the ant lion in sand banks in the
summer-time.

Yes, May, the ant lions eat many ants, and they moult and grow, and,
finally, they, too, make a little cocoon about themselves.

Yes, the little silken room they weave we call a cocoon, but the ant
lions make theirs of silk and sand.

   

Within the cocoon they become motionless pupæ, and finally appear as
silver-winged little creatures that bear no resemblance to the
large-jawed, ever hungry, ant lion.

May says she thinks the Neuroptera differ from all the other orders in
the way the larvæ transform.

That is true, May, they do.

In no other order that we have studied do the insects go into the pupal
state to undergo the final transformation.

Who remembers what the young of insects that undergo an incomplete
metamorphosis are sometimes called?

Dear me, you all remember!

Yes, the young are sometimes called nymphs.

The nymphs do not change into pupæ.

The young grasshoppers do not change into motionless pupæ, they just
keep on growing until they are perfect adults.

Young grasshoppers are sometimes called nymphs instead of larvæ.

   



Here we are in the woods again.

How sweet it smells!

Let us sit down by this brook and look into it.

It is such a clear little stream, with fine sand and little pebbles at
the bottom.

What has Nell found that pleases her so?

She says she sees some little bars of sand moving about.

Ned says they are not sand bars but tubes of sand, containing a little
live thing.

The truth is, this sand bag is a house, and its occupant is a larva.

   

See the black head come popping out, and the tiny fore legs.

The larva does not come entirely out, you see, but pulls its house along
with it, and when it is frightened it pops back into its little stone
case.

Mollie says it reminds her of a hermit crab.

A hermit crab, you know, lives on the seashore and takes possession of
an empty snail shell for a house.

It comes partly out dragging its house with it, but if you disturb it,
it draws back, sometimes quite out of sight.

   

This little larva lives in a house, too, but it is a house of its own
making.

It is the larva of the caddice fly, or case fly.

Let us put one of these little sand cases in the saucer here.

Please fill the saucer about half full of water, John. Thank you.

Now, Mollie, I see you have picked up a fine big caddice case.

Put it in the saucer, and let us watch the larva crawl about.

   

It never comes entirely out of the case, you see. It holds on to it with
the hinder part of its body.

Its little black head is hard, but its body is soft, and that is why it
does not like to expose itself to hungry larvæ that might be living in
the water.

May says she wants to see the whole larva.

Suppose we carefully break away the little sand case.

No, indeed, little Nell, we are not going to hurt the larva; we are only
going to open its house.

   

There, the larva is outside now, and you can see what a tender, pale
little thing it is.

It does not like to have its soft body exposed.

See! it is already gathering little bits of sand together.

It seems to be sticking them fast to its body.

It is really binding them together by a saliva-like substance from its
mouth.

It draws out little glistening threads that harden into silk as soon as
they touch the water.

Queer saliva you think.

But the caddice larva does not find it queer. It is used to saliva that
hardens into silk.

Yes, that is the way the larva of the aphis lion and of the ant lion
made their cocoons. They spun out silk in this manner.

The caddice larva makes its house of silk and sand and also lines it
with a beautiful covering of fine silk.

Yes, May, it papers its walls with silk.

You see it did not hurt the caddice larva to take away its house; it
immediately went to work to build another.

Why not pull it out, instead of breaking its house to pieces?

Because if it had been pulled hard enough to come out, it might have
been torn to pieces, it is such a tender little thing, and it holds fast
so tightly.

So the best way to remove it safely is to break its case bit by bit from
around it.

It does no harm to break its case if one is careful. It will soon build
another.

Yes, this larva has no distinct thorax. It is like the larvæ of the
dobson, the aphis lion, and the ant lion in that respect.

   

See! John has found one whose tube is made of quite large stones as
compared with this tube of fine sand that we have broken open.

Some caddice larvæ build houses of wood instead of stone. They stick
little twigs together, and some use little pieces of leaves.

Others again use tiny snail shells which, as you can imagine, make very
pretty cases.

   

Our little caddice has made a neat little house of fine sand grains very
nicely put together.

Some others make much rougher houses.

You will be apt to find the caddice larvæ in any brook and in some
ponds, and I hope you will always look for them.

Notice the tracery in the soft mud of the brook.

Those lines that look as though some one had been ornamenting the bottom
of the brook are made by our caddice larvæ.

   

They drag their cases along and thus make these lines.

Sometimes such lines are made by the little fresh-water snails; but you
can always find the decorator by following along the lines he makes.

What, May? How is the delicate larva able to cling to the case tightly
enough to pull it along? If you look at it very carefully, you will find
a pair of tiny hooks at the tail end by which it can hold on to the silk
lining; and some caddice larvæ have hard points on their backs which
help them to hold fast.

The caddice larvæ are carnivorous; that is, they eat animal food.

Yes, May, their food is usually the larvæ of other insects, but you will
be glad to know that some of them eat plants too.

They eat the larvæ of the May flies when they can find them and no doubt
they build these strong cases about themselves to prevent the May fly
larvæ from returning the compliment.

Frank has found some empty cases, yes, and some that are closed at both
ends.

Now, let us look at this one closed at both ends. What do you suppose is
in it?

We will open just one of these closed cases.

There! It is a pupa! Yes, Nell, a very pretty doll is this.

   

It has a thorax, you see, and an abdomen. Its long antennæ lie close to
its body as do its little wing pads.

Yes, the caddice larva grows and moults in the usual way. It keeps
adding to its house as it grows longer. Finally, it closes the end of
its little tube and lies quite still.

You know what happens next. Its wormlike form divides into thorax and
abdomen. Legs and wings appear, attached to the thorax. In short, it is
no longer a wormlike creature.

Finally, it comes forth from its case. It never goes into it again.

   

It does not need to, for now it is a dainty little nun, with a long,
tan-colored cloak. Its cloak, of course, is its wings folded down about
its body. Like the fairy May flies it has no mouth and eats nothing in
the adult form.

It looks like a dainty brown moth as it flutters about the bushes and
goes flying up and down the brook.

You will always find these little brown-cloaked figures flitting about
the brooks, where the caddice larvæ live.

You see the caddice undergoes a complete metamorphosis.

No, it does not belong to the Neuroptera.

Examine its wings very carefully. Look at them through the magnifying
glass, and you will see they are clothed with hairs.

So these are the hair wings.

The name of the order to which they belong is Trichoptera, from
_pteron_, a wing, and _thrix_, a hair.

Sometime you must take a caddice larva from its house and put it in a
saucer of water with fine bits of mica, which you know is another name
for the isinglass that makes the little windows in our stoves.

If you are fortunate, your caddice will build for itself a little glass
house, through whose walls you can look and see what is going on inside.

The Unique Adventures of the WOGGLE-BUG

ONE day Mr. H. M. Woggle-Bug, T. E., becoming separated from his
comrades who had accompanied him from the Land of Oz, and finding that
time hung heavy on his hands (he had four of them), decided to walk
down the Main street of the City and try to discover something or other
of interest.

The initials "H. M." before his name meant "Highly Magnified," for this
Woggle-Bug was several thousand times bigger than any other woggle-bug
you ever saw. And the initials "T. E." after his named meant "Thoroughly
Educated"--and so he was, in the Land of Oz. But his education, being
applied to a woggle-bug intellect, was not at all remarkable in this
country, where everything is quite different than Oz. Yet the
Woggle-Bug did not suspect this, and being, like so many other thoroughly
educated persons, proud of his mental attainments, he marched along the
street with an air of importance that made one wonder what great
thoughts were occupying his massive brain.

Being about as big, in his magnified state, as a man, the Woggle-Bug
took care to clothe himself like a man; only, instead of choosing sober
colors for his garments, he delighted in the most gorgeous reds and
yellows and blues and greens; so that if you looked at him long the
brilliance of his clothing was liable to dazzle your eyes.

I suppose the Waggle-Bug did not realize at all what a queer appearance
he made. Being rather nervous, he seldom looked into a mirror; and as
the people he met avoided telling him he was unusual, he had fallen
into the habit of considering himself merely an ordinary citizen of the
big city wherein he resided.

So the Woggle-Bug strutted proudly along the street, swinging a cane in
one hand, flourishing a pink handkerchief in the other, fumbling his
watch-fob with another, and feeling his necktie was straight with
another. Having four hands to use would prove rather puzzling to you or
me, I imagine; but the Woggie-Bug was thoroughly accustomed to them.

Presently he came to a very fine store with big plate-glass windows,
and standing in the center of the biggest window was a creature so
beautiful and radiant and altogether charming that the first glance at
her nearly took his breath away. Her complexion was lovely, for it was
wax; but the thing which really caught the Woggle-Bug's fancy was the
marvelous dress she wore. Indeed, it was the latest (last year's) Paris
model, although the Woggle-Bug did not know that; and the designer must
have had a real woggly love for bright colors, for the gown was made of
red cloth covered with big checks which were so loud the fashion books
called them "Wagnerian Plaids."

Never had our friend the Woggle-Bug seen such a beautiful gown before,
and it afflicted him so strongly that he straightaway fell in love with
the entire outfit--even to the wax-complexioned lady herself! Very
politely he tipped his to her; but she stared coldly back without in
any way acknowledging the courtesy.

"Never mind," he thought; "'faint heart never won fair lady.' And I'm
determined to win this kaliedoscope of beauty or perish in the
attempt!" You will notice that our insect had a way of using big words
to express himself, which leads us to suspect that the school system in
Oz is the same they employ in Boston.

As, with swelling heart, the Woggle-Bug feasted his eyes upon the
enchanting vision, a small green tag that was attached to a button of
the waist suddenly attracted his attention. Upon the tag was marked:
"Price $7.93--GREATLY REDUCED."

"Ah!" murmured the Woggle-Bug; "my darling is in greatly reduced
circumstances, and $7.93 will make her mine! Where, oh where, shall I
find the seven ninety-three wherewith to liberate this divinity and
make her Mrs. Woggle-Bug?"

"Move on!" said a gruff policeman, who came along swinging his club.
And the Woggle-Bug obediently moved on, his brain working fast and
furious in the endeavor to think of a way to procure seven dollars and
ninety-three cents.

You see, in the Land of Oz they use no money at all, so that when the
Woggle-Bug arrived in America he did not possess a single penny. And no
one had presented him with any money since.

"Yet there must be several ways to procure money in this country," he
reflected; "for otherwise everybody would be as penniless as I am. But
how, I wonder, do they manage to get it?"

Just then he came along a side street where a number of men were at
work digging a long and deep ditch in which to lay a new sewer.

"Now these men," thought the Woggle-Bug, "must get money for shoveling
all that earth, else they wouldn't do it. Here is my chance to win the
charming vision of beauty in the shop window!"

Seeking out the foreman, he asked for work, and the foreman agreed to
hire him.

"How much do you pay these workmen?" asked the highly magnified one.

"Two dollars a day," answered the foreman.

"Then," said the Woggle-Bug, "you must pay me four dollars a day; for I
have four arms to their two, and can do double their work."

"If that is so, I'll pay you four dollars," agreed the man.

The Woggle-Bug was delighted.

"In two days," he told himself, as he threw off his brilliant coat and
placed his hat upon it, and rolled up his sleeves; "in two days I can
earn eight dollars--enough to purchase my greatly reduced darling and
buy her seven cents worth of caramels besides."

He seized two spades and began working so rapidly with his four arms
that the foreman said: "You must have been forewarned."

"Why?" asked the Insect.

"Because there's a saying that to be forewarned is to be four-armed,"
replied the other.

"That is nonsense," said the Woggle-Bug, digging with all his might;
"for they call you the foreman, and yet I only see one of you."

"Ha, ha!" laughed the man, and he was so proud of his new worker that
he went into the corner saloon to tell his friend the barkeeper what a
treasure he had found.

It was just after noon that the Woggle-Bug hired as a ditch-digger in
order to win his heart's desire; so at noon on the second day he quit
work, and having received eight silver dollars he put on his coat and
rushed away to the store that he might purchase his intended bride.

But, alas for the uncertainty of all our hopes! Just as the Woggle-Bug
reached the door he saw a lady coming out of the store dressed in
identical checks with which he had fallen in love!

At first he did not know what to do or say, for the young lady's
complexion was not wax--far from it. But a glance into the window
showed him the wax lady now dressed in a plain black tailor-made suit,
and at once he knew the wearer of the Wagnerian plaids was his real
love, and not the stiff creature behind the glass.

"Beg pardon!" he exclaimed, stopping the young lady; "but you're mine.
Here's the seven ninety-three, and seven cents for candy."

But she glanced at him in a haughty manner, and walked away with her
nose slightly elevated.

He followed. He could not do otherwise with those delightful checks
shining before him like beacon-lights to urge him on.

The young lady stepped into a car, which whirled away rapidly. For a
moment he was nearly paralyzed at his loss; then he started after the
car as fast as he could go, and this was very fast indeed--he being a
woggle-bug.

Somebody cried: "Stop, thief!" and a policeman ran out to arrest him.
But the Woggle-Bug used his four hands to push the officer aside, and
the astonished man went rolling into the gutter so recklessly that his
uniform bore marks of the encounter for many days.

Still keeping an eye on the car, the Woggle-Bug rushed on. He
frightened two dogs, upset a fat gentleman who was crossing the street,
leaped over an automobile that shot in front of him, and finally ran
plump into the car, which had abruptly stopped to let off a passenger.
Breathing hard from his exertions, he jumped upon the rear platform of
the car, only to see his charmer step off at the front and walk
mincingly up the steps of a house. Despite his fatigue, he flew after
her at once, crying out:

"Stop, my variegated dear--stop! Don't you know you're mine?"

But she slammed the door in his face, and he sat down upon the steps
and wiped his forehead with his pink handkerchief and fanned himself
with his hat and tried to think what he should do next.

Presently a very angry man came out of the house. He had a revolver in
one hand and a carving-knife in the other.

"What do you mean by insulting my wife?" he demanded.

"Was that your wife?" asked the Woggle-Bug, in meek astonishment.

"Of course it is my wife," answered the man.

"Oh, I didn't know," said the insect, rather humbled. "But I'll give
you seven ninety-three for her. That's all she's worth, you know; for I
saw it marked on the tag."

The man gave a roar of rage and jumped into the air with the intention
of falling on the Woggle-Bug and hurting him with the knife and pistol.
But the Woggle-Bug was suddenly in a hurry, and didn't wait to be
jumped on. Indeed, he ran so very fast that the man was content to let
him go, especially as the pistol wasn't loaded and the carving-knife
was as dull as such knives usually are.

But his wife had conceived a great dislike for the Wagnerian check
costume that had won for her the Woggle-Bug's admiration. "I'll never
wear it again!" she said to her husband, when he came in and told her
that the Woggle-Bug was gone.

"Then," he replied, "you'd better give it to Bridget; for she's been
bothering me about her wages lately, and the present will keep her
quite for a month longer."

So she called Bridget and presented her with the dress, and the
delighted servant decided to wear it that night to Mickey Schwartz's
ball.

Now the poor Woggle-Bug, finding his affection scorned, was feeling
very blue and unhappy that evening, When he walked out, dressed (among
other things) in a purple-striped shirt, with a yellow necktie and
pea-green gloves, he looked a great deal more cheerful than he really
was. He had put on another hat, for the Woggle-Bug had a superstition
that to change his hat was to change his luck, and luck seemed to have
overlooked the fact that he was in existence.

The hat may really have altered his fortunes, as the Insect shortly met
Ikey Swanson, who gave him a ticket to Mickey Schwartz's ball; for
Ikey's clean dickey had not come home from the laundry, and so he could
not go himself.

The Woggle-Bug, thinking to distract his mind from his dreams of love,
attended the hall, and the first thing he saw as he entered the room
was Bridget clothed in that same gorgeous gown of Wagnerian plaid that
had so fascinated his bugly heart.

The dear Bridget had added to her charms by putting seven full-blown
imitation roses and three second-hand ostrich-plumes in her red hair;
so that her entire person glowed like a sunset in June.

The Woggle-bug was enraptured; and, although the divine Bridget was
waltzing with Fritzie Casey, the Insect rushed to her side and, seizing
her with all his four arms at once, cried out in his truly educated
Bostonian way:

"Oh, my superlative conglomeration of beauty! I have found you at
last!"

Bridget uttered a shriek, and Fritzie Casey doubled two fists that
looked like tombstones, and advanced upon the intruder.

Still embracing the plaid costume with two arms, the Woggle-Bug tipped
Mr. Casey over with the other two. But Bridget made a bound and landed
with her broad heel, which supported 180 pounds, firmly upon the
Insect's toes. He gave a yelp of pain and promptly released the lady,
and a moment later he found himself flat upon the floor with a dozen of
the dancers piled upon him--all of whom were pummeling each other with
much pleasure and a firm conviction that the diversion had been planned
for their special amusement.

But the Woggle-Bug had the strength of many men, and when he flopped
the big wings that were concealed by the tails of his coat, the
gentlemen resting upon him were scattered like autumn leaves in a gust
of wind.

The Insect stood up, rearranged his dress, and looked about him.
Bridget had run away and gone home, and the others were still fighting
amongst themselves with exceeding cheerfulness. So the Woggle-Bug
selected a hat which fit him (his own having been crushed out of shape)
and walked sorrowfully back to his lodgings.

"Evidently that was not a lucky hat I wore to the ball," he reflected;
"but perhaps this one I now have will bring about a change in my
fortunes."

Bridget needed money; and as she had worn her brilliant costume once
and allowed her friends to see how becoming it was, she carried it the
next morning to a second-hand dealer and sold it for three dollars in
cash.

Scarcely had she left the shop when a lady of Swedish extraction--a
widow with four small children in her train--entered and asked to look
at a gown. The dealer showed her the one he had just bought from
Bridget, and its gay coloring so pleased the widow that she immediately
purchased it for $3.65.

"Ay tank ets a good deal money, by sure," she said to herself; "but das
leedle children mus' have new fadder to mak mind un tak care dere
mudder like, by yimminy! An' Ay tank no man look may way in das ole
dress I been wearing."

She took the gown and the four children to her home, where she lost no
time in trying on the costume, which fitted her as perfectly as a
flour-sack does a peck of potatoes.

"Das _beau_--tiful!" she exclaimed, in rapture, as she tried to see
herself in a cracked mirror. "Ay go das very afternoon to valk in da
park, for das man-folks go crazy-like ven he sees may fine frocks!"

Then she took her green parasol and a hand-bag stuffed with papers (to
make it look prosperous and aristocratic) and sallied forth to the
park, followed by all her interesting flock.

The men didn't fail to look at her, as you may guess; but none looked
with yearning until the Woggle-Bug, sauntering gloomily along a path,
happened to raise his eyes and see before him his heart's delight the
very identical Wagnerian plaids which had filled him with such
unbounded affection.

"Aha, my excruciatingly lovely creation!" he cried, running up and
kneeling before the widow; "I have found you once again. Do not, I beg
of you, treat me with coldness!"

For he had learned from experience not to unduly startle his charmer at
their first moment of meeting; so he made a firm attempt to control
himself, that the wearer of the checked gown might not scorn him.

The widow had no great affection for bugs, having wrestled with the
species for many years; but this one was such a big-bug and so
handsomely dressed that she saw no harm in encouraging him--especially
as the men she had sought to captivate were proving exceedingly shy.

"So you tank Ay I ban loavely?" she asked, with a coy glance at the
Insect.

"I do! With all my heart I do!" protested the Woggle-Bug, placing all
four hands, one after another, over that beating organ.

"Das mak plenty trouble by you. I don'd could be yours!" sighed the
widow, indeed regretting her admirer was not an ordinary man.

"Why not?" asked the Woggle-Bug. "I have still the seven ninety-three;
and as that was the original price, and you are now slightly worn and
second-handed, I do not see why I need despair of calling you my own."

It is very queer, when we think of it, that the Woggle-Bug could not
separate the wearer of his lovely gown from the gown itself. Indeed, he
always made love directly to the costume that had so enchanted him,
without any regard whatsoever to the person inside it; and the only way
we can explain this remarkable fact is to recollect that the Woggle-Bug
was only a woggle-bug, and nothing more could be expected of him. The
widow did not, of course, understand his speech in the least; but she
gathered the fact that the Woggle-Bug had id money, so she sighed and
hinted that she was very hungry, and that there was a good short-order
restaurant just outside the park.

The Woggle-Bug became thoughtful at this. He hated to squander his
money, which he had come to regard a sort of purchase price with which
to secure his divinity. But neither could he allow those darling checks
to go hungry; so he said:

"If you will come with me to the restaurant, I will gladly supply you
with food."

The widow accepted the invitation at once, and the Woggle-Bug walked
proudly beside her, leading all of the four children at once with his
four hands.

Two such gay costumes as those worn by the widow and the Woggle-Bug are
seldom found together, and the restaurant man was so impressed by the
sight that he demanded his money in advance.

The four children, jabbering delightedly in their broken English,
clambered upon four stools, and the widow sat upon another. And the
Woggle-Bug, who was not hungry (being engaged in feasting his eyes upon
the checks), laid down a silver dollar as a guarantee of good faith.

It was wonderful to see so much pie and cake and bread-and-butter and
pickles and dough-nuts and sandwiches disappear into the mouths of the
four innocents and their comparatively innocent mother. The Woggle-Bug
had to add another quarter to the vanished dollar before the score
was finally settled; and no sooner had the tribe trooped out
restaurant than they turned into the open portals of an Ice-Cream
Parlor, where they all attacked huge stacks of pale ice-cream and
consumed several plates of lady-fingers and cream-puffs.

Again the Woggle-Bug reluctantly abandoned a dollar; but the end was
not yet. The dear children wanted candy and nuts; and then they warned
pink lemonade; and then pop-corn and chewing-gum; and always the
Woggle-Bug, after a glance at the entrancing costume, found himself
unable to resist paying for the treat.

It was nearly evening when the widow pleaded fatigue and asked to be
taken home. For none of them was able to eat another morsel, and the
Woggle-Bug wearied her with his protestations of boundless admiration.

"Will you permit me to call upon you this evening?" asked the Insect,
pleadingly, as he bade the wearer of the gown good-bye on her
door-step.

"Sure like!" she replied, not caring to dismiss him harshly; and the
happy Woggle-Bug went home with a light heart, murmuring to himself:

"At last the lovely plaids are to be my own! The new hat I found at the
ball has certainly brought me luck."

I am glad our friend the Woggle-Bug had those few happy moments, for he
was destined to endure severe disappointments in the near future.

That evening he carefully brushed his coat, put on a green satin
necktie and a purple embroidered waist-coat, and walked briskly towards
the house of the widow. But, alas! as he drew near to the dwelling a
most horrible stench greeted his nostrils, a sense of great depression
came over him, and upon pausing before the house his body began to
tremble and his eyes rolled wildly in their sockets.

For the wily widow, wishing to escape her admirer, had sprinkled the
door-step and the front walk with insect Exterminator, and not even the
Woggle-Bug's love for the enchanting checked gown could induce him to
linger longer in that vicinity.

Sick and discouraged, he returned home, where his first act was to
smash the luckless hat and replace it with another. But it was some
time before he recovered from the horrors of that near approach to
extermination, and he passed a very wakeful and unhappy night, indeed.

Meantime the widow had traded with a friend of hers (who had once been
a wash-lady for General Funston) the Wagnerian costume for a crazy
quilt and a corset that was nearly as good as new and a pair of silk
stockings that were not mates. It was a good bargain for both of them,
and the wash-lady being colored--that is, she had a deep mahogany
complexion--was delighted with her gorgeous gown and put it on the very
next morning when she went to deliver the wash to the brick-layer's
wife.

Surely it must have been Fate that directed the Woggle-Bug's steps;
for, as he walked disconsolately along, an intuition caused him to
raise his eyes, and he saw just ahead of him his affinity--carrying a
large clothes-basket.

"Stop!" he called our, anxiously; "stop, my fair Grenadine, I implore
you!"

The colored lady cast one glance behind her and imagined that Satan had
at last arrived to claim her. For she had never before seen the
Woggle-Bug, and was horrified by his sudden and unusual appearance.

"Go 'way, Mars' Debbil! Go 'way an' lemme 'lone!" she screeched, and
the next minute she dropped her empty basket and sped up the street
with a swiftness that only fear could have lent her flat-bottomed feet.

Nevertheless, the Woggle-Bug might have overtaken her had he not
stepped into the clothes-basket and fallen headlong, becoming so
tangled up in the thing that he rolled over and over several times
before he could free himself. Then, when he had picked up his hat,
which was utterly ruined, and found his cane, which had flown across
the street, his mahogany charmer in the Wagnerian Plaids had
disappeared from view.

With a sigh at his latest misfortune he returned home for another hat,
and the agitated wash-lady, imagining that the devil had doubtless been
lured by her beautiful gown, made haste to sell it to a Chinaman who
lived next door.

Its bright colors pleased the Chink, who ripped it up and made it over
into a Chinese robe, with flowing draperies falling to his heels. He
dressed himself in his new costume and, being proud of possessing such
finery, sat down on a bench outside his door so that everyone passing
by could see how magnificent he looked.

It was here the wandering Woggle-Bug espied him; and, recognizing at
once the pattern and colors of his infatuating idol, he ran up and sat
beside the Chinaman, saying in agitated but educated tones:

"Oh my prismatic personification of gigantic gorgeousness!--again I
have found you!"

"Sure tling," said the Chink with composure.

"Be mine! Only be mine!" continued the enraptured Woggle-Bug.

The Chinaman did not quite understand.

"Two dlolla a day," he answered, cautiously.

"Oh, joy," exclaimed the insect in delight; "I can then own you for a
day and a half--for I have three dollars left. May I feel your
exquisite texture, my dearest Fabric?"

"No flabic. No feelee. You too flesh. I _man_ Chinaman!" returned the
Oriental calmly.

"Never mind that! 'Tis your beautiful garment I love. Every check in
that entrancing dress is a joy and a delight to my heart!"

While the Woggle-Bug thus raved, the Chinaman's wife (who was Mattie De
Forest before she married him) heard the conversation, and decided this
love affair had gone far enough. So she suddenly appeared with a
broomstick, and with it began pounding the Woggle-Bug as fiercely as
possible--and Mattie was no weakling, I assure you.

The first blow knocked the Insect's hat so far over his eyes that he
was blinded; but, resolving not to be again cheated out of his darling,
he grasped firmly hold of the Wagnerian plaids with all four hands, and
tore a goodly portion of it from the frightened Celestial's body.

Next moment he was dashing down the street, with the precious cloth
tucked securely underneath an arm, and Mattie, being in slight
dishabile, did not think best to follow him.

The triumphant joy of the Woggle-Bug can well be imagined. No more need
he chase the fleeting vision of his love--no more submit to countless
disappointments in his efforts to approach the object of his affection.
The gorgeous plaids were now his own (or a large part of them, anyway),
and upon reaching the quiet room wherein he lodged he gloated long and
happily over its vivid coloring and violent contrasts of its glowing
hues. To the eyes of the Woggle-Bug nothing could be more beautiful,
and he positively regretted the necessity of ever turning his gaze from
this bewitching treasure.

That he might never in the future be separated from the checks, he
folded them, with many loving caresses, into compact form, and wrapped
them in a sheet of stout paper tied with cotton cord that had a
love-knot at the end. Wherever he went, thereafter, he carried the
parcel underneath his left upper arm, pressed as closely to his heart
as possible. And this sense of possession was so delightful that our
Woggle-Bug was happy as the day is long.

In the evening his fortunes changed with cruel abruptness.

He walked out to take the air, and noticing a crowd people standing in
an open space and surrounding a huge brown object, our Woggle-Bug
stopped to learn what the excitement was about.

Pushing his way through the crowd, and hugging his precious parcel, he
soon reached the inner circle of spectators and found they had
assembled to watch a balloon ascension. The Professor who was to go up
with the balloon had not yet arrived; but the balloon itself was fully
inflated and tugging hard at the rope that held it, as if anxious to
escape the blended breaths of the people that crowded around. Just
below the balloon was a small basket, attached to the netting of the
gas-bag, and the Woggle-Bug was bending over the edge of this, to see
what it contained, when a warning cry from the crowd caused him to
pause and glance over his shoulder.

Great horrors and crumpled creeps! Springing toward him, with a scowl
on his face and a long knife with a zig-zag blade in his uplifted hand,
was that very Chinaman from whose body he had torn the Wagnerian
plaids!

The plundered Celestial was evidently vindictive, and intended to push
the wicked knife into the Woggle-Bug's body.

Our hero was a brave bug, as can easily be proved; but he did not wait
for the knife to arrive at the broad of his back. Instead, he gave a
yell (to show he was not afraid) and leaped nimbly into the basket of
the balloon. The descending knife, missing its intended victim, fell
upon the rope and severed it, and instantly the great balloon from the
crowd and soared majestically toward the heavens.

The Woggle-Bug had escaped the Chinaman, but he didn't know whether to
be glad or not.

For the balloon was earning him into the clouds, and he had no idea how
to manage it, or to make it descend to earth again. When he peered over
the edge of the basket he could hear the faint murmur of the crowd, and
dimly see the enraged Professor (who had come too late) pounding the
Chinaman, while the Chinaman tried to dissect the Professor with his
knife.

Then all was blotted out; clouds rolled about him; night fell. The man
in the moon laughed at him; the stars winked at each other as if
delighted at the Woggle-Bug's plight, and a witch riding by on her
broomstick yelled at him to keep on the right side of the road, and not
run her down.

But the Woggle-Bug, squatted in the bottom of the basket and hugging
his precious parcel to his bosom, paid no attention to anything but his
own thoughts.

He had often ridden in the Gump; but never had he been so high as this,
and the distance to the ground made him nervous.

When morning came he saw a strange country far beneath him, and longed
to tread the earth again.

Now all woggle-bugs are born with wings, and our highly-magnified one
had a beautiful, broad pair of floppers concealed beneath ample
coat-tails. But long ago he had learned that his wings were not strong
enough to lift his big body from the ground, so he had never tried to
fly with them.

Here, however, was an occasion when he might put these wings to good
use, for if he spread them in the air and then leaped over the side of
the basket they would act in the same way a parachute does, and bear
him gently to the ground.

No sooner did this thought occur to him than he put it into practice.

Disentangling his wings from his coat-tails, he spread them as wide as
possible and then jumped from the car of the balloon.

Down, down the Woggle-Bug sank; but so slowly that there was no danger
in the flight. He began to see the earth again, lying beneath him like
a sun-kissed panorama of mud and frog-ponds and rocks and brushwood.

There were few trees, yet it was our insect's fate to drop directly
above what trees there were, so that presently he came ker-plunk into a
mass of tangled branches--and stuck there, with his legs dangling
helplessly between two limbs and his wings caught in the foliage at
either side.

Below was a group of Arab children, who at first started to run away.
But, seeing that the queer creature which had dropped from the skies
was caught fast in the tree, they stopped and began to throw stones and
clubs at it. One of the missiles struck the tree-limb at the right of
the Woggle-Bug and jarred him loose. The next instant he fluttered to
the ground, where his first act was to fold up his wings and tuck them
underneath his coat-tails again, and his next action was to assure
himself that the beloved plaids were still safe.

Then he looked for the Arab children; but they had scuttled away
towards a group of tents, and now several men with dark skins and gay
clothing came from the tents and ran towards the Woggle-Bug.

"Good morning," said our hero, removing his hat with a flourish and
bowing politely.

"Meb-la-che-bah!" shouted the biggest Arab, and at once two others
wound coils of rope around the Woggle-Bug and tied the ends in hard
knots.

His hat was knocked off and trampled into the mud by the Shiek (who was
the big Arab), and the precious parcel was seized and ruthlessly
opened.

"Very good!" said the Shiek, eyeing the plaids with pleasure. "My
slaves shall make me a new waistcoat of this cloth."

"No! oh, no!" cried the agonized Insect; "it is taken from a person who
has had small-pox and yellow-fever and toothache and mumps--all at the
same time. Do not, I bet you, risk your valuable life by wearing that
cloth!"

"Bah!" said the Shiek, scornfully; "I have had all those diseases and
many more. I am immune. But now," he continued, "allow me to bid you
good-bye. I am sorry to be obliged to kill you, but such is our
custom."

This was bad news for the Woggle-Bug; but he did not despair.

"Are you not afraid to kill me?" he asked, as if surprised.

"Why should I be afraid?" demanded the Shiek.

"Because it is well-known that to kill a woggle-bug brings bad luck to
one."

The Shiek hesitated, for he was very superstitious.

"Are you a woggle-bug?" he asked.

"I am," replied the Insect, proudly. "And I may as well tell you that
the last person who killed one of my race had three unlucky days. The
first his suspenders broke (the Arab shuddered), the second day he
smashed a looking-glass (the Arab moaned), and the third day he was
chewed up by a crocodile."

Now the greatest aversion Arabs have is to be chewed by a crocodile,
because these people usually roam over the sands of the desert, where
to meet an amphibian is simply horrible; so at the Woggle-Bug's speech
they set up a howl of fear, and the Shiek shouted:

"Unbind him! Let not a hair of his head be injured!"

At once the knots in the ropes were untied, and the Woggle-Bug was
free. All the Arabs united to show him deference and every respectful
attention, and since his own hat had been destroyed they wound about
his head a picturesque turban of an exquisite soiled white color,
having stripes of red and yellow in it.

Then the Woggle-Bug was escorted to the tents, where he suddenly
remembered his precious plaids, and asked that the cloth he restored to
him.

Thereupon the Shiek got up and made a long speech, in which he
described his grief at being obliged to refuse the request.

At the end of that time one of the women came op to them with a lovely
waistcoat which she had manufactured out of the Wagnerian plaids; and
when the Shiek saw it he immediately ordered all the tom-toms and
kettle-drums in the camp destroyed, as they were no longer necessary.
Then he put on the gorgeous vestment, and turned a deaf ear to the
Woggle-Bug's agonized wails.

But there were some scraps of cloth left, and to show that he was
liberal and good-natured, the Shiek ordered these manufactured into a
handsome necktie, which he presented Woggle-Bug in another long speech.

Our hero, realizing a larger part of his darling was lost to him,
decided to be content with the smaller share; so he put on the necktie,
and felt really proud of its brilliance and aggressive elegance.

Then, bidding the Arabs farewell, he strode across the desert until he
reached the borders of a more fertile and favored country.

Indeed, he found before him a cool and enticing jungle, which at first
seemed deserted. But while he stared about him a sound fell upon his
ear, and he saw approaching a young lady Chimpanzee. She was evidently
a personage of some importance, for her hair was neatly banged just
over her eyes, and she wore a clean white pinafore with bows of pink
ribbon at the shoulders.

"Good morning, Mr. Beetle," said she, with merry laughter.

"Do not, I beg of you, call me a beetle," exclaimed our hero, rather
peevishly; "for I am actually a Woggle-Bug, and Highly-Magnified at
that!"

"What's in a name?" laughed the gay damsel. "Come, let me introduce you
to our jungle, where strangers of good breeding are always welcome."

"As for breeding," said the Woggle-Bug, "my father, although of
ordinary size, was a famous Bug-Wizard in his day, and claimed descent
from the original protoplasm which constituted the nucleus of the
present planetary satellite upon which we exist."

"That's all right," returned Miss Chim. "Tell that to our king, and
he'll decorate you with the medal of the Omnipotent Order of Onerous
Orthographers, Are you ready to meander?"

The Woggle-Bug did not like the flippant tone in which maiden spoke;
but he at once followed her.

Presently they came to a tall hedge surrounding the Inner Jungle, and
without this hedge stood a patrol of brown bears who wore red
soldier-caps and carried gold-plated muskets in their hands.

"We call this the bearier," said Miss Chim, pointing to the soldiers,
"because they oblige all strangers to paws."

"I should think it was a bearicade," remarked the Woggle-Bug.

But when they approached the gateway the officer in charge saluted
respectfully to Miss Chim, and permitted her to escort the Woggle-Bug
into the sacred precincts of the Inner Jungle.

Here his eyes were soon opened to their widest capacity in genuine
astonishment.

The Jungle was as clean and as well-regulated as any city of men the
Insect had ever visited. Just within the gate a sleek antelope was
running a pop-corn stand, and a little further on a screech-owl stood
upon a stump playing a violin, while across her breast was a sign
reading: "I am blind--at present."

As they walked up the street they came to a big grey monkey turning a
hand-organ, and attached to a cord was a little nigger-boy whom the
monkey sent into the crowd of animals, standing by to gather up the
pennies, pulling him back every now and then by means of the cord.

"There's a curious animal for you," said Miss Chim, pointing to the
boy. "Those horrid things they call men, whether black or white, seem
to me the lowest of all created beasts."

"I have seen them in a highly civilized state," replied the Woggle-Bug,
"and they're really further advanced than you might suppose."

But Miss Chim gave a scornful laugh, and pulled him away to where a
hippopotamus sat under the shade of a big tree, mopping his brow with a
red handkerchief--for the weather was somewhat sultry. Before the hip
was a table covered with a blue cloth, and upon the cloth was
embroidered the words: "Professor Hipmus, Fortune Teller."

"Want your fortune told?" asked Miss Chim.

"I don't mind," replied the Woggle-Bug.

"I'll read your hand," said the Professor, with a yawn that startled
the insect. "To my notion palmistry is the best means of finding out
what nobody knows or cares to know."

He took the upper-right hand of the Woggle-Bug, and after adjusting his
spectacles bent over it with an air of great wisdom.

"You have been in love," announced the Professor; "but you got it in
the neck."

"True!" murmured the astonished Insect, putting up his left lower hand
to feel of the beloved necktie.

"You think you have won," continued the Hip; "but there are others who
have 1, 2. You have many heart throbs before you, during your future
life. Afterward I see no heart throbs whatever. Forty cents, please."

"Isn't he just wonderful?" asked Miss Chim, with enthusiasm. "He's the
greatest fortune teller in the jungle."

"On account of his size, I suppose," returned the Woggle-Bug, as they
walked on.

Soon they came to the Royal Palace, which was a beautiful bower formed
of vines upon which grew many brilliant-hued forest flowers. The
entrance was guarded by a Zebra, who barred admission until Miss Chim
whispered the password in his ear. Then he permitted them to enter, and
the Chimpanzee immediately ushered the Woggle-Bug into the presence of
King Weasel.

This monarch lay coiled upon a purple silk cushion, half asleep and yet
wakeful enough to be smoking a big cigar. Beside him crouched two
prairie-dogs who were combing his hair very carefully, while a red
squirrel perched near his head and fanned him with her bushy tail.

"Dear me, what have we here?" exclaimed the King of the Jungle, in a
querulous tone, "Is it an over-grown pinch-bug, or is it a
kissing-bug?"

"I have the honor to be a Woggle-Bug, your Majesty!" replied our hero,
proudly.

"Sav, cut out that Majesty," snapped the King, with a scowl. "If you
can find anything majestic about me, I'd like to know what it is."

"Don't treat him with any respect," whispered Miss Chim to the Insect,
"or you'll get him riled. Sneer at him, and slap his face if you get a
chance."

The Woggle-Bug took the hint.

"Really," he told the King. "I have never seen a more despicable
creature than you. The admirable perspicacity inherent in your tribe
seems to have deteriorated in you to a hyperbolated insousancy." Then
he reached out his arms and slapped the king four times, twice on one
side of his face and twice on the other.

"Thanks, my dear June-Bug," said the monarch; "I now recognize you to
be a person of some importance."

"Sire, I am a Woggle-Bug, highly magnified and thoroughly educated. It
is no exaggeration to say I am the greatest Woggle-Bug on earth."

"I fully believe it, so pray do not play any more foursomes on my jaw.
I am sufficiently humiliated at this moment to recognize you as a
Sullivanthauros, should you claim to be a member of that extinct race."

Then two little weasels--a boy weasel and a girl weasel--came into the
bower and threw their school-books at the squirrel so cleverly that one
hit the King upon the nose and smashed his cigar and the other caught
him fairly in the pit of his stomach.

At first the monarch howled a bit; then he wiped the tears from his
face and said:

"Ah, what delightful children I have! What do you wish, my darlings?"

"I want a cent for chewing gum," said the Girl Weasel.

"Get it from the Guinea-Pig; you have my assent. And what does my dear
boy want?"

"Pop," went the Weasel, "our billy-goat has swallowed the hare you gave
me to play with."

"Dear me," sighed the King, "how often I find a hair in the butter!
Whenever I reign people carry umbrellas; and my son, although quite
polished, indulges only in monkey-shines! Uneasy lies the head that
wears a crown! but if one is scalped, the loss of the crown renders the
head still more uneasy."

"Couldn't they find a better king than you?" enquired the Woggle-Bug,
curiously, as the children left the bower.

"Yes; but no worse," answered the Weasel; "and here in the jungle
honors are conferred only upon the unworthy. For if a truly great
animal is honored he gets a swelled head, and that renders him
unbearable. They now regard the King of the Jungle with contempt, and
that makes all my subjects self-respecting."

"There is wisdom in that," declared the Woggle-Bug, approvingly; "a
single glance at you makes me content with being so excellent a bug."

"True," murmured the King, yawning. "But you tire me, good stranger.
Miss Chim, will you kindly get the gasoline can? It's high time to
eradicate this insect."

"With pleasure," said Miss Chim, moving away with a smile.

But the Woggle-Bug did not linger to be eradicated. With one wild bound
he cleared the door of the palace and sprinted up the entrance of the
Jungle. The bear soldiers saw him running away, and took careful aim
and fired. But the gold-plated muskets would not shoot straight, and
now the Woggle-Bug was far distant, and still running with all his
might.

Nor did he pause until he had emerged from the forest and crossed the
plains, and reached at last the city from whence he had escaped in the
balloon. And, once again in his old lodgings, he looked at himself in
the mirror and said:

"After all, this necktie is my love--and my love is now mine
forevermore! Why should I not be happy and content?"

                                PREFACE.


This little book should be used as a simple guide to the practical study
of Nature rather than as a mere reader.

Every lesson herein set down has, during the author’s many years’
experience in teaching Nature Study, been taught by observation and
practice again and again; and each time with satisfactory result. The
materials required for most of the lessons—whether they be obtained from
the naturalist-dealer or from the nearest hedge, ditch, or pond—are
within everybody’s reach.

There is nothing that appeals to the heart of the ordinary child like
_living things_, be they animal or vegetable, and there is no branch of
education at the present day that bears, in the young mind, such
excellent fruit as the study of the simple, living things around us.

Your child is nothing if not curious. He wants to understand everything
that lives and moves and has its being in his bright little world.

Nature Study involves so many ingenious little deductions, that the
reasoning powers are almost constantly employed, and intelligence grows
proportionately. The child’s powers of observation are stimulated, and
his memory is cultivated in the way most pleasing to his inquiring
nature. By dissecting seeds, bulbs, buds, and flowers, his hand is
trained, and methods expeditious and exact are inculcated. By drawing
his specimens, no matter how roughly or rapidly, his eye is trained more
thoroughly than any amount of enforced copying of stiff, uninteresting
models of prisms, cones, etc., ever could train it.

The love of flowers and animals is one of the most commendable traits in
the disposition of the wondering child, and ought to be encouraged above
all others.

It is the author’s fondest and most sanguine hope that the working out
of the exercises, of which this booklet is mainly composed, may prove
much more of a joy than a task, and that the practical knowledge gained
thereby may tempt his little readers to study further the great book of
Nature, whose broad pages are ever open to us, and whose silent answers
to our manifold questions are never very difficult to read.

                         I.—STRUCTURE OF STEMS.


“We are going to have a peep into the inside of these twigs,” said Uncle
George, as he laid some willow and horse-chestnut twigs on the table.

“First,” he said, “let us examine the outside of them.” He handed a
small willow branch to Tom and a horse-chestnut branch to Frank.

“Now, Frank, tell me all you see.”

“I see the rings of scars which mark each year’s growth,” said Frank.
“This year’s growth is at the top, above the first ring of scars. Below
this is last year’s growth. Then comes another ring of marks, and below
this again is the growth of two years ago.”[1]

“That is to say,” said his uncle, “the upper part of your twig is about
one year old, the middle part is two years old, and the lower part is
three years old. Go on, Frank.”

“The upper part is light brown, while the middle and lower parts are
dark brown.”

“Take your lens, Frank, and look at that brown covering carefully.”

“Oh, it is studded all over with little oval marks like pits,” said
Frank.

“Now, what about the buds?”

“The buds,” said Frank, putting down his lens, “are in pairs; and the
stem is swollen where each pair of buds comes off.”

“Very good,” said Uncle George. “That is exactly what I wanted you to
notice. The swollen parts of a stem are called its _nodes_. In every
stem, buds and leaves occur at the nodes. Nodes are very well seen in
grass and corn stems.”

“Then at the top of the twig there is a very large bud and a pair of
small buds, one on each side of it,” said Frank.

“You have described it very well,” said his uncle. “Now, Tom, what about
the willow twig?”

“I see some very tiny marks on it,” said Tom. “There are no rings
marking the year’s growth; and the buds are not arranged in pairs.”

   [Illustration: Horse-Chestnut Twig, showing Three Years’ Growth.]

“That is quite right, Tom. Willow grows very quickly. Your twig is all
one season’s growth. It is smooth and green—not brown like the
horse-chestnut twig. The buds are arranged alternately. That is to say,
there is only one bud at each node.”

“Now, let us see what the horse-chestnut twig is made of.”

Uncle George next cut two pieces off the top part of the horse-chestnut
twig and handed one to each of the boys.

“Now, take your knives,” he said, “and carefully peel off a very small
piece of the brown covering. You will have to be very careful, as it is
very thin and rather difficult to remove. Ah, Frank, you have done that
very nicely. Now, hold it up to the light and tell us what you think it
is for.”

“It is the skin or covering of the twig,” said Frank.

“It is; and if you look with your lens you will see that the tiny
markings on it are holes. It is really a thin layer of bark or cork.
Perhaps you can tell me why the twig is covered with a thin layer of
cork?”

“To keep water from getting in,” said Frank.

“Rather to keep water from getting _out_,” said Uncle George. “You must
remember that water is continually passing up stems from the roots.
Water cannot pass through cork. If we were to remove the cork layer from
the outside of a growing twig, that twig would shrivel up and die. There
is also a layer of cork protecting the willow twig, but it is so very
thin that we can see through it. Remove as much of the cork layer as you
can, and tell me what is underneath.”

“There is a layer of green stuff beneath,” said Frank.

“Just so,” said Uncle George. “Now, if you remember, I once told you
that plants took most of their food from the air by means of the green
stuff in their leaves. This green layer in the twig does the same thing;
but how can the air get in if it is covered up by a layer of cork?”

“Oh, I see now,” said Tom, “what the tiny holes or pits are for—to let
air in to the green layer underneath.”

 [Illustration: Diagram Sections of (A and B) a One-Year Old and (C and
                         D) Two-Year Old Stem.]

  1. Bark.
  2. Green Layer.
  3. Bast.
  4. Slippery Layer.
  5. Wood.
  6. Pith.

“That is what they are for, Tom,” said Uncle George. “Scrape away this
green layer. It is greenest on the outside and is rather thick. There
are really two or three layers there, but they cannot be separated with
a pen-knife. What do you come to next?”

“A white, woody layer with a very slippery surface,” said Frank.

“That slippery surface is itself a layer, and a very important one,”
said his uncle. “The wood, you can see, is a very thick layer. In the
centre you have a mass of dry, spongy stuff. This is called the pith.”

Uncle George then cut the twig straight across, and the boys saw that
each layer formed a ring. In the middle there was a round mass of pith.
Around this was a thick ring of wood with the thin slippery layer
outside. Outside this was a fairly thick ring, the outer half of which
was green in colour. And outside the whole lot was the ring of the thin
bark or cork which the boys had first examined.

“We have seen,” said Uncle George, “how a one-year-old stem is built.
Let us now make a clean cut through the two-year-old part of the twig,
and another through the three-year-old part.

“You see there are two rings of wood in the two-year-old part and three
rings of wood in the three-year-old part. What does this show us?”

“That a ring of wood is added every year,” said Frank.

“And so, three years ago, this thick branch was a tiny bud,” said Uncle
George, pointing to the lower part of the twig.


                         Exercises on Lesson I.

  1. An apple will keep sound for months if the skin is unbroken. If we
          remove a small piece of the skin, the apple soon shrivels up.
          How is this?
  2. Can you explain why we ought not to eat the outer skins of the
          plum, grape, tomato, pear, etc.?
  3. Cut a stout twig of any tree straight through. Make a rough sketch
          showing the different layers, and tell how old the twig is.
  4. Get stout twigs of different trees, such as ash, elm, holly,
          sycamore. Take about an inch length of each. Split these down
          the centre, and see if you can make out the different layers
          on each side of the pith. Make an enlarged drawing of one of
          these.




                          II.—BULBS AND CORMS.


“These,” said Uncle George, “are what we grow our snowdrops and crocuses
from.”

As he spoke he handed each of the boys a few hard, round objects. Some
of these were small, white, and almost pear-shaped. The others were
larger, rounder, and brown in colour.

“The small white ones are snowdrop _bulbs_,” he continued. “The others
are crocus _corms_. There is a great difference between a bulb and a
corm, as we shall see when we examine and compare them.”

“The corm is covered with brown, papery skins, and has white buds on the
top of it,” said Frank.

“These brown skins are leaves,” remarked Uncle George.

“Leaves?” said Tom. “I thought all leaves were green.”

“Oh no, Tom, there are other leaves besides green leaves, called
scale-leaves. Green leaves, as you know, give off the moisture which the
roots take up from the soil. They also take in plant-food from the air.
Scale-leaves protect buds, flowers, and tender stems from cold and from
insects. These thin brown leaves of the crocus corm are scale-leaves
formed underground. Please remove the brown scale-leaves from one of the
corms, Frank.”

                             [Illustration]

  1. Snowdrop.
  2. Tulip.
  3. Narcissus.
  4. Crocus.

When Frank had done so, it was seen that these leaves were attached in
layers all round the corm. The corm was now a white, rounded lump. The
removal of the scale-leaves had left thin rings of leaf-marks; and on
these leaf-marks, here and there a tiny bud was seen.

“Now,” said Uncle George, “we can see that a corm is a stout, swollen,
underground stem. If you could imagine a horse-chestnut stem to be
squeezed up into a lump, you would have something like a corm. These
rings of leaf-marks are the nodes, where leaves and buds are found on
all stems. The large buds on the top of the corm correspond to the large
buds at the end of your horse-chestnut stem. Now, let us take off one of
these large top buds. Notice that it is covered with many tough,
protective scale-leaves.”

                 [Illustration: Crocus Bud Dissected.]

  1. Scales.
  2, 3, 4. Parts of Flower.
  5. Leaves.
  6. Spathe.
  7. Ovary.
  8. Young Corm. A. Old Corm.

Removing these scales, Uncle George came to a round object in the
centre.

“This,” he said, “is a long sack or bag. It contains the flower of the
crocus.”

Taking a needle, he carefully opened this up.

“Now, boys,” he said, “take your magnifiers and look carefully.”

Frank and Tom looked, and saw a curious little flower, surrounded by
four or five yellow needle-shaped things which, their uncle told them,
were the young green leaves of the crocus.

“Let us now,” he said, “examine the snowdrop bulb.

“Here we have thick, fleshy scale-leaves. If we remove them one by one,
we find that they are all attached to a flat, button-shaped stem.
Between the thick scale-leaves we see, here and there, a small side bud,
and on the top the baby snowdrop flower snugly wrapped up in their sack.
This protective sack is called a _spathe_.”

Uncle George then took from his pocket a very large bulb.

“This,” he said, “is the bulb of the narcissus or ‘white lily.’ It is
almost exactly like the snowdrop bulb, but it is larger, so that we can
see things much more distinctly.”

He then split the large bulb down the centre with his knife. With a pin
he pointed out the baby flower wrapped up in its spathe. All the parts
of the flower were seen, even the little seed-vessel containing the tiny
eggs, which become seeds after the flower has grown up.

“If you remember,” said Uncle George, “in our lesson on seeds we learned
that a seed contained a baby plant and a large supply of plant-food. I
am now going to show you that both the corm and the bulb contain a large
food supply. We have seen that the protective bud-scales in the corm are
tough and thin, while the stem is swollen and hard. In the bulb, on the
other hand, the bud-scales are thick and fleshy, while the stem is flat
and very small. If we place some of our crocus corms or snowdrop bulbs
in pure water, they will grow and flower just as well as if we had
planted them in the garden. What does this show us?”

“That, like the seeds which we grew in water, bulbs and corms contain a
store of food,” said Frank.

                             [Illustration]

  A. Narcissus Bulb split open.
    s., stem;
    b., side buds;
    s.l., scale-leaves;
    f.l., leaves.
  B. Snowdrop Bulb.
  C. Flower of same Dissected out.

“That is correct, Frank. Let us put a corm and a bulb in water. Let us
also plant one of each in a pot of soil. We will watch them growing and
compare them from week to week.

“Now I am going to show you a simple experiment. You know that the food
we eat is drawn largely from plants. This food which we take from the
plant world is chiefly what the chemist calls _starch_. We have it in
bread, potatoes, rice, cornflour, and in nearly all the vegetables we
eat.

“I have here in this bottle a substance, called _iodine_, dissolved in
water. Anything containing _starch_ turns blue when touched with iodine.
Now observe what happens here.”

Uncle George poured some of the iodine into a saucer. He then dipped
into the iodine a piece of crocus corm, a thick scale of the snowdrop
bulb, soaked seeds of maize and wheat, a slice of raw potato, and a
piece of bread. Each at once turned dark blue on being dipped into the
liquid.

“Now, boys,” he said, “what do you learn from this?”

“The food store in bulbs and corms is the same as that in seeds,” said
Tom.

“The food supply of the bulb is contained in the thick, fleshy
scale-leaves, while in the corm it is in the stem,” said Frank.

“Very good,” said Uncle George. “It also shows us, I think, that we
ourselves owe a great deal to the plant world.”


                        Exercises on Lesson II.

  1. Split an onion (or tulip bulb) down the centre, and compare it with
          the snowdrop bulb. Draw it, giving special attention to the
          middle part.
  2. Take a potato and a crocus corm. Observe them both carefully, and
          find out (1) how they resemble each other, and (2) how they
          differ.
  3. Explain how it is that a hyacinth grows so well in water.
  4. Take any underground stem (_e.g._, iris or Solomon’s seal) and
          compare it with a crocus corm. Notice the marks of underground
          scale-leaves on the former.




                   III.—WHAT GOES ON INSIDE A PLANT.


“We have seen how an ordinary twig is built up,” said Uncle George. “Let
us now try to find out what goes on inside the twig; and in order to do
this we shall have to perform one or two simple experiments.”

Uncle George took two wide-mouthed glass jars. They were both perfectly
dry, and each could be closed with a large, tight-fitting cork. He
placed some fresh green leaves inside one of the jars. The other
remained empty. Then both jars were tightly corked up, and both corks
covered outside with wax.

                   [Illustration: First Experiment.]

“That is experiment number one,” he said, as he placed both jars in the
window.

He next took a small plant which was growing in a pot. He wrapped the
pot up in thick, dry paper, so that the paper covered up everything but
the plant. The edges of the paper were tied tightly round the lower part
of the stem of the plant with a string. The plant was put in the window,
and over it Uncle George placed a glass bell-jar.

                   [Illustration: Second Experiment.]

“The third experiment is much simpler,” he said. “You see I just put one
of the willow twigs into a glass half filled with water, and into the
water I pour some red ink. Frank, place a white pansy in the coloured
water beside the willow twig.”

Uncle George’s fourth experiment was as follows:—

He placed four willow twigs in a glass of water. But from two of these
twigs he first removed a broad ring of the bark and outer layers,
leaving about an inch of the wood bare near the lower end of the twig.

“Now,” said he, “we will come back in about an hour, and I think we
shall find that some change has taken place in each of our first three
jars.

“The fourth glass one will have to be left for several weeks; and we
must take care to keep water always in the glass containing these four
twigs.”

About an hour afterwards, Uncle George and the boys came to look at the
experiments.

“Let us examine experiment one first,” said Uncle George.

“The empty jar is just the same as when we put it there,” said Tom. “The
jar containing the leaves is all dimmed, and there are tiny drops of
water on the inside of it.”

“Where did that water come from, Tom?”

“It must have come out of the leaves.”

“Exactly so! Now look at the second experiment, and you will see that
the bell-jar which covered both plant and pot is also dimmed with
moisture. Pot and soil were securely covered up, so that this moisture
on the glass must have come from the leaves of the plant. Where do you
think this water really comes from?”

“From the soil in the pot,” said Frank. “If we did not water those
plants which we keep in pots, they would die.”

“Then we have learnt that water travels up the stems of plants,” said
Uncle George, “also that it is drawn from the soil and is given off by
the leaves. The third experiment, where we placed a twig in coloured
water, will, I think, show us which part of the stem the water travels
up.”

Uncle George peeled the bark off the lower end of the willow twig which
was placed in the mixture of red ink and water. He removed all the
layers until he came to the wood. The wood was stained red. He cut slice
after slice off the twig, and it was found that the coloured water had
gone quite an inch up through the wood. None of the other layers of the
twig were stained red.

“It travels up through the wood-layer,” said Frank. “And look at the
pansy flower. It was white when we put it into the glass, now it is all
streaked with red.”

“The flower itself,” said Uncle George, “is not near the coloured
water.”

“The water must have travelled up the long stalk to the flower,” said
Frank.

                 [Illustration: The Fourth Experiment.]

The fourth experiment was left in the window, and two or three weeks
passed before any change was noticed in any of the four twigs which had
been placed in the water. Then roots began to grow. In the two whole
twigs these roots grew out at the bottom end. But in those twigs from
which the belt of outer layers had been removed, it was quite different.
Here the roots grew out—not at the bottom, but just where the ring of
bare wood began and at the top of it.

Frank and Tom were quite puzzled. They could not understand why the
roots should come at the bottom in two of the twigs and not in the other
two.

“First of all, then,” said Uncle George, “these new roots were made from
materials which came from inside the plant. These building materials are
carried through the plant dissolved in water—just as you dissolve sugar
in your tea. Water containing these dissolved stuffs in a plant is
called _sap_.

“We have seen, by our first three experiments, that water travels up the
wood part of the stem. This experiment shows us that sap travels _down_
the stem in the layers outside the wood. For, when I removed the outer
layers and left a bare ring of wood, the flow of the sap was stopped and
the new roots formed there.”

“And where does this sap come from first of all?” Tom asked.

“It is really formed in the leaf first of all. I think I told you that
plants take most of their food from the air by means of their green
leaves. In the great quantities of water which pass up the wood and into
the air from the leaves there is always a very little mineral matter
dissolved. This small quantity of mineral matter comes from the soil.
This, along with water and the large quantity of matter taken from the
air, are changed, inside the leaf, into a fluid which we call sap.

“Our four experiments show us that water travels up through the
wood-layer from soil to leaf; and also that sap travels down through one
of the outside layers of the stem.”


                        Questions on Lesson III.

  1. How does water travel in a plant? How can you prove this?
  2. If we enclose a leafy plant in a glass vessel, we see that water is
          given off by the leaves. How is it that we do not see this
          water when the plant is grown in the open air?
  3. What is “sap”? Where is it first formed? How does it travel in the
          twig or stem?
  4. If we keep ferns growing under a glass bell—or in a glass case—we
          never have to water them. Can you explain this?




                    IV.—SNOWDROP, CROCUS, AND TULIP.


The boys watched the growth of the crocuses in water and in soil from
day to day, and made sketches of them once a week. Fed by the food
contained in the corm, the top buds of the crocus grew longer. Then the
scales moved apart and the yellow flower was seen. Round about it were
four or five narrow green leaves, each having a pretty white stripe down
the middle. Both leaves and flower were encircled at the base by long
white sheaths.

The crocus grown in the pot did not seem to thrive much better than the
one in the water. Both flowers remained closed for a long time after
they were full grown.

At last, on one fine sunny day, they opened out wide at the top, and the
boys could see right down into them. In the evening they closed up
again. Next day was a dull day, and the crocus flowers remained closed.

The snowdrops were also watched and sketched. Their growth was somewhat
different. From the centre of the little bulb two green leaves first
appeared. These leaves were much broader and thicker than those of the
crocus. From between these leaves a little white, flat object grew up.
This the boys at once recognised as the spathe or bag containing the
flower. Then more green leaves came up. The flower-stalk grew longer.
The spathe split open, and the flower-bud appeared.

This bud grew until it became a beautiful white bell hanging downwards.

                    [Illustration: Crocus Flowers.]

In a large pot Uncle George had planted a few tulip bulbs. They were not
completely covered with soil, so that their growth could be watched.
Their growth was similar to that of the snowdrop. The leaves came first.
They were rolled firmly round each other. As each large, broad, green
leaf unrolled, another rolled-up leaf was seen under it. These leaves
were rolled round a thick stalk, to which they were attached. When the
last leaf unrolled, a single flower was seen at the top of the stalk.
This flower remained closed up like the crocus. When at length, however,
the warm sun shone in the window, the tulip flowers opened out very wide
indeed; in fact, they became almost saucer-shaped.

Then Uncle George dug the snowdrop and crocus out of their pots. He
washed the roots and asked the boys to compare them with those grown in
water.

“The plants grown in soil seem stronger in flower and leaves,” said
Frank. “But the greatest difference is in the corm and bulb.”

“That is right, Frank,” said Uncle George. “Look at the crocus corms.
They have both shrunk a great deal, because they have been used up to
form what has grown out of them. But the one grown in soil has formed a
new corm, which will produce new flowers next year. This new corm has
grown upon the top of the old one. The crocus grown in water has also
produced a new corm, but it is too small to produce a flower next year.

“Then, again, take the snowdrop. The one grown in the soil has produced
two or three new bulbs, while that grown in water has not. These new
bulbs were the side buds we noticed between the scales when we opened
out our snowdrop bulb. In both snowdrops the old bulb has been
completely used up to form green leaves and flower.

“But the bulb grown in soil has not only produced flowers and green
leaves. It has gathered up enough material from soil and air to form new
bulbs for next year.”

  4. Young Snowdrop Flower enclosed in its spathe.
  5. Crocus Flower.
  6. Tulip Flower dissected.

Uncle George then divided the crocus flower with his knife from top to
bottom.

“At the very bottom of the flower,” he said, “you see the ovary, or
seed-vessel, containing the tiny seeds. From the seed-vessel a long thin
rod or tube stretches to the very mouth of the flower. You can also see
the remains of the spathe which once enclosed the whole flower.”

“And what are those three things covered with orange-coloured dust?”
asked Tom.

“These,” said his uncle, “are the stamens or pollen-boxes; and the
orange-coloured powder is the pollen. This pollen is carried about from
flower to flower by the bees. Pollen is necessary for the production of
seeds.

“Do you know why the seed-vessel of the crocus is so far down under the
ground?

“It is because the crocus flowers in winter-time, and the frost might
kill the young seeds. Underground they are safe from frost. The snowdrop
is a hardy flower, and, besides, the walls of its seed-vessel are very
thick.

“The tulip, if grown outside, flowers much later than the other two
plants.

“Notice the difference between the flower of the tulip and those of
either crocus or snowdrop. Its petals are all separate, while those of
the others are joined to form a bell or tube. The seed-vessel of the
tulip, also, stands right up in the centre of the flower, while that of
the snowdrop (and crocus) is placed underneath the flower altogether.”

“How is it, Uncle George, that the flowers of both tulip and crocus open
out wide when the sun shines and close when the sun goes down?” asked
Frank.

“Plants can feel to a certain extent,” said Uncle George. “That is to
say, they are affected by heat and cold, by light and shade. A great
many flowers close up at night—the daisy, for instance; and have you
never noticed how clover leaves fold up long before night comes?”

“Yes, but why should the crocus and tulip open and close? The snowdrop
never closes up.”

“They do so to protect their pollen,” his uncle answered. “Rain or dew
would ruin pollen. Those flowers, like the crocus and tulip, which open
out to the sky must close up, or the precious pollen would be destroyed.
Flowers like the snowdrop and bluebell, which hang downwards, have no
need to close up, for their pollen is under a roof of joined petals.”


                        Exercises on Lesson IV.

  1. Place an onion or daffodil bulb in the mouth of a bottle containing
          water. Keep it in the dark for about ten days. Then place it
          in the window. Make sketches every week.
  2. Make a list of all the plants you know which close their flowers,
          or fold up their leaves, at night.
  3. Cut open a flower of the daffodil (or narcissus), also one of the
          wallflower. Draw both, naming their parts. What points of
          difference do you notice in the two flowers?
  4. Examine the following flowers, and see if you can find where the
          young seeds are:—Hyacinth, primrose, violet (or pansy),
          chickweed, Christmas rose, shepherd’s purse.




                         V.—VEGETABLE FINGERS.


When the sweet-peas in the garden were nearly full grown, Uncle George
sowed some sweet-peas in a pot. In a fortnight those sown in the pot
were about four inches in height, and those in the garden were in
flower.

“Let us go into the garden, boys,” he said, “and see if we can learn
something from the sweet-pea.”

In the garden the sweet-peas were really lovely. They looked, as Frank
said, like so many beautiful butterflies on the wing; and they filled
the air with delicious perfume.

“I think,” said Frank, “that our row of sweet-peas is by far the best
thing in the garden.”

“That is quite true, Frank,” said his uncle, “but it is not so much the
flowers we are going to study at present. The sweet-pea is certainly one
of our finest flowering plants. It is also one of the most interesting.
Can you tell me why we put stakes up for our sweet-pea plants to cling
to?”

“Because they have long, slender stems—too slender and weak to grow up
by themselves,” said Frank.

“Quite right, Frank. If the sweet-pea were a wild plant, where would it
grow?”

“In the hedges,” said Tom.

“Right again,” said Uncle George. “If we grow the sweet-pea in the
garden, we must imitate its surroundings in the wild state—we must give
it a hedge of some kind to cling to, otherwise it would trail along the
ground.”

“Then it would get choked among the other plants,” said Frank.

                             [Illustration]

  Rose Leaf.
  Vetch Leaf.
  Ash Leaf.

“What do you mean by ‘_choked_,’ Frank?”

“Well, it would die for want of air”——

“And light,” his uncle added. “No green plant can live without air and
sunlight; and, in order to get these, our weak-stemmed sweet-pea has to
climb. It clings to its stronger brethren just as the wild peas do in
the hedgerow. Now notice how it climbs. The end part of each leaf
consists of little gripping organs called tendrils. These twine tightly
round the smallest twigs near them.

                             [Illustration]

  1. Ox Eye.
  2. Daisy.
  3. Corn Marigold.

“Here is a rose leaf. It is composed of several leaflets, and at its
base there are two small, brownish-green things called _stipules_. If we
compare this leaf with the leaf of the sweet-pea, we find that in some
points they are similar, but in others very different.

                             [Illustration]

  Sweet-Pea.
  Edible Pea.

“The rose leaf is called a compound leaf, because it is made up of many
small leaflets. The sweet-pea leaf is also a compound leaf, but it has
only two leaflets, and these are of enormous size. The rose leaf has two
small stipules. The stipules of the sweet-pea leaf are large and green.

“If I place the rose leaf beside a sweet-pea leaf, you will notice that
the latter has _no upper leaflets_.”

“It has tendrils ‘instead,’” said Frank.

“Exactly!” said Uncle George. “These tendrils correspond to leaflets.
Now, if the plant has been forced to turn all its leaflets, except two,
into gripping organs, how does it manage to make up for this loss of
green leaves?

                   [Illustration: Young Edible Pea.]

“We have already learned that plants take in food from the air by means
of the green substance in their leaves. The more of this green substance
a plant possesses, the more food it can take in from the air. If it
sacrifices leaves in order to climb up to the light and air, its amount
of the green material must be lessened. But the sweet-pea makes up for
this loss of leaves. Can you see how it does so?”

“The stipules are very large,” said Frank.

“And the lower part of the leaf-stalk is very flat, broad, and green,”
added Tom.

“Very good,” said Uncle George, “but look at the long, slender stem. It
has flat, green, ribbon-like outgrowths on each side throughout its
whole length. So, you see, what the plant loses in leaves, it makes up
in another way.

“Let us now look at the ordinary pea plant. Its leaf has four pairs of
leaflets and three pairs of tendrils besides the terminal tendril—seven
tendrils altogether. The stipules here are also very large—much larger
than those of the sweet-pea. But the stem is round and smooth. There are
no green outgrowths. Here is a wild pea, which I found to-day, which has
no leaves at all. All its leaflets have been turned into tendrils or
gripping organs. But look at the enormous stipules it has! They are much
bigger than ordinary pea leaves.

                             [Illustration]

  A Wild Pea with no Leaves.
  Young Sweet-Peas have no Tendrils.

“Let us now look at the tendrils of the sweet-pea, and see how they grip
their supports. Notice that they begin to twist long before they reach
the supporting twig. Then, when they have reached it, they twist round
it _in the opposite way_—just like a piece of string, if you twist it at
one end, it untwists at the other.”

“Can you see any reason for this coiling before it reaches the twig?” As
he spoke, Uncle George pulled a sweet-pea plant out from its supports,
and the boys saw that the tendril was really a spiral spring. The plant
could be pulled out a considerable length without breaking the tendril.

“You see,” Uncle George continued, “if it were not for that first
coiling of the tendril—that is to say, if the tendril grew out straight
and only began to twist when it reached the twig—the first breeze of
wind would snap the plant from its supports and it would fall to the
ground.

“Look now, at the young sweet-peas which we grew in the pot. They are
without tendrils of any kind. This shows us, I think, that the sweet-pea
was at one time a small plant, like its relative the clover. It grew in
open places and did not have to struggle for light and air. But, by and
by, when strong growing plants took up the soil, it became forced to
produce climbing organs or become choked out. And, having turned its
leaves into climbing or gripping organs, it made up for the loss of
leaves by producing large stipules and green out-growths to stem and
leaf.”


                         Exercises on Lesson V.

  1. Draw a leaf of the wild rose and one of the sweet-pea side by side.
  2. Make a list of all the climbing plants you know, and state how each
          climbs.
  3. Look for stipules on the apple, pansy, and bean leaves—make
          sketches.
  4. Those plants of the pea family which have many leaflets have smooth
          round stems. Those which have few leaflets have “winged”
          stems. Can you explain this?




                      VI.—THE GREAT WATER BEETLE.


During summer the boys paid many visits to the horse pond. Each time
they went there they saw something to interest them.

Their uncle taught them to keep perfectly still while looking into the
water. They soon came to know that this was the best way to study
pond-life, for, whenever they moved, the creatures they were watching
would dart out of sight.

One day, while they were both lying on the bank gazing into the pond, a
huge black beetle came up to the surface of the water. It remained there
for a few moments, with its head hanging downwards and its tail sticking
right out of the water. Then it dived down out of sight. In a few
minutes it came up again, and this time Frank’s net was under it before
it could escape.

Just as Frank was putting it into the glass jar, Tom whispered, “Here is
another one—quick, Frank!”

But Frank was too late; for before he could get the first beetle into
the jar, the second one had dived to the bottom of the pond. The boys
waited for a long time, hoping to see the other beetle again. At last
their patience was rewarded. The beetle came up again to the surface. As
soon as it did so, in went the net, and out came beetle number two.

“What big beauties,” said Frank. “I wonder what they are. Let us hurry
home and show them to Uncle George.”

When they got home, their uncle placed the two beetles in a glass tank
by themselves, so that they could be more easily observed.

“What do you call them, uncle?” asked Frank. “We have never seen such
large, handsome beetles before.”

            [Illustration: Dyticus Beetle, male and female.]

“Have you not?” his uncle replied. “I am surprised at that, for this
beetle is found in nearly all our ponds and ditches. It has a long Latin
name,[2] which means _Bordered Diver_, but it is commonly known as the
‘great water beetle.’ There are several kinds of these diving beetles.
This is the largest. Can you give me an idea of their size?”

And Uncle George handed Frank a small measuring rule which he carried in
his pocket.

Frank looked at the beetles, and then moved his thumb nail along the
rule.

“About an inch and a half in length,” he said.

“That is about right,” said his uncle. “Are these two beetles exactly
alike?”

“They are both about the same shape and colour. One is slightly bigger
than the other. They are both greenish-black above and brown below.
There is a curious broad border of yellow all round the edge of their
bodies,” said Tom.

“But they are not both exactly alike,” said Frank, “I notice that one is
smooth on the back, while the other’s back is all grooved.”

“You are right, Frank,” said Uncle George. “The one with the grooved
wing-cases is the female. The one with the smooth cases is the male.

        [Illustration: Fore Leg of Male, showing Sucker Organ.]

“Notice the long legs they have for swimming, and how they seem to oar
themselves through the water. Notice also that the male has a large flat
disc upon each of his fore legs. These are suckers, by which he can
cling to things.”

“Why do they come up to the surface so often?” Frank asked.

“They cannot live without air. They carry a supply of air under their
wing-cases. They just come up to renew it from time to time. This is
done by thrusting the end of their bodies out of the water as you see.”

“One would think they ought to thrust their heads out to get air,” said
Tom.

“That seems more natural to us, because we breathe with our mouths,”
said Uncle George. “These animals take in air with their tails. A great
many pond insects breathe in this curious way.”

“What do they feed upon?” Frank asked.

“They are fierce, greedy creatures,” his uncle replied. “They attack and
kill worms, tadpoles, and even small fishes.”

Uncle George threw a small worm into the tank. One of the beetles seized
it at once and began to devour it greedily. Presently the other beetle
seized an end of the worm. The boys watched closely, and saw that the
beetles’ jaws moved from side to side like a pair of pincers.

Next morning, when Uncle George and the boys went in to see the beetles,
they found only one in the tank. The other had escaped during the night.
After a careful search they found it, at the far end of the room, dead.

“Now, how do you think this beetle managed to get out of the tank and
travel all that way?” Uncle George asked.

“It must have crawled up the inside of the tank, then down the outside.
Then it must have fallen off the window-sill, and crawled right across
the floor,” said Frank.

Uncle George shook his head.

“It might,” he said, “have managed to crawl up to the edge of the tank
so long as its legs were wet. But as its long legs are made for
swimming, and not for crawling with, I can hardly see how it could have
crawled or walked all that distance.”

“Then how did it get there, Uncle George?”

In answer to Frank’s question, his uncle took the dead beetle, and
placed it on a piece of paper on the table. He next moved aside each of
the large black wing-cases with a pin.

Underneath these wing-cases the boys saw a pair of large wings neatly
folded up. Uncle George removed one of the wing-cases, and unfolded one
of the wings. Stretched out, it was longer than the beetle’s body, and
it seemed to be made up of thin, clear skin, stretched on a framework of
long, thin supports.

“Why, these beetles can fly,” said Tom.

     [Illustration: Male and Female Beetles, showing Flying Wings.]

“Of course they can,” said his uncle. “All beetles can fly. This
creature has evidently been flying about the room all night. These
insects are furnished with wings, so that they may be able to fly to
another pool when food gets scarce, or when their pool dries up.”


                        Exercises on Lesson VI.

  1. Would you keep water beetles, tadpoles, and stickle-backs together?
          Give your reasons.
  2. Water beetles cannot live without air. Explain how they get it.
  3. Compare the legs of a water beetle with those of any of our garden
          beetles.
  4. Why are water beetles furnished with wings?




                             VII.—DAISIES.


While Uncle George and Frank and Tom were having a game of cricket,
Dolly was amusing herself in another way. She had pulled a bunch of
daisies and was joining them up into a daisy chain.

                     [Illustration: Common Daisy.]

She finished her daisy chain just as her uncle and the boys finished
their game.

“We will take some daisies home,” said Uncle George. He stooped down and
dug out a whole daisy plant with his knife, while Dolly gathered a small
bunch of the flowers. When they got home Uncle George placed his daisy
plant in a saucer of water, and told the boys to bring out their
magnifiers and sketch-books.

“First of all,” he said, “I want you to look at the daisy plant. Notice
its leaves. Each leaf is broad at the end and narrow where it joins the
plant. Notice also that the leaves all form a round green mat on the
ground. Now, can you tell me what the leaf resembles in shape.”

                             [Illustration]

  1. Daisy Leaf.
  2. Primrose Leaf.
  3. Cowslip Leaf.

“It is like a spoon,” said Tom. “It is,” said his uncle; “and can you
see any reason for it being so shaped?

“You cannot? Well, I must tell you. All plants whose leaves are all at
the ground have leaves shaped something like this. The primrose and
cowslip are good examples. We have seen that plants, like the pea, climb
up so that their leaves and green parts may get as much light and air as
possible. And if you look at any tree, such as the horse-chestnut, ash,
elm, or beech, you will notice that their leaves are spread out so as to
catch as much light as possible.”

Uncle George then drew a circle.

                             [Illustration]

  1 and 2. Diagram to show Leaf arrangement of Daisy.
  3. Head of Daisy split.
  4. Outer Floret.
  5. Inner Floret.

“Now, boys,” he said, “I want you to try to fill that circle with leaves
so shaped that they will fill it without covering one another. The best
way to do so is to make them broad at the end. If you make them broad at
the base and narrow at the end, they overlap and rob each other of light
and air. Now you can see why the leaves of the daisy are so shaped.

“Take up a daisy and split it down the centre with your knife. You will
notice that the daisy is _not_ a flower, but a collection of tiny
flowers, or florets, all packed closely together upon a pad or disc, and
surrounded outside by many little green things like small leaves. These
little leaf-like things are called _bracts_.”

        [Illustration: London Pride, showing Leaf arrangement.]

“There are two distinct kinds of florets,” said Frank, looking at the
split daisy with his lens.

“Yes,” said Uncle George, “you will see them better if you remove one of
each with a pin, and examine them separately.”

“The outer florets are very large and white,” said Frank.

“They are very flat, while the inner ones are yellow and round. They are
very like small crocus flowers. What is that small two-headed thing that
comes out in the centre of each floret?”

“That is the part which leads to the seed-vessel. Can you see the
seed-vessel at the bottom of each floret?”

“Yes,” said Tom, “it is large and round. On the top of it and all round
the petal part of the floret there are long silky hairs.”

“In flowers of this kind, when the seeds are ripe they are carried away
by the wind,” said Uncle George. “The petal part withers, but the tuft
of hairs remain. They are to the seed what sails are to a ship. They are
much better seen in some other flowers related to the daisy, such as the
thistle.

“Now cut open the seed-vessel and see how many seeds it contains.”

“There is only one, I think,” said Frank.

“You think correctly,” said his uncle. “Each seed-vessel holds a single
seed.”

“The seed-vessel in the large white floret is small and flat,” said Tom.

“It is,” said Uncle George. “In fact, the outer florets seldom produce
seeds.”

“Then what is the use of them?” Tom asked.

“I’ll show you,” said Uncle George. As he spoke he took up a fresh daisy
flower.

“Look!” he said, “what a pretty flower it is, with its golden centre and
its bright white edge tipped with red. It is like a beautiful star.”

Then he pulled off all the large white florets.

“Look at it now,” he said. “It is a dingy, ugly little flower. Without
its white florets it would not be seen at all. Now perhaps you can tell
me what the large white florets are for.”

“To help us to see them at a distance,” said Frank.

“So that bees and other flying insects may be able to see them,” said
Uncle George.

“Insects visit flowers for honey, and, in doing so, carry the yellow
dust, or pollen, from flower to flower. This pollen, as I told you
before, has to do with the making of seeds: and stronger seeds are
produced if the pollen comes from another flower.

“Now compare a white floret with a yellow one, and you will notice still
another difference between them.

“Round the _stigma_—that is the forked tube which leads to the
seed-vessel—in the yellow florets, there is a yellow ring of _stamens_,
or pollen-boxes. It is shaped like a little barrel with its ends knocked
out, and the _stigma_ grows right up through it.

“In the white florets there are no pollen-boxes of any kind.

“Thus, we see that the inner florets are _perfect_ florets which produce
seeds.

“The outer florets have all run to petal. Their business is to show the
way to the plain little florets in the middle.

“There is another thing about the daisy that I should like you to
notice,” Uncle George continued. “If you go out on a dull day, or in the
evening, you will find all the daisy flowers closed up. They only open
out in bright sunshine, when all the insects are flying about.”


                        Exercises on Lesson VII.

  1. Daises are called “composite” flowers. Can you tell why? Cut a
          large “ox-eye daisy” or corn marigold through the centre and
          examine the florets carefully.
  2. Using a lens, draw separately, an inside and an outside floret.
          Make your drawings large, and name the various parts of each
          floret.
  3. Take two ox-eye daisies. Pull off all the white florets of one of
          them. Then compare them. Pin both flowers up on the wall. Go
          back about thirty paces and note which flower is best seen.
  4. The daisy leaves form a little rosette on the ground. Make a
          collection of wild plants which have similar leaves. Draw a
          single leaf of each, and compare with those of the daisy.

                   [Illustration: Nest of Chaffinch.]




                    VIII.—CHAFFINCH AND SONG-THRUSH.


It was Frank who found the chaffinch’s nest in the wood. It was built in
the fork of a small tree, about eight feet from the ground.

Although not surrounded either by branches or leaves, it was completely
hidden, for the cunning little birds had matched the outside of the nest
exactly with the bark of the tree.

Uncle George got an old chaffinch’s nest from the gardener, and showed
the boys how it was constructed. Horse-hair, feathers, and moss were
neatly woven together to form the nest. The inside was lined with finer
hairs and feathers. The outside was covered with pieces of bark, lichen,
and faded moss. These were stuck on with silken threads stolen from
spider’s webs. The whole thing looked at a distance more like a part of
the tree than a bird’s nest.

                   [Illustration: A CHAFFINCH’S NEST]

                       [Illustration: THE THRUSH]

The next time the boys went to see the nest they found four tiny eggs in
it. They were bluish-green in colour, and splashed with red and brown
marks.

It was while paying a third visit to the chaffinch’s nest that Uncle
George found the nest of the song-thrush.

High up on a tall tree the cock thrush was pouring out his song, and
filling the woods with melody.

“Can you see him, boys?” Uncle George asked, and he handed Frank a pair
of field-glasses which he used for watching the birds.

“Oh, yes,” said Frank, “I can see him quite plainly. He is a brown bird,
with a white and yellow breast, all dotted over with small dark spots.”

“He is not such a beautiful bird as the chaffinch,” said Uncle George,
“but he is a much finer singer. Our prettiest birds are by no means our
best songsters. The lark, thrush, linnet, and nightingale are all plain
birds to look at, but they are by far our sweetest singers.”

“Tell us what you see through the glasses, Tom?”

“I can see him nicely,” said Tom. “He holds his head high in the air, as
if he were singing to the sky. His bill is wide open, and the feathers
of his throat are moving rapidly as he sings.”

“I think,” said Uncle George, “that his nest must be near. Let us look
for it.”

Just as Uncle George moved, a brown bird flew out of a low bush close at
hand.

“Ah, ha!” said Uncle George, “I thought we should find it. We have
disturbed the hen bird. She has been sitting on her eggs all the time.”

He moved the branches of the bush gently aside, and the boys saw a large
nest made of dried grass. It was not very high up, and the boys, by
standing on an old tree stump, could look down into it.

“Oh, what pretty eggs,” said Tom. “There are four of them, Uncle George.
They are light blue in colour, and sprinkled with black spots.

                             [Illustration]

  Egg of Song-Thrush.
  Egg of Chaffinch.

“The nest is quite smooth and hard inside. What is that queer brown
stuff all over the inside of the nest?”

“That is clay, Tom. When the thrushes have built their nest, they line
the inside of it with clay. This clay is soft at first, but it soon
dries and turns quite hard.

“But, come, let us go, boys. The cock thrush has stopped his singing. He
and his little wife are flying about in great alarm.”

When they came to the chaffinch’s neat little nest in the fork of the
tree, they got a great surprise. The four little mottled eggs were gone.
In their place were four tiny naked creatures, with little tufts of dark
coloured down upon their heads and necks. They had very large mouths,
and their eyes were closed.

“Oh, what funny little things,” said Frank.

As soon as he spoke, the baby chaffinches stretched out their slender
little necks, opened their wide, gaping mouths, and cried for food.

“_Pink, Pink, Pink!_” came from a neighbouring tree.

“Come down, Frank!” Uncle George whispered. “Let us go back from the
nest, and we will perhaps see the old birds feeding them.”

With another “_Pink, Pink, Pink_,” the cock chaffinch flew down and
stood on the edge of the nest. He had something in his bill. This he
dropped into one of the gaping little mouths, and flew away.

Next came the hen bird with something in her bill. She fed another of
the hungry little birds, and flew away also.

The boys were greatly interested. They wanted to stay the whole
afternoon and watch the chaffinches feeding their young, but their uncle
would not allow this.

“No, no, my dear boys,” he said, “we must not annoy our little feathered
friends too much, or they may forsake their beautiful nest and their
helpless young ones.

“We will come back in a fortnight and see the young birds. You will not
know them then, for they will be fully fledged.”

“What do you mean by ‘fully fledged,’ Uncle George?” Tom asked.

“It means covered all over with feathers, does it not?” said Frank.

Their uncle nodded.

“Are these little birds not cold without feathers?” asked Tom.

“Oh, dear, no,” his uncle answered. “During the day they cuddle up
together in their cosy nest. At night the mother bird folds her wings
over the nest.”

“Where does the cock bird go at night?” asked Tom.

“He sleeps on a branch quite near the nest,” his uncle answered.

                    [Illustration: Rooks and Nest.]

“I have just two more questions to ask, Uncle George,” said Frank. “What
do the chaffinches feed their young ones on? and what becomes of the
young birds after they are fledged?”

“They feed their young chiefly on small worms, flies, grubs, beetles,
and other insects. When the young chaffinches are fledged, their parents
lead them from the nest. They teach them to fly, and show them where to
find their food. They never lose sight of them until they are quite
grown up and able to take care of themselves.”


                       Exercises on Lesson VIII.

  1. Describe and compare the nests of rook, thrush, and chaffinch.
          Where would you look for each?
  2. How does the chaffinch, in building his nest, imitate the colour of
          the tree it is built on. Can you see any special reason for
          this?
  3. Make a list of all the British birds you know. Then divide this
          list into—(1) pretty birds; (2) plain birds; (3) singing
          birds.
  4. Write a description of any bird’s nest you have seen, stating where
          and how it was built, and also what you learned from it.

                    IX.—PLANTS THAT ARM THEMSELVES.


“Some time ago,” said Uncle George, “I promised to tell you something
about how plants arm themselves. And here, in this hedgerow, we have
some good examples of armed plants.”

“There is the stinging nettle,” said Tom, pointing to a large patch at
the roadside.

“The stinging nettle is certainly well protected,” said his uncle. “You
have only to touch any part of it lightly with your hand to find that
out. Every part of the plant is covered with small needle-shaped hairs.
These hairs are hollow and contain a poisonous juice. At the base of
each hair there is a bag filled with this juice, while the tip of each
is sharp and very brittle.

“When your hand touches a nettle—unless you grasp it tightly—the sharp
hair pierces the skin. It’s brittle point breaks off and the poisonous
juice is poured out.”

“Why is the nettle covered with these horrid stings?” asked Frank.

“To save it from being eaten up, of course. The nettle is a tender and
juicy plant, and, if it were not for its stings it would soon disappear
altogether.

“Now, here is another armed plant, the blackberry or bramble. The stem
and also the backs of the leaves are covered with large curved prickles.
These prickles not only protect the plant from grazing animals, but they
help it to climb and scramble up walls and hedges.

“If you try to pull a bramble branch down out of the hawthorn hedge, you
will find it rather difficult, for its large prickles are all turned one
way. They are really sharp hooks.”

“Here is a wild rose bush. It is also covered with large hooked
prickles,” said Frank.

“Yes, Tom, and, like the bramble, it threads its way among stronger and
taller plants.

“The wild gooseberry growing close beside it is also armed with
prickles. But the prickles of the gooseberry are for protecting its
tender leaves. It is not a climbing plant like the rose and bramble. The
raspberry also is covered with many sharp little prickles. There is a
clump of these plants growing at the other side of the road. Let us cut
off a small branch of each of these plants and take them home.”

                     [Illustration: Armed Plants.]

  1. Thistle.
  2. Blackberry.
  3. Whin.
  4. Barberry.
  5. Raspberry.
  6. Sloe.
  7. Buttercup.

“This is the most prickly plant of all,” said Frank, as he halted before
a huge thistle. “You can scarcely touch it without getting severely
pricked.”

“The thistle is well armed,” said Uncle George. “There are sharp
prickles on its leaves, on its stem, and on its flowers.”

As they walked down the road they came upon a mass of whin bushes.

“Here,” said Uncle George, “we have a plant which has turned its leaves
into sharp spines.” He bent down and pulled up a tiny plant which was
growing under the larger gorse bushes. “Look at this little plant, boys.
This is a young whin plant.”

“But it is not a bit like the whin, Uncle George,” said Tom. “Its leaves
are soft and flat. They are more like clover leaves. There are no spines
or prickles on this little plant.”

“That is so, Tom; but still it is a young whin plant.

                      [Illustration: Young Whins.]

“There are a great many of these young whins growing under the older
bushes. Let us take a few of them home. If we grow one of them in a pot,
and supply it with plenty of water, we will find that it will _never_
produce sharp prickles.”

“That is very wonderful,” said Frank.

“It is,” said Uncle George, “and it teaches us something of the whin’s
history. Like the nettle, the whin is a juicy plant, and, if it were not
for its prickles, would be eaten by cows, sheep, and horses. In fact,
some farmers give whins to their horses. Of course the whins are passed
through a mill first. The mill crushes the whins and destroys the
prickles.

“It shows us that many, many years ago the whin was a soft-leaved plant
like the clover. It grew in moist soil. But by and by other plants
invaded the land. These plants grew more quickly than the whin, and
choked it out of the rich moist soil. Forced to grow upon bare
hill-sides and commons, the soft-leaved juicy whin would be destroyed by
grazing animals if it did not arm itself with sharp spines.

“Here is the blackthorn or sloe. It bears many hard, sharp-pointed
spines. Yet, if we grow a sloe plant in the garden, we find that its
sharp spines gradually disappear. They become branches bearing leaves
and flowers.

“But plants have other ways of protecting themselves against animals.
Look through the hedge into the meadow and you will notice that while
the grass has been eaten bare, there are other plants which have been
left to grow up untouched. Buttercups grow up all over the field, and
tall ragwort plants. How is it that the cows do not eat these plants?
They are not armed with spines or prickles.

“They protect themselves in another way. They contain bitter or
poisonous juices. No cow will eat a buttercup. If it did so it would be
ill and uncomfortable for a time.

“I want you to notice, boys, that—with the exception of those plants,
like the bramble and wild rose, which use their prickles for climbing as
well as for protection—all our armed plants grow in exposed places. The
thistle and whin are good examples of this.”


                        Exercises on Lesson IX.

  1. Take in twigs of hawthorn, barberry, holly, bramble, and
          gooseberry. Examine, and sketch them so as to show their
          protective parts.
  2. Grow a small whin bush in a pot and water it daily. Note that the
          _new growth_ it makes is tender, and that _no spines_ are
          produced.
  3. Some plants are covered with dense woolly hairs. These are seldom
          eaten by cattle. Can you explain why?
  4. Make a list of all the armed plants you know, and tell how each is
          protected.




                        X.—THE HORSE POND AGAIN.


Frank and Tom returned from the horse pond one day with their jars
filled with curious creatures.

“We took the water beetle back to the pond, Uncle George,” said Frank,
“and I almost felt sorry to let such a cruel and greedy monster loose
among the other creatures in the pond.”

“You have here creatures even more cruel and greedy than the diving
beetle,” said his uncle, looking into the glass jars which the boys had
brought.

“Here is the larva of the diving beetle, and a fiercer or greedier
creature is not to be found in the whole world.”

Uncle George refilled the three large tanks. He poured the contents of
one of the jars into one of the tanks. It contained, besides the larvæ
he spoke of, a number of tadpoles, some small stickle-backs, and a great
many water snails or whelks.

In addition to these, there were one or two curious insects, with a pair
of very long legs. They came to the surface every now and then, and
moved their long limbs like oars. Whenever the tank was touched, they
would suddenly dive to the bottom. Here they would remain for a short
time, then, returning to the surface, would “oar” themselves along as
usual.

“What are these queer things, Uncle George?” Tom asked. “They look
exactly like little boats.”

“They are beetles,” Uncle George replied, “and they do resemble little
row-boats—so much so that they are called ‘water boatmen.’ This beetle’s
body is shaped like a boat, and he lies on his back and moves his very
long hind legs exactly like oars. He has a large, sharp beak, which you
can see if you look closely.”

Just as Uncle George was speaking, a small fly alighted on the surface
of the water. It was immediately seized by a water boatman, who dived
with it to the bottom of the tank.

                             [Illustration]

  1. Water Boatman.
  2. Water Whelk.
  3. Water Hog Louse.

“That is how the creature feeds,” said Uncle George. “When an unlucky
fly comes near, he seizes it with his two fore pairs of short legs,
drives his cruel beak deep into its body, and dives with it to the
bottom of the pool. When he has drowned his victim, he devours it at
leisure.

“But let us look at the creature I first spoke of—the larva of the
diving beetle.”

There were several in the tank. Uncle George lifted one out with a small
gauze net. He placed it in a saucer of water and asked the boys to
sketch it.

“It has six legs,” said Frank. “Its head is large and flat, and there
are two things like horns sticking out of it.”

“These are the creature’s jaws,” said his uncle.

Uncle George touched the creature’s head with the point of his pencil.
Instantly the long, curved fangs moved apart, and the creature sprang at
the pencil and closed its fangs upon the wood.

                             [Illustration]

  1. Larva of Diving Beetle.
  2, 3. Head, showing how Fangs work.
  4. Larva seizing Tadpole.

“What a fierce creature,” said Tom.

“Yes,” replied his uncle. “We must remove the others from the tank, or
there will be nothing left alive in it. See, one of them has caught a
tadpole already.” And, sure enough, the creature had sunk his cruel
pincers deep into the body of a tadpole. He shook the tadpole as a dog
would shake a rat.

“Those huge fangs are hollow,” Uncle George continued. “With them he
sucks every drop of blood from his victim’s body. In this way he devours
tadpoles, whelks, little fishes, and even his own weaker brethren.

“We shall have to put these larvæ in a tank by themselves, and feed them
upon pieces of fresh raw meat, to keep them from devouring one another.

“Now, boys, I am going to describe this larva. Look closely, and see if
I am right. You can correct your drawings as we go along.

“His body, which is nearly two inches long, is narrow at each end and
broad at the middle. It is divided into twelve segments, and to each of
the first three of these segments a pair of legs are attached. His
large, flat head is almost heart-shaped. At its broad end are a pair of
large, beady eyes, three pairs of organs which look like feelers, and
the two large, curved fangs with which he seizes his prey.

“Notice how beautifully the legs are adapted for swimming. They are
edged with long, stiff hairs, which stand out flat with every down
stroke, but fold in when the legs move upwards. That is how the creature
is such a graceful swimmer.

“The last three segments of his body are thickly covered with long
hairs. His tail is divided into two long plumes. You can see what these
are for, I hope.”

“Oh yes,” said Frank. “Like the parent beetle, the larva comes often to
the surface and hangs downwards with his tail exposed to the air. So
these plumes must be his breathing organs.”

“And do these long, slender creatures actually become broad, stout
beetles like the one we returned to the pond to-day?” Tom asked.

“Yes, Tom, they do. Just as your green caterpillar became a beautiful
white butterfly. These larvæ hatched out of eggs which were laid by the
female beetle in the stem of some water weed. She first cuts a slit in
the water weed, and then places an egg in the slit.

“When the larvæ are full grown, they crawl out of the pond and bury
themselves in ground. Here they pass the winter in the pupa stage. They
come out in spring, fully-formed beetles, and pass the remainder of
their lives in the water.”

“What are these curious creatures that crawl among the water weeds?”
Frank asked. “They are very like the ‘slaters’ which we find among old
wood-work in the garden.”

“That creature is the ‘water hog.’ Its proper name is _Asellus_, and it
is very closely related to the garden ‘slater’ or wood-louse.

“These water hogs, like the whelks, are very useful in an aquarium. They
eat up all waste matter, and so help greatly to keep the water fresh.

“By the by, I want you to watch the whelks from day to day. They usually
lay their eggs in a clear, broad band on the inside of the glass tank;
and with our lenses we can watch the changes in these eggs nicely.”


                         Exercises on Lesson X.

  1. Procure some “water boatmen” from the nearest pond (see Appendix),
          feed them upon flies, and watch their habits. Notice
          particularly their method of swimming and of feeding.
  2. We should not keep all our pond animals in one tank. Can you
          explain (giving examples) why this is?
  3. Write the life-history of the diving beetle.
  4. Make large sketches of the diving beetle and its larva. Compare
          them.

                               XI.—WASPS.


The wasp’s nest was found at the edge of the wood, hanging from the
branch of a small tree. It was greyish white in colour, shaped like a
pear, and about the size of a hen’s egg.

                             [Illustration]

  Queen Wasp.
  Worker Wasp.
  Queen Bee.
  Worker Bee.

Uncle George removed it from the branch and carried it home carefully,
for it was very light and very fragile. He took a pair of scissors and
cut through the thin walls so as to remove nearly half of the coverings.
When he had finished cutting, two thin, papery shells fell upon the
table, one a size smaller than the other.

“Examine the stuff the wasp’s nest is made of, and tell me what it is
most like, boys,” he said.

“It is more like paper than anything else,” said Tom.

“It _is_ paper,” said his uncle.

“Where did the wasps find this paper?” Frank asked.

“Not ‘_wasps_,’ Frank, but _wasp_,” his uncle answered, “for this nest
was all built by _one_ wasp. The insect did not find the paper. She made
it. It was the wasp who first taught man to make paper.

“The queen wasp awakens from her winter sleep in spring, and at once
sets about making her nest. She gathers tiny fragments of wood and bark,
chews them up, and mixes them with a fluid from her mouth. This, when it
hardens, is paper.

“First she makes a stiff rod, or pillar, of paper. This hangs down from
the branch and forms the centre of the nest. Round this are built the
walls of her house.

“Observe, boys, that there are two distinct walls of paper, one inside
the other; and there is a wide air space between them all the way round.
The entrance to the nest is at the bottom. Round the centre pillar there
is a little thing shaped like an opened umbrella. If you look underneath
this, you will see something curious, I think.”

“Oh,” said Frank, “it is divided into six cells, and in each cell there
is a small, stout maggot or grub. I can see them moving.”

“These are the young wasps,” said Uncle George. “Like your butterflies
and caddis flies, the wasp passes through egg, larva (or caterpillar),
and pupa stage before it becomes a perfect insect. These are in the
larva stage but, unlike your caterpillars, they have no legs, and they
cannot feed themselves.”

“Then the mother wasp must have laid an egg in each cell,” said Frank,
“and these grubs hatched out of them.”

“That is so,” said Uncle George. “You see what a clever and industrious
creature a wasp is. To build this beautiful nest all alone and unaided,
and to rear and feed her helpless grubs, is a task indeed.”

“What are the wasp grubs fed on?” asked Frank.

“At first,” said Uncle George, “they are fed on animal food, and this
keeps the queen wasp hunting insects all day long. As they grow older,
they are fed upon honey.

                             [Illustration]

  Same Nest in Autumn.
    A. Combs of cells.
    B. Supporting pillars.
    C. Entrance.
    DD. Inner and Outer walls.
    E. Air space.

“The wasps which come from these first eggs are ‘worker’ wasps. As soon
as they are hatched out, they begin to enlarge the nest. This they do by
removing the inside wall and building a new and larger outer wall. This
is done from time to time, until at last the nest becomes as big as an
ordinary-sized turnip. While this is going on, more and more cells are
being built inside, until at last five or six large combs of cells fill
the inside of the nest. The queen wasp lays an egg in each cell as it is
formed; and the worker wasps gather food and nurse the young grubs until
they become perfect wasps.

“By and by some young queens, or female wasps, are hatched out. These
lay eggs, and soon the population the paper nest numbers many
thousands.”

“And that is why the gardener kills every wasp he sees in spring time,”
said Frank.

“Every wasp we see in spring,” said Uncle George, “is a queen wasp. If
allowed to live, each queen would become the founder of a nest and the
mother of thousands of wasps.”

“But why destroy the wasps?” asked Tom.

“Because wasps are very destructive and dangerous insects,” said Uncle
George. “They destroy our best fruit, and their sting is poisonous,
sometimes causing death.”

            [Illustration: Wasp’s Nest inside Wren’s Nest.]

During the summer the boys found several wasp’s nests. One was built
under-ground at the roadside. Another was built inside a wren’s nest.
The queen wasp who built it had driven the wrens out. A third nest hung
from the branch of a gooseberry bush in the garden.

                 [Illustration: Humble Bees and Nest.]

The latter was watched by Uncle George and the boys as it grew larger
and larger. Soon, however, the wasps became too numerous. One day they
chased Tom and Frank out of the garden and stung them badly. Then Uncle
George removed the nest. Putting on his bee-veil and gloves, he cut off
the branch from which the nest hung. He put nest and branch inside a
large box; and, having placed a saucer containing burning sulphur inside
the box, he closed the lid.

                   [Illustration: Nest of Tree Wasp.]

In the morning the wasps were all dead, and the boys examined the huge
nest. Thus they were able to see queens, workers, and male wasps, eggs,
larvæ, and pupæ, and to make drawings of each.

“What becomes of the wasps in winter?” Frank asked his uncle.

“They come to a sad end, Frank,” said Uncle George. “They do not store
food like the hive bee, and so, when the cold weather comes, they starve
to death.

                             [Illustration]

  Queen Humble Bee.
  Worker Humble Bee.

“Our good-humoured and hard-working friend, the humble bee, shares the
same fate. A few young queens leave the nest before winter comes on.
These bury themselves in mossy banks and sleep the winter through.”


                        Exercises on Lesson XI.

  1. Look under low branches of larch and spruce trees in spring for the
          nest of the wasp. Make a drawing of it. Cut it open and
          examine the interior.
  2. Compare a piece of the wall of the nest with the torn edge of (1) a
          piece of coarse brown paper and (2) a piece of ordinary
          newspaper.
  3. Write out the life-history of a wasp.
  4. Compare the combs of the hive bee with those of the wasp. Notice
          that the former are placed vertically in the nest, the latter
          horizontally. Observe how the wasp’s combs are kept apart.




                          XII.—THE DANDELION.


Uncle George and the boys were having a stroll along a lane where briar
and hawthorn and all sorts of wild flowers grew. Although it was an
October day the sun was shining brightly, and all along the wayside the
golden flowers of the dandelion opened wide to the sunlight.

“I thought that the dandelion was an early summer flower,” said Frank.

“So it is,” said his uncle; “but this year the autumn has been so warm
that our dandelions are flowering a second time. This often happens with
many of our wild flowers during an extra mild season.

“You ought to dig up one of these dandelion plants, take it home and
grow it in a pot. It is a most interesting plant to observe, especially
the growth and ripening of its seeds. I see here dandelion flowers in
almost every stage of their growth.

“If you look you will find among the wide open flower-heads many others
which are closed. Let us split a few of these down the centre, and we
will find that they are not all alike.

“Here is one with a bright yellow tip. This one has not yet opened. If
you use your lens you will notice that, like the daisy, this is not a
single flower, but is made up of a great many small yellow florets.
These florets stand upon a flat round disc, and they are surrounded by
two rings of green things called bracts. One set of these bracts stands
up straight. These protect the florets. They open and close the flower.
The down pointing bracts protect the flower from ants and crawling
insects.

                       [Illustration: Dandelion.]

“Now, Frank, look at the split flower and tell me what you see with your
glass.”

“The florets are all of one kind,” said Frank. “They are all strap
shaped, and there are a great many of them. The younger florets are in
the middle.”

“If you were to pull the florets out and count them you would find about
three hundred of them in a single flower-head,” said Uncle George.

                             [Illustration]

  1. Dandelion Flower-head not yet opened.
  2. Single Floret of same.
  3, 4, 5. Flower-head closed for Seed ripening.
  6. Second time of opening.

“Now, take one single floret and examine it, please. It is very like the
outer (white) florets of the daisy. But it is more complete. There is a
large seed-vessel at the bottom. Just above this there are a great
number of long silky hairs. You will see what these are for by and by.
The lower part of the floret is tubular, but it opens up into a long
yellow strap-shaped petal. There are really five petals all joined
together here.”

“Oh yes,” said Frank, “at the top of the floret I can see five distinct
teeth, and five ridges run down from them. I also see the barrel-shaped
ring of stamens.”

“Let us gather some more of the closed flowers,” said Uncle George.

“Here are two other closed flowers. One of them has a yellow tip,
withered and faded almost to brown. The other has a white woolly tip.”

“Have these not opened yet?” Tom asked.

“Oh yes! they have opened and closed up again. The dandelion opens out
to the sun so that flying insects may visit it and carry pollen from
flower to flower. When it has received, in this way, enough pollen to
enable its seeds to form, it closes up completely and remains closed
until its seeds are ripened. During this time the short stalk between
the seed-vessel and petal part grows long. If you look again at a single
floret you will see that this short stout stack bears the long straight
hairs I spoke of. The flower-head closes so tightly that the yellow
strap-shaped petal parts of the florets are squeezed together into a
bunch. They soon wither. Meantime all the hair-tipped seed-stalks are
growing longer and longer. At last they push the bunch of withered
petals right out of the flower and it falls off.”

Uncle George then gathered a few more closed heads, and, by cutting them
open, showed the boys all the stages in the growth of the seeds.

“When the dandelion flower-head opens for the last time, instead of a
flat golden mass of florets, this is what appears.” As he spoke, Uncle
George pointed to a dandelion head which was one huge fluffy ball of
stalked seeds.

Frank held it up and blew his breath upon it. Immediately all the seeds
went sailing through the air.

“Why does the flower-head keep closed when the seeds are ripening?”
asked Tom.

“Because,” answered Uncle George, “not only has the seed to ripen, but a
plumed stalk has to be formed by means of which the seed is carried away
from the parent plant. These plumes have to be perfectly dry or they
would be of no use as sails to the seed. Notice that it is only on dry
days that these ‘clocks’ of the dandelion appear.”

“But, Uncle George,” said Frank, “are these seeds actually fitted with
feathery tops so that they may be carried far away from the parent
plant?”

“Certainly, my boy. You would not have them all trying to grow in the
place where the parent plant grows, would you? There would be no room
for three hundred seeds to grow there. Besides that, the parent plant
has already exhausted the soil. It is necessary that they should seek
pastures new, and therefore the seeds of most plants are furnished with
some means of travelling.”

“Are all seeds carried by the wind?” Tom asked.

“Oh dear no,” Uncle George replied, “plants have many ways of scattering
their seeds. Some plants, by suddenly bursting their seed-vessels, shoot
their seeds far out; some seeds are furnished with little hooks which
grip on to the fur of passing animals; some are carried by birds; but by
far the greater number are scattered by the wind.

“We shall learn more about these at some future time. Meantime we will
grow a dandelion plant at home, and watch the opening and closing of its
flowers, and the wonderful way in which its travelling seeds are
produced.”


                        Exercises on Lesson XII.

  1. Gather dandelion flowers at different stages of growth. Draw, on a
          large scale, a single floret from each,
  2. Draw a leaf of the dandelion. Compare it with a primrose leaf. See
          if you can make out, from the shape of the leaf, why the plant
          is called “dandelion” (_dent de lion_ = “lion’s tooth”).
  3. Take in a dandelion plant bearing young flowers. Keep the root in
          well-watered soil, or in water only, and watch the growth of
          its flowers.
  4. Make a list of all the wind-carried seeds you know, and give a
          drawing or short description of each.

                              XIII.—TROUT.


One day in November the postman brought Uncle George a small wooden box.
There were holes bored in the sides and top of it. The box, when opened,
seemed to be filled with damp moss; but when some of this moss was
removed there was found in the middle of the box a piece of folded
muslin.

    C. Trout Eggs.

    C. Perforated zinc tray to fit box.

Uncle George laid the muslin on the table, and opened it out. It
contained a number of tiny pink balls, much smaller than peas.

“These are the trout eggs you promised to get for us, are they not?”
said Frank.

“They are,” said Uncle George, “and we must put them into running water
at once. I have a bottle here ready for them.”

Uncle George filled a wide-mouthed bottle with water from the tap and
placed the eggs in it. He then corked it with a cork in which he had
bored two holes.

Into each of the holes he had fitted a tube. One tube was long enough to
reach almost to the bottom of the bottle. The other was bent over the
outside of the bottle.

The straight tube was connected with the water tap by a piece of
indiarubber tubing. He then turned the tap on gently, so that the water
went in by the straight tube and came dripping out by the bent tube.

“Trout require a constant supply of fresh water,” he said. “Their eggs
are usually laid in shallow streams.

“Now, boys, I want you to watch these eggs and note down any changes you
see in them. You can remove the bottle from the tap at any time, but you
must not keep it more than fifteen minutes at a time, or your trout will
not hatch.”

At the end of a week the boys noticed two black dots and a coiled white
line in each egg.

In two weeks more some curious-looking creatures were seen wriggling
about among the eggs. As there were some empty egg-skins to be seen,
they guessed that these lively creatures must be young trout.

They were not a bit like fish. Each seemed to be made up of a long white
streak, which looked like the “backbone” of a fish, a big, clumsy yellow
bag with red veins running through it, and two large black spots that
looked like eyes.

In a few days all the eggs hatched out, and in place of the little pink
eggs there was a crowd of these wriggling creatures and a number of
empty egg-skins. The boys were puzzled, and Uncle George had to be
consulted.

          [Illustration: Six Stages in Development of Trout.]

“I don’t think these were trout eggs,” said Frank. “The creatures that
came out of them are not a bit like fishes. They swim on their sides and
have a huge yellow bag attached to their bodies.”

“They _are_ young trout, I can assure you, Frank,” said his uncle
laughing. “If you remember, your tadpoles were not a bit like frogs when
they hatched out of the egg. These huge bags you talk of are called
‘yolks.’ Each trout when hatched is furnished with a huge yolk or food
supply.

“The tadpole, when hatched, has also got a yolk upon which he lives
without eating for four or five days. Our trout will require no food for
six weeks. During that time the yolk will become smaller and smaller,
and at last disappear entirely. While the yolk is shrinking, you will
notice that the creature gradually assumes the form of a fish.”

Uncle George emptied the bottle containing the young trout into a wooden
box which he had made. This box was fifteen inches long, four inches
broad, and four inches deep. The inside of it he had charred with a
red-hot iron after it was put together. It was placed under the tap, and
the water dripped into it all day and all night.

Frank made a small gauze net about the size of a dessert-spoon, and with
this they lifted troutlets out of the box whenever they wanted to
examine them.

As their uncle had said, the creatures changed from day to day. By
placing a single trout in a white saucer, the boys could note these
changes; but they were such lively little creatures that making good
sketches of them was somewhat difficult.

First the big black dots became more like eyes. Then delicate fins and
tail appeared, and mouths which opened and shut. At the top of the
yolk-sac, just under the head, the boys could see a little red thing
like a heart beating constantly. As the yolk-sac grew smaller, the
little fish’s body grew more shapely, and tiny brown spots appeared all
over it.

At last, at the end of six weeks, the yolk was completely gone, and the
young trout were now beautiful little fish, shaped and coloured exactly
like big trout.

Then Uncle George began to feed them. They were fed four times a day on
the yolk of an egg which had been boiled for half an hour. A very small
quantity of this hard yolk was squeezed through a piece of gauze into
the water, and the little fishes dashed at it and gobbled it up
greedily.

They were so rapid in their movements, swimming about and leaping out of
the water, that the boys were never tired of watching them.

“What are the brown spots on a trout for?” Frank asked his uncle one
day.

“The trout is protected by his colour,” said Uncle George. “Each trout
is coloured like the bed of the stream he lives in, and the spots
resemble grains of sand and tiny pebbles. The trout can change his
colour, like the frog, as I will show you.”

Uncle George took two trout out of the box and placed them in a glass
dish. He placed the dish in a white saucer, and so arranged it that
water was kept flowing into and out of it.

Next day he took two more trout out of the box and placed them in the
glass dish. It was then seen that the first two trout had grown quite
light in colour. They were much paler than those taken out of the box,
the inside of which was charred and black.

One day Uncle George found two of the trout dead in the box.

“I am afraid, boys,” he said, “that we cannot keep them confined any
longer. Get a large pail full of water, and we will carry them to the
brook.”

“We must come here and fish next year, Frank,” said Tom, after the trout
were transferred to the brook. “How long will it be before they become
big trout, Uncle George?”

“They are now about an inch long,” said Uncle George. “In a year they
will be four inches long. In about three years, if they are not devoured
by larger trout, they will weigh about a pound apiece.”

“I think it is a shame to kill such pretty little creatures,” said
Frank.

“I quite agree with you, Frank,” said his uncle.


                       Exercises on Lesson XIII.

  1. Compare a newly-hatched trout with a seed (bean). How do they
          resemble, and how do they differ from one another?
  2. The trout is protected by its colour markings. Make a list of any
          other animals you know that are “colour protected.”
  3. If you put a fish (trout) into water which has been boiled and
          allowed to cool, it dies. What are your reasons for this?
  4. Make notes, with sketches, of the development of a young trout from
          the time it is hatched until it requires food.




                            XIV.—SILKWORMS.


The silkworm eggs came in a very small box. They were sent by a friend
of Uncle George’s who lived in the south of England. The eggs were stuck
to pieces of paper in scattered groups. Some pieces of paper had only
one or two eggs on them, others had as many as forty. They were small,
round things, flattened on the top, and coloured light green. They
reminded the boys of small mustard seeds, but they were not so round.

In answer to Frank’s question as to why the eggs were laid in irregular
groups, Uncle George answered:

“When the silk-moth emerges from her pupa case, she lays her eggs
anywhere on the floor of her cage. As the eggs are coated with a gluey
material when newly laid, they stick firmly to the floor.

“Those people who rear silkworms always have a sheet of clean paper
covering the floor of the cage before egg-laying commences. After the
eggs are laid, they are found adhering to this sheet of paper. The paper
is taken out of the larva cage, and those parts containing eggs are cut
out with scissors.”

“How many eggs are laid by one moth,” Frank asked.

“From four to five hundred,” his uncle replied. “Let us get our larva
cage cleaned out, and we will put these eggs in the lower part of it and
await their hatching.”

“Why in the _lower_ part,” Frank asked, as he set about cleaning the
cage.

“Because its floor is a drawer which can be pulled out. If you put them
in the upper part, you must lay a sheet of paper on the floor first, for
your silkworms must not be handled on any account.”

“And how long do we have to wait for these eggs to hatch?” asked Tom.

                      [Illustration: Larva Case.]

“That depends altogether upon the amount of warmth they receive, Tom.
They will remain unhatched ever so long if kept in a cool place; but
whenever they are placed where they can get the necessary amount of
warmth, they begin to hatch. Let us put them in the front window, where
they can get most sunshine.”

About a week after the larva cage was placed in the window, Frank
reported to his uncle that some of the eggs had turned white.

“Take your lens and examine carefully those eggs which have lost their
colour,” said Uncle George.

Lifting out one of the small pieces of paper with eggs on it, Frank
examined it with the glass.

“Oh,” he said, “these colourless eggs are just empty shells, and there
are two small creatures crawling along the edge of the paper. How small
they are! They are no longer than the breadth of a pin-head. They are
almost black in colour, covered all over with hair, and have very large
heads.”

“Well, these are newly-hatched silkworms,” said Uncle George, “and they
are already looking for food. Run out to the garden and bring in some
fresh lettuce leaves.”

Uncle George carefully dried the lettuce leaves before putting them into
the cage. In two days all the eggs were hatched, and in their place were
as many black, hairy, crawling little creatures with clumsy heads.
Although they did not seem to eat much, they grew very rapidly. When
three days old, they were fully twice as big as when hatched.

In five days the silkworms seemed to have increased in number as well as
in size. In fact, there seemed to be twice as many grubs as there were
of eggs.

Then Uncle George explained that half of these were not grubs, but
simply empty skins.

“The silkworm, in order to grow, must cast its skin,” he said. “It does
this four times during its lifetime. Look out for another _moult_, or
skin-casting, in four days’ time.”

Four days later the grubs cast their skins again, just as Uncle George
had said. They were now about half an inch in length, and much lighter
in colour.

In six further days they moulted a third time. Instead of dingy, hairy
grubs, they were now hairless caterpillars, yellowish-white in colour,
and with round black heads. Their fourth and last moult took place in
another week. By this time they were over an inch in length. They now
began to eat the lettuce leaves ravenously, and grew very fast. For ten
days they ate much and grew rapidly. Then they seemed to get tired of
feeding, and began to crawl lazily up the sides of their cage.

                       [Illustration: Silk Moth.]

  1. Eggs.
  2. Larva.
  3. Silk Cocoon.
  4. Chrysalis.

“They are full grown now, boys,” said Uncle George, “and will soon begin
to spin their silken cocoons.

“They are now about three inches long, and very different from the tiny
hairy grubs which came out of the eggs over a month ago.”

“We have been comparing drawings of them with drawings we made of the
caterpillar of the white cabbage butterfly,” said Frank, “and we find
that they are very much alike.”

“That is good,” said Uncle George. “They are, indeed, very much alike.
The body is made up of thirteen segments, and they have the same number
of legs. They differ from the cabbage caterpillar, however, in size and
colour. Notice the little horn which sticks up out of the twelfth
segment. Your cabbage caterpillar did not have that. If you look closely
you will notice a long silk thread issuing from the head of one of these
silk-spinning caterpillars. This one has just begun to make his cocoon;
and, in order to prevent his threads becoming entangled with those of
the other caterpillars, I will place this small paper cone over him.”

Next day Uncle George covered several of the caterpillars with paper
cones. On the roof of the cage the boys saw one caterpillar surrounded
with a flimsy web of silk of a golden-yellow colour. As they watched the
creature turning its head round and round inside the silky veil, their
uncle told them that the creature was spinning silk at the rate of about
a foot per minute.

In three days each caterpillar had surrounded itself with a dense silken
cocoon as large as a walnut. Then Uncle George took one of the cocoons,
and, cutting it open, showed the boys the brown, shining chrysalis
inside. He took another cocoon, and, having dipped it into warm water,
began to wind the silken thread on to a piece of card.

Both Frank and Tom were amazed at the length of this silken thread. They
were more surprised when they were told that each caterpillar produces a
silk thread more than half a mile long.

“Tell us, please, Uncle George,” said Frank, “why the creature spins all
this silk, and how it makes it?”

“You are asking a difficult question,” said his uncle, “but I will tell
you something about it.

                             [Illustration]

  S. Silk Fibres.
  W. Wool.
  C. Cotton.
    (All highly magnified.)

“The creature spins this cocoon to protect its chrysalis, of course. The
silk is produced in two long, coiled tubes, which occupy nearly the
whole length of the creature’s body.

“Silk, before it issues from the caterpillar’s body, is a fluid.
Whenever it comes out into the air, it becomes horny. Two strands are
produced at once—one from each of the long coiled tubes. Before they
leave the caterpillar’s body they are pressed together to form one flat,
ribbon-like thread. Silk is one of the strongest fibres in the world. It
is nearly as strong as steel, and much stronger than many of our metals.

“In a fortnight your silken cocoons will produce white, fluffy moths.
‘Then you can supply your friends with hundreds of ‘silkworm’ eggs, and
still have enough over to stock your larva cage.”

              [Illustration: Silk Moths—Male and Female.]


                        Exercises on Lesson XIV.

  1. Are “silkworms” really worms? What creatures do they most resemble?
  2. Many of our common caterpillars spin silk of a kind. Take in
          “woolly bear” caterpillars. Feed them on the plants you find
          them on. Compare the cocoons they make with those of the
          “silkworm.”
  3. Compare egg, larva, pupa, and perfect insect of the “silkworm” with
          that of the white cabbage butterfly. Does the caterpillar of
          the latter spin any silk?
  4. Make a list of all the spinning insects you know, and try to
          explain the use of the “silk” thread in each case.




                               APPENDIX.
                           HINTS TO TEACHERS.


STRUCTURE OF STEMS.—One- and two-year-old twigs of horse-chestnut, elm,
and willow should be cut into half-inch lengths and distributed among
the class. If cut straight across with a sharp pen-knife, the different
layers can be seen with the naked eye. Afterwards these pieces should be
slit longitudinally, and the various tissues _peeled off_ by the pupils.

BULBS AND CORMS.—Bulbs of snowdrop and tulip, and corms of crocus, can
be bought from seedsmen, from September to January, at from 6d. to 1s.
per 100. At any other season of the year the onion will make a good
substitute.

WILLOW TWIGS will root readily if placed in water and kept near the hot
pipes in school.

VEGETABLE FINGERS.—To illustrate this lesson, peas (of any kind) ought
to be grown in school. Branches of the many wild peas and vetches are to
be found in abundance in every hedgerow during spring, summer, and
autumn. Branches of Virginia creeper, clematis, tropæolum (Indian cress)
may be shown with advantage. The compound leaves of the rose, ash, or
mountain ash should be shown along with those of sweet-pea and edible
pea, and the amount of green (assimilating) area compared.

THE GREAT WATER BEETLE is found in nearly every pond. One or two should
be kept and fed upon small worms. These beetles can also be obtained
from any naturalist dealer. The larvæ of this beetle is found in ponds
in summer months.

“WATER BOATMAN” BEETLES (_notonecta_ and _corrixa_) are common to all
our ponds.

PLANT ARMOUR.—Branches of whin, bramble, hawthorn, and barberry, and
leaves of holly, thistle, and nettle will be found to illustrate this
lesson. Young whin plants are to be found plentifully in spring, growing
under the old bushes. One of these should be grown in a pot in school
and kept well watered. It will produce _no_ prickles.

TROUT EGGS are obtainable from any of the fisheries—_e.g._, Howietoun
Fisheries, Stirling, or Solway Fisheries, Dumfries, at about 1s. per
100, from October till April. They are easily hatched and reared
wherever running water can be obtained. If not hatched in a bottle, as
described in Lesson XIII., the ova ought to be placed in a shallow
trough of perforated zinc suspended in a small wooden box. The inside of
the box must be charred with a red-hot iron to prevent fungal growths.
When the yolk-sac is completely absorbed, the young trout should be fed
on yolk of hard-boiled egg, and, later on, on a mixture of this and
chopped raw beef. In each case the food should be squeezed through
perforated zinc.

“SILKWORMS.”—Eggs of the silk-bearing moth (_Bombex Mori_) can be had
from Messrs Watkins & Doncaster, 36 Strand, London, and other dealers,
at 4d. and 6d. per 100. The larva should be fed on mulberry or lettuce
leaves, and the leaves should never be given _wet_.

Caterpillars of Tiger Moth (_Arctia caja_), Emperor Moth (_Saturnia
carpini_), or Puss Moth (_Cerura vinula_) should be kept for comparison.

the cheerful cricket had been running around anxiously in the grass all the morning mrs cricky carried her head down and when she ran she scuttled and when she stopped she was absolutely still except for her eyes which she turned about brightly in every direction mrs cricky was looking for food for chee chirk and chirp usually mr cricky brought home the food but he was a member of the marsh grass vesper quartettemade up of himself miss k t did mr frisky frog and mr tree toad todson first cousin to toadie todsonand they had all been out very late the night before so mrs cricky didnt wish to disturb him at last mrs cricky found what she wanted and home she came chirp and chee and chirk were fed and then it was time to begin school mrs cricky always taught her own children she had rented three little toadstools not any bigger than tacks from toadie todson and these the children used for desks she often said that she thought roundtop desks better than flat for then the children were not so likely to lean their elbows on them school began promptly as the sun rose nine oclock would have seemed a lazy hour to the little cricketses the principal study mrs cricky taught was cheerfulness much the same as you are taught reading and writing she said that the whole duty of a cricket was to be cheerful after this she gave them some lessons in fear these lessons were something like the things your mother tells you such as dont go near the water fire burns dont put beans in your ears look before you leap only mrs cricky told chirp and chee and chirk never to go near one of old stingys spiderwebs and when they saw a giant coming with a fish pole in his hand to hop away as fast as they could then too she said there was a fourfooted animal called a cat that caught little crickets to eat them up after this they all chirruped together as she waved a blade of grass to keep time then she rang a bluebell and school was over she put three little cloverleaf sunbonnets on them and sent them out into the sun to play now chirp and chee and chirk were like other little boys and girls who do not learn their lessons very well and chee was careless about listening to his lessons in fear they went right out with their three little cloverleaf sunbonnets on and down to the edge of the lake chee climbed way up to the top end of a large blade of grass and was balancing there much as you like to on a springboard when accidentally he fell into the lake chirp and chirk ran to and fro frightened to death calling for help but nobody heard them in the meantime chee was kicking in the water and making a great fuss when a big oak leaf floated by and chee scrambled on if however the leaf had not come at just that moment chee would have drowned when the leaf floated in shore they all went home and told mother cricky she stopped chirruping for quite a long time and didnt say anything at all when mrs cricky began to chirrup again she said it served them just right and she hoped it had taught them all a lesson then they all chirruped together because chee was safe and mrs cricky said now let us all sing a little song to show that we are happy and this is the song they sang  jump jump  rather fast  jump jump everywhere  how we like the summer air  chirp chirp chirp in tune  on the grass beneath the moon the slothful toad his real name was toadie todson crawled out of his hole and looked about he saw a bee near by buzzing busily over a rich large clover blossom and a sturdy ant dragging a white parcel marked food toward a round sandy house and a cheery little cricket marching rapidly up a green stalk in search of a dinner for three hungry little cricketses it was a busy time for all except toadie todson the spring had just come that much toadie todson knew and all these neighbors were busy putting their houses in order well the bee was stocking his honeycomb house the ant was putting her summer pantry into order and filling it with cookies cream cheese cake and honey that her majesty the queen bee sent over every day and the cricket although his house was out of doors under a big green oak leaf that had dropped to the ground was busy piling up all the food he could find for mrs cricky to guard while she nursed the three little cricketses toadie todson was tired to see so much going on he wished they would all be quiet and stop hurrying around he drew a long sigh which made him swell up and look rounder and fatter than ever why couldnt his neighbors feed as he did he just sat there and opened his big red slit of a mouth gave a lazy snap and a noisy fly still buzzing was swallowed up he moved a little further away from his hole dragging one fat squashy leg after the other then down he squatted again a little ball of green inchworm dropped off the bush on to toadie todsons back and began to measure its length over toadies big warts and veins it made him feel very important to have an inchworm all to himself to tickle his back as important as an egyptian queen with a slave to tickle the sole of her foot all the hot afternoon long toadie todson swelled with pride as the green inchworm went measuring up and down up and down his back the busy bee just then flew buzzing by and buzzed to toadie as he went theres a sandslide rolling down this way im getting outs fast as i can when the bee said sandslide it sounded just like szszszzzzzide toadie todson opened his fat eyes and dropped his mouth in an ugly laugh it made him sick to see any one in such a hurry then the honest ant went scurrying past and very kindly gave him the same message but toadie only sneered the more he had been living in this very spot for years almost as many as you have lived and nothing had ever happened to him no he would stay right there it was too much trouble to move for anybody the green inchworm was very green and went on measuring toadie todsons back for it didnt understand a word the bee and ant had said suddenly gravel gravel gravel slip slip slipand toadie todson was under mountains of sand with a great big rock square on his back the green inchworm began to bore its way out of the sand it could hear toadie todson groaning and saying o o i wish id never been so lazy i might have lived an been as happy and rich as the bee or the ant o o and the green inchworm knew that toadie todson was dead not more than six hours after this mrs cricky overheard the green inchworm practising a tune it pleased her so much that she tried to sing it again to father cricky for the marsh grass vesper quartette of course it was all about toadie todson and this was it  a lament  very slowly  mournful mournful notes  in our little throats we sing  flowers flowers dead  for our toadies head we bring all the little green inchworms and the energetic thin roadworms called him glummie for short although his whole name was longinus rotundus caterpillar thats a very long hard name and they couldnt be bothered with a name like that for such a sulky fellow as he and for fear i shall take too long telling my story about him we also will call him not longinus rotundus caterpillar but glummie glummie was born into a most talented and attractive familythat means a family that could do many things very well and was pretty to look at but from the time he went out to eat his own leaves he was sullen nobody knew exactly what was the matter it is true his sisters were prettier than he for they had long yellow hair that waved all over a silky green body and they had dark yellowbrown eyes but a boy should not mind having his sisters prettier than he and he had an older brother they all called squirm he was very much liked he was browner and larger than glummie and he was always doing nice things for his brother and glummie shouldnt have been jealous but however all that might be this day glummie was sulking away in the grass and making himself generally disliked two katydids had said a pleasant goodmorning to him and almost jumped out of their green coats when he snapped out it aint mrs cricky in passing by chirped pleasantly and glummie glowered so out of his great fierce redbrown eyes at her that she hurried on in terror of her life there was only one thing snappier than he on the grass by the lake shore that morning and that was the snapping turtle presently a locust came along and turned on his buzzing hum right in glummies ear then glummie was furious raised his head and struck at the locust now the locust was a tease and this pleased him immensely so he cracked his wings right in the very face of glummie and began to sing  the firefly song  not too fast  dancing dancing  fireflies dancing  flash your wings  froggie sings  dance my little wings dance glummie fairly raged till the hairs all over his fat body stood up straight and his long stiff whiskersand he had whiskers on both his head and his tailfairly bristled he grumbled out that he didnt see why he couldnt live in peace in the grass that all he wanted was to be let alone then he said he knew how he could get away from the society of worms and crickets and katydids he hated and all the deafening noises they made to drive him crazy thereupon with a sulky twist of his head he crawled toward the road he had just crawled into the first wheelrut when a big jouncing yellow kentucky cart came by and made an end of longinus rotundus caterpillar mrs cricky said the moral of his end was very plain to her she told all the little cricketses that you couldnt expect to speak sullenly to people and have them like you and that you couldnt expect to live away from the society of other people without having something killed in you mrs cricky called it love and then perhaps a little inconsistently ask your mother what that means she added she for one was glad glummie was dead greenie toadie todsons green inchworm was measuring his way carefully around a birch tree since toadie todsons death he
 spent a large part of every day looking at trees and measuring distances so that stingy could spin his webs in the best manner possible all the rainbow qualities of web were spun on white birch trees greenie was humming over mournfully to himself the song which mr tree toad todson had composed in memory of his cousin toadie todsona lament greenie sang the words over and over again and seemed as his voice grew more and more mournful to be happier and still happier that is often the way with melancholy people greenie felt he had good reason to be unhappy not so long ago his first cousin longinus rotundus caterpillar or by his more familiar name glummie had been killed then his master toadie todson with whom he at least had a lazy time was killed in a sand slide and now he spent all his days at work for stingy who was a very exacting master if he so much as stopped to nibble a little from a tender green birch leaf stingy would fly at him and bid him go to work at once but one day greenie discovered something about him which he intended to use to good advantage stingy was in love every day at certain hours stingy went quietly off and one day greenie followed him there down in the meadow under a big apple tree he found stingy together with five other spiders they were arranged in a row before silken web more often called silkie whom they were courting and silkie was waiting ready to accept the spider who did best out danced the first spider the shining hairs all over his body glistened in the sun now he seemed silver now jet black now crimson as he whirled jumping lightly into the air silkie looked for a second and then turned her head away it was plain she would have none of him off dejectedly crawled the first spider greenie watched fascinated by this bright colored little spectacle under the blossoming apple tree then his eyes grew dark and angry he had to work when he was hungry he had not had a single holiday for over a month he had been spoken to crossly his family tree had been scoffed at hewell he had had enough of this the last fine cobweb stingy spun it was greenies business to fold and put away carefully in the centre of a buttercup he would get it and be back before it was time for stingy to dance he measured his way quickly over to the buttercup his little back fairly popped into the air every other half second as he went furiously humping himself along he found the cobweb covered with the gold dust of the buttercup and taking it up hastily he hurried back he knew just the spot where stingy would dance before silkie beside a tall piece of timothy grass the fifth spider was finishing his dance as greenie reached the bottom of the timothy grass stalk out came stingy with a fierce and selfconfident air which plainly said all the other five have failed now i am about to succeed he looked at silkie then began to dance first he whirled round madly and so swift and light was he that he seemed to have wings his broad back and thin tufted legs shone with dusky golden colors after whirling around he hopped several times lightly into the air in the meantime greenie climbed the stalk and was waiting stingy was just about to do a sidewayshop when over him fell inches and inches of his own gold dusted cobweb down he tumbled his legs all tangled up in the web fiercely he fought to get out while off scuttled the other spiders leaving him to his fate for a minute the little green hairs on greenies back stuck up straight with merriment then complacently he measured his way home to his own family tree mrs cricky as she passed him heard him muttering its a long worm that has no turning a very long worm that has no turning well said mrs cricky that may be true but it is none of a crickets business it is just as well not to take part in other peoples quarrels your father says the cricket rule is the best precept for living he has ever known and your father children is a very wise cricket i dare say greenie has had a hard time but then lazy worms often do now let us sing a little song about these flowers weve been hopping about in its pleasanter chirp dont sing too loud chirk not too fast and chee dont mumble your words  golden flowers  fast  everywhere you go  you see them dancing  flowers dancing  in the sunlight  nodding heads are shining  like the dewdrops  sparkling dewdrops  shining gayly old stingy sat in the midst of his spiderweb as some old giant used to sit in his fortress waiting to pounce upon innocent people to kill them and eat them stingys shoulders were all humped up and his eight claws looked very ugly he had already tangled up one noisy fly and now he sat waiting for another everybody hated him even toadie todson went out of his way to give a lazy snap at stingy all day long stingy spun webs caught noisy flies and even other spiders and yet nobody ever knew what he did with his webs or with the flies he caught stingy had never been heard to say one word and when he wanted exercise he hung by his leg to a thin cobweb and dangled up and down but if he saw anything coming he gave a jump and back he went again into his web there he would sit with his shoulders humped and his big mean black eyes fairly popping out of his head for once in his life stingy was feeling a little sleepy the evening that something happened to him all day long the wind had been blowing very hard and stingy had to rebuild a great many cobwebs that were blown down suddenly he started up something was struggling in his web what do you suppose it was nothing less than a beautiful little yellowwinged moth that was caught and was beating his wings and fluttering to get out stingy rose slowly and moved his humpy shoulders toward the moth quietly he stole on and in a minute more the moth would be choked to death on on went stingy the tiny yellow moth fluttering more and more feebly but just at the moment stingy was almost on the moth a beak ripped open the web and stingy went tumbling to the ground while the yellow moth fluttered away toward the waxy white flowers of the nearest syringa bush the moth had time to see hummy go whirring off and that night she told the fireflies and glowworms and other moths all about it and each one had some other good deed of hummys to relate but perhaps you would like to know what became of stingy when the web was broken and he tumbled to the ground he fell into the open mouth of the frisky frog who gave a comfortable croak as he swallowed him nobody was sorry that stingy was swallowed mrs cricky said it served him right but then poor mrs crickys good wishes were often lost in anxiety lest harm should come to one of her own little cricketses for stingy fifteen days before had been known to smother and eat a little cricket not more than a minute old mrs cricky herself would probably have been the last person to hurt stingy only she could not help feeling relieved she said it wasnt in cricketnature to feel otherwise father cricky was usually too busy singing songs for the marsh grass vesper quartette to make remarks but this time he agreed with mrs cricky and said they would all better have their evening song and go to sleep and this was the song they sang  lullabye  not too fast  come see where the night winds sleep  and the dews fall on the ground  while the trees arustling keep  and the stars turn round and round  there little frogs leap and croak  and little eels slip and slide  and the crabs lie still and soak  while the marsh is singing wide  the sand hills sleep neath the moon  and blink away at the sea  while they sing a little sand tune  which is plain as plain can be  lullabye  sleep away  say my little one  byebye to the day it was toward evening and the marsh grass vesper quartette was seated at the edge of shiner pond the quartette always gathered here about dusk upon a broad flat toadstool which grew at the foot of a spreading oak mr tree toad todson had leased this toadstool for the summer season from his first cousin the unfortunate toadie todson from pieces of straw he had built up to the edge of it a short flight of steps so that miss k t did their first soprano found it easy to mount to the platform tonight was a special evening and the attendance was large out on the pond the snapping turtles were moving swiftly from one log to another bearing upon their backs groups of fireflies the fireflies were there in numbers this night because one of the selections on the program was a firefly dance composed by mr frisky frog and to be danced by miss k t did the other members of the quartette were to sing the song while miss katy danced it spoiled the effect somewhat to lose her clear high soprano but mr tree toad todson filled in with his penetrating tenor and it was rumored that the composition would be a great success as nearly as i can remember it this was the program for that evening  sixth annual inseason out of door concert  of  the marsh grass vesper quartette  june the twentysixth  nineteenhundredandsix  shiner pond pavilion  members  miss k t did soprano  mr tree toad todson tenor  mr cricky baritone  mr frisky frog 3d

the concert the lullabye mrs frisky frog sang together with mr t toad todson and sang very beautifully she had sung it a great many times to her own little children while they were still pollywogs
 only when she sang it to them she altered the chorus mrs frisky frog changed the chorus for her little ones because she knew well enough that her pollywogs never slept at night at least i never saw any asleep at night of all those who swarm in black clumps there on the edge of shiners pond in the moonlight but i have not told you yet how mrs frisky frog sang the chorus  wiggle wog  woggle wig  sing my pollywog  a tune to every jig once while they were practising the lullabye at rehearsal mrs frisky frog forgot and through force of habit sang the chorus she had made up for her own little pollywoggles but dear me mr t toad todson flew into a towering rage and croaked at her till he was fairly hoarse nonsense nonsense nonsense he jerked out and when finally he could control himself he spluttered aloud that he had never in his life written such nonsense you remember it was he who composed the song poor mrs frisky frogs eyes rolled back a little further than usual and her throat jumped up and down with fear it did not do to speak crossly to mrs frisky she was so tenderhearted and was never known to speak a cross word to her own little ones or for that matter to any one mrs cricky one day while she was talking with mrs poe tatobug said that she knew of only one model mother in the community and that was the admirable mother of those ugly little pollywogs here mrs cricky heaved a proud sigh as she thought of her own little darlings chee and chirk and chirp decked out in their pretty little clover sunbonnets but to go back to mrs frisky frog mr frisky frog who was a member of the quartette became so angry with mr t toad todson for the angry croaking at his wife that his eyes fairly glowered at him mrs cricky always called that kind of anger in mr cricky righteous indignation peace was soon restored however as mr tree toad todson very much of a gentleman at heart was most anxious to ask pardon for this display of temper but we have spent too much time in discussing the lullabye and the trouble it brought mrs frisky the concert began a warm night was vigorously applauded and the firefly dance was the success of the evening miss k t did had bought at a most extravagant price from stingy one fourth of an inch of his best rainbowhue cobweb this made for her a beautiful scarf which she waved over the light of the glowworms that had been arranged in a wide circle on the broad flat toadstool around in and out now over now under her scarf three fireflies sped with burning wings and miss katy never danced better flashing her cobweb scarf in and out the glowworm circle as with lightsome foot and wing she danced round and round mrs cricky said she did wish the little ones had been allowed to come usually it did not seem right for children to stay up late at night but this night she did believe it would have added to their education to see such skill especially as chee was a little inclined to toe in and be clumsy you remember chee stumbled and fell into the lake all of the evening was successful and the applause at the close of the concert as they responded to an encore with the mosquito aria was wonderful there were no clapping hands but rather the beating of wings the enthusiastic croaking from various kinds of little red throats and the flashflash of lights from the fireflies and glowworms mr cricky in writing it up for the june bug journal pronounced it the success of the season we will close with a few stanzas of theres dreamland coming probably you have heard it for it has a way of singing itself the moment you are off to sleep try sleeping and see if it is not heard  theres dreamland coming  adaptation from eugene cowles forgotten  moderately slowly  theres dreamland coming dearie  and dreaming coming too  sweet dreamland for the weary  to cradle such as you  then close your eyes my darling  and say your little prayer  dreamland is waiting for you  and god will take you there  theres dreamland coming dearie  and dreaming coming too  sweet dreamland for the weary  to cradle such as you mrs cricky came out of her house with an angry flounce what in the world was all this noise about zzz zzz then a thump and a bump and the strangest little noises more like a falsetto squeak than anything else this had been going on for the last minute which is a whole hour for a cricket and going on while she was trying to teach chee and chirk and chirp their lessons in running and humming these two things unlike other people they always did at the same time mrs cricky came out with an angry little flounce as i said onto the piazza of grass cottage she had been fearfully disturbed but the instant she saw the noisy fly she broke into chirping merriment the noisy fly had evidently been to last evenings concert and was trying to imitate miss k t did in the firefly dance he was whisking around at a great rate his long legs looking very spindly under his fat black body but what amused mrs cricky most was the way in trying to do the wing step his legs got tangled up for all the world as if they were on sticky fly paper of course he fell over and that accounted for the bumping and the buzzing but each time he got up and went at it again as if nothing had happened singing in his high falsetto voice the tune miss gloworm had sung which was a little moonbeam songto find out what a moonbeam song is you must look long at the sky  moonbeam song  not too fast  moonbeams weave  about this place  fairies leave no fairy trace  weave him in  and weave him out  spin it thin  and round about  dingdong dingdong ding  see our spell  can hold him fast  tinkle bell  the hour is past it was not very polite for mrs cricky to laugh but really she could not help it never did she see such a buzzing clumsy attempt at imitation as this by this time the noisy fly had spied mrs cricky and his popping black eyes scanned her anxiously for he was accustomed to be driven off wherever he went mrs cricky remembered the interrupted lessons and spoke severely to him well noisy here again you are always disturbing somebody you are just like some other folks who never know when they are not wanted noisy people are always a nuisance you are about before respectable crickets have a chance to go to sleep buzz buzz buzz so that there is no sleeping after that your noisy wings are worse than toadie todsons heavy feet when he used to come hopping onto the piazza after the folks were asleep and what is more youre not much cleaner by this time mrs cricky had worked herself into a state of righteous indignation and concluded all she had to say with a sharp be off off went noisy in a great flurry and skurry he fairly dropped from the roof of the piazza where he had been hanging upside down in his haste to let go and get away when mrs cricky went back into the school room she found that chirp had upset his brown grasshopper writing ink all over the floor and was wiping it up with his little wing and smearing it onto chee now this ink was expensive and could be bought only from the grasshopper who manufactured it himself she looked at chirp just one second and told him to bring the timothy grass rod hanging in the corner chirp knew what that meant but he took his punishment bravely when mrs cricky had finished she dropped the rod on the floor with a sigh and gathered chirp into her wings o chirpie chirpie why will you be such a naughty little cricket and make me punish you then mother cricky gave them a little talk about noisy and told them there were two things they must always remember to be clean and quiet when it was proper to be quiet after this she gave them some red clover honey and sent them out to play dizzy batted up against the window striking his head and wings with a hard rattle mother moth like a good mother had told dizzy time and time again never to fly toward a light dizzy had already had some experience with odd lights hung up on poles among the oaktrees these lights had hoods over them hard and white dizzy often wondered why the white hoods were not as soft as the oakbuds notwithstanding the fact that his mother as often explained both to him and his little sister flutter that electric lights were not oakbuds poor dizzy there is no use in preaching up up through the oaktree he flew now tumbling against a branch now untangling himself from a sticky new bud up up dizzy sped toward a square white glare of light little flutters yellow wings trembled with fear as she saw her brother start upward she told him in a faint voice that window panes were very dangerous mother moth had cautioned them both about window panes dizzy stumbled onto the sill with a sickening thud scattering the diamond dust from his suncolored pearl wings into a fine glittering mist upon the green paint ugh with a jar up flew the window and dizzy thinking faintly about little flutter cuddled among the clover blossoms was swept into the room and its blinding light the soft warm fragrance of the night air reminded him of the cozy little place on the grass at the foot of the hillthe little birchleaf home mother moth flutter and father buzz were all down there now and listening perhaps to the cobweb symphony played by the marsh grass vesper quartette and this too was the evening when the june bug was to sing the june bug wing solo composed by himself dizzy had heard his father practising the accompaniment and the melody and words kept running through dizzys head somewhat like this  the june bug wing solo  moderately fast  crack crack my brittle wing  is all i ever sing  tho ive almost always said  when ive struck my little head  that im angry with a buzz buzz buzz  crack crack my brittle wing  be careful how you fling  where the dusty little toad  is still sitting on the road  waiting for you with a gulp gulp gulp how distinctly dizzy could still hear father buzz linger over the last line with so much feeling and with what terror he thought of all the dangers that might befall him round and round the room dizzy flew scattering silver hairs from his lacy wings each moment his head growing heavier for an instant there was a tiny flash of light and the faint noise of a shrivelling wing half of dizzys wing had been burned off what would flutter think now of the blackened silver wing of her brother down went dizzy his good wing beating helplessly upon the window sill flutter and mother moth were in his mind the cool air blew in through the shutter which a few minutes before had closed upon him but wonderful providence a big white hand opened the shutter and gently brushed out dizzy he had learned his lesson and mother moth did not speak one reproachful word as with dragging wing he hobbled into the little birchleaf home father buzz however was heard singing in an undertone these words to one of the melodies in the cobweb symphony  singed wings  teach many things antywhen she was godmother to any of the little ones her full name was given as anty hillwell to go on anty was in a great hurry she often preached against hurry but she found that there was really so much worth while doing in life and that life was so short she had to hurry once in a while to get it all done this particular morning there was more than ever to do first she had milked the cows you would call them little white bugs but they were really cows which she drove into a tiny pen there sitting on a milking stool sandy ant had whittled out of a bit of straw for her she milked as fast as she could make her hands go after that she went bustling into the house and taking the silkie tassel from a piece of timothy grass she swept the house out till it was as clean and fresh as a may morning she was very happy it was her nephew sandy ants birthday and he was coming of age for he was just twentyone hours old she still had his cake to bake and candles to make from the waxy bayberries that grew near the shore and last but not least his presents to arrange sandy had always been a very good boy and so today everybody had remembered him and wished him well but what excited anty hill more than anything else was that the king and queen for the ant state was a monarchy had sent a special messenger to say that they would honor them with their royal presence on this occasion anty hill had been a hard working honest ant all her life and she felt that this honor was a reward for all that she had done to bring sandy up as a good and honest citizen of the kingdom she bustled about busily and every time sandy came in the house she shooed him out and told him to go take care of the horses and cows by and by she called him in and bade him put on his best clothes she didnt tell him that the king and queen were coming for sandy was a bashful boy and she was afraid this would frighten him now the king and queen had heard reports far and wide of the honesty and goodness of anty hill and her nephew sandy if there were any ants sick in the kingdom anty hill and sandy did something to help them all this pleased the king and queen very much and they made up their minds to do something for anty and sandy the other guests had come and it was time for the king and queen at last their coach drew up in front of the door it was a beautiful shiny green beetle shell drawn by two gnats two little liveried green midges tumbled off the coachbox opened the coachdoor and the king and queen stepped out while the guests bowed low to the ground as they passed up the entrance to the house where anty and sandy were waiting anty hill bowed low to the king and kissed the queens hand while sandy bowed very low to both then the king called all the guests about him and made a little speech he said he always liked to reward kindness and honesty and that anty hill and her nephew sandy had been as kind and honest as any two people in his kingdom after this the king drew out his sword which was a fine blade of sharp grass and telling sandy to kneel down he said i dub thee knight of the red hill this was a great honor and ever afterward sandy served the king and anty hill who became lady hill lived with him at the court that night mrs cricky told all the little cricketses she hoped they would remember sandys honor and that if they helped other people they too might be honored some day chee and chirk and chirp looked much awed and waved their little pink clover sunbonnets helplessly in the air till father cricky said he did wish they would stop it kept him from seeing the music he was studying for the marsh grass vesper quartette what is it father called chee who was always curious its a cantata said mr cricky chee nudged chirk and whispered say whats that o i dont know said chirk lets ask him to sing it then well find out all right you do said chee father cricky was very glad to sing it and this was the song he sang  treetop cantata  moderately fast  swing tree top swing  this morning bright  swing gold and green  in gay sunlight  swing treetop swing  swing tree top swing  in night time too  theres shining stars  and falling dew  swing treetop swing the walking stick was soberly walking down the path looking spindly in every way long thin legs and a long thin body that were for all the world like a stick probably you have seen the walking stick many times and thought him just a twig if you hadnt been in such a hurry you might have seen something interesting each time he picked up a leg he seemed to wave it in the air before he put it down again that was i suppose because he had to each leg was so very long the walking stick had been given the name of the parson by some naughty little crickets for no other reason i am sure than that he was so exceedingly grave chee and chirk and chirp were the naughty crickets who gave him the name and although mrs cricky said it was unkind yet other people took it up now chee and chirk were waiting for the parson when they saw him come out of grass cottage where he had been visiting mrs cricky ssh said chee dont make so much noise hell hear us there chirk take that blade of grass and stretch it across the path hell never see it they say hes always thinking about things that folks dont think about at all say said chirk tugging at the blade of grass if i wind it around this buttercup stalk will that do yes replied chee here he comes oh i wish chirp was here along came the parson gravely swinging one leg after the other in the air and thinking with much pleasure of the kindliness of mrs cricky who was always a very cordial hostess ssh whispered chirk hes thinking of miss k t did they say but the sentence was never finished for with a sprawl the parson stumbled over the blade of grass and came down on the other side with a clatter teehee teehee teehee chirruped both chee and chirk so amused at the funny tangle of legs in which the walking stick was that they forgot to run away now the parsons long legs made great strides and before they knew what had happened chee was being soundly beaten whack whack whack went the walking stick on his little shiny black back o o o cried chee ill never do it again no said the parson in a high thin voice i think you wont you black imp by this time mrs cricky had come out to see what all the noise was about when she heard the explanation she said in a sorrowful tone chee and chirk is this the way ive brought you up when your father hears of this he will be very angry come into the house with me at once and into grass cottage they were marched when they were inside grass cottage mrs cricky said in a sad way that the worst thing anybody could do in his own house was to be inhospitable to strangers that they had been rude to mr walking stick upon their own grounds then mrs cricky went on to say that she feared they would never grow up to be gentle crickets if this was the way they intended to behave both chee and chirk were too unhappy for words and said they would never do it again and that really they did not want to hurt anybodys feelings well said mrs cricky i dont see how you could forget so soon after that song your father taught you we will sing it together again and perhaps you will remember next time and this was the song they sang  the cricket rule  rather slow  chirp for chirp is all our song  cheerful chirps  will help a long  do not say  what will not cheer  try to soothe  each tiny fear  chirp for chirp is all our song  cheerful chirps  will help a long well said mrs poe tatobug its a pity such things have to go on what those horrid black roadworms mean by eating up all the apple leaves is more than i can see lady bug listened to this outburst quietly as if she had been accustomed to such words from her kinswoman finally she said really i cant see that they do any more harm than crack crack crack spluttered mrs poe tatobug forgetting entirely the dignity of a hyphenated name hum why there wont be a single leaf on a single apple tree left to shade me and my family by time july comes hum indeed yes my dear said lady bug who was always reasonable as well as gentle i understand all you say but you know yourself that we eat leaves huh sniffed mrs poe tatobug i cant see that its the same thing at all what goods a leaf to a potato now just tell me that i only know this replied lady bug last year mrs cricket overheard farmer hayseed say that if he could get rid of the poe tatobug family hed live twenty years longer he said we ate up the leaves and made the roots good for nothing i presume he meant our family for a quiet body you can say the meanest things exclaimed mrs poe tatobug just then mrs cricket head down went hurrying by and said as she passed youd better go home farmer hayseed is pouring white stuff all over your houses most of your folks have left but i saw little poe and tato still there dear me o o they both cried those children will be choked to death
 no two mothers could have hurried home faster lady bug tried to give a little comfort on the way i think said she that rose bug will help the children for all she lives in such a beautiful new home rose is so fond of poe and tato and then too bush manor is not so far away not one word did mrs poe tatobug say but flying and jumping she hurried home her red speckled wings kept cracking louder and louder as she hurried along faster and faster i wish you would not hurry so fast said lady bug gently really i am quite out of breath and see there is farmer hayseed way up at the other end of the patch he hasnt reached our home yet mrs poe tatobug looked eagerly and sure enough there was farmer hayseed with a big box marked paris green in one hand and in the other a sieve through which he was sifting fine white powder dear me sighed mrs poe tatobug this is such a relief here we are at once she began scurrying around over every leaf of her home but not a sign of little poe and tato could she find gracious said lady bug how very unfortunate where do you suppose they are i dont suppose but i guess i know replied mrs poe tatobug as off she scurried toward the rose bush in the old fashioned garden near by and as they hurried toward the bush they could see rose bug with her wings around little poe and tato she was singing a lullabye trying to keep them quiet or put them to sleep and this was the lullabye she sang  lullabye lake  quietly  lullabye lake  is a place i know  where the tree tops sing  and the breezes blow  where the treetops sing  and the breezes blow  the moon shines dim  with a silver light  and the ripples dance  and the stars are bright  and the ripples dance  and the stars are bright  the glow worm burns  on the misted green  and scatters his lights  for the faery queen  and scatters his lights  for the faery queen mrs poe tatobug listened carefully to the song at last she exclaimed that rose bug always did sing strange songs i hope my children will not remember any such unpractical nonsense the poetato family never was given to notions what in the world can she mean by the faery queen i dare say some romantic tale the clover blossoms grew heavier every day with honey and their great red heads bobbed about clumsily in the little breezes that visited the grass by the lake shore squirm glummies caterpillar brother had been heard to say that it was so sweet about those clover blossoms that he could scarcely crawl by them it made him faint but every morning just as the sun got up hummy came whirring along singing so busily and sweetly that even toadie todson stuck his head out of his mudhole to listen and the frisky frog on the waters edge stopped croaking hummy came for a very simple reason and that was to get his breakfast his luncheon and dinner he always took from the honeysuckle vines and the rose bushes that grew on the side of the giants house he preferred his breakfast however from the clover for he said that the dew on them was fresher than on the blossoms up by the big house it made hummys beak feel cool and fresh for all the world like a morning bath in the clear fresh dew all the time hummy sang away and made everybody within hearing distance happy because of his tunefulness and he waved his wings about so prettily that it made you feel good to see them they were such little rainbows of color every morning when hummy came round just as the sun got up mrs cricky called all her children to the door and told them that it was as good as going to school for them to watch the manners of such a perfect gentleman as master hummy she said she wished them always to remember that to be so beautifully clean and so very cheerful as master hummy would make up for a multitude of other sins then as hummy flew past their door all the little cricketses and mrs cricky too gave a hop and a cheerful chirrup as a good morning to him and at every place that hummy went that day he made a sweet sound and everybody felt happier because he had been there hummy did a great many things besides making others happier with his tunefulness he pulled a young hopper out of a mud puddle into which he had hopped by accident he turned over a beetle that got stranded on its back and everything he did was so pleasant and full of song that it was a pleasure to have him do things for you anty hill said she did wish sandy could learn to sing that way it did make one feel so much happier when there was somebody around who was always merry and in such a good temper about helping people she said she didnt see how ma squiters family had lived they were so nagged with her ugly buzz and her bad temper late that same night anty hill overheard sandy trying to sing a song the frisky frog had taught him sandys voice was very poor and this is the song he sang in a most mournful way the frog song rather slowly come froggie sing your evening song  the summers short and winters long come sing away now that the day has faded quite into the night




Before Penelope could toddle she lived far away among the oleanders. The
sunbeams who came down to see the oleanders saw Penelope too. She sat on
the grass and played with them, and they loved her very much.

One day the sunbeams were sad.

"Penelope is going to England," they said to each other.

"I am going to England with her," said Sunbeam the First.

"How?" asked the others.

"I shall hide in her hair," said Sunbeam the First.

"Then," said Sunbeam the Second, "I shall go too. I shall hide behind
her eyelashes."

"And I," said Sunbeam the Third, "shall hide in her heart."

So Penelope went to England, with one sunbeam in her hair, and one in
her eyes, and one in her heart.

When she was old enough to talk she spoke to the sunbeams.

"Shall you always stay in my hair?" she asked Sunbeam the First.

"That is more than I can say," he answered. "Perhaps when you are old I
shall be obliged to go away."

Then Penelope asked Sunbeam the Second--

"Shall you always stay in my eyes?"

"I hope so," said Sunbeam the Second; "but perhaps if you are unhappy I
shall be obliged to go away."

Then the corners of Penelope's mouth began to droop a little.

"Dear Sunbeam," she said to Sunbeam the Third, "shall you be always in
my heart?"

"Yes, if you keep me there," said Sunbeam the Third.

"How can I keep you there?" asked Penelope.

"You must love the fairies," said the sunbeam, "and understand them when
they speak to you. If you love the fairies even when you are old, I
shall stay in your heart always."

       *       *       *       *       *

These stories have been written for Penelope, so that she may love the
fairies, and keep the sunbeam always in her heart.

  A LITTLE GIRL IN A BOOK
    The other people in the book looked at her in surprise          







Little Agatha lived in the days when castles were as common in the land
as cottages are now, and when there were plenty of magicians always
ready to help people out of difficulties.

One of the castles was Agatha's home. It stood on a hill and was
surrounded by a dark wood. Agatha was a lonely little girl: she had no
sisters or brothers to play with. She used to stand at the narrow window
in the castle tower and look out into the wood, and long to run about
with other little girls. If you had seen her you would have thought her
a very funny figure in her long gown reaching nearly to the ground, and
a close cap over her curls.

In the evening Agatha could see very little when she stood at the
window, but still she stood there and looked at the dark wood. It was
then that the nightingale, the Bird of Shadows, sang to her; and this
was what she liked better than anything else. She thought the
nightingale's voice was lovely to hear, and she wondered why it was so
sad.

Evening after evening the lonely little girl looked out through the
tower window listening to the nightingale, till she felt that he was her
friend. Sometimes she spoke to him.

"How much I should like to fly out of the window and be a nightingale
too!" she said. "Then we would play together in the wood, and I should
have a voice like yours--ever so sweet and ever so sad."

Sometimes she tried to sing, but she found her voice was not in the
least like the nightingale's.

Every day she became more anxious to be a nightingale, until at last she
thought about it always, and yet seemed no nearer to her wish. She hoped
sometimes that her curls might turn into feathers; but after several
weeks of wishing she saw that the curls were still made of yellow hair.
She began to be afraid she would never be anything but a little girl.

One day she heard some of the maids talking together. They were speaking
of the Wise Man, the Magician, who lived in the dark cave on the side of
the hill, and could do the most wonderful things. In fact, they said,
there was hardly anything he couldn't do; you had only to tell him what
you wanted most and he could manage it for you.

"Perhaps he could turn me into a nightingale," thought Agatha. "I'll go
and ask him, anyway."

So while the maids were still talking she slipped out of the castle, and
through the wood, and down the hill, till she came to the dark cave. Her
long frock caught on the brambles as she went, and her hands were a good
deal scratched, and once she tripped and fell. But of course she did not
mind anything of that kind, because she was thinking all the time about
the nightingale.

Agatha walked into the cave without knocking, and found the Magician at
home. I dare say you know that all good Magicians have kind faces and
long white beards. This one was a good Magician, so he had a kind face
and a long white beard. Agatha was not in the least afraid of him. She
told him at once why she had come.

"Please," she said, "I want to be a nightingale."

"A nightingale, my dear?" said the Wise Man. "That is a very strange
thing for you to want to be! Don't you know that the nightingale is the
Bird of Shadows, who sings by night and is very sad?"

"I shouldn't mind that a bit," said Agatha, "if I could only fly about
and sing with a beautiful voice."

"Well, then," said the Wise Man, "if you don't mind being sad, this is
what you must do. Every day you must come here to see me, and each time
you must bring me one of the pearls from your necklace."

Agatha clasped her hands tightly round her neck, as if to save her
pearls. She wore them in a chain, and the chain was so long that it
passed twice round her neck and then fell in a loop that reached nearly
to her waist.

"Oh, must it be my pearls?" she asked eagerly. "Would nothing else do
instead? I have some very nice things at home--really nice things. I
have some lovely toys, and a gold chain, and a pony, and--oh, lots of
things. Wouldn't you like some of those?"

"No," said the Wise Man, "I must have the pearls if you want to fly
about and sing with a beautiful voice. Nothing else will do. For every
pearl you bring me I will give you a feather from the nightingale, the
Bird of Shadows."

Agatha went home slowly, still clasping her pearls tightly in her hands.
She liked them better than anything she had. She liked to watch the soft
lights and shades on them, and to think of the wonderful sea they came
from. She did not feel sure that it was worth while to give them up,
even for the sake of being a bird and learning to sing.

But in the evening, when she stood by the tower window as usual, and
listened to the nightingale, she had no longer any doubts as to what she
should do. To be able to sing like the nightingale was more important
than anything else, she felt. And besides, if she were going to be
turned into a bird, the pearls would not be of much use to her in any
case. She was pretty sure that nightingales never wore pearl necklaces.

The next day she slipped one of the pearls off her chain, and then she
ran out of the castle and through the wood and down the hill, till she
came to the dark cave.

The Wise man smiled when he saw her.

"Here is----" she began, and then she could say no more, because of the
lump in her throat.

The Wise Man looked rather sorry for her, but he took the pearl without
speaking. Then he gave her the feather he had promised her, and she went
away again. As she climbed the hill and ran back through the wood to the
castle, she tried to feel glad that she had the feather instead of the
pearl.

For a long, long time the same thing happened every day. Every day
Agatha slipped a pearl off her chain, and then ran out of the castle and
through the wood and down the hill, till she came to the dark cave; and
every day she brought home a little feather instead of her pearl.

The long loop of the chain grew shorter and shorter. The time came when
it was not a long loop at all, but fitted closely round Agatha's neck
as the other loops did. By-and-by the time came when the chain would
only pass twice round her throat; then the time came when it would only
go round her throat once; then it grew too short to reach round her
throat at all, and she was obliged to turn it into a bracelet. Then it
became too short for her wrist, and she made it into a ring. And all the
time her store of feathers was growing larger and larger, till it seemed
to her that there were enough to make at least ten nightingales; but
this was because she did not know how many feathers a nightingale likes
to have. When there were only two pearls left, the Wise Man said to
her--

"When you bring me the last pearl you must bring me the feathers too;
and after that you will be able to sing with a beautiful voice and to
fly wherever you like."

So when Agatha left the gloomy old castle for the last time she was not
able to run through the wood, because she was carrying a big bag of
feathers as well as the pearl.

She was feeling very much excited when she gave the bag of feathers to
the Wise Man.

He put the last pearl carefully away with the others; and then he took
the bag of feathers and emptied it over Agatha's head. As he did so he
said some of the strange long words that Wise Men use.

And then----

Agatha was there no longer. There was nothing to be seen of her except a
little heap of yellow curls, which the Wise Man kept to give to the next
person who asked him for gold.

But out of the cave there flew a happy bird. It flew far, far up into
the sky, singing with a beautiful voice. It flew higher up into the sky
than any nightingale ever flew.

For the Wise Man had done more than he had promised. The bird's
beautiful voice was not the voice of the nightingale, the Bird of
Shadows; but the voice of the lark, the Sun-Bird, who is never sad.





The sea-fairy's name was Laughing Sapphire, and he lived in a
nautilus-shell: the land-fairy was called Sweet-of-the-Mountain, and his
home was a tuft of heather. One day Sweet-of-the-Mountain went for a
stroll on the sea-shore, and there he met Laughing Sapphire, just at the
edge of the ripples. It was then that the quarrel began.

"I am really sorry for you," said the sea-fairy. "It must be very
unpleasant to live up on that cliff. It is so dangerous too. You might
be blown down at any moment!"

"Ha-ha, how very amusing!" laughed the land-fairy. "Unpleasant, did you
say? Dangerous? Not at all, not at all. Now, _your_ life is something
too horrible to think of. I am glad it is not my fate to wander for ever
on the sea. And as for danger--well, every one knows that the sea is
full of dangers."

"I never heard such nonsense," said Laughing Sapphire indignantly. "The
sea is perfectly safe if you know how to manage your shell."

"But think of the discomfort of it," said Sweet-of-the-Mountain. "You
never have any peace."

"And _you_ never have any change," answered Laughing Sapphire.

"There's not much change in always looking at the sea--a great dull
stretch of water!"

"Dull!" cried Laughing Sapphire angrily. "Dull, did you say? Not half so
dull as being mewed up on a rock!"

"Why," said Sweet-of-the-Mountain, "you've no flowers, and no bees, and
no----"

"And you," interrupted Laughing Sapphire, "have no glittering spray, and
no forests of seaweed, and no creamy foam."

"You've no heather," said the land-fairy, as if that settled the matter.

"As for you," cried the sea-fairy, "I can't think of anything you _have_
got! So there!"

They went on quarrelling in this way for some time, getting more and
more angry. At last they agreed upon a very good way of settling the
dispute. And this was their plan. Each of them was to go away for a
certain length of time. On a particular day they were to meet again on
the shore, at the edge of the ripples. Laughing Sapphire was to bring
with him three treasures of the sea; and Sweet-of-the-Mountain was to
bring three treasures of the land. The fairy whose treasures were the
best would be the winner in the quarrel.

"But who will decide which are the best treasures?" asked the
land-fairy.

"My friend the sea-anemone lives near here," said Laughing Sapphire. "As
he is partly on land and partly in the sea, he will be able to judge
fairly between us. He shall decide."



Then the sea-fairy sailed away in his nautilus-shell, and the land-fairy
flew home to the heather on the cliff.

Hardly had Laughing Sapphire left the shore when he saw a huge curling
wave rolling towards him. The hollow of the wave was like a great green
cavern, lit up with magic light; the top of it was sparkling spray. A
sunbeam was shining straight down through the spray, and gleaming with
every colour you can think of, so that it seemed as if a piece of
rainbow had fallen from the sky.

The fairy laughed happily, and steered right into the hollow of the
wave, for he knew that his nautilus-boat was safe. In his hand was a
little shell. As his boat rode smoothly over the crest of the wave and
through the rainbow, he held out the little shell in the beam of
coloured light. There was a wonderful change in the shell after it had
passed through the rainbow; it was lined with mother-o'-pearl!

The fairy laughed again for joy when he saw the rainbow colours of the
little shell.

"They've nothing like that on shore!" he said.

Then the nautilus-boat sailed on and on across the sea.

The next thing that Laughing Sapphire found was a glowing piece of red
seaweed. As he pulled it, dripping, out of the sea, it looked like a bit
of broad crimson ribbon; except that no ribbon ever had so much colour
and so much light in it. It was so transparent that you could see the
sunlight through it, and yet it was as strong as a rope.

As the fairy coiled it round and round he smiled.

"That should please them, I think," he muttered.

The third thing that Laughing Sapphire found was the best of all. To
find it he was obliged to leave his nautilus-boat and dive down to the
bottom of the sea. I must not tell you now of all the wonders he saw
there, for it would take me too long, and it would be very difficult for
me to stop. But when he came to the surface again he was clasping a
splendid pearl tightly in his hand.

"If this doesn't persuade them," he said, chuckling, "that the sea is
the best place in the world, _nothing_ will!"

Meanwhile the land-fairy had been busy too.

First he flew to a beautiful garden, full of roses and verbena and
everything sweet. It was a garden he often visited, for many of the
flower-fairies there were friends of his. So he knew exactly where to
find the sweetest lilies. There were great clumps of them--tall, white
lilies with drooping heads and hearts of gold. Sweet-of-the-Mountain
crept into one of them, and came out with a big, heavy drop of honey.
The scent of it was so strong that all the fairies in the garden sniffed
joyfully. Then Sweet-of-the-Mountain flew over the wall, and away and
away till he came to a wood.

In the wood there was perfect silence. If you had walked there your
footsteps would have made no sound, for the ground was soft and springy
with moss. There was moss everywhere: moss on the tree-stems and on the
stones, and carpets and cushions of moss on the ground. The fairy picked
a piece of it--a piece like a soft green feather--and flew off with it
out of the wood.

Then he went back to his own hills, where the heather grew right up to
the edge of the cliff; for he knew that the best thing of all was to be
found there. He saw the hills far away, purple and blue, with here and
there a streak of crimson where the sun was shining on the heather. As
he came nearer and nearer he grew happier and happier, for a fairy is
always happiest in his own country. He picked a sprig from his own tuft
of heather; and then he flew down to the shore to meet the sea-fairy at
the edge of the ripples.

He found the nautilus-boat lying on the sand, and Laughing Sapphire
sitting on a rock talking to the sea-anemone. The fairies nodded to each
other.

"This," said Laughing Sapphire to the sea-anemone, "is the fairy I was
speaking of. He declares that it is better to live on land than on the
sea. Of course I know better than that! So we have each brought three
treasures to show you, that you may decide which of us is right."

The sea-anemone answered in a very sleepy, drawling voice: for when you
spend all your life fastened to the same rock your mind moves rather
slowly.

"Very well," he said, "go on."

Then Laughing Sapphire showed them his mother-o'-pearl shell.

"This shell," he said, "is lined with a bit of rainbow."

The sea-anemone waved all his arms about wildly to show that he was
pleased.

"And this," said Laughing Sapphire, unrolling the crimson seaweed, "is a
bit of the ribbon that mermaids use for tying their hair."

"Beautiful!" murmured the land-fairy.

"And this," went on the sea-fairy, showing them the pearl, "is one of
the lanterns that the moonlight-fairies use when they dance on the sea."

"Beautiful--beautiful!" said the sea-anemone and the land-fairy
together.

Then Laughing Sapphire turned to the land-fairy with an air of triumph.

"Let us see your treasures now," he said a little contemptuously.

Sweet-of-the-Mountain held out a flower-cup with the drop of honey in
it.

It was so sweet that the sea-fairy could not help exclaiming: "Oh, how
delicious!"

"That," said the land-fairy, "is the sweetness of the garden."

Then he showed them the little green feather of moss.

"That," he said, "is the quietness of the woods."

Then he threw down the sprig of heather.

"That," he said, smiling, "is the glory of the hills."

The two fairies looked at each other silently. Each felt certain that
his own treasures were the best.

The sea-anemone's arms were all waving furiously. He was very much
excited, because he knew that the time had come for him to decide which
of the two fairies had brought the most beautiful things; and as I told
you before, he was not very quick in making up his mind.

"Well?" said Laughing Sapphire impatiently. "What do you think? Is it
best to live on the sea or on the land?"

"I think," said the sea-anemone very slowly, "that the sea is the best
place for a sea-fairy."

"Yes, yes," said the sea-fairy, "of course it is!"

"But then, you know," the sea-anemone went on, "I can't help thinking
that the land is the best place for a land-fairy."

Then he drew in all his arms and became a little knob of red jelly.

"It is possible," said Sweet-of-the-Mountain thoughtfully, "that there
is some sense in what he says. And yet"--he sniffed happily at his cup
of honey--"and yet I don't believe you have anything at sea as sweet as
this."

"It is certainly a very nice scent," agreed Laughing Sapphire, "but I do
think it would be improved by a little salt."







A fairy whose name was Hedgeflower once lived in a wild rose at the
corner of a field. One day he went out to search for adventures, for
most fairies have a great wish for adventures.

He wandered on for a long time, sometimes walking and sometimes flying,
and sometimes stopping to talk to friends, for the wild-rose-fairies
have a great many friends. He crossed several fields in this way, and
then he came to a high hedge. He was just thinking of going home when he
heard a great buzzing of voices on the other side of the hedge, and as
the voices were fairy-voices he was interested at once. Perhaps, he
thought, he would find the adventure he was looking for on the other
side of the hedge. So he spread his pink-and-white wings and flew over.

It was not surprising that he had heard a great many fairy-voices, for
he found himself in a beautiful garden, and all beautiful gardens are,
as you know, full of fairies. In this garden there were not only the
sorts of fairies that one meets every day, such as rose-fairies and
lily-fairies and the quiet little ones that live in mignonette, but
there were also all kinds of smartly dressed fairies belonging to
strange and splendid flowers. They all seemed to be getting on very well
together, for they were all talking loudly about something that
interested them very much.

As Hedgeflower dropped down into the middle of the group he felt a
little shy. But fairies are as a rule kind and friendly, so a good many
voices called out Good-morning to him as he sat down under the shade of
a large purple pansy. Then a butterfly whom he had met once or twice
before came rustling up to him and began to talk.

"I like this place," said the butterfly. "One meets so many different
kinds of fairies. But don't sit there. Come and let me introduce you to
some of my friends." Then as they moved away he lowered his voice and
went on--

"Those little pansy-fairies are good little things, but they are a bit
too thoughtful for me. I find them just a trifle dull, you know. But
here is a cousin of yours; I must introduce you."

Hedgeflower looked round and saw that a beautiful rose-fairy was
standing near. She wore flowing robes of two shades of pink, and her
appearance was full of dignity.

"Madame La France," said the butterfly, "may I introduce to you a cousin
of your own?"

"A very distant cousin, I am afraid, Madame," said Hedgeflower, bowing
low.

Madame La France smiled kindly and asked Hedgeflower if he had often
been in the garden before. He told her that this was his first visit.

"Then," she cried, "you must come to the party--you must certainly come
to Princess Orchid's party. She lives over there in the glass house, and
she has asked all the fairies in the garden to a party this afternoon.
We have been talking about it all day. You must come with me; the
Princess will be glad to see any cousin of mine."

Hedgeflower was delighted. He thought it would be great fun to tell the
fairies at home all about it: Meadowsweet, and that cheeky little
Eyebright, and Buttercup who stared at everything one said, and all the
honeysuckle-fairies, who were such friends with the wild-rose-fairies
because their families had lived close together for so long. Hedgeflower
thought that to go to a Princess's party with his beautiful cousin was a
nicer adventure than anything he had expected when he set out for his
walk.

Meanwhile all the fairies in the garden were making their way towards
the glass house.

"You must keep close to me," said Madame La France kindly. "The flower
in which the Princess lives is some way from the door, and you might be
lost in the crowd."

In another moment Hedgeflower found himself in a scene of the greatest
splendour. The glass house was full of flowers, and every flower had of
course its own special fairy, and nearly all of them were magnificently
dressed and were quite different to any fairies that Hedgeflower knew.
The greatest crowd was of course round the beautiful flower in which the
Princess Orchid lived, and Hedgeflower and his cousin found it quite
difficult to get near the Princess without crushing their wings. They
were obliged to walk so slowly that Hedgeflower had plenty of time to
look about him. He saw numbers of his cousins the rose-fairies, and tall
lily-fairies, and fern-fairies dressed all in green. The pansy-fairies
were there too, with their sad little faces and their splendid
purple-and-gold dresses. Quite close to him there was a fuchsia-fairy,
dressed in a stiff white petticoat with a pointed overskirt of scarlet;
and standing beside her were several fairies whose crimson tunics were
so fine that Hedgeflower asked who they were.

"They are the young Prince Begonias," said Madame La France. "The
Princess, being a foreigner herself, has a great many foreign friends.
The Begonias think a good deal of themselves, but I think myself that
our own family has more reason to be proud. But come, we can speak to
the Princess now."

Princess Orchid was standing on a drooping petal of the beautiful flower
in which she lived. Her long robes of mauve and white swept over the
flower as if they were themselves petals. Her hair was golden, and her
face was the loveliest that Hedgeflower had ever seen. She smiled at him
very graciously when he was introduced to her, and after he had seen
that smile he took no interest in anything else that was going on. He
never glanced again at any of the fairies who had seemed to him so
splendid a short time before: he just sat down in a nice shady clump of
ferns and watched Princess Orchid. He had been to a great many parties
in his own hedge where the wild-roses grew, but he had never seen a
fairy or even a butterfly receive her guests with so much sweetness and
graciousness. He sat there for a long time and wished it could be for
ever. Then he remembered that perhaps he would never see Princess Orchid
again, and that made him sad.

A fairy party is never dull. Fairies are full of fun and enjoy
everything very much. There was a great deal of talking and laughing and
sipping of dew flavoured with sunshine, which is the drink fairies like
instead of tea. The fairies of the Canterbury Bells had brought their
music too, and gave a great deal of pleasure. It seemed as if the party
were going to be a great success, when unfortunately a disaster
happened which was talked about for many a day afterwards.



On the roof of the glass house, just above the Princess's head, there
was a large spider who was very busy spinning his web. He was so busy
that he did not look where he was going, and when people forget to look
where they are going it is a very common thing for accidents to happen.
The spider came lower and lower, spinning all the time, while Princess
Orchid was talking very kindly to a shy little violet-fairy and was not
noticing anything else. Lower and lower, nearer and nearer, came the
spider.

Suddenly a shrill little voice was heard to cry out--

"Take care, Princess, take care!" and Hedgeflower, flying from his clump
of ferns, flung himself against the great spider. He was too late.
_Flop!_ The spider fell with all his weight upon the flower in which the
Princess lived!

No flower could bear the weight of such a monster, and to the horror of
all the fairies the beautiful mauve orchid trembled and drooped, and
then slowly fell to pieces, petal by petal. The Princess spread her
dainty wings and flew safely to the ground. Then she turned and looked
sadly at the ruin of her home. It lay bruised and crushed and shapeless
on the earth, and if once a fairy's flower-home falls to pieces it can
never be put together again.

There was a great commotion in the glass house. All the fairies flew
about in a fuss, chattering angrily and trying to find the spider who
had done the mischief. But he had quickly climbed up the rope that he
had been spinning, and was hiding behind a leaf, so he was never found.

Now, it is a very uncommon thing to find a fairy who is not kind and
anxious to help other people, so all the Princess's guests crowded round
her and begged her to come and stay with them. The fuchsia-fairies
declared they knew of the loveliest little fuchsia-bud which was in want
of some one to take care of it: it would really be a charity if the
Princess would live there. Prince Begonia objected to this, because, he
said, a fuchsia-bud was not a fit place for the Princess to live in; the
right home for her was in one of his magnificent palaces. The
lily-fairies cried out that this was all nonsense, because any one could
see that the Princess would feel more at home in a white flower than in
a red one, after living so long in the pale orchid.

While all this talking was going on the Princess did not seem to be
paying very much attention to it, though of course she bowed and smiled
and thanked the fairies very prettily, as was only right. She looked
round several times, as if she wanted some one who was not there. At
last she said--

"Where is the little fairy with the kind face, who tried to save my
home?"

Several fairies pushed Hedgeflower forward. He felt and looked very shy.

The Princess smiled at him, and then she held out her hand.

"I will go with you," she said, "and be a wild-rose-fairy."

Hedgeflower dropped on one knee before her.

"My home is in a common hedge," he said, "and there are thorns round it.
But there is no glass between me and the open sky. I think, Princess,
that a fairy should be always under the open sky and the sunshine."

"That," said the Princess, "is exactly what I think myself."

So Hedgeflower and the Princess spread their wings and took each other's
hands and flew away out of the window of the glass house, and across the
garden and over the hedge. They flew on and on, across field after
field, till they came to the hedge with the wild roses.

There the Princess Orchid made her home, among the honeysuckles and the
meadowsweet. She was no longer a princess with sweeping robes, but a
quiet little wild-rose-fairy in a pink-and-white frock. But there was no
glass between her and the sunshine.







There was once a cloud that had no lining. You have often, I dare say,
heard grown-up people say that every cloud has a silver lining, and so
you will understand that a cloud without a lining is a very uncommon
thing.

The fairies who lived in the cloud found it very uncomfortable, because,
you see, it let the rain come through.

"If only our cloud had a lining," they said, "the rain would not come
through, and that would be very nice for us."

"We must really have it lined," said one.

"What with?" asked another.

"Why, with silver, of course," said a third. "Every one knows that a
cloud ought to be lined with silver."

"But we have no silver!"

"Then we must get some. It is ridiculous to go on living in this state
of dampness. Other fairies have comfortable clouds over their heads, and
why should we be always drenched? And all for want of a simple silver
lining!"

"Where does one find silver?" asked one of the fairies.

"There are a good many kinds of silver," said a fairy who had been about
the world a great deal. "There is the kind that is dug out of the
earth,--but that is a common kind of stuff, and no use for lining clouds
with. Then there is the silver stream that you can see far below,
winding through the fields and shining white in the sun. That is a much
better kind of silver than the other. Then, of course, moonshine makes
beautiful silver: you can see it glittering on the sea whenever the moon
shines. But I really don't know what would be the best kind of silver to
line clouds with."

"We must try them all, and see which is the best," said another fairy.

They went on talking about it for some time, because such an important
matter could not be settled in a hurry. At last it was arranged that
three of them should fly away and look for some silver to line their
cloud with. The names of the three fairies were Pearlywing, and
Skybright, and Mist-of-the-Morning.

Now, all the time that the fairies were talking, Pearlywing was looking
down at the silver stream far below, winding through the meadows. It was
so white and shining that he felt sure the silver of it would make a
beautiful lining for the cloud. So when he was told to fly away and look
for some silver, he lost no time in wondering where to go. He spread his
wings--the soft grey wings that cloud-fairies have--and he flew down and
down, away from the cloud to the meadows where the silver stream was
shining. The nearer he came to it the more it sparkled. He felt sure it
must be made of the very best silver.

But how could he carry it? A fairy's cap is not very large, and he had
nothing else.

"I must just carry up a capful at a time, and empty it, and come back
for another. I must go on till there is enough silver to line the cloud
with," he said to himself.

So he filled his tiny cap with the silver of the stream, and flew up
again to his cloud, carrying the cap very carefully for fear of spilling
the silver. Then he went round to the back of the cloud where the lining
ought to have been, and poured the silver out of his cap.

Now, as I dare say you have guessed, the silver of the stream was really
nothing but water. So when it was poured out of the cap it fell right
through the cloud, and made the fairies on the other side much wetter
than they had ever been before! I need not say that they were very much
annoyed. They made so much commotion, spluttering and grumbling and
scolding, that Pearlywing heard them through the cloud, and went round
to see what was the matter.

"What we want," said one of them angrily, shaking the water off his
wings, "is something to keep us dry, not something to make us wet!"

"I am so sorry!" said Pearlywing; "but I thought it was such good
silver! And now, I suppose, you don't want any more of it."

"Certainly not!" said all the fairies very quickly.

"It is most unfortunate," said Pearlywing. "I can't understand it at
all. The silver looked so _very_ nice."

He was not a very clever fairy, I am afraid.

"I hope Skybright will have more sense," grumbled the wet fairies.

Skybright meanwhile was waiting on the sea-shore, far below the clouds.
He was waiting for the moon to rise above the sea. He had to wait a
long time, but he did not mind that, because there are always such nice
fairies to talk to on the sea-shore.

At last the big round moon sailed slowly up into the sky. At the same
moment a hundred thousand moonshine-fairies rushed out across the sea
towards Skybright, flying and dancing on the water, and turning it into
a sheet of silver as they came. For the moonshine-fairies carry silver
with them wherever they fly, and scatter it as they go.

This was the moment that Skybright had been waiting for.

"Please, pretty moonshine-fairies," he cried, running to the water's
edge and holding out his arms, "give me some of your silver to line my
cloud with, and keep the rain from coming through!"

Then the moonshine-fairies danced towards him across the sea, with their
tiny hands full of silver.

"Take our silver, little cloud-fairy," they said, "and line your cloud
with it, and dip your wings in it, and scatter it over the earth as you
fly, for everything is made more beautiful by our silver."

Then they poured the silver out of their hands into his, and because the
silver of the moonshine-fairies is very light he was able to carry a
great deal of it. He filled the pockets of his pretty grey coat with it,
and he filled his cap, and took a quantity of it in his hands. And he
said Good-bye to the moonshine-fairies, and flew away up to the clouds.



When the other cloud-fairies saw the beautiful silver he had brought
with him they were delighted. They all set to work to line the cloud
with it, spreading it out carefully and making it nice and tidy at the
edges. When the lining was finished it looked lovely, and the fairies
were much pleased with it. They sat down under the cloud, feeling quite
safe from the rain.

But unfortunately their satisfaction did not last long. Presently it
began to rain. The fairies smiled and nodded at each other, and agreed
that it was very pleasant to be safe from a wetting. Then a big heavy
drop fell right through the cloud and lining and all--and another--and
another, and soon the fairies were as wet and uncomfortable and cross as
if the cloud had never been lined. It was really very annoying.

The truth is that the silver of the moonshine-fairies is rather
thin--altogether too thin to keep the rain out, and of very little use
for lining clouds with.

"It is really too bad!" cried the poor cloud-fairies, wringing the water
out of their nice little grey coats. "What are we to do? Any one would
have thought that such beautiful silver would keep the rain out!"

"Perhaps," said one of them who liked to be cheerful,
"Mist-of-the-Morning may bring us a better kind of silver even than
this."

So they decided to grumble no more till Mist-of-the-Morning came home.

Now, when Mist-of-the-Morning started out to look for silver he did not
fly down to the earth at all.

"Every cloud but ours has a silver lining," he said to himself; "so the
best way to find the right kind of silver will be to ask the fairies who
live in the other clouds."

He saw the clouds all about him, each with a bright rim round it, which
was the edge of its lining. He went to the nearest one and spoke to the
fairies that lived in it.

"Brother fairies," he said, "where can I find silver to make my cloud a
lining as beautiful as yours?"

And the fairies answered--

"Go to the sunbeam-fairies. Their silver is the best for lining clouds
with."

Then Mist-of-the-Morning went to one cloud after another, and asked all
the fairies that lived in them the same question. And they all
answered--

"Go to the sunbeam-fairies. Their silver is the very best."

So Mist-of-the-Morning flew away to the nearest sunbeam. It was crowded
with fairies, who were all hard at work, for the sunbeam-fairies have
more work to do than any others. As they worked they were laughing and
singing, for the sunbeam-fairies are always happy.

"Please, kind sunbeam-fairies," said Mist-of-the-Morning, "I want some
silver to line my cloud with. It must be the very best silver, and every
one says that none but yours is good enough."

Then all the sunbeam-fairies shouted out--

"Quite right, little cloud-fairy, quite right! It is waste of time to
line a cloud with any silver but ours. Our silver is the very best!"

While they were speaking they all rushed to the end of the sunbeam, and
before Mist-of-the-Morning knew what they were going to do, they had cut
off a great piece of it. There it lay in a shining heap!
Mist-of-the-Morning had to shade his eyes, because its silvery
brightness dazzled him.

"Sunbeam silver!" sang the fairies. "Sunbeam silver is the best of all!"

Then Mist-of-the-Morning spread his wings and flew home, trailing the
sunbeam after him. And all the fairies in his own cloud welcomed him
with shouts and singing, because they saw at once that sunbeam silver
was the best of all.

They made their cloud a beautiful thick lining of it, with the silver
shining all round the edge. And the rain never came through any more.

Now that I have told you this story I hope you will not forget that it
is waste of time to line a cloud with any kind of silver except the kind
that sunbeams are made of.







This story is about something that happened long, long, and ever so long
ago, before the fairies had really settled down to their work.

There was then a little fairy called Starblossom, whose business it was
to take care of the earliest Spring flowers; and there was also a fairy
called Drop-of-Crystal, whose work it was to make snowflakes. These two
fairies were great friends.

One day Starblossom had not very much to do. She had finished sharpening
the little green spikes of her flower-leaves, and had even made ready
one or two white buds. But when she saw that Drop-of-Crystal was very
busy making heavy drops of snow, she thought to herself that there was
no need for her to be in a hurry about the Spring flowers. They would be
much more comfortable underground if Drop-of-Crystal were going to fling
snowflakes all over them. So she carefully covered up her buds and went
off to watch the snow-fairy at work.

Drop-of-Crystal was too busy to speak. He was making an enormous
quantity of snowflakes. Starblossom was silent for some time, but at
last she asked--

"What are they all for?"

"For a snow-storm, of course," said Drop-of-Crystal shortly.

"Are they all to be used in one storm?" asked Starblossom. "It will be a
very big storm, I'm afraid."

"It will," said Drop-of-Crystal--"very big. You'd better take care of
those flowers of yours, or they'll be hurt."

"There are not many of them above ground," Starblossom answered. "I saw
what you were doing. But in any case my flowers are not likely to be
hurt by the snow-fairies so much as by the frost-fairies."

Drop-of-Crystal said nothing to this, but went on working busily.

Presently Starblossom spoke again.

"It seems to me that snowflakes are very easy to make. Your work is
really much easier than mine. It is very difficult to make flowers
nicely. One has to be so particular about the shape of them."

"I don't agree with you at all," said Drop-of-Crystal rather crossly.
"My work is much harder than yours. I have to make thousands and
thousands of snowflakes for the very smallest snow-storm. You can take
quite a long time arranging the shape of your flowers, but I have to
work in a hurry, or the storm would run short of snowflakes. And that
would be very serious."

"Not half so serious as it would be if the Spring were to run short of
flowers," said Starblossom indignantly.

"Look here," said Drop-of-Crystal, losing his temper, "if you like my
work so much I wish you'd do it! You can set to work and make a few
thousand snowflakes while I take a rest."

"I shall be delighted to do such easy work," said Starblossom; "but of
course if I make your snowflakes you must make my flowers. That is only
fair."



"Very well," said Drop-of-Crystal, "I don't mind. After all, work of
that kind is just the same as resting."

So he flew off to the place where Starblossom's flowers were beginning
to show their spiky leaves above ground. He had never made a flower
before, and did not know how to set about it, but he was much too proud
to ask Starblossom how it ought to be done. So he did the best he could
by himself.

It was a long time before he had finished a flower-bud. When the first
one was done he thought it looked rather odd.

"There is something peculiar about that flower-bud," he said to himself.
"It is really more like a big drop of snow than a flower! I suppose that
comes of making snowflakes for so long. I must try again."

So he tried again, and again, and again. But every time the flower-bud
was exactly like a big drop of snow.

"I can't help it," he said at last. "They _will_ keep on being like
drops of snow. But, after all, there is no reason why a flower should
not be like a drop of snow. They are dear little flowers, anyway, and I
shall go on making them like this."

So he went on for a long time making flowers that were like drops of
snow, and dear little flowers they were.

In the meantime Starblossom was hard at work making snowflakes. She knew
no more about making snowflakes than Drop-of-Crystal knew about making
flowers, but, like Drop-of-Crystal, she determined to do the best she
could without asking for help. She took a long time to make the first
snowflake, because she was accustomed to finish her flowers very
carefully, and she liked everything she made to be pretty. She laughed
to herself as she put down the first finished snowflake.

"That is what comes of making nothing but flowers," she said. "That
snowflake is exactly like a flower!"

She was quite right. The snowflake was like a delicate, starry flower,
light as air, and clear as crystal, and glistening in the sunshine.

"I like that kind of snowflake," said Starblossom. "I shall make some
more."

So she made a great number of snowflakes, and they were all like
feathery flowers, all different in shape, but all beautiful.

"I should like to go on making snow-flowers always," she said to
herself.

At that moment Drop-of-Crystal flew up to her in a great hurry.

"Oh, do come and see my nice new flowers," he cried. "They are quite a
new kind, and they are so pretty--just like drops of snow!"

"And my drops of snow are just like flowers!" cried Starblossom. "And I
want to go on making them always, because they are so beautiful."

"Well then," said Drop-of-Crystal, clapping his hands, "suppose you and
I change places! You shall go on making snowflakes, and I'll go on
making flowers!"

So that was the way they settled it.

And because Drop-of-Crystal was a snow-fairy, the flowers he made were
always like drops of snow; and because Starblossom was a flower-fairy,
the snowflakes she made were always like flowers.

That is the reason why, to this day, the first flowers of Spring are
like drops of snow, and the snowflakes are like beautiful, starry
flowers. You must often have noticed it yourself.







The opal was the last of the precious stones to be made. And this was
how it happened.

Long, long ago--so long ago that no one had ever seen a ruby or a
sapphire or an emerald--there was a Princess who had a great many
friends among the fairies. Because they loved her they called her the
Dear Princess, and the country in which she lived was known as the
Crystal Mountain. It was the delight of the fairies to do her bidding,
to fly and fly over hill and dale to fetch her anything she wished to
have. Sometimes she wished to have very curious things, because all the
ordinary things that Princesses like to have had been brought to her
long ago by the fairies. If she wanted things that no one had ever heard
of before, the fairies would set to work to make them for her. One day
she said--

"Oh, Fairies dear, I am going to be married. I am going to marry the
Prince of the Far Land over the Hill, and the wedding is to be the
grandest ever seen. My dress is lovely: it was cut out of a rainbow on
purpose for me, and trimmed with the edge of a sunset cloud. But what
_am_ I to wear in my hair?"

Now, the Princess's hair hung over her in dark waves, like a long cloak.

"Flowers!" cried the fairies. "Quick--quick--let us fly for flowers to
twist in the Dear Princess's hair!"

So they all flew away, some in one direction and some in another, while
the Dear Princess of the Crystal Mountain sat and waited, with her
cloud of hair hanging round her.

Very soon she saw them flying back, some from gardens and some from
orchards, and some from the hills where the heather grew, and some from
country lanes where the flowers were very sweet, and some from hothouses
where the flowers were very rare. Wherever they came from they were all
laden with flowers. Some brought roses, red and white and yellow; some
brought heavy white lilies; some brought long trails of honeysuckle.
Some were carrying great bundles of forget-me-nots; others had strange
flowers from distant countries; others had bunches of golden daffodils.
They crowded round the Dear Princess, and laid the flowers in great
heaps beside her.

"Wear my roses!" cried one. "See how the crimson of them glows in your
dark hair!"

"Wear my daffodils!" cried another. "See how they shine like gold!"

"Wear my lilies!" cried a third, "for they match your lily-face!"

Then they all held up the flowers against the Princess's dark hair, to
see which looked the best; red, or yellow, or white. The Princess
herself found it very hard to make up her mind, because they were all so
beautiful that she would have liked to wear them all. First she chose
one, and then another, and then she thought that, after all, a third
would look the best.

This went on for so long that at last the flowers died.

"Ah, look," said the Princess, "the flowers are dead!"

"Oh dear, oh dear!" cried all the fairies together. "The flowers are
dead! What shall we do now?"

The Princess sat down among the dead flowers, and thought.

"I must have something that will not die," she said at last, "something
stronger than flowers. In my dark hair I must have something that will
gleam and sparkle. I must have colour that will not fade, a dewdrop that
will not melt, a spark of fire that will not go out."

"Dear me!" said the fairies; and they said no more for some time, for
they were thinking that the Dear Princess wanted a good deal.

After a time three of them began talking together all at once, as if a
very good idea had suddenly come into their heads.

Then these three spread their wings and flew away. They flew far away
from the Princess and her palace, far from the other fairies, up and up
to the heights of the Crystal Mountain. Then each of them chipped off a
little piece of the rock at the top of the mountain, and each, as he did
it, laughed aloud gleefully. Then each little fairy tucked his chip of
rock under his arm; and they all nodded to each other, still laughing,
and spread their wings again, and flew off in different directions.

The first of the three, with his chip of rock under his arm, flew
straight to the sea-shore. On the shore, close to the shining blue sea,
there lived a very nice mermaid who was a great friend of the fairy's.
So he flew to her with the bit of crystal rock and said--

"Mermaid, mermaid, here is a chip from the Crystal Mountain. Take it
for me, and dip it into the darkest and deepest deep of the blue sea."

So the mermaid took the crystal chip and dived down with it into the
darkest and deepest deep of the blue sea.

Now, it is well known that whatever is touched by the deepest deep of
the sea is changed by it for ever, and becomes itself a part of the sea.
And so, when the mermaid brought the chip of crystal back to the fairy
it had become like a chip of the sea--shining and gleaming and deep,
deep blue.

And that was the first sapphire.

And when the second fairy left the Crystal Mountain with his little bit
of rock under his arm, he flew to the great forest where the wood-pixies
lived.

"Pixies, pixies," he called to them, "here is a chip from the Crystal
Mountain. Take it for me into the darkest and deepest deep of the green
forest, and do not bring it back to me till the green of the forest has
sunk into its very heart."

Of course you must have noticed that the wood-pixies have the gift of
making things green; for every one knows that in the forest where they
live everything is green--the trees and the grass and the soft moss. And
the shade under the trees is dark, dark green, and here and there where
the sun peeps through, the green is very bright. So the pixies took the
chip of crystal away with them into the darkest deep of the forest and
laid it in the green moss where the green shadows were darkest under the
green trees. And after a time the magic of the pixies began to work, and
the greenness of the forest sank into the very heart of the crystal.
Then they carried it back to the fairy, and he saw that the greenness of
the deep shadows had sunk into the heart of the crystal, and because the
sunshine had peeped through the trees there was a glint of light in it.

And that was the first emerald.

When the third fairy left the Crystal Mountain with his little bit of
rock under his arm, he flew away to that other mountain where the
fire-gnomes worked underground. At the top of the fire-mountain there
was a great hole, and when the fairy stood at the edge and looked in he
could see the gnomes at work, keeping the fire alight that warms the
world. So he called out to them--

"Fire-gnomes, fire-gnomes, here is a chip from the Crystal Mountain.
Take it for me into the hottest and deepest deep of the fire, and keep
it there until its heart is glowing red."

So the fire-gnomes took the chip of crystal and carried it down, down
into the deepest deep of the fire that warms the world. And the fire
sparkled and glowed and wrapped it round. And before very long the
crystal began to glow too as it lay in the fire, for of course a fire
that is hot enough to warm the world is hot enough to warm a chip of
rock. So the fire-gnomes picked it up again and carried it back to the
fairy who was waiting at the edge of the great hole; and he saw that the
heart of the crystal chip was crimson and glowing like a fire.

And that was the first ruby.

Then he flew away from the fire-mountain with the ruby safely tucked
under his arm, and went back to the Dear Princess. At the same moment
the fairy with the emerald arrived from the forest, and the fairy with
the sapphire came back from the sea. They flew to the feet of the Dear
Princess, and held out the beautiful stones to her.

The Princess clapped her hands and cried--

"Oh, how splendid, how splendid they are! The blue is like a bit of the
dark sea, and the green is like the shade of the forest with the sun
peeping in, and the red is like the red heart of the fire!"

Then the first fairy laid the sapphire against her dark hair.

"You must wear it on your wedding-day," he said.

But the second fairy held up the emerald and said--

"No, no, this is what you must wear!"

And the third fairy laughed and cried--

"How silly they are! Any one can see that red is the colour to wear in
your dark hair!"

The Princess looked from one to the other and was puzzled. She thought
all the stones were so beautiful that she would have liked to wear them
all; but she did not think they would look really nice all together.

"What am I to do?" she said, puckering up her forehead. "How can I
choose when they are all so beautiful?"

Then there was a very long discussion about it. Each of the three
fairies wished his own stone to be worn, and the Princess could not tell
what to do.

"Each of them is quite beautiful," she said, "but, dear fairies, I am
obliged to say that I do _not_ like the look of them all together!"

All this time a very small fairy had been sitting quietly in the corner,
saying nothing, but thinking a great deal. He came forward now and
spoke.

"Give the stones to me," he said, "and I will settle the question."

So he took the three stones and flew away, far up into the sky, above
the Princess's dark head, above the houses and the trees, above the
Crystal Mountain even, into the misty sunshine behind the clouds.

Then he called to the sun-fairies--

"Sun-fairies, sun-fairies, melt me these stones in your furnace. Melt
them, and mix them, and make them into one stone. And soften their
colours with mist of sunshine, so that my Dear Princess may wear them
all together in her hair."

So the sun-fairies carried the three stones away, and melted them all
into one, and mixed them with mist of sunshine, and it lay over the
colours like a cloud. And then there was only one stone, but it was a
great big one, and as beautiful as all the others put together. For, you
see, that was just what it was.

The small fairy took it carefully into his tiny arms and flew down again
through the clouds, past the Crystal Mountain and past the tops of the
trees, to the feet of the Dear Princess.

He held up the great gleaming stone to her, and she thought she had
never seen anything so beautiful. For the blue of the sea was in it, and
the green shade of the forest, and the red heart of fire. And over the
colours the mist of sunshine lay like a veil.

And that was the first opal.

Of course the Dear Princess of the Crystal Mountain wore the great opal
on the day that she was married to the Prince of the Far Land over the
Hill. And when she was an old, old Princess, with white hair instead of
dark, she often showed the opal to her grandchildren, and told them how
it was made of blue sea, and green shadows, and fire, melted all
together by the fairies and mixed with mist of sunshine.




The sun-fairies were hiding behind a black cloud; but in the middle of
the cloud there was a hole, and through this hole the sun-fairies
peeped.

In this way they were able to see everything that went on in the garden
where the Big Spider lived. If the Big Spider had looked up at the sky
he could have seen the sun-fairies peeping through the hole in the black
cloud; but he did not look up, because he was thinking of other things.
He was in an excited state of mind.

Quite lately the Big Spider had spun a most beautiful web for himself,
and had slung it between two tall blades of grass. He was very proud of
it, for it was the nicest web in all the garden, being of a lovely and
difficult pattern, and made with great skill. And now something had
happened in the night to make it still more beautiful. While the Big
Spider was asleep the dew-fairies had crept up from the grass, and had
hung hundreds of sparkling diamonds on the strings of his web. He knew
it must have been done by the dew-fairies, because they only keep the
very best diamonds.

"Dear me, this is most kind of them," he said to himself. "They must
have noticed that my web was the best in the garden; otherwise they
would not have done it so much honour."

As a matter of fact, the dew-fairies had been hanging diamonds that
night on the webs of all the spiders in the garden; but the Big Spider
was so much occupied in admiring his own web that he had no attention
to spare for the others.

"Good morning," he said pleasantly to a fly who was passing. "Have you
seen my diamonds? They look very well there, don't they? They show off
the pattern of the web. Won't you come a little closer? You can hardly
see them properly at that distance. One really sees them best when one
is inside the web. Can't you come in this morning?"

"No, thank you," said the fly firmly; for his mother had told him that
the Big Spider was not a nice friend for little flies.

Then he flew away, and the Spider went on admiring his diamonds. He
looked at them first from the right, and then from the left, and then he
stepped backwards and looked at them again. If you have ever seen a
person who paints pictures you will know exactly how he behaved.

All this time the sun-fairies had been peeping through the hole in the
black cloud and watching the Big Spider. They could not help laughing at
him.

"Ridiculous creature!" cried one. "Look at him admiring his web, as if
it were the only one that had ever been hung with diamonds!"

"If he would look about him a little bit," said another, "he would see
that the whole garden is blazing with diamonds this morning."

"The very grass is all twinkly and shiny with them," said a third, "but
the grass-fairies are not behaving in that absurd way."

"No fairy would be so silly," said a fourth.

Suddenly a little sun-fairy began to clap his hands.

"I've got an idea," he cried.

As his ideas were generally full of mischief and very interesting, all
the other fairies stopped talking.

"It's a lovely idea," he went on, chuckling. "This is what we'll do.
We'll wait till that silly old Spider goes to sleep or is busy, and then
we'll rush down--quick as quick--and _steal his diamonds_!"

Then all the sun-fairies laughed and clapped their hands so loudly that
the hole in the black cloud grew a good deal larger. They thought it was
a grand idea.

They had not long to wait. Presently the Spider became rather tired of
admiring his diamonds all by himself, so he set to work to send out
invitations for a fly-party. He asked all the flies in the neighbourhood
to come and see how nice his web looked when it was hung with diamonds.
As soon as the sun-fairies saw that he was busy they took each other's
hands, and with a little run and a big jump they all burst through the
hole in the black cloud. Then they flew softly down to the garden where
the Big Spider lived.

"How nice and warm it is getting!" thought the Spider.

Presently he said to himself--

"My diamonds must be sparkling beautifully in this sunshine. I'll just
take a look at them."

He turned round, expecting to see the pattern of his web delicately
outlined in sparks of light. You will not be surprised to hear that he
saw nothing of the kind. He saw his web, it is true, looking like filmy
lace against the green of the grass; but there was not one single
diamond hanging upon it!

Then the rage of the Big Spider was terrible to see.

He stamped with all his legs, and he rolled himself round and round, and
he used all the most dreadful threats in spider-language.

"I don't care who the thief is," he said; "I shall think no more of
eating him than if he were a fly!"

At that moment he heard the sweetest little laugh just behind him. This
made him so angry that he spent a long time in looking for the person
who laughed. While he was still searching the sun-fairies flew up again
to the black clouds, carrying the diamonds with them.

"There," they said, as they threw the diamonds down on the cloud, "he
won't find them there!"

They had forgotten for the moment that, hidden in the black cloud, there
were a great number of rain-fairies. Now the rain-fairies never enjoy
themselves so much as when they are annoying the sun-fairies: and in the
same way there is nothing that pleases the sun-fairies so much as a good
quarrel with the rain-fairies. This does not prevent them from being
very friendly when they are not quarrelling.

The rain-fairies had seen all that had happened. They pretended to think
that the sun-fairies had behaved very unkindly to the Big Spider.

"It's too bad," they said, "to steal the poor thing's diamonds. It's not
fair. Let's throw them down to him."

Then a great fight began between the sun-fairies and the rain-fairies
for the diamonds, and the fight lasted a long time, and all the time
that it lasted the Big Spider was in a rage.



At last the rain-fairies won the fight, and went off with the diamonds
in their arms.

"Now we'll throw them to the Big Spider," they said, "and we'll see how
glad he is when his web is hung with diamonds as it was before."

They forgot that the dew-fairies, when they had trimmed the web with the
diamonds, had crept up softly and touched the strings with gentle
fingers. But the rain-fairies are rather rough.

They flung out their little arms and threw the diamonds down out of the
black cloud. Down dropped the diamonds, and down, and down, till they
reached the garden where the Big Spider lived, and the web that the Big
Spider had made. But instead of hanging on the web in rows, like little
lighted lamps, they dropped into the middle of it with a crash and a
dash and a splash, and broke it into a great many pieces, so that the
web and the diamonds and the Big Spider himself all fell to the ground.

And by the time the Big Spider was standing on all his legs again the
diamonds had disappeared into the grass.

The truth is that the dew-fairies had found them and had taken them
home. I expect they will keep them till the Big Spider has made a new
web.







Christabel was a little girl who read a great many books. She noticed
that the girls and boys in the books were not altogether like the girls
and boys who played with her in the Square and came to tea with her. The
children in the books were wonderfully brave and clever; and when they
were having their magnificent adventures they always did exactly the
right thing at the right moment. They never had a dull minute, and they
never said anything silly. The girls and boys who came to tea with
Christabel were not like this, and Christabel knew that she herself was
not like this. She never had any adventures, and she knew that even if
she ever did have one she would not behave at all bravely or cleverly.
And she was often so dull that she drummed with her fingers on the
window and said--

"What on earth shall I do?"

Now, Christabel had a Big Sister who wrote books.

One day she said to her Big Sister--

"How I do wish I were a little girl in a book! Nothing ever happens to
little girls in real life. It is so dull!"

The Big Sister went on writing, and said nothing.

"It's no use talking to her," thought Christabel, "because she always
goes on writing."

A few days after this Christabel began to feel rather strange. A kind of
stiffness came into all her limbs, so that they would not do what she
told them. And sometimes she found herself saying things that she had
not intended to say at all. This puzzled her and made her very
uncomfortable. She wondered if other people noticed that there was
something wrong with her. She even thought of speaking to her Big Sister
about it, but the Big Sister was so busy writing that it was no use to
try and make her hear.

This went on for some time. Christabel grew stiffer and stiffer, and
more and more uncomfortable; and her Big Sister went on writing busily.

At last one day Christabel understood what had happened. She woke up and
found that everything round her had changed; the people and the place
and everything. She was frightened at first, and then the truth suddenly
flashed into her mind. A most remarkable and unusual and unexpected
thing had happened: her Big Sister had put her into a book!

"So I really am a little girl in a book, after all!" she said to
herself.

She tried to say it aloud, but she found she couldn't. The words were
not in the book, you see.

"Now I am going to enjoy myself," she thought, "and never be dull any
more."

There was not much chance of her being dull, for the book was full of
adventures and narrow escapes, and other delightful things.

First she was captured by pirates; and after having a terrible time with
them she was saved from them by a shipwreck. The shipwreck did not do
her much good, however, for she at once fell into the hands of the most
dreadful savages. So you will understand that she was not at all likely
to be dull.

Christabel was delighted to find that she behaved, like other little
girls in books, with the greatest courage and cleverness. Whenever an
adventure was going on she always managed to get out of every
difficulty, and she saved the lives of several of the other people in
the book by her bravery. The strange thing was that she found it quite
easy to be brave; while she was a little girl in real life she had not
found it easy at all.

"I do hope the book has a happy ending," she thought sometimes.

She wished very much that she could peep into the end of the book, as
she used to do when she was a little girl in real life. Meantime every
chapter was more exciting than the last. Of course Christabel did not
know whether she would escape from the savages at all. Perhaps they were
going to eat her. That would not be a happy ending to the book, she
felt.

After a great many terrible dangers, she managed to escape; for a ship
sailed into the bay at the right moment, and took her home to England.
This was the end of the book. The person who was reading it shut it up
with a bang--and Christabel went to sleep.

By-and-by, some one else took up the book and began to read it. Then
Christabel woke up and found herself at the beginning of the story.
After so many adventures she was rather tired, and did not feel inclined
to begin them all over again. But that was just what she had to do.
Being captured by pirates is not nearly so exciting when you know you
can only escape from them by a cold, wet shipwreck; and when you are
shipwrecked you are not very anxious to scramble ashore when you know
there are a large number of fierce savages waiting for you!

"This is rather tiresome," thought Christabel.

She was very glad when the person who was reading the book shut it up
again, and she was allowed to go quietly to sleep.

But her sleep was not long. Every time any one began to read the book
poor Christabel was obliged to wake up and go through all her troubles
again. She soon became horribly tired of being shipwrecked.

"Have I got to spend the rest of my life with pirates and savages?" she
asked herself in despair.

It was especially annoying that they were always the same pirates and
savages, who said always exactly the same things. Christabel soon knew
the whole book by heart. She wished sometimes she could be one of the
pirates for a change, instead of being always a little girl.

"I suppose I shall never even be grown up," she thought sadly.

The most unpleasant thing of all was that she was never able to say what
she wished to say: she was always obliged to say what was in the book.
Sometimes she opened her mouth to say what was in her mind, and then
found herself speaking words that had nothing to do with her thoughts.

"It is simply hateful not to be able to say and do what one likes," she
thought.

She made up her mind to try and be drowned at the very next shipwreck.
Of course it was useless for her to try, for the book said she was saved
by a big wave which flung her up on a rock. It was uncomfortable for her
to be saved in this way, but she could not avoid it. The shipwreck
happened in the usual way, in spite of her efforts to be drowned; and
then, as usual, she met the savages on the Island, and soon afterwards
came the end of the book.



Now, it happened this time that the person who was reading the book did
not shut it up at all, but handed it at once to some one else who wished
to read it. This was really too much for Christabel's temper. She had
had no sleep, and she was determined not to begin all over again without
a rest. It suddenly struck her that this was her only chance--now,
before the beginning of the first chapter.

She lost no time. She knew she ought to be standing up--the book said
she was standing up. Finding to her great joy that she was able to move
of her own accord, she calmly sat down and folded her arms. The other
people in the book looked at her in surprise.

"It's no use looking at me like that," she said; "I'm tired of this. I'm
not going on any more saying the same things over and over again. If
there's any pirate who would like to change places with me I don't mind
being a pirate for a bit. But I'm not going on being the little girl."

Then there was indeed an outcry. All the people in the book began
speaking at once. Just at that moment--before the beginning of the first
chapter--they were all able to say what they chose.

"Make her stand up!" cried one.

"I never heard such nonsense!" said another.

"Why can't she behave as we do?" asked a third angrily.

"The idea of wanting a change!"

"She'll have to behave like other people in the end."

"So discontented!"

"So very odd!"

So they went on, while Christabel still sat calmly, with her arms
crossed.

"I'm not going to begin all over again," she repeated firmly.

"But that poor boy is waiting to begin the book," said some one; "and we
can't go on while you are behaving in this silly way."

"I can't help that," said Christabel; "I'm tired of saying things I
don't a bit mean."

Before she knew what was going to happen Christabel found herself in the
middle of a terrible turmoil. All the people in the book seemed to be
rushing at her.

Far away she heard a voice saying--

"There's something very queer about this book. It seems all in a muddle,
somehow!"

Then there was silence, and Christabel realized that the people in the
book had turned her out! She was no longer a little girl in a book, but
a little girl in real life. She looked round and saw her Big Sister,
still writing.

"I don't want to be in a book any more," said Christabel. "Real life is
nicer. In real life one can at least say what one thinks one's self,
instead of always saying what other people think."

"Don't be too sure of that," said her Big Sister.







Little Fairy Flitterwing had no home. Whenever he settled down in a
place something happened to turn him out. If he found a comfortable
rosebud some one would come and pick it, and then it died and he was
homeless again. If he chose a pink-edged daisy to live in, the gardener
would mow the lawn at once. He grew very tired of wandering about the
garden, and he determined at last to go out into the world in search of
a home.

It was quite a small garden, in the middle of a town. Flitterwing felt
rather afraid of venturing into the streets, because he knew there would
not be many fairies there, and not many nice places for a fairy to live
in. So he was a little sad and anxious as he flew over the high brick
wall of the garden and looked about him. He found himself in a queer
little yard, not nearly as nice as the garden, with a pavement of round
stones and an ugly brick house at one end of it. There never was a more
unlikely place for a fairy to find a comfortable home. Flitterwing was
on the point of flying back again over the garden wall, when he caught
sight of something green at the further end of the courtyard. Some grass
had grown up among the stones.

"The very place for me!" said Flitterwing to himself. "No one is likely
to disturb me here, and I can fly across to the garden whenever I feel
lonely."

So he found a cosy corner between two stones, where the grass was thick
and soft, and there he made up his mind to stay. It was not, of course,
the very best kind of place for a fairy, but, after all, it was quiet
and near his friends, and he was terribly tired of moving about from
rose to rose and from daisy to daisy. So he thought he would make the
best of it.

Very soon he felt quite at home in the grass-patch at the end of the
yard. Every morning, of course, he had to attend to the grass and see
that it was always fresh and green, for it is the business of every
fairy to take care of the place he lives in. He does it instead of
paying rent. Then, after polishing his wings nicely and making them
shine like opals, he would fly across the brick wall and have a chat
with the grass-fairies and flower-fairies in the garden.

His life went on in this quiet and comfortable way for some time.

But one morning poor Flitterwing received a great shock. He was very
busy cleaning the grass with a dewdrop, and thinking how strong and tall
the blades had grown since he first began to take care of them. They
were a good deal taller than himself now, and he was not able to see
over them. So, when he heard a heavy footstep clattering across the
yard, he peered between the blades of grass to see who was coming.

"Oh dear, oh dear," he cried, "here's that dreadful gardener! I'm sure
he's going to turn me out!"

He quickly dropped the crumpled cobweb soaked in dewdrop with which he
was rubbing the green blades, and folding his wings closely round him he
hid himself in the grass, and waited to see what was going to happen.

The gardener was carrying a basket in one hand, and in the other a tool
with dreadful prongs. He was going to pull up the grass that had grown
among the stones! Poor Flitterwing's nice new home was going to be
spoilt!

One by one the tufts were dragged up by the roots, while the sharp
prongs clinked against the stones and the gardener's fingers crumpled up
the blades of grass that had looked so green and fresh a few minutes
before. Flitterwing was terribly frightened.

"The sooner I get out of this the better," he said to himself, skipping
away from the gardener's big fingers. Then he spread his wings and flew
up and away, over the wall and over the garden and on and on. He went on
flying, flying, till all his friends were left far behind and he came to
strange streets such as he had never seen before. Still he went on
flying, flying. You see he was extremely anxious to be very far away
from the gardener with the big fingers and the terrible, sharp prongs.

At last he became dreadfully tired. It would be impossible, he felt, to
go on flying much longer, so he looked about him for shelter. He saw an
open window, and beyond it a large cool room. Here was shelter at all
events, so he flew straight in. There were a number of tables and chairs
in the room, and at each table a man sat writing; but Flitterwing was
too much frightened to see anything. He only wanted to find a place
where he could hide and rest. A large ink-pot stood on a table, and just
inside the ink-pot was a little ledge where a fairy might rest
comfortably. Flitterwing lost no time; he darted into the ink-pot and
sat down on the ledge. In a few moments he folded his tired wings about
him and fell fast asleep.

Now, the room into which Flitterwing had flown was a place where a great
deal of business was done. Every day a number of men sat there adding up
figures and writing letters about dull things that neither you nor I
could understand. If you have done many sums, you will agree with me
that no sensible man could really like spending all his time in adding
up pounds, shillings, and pence. Very few of the men in this big room
really liked it. Some of them wanted to be playing cricket or golf, some
would rather have been reading books or listening to beautiful music;
and every one of them was longing to be in the country among the flowers
and the fairies. And there was one among them--a little man with a pale
face and a thin coat--who wished above all things to be making poetry.
There were two good reasons against his doing this. In the first place,
he was obliged to earn money, and this is more easily done by adding up
figures than by making poetry; and in the second place, he did not in
the least know how poetry ought to be made.

On the sunny morning when Flitterwing took refuge in the ink-pot the Man
in the Thin Coat was very busy. There were rows and rows of figures
waiting to be added up, so that there seemed to be no end to them. A
large sheet of paper was before him on which he was doing these sums,
and the figures were arranged in terribly long columns--and no doubt you
know how unpleasant that is. Suddenly something glittered in the air for
a moment and then disappeared. It was so bright that it caught his eye
and made him lose his place. He thought it was some beautiful kind of
insect with the sunshine caught in its wings.

"It was like a messenger from the summer!" he said to himself.

Then he dipped his pen in the ink-pot and went back to his sums.

He had been working busily for some time when he noticed something very
curious. His pen was not writing figures at all! He was thinking about
figures, and he wished to put figures on the paper, so it was a very
strange thing that his pen was writing words all the time. The words
were arranged in short lines with a capital letter at the beginning of
each line.

"Dear me, how annoying!" he said to himself. "What can I have been
thinking of? This will never do."

So he took a fresh sheet and began again.

He imagined that he was copying all the figures on to the clean sheet of
paper, for that was what he intended to do. He wrote the figures very
quickly, as he thought, because he wanted to make up for lost time. Then
he glanced at what he had written--and threw down his pen angrily.

There were no figures at all on the paper; nothing but line after line
of words. He began to think he must have got a sunstroke.

"This is really terrible!" he muttered. "I must pay more attention to
what I am doing."

So he took another clean sheet of paper and began again.

It was no use; the pen refused to make a single figure.

Then the Man in the Thin Coat was in despair. He pushed the paper away
from him and threw himself back in his chair.

"There is something very serious the matter with me," he said to
himself. He did not notice that another man had come up to the table and
was gathering together the sheets of paper that lay on it. This was the
person who paid the Man in the Thin Coat for doing his sums for him. He
had a round face and a big waistcoat.

"Come, come! what's this?" he said, looking at the sheets of paper.
"Poetry, I declare! So you're a poet, are you? That's all very well, but
I don't pay you to write poetry."

The poor Man in the Thin Coat looked very much disturbed. When you come
to think of it, it is a disturbing thing to find you are writing poetry
when you imagine you are doing sums.

"I couldn't help it," he said meekly.

"Yes, yes, that's the excuse they all make," said the Man with the Big
Waistcoat. Then he took up the papers and began to read. There was
silence in the room while he was reading the poem that the Man in the
Thin Coat had written by mistake; every one left off working, and
watched with great interest to see what would happen. The silence lasted
for some time.

"Dear me!" said the Man with the Big Waistcoat at last. "This is a very
beautiful poem!"

Then he began to read aloud.

The poem was about the summer; about the sunshine and the blue sky and
the singing larks that were far away from that ugly room. It seemed as
though the far-off fields and the glory of the sun had been really
brought there, to the tired men who sat listening. And to each man as he
listened came a dream of the thing he loved best. To one man the room
seemed to have turned into a garden; the scent of a thousand roses was
in the air, and the colours of a thousand flowers. Another man thought
he was in a field, lying under a tree and looking at the pattern of the
leaves against the sky. And another saw the sunshine sparkling on the
dear sea, and the little ripples running races on the sand. But the Man
in the Thin Coat saw more things than any of them.

And while they were all listening to the beautiful poem about the
summer, little Fairy Flitterwing slipped out of the ink-pot and flew off
to play with a sunbeam on the window-sill. The sunbeam showed him a very
comfortable scarlet geranium that was growing in a window not far off,
so Flitterwing went to live in it, and found a safe home at last.

And the Man in the Thin Coat went back to his sums. He was happier than
he had ever been before, because he had written a beautiful poem. He was
never able to write any more poetry, and he thought this was rather odd
until, years afterwards, his little daughter guessed the truth. He had
just finished reading to her his poem about the summer.

"Why, Daddy," she said, "there must have been a fairy in your ink-pot
when you wrote that!"







Long ago there lived in a far country a little girl called Gretel, whose
mother was dying. Before she died she said to Gretel--

"I am very poor, and I have no money to leave for you after I am gone. I
have nothing to give you but this box. It was given to me when I was a
child by some one who was wise and good. You must be very careful of it,
for it is full of Dreams, and they are hard to keep safely. You must
never open the box except when you are alone, or the Dreams will fly
away. But keep them safely till your hair is grey, and something will
happen to surprise you."

Gretel took the box and hid it safely, and said nothing about it to any
one. Her mother died a few days afterwards, and then Gretel was sent
away to be a little servant, and to work very hard. She had to get up
early, and light the fire, and feed the pigs, and she had to wash the
dishes and scrub the floor, and do a great many other things, so that
there was very little time for anything but work. All the time her box
of Dreams was hidden away upstairs in her little trunk, underneath her
Sunday frock. Often, when she was working in the kitchen, or in the
farmyard among the hens, she was thinking of her box of Dreams; and
sometimes when she was quite alone she would open it and look inside.
The first time she opened the box she felt a little bit frightened, for
she had never seen any Dreams before, and she was not sure what they
were like; but when she saw them, soft and pink and downy, like lovely
sleeping birds, she was not frightened any more.

"Oh, but they are pretty things!" she said to herself. "How I hope I
shall be able to keep them safely till my hair is grey! They look as if
a breath would blow them away, out of the window and over the hill!"

For a long time she was very careful not to let any one see her pretty
rosy Dreams. Indeed, she never spoke of them; and the old farmer's wife,
whose servant she was, little guessed that anything so strange as a box
of Dreams was hidden upstairs in the garret, underneath Gretel's Sunday
frock.

The farmer and his wife had a son about the same age as Gretel. His name
was Eitel. He was a big, clumsy sort of boy, and not very clever; but
Gretel had very few friends, so when Eitel was kind to her and talked to
her over the fire in the evenings she was very glad. Sometimes he
carried the big bucket for her when she went out to feed the pigs, and
sometimes in the summer they made hay together in the field on the
hillside. In this way they became great friends. Gretel told Eitel
everything that had happened to her since she was a little child; and
one day she told him about her box of Dreams.

"Let me see them, Gretel dear," said Eitel.

"Oh, but I mustn't!" said Gretel. "No one must see them till my hair is
grey. If any one sees them they will fly away, out of the window and
over the hill."

"What are they like?" asked Eitel. "And what are they for?"

"They are lovely," said Gretel, "but I don't know yet what they are
for."

"Come, let me see them," said Eitel coaxingly. "I believe I see a grey
hair on your head, Gretel."

It was really a bit of white thread, but Gretel thought her hair must be
growing grey, so she ran upstairs and fetched the box of Dreams down to
the kitchen. She opened the box very carefully, and Eitel peeped in.

_Pouf! Pouf!_ Half-a-dozen soft rosy Dreams fluttered out from under the
lid, and hovered in the air for a moment like wisps of pink mist. Gretel
shut the box with a snap, and tried to catch the floating Dreams with
her fingers. But it was too late. They floated higher and higher,
farther and farther, out of the window and over the hill.

"Oh, Eitel," cried Gretel, sobbing, "I have lost my Dreams--so many of
them--so many of them!"

"Well," said Eitel, "I don't see that there's much to cry about. They
were only pink fluff after all! I wouldn't cry about pink fluff if I
were you!"

So Eitel went out of the house whistling, and thinking that girls were
sometimes very silly; while Gretel carried her box upstairs, crying, and
thinking that boys were often very unkind. As soon as she was in her
room she opened her box again, and found to her great joy that it was
still half full of beautiful Dreams.

She soon made friends with Eitel again, but she never spoke to him any
more about her box of Dreams.

As the years went by Gretel became first a big girl and then a grown-up
woman, and still she had to work for her living. She lived in a good
many different places, sometimes with nice people and sometimes with
people who were not kind to her; but wherever she lived she had to scrub
and sweep, and get up early and go to bed late. She still kept her box
of Dreams safely in her little trunk, hidden under her Sunday frock.
Since the time that she had lost so many of her Dreams she had never
opened the box except when she was alone. She was afraid of losing some
more; and, besides, she did not like it when Eitel laughed at her and
called her pretty Dreams "nothing but pink fluff." So she made up her
mind to wait till her hair was really grey.

It seemed to her sometimes that this would never happen! Her hair was
browner than other people's, she thought, and was not going to turn grey
at all. But though the time seemed so long to her, she was as a matter
of fact still a young woman when she discovered that there were two grey
hairs growing among the brown ones. She was combing her hair at the
time, and the moment she saw the grey hairs she dropped the comb, and
clapping her hands for joy ran quickly to get her box of Dreams out of
her little trunk. She was so much excited that her trembling fingers
could hardly undo the fastenings of the box.

When the box was at last open she was still more excited. Her mother had
promised that she should be surprised, but she had not expected such a
strange and delightful and altogether wonderful surprise as this! You
could never guess what had happened! Her pretty rosy Dreams had all
turned into jewels more splendid than any you ever saw or heard about!
Every kind of precious stone was there--emeralds and pearls and fiery
opals, glowing rubies and sea-blue sapphires, besides a great many
strange stones whose names you have never heard.

Gretel gasped.

She sat on the floor beside the box, and stared and stared. She could
hardly believe that the glittering things were real, and she could not
believe at all that they belonged to her. At first she expected every
minute that they would disappear, and she was afraid to touch them; but
presently she took courage and lifted them out of the box one by one.
Then she took them to the light, and they looked still more beautiful
than before.

As Gretel sat on the floor near the window, with the many-coloured
jewels glimmering and shimmering in her lap, she came gradually to
understand that when her mother gave her the box of Dreams she gave her
great riches.

Gretel lived to be very old, but she never lost her jewels. She was able
now to show them to all the world without any danger of their flying
away, and as time went on the people flocked to see her and her jewels.
Eitel admired them as much as any one, but he could never be persuaded
that the fluffy pink things he had once seen had really turned into
these shining and wonderful stones.







I am going to tell you now about a fairy who lost one of his wings. His
home was in a white rosebud, which one would imagine to be a nice, safe,
comfortable home for a fairy to have. And yet it was while he was in the
white rosebud that the terrible accident happened which left him with
only one wing.

All would have been well if he had stayed in the country. But one day a
man came with scissors and snipped the white rosebud off the tree, and
packed it in cotton-wool, and sent it off to London. Of course the fairy
had to go too, and a very uncomfortable journey he had. There were a
number of other flowers packed in the same box, and in each flower there
was a fairy; so they were all able to grumble together. But you can't
grumble with any real comfort when you are packed very tightly, and have
to talk through a good deal of cotton-wool.

At last the journey was over, and the rosebud was taken out of the
cotton-wool and put in water. Then the fairy crept up from the heart of
the rosebud, and put his head over the edge of the petals and looked
about him.

There were flowers all round him: flowers in pots, flowers in glasses,
flowers lying on the table, flowers in baskets, and great bunches of
flowers in the big window. The truth was that the rosebud was in a
flower-shop, but he did not know this. He only knew that it was very
pleasant to be again in a place that was full of flowers and fairies.

He thought he was going to enjoy himself; but that was because he did
not know how cruelly fairies are sometimes treated in flower-shops. The
people who arrange the flowers have a horrible way of trying to kill the
fairies; and this is what they do. They take a dreadful, sharp piece of
wire and poke it through the very heart of the flower, and then fasten
it tightly round the stem! You will see at once that nothing is more
likely to hurt a fairy than this. Indeed, he would certainly be killed,
if it were not almost impossible to kill a fairy.

The little rosebud-fairy was lying comfortably curled up, deep down
among the white petals of the rose, when suddenly he saw coming through
the walls of his home a sharp glittering point!

"Oh dear!" he cried, trying to scramble out of the way.

But that was no use, the glittering point came nearer and nearer.

"Oh dear--oh dear!" he cried again. "Where is it coming to? Oh--it's
coming this way--the horrible thing. _Oh--oh--oh!_"

It was no wonder that he cried out. The dreadful wire had caught one of
his beautiful gossamer wings, and dragged it, and torn it, till there
was nothing left of it but some little shreds of fluttering gauze.

"What shall I do?" he wailed. "How can I fly with only one wing, and
what is the use of a fairy that can't fly? What shall I do?"

He picked up the torn pieces of his wing and wondered if he could mend
them. But he soon saw that it was impossible, so he folded them up
carefully and laid them inside the rose-petals; and ever afterwards
there was a faint tinge of pink deep down in the heart of the rosebud.

For a long time, long after the rosebud had been tied up with a sprig of
fern and put in the window, the poor little fairy went on moaning and
sighing over the loss of his wing. He was still sighing when a little
girl came into the shop. If the fairy had not been hiding among the
petals of his rosebud he would have seen at once that she was the kind
of little girl that the fairies always love; a little girl with bright
eyes and a laughing face--altogether a very nice little girl. She
pointed to the white rosebud and said--

"I want to buy that rosebud, please, for Granny's birthday."

In another minute she was walking along the street with the rosebud in
her fat hand.

Then the fairy crept up from the heart of the rose and looked over the
edge of the petals. The little girl saw him at once and was not at all
surprised.

"There you are!" she said. "I wondered when you would look out. Of
course I knew there was a fairy in the rosebud, or I wouldn't have
bought it. It would have been no use, you see."

"What a very nice little girl!" thought the fairy. "She seems to have a
great deal of sense."

The little girl went on: "Poor thing, I see your wing has been torn off.
That nearly always happens to the fairies that come from flower-shops.
But I dare say Granny won't mind. She sees very few fairies. I am going
to leave you at Granny's house because it is her birthday. Now remember,
you're to be very nice to Granny, because she sees so few fairies."

By this time they had reached Granny's house. Granny lived all alone in
a very splendid house in a great square. The house had a great many fine
things in it: handsome furniture and valuable china and grand silks and
brocades. But there was not a single fairy in it, and a house that has
no fairies in it is a very dull place.

Granny was sitting alone on her birthday. She looked round the great
drawing-room and thought there were a number of empty chairs and sofas
in it. That made her feel very lonely. No one had been to see her on her
birthday; she had had no presents or letters; no one had noticed her
birthday at all. If there had been any fairies in the house Granny would
not have felt so lonely, because the fairies are always good company.
But poor Granny had quite forgotten all about the fairies; it was so
long since she had seen any.

Then a footman brought the white rosebud into the room, with a message
from the little girl with the bright eyes and the nice laughing face.

Granny sat for a long time with the white rosebud on her knee. She felt
happier than she had been all day. She sat so still that the fairy
thought he might safely peep out and see what was going on. To his great
surprise Granny noticed him at once; he had not thought it at all likely
that she would see him, for she was not the kind of person who often
sees fairies. Probably she would not have seen him if she had not been
so sad and lonely.

"Why," she said, "it's a fairy! It is years since I saw a fairy. I
thought I should never see one again."

When the fairy saw that Granny was glad to see him, he crept out of the
rosebud and sat on her wrinkled hand, and talked to her.

"Poor little thing," said Granny, "you have lost one of your wings.
Well, it was not likely that any but a one-winged fairy would find his
way in here."

Then she sighed. So the fairy, to cheer her up, told her all about the
lovely garden he had left behind him in the country--the garden where he
had lived before the man with the scissors came to cut the rosebud. He
told her about the other roses and the fairies that lived in them, and
the tall hollyhocks whose fairies were so prim and old-fashioned, and
the sweet, shy love-in-a-mist whose fairies always wore veils when they
went out, and the sunflower-fairies who had never been taught that it
was rude to stare, and the dear unselfish verbena fairies who made the
world so sweet for other people and never thought of themselves. Then
Granny remembered all sorts of things that she had forgotten for
years--fairies she used to know when she was a little girl, and the
stories they used to tell her. She told some of the stories to the
rosebud fairy, and they talked together for a long time. Granny was
happier that evening than she had been for a great many evenings. She
said to herself that her birthday had been a very nice one after all.

"Won't you come and live with me?" she said.

The fairy looked round the room.

"Well," he said, "I should like to stay very much, but I really don't
see any place here for me to live. My rosebud will soon die and be
thrown away."

"But if I were to keep the rosebud always, even when it was dead? Would
you stay then?"

The fairy thought for a moment.

"I tell you plainly," he said, "that I don't like the idea of living in
a dead rosebud. But I know it's done sometimes, and one mustn't be too
particular when one has only one wing."

"I'll ask the little girl who brought you here to come and see you
often," said Granny, "and you and I will go out to-morrow and buy some
picture-books for her, and some chocolates, and then we shall all three
enjoy ourselves together."

The fairy nodded happily.

"That settles it," he said. "I'll stay."





If you spend all the year in a big town it is a fine thing to have a
summer holiday near the sea. Otherwise you never have a chance of making
friends with the sea-fairies or the mermaids, who are the most
delightful playmates in the world. You may know all kinds of other
fairies, and be quite intimate with them, but as long as you live
nothing can ever make up to you for not knowing the sea-fairies.

Little Michael was eight years old, and he had never met a sea-fairy,
for he lived in a great town. Then at last his father and mother and he
went off for a whole month to the seaside. There were sands there, very
hard and yellow and good to make castles with; and there were lonely
caves with dripping walls; and there were heaps of slimy, green seaweed,
and shells, and rocks for climbing on. Best of all, there were plenty of
fairies. Michael made friends with all the fairies of the sea and shore;
but his greatest and best friend was a Mermaid who lived in a cave.

The roof of the cave was wet and green, and its floor was pebbly, with
here and there a rock. Every day Michael came and sat on one of the
rocks and listened to the Mermaid's stories, and to the soft, lapping
sound of the little waves. The Mermaid told him such stories as he had
never heard before, for she had not always been in that cave, but had
swum in deep seas and lived on many shores. She told Michael of places
where the sea was warm and green, and the rocks were made of coral, and
palm-trees shaded the mermaids when they played upon the sands. She
told him too of bitter seas that were made of ice, so that no mermaid
could swim in them; and of towering icebergs shining in the sun; and of
white mist-fairies, who turned the hair of mermaids into a shower of
icicles. Then she told him of sailors who had been her friends, and how
some of them were sailing far away, and some of them were drowned, and
how all of them were good playmates.

While Michael listened to these stories his eyes were very round and
wide open, and often his mouth was open too. He had never enjoyed
anything so much before, and he thought it would be dreadful when the
day came for him to leave the dancing sea-fairies and the Mermaid's
cave, and go back to the big town where he hardly ever saw any fairies
at all. One day he said--

"Mermaid dear, I want something to take back to town with me; something
to make me remember the sea-fairies and you, and to make me think of the
sea for ever and ever."

"Tell me what you want," said the Mermaid, smiling; "and if I can get it
for you, I will."

"Well," said Michael, "it's rather a big thing I was thinking of.
Perhaps it's too big to ask for. But you see the Bay is full of
white-horses to-day. Do you think you could possibly catch one for me? I
think if I could take home a white-horse from the Bay, I should remember
the sea for ever and ever."

The Mermaid slipped off her rock and dived into the deep water. A few
moments afterwards Michael saw her far out in the Bay, with her hair
floating in the wind, and her tail glittering under the waves. There
were a great many wind-fairies playing about that morning, and that was
the reason that the Bay was full of white-horses, for when the
wind-fairies are playing on the sea they always ride white-horses.

Michael climbed a high rock and stood on the very top of it, and watched
the Mermaid. It was grand to see her gliding through the water, chasing
first one white-horse and then another, diving and darting and dodging,
and enjoying herself all the time.

"Quick, quick!" cried Michael. "You nearly had him that time!"

But she was not quick enough, for the white-horse was far out of reach
even as she threw out her white arms to catch his mane.

The chase lasted a long time, for though mermaids can swim better than
most people, a white-horse on the sea is one of the hardest things to
catch. At last, however, Michael clapped his hands and shouted--

"She's got him, she's got him! Hurrah--now I shall have a white-horse to
take home with me, and to make me think of the sea for ever and ever!"

If it had been a fine sight to see the Mermaid chasing the white-horse
across the Bay, it was far finer to see them come prancing back again.
The Mermaid was not swimming this time, but riding on the back of the
angry white-horse, who plunged and galloped across the Bay, tossing his
long mane. And the Mermaid tossed her golden hair and laughed, because
she was enjoying her ride. Michael laughed aloud too, because when the
white mane and the golden hair streamed up together upon the wind they
were very beautiful to see.

And now a very curious and unfortunate thing happened. The wind-fairies
suddenly grew tired and went to sleep, every one of them. Now when the
wind-fairies go to sleep, the white-horses always dive down below the
sea and go to sleep too. Before the Mermaid had reached the shore she
was swimming again, for her white-horse had suddenly disappeared and
left her with nothing to ride. He had gone to sleep below the sea until
the next time the wind-fairies wanted to play.

"Oh, Mermaid dear," cried Michael, "what have you done with my nice new
horse?"

"I am very sorry to tell you," said the Mermaid, lying down on the sand
to rest herself, "that he has gone below the sea to sleep. It is really
most unfortunate, but when a white-horse wants to sleep you can't stop
him."

"Oh dear, oh dear," said Michael piteously, for it was a great
disappointment. "I did so much want to have a white-horse to make me
think of the sea for ever and ever."

"Wouldn't anything else do instead?" asked the Mermaid, who was very
kind.

Then Michael noticed that every time a little wave reached the shore it
broke on the rocks in a shower of coloured jewels. He pointed to them.

"Bring me some of those, please, Mermaid dear," he said.

So the Mermaid took a large shell, shaped like a saucer, and waited on a
rock till a little wave came in and sprinkled the rock with jewels. She
held out her shell to catch the jewels, but as soon as they touched the
shell they changed into water.

"Look," she said to Michael, "the jewels have melted."

"Oh dear," said Michael, "what am I to do? I am going back to town
to-morrow, and I have nothing to remind me of the sea!"

"Do you really and truly wish to think of the sea for ever and ever?"
asked the Mermaid.

"Of course I do," said Michael.

"Then I will sing you the Sea Song," said the Mermaid, "and after that
there will be nothing that can make you forget the sea."

So while Michael sat on the rock and looked at the sea, the Mermaid sang
him the Sea Song, which mermaids have sung to sailors ever since the
first ship was built. It is a song that no one ever forgets. It is like
the voice of the sea calling, calling; and there are many people who
hear it always, even in their dreams. If they are people who have to
live in towns, or in country places far from the sea, they are not very
happy.

When the Mermaid had finished singing, she said--

"Now I have given you something that will make you think of the sea for
ever and ever."

The next day Michael went back to town. He took with him the sound of
the Sea Song; and for ever afterwards he heard the voice of the sea
calling, calling, even in his dreams.

That was why he became a sailor when he was old enough.




  


PREFACE 



These books are intended to interest children in 
country life. They are written in the simplest language, 
so as to be fit for each class to read aloud. But 
the information given in them requires explanation 
and illustration by the teacher. I have, in fact, tried 
to make each lesson the groundwork for oral teaching, 
in the course of which the children should be en- 
couraged to observe, to bring in specimens, and to ask 
questions. Then when the chapter is read and re-read, 
as is the case with most school books, it will become 
part of the child's own knowledge. 

No one can be more aware than I am how very 
slight these outlines arc, and how much more might 
have been given if space permitted. But I hope that 
rnuch is suggested, and a teacher who loves nature 
will fill in the gaps. 

The charming illustrations will enable the children 
to identify the animals and plants mentioned.

We three friends, Peter, Peggy, and Paul, 
walk to school together every day. We all 
love flowers and animals, and each day we try 
to find something new. 

Peter is a little boy. He can only just read. 
But he has sharp eyes. He sees most things 
in the hedges. Peggy's father is a gamekeeper. 
She knows the birds and where to find their 
nests. Paul comes from the farm. He is a big 
boy and will soon be a teacher. 

We meet at the big pond under the elm 
trees. Then we walk along a narrow lane, 
across the common, through the wood, and over 
three fields to the village school. 

In the pond we find all kinds of creatures. 
In the lane are beetles and mice, flowers and 
berries, biids' nests and wasps' nests. On the 




common the spiders spin their webs on the 
yellow gorse. In the ploughed field the lark 
hides her nest. In the grass field there are 
buttercups and daisies. In the cornfield there 
are poppies and cornflowers. 

Paul is going to write down for us aU we 
see and put it in a book. 

 

When we cross the common on a fine summer 
morning, we see many spiders' webs sparkling 
in the sun. The webs on the gorse bushes are 
round. They are fastened to the gorse prickles 
by long silk threads, and each web has spokes 
like a wheel. These spokes are joined together 
with rings of silk. There are drops of gum all 
over the rings. It is these drops which sparkle 
like diamonds, and make the web so pretty. 

The spider spins a little tent in the centre of 
the web. In this tent she hides, till some insect 
flies against the gummy threads. Then she feels 
the web shake, and darts out to catch the fly 
before it breaks the threads. 

We saw a little bee to-day fly right against 
the web on the gorte bush. Out came the 
spider from her tent. She bit the bee with her 
sharp fangs, tore off its wings, and then sat and 
sucked the juice out of its bodv. 




Paul caught her, while she was busy, and 
showed us the two fangs with sharp points, 
which hang down in front of her head. Above 
them are her eight eyes, four large ones and four 
small ones. She has eight legs with such 
strange claws ! Each one is like a comb. 
What do you think they are- for ? She uses 







them to guide the silk threads as she makes her 
web. 

We turned her on her back and saw, undei 
her body, six little pockets, out of which she 
pulls the silk. It comes out through tiny holes. 
She draws it through the combs on her legs, 
and so makes her web as she runs along. 

Besides the webs on the gorse, there are 
webs all over the common close to the ground 
These are not made with spokes like the round 




webs. The threads are mixed up Hke wool. 
For a long time we could not find the spider= 
At last one day Paul said, " Here is a hole right 
in the middle of the web. It goes down into 
the ground." 

This hole was lined with silk threads. Just 
then a beetle crawled on to the web, and shook 
it. At once the spider darted out from the 

tunnel in the 
ground and seized 
the beetle. She 
was so quick that 
she had carried 
him down into 

HUNTING SPIDER WITH HER

EGO-BAG. could catch her. 

There are many spiders on the common 
which do not spin webs, though they hang from 
a thread. They spring on the flies and beetles 
on the ground, and are called "hunting-spiders." 

The mother hunting-spiders carry their eggs 
about with them in a round bag. Peter caught 
one of these as she was running along with this 
white ball under her body. He took the ball 
away and put it on the ground. When he let 
her go, she ran up and seized it. He took it 
away three times. Each time she caught it 
up again, and at last ran away before we could 
catch her. 






We were lying under the shade of the trees 
in the wood one afternoon. All was very quiet, 
when suddenly we heard such a strange cry. 
It was like someone laughing, " Yafhl, Yaffil, 
Yaffil." "That is the woodpecker," said Peggy. 
" Wait and see what he will do." 

80 we lay quite still under the tree. Soon 
the sound came nearer, and a great heavy bird, 
bigger than a large thrush, flew towards us. He 
was a beautiful bird. His wings were green, and 
so was his breast. He had yellow on his tail. 
His head was red, and he had a red streak on 
his throat. His beak was long and grey. 

He came quite close to us, hopping along. 
Then he stopped, and a long shining tongue 
came out of his mouth, and went back so 
quickly that we could scarcely see it. 

" He is eating ants," said Peggy. " The tip 
of his tongue is sticky and he draws them into 
his mouth." 

Then he began to climb the tree so funnily. 
His tail is jquite stiff and wiry, and he bent it 
against the tree, and pushed himself up, jump, 
jump, holding on with his sharp hooked toes. 
He jumped first to the right, then to the left* 
Then he ran round the tree and came out on tjfie 
oth«r side. 





All the while he was trying the hark with his 
beak. Tap, tap, tap. At last he found a soft 
spot. Then he tore off the bark and ate the 
grubs, which had made the tree rotten in that 
place. After this he came down tlie tree 
again. 

It was so funn}^ to see him. He came down 
backwards tail first, using it to steady himself. 
Then he spread his wings and flew slowly 
away. 

We crept after him, and bj^-and-by he 
stopped at an old elm tree and flew round it. 
Then we could see no more of him. : ? 

" His nest must be in this tree," said Peter. 
" Give me a back, Paul, and I will soon find 
it." 

So Paul let Peter climb on his back till he 
could reach the branches of the tree. Then 
Peter caught hold of the boughs, and crept 
round the trunk. 

" Here it is," he cried at last " There is a 
small hole, just big enough for a bird to creep 
in. But they have made such a big hole inside 
the tree. I can only just reach down." 

Then Peter drew his hand back with the 
mother bird in it. Her head was not so red 
as the father's, and she had no red whiskers. 
He let her fly away, and then pulled out six 
white shining eggs. 





I can feel a number of soft chips of wood at 
 the bottom of the 
hole," said he. 
''Shall I put the 



eggs back?" 

" Of course,'' 
said Paul ; " then 
the mother will fly 
back and sit on 
them, and we will 
come again and see 
the little birds when 
they are hatched." 

So we went 
away. But every 
day, as we came 
from school, we 
turned aside to see if the 
little woodpeckers had 
come out of their shells. 
At last one day we saw 
the old woodpeckers carry- 
ing insects into the hole. 






After some time we saw 
the young birds out on 
the tree. They could not 
fly. But they ran about 

the branches, and jumped so funnily with their 

stiff tails. 




A week later we saw them flying about, and 
when we came again they were all gone. Peter 
climbed up and found the nest quite empty. 


We are always glad when April comes. Then 
we can find many flowers on our way to school. 
Even in February there are snowdrops in the 
orchard, and Peter knows where he can some- 
times find a primrose or violet in flower. 

But we cannot get a good bunch till April. 
Before that the plants are busy growing their 
leaves. 

The first bright flowers we find are the 
daffodils in the fields, and the anemones in 
the woods. We call the daffodils "Lent lilies" 
and we put them in the church at Easter. 
They have very long, narrow leaves which come 
straight out of the ground. Each flower hangs 
on its own tall stalk. It has a deep yellow 
tube in the middle, with a crown of pale yellow 
leaves round it. If you dig up a daffodil plant 
you will find that it has a bulb like an onion. 
Paul says this is why it blooms so early. It 
stores up food in the bulb in the autumn. Then 
it uses this food in January to make its leaves 
and flowers. 

The wood - anemone is Peggy's favourite 








flower. It is called the '' wind-flower " because 
it nods so prettily in the wind. Its soft pink 
and white flower stands high up on a long stalk, 

which has three 
feathery green 
leaves half-way 
down. When 
the sun shines, 
it is a little pink 
and white cup, 
but when the 
clouds gather 
and the rain 
falls, it shuts up 
in a tight bud, 
till sunshine 
comes again. 

Peggy once 
bit one of the 
leaves of the anemone. It 
burnt her tongue and tasted 
T ery bitter. Then Paul told 
us that the plant is poi- 
sonous. This is one reason 
why there are so many 
anemones in the wood. 
Animals will not eat the leaves, but leave them 
alone to grow. 

The anemone has not got a bulb. It has a 




thick brown stem under the ground in which it 
stores its food. 

Before the daffodils and anemones are over, 
the primroses and violets cover the banks. It is 
pretty to watch the primrose plant on a wet 
morning. The leaves are not smooth. They 
have hills and valleys all along them. The 
water runs so cleverly down the valleys of the 
leaf. These guide it down to the roots, so that 
the plant can drink. 

How busy, too, the bees and flies are. They 
jettle first on one primrose, then on another. 
We know what they find there. If you pull off 
the yellow crown of the primrose, and suck the 
end of the tube, you will taste something sweet. 
This is the honey that the bees come to find. 
And besides the honey they carry off some 
yellow dust from flower to flower. Paul says 
that this is good for the flowers, as we shall 
learn some day. 

The honey in the violets is not so easy to 
find. But we have found it. When a violet 
looks straight at you, it shows five purple leaves 
and a little yellow beak in the middle. But if 
you look behind, you will find a small long bag, 
like the finger of a glove. We have often pulled 
this off and sucked it. It is full of honey. When 
the bee sits on the flower, and thrusts her head 
into the yeUow beak in the middle, she sips out 




the toney with her tongue from the bag or spur 
behind the flower. 

With primroses and violets and blue-hells 
the bees can now find plenty of ho'aey to fil? 
their hives. 


We have a pet called Bobby, and we love him 
very much. He is a little squirrel, living among 
the beech trees of the wood. 

We see him every morning leaping from 
branch to branch, with his long furry tail 
stretched out behind. Sometimes he leaps right 
down on to the ground and runs about picking 
up beech nuts. 

Sometimes he sits bolt upright on a branch, 
with a nut or acorn in his paws. Then his tail 
is bent up against his back. 

We have known him for two years, and when 
we whistle to him he comes to us. But if any- 
thing frightens him he darts away to the nearest 
tree. He climbs up in a moment with his sharp 
claws, and peeps back through the green leaves 
We see his bright black eyes looking down at 
us. 

His back is covered with a brown red fur, 
but under his body the fur is white. His lovely 
red tail is like a brush on his back. His hind 




legs are long. That is why he can jump so well. 
On his front paws one toe stands out from the 
others, almost like our thumb. He uses his 
paws like hands, when he sits up with a nut in 
them, and peels off the brown skin with his 
teeth. 

Sometimes he steals birds' eggs. Then he 
holds the egg in his paws, cracks the top, and 
sucks out the yolk. 

He has such funny ears ! They have long 
tufts of hair behind them He sometimes comes 
out of his hole in winter to eat, and we see that 
the tufts are much longer then than in summer. 

But for most of the winter we never see him. 
He is fast asleep in a hole in a tree. We know 
where his hole is, for Peter found it once. He 
had seen Bobby come down one mild day to feed 
on his store of acorns, buried at the foot of the 
tree, and he watched him as he went back. Then 
he climbed up the tree, and in a hole in the trunk 
he saw Bobby's bushy tail curled round. So he 
knew that Bobby was snag a,nd cosy in the hole. 

Bobby has a little wife, and they always 
keep near each other. But she is very shy, and 
will not come to us. In the spring, when there 
are no nuts, they eat the buds of the trees. 

About May they are very busy. They gather 
leaves, and moss, and twigs. These they weave 
into a nest in a fork of the tree, far from the 




ground. Tlien in June their little ones are born, 
Paul climbed up and saw four such lovely little 
squirrels, covered with soft red and white fur. 
They stayed in the nest for some time, though 
we often saw them moving about among the 
branches. The old squirrels took such care of 
them, and they stayed together all the summer. 
In the autumn they hid little heaps of nuts and 
acorns at the foot of the tree, to eat when they 
should awake in the mild days in winter. 

Then we did not see them again. We do not 
know whether they all crept into one hole, or 
whether they each found a hole, and curled 
themselves up to sleep. 



Theee are a great many larks near our home. 
They sing so gaily in the morning as we go to 
school. But they sing much earlier than that. 

We wanted once to try if we could get up 
before the lark. So we agreed to meet at five 
o'clock in the morning, in the meadow where 
one has been singing all this year. We heard 
him before we got out of the lane. There he 
was, rising up into the air, going a little to the 
right, and then a little to the left, rising and 
singing all the time, as if he wanted to wake all 
the world with joy. 





We watched him till he was quite a tiny 
speck in the sky. Then he came down again. 
When he was only a few feet from the ground 
le shut his wings and dropped into the grass. 

The next morning we went at four o'clock, 
That lark was not singing, but one in the next 
field was rising up as gay as a lark could be. 
Then our mothers said we must not get up 
any earlier. So we could not rise before the 
larks. 

We caught a lark once to look at it, and then 
let it fly away again. It is not a gay bird. It 
has brown wings marked with dark streaks. 
Its breast and throat are a dull white, dotted 
with brown spots, and it has a white streak 
above its eye. Its feet are curious. The toes lie 
flat on the ground, and the hind toe has a very 
long claw. If you watch a lark you will see 
that he runs, he does not hop. Neither does he 
perch in the trees, and only sometimes on a low 
bush. He lives on the ground, except when he 
rises up to sing. 

In the winter, as we go to school, we see large 
flocks of larks in the fields, looking for insects, 
and seeds of wheat and oats. When we come 
near them, they get up, a few at a time, and fly 
away a little further. Then they wheel round 
and settle down to feed. 

In the winter thej'' scarcely ever sing. It 



i 






is in the spring, when they pair, that they sing 
so beautifully- 

About March we can often find a lark's nest 
hidden in the 
grass. They 
build in a rut, 
or a little hollow 
in the ground, 
often in the 
middle of the 
field. They line 
the nest with 
dry grass, and 
lay four or five 
eggs in it. The 
eggs are a dirty 
grey colour with 
brown spots on 
them, and they 
lie very snugly 
in the thick 
tufts of grass. 

When the lark comes down after singing he 
does not drop close to the nest but a little way 
off. Then he runs up to the nest through the 
grass. This is because he is afraid that the 
sparrow-hawk might see the nest, and pounce on 
the little ones. 

The sparrow-hawk is the lark's great enemv. 




One day we were looking at a lark rising up, and 
all at once we saw a sparrow-liawk just going to 
pounce upon it. The lark saw him too, and 
darted up faster than the hawk could soar. Then 
the hawk flew away a little and hovered about 
till the lark was tired and was obliged to come 
down. Then once more the hawk tried to 
pounce. But the lark was too clever for him. 
He closed his wings and dropped right down 
into the thick grass, and the hawk could not 
find him. We were glad the little lark was safe, 
and got back to his wife and little ones. 

 

We pass through a small nut-wood on our way 
to school. In the winter, when there are no 
leaves on the trees, we see the grey clusters 
which we call "lambs-tails" hanging on the 
nut-bushes, Paul says their real name is " cat- 
kins." 

We often look at them to see how they grow. 
At first they are only like little grey buds on the 
branch. Then they grow larger and hang down. 
By degrees they become very loose, like tassels, 
and under the grey scales come some little bags 
of yellow dust . 

Then in March, still before the leaves are on 


the trees, the wind shakes the tree and blows the 
yellow dust about. 

. By this time we find small flowers, grow- 
ing near the end of the branches. You have to 
look well to find them. But they are very 
pretty. Each flower has two tiny red horns, 
and there are many flowers in one green 
cup. 

We know that these red flowers grow into 
nuts, for we find the nuts just in that place in 
September. When the wind blows the yellow 
dust out of the lambs- tails, some of it falls on 
the red horns of the flowers, and this makes the 
nut grow. 

In the autumn we look out well to see when 
the nuts are ripe. We want to get some before 
the Squirrels, and the little birds called Nut- 
hatches, carry them all away. 

Peggy is in such a hurry that she picks them 
sometimes before they are ripe. This is foolish, 
for then there is only a very small watery kernel 
inside. The rest of the shell is filled mth white 
soft stuff. 

Paul says this white stuff is the food which 
the nut uses to make itself large and firm. 
When the nuts are ripe they drop quite easily 
out of the brown leafy cup in which they sit. 

Sometimes when we pick the nuts we find 
one with a little hole in the shell. Then we 



know that the nut is a bad one, and we shall 

most likely find a maggot inside. 

It is so curious ! Paul tells us that this 

maggot is a young beetle. 

It does not look like one. 

But many beetles when 

they are young have no 

legs and are only grubs. 
This nut-beetle is 

called a Weevil. When 

the nut is quite young and soft, the mother 

weevil comes and lays an eg^ in it. She is a 

very small beetle and has a long snout. With 

her snout she makes a hole in the soft green 

nutshell, and then la3^s a tinj egg in the hole. 

By-and-by the egg hatches into a maggot. 

It grows fat by 
feeding on the 
nut. So when 
we gather it, 
the nut is half 
eaten, and the 
maggot is 
curled up 







in- 



side. 



If we had not picked the nut, the maggot 
would have eaten a large hole in the nutshell 
with its horny mouth, and then have crept out 
ot its mao^crot skin as a little weevil with wings. 



So the yellow dust and the red flowers make 
nuts. Some of these nuts we get. Some the 
squirrels get. Some the nuthatch gets. Some 
fall to the ground and grow up into young nut 
trees, and some the weevil grub gets, before 
they are ripe. 



Peteb has a fine old cat. She is very clever. 
She rattles the handle of the front door when 
she wants to come in. If she comes home very 
late at night she jumi3s on the wire which runs 
along the garden wall. This rings a bell, and 
Peter comes down and lets her in. 

But in one thing she is very stupid. She 
cannot learn that a shrew and a mouse are not 
the same kind of animal. We are glad when 
she catches the mice in the garden and in the 
field. For the mice eat our peas and the bulbs 
of our crocuses. They hide in the corn-ricks 
and eat the wheat and oats. 

But shrews eat insects and worms and slugs, 
and this is good for us, because insects and 
slugs eat our plants. 

It is so silly of Pussy, for she ought to know. 
When she has killed them, she does know them 
apart, for she eats a mouse and Hkes it, but 
she will not eat the sh?'ew. She only kills it 





ana leaves it lying on the path. We think she 
kills it because it runs away ; and does not eat 
it because it has a bad smell. 

A great many people do not 
know a 

mouse
from
shrew, 

for they are very 
much alike. A 
shrew is not 
qijite so large as 
a field-mouse, 
and a little 
larger than 
the dear little 
harvest-mouse, 
which makes a 
round nest of 
dry grass among  

the corn-stalks. 

We found one of these 
nests last summer. It was 
about as big as a large 
swan's egg, and the same 
shape. We peeped inside 
and found seven wee little harvest-mice, with, 
red-brown fur on their backs and white fui 
underneath. 




The shrew is more of a grey colour. But 
there is one way by which you can always tell a 
mouse from a shrew. The mouse has a short 
snout and four broad white teeth in front. It 
uses these for gnawing roots and bulbs, and 
biting the ears of corn. 

But the shrew has a long, thin snout, and it^ 
Grown teeth are very small and pointed, so that 
it can kill and eat insects, worms, and snails. 

Shrews and mice are both very busy in the 
evening. We go out sometimes to watch them 
when the moon is shining. The mice run along 
so fast out into the field and back to the hedge. 
Paul says they are carrying seeds and bits of 
roots into their hole in the bank. For they 
know that they will want food when they wake 
up in the winter, and there is none to be found. 
The shrews move more quietly under the hedge. 
They push their long snouts into the thick 
grass, and eat the earwigs and caterpillars. 

Both the mice and the shrews are very much 
afraid of the Barn Owl, which comes out at 
night and carries them away in her sharp claws 
to feed her young owls. 

Shrews do not store up food, for they sleep 
in a hole in the bank all the winter through. 
Then in the spring they line the hole with soft 
dry grass, and there the mother brings up five or 
six little shrews. 





The mouse, too, burrows deep into the bank. 
She lays up a nice store of food and goes to 
sleep. But she often wakes and has a feed, and 
goes to sleep again. She brings up a great 
many families in a year. This is why there are 
many mice. 



There is a big ant-hill in the wood on the way 
to school. It is at the foot of the old oak tree, 
near the path, and is almost as tall as Peter. 
It looks like a loose heap of leaves, mixed with 
sticks and earth. It is broad at the bottom, and 
round at the top. 

When we come home in the evening aU is 
quiet on the ant-hill. We cannot see even 
one ant outside. It looks as if no one lived 
there. But when we pass in the morning, and 
the sun is warm and bright, we can see the ants 
creeping out of the cracks and running about 
the heap. 

They are as big as a grain of barley, and have 
a tiny knob in the middle of their body. They 
have long feelers and strong jaws. They bite 
hard if you touch them. But they do not sting 
with their tails, as our house ants do. 

At dinner-time we find them still more busy. 
They have opened many holes in the hill, and 




hurry to and fro. Some fetch hits of leaves and 
sticks, and add them to the heap. Others bring 
in food. One day Paul saw a number of ants 
pulling a dead worm to pieces. Then each ant 
carried a tiny bit in her jaws to the hillj and went 
in at a hole. 

Sometimes the ants bring some little white 
lumps in their mouths out of the hill. Peggy's 
father, the gamekeeper, gives these white lumps 
to his birds to eat. He calls them ant-eggs. 
But Paul says they are not eggs. They are 
baby ants shut up in silk bags, and thej^ are 
called " cocoons." 

Keal ant-eggs are much smaller. When the 
baby ant comes out of the egg it is blind and 





has no legs. It is called a grub. The nursing 
ants feed it with honey, and it puts a silk thread 
out of its mouth and spins a bag round itself. 
When the bag is done, the nurses cannot feed 




the grub any more. So they take care of it. 
They carry it up to the sunshine by day, and 
down below at ni^ht. Inside the bag, the gmb 



grows into a real ant, with eyes and legs. Then 
the nurses help it out of its prison, and it begins 
work. 

One day Paul poked a hole in the ant-hill 
with his stick. We saw in the ground, under 
the leaves, a hollow place full of white cocoons. 
The ants were very angry. Some bit us, others 
picked up the cocoons in their jaws and ran 
away, for fear we should hurt their babies. 

When we came back in the evening the ants 
had mended the hill. Every hole was closed, 
and all the cocoons were safe inside. 




 

One day in summer we saw a number of ants 
with wings, flying over the ant-hill. Paul says 
these are the father and mother ants. The antp 
without wings are the nurses and workers. 




Last March, when the days began to be warm, we 
saw a big Humble Bee, or Bumble Bee, as the 
little ones call it, buzzing along across the field. 

"Look out, Peter," said Peggy; "that is a 
mother humble bee, who has been asleep all the 
winter. She must be making a nest." So Peter 
followed her. She flew to a bank, and went in 
among some tufts of grass. Peter put a large 
stick there, and we went to see her every day. 

We used to find her dragging in little piecey 
of moss. But we did not look in, for fear she 
should go away. After a fortnight Paul said we 
might look, and, hidden in the grass, we found a 
small round patch of moss lined with bees -wax. 




It was like a tiny saucer turned upside down. 
We lifted it up and found under it a few round 
Eat pockets, some as big as a halfpenny, some 
not larger than a farthing. They were made of 
brown, sticky wax, and when we opened one we 




found inside seven tiny eggs, as small as poppy 
seeds, and some little brown balls. The balls, 
Paul said, were made of honey, and of the 
yellow dust from flowers. In another pocket we 
found grubs which had already been hatched 
from eggs. These were feeding on the brown 
balls near them. 

The mother bee was very uneasy while we 
were looking at her nest. She sat down quite 





near. We could see how big and stout she was. 
She was so handsome. Her brown body was 
covered with soft yellow^ hairs, with stripes of 
black hairs between. Her wings were broad, 
and shone so brightly in the sun. She did not 
stiDg- us. Paul says that humble bees are very 
gentle But she was afraid we should hurt the 
grubs, which were going to grow up into work- 
ing bees. We put the cover back and waited 
two months. Then it was June. We were 
afraid the horses might tread on the nest when 
the hay was cut. So we went to look at it. 

Oh ! how big it was now. There was a large 
round moss roof. It was lined with wax, and 
was so strong that we had to cut it with a knife. 
The only way for the bees to get into it was by 
a long tunnel just under the ground. Under 
the roof were a number of dirty yellow silk 
cocoons. In these were the grubs, growing into 
humble bees. The cocoons were stuck together 
with wax. Some of them were open, for the young 
bees had come out. These had honey in them. 

There w^ere a great many humble bees going 
in and out. These had all come from eggs 
laid by the mother bee in two months. They 
were very busy bringing in honey and bee- 
bread for the grubs to eat. But Paul says they 
do not store honey, like our hive-bees. For 
when the cold damp weather comes, they aU 




die, except a few mothers. These creep into 
holes ill the trees or into a warm haystack, and 
sleep till the spring comes again. 

Ahout Christmas time we went to look at the 
nest. The roof was hroken, and the cells all 
crushed. There was not one humble bee to be 
found. 


Peter's cat is very fond of going into the wood. 
We are afraid she will be killed some day. For 
Peggy's father shoots all the cats he finds in the 
wood, because they eat the rabbits and pheasants. 

But Peter cannot keep her at home. As 
soon as it gets dusk, she slips out, aud often does 
not come home all night. She goes in the 
dusk, because then all the animals are feeding. 
So she can catch mice and young rabbits, as well 
as partridges asleep on the ground, and other 
birds in the trees. 

She is a very clever hunter. Her body is so 
well made for catching her prey. She is slender, 
but very strong. She can kill a mouse with one 
stroke of her paw. She can spring ever so far, 
and so quickly that few mice or birds can escape 
her. 

Then she has soft pads under her feet, so 
that she can creep along very quietly. And she 









can jump down from a high wall because the soft 
pads keep her feet from being hurt when she 
reaches the ground. 

We all know what sharp claws she has at 
the end of her toes. But when she is playing 
with her kitten or with Peter, her paw is so 
soft you would not 
think she could 
scratch. This is be- 
cause she has a groove 
in each toe under the 
skin, and when she 
does not want her 
claws, she draws each 
one back into its own 
sheath. 

But when she springs on a mouse or a bird, 
she strikes with her paw, and as she bends her 
toes, out come the claws and pierce the flesh of 
her prey. 

But how does she see the rats and mice in 
the night ? Paul showed us that she can open 
the middle of her eye very wide in the dark. 
We took pussy near to the lamp and saw that 
the hole or " pupil" of her eye was only a little 
narrow slit Then we shut her up in a dark 
room for some minutes, and took her outside 
and looked at her eyes in the moonlight. The 
little slit had become a large round black hole. 






The slit lets in enough light for pussy to see 
in the daytime, and vjhen she goes out at night 
the slit stretches out into a big round hole which 
lets in all the light there is, from the moon or 
the stars. 

But if it is very dark indeed, she feels hei 
way with her whiskers. Paul says it 
is very cruel to cut a cat's whiskers, 
for they are a great help to her in 
the dark. 

Pussy has a very rough tongue- 
If you let her lick your hand, you 
will feel how different it is from 
your own tongue, or that of a dog. 
It is so rough that she can rasp the 
scraps of meat off a bone, after she 
has torn away the flesh with her long pointed 
front teeth. 

Pussy is very clever in getting her living, 
and if you look at her head you will see why. 
For she has a good broad forehead with plenty 
of room inside for a large brain. We put a 
rabbit's head near hers the. other day. It was 
so narrow, and had so little room for a brain, 
we were not surprised that the cat is too 
cunning for him. 

Who would think that Pussy, who sits and 
purrs with her kitten by the fire, is so fierce in 
the wood ^ But Paul savs that there were once 




wild cats in Scotland and the north of England, 
and they were as fierce as tigers. Tigers and cats 
are very much alike. Tigers can be loving too. 
We heard a tiger purr one day in a wild beast 
show, when she was licking her cub. 

It was the middle of April this year when we 
first heard the cuckoo. We love to hear it, for 
it tells us that spring has come. This year we 
were very lucky. We saw a young cuckoo grow 
up in his nest. 

This was how it happened. 

We had heard the cuckoo for some time, 
cuck-oo, cuck-oo, and it seemed as if many 
cuckoos were singing. One day we heard such 
a funny noise, like kik-kik-kik. " Ah ! " said 
Peggy, "father says that is the cry of the 
mother cuckoo which lays the eggs. That is 
why there are so many cuckoos about. They 
are singing to her." 

"Well then," said Peter, "if she stops here, 
perhaps we may find one of her eggs. I do s( 
want to see a young cuckoo." 

About a week after this Peter found a tit- 
lark's * nest. It was in a tuft of grass, on the 

* Now called a " Pipit." But country children know it ag 
the " Titlark." 




bank, near the wood. Two small dull-grey eggs, 
spotted with brown, were lying in the nest. 
The next day, as we went to school, there were 
three eggs. The next morning there were four. 
But as we came back from school that afternoon 
there were five eggs. 

" The titlark cannot have laid two eggs in 
one day," said Peter. " I wonder if the cuckoo 
has brought one of her eggs here." 

For we know that the cuckoo lays her eggs 
on the ground, and brings it in her wide beak to 
the nest of some other bird. We looked every 
day for a fortnight. The little titlark was so 
used to our coming, she did not even fly off the 
nest. She was a pretty little bird, with brown 
spotted wings and a yellow throat and chin. 

At the end of a fortnight two little titlarks 
came out of their shells, and the next day two 
more. They opened their beaks for food, and 
the father titlark flew out to the field, and 
brought flies and caterpillars to feed them. But 
the mother still sat on the fifth egg. 

Two days later the fifth bird came out. It 
had a curved beak, and bent toes with short, 
sharp claws. Its toes were two in front and two 
at the back. Titlarks have straight beaks and 
flat toes, three in front and one at the back. 

So we knew our young cuckoo by his beak 
and toes. 




We came next day to look. The little tit- 
larks had quills on their wings where the 
feathers were growing, and their eyes were open. 
The cuckoo was naked and blind. But he had 
pushed two of the titlarks out of the nest, and 
they lay on the bank quite dead. 

The cuckoo had grown bigger 
Dven in one day, 
and the old tit- 
larks kept feed- 
ing him with 
insects as he sat 
with his beak 
wide open. 
While we were 
booking at him, 
the cuckoo 
pushed about in 
bhe nest and 
shoved another little titlark over the edge, on 
fco the bank. We put it back in the nest and 
then we had to go on to school. When we 
came back the cuckoo sat in the nest alone. 
All the four little titlarks were dead on the 
bank. He had pushed them all out. 

The old birds did not seem to see their dead 
children They were so busy feeding the big 
hungry stranger. They fed him for five or six 
weeks, even after he could come out of the nest. 





It was so fanny to see I The cuckoo was  arger than a thrush and the titlarks not bigger 
than a sparrow. Yet the big bird sat on a 
branch with his beak open, and let these Uttle 
birds carry all his food. 

At last he flew away. We heard a cuckoo 
singing in August, when we knew the old birds 
were all gone. We wondered if it was our 
young ''greedy stranger." 



There were so many moles in the barn field last 
summer. We used to see mole heaps thrown up 
all over the field. At last Paul's father sent for 
the mole-catcher. He put traps in the runs and 
brought in many dead moles. 

A mole is a curious creature. We country 
children call him a " wunt." He has a long, 
plump body and a short, stumpy tail. His dark 
brown fur is like velvet, it is so soft and close. 
He has a long, pointed snout, very hard at the 
tip, and his mouth is full of strong, sharp teeth. 

His feet are very curious. They have no fur 
on them, but are naked and pink. His front 
paws are like broad flat hands with very strong 
claws. They turn away from his body, and look 
too big for such a small, soft creature. 

Paul says these paws are the mole's shovels. 



He lives under the ground and catches worms tc 
eat. As he goes along he makes a hole with his 
hard nose, and then shovels away the earth with 
his strong hands. In this way he makes a tunnel, 
and when he wants to get rid of the loose earth 
he pokes it above ground with his snout. This is 
how the mole-hills are made. 



But the moles do not always stay under the 
ground. We have seen them sometimes on a 
warm summer's evening poking about in the 
hedges, looking for slugs and snails. There are 
more he-moles than she- moles. 

We wanted so much to find a mole's home. 
We dug down below some of the mole-hills 
hoping to find one, but we only found a tunnel. 
The mole-catcher laughed at us for digging 
there. He asked us if we thought that the mole 
would put a heap of loose earth over his home, 
to tell his enemies wliere to find him 




At last, one day a gentleman came to Paul's 
father and asked him to open a mole's home for 
him. He wanted to see what it was like. This 
was just what we wanted, so we went too. 

The mole-catcher took us some way across the 
field. At the corner near the wood we came to a 
large mound, under the trees, covered with grass. 

Then he began to dig away the side of the 
mound. By-and-bye, about the middle, he 
stopped and cleared away the earth very care- 
fully with his hands. And there, just below the 
ground, was a big round hole covered with a roof 
of very hard earth. He had taken away the 
side, and we could see in. The hole was lined 
with dry grass, and in it lay four tiny moles. 
We filled it in again very carefully and left the 
baby moles safe and quiet. 

We saw four holes in the sides of the nest. 
These led to the runs through which the old 
moles went in and out to feed. We are afraid 
they got rather filled with earth from our digging, 
but the mole-catcher said that they would soon 
be put right by the old moles. 

He says that the father mole lives in another 
home like this all alone in the winter, feeding 
on worms. Sometimes he comes up above the 
ground, and if it is very frosty weather he dies of 
Dold. He only takes a wife in the spring. 


 

Croak, croak, croak, we hear the frogs in the 
month of March. They make a great deal of 
noise in this month, because they are jnst awake 
from their winter's sleep, at the bottom of the 
pond. 

The mother frogs are laying then tiny dart 
eggs in the water. Each egg is not bigger than 
a grain of sand. But it has a coat of jelly, and 
this jelly swells and swells in the water, till it is 
as large as a pea, with a little black dot in the 
middle. The jelly lumps all cliug together. You 
may see them in almost any pond, driven up to 
the side by the wind. 

Soon the dark speck lengthens. A head 
grows at one end, and a tail at the other. The 
head has a mouth, but no eyes as yet. The tail 
has a fin all round it, and the tadpole wrigglep 
about in its slimy bed. 

In about a week it wriggles out of the jelly, 




and hangs by its mouth to the weeds (1). Then 
two curious tufts grow on each side of its head. 
It uses these tufts to breathe, by taking ah out 
of the water. You can see them if you dip a 
glass into the pond and catch a few tadpoles. 

By this time the tadpole has let go of the 
weed and is swimming about. A sharp beak has 
grown on to his mouth. He uses it to tear off 
pieces of weed to eat. Now he grows eyes, nose- 
holes and flat ears. His tufts shrivel up, and a 
cover grows over them (2), so that you cannot 
see them. They are now like the gills of a fish. 
He gulps water in at his mouth and sends it out 
through the cover. As it passes, the gills take 
the air out of it, and so the tadpole breathes. 

Soon two small lumps appear on each side of 
his body, behind the cover, just where it joins 
his tail. They grow larger and larger, till at last 
two hind legs come out. These legs grow very 
long and strong, and he uses them to swim. Two 
front legs are growing as well, but you cannot see 
them, because they are under the cover. In a 
few days these peep out (3), but they are short 
and stumpy. 

Our tadpole has now four legs and a tail. 
He has four toes on the front feet, and five toes 
on the hind feet, with a skin between the toes. 
So his hind legs are web-footed, and this helrss 
him to swim. 




He comes to the top of the water much more 
often than before, and sends a bubble of air out 
of his mouth. What do you think has hap- 
pened ? The gills under his cover have closed 
up, and a small air-bag has grown inside him. 
So he comes up to breathe in the air through his 
mouth, instead of taking it out of the water 
through his gills. 

Now he likes to jump on a piece of weed and 
sit in the shade. He does not want his tail any 
longer, for he can swim quite well with his legs. 
So his tail is slowly sucked in to feed his body. 

There you have yom- little frog (4) . If you look 
through the web of his foot at the sun, you will 
see that he has red blood now. But it is not 
warm blood like ours. He is always cold and 
clammy, because his blood moves slowly. 

He has a number of teeth in the top of his 
mouth, and such a curious tongue. It is tied 
down to the front of his mouth, and the tip, 
which is very sticky, lies back down his throat. 
He does not eat weed now. He feeds on insects 
and slugs. He catches them by throwing out 
his tongue and drawing it rack very quickly. 

He lives chiefly on land during the summer 
if he is not eaten by ducks, rats, or snakes. Then 
he drops to the bottom of the pond to sleep in the 
mud all the winter. 




EvEEY country boy or girl, who wants to learn 
xbout water-animals, should make a pond net. 
You have only to get a willow twig, and bind it 
into a hoop with string. Then make a muslin 
bag and sew a small stone in the bottom of it, 
and sew the mouth of the bag on to the hoop. 
Get a stick out of the hedge and fasten to it 
a long piece of string. Split the string near the 
end, and tie it to the two sides of the hoop. 
Then you have a net which you can let down 
and fish up animals from the bottom of the 
pond. You had better have a wide-mouthed bottle 
as well in which you can put what you catch. I 
know a shady pond just outside a farmyard at the 
turn of a lane. There on a bright sunny day the 
insects are often very busy. 

In one corner of the pond the little whirligig 
beetles are swimming round and round, making 
circles in the water. Their shining black backs 
look almost green in the sun. Every now and 
then one jumps up to catch a fly in the air, or 
another dives down to eat a grub. Drop your net 
into the water and bring it up quickly under a 
beetle, and put him in the bottle so that you can 
see him. 
jpsif You will think that he has four eyes, for each 
if his two eyes is divided. One half looks up 



into the air, and one half looks down into the 
water. So as he whirls about, he can see the 
flies in the air and the grubs in the water. 

Gnats are flitting to and fro over the pond, 
and there is quite a crowd of those large flies 
with gauze wings which we call May-flies. And 

now a more 
splendid fly, 
three inches 
long, with 
four big 
gauze wings 
rises out of 
the bulrushes 
and flies over 
the pond. 

All boys 
know the 
dragon - fly. 
H i s lovely 
wings are 
covered with 
cross-bars filled with air, and they glitter in the 
sunshine with red, blue, and green colours. He 
has a long tail and a thick body with six legs, 
and a round head with huge eyes. 

Each eye has more than ten thousand tiny 
window.'^' jn it, so that he can see up and down, 
right ^d left, as he darts about, killing the butter- 




flies and moths that come in his way. Then he 
settles down on a plant or bush by the water-side, 
and rests till he starts off again across the poiui. 

If you go often in April to a pond where 
dragon-flies are, you may perhaps see one begin 
its life in the air. This is how it happens. 

Under the water a large insect crawls up the 
stem of a plant. He has a body as big as a dragon- 
fly and has six legs. But he has a curious dull 
look in his face, and where his wings should be 
there are only two short stumps. 

He crawls very slowly up the stem, till he 
comes out of the water into the air. Then a 
strange thing happens. The skin of his l)ack 
cracks, and out creeps a real dragon-flv. 

First his head, then his body with its six le'>'s 
and four soft, crumpled wings, and lastly his 
tail. He cannot tly yet. He stands by his old 
empty skin, and slowly stretches out his wings 
to the sun. In a few hours they are long and 
strong and hard. Then he is ready (o fly over 
the pond and feed. 

This is how the (U-agon-ily comes up to the 
air. You will not lind him so easily under the 
water, but we will try next week with our ; net. 
We have seen so much at the top of the pond 
to-day that we have not had time to dredge in 
the mud below. 

To-day we will use our net. Hold the stick 
tight, and throw the net out into the pond as a 
fisherman throws a fly. Then the stone will 
sink the net slowly. If now you pull it gently 
through the mud and water-plants, you are sure 
to get something. 

Bring the net to land and lower it on the 
grass, and put all you can find into the clear 
water in the bottle. You may find a little fish, 
or some tadpoles, or water- snails. Or there may 
be one of the curious creatures shown at «, on 
page 10. I am sure you would not think this was 
the grub of a dragon-fly. But it is. It is a long 
insect, all joints, with six legs, and eyes some- 
thing like those of the dragon-fly. It has no 
wings, but a curious kind of arm, with pincers 
at the end, comes out from under its chin. 

This is really part of its under-lip. It is 
called a mask, and has a hinge, so that it can be 
folded back under the chin. Now when the 
grub wants food, he waits quietly in the mud, till 
a beetle or a water-bug passes by. Then he 
throws out his mask, and catches his prey with 
the pincers. 

Look nelt at the end of its tail. Some- 
times it is pointed, sometimes it opens; out like 
the leaves of a flower. Wben it is open tha^rub 





draws water in, and uses the air in it to breathe. 

Then it shoots the water out and so pushes 

itself across the pond. 

This dragon-fly grub lives at the bottom of 

the pond for two years. 
So you ought to catch 
one some time if you 
try. It changes its skin 
many times, and grows 
some wing-stumps. 
Then it creeps up a 





stem, as we saw in the last lesson, and becomes 
a dragon-fly. 

And now what is this in our net ? At first 
you may think it is only a bit of stick, or a 
piece of mud with little stones in it, or a 
number of bits of grass matted together. And 
cio it is. But there is something alive inside. If 
you look carefully you can see the head of an 
inswt sticking out with six legs behind it. This 




is a soft little creature called a caddis- worm. If 
you clear off the pieces of grass, or stick, or smalJ 
stones, or shells, you will find the soft grub in- 
side. It has six legs and a number of little tufts 
under its body. It breathes with these tufts just 
as the tadpole does with its tufts. 

You may often see caddis-worms creeping 
along the bottom of brooks, looking like tiny, 
moving bundles of sticks or stones. You may pick 
them up without using a net. They build these 
cases round themselves to try to protect their 
soft bodies, which the fish like to eat. 

By-and-by they will turn into little yellow- 
brown flies like moths. They rise and fall in the 
an over the water in the evening. We did not 
see them with the May-flies and gnats, because 
they do not like the sunshine. 

You wiU very likely fish out a good many 
little water grubs in your net. But you must 
look carefully, for they are very small. Some 
have tufts all along their sides. These are the 
grubs of the gnats and May-flies you saw flying 
over the pond. They all live some time in the 
water. And when they come out into the air 
they do not live more than a few hours. 


It was a lovely day in May. The sun was 
shining, the grass was green, and the bushes 




on the banks of tlie river Thames weie covered 
with fi^esh leaves. 

In a hollow place in the river a little fish 
was building a nest. The fish was a stickleback. 
It was not more than two inches long. It had 
three spines sticking up on its back. .Boys 
often catch this fish, and keep it in bottles or 
sell it to people who have aquariums. 

It was more pleasant to watch him at work 
under the shade of the bushes. He brought 
little pieces of fine root-threads and narrow 
grass, and made them into a tiny saucer at the 
bottom of the river. Then he brought more 
pieces and stuck them on with slime from his 
mouth. In this way he made sides and a round 
roof. When he had done, the nest was as big 
as a large gooseberry. 

It was about six inches below the top of the 
water, and had a hole right through it. When 
the stickleback put his head out at one end, his 
tail stuck out at the other. But he had not 
built it to live in. He wanted it for the eggs of 
liis young ones. 

He was a lovely little fish with a shining 
back, and bright red belly. He had a bluish 
green eye that shone like a jewel. 

Now that his nest was built he swam ofi" to 
fetch a mate. He soon came back with another 
fish, not so bright as himself. He played with 




her, and drove her, and coaxed her, till at last 

she went m at one 

hole of the nest 

and, after a 

little while, 

came out at the 

other end. 

She had de- 
posited a tiny 
packet of yellow 
eggs, which she 
left behind her 
Then she went 
away and took 
no more care 
of them. 

The 
father 
stickleback 
now went 
t hrougli 
the nest 
and took 
charge 
of the 
eggs. 
Each 

not bigger than a poppy seed, and the whole 
bunch was very tiny. He shook the nest up 
and poked the eggs into a snug, safe corner. 
Then he swam over the top of the nest, waving 
his fins, so that fresh water went in and out. 

Sometimes he went into the nest and 
brought out some dirty sand in his mouth. 
This he puffed away into the water. You see 
he wanted to keep the nest clean. 

He did this every day for three weeks, till 
the eggs were hatched. Then a number of tiny 
fish came out. They were so small and trans- 
parent that you would think no other fish would 
see them. But the stickleback knew better. 
There were plenty of hungry fish watching to 
eat the tiny fry, which were very weak and had 
to carry a bag of food under their body, to suck 
in till they could eat. 

So the brave little stickleback stuck up his 
three spines, and dashed angrily at any fish 
which snapped at his little ones. He seized 
their fins, and struck at their eyes and drove 
them away. 

He made a small round place in the sand at 
blie bottom of the river and gathered the little 
sticklebacks into it, and there he watched over 
them. Even after their spines were grown and 
they could swim boldly, he followed them out 
into the river to see that they were safe. 




You may find plenty of stickleback's nests in 
rivers and ponds, if you look carefully for them. 
Or if you catch several sticklebacks in a bottle 
and put them in a large pan with plenty of 
weeds and food, most likely you will see a 
stickleback build his nest, and learn what a 
good father he is. 



Hush ! Do not make a noise ! There is a 
kingfisher sitting on the bough of the willow tree 
hanging over the river. If we once startle him, 
he will fly away and we shall not see him again. 

How lovely he looks against the grey leaves. 
With his long beak and his stumpy tail he is not 
much larger than a sparrow, yet he seems to wear 
all the colours of the rainbow. 

He has a bright blue streak down his back, 
his head and wings are a lovely green, with blue 
spots on the tips of the feathers. His beak is 
black. His chin and throat are white. He has 
a red streak behind his eye, with soft white 
feathers beyond, and his breast is like shining 
copper. Even his feet are red, and look quite 
gay against the dull branch. 

> He is peering down into the quiet pool under 
the willow, watching the fish swimming below, 
There ! he has darted down to the water. New. 



 

he is up again with something in his mouth. It 
is a small minnow. He taps its head against 
bhe branch, and gulps it down, head first. -- 

One more, and still one more fish he catches 
in the same way. While he is eating the last, 
another kingfisher comes and perches by his side. 
This is his mate, who has been fishing a little 
way off. She is not quite so bright as he is, and 
has a httle bit of red under her chin. 

Now they are going home, and they fly away 
crying " Seep-seep-seep " as they go. They live 
in the trees and bushes by the side of the river. 
For you must always remember that birds do not 
live in nests. The nest is only a cradle for their 
eggs and their little ones. As soon as they are 
able to fly, the young birds leave it with their 
parents, and do not often live in a nest again, till 
they make one for their own eggs. 

I do not think you will easily find a king- 
fisher's nest, so I must tell you about it. When 
the mother wants to lay her eggs, the kingfishers 
dig a tunnel in the bank, and when it is made 
they dart into it so fast that you cannot see 
where they go. 

But if you could know where it is and dig 
down from above, you would find a snug chamber 
which measures about six inches across. At the 
bottom of this chamber are a number of fish 
bones Tshiph the old birds have put there. They 






are mixed up together so that they make a nice 
open floor, where the wet can get away. 

On the fish bones lie some shining white eggs. 
There will be seven, if the mother has laid as 
many as usual. And, if the eggs are hatched, 
there will be seven little birds. Each bird will 
have all the lovely colours of which I have told 
you. The only difference between them and the 
old birds is that their beaks are shorter. 

Though you may, perhaps, not find a king- 
fisher's nest, you will very likely see some young 
birds on the river. I was once out with a friend 
who was fishing, and while his rod was over the 
water, all at once two small kingfishers flew up 
and settled upon it. They rested a moment, and 
then flew on. He had only just thrown his fly 
again on to the water, when two more kingfishers 
flew up and sat on the rod. They, too, soon went 
on. It was clear that they were young birds 
just out of the nest and could not fly far. 

The kingfishers are the brightest birds you 
can see on the river. They look so pretty among 
the green leaves, and hovering over the water, that 
if you have once seen them, you will want to see 
them again. 



Have you ever seen a water-rat? T do not mean 
aiartdfTat swimming in the water, but a water-rat. 




or icater-vole, as he ought to be called, for he is 
not a true rat. I saw one once when he did not 
see me. What do 3'ou think he was doing? He 
was sitting up on his hind legs, and in his front 
paws he held a piece of the leaf of the sweet 
yellow flag, which grows so thickly by the river. 
It was that part of the leaf near the root which 
is thick and juicy. He was gnawing it so busily 
that he did not see me at first. 

He was a stout little fellow, not quite so big as 
a rat. He feeds on plants. When he cannot get 
pieces of yellow flag he eats duckweed, or even 
the bark of young willows. I could see that he 
had a short, thick neck and round head, with a 
short snout. His eyes were small, and I could 
scarcelv see his oars, they were so thickly covered 
with fur. His round tail was not very long and 
had short hairs on it. 

I sat down very ([uietly on the bank, not far 
from him. And i)resently he looked round and 
saw me. But as 1 did not move perhaps he did 
not think I was alive, for he went on munching 
his leaf. 

At last I touched a dead leaf with my foot. 
His ears heard quickly enough. He turned his.- 
little bright eyes to me, and in a second he was 
in the water and swam away. I was toe; late to 
see him go into his hole, but I found one not far 
from the flags, just under the water. ' ' 







I knew I should not find his home; for the 
water-voles make long burrows. I went for several 
days to the same place, and took some bread to 
leave there. At last one day, as I sat watching, out 
came my little friend and ate the bread. After that 
we met several times, and he became quite tame. 
But I had to be very careful. The least thing 
frightened him, and plop he went, into the water ! 

If you go often to a pond or river, when all is 
very quiet in the evening or early morning, you 
may sometimes see a water-vole swimming in the 
water, or feeding on the bank. He has beautiful 
yellow teeth. The lower ones are large and show 
very clearly above his short lower lip. 

The young water-voles are such pretty little 
creatures. They are born in a nest of dry grass, 
which the old voles make in the burrow, and 
when they come out they swim about with the 
old ones, and feed on the duckweed. 

But though the water-vole lives mostly in the 
water, he can come on land to gather his winter 
store. He is often a great trouble to the farmer, 
for he likes the carrots and potatoes and even 
the broad beans, which grow in the fields, and he 
comes in the evening to eat them and to carry 
pieces back to his home. 

A farmer once dug out a water-vole's burrow 
and found enough pieces of potato and mangold- 
v^rzel to fill a gallon measure. 



If your way to school lies along a river-path, 
where trees hang over the water, you will very 
likely have seen a water-hen and her little ones. 
Perhaps you may know where a nest is, either 
among the rushes, or on a bough of a tree over- 
hanging the water. 

It is made of dead rushes, and though it is 
quite close to the water, it is dry and warm. If 
you are bathing you may look in. You will find 
about eight pale-grey eggs spotted with red-brown 
patches. Or perhaps some of the eggs may be 
hatched, and then the young birds will be hidden 
with their mother in the rushes. They are little 
black balls of fluff with red on their heads and 
white tail-feathers, and they can run and swim 
directly they are born. All the time you are 
looking, the mother, hidden in the rushes, will 
cry " Crr-ooh^ crr-ooh " to drive you away. 

She is a black bird, about as big as a pigeon, 
with a bright red forehead and yellow beak. And 
she has white feathers on the edge of her wings 
and under her tail. When she is in the water, 
she keeps jerking her head down, so that you see 
the white feathers, and even her green legs with 
their red garters. 

Very soon after the young water-hens are 
hatched, they slip out of the nest and sw' 




round her. If you are lying very still among the 
bushes, you may perhaps see them all come out 
on to the bank, to feed on worms or snails. Then 
you can notice that their feet are not webbed like 
a duck's feet, but all four toes are separate.. 

But if you make the least noise, the mother 
will cry ^^ KreJc-hrek" to her little ones, and 
they will dive into the water and swim to a safe 
place among the rushes. They will not go back 
to the nest, and even if you beat the rushes with 
a stick they will not move. They know that they 
are safer in their hiding place. 

This bird is often called a moor-hen and she 
does go to the moors sometimes. But Water- 
hen is her better name. 

And now, if there is a large lake anywhere 
near, you will see the water-hen there, and 
another bird, which you may think is the same, 
for she jerks her head and dives just in the same 
way. But if you look you will see that this 
second bird has not got a red forehead, but a 
large, bald patch on its head, and it is larger than 
the water-hen. 

It is a bird called the coot, and often the 
•' bald-headed coot," because of its bald patch. 
If you see one on the bank feeding on seeds or 
insects, you will notice that it has a wavy skin 
round each of its three front tpe^^ though they 
are not joined together. 


But the coot is not easy to see, for she is 
very shy. She runs up a tree, or dives under 
water, before you can get near her. She has 
sharp claws, which help her to climb, and which 
will hurt you if you catch her alive. 

She builds her nest among the flags or rushes, 
almost touching the water. Sometimes her little 
ones are drowned when there is a flood. 

If a boat comes near her nest, she slips off it 
into the rushes and cries '' Keiv-Jcew" to entice 
you away. If you find it, you will see about ten 
eggs in it. They are like the water-hen's eggs, 
but larger, and the spots are darker and smaller. 
If the eggs are hatched, you will know the little 
birds by their bald patch, though they are black, 
fluffy balls just like those of the water-hen. 

You will not find the coot in rivers ; nor will 
you find her on the ponds in the winter. Then 
she starts off with a number of other coots to the 
sea in the south of England, and stays tiU spring 
comes again. 


When you go home from school, if you pass a 
pond, you are almost sure to be able to find one, 
or more, of the three water-bugs of this lesson, 
and I want you to look at them. 

The first is a long, thin, black insect. He 


walks on top of the water, looking like a needle 
on legs. He is sometimes called a "needle- 
bug," but more often a "water-measurer," 
because he seems to measure the water with his 
legs as he runs. 

He has very iine haii's under his body and on 
his legs. The air between these hairs prevents 
him from getting wet and being drowned. He 
has two long feelers, and a long thin beak. His 
legs and body are a reddish colour and his 
wings a glossy black. 

If you watch him, you will see him start all 
at once across the pond. He is catching a 
water-fly. Then he will hold it in his front 
claws, and suck the juice out of its body. 
Though the water-measurer has wings, he does 
not often fly. 

The next water-bug is not so thin. He is 
about an inch long, and has a flat body with grey 
wings folded across it. He has only very short 
feelers, and his front legs are thick and strong, 
with pincers at the end, and this is why he is 
called the "water-scorpion." He uses these 
pincers to seize the insects in the water, and 
sucks them dry through his sharp beak. 

He swims under water very slowly, or crawls 
in the mud, and is easily caught. You may 
catch him too when he comes up to get air. 
This he does in a verv funny way. He has two 






long bristles at the end of his tail. When he 
puts these together they make a tube like a 
hollow straw. He comes near the top of the 
water, and thrusts out the end of this tube into 
the air, and draws some into his body. The 

eggs of the 
mother water- 
scorpion are 
stuck on to the 
leaves of water- 
plants, and look 
like seeds. 

The last 

water-bug I am 

sure you know. 

He is a 

little 

fellow, 

" rather 

like a 

beetle, 

with six 

legs, two 

of them being very long ones ; and he swims 
apside down, rowing himself along with these 
two legs, as if they were oars. This is why 
he is called a "water-boatman," 

He has a long, sucking beak, but you will 
hardly see it unless you dip him out with a glass 




and look close. For as lie swims upside down, 
the bug bends liis head down on his chest, so 
that his beak lies between his legs. 

His eyes at the side of his head are very 
large, so that he can look both down and up. 
This is very useful, for he swims under tadpoles 
and grubs, and catches them in his claws. Then 
he bites them with his sharp beak, and sucks out 
their soft body. He is always swimming in the 
water, or crawling in the mud. In the evening 
he sometimes comes out and flies to another pond 
or ditch. 

The mother water-boatman lays small, long, 
white eggs on stems and leaves in the water. 
You may often find them in March, and in April 
you may see the little bugs swimming upside 
down like their parents. 

If you take the trouble, yon may catch these 
three water-bugs in a net, and put them in a 
glass, and see all I have told you. 

ljET us stroll a short distance along the river. 
How pretty it is, with the evening sun shining 
through the trees ! What a number of little 
creatures are enjoying themselves in the air 
and in the water ! 

Pale little TommY, who has come from 





London for a holiday, slips his hand in mine and 
says, "I wish I could live in the country.'' 
When he goes back to his own home in a narrow 
street, where there is only a hard pavement 
instead of green grass, and no shady trees nor 





flowing water, he will remember this walk by the 
river. 

Look at those fish, about three inches long, 
swimming up and down under the bridge. Those 
are bull-heads. They are called so because they 
have such broad, thick heads. And they have a 
sharp spine on each side of their head, which we 
might call the bull's horns. You will feel those 





spines if you try to hold them in your hand. The 
kingfisher knows them well enough, if he tries to 
swallow one, for they stick in his throat. 

You boys call them " millers' thumbs." 1 
wonder why you think that millers have broad 
thumbs ? The bull-heads hide under stones, and 
eat water insects, and the eggs of other fish. Ah ! 




Fred has caught one and put it in the bottle. 
Now Tommy can see what a lovely eye the bull- 
head has, and the red, green, brown and yellow 
colours on his scales. 

How busy those flies are with long wings and 
three long bristles on their tails. They are May- 
flies rising and falling over the water. They are 
not feeding, for May-flies do not eat, and only 
live a few hours. But they have lived a long time 
under water as grubs, Hke the di-agon-fly grub. 
They only want now to lav their eggs and die. 


The gnats flying over that quiet pool near the 
mill are quite different. One has just pricked 
my hand and sucked some blood, so I know that 
he can feed. But then gnats have not had so 
long a life in the water as the May -flies. 

Those gnats flying over the pool were onl5> 
born a few weeks ago. Their mother laid some 
3ticky eggs, each not bigger than the point of 
a pin, and left them in a packet on the top of 
the still water. They were very soon hatched, 
and a number of grubs came out, looking like 
very tiny worms with fine hairs on their sides. 
Each swam about in the water and ate specks of 
weed. 

Why do you think they swam with their 
heads down ? Because they could only breathe 
near their tails, and so had to stick them up in 
the air. 

In about three weeks each grub had changed 
his skin three times. The fourth time he came 
out with a wrapper round him, and if you could 
have looked at him then, you would have seen a 
perfect gnat, with wings, cuddled up inside. 

Now he had to creep out, and that was very 
risky. For if he fell in the water he would be 
drowned. So he stretched himself very carefully 
on the top of the pool, and began to push his 
head through a slit in the wrapper. 

Then he drew himself gently out, and stood 





on tiptoe on the empty skin, which floated Hke a 
boat on the water. He spread his wings, and 
then he was safe and flew away. Sometimes the 
wind blows him over before he can get out, and 
then he is drowned. 

If you take a pail of water out of a pond in 
May, and keep it in the open air, you may be 
able to see a gnat grow up, for there will most 
likely be a great many in it. But you must have 
sharp eyes, for they are very tiny. 

And now the sun is setting and birds and 
beasts and flow^ers are all soino- to rest. Soon 
the night-moths and the owls and bats will be 
coming out. We must go home. 


About live o'clock one tine morning in May, Tom, 
the gamekeeper's son, was examining the traps 
set for weasels, stoats, and other vermin. His 
way led him over a bridge across the river, and 
as he came near it he heard a strange whistling 
noise. 

Now, Tom was a Devonshire lad, and all 
country boys in the West of England have sharp 
ears for the calls of animals. Tom knew that 
this cry came from a father or mother otter who 
were fishing in the river with their little ones. 

Just below the bridge, where the bank wai 





very high, there grew an old willow tree, with 
branches hanging over the river. The water had 
washed away the bank under the willow, so that 
there was a big hole between its strong roots. 

Now, Tom knew that this hole was the home 
of some otters. Many a time the otter-hounds 
had stood in the water near this hole baying with 
all their might. But they could not get in, and 
the otters took care not to come out. 

The hounds were far away now, and every- 
thing was very quiet in the early morning. So 
Tom lay down in the thick grass at the top of 
the bank and waited. By-and-bye on came 
the otters, swimming smoothly along with only 
their noses above water. 

The old otters swam so quietly that Tom 
would not have known they were there. But 
the young otters were playing and twisting about, 
so that first their brown furry backs, and then 
their white bellies, shone in the light of the 
early morning sun, and the water splashed about 
them. 

The river was very broad in this place, and 
just opposite the willow was a small island. Tom 
was so well hidden in the tall grass that the 
otters had no idea that he was there. So ojie 
by one they scrambled up on the island, each 
with a fish in its mouth. Then they each took 
hold of their fish with their front ffijet, and began



bo eat just behind the head. They ate on till 
they nearly reached the tail and then left that. 

While they were eating, Tom could see what 
they were like. They had long bending bodies, 
and broad, flat heads, and their mouths and noses 
were short and broad. Their feet were webbed 
like duck's feet, but each foot had very sharp 
claws at the end. Then- fm' was a lovely soft 
brown, but the long hairs on the old otters were 
coarse, and they did not look so soft as the little 
ones. Their tails were thick and strong, and 
very useful for helping them to swim. 

The father tore the fish with his teeth quite 
fiercely, and sometimes threw small pieces to 
the young ones, who had soon finished their tiny 
fish. At last all was eaten up, except the heads 
and tails. Then the father otter slid down the 
bank, and the others followed him, and they all 
went to fish again. 

There are fewer otters than there used to be 
in the rivers of England. But they are still 
to be found in many places. Only, if you want 
to see them at home, you must get up early 
in the morning. 



"Where are you going, Peggy?" asked Peter, 
as he passed her in the lane, one Saturday 
afternoon in July- 
'' I am going to look for flowers, foi' the 
flower-show next week. I shall not gather them, 
but I want to see what I can find." 

" May I go with you ? " 

"Yes, if you can keep a secret. I want to 
make quite a new kind of nosegay, of flowers 
that grow in the water." 

" But they will all fade if you put them in a 
bunch." 

" I am not going to put them in a bunch. I 
am going to get one of father's large zinc pans 
which he uses for the dogs' food, and let the 
plants float in the water." 

So Peggy and Peter started ofi" to their 
favourite pond. 

" See, Peter, I must have one of those lovely 
yellow ' water-hlies,' with its large, shiny green 
leaf, and one of its curious seed-boxes, which 
remain after the yellow flower-leaves have fallen 
off. I know that this plant has a thick stem 
in the mud at the bottom of the pond, and the 
long stalks grow right up, so that the leaves 
float on the top of the water. Little beetles 
crawl inside the flower and get honey from 
under the smaU yellow flower-leaves inside. 

' Then I must have some of those white stars 
with yellow in the middle. They look so pretty 
among their small green leaves, which are cut into 
three half-rounds. That is the ' water-crow-foot,' 





and if you hook a bit in with your stick we shall 
see that it has some other leaves under water, 
which are cut into strips like fine blades of grass." 

" Why should it 
have two kinds of 
leaves, Peggy ? " 

'^ One set are 
its floating leaves 
to keep the flowers 
above water, where 
the insects can get 
at them, and the 
others are lighter 
and can spread out 
in the water with- 
out making so much 
green leaf. And 
look, Peter, the 
yellow lines on the 
white flowers point 
straight to the nar- 
row end of the flower- 
leaf, where the in- 
sects find the honey. 

" Then I must have some duckweed. It 
will cover the pan so nicely." 

" But the duckweed is not pretty, Peggy. It 
is all leaves." 

"No, Peter, that is just what it is not. Paul 




told me the other day that the duckweed has no 
real leaves. Each plant is a httle bit of stem 
with a thin root hanging down in the water. 
Very tiny flowers sometimes grow in a little split 
in the side of the stem. I shall try to get one 
of these, but they are so very small, and are only 
made of two little dust-bags and a seed-box. But 
the duckweed will float on the water. 

'' Now, Peter, I want to find a 'bog-bean ' in 
flower. I am afraid it is rather late in the year, 
but there are some, I know, at the shallow 
end of the pond You must look for a large 
spike of pink- white flowers, shaped something 
like wide blue-bells and lined with a number 
of white hairs. Ah ! here is one with the buds 
just opening ; it will be all right for Wednesday. 

" Now we must have one more. A little 
plant called the ' water-milfoil,' which is almost 
ill under water, except the spike of tiny pink 
flowers which stands straight up in the air. 
Look at its fine leaves arranged in stars round 
the stem. They lie out so well in the water. If 
you look very carefully at the flowers, you will 
see that the top ones have only dust-bags 
in them, and the lower ones only seed-boxes. 
But they are so small it is not easy to see this. 

" Now I must not choose any more, for I 
must describe each one on my show-card, and it 
will take a long time." 



When Wednesday came, Peggy's pan was ready. 
She had taken it to the pond, and dipped it 
gently under the duckweed. She brought it up 
quite full, and picked it over very carefully, 
leaving only the best plants. Then she carried 
it to the show-room. 

There she put the yellow lily into the middle 
of the pan, so that the flower, and the stalk with 
the seed-vessel, fitted into the hollow between 
the ears of the large green leaf just at the leaf- 
stalk. Next she put pieces of the water-crowfoot 
here and there, the pretty white blossoms streaked 
with yellow resting upon the top of the water. 

She stuck two spikes of bog-bean, with their 
leaves, one on each side of the water-lily. Lastly, 
she put spikes of the water-milfoil round the edge 
of the pan. Their leaves made little green stars 
in the water all the way round, and their tiny 
pink flower-spikes made a lovely edge. 

Then she wrote her card. This is what she 
said : 

1. The yellow water-lily grows in the pond 
near the farm. It has a thick stem rooted in the 
mud down at the bottom. I saw it once when 
they cleaned the pond. We see nothing on the 
top of the water in March. But in May the large 




shining green leaves have grown to the top of 
the water on long stalks. They are shaped rather 
like a heart, but are pointed at the tip. 

In June the buds 
come up. They are like 
green knobs tipped with 
yellow. But as they 
grow bigger, the five 
outer leaves, or sepals^ 
open, and they are 
quite yellow in- 
side. Then we can 
see the small inner 
flower - leaves, or 
petals, arranged in 
two rows ; after 
them come a num- 
ber of stamens, 
made of thin 
threads, with dust-bags 
on the top. TheL right 
in the middle is the 
seed-box, or ovary. It 
is shaped like a water-bottle 
with a round cushion on the 
top, and has a number of 
sticky points, which lie on the 
cushion in the shape of a star. w\ter-buttbbcdp, 
Little beetles are often foiind i™ <i^L^?;™ 



in the flowers. They fly m, and suck the 
honey at the back of the petals. 

2. The water-crowfoot grows 

in our pond. It is a kind oi 

buttercup. It has five outer 

green leaves, or sepals. They 

turn back against the stem 

when the flower is open. 

They often fall ofi". There are 

five white petals. They are 

streaked with yellow near the 

middle of the flower, where 

there are drops of honey. Aftei 

the petals, come many 

stamens, and then, in the 

middle of the flower, a 

number of seed-boxes, 

each with one seed 

inside. 

The water- crow- 
foot has two kinds 
of leaves. The 
leaves which float 
on the top of 
the water are 
flat and cut 









into three half 
rounds. The leaves under water are cut into 
threads and spread out on all sides. 



 

3. There is a great deal of duckweed in our 
pond. Each plant has one little root in the 
water and a kind of stem at the top. It has no 
leaves. The tiny flowers sometimes come out of 
a slit in the side of the stem. Each flower is 
nothing but two dust-spikes and a tiny seed-box. 

4. The bog-bean, or buck -bean, is nearly out 
of flower now. It grows at the edge of the pond, 
and its leaves are cut into three long parts. 
The pinkish flowers stand out on little stalks 
upon a tall stem. They are cup-shaped, with 
five points, and have a number of white hairs 
inside. 

5. The water-milfoil grows almost all under 
water. Only the small pink flowers stand in a 
spike out in the air. The flowers at the top of 
the spike have only stamens in them. Lower 
down some have both dust-bags and seed-boxes. 
The ones at the bottom have seed-boxes, or 
ovaries, only. Milfoil leaves are narrow, like 
grass, but quite short. They stand round the 
stem like the spokes of a wheel, or the rays oi 
a star. 

Peggy's water-nosegay and show-card won 
the prize. 



It is seven o'clock on a lovely summer morning. 
Jump up and look out of the window. It is a 
shame to be in bed when the sun is shining so 
brightly, and the birds are singing, and the bees 
are flying from flower to flower. 

Why are the bees at Avork so early ? They want 
to gather the yellow pollen-dust from the flowers, 
and the dew helps them to wet it, so that they can 
roll it up in little balls. Then they pack these balls 
into a groove in their hind legs, and fly away to 
the hive. There they mix it with honey, and make 
it into bee-bread to feed the young bees. 

See how busy that woodpecker is, under the elm 
tree. He is catching insects to carry home to his 
little ones, which have been hatched more than a 
week. Further away in the field is a thrush 
struggling with a big worm : I expect that he too 
is getting a breakfast for his family. 




How busy they all are, and you in bed! K 1 
were you I would get up and pull up some ^v^eeds in 
the garden. Then you will be of some use, and you 
can learn many interesting things, while you are at 
work. 

Here is a weed, growing among the cabbages. 
Do you know its name? It is called "The 
Shepherd's Purse" (see picture, p. 12) because of its 
curious seed-pods. These grow on stalks up the 
stem of the plant, below the little white floTvers. 
If you open one of them very carefully, you wiU 
find that there is a small bag on each side, which 
can be pulled away from the middle, when the 
pod is ripe, leaving the seeds hanging on a small 
division. 

So the pod is a kind of purse, ^vith two pockets, 
and we can pretend that the seeds are the shep- 
herd's money. 

Take hold of this plant, and I will tell you about 
its different parts. First look at the root. That 
always grows downwards into the ground. It has 
small rootlets growing out of it. The root and the 
rootlets all have tender tips, and they drink in the 
food of the plant out of the ground. 

You know that your father puts manure into 
the earth before he sows his seeds, or plants his 
fruit trees. Then the rain sinks into the earth and 
takes the juice out of the manure. This makes a 
rich drink for the roots to suck in, and so the plants 
grow strong. 

Next look at the stem. You can tell where it 
begins, for a tuft of leaves grows close to the 




ground. A root never has any leaves on it, so 
where the leaves grow must be the . stem. The 
place where the stem joins the root is often called 
the stock. 

Look carefully at this tuft of leaves. You will 
see that they do not grow exactly one above the 
other. The leaves in the upper row always grow^ 
just between the leaves of the lower row. And as 
the stem grows upwards, and the leaves are farther 
apart, they still grow so that they are not exactly 
one above the other. 

Why do you think they grow like this ? Because 
they want to get as much sun as they can. If they 
grew exactly one above the other, the upper leaf 
w^ould keep the sun away from the lower one. But 
now they get as much as there is to be had. 

You see then that a plant has a root which 
gro'^s doTvnwards to take in water out of the 
ground, and stems to grow upwards and carry the 
leaves up into the sunlight. What the leaves do 
we will learn in the next lesson. 




The leaves want a great deal of sunshine and air, 
for they are busy all day long, making food. Have 
you ever thought how wonderful it is that plants 
can make their own food ? You do not make your 
food, and no animals make their own food. AH 
you eat has once been either an animal or a plant. 




In a cake, for instance, the flour conies from grains 
of wheat, the currants from a Httle tree, the sugar 
from the sugar-cane, the spices come from trees, 
and the candied peel from fruits. 

The other things you eat are meat, fish, birds, 
vegetables, and fruits, and all these have once been 
alive. 

Plants do not feed like this. Their roots take in 
water out ot the earth, and other substances, such 
as lime, soda, and potash, dissolved in it. The 
leaves take in gases out of the air. But earth, 
air, and water are not living food. You or I could 
not live on them. The plant can. 

The pretty green leaves we love so much work 
very hard. When the sun shines upon them they 
can turn the water and gases into living food, and 
this food makes more leaves, flowers, and fruits 
which we eat. 

See how useful plants are ! If they did not make 
food, there could be nothing alive in the world. 
Insects feed on plants, and birds feed on insects. 
Sheep feed on grass, and we feed on sheep. Rabbits 
feed on plants, and foxes and weasels feed on 
rabbits. If there were no plants, there could be 
no insects, no birds, no animals, and no men alive. 

But this is not the only useful work which plants 
do. You know that if many people are shut up in 
a room, they use up the fresh air, and breathe back 
bad air, which is not fit to use again. Now plants 
want this foul air. They take it in through their 
leaves, and use a gas which is in it to help them 
t-o grow. So they not only turn gases into food 









for us to eat, but in doing this they use the bad 
air we send out of our mouths, and give it back 
to us fresh and pure. This is why it is so healthy 

to Kve in the country, wliere 
there are so many plants. 

You will find it very in- 
teresting to look at the leaves 
of plants, and notice their 
shapes, and how they are 
arranged on their stems so 
as to get light and air. 

I think you must know 
the common Dead- 
nettle, which is so 
like a stinging- 
nettle but does not 
sting. It grows in 
the hedges, and 
has a pretty purple 
or white flower 
slipped like a hood. 
J, Its leaves are ar- 

ranged in pairs all 
 up the stem, and 

each pair stands 
exactly across the 
pair below it, so as 
to let in plenty of 
light. 

The glossy green leaves ot the ivy on the wall 
(ie out flat, and have long stalks, so that they can 
stand out well into the air. 
B — in 





The leaves of the Nasturtiums in our gardens 
are shaped Hke a round shield. The leaf -stalk grows 
from under the middle of the leaf and is very long. 
So the leaf looks up straight to the sky, and gets 
plenty of light and air. 

The leaf of the Horse Chestnut tree is divided 
into leaflets, so that it looks as if it were made of 
five leaves, and each leaflet is spread out to the 
light. 

The leaves of the little Wood Sorrel, which 
children love to bite because it tastes sour, have 
three round leaflets like the Shamrock, and these 
leaflets droop down at night, or on a wet day, but 
Btand up wide open when the sun is shining. 

And now let us go back to our shepherd's purse. 
We have not yet looked for the flowers ; they grow 
on stalks which come out between the leaf-stalks 
and the stem. On these stalks there are some 
smaller leaves and a good many seed-pods. 

Above the seed-pods at the top of the stalk are 
some white flowers grooving close together. They 
are so small that you can scarcely see the parts. 
But you can make out that they have four outer 
green leaves and four white inner leaves. In the 
next lesson we will learn more about these. 

Gather six plants with different shaped leaves and notice 
how they grow upon the stem. 



The flowers of the Shepherd's Purse are very small 
so we will get the flowers of another plant to help 
us to learn about them. If you can find, in the 
garden, a turnip plant that has run to seed, you 
will see that it has flowers very like those of the 
Shepherd's Purse, only they are larger, and yellow 
instead of white. 

In both flowers there are four outer green 
leaves. These are called sepals. They form the 
cup or calyx of the flower. Then there are the 
four coloured leaves, which grow above the sepals. 
These are called petals. They make the crown or 
corolla of the flower. They are white in the 
Shepherd's Purse, and yellow in the Turnip flower. 
But in both flowers they stand in the form of a 
cross. 

Next come six thin threads with little knobs on 
the top. Two of them are short, and four are long. 
These are called stamens. The knobs are called 
inthers, they are the dust-bags which hold the 
yellow dust or pollen. Lastly, in the middle of the 
flower, is the seed-box or ovary. In the Shepherd's 
Purse the ovary is shaped like a heart, in the 
Turnip flower it is a long pod. 

The pods grow on little stalks down the stem 
They once had flower-leaves round them. But 
these have withered away, and the pods have 
grown large. 
 

Some of the best vegetables in your garden 
have flowers Kke these in the form of a cross, and 
with four long and two short stamens. Some, like 
the turnip and radish, have roots that are good to 
eat. In others, such as the cabbage and mustard- 
and-cress, we eat the leaves. In cauliflower and 
broccoli we eat the flowers. 

Now let us go back to our turnip. What a 
splendid round root it has ! You can find a kind of 
turnip growing wild in the lanes, but the root is 
hard — you would not like to eat it. Our turnips are 
good, l)ecause they have been grown in good 
ground, and had good food for hundreds of years, 
ind only the best seeds are sow^n. 

Now I daresay you think that, as we dig the 
ground and sow the seed, we ought to keep the 
turnip for ourselves. But there are a good many 
animals and insects wdiich want their share. As 
soon as the turnip seed has sent up its first green 
leaves, a little beetle is there, ready to eat them. 
When its wings are closed it is not much bigger 
than the letter O in the title of this lesson. It has 
long hind legs and can hop very far, so it is called 
the Turnip Flea-beetle. 

In the winter these beetles sleep under the clods 
of earth, or under dead leaves. W hen spring comes 
they wake up, and feed on the Shepherd's Purse, or 
some other weed, which conies up early in the year, 
riie mother fiea-beetle lays her eggs under the 
leaves, and very soon the tiny maggots come out, 
and eat tunnels in them. 

In a fortnight they are fat. Then they fall to 





rhe ground, and wrap themselves up in their cocoor 
skin, just as the baby ants did in the ant-hill. In 
another fortni<^ht they become little beetles. 



By that time the early turnips are just sending 
up their first leaves, and the flea-beetles will hop a 
long way to eat them. So, when you get up some 
morning, you may find the turnip bed very bare, 
ind if you have sharp eyes you may catch the little 
black shiny beetles which have done the mischief. 
A whole field of swedes or yellow turnips may be 
eaten down in this way. 

If you clear away all the weeds early in the year, 
and rake the ground, so that the young turnips 
grow quickly, you may keep the flea-beetle away. 
But then other creatures are wanting their share. 
The turnip-weevil will lay her egg in the root 
underground, as the nut-weevil did in the nut in 
the tree (see Book I.). If you pull up a turnip with 
little lumps or galls on it, you may know that a 
weevil maggot has been hatched inside. 

Then, when the large turnip leaves have grown, 
the pretty orange saw-fly Avill leave her eggs in 
them, so that the maggots eat them all away. 
Then the rabbit, if he can get in, will eat the tops, 
while the mice will nibble at the root. Lastly, if 
you grow turnips for seed, the pretty little green 
flower-beetle wants his share, and he eats the 
flower-buds. 

So you see the turnips feed many creatures 
besides the sheep and ourselves. A good gardener 
enjoys learning how to keep these garden thieves 
away. 

Bring the flowers of wallflower, stock, candytuft, penny- 
cress, turnip-flower, and shepherd's purse, and notice their 
likeness in the form and arran cement of their parts. 



We saw in the last two lessons that a plant has a 
root, stem, leaves, flowers, and seed-boxes. To-day 
I ^vant to tell you how these grow. 

If your teacher will let you make a little ex- 
periment, you can watch a plant j^ourself as it 
grows out of the seed. Get a savicer and a small 
piece of flannel. Put the flannel in the saucer, and 
pour water over it till it is quite wet. Then get 
someone to give you a pinch of mustard seed, and 
scatter it on the flannel. Put this on the window- 
sill, or on the table, and take care to keep the flannel 
wet. Then watch w hat happens. 

The second day after you have sown the seeds, 
you will find that they are swollen and soft. They 
have sucked up some water, and are using it to 
grow. On the third day many of the seeds will 
have sent out a tiny white root, which will cling 
to the flannel. 

The tip of the root will now suck in more water, 
and if you will open a seed you will find that it is 
splitting in half. Each of the two halves is going 
to be a leaf. But they are not green, they are 
still quite white, and you would not think that they 
were leaves. 

When you go to school on the fourth morning 
you may find these two halves out of their coat. 
Some of them are white, but some are Lurning 
green above and i)urple belo^v, and everyone 
would flow call them leaves. They grow up ou h 



stem, and the empty coat of the seed still hangs 
on the place where the stem and the root meet. 

Look well at the shape of these leaves, they are 
made of two rounds with a dent in the middle- 
They are the seed-leaves of the mustard plant. They 
have come out of the seed, and have used the food 
that was in it, to spread themselves out, and rise up 
into the sunlight. Now as the light pours do"\vn 
on them, they turn green, and can make their own 
food out of the water and gases, which the roots 
suck in. For the root has now many rootlets and 
root-hairs on it, as you w'll see if ycu will iDull one 
out of the flannel. 

In a few days a grejn tip shows between the 
two seed-leaves, and grows up, opening out into 
two more leaves. These again have a little bud 
growing between them, which spreads out into 
other leaves, and so the plant goes on getting 
larger. 

But the new leaves are quite different in shape 
from the seed-leaves. They are long, and are cut 
up into five leaflets, one large one at the tip, and 
two small ones on each side. 

What you have seen happen to the mustard 
seed on the flannel is just what happens to every 
seed you sow in the ground. First it swells, when 
the warm rain reaches it. Then it puts out a tiny 
root. The seed-leaves stretch themselves out, their 
stem grows, and they creep out of their coat, and 
find their way above ground. 

There they turn green in the sunlight, and 
begin to work up nourishing food. With this 








food tiiey make fresh stems and leaves, till they 
grow^ into big plants, or even trees. 

Another pretty experiment you can make is to 
soak a haricot bean in warm water, and put it on 
the top of some earth in a pot. Keep the earth 
moist and watch the bean, as you did the mustard 
seed. It will take longer to grow. It may be 





1. Soaked Seed. 2. Root appearing. 3. Arched Stem before the Seed-leaves 
rise up. 4. Seed-leaves open with shoots between. 5. Full-grown Bean- 
plant. 

nearly a week before the root finds its way into 
the earth, and another week before the big green 
seed-leaves break out of the seed-coat. 

It is very curious to ^vatch the root. First it 
sends out only one rootlet. Then several more 
grow out, till the bean looks like a big spider 
with long legs. The heavy bean still lies on t)i 


eartli, while the stem goes on growing. So the 
stem forms an arch, with the seed at one end, 
and the root at the other. At last the seed-leaves 
grow thinner as the plant uses the food in them, 
and the stem is strong enough to lift them, so 
that they stand up in the air. They do not leave 
the seed-coat down below, as the mustard seed 
did. They carry it up with them, and it dries and 
falls off at the top. Then you can see the new 
bud, between the seed-leaves, which soon opens 
out into real leaves. 

Grow mustard seed on damp flannel. Soak a haricot bean 
in warm water for one night, and then keep it on very damp 
earth in a flower-pot. 


We left our plants, at the end of the last lesson, 
growing green leaves in the sunlight. Now they go 
on very quickly. Their roots take in water from 
the ground, and the leaves take in gases from the 
air. 

When the plant has made plenty of roots, stems, 
and leaves, it begins to store up food for making 
flowers, in which new seeds will be formed. This is 
a very important work, for seeds are needed 
to grow up into new plants, and so many are 
destroyed by birds and insects or stifled by othei 
plants that, if there were not plenty, the plants 
ivould die out. 

So the seed-l)ox, or ovary, is very carefully 
protected. It grows right in the middle of the 





flower, where it can be closely wrapped up in the 
bud. Even when it grows below the flower, as in 

the honeysucltle, the 
sticky tip is always safe 
inside the bud. 

Gather a Primrose 
and Buttercup in the 
field, and a flower from 
the ro^v of Peas in the 
garden, and look for 
their seed-boxes. In the 
middle of the butter- 
cup flow^er you will find a great number, shaped 
like pears standing up.ido down, with their stalks 
upwards, and in each of these seed-boxes there 
is the beginning of 
a little seed. 

You will have to 
pull the yellow 
crown off the Prim- 
rose before you can 
see the little round 
seed-box sitting in 
the green cup. It 
has a tube growing 
out of it Avith a 
round knob on the 
top. 

In the Pea-flower 
you will find one 
single pod inside 
the flower-leaves, and it has a 




tip. When you open the pod yor will see seven 
or eight white balls inside it, which are the baby 
peas. If you can cut open the seed-box of the 
primrose, you will find the same kind of balls, but 
very small indeed. These balls are soft and trans- 
parent. You can crush them with your fingers 
easily. They are not yet real seeds, but only bags 
of juice, called " ovules." Before they can grow 
into hard seeds, they must use some of the yellow 
grains out of the dust-bags which grow round 
chem. 

This is why the seed-boxes have tips, and beaks 
and knobs. The tip of the buttercup pods, the beak 
at the end of the pea-pod, and the knob at the top 
of the primrose-tube, are all sticky. The yellow 
grains stick to them liKe flies on fly-paper. Tnen 
the grains burst and send some juice down to the 
ovules in the seed-box, and turn them into real 
hard seeds. 

As you go home pick any flower you gee, and 
'-.ry to find its seed-box. You may perhaps pick 
a Poppy in the cornfield. That iias a fine large 
seed-box, like a covered cup, with holes under the 
cover. When the seed-box is ripe, and hangs down 
its head, the seeds fall out at the holes. There are 
so many you could not count them. 

You may pick a Violet, and when you have 
taken off the coloured leaves, you will find a very 
curious seed-box. For the tube, and the sticky 
knob at the top, are just like a bird's neck and 
head. The dust-bags which fit close round the 
seed-box are a lovely orange colour. 




If you can find a pretty purple flower called the 
Marsh Mallow, you will see that the seed-box is like 
a round flat cheese, with a long tube standing up 
in the middle. This tube has eight or twelve red 
sticky points ; there are a great many yellow 
stamens round it. Country 
children often call the 
seed-boxes of the mallow 
"cheeses," ^vhen they are 
ripe and the long tube has 
fallen ofl^. 

But very likely you maj 
pick a Daisy or a Dande- 
lion. Then you will be 
puzzled, for you will not 
find a seed-box in the 
middle. This is because a 
daisy or a dandelion is not 
one flower, but a great 
many flowers crowded to- 
gether in one head. 

Take a dandelion flower- 
head to pieces, and you will 
find that each tiny flower 
will come away from the 
rest. There are more than 

a hundred in one dandelion head. Take one of 
these florets in your hand and have a look at it. 

At the bottom there is an oval bag, that is the 
seed-box. On the top of it there are some fine hairs, 
these are the sepals. Then there is the yellow 
crown with a long strap to it. Inside the crown 




come the stamens, with very long dust-bags, whicb 
cling round the tube. On the top of the tube stand 
two yellow sticky horns. 

So you see this tiny thing is a whole flower, 
growing with its companions on the dandelion 
nead. The daisy is the same, with some little 
differences. See if you can make that out for your- 
self. 

Find the seed-boxes of the pea, wallflowers, shepherd's 
purse, buttercup, primrose, poppy, marsh-mallow, and dande- 
lion. 


As soon as the sun begins to warm the earth you 
may look out for spring flowers. If j^ou have any 
damp ditches near you, you may find in March the 
Marsh Marigold in flower (picture, p. 82). This is 
a plant with hollow stems and dark green leaves 
shaped like a heart, and notched round the edge. 
It has large bright yellow flowers, which children 
often call "king-cups." 

The yellow cuj^ has only one set ot flower-leaves, 
and inside it there are a great many dust-bags and 
yeed-boxes. If you take off one of these seed-boxes 
and look on each side, yovi will find a little hollow 
with some honey in it. 

The bees are very eager to get this honey, as 
it is so early in the year that there are very few 
plants in flower. They want too some of the 
pollen dust to make bee-bread for the baby-beea 

 

The early flies too are in search of food. If you 
watch a bed of king-cups on a sunny day, you will 
see a number of bees and flies settling on the 
flowers. 

They fly from flower to flower sipping a drop in 
each, and as they rub against the dust-bags, they 
carry the pollen-grains with them. 

We saw in the last lesson that plants cannot 
Lnake seeds unless the pollen grows downwards 
into the seed-box, and we find by experiments that 
they make better seeds when the pollen - grains 
come from another flo^ver. So the bees do the 
flowers good, by carrying the pollen, in return for 
the honey that the plants give to them. 

You are sure to find somewhere in the lanes in 
March a pretty little yellow flower like a star, with 
shining heart-shaped green leaves. It is the Lesser 
Celandine, and has a cup of five green sepals, and a 
crown of eight or ten yellow petals. Flies and bees 
come to it in numbers, for it has a drop of honey at 
the thin end of each petal, in the middle of the 
crown. 

If you dig up a bit of this plant, you will find 
some white lumps growing among the roots. Each 
of these has a small bud at the top, and will groAV 
into a plant if you put it into the ground. 

Another flower already out in the fields is the 
common yellow Coltsfoot, a very tiresome weed to 
the farmers. It has a long creeping stem, and 
spreads very quickly underground. It has a flower- 
head, like the dandelion, made of luiudreds of tiny 
flowers. This head grows on a flully stem which 





is covered with pink scales. The leaves do not 
grow till after the flowers are over. 

Look carefully at the flower-head. You wiU 
find about forty tiny round flowers in the middle. 
They have dust-bags in them, and a large drop of 
honey. Round these stand about three hundred 
little flowers, each with a long yellow strap, and 
inside each of these outer flowers is a seed-box 
with two sticky horns. The bees and flies creep 
over these outer florets to suck the honey from 
the flowers in the middle, and on their way back 
they bring some pollen and leave it on the sticky 
horns. 

And now, if you can find in the hedges the 
Cuckoo-pint or Arum I will show you a real trap 
for insects. It is a plant with a green pointed 
hood, and a purple club sticking up in the middle. 
We used to call it "Lords and Ladies," but many 
children call it " Parson-in-the-pulpit." In spring 
this plant has a very strong smell. When the 
flies smell it, they crawl down the purple club to 
look for honey. 

On their way they pass a row of stiff hairs 
(1, p. 33) which bend down with their weight and 
let them pass. Then they come to a ring of red 
dust-bags (2) which are not yet open. Next they 
pass some useless seed-boxes (3) and reach at last 
the true seed-boxes (4) with sticky points. 

Now they have come to the bottom, and they 
look for some honey. Alas! There is none thera 
Then they try to get back. But the stiff hairs 
will not bend upwards, and they are prisoners. 





They are shut in for a day or two, and then the 

sticky points of 

the seed-boxes 

wither, and each 

gives out a drop 

of honey. So the 

flies have not 

been cheated. At 

the same time 

the dust-bags 

burst, and the 

pollen dust falls 

on the flies. Then 

the stamens and 

the hairs wither 

away and the 

flies can get out 

again. 

As they pass 
the withered 
dust-bags, they 
brush off any 
pollen - grains 
which remain, 
and have plenty 
on their backs 
to carry to 
another flower- 
trap. 

You can see 
this for yourself 
if you will look 
V — ni 





for the Parson-in-the-pulpit, and chose two plants, 
one young one with the dust-bags full, and one 
old one in which they are withered. 

Look for marsh marigold, lesser celandine, coltsfoot, and 
arum or cuckoo-pint. 



When the seed-boxes of plants are ripe we call 
them " fruits." I daresay it seems strange to you 
to call a pea-pod a fruit. But if you think of all 
the other fruits you know, you will find that they 
are all seed-boxes. 

The apple is the seed-box of the apple-blossom. 
The gooseberry holds the seed of the gooseberry 
plant. The nut is the fruit of the nut-tree. The 
acorn is the fruit of the oak. 

In peas and broad beans we eat the seeds out of 
the fruit. But in French beans and scarlet-runners 
we eat the whole fruit, seed-box as well as seeds. 
If you walk round a kitchen garden I think you 
can find one, and perhaps two, vegetables of which 
we eat the whole fruit. 

In most gardens there is some corner where the 
dead leaves and rubbish are heaped up to make 
a hot-bed. Earth is thrown over the heap, and 
cucumbers and vegetable marrows are grown 
there. You will see at once that cucumbers and 
marrows are fleshy seed-boxes, for tbev are full of 
seeds. 




Have you ever looked at the flowers of the 
Vegetable Marrow? They are as large and beau- 
tiful as many garden flowers. I want you to notice 
something curiovis in them. 

If you look at several flowers you will see that 
they are not all alike. They all have a pale green 
cup, with five long points, and a grand yellow 
crown. But some, which are very big, have the 
beginning of a 
young marrow 
just under the 
green cup 
while others, 
which are 
smaller, have 
nothing but 
the stem under 
the cup. In a 
few days the 
young mar- 
row will have 
grown bigger. 
But the flow- 
ers which have no marrows under tlum will be 
fading away. 

Look inside the fading flowers. You will see 
some curious twisted pouches full of yellow pollen- 
dust, but you will not find a sticky knob in the 
middle. Then look at the big flower at the top 
of the young marrow. Inside that flower you will 
find some sticky lumps, and most likely some 
yellow dust on them. So you will know that 



these lumps are the top of the seed-box. But 
you will not find any dust-bags in this flower. 

So you see that the vegetable marrow has its 
dust-bags in one flower and its seed-box in another. 
How can the yellow grains get from one flower to 
the other to make the seeds grow ? 

Here the insects help. We found them trouble- 
some when they spoilt the turnips, but now they 
are going to be useful. 

Inside each marrow flower there are some juic^' 
folds, which the bees and flies love to nibble, to 
get the sweet juice. When they press into the 
flower to bite the folds they rub against the 
pouches and carry off some yellow grains on their 
backs. Then they go into the bigger flower to 
bite the folds, and pass the sticky lumps on their 
way. The yellow grains stick on to the lumps, 
and so the ovules of the marrow get the pollen-food 
and are able to grow into seeds. 

The Cucumber flowers are of two kinds, like 
those of the marrow. Perhaps now^ you can guess 
why the gardener is careful to open his frames 
every day. He must not only let in the fresh air. 
He must also give the insects a chance to fly in tc 
the flowers. For if they did not come, there would 
be no one to carry the pollen from one flower to the 
other. Some gardeners pick off a flower with dust- 
bags, and rub it against the sticky lumps of the 
large flower, and so do the same work as the 
insects. 

Pumpkins, melons, and gourds have two kinds of 
flowers like the cucumber and marrow. 






There is one more fruit AV'hieli we eat as a 
vegetable, but I am not sure if you will have 
it in your garden. It is the beautiful tomato, 
vvhich looks like a deep red apple. If you hav€ 
not got it 5'ou should tr}^ to grow it. Cottagers 
often grow it in Devonshire, even when they have 
only a sandy path to plant it in. 

Sow the seeds in a box in February, put a 
piece of glass over it, and keep it in the kitchen 
where it is warm. Then when the little jilants 
have two or three leaves on them, put each plant 
in a small pot with some very sandy earth. 

Keep the plants well watered, and in May put 
the pots outside the house in a warm corner. As 
soon as they are a little hardened you may scoop 
a deep hole in the bed, or path, under a sunny 
wall. Fill it with manure and earth, and put the 
plants in out of the pots. They will grow against 
the wall and give you fine tomatoes. Only you 
must be careful to keep off the slugs and snails, 
for they love the sweet tomato juice as much as 
we do. 

When the fruits are big, if the weather is i\v.\ 
warm enough for them to ripen out of doors, you 
may pick them and put them on the kitchen 
shelves and they will turn red and be fit to 
eat. 

Bring the two kinds of flowers which grow on the vegetable 
man-ow plant— also those of the cucumber. Bring in the fruit 
of a marrow, a cucumber, and a tomato. 



When the spring flowers are beginning to peep out 
in the fields, your father will be hard at work in the 
garden. In March, if not before, neat seed beds of 
cabbage, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and cauliflo^wer 
will have to be sown, for planting out by-and-by. 
Early turnips must now be sown in their rows, 
and radishes and mustard and cress may be grown 
for salad. 

All these belong to the family which have 
flowers in the form of a cross. So you see this is a 
very useful family to gardeners. It gives us, besides 
the lovely wallflower, the purple stock and the 
sweet alyssum in our flower garden, as well as the 
watercress in the brooks. 

But as soon as our cabbage plants begin to grow, 
we find that the insects, vi^hich are so useful in help- 
ing to make seeds, can do harm in a kitchen garden. 
Early in May, before the plants are very large, you 
will see the white cabbage butterfly with two black 
spots on her wings, flitting about the garden. (Sec 
p. S.) 

Where do you think she has come from? All 
the winter her body has been covered with a hard 
gum, which spread over it when she wriggled out 
of her caterpillar skin, and fastened herself by 
?silken threads to the stem of an old cabbage stalk» 
or hid perhaps in a crack in the palings. 

Now that the sun is warm she has come out to 
lay her eggs. She does not feed on cabbages her- 
self, she sips honey from the floweps. But slie fed 



on leaves when she was a caterpillar, so she lays her 
eggs under a cabbage leaf, where the caterpillars 
will find food when they are hatched. 

The Tortoiseshell Butterfly, out in the fields, layt 
her eggs on stinging nettles, because her cater- 
pillars feed on nettle leaves. They weave a little 
tent under the leaves to come back to at night, and 
there you may find them. 

But if you want to save your cabbages from 
being eaten by caterpillars, you must look for the 
eggs of the white cabbage butterfly under the 
cabbage leaves. They are very tiny, but in a 
fortnight they will hatch out into little green 
caterpillars with black spots, and a yellow line 
down their backs. 

They eat and eat for about a month, and then 
about July or August they creep away to some tree 
or paling, and bind themselves there by their silken 
thread till next spring. Then each Lutterfly como^^ 
out to lay her eggs on fresh cabbages. 

il: you search very carefully all about your 
garden and in the shed, and along the palings in 
the winter, you may find and destroy the chrysalis 
and help to save your cabbages from the cater- 
pillars. 

But if you see some little white balls, about the 
size of a hemp-seed, lying near a dead caterpillar, 
take care not to destroy them. They are the 
cocoons of a little fly, which lays her egg in the 
body of the caterpillar of the white cabbage butter- 
fly, and when the egg is hatched the grub feeds 
upon the inside of the caterpillar. 





Is it not a curious history ? The butterfly sucks 
honey from the flowers, and carries their pollen- 
dust for them. Then she lays her eggs under a 
cabbage leaf and dies. The caterpillar feeds on 
the cabbage, and then perhaps a little fly comes, 
and lays her e^^ in him ; and the grub feeds on 
him, so that "when the time comes for him to turn 
into a butterfly he dies instead. 

Many other creatures feed on our cabbage. 
Slugs and snails like green meat, and the gall 
?weevil, which we saw feeding on the turnip, likes 
cabbage root as well. The best way to keep all 
enemies away is to make the ground clean and 
free from weeds, and to pick off all the insects 
you find. 

Find any Crucifers (flowers formed in a cross) you can — 
wallflower, candytuft, stock, charlock, turnip, and any cab- 
bage plant which is run to seed. Try to find the chrysalis 
of the cabbage butterfly. 





In May the hedgerows will be full of flowers. I 
have not room to describe them all to you. You 
should pick one of each, on your way to school, and 
ask your teacher about them. On the tops of the. 
banks, and nestling in the wood, you "will find the 
wild hyacmths, which children call bluebells, and 
the red ragged-robin, and the lovely starworts or 
stitchw^orts with flowers like pure white stars and 
narrow pointed leaves. Children call these " snap- 




Jacks," because the seed-box, when it is ripe, snaps 
if you pinch it. There are many kinds of star- 
worts. One of them with small floAvers is called 
chickweed. 

The meadows are now golden with buttercvips, 
and the ditches are blue with forget-me-nots, and 
you can find the little blue Sj)eedwell or Bird's-eye 
almost anywhere. It is a weed, with thin weak 
stalks, and you may know it by its four blue petals, 
and its two stamens standing out like horns. Be- 
fore long the tall Meadow-sweet, with its clusters 
of tiny white flowers, will be blooming by the side 
of the streams and in damp j)laces ; and the pretty 
little Bird's-foot Trefoil will brighten the hedgerows 
and fields. 

You will know this little flower well. It grows 
quite low down, and is like a very small yellow 
pea-flower. About four or five little blossoms grow 
on tb.e top of each flower-stalk, and the buds have 
bright red streaks upon them. When the pods are 
ripe they stand out like the toes of a bird's foot. 

These, and many other flowers, you can find in 
the fields and hedges and you know now how to 
look for their seed-boxes and dust-bags; and I am 
sure you will watch to see what flies and bees and 
beetles come to fetch honey and pollen-dust. 

If you do this and keep your eyes open, you will 
find out that other creatures come to the i)lants and 
flowers, which are not as useful to them as the bees. 
There is the cow, which takes large mouthfuls of 
their leaves as she grazes. There is the donkey, 
which feeds on the thistles. There is the rabbit, 





which conies out in the evening., to nibble at the 
tender young shoots ; and there are the little field- 
mice, w^hich scrape away the earth and feed on 
the thick stems and roots underground. 

Now let me tell you of a few plants which 
protect themselves, and perhaps you can find more. 
First come the Anemone and the meadow Butter- 
cup. Both these have bitter leaves which burn your 
tongue w^hen you bite them. If you walk across 
a field which has many buttercups in it you will 
find that the cows and the sheep have left them 
alone as much as they can. If they eat the leaves, 
they will not touch the flowers, which are much the 
most acrid. So these plants prevent the cows from 
killing them. In the same Avay the leaves of wild 
geraniums have a disagreeable taste and smell. 

Then there are the Ferns. They have a great deal 
of bitter tannin in them. You will find that if cows 
or sheep have been feeding where the Bracken fern 
is grow^ing, they will not have touched it. So the 
ferns keep themselves safe. 

Then the little Wood-sorrel tastes acid, and the 
Speedwells dry up the inside of your mouth if you 
eat their leaves. So these plants are left alone. 
Lastly the Parson-in-the-pulpit has such poisonous 
berries, leaves, and underground stems, that no 
animal will eat it above ground, and no sensible 
field-mouse would think of nibbling at it under- 
ground. 

Then there are the plants which grow thorns on 
their stems. Cows and horses do not like to eat 
gorse for it hurts their tender mouths. These 



Plants want bees and flies to visit their flowers, 
because they carry their pollen from flower to 
flower. But other insects, such as ants and spiders, 
like honey too, and they only crawl ; they rub ofC 
any dust which falls on them before they reach 
another flower. So they rob the flowers of their 
honey and do nothing in return. 

How do you think the plants protect them- 
selves? In many difl'erent ways. The Teasel has 
a large flower-head full of honey. But the ants 
cannot steal it because its leaves grow opposite to 
each other on the stem, and join round it so that 
they make a little basin. The dew and the rain 
collect in the basin, and stop the ants from creep- 
ing past. 

Then the piants we call Campions, of which the 
ragged-robin is one (p. 45), often have their flower 
stems covered with flne hairs, and the stem near 
the flower is very sticky. When the ants climb up 
to try to steal the honey they stick fast, and can 
get no further. This is why some of the campions 
ire often called " catch-flies." 

A very common plant in the hedges is the Sun- 
spurge (p. 45), which has curious small green 
flowers. This plant has a poisonous milky juice 
in its stem. When the ants try to climb up, they 
prick holes with their claws, and stick fast and die. 

I wish I could tell j^ou more of the way in which 
plants protect themselves by jjrickles, by hairs, and 
by poisons, but you must look for yourselves. 

Bring in sun-spurge, campion or catch-fly, wood-sorrel, 
bracken teasel, and wild geranium. 




Now you know how wild plants grow, how insects 
halp to make the seeds, and how plants have to 
defend themselves from enemies which would eat 
their leaves or steal their honey. 

Next let us look at the flow^ers in our gardens 
and see how far they are like the wild ones in the 
fields. All garden plants grow wild in some part 
of the world. We have taken them into our 
gardens, and made their flowers larger and 
brighter. Some still live wild in England, others 
have been brought from foreign countries. 

The forget-me-nots in the garden border are 
very much the same as those we find in the lanes. 
The snowdrop has run wild in many parts of Eng- 
land. The lovely blue periwinkle, with its dark 
shiny leaves, grows in every Devonshire lane. The 
large ox-eye daisies which gro^v in our gardens are 
the same as those in the cornfields. The honey- 
suckle is as fine in the hedges as on the trellis-work 
of the porch. 

But the large purple clematis and the beau- 
tiful yellow and white chrysanthemums, which 
gro^v^ in so many cottage gardens, come from 
abroad. I knew an old woman once who called 
them "Christmas anthems." I think she imagined 
that they flowered late in the year on purpose for 
Christmas. 

The lovely yellow and purple pansies, which 





bloom all the summer, seem at first too grand to 
have come from wild ones. But you can gather 
small wild pansies in the lanes, and if you look 
inside the flower of the garden pansy you will see 

the curious bird's head 
on the top of its seed- 
box which w^e found 
in the violet. So the 
pansy, or Heartsease, 
is a true English 
plant. 

I am sure you have 
some of the yellow 
and bro^vn polyanthus 
in your garden. At 
first you will think 
there is nothing like 
it in the fields. But if 
you gather a cowslip 
and compare it with 
the polyanthus, you 
will find that all their 
parts are alike. For 
the polyanthus was 
once wild like the 
cowslip, and the gardeners have manured it, and 
chosen out the best seeds, till they have given it 
the bright colours it has now. 

The reason that garden flowers are often larger 
and more beautiful in their colours than wild 
flowers is because the plants are not obliged to 
take so much pains to live nor to make so many 



 

seeds. The gardener puts tliem in good ground, 
feeds them well, and picks out the seeds of the 
best flowers to sow next year. 

You can do the same if you try, and though you 
pannot do much in a few years you will get much 
finer flowers for your trouble. You must watch the 
plant and pick off all the withered leaves, and keep 
the ground raked, well manured, and free from 
weeds. Then you must settle which of the plants 
have the best and brightest flowers. Tie a little 
piece of cotton round the stem of these flowers, 
and watch when their seed-boxes are ripe, then 
keep those seeds to sow next year. In two or 
three years you will have much better flowers. 

The pinks and carnations are some of the 
prettiest and sweetest of our garden flowers. 
They belong to an English family, called the Pink 
Family. You may perhaps not have any wild pinks 
in your part of the country. But you will have the 
ragged robin and the campion, and these belong to 
the same family. 

If you compare their flowers with the pink, you 
will find that they both have narrow leaves grow- 
ing opposite each other. The stem is swollen at 
the joint where they grow. They both have a long 
green cup with points, and five pink or white petals, 
ragged at the edge. Ten stamens grow inside on 
the top of the stem, and there is a tall seed-box in 
the middle, with two or three sticky horns. 

Now try to find a ripe seed-box. It will be 
open at the top and its points bend out like the top 
of a vase. Inside is a little upright pillar with the 



seeds growing round it. When you find all this in 
a flower you will know that it belongs to the Pink 
Family. 

Chickweed, starwort, campion, soapwort, ragged 
robin, and wild pink can all be found in the lanes. 

But no doubt you have in your garden some 
double flowers — pinks, wallflowers, stocks, and roses. 
These have a great many coloured petals, and 
hardly any dust-bags or seed-box, sometimes none 
at all. Gardeners have made these double flowers 
by growing the j)lants in very rich earth, and 
sowing the seeds of those which grew the most 
flower-leaves instead of stamens. 

Plants in the fields hardly ever have double 
flowers. They must make plenty of seeds. If you 
turn a plant with double flowers out into poor 
grovmd and let it run wild, it will go back to single 
flowers. But gardeners want fine blooms. So they 
grow double hollyhocks, dahlias, peonies, and prmi- 
roses, as well as single ones. 

Compare wild and garden rose, wild and garden pansy, 
cowslip and polyanthus, pink and ragged robin. 



In June the dog-roses are in bloom. They look very 
pretty thrusting their pink and white flowers out 
of the hedge. Though they have thorns, you can 
manage to cut a branch and take it to school. We 
will learn to-day about the rose family. 

I shall want you to bring a good many flowers 




and fruits from the hedges and the garden, besides 
the rose. You remember that some of our best 
vegetables come from the flowers shaped hke a cross. 
Now you will see that some of our best fruits come 
from the Rose Family. (See frontispiece.) 

So bring from the hedges a branch of wild rose. 
It must be ^"ild, for you remember our garden roses 
have turned most of their stamens into flower- 
leaves. Next get if you can a piece of bramble with 
a blackberry flower on it. Then from the bank 
below bring a wild strawberry plant. Get one if 
you can with a ripe strawberry hanging on it, as 
well as the flower. For there is another plant 
called the potentilla which is so like the wild straw- 
berry that you might bring it by mistake, unless 
you saw the little strawberry fruit. 

Then bring from your garden a straw^berry, f 
raspberry, a cherry, and a plum, a green apple and 
a pear. What a number we shall have ! And yel 
you might bring a peach, a medlar, a quince, a 
nectarine, and an apricot as well, for all these fruits 
belong to the Rose Family. Only I expect you will 
not have them in your garden. 

First let us look at the flowers. You will see 
that the Wild Rose has a very deep cup, with five 
green sepals, which stick out in long points. (See 
p. 47.) 

If it is a dog-rose its crown will be made of five 
lovely pink petals. They are all separate, so that 
you can pull each one off the green cup, without 
disturbing the others. If you pull them all off, you 
will find that there are a great many dust-bags 
gro"^dng on the rim of the green cup. 





No\v look for the seed-boxes. Their sticky tops 
are peeping out of the cup. But you will have to 
tear the cup open to find them inside. Then you 
will see that they are all separate and that each 
one has a sticky top of its own. 

Now look at the Strawberry flower: it too has 
five green sepals and five white petals, and a great 
many dust-bags, just like the rose. But it has no 
deep cup. Its seed-boxes grow on a little mound 
inside the sepals. By-and-by this mound ^\all 
swell and grow soft and juicy and sweet, and the 
tiny seed-boxes will be buried in it, like pins in a 
pincushion. Look at the little fruit of the wild 
strawberry and the big fruit of the garden straw- 
berry and you will see this. People often call these 
dry pips " seeds," but they are not seeds, they are 
tiny seed-boxes, each with one seed inside. 

Now look at the Blackberry flower. It is just 
like the strawberry, and its seed-boxes grow on a 
mound. But when the fruit is ripe, you will find 
that the mound is no bigger. In the blackberry, 
the seed-boxes themselves grow soft, and become 
small balls full of sweet juice. You can separate 
them one from another, and you will find a seed 
inside each. 

The Raspberry is like the blackberry, only the 
little red juicy seed-boxes shrink away from the 
mound. So you can pull them off like a cap, 
leaving the white pointed mound behind. 

And now how about the other fruits ? Next 
spring Av hen the Plum trees and Cherry trees are 
in bloom, you will find that they have the same 




kind of flowers as the rose. But they have only 
one seed-box to each flower. This seed-box groAvs 
juicy outside, and leaves a very hard shell inside, 
round the seed. So you have to eat the juicy 
covering and crack ths 
hard shell before you can 
get at the kernel or 
seed. 

The Apple and the 
Pear will puzzle you, till 
you cut an apple across. 
Then you will see the 
five Httle seed-boxes ar- 
ranged like a star in 
the middle of the fruit. 
Each seed-box will have 
one or two pips or seeds 
in it, and the boxes are 
what we call the core of 
the apple. The green cup 
has grown thick and 
fleshy all round them. 
You can see the dried 
tips of the green sepals 
on the top of the apple. 
In the apple blossom the 
seed-boxes are separate, 
till the cup grows round them, and makes one big 
apple. 

Bring a wild rose, a piece of blackberry in flower, a wild 
strawben-y in flower, an apple, near, plum, cherry, raspberry, 
and g iden strawberry. 




 

When a bee goes in search of honey, there is one 
plant she is very glad to find. This is the Dead- 
nettle. She does not mind whether it has white 
or purple flowers. She knows that unless some 
other bee has been there before 
her she will find some honey. 

There are generally plenty of 
dead-nettles to be found, for their 
leaves do not taste nice, and they 
look so like stinging-nettles that 
very few animals will eat them. 

The real nettle has only small 
green flowers, while the dead- 
nettle has clusters of red or ^vhite 
blossoms growing all round the 
stem, just above each pair of 
leaves. These flowers are shaped 
like helmets, and they have a 
broad lip hanging down in front, which has a 
deep notch in the middle. 

The stem of the plant is not round, like the 
stems of most i3lants. It is square with four sides. 
By this you may always know it from a sting- 
ing-nettle, even when it is not in flower. The 
coarse leaves grow opposite to each other, and 
each pair grows across the one below it, as we saw 
in Lesson II. 

Now let us look at the flower. You had better 




take a white dead-nettle, as the flowers are k^rt^e. 
Take hokl of the hehnet and pull it very gently. It 
will come off, leaving the green cup with its five 
points. But most likely you will have hrought 
away the long tube w' itli sticky horns, which grows 
out of the seed-box, for 
it comes off very easily. 

If you have, try an- 
other flower, and tear 
the helmet open very 
carefully. Then you 
will see that at the 
bottom of the cup there 
are four little seed- 
boxes, like nuts, with 
a long tube standing 
right up in the middle 
of them. It has two 
sticky horns. 

Now look inside an- 
other flower. You will 
find four stamens grow- 
ing on the cro^vn, and 
two of them are so long that they reach right up 
into the hood. Before you pulled the hood off the 
sticky horns w^ere close to them. At the bottom 
of the tube there is plenty of honey, but creeping 
insects cannot get it, for there is a thick fringe of 
hairs in the tube to keep them away. 

But when the bee comes for honey, she pushes 
her trunk through the hairs, and as she sucks she 
brushes the dust out of the bags. Then she goes 





to another flower and leaves it on the sticky 
horns. There are a great many flowers with lips 
like the dead-nettle. Mint, Sage, Balm, Thyme, 
Pepx^ermint, Lavender, Rosemary, and the pretty 
blue and white bugle flowers in the hedges are all 
lipped— you wall know them by their square stems, 

opposite leaves, and the 
four little seed-boxes. 

In Sage plants the 
anthers swing on a bar. 
The bee hits her head 
against the lower end, 

 which Is empty, and the 

 full dust-bag COmeS down 



on her back. 

Another flower which the bee loves is the Pea, 
There again she is sure to find honey. In the 
kitchen garden on a fine morning you will see the 
bees buzzing along the rows of peas and beans, and 
only stopping to poke their heads into the flowers. 

Get a pea-flower and let us see how they do it. 
Hold the flower facing you. At the back is one 
large petal, with a deep dent in the middle. This 
stands up like a flag to tell the bee where to come 
for honey. So it is called the " standard." Two 
smaller petals are folded together, just below it. 
These are called "wings." Between these wangs are 
two more petals, which are joined together like the 
end of a boat. These are called the " keel." 

If you take hold of the wings, and pull them 
gently down, you will find they bring the keel witu 
them. Then you will see the dust-bags of ten 





stamens and the sticky beak of the tiny pea-pod 
These Tvere hidden before in the keel. 

If you pick the flower to pieces, you will see why 
Ihe keel came down. Inside each wing there is a 
knob, which fits into a hollow in the side of the 
keel. Is not this curious ? When the bee settles on 
the wings, she presses them down with her weight. 
They press down the keel, and the dust-bags knock 
against the breast of the bee. So she goes away to 
the next flower covered with pollen-dust. 

There are almost as many flowers like the pea 
as there are like the dead-nettle. The beautiful 
3^ellow Gorse, the little Trefoil, and all the Vetches 
in the hedges belong to this family. So do the 
sweet Clovers which we grow for clover hay. Each 
head of clover is a cluster of tiny flowers shaped 
like a pea. 

Then in the flower garden ^ve have the Laburnum, 
and in the kitchen garden the Scarlet-runners and 
the Broad Beans. 

Examine a dead-nettle, mint, thyme, and meadow-sage. 
Notice the cuiious swinging anther of the meadow-sage. Also 
a pea blossom, gorse blossom, tare, and bird's-foot trefoil. 



When you were picking the flowers of the peas and 
scarlet-runners, if you kept your eyes open, you must 
have noticed that they climb up the sticks which we 
put for them. But I daresay you did not ask your- 
self why theyclimb, nor how they climb. 







You know that if you took the sticks away they 
would fall in a tangled mass on the ground. For 
peas and scarlet-runners have thin weak steins. 
They could not get enough light and air all tumbled 

together on the 
ground. They 

would be stifled 
under other plants 
So they have learnt 
to climb up on a 
hedge or sticks, or 
anything they can 
find, to lift them 
towards the sky. 

That is why 
they climb, now let 
us see how they 
do it. For they do 
not both set to 
work in the same 
way. 

You will find 
on the pea-plant 
that in many places 
where a leaf ought 
to be, there is a 
little curled green 
thread, which clings round the twig of the stick, 
just as a baby clings to its mother's finger. We 
call these threads " tendrils." They hold the plant 
up to the light and air, and let the blossoms hang 
out where the bees can find them. The scarlet 






runners do their climbing differently. They do 
not use their loaves, but twine their whole 

stem round the 
sticks. 

If you look 
along the hedges 
you will find 
many climbing 
plants, which 
manage to use 
the thick 
bushes as a 




sort of bank on which to spread out their leaves 
and flowers. There is the Clematis, or Traveller's 
Joy. It has not turned its leaves into tendrils, 




nor twined its stem. It twists the stalk of the 
leaves tightly round the twigs, so that the leaves 
stand out at the end. Its pretty greenish flowers 
are spread in this way all over the top of the 
hedge, and by-and-by the feathery seed-boxes will 
hang like an old man's beard, just where the wind 
can catch them to blow them away. 

I think you must know the Goose-grass or 
Cleavers, which grows over everything in the lanes 
Its narrow green leaves are arranged round the 
stem like a star, and it has very tiny white flowers. 
The stem, leaves and seed-boxes are all crowded 
with tiny hooks so that it clings to your hand 
when you gather it. It is really a very weak 
plant, but it clings to other plants which are 
stronger, and so raises itself up. 

The blackberry and other brambles climb in 
the same way, and the wild rose climbs by its 
thorns. Further along the hedgerow the wild Hop 
may be growing. Its stems die down every year 
and grow up again in the spring. Yet it manages 
to spread a long way, for its stem twines round 
twigs and small trees, and everything it can find, 
spreading out its broad leaves shaped like a heart. 
You will find the flowers of the hop rather puzzling, 
for its dust-bags and seed-boxes grow on different 
2)lants. 

The Honeysuckle, too, twines its stem, as you 
must have seen on the porch or the paling. Some- 
times when it twines round a young branch, it 
winds itself so tightly that the branch cannot grow 
in the places where the honevsuckle binds it. So 




it is marked all the way up, as if it had a ribbon 

round it. 

Then there are the pretty p)lants called Tares or 

vetches, which have flowers like small j^ea-flowers. 

They cKmb everywhere by their tendrils. I think 

you will be able to find 
all these as well as the 
Convolvulus or bindweed, 
which twines round all 
plants, even our goose- 
berry and currant bushes, 
and wants weeding out 
very carefully. But I am 
not quite sure whether 
you can find a curious 
plant called the Dodder. 
You must look for it on 
the common, climbing 
over the heath and gorse 
bushes. It is only a thin 
wiry stem, with clusters 
of tiny pink flowers on 
it. It has no leaves at 
all. How then can it live 
since it has no leaves to 
make food? It twines 

round the gorse, or heath, or clover, and sends its 

roots into their stems and sucks out ready-made 

food! 

The Vine and the pretty Virginia creepers turn 

their small branches into threads for climbing. 

Very likely you have a Virginia creeper on your 




wall, which turns red in the autumn. Two kinds 
of this creeper have a very curious plan for 
climbing. . When the threads, or tendrils, touch 
the wall, their tips turn red, and swell into little 
cushions. These cushions stick so fast to the ^vall 
that even when the branch is dead you have to 
pull them off. Lastly the Ivy climbs by small 
roots, which grow all along the stems. 

Now you know all the four dodges which plants 
have for climbing. By hooks, by threads, by their 
roots, and by the ^vhole plant twining itself round. 
Try to see how many you can find. 

Bring one of each kind of climbing plant. 



Some plants live for one year only. Some live for 
two years. Some live for many years. 

Have you not noticed that you have to sow 
mignonette, marigolds, and peas and beans fresh 
every year in the garden? — unless you keep the 
young seedlings, which grow from the seeds that 
fall. In the fields, wheat and oats only live till 
their grains are rij)e, and then die away if they 
are left in the ground till winter comes. 

In the same way chick^veed, the corn poppy, and 
our old friend the shepherd's purse die when their 
seeds are ripe. These plants are like people who 
earn just enough to live from day to day, an(3 
cannot save for next .year, 



But if you want to have Sweet Williams, or 
Canterbury Bells in flower in the summer, you must 
sow the seeds the summer before. For these plants 
do not flower the first year. They only grow their 
root, and a short stem with leaAes on it. The 
plant is busy making food, and storing it up in 
the root and stem, as starch and sugar and gum, 
so that it is ready to make a strong flowering plaiit 
next year. 

Then after they have flowered and made theii 
seeds, these plants die. They have only stored 
enough for a short life, and cannot live anothei 
year. Foxgloves, Thistles, and Wild Parsley behave 
in this way. 

Lastly, you know that Snowdrops, Crocuses, 
Daisies, Primroses, Pansies, and Dahlias live on for 
many years, dying down in the autumn and coming 
up again in the spring. These plants send down 
the starch and sugar into the root, or the lower 
part of the stem, or into the bottom of the leaves 
underground. 

Some of them grow more than two years before 
they try to flower. They are like people who save 
when they are young, and always go on saving, so 
that they have something to spare. 

You can sometimes make a plant store up food. 
If you sow some mignonette and put one plant in a 
pot, and keep on nipping off the flower-buds so that 
it cannot make seeds, it will grow into a little shrub, 
and flower for two or three years. 

Different plants store . their food in differenf' 
parts. The wild carrot and the acorn, which is. 


growing into an oak, store theirs in the root. The 
carrot is fleshy and only lasts two years. But the 
root of the oak is woody and lives long. 

The lesser celandine, you remember, stores its 
food in small white lumps like white sugar-plums, 
which are swollen roots with a bud at the top. The 
marsh marigolds, and the pretty yellow flags, which 
^row by the river, store theirs in an underground 
stem. You must follow the stalks of the marsh 
marigold right back till you come close to the roots, 
and there you will find the thick knob, which lives 
on, all through the winter, and sends up fresh leaves 
in the spring. 

If you can get a long piece of the creeping stem 
of the yellow flag, you will see the marks of the 
places w^here the flowering stems have come up year 
after year. They follow each other along the stem 
till you come to the plant of this year. And beyond 
that is the bud for next year. 

Thei'e is a very pretty plant called Solomon's Seal, 
which is wild in some parts of England, and is often 
grown in cottage gardens. It has a tall flower- 
stalk with rather narrow leaves, and lovely white 
flowers, with green tips. The flowers hang down all 
on one side of the stalk. If you dig up a piece of 
the stem of this plant you will see large scars like 
seals upon it. These are the places where the stems 
have grown year after year, and this is why it is 
called Solomon's Seal. 

You can make out for yourself the mass of stems 
and buds people call a primrose root. I want now 
to show you an underground bud or bulb. Dig up 



a wild hyacinth, usually called a 
will find that it has a large knob 
with small roots grooving 
out of it. Cut tliis knoh in 
half, and notice that it is a 
bulb made of 
scaly leaves 
folded one 
over the 
other, ex- 
actly like an 
onion. 

If you dig 
it up in the 
spring, the 
flower - stalk 
will be standing 
up in the niiddk*, 
and when you pull 
the scaly leaves off 
one by one, you 
w^ill find another 
bud very small 
close to the bottom of the flower- 
stalk. If you dig up another 
plant in the autumn, the flower- 
stalk will have withered away, 
and the baby bud will be peeping 
out of the top of the bulb. 

This is what has happened. 
After the hyacinth left off 
flowering, the leaves grew long 



blue-bell. You 
at the bottom, 




primrose and solo 
mon's seal. 

Showing tlin thick stems ill 
which food is stored. 



and made food. 




and sent it down to the scaly leaves under- 
ground. The bulb grew fat and strong, and the 
}niall bulb mside grew larger. Now it is ready to 
lie quiet all the winter. When the spring conies 
the little bulb will take the food from the thick 
scaly leaves, and grow into a new plant. 

Bring six plants — two with food stored in the root, two 
in the vmdei'ground stem, two in bulbs. 



Now you will be able to understand how it is that 
we get such nourishing vegetables from the kitchen 
garden. The bees take honey and pollen from the 
flowers of plants. We take the sugar and starch 
and other food, which they store up in their leaves, 
and steins, and roots. 

Carrots, Parsnips, and Beet-roots are plants Avhich 
store up food in their roots the first year, and 
flower the second year. So we sow them, and feed 
them very w ell the first year, and ^ hen they have 
laid up a good store of sweet food, we jjuU them up 
and eat them before they can flower. 

If you can get your father to leave one of these 
plants in the ground till the second year, you will 
see it flower and make its seeds. But a turnip will 
flower in the first year, if you sow it early in the 
spring, and leave it all the summer. This is why 
we sow our largest stock of turnips in June and 
July so that they may not flower before w^e want 
them in the winter 






A carrot badly-grown and well-grown. Asparagus in the bud, as we eat it, and with its 
red seeds as it ripens. Onion cut across to show the scaly leaves iu which food 
is stored. 




Now I think I hear a little boy saying, " She has 
forgotten potatoes." No, I have not. But potatoes 
are not roots, like carrots and turnips. Cut one 
open and you will see some dark spots in it called 
' eyes," Indeed you may see tliem without cutting 
if you wash it and look carefully. 

Each of these eyes is a little bud, with a growing 
tip, and the beginning of leaves. Noav you know 
that a root cannot bear leaves. It can onlj^ have 
one bud on the top where the stem begins. So the 
potato cannot be a root. 

Next time you dig up some potatoes for dinner, 
look at the roots carefully before j^ou shake off the 
potatoes. You will then see that each potato grows 
at the end of a white stalk, very different from the 
roots. For a potato is a swelling at the end of a 
stem, which grows underground. It is a " tuber " 
hke the Jerusalem Artichokes, which I expect you 
also have in the garden. 

If you cut up either an artichoke or a ])otato into 
pieces, and leave a bud in each piece, it will grow 
vip into a new plant, and send down food into the 
stems below the ground, and form more tubers. 
The potato plant flowers, and forms seed every 
year. The seed-box is poisonous, and so are the 
seed-boxes of many of the Potato Family. The 
Deadly Nightshade, with its dark black berries, 
belongs to this family. It is never safe to eat 
any berry, or other fruit, unless you know what 
it is, for many berries -which even the birds eat, 
are poisonous to some animals and to man. 

The potato plant stores its poison only in its 





seed-box, which is green, there is none in the 
potato. The potato disease which gives us so 
much trouble is a little plant like the mould on 
jam, which eats the potato away. 

In Celery we eat the stems which gro^\' above 
ground. But we earth them up to keep them 
white. For plants cannot become green without 
sunlight. In Asparagus we eat the green stem with 
the bud at the top. Those buds which we do not 
eat branch out in summer, and have beautiful 
leaves and bright red berries. 

Lastly in Onions, Leeks, and Shallots we eat 
the bulbs, or underground buds, like that of the 
hyacinth. They have plenty of good food in them 
stored up in the scaly leaves. 

Now let us see what you must do if you want 
your roots, bulbs, and stems to grow into good 
vegetables. First you must drain the ground if it 
wants it, and dig it deeply and break the earth up 
so that the roots have no hard lumps in their way 
and can grow straight and strong. Then you must 
dig in some manure. And be careful that you dig 
it in deep, for grubs and maggots like carrots and 
onions as much as we do ; and in the autumn and 
spring, when you dig the garden, they are lying 
about in their cocoon shells. If you bviry them 
deeply in the ground, then when they turn into 
flies they cannot get out to lay eggs. 

There is another way in which you can get the 
better of them. Each plant has its own grub which 
feeds upon it. There is the grub of the onion fly, of 
bhe carrot fly, and so on. So when you sow your 





seed, if you so^v the carrots where the onions were 
last year, and the onions in the old parsnip bed, 
when the fly is hatched she does not find the leaves 
for her eggs close at hand, and you may save your 
roots. 

Then in such plants as carrots and onions you 
must keep the roots and bulbs well covered, and 
when you thin them out you must make the 
ground firm again. For the onion fly and the 
carrot fly lay their eggs on the root or bulb, and 
if they cannot find their way in, the root is 
safe. 

Lastly, you know the troublesome wireworm 
which wriggles along just underground and eats 
everything it finds. To be even with him you must 
keep the ground clean, for he likes rubbish to hide 
in, and you had better mix some salt or lime with 
the earth. If he is still troublesome you can put 
some slices of potato just under the ground and 
stick a t^ag in, to show where they are, and you 
are pretty sure to find him underneath in the 
early morning. 

Bring six vegetables — 1, root ; 2, bulb ; 3, stern ; 4, tnber; 
5. leaves ; 6, flowers. 




In the autumn, when the plants have left off 
flowering, there is plenty for us to do in looking 
for fruits, and finding out how they scatter their 
seeds. 

Some drop them near at home. The poppy, as 
we saw, has a hard fruit with little openings under 
the cover. When the stalk bends the seeds fall out 
through these holes and grow in the ground all 
around. 

If you look at the dry seed-boxes of the wild 
geranium which grows in the lanes, you will see 
that each one has curled up from the bottom. 
There will be five little curls round the sticky 
knob in the middle, and the seeds will be gone. 

There is a tall yellow Balsam which is found wild 
in some parts of England, and another with reddish 
flowers, which is often grown in cottage gardens, 
which have a most amusing seed-box. When it is 
ripe it bursts open and flings out its seeds. If you 
can get a friend to touch a ripe pod, it will make 
you laugh to see how he jumps as it pops with a 
bang ill his hand. This is why the plant is often 
called " touch-me-not." 

But plants want their seeds to be carried farther 

away than even pojiping will send them. Think 

iiow many flowers there are crowded together in 

hedgerow. If all the seeds fell close round they 




would stifle each other. So plants try all sorts of 
plans to get their seeds scattered. 

I am sure you have blown the feathery dande- 
lion "clocks" on your way home from school. 
Next time you do it look at one of the little floating 




messengers. Do you remember that when we 
looked at the dandelion we found that it was a 
flower-head with hundreds of tiny flowers, and 
that each flower had an oval seed-bag at the 
bottom Avith a number of fine hairs on the top of 
it and a yellow crown with a long strap ? 




Now the yellow cro^vn has withered away, and 
che top of the seed-box has grown up into a long 
neck with the hairy sepals on the top {see Fig., p. 25). 
A.nd when the wind catches these hairs it carries 
the tiny fruit along perhaps for miles, and then 
it drops down to grow. 

Thistles and sow-thistles, groundsel and teasels, 
and a number of other flowers of that kind have 
these feathery seeds. So you see when you let 
them grow on your own ground you spoil the 
ground of other people as well. 

This is the way that wind carries seeds. 

Other seeds are washed down by streams and 
left on their banks, Others, again, are often 
carried in the mud that sticks to the feet of birds. 

Another plan is to grow tiny hooks on the seed- 
boxes so that animals carry them. The goose-grass 
does this. We saw on p. 64 that it has tiny hooks 
all over its stem and leaves, which it uses for 
climbing. It has the same kind of hooks on its 
tiny seeds. If you take a bunch of goose-grass 
in your hand you will get a number of the very 
small seed-boxes sticking to your fingers. 

But there is a much bigger " burr," wnich 
grows on the common Burdock in the lanes. The 
burdock (see p. 77) is a tall plant, with very large 
heart-shaped leaves and pink flower-heads, some- 
thing like a thistle. You often bring its burrs 
home on your clothes, dogs carry them in their 
hair, and sheep in their fleece. Each of these burrs 
is a cup of leaves covered with hooks. The leaves 
grow together into a ball with the flowers peeping 




Out at the top, and if you open a ripe burr you will 
find the tiny fruit inside. 

So you, and the dogs, and the sheep carry the 
seeds for the plants. 

But the prettiest plan of all is when the seed- 
box growls into a sloe, or a cherry, or into some 
bright berry like the berries of the hawthorn and 
the honeysuckle. For then the birds come to eat 
the nice fruit, and when they carry it off to some 
tree near they drop the stone down in a new place. 
Or they eat the berry, and the hard seeds pass 
through their body, and fall with their droppings 
somewhere far ofP. 

Now you see why the blackberry and the rasp- 
berry grow juicy pulp round their seeds, and why 
the little hard seed-boxes of the strawberry stick 
in the juicy mound. All this is to tempt the birds 
to eat them and carry their seeds. 

So too in the hip of the wild rose, the green cup 
grows large and soft, and turns a bright red just 
when w^inter is coming, and there is not much food. 
Then the birds come and peck at the cup, and the 
seed-boxes inside stick to their beaks or are swal- 
lowed, and so are carried away. 

You know that in a hard winter the holly 
berries and mistletoe, the hips and haws, and even 
the berries of the yew and the honeysuckle, are 
often all gone before Christmas. But I daresay 
you did not know before that the birds were 
carrying about seeds to grow up next year. 

But if you keep your eyes open, you can learn 
a great many things like these, which children shut 





up in towns cannot see. You are happy to live in 
the beautiful country, among the birds and the 
flowers. You breathe the fresh air, which the 
plants make sweet, you gather your own flowers, 
and grow your own vegetables and fruit, and you 
can watch the plants in your garden growing 
prettier every year. 

Try to find the fruits of the wild geranium, yellow balsam, 
dandelion, groundsel, thistle, teasel, goose-grass, burdock, rose, 
hawthorn, honeysuckle, yew, and other plants. 



These lessons are intended to be read after the teacher 
has given one or more lectures on the subject. It is not 
necessary to read the book straight through. Different lessons 
are suited for different seasons, and in some cases one lesson 
may serve for a month's work ; the children being enconraeed 
to observe and ooUect. 


I WONDER how many birds you know by sight, and 
what you could tell about their nests and their 
lives ? 

There are between three and four hundred 
different British birds, and very few people know 
them all. But in any one place there are not more 
common birds than you could learn in a year. You 
can look for the rare ones afterwards. 

The best ^vay to begin is to write down those 
you are sure about, and say ho'w you recognise 
them. You cannot mistake a Rol)in, with his red 
breast, his plump little body, and his brown wings. 
The mother robin's breast is not quite so red, ano 
the young have no red at all. But when you have 
seen them with the cock-robin, you will soon know 
them by their shape. 

But a Chaffinch has a red breast. How can you 
tell him from a robin ? His breast is much browner 
than the robin's, and even at a distance you may 


know him by the white bands on his dark wings, 
and the yellow tips to some of his feathers. Then 
his body is longer, and he moves more gracefully 
than the robin, while his loud ^^ pink, pink" if you 
go near his nest, will tell you at once T\^hat he is. 

The Lark you know by his slender brown body 
and white speckled throat, and by the way he soars, 
as he sings his sweet song. The common green 
Woodpecker is easily known by his bright colours, 
his curious feet, and his stiff tail, which he uses to 
jerk himself up a tree. And though a Nuthatch 
also goes up a tree by jumps, you would never take 
him for a woodpecker, for he is no bigger than a 
sparrow, and he has a short tail and blue-grey 
wings with a dingy red breast. 

Then you know the cooing Wood-pigeon, the 
chattering Magpie, the soaring Hawk with his 
hooked beak, and the downy Owl. And I daresay 
you could tell me of many more. 

The birds you kno^v best will most of them be 
with us all the year round. But not all. The Swifts 
fly away to the south in August, and the Swallows 
and the Martins follow in October. When they are 
gone the Fieldfares come from the north, and feed in 
flocks on the worms in the damp fields, and on the 
holly berries when the ground is hard ^vith frost. 

The Swallow^ and the House Martin are so alike 
trhat, as they come and go together, you might not 
know them apart, unless you remember that a 
Swallow has a blue-black collar across his breast, 
and that the fork of his tail is longer than that of 
the Martin {see p. 45). You may be busy all the 





year round watching the birds, seeing when they 
come and go, what food they eat, how they fly. 
whether they sing in the morning or evening, and 
where they build their nests. 

Many farmers and gardeners shoot little birds 
because they eat their corn and peas and fruit. But 
a large number of birds feed chiefly on insects. You 
ought to know which these are, for they are very 
useful in clearing away earwigs and caterpillars, as 
well as slugs and snails. If you look out early 
some morning and see a Thrush tapj)ing a snail- 
shell against a stone to get at the snail, you will 
say he is a good gardener. You will not grudge 
him a little fruit in the summer. 

Then there are the nests and the young birds to 
Tvatch. You need not take the nests, nor rob the 
birds of their eggs. You will learn much more 
by pulling back the leaves and the twigs, and 
peeping gently into the nest. For then you can 
come another day and watch when the eggs hatch, 
and how the young birds grow. If you are careful 
not to disturb the bush nor touch the eggs, the 
mother will not desert them. Last year a pair of 
Thrushes built their nest in a hedge by the side of 
a path where people were always passing. But 
though I w^ent often to look at it, the mothei 
brought up all her four little ones. She would 
even sit still on the nest Tvhen I peeped in, while 
her mate sang on a tree close by. 

Point out and describe six birds common in the neighbour- 
hood. 


Birds sing when they are happy, and cry out ^when 
they are frightened, just as children do. Only 
they have songs and cries of their own. You can 
always tell ^when the little song-birds are happy, 
for each one trills out his joyous notes as he sits 
3n a branch of a tree, or the top of a hedge. 

In the early mornings of the spring, you wdll 
hear singing in the garden almost before it is light. 
First there is a little chirping and twittering, as 
if the birds were saying " good-morning " and pre- 
paring their throats. Then, as the sun rises, there 
conies a burst of song. 

Robins, Thrushes, Blackbirds, Chaffinches, and 
Wrens whistle away merrily, and many other little 
birds join in. While they are all singing together, 
it is not easy to tell one song from another, though 
the Thrush sings loudest and clearest of all. 

Then they fly away to their breakfast and, as 
the day goes on, you hear one or two at a time. 
So you can listen to the notes of each song, and 
if you go near very quietly, you can see the throat 
of the bird swelling and quivering as he works the 
little voice-chords inside, w^hich make the notes. 

It is not easy to write down what a bird sings, 
for it is like whistling — there are no words in it. 
But people often try to imitate their songs in 
words. Listen to the Thrush. You can fancy he 
says "cherry-tree, cherry-tree, cherry-tree" three 
times. Then, after some other notes, he sings 




"harry-up, hurry -up," and "go-it, go-it." For the 
thrush has a great many notes. 

The pretty Yellowhanimer, with its brignt yellow 
head, sings "a little bit of bread, and no ehe-e-s-e." 
The Chiff-chaff calls "chiff-chaff, chiff-chaff" quite 
distinctly. Any child can imitate the cuckoo, or the 
coo-oo-oo of the wood-pigeon. 

As the days grow hotter, the birds sing less. 
They sit on the branches of the trees, or on the 
hedges under the shade of the leaves, or hop about 
in the wood. 

Then when the evening comes, and long shadows 
creep over the grass, each bird looks out for his 
supper. When he is satisfied he sings his evening 
song of content, before he goes to sleep. 

What a concert it is! Finches, tomtits, sparrows, 
wrens, robins, and chaffinches all singing at once. 
And above them all, come the song of the thrushes 
and blackbirds, the cooing of the wood-pigeon 
and the caw-caw of the rooks as they fly home 
from the fields. As the thrushes were the first to 
begin in the morning, except the lark, so they are 
the last to leave off at night, and often one thrush 
will go on long after all the others are quiet. 

Then at last all seem to have settled down for 
the night. But no ! If you live in Kent, or any 
part of the south or east of England, you may hear 
in May or June a sweet sound, like a flute, coming 
softly from many parts of the wood. This comes 
from the Nightingales, who, in the warm summer, 
will sing nearly all night. 

They sing in the day as well, but their note is 


so soft that often you cannot hear it when the 
more noisy birds are singing. In the still night you 
ean hear the sweet song rising up six notes and 
then bubbling like a flute played in water. When 
you have once heard a nightingale sing you will 
never forget it. In Yorkshiie or Devonshire you 
will not hear him, for he does not go so far to 
the North or to the West. 

Birds sing most in the spring, for then they are 
making their nests, and the father bird sings to the 
mother while she is building, and when she is 
sitting on the eggs. You may often find out 
where a Robin's nest is hidden by seeing the cock- 
robin sitting on a branch singing to his mate. 
Most people too, have seen the Wood-pigeon 
puffing out his throat and cooing and bowing to 
the mother bird on her nest. For pigeons make 
love all the year round. 

When the mother bird is sitting, the father sings 
for joy, and when the young birds are hatched he 
teaches them his song. Song-birds have very deli- 
cate throats. They have muscles, which quiver like 
the strings of a violin, and the young birds have 
to learn to work these muscles. 

It is curious to hear a young Blackbird or 
Thrush beginning to try a tune. First he sounds 
one note, then two or three. They are not always 
In tune, but he tries again and again. So little by 
little he learns his father's song. 

Listen to the song of birds— robins, thrushes, blackbirds, 
larks, nightingales, bullfinches and others, and try to imitate 
them by whistling. 



If you want to know how cleverly nests are made, 
you should collect a few which the birds have 
deserted, or from which the young birds have 
flown. 

You will find a Hedge-sparrow's nest in many 
a hawthorn bush, and though it is a simple nest, 
I think you will find, if you pull it to pieces, that 
you cannot put it together again as well as the 
bird did. 

A Chaffinch s neat is more fiuely woven. You 
will most likely find one in the apple trees in the 
orchard. It is made of dry grass and moss matted 
together with wool in the shape of a deep cup, and 
lined with hair and feathers. Outside, the bird will 
most likely have stuck pieces of grey or white 
lichen. Lichen is the papery-looking plant which 
grows on apple trees, and which children call grey 
moss. The pieces woven in help to hide the nest in 
an apple tree. When the Chaffinch builds in a 
green hedge she often uses green moss instead. 

Now try to find a Thrush's nest. It may be in a 
laurel-bush or a fir-tree. It is large and quite firm, 
not soft like the hedge-sparrow's nest. For the 
thrush plasters the inside with mud, or cow-dung, 
or rotten wood, till it is almost as hard as the 
inside of a cocoa-nut shell. 

When you have looked at these nests, you will 
want to see one built next spring. But this is not 
so easy. For birds try to hide the cradles of their 



little ones, and do not like to work when anyone is 
near. 

Rooks are the easiest to watch, for they build in 
high trees, and therefore are not shy. You may see 
them flying along ^th pieces of stick in their 
mouths, and bringing mud and clay to plaster them 
together. Sometimes you may see the old rooks 
staying behind in the rookery, to steal the sticks 
from the nests of the young rooks while they 
are away, instead of fetching them for themselves. 

Birds do not all make the same shaped nests. 
The Lark makes her nest of grass in a rut or a 
furrow of the field. The green Plover or Peewit, 
whose cry you know so well, "pee-Tveet, pee-weet," 
lays a few bits of grass, or rush, in a marsh or in 
a rough field. Her little ones run about as soon 
as they come out of the egg. 

The Swallows build their nests of mud and straw 
on the rafters of barns, or under the ledges of 
chinmeys, in the shajie of a shallow basin, and line 
them with feathers. But the Martins build under 
the eaves. They make their nests of clay stuck 
against the wall like a bag, with only a small hole 
at tJie top. It is very funny to see the tail of a 
martin sticking out, when she puts her head into 
her nest to feed the young ones. 

The Woodpecker makes a hole in a tree for her 
nest, and lines it with chips of wood. The Nuthatch 
looks out for a hole in a branch, and lines it with 
flakes of bark and dry loaves. Then, if it is too big, 
she fills up the opening with clay all except one 
little hole 




Rooks and Pigeons build coarse nests. Th€ 
rooks build theirs of sticks and turf lined with 

grass and moss. The pigeon 
leaves hers so loose that the 
eggs almost slip through. 

Then the Httle 
singing birds, the 
Warblers, the 
Thrushes, the Nightin- 
gales, and the Robins 
build lovely cup-nests. 
Reed - warblers weave 
their nest round two 
or three reeds, or other 
plants, near the ^vater. 
It is made of blades of 
grass and lined with 
water-weed. The Wren, 
the long-tailed Tit- 
mouse, and the Chiff- 
chaff, build nests in the shape 
of a ball, with a hole in one 
side. The chiff-chaff lines 
hers with a beautifully soft 
layer of feathers. 

Wrens build in all sorts 
of strange places, in walls 
and trees, in holes of rocks, 
on the tops of hedges and on the banks of rivers. 
If you look about near the nest in which the wren 
lias laid her eggs you will often find one or two 
other nests built exactly like it, but not lined with 


feathers. They are called "cock's nests.' We do 
not know why the birds build them. Perhaps one 
day you may find out if you watch. The chiff- 
chaff hides her nests in the hedges or banks, and 
the long-tailed titmouse loves to build in the gorse 
bushes. 

Once two Wrens were watched building their 
nest in a juniper tree. They began at seven o'clock 
in the morning. The mother wren brought some 
leaves from a lime-tree. She put one leaf in a fork 
of the tree, and laid the others round it. Then she 
went back for more. So she went on all day, bring- 
ing in leaves, and matting them together with moss, 
and all the while the cock-wren sang to her from 
the top of the tree. 

By seven o'clock in the evening she had made the 
outside of the nest, in the shape of a ball with a 
hole in one side. 

Next day the two birds began work together at 
half-past three in the morning. They worked for 
eight days, carrying in moss and feathers. When 
they had done, the nest was a firm little ball, lined 
with a thick layer of soft feathers, for the wee 
wrens to lie in, when they were hatched. 

Then the mother wren laid five small white eggs 
with a few red spots upon them, and sat for a whole 
fortnight, while her mate sang to her, and brought 
her insects to eat. 

Examine nests. Mxid-huilt — swallow, martin. Roughly 
woven — honse-spaiTow. Cup-nests — hedge-sparrow, chaffinch. 
Woven and mud-lined — thrush. 


When you have looked at several birds' nests, you 
will want to see what the eggs are like. Try first to 
find those which are near your home. Some are 
so well hidden, that you will have to watch T^^here 
the old birds go in and out, before you can find 
them. Others, like the nests of rooks, magj)ies and 
jays, are easy to see, but not easy to reach. 

Do not take the eggs. Each ^dll hatch out into 
a happy little bird, and if you carried the egg home 
it would only be broken. Your teacher will very 
likely collect one of each kind, which will do to 
show the class for many years. 

But look Tvell at the eggs in the nest. Then you 
will know them again when you find them in 
another place. Count how^ many there are, and 
notice if any more are laid afterwards. Then 
reckon how long the eggs are being hatched, after 
the last one is laid. You vnU. find it is about a 
fortnight for the small birds and a day or two 
longer for rooks and pigeons. Then you can 
watch the feeding of the young birds, which we 
shall talk about in the next two lessons. 

It is better not even to touch the eggs ; for some 
birds, like the wood-pigeon, will desert their nests 
if the eggs have been handled. Other birds are not 
so particular. Mr. Kearton tells us that when he 
vvas a boy he used to find plovers' nests and amuse 
himself by turning the large end of the egg into the 
middle of the nest. As soon as the tidy mother 



came oack, she always turned them round again 
with the points in the middle. The baby bird 
always comes out at the large end, so this gives 
them more room, as they hatch out. 

If you have a laurel hedge in the garden jca 
may find a Thrush's nest in it, with four to six 
beautiful blue eggs, about an inch long and spotted 
with black at the large end (see picture, p. 10). The 
mother will scold you well, and perhaps will not 
leave the nest, and you will have to take your 
chance ^vhen she is away. You may find a Black- 
bird's nest not far off. You will know it from 
the thrush's nest because it is lined with fine 
roots and grass, so is not hard inside. The eggs 
are greener with red-brown spots. The Missel 
thrush generally builds in a tree, and her eggs are 
a light buff colour spotted with reddish brown and 
pale lilac. 

The Chaffinch will build close to your house, 
or in the apple trees of the orchard ; and a pair 
of Bullfinches may make their nest in the ivy of 
the old garden wall, though they are shy birds. 
The chaffinch's eggs are a pale brown-green colour 
with brown spots (see picture, p. 20). They are 
about one-third the size of the thrush's egg. The 
bullfinch's are a pale blue, spotted with bro^^ni or 
purple. Be careful when you look at the bull- 
finch's nest, for though the mother will sit still, 
the father will be angry, and he may make her 
desert her nest, if he sees you. 

You will have to get a ladder if you want to see 
a Martin's nest, for they build under the eaves of 




fche house. And when you pull away a little of the 
nest and look in, make sure that you see the right 
sggs, for a sparrow will often take a martin's nest 
and lay her eggs in it. You can find out, by 
watching which bird goes into the nest. But if 
you cannot do this, you may know by the colour 
of the eggs. A martin's e^g is white without any 
spots upon it, A sparrow's egg is grey with brown 
blotches on it. When the sparrow builds her own 
nest, it is made of straw or hay lined with feathers. 
It has about live or six eggs in it. 

It is easier to look into a Swallow's nest than 
into a martin's, for it is not covered at the top, 
and is often put upon a rafter in a barn. It will 
have about five white eggs in it, with dark red 
patches on them. Watch these nests carefully, for 
when the eggs are hatched it is very pretty to 
see the old swallows teaching the young ones to 
catch flies {see picture, p. 45). 

We must not forget the Robins, though I expect 
you know their eggs well. They are white, spotted 
?with light red, and you may easily find them, for in 
the spring there is a robin's nest in almost every 
bank or hedgerow. 

You may look for a Tomtit's nest in all sorts of 
strange places, from a hole in a tree, to a flower-pot 
which has been thrown away. There will be s 
number of little white eggs in it speckled with 
red. The mother will hiss and peck at you to 
prevent you from taking them away. But in a 
few days she will not be afraid, for she is a bold 
little bird. 


You must learn to look for other eggs your- 
selves. In the barn you may find the Owl's large 
white eggs, and sometimes young birds and eggs 
together. In a bank of a river, or a hole in a 
wall, you may find the nest of a Water-wagtail 
with greyish white spotted eggs. The Rook's bluish 
green eggs sometimes fall down from their nests; 
and the Jackdaws will build in your chimneys. 

When you have spent some time hunting for 
nests and eggs, you will notice how cunningly they 
are hidden by their colour and their marks. 

Wherever you find white eggs like those of the 
owl, the martin, the woodpecker, the kingfisher, and 
the pigeon, they are either quite hidden in a bank, 
a tree trunk, or a deep nest, or they are high up 
out of reach. Most other eggs are spotted, and 
they are either some shade of green or grey or 
brown, like the moss and leaves and twigs of the 
nest. 

In any nest yon can find, see how many of the eggs grow 
up into yoiing birds, (-hoose one nest each, to watch and see 
ivhich child can count vip most young birds. 



The mother bird sits on the nest and keeps the 
eggs Aivarni all the time that the little birds are 
growing inside. She never leaves them except to 
stretch herself and get food. Sometimes the father 
bird sits while she is away, or he brings food to 
her. Sometimes he only sings to her. 

The first thing that the baby-birds do for them- 
selves is to get out of the egg. When they are 
ready you may hear them crying " cheep, cheep " 
inside. Then they tap away at the big end with 
a little horny tip, which grows on the top of theii 
beak, and the shell cracks, and out they come. 

If you can catch a chicken as soon as it is out 
of the egg, you may see this horny tip. But you 
must be quick, for a chicken is a very active baby- 
bird. It runs about directly it is hatched, and the 
horny tip falls off. 

The next thing young birds do is to open 
their beaks and cry for food. Some, like the 
chickens, ducks, and partridges come out with 
downy feathers all over them. These run about 
and get food for themselves. Their mother takes 
care of them, and they cuddle under her wing when 
she calls to them. 

Others, like the pigeon, the sparrow, and the 
thrush, are naked, blind, and helpless when thejf 
are hatched. They cannot get out of the nest, and 
their parents have to feed them. 

 



If you keep doves in a cage, or it you can climb 
up to the pigeon-boxes where the pigeons have 
their nests, you may learn a good deal by watching 
a baby pigeon. 

The day it conies out of the e^^ its eyelids are 
tightly closed. It has only a few downy tufts on 
its naked body, so you can see its fleshy wing and 
feel the bones. Handle it carefully and notice that 






its wing has three joints, just like your arm. 
One at the shoulder (s) close to the body, one at 
the elboiv (e), and one at the wrist (w). 

As it lies in the nest, it draws its elbow back 
and touches its shoulder with its hand. Then the 
wing is shut. But if you take hold of the hand {h] 
gently, and pull the arm out straight, then the 
wing is open. This is just what a bird does when 
he stretches his wings to fly. 

Now watch the little ones day by day. By 
degrees pimples come out all over the body. Then 
the middle of each pimple sinks in and some 


The first feathers are quite 
limp. The little 
featherlets grow 
all round the steir 
like hairs on a cat's 
tail. These are the 
down feathers. 
There are not many 
on a young pigeon. 
The next feathei^ 
are quite difPerent 
They are flat and 
much stiffer. The 
featherlets only 
grow on each side 
of the stem. They 
are tinted, and you 
- can see now 

whether the pigeon 
is going to be w^hite or 
coloured. 

It is these "covering^ 
feathers which are so 
beautiful in most birda 
They do not grow all over 
the body. If you push 
back the feathers of a 
dead bird you w ill see that 
they grow^ in places only, 
and spread themselves 
over the rest. 



Meanwhile the long tail and wing feathers have 





been growing. Those for the tip of the wing grow 
on the hand, those for the edge of the wing on the 
arm, between the wrist and the elbow, and above 
these, like tiles on a roof, gro^v the small feathers 

right up to the 
s shoulder, making 

the wing round 
and firm. 

Feel one of 
the long wing 
feathers. It has 
a strong quill 
down the middle, 
which tapers 
away at the end 
so that the 
feather will bend, 
No"w try to pull 
the featherlets apart. You will find that 
they stick together, as if they were glued. 
This is because there are tiny hooks all along each 
little branch, by which it is hooked on to the next 
one. So when the wings beat the air, it cannot 
pass through them, especially as the small side of 
each feather lies over the broad side of the next 
one. 

By this time the young pigeons will have opened 
their eyes. But though they can stand up, they are 
very weak, and take all their food from their 
mother. 

Then about a month after coming out of the 
egg, t}iey go to the edge of the pigeon-house and 




watch the other pigeons. From time to time they 
stretch out their wings, and flap them a Httle. As 
they flap them downwards, the air under the front 
of the wing cannot get away there, and is driven 
out behind just as water is driven by an oar when 
we row. But as they Kft the wing up again the 
feathers turn so that the air can pass through. 
Therefore, as they flap their wings they raise them- 
selves a Httle, and flutter to the next ledge, and at 
last they fly to the ground and begin to jDick up 
food with their parents. 

Compare a yoving pigeon and a young chicken. Examine 
the down feathers, covering feathers, and long quill feathers. 


You will find it very interesting to peep into nests 
and see "which birds are naked and which are 
downy, -which can see, and which are blind. 

By the river the little Water-hens come out of 
the egg as black fluffy balls with red heads, and 
swim away at once after their mother. But King- 
fishers come out of the egg naked and helpless. 
They have to wait till their feathers have grown, 
before they can leave the nest, and meanwhile theii 
mother feeds them with fish. 

Then if you see a young Owl in its nest in a barn, 
or pick up a young Hawk which has fallen out of 





a tree, you will find that they are quite blind and 
helpless, though they are covered with down. Their 
mothers have to bring them insects, mice, and 
young rabbits till they are full-grown. 

Those of you who live by the seaside know quite 
well the Gulls which fly out to sea and float on the 
waves. In the spring and early summer you may 
hear the young gulls, called Sea-mews or Kitti- 
wakes, mewing like kittens on the ledges of the 
cliffs. They are calling to their parents to feed 
them {see picture, p. 71). 

For though these young gulls can see and are 
covered with down, they are born so high up on 
the cliffs that they must sit and wait till they are 
strong. Even then they can only creep along the 
ledges till their wings are full-grown. They sit 
there with open beaks, crying to be fed, and the 
old sea-birds bring fish for them to eat. The com- 
mon gulls and the herring gulls generally lay 
their eggs on islands, and the little ones swim about 
when they are only a few days old. 

Or, if you live far away from the sea in the 
depths of the country, you will enjoy seeing the 
other kinds of birds feeding their young ones in 
the trees and in the hedges. Sometimes the mother 
does all the work, and sometimes the father takes 
his share. 

Mr. Kearton, who knows so much about birds, 
tells us that he once helped in the feeding. One 
day he watched a mother Chiff-chaff bringing food 
to her five little ones in a nest under a thorn- 
bush. Chiff-chaffs are verv small, graceful birds. 



Their back and wings are a kind of dull olive green 
colour, and their breast a yellowish white. The 
mother was bringing in caterpillars and flies, about 
four or five every five minutes, and she popped 
them into the little beaks stretched to reach them. 
As she worked, her mate flew first to one bough, 
then to another singing " chiff-chafp, chiff-chaff," 

Mr. Kearton thought he ^vould help the little 
mother. He collected some green caterpillars, and 
put them on the edge of the nest while she was 
away. Then he knelt do^Ti a little way off. 

The mother flew to and fro at her work and 
looked at him as she passed, but he did not move. 
At last she picked up the insects he had brought 
and divided them among the little mouths. Then 
she flew away for more. 

That little mother worked all day long, only 
resting for half an hour in the afternoon. She not 
only brought food, but also cleaned the nest be- 
tween each journey, j^icking out the pellets of 
dung, and making everything clean and neat. I 
think she must have been very glad of the little 
heaps of insects which her friend put near her 
nest from time to time. 

Tomtits are such bold little birds that you may 
often see them going in and out of a hole in some 
wall, or a tree stumj), with insects in their mouths. 
The father and mother Tit both help in feeding 
(see p. 36). They go out and come back together, 
laden with caterpillars, and after giving them to 
the young ones they start off again, calling to 
each other as they go. 



We had some young Robins once which were fed 
by three birds. They were born in the hedge of 
our garden. We called the third bird the uncle. 
He worked quite as hard as the other two. By-and- 
bye the old robins flew away. But the young ones 
stayed with us all the summer and used to hop 
about the dinner table and pick up the crumbs. 

Blackbirds feed their baby-birds with large 
worms, which they pull to pieces, giving a bit to 
each. The jay looks as if she brought nothing, 
but she pours the food from her crop into the 
mouth of the little one. The mother pigeon throw^s 
the food up from her crop into her mouth, and the 
little ]3igeon puts its beak in at the side of its 
mother's beak and sucks out the food. 

Most parent birds go on feeding the little ones 
for some time after they can fly. You may often 
see little sparrows or thrushes sitting in a row on 
ii bough while the mother j)ops the food into their 
beaks. She begins at one end and goes quite fairly 
from one to another, each in its turn. 

Watch for birds feeding young in the spring. Thrushes, 
sparrows, robins, tomtits. 1. In the nest. 2. Sitting oi\ 
branches. 3. Small birds feeding a young cuckoo. 4. Young 
pigeon taking food from the mother. 



Where are all the birds at night ? In the daytime 
we see them in the fields, on the trees and hedges. 
or on the cliffs. They feed in the garden, the 
orchard, and the Avood. But in the evening, when 
the sun sets, we hear them singing as if they 
were saying "gocJ-night," and then they disappear 
Only the night birds are about after sunset. Owls 
hoot and fly after dark, nightingales sing all night 
in warm summer weather, and if there are any 
corn-crakes about, you will hear their tiresome 
cry, " craake, craake," long after you want to go to 
sleep. 

But the other birds are nowhere to be seen. 
Where are they ? It is not easy to find them, 
for they hide themselves, from fear of the owls, 
the weasels and the stoats, and they wake and 
flutter away very soon if you come near them. 

The small birds sleep chiefly in the hedges. 
You will be surprised how difficult it is to see 
them, even in winter when the leaves are off the 
trees ; for the twigs and branches crossing each 
other hide them well. No owl or hawk could 
seize a bird in a hawthorn hedge. 

But how do they keep themselves upon the 
twigs when they are fast asleep ? If you or I 
tried to sleep standing up we should fall. For our 
muscles would grow slack, our heads would nod, 
and our knees would give way under us. 


It is different with a bird. He sits on a branch, 
and grasps it with his claws. Then he squats down 
ind bends his legs. As he does this, a muscle round 
his knee-joints pulls the muscles of his toes quite 
tight, so that his claws are kept clasped round 
the branch. He cannot move till he has raised 
himself up and straightened his legs, and thus set 
his claws free. So the more soundly he sleeps the 
tighter he grasps the bough, and the less likely he 
is to fall. 

Birds sleep out of doors both summer and 
winter, and they have a curious covering to keep 
them warm. It is made of air. When a bird 
goes to roost, he tucks his head under the plumage 
of his shoulder, and puffs out his feathers, so that 
the air gets in between them, and settles all among 
the soft down which grows close to his body. This 
air soon becomes warm, and, as it cannot get out, it 
prevents the bird's warm body from being chilled 
by the cold air outside. 

Still, in bad weather birds often like to find 
warm nooks to sleep in. House-sparrows, tits, 
wrens, and other small birds sometimes make 
holes in hay-stacks for their beds. The owls keep 
themselves warm in barns, church towers, and 
sometimes in holes in the trunks of trees. The 
blue-tit loves to sleep under a thatched roof, and 
Wrens often hunt up old nests in winter, and 
huddle together in them to keep themselves 
warm. 

Swallows and swifts do not want to be kept 
warm, for they fly south in cold weather. In 




summer they perch on the rafters in the barns, 
and if you go into a barn after dark, you may 
often hear them flitting from one rafter to another 
if they are disturbed. 

Wood-pigeons roost on the fir-trees in the wood, 
and hawks on the branches of the taller trees. 
Pheasants, too, roost in the trees of the wood, 
and it is curious that they always tell you where 
they go to bed. For they call " crok, crok," as they 
settle down to sleep. 

But partridges sleep on the ground in the fields. 
They lie in a circle with their heads outwards and 
their tails together. The father generally sleeps 
a little way off as a sentinel. Then if a fox, or 
a weasel, tries to catch them in their sleep, any 
one that is awake and sees the enemy can give 
the alarm to the rest. 

All these birds sleep inland in the woods and 
fields. But if you can go to the sea-shore some 
summer evening and lie on the beach under the 
high cliffs, you may see other birds coming home 
to roost. Just as the sun is setting many little 
birds from the fields perch in the bushes at the 
top of the rocks. Next come any jackdaws, a\ Inch 
happen to live near the sea, cackling and chasing 
each other over the cliffs. They creep into holes 
to sleep. Then a few big cormorants sail in from 
the sea, followed by the gulls, and settle on the 
ledges half-way down the face of the cliff. Some 
croaking ravens come flying from the land, and 
twist and tumble about, before they too sit down 
for the night. The sand-martins disappear into 





their holes in the sandstone-rocks, and perhaps a 
falcon will come circling round in the air and swoop 
down in some quiet nook. 



Then after a time the cackling and the croaking 
cease and as the moon rises all is quiet. But if you 
look on the silvery water you will see that many of 
the gulls are still floating on the waves, and they 
may remain there all the night. 

Watch the birds going to roost at night, and notice their 
special haunts. 





Spring and summer are happy times for birds. 
Then there is plenty of food for them and their 
httle ones. Let us go out some fine sunnner morn- 
ing, and watch the different birds as they feed. You 
will not see them all in one day. But you ought to 
find each one some time during the summer. 

Close to the house you are sure to see a House 
Sparrow picking up scraps in the yard and eating 
the caterpillars and red spiders on the gooseberry 
bushes in the kitchen garden. For the sparrow^ i? 
not dainty. He will eat most things, from a grain 
of wheat to a scrap of meat. 

In the kitchen garden, too, you may see the 
Chaffinch breaking the husks of seeds with his sharp 
little beak. He is not j^articular whether he takes 
them from the weeds, or from the beds of radishes 
or turnips which we have sown. But he does us 
more good than harm, for he destroys a great deal 
of groundsel and chickweed. 

Out in the fields the little brown Lark, which has 
been singing in the sky, drops down to hunt for 
seeds in the furrows turned up by the plough. In 
the rickyard I can see several little Finches, the 
greenfinch and the yellowhammer, picking up the 
grains of corn. 

All these birds feed usually on grain, .•uid liave 
short sharp beaks which will split tiie husks, 






though they sometimes eat insects and feed their 
young ones on them. We have to drive them 
away from our wheat and oats for a few weeks 
in the year, but they are very useful in keeping 
down the weeds, for they eat every seed they can 
find. 

The Swallows, Swifts, and Martins have very 


 

different beaks. If you watch them as they skim 
along in the air, you will see they can open their 
mouths very wide to catch the flies and gnats. But 
fche hard beak itself is very small. They have weak 
legs and strong wings, for they catch all their food 
as they fly. Notice how near the ground they keep 
in dull weather. Then the insects are flying low, 
and the swallows follow them. But on a bright day 



the gnats and midges fly higher, so swallows fly- 
higher too. 

That big Thrush which is hopping about on the 



grass is very different from the swallows. He has 
strong feet and legs, and a long, narrow, round beak. 
He feeds on worms and snails in the summer, and 
on berries in the autumn. Look at him now. He 
has his feet firmly planted on the grass, and he is 



pulling away at a worm with all his might. He will 
get it out of the ground soon, and carry it away to 
feed his little ones. 

Many of the smaller perching birds feed only on 
insects. I am sure you ^11 love them. They are 
such pretty little things. First, there is the Wag- 
tail with his black and white wings, and his long 
tail bobbing up and down as he hunts for insects 
in the grass. Not far off is a little Wren hopping 
on a rose-tree and picking off the green-fly, which 
does so much harm. 

On a bush near, sits a small brown bird with 
a grey speckled breast. He only came back to 
England from warm countries at the end of May. 
He is the common spotted Fly-catcher. Look how^ 
still he sits. Then all at once he darts into the air 
with wide open mouth, snaps his beak, and goes 
back to his place. He has cavight a fly and will 
now^ sit and w^ait for another. 

Next I want you to look at a little bird which I 
love because he is so bright and gay. He is a Blue 
Tit or Tomtit {see picture, p. 36), a small bird with 
a bright blue head and wings, and a yellow breast. 
He is hanging upside down on the branch of a tree 
watching for spiders. When he has caught one he 
will flutter off to another tree and get a good 
breakfast in a very little while. He is a very bold 
little bird, and in the winter you may learn to 
know him well, if you will give him some food. 

These birds, the thrush, the wagtail, the fly- 
catcher, the wren and the tomtit are very useful to 
UAx They kill the snails and slugs, the caterpillars, 



maggots, and grubs. So do the nightingale and the 
blackbird, and another little bird, which I want you 
to knoT^^ This is the Hedge-sparrow, a small brown 
bird with a blue-grey breast, which flutters along 
the lanes. I am sure you must have seen him. He 
picks up a tiny insect, flits a little way and picks up 
another, and then flits away again jvist in front 
of you as you walk along the lane. You must not 
confuse him with the house-sparrow. He is quite 
another kind of bird, he is one of the warblers and 
sings very sweetly. He is sometimes called the 
"hedge-warbler," and this is a much better and 
truer name for him. 

We have not much time to watch other birds. 
But w^e must look at the rooks hunting for worms 
and slugs in the ploughed fields ; and as we come 
near the wood I see a partridge feeding on ants 
under the trees. He flies away with a loud whirr 
long before "w^e get near him, and as he cries " cluck, 
cluck" I expect the mother bird and her nest are 
not far off. 

If you go into the wood you may see the little 
Tree-creejier running up the trees looking for 
insects, and the woodpecker darting out his sticky 
tongue and tapping at the trunks of the trees, and 
the wood-pigeon flying home with her crop full of 
oats or peas to feed her little ones. 

Or if you stroll by the river there may be the 
tiny kingfisher darting down to seize tiny fish ; or 
the grave heron sitting quite still, with his neck 
stretched out, till in a moment his head shoots 
forward, and he brings up a big eel in his beak. 





You can notice many of these things for your- 
selves. The great secret is to look at every bird 
you see and try to learn something about it. 

Notice the hard beaks of birds which eat seeds— ChaflQnch. 
The hooked beaks of birds which eat flesh— Hawk. The wide 
gape of birds which catch insects on the wing — Swallow. The 
long, slender beaks of birds which feel underground for food — 
Woodcock. 



When the summer is over, there is not so much 
food for the birds, and some begin to go away. 
Those which live on flying insects go first. The 
cuckoo is generally gone by the end of July. The 
swifts start off in August, and about the middle 
of September the swallows begin to find very 
few flies, gnats, or moths, and get ready for their 
long journey. 

If you keep a sharp look-out you may see the 
Swallows and Martins collecting, about the 15th of 
September, on some church tower, or perhaps on 
the roof of a barn, and flying off together to roost 
in the trees. This they never do in the summer 
Then they sleep on the rafters of some barn, or 
under the eaves of a roof, always keeping near 
buildings. But before they fly away for the winter 
they gather together in the trees, or on the willows 
in the osier beds. 

Then ggjjie morning yery early they all dis- 





appear. They have started to fly steadily in large 
flocks, for hundreds of miles, to Africa, where they 
will have Avarni weather, and insects to eat, all the 
winter. You will not see them again till next April. 





The little Fly-catchers and the Nightingales go 
away about the same time as the swallows, and the 
Chiff-chafP goes in October. Some of the Wagtails 
and Robins go too, but not nearly all. 




A great many birds shift from place to place in 
England during the autumn, for food begins to be 
scarce, and they wander in search of it. Many 
thrushes and redwings come to us from Norway 
and Germany, and robins, finches, and other birds 
come from the north of England to the south, 
They leave the cold moors and mountains of Cum- 
berland and Yorkshire to feed in Hampshire and 
Devonshire, where they can find more berries, such 
as hips and haws, holly-berries, juniper-berries, 
sloes, and the red berries of the mountain ash. So 
if you live in the south of England, you may see 
more robins, thrushes, chafiinches, and yellow- 
hammers in the winter than you did in the 
summer. 

You will find it very interesting to watch for the 
different birds, and see when they come and go, and 
whether you see many or few of any one kind. 

You will notice that in winter the little birds 
move about in flocks, instead of alone, or in pairs, 
as they do in the summer, ^len they have their 
nests and families. In November you will see a 
great many larks together. The cock-chaffinches 
sometimes fly in one flock, and the hen-chaffinches 
in another. The Finches, too, fly in parties ; yellow- 
hammers, greenfinches, and goldfinches all together. 
They hunt about for seeds, and sleep on the ground, 
or in the ivy bushes. But the Bullfinches, with their 
lovely blue-black wings and bright red breasts, keep 
together in small flocks, flying in a line one after 
the other along the hedges. 

These flocks of different birds flit about from 



one field to another, keeping together, and scatter- 
ing over one place at a time, looking for food. 

When many of our summer birds have gone 
to the sunny south, other birds come to us from 
still colder countries. The Fieldfares fly over from 
Norway and Sweden. You may see them, in parties 
of about forty or fifty, wheeling round in the air, and 
settling down on a field to look for grubs and seeds. 
They are pretty grey birds with brown-red wings 
and buff speckled breasts. But you cannot often 
get near enough to see them, for they are very shy. 
If they hear a noise they are off in a moment, and 
over the hedge into the next field, where they drop 
down again to feed. They sleep on the ground ; 
and go back to Norway to build their nests in the 
spring. 

A great many Starlings come from Norway and 
Germany in the ^nter, and join those which live 
with us always. They often fiy about with the 
rooks, but sometimes in flocks by themselves peck- 
ing in the fields and chattering one to another. 

So when the song-birds are silent in the wintei*, 
you can look out for all these other birds and find 
out where they feed and sleep ; when you first see 
them come, and when you see the last one go. But 
the thrush and the robin will sing all the year 
through, when the weather is mild. 

Make a list of summer birds which yoxi do not see in the 
winter. Make a list of winter birds which go away in the 
spring. Make another list of birds you see all the year roimd. 


When Christinas is past and the real winter cold 
begins, the poor little birds often have a hard time. 
So long as the weather is mild, the thrush picks out 
the slugs and snails from their hiding-places in the 
walls and palings. The robin and the wren bustle 
about, looking for seeds and insects. The little wag- 
tails run about the lawns wagging their tails, as 
they try to find a stray grub or beetle. In the 
wood the tree-creeper hunts for spiders and the 
eggs of insects in the bark of the trees, and the 
nut-hatches and pigeons feed under the beeches. 

But after a while, when a hard frost comes, 
and snow lies deep on the ground, the birds look 
very sad. The larks and the linnets crouch down 
under the banks of the cornfields to keep warm. 
The thrushes fly from tree to tree to look for a 
few mistletoe berries, now that all the others are 
eaten. The chaffinches and the yellow-hammers 
fly round the farmers ricks, to pull out some 
grains of wheat or oats, or grass seeds. The field- 
fares wander sadly about in flocks. The rooks, 
starlings, and jackdaws fly from field to field 
screaming and cawing as they try to find some 
place where the wind has blown the snow away and 
they can peck in the furrows. The lapwings, which 
you may know b}^ the feathers, which stand up on 
the back of their head, cry " peewit, peewit " mourn- 
fully, as they journey to the sea-coast, where they 
find food on the sands and mudflats at low tide. 




It IS sad to think how often little birds are 
starved to death. They do not so much mind the 




cold, for you remember that the air under their 
teathers keeps them warm. But in a hard winter 
they often die from want of food. If you pick up a 
dead robin, starling, or rook after a long frost, you 





will find that the bones are only covered with skin 
and feathers. Its flesh has all wasted away. 

Now is your time to be kind to the birds which 
have sung to you all the summer. They did good 
work then, eating the caterpillars and grubs, the 
tvire-worms and maggots, the slugs and snails, and 
keeping down the weeds by eating the seeds. Now^ 
you can feed them, for a little while, till the frost 
and snow^ are gone. 

You will learn to know a great many birds in 
this way, and you need only give them a few scraps, 
which you can well spare. Some birds, you will 
remember, like seeds and crumbs and green food, 
Others, which eat insects in the summer, will be 
glad of a little gristle or fat. 

So you must save up every scrap from break- 
fast, dinner, and supper, and keep it for the next 
morning — crusts of bread, the crumbs off the 
table, cold potatoes, and potato skins. You can 
get your mother to boil the potatoes in their 
skins, and then the birds will like the peel. 
Perhaps, too, you may save some pieces of 
cabbage, some apple parings, and a little fat. 

All this will make a nice dish for starving birds, 
if you chop it up and pour a little hot w^ater over 
the crusts. And if you live on a farm you may be 
able to sweep up a few grains of corn in the 
stables, before they are thro^wn away with the 
manure. 

Then clear the snow away in front of your door, 
throw the food down and go back out of sight. 
The birds will soon come, and in a few days they 




win even be waiting about for their morning meal 
before you bring it. 

You must not forget to hang a piece of fat from 
the branch of a tree, so that you may see the tits 
hang head downwards on the string to peck at it. 
A.nd if you hang up a bone with a httle meat on 
it the starKngs and jackdaws will come too. 





Then remember that birds want to drink. You 
can put water for them in a pan, if you change it 
when it freezes. But if you can spare a few pence 
to buy a cocoa-nut, you may make it serve two 
purposes. 

Saw it across the middle, and scoop out all the 
white from one half. Bore two holes near the rim of 
this cup, and make a handle with a piece of string 
Then hang it on a tree and put some water in it 
The l.urds will sit on the rim and drink. And as 



they nialcG it swing to and fro the water will not 
freeze. Then hang up the other half in the same 
way, but leave the white inside. The little tomtits 
will peck away, and light for the sweet food till it 
is all gone. 

A number of birds will come — robins, chaffinches, 
sparrows, wrens, starlings, rooks, jackdaws, 
thrushes, and many others. You will be able to 
notice the difference between the big missel-thrush, 
with his white spotted breast, and the smaller 
brown song-thrush. And if you put some nuts on 
the window-sill the nuthatch may come to fetch 
them if he lives near. 

So you will see the birds more closely than you 
can at any other time, and next summer, when 
they sing in the trees, they will be old friends. 

Iake a list of the birds which come to feed at youi' door in 
winter. 

There are many other small birds which you may 
find out for yourselves, but I should like to tell you of 
a few which are interesting. First there is the little 
Goldfinch, which is so useful to us because it eats 
thistle seeds and dandelion seeds. It builds a lovely 
little nest of fine roots, wool, and horsehair, and 
often lines it with the soft down of the coltsfoot, 
that big yellow flower which blooms in the spring 


and has feathery seed-boxes. The goldfinch has a 
beautiful red forehead and throat, and black wings 
barred with yellow, and tij)ped 'with, white. You 
may know it from the bullfinch because its breast 
is pale brown, while the bullfinch has a rich red 
breast and grey and black wings. 

Then there is the cock-Linnet with his crimson 
breast, bro^n wings, and a red patch on his head. 
Linnets change colour at difl^erent times of the 
year. In the winter, the breasts of both birds are 
grey striped with brown. 

All birds moult, that is change their feathers, at 
least once a year. The father-birds are nearly 
alw^ays more gaudy ^vhen they are building their 
nests. You will notice too that hen-birds are 
scarcely ever so gay as their mates. This is most 
likely because they sit on the nests, and it would 
not do for them to be seen too easily. 

Linnets feed in big flocks in the winter. You 
may see them in the evening dropping down among 
the gorse and other bushes to sleep. It is sad that 
both the goldfinch and the linnet are caught and 
sold to sing in cages. This is why we have not 
nearly so many in England as ^ve used to have. 

I hope you wall look out for the Nuthatch, a 
little bird with a short black beak, a blue-grey 
back and wings, and a pale yellow breast, shaded 
with red. He is often seen in orchards and gardens 
m the autumn, when the nuts are ripe. You may 
catch sight of him coming down a nut tree, head 
downwards. He sticks the nuts into the cracks of 
the trunk and hammers them with his beak to 



break them. You may sometimes find a little 
store of nuts which he has hidden at the foot of 
the tree. . He feeds on other things, besides nuts 
and beech-mast, and he will peck at a piece of 
bacon in winter, if you hang it out for him. 

You must listen for the Blackcap. You will hear 
him more easily than you will see him. He is a 
little dark grey bird, with a black head and a pale 
grey breast, and sings almost as well as a nightin- 
gale. He comes back to England in April, and if 
you listen well you may hear him practising his 
song. He hides himself in a thick bush and begins 
gently in a low voice, singing over and over again 
till he gains strength. In a few days his voice is 
ready, and he trills out a wild, sweet song all the 
summer day, flitting from bush to bush as he sings. 
He feeds on insects and berries, and brings up four 
or five little ones in a lovely nest made of dry grass 
and spiders' Tvebs, and lined with horsehair. Then 
he flies away in October till the next spring. But 
he has been so often caught that he is not so 
common as he used to be. 

Then there is the little Whitetnroat, which 
creeps along almost everywhere under the hedges, 
and is often called the " nettle-creeper." He too is 
a brown-grey bird with a little red at the tips oi 
his feathers and on his breast. He hops and flies 
a little way as the hedge-sparrow does, chattering 
all the time, and sometimes flying higher and 
higher and singing louder. He, too, comes in 
May and goes in October. 
. There are two other little birds you may very 





likely see. One is the Stonechat, which Uves on 

commons and sits on the top of the furze bushes. 

It is a small brown-black 

bird with white markings 

and a rusty red breast. It 

cries " chat, chat, chat," 

and hides its nest so well 

in the gorse bushes that 

you will scarcely find one. 

The other is the little 
Dipper or water- 
ouzel, which hops 
about the stones 
in the bed of " 
rapid streams 
ana rivers. It feeds on 
insects and water snails. 
It is a black bird not 
quite as big as a thrush, 
with a very short tail and a 
sno^'y-white breast. It has a 
curious way of dipping its head 
down and flirting its tail. 

There is no room to tell about 
magpies or jays, but if you have 
any near you, you will know 
them already. 






Find out these small birds and any others in your neigh- 
oourhood, and try to know their nests and eggs. 


We call " Birds of Prey " those which feed on the 
smaller animals, such as rabbits, mice, frogs, and 
snakes, as well as on other birds. The chief kinds 
in our country are eagles, falcons, hawks, and 
owls. 

If you live in the mountains of Scotland, or the 
north of England, you may, perhaps, have seen 
an eagle {see picture, p. 51). But the birds of 
prey you are most likely to know are hawks 
and owls. 

I am sure that sometimes when you are in the 
fields, you must have seen a bird with long pointed 
wings and a tail like a fan hovering in the air. 
This is the Kestrel or common hawk. Country 
people call him the " wind-hover." His wings beat 
the air so quickly that you can scarcely see them 
move, yet he keeps quite still in the same place. 
His bright eyes look eagerly on the ground. Now 
he darts a little up or down, and floats along some 
distance. Now he hovers again, and all at once 
drops to the ground. He has seen a mouse in the 
grass, and rises up with it in his claws. 

Farmers often shoot kestrels because they steal 
young partridges and chickens, when they cannot 
find other food. But they are very useful in killing 
field-mice, moles, beetles, and all kinds of vermin. 

If you cannot tame a young hawk, nor find a 



dead one, you can see on pp. 51 aiid 61 how to 
know a bird of prey. Look at the long toes and 
sharp claws of the eagle or the hawk. They pierce 
the skin of any animal he seizes. His hooked beak 
is A'ery strong, and has sharp edges, so that it cuts 
Uke shears. The upper half is pointed, and hangs 
over the lower half. A few strong pecks with this 
cruel beak soon kill the tiny mouse or larger 
animals, which are swallowed whole or torn to 
pieces. After a little time the furry skin and the 
bones are thrown up in a ball. The feet and legs of 
a bird of prey are covered ^th scales, so that when 
he is fighting he is not so much hurt by hard pecks. 

The kestrel's wings are strong and pointed, and 
he can fly quickly, or keep himself floating, as he 
pleases. He is about as large as a wood-pigeon. 
His back and ^ngs are a bright brick-red, and 
his tail is grey, tipped with white, with a black 
band across. The long feathers of his wings are 
black, while his breast is pale yellow. 

Another common hawk is the Sparrow-hawk, 
which has dark grey wings and a reddish-brown 
breast with orange stripes. He does not often 
hover, but glides along the hedges looking for 
birds and mice. He does more harm than the 
kestrel, for he often kills game. But he is useful in 
destroying mice, and insects, and in preventing the 
small birds, which eat the corn, from becoming too 
numerous. The mother sparrow-hawk is much 
larger than the father. 

Owls, like hawks, have hooked beaks and long 
sharp claws. But their beak is not so strong, and 



their feet are more useful for climbing. Their four 
toes stand, three in front and one behind, like most 
birds, but they can turn back the outer front toe so 
as to have two in front and two behind, like the 
woodpecker. 

Notice too the difference in their eyes. A hawk 
has his eyes on the sides of his head, but the ow^l 
has his in front of his face like you or 1. So, 
when he hunts in the twilight, he can peer down 
at things close to him. He can make the pupil of 
his eye as large as the cat does, so as to gather all 
the light there is. His feathers are so soft and 
downy that he makes very little noise as he flies, 
and he has large hidden ears with flaps over them, 
and can hear the slightest sound. Some owls have 
ear tufts sticking up in the air like a cat's ear. 

The owl you hear so often crying " to-whoo, 
to-whoo " is the brown or Ta^vny Owl. He hunts in 
the early morning and late evening. In the day- 
time he hides in holes of the trees and in church 
towers. If he is driven into the sunlight he winks 
and blinks, and cannot see clearly. But in the 
dusk, or the moonlight he flies noiselessly along 
the hedges, and catches mice, moles, frogs, and 
birds, swallowing the small ones whole and throvi^- 
ing back the feathers and skin in little balls. 

The Barn Owl is a much lighter bird than the 
brown owl. His back and wings are buff colour, 
and his breast and face are white. He cries "te- 
whit, te-whee " in a loud screech, and is therefore 
often called the "Screech Owl." He hides in the 
barn, or in trees, by day and hunts by night, feeding 



chiefly on mice. When he conies out by daylight 
the chaffinches and other little birds tease him, for 
they know he cannot see well. 

Compare a hawk and an owl. Notice the cere, or piece of 
bare skin at the top of the beak, which all birds of prey have. 
It is partly covered by bristles in the owls. Try to draw the 
foot and beak of the eagle, pp. 51 and 73. 




"You go and scare they rooks out o' that field. 
They be eating all the seed," I heard a Devonshire 
farmer say to his boy one day. He was quite right. 
He had not sown his wheat deep enough, and the 
rooks were feeding on it. 

But some time after another farmer pointed to 
the rooks in his field, where the corn was green. 
"See how they be pulling up they young oats," 
said he. And so they were. But when we looked 
at the plants which they had pecked up, we found 
that each one had a place in the root where a grub 
had been living. 

This time the rooks had been doing useful work. 
Wire-worms and other grubs eat away the roots of 
grass, corn, and turnips all across a field. When the 
rooks kill a few grubs, they often save the whole 
crop. 

Once, a long time ago, some Devoi:shire farmers 
gave a large reward for rooks' heads, thinking they 
did harm to the farms. All the rooks around were 

 

soon killed. But the farmers were sorry after- 
wards. During the next three years all their crops 
were destroyed by insects and grubs. They had to 
persuade some fresh rooks to build in their neigh- 
bourhood to keep down the insects. 

No doubt rooks do some mischief, for they eat 
birds' eggs, and newly sown corn, new potatoes, and 
green walnuts. They even sometimes pull grain 
out of the stacks, when they are short of food. But 
they destroy so many wire-worms and grubs, snails 
and slugs, maggots and insects of all kinds, that 
they do more good than harm. 

You all know the heavy whirring cockchafer, 
which flops into your face in the evening. But 
perhaps you do not know that before he had wings 
he lived for three or four years undergrovmd feed- 
ing on the roots of grass and corn. Rooks eat these 
cockchafer grubs wherever they can find them, 
and so save our crops. 

I hope you have rooks near you, for they are 
delightful to watch. When they build their huge 
nests high up in the forks of trees, they make a 
great deal of noise and bustle. The father-rook 
begins to fetch food for his mate even before she 
lays her eggs, and feeds her all the time she is 
sitting. 

The old birds feed the young ones long after 
they are hatched. If you watch, you may see the 
young ones sitting on the edge of the nest opening 
their mouths to be fed. Rooks like to build near 
old houses, and use the same nests year after year. 
They will not allow strange rooks to join them. 





If the trees in which they huild lose their leaves 
ill winter, the rooks do not stay there long after 




the last young ones are able to ny. About August 
or September they often go to the beech and pine 
woods to sleep, and do not come back to their 



rookery till the spring. But every now and then 
on their way to and fro they call at their rookery 
and look after their nests. 

Crows do not live together in numbers like 
rooks. They live in pairs, and build their nests 
in the top of some high tree away from houses. 
They are more mischievous than rooks, for they 
feed on birds and young lambs, young pigeons, 
ducks, or chickens. 

You may tell a crow from a rook at a dis- 
tance because you very seldom see more than two 
together. When you can see them near, you will 
know them apart, because the rook, after he is a 
year old, has a bald patch on his head just above 
his beak, where the crow has feathers. 

Have you ever noticed how gravely a rook 
walks across a field? He does not hop like a 
thrush or a sparrow, but moves one foot after the 
other, and gives a little jump every now and then. 
One or two always remain on the trees near, to 
give notice of danger, and when these sentinels cry 
" caw-caw " the whole flock rises. They fly away, 
flapping their wings slowly, and drop down one 
by one in another field. 

A friend of mine who lives near a rookery says 
she often sees from her window one or two sen- 
tinel rooks go round every morning and wake up 
the others, and it is very funny to see how the 
lazy ones scramble up in a great hurry at the last, 
so as to be in time to fly away with the rest. 

Though rooks will not allow another party of 
their own kind to join them, they allow starlings, 




jackdaws, and fieldfares to feed with them. A 
Jackdaw moves much Hke a rook, though he is 
a more sprightly bird. He is smaller and has a 
grey patch on his 
head. The Starling 
{see p. 53) is a walk- 
ing bird. Though 
his head and back 
are black, he has so 
many bright colours 
on the tips of his 
feathers that he does 
not look so dark as 
the rook and the 
jackdaw, but very 
bright and gay. 

I wonder why 
these birds like so 
much to follow the 
rooks ? Perhaps it is 
because the rook has 
a keen scent, and 

turns up the earth for food with his long beak. 
The jackdaw and starling only pick up what they 
find above ground, so when the rook turns up the 
earth, they may get some of the food. 





Try to see a rook, a crow, a jackdaw, and a starling, a 
magpie and a jay, and point out how you know them apart. 

 

Besides the birds which live and feed on the land 
there are a great many which live mostly on the 
water. Some of these are called "waders," and 
some are " swimmers " and have webbed feet. We 
read about two waders, the coot and the moorhen, 
in Book II. To-day we will talk about the swim 
ming birds. 

If you live by the seaside, you will know the 
gulls which float on the sea, and often fly a long 
way up the rivers. Gulls come up the river Thames 
as far as London, and feed in the ponds of the 
parks. In the winter it is a pretty sight to watch 
them circling round and round, and catching the 
food which people throw to them. 

You may have seen Cormorants {see p. 38), big 
black birds which fly heavily over the sea, with 
their long necks stretched out and their narrow 
wings beating the air. Then they settle on the 
water, and suddenly jump up and dive down head 
foremost, presently coming up with a fish, which 
it takes them often some time to swallow. 

But if you live in the country near a large lake 
or a river, you are more likely to see a curious little 
swimming bird called the little Grebe or dabchick. 
This is a brown bird with a thin neck and head, 
which paddles about among the reeds on the bank 
of a river, or swims along quietly, diving down 
every now and then to catch water-snails, fish, or 






weeds. You will have to move very quietly if you 
want to get near the dabchick, for it dives down 
at the least alarm and comes up a long way off, out 
of sight. 

If you have not seen any of these web-footed 
birds, nor even a wild duck yet every child knows 






the tame Duck which lives in our farmyards. Our 
ducks and drakes ^vere tamed long, long ago from 
wild ducks, and are still very like them. Let us see 
what we can learn about a duck. 

First I want you to look at her as she waddles 
across the yard. Her feet have a skin between the 
three front toes which joins them together. That is 



to say she is " web-footed." Now notice that, as she 
lifts her foot, the skin folds up like a fan, and when 
she puts her foot down, it spreads out again. When 
she reaches the pond, she glides into the water and 
begins to paddle, using one foot after the other, just 
as you do when you walk. In clear water you can 
see that as she puts her foot forward the skin shuts 
up, as it did when she walked, but when she puts 
it back and strikes the water, it opens and makes 
a paddle, and so she rows herself along. 

Her legs grow far back on her body, so that she 
can use them to twist and turn herself about, and 
she can tip her head and body down into the water 
to look for water-snails and tadpoles, while she 
paddles along with her tail up in the air. 

Next notice how light her body is. It floats quite 
on the top of the water. This is partly because she 
has a layer of light fat under her skin, and partly 
because she has a thick covering of down under her 
feathers. There is a great deal of air caught in this 
down, and this makes her light. 

Do you know why her feathers do not get wet 
and draggled in the water? The reason is very 
curious. Her outer feathers are all smeared with 
oil which she gets from a little pocket near hei 
tail. Look at her when she comes out of the 
water. She presses her beak against her tail and 
then draws the feathers through the beak. When 
she has oiled them in this way, they are water 
proof and keep the wet off her body. 

Next watch her as she feeds. She goes gobble, 
gobble through tlie mud, and often throws her 



"head up to swallow something she has found. Her 
beak is broad and flat. It is hooked at the tip, but 
higher up it is covered with a soft skin full of 
nerves. With this skin the duck feels what is in 
the mud as well as if she saw it. The tip and edges 
of the beak are very horny and sharp, and, both 

above and below, it is lined 
•with, thin strips of horn. 
When she closes her beak 
these strips fit into each 
other and make a strainer 
With her sharp beak she 
cuts the weeds or kills the 
snails. With the strainer 
she sifts the mud and 
keeps the food in her 
mouth, forcing out the 
water with her thick 
tongue. Geese, swans, and all wild ducks have 
feet and beaks much like our farmyard duck. 

You may have seen wild-ducks in the lakes or 
rivers. The drake is a very handsome bird. His 
head and neck are a dark shiny green. He has a 
white collar, and his breast is the colour of a 
chestnut. His wings and back are partly brown 
and partly green. The four middle feathers of his 
tail are a glossy black and curl up. The others 
are grey, edged with white. When the wild drake 
changes his coat in June he puts oif this beautiful 
plumage, and puts on a plain brown and grey suit- 
like the mother duck, till August. Then he begins 
to moult again, and in October is as gay as before. 


The cormorants and gulls have not beaks like the 
duck, for they do not grope in the mud. Their bills 
are sharp and strong for fishing, and their ^ngs 
long for flying. The little dabchick, on the contrary, 
has short wings, as he chiefly floats on the water. 
His beak is not very long, and it has no hook at the 
end. His feet are rather large, but the web is not 
wide as in ducks. 

There are a great many other web-footed birds. 
Try if you can find some. 

Examine a dead duck. Notice the webbed foot, the parts of 
the beak, the thick down, and the glossy oiled feathers not 
wetted in water. Draw the foot of any dead bird you can 
find. 



Almost every morning, when I yvsike, I hear a 
curious cry, " tek-tek-tek," in my garden, and I 
know that if I go out and look, I shall see the cat 
about somewhere. Sometimes many birds "will be 
making the same cry all together, and when the 
cat is on the lawn I have seen the swallows swoop 
down and peck her back, and then rise up again 
before she can turn round. 

For the birds know very well that the cat is 
their enemy, and scold at her when she conies near^ 
especially when they have young ones. 


I wonder if you have ever thought as you lie 
snugly in bed how many dangers there are for the 
little birds outside? The owl prowling along the 





hedge is on the look-out for sitting mothers and 
for young birds. The cat may climb the tree and 
put her sharp claws into the nest. Weasels and 
stoats are hunting about to catch any birds which 



are sleeping near the ground, or even in the trees, 
and snakes like eggs for their early breakfast as 
much as you or I do. 

The fox is a great enemy of the ground birds 
Partridges, pheasants, and grouse dread a fox at 
night, as the fowls and ducks do in the farmyard; 
while in the daytime the hawk is a terror to aU 
birds. The mother lark, on her nest, crouches down 
in the hope that the grass may hide her. The 
father lark, as he soars, rises or falls to try to 
escape. Other little song-birds flutter away to 
the bushes; partridges run to cover, and pigeons 
hide in the wood w^hen a hawk is near. 

All these are the birds' natural enemies; for of 
course animals must kill their food, and we too 
kill birds to eat. But we need not destroy their 
nests nor take their eggs for show, nor catch them, 
as many do, in nets to put them in cages, or to use 
their feathers for ornaments. 

Many birds, which were quite common thirty 
years ago, are rare now because such a number of 
eggs and birds have been taken. So laws have 
been made to protect the little song-birds, birds 
of prey, and sea-birds, as well as partridges and 
pheasants. 

All over England people are now forbidden to 
shoot or snare any wild hh^ds except on their own 
land, or to take their eggs, between the 15th of 
-March and the 1st of August. This leaves the birds 
time to bring up their little ones. And there is a 
special list of birds which people may not disturb, 
even in their own garden, during this "close time." 


I am sure you will be glad to know that the 
lark is one of these birds. 

Then there are some parts of England where 
people are not allowed to take the eggs of wild 
birds at any time. These are places, such as some 
of the Broads in Norfolk, and the sea-shore at 
Slapton Lee in Devonshire, where many birds 
breed. 

You cannot know all these places, but there is 
one very safe rule. Do not take any eggs, nor kill 
any birds ; then you are sure not to do "wrong. 

Watch the birds in the garden, and the fields, 
and the woods. Learn to know where they build 
their nests round your house, and take care they 
are not disturbed. When you wake up in the 
morning listen to their songs. You will soon know 
them, and know too when they are happy, or when 
something is frightening them. Then notice what 
good work they do, eating the slugs and snails, the 
wire-worms and grubs. 

You must drive them away when you see them 
eating your seeds, or your young buds, or the 
sprouting corn. But you can feed them in winter 
to make them your friends, and you will be sur- 
prised how much you can learn about their ways. 




These lessons are intended to be read after the teacher 
has given one or more lectures on the subject. It is not 
necessary to read the book straight through. Different lessons 
are suited for different seasons, and in some cases one lesson 
may serve for a month's work ; the children being encouraged 
to observe and collect. 


I "WONDER if you have ever stopped to think 
how usefvil trees are in the ?\;\^orld. We saw in 
Book III. that plants make the air i^iire for ns to 
breathe. Trees, with their hundreds of leaves, do 
a lar^e part of this work, and they do a great 
deal besides. 

Let us imagine a little tree growing up in the 
wood, or in the field. It may perhaps be eaten 
away by rabbits or squirrels before it is a year 
old. If so, it has been useful as food. But if it 
grows up, it begins even the first year to drop 
some leaves in the autumn, and these help to 
make leyf-mould, and so give food for other 
plants. 

So it goes on each year, making leaves, puri- 
fying the air, and producing leaf-mould. But very 
soon insects begin to make their home in the young 
sapling, for every kind of tree has some insects 

living on it. A moth conies and lays her eggi^ 
under the leaves, and the caterpillars feed on theno 
when they are hatched. A beetle conies and lays 
her eggs in the bark, and the grub feeds there, 
till it turns into a beetle, or til^ the woodpecker or 
the nuthatch find and eat it. 

In this way every tree is quite a little colony 
of living creatures. Then the birds come and sleep 
in its boughs at night and build their nests there 
in the spring. If the trees are elms the rooks 
often choose them for their rookery. If they are 
firs in a wood the woodpigeon ^vill sleep there, or 
pheasants and hawks perch on their branches, 
^lile the thrush and the blackbird spend the night 
in laurels, or hollies and other evergreen trees. 

When the tree has grown big it bears flowers 
and fruits. These fruits, jr the seeds in them, 
serve as food for many creatures. The birds feed 
on the berries, the nuts, and the acorns. The 
squirrel makes its home in the beech-trees, and 
eats all kinds of nuts it can find. The field-mouse, 
hedgehog, and pig make good meals off the beech- 
nuts and acorns on the ground, while we eat the 
fruit of the sweet chestnut and the walnut tree, the 
apples, pears and cherries from the orchard. 

How useful the trees are to man ! They help 
to keep the ground moist and fresh. There is 
always more rain in a country where there are 
trees, and the ground Avould grow parched and 
dry, if it were not for their pleasant shade. How 
the cattle gather under them, when the sun is 
bright, and stand chewing the cud so peacefully 



out of the glare and heat ! And how glad you are 
on your way to school, if you can walk through 
a shady lane instead of along the high road. 
Then they are so beautiful in the spring ; when 
the fresh green leases burst out they make us 
glad to think that every year tree-life begins 
again. 

On the other hand, some trees are so old, 
several hundreds of years, that they remind us 
of times long gone by, and make us love our 
country when we think Mdiat a long history 
those trees could tell. 

But even trees must die at last, and, if they 
are to be of use to us we must cut them down 
before they decay. Then, after the tree is dead, 
how useful it is ! 

Let us just go through one day of your life, 
and see how much of a tree you use. You get 
up in the morning, and the first thing to be 
done is to light a fire with wood. You sit on a 
chair : that is made of wood. You open the door : 
that is of ^'ood too. You take up your umbrella 
when you start for school : the handle was once 
the bough of a tree. You go upstairs to fetch 
your bag : the stairs are made out of planks. 
You set off on your way, and have to cross a 
brook : the bridge is made of wood. You are 
careful to shut the gate of the field : that, too, 
is made of a tree, and so is the paling round the 
school. 

You take your place in class. Your feet rest 
on deal planks which come from the fir-tree. 




You sit on a ^vooden bench. Your slate has a 
wooden frame. Your pen has a wooden handle. 
The teacher puts up a wooden easel and a wooden 
blackboard upon it. She opens the ink-bottle to 
fill the inkstands, and the cork of the bottle comes 
from the bark of a tree, while the ink itself is 
made with acid which comes from a gall made 
by an insect on an oak-tree. 

Dinner-time comes. Surely, now, you will not 
want any wood. You fetch your basket with your 
dinner in it. That may be made of wood-chips or 
willow twigs, and the pastry which you eat is 
made of j)aste, which your mother rolled out on 
a wooden board with a wooden rolling-pin. 

As you come out from school you get a lift in 
a farm-cart, that too is made of wood, and so is 
the wheelbarrow you use, when you get home, 
for wheeling manure into the garden. You put 
your school things away in the old oak-chest in 
the corner, and when yovi go to bed after supper, 
you look up at the old beams across the ceiling 
and fall asleep dreaming of wood everywhere. 

You could add many more things that I have 
forgotten ; and even no^\' we have not reckoned 
up the gums, the turpentine, the oils, the tannin, 
and the many sweet scents which we get from 
trees. Nor have we spoken of boats, and railway 
carriages, nor of the beautiful wood-carvings in 
our churches and other public buildings. Surely 
the world would get on very badly without trees ! 

Name any things made of wood besides those given in the 
/esson. 









We saw in Book III. that some plants live much 
longer than others. Some live for one year only, 
make their seeds and die. These we call arinuals. 
Others live two years. They grow their roots and 
leaves one year, and flower and make their seeds 
the next year. These we call biennials, because bi 
means two. Others live for many years, and are 
called 23e?^ennm/s. Trees are perennials, for they 
live for very many years. There are some oak 
trees more than a thousand years old. 

Yet all these old trees began their lives as little 
seedlings, like the bean you grew on the top of 
the earth in the flower-pot. How, then, have 
they managed to live so long > We shall learn 
this best by looking at a young seedling. 

If you poke about in a wood, you will easily 
find some small plant, either of oak, or beech, or 
hazel, which has grown up from a nut, or an 
acorn trodden into the ground. I am going to 
take an oak tree, because I have one close to my 
door and can give you a picture of it. If you 
get an acorn and stick it in the neck of a bottle 
the same way up as it sits in its cup, and keep 
the bottle full of water, you can grow^ a small oak 
for yourself, and see if yours is like mine. 

First the acorn puts out some roots downwards. 
Then the husk splits, and you can see the two thick 
seed-leaves open, with the growing tip between 



them. This tip now grows steadily upwards and 
Koon puts forth leaves. There may be one, or 

even two, one above the 
other, on the sides of the 
stem. But there will cer- 
tainly be two or three close 
together at the top of the little tree 
by the time autumn comes. At 
the foot of each leaf, nestling up 
to the stem, will be a little bud, and 
at the end of the stem will be a 
stout bud, bigger than all the rest. 

The difference between the oak- 
plant and the bean which we grew in 
Book III. is that the stem is woody.' 
If you get another oak-plant of the 
same age from the wood, and cut off 
its head this is what you will see 
(Fig. 1, p. 13). In the middle there is 
a round white patch, p. This is 
the pith, or soft part, which you 
scoop out of the branch of an 
elder-tree when you make a 
popgun. Next conies a ring of 
soft whitish wood, iv. Outside 
this again is the harl:, b. 

Now you know that water, 
with earthy matter in it, has 
to rise up from the roots and 
go to the leaves, to be made 
into food. It travels up through this ring of living 
wood, and when it comes back it makes new wood 






and new bark just where the wood and the bark 
meet. You know how easy it is to peel the bark 
off wood. That is because the tender new part 
is between them, and gives way easily. 

But as soon as autumn comes, the roots leave 
off taking in water ; and the crude s«p, as it is 


called, does not rise up any more. The stalks of 
the leaves dry up where they join the stem, and 
they fall off. The tree rests for the winter. 

Now watch your little plant next spring. You 
will see the big bud at the tip, and often two 
other buds close to it, begin to grow into branches 
and have leaves of their own. But in a very young 
tree the smaller ones usually die away and the 
trunk grows straight up. However, you can always 
tell where the new growth began in the spring, 
because there is a ring (r, p. 12) left by the scales of 
the buds. The wood of the new piece will be just 




like the wood of the lower piece was last year. 
But that lower piece "will be growing some fresh 
wood and getting bigger (Fig. 2, p. 13). The sap 
will go up and down as before, and a new ring of 
wood (to i2) ^11 form outside the old wood, and a 
v^ery thin new ring of bark inside the old bark. 
So at the end of the second year, while the ne^v 
piece will have only one ring of wood, the old 
piece below the scales will have two rings {iv and 
w2), with a mark between the rings, showing 
where the tree rested in the winter. 

All this is rather difficult to see in such small 
trees, and you must look at the diagrams. But 
if you go into the wood when they are cutting 
down timber, you "will see the rings much more 
distinctly in the older trees, and you will like to 
look at the trunks, and try to make out how old 
the trees are. You cannot be quite sure that you 
count all the years, because as the new wood grows, 
the old is squeezed together, and makes a very hard 
wood, called " heart- wood," in the middle of the 
trunk. But you can be sure that the tree is not 
younger, and most likely much older, than the 
rings you can count. 

Now to come back to our question, how trees 
live to be so old. Year after year they make a 
new ring of wood, narrower and narrower as they 
grow older. Through the younger rings the crude 
sap goes up to the leaves, and the food-sap conies 
down to feed the parts of the tree. Buds tire 
formed every spring on the stems at the foot of 
each leaf, and these buds are Kke new plants. 





They start with fresh strength, making new food 
for the tree, which carries them up on its trunk 
and branches into the Hglit and air. 

The heart-wood of the tree is really dead, and 
sometimes decays away while the outer part of 
the tree is still flourishing. But many of the 
rings of wood far inside the trunk still want 
food, and if you look at a felled tree you can see 
how they get it. Besides the rings, you will see 
some lines (in), like the spokes of a wheel, starting 
from the centre of the trunk and spreading out 
to the bark. These lines are made of pith, like 
that "\ve saw in the middle of the young seedling 
oak. Until they are squeezed away the sap passes 
along them all through the tree. 

There are some trees, such as the palms, which 
you see in hot-houses, which do not grow in rings. 
But these are not English, and do not concern us 
here. 

Get several pieces of tree-branches and tr-y to see the bark, 
the inner bark, the rings of wood and the heart-wood — Lilac, 
Lime, and Elder show the parts well. Oak and Pine show 
heart-wood best. 



When a young tree has made plenty of wood and 
branches, it begins to use some of its buds for 
making flowers. These buds groTV in the same 
places as leaf -buds. In some trees they grow where 
the leaf joins the stem. In others they grow at 
the tips of the twigs. They are generally rounder 
and less pointed than the leaf-buds. 

The flowers of the oak are very small, so you 
had better look out for a horse-chestnut tree and 
gather a bough for this lesson. You will find bvids 
on a horse-chestnut tree almost any time in the 
year, except when it is in full leaf, and then they 
will be very small. 

The best time to look is just at the end of the 
winter, "when the tree is bare. First notice the 
smaller buds, which grow two and two opposite 
each other along the twig. You will see belo^w each 
bud a scar marking the place on which the leaf 
grew last year. This scar is shaped like a horseshoe, 
and has several black spots on it arranged like the 
nails. These spots show where the bundles of tubes 
were, which carried the sap into the leaf. 

Now pick one of the buds to pieces. They are 
^mall, and you will not find it very easy, but you 
can take off the brown sticky scales, and you will 
find inside, first some soft gummy do\\^i, and then 
bhe young green leaves, tightly folded togetheri 
with, a green growing tip between them. 




So if you had left that bud, and it could got food 
enough, it would have grown into a small branch in 
the spring, with leaves on it. But it is very seldom 
that all the buds on a branch grow. The stronger 
ones take the food, and 
the weaker ones either 
die or wait till next year. 

Now look at the buds 
on the tips of the 
branches. They are very |^ 
much larger than those 
growing on the sides, and 
you can examine them 
easily. When you have 
taken away from twelve 
to seventeen sticky scales, 
you will come to the same 3-. 
kind of soft Avliite gummy i- - 
down which you found 
in the leaf-buds, making 
a warm bed for the 
tender growing parts in- 
side. 

But this bud is not 
all leaves like the smaller 
one. It has four small 
bright green leaves, and wrapped up inside them 
is a tiny spike covered with little knobs (f). 

You cannot examine the flowers on this spike 
without a microscope. But if you wait and watch 
till May, you will see others like it gradually open- 
ing out into a lovely branch of flowers, and I think 




you will like them all the better for knowing how 
the tree prepared them last autumn, when it was 
covered with leaves, and wrapped them up warm 
all the winter in sticky buds. 

And while you are waiting for the flowers, look 
at the tree itself. The trunk is smooth and round 
The branches begin to grow out of it about ten feel 
from the ground. They grow two and two opposite 
to each other like the leaves, except where a bud 
has failed. The lower branches, which of course 
are the oldest, stretch out farthest, so that the tree 
rounds off very gracefully up to the top. 

Then, as April comes, the brown scales fall from 
the leaf-buds, and the tree is covered with bright 
green downy leaves. They are each cut into seven 
leaflets, which hang down from the tip of the leaf- 
stalk like a half-opened umbrella. Little by little, as 
they grow stronger, they rise up into a broad leaf 
with seven fingers. It is while they are doing this 
that the flower-buds throw off their scales, the four 
green leaves open out, and the flower spike begins 
to hang out its snow-white flowers, streaked with 
pink and yellow (see p. 10). 

The flowers nearest to the branch open first and 
grow strong. They are perfect flowers, with five 
green sepals and five beautiful crimped petals, and 
have both stamens and seed-box inside. These will 
^orm the chestnuts which ripen in the autumn. The 
flowers nearer to the tip of the spike have only 
stamens inside the petals. They wither away as 
soon as they have shed their pollen-dust. 

If you can get an old flower spike when the 



flowers are withered, and c at the seed-box of a flower 
across, you will see that it has three divisions with 
two little seeds in each. But when you pick up the 
prickly fruit in the autumn, though it burst into 
three parts, there are generally only two horse- 
chestnuts inside (see p. 10), with another very tiny 
One. The two big seeds have starved out the other 
four little ones and grown big and strong. If the 
chestnuts are brown and shiny, they are ripe, and 
will grow if you sow them. 

Though the horse-chestnut is very beautiful in 
the summer, its leaves turn yellow very early 
and fall in August, and then you can see tlie buds 
already formed for next year. All boys know 
that horse-chestnuts are bitter and not good 
eating. The sweet chestnuts, which we roast, come 
from quite a different tree, and are not seeds, 
but fruits. 

Bring a branch of Ilorse-chestniit and examine the buds. 
Find a flower spilce in May ; look at the ovary in June, and 
the fruit in September. 


The horse-chestnut is the only big English tree 
which has large flower-spikes. There are many 
pretty flowering shrubs in the hedge, such as the 
Blackthorn, the May, and the Guelder rose. But 
all the big trees have tiny flowers As some of 
these trees flower before they open their ieo^ves, 



you can see their blossoms. So we will look at a 
few. 

If you live where there are many bees, and 
where there are any trees of the conmion Sallow 
Willow growing in the hedges, or the woods, go out 
some sunny day in March, and lie down under one 
of the trees and listen. 

Before long you will hear a buzzing, which will 
go on as long as the sun is bright. For the bees 
have wakened from their long winter sleep, and 
want honey and pollen to make bee-bread. There 
are very few flowers open in March and, as the 
sweet smell of honey comes from the blossoms of 
the willow, the bees are quick to find them out. 

Perhaps you will ask me how you are to know 
a Sallow^ Willow, You know it quite well, though 
you may not know the name. It is a big shrubby 
tree, with a purple-brown stem, w^hich grows in 
the hedges and woods, and from which people 
cut branches before Palm Sunday, and call them 
palms. 

All up the twigs you will see in March and 
April round soft bodies about as big as thimbles 
growing now on one side now on the other. It is 
into these that the bees are poking their heads. 
You remember the catkins which we saw on the 
nut-trees in Book I. These soft bodies clinging 
close to the willow stems are also catkins. In 
willows they stand up, instead of hanging down as 
they do on the nut-trees, and on the sallow willow 
tjiey hug the stem. 

But now I want yoi: to look a little further. 






rhe tree under which you sit may ha\e broad 
yellow catkins (2, plate, p. 20), and if you gathei 
a branch and look closely at it, you will see 
the yellow anthers standing out all rooind the 
catkin. Children call these "golden palms." But 
you may find, not so very far away, another of 
the same kind of tree, on which the catkins 
are soft and grey 
(1, plate, p. 20). 
They are much 
longer and nar- 
rower than the 
golden catkins. 
Children call them 

' silver pussy - 
palms." 

Gather a branch 
from each of these 
trees and take 
them to school. 
When you pick 
them to pieces, 
you will find that each catkin is ma^do up of a 
number of tiny flowers. In the golden catkins 
each flower is only a little scaly leaf (l, 2) 
with two stamens growing on it. No ! I forgot. 
There is something else, for at the bottom of each 
scaly leaf is a small cup (fl), holding a drop of 
honey. So you see there are i)lenty of drops of 

honey in a catkin. 

Then if you pick the silver-pussy-palm to pieces, 
you will find the same honey cup («) at the 




bottom of the scale, but instead of stamens, there 
is a Kttle seed-box or ovary (o) shaped hke a bottle, 
with a crumpled stigma (s). 

^ Now you see the use of the honey. As the dust- 
bags and the seed-boxes are on different trees, the 
flowers have to tempt the bees to carry the pollen. 
It is wise to plant willows near where bees are 
kept, for they get plenty of honey from them in 
the spring. The Osier willow, which grows in the 
marshes, and is used for making baskets, is in 
bloom at the same time as the sallow. But the 
common English willow which grows into a large 
tree, and the Crack willow whose branches break 
off so easily when you bend them, bloom later, 
when their narrow pointed leaves are out. They 
all bloom early, however, and when the tiny seeds 
covered Tvith down are blown out of the catkins 
many a little bird uses them to line its nest. 

Another tree, which blooms before its leaves 
come, is the English poplar, which groTvs by the 
streams, or in the woods. Poplars have their two 
kinds of flowers on different trees, like the ^villows. 
But they have no honey, and no bees come near 
them. I think that if you have any poplars in your 
woods and watch them, you will guess how they 
manage. For when the wild March winds are 
blowing, the long hanging catkins swing to and 
fro, and the dry pollen-dust is blown through the 
lair from tree to tree. 

I wonder if you know which tree I mean by the 
English poplar? Not those tall stiff trees which 
point straight up to the sky. Those come from 



TREES WITH CATKIN FLOWERS. 



25 



Italy and are called Lombardy poplars. The 
English poplars are graceful trees with very broad 



leaves hanging on long stalks. The white poplar 
has soft white hairs under its leaves, and the leaves 
of the aspon or trembling poplar are silky under- 
neath. The leaves turn on their long stalks when 

 

the wind blows and look very pretty as they show 
their white sides. 

One other tree you must look for, which has it? 
stamens in long loose catkins and its ovary in a 
little bud with scales round it. This is our friend 
the oak after it has grown into a large tree. The 
oak flowers in the spring, just as the leaves are 
coming out. You will easily see the catkins waving 
in the wind, but the flowers which will grow into 
acorns are very small and grow singly, or in pairs, 
between the leaf -stalk and the stem. Each one has 
a number of small scales round it, which by-and-by 
will harden into the cup of the acorn. 

But the oak is such a i important tree that we 
must talk of it in a separate lesson. 

Bring willow branches in March with stamen-catkins, and 
others with seed-forming catkins. Look for the honey cup 
Bring leaves and flowers of the English poplai*. 


I WONDER if you have any woods near you with 
oak trees growing close together, or mixed with 
beech and ash trees. This is the way they are 
grown, when they are to be cut into long planks, 
or poles, and most likely there will be some wood, 
where you can stop and look at them on your way 
home from school. 

They will have straight, smooth trunks; some 
twenty, some thirty, some perhaps fifty feet liigh, 
before the branches spread out above. Yet you 



know that your seedling oak has buds, first on one 
side, then on the other, all up the stem. Ho"w is it 
that these buds have not groTVTi into branches? 

The reason is that in a thick w'ood, where the 
trees crowd each other, every tree wants to raise 
its head up to the light. So- in tae spring when the 
leaves and buds open out at the top of the little 
tree, and the crude sap rises up to them from the 
roots, the tree wants so much to use for growing 
up higher that only a small quantity goes down 
again to make new wood. So the buds lower down 
do not get enough food to grow, and they either 
die or become dormant. That is, they remain 
waiting for another opportunity, which often never 
comes. For this reason oaks in a wood grow 
taller and taller with only a crown of branches 
and leaves near the top. 

But if you can find an old oak out in the open 
field, or at the edge of the wood, ^vhere it has 
plenty of room, you will see that it has grown 
differently. The trunk is much larger, and the 
branches grow out lower down. In many big oaks 
a man can reach the lower boughs as he stands 
under it.' The branches are very heavy and stretch 
out widely all round, so that an old oak tree covers 
a great deal of space in open ground. If the trunk 
were not very strong it could not bear the weight 
of such huge branches. But it is very broad at the 
bottom and then curves in and rises like a stout 
pillar till it becomes broad again where the 
branches divide away from it. 

When Smeaton, the great engineer, built the 


Eddystone lighthouse, he shaped it like the trunk 
of an oak, and the lighthouse stood firm against 
wind and waves for more than a hundred years. 

The oak has a very thick strong root from which 
long ropy roots run out all round the tree. I will 
tell you a way by Tv^hich you may know how far the 
roots of a tree spread underground. Look at the 
branches and see how far they stretch out from 
the trunk, for the roots will reach just as far 
underground as the branches do above ground. 

The reason of this is very interesting. You will 
remember that the tips of the roots are the mouths 
of a plant. They drink in the Tvater. Now when it 
rains, the raindrops trickle from leaf to leaf till 
they come to the tips of the branches, and then they 
drip down and sink into the ground. The roots 
would get very little rain-water if they stopped 
under the tree where you and I stand to keep out 
of the rain. But as the tree grows, the roots find 
their way farther and farther out, till they reach 
the place where the drip will be. 

You Avill find it useful to know this in gardening 
and farming, for tree roots are often very trouble- 
some. 

When you have looked at the rugged bark of 
the old oak, which is so useful for tanning leather, 
look up at the branches. They twist and turn in all 
directions, and there is a very thick joint wherever 
a new branch starts. 

You can see the reason of this, if you look at 
your young tree (p. 12), or at a t^vig of the old tree. 
There is not one bud at the tip of the twigs as there 





was in the horse-c4iestniit, but two, three, or some- 
times more. All these buds crowd each other, and 
vhe middle one generally dies. The others go off 
different ways, and so make what carpenters call 
" knee-joints." These were used for shipbuilding in 
olden days, because they are very strong. But now 
that ships are made of iron, knee-timber is not so 
much wanted, 
and straight 
planks and poles 



are more valu- 
able. So it is 
best now to plant 
oaks in woods, 
where their stems 
grow straight 
and smooth. 

Oak timber has 
always been valu- 
able. The beams 
of Westminster 
Hall, which was 
built about nine 
hundred years ago, were made of Durmast Oak, and 
were only recently i*epaired. Man}' country cottages 
have old chests and carved chairs in them quite 
as old as this. The heartwood of the oak is very 
firm and strong, and this is why the old song says : 

"Heaits of Oak are our ships, 
Hearts of Oak are oui- men." 

You can see the trunk and V)ranches of the oak 

best in winter. Then when April is nearly over, a 


pretty crfmson colour comes on all the buds, the 
leaves open out, and the loose catkins hang down 
between them, while the tiny acorn flowers nestle 
between the leaf -stalk and the stem. 

When the leaves are fully out, and the acorns 
are beginning to form, try if you can find the two 
kinds of English oak. Their leaves are much the 
same shape, long and cut into deep divisions. But 
the leaves of the Common Oak (1, p. 30) have very 
short leaf -stalks, they almost touch the stem, while 
the acorns stand on long stalks. In the other tree 
called the Durmast Oak the leaves usually have 
longer stalks, and the acorns have none. 

The evergreen oak, which is often grown in 
gardens, was brought from Italy. Its leaves are 
something like the leaves of the holly, so it is called 
the holm oak or holly oak. 

Get a branch of oak and notice the crowded buds. Get a 
log of oak and notice the dark heartwood and the rings round 
it. Also the rugged bark. Try to find the two kinds of English 
oak. Notice the scales grown together in the acoi-n cup. 



The oak feeds more creatures than any other 
English tree. Not only do the pigs, the hedgehogs, 
the squirrels, and the field-mice feed on the acorns, 
but more than fifty kinds of insects get their food 
from some part of the tree. 

Many of these are too small for you to find, but 
you will enjoy looking out for others. If you 







examine an oak-tree in May, you will most likely 
Rnd some of its leaves rolled up, either from the 
tip towards the stalk, or from side to side. Undo 
this roll and you will find a caterpillar inside, or 
perhaps a chrysalis. There are two kinds of 
caterpillars which roll up oak leaves. One, which 
is called simply the Oak-moth caterpillar, is large. 
It rolls up the leaf rather untidily, and spins a 
cocoon round itself 
inside, in the shape 
of a Httle boat. The 
moth when it comes 
out has bright green 
wings with two white 
bands on them. 

The other cater- 
pillar, which you are 
almost sure to find, 

does its work more tidily. It makes a very neat 
roll, and fastens it together with fine threads. 
Then it feeds on the inner rolls till it goes to sleep, 
and turns into a moth. If you shake an oak-tree in 
June numbers of these little moths will often fly 
out. They are called the Green Oak-moth, though 
their hind wings are browoi. They are much 
smaller than the oak-moth, whose caterpillar spins 
the boat cocoon. 

Another insect which you may find, is the grub 
of the great Stag Beetle. For this you will have to 
cut into the trunks of old trees, where the big grub 
hollows out a bed for itself under the bark. It 
stays there and feeds on the wood of the tree for 



three or four years, till it turns into the beetle. 
You remember that the woodpecker taps with his 
beak as he climbs the trees. It is grubs like these 
that he is trying to find. 

But the most curious homes on an oak-tree are 
the galls made by mother insects, which lay their 
eggs on some part of the tree. Every country child 




knows the red -brown rosy -cheeked oak-apple, 
which grows on the tips of the oak-twigs, and 
which many people mistake for fruit. Boys used 
to stick these in their hats on the twenty-ninth 
of May, because Charles the Second, who hid from 
his enemies in an oak-tree, came back to his throne 
on that day. 

Instead of sticking it into your caps, cut the 


oak-apple across ^vith a sharp knife. You will 
find that it is soft and spongy, and is divided into 
a number of small cells. In each of these cells 
there will be either a grub, or a cocoon, or a perfect 
fly ready to come out. Or perhaps the home may 
be empty, all the inmates having flown away. 

Let us see how this oak-apple came to be there. 
Early in the spring a small wasp-fly, called a 
Cynips, settled on the twig, and pierced the bark 
^vith a sharp-pointed tube. She carries this tube 
coiled up at the end of her body, till she wants to 
use it. Then she darts it out into the twig and 
squeezes some juice into the hole, together with 
several eggs. 

In a very short time a swelling rises up, and the 
spongy oak-aj)ple grows round the eggs, each one 
being in a cell by itself. So when the grubs are 
hatched they find plenty of soft food to eat, till 
they spin their cocoons. 

Another of these flies lays its eggs on the loose 
catkins. You may easily find them hanging like 
little brown currants on the stalk (3, p. 39), after the 
flowers have withered. For though the stalk falls 
off as a rule, yet when these galls ai-e on it, it 
remains hanging till the fly comes out. 

These "currant galls" have each one grub in 
them, and so too have the galls which you will 
find under the leaves. There are at least two 
kinds of leaf -galls. One is bright red, and is called a 
" cherry gall." The other is very small, pink, hairy, 
and flat. There are a great many of these under 
each leaf, and they are called "oak-spangles" (2, p. 39), 



The grub remains in these galls after the leaves 
have fallen, so you will be able to find them. 

The next gall (1, p. 39) I am sure you will thinV 
is a bud. It is called the " artichoke gall," and really 
begins in the oak-bud, in which the fly lays her eggs 
early in the spring. Then instead of growing into 
a twig with green leaves, the bud covers itself with 
scales, and a number of grubs are hatched inside. 

Last of all there are the big brown galls, specially 
called " oak-galls " (4, p. 39). They grow half-way 
down the twigs, and remain hanging on the tree all 
the winter, after the flies have flo^vn out. This gall 
was first seen in England about sixty years ago, in 
1840. It has spread very fast, and is hurtful to 
the trees, for it sucks out a great deal of sap. It 
is very like the galls ^vhich we get from Asia, in 
order to use the acid in them for making ink. 

Many other trees have galls on them besides 
the oak, and I advise you when you find a curious 
lump or a strange-shaped bud, unlike anything you 
expect to find on a tree, to cut it open and see if 
there is a grub inside. 

Find as many different kinds of oak-gall as you can. Find 
the leaf-rolling caterpillar's, and try to find the grub of the 
stag-beetle. 

 

As you go through the woods in spring, you 
should watch the trees when they break out into 
leaf One of the prettiest is the Beech Tree (1, plate, 
p. 36). You may know it in the middle of winter by 





its olive-grey bark, its tall, smooth trunk with a 
broad crown of branches on the top, and its brown 



sharp-pointed buds which grow one after the other, 
now on one side, now on the other of the stem. 
How different thev are from the thick buds of the 




horse-chestnut, and yet they keep the Kttle leaves 
inside quite as safe and warm. 

Pick one of them to pieces in the early spring, 
just before they burst open (see p. 41). You will find, 
first, a number of shiny brown scales folded tight one 
over the other. Then inside these, some transparent 
scales as soft as silk, wrapping round the delicate 
tiny leaves which are folded up like a fan, and have 
a fringe of silvery hairs on them. Lastly, in the 
middle, the tender growing tip lies safely hidden. 

A few days later these bright green leaves will 
open, and the scales hang loosely below them, 
while the silken fringe now shows as hairs 
under the leaves. Each leaf is oval and notched 
at the edge, and the twigs on which they grow 
drooj) at first, and then slowly raise themselves. 
By the time the leaves are full grown the brown 
clusters of flowers are hanging among them. 

Those with the stamens in them are soft and 
silky, and hang on long, thin stalks ; but those 
with the seed-boxes, stand up on short stalks near 
the end of the twigs. There are two or three of 
them on each stalk, with their sticky horns stand- 
ing up, and a number of prickly scales round them. 

These scales are like those we saw round the 
acorn. They grow into a hard husk covered with 
prickles, and by-and-by quite shut in the two or 
three little nuts. But when autumn comes, the 
"beech-mast" (2, p. 36), as it is called, falls dowTi, 
the husk bursts open into four pieces, and then 
you see inside the three-cornered nuts with the 
withered horns still on the top. 





Now, why do you think these scales grow into 
such a hard husk and shut in the fruit, and why 
do they burst in the autumn? Because the squir- 
rels and field-mice feed chiefly on beech-nuts, and 
if there were no husk to pro- 
tect the nuts while they are 
green, they would be eaten 
before they were ripe. But 
now the husk falls and bursts, 
just when they are ready to 
grow. The tree can spare a 
good many to be eaten, if the 
squirrels and other animals 
tread a few^ into the ground or 
bury them so that they grow. 
Beech trees spring up so well 
from seed that there is no 
need to plant them. But if 
you want to keep a beech 
wood healthy and cut it 
down for timber you must 
take care of it. The trees live 
for more than two hundred 
years, though they are ready 
to be cut down when they are 
about ninety years old. 

Good foresters cut down 
one block at a time, so that there is always some 
part of the wood getting ready for timber. In 
the part they are going to cut, they first clear 
away the other kinds of trees and the young 
stunted beeches, so as to let in the light and air. 





Then they wait for a year or two, till there 
comes a season when the beech-mast is good, and 
the seeds are strong and will grow well. This 
happens generally about every three or four 
years. Then they begin to thin out the trees for 
timber, and so to leave room for young seedlings to 
grow up and begin a new crop. 

After this they go on cutting down some every 
year, and clear that piece of the wood in about ten 
years or more. By that time the new beech-trees 
have a good crown of branches and leaves on the 
top and go on and grow, while the forester begins 
to cut down another part of the wood. 

If the beech-tree is pretty in spring, it is still 
more lovely in the autumn, when its leaves turn a 
bright red, and by-and-by fall and make a lovely 
carpet of leaves in the wood. The young beech- 
trees keep their dead leaves on all through the 
winter, and so do beech-hedges, which are kept cut 
and not allowed to grow into trees. 

There is another tree you know well, which 
shuts up its fruit in a husk made of prickly scales. 
This is the sweet or Spanish chestnut (3, p. 36), 
which the Romans brought to our country, and 
which now grows in the woods, or is often planted 
in the avenues leading to big houses. It opens its 
leaves later than the beech, and does not bloom 
till July. Still by October the nuts are ripe, and 
the husks burst open on the ground. And when 
you pick up the nuts to take them home to roast, 
you may notice the dry remains of the flower 
making » kind of bristling fringe on their points 




(4, p. 36). Quite late in the autumn the chestnut is 
a lovely tree. Its long narrow leaves, cut in sharp 
points at the edge turn a beautiful golden brown 
and hang on a long time. 

Many beams of old houses are made of chestnut, 
and the trunks of the young trees are made into 
hop-poles. Beech-wood is used very largely for 
making chairs. 

The Birch and the Alder are both trees with 
catkins and hard-shelled fruits like the beech and 
the oak. They flower in the early spring before 
the leaves are fully out. The alder grows near 
streams or on wet ground. The birch you will find 
in the woods, and know it by its slender, graceful 
trunk, marked with brown, yellow and silvery 
streaks, its purple-brown twigs, and its dark green 
leaves — these smell very strong after rain, because 
the resin oozes from them. Some diseased birches 
have large tufts of twigs growing on the upper 
branches, looking like crows' nests. 

Bring, in spring, a beech branch with its buds. Bring, in 
autumn, beech-nuts and chestnuts in their husks. Compare a

seed. Find Birch and Alder fruits. 

 
Pines, firs, and larches grow in almost all parts oi 
England. They are very interesting and useful 
trees. They all form their seeds in woody cones, 
and their leaves are very narrow or needle-shapedj 
quite unlike the leaves of most other trees. 





A large part of the timber we use comes from 
pines and firs, grown in Norway and other countries. 
It is called pine-wood and deal. No doubt you 
have noticed the small round jjieces called " knots " 
in deal, and have poked them out, leaving a hole. 
These are places where branches grew and broke 
off, and then the trunk closed round them ; they 
are common in deal and pinewood. The sap in 
these trees is very resinous and they are tapped 
for turpentine. If you walk in a pine wood, or 
crush the leaves of a pine or fir, you will notice 
the strong scent of this resinous juice. 

Every country child has picked up fir cones, and 
you may easily find three different kinds, those 
belonging to the Scotch pine, the Spruce fir, and the 
Larch. Of these three, only the Scotch pine is a 
native of Great Britain, the other two have been 
brought from abroad. 

There were once dense forests of Scotch pine in 
England, but these have been cut down long ago, 
and the pine woods we have now, have grown up 
fron\ the seeds of trees brought from the great 
forests in Scotland, Norway, and France. It is a tall 
tree with spreading branches and a trunk covered 
with a red or brown scaly bark. Perhaps you know 
it as Scotch fir, for people confuse these two names, 
and call the same tree " j)ine " or " fir," though you 
may know the difference if you look at the cones. 

The dark-green leaves of the Scotch pine are 
very narrow, and about two inches long (see col- 
oured plate). They grow hco together in a sheath 
of brown scales. Its cones have no stalks, and 



 

they bulge out at the bottom, and taper away to a 
blunt point at the vipper end. They are made of a 
number of thick woody scales which look as if they 
were folded back at the top, making a solid thick 
knob with a brown scaly spot where the tip ends 
{see p. 45). These scales fit over each other so 
tightly that, before the cone is ripe, not even a 
drop of rain can get in, and they take two or three 
years to ripen. Sometimes they hang all the time 
on the tree. Sometimes they fall off earlier. As 
they ripen, the woody scales bend outwards and 
you can see two thin, transparent scales inside 
each, which look like the wings of a fly. They 
stand upright against the woody scale. 

Shp a knife carefully down under these, right 
to the bottom and pull them out. You will find 
a seed at the end of each, if you have not broken 
the tender transparent membrane. 

For these are "winged seeds, which have no 
seed-box over them, but grow naked inside the 
woody scale. After a time they fall out and are 
blown away by the wind. If you get a cone that 
is too old they will be gone. 

kW trees with cones have these winged seeds, 
and the cones of true pines are very much alike. 
You will easily know the Cluster pine, which has 
been brought from France and is found in many 
English woods among the Scotch j)ines. Its large 
cones grow in clusters roand the branches, four or 
sometimes eight together. They are larger and 
browner than the cones Of the Scotch pine and 
they often remain a great many years on the tree. 







The Spruce fir (2, p. 45) is very different from 
the Scotch pm^?. Its spreading branches grow 
nearly down to the ground, and its needle-shaped 
leaves, which are barely an inch long grow singly 
on the stem. Its cones are long and narrow and 
the scales are not so thick as in pines. But 
the chief difference is that the 
tips are not bent back 
into knobs, they are 
polluted and 
bend in a little, 
and by this 

you may 
know fir- 
cones from 
pine-cones. 
The firs have two 
seeds inside each scale 
like the pine, but these 
ripen in one year. The 
spruce fir came from Nor- 
LARCH TWIG BEARING CONES, way, aud uow grows all 

over England 
The Larch, which came from Switzerland, and 
the Cedar, which came from Lebanon in Palestine, 
both grow their seeds in cones, but they are rather 
different from the pines and firs. Their needle- 
leaves are very thin and grow in tuffs eighteen 
or twenty together in the same sheath of scales. 
The cones cf the cedar stand upright and are 
shaped like an egg, but the tree does not often 
bear cones in England. 






Larch cones are quite small, not more than an 
inch in length ; they grow along the twigs in a row. 
The woody scales do not fit very tightly together. 

I think you 
can find the cones 
of all these trees 
except the cedar. 
Of course you 
must look for fir 
and larch cones 
in the autumn, 
because they 
ripen each year, 
but pine-cones 
are on the trees 
all the year 
round. If you 
look at any of 
these trees in the 
spring and early 
summer, you will see their 
stamen - catkins hanging 
from the branches, and 
the yellow pollen blowing 
about in clouds so as to 
tall on the young cones. 

'Pines, firs, and cedars are evergreen trees. Their 
leaves remain on the tree three years or more; 
and as the branches are not of the same age, the 
leaves fall ofP in difPerent years, so that the trees 
are always green. But the larch sheds its leaves 
every year, and you may easily know it in the 




autumn by its bare drooping boughs covered with 
small brown cones. 

Pines and firs will flourish in very poor soil and 
their seeds grow up easily. If you are near a pine 
wood, or a wood of mixed trees with pines or firs 
in it, try and find a seedling tree. It is curious to 
look at, for it shoots up with a long, thin stalk, and 
carries up the seed-coat with it. When this coat 
falls off, you see five or six long seed-leaves under- 
neath, and in the middle of them a bud with the 
real pine or fir leaves. 

There is another tree which you know well, 
which has needle-shaped leaves. They grow all 
round the stem, two together in each sheath, but 
they are flattened down on two sides of the stem 
like the featherlets of a feather. This is the Yew 
tree (see p. 49), which you find so often in church- 
yards. It does not bear cones. Its naked seeds sit 
each one in a red juicy cup. The stamen-catkins 
are not on the same tree as the red cups, but if you 
search well you will find them on another yew tree. 

Bring in a bunch of the Scotch pine and the Spruce fir. 
Compare the cones of the two trees. Try to find a branch 
of Cedar, a branch of the Larch with cones, a seedling pine or 
fir, a branch of Yew with stamen flowers in March, and another 
with the red cup and naked seed in the autumn. 


There is no country in tlie world where the hedge- 
rows are so beautiful as in England. Whether we 
look at the neatly trimmed hedges round our 




gardens, or the roughly trimmed fences between 
the fields, they each have their beauty. Perhaps 
the most delightful of all, to look at, are the hedges 
which are not cut more than once in six years. 
But these are not good for the fields. 

Let us look first at the garden hedges. Have you 
ever thought that these are all made of young trees, 
clipped so that they remain only branches and 
leaves, and do not grow tall trunks? A box hedge 
is made of box trees closely cut. The holly hedge, 
whose prickly leaves are so useful in preventing the 
cattle from breaking through, would grow into tall 
trees if left alone. I know a garden in Devonshire 
where there are holly trees thirty feet high, growing 
here and there in a holly hedge. 

The hawthorn fence is the same as the May-tree 
which grows on the lawn. The beech hedge is made 
of beech trees, kept well clipped, and the dead leaves 
hang on it in winter, as they do on young beeches. 
The yew hedge is the same as the big yew tree in 
the churchyard, and it is well to be careful how you 
plant it anyAvhere near cattle and horses, for in a 
hard winter they sometimes eat the poisonous leaves 
and die. 

But each of these hedges is made of only one 
kind of tree. They are not nearly so interesting as 
the mixed hedges which grow between the fields. 
There we find blackberries and nuts and all sorts of 
curious fruits and flowers. 

Do you know the Blackthorn bush, whose small 
white flowers grow on its black stem, almost before 
winter is over, and while it has no leaves ? If you 




do, 1 expect you know that you vnW. find purple sloes 
on it in the autumn, under its small dark-green 
leaves, and you can gather the fruit to make sloe 
syrup or sloe wine. The blackthorn is not a good 
hedge plant, for its roots wander far out into the 
field, and it often grows into a tree and so leaves a 
gap in the fence. 

The Hawthorn or May is much better, for it 
grows into a thick quickset hedge, if it is properly 
cut, and the cattle do not break through it, because 
of its thorns. But you cannot use the fruit of the 
hawthorn, you must leave the haws for the birds. 

Then, in the hedge, or the wood, you will most 
likely find the Crab-apple tree, with its spreading 
branches, often covered with thorns. It has oval 
leaves ^vith sharp points, which are dowaiy under- 
neath when they are young. Its rosy pink-and- 
white blossoms come out in May, and in the autumn 
you will find the red crab-apple in their place. This 
fruit is sour and bitter. 

Another hedgerow treo is tlie W ild Cherry, ^wdiose 
fruit feeds the birds in the summer, and helps to 
keep them away from the corn. It is a bushy shrub 
with a red bark and blue-green egg-shaped leaves, 
very much notched round the edge. Its flowers 
grow on short stalks four or five from one point 
like our garden cherries, and the fruit, when it is 
ripe, is a bright red. If you live in Wales, or the 
middle or north of England, you may find another 
tree called the Bird-cherry (1, p. 56), whose fiowers 
grow along a thin stalk, and its fi-uit is black. 
But be sure you find the right one with long, 




drooping flower clusters, for many people call the 
wild dwarf cherry by this name. 

The blackthorn, hawthorn, crab-apple, and cherry 
all belong to the rose family, which, j^ou remember, 
has so many fruit-bearing plants in it. So does 
the pretty Rowan tree (plate, p. 51), often called the 
Mountain Ash, because its leaves are cut into leaf- 
lets ver3^ like those of the ash-tree. You will find the 
small white flowers of the Rowan tree (see l,p. 51) open 
in May. But you will like it best in autvimn Avhen the 
clusters of beautiful red berries are ripe. Perhaps 
you have one over your gate, for they were often 
planted there when people believed in witches, as 
they were supposed to keep them away. 

I must find room to tell you of two more hedge- 
1 ow shrubs. One is the Guelder Rose (2, p. 56), which 
has dark-green leaves cut into three or five points 
with a jagged edge. These leaves turn a lovely red 
in the autumn. Its white flowers grow in a flat 
cluster. The outer ones are large and have neither 
stamens nor seed-box in them. Their use is to 
attract the bees and flies, which come to the smaller 
flowers in the middle to fetch honey. These middle 
flowers are perfect and so the insects help them to 
form seed. The guelder rose has beautiful coral- 
red berries in the autumn. 

The other bush, which grows about five feet high 
in the hedge, is called the Spindle tree (2, p. 51), 
because its wood is used for making spindles and 
skewers. It has a smooth, grey stem and narrow, 
green leaves, which are very poisonous. You wiH 
scarcely notice j<^s small green-wbUc flfuvcrs in Ma 





But in the autumn it has a lovely and curious fruit. 
Four red seed-boxes gro^sv together in a clump on 
a short stalk. They lock very quaint, and if you 








open them you will find that the seed inside is 
covered with a blight orange-coloured membrane. 

Find the flowers and fruit of the hlackthorn, may, apple 
and wild cherry, rowan tree, guelder rose- and spindle tree. 




There is not room to grow large trees in a 
cottage garden, but many flowering shrubs can 
be planted in corners, and some of them are very 
lovely. The first to bloom in the year is the Japan 
pear, JPyrus japonica (plate, p. 61). It grows on 
many cottage walls, and makes them bright when 
the trees are bare of leaves. Its deep-red buds are 
showing even in January, and by the end of Feb- 
ruary the w'all is covered with them. They are like 
pear blossoms in shape, and grow in little bunches 
close against the stem. If you have not got one 
you will easily find a sucker, growing out from 
some neighbour's plant, and it is not difficult to rear. 
In the autumn you will see its hard, green fruit. 

Soon after the Japan pear is in full bloom 
the Rihes, or "flowering currant," will be showing 
its red tassels in most gardens. It was first brought 
from North America, and has spread all over Eng- 
land. You will easily know it, because its leaves 
are very like those of the currant-bushes in the 
kitchen garden, and its pretty hanging clusters 
of red or pink flowers are shaped like the little 
green blossoms of our currants and gooseberries 
Then in the autumn it has hanging bunches of 
dark berries, which are not good to eat. A piece 
of Ribes cut oft" and stuck in the ground will grow 
without any trouble. 

Another very pretty bush flowers in early summer. 






This is the Barberry, whose small scarlet fruits 
used at one time to be put inside sugar plums. 
The barberry is an interesting shrub, for it has 
turned some of its leaves into thorns, so that at 
each joint there is a three-pronged thorn, as well 
as the smooth, fringed leaves. The wild 
barberry has yellow flowers 
with bright red anthers, but 
there is a garden kind with 
ever-green leaves, 
which has deep 
orange-coloured 
flowers. They are 







small and 
, hang in a 
long spray, 
and if you are 
clever you can 
?A try an experiment 
with either the wild 
or garden barberry. 
Look carefully at one of the flowers and you 
will see that the six stamens are spread out, one 
lying down vipon each petal. At the bottom of 
the petal, near the middle of the flower, are two 
bags, out of which oozes honey in drops. The 
sticky stigma on the top of the seed-box stands 
up in the middle of the flower. 




Now take a needle and touch one of the stamens 
fit its base, just where the honey drops are. It will 
jump up, as if moved by a spring, and touch the 
sticky stigma, then after a Httle "vvhile it ^vill fall 
doTV n again. Now when a bee puts her head in for 
honey she irritates the stamen so that it jumps up 
and hits her and she carries the pollen-dust to 
another flower. Or the anther leaves some pollen 
on its own stigma, before it falls down again. 

But we must go on, for when the " March winds 
and April showers bring forth May flowers " there 
will be plenty of shrubs to look at. There is the 
Spanish Broom, with its bright yellow blossoms 
shaped like a pea-flower. You can find wild 
broom growing on the heaths. It is very like 
gorse, only it has smooth, green stems, and no 
prickles. But in the wild broom the blossoms 
grow^ singly on the stem, while in Spanish broom 
they form bright yellow clusters. The broom has 
no honey, but the bees come to it for pollen-dust to 
make bee-bread. 

If there is a Lilac bush growing near the broom 
you will notice how lovely the two colours, yellow 
and lilac, look together. You can make a very 
pretty nosegay from the two shrubs. But you 
will make a more graceful one, if you can find 
a Laburnum with its long sprays of golden blos- 
som. The laburnum has plenty of honey in its 
flowers, and, as the bees have to gnaw a lump to 
get at it, they often stop a long time at each 
flower, and you may see many on one tree. 
Laburnum pods are like small pea-pods, but take 





care not to eat the seeds in them, for they ax"e very 
poisonons. 

Next the Rhododendrons will be opening their 
beautiful bunches of red-purple flowers among 
their glossy, green leaves. These come from 
North America. But the Elderbush, which grows 
in the corner, making a pleasant shade over a 
little seat, is a true English shrub, which almost 
deserves to be called a tree. It does not bloom 
much before July, but it is one of the first trees 
to put out its leaves in the early sj)ring. Though 
it is not tall, it has very thick stems, and its bark is 
rough and corky. 

You must take the young branches if you want 
to make pop-guns, for in the old ones the pith 
is crushed up into quite a tiny space by the rings 
of wood outside. The leaves of the elder grow 
opposite to each other on the stem, and each leaf 
is cut into seven or nine leaflets, with one at the 
end. The small w^hite flowers grow in very large 
flat clusters, and leave the sweet elder -berries 
behind them in the autunni. 

If you have not an elder tree in the garden, you 
will very likely have a Snowball tree (see plate). 
This is a garden kind of Guelder rose. Its blossoms 
are not in a flat bunch as they are on the wild tree. 
They grow in a ball and they have no stamens or 
seedbox in them, so they make no seeds. But the 
leaves turn purple in the autumn and are very lovely. 

By this time the big purple Clematis will be 
out over the porch. It will last in bloom till 
October, and behind it on tl^e wall grows the 





Myrtle, which will be covered with white flowers 
in August. We all know the myrtle so well that 
it is difficult to believe that it is not a British 
shrub. It came from the south of France, and 
now grows in all warm parts of England, keeping 
our walls green all the year round. Its oval 
leaves give a delightful scent from the little pockets 
of oil, which you may see if you look through the 
leaf at the light. 


Next to the oak, the two hardwood trees which are 
most useful are the ash and the elm. Both these 
trees grow in the hedgerows as well as in the open 
fields, and they both blossom quite early in the 
year, before they put forth their leaves. 

You may know Ash stems anywhere, even in 
winter, by two things. First by the tips of its 
branches, which are flat, as if they had been pressed 
under a weight. And secondly by its black buds 
shaped like little pyramids (see p. 65). No other 
tree has black buds like these. The trunk is an 
ash-grey colour, and the branches grow very grace- 
fully, first di[)ping do^vn from the boughs and then 
tilting up again like the horns of a deer. 

In April the ash-buds on the side branches near 
to the tip begin to open out into clusters of purple- 
black flowers (2). Each flower is very small. It has 
no flower-leaves, nothing but a seed-box and two 




purple stamens. But these tiny flowers are so closely 
crowded that the whole tree is coloured by them. 

Then, at the end of May, the leaf -buds begin to 
open. The leaves grow opposite to each other on 
the branches, and each leaf (1) is cut into seven or 
more leaflets, with an odd one at the end. Many 
leaves are cut up like this, and you might think 
each leaflet was a leaf. But if they were leaves, a 
bud would grow at the base of each, near the stem, 
and there would be a growing tip at the end. So 
when there are neither of these you may know 
that all the leaflets make up one leaf ; and when it 
fades, the whole falls off together. 

All through the summer the tree is very beauti- 
ful, and its bluish-grey leaves differ from those of 
any other tree. But early in the autumn they turn 
yellow and fall. Then you will know the tree by its 
curious long, flat, narrow fruits (3), which hang in 
groups from the branches like bunches of keys. In 
fact, they are called " keys." They hang on some- 
times quite into the winter, till the rough winds 
tear them off. 

You may often find a young ash-tree growing in 
your garden, for they are very hardy. But rabbits 
are fond of eating the young seedlings, so they have 
not much chance to grow. Young ash stems are 
often used for walking-sticks and hop-poles, and the 
wood, when full-grown, sells very well for coach- 
building and for making furniture. 

We all know Elm-trees so well that perhaps you 
may think that there is nothing interesting to learn 
about them. But I wonder if you have noticed that 





the twigs of an elm grow on the trunk almost to the 
bottom of the tree unless they are lopped o£P. And 
I am almost sure that many of you do not know that 






the twigs are often covered with little lumps of cork 
making the branch look as if it were diseased. 

It is really quite healthy, but it tells a secret, 







namely, that the elm has a very corky bark. Even 
on the trunk the cork is thick and rugged, and on 
the small branches it has no room to spread, and 
has to lie in lumps. The inner part of the bark 
called the "liber" is very tough, and is used for 

making mats and 
ropes. 

The common 
elm, which so often 
grows in rows be- 
tween the fields, or 
is planted on the 
village green, was 
brought to England 
by the Romans. It is not quite 
at home even now, for its seeds do 
not ripen, except in very hot 
summers, and new trees have to 
be planted from suckers. 

The real old elm of England is 

the Wych elm or Scotch elm. It 

has not such a tall trunk as the 

common elm, for its big branches 

grow out much lower do^vn. Its 

leaves are bigger, and its seeds ripen 

and grow, when they are sown. But 

it is not very common in our country and grows 

chiefly in Scotland, Wales, and the West of 

England. 

Even ill winter you can count a great number 
of buds on the elm, and when April comes, if you 
look up through the boughs, ycu will see a purple 








tinge all over the top of the ti'ee. This is caused by 
the t\ny purple flowers which burst out on the 
twigs. Now watch the tree. At the end of April 

. 

the fresh green lea\-es peep out of the leaf-buds. 
But already the seed-boxes are begiiniing to fall and 
are blown into heaps by the wind. 




I am sure you must kno^v^ these little, flat, green 
plates, with a lump in the middle where the seed 
lies. They are blown along the fields, and often 
down the village street, filling the gutters. If they 
fall from the Common elm it is very doubtful 
whether they will grow. But if you have a Wych 
elm on the green, you may know its seed-boxes, be- 
cause the seed ai\\^ays lies quite in the middle of 
the plate, while in the common elm it lies nearer 
the point. These seeds are ripe and worth sowing. 

There are a great many kinds of elm in England, 
very like each other, but it is easy to know the 
Cornish elm because it grows such a great deal of 
cork on its twigs. All the big forest elms are very 
useful for timber. They sometimes live for four or 
five hundred years, but the best time for cutting 
them down is when they are about one hundred 
and twenty years old. 

A great many insects feed on the elm. The most 
destructive one is a beetle which eats its way down 
to the inner bark, and sucks the sap. Then the 
mother beetle works her way down about two 
inches and makes little galleries all along the tube 
on each side. In each gallery she lays an egg, and 
the grubs when they are hatched eat the wood. The 
trees of whole forests have been killed by this "elm- 
destroying beetle," 

Bring an ash branch to look at the twigs and buds. Find 
a, bunch of ash-keys. Find the corky twigs of the ehn, and the 
green seed-plates in May. Look in decayed elms for the gal« 
leries of the elm-destroying beetle. 




In our great parks you will find the largest 
and grandest English trees, besides many which 
are interesting because they come from abroad. 
Avenues, of a mile or two miles long, are often 
planted with one kind of tree, chestnut, beech, 
oak, horse-chestnut, or lime, while in the open 
ground the oaks and horse-chestnuts grow into 
much finer trees than in the fields. 

We have not yet spoken of the Lime-tree, but 
you know it quite well, with its straight, smooth 
trunk, its bright, heart-shaped green leaves, bigger 
on one side than the other, and pointed at the 
tip, and its bunches ol yellowish green flowers, 
which grow on a long stalk coming out of the 
middle of a yellow-green leaf (2, p. 71). 

Get some of these flowers in July, or some 
of the round, downy fruit with ribs on it in the 
autumn when it is ripe. The leaf out of which 
they grow is called a bract, and is the same kind 
of leaf as the scales on which the willow stamens, 
and the pine seeds grow. But in the Lime it has 
become a long leaf which can be carried by the 
wind. The inner bark or "liber" of the lime tree 
is very useful in making ropes, and of all trees the 
bees love this one, for the flowers have a sweet 
scent and plenty of honey in their cups. 

There is another tree which is ahnost as useful 





to the bees, which blooms rather earlier than the 
lime. This is the Sycamore, ^vhose clusters of 
green flowers hang from the twigs in May, before 
the leaves are quite out. The sycamore is a very 
handsome tree with large leaves cut into five 
broad divisions. It is really a kind of maple, very 
like the common English field maple which grows 
in the hedges. If you stand under a sycamore in 
warm weather you will often notice that drops 
fall from it, and you will find that its leaves are 
sticky. This is because all maples have a great 
deal of very sugary juice or sap in them, which 
rises up and oozes out of the leaves, either from 
cracks made by the leaf being dry, or because some 
insect has , bitten a hole. You must have seen 
the little green blight-insects which cling on rose 
trees and other plants, and suck out their juice. 
Hundreds and thousands of these, besides other 
bugs (such as the cuckoo-spit, "which you find 
covered with froth), suck the sap of trees. So 
through the cracks they have made the sugary 
juice of the sycamore or the maple oozes out 
over the leaves. 

The fruit of these trees is very curious. It is 
winged like the keys of the ash, but two fruits 
grow together, so that the two wings spread out 
like those of a moth (see p. 73). The wings of the 
Field Maple fruit are spread more widely than 
those of the sycamore. 

Maple wood is very useful for furniture. A 
great many of our desks and wardrobes are 
made from American maple. Maple sugar, which 










American children love, conies from the sugary 
sap of an American species. 

Another tree which you will find in the park 
is the Walnut, which was brought to England by 
the Romans. It is a large, 
spreading tree with a rough 
trunk and strong, crooked 
branches. Its leaves are cut 
like those 

of the ash, > 

but they 
are much 
larger. They 
h a V e a 
pretty red 
tinge when 
they are 
young, and 
always have 
a strong 
smell when 
they are 
crushed. 

These trees grow so quickly that 
they are twenty feet high in ten years, (^, 
and then begin to flower and make sycamoiu; twig 
fruit. They go on growing till they ^^'^th ns fruit 
are about seventy feet high. You 
can see the long catkins hanging from the tree in 
April just as the leaves are opening. The stamen 
catkins are at the tip of last year's tAvigs. But 
the little grouj) of flowers which will grow into 





walnuts are on the new twigs, which have just come 
from buds. In autumn every boy knows the 
walnut fruit shut up in the green husk, Avhich 
stains your fingers brown as you peel it off. When 
the husk is off you can slip a knife between the 
halves of the hard shell and split them aj)art. In 
doing this you divide the two seed-leaves of the 
seed, which are the parts you eat ; and if you look 
carefully you will see the little white bud and 
root, lying bet^veen them, at the pointed end of the 
walnut. Walnut wood is very useful for furni- 
ture, for it becomes a deep brown when the tree 
is old, and has very beautiful veins in it. 

There is one more tree or shrub w^hicli grows 
only in parks and shrubberies, about which I must 
tell you, because it is so pretty. But I am not 
sure you will be able to find one. It is the Arbutus, 
or Strawberry tree (plate, p. 71) so called because its 
fruits look like strawberries. It is an evergreen 
shrub with green, glossy leaves shaped like a bay leaf 
and very notched at the edge. Its flowers are bell- 
shaped and waxy like the flowers of the heath, and 
they hang on bent stalks. But the curious thing 
about them is, that the fruits take a year to ripen. 
First they are a pale yellow, then they grow deeper 
and deeper in colour till they are a bright scarlet, 
hanging in twos and threes among the dark-green 
leaves, just when the tree blooms afresh Avith its 
pretty, greenish-white flowers. 

Other trees which you may find in the park are 
the Chili pine, or monkey-puzzle, a tree which bears 
cones and has such prickly leaves close together. 





that it would indeed puzzle a monkey to climb it, 
and the large magnolias and tulip-trees which have 
such beautiful white and pinkish flowers as large 
as bowls. But these are foreigners and w^e must 
be content wdth knowing about English-growing 
trees. 

Find the flowers and fruit of the lime tree ; the leaves of the 
sycamore sticky with honey-dew ; the winged seeds of the 
maple and the sycamore ; the leaves and catkins of the walnut 
tree. Open a walnut and find the young shoot inside. 



In the summer when the trees are in full leaf, and 
you have learnt to know" them, you should bring 
in leafy twigs from each tree and note how the 
leaves grow on the stem, and what shapes they 
have. 

We have already noticed that some trees, such 
as the horse-chestnut and the maple, have their 
leaves opposite to each other on the stem, two 
growing on each joint, Avhile others, such as the elm 
and the beech for example, have their leaves 
alternate, one only growing from each joint. But 
there are many kinds of alternate leaves, and you 
mil enjoy finding them out. 

In the elm and the beech every other leaf comes 
exactly above the one below. Leaf 1 comes on one 
side of the stem, leaf 2 on the other side, leaf 3 
exactly above leaf 1. But if you take a twig of the 




trembling poplar, or Aspen, it ^vill be leaf 4 which 
conies above leaf 1. They have crept more slowly 
round the stem. Then take a twig of oak. You 
will find that you will have to count six leaves 
before you find one exactly over the first one. All 
these differences have their use, and when you are 
in the lanes, if you look at the trees, you will see 
how these arrangements bring the leaves into posi- 
tions where they can best get light and air. 

The next thing to look at is the shape of the 
leaves themselves. Botanists have a great many 
names to describe the shapes, the edges, the veins, 
and the divisions of leaves. I can only tell you of a 
few, so that you may keep your eyes open and 
notice others. 

Leaves which are whole, so that you cannot pull 
off one i3iece without tearing it away from the rest, 
are called simple. The leaves of the elm, beech, 
sweet-chestnut, lime, oak, "willow, sycamore, and 
many others are simple. 

Leaves which are cut into separate leaflets, so 
that you can pull one off without touching the 
others, are called co7tipou7id. The leaves of the 
horse-chestnut, ash, rose, rowan-tree, and elder are 
co7npound. You will remember that you know the 
divisions are leaflets and not leaves, because there 
is no growing tip at the end, and there are no buds 
in the angles. The leaflets grow out from the top 
of the leaf stalk (horse-chestnut), or from the 
narrow, green line, up the middle (rose), which is 
not a stalk, but the niidrib of the leaf. 

Now take all the simple leaves you have and see 





what sIlapo$ they are. The hest way to find out 
this is to lay a leaf on your slate and draw a line 
round it. This is very easy Avith a beech leaf, or the 
leaf of a sweet- chestnut. But when you take art 
oak leaf, you will want to know whether you are to 
rvm in and out of the divisions. 

For the shape of a leaf you are not to do this. 










You are to begin at the leaf stalk and run round the 
outside points of the leaf all the way till you come 
back to the leaf stalk again. If you go round a 
maple leaf Kke this you will have a shape something 
hke a kidnerj. A sycamore leaf will be more heart- 
shaped, longer, and ending in a bhnit tip. An oak 
leaf will be oblong, longer than it is broad. The 




leaf of an elm or a beech you will find is shaped 
like an egg, and so is called oval, while the leaf of 
l;he sweet-chestnut is narrow and long. Lastly, if 
you take a lime leaf it will be heart-shaped, but 
uneven, one side of the leaf larger than the other. 
It is called oblique. 

Now let us see how much the different leaves 
are cut. Some, like those of the lilac and ivy, are 
smooth at the edge. Others are wavy, and the holly 
has prickles at the end of its waves to protect it. 
But, if you look at holly leaves near the top of a 
tree where the cattle cannot reach, you w^ill often 
find they do not take the trouble to grow prickles. 

Other leaves have teeth round the edge. The 
leaf of the sweet-chestnut is toothed like a saw. So 
is a birch leaf, but if you look closely you will find 
it has two sets of teeth. The large teeth have their 
edges cut into small teeth. This leaf has a double- 
sawed edge. Some leaves again are very deeply cut 
into divisions or lobes. An oak leaf is cut, sometimes 
only in a wavy line, and sometimes into quite large 
divisions. A sycamore leaf has five large pointed 
divisions or lobes. 

Get these two leaves and compare them. You 
will see that the veins which make the skeleton of 
the different shapes are not the same. In the syca- 
more leaf the large veins, or ribs, start from the 
top of the stalk, and spread out like five fingers, 
while the little veins start out from them. A leaf 
like this is called a palm-veined or palmate-veined 
leaf because the veins are like fingers on a hand. 
In the oak leaf, on the contrary, one long rib runs 




up the middle. The smaller ones start from it, like 
the featherlets of a bird's feather. So an oak leaf is 
said to be feather-veined or pinnate-veined, from 
pi7ina, a feather. 

Now take the compound leaves of the horse- 
chestnut, ash, and rose. In the horse-chestnut the 
leaflets grow just like the veins of the sycamore. 
Seven fingers start from the top of the leaf stalk 
and spread out like fingers, so it is called a pahnate 
leaf. But the ash and the rose have a rib up the 
middle and the separate leaflets are arranged 
feather-wise. So these leaves are called pinnate. 

There are a great many leaves with shapes 
between these, and if you collect them and arrange 
them in an old copy book, you will soon get an 
idea of the meaning of their names. 

Describe the leaves of the oak, horse-chestnut, and elm and 
their position on the stem. Arrange any simple leaves and 
compound leaves you can find in a copy book and describe 
them. 



It is a lovely svinimer morning. Let us shut up 
our books and wander in the garden and field, in 
search of insects. The best way is to take a few 
card match-boxes with us, and drop one insect into 
each as we find them. Then when we get back to 
school, we can put them separately under tumblers, 

Insects are so small that we often pass them by. 
But they form three-fourths of the whole animal 
kingdom, and they do us so much good and so 
much harm that we ought to know about them. 

As we start I see a Cabbage Butterfly in the 
kitchen garden, and a beautiful Red Admiral 
flitting about among the flowers. We will takt 
the Cabbage Butterfly, so that she may not lay 
her eggs on our cabbages. 

Next stop at this rose-tree, there are a number 
of tiny insects on the flower-stalks. If you look 
closely, you will see that each one has his beak 
buried in the stem, so as to suck out the juice. 
These are Dlant-lice, Each one is called an Aphis 



We must syringe the tree with soft soap and 
tobacco water, or it will soon be covered Tvith 
xhese insects, for they increase at the rate of more 
than a million in a month, and they suck out all 
the sweet sap from the plants to which they cling. 
On the same tree you ^11 very likely find a Lady- 
bird, for she feeds on ajjliides. 

Now look into the flower of this old Cabbage 
Rose, which grows in most cottage gardens. You 
are almost sure to find in it a lovely Rose-beetle 
with green shining wings shot Tvith gold. Take 
it up and look at the bright wing-cases. While 
you are looking, it may open these cases and 
spread out the transparent ^vings underneath ; but 
if it flies away you can easily get another. 

Now, look ! At your feet runs a beetle which is 
not half so pretty. It is the Cocktail, or Rove 
Beetle (see p. 36), often called the Devil's Coach- 
horse. As you pick him up he will cock up his tail 
and squirt out a very disagreeable fluid over your 
fingers, while he raises his head and snaps with his 
jaws. So drop him in his box quickly. The fact 
is, he is terribly frightened, and hopes to make 
you set him free. 

Now we will go out into the newly-mown field, 
and there you will see a number of small green 
Grasshoppers hopping about. They have been 
hatched under the earth-clods, and are eating 
the tips of the young grass. Some will have 
wings, but others, which are not fully grown, 




I have not asked 
for a Spider. You 
had better get one, 
and also a Hun dred- 
legs or Centipede, 
if you can find 
it. 

When you hav^ 
put these specimens 
under their glasses, 
look carefully at 
them. You will 
find a difference 
between the spider, 



will have none. 

Pick one up and 

make him too a 

prisoner. 

Next try to find a 

Wasp or a Bee. You 

can pick it up in your 

handkerchief and drop 

it in its box. We must 

go down to the river to 

find a May - fly or a 

Dragon - fly, and near 

there w^e shall easily get 

a Daddy-long-legs. But 

if there is not one to be 

seen, a Blue-bottle or a 

Gnat will do. 

You will wonder that 




the hundred-legs and all the others. The spider 
has eight legs and the centii)ede a very great 
many, while all the others have only six. 

Now look at the Grasshopper, the Wasp, and 
the Daddy-long-legs. You can see very clearly 
that their bodies are divided into three parts — 
(a) the head ; (6) the front body, on which the six 
legs and the wings grow ; (c) the hind body, which 
has no legs on it, even when it is very long, as in 
the daddy-long-legs and the May-fly. You cannot 
see these divisions quite so well in the beetle be- 
cause its wing-cases cover the join between the 
front and hind body. 

Wo had better call these three divisions by 
their light names — (a) head; (b) front body, or 
thorax; (c) hind body, or abdomen. It is because 
insects are cut into these three parts that they 
have their name. It conies from the Latin " inseco" 
(/ cut into). The Spider's head is not clearly divided 
from i<s body, and a Centipede has not three 
divisions. For this reason, and because they have 
not six legs, some naturalists separate them from 
the true insects. This is why I did not call them 
insects 

Another thing you can notice well in the little 
green Grasshopper : his body is divided into rings 
(r), from his tail up to his head ; and you can 
see the same i^ the wasp and the daddy-long-legs, 
the aphis and tiie cocktail beetle. All insects 
have ringed bodies. 

It is these rings which enable the Wasp to 
bend her abdomen (c) when she wants to sting 






and to breathe. You can see, as she stands, 
how it keeps moving up and down all the time. 
This is because she is breathing. How do you 
think she does it ? Not through her mouth as 
we do, but through her sides. 

If you look closely at the grasshopper you will 
see along the sides of his body, some little black 
dots (h, p. 7), one in each ring. These are breathing 
holes, and through them the air goes in and out. 
They are smaller in a wasp, but they are there, and 
she is pumping the air in and out of them. 

NoT\^ that we have put aside the spider and 
the centipede, those that remain are true insects. 
But there is a difference between the daddy-long- 
legs and the rest, which you must notice. This 
is that they all have four wings and he has only 
two. This would be very strange if it Avere not 
that we can find some remains of the right number. 
He has two little knobs (k) behind his front wings, 
and with these he balances himself. So he has two 
wings and the stumps of two more. 

There is a great deal more to be learnt about 
these insects. But I want you to remember now 
— that they have six legs ; that their body is divided 
into three parts ; that you can see the rings in 
their hind body or abdomen ; that their legs and 
wings grow on the front body or thorax ; and that 
they never breathe through their mouths. Also 
that while bees, butterflies, and beetles have four 
wings, flies have two wings and two stumps. 

Find as many insects as you can, and notice their different 
parts. 



In the last lesson we found the full-grown insects 
very easily. But it is often more difficult to know 
some of them when they are young. Grasshoppers, 
crickets, and plant-lice, when they come out of the 
egg, are very much the same as -when they are 
grown up, except that they have no wings. But 
the daddy-long-legs begins its life as a grub under- 
ground. The lady-bird when young is a kind of 
caterpillar and runs over the plants eating plant- 
lice. And beetles are grubs with six small legs 
jefore they grow into perfect beetles with wings. 

The caterpillars of Moths and Butterflies are easy 
to find, so we will look at one in this lesson. There 
is hardly any time in the summer that you cannot 
find a caterpillar. Those of the Orange-tipped 
Butterfly come out first in April. In May the 
Cabbage Butterfly lays her eggs, and soon the 
caterpillars are eating the young cabbage leaves. 
A little later you may find among the nettles the 
black caterj)illars with white spots (2, p. 10) which 
will tvirn in June into the Peacock Butterfly; or 
the dark green caterj)illars of the Red Admiral. 
These are hidden in a bunch of leaves generally tied 
up with caterpillar silk. 

If you do not find either of these you cannot 
miss the heaps of little black caterpillars striped 
with yellow "which feed under the leaves of nettles, 
and turn into the small Tortoiseshell Butterfly. 
These caterpillars are very useful in killing nettles^ 




SO the butterfly is one you should always be glad 
to see. Then towards the autumn the caterpillars 
of the big Hawk-moths do a great deal of mischief. 
If you go out in the evening or early morning you 
may find the caterpillar of the Sjjurge Hawk-moth 
feeding on the green spurge in the hedges. It is 
a fine creature three inches 
long, with three bright 
lines on its back, and yel- 
low spots on each ring. 

But the most common 
one, which I have often 
found, is the caterpillar of 
the Privet Hawk-moth {see 
coloured picture, p. 20), 
which feeds in the evening

on the privet hedge or the 
lilac bushes. It is from 

three to four inches long, and is a bright apple- 
green, with seven sloping violet stripes on its sides, 
and a horn at the end of its body. Its head is 
green, edged with black, and the breathing holes 
on its sides are circled with bright orange. 

It destroys the hedges terribly, for it is very 
nungry and w^ants to store up food so that it 
may grow into a moth. Though its body is 
soft, its head is hard and horny, and as its mouth 
has nothing to do in breathing, or making any 
noise, it can be used all the time for eating. It 
is made of a great many pieces, but the parts 
you can see well are the large upper lip (ul) 
and the two broad strong outer jaws (j) which 




move to and fro sideways as it gnaws the leaf. As 
soon as a piece is cut off the caterpillar tucks it 
into his inner jaws (ij), where it is chewed and 
swallowed. Under the jaws is the flat lower lip 
(ZZ), through which passes a little tube. Look well 
at this tube (s). It is the place from which comes 
the silk which he uses to sj)in his cocoon, in which 
he sleeps while his butterfly body is growing. 

You remember Ave read in Book I. that the 
spider spins her web out of silk which comes from 
six little pockets under her body. But a caterpillar 
or a silkworm brings its silk out of its mouth. 

Now look at the legs. There are three pairs, 
one on each ring of the thorax. They have joints 
in them and claws at the end (2, p. 15). These are 
true legs, and they are hard and horny like the 
head. When the caterpillar turns into a moth 
these six legs will remain. But it has also some 
cushion feet {see p. 20), on the other rings of its 
body, which it uses to hold fast to the twigs. 
These are not true legs, but only fleshy cushions 
(1, p. 15) with a ring of hooks under them, and they 
will disappear with the caterpillar's body when the 
moth grows up. There are generally four pairs 
of cushion feet behind the true legs, and two 
pairs at the end of the body, but some cater- 
pillars do not have so many. Do you know hose 
called "Loopers," which bend their body ii to an 
arch or loop? You may often find them on the 
currant bushes, where they do a great deal of 
mischief They have only six true legs and four 
cushion feet at the end of their body, and they 





walk in a curious fashion. They hold firmly to 
the twig by their front legs, and then draw up 
their cushion feet till their body makes a loop in 
the air. Then they let go with their front legs and 
lift up their head like an elephant raises his trunk, 
and stretch forward fvirther up the twig. 

As a caterpillar is always eating, his skin be- 
comes so full that there comes a time when he 
cannot put in any more food. Then he remains 
quiet for a few hours, and swells 
out his rings. His skin splits and 
he creeps out, with a new soft skin 
ready underneath. This will stretch, 
and very soon he is eating away as i cushion feet of 
merrily as ever, caterpillar. 



Me does this about nve tunes m 
his caterpillar life, and then he stops eating and 
remains without moving for some days. His colour 
fades, and ^vhen he splits his skin and shuffles it 
off, all the parts of the butterfly or moth are to be 
seen underneath, soft and unfinished. Soon a kind 
of gum oozes out over them. This hardens and 
keeps the tender body safe from harm while it is 
growing. 

Now he is called a chrysalis, or sometimes a pupa 
or doll ; and, indeed, he looks like a crumpled doll 
as you sec his legs bent together and his head folded 
down over them under the hard gum. The pupa 
of a butterfly is generally broad at the top and 
narrow at the bottom, and it has ridges and 
prickles on it (3, Plate, p. 10). But the pupas of 
moths are shaped more like an egg, and are smooth 




(3, Plate, p. 20). Moths generally wrap their pupa 
in a silk bag" or cocoon, but butterflies leave theirs 
naked, and fasten it to a stem or a blade of grass 
with a silken cord (5, Plate, p. 10). 

The caterpillar of the Hawk-moth works its way 
down into the ground and lies in a hole which it 
lines with silk. I had one in a large flower-pot 
once for many months. After about seven months, 
or sometimes much longer, the pupa wriggles up 
to the top of the ground, and then breaks through 
its cover and conies out as a moth. 

Bring in sone caterpillai^s, each witli the plant on which 
you find it. Keep them fed and watch tlieir changes. 


When Moths creep out of their cases they no 
longer do us any harm. They spread their wings 
and fly about sipping honey from the flowers. 
Their strong jaws have almost disappeared, and 
featliery lips take their place. Their inner jaws 
have grown very long, and are rolled together 
into a long double tube (p. 17) — very like a tiny 
elephant's trunk. When the insect is not using 
this trunk it is rolled up under its lip, but when 
it wants to reach the honey in the flowers it 
unrolls the trunk and thrusts it into the blossoms. 

In the early morning, or evening in August, j^ou 
may see the Privet Hawk-moth (1, p. 20) with its 
beautiful rose-coloured wings striped with black, 
thrusting its head into the honeysuckle in the 
hedge. Cr the large brown Humming-bird moth 




may be hovering in the sunshine over a bed of 
flowers in the garden, or sucking honey out of 
the deep flowers of the evening primrose. You 
may know it partly by the humming noise it 
makes ^"ith its wings, and partly because it does 
not settle on the floAA^ers, but suclvs as it flies. 

Then there is the Death's-iiead Hawk-moth, 
which is the largest moth in England, and has this 
curious name because the grey marks on the back 
of its thorax are something like a 
skull. It has brown front wings, 
and yellow^ hind wings, with dark 
bands across them, and its feelers 
and trunk are very short. You may « ' 
find it, if you look out after sunset 
in the autumn, fluttering over the 
hedge, for it is not nearly so rare as 
people think, only it always flies by head of a moth. 


If you get one of these big moths 
you will be surprised to see how different it is from 
the caterpillar out of which it grows. The six legs 
are still there on the three rings of the thorax, but 
there are four splendid wings above them. These 
wings are made of very fine transparent skin, and 
are covered all over with scales, which are arranged 
like tiles on a roof. However carefully you take 
hold of a moth or a butterfly you will always find 
some fine dust left on your fingers. Each grain of 
this dust is a lovely scale, and it Is these wliich give 
the moth its beautiful colours. Moths and butter- 
flies are called Lejiidoptera, because this word means 







scale-winged. The caterpillar had six small eyes, 
so tiny that we did not notice them. The moth has 
these still, hut it has besides two glorious globes (e, 
p. 17) on each side of its head, cut into hundreds of 
little ^windows, so that the moth can look every way, 
although the eyes do not move. The eyes of the 
Death's-head moth shine like red 
imps in the dark night. 
The moth is plainly divided 
the three parts. Its hind 
is oval and pointed, its 
broad front body carries its 
legs and wings, and its head 
carries the big eyes (e), the 
delicate feelers, and the 
sucking trunk (p. 17). The 
feelers or anteniice of 
moths are broad in the 
middle and pointed at 
the end, and they have 
tiny feathers on them. By this you may know 
moths from butterflies. For the antennae of butter- 
flies are nearly always round and thick at the ends 
like a club and have no feathers on them. 

Another difl^erence between them is, that butter- 
flies fold their wings upicards over their backs so 
chat the upper side of the wings touch each other, 
while moths lay theirs down on their backs like a 
roof on a house. 

One common moth you may find is the Goat- 
moth. It has a short body and brownish white 
wings with wavy black lines on them. You will 






find it resting on the leaves of the willow or poplar. 
It does not fly about much, for it has no trunk, and 
does not eat any food during its short moth life. 
It only wants to find a place on which to lay its 
eggs, which will hatch into a naked red grub. This 
grub "svill bore its way into the tree and live there 
for years, eating 
the ^vood. 

Many moth 
grubs live inside 
trunks an d 

branches. If you 
look over the cur- 
rant bushes on a 
hot summer's day 
you ^vill often find 
a pretty little moth 
with a narrow 
yellow and black 
body, thin legs, 
long feelers and 
clear transparent 
wings, very unlike 
most moths. This is one of the Clear-wing-moths 
(5, Plate, p. 20), which have scales round the edge of 
their wings only. It is so lazy that you will easily 
catch it, and it looks so like a gnat that it is called 
the Gnat Clearwing. This moth lays its eggs in the 
twigs of the currant bushes, and its little yellow 
caterpillar, with a black line on its back, eats its 
way into the pith of the twigs. You should always 
clear away the dead or faded twigs on the currant 
c — VI 



bushes, for fear these caterpillars should be in 
them. 

Another moth which you may find flying in the 
bright sunshine is of a dark blue-green colour, with 
six bright crimson spots on its wings. It is the 
Six-spot Burnet-moth, whose cocoons you may 
find in May fastened on the blades of long grass 
in the meadow. By August the moth is out and 
flits from flo^ver to flower. 

There is one more moth which you will like to 
knoTV% because its caterpillar is the Woolly Bear, 
or Hairy Man, which curls itself up in a ball when 
you pick it up. It is very fond of feeding on the 
lettuces and strawberries, and when it is ready to 
change it bites off its long hairs and weaves them 
into its cocoon. When the moth comes out it runs 
about the flower beds in the evening and does not 
fly very high. But everyone knows it as the Tiger- 
moth (4, p. 20), for it is the grandest moth w^e 
have. Its front wings are cream coloured with 
wavy brown stripes on them. The hind ones are 
bright scarlet spotted with black. Its thorax has a 
bright red band on it, and its abdomen is scarlet 
with black bars. If you can find a Woolly Bear in 
the early summer and keep it in a box with a piece 
of wire over it and give it plenty of dead nettles to 
eat you may see its cocoon and the grand Tiger-moth 
which comes out of it. 

Try to find a Hawk -moth, a Clearwing-moth, a Tiger-moth, 
and the cocoon of the Burnet-moth. Bring in caterpillars and 
cocoons, when you can find them, always with a piece of the 
plant ou which they feed. 


There are not nearly so many butterflies as there 
are moths. But as the moths often fly at night, we 
know butterflies best, because they flutter about in 
the bright sunshine. Their caterpillars do not do so 
m.uch harm in the garden as the moth caterpillars, 
except those of the Cabbage butterfly, which we 
read about in Book III. 

You will find it very interesting, in the spring 
and early summer, to look for the chrysalis of each 
common butterfly, and keep them in a box with a 
piece of coarse muslin over it, so as to watch when 
they come out. 

If you do this you will see their colours much 
better than by catching them, because when they 
first come out of their sheath, their wings are not 
battered with wind and rain. And you need not kill 
them ; when you have looked at them you can set 
them free to enjoy the sunshine. 

It is curious that so many butterflies lay their 
eggs on the leaves of stinging nettles. Perhaps it is 
because the cows and sheep will not eat these 
plants, so the eggs are safe. The Peacock butterfly, 
the small Tortoiseshell, and the Red Admiral all 
leave their eggs on nettles. It is there that you 
will find their pupas or chrysalises. Let me tell 
you how to know them. 

The eggs of the Peacock butterfly are gummed 
in patches under the nettle leaves, and in June 
you may find the little black caterpillars spotted 
with white all feeding together in groups. Early 


in July they will each of them have spun a little 
cushion of silk under some leaf, by which the 
curious stiff chrysalis hangs head downwards, look- 
ing like a brown shining shell (3, Plate, p. 10). 

If you carry home either the caterpillar (2), 
or the chrysalis, you will find that about the end 
of July a glorious butterfly (1) will come out. Its 
hind ^wings are brown and its front wings bright 
red and blue, and on each of the four wings 
there is a large bright eye-spot, like the eyes on 
a peacock's tail. The body is dark blue, and the 
feelers on the head are long and thin, with 
knobs at the end. But when the butterfly shuts its 
wings (la), all the bright colours are hidden and 
the whole insect is brown like the trunk of a tree, 
with pale edges like wood newly cut, so that the 
birds are not so likely to see it when it is resting. 

But, if you bring home another chrysalis from 
the nettles by mistake, a different butterfly will 
surprise you. This one has wings much notched 
round the edge, and they are coloured black 
with red markings and white spots. It is the 
Red Admiral, whose pupa also hangs head down- 
wards under nettle leaves. You will not make 
this mistake if you find the caterpillar, for it is 
not black like that of the Peacock butterfly, but 
dark green with a yellow line on its sides, and it 
has spikes all over it. It feeds on nettle leaves 
which it ties round itself with silken threads. And 
you must remember that these green and yellow 
caterpillars will turn into Red Admirals. 

Again, you may find a bunch of settle leaves tied 




together with silk, which have many caterpillars 
inside them. These will be very spiny, and have 
four yellow stripes on their black bodies. They will 
turn into small Tortoiseshell 
butterflies. 

Unless you know these 
three kinds of caterpillars 
well, the safe way is to 
bring them all home 
and keep them till the 
butterflies come out, 
and then notice many 
little differences which 
I cannot give you here. 

On the thistles jow 
may find another 
caterpillar which 
draws the leaves 
round it, and whose 
chrysalis has gold 
spots upon it. This 
will turn into a reddisl 
fly called the Painted ] 
years there are very 
while in other years they are plentif i 

Our next search shall be among 
the alder trees by the riverside 
either in the early spring or al)out 
the end of July, for there are two 
broods of this butterfly. 

You must look among the small twigs for a 
pretty green chrysalis with red dots on it, something 




like a ribbed shell. It will be tied round the middle 
to the stem of the twig by a fine rope of silk (5, 
Plate, p. 10). Notice how cleverly the caterpillar 
has swung it, so that the heavy broad end balances 
the long thin one. Then cut off the twig and take 
it home. The chrysalis will turn into the Brim- 
stone butterfly (4), whose pale yellow wings 
have four red spots on them. You will know it 
quite well, for it is generally the first butterfly to 
come out in the spring. 

Next we shall have to look low down among the 
plants by the roadside. There are some with white 
and pink flowers 'whose petals are in the form of a 
cross. They are called rockcress and bittercress, and 
if you can find out which they are, and look under 
their leaves you may find a most curious chrysalis 
(7, p. 10) shaped like a boat pointed at both ends. 
This will turn into the Orange-tip butterfly (6), 
which has a broad orange patch on the tip of its 
front wings. This butterfly is very gay when it is 
flying, but when it settles (8) and folds its wings 
upwards, it can scarcely be seen on the flowers of 
the wild parsley from which it sips honey. This is 
because the underside of the wings are dotted with 
green and white, like the tiny parsley flowers with 
their white petals and green centres. 

Another common butterfly is the small Heath 
(9) which may be seen any fine day in June or 
September sipping honey from the heath on the 
common. It feeds as a green caterpillar on the tall 
grasses, and comes out a pretty little butterfly with 
tawny yellow wings, with a round eye-spot. 




Now you kno^v liow^ to look for caterpillars, 
and chrysalises, and butterflies, you can learn 
about them for yourself. Anywhere on the violet 
beds you may find the spiny caterpillars* of the 
pretty striped and dotted butterflies called Fritil- 
laries. Blue butterflies are found mostly in chalk 
districts, though the Common Blue lives almost 
everywhere, and you may often see the little 
Copper butterflies flying with it, their dark glitter- 
ing wings gleaming amongst the lovely blues. And 
wherever you see a butterfly on the wing you 
should try to follow it till it alights, for one of the 
most interesting points to notice, among all butter 
flies, is how the under colour of their wings helps 
to hide them when they are resting, while the 
upper colour is bright and gay. 

Bring in caterpillai's and chrysalises, and watch them. 
Notice the plant on which the caterpillar feeds. Compare the 
under surface of their wings with the plants on which they 
settle, 



All living creatures must hunt for food, and 
insects eat a great deal for their size. Beetles 
are very heavy feeders. They eat most when they 
are grubs, but some, like Cockchafers and Tiger- 
beetles, eat almost as much when they are full- 
grown and have their wings. 

There are plant-eating beetles, and beetles which 
feed on other insects and animals. Altogether 
there are more than 3,000 species of beetles ir the 




British Isles. It is useful to know w^hat kind of food 
a beetle eats, for some do good work in the fields and 
gardens, while others do great injury to the crops. 

One of the most mischievous is the Cockchafer. 
You know^ him quite well when he flies in your 
face in the evening. But perhaps you do not 
know him as a grub, when he lives for three or 
four years underground, and eats the roots of the 
grass, corn, and vegetables. If you see plants in 
the cornfield or garden looking sickly and yellow, 
and drooping their leaves although the ground is 
damp, it is most likely that there is a grub under- 
neath, and it may be the grub of a Cockchafer. 

Dig up the plant and you will find an ugly 
white creature (3, Plate, p. 30) like a huge maggot, 
almost as thick as your little finger, with a red 
head and very strong jaws. It has six long legs, 
with five joints, growing on the rings behind its 
head, and is so full of food that it can hardly crawl. 
The end of its tail is swollen into a thick cushion, 
and you can see the breathing all along its sides very 
clearly because it is so distended with food. You 
remember that it does not take in breath through 
its mouth, so it can go on eating all the time. 
If you had not disturbed it, it would have crept 
on from plant to i3lant across the field, doing 
nothing but eat for three years. It goes down 
deeper in the ground in winter to keep "warm 
during the frosty weather. 

At last in the autumn of the third year it draws 
itself together (4, p. 30), and leaves off eating for 
nearly eight months. If you can find one at this 



time you will be able to see the parts of the real 
beetle crumpled up under the clear skin, and for 
the last few months it will be a full-grown sleeping 
cockchafer. 

Then, when tlie warm summer comes, it crawls 
up above ground and flies into the trees, eating 
their leaves as greedily as it ate their roots while 
it was a grub. This is the time to catch and kill 
them, for they only live about a month, and mean- 
while the mother cockchafer lays the eggs which 
will hatch into grubs. 

You will be surprised to see how different the 
beetle is from the white grub you found under- 
ground. It is now a flying insect, about half an 
inch long, with brown powdery wing-cases, covering 
a pair of transparent wings. Its hind-body, or 
abdomen, ends in a fine point, and on its head 
it carries a pair of feelers tipped with broad folds 
like a half-open fan. 

These folds are very handsome in the male 
Chafer (1, p. 30), but much smaller in the female 
(2), and by this you may know the mother which 
will lay the eggs. You must catch and kill these 
last if you want to save your crops, and the most 
merciful way to do this is to drop them into boiling 
water. A crushed beetle is a long time dying, but 
boiling water kills them at once. 

You will find that they rest in the daytime on 
favourite trees, and, if you spread a cloth under- 
neath, you may beat the boughs and so catch a 
good many. Farmers use gas-lime and other dress- 
ings to kill the grubs in the ground. 



Another very mischievous creature is the young 
of the Skipjack or Click-beetle (5, Plate, p. 30). All 
children know these little beetles, though perhaps 
you may not know their name. They are narrow 
and flat, about half an inch long, with very short 
legs. The most common one in England has 
reddish wing-cases, striped with long furrows, and 
a black head and thorax. Boys love to pick them 
up, and turn them on their backs, for they bend 
themselves up in the middle so as to rest on their 
head and tail. Then with a sudden jerk and a click 
they straighten themselves, so that their back hits 
your hand and sends them up in the air, and they 
come down the right way up. Sometimes they fall 
again on their backs, then they rest a little and 
begin again. 

These amusing little creatures are very destruc- 
tive when they are grubs, for the iviretcorms we 
know so well are the young of the Click-beetle. If 
you find a wireworm and look at it carefully you 
will see that it is not a worm, but has the six legs 
on the rings behind its head, by which you kno\\" 
that it is an insect. Wireworms feed on the roots 
of most plants. They are long and narrow like a 
piece of wire, and are generally of a reddish yellow 
colour, and have very tough skins. 

The Click-beetle lays her eggs in meadows, and 
among the roots of plants, and the wireworm when 
it is hatched often feeds for five years before turn- 
ing into a beetle. Therefore Click-beetles must be 
desti'oyed, and salt and lime sprinkled on the earth 
to kill the grubs. 




Unfortunately the pretty little "Weevil-bt^etles 
are also very destructive. We read in Book I. 
about the Nut-weevil, and almost every plant and 
tree has some weevil which attacks it. There i;- 
the weevil of the apple-blossom (4), the Pea-weevil 
(1 and 2), the Bean-weevil (3), the Furze-weevil, the 
Vine-weevil, and many others. They all begin life 




as little soft maggots with no true legs, but only 
cushion feet, and Avith horny heads and sharp jaws. 

You may know the full-grown weevils by their 
prominent snouts, sometimes broad and sometimes 
long. They are beautiful little creatures with 
polished wings which shine like jewels, and bright 
eyes ; but as grubs they destroy the flowers, fruits, 
and green shoots everywhere. 

Some of the most curious are the Stem-boring 
weevils. They have long snouts and very sharp 




jaws, and their feet have hairy pads underneath 
with sharp hooks at the end, so that they can 
cHng firmly to smooth stems. If you search on 
the poplar tree in summer you may find a lovely 
Stem-borer with shining green wings and red 
eyes; and on the fruit trees of the orchard you 
are almost sure to find the Steel-blue weevil which 
lays her eggs in their shoots. 

When the mother stem-borer wants to lay, she 
bores a hole in a young shoot with her snout and 
forces an egg into it. When she has laid several 
in this way, she sets to work to cut off the shoot 
with her sharp jaws. This often takes her some 
weeks, and if you see the hanging shoot and burn 
it you will destroy the grubs. But at last, when it 
hangs by only a thread of bark, she weighs it down, 
and it falls to the ground, where the grub feeds 
in peace when it is hatched. 

Try to find Cockchafers — male, female, and grub. Bring in 
a Click-beetle and a Wireworm. Find as many weevils as 
you can ; and twigs, flowers, and fruit with grubs in them. 




We cannot help destroying some beetles when- 
there are so many that they eat our crops. But 
it is pleasant to know that there are others which 
do us so much good that we need not wage war 
upon them. 

The Tiger-beetles (1, Plate, p. 36), for example, 
are very hungry creatures ; but, as they feed on 


other insects, they destroy the weevil and cock- 
chafer grubs, wireworms and caterpillars, and so 
save our plants. Their name is given to them 
because they are so fierce and cunning. They are 
not very large — our common tiger-beetle is not 
more than three-quarters of an inch in length — 
but their long slender legs are very strong, and 
they can fly very fast. 

There are always plenty running about in the 
hot sun across dry, dusty fields or commons in 
summer. Their wing-cases are a beautiful shining 
green colour shot with copper, and dotted with 
five yellow spots. They run very gracefully, and 
so fast that you will find it difficult to catch one. 
Just as you think you have it, it will suddenly 
open its wing-cases, spread its delicate transparent; 
wings, and be off almost before you can see it go. 

But if you can catch it, you will see that it has 
large eyes standing out on each side of its head 
and tAvo sharp jagged jaws for tearing its prey, 
while the lower ones are covered with stiff bristles 
which help to hold it. 

And now you must look for its grub, which is 
a very curious creature. The best way to find it 
is to go to some soft part of a sandy field where 
you have seen the Tiger-beetles running about. 
Then look at any small holes in the sand, and 
try to find one which leads to a tunnel in the 
ground. The grub of the Tiger-beetle sits at the 
mouth of this tunnel to catch insects as they pass- 
It will disappear as soon as you come near, but if 
you put a blade of grass into the hole and shake 



it, the grub will grasp the blade, and you can pull it 
out. 

Then you can see the tools it uses. It is a 
long soft white grub with a horny head, and jaws 
like sickles, and, besides its six brown spiny feet, 
it has two soft humps on its back with little hooks 
on them. As soon as this grub is hatched in the 
ground, it scoops a tunnel in the soft sand with 
its spiny legs, and pulls itself up to the top, holding 
on by its legs and the hooks on its back. Its head 
just fills the hole, and as it is a poor weakly 
creature and cannot move fast, it keeps quiet till 
some insect passes, and then darts its head out and 
pulls its victim down. ..If you have the patience 
to find some of these tunnels, and sit still and 
watch, you may see the grub catch its prey. 

The Rove or Cocktail-beetles (2, p. 36), which 
we found in the first lesson, are very useful in 
eating insects, though they are not beautiful. But 
the Ground-beetles, which have only very small 
wings under their wing cases, and seldom fly, are 
the best hunters. You may sometimes see a good- 
sized beetle with long legs running along through 
the grass. Its body is very dark, shaded with red 
and violet. This is the Violet Ground-beetle, and 
it is hunting for grubs and wire worms. 

There are some very curious beetles not difficult 
to find which will interest you. These are the 
Sexton, or Burying-beetles. When you see a dead 
mouse or bird lying in some part of the field or 
garden, pick it up quietly. If it has been there a 
few days it will already have a bad smell, and you 



are almost sure to find underneath it two or more 
beetles with thick bodies and strong legs. They are 
generally black with red feelers, and two light red 
bands on their abdomen. These are Sexton-beetles 
(3, p. 36), which have scented the dead body and 
flown, often for some distance, to bury it. 

They scrape away the soft ground underneath, 
till the body sinks down, and then they drag the 
earth over it. Why do you think they do this ? 
Because the mother beetle wants to lay her eggs 
there that the grubs may feed on the flesh. She 
does this as soon as the animal is buried, and in 
a few days the grubs are hatched. They are 
narrow, and each has six legs and a number of 
spines along its back. With these it wriggles 
through the flesh, and eats away till it buries itself 
in the ground and turns into a beetle. 

A great many beetles are useful to us by eating 
dead and living animals. Among these are the 
little black shining Mimic-beetles, which draw up 
their legs and pretend to be dead %vhen they are 
touched, and the Glow-worms, which shine sc 
brightly in the lanes in the summer nights. 

A good gardener who sees a glow-worm in a 
hedge will always pick it up gently, and put it in 
his garden when he has the chance. For the young 
of the glow-worm is a soft grub (3, p. 40), which 
works its way into the shells of small snails and 
feeds upon them. 

If you find a dry snail-shell with a white grub 
in it, it will most likely be the grub of the glow- 
worm. You may know it by a tuft of white threads 






on its tail, which it uses to brush off the sHme of 
the snail from its back. 

When they are full-grown you will find the 
mother glow-worm (1) very easily at night, because 









she gives out such a bright light. She has no 
wings, and you might take her for a slug if you 
did not notice her six little legs. The male glow- 
Avorm (2) has two spots of light near his tail. But 
he is not so bright hs the fei-iale. He has long 



soft "wing-cases and broad wings, with which he 
often flies into a lightf^d room w^hen the window 
is left open. 

The last useful beetle w^e can mention is the 
little Ladybird. She feeds all her life long on the 
plant bugs and aphides which destroy our plants. 
Wherever there are plant-lice, there the ladybird 
lays a bunch of yellow eggs and, wdien they are 
hatched, the long dark grubs clamber vij) the plant 
stalks and poke the lice into their mouths with 
their front feet. After a time each one glues its 
tail to a leaf and hangs till it becomes a ladybird, 
and then it flies away to feed on plant-lice on some 
other bush and to laj' more eggs. 

Bring in a Tiger-beetle, and try to find its grub. Search for 
Sexton-beetles under dead animals. Bring in a Mimic-beetle. 
Find a male and female glow-worm. Look for the grub of the 
Ladybird. 



"We all like Butterflies because they are pretty, 
and Bees because they give us honey. But no one 
likes Wasps, for w^e are always afraid that they 
w^ll sting, and they spoil our garden fruit. Yet 
w^asps are very industrious and interesting. They 
act as scavengers, eating otfal, raw^ meat, and 
insects, and they never sting unless they are 
frightened. You may be stung by pressing a 
wasp without knowing it. But people are very 
silly who flap them, and keep dodging about when 



they are near, for if you sit qiiite still they Tvill 
not hurt you. 

We are obliged to kill wasps, or we should be 
overrun by them and have no fruit, and the best 
way is to keep a good look out in the spring and 
early summer. The few big ones ^vhich come 
out then are queen wasps, or mothers, and each 
one will found a nest. It is more merciful to 
kill these, than to have to take nests in the summer, 
when there may be as many as 3,000 or 4,000 in 
each. Most boys have seen a wasps' nest dug out at 
night, but perhaps you have never looked at one 
carefully. Let us see how it is made. 

When the queen-wasp comes out from under 
the moss or grass, w^here she has spent the winter, 
she looks out for a hole in the ground, left perhaps 
by a mouse or a mole. Creeping into it, she makes 
it larger by biting the earth and kicking it out 
with her hind feet. Then she flies away and 
scrapes small pieces of fibre off the trees and 
plants. You may sometimes see her scraping 
window frames or posts with her ja^vs^s. She is 
getting shreds of wood. With these she goes back 
to the hole, and works them up, with some gluey 
matter from her mouth, into a kind of greyish 
paper or cardboard. 

Before it hardens she plasters this into the top 
of the hole, making a thick lump, which she glues 
to the roots of plants. Then she starts afresh for 
more fibre, and with it builds a few cells under 
the lump. 

She lays an egg in each, and tlien go'^s ou making 





more paj)er and more cells. In about eight days 
the first eggs are hatched into legless grubs, and 
she feeds them with honey and insects, still going 
on with her work. In about three weeks Cie grubs 





spin their cocoons, and in another week they come 
out as working wasps. After that, some come out 
almost every day, and the queen-wasp leaves them 
to do the work of building the nest and feeding 
the grubs, while she only lays eggs. 




They not only build cells, they also cover the 
nest with a papery dome of several layers, which 
hangs like an open umbrella from the lump at 
the top. When they have finished one comb it 
is like a round plate, and is smooth above, with 
a great number of cells underneath, all opening 
downwards. 

The wasps then make several gluey pillars under 
this comb to hold up a new one below which they 
form in the same way as the first. So they go on 
till August, when there may be fifteen or sixteen 
flat round plates one below the other, joined by a 
number of pillars. Then they draw the papery 





dome in at the bottom so that the whole nest is 
a round or oval-shaped ball. As wasps do not 
store honey, these combs are only cells for grubs. 
The papery covering prevents the wet soaking in 
from the bank. 

In August they build larger cells, out of which 
come males or drones which have longer antennae 
than the workers and queen-wasps. These queens 
are larger than either the males or workers. They 



soon fly out of the nest and pair with the drones 
and as winter comes on the wasps kill any grubs 
which remain, and, growing sleepy and dull, die 
themselves, leaving only the queen -wasps to 
sleep till next spring. Then if you know where 
there is an old nest you can dig it carefully out 
and see the long tunnel in the bank, along which 
the wasps went in, so that no one might know 
where their nest was. 

Some wasps build under the roofs of houses, 
especially the large wasps called Hornets, unless 
they choose the old trunk of a tree. If you look 
in a wood you may sometimes find the nest of the 
Wood-wasp hanging under the bough of a tree, 
though you would scarcely notice it unless you 
follow a Wood-wasp home. They are built like 
the other nests, only they have a thick papery 
column down the middle. 

Besides the connnon wasps there are a great 
many smaller kinds, some of which you may find. 
They are very interesting, because they carry 
insects into a hole and bury them with their eggs, 
so that the young grub may have food when it 
is hatched. 

There is a pretty little wasp, generally called 
the Wall- wasp (1, p. 45), which you may see 
in June or July biting the mortar in the garden 
wall or making holes in a sandy bank. It is smaller 
and blacker than the common wasp, and has a 
few bright yellow bands on its hind body. It 
scoops out a tunnel in the mortar and leaves the 
pieces sticking round the hole. Then after going 

in to see that all is right it comes out and flies 
away, coming back presently with a small green 
caterpillar. It carries this in and goes off for 
another, and so it goes on till it has brought about 
fifteen or twenty. 

If you dig out the mortar along the w^all, so 
as to open this tunnel, you ^vill find at the end an 
egg hanging by a thread. The wasp put the egg 
there before she went for the first caterpillar. 
Between this egg and the hole the fifteen little 
caterpillars will be lying curled up one beyond 
the other. The curious thing is that they are not 
dead. The wasp has only stupefied them with 
her sting so that they do not try to escape. If 
you do not break into the nest she ^\411 stop the 
hole up with the pieces of inortar round the edge 
and leave it. Then when the grub has eaten the 
caterpillars and turned into a wasp it will bite 
its way out. 

Then you may find some of the Sand-wasps 
(2, p. 45), which dig so many holes in the sand- 
banks on heaths, or in the lanes and gardens, 
wherever it is sunny and warm. One of these, 
called the Hairy Sand-wasp, piits Spiders in her 
hole for the grub to eat. She is orange coloured, 
with a black head and straggling legs. But she 
is very strong and can drag a big spider to 
her den. 

I have not room to tell you more of these 
curious wasps, some of which fill their nests with 
beetles, others with crickets. But now you know 
about them you will follow any you see and watch 



their habits for yourself, which is much the best 

way. 

Find an old wasps' nest and try to make a drawing of it. 
Notice the shape of the conmioii wasp and compare it with 
any others you find. Notice paiticularly the difference in the 
thread joining the abdomen to the thorax. 



We all know the Hive-bee well, but i^erhaps you 
have not noticed that there are other kinds of bees 
flying in the garden. Some of these are about the 
same size as the hive-bee ; some are much smaller, 
and they are differently marked. 

Most of these are solitary bees. There are no 
neuters among them, only niales and females 
living in pairs. Others live in great numbers in 
the holes of sandy banks, but do not work together. 

If you have ivy. growing on your cottage, you 
must often have noticed small bees flitting in and 
out of the flowers. Among these there will most 
likely be one, about half an inch long, with a black 
body covered 'with a taAvny do^vn. She will have 
two little horns on her head, and is called the " Two- 
horned Osmia" (1, riate, p. 51). 

If you can watch one and follow her, you may 
see her fly into some old rotten post, or tree-stump. 
Then if you cut into the post near the hole you \\ ill 
find a curious nest. For this bee bores a lon<r 
tunnel and builds a waxen cell at the bottom. Here 
she lays an egg and puts round it bee-bread, made 
of pollen and honey from the flcjwers. She has no 



groove in her leg like the hive-bee, so she carries the 
sticky pollen in the thick hairs under her body, and 
scrapes it of£ with a comb on her feet. 

When she has laid the egg and put in food, she 
seals the cell with wax, and begins another on the 
top of it. So she goes on till she has filled the 
tunnel. 

But how is the bottom bee to get out '? Her 
egg was laid first and she has eight or ten others on 
the top of her. Strange to say they wait for each 
other. They all become perfect bees about the same 
time, and, if one below is ready sooner than the 
others, she eats through the cover of her cell and 
tries to push past her neighbour. But if the one 
above is so big that the bee cannot get by without 
hurting her, she waits patiently till all are ready. 

Another little bee which you may often find is 
the Sleeper bee (2, p. 51), so-called because she 
often sleeps in the blossoms of -flowers, where you 
may find her. She is thin and black with a square 
head and strong jaws, and she has a little yellow 
down on her hind body or abdomen. She too 
burrows in posts, but very often she makes her 
nest inside a large stra^v. In olden days, when 
cottages were thatched, hundreds of these bees 
would build in the larger straws of the thatch, and 
might be heard buzzing abovit the roof. 

Then there is another bee which you cannot 
help finding. This is the Leaf-cutting bee (3, 
p. 51). Have you not seen the leaves of rose-trees 
with pieces like a half-moon cut out of their edge ? 
If you watch you may see a bee doing this work. 




She is about the same size as a hive-bee, but 
rather stouter, and her bod}'^ is black with soft bro^vn 
hairs over it. She clings to the leaf and turns 
round in a circle biting 
as she goes. Just before 
she has finished she 
opens her ^vings and so 
balances herself in the 
air. Then, when the 
last bite is made, she 
flies off with the piece 
of leaf carried be- 
tween her feet and her 
jaws. 

She goes to a hole in 
the ground, which is 
straight down for a little 
way, and then turns, and 
runs along under the sur- 
face. Here she packs the 
leaf in and goes back for 
more. With several 
pieces she makes a little 
thimble, in which she lays 
an egg, with food round 
it, and closes it with 
three or four i-ound 
pieces. Then she begins another thimble, pushing 
it in, so that it fits a little way into the last one. 
In this way she builds about seven cells, each with 
its egg and bee-bread, for the grubs to feed on till 
they turn into bees. Though you will easily see 





the bees cutting the leaves, you will not so easily 
find their tunnels, for they fill in the earth again at 
the top, so that the entrance cannot be seen. The 
best way is to follow a bee Avhich has been cutting 
^ a leaf, but she is so quick you will 
have to be quick too. Sometimes she 
makes her hole in a willow tree 
when the wood is soft. 

There is another Osmia "which 

makes its nest in the stem of the 

 bramble. It hollows out 

the pith and covers the 
cells with it. When you 
see a blackberry stalk with 
the end bitten off, you may 
as well cut dowai a little way 
with your knife and see if 
there is a tunnel in it, ^vith 
bee-cells, or wasp-cells, in- 
side. 

Another very curious 
bee, called the Carder bee 
(4, p. 51), lines its tunnel 
with fluffy hairs and 
cotton stripped off plants. 
You will remember that 
the ragged robin and wild 
campion have their stems covered with thick down 
The " Carder bees " strip this flviff off the plants, roR 
it up in a ball, and fly away with it to their nests in 
the ground, where they use it to make their cells. 
Solitary bees do not store honey for the wintei* 



like the hive bees. They die off in the autumn, all 
except some mothers, which creep into holes and 
sleep till the spring, when they make their nests and 
lay their eggs. 

There are so many of them that I cannot 
tell you about them all. You must watch for your- 
selves, and you will soon learn to notice the little 
holes in the trees and the ground, and in some of 
them you are sure to find curious creatures. 

Notice different kinds of solitary bees, and try to find their 
tunnels in the spring. 


Hive bees are so much at home in our gardens, 
that I am afraid most people think they know all 
about them, and take very little notice of them. 
This is unfortunate, because bee-keeping is very in- 
teresting, and many more cottagers might make 
money by bees, and at the same time become really 
fond of these busy little insects. 

When all the bees in the hive had to be killed 
each time the honeycombs were taken, we could not 
get fond of our bees. But now, even cottagers can 
have boxes and glasses on the top of their hives^so 
as to take the combs without destroying the little 
friends who fill them for us. 

The hive-bee is a wonderful insect. She has 
three pairs of legs, and two pairs of wings just like 
a Wasp. But the hind pair of legs is longer than 
the others, and she has a groove in each of them 



 



which makes a kind of basket, into which she 
packs pollen from the flowers, and carries it home 
to make bee-bread for her grubs. You may often 
see a bee going into a hive with both its hind legs 
heavily laden with sticky f)ollen. It is puzzling at 
first to guess how she gets it into the basket, but, 
if you look lower down her leg, you ^\'ill see that 
it is covered with hairs which form a small brush. 
When she comes out of a flo^ver her hairy body 
is covered with pollen-dust, 
and she brushes it off with 
one leg, making it into a little 
lump, which she packs into 
the basket of the other leg. 

Her mouth is a most use- 
ful tool for getting honey. 
When she is not sucking, 
her trunk is drawn in under 
her strong jaws. But ^^hen 
she is feeling for honey, this trunk, which is really 
a long under lip with a hairy tongue inside it, is 
thrust into the flo^ver and brings back the honey, 
which she passes down her throat into a honey- 
bag, or first stomach. 

Then she flies back to the hive. There other 
bees take the pollen out of her basket as she goes 
in, and she passes on to the cells, and pours into 
them the honey from her throat. Some of this 
honey is used to feed the young bee-grubs, and the 
rest to fill the honey-combs for the winter. 

Sometimes, however, the bee does not pour out 
the honey, but goes to the top of the hive, and 



hangs quietly by her front feet. After about four 
and twenty hours the honey is digested in her 
stomach, and part of it forms bees-wax, which 
oozes out under her body into eight little pockets. 
Then she goes down into the hive, and picks this 
wax out with her strong jaws, moistens it with her 
tongue into a kind of paste, and uses it to build the 
cells of the comb. 

It is when the bees are out getting honey and 
pollen that they are so use- 
ful to the gardener. You 
will remember that the vege 
table marrows cannot grow 
unless the bees carry pollen 
from one flo^ver to another. 
Our plants have better flowers 
and our fruit trees bear better 
fruit because the bees fly to bee hanging and showfno 


and iro and carry j)ollen from her body. 
one to another. 

But if the bee carried it haphazard from one 
kind of flower to another it would be of very little 
use, for strange pollen would not make the seeds 
grow. Watch a bee and you will find that she very 
seldom visits more than one kind of flower on the 
same journey. She will fly from one bed of violets 
to another, or from apple-tree to apple-tree. But 
she will not in one journej^ go from an apple-tr^e 
to a pear-tree, nor from a violet to a primrose. 
We do not know an hy she does this, but it is very 
useful to us, and all gardeners should encourage 
bees in their garden. 








And now, if you want to keep bees, you must 
learn a few simple things. You must always be 
very gentle and quiet with them. They will soon 
learn to know you, and to understand that you 

are not afraid of them. 

If you have a straw hive 
it sliould measure about six- 
teen to eighteen inches across, 
be about eight or nine inches 
high, and flat on the top, with 
a hole in it in which a plug 
is fixed. Put this hive in a 
warm sheltered part of the 
garden on a wooden bench 
about fifteen inches from the 
ground. Then in May buy 
a swarm of bees which has 
just come out from a neigh- 
bour's hive. Smear your 
own hive inside with balm 
and sugar, and hold it under 
the bough on which the 
swarm hangs. Shake the 

bough gently till the bees tall 
in. Turn the hive do^vn on 
to a piece of wood, and in 
the evening carry it gently to your garden. The 
next morning the bees will be busily at work. 
The big heavy drones will wander about idly, but 
the smaller working bees will go out and collect 
honey, hang up in the hive till they have wax in 
their pockets (see p. 57), and begin to build the coml> 






If your swarm was the first to leave the hive 
the old queen bee, which was in the middle, will 
soon begin to lay eggs in the cells — about 200 
a day. But a second swarm is led by a young 
queen, and she will fly out with the drones before 
she settles down in the hive. 

Now the w^orking bees will be very busy. In 
two or three days the first eggs are hatched, and 
the nursing bees feed the grubs with honey and 
pollen which the other bees bring in. In about 







five or six days they seal up the mouth of each 
cell, and the bee-grub spins its silken cocoon, in 
which it turns into a bee in ten days more. Then 
it comes out and works w^ith the rest. 

The empty cell will soon be fillp'^ with honey; 
but it "will be brown, not white and clean like the 
"virgin" honey which is put into new cells. After 
about six weeks the queen lays some eggs in 
larger cells, out of which come males or drones. 
Then about every three days she lays an egg in a 
cell like a thimble, on the edge of the comb. The 





grub in this is fed with special food, and becomes a 
queen-bee. 

Unless you have a hive ^vith a glass ^vindow in 
it you cannot see all this going on. But about the 
beginning of June you may expect that the hive 
is getting full of combs and bees. Then is the time 
to take out the plug at the top, and put on a bell- 
glass, or a box of ^vooden sections (see p. 58). In 
these the bees will make comb which you can take 
away. You must pvit in a small piece of comb to 
tempt the bees to build, and then you must put a 
straw cover or some old cloths over the whole to 
keep it warm and dry and dark. 

In about a month you will find this upper hive 
full of honey-comb sealed up in the cells. You 
can take it oif with a cloth dipped in weak 
Condy's Fluid, for the bees do not like this, and 
they "will not come near you. These sections of 
honeycomb Tvill be pure and clear, and you can 
take them away without killing a single bee. 

In July you may get one or more new swarms, 
and then when September comes you must take 
off the top and cork up the hive for the winter. 
But remember that you have taken a great part of 
the bees' store of food and you must feed them 
with honey and sugar during the cold weather. 

Examine three bees — male, female and neuter. Examine 
trunk and hind legs of the working bee. Get a piece of 
brown honey-comb with remains of bee-bread and young 
bees. Compare it with pure honey-comb. AVatch a bee among 
the flowers. Find honey-comb with thimble cells on the edge. 



There are a number of small flying insects Avhicli 
belong to the same family as the Bees and Wasps, 
such as the Saw-flies, which destroy our vegetables, 
and the Gall-flies which make those curious galls 
we found on the oak-tree and other trees. But 
though we call these " flies " you may always know 
them from true flies because they have four wings, 
while all real flies have only two. 

Try to collect as many two-winged flies as you 
can. There will be the common House-fly, the 
Blue-bottle or Blow-fly, Gnats, Midges, Daddy-long- 
legs, Horse-flies, and many others. 

The House-fly and the Blue-bottle are both 
very useful in their right place, for they eat decay- 
ing matter and dead animals. But they do grenu 
harm if we allow them to multiply in the wrong 
place. 

If you nave a great number of flies in your 
house you may be sure that there is dirt some- 
where, for the House-fly lays her eggs in dung- 
heaps, dust-heaps, or on any dirt she can find 
behind a shutter or door, or in an unsT\'ept cornei-. 

She lays about 150 at a time, and in a day or two 
the little legless grubs are hatched, and feed on 
the dirt. In four or five days they leave ott' eating 
and rest in their grub-skin, which grows hard and 
brown. Then in summer they come out as full- 
grown flies in about a week. But in winter- the 
hard pupa often lies for months, and people who 






do not clean their house thorovighly in autumn 
are Kkely to have a plague of flies next year. 

The Blue-bottle or Blow-fly (1, p. 61) lays her eggs 
(a) on meat of any kind, or on the bodies of decaying 
animals. When her grubs are hatched they are a^ ery 
useful in ridding us of bad-smelling creatures, for 
they give out a kind of liquid which makes the flesh 
decay more quickly so that they may eat it. 

All boys know " gentils " 
(b) used for fishing. These are 
the maggots of the Blue-bottle, 
and when they have done 
feeding they grow soft inside 
and dra^v themselves vip into 
an egg-shape. Then they give 
out a liquid which hardens 
their skin into a shiny reddish- 
brown case (c). Inside this the 
Blue-bottle forms, and ther 
pushes its head out between 
two little lids at the top of the 
cocoon. 
If you catch a Blue-bottle and put it under a 
bell-glass with a few grains of sugar you may 
watch it put out its trunk and feed. You will see 
that it turns and twists the sugar as if it were 
playing with it. But all the time it is wetti^iig 
it with some liquid Avhich it sends down its trunk 
so as to work the hard lump into syrup which it 
can suck up. If you press the thorax of a Blue- 
bottle very gently with your finger and tliumlj 
it will put out its trunk and you can see the 





thick lips at the end with the sucker (a) between 
them. But you will want a magnifying glass or 
a microscope to see a little lancet (/) %vhich it has 
inside its trunk, and which it uses to j)ierce the 
skins of fruits, when it wants to suck their juice. 

There are two kinds of flies which 
are much more hurtful than the 
common fly or the blue-bottle. These 
are the Gad-flies and the Bot-flies. 
You know one of tlie small Gad-flies 
quite well, for it drops on our hands, 
or our neck, ^vhen we are sitting out 
of doors, and lets us know that it is 
there, by giving a sharp bite to suck 
our blood. We call it the Horse-fly 
because it teases the horses so much 
in summer; but there are man j^ others 
Ave do not know so well. The largest 
English Gad-fly (4, p. 61) is about an 
inch long. 

The Bot-flies are more dangerous 
than the Gad-flies, for instead of 
biting with their mouths they prick with a sharp 
tube at the end of their abdomen, so as to lay 
their eggs under the skin of an animal. The 
Bot-fly or Warble-fly of the ox (2, p. 61) looks 
<'ery like a humble bee, only she has two wing?' 
instead of four. She has a pointed tube at the 
end of her body, with w^hich she pricks the skin 
of the ox, and lays her eggs underneath it. In 
a short time the eggs hatcli, and the maggot 
irritates the flesh so much that large lumps are 




seen on the side or back of the animal. If the 
farmer does not press out the maggots from 
these himps, and put a proper dressing on them, 
the beef of the ox will be poor and bad, and no 
feeding will make it any better. When the maggot 
is full-grown it drops to the ground to make its 
change. 

The horse Bot-fly (3, p. 61) does not put her eggs 
under the skin, but sticks them, with a little slime 
from her mouth, to the hairs of the horse on his 
shoulder or under the knee. 

When the egg is ready to break, the warmth of 
the horse's tongue, as he licks himself, makes it 
crack and the grub slips down the horse's throat 
to his stomach. There it feeds, and when it is full- 
gro^vn passes out with the dung. 

The way to check this grub is to keep the skin 
of the horse clean and the hair short. This Bot- 
fly is rather larger than the House-fly, with 
bright yellow markings and a very hairy body. 

I wonder how many grubs you know of those 
gnat-like flies, with thin feelers and legs, which 
fly in the fields and over the rivers. We read 
about the gnat in Book II., but you should know 
the midges, which attack "v\^heat and other grain. 
! The Wheat-midge is a little orange yellow fly, 
about the size of a A^ery small gnat. Early on a 
June morning, when the wheat is in flower, you 
may shake these midges off the stalks and see them 
flying near the ground. The mothers have a 
sharp tube as thin as a hair, with ^vhich they 
lay their eggs in the ^vheat blossom. There they 




hatch into little red maggots, which feed on the 
grain and often destroy half a crop. 

You ought to know, too, the grubs of the 
Daddy-long-legs, which do so much harm to our 
crops. If you see a Daddy-long-legs clinging to 
a blade of grass she is most likely thrusting her 
egg-tube into the ground to lay her eggs. 

These hatch into legless brown grubs with 
strong jawp and a pair of short horns. Farmers 
call them • Leather Jackets," and you may find 
them when you are ploughing damp fields. Or you 
may find the hard pupa, which is shaped like a 
Daddy-long-legs with its wangs folded, its legs 
drawn up, and two horns on its head. It has 
spines on its abdomen, with which it will drag itself 
up when the fly wants to come out. 

The best way to get rid of these hurtful grubs 
is to plough the ground deeply and bury the eggs 
or maggots, so that they die, or cannot get to the 
surface, or to put a dressing of gas-lime or other 
insect-killer on the land. Starlings are very useful 
in pulling them out of the ground and eating them. 

Find grub and pupa of Blue-bottle. Examine a Blue- 
bottle—legs, body, and proboscis. Try to find House-fly eggs. 
Bi-ing in a Horse-fly. Try to find the Bot-flies of the ox and 
the horse. Find a Wheat-midge and its ^rub; also the grub 
and pupa of the Daddy-long-legs. 



All the insects about which we have been reading 
are different when they are young from what they are 




when full grown. But young Crickets and Grass- 
hoj)pers when they come out of the egg are much 
the same as when they are older, except that 
ohey are smaller and have no wings. They jump 
and eat and behave in the same way as their parents, 
and change their coats four or five times. Aftei- 
the last change you can see their wing-cases under- 
the skin, and, ^vhen this bursts, they spread their 
wings and fly. 

If you make a cage of wire gauze and put some 
young crickets in it, and feed them with damp leaves, 
you may see these changes. But do not try with 
a muslin cover, as a friend of mine did. For 
crickets have strong jaws and soon eat their way 
through. 

The little green Grasshoppers of the fields are 
easy to find, but the large green Grasshopper (see 
p. 71), is not so common. Still if you know where to 
look, in the nut-hedges and woods, you may often 
catch one, and it is a fine insect to examine. His 
head is well separated from his front body or thorax, 
and he has two very long feelers which lie back over 
his body. His jaws are very strong, and if you give 
him a leaf to eat, under a glass, j^ou can see how 
they move sideways to cut the food, and the 
upper and lower lips, through which he passes it 
to his chewing jaws inside. 

If you have caught a female, she will have a 
curious long tube or egg-layer at the end of her 
Taody, which she forces into the ground, to lay her 
eggs, and this will show you the way that other 
Bmaller insects do it. 





And now you will want to know how a grass- 
hopper chirps, for you will remember that no 
insect can make any noise with its mouth. Put 
your finger gently along, under the left front wing 
of the great green Grasshopper, close to where it is 
joined to the body. You m ill feel that it is rough 
like a file. The grasshopper rubs this file against 
the edge of the other wing, and makes the rasjaing 
noise. 

The small green Grasshopper (2, p. 71), which 
has short feelers standing forward from his head, 
makes his chirping noise in another way. He 
has a file on the inside of his hind leg, which he 
rubs against the top of his wing. This little grass- 
hopper is really a small locust, like those which fly 
in swarms over Europe, eating every green thing 
which comes in their way. Fortunately for us, 
though he eats very greedily, our little friend is not 
so destructive as they are. Locusts have no egg 
laying tube ; they drop their eggs into the loose 
sarth and cover them up. 

Crickets are very like grasshoppers, and make 
their chirping by rubbing their wings together. 
The females have long egg-laying tubes, as you 
will see if you can catch a moi;iier cricket in the 
kitchen. She lays her eggs behind the oven or near 
the fireplace, where they will hatch all the year 
round in the warmth. 

Grasslioppers and crickets do not chirp to please 
us, they are calling to each other. Therefore they 
must be able to hear. Where do you expect to find 
their ears ? I arn sure vou will never guess. 







Look under the wing of the small grasshopper 
on the first ring of his abdomen, the one behind his 
hind leg. There, a little above his breathing holes, 
you will see a very small hole. This has a thin skin 
over it, and it is his ear. The great grasshopper 
has his ear in a still more curiovis place, on his front 
leg below his knee (e, p. 70). 

I expect you will know the Field-cricket (3, p. 71), 
for though it is very timid, and seldom comes out in 

the day, yet if you 
find out where it lives, 
by its chirp, and poke 
a blade of grass down 
the cracks of the 
earth, it is sure to 
seize it, and you 
can draw it out. 
Many country 
children get them in this way. A Field-cricket is 
rather larger than the House-cricket ; his body is 
more yellow, and his chirp much more shrill. He is 
very useful in the garden, for he feeds on insects 
as well as plants, sitting outside his hole at night 
to catch them. But by day he is always in the 
ground, where the young ones remain all the 
winter till they get their wings. 

I wonder if you have ever found a Mole-cricket ? 
There are plenty in England in sandy ground, es- 
pecially in damp fields, and on the banks of canals 
and rivers. But they do not live in all parts of 
*;he country, and they are very shy, only coming 
out at night. Tliey make a strange croaking cry, 




and by it you may know that there are some in 
your neighbourhood. Then you must look along 
the river-bank or in a sandy and damp part of the 
garden, and if you can see ridges of earth thrown 
up, most likely the Mole-cricket will be working 
underneath. 

He is a very curious insect, about half an inch 
long, with a 
small head and 
long feelers, a 
very broad 
thorax, and 
thick flat front 
legs, ending in 
large feet like 
a mole, with 
sharp black 
claws. With 
these he digs his 
way through 
the earth, just 
as the mole 
does, and his 
body is covered 

with soft hairs, brown above and yellow beneath, to 
keep off the damj) earth. He does great mischief 
if he gets into a garden, for he tunnels along, eating 
the roots and stems of the plants. The mother 
Mole-cricket has no egg-laying tube, for she does 
not want it underground. She lays about 200 eggs 
in a chamber at the end of the run, and the young 
Mole-crickets live there for two or thre<^ ^^ears 




before they get their wings. If you can find a 
nest, and get a few of the young ones, you may 
see their curious shape. 

There are two other straight-winged insects 
which you knoTV quite well. One is the Earwig, of 
which some silly people are afraid, though it does no 
harm to anyone. Its pincers are used to fold its long 
hind wings under its short wing-cases, and the only 
mischief it does is to eat our flowers. The mother 
earwig is very affectionate. She carries aw^ay her 
eggs if they are disturbed, and watches over her 
little ones till they are full-grown. 

The other straight-winged insect is the Cock- 
roach, which people call "black beetle." It is not 
a beetle, for it does not grow out of a grub, and it 
is not black but brown. The young are like the old 
ones, only smaller and without wings. The mother 
cockroach never has any wings. She carries her 
eggs in a curious way at the end of her body in a 
case like a purse, and hides it behind the oven, or 
under the boards, just before the eggs are hatched. 
These cases are brown, horny, and shaped something 
like a bean. Inside there are about sixteen eggs, 
neatly arranged in two rows like peas in a pod. 
Cockroaches are very disagreeable and destructive 
insects. They eat everything they can get, and have 
a very repulsive smell. 

Try to find the different kinds of grasshopper and cricket, 
both full grown and before they have their wings. Examine 
the wings of an earwig. Find the egg-cases of the cocki'oach. 

 
Ants are the most intelligent of all insects. We 
learnt a little about the home of the Hill-ant in 
Book I., to which you can look back for drawing!- 
of the male, female, and worker ants with their 
grubs and cocoons. 

Now we will look at some other ants, and learn 
about their ways. There are two very common 
kinds to be found in most 
gardens. One is red and the 
other black. They both build 
their homes underground, by 
clearing out the earth with i 
their jaws and feet, and so 
making galleries and cham- 
bers. There is generally a 
little rise in the ground, 
where they are at work, 
making a dome above the nest, but it is not so 
conspicuous as the hill of the Hill-ant. If you dig 
a deep hole on one side of a nest you will open 
the chambers and see the grubs inside them, and. 
if you do not make it too big, the busy ants will 
soon put it right again. 

Then you can take a few cocoons, and put them 
in a little earth under a glass so as to see the 
young ants come out. But do not take the grubs, 
unless you take some grown-up ants with them, for 
they cannot feed themselves. 

If you get a black and a red ant you will know 



them apart, not only by their colour, out because 
the black ant has one round knob (1, p. 75) in the 
thin part joining her hind body to her fore body, 
w^hile tlie red ant has two knobs (2, p. 75). By this 
we know that the red ant has a sting, and the 
black ant has none. All English ants which have 
two knobs to their abdomen can sting; but those 
with only one knob cannot (with one rare excep- 
tion). Those which have no sting attack their 
enemy with their strong jaws, and squirt out a 
strong acid over them. 

There is a little yellow ant which lives in our 
houses and eats our food. She has two knobs, and 
stings quite sharply. I once cut open a cake w^hich 
had been some days in the cupboard and found the 
middle full of these ants. They swarmed on my 
hand and made it tingle with their stings. This 
ant generally makes her home behind the fireplace. 

If you put your ants under a glass, and give them 
a piece of nut or bread to eat, you may see them 
use their outer jaws to scrape the surface, and their 
tiny tongue to lick off the juice or oil, while they pass 
the food to the inner jaws, just as the bees and 
wasps did. You may also see them pause to stroke 
their body with their front legs. Look closely at 
these and you will see a small spur on a joint a 
little way up the leg. This spvir has more than 
fifty fine teeth on it, and there are some coarse 
teeth on the leg itself. These are the ant's brush 
and comb. She scrapes herself with them, and then 
draws them through her outer jaws, or inandibles, 
to clean them. 



She has very small eyes, and always uses her 
antennae to find out anything she wants to 
know. These stand out in front of her curious 
flat head, and are very mysterious instruments. 
When ants want to talk to one another they touch 
their antennae, and in some strange way they can 
tell each other where to go and what to do. 

The Garden-ants live much more underground 
than the Hill-ants, but you may often see them 
sunning themselves in the garden, or cutting off 




blades of grass with their mandibles to line their 
nests, or tearing a spider or fly to pieces. They 
often seem to run hither and thither as if they 
did not know what they were doing, but if you 
watch you will And that each one has an object. 
Some are carrying things into the nest, others 
are climbing the stalks of the flowers to sip their 
honey. As these honey-laden ants go home, if they 
meet with an ant which has been doing other work 
and is hungry, the well-fed ant will squeeze honey 
out of her throat to feed her friend. For it seems to 
be a rule among ants that each one helps the other. 



And now you must watch day by day till you 
see a much more ^^onclerful thing. You will re- 
member that we saw in the first lesson little plant- 
lice called Aphides sucking juice out of the stalks 
of plants. But we did not notice that they have 
tw^o little horns at the end of their bodies. As 
they suck and suck they become too full, and the 
sweet juice often oozes out of these horns. You 
may see it standing in tiny drops on their tips. 

This juice is just what the ant loves, and you 
may be fortunate enough to see the garden-ant 
take it, because she brings the aphides and puts 
them on daisies near her nest. She goes up behind 
the aphis and strokes its sides with her antennae, 
so that it gives out a drop of honey from its horns. 

She has another her'? of these honey-cows 
safely hidden underground where you cannot see 
them. She carries them down into her galleries, 
and puts them on the roots of plants. There she 
takes care of them, just as she does of her own 
grubs, and keeps their eggs and young ones through 
the winter, ready for the next spring. In our cli- 
mate ants sleep through the winter, but in warmer 
countries they remain awake and store up food. 

When you are digging into the nest of a Garden- 
ant look very carefully at the roots you dig up, and 
you will most likely see some plant-lice on them. If 
you put them carefully back they will be none the 
worse, and the little ant will not have lost her 
honey-cows. 

There is a small yellow ant called the Meadow- 
ant, which lives in great numbers on heaths and 



meadows, and has no sting. She keeps nearly all 
her honey-cows underground, putting them on 
the roots of the grass. Sometimes when you ar€ 
ploughing up a field you may cut through one of 
these nests. If you do, stoj) a minute and watch 
the ants. Their first care will be for the ant-grubs 
and cocoons. But as soon as these are carried down 
you will see them fetching the little green plant-lice 
as carefully as if they were their own children. 

The Hill-ants do not bring their cows home. 
They visit them on the plants, and many battles 
between the ants of two nests begin because one 
colony has interfered with the other's cows. Then 
the working ants turn out of both nests and fall 
upon each other two and two, biting with their 
mandibles and standing on their hind legs, each 
trying to squirt formic acid over its enemy. These 
battles often go on for some days till one party is 
exhausted. 

The battles are fought, and the honey-cows are 
milked, by the working ants, of which there may 
be thousands in a large nest. The queen-ants do 
no work, beyond laying the eggs. There may be 
two or three queen-ants in a large nest, and they 
never quarrel like queen-bees. When they are 
laying eggs in the home they have no wings. But 
in the summer there will be a number of winged 
male and female ants growing up in the nest, and 
some warm day they fly out, and you may see 
them rising and falling in the air like gnats. 
Then they tumble helplessly to the ground and 
crawl about The m/^les are eaten by birds or die. 




None of them go back to the nest. Those of the 
females which are not killed have their wings pulled 
off by the workers, or pull them off themselves, and 
they go back to lay eggs, or join a new nest. 

Find any ants you can. Keep them a little, feeding them 
with honey and giving them some earth to build. Keep a few 
aphides on a plant to see the honey-drops. Examine an ant's 
nest by opening the side; put the aphides and cocoons back 
carefully. 






With big tin trumpet and little red drum. 
Marching like soldiers, the children come! 

It 's this way and that way they circle and file — 

My I but that music of theirs is fine / 
This way and that way, and after a while 
They march straight into this heart of mine! 
A sturdy old heart, but it has to succumb 
To the blare of that t7'timpet and beat of that drum / 

Come on, little people, from cot and from hall — 
This heart it hath welcome and room for you all! 
It will sing you its songs and warm you with love. 
As your dear little arms with my ar?7is intertwine ; 
It will rock you away to the dreamland above — 
Oh, a jolly old heart is this old heart of mine. 
And jollier still is it bound to become 
When you blow that big trumpet and beat that red drum ! 

So come ; thougJi I see not his dear little face 

And hear not his voice in this jubilant place, 

I knoiv he were happy to bid me enshrine 

His memory deep in my heart with your play — 
Ah me! but a love that is sweeter t/ian mine 
Holdeth my boy iit its keeping to-day ! 
And my Jieart it is lonely — so, little folk, come, 
MarcJi in and tnake merry wit/i trumpet and drum!

HAVE you ever heard of the Sugar-Plum Tree? 
'Tis a marvel of great renown! 
It blooms on the shore of the Lollipop sea 

In the garden of Shut-Eye Town; 
The fruit that it bears is so wondrously sweet 

(As those who have tasted it say) 
That good little children have only to eat 
Of that fruit to be happy next day. 

When you 've got to the tree, you would have 
a hard time 

To capture the fruit which I sing; 
The tree is so tall that no person could climb 

To the boughs where the sugar-plums swing ! 




But up in that tree sits a chocolate cat, 
And a gingerbread dog prowls below — 

And this is the way you contrive to get at 
Those sugar-plums tempting you so: 



Vou say but the word to that gingerbread dog 

And he barks with such terrible zest 
That the chocolate cat is at once all agog, 

As her swelling proportions attest. 
And the chocolate cat goes cavorting around 

From this leafy limb unto that, 
And the sugar-plums tumble, of course, to the 
ground — 

Hurrah for that chocolate cat! 



There are marshmallows, gumdrops, and pep- 
permint canes, 

With stripings of scarlet or gold. 
And you carry away of the treasure that rains 

As much as your apron can hold! 



So come, little child, cuddle closer to me 
In your dainty white nightcap and gown. 

And I '11 rock you away to that Sugar-Plum 
Tree 
In the garden of Shut-Eye Town. 



KRiNKEN was a little child, — 
It was summer when he smiled 
Oft the hoary sea and grim 
Stretched its white arms out to him, 
Calling, " Sun-child, come to me ; 
Let me warm my heart with thee i " 
But the child heard not the sea. 

Krinken on the beach one day 

Saw a maiden Nis at play; 

Fair, and very fair, was she. 

Just a little child was he. 
" Krinken," said the maiden Nis, 
" Let me have a little kiss,— - 

Just a kiss, and go with me 

To the summer-lands that be 

Down within the silver sea." 



Krinken was a little child, 
By the maiden Nis beguiled; 
Down into the calling sea 
With the maiden Nis went he. 

But the sea calls out no more; 
It is winter on the shore, — 
Winter where that little child 
Made sweet summer when he smiled 
Though 't is summer on the sea 
Where with maiden Nis went he, — 
Summer, summer evermore, — 
It is winter on the shore, 
Winter, winter evermore. 

Of the summer on the deep 
Come sweet visions in my sleep; 
His fair face lifts from the sea, 
His dear voice calls out to me, — 
These my dreams of summer be. 

Krinken was a little child, 
By the maiden Nis beguiled; 




Oft the hoary sea and grim 
Reached its longing arms to him, 
Crying, "Sun-child, come to me; 
Let me warm my heart with thee ! " 
But the sea calls out no more; 
It is winter on the shore, — 
Winter, cold and dark and wild; 
Krinken was a little child, — 
It was summer when he smiled; 
Down he went into the sea. 
And the winter bides with me. 
Just a little child was he. 



MY dolly is a dreadful care, — 
Her name is Miss Amandy; 
I dress her up and curl her hair, 

And feed her taffy candy. 
Yet heedless of the pleading voice 

Of her devoted mother, 
She will not wed her mother's choice. 
But says she '11 wed another. 

I 'd have her wed the china vase, — 

There is no Dresden rarer; 
You might go searching every place 

And never find a fairer. 
He is a gentle, pinkish youth, — 

Of that there 's no denying; 
Yet when I speak of him, forsooth, 

Amandy falls to crying! 



She loves the drum — that's very plain — 

And scorns the vase so clever ; 
And weeping, vows she will remain 

A spinster doll forever ! 
The protestations of the drum 

I am convinced are hollow; 
When once distressing times should come, 

How soon would ruin follow ! 

Yet all in vain the Dresden boy 

From yonder mantel woos her; 
A mania for that vulgar toy. 

The noisy drum, imbues her! 
In vain I wheel her to and fro, 

And reason with her mildly, — 
Her waxen tears in torrents flow, 

Her sawdust heart beats wildly. 

I 'm sure that when I 'm big and tall, 
And wear long trailing dresses, 

I sha'n't encourage beaux at all 
Till mama acquiesces; 




Our choice will be a suitor then 
As pretty as this vase is,— 

Oh, how we '11 hate the noisy men 
With whiskers on their faces! 



THE mill goes toiling slowly around 
With steady and solemn creak, 
And my little one hears in the kindly sound 

The voice of the old mill speak. 
While round and round those big white wings 

Grimly and ghosthke creep, 
My little one hears that the old mill sings: 
"Sleep, little tulip, sleep!" 

The sails are reefed and the nets are drawn, 

And, over his pot of beer, 
The fisher, against the morrow's dawn. 

Lustily maketh cheer; 
He mocks at the winds that caper along 

From the far-off clamorous deep — 
But we — we love their lullaby song 

Of " Sleep, little tulip, sleep ! " 



Old dog Fritz in slumber sound 

Groans of the stony mart — 
To-morrow how proudly he '11 trot you round, 

Hitched to our new milk-cart! 
And you shall help me blanket the kine 

And fold the gentle sheep 
And set the herring a-soak in brine — 

But now, little tulip, sleep ! 

A Dream- One comes to button the eyes 
That wearily droop and blink, 

While the old mill buffets the frowning skies 
And scolds at the stars that wink; 

Over your face the misty wings 

Of that beautiful Dream-One sweep, 

And rocking your cradle she softly sings ^ 
'^ Sleep, little tulip, sleep!" 


WILLIE and Bess, Georgie and May — 
Once, as these children were hard at play, 
An old man, hoary and tottering, came 
And watched them playing their pretty game. 
He seemed to wonder, while standing there, 

What the meaning thereof could be — 
Aha, but the old man yearned to share 
Of the little children's innocent glee 
As they circled around with laugh and shout 
And told their rime at counting out: 
" Intry-mintry, cutrey-corn, 
Apple-seed and apple-thorn; 
Wire, brier, limber, lock, 
Twelve geese in a flock; 
Some flew east, some flew west, 
Some flew over the cuckoo's nest ! " 



Willie and Bess, Georgie and May — 
Ah, the mirth of that summer-day ! 
'T was Fa,ther Time who had come to share 
The innocent joy of those children there; 
He learned betimes the game they played 

And into their sport with them went he — 
How could the children have been afraid, 

Since Httle they recked whom he might be ? 
They laughed to hear old Father Time 
Mumbling that curious nonsense rime 

Of " Intry-mintry, cutrey-com, 

Apple-seed and apple-thorn; 

Wire, brier, limber, lock. 

Twelve geese in a flock; 

Some flew east, some flew west. 

Some flew over the cuckoo's nest!" 



Willie and Bess, Georgie and May, 
And joy of summer — where are they? 
The grim old man still standeth near 
Crooning the song of a far-ofl" year ; 


And into the winter I come alone, 

Cheered by that mournful requiem, 
Soothed by the dolorous monotone 

That shall count me off as it counted 
them — 
The solemn voice of old Father Time 
Chanting the homely nursery rime 

He learned of the children a summer mom 
When, with " apple-seed and apple-thorn," 
Life was full of the dulcet cheer 
That bringeth the grace of heaven anear — 
The sound of the little ones hard at play- 
Willie and Bess, Georgie and May. 




ALL day long they come and go — 
Pittypat and Tippytoe; 
Footprints up and down the hall, 

Playthings scattered on the iioor, 
Finger-marks along the wall, 
Tell-tale smudges on the door — 
By these presents you shall know 
Pittypat and Tippytoe. 

How they riot at their play! 
And a dozen times a day 

In they troop, demanding bread — 

Only buttered bread will do. 
And that butter must be spread 
Inches thick with sugar too! 
And I never can say " No, 
Pittypat and Tippytoe!" 



Sometimes there are griefs to soothe, 
Sometimes ruffled brows to smooth; 
For (I much regret to say) 

Tippytoe and Pittypat 
Sometimes interrupt their play 
With an internecine spat; 
Fie, for shame! to quarrel so — 
Pittypat and Tippytoe! 

Oh the thousand worrying things 
Every day recurrent brings! 

Hands to scrub and hair to brushy 
Search for playthings gone amiss. 
Many a wee complaint to hush, 
Many a little bump to kiss; 
Life seems one vain, fleeting show 
To Pittypat and Tippytoe! 

And when day is at an end, 
There are little duds to mend: 
Little frocks are strangely torn, 

Little shoes great holes reveal, 
Little hose, but one day worn, 
Rudely yawn at toe and heel! 



Who but you could work such woe, 
Pittypat and Tippytoe? 

But when comes this thought to me; 
"Some there are that childless be," 
Stealing to their little beds. 

With a love I cannot speak. 
Tenderly I stroke their heads — 
Fondly kiss each velvet cheek. 
God help those who do not know 
A Pittypat or Tippytoe! 

On the floor and down the hall, 

Rudely smutched upon the wall. 

There are proofs in every kind 

Of the havoc they have wrought, 
And upon my heart you 'd find 

Just such trade-marks, if you sought; 
Oh, how glad I am 't is so, 
Pittypat and Tippytoe! 



HUSH, bonnie, dinna greit; 
Moder will rocke her sweete,- 
Balow, my boy ! 
When that his toile ben done, 
Daddie will come anone, — 
Hush thee, my lyttel one; 
Balow, my boy). 

Gin thou dost sleepe, perchaunce 
Fayries will come to daunce, — 

Balow, my boy! 
Oft hath thy moder scene 
Moonlight and mirkland queene 
Daunce on thy slumbering een, — 

Balow, my boy! 



Then droned a bomblebee 
Saftly this songe to thee: 
"Balow, my boy!" 

And a wee heather bell, 
Pluckt from a fayry dell, 
Chimed thee this rune hersell: 
" Balow, my boy ! " 

Soe, bonnie, dinna greit; 
Moder doth rock her sweete,- 

Balow, my boy! 
Give mee thy lyttel hand, 
Moder will hold it and 
Lead thee to balow land,—* 

Balow, my boy! 




THE Hawthorne children — seven in all- 
Are famous friends of mine, 
And with what pleasure I recall 
How, years ago, one gloomy fall, 
I took a tedious railway line 
And journeyed by slow stages down 
Unto that sleepy seaport town 
(Albeit one worth seeing). 
Where Hildegarde, John, Henry, Fred, 
And Beatrix and Gwendolen 
And she that was the baby then — 
These famous seven, as aforesaid, 
Lived, moved, and had their being. 

The Hawthorne children gave me such 

A welcome by the sea, 
That the eight of us were soon in touch. 
And though their mother marveled much, 

Happy as larks were we I 



Egad I was a boy again 
With Henry, John, and Gwendolen ! 
And, oh ! the funny capers 
I cut with Hildegarde and Fred ! 
The pranks we heedless children played, 
The deafening, awful noise we made — 
'T would shock my family, if they read 
About it in the papers! 



The Hawthorne children all were smart; 

The girls, as I recall. 
Had comprehended every art 
Appealing to the head and heart, 

The boys were gifted, all; 
'T was Hildegarde who showed me how 
To hitch the horse and milk a cow 

And cook the best of suppers; 
With Beatrix upon the sands 
I sprinted daily, and was beat, 
While Henry stumped me to the feat 
Of walking round upon my hands 

Instead of on my " uppers." 


The Hawthorne children liked me besf 

Of evenings, after tea; 
For then, by general request, 
I spun them yams about the west — 

And all involving Me! 
I represented how I 'd slain 
The bison on the gore-smeared plain, 

And divers tales of wonder 
I told of how I 'd fought and bled . 
In Injun scrimmages galore. 
Till Mrs. Hawthorne quoth " No more ! " 
And packed her darlings off to bed 

To dream of blood and thunder! 



They must have changed a deal since then : 

The misses tall and fair 
And those three lusty, handsome men. 
Would they be girls and boys again 

Were I to happen there, 
Down in that spot beside the sea 
Where we made such tumultuous glee 




In dull autumnal weather? 
Ah me! the years go swiftly by, 
And yet how fondly I recall 
The week when we were children all — 
Dear Hawthorne children, you and I — - 
Just eight of us, together! 



SLEEP, little pigeon, and fold your wings — 
Little blue pigeon with velvet eyes; 
Sleep to tne singing of mother-bird swinging — 
Swinging the nest where her little one lies. 

Away out yonder I see a star— 
Silvery star with a tinkling song; 

To the soft dew falling I hear it calling — 
Calling and tinkling the night along. 

In through the window a moonbeam comes — 
Little gold moonbeam with misty wings; 

All silently creeping, it asks : " Is he sleeping — 
Sleeping and dreaming while mother sings ? " 



LITTLE BLUE PIGEON 25 

Up from the sea there floats the sob 

Of the waves that are breaking upon the 
shore, 
As though they were groaning in anguish, and 
moaning — 
Bemoaning the ship that shall come no more. 

But sleep, little pigeon, and fold your wings — 
Little blue pigeon with mournful eyes; 

Am I not singing? — see, I am swinging — 
Swinging the nest where my darling lies. 



SOME time there ben a lyttel boy 
That wolde not renne and play, 
And helpless like that little tyke 
Ben allwais in the way. 
" Goe, make you merrie with the rest," 
His weary moder cried; 
But with a frown he catcht her gown 
And hong untill her side. 

That boy did love his moder well. 

Which spake him faire, I ween; 
He loved to stand and hold her hand 

And ken her with his een; 
His cosset bleated in the croft. 

His toys unheeded lay, — 
He wolde not goe, but, tarrying soe, 

Ben allwais in the way. 
26 



Godde loveth children and doth gird 

His throne with soche as these, 
And he doth smile in plaisaunce while 

They cluster at his knees; 
And some time, when he looked on earth 

And watched the bairns at play, 
He kenned with joy a lyttel boy 

Ben allwais in the way. 

And then a moder felt her heart 

How that it ben to-torne. 
She kissed eche day till she ben gray 

The shoon he use to worn; 
No bairn let hold untill her gown 

Nor played upon the floore, — 
Godde's was the joy; a lyttel boy 

Ben in the way no more! 



EVERY evening, after tea, 
Teeny-Weeny comes to me. 
And, astride my willing knee, 

Plies his lash and rides away; 
Though that palfrey, all too spare^ 
Finds his burden hard to bear, 
Teeny-Weeny does n't care; 
He commands, and I obey! 

First it 's trot, and gallop then; 
Now it 's back to trot again; 
Teeny-Weeny likes it when 

He is riding fierce and fast. 
Then his dark eyes brighter grow 
And his cheeks are all aglow: 
" More ! " he cries, and never " Whoa ! 
Till the horse breaks down at last. 
28 


Oh, the strange and lovely sights 

Teeny- Weeny sees of nights, 

As he makes those famous flights 

On that wondrous horse of his! 
Oftentimes before he knows, 
Wearylike his eyelids close, 
And, still smiling, off he goes 

Where the land of By-low is. 

There he sees the folk of fay 
Hard at ring-a-rosie play. 
And he hears those fairies say: 
" Come, let 's chase him to and fro ! 
But, with a defiant shout. 
Teeny puts that host to rout; 
Of this tale I make no doubt, 
Every night he tells it so. 

So I feel a tender pride 
In my boy who dares to ride 
That fierce horse of his astride. 
Off into those misty lands ; 



And as on my breast he lies, 
Dreaming in that wondrous wis£&gt; 
I caress his folded eyes, 

Pat his Httle dimpled hands. 

On a time he went away, 
Just a Uttle while to stay, 
And I 'm not ashamed to say 

I was very lonely then; 
Life without him was so sad, 
You can fancy I was glad 
And made merry when I had 

Teeny-Weeny back again! 

So of evenings, after tea. 
When he toddles up to me 
And goes tugging at my knee, 

You should hear his palfrey neigh i 
You should see him prance and shy, 
When, with an exulting cry, 
Teeny-Weeny, vaulting high, 

Plies his lash and rides away! 





IS listening soul hears no echo of battle, 
No psean of triumph nor welcome of fame; 
But down through the years comes a little 
one's prattle, 
And softly he murmurs her idolized name. 
And it seems as if now at his heart she were 
clinging 
As she clung in those dear, distant years to 
his knee; 
He sees her fair face, and he hears her sweet 
singing— 
And NelUe is coming from over the sea. 

While each patriot's hope stays the fullness of 
sorrow, 
While our eyes are bedimmed and our 
voices are low, 



He dreams of the daughter who comes with 
the morrow 
Like an angel come back from the dear 
long ago. 
Ah, what to him now is a nation's emotion, 

And what for our love or our grief careth he ? 
A swift-speeding ship is a-sail on the ocean. 
And Nellie is coming from over the sea! 

O daughter — my daughter! when Death 
stands before me 
And beckons me off to that far misty shore, 
Let me see your loved form bending tenderly 
o'er me. 
And feel your dear kiss on my lips as of yore. 
In the grace of your love all my anguish abating, 
I '11 bear myself bravely and proudly as he, 
And know the sweet peace that hallowed his 
waiting 
When NelHe was coming from over the sea. 



I^HE sky is dark and the hills are white 
As the storm-king speeds from the north 
to-night; 
And this is the song the storm-king sings, 
As over the world his cloak he flings: 

"Sleep, sleep, little one, sleep"; 
He rustles his wings and gruffly sings: 
"Sleep, little one, sleep." 

On yonder mountain-side a vine 
Clings at the foot of a mother pine; 
The tree bends over the trembling thing, 
And only the vine can hear her sing: 
" Sleep, sleep, little one, sleep — 
What shall you fear when I am here? 
Sleep, little one, sleep." 


The king may sing in his bitter flight, 
The tree may croon to the vine to-night, 
But the Httle snowflake at my breast 
Liketh the song / sing the best — 

Sleep, sleep, httle one, sleep; 
Weary thou art, a-next my heart 

Sleep, Httle one, sleep. 



1PRAY that, risen from the dead, 
I may in glory stand — 
A crown, perhaps, upon my head, 
But a needle in my hand. 

I Ve never learned to sing or play., 
So let no harp be mine; 

From birth unto my dying day, 
Plain sewing 's been my line. 

Therefore, accustomed to the end 
To plying useful stitches, 

I '11 be content if asked to mend 
The Uttle angels' breeches. 





SOME TIME 

LAST night, my darling, as you slept, 
• I thought I heard you sigh, 
And to your little crib I crept, 

And watched a space thereby; 
Then, bending down, I kissed your brow- 

For, oh! I love you so — 
You are too young to know it now, 
But some time you shall know. 

Some time, when, in a darkened place 

Where others come to weep. 
Your eyes shall see a weary face 

Calm in eternal sleep; 
The speechless lips, the wrinkled brow, 

The patient smile may show — 
You are too young to know it now, 

But some time you shall know. 


Look backward, then, into the years. 

And see me here to-night — 
See, O my darHng ! how my tears 

Are falling as I write; 
And feel once more upon your brow 

The kiss of long ago — 
You are too young to know it now. 

But some time you shall know. 


s I am sitting in the sun upon the porch 

to-day, 
1 look with wonder at the elm that stands 

across the way; 
I say and mean " with wonder," for now it 

seems to me 
That elm is not as tall as years ago it used 

to be! 
The old fire-hangbird 's built her nest therein 

for many springs — 
High up amid the sportive winds the curious 

cradle swings, 
But not so high as when a little boy I did 

my best 
To scale that elm and carry off the old fire- 

hangbird's nest! 



The Hubbard boys had tried in vain to reach 
the homely prize 

That dangled from that upper outer twig in 
taunting wise, 

And once, when Deacon Turner's boy had 
almost grasped the limb. 

He fell! and had to have a doctor operate 
on him ! 

Philetus Baker broke his leg and Orrin Root 
his arm- — 

But what of that? The danger gave the 
sport a special charm! 

The Bixby and the Cutler boys, the New- 
tons and the rest 

Ran every risk to carry off the old fire-hang- 
bird's nest! 



I can remember that I used to knee my 

trousers through, 
That mother used to wonder how my legs 

got black and blue, 


And how she used to talk to me and make 

stern threats when she 
Discovered that my hobby was the nest in 

yonder tree; 
How, as she patched my trousers or greased 

my purple legs, 
She told me 't would be wicked to destroy a 

hangbird's eggs, 
A.nd then she 'd call on father and on gran'pa 

to attest 
That they, as boys, had never robbed an old 

fire-hangbird's nest! 



Yet all those years I coveted the trophy flaunt- 
ing there, 

While, as it were in mockery of my abject 
despair. 

The old fire-hangbird confidently used to 
come and go, 

As if she were indifferent to the bandit horde 
below ! 



And sometimes clinging to her nest we thought 

we heard her chide 
The callow brood whose cries betrayed the 

fear that reigned inside : 
" Hush, Httle dears ! all profitless shall be their 

wicked quest — 
I knew my business when I built the old fire- 

hangbird's nest ! " 



For many, very many years that mother-bird 
has come 

To rear her pretty little brood within that cozy 
home. 

She is the selfsame bird of old — I 'm certain 
it is she — 

Although the chances are that she has quite 
forgotten me. 

Just as of old that prudent, crafty bird of com- 
pound name 

(And in parenthesis I '11 say her nest is still 
the same); 



Just as of old the passion, too, that fires the 

youthful breast 
To dimb unto and comprehend the old fire- 

hangbird's nest 1 



I like to see my old-time friend swing in that 

ancient tree. 
And, if the elm 's as tall and sturdy as it used 

to be, 
I 'm sure that many a year that nest shall in 

the breezes blow. 
For boys are n't what they used to be a forty 

years ago ! 
The elm looks shorter than it did when bro- 
ther Rufe and I 
Beheld with envious hearts that trophy flaunted 

from on high; 
He writes that in the city where he 's living 

'way out West 
His little boys have never seen an old fire- 

hangbird's nest! 



Poor little chaps! how lonesomelike their city 

life must be — 
1 wish they 'd come and live awhile in this 

old house with me! 
They 'd have the honest friends and healthful 

sports I used to know 
When brother Rufe and I were boys a forty 

years ago. 
So, when they grew from romping lads to 

busy, useful men, 
They could recall with proper pride their 

country life again; 
And of those recollections of their youth I 'm 

sure the best 
Would be of how they sought in vain the olc^ 

fire-hanojbird's nest! 


BUTTERCUP, Poppy, Forget-me-not — 
These three bloomed in a garden spot; 
And once, all merry with song and play, 
A little one heard three voices say: 
"Shine and shadow, summer and spring, 
O thou child with the tangled hair 
And laughing eyes! we three shall bring 
Each an offering passing fair." 
The little one did not understand, 
But they bent and kissed the dimpled hand. 

Buttercup gamboled all day long. 
Sharing the httle one's mirth and song; 
Then, stealing along on misty gleams, 
Poppy came bearing the sweetest dreams. 



Playing and dreaming — and that was all 
Till once a sleeper would not awake; 
Kissing the little face under the pall, 
We thought of the words the third flower 
spake; 
And we found betimes in a hallowed spot 
The solace and peace of Forget-me-not. 

Buttercup shareth the joy of day, 
Glinting with gold the hours of play; 
Bringeth the poppy sweet repose, 
When the hands would fold and the eyes 
would close; 
And after it all — the play and the sleep 

Of a little hfe — what cometh then? 
To the hearts that ache and the eyes that 
weep 
A new flower bringeth God's peace again. 
Each one serveth its tender lot— 
Buttercup, Poppy, Forget-me-not. 




WYNKEN, Blynken, and Nod one night 
Sailed off in a wooden shoe — 
Sailed on a river of crystal light, 
Into a sea of dew. 
"Where are you going, and what do you 
wish ? " 
The old moon asked the three. 
"We have come to fish for the herring fish 
That live in this beautiful sea; 
Nets of silver and gold have we ! " 
Said Wynken, 
Blynken, 
And Nod. 

The old moon laughed and sang a song, 
As they rocked in the wooden shoe. 

And the wind that sped them all night long 
Ruffled the waves of dew. 


The little stars were the herring fish 
That lived in that beautiful sea — 
"Now cast your nets wherever you wish — 
Never afeard are we " ; 
So cried the stars to the fishermen three: 
Wynken, 
Blynken, 
And Nod. 



All night long their nets they threw 

To the stars in the twinkling foam — 
Then down from the skies came the wooden shoe, 

Bringing the fishermen home; 
'T was all so pretty a sail it seemed 

As if it could not be, 
And some folks thought 't was a dream they'd 
dreamed 
Of sailing that beautiful sea—' 
But I shall name you the fishermen three: 
Wynken, 
Blynken, 
And Nod. 




Wynken and Blynken are two little eyes, 

And Nod is a little head, 
And the wooden shoe that sailed the skies 

Is a wee one's trundle-bed. 
So shut your eyes while mother sings 

Of wonderful sights that be, 
And you shall see the beautiful things 
As you rock in the misty sea, 
Where the old shoe rocked the fishermen 
three : 

Wynken, 
Blynken, 
And Nod. 



GOLD AND LOVE FOR DEARIE 

OUT on the mountain over the town, 
All night long, all night long, 
The trolls go up and the trolls go down, 

Bearing their packs and singing a song; 
And this is the song the hill-folk croon. 
As they trudge in the light of the misty 

moon — 
This is ever their dolorous tune: 
" Gold, gold ! ever more gold — 

Bright red gold for dearie!" 

Deep in the hill a father delves 
All night long, all night long; 

None but the peering, furtive elves 
Sees his toil and hears his song; 


Merrily ever the cavern rings 
As merrily ever his pick he swings, 
And merrily ever this song he sings: 
" Gold, gold ! ever more gold — 

Bright red gold for dearie!" 

Mother is rocking thy lowly bed 
All night long, all night long, 
Happy to smooth thy curly head, 

To hold thy hand and to sing her *song : 
'Tis not of the hill-folk dwarfed and old, 
Nor the song of thy father, stanch and bola- 
And the burthen it beareth is not of gold. 
But it 's "Love, love! nothing but love^ 
Mother's love for dearie ! " 


DEAREST, how hard it is to say 
That all is for the best, 
Since, sometimes, in a grievous way- 
God's will is manifest. 

See with what hearty, noisy glee 

Our little ones to-night 
Dance round and round our Christmas tree 

With pretty toys bedight. 

Dearest, one voice they may not hear. 

One face they may not see— 
Ah, what of all this Christmas cheer 

Cometh to you and me ? 



Cometh before our misty eyes 

That other little face, 
And we clasp, in tender, reverent wise; 

That love in the old embrace. 



Dearest, the Christ-Child walks to-night. 

Bringing his peace to men, 
A.nd he bringeth to you and to me the light 

Of the old, old years again. 



Bringeth the peace of long ago, 
When a wee one clasped your knee 

.And lisped of the morrow — dear one, you 
know — 
And here come back is he ! 



Dearest, 't is sometimes hard to say 

That all is for the best. 
For, often, in a grievous way 

God's will is manifest. 




But in the grace of this holy night 
That bringeth us back our child, 

Let us see that the ways of God are right, 
And so be reconciled. 




You *RE not so big as you were then, 
.. O little brook! — 
I mean those hazy summers when 
We boys roamed, full of awe, beside 
Your noisy, foaming, tumbling tide, 
And wondered if it could be true 
That there were bigger brooks than you, 
O mighty brook, O peerless brook! 

All up and down this reedy place 

Where lives the brook, 
We angled for the furtive dace; 
The redwing-blackbird did his best 
To make us think he 'd built his nest 
Hard by the stream, when, like as not. 
He 'd hung it in a secret spot 

Far from the brook, the telltale brook 1 




And often, when the noontime heat 

Parboiled the brook, 
We 'd draw our boots and swing our feet 
Upon the waves that, in their play, 
Would tag us last and scoot away; 
And mother never seemed to know 
What burnt our legs and chapped them so — 

But father guessed it was the brook! 



And Fido — how he loved to swim 

The cooling brook, 
Whenever we 'd throw sticks for him; 
And how we boys did wish that we 
Could only swim as good as he — 
Why, Daniel Webster never was 
Recipient of such great applause 

As Fido, battling with the brook! 



But once — O most unhappy day 

For you, my brook! — 
Came Cousin Sam along that way; 



And, having lived a spell out West, 
Where creeks are n't counted much at best, 
He neither waded, swam, nor leapt, 
But, with superb indifference, stept 

Across that brook — our mighty brook! 

Why do you scamper on your way, 

You little brook. 
When I come back to you to-day? 
Is it because you flee the grass 
That lunges at you as you pass, 
As if, in playful mood, it would 
Tickle the truant if it could. 

You chuckling brook — you saucy brook? 

Or is it you no longer know — 

You fickle brook — 
The honest friend of long ago ? 
The years that kept us twain apart 
Have changed my face, but not my heart— 
Many and sore those years, and yet 
T. fancied you could not forget 

That happy time, my playmate brook! 



Oh, sing again in artless glee, 

My little brook, 
The song you used to sing for me — 
The song that 's lingered in my ears 
So soothingly these many years; 
My grief shall be forgotten when 
I hear your tranquil voice again 

And that sweet song, dear little brook! 




o, pretty bee, did you see my croodlin' doo ? 

Ho, little lamb, is she jinkin' on the lea? 

Ho, bonnie fairy, bring my dearie back 

to me — 

Got a lump o' sugar an' a posie for you, 

Only bring me back my wee, wee croodlin' doo ! 

Why! here you are, my litde croodlin' doo! 
Looked in er cradle, but did n't find you 

there — 
Looked f'r my wee, wee croodlin' doo 
ever' where; 
Be'n kind lonesome all er day withouten you — 
Where you be'n, my teeny, wee, wee croodlin' 
doo? 



Now you go balow, my little croodlin' doo; 
Now you go rockaby ever so far, — 
Rockaby, rockaby up to the star 
That 's winkin' an' blinkin' an' singin' to you, 
As you go balow, my wee, wee croodlin' doo) 


LITTLE Mistress Sans-Merci 
J Fareth world-wide, fancy free: 
Trotteth cooing to and fro, 

And her cooing is command — 
Never ruled there yet, I trow, 
Mightier despot in the land. 
And my heart it Heth where 
Mistress Sans-Merci doth fare. 

Little Mistress Sans-Merci — 
She hath made a slave of me! 
"Go," she biddeth, and I go — 
"Come," and I am fain to come — 
Never mercy doth she show. 
Be she wroth or frolicsome. 
Yet am I content to be 
Slave to Mistress Sans-Merci! 


Little Mistress Sans-Merci 
Hath become so dear to me 
That I count as passing sweet 

All the pain her moods impart, 
And I bless the little feet 

That go trampling on my heart: 
Ah, how lonely life would be 
But for little Sans-Merci ! 

Little Mistress Sans-Merci, 
Cuddle close this night to me, 
And the heart, which all day long 

Ruthless thou hast trod upon. 
Shall outpour a soothing song 
For its best beloved one — 
All its tenderness for thee. 
Little Mistress Sans-Merci! 



10NCE knew all the birds that came 
And nested in our orchard trees, 
For every flower I had a name — 

My friends were woodchucks, toads, and bees; 
I knew where thrived in yonder glen 

What plants would soothe a stone-bruised 
toe — 
Oh, I was very learned then, 
But that was very long ago. 

I knew the spot upon the hill 

Where checkerberries could be found, 

I knew the rushes near the mill 

Where pickerel lay that weighed a pound! 



I knew the wood — the very tree 

Where lived the poachingj saucy crow, 

And all the woods and crows knew me — 
But that was very long ago. 

And pining for the joys of youth, 

I tread the old familiar spot 
Only to learn this solemn truth: 

I have forgotten, am forgot. 
Yet here 's this youngster at my knee 

Knows all the things I used to know« 
To think I once was wise as he! — 

But that was very long ago. 

I know it 's folly to complain 

Of whatsoe'er the fates decree, 
Yet, were not wishes all in vain, 

I tell you what my wish should be: 
I *d wish to be a boy again. 

Back with the friends I used to know. 
For I was, oh, so happy then — 

But that was very long ago! 



THE fire upon the hearth is low, 
And there is stillness everywhere, 
And, like wing'd spirits, here and there 
The firehght shadows fluttering go. 
And as the shadows round me creep, 
A childish treble breaks the gloom, 
And softly fi"om a further room 
Comes : " Now I lay me down to sleep." 

And, somehow, with that little prayer 
And that sweet treble in my ears, 
My thought goes back to distant years, 

And lingers with a dear one there; 


And as I hear my child's amen, 

My mother's faith comes back to me — 
Crouched at her side I seem to be, 

And mother holds my hands again. 

Oh, for an hour in that dear place — 

Oh, for the peace of that dear time— 
Oh, for that childish trust sublime — 

Oh, for a glimpse of mother's face! 

Yet, as the shadows round me creep, 
I do not seem to be alone — 
Sweet magic of that treble tone 

And " Now I lay me down to sleep ! '' 



Cobbler. 
Stork, I am justly wroth, 

For thou hast wronged me sore; 
The ash roof- tree that shelters thee 

Shall shelter thee no more! 

Stork. 
Full fifty years I 've dwelt 

Upon this honest tree, 
And long ago (as people know!) 

I brought thy father thee. 
What hail hath chilled thy heart, 

That thou shouldst bid me go ? 
Speak out, I pray — then I '11 away. 

Since thou commandest so. 



Cobbler. 
Thou tellest of the time 

When, wheehng from the west, 
This hut thou sought'st and one 
thou brought'st 

Unto a mother's breast. 
/ was the wretched child 

Was fetched that dismal morn— 
'T were better die than be (as I) 

To life of misery born ! 
And hadst thou borne me on 

Still farther up the town, 
A king I 'd be of high degree, 

And wear a golden crown! 
For yonder lives the prince 

Was brought that selfsame day: 
How happy he, while — look at me! 

I toil my life away ! 
And see my little boy — 

To what estate he 's born ! 
Why, when I die no hoard leave I 

But poverty and scorn. 
And thou hast done it all — 


I might have been a king 
And ruled in state, but for thy hate, 
Thou base, perfidious thing ! 



Stork. 
Since, cobbler, thou dost speak 

Of one thou lovest well, 
Hear of that king what grievous thing 

This very morn befell. 
Whilst round thy homely bench 

They well-beloved played, 
In yonder hall beneath a pall 

A little one was laid; 
Thy well-beloved's face 

Was rosy with delight, 
But 'neath that pall in yonder hall 

The little face is white; 
Whilst by a merry voice 

Thy soul is filled with cheer. 
Another weeps for one that sleeps 

All mute and cold anear; 
One father hath his hope, 



And one is childless now; 
He wears a crown and rules a town— « 

Only a cobbler thou I 
Wouldst thou exchange thy lot 

At price of such a woe ? 
I '11 nest no more above thy door, 

But, as thou bidst me, go. 

Cobbler. 
Nay, stork! thou shalt remain — 

I mean not what I said; 
Good neighbors we must always be, 

So make thy home o'erhead. 
I would not change my bench 

For any monarch's throne. 
Nor sacrifice at any price 

My darling and my own! 
Stork! on my roof-tree bide. 

That, seeing thee anear, 
I '11 thankful be God sent by thee 

Me and my darling here ! 




LAST night, whiles that the curfew bell ben 
J ringing, 

I heard a moder to her dearie singing 

"Lollyby, lolly, lollyby"; 
And presently that chylde did cease hys weeping, 
And on his moder's breast did fall a-sleeping 
To "lolly, lolly, lollyby." 

Faire ben the chylde unto his moder clinging, 
But fairer yet the moder's gentle singing — 

"Lollyby, lolly, lollyby"; 
And angels came and kisst the dearie smiling 
In dreems while him hys moder ben beguiHng 
With "lolly, lolly, lollyby." 


 

Then to my harte sales I : " Oh, that thy 

beating 
Colde be assuaged by some sweete voice re- 
peating 
'Lollyby, lolly, lollyby'; 
That like this lyttel chylde I, too, ben sleeping 
With plaisaunt phantasies about me creeping, 
To 'lolly, lolly, lollyby ' ! " 

Some time — mayhap when curfew bells are 

ringing— 
A. weary harte shall heare straunge voices 

singing 

"Lollyby, lolly, lollyby"; 
Some time, mayhap, with Chryst's love round 

me streaming, 
I shall be lulled into eternal dreeming, 
With "lolly, lolly, lollyby." 



1 WONDER ef all wimmin air 
Like 'Lizzie is when we go out 
To theaters an' concerts where 

Is things the papers talk about. 
Do other wimmin fret an' stew 

Like they wuz bein' crucified — 
Frettin' a show or concert through, 
With wonderin' ef the baby cried ? 

Now Lizzie knows that gran'ma 's there 
To see that everything is right, 

Yet Lizzie thinks that gran'ma's care 
Ain't good enuff fr baby, quite; 

Yet what am I to answer when 
She kind uv fidgets at my side, 

An' asks me every now and then: 

" I wonder if the baby cried ? " 



Seems like she seen two little eyes 

A-pinin' fr their mother's smile — 
Seems like she heern the pleadin' cries 

Uv one she thinks uv all the while; 
An' so she 's sorry that she come, 

An' though she alius tries to hide 
The truth, she 'd ruther stay to hum 

Than wonder ef the baby cried. 

Yes, wimmin folks is all alike — 

By Lizzie you kin jedge the rest; 
There never wuz a little tyke, 

But that his mother loved him best. 
And nex' to bein' what I be — 

The husband uv my gentle bride — 
I 'd wisht I wuz that croodlin' wee, 

With Lizzie wonderin' ef I cried. 



1 THOUGHT myself, indeed, secure 
So fast the door, so firm the lock; 
But, lo! he toddling comes to lure 
My parent ear with timorous knock. 

My heart were stone could it withstand 

The sweetness of my baby's plea, — 
That timorous, baby knocking and 
"Please let me in, — it 's only me." 

I threw aside the unfinished book, 
Regardless of its tempting charms, 

And, opening wide the door, I took 
My laughing darling in my arms. 



Who knows but in Eternity, 

I, like a truant child, shall wait 

The glories of a life to be, 

Beyond the Heavenly Father's gate ? 

And will that Heavenly Father heed 

The truant's supplicating cry, 
As at the outer door I plead, 
«'T is I, O Father! only I?" 




A CHILD was singing at his play — 
I heard the song, and paused to hear; 
His mother moaning, groaning lay, 
And, lo! a specter stood anear! 

The child shook sunlight from his hair, 
And caroled gaily all day long — 

Aye, with that specter gloating there, 
The innocent made mirth and song ! 

How like to harvest fruit wert thou, 
O sorrow, in that dismal room — 

God ladeth not the tender bough 

Save with the joy of bud and bloom! 




STRANGE that the city thoroughfare, 
Noisy and busthng all the day, 
Should with the night renounce its care 
And lend itself to children's play! 

Oh, girls are girls, and boys are boys, 
And have been so since Abel's birth, 

And shall be so till dolls and toys 
Are with the children swept from earth. 

The selfsame sport that crowns the day 
Of many a Syrian shepherd's son, 

Beguiles the little lads at play 
By night in stately Babylon. 

I hear their voices in the street, 

Yet 't is so different now from then! 

Come, brother! from your winding-sheet, 
And let us two be boys again ! 


THE little toy dog is covered with dust, 
But sturdy and stanch he stands; 
And the little toy soldier is red with rust, 

And his musket molds in his hands. 
Time was when the little toy dog was new, 

And the soldier was passing fair; 
And that was the time when our Little Boy Blue 
Kissed them and put them there. 

" Now, don't you go till I come," he said, 
" And don't you make any noise ! '* 
So, toddling off to his trundle-bed, 

He dreamt of the pretty toys ; 
And, as he was dreaming, an angel song 

Awakened our Little Boy Blue — 
Oh! the years are many, the years are long, 
But the little toy friends are true! 



Aye, faithful to Little Boy Blue they stand, 

Each in the same old place — 
Awaiting the touch of a little hand, 

The smile of a little face; 
And they wonder, as waiting the long years 
through 

In the dust of that little chair. 
What has become of our Little Boy Blue, 

Since he kissed them and put them there. 


 

I'm going to write a letter to our oldest boy 
who went 
Out West last spring to practise law and run 

for president; 
I '11 tell him all the gossip I guess he 'd like 

to hear, 
For he has n't seen the home-folks for going 

on a year! 
Most generally it 's Marthy does the writing, 

but as she 
Is suffering with a felon, why, the job devolves 

on me — 
So, when the supper things are done and put 

away to-night, 
I '11 draw my boots and shed my coat and 

settle down to write.  


I '11 tell him crops are looking up, with pros- 
pects big for corn, 

That, fooling with the barnyard gate, the off- 
ox hurt his horn; 

That the Templar lodge is doing well — Tim 
Bennett joined last week 

When the prohibition candidate for Congress 
came to speak; 

That the old gray woodchuck 's living still 
down in the pasture-lot, 

A- wondering what 's become of little William, 
like as not! 

Oh, yes, there 's lots of pleasant things and 
no bad news to tell. 

Except that old Bill Graves was sick, but now 
he 's up and well. 

Cy Cooper says — (but I '11 not pass my word 

that it is so. 
For Cy he is some punkins on spinning yarns, 

you know) — 
He says that, since the freshet, the pickerel 

are so thick 


In Baker's pond you can wade in and kill 
'em with a stick! 

The Hubbard girls are teaching school, and 
Widow Cutler's Bill 

Has taken Eli Baxter's place in Luther East- 
man's mill; 

Old Deacon Skinner's dog licked Deacon 
Howard's dog last week, 

And now there are two lambkins in one flock 
that will not speak. 

The yellow rooster froze his feet, a-wadin' 

through the snow, 
And now he leans agin the fence when he 

starts in to crow; 
The chestnut colt that was so skittish when 

Jie went away — 
I 've broke him to the sulky and I drive him 

every day! 
We 've got pink window curtains for the front 

spare-room up-stairs, 
And Lizzie 's made new covers for the parlor 

lounge and chairs ; 



We 've roofed the barn and braced the elm 
that has the hangbird's nest — 

Oh, there 's been lots of changes since our 
William went out West! 



Old Uncle Enos Packard is getting mighty 
gay— 

He gave Miss Susan Birchard a peach the 
other day! 

His late lamented Sarah hain't been buried 
quite a year, 

So his purring 'round Miss Susan causes criti- 
cism here. 

At the last donation party, the minister opined 

That, if he 'd half suspicioned what was com- 
ing, he 'd resigned; 

For, though they brought him slippers like he 
was a centipede, 

His pantry was depleted by the consequential 
feed! 

These are the things I '11 write him — our boy 
that 's in the West; 



And I '11 tell him how we miss him — his 

mother and the rest; 
Why, we never have an apple-pie that mother 

does n't say: 
''''He liked it so — I wish that he could have 

a piece to-day ! " 
I '11 tell him we are prospering, and hope he 

is the same — 
That we hope he '11 have no trouble getting 

on to wealth and fame; 
And just before I write " good-by from father 

and the rest," 
I '11 say that "mother sends her love," and 

that will please him best. 

For when / went away from home, the weekly 

news I heard 
Was nothing to the tenderness I found in that 

one word — &gt; 
The sacred name of mother — why, even now 

as then. 
The thought brings back the saintly face, the 

gracious love again; 



And in my bosom seems to come a peace that 

is divine, 
As if an angel spirit communed a while with 

mine; 
And one man's heart is strengthened by the 

message from above, 
A-nd earth seems nearer heaven when " mother 

sends her love." 




MY harp is on the willow-tree, 
Else would I sing, O love, to thee 
A song of long-ago — 
Perchance the song that Miriam sung 
Ere yet Judea's heart was wrung 
By centuries of woe. 

I ate my crust in tears to-day. 

As scourged I went upon my way — 

And yet my darling smiled; 
Aye, beating at my breast, he laughed — 
My anguish curdled not the draught — 

'T was sweet with love, my child! 


The shadow of the centuries lies 
Deep in thy dark and mournful eye 

But, hush ! and close them now ', 
And in the dreams that thou shalt drran? 
The light of other days shall seem 

To glorify thy brow! 

Our harp is on the willow-tree — 
I have no song to sing to thee, 

As shadows round us roll; 
But, hush and sleep, and thou shalt hear 
Jehovah's voice that speaks to cheer 

Judea's fainting soul ! 





COME, Harvey, let us sit a while and talk 
about the times 
Before you went to selling clothes and I to 

peddling rimes — 
The days when we were little boys, as naughty 

little boys 
As ever worried home-folks with their ever- 
lasting noise! 
Egad ! and, were we so disposed, I '11 venture 

we could show 
The scars of wallopings we got some forty 

years ago; 
What wallopings I mean I think I need not 

specify — 
Mother's whippings did n't hurt, but father's! 

oh, my ! 



The way that we played hookey those many 

years ago — 
We 'd rather give 'most anything than have 

our children know! 
The thousand naughty things we did, the 

thousand fibs we told — 
Why, thinking of them makes my presbyte- 

rian blood run cold! 
How often Deacon Sabine Morse remarked 

if we were his 
He 'd tan our " pesky little hides until the 

blisters riz ! " 
It 's many a hearty thrashing to that Deacon 

Morse we owe — 
Mother's whippings did n't count — father's did, 

though ! 

We used to sneak off swimmin' in those care- 
less, boyish days, 

And come back home of evenings with our 
necks and backs ablaze; 

How mother used to wonder why our clothes 
were full of sand, 




But father, having been a boy, appeared to 
understand. 

And, after tea, he 'd beckon us to join him 
in the shed 

Where he 'd proceed to tinge our backs a 
deeper, darker red; 

Say what we will of mother's, there is none 
will controvert 

The proposition that our father's lickings al- 
ways hurt! 

For mother was by nature so forgiving and 

so mild 
That she inclined to spare the rod although 

she spoiled the child; 
And when at last in self-defense she had to 

whip us, she 
Appeared to feel those whippings a great deal 

more than we ! 
But how we bellowed and took on, as if we 'd 

like to die — 
Poor mother really thought she hurt, and that 's 

what made her cry! 




Then how we youngsters snickered as out the 

door we slid, 
For mother's whippings never hurt, though 

father's always did. 

In after years poor father simmered down to 
five feet four, 

But in our youth he seemed to us in height 
eight feet or more ! 

Oh, how we shivered when he quoth in cold, 
suggestive tone: 
" I '11 see you in the woodshed after supper all 
alone ! " 

Oh, how the legs and arms and dust and trouser 
buttons flew — 

What florid vocalisms marked that vesper inter- 
view ! 

Yes, after all this lapse of years, I feelingly assert, 

With all respect to mother, it was father's whip- 
pings hurt! 

The little boy experiencing that tingling 'neath 

his vest 
Is often loath to realize that all is for the best j 




Yet, when the boy gets older, he pictures with 

deHght 
The buffetings of childhood — as we do here 

to-night. 
The years, the gracious years, have smoothed 

and beautified the ways 
That to our little feet seemed all too rugged 

in the days 
Before you went to selling clothes and I to 

peddling rimes — 
So, Harvey, let us sit a while and think upon 

those times. 



1WAS a mother, and I weep; 
The night is come — the day is sped— 
The night of woe profound, for, oh, 
My Httle golden son is dead ! 

The pretty rose that bloomed anon 
Upon my mother breast, they stole; 

They let the dove I nursed with love 
Fly far away — so sped my soul! 

That falcon Death swooped down upon 
My sweet-voiced turtle as he sung; 

'T is hushed and dark where soared the lark. 
And so, and so my heart was wrung ! 


Before my eyes, they sent the hail 
Upon my green pomegranate-tree — 

Upon the bough where only now 
A rosy apple bent to me. 

They shook my beauteous almond-tree, 
Beating its glorious bloom to death — 

They strewed it round upon the ground, 
And mocked its fragrant dying breath, 

I was a mother, and I weep; 

I seek the rose where nestleth none-=- 
No more is heard the singing bird — 

I have no little golden son! 

So fall the shadows over me. 
The blighted garden, lonely nest. 

Reach down in love, O God above ! 
And fold my darling to thy breast 




A MOONBEAM floateth from the skies. 
Whispering : " Heigho, my dearie ; 
I would spin a web before your eyes — 
A beautiful web of silver light 
Wherein is many a wondrous sight 
Of a radiant garden leagues away, 
Where the softly tinkling Hlies sway 
And the snow-white lambkins are at play* 
Heigho, my dearie!" 

A brownie stealeth from the vine. 

Singing : " Heigho, my dearie ; 
And will you hear this song of mine — 
A song of the land of murk and mist 
Where bideth the bud the dew hath kist? 




Then let the moonbeam's web of light 
Be spun before thee silvery white, 
And I shall sing the livelong night — 
Heigho, my dearie ! " 

The night wind speedeth from the sea, 
Murmuring : " Heigho, my dearie ; 

I bring a mariner's prayer for thee; 

So let the moonbeam veil thine eyes. 

And the brownie sing thee lullabies-— 

But I shall rock thee to and fro, 

Kissing the brow he loveth so. 

And the prayer shall guard thy bed, I trow^ 
Heigho, my dearie!" 




Aha! a traitor in the camp, 
, A rebel strangely bold, — 
A lisping, laughing, toddling scamp. 
Not more than four years old! 

To think that I, who 've ruled alone 

So proudly in the past, 
Should be ejected from my throne 

By my own son at last! 

He trots his treason to and fro, 

As only babies can. 
And says he '11 be his mamma's beau 

When he 's a " gweat, big man " ! 

You stingy boy! you 've always had 

A share in mamma's heart. 
Would you begrudge your poor old dad 

The tiniest little part? 



That mamma, I regret to see, 
Inclines to take your part, — 

As if a dual monarchy 

Should rule her gentle heart! 

But when the years of youth have sped. 

The bearded man, I trow, 
Will quite forget he ever said 

He 'd be his mamma's beau. 

Renounce your treason, Httle son,- 
Leave mamma's heart to me; 

For there will come another one 
To claim your loyalty. 

And when that other comes to you, 
God grant her love may shine 

Through all your life, as fair and true 
As mamma's does through mine ! 




WHEN brother Bill and I were boys, 
How often in the summer we 
Would seek the shade your branches made, 

O fair and gracious bell-flower tree! 
Amid the clover bloom we sat 

And looked upon the Holyoke range, 
While Fido lay a space away, 
Thinking our silence very strange. 

The woodchuck in the pasture-lot, 

Beside his furtive hole elate, 
Heard, off beyond the pickerel pond, 

The redwing-blackbird chide her mate. 
The bumblebee went bustling round, 

Pursuing labors never done — 
With drone and sting, the greedy thing 

Begrudged the sweets we lay upon! 



Our eyes looked always at the hills — 

The Holyoke hills that seemed to stand 
Between us boys and pictured joys 

Of conquest in a further land! 
Ah, how we coveted the time 

When we should leave this prosy place 
And work our wills beyond those hills, 

And meet creation face to face! 

You must have heard our childish talk — 

Perhaps our prattle gave you pain; 
For then, old friend, you seemed to bend 

Your kindly arms about us twain. 
It might have been the wind that sighed, 

And yet I thought I heard you say: 
"Seek not the ills beyond those hills — 

Oh, stay with me, my children, stay!" 

See, I Ve come back; the boy you knew 
Is wiser, older, sadder grown; 

I come once more, just as of yore — 
I come, but see ! I come alone I 



The memory of a brother's love, 
Of blighted hopes, I bring with me, 

And here I lay my heart to-day — 
A weary heart, O bell-flower tree! 

So let me nestle in your shade 

As though I were a boy again, 
And pray extend your arms, old friend. 

And love me as you used to then. 
Sing softly as you used to sing. 

And maybe I shall seem to be 
A little boy and feel the joy 

Of thy repose, O bell-flower tree! 



OH, listen, little Dear-My-Soul, 
To the fairy voices calling, 
Foi the moon is high in the misty sky 

And the honey dew is falling; 
lb the midnight feast in the clover bloom 

The bluebells are a-ringing. 
And it 's " Come away to the land of fay " 
That the katydid is singing. 

Oh, slumber, little Dear-My-Soul, 

And hand in hand we '11 wander — 
Hand in hand to the beautiful land 

Of Balow, away off yonder; 
Or we '11 sail along in a lily leaf 

Into the white moon's halo — 
Over a stream of mist and dream 

Into the land of Balow. 


Or, you shall have two beautiful wings — 

Two gossamer wings and airy, 
And all the while shall the old moon smile 

And think you a little fairy; 
And you shall dance in the velvet sky, 

And the silvery stars shall twinkle 
And dream sweet dreams as over their beams 

Your footfalls softly tinkle. 




[LOVED him so; his voice had grown 
Into my heart, and now to hear 
The pretty song he had sung so long 

Die on the Hps to me so dear! 
He a child with golden curls, 

And I with head as white as snow — 
\ knelt down there and made this pray'r: 
"God, let me be the first to go!" 

How often I recall it now: 

My darling tossing on his bed, 
I sitting there in mute despair. 

Smoothing the curls that crowned his head. 
They did not speak to me of death — 

A feeling here had told me so; 
What could I say or do but pray 

That I might be the first to go? 



Yet, thinking of him standing there 

Out yonder as the years go by, 
Waiting for me to come, I see 

'T was better he shoulu wait, not I. 
For when I walk the vale of death, 

Above the wail of Jordan's flow 
Shall rise a song that shall make me strong— 

The call of the child that was first to go. 




FAIR is the castle up on the hill — 
Hushaby, sweet my own ! 
The night is fair, and the waves are still. 
And the wind is singing to you and to me 
In this lowly home beside the sea — 
Hushaby, sweet my own ! 

On yonder hill is store of wealth — 

Hushaby, sweet my own ! 
And revelers drink to a little one's health; 
But you and I bide night and day 
For the other love that has sailed away — 

Hushaby, sweet my own! 

See not, dear eyes, the forms that creep 

Ghostlike, O my own! 
Out of the mists of the murmuring deep; 
Oh, see them not and make no cry 
Till the angels of death have passed us by- 

Hushaby, sweet my own! 



Ah, little they reck of you and me — 

Hushaby, sweet my own! 
In our lonely home beside the sea; 
They seek the castle up on the hill, 
And there they will do their ghostly will — 

Hushaby, O my own! 

Here by the sea a mother croons 
" Hushaby, sweet my own ! " 
In yonder castle a mother swoons 
While the angels go down to the misty deep 
Bearing a little one fast asleep — 
Hushaby., sweet my own! 




OMOTHER-MY-LOVE, if you '11 give me your 
hand, 
And go where I ask you to wander, 
I will lead you away to a beautiful land — 

The Dreamland that 's waiting out yonder. 

We '11 walk in a sweet-posie garden out there 

Where moonlight and starlight are streaming 

And the flowers and the birds are filling the air 

With the fragrance and music of dreaming. 

There '11 be no little tired-out boy to undress, 

No questions or cares to perplex you; 
There '11 be no Httle bruises or bumps to caress, 

Nor patching of stockings to vex you. 
For I '11 rock you away on a silver-dew stream, 

And sing you asleep when you 're weary. 
And no one shall know of our beautiful dream 

But you and your own little dearie, 


And when I am tired I '11 nestle my head 

In the bosom that 's soothed me so often, 
And the wide-awake stars shall sing in my 
stead 
A song which our dreaming shall soften. 
So, Mother-My-Love, let me take your dear 
hand, 
And away through the starlight we '11 wan- 
der — 
Away through the mist to the beautiful land — 
The Dreamland that 's waiting out yonder! 



OME hither, lyttel childe, and lie upon my 

breast to-night, 
For yonder fares an angell yclad In raimaunt 

white. 
And yonder sings ye angell as onely angells 

may. 
And his songe ben of a garden that bloometh 

farre awaye. 

To them that have no lyttel childe Godde 

sometimes sendeth down 
A lyttel childe that ben a lyttel angell of his 

owne; 
And if so bee they love that childe, he will- 

eth it to staye, 
But elsewise, in his mercie, he taketh it awaye. 




And sometimes, though they love it, Godde 

yearneth for ye childe, 
And sendeth angells singing, whereby it ben 

beguiled; 
They fold their arms about ye lamb that 

croodleth at his play, 
And beare him to ye garden that bloometh 

farre awaye. 

I wolde not lose ye lyttel lamb that Godde 
hath lent to me ; 

If I colde sing that angell songe, how joy- 
some I sholde be ! 

For, with mine arms about him, and my mu- 
sick in his eare. 

What angell songe of paradize soever sholde I 
feare ? 



Soe come, my lyttel childe, and lie upon my 

breast to-night, 
For yonder fares an angell yclad in raimaunt 

white, 




And yonder sings that angell, as onely angells 

may, 
And his songe ben of a garden that bloom- 

eth farre awaye. 




IF thou wilt shut thy drowsy eyes, 
My mulberry one, my golden sun ! 
The rose shall sing thee lullabies. 

My pretty cosset lambkin ! 
And thou shalt swing in an almond-tree, 
With a flood of moonbeams rocking thee- 
A silver boat in a golden sea, 

My velvet love, my nestling dove, 
My own pomegranate blossom! 

The stork shall guard thee passing well 
All night, my sweet! my dimple-feet! 

And bring thee myrrh and asphodel. 
My gentle rain-of-springtime ! 


And for thy slumbrous play shall twine 
The diamond stars with an emerald vine 
To trail in the waves of ruby wine, 
My myrtle bloom, my heart's perfume, 
My little chirping sparrow! 

And when the mom wakes up to see 

My apple bright, my soul's delight! 

The partridge shall come calling thee. 

My jar of milk-and-honey ! 
Yes, thou shalt know what mystery Hes 
In the amethyst deep of the curtained skies, 
If thou wilt fold thy onyx eyes. 
You wakeful one, you naughty son. 
You cooing little turtle! 




1 COUNT my treasures o'er with care,— 
The Httle toy my darHng knew, 
A httle sock of faded hue, 
A Httle lock of golden hair. 

Long years ago this holy time. 
My little one — my all to me — 
Sat robed in white upon my knee, 

And heard the merry Christmas chime. 

'• Tell me, my little golden-head, 

If Santa Claus should come to-night, 
What shall he bring my baby bright,- 
What treasure for my boy?" I said. 



And then he named this little toy, 
While in his round and mournful eyes 
There came a look of sweet surprise, 

That spake his quiet, trustful joy. 

And as he lisped his evening prayer 
He asked the boon with childish grace; 
Then, toddling to the chimney-place. 

He hung this little stocking there. 

That night, while lengthening shadows crept 
I saw the white-winged angels come 
With singing to our lowly home 

And kiss my darling as he slept. 

They must have heard his little prayer, 
For in the morn, with rapturous face. 
He toddled to the chimney-place. 

And found this little treasure there. 

They came again one Christmas-tide,— 
That angel host, so fair and white; 
And, singing all that glorious night, 

They lured my darling from my side. 



A little sock, a little toy, 
A little lock of golden hair, 
The Christmas music on the air, 

A watching for my baby boy ! 

But if again that angel train 

And golden-h^ad come oack for me, 

To bear me tc Eternity 
vlj/ svaTcmn^ vvii not le n, rain. 



HUSH, little one, and fold your hands— 
The sun hath set, the moon is high; 
The sea is singing to the sands, 

And wakeful posies are beguiled 
By many a fairy lullaby — 

Hush, little child — my Httle child! 

Dream, little one, and in your dreams 

Float upward from this lowly place — 
Float out on mellow, misty streams 
To lands where bideth Mary mild. 
And let her kiss thy little face, 
You little child — my little child! 




Sleep, little one, and take thy rest — 

With angels bending over thee, 
Sleep sweetly on that Father's breast 

Whom our dear Christ hath reconciled — 
But stay not there — come back to me, 
Oh, little child — 7ny little child! 



1WAS just a little thing 
When a fairy came and kissed me; 
Floating in upon the light 
Of a haunted summer night, 
Lo, the fairies came to sing 
Pretty slumber songs and bring 

Certain boons that else had missed me. 
From a dream I turned to see 
What those strangers brought for me, 
When that fairy up and kissed me — 
Here, upon this cheek, he kissed me! 

Simmerdew was there, but she 
Did not like me altogether; 
Daisybright and Turtledove, 
Pilfercurds and Honey love, 
Thistleblow and Amberglee 
On that gleaming, ghostly sea 



Floated from the misty heather, 
And around my trundle-bed 
Frisked, and looked, and whispering said — - 

Solemnlike and all together: 
"y(?u shall kiss him, Ganderfeather ! " 

Ganderfeather kissed me then — 

Ganderfeather, quaint and merry! 
No attenuate sprite was he, 
— But as buxom as could be; — 
Kissed me twice, and once again^ 
And the others shouted when 

On my cheek uprose a berry 
Somewhat Hke a mole, mayhap, 
But the kiss-mark of that chap 

Ganderfeather, passing merry — 

Humorsome, but kindly, very ! 

I was just a tiny thing 

When the prankish Ganderfeather 
Brought this curious gift to me 
With his fairy kisses three; 
Yet with honest pride I sing 



That same gift he chose to bring 
Out of yonder haunted heather. 
Other charms and friendships fly — 
Constant friends this mole and I, 
Who have been so long together. 
Thank you, Httle Ganderfeather ! 


BAMBINO in his cradle slept; 
And by his side his grandam grim 
Bent down and smiled upon the child, 
And sung this lullaby to him, — 
This " ninna and anninia " : 

" When thou art older, thou shalt mind 
To traverse countries far and wide, 
And thou shalt go where roses blow 
And balmy waters singing glide — 
So ninna and anninia! 

"And thou shalt wear, trimmed up in points, 
A famous jacket edged in red, 
And, more than that, a peaked hat. 
All decked in gold, upon thy head — 
Ah! ninna and anninia! 
123 



" Then shalt thou carry gun and knife, 
Nor shall the soldiers bully thee; 
Perchance, beset by wrong or debt, 
A mighty bandit thou shalt be^ 
So ninna and anninial 

"No woman yet of our proud race 

Lived to her fourteenth year unwed ^ 
The brazen churl that eyed a girl 

Bought her the ring or paid his head ^ 
So ninna and anninia! 

"But once came spies (I know the thieves!) 
And brought disaster to our race; 
God heard us when our fifteen men 

Were hanged within the market-place— 
But ninna and anninia! 

" Good men they were, my babe, and true,— 
Right worthy fellows all, and strong; 
Live thou and be for them and me 
Avenger of that deadly wrong — 
So ninna and anninia ! " 



AFTER dear old grandma died, 
Hunting through an oaken chest 
In the attic, we espied 

What repaid our childish quest; 
'T was a homely little slate, 
Seemingly of ancient date. 

On its quaint and battered face 

Was the picture of a cart, 
Drawn with all that awkward grace 

Which betokens childish art; 
But what meant this legend, pray: 
"Homer drew this yesterday"? 
125 


Mother recollected then 

What the years were fain to hide- 
She was but a baby when 

Little Homer lived and died; 
Forty years, so mother said, 
Little Homer had been dead. 

This one secret through those years 
Grandma kept from all apart, 

Hallowed by her lonely tears 
And the breaking of her heart ; 

While each year that sped away 

Seemed to her but yesterday. 

So the homely little slate 

Grandma's baby's fingers pressed. 

To a memory consecrate, 
Lieth in the oaken chest. 

Where, unwilling we should know, 

Grandma put it, years ago. 


 

A WORD TO THE CHILDREN 

Dear Children: Our little winged neighbors of 
the fields and hedges can help to give us a happy 
summer. If we watch the insects we will learn a 
great deal that is worth knowing. 

We can watch them everywhere, for even in the 
cities certain of them are always to be seen. In the 
parks and often in the crowded streets we may see 
butterflies and bees, bilt the best place to make their 
acquaintance is in the garden or out in the fields. 

The way to know them is to look, look, look. 

We can read about them, but that is not enough; 
we must also watch them with our own eyes. 

Think how pleasant it will be to take a summer 
walk and see little friends and acquaintances on every 
side. 

And think how busy we can keep, watching the 
affairs of our funny little insect neighbors. 

I hope you will all succeed in persuading some 
friejidly farmer to give you a piece of beebread out 




of his hives this summer, and that you will also get 
a good number of cocoons and chrysalids to look at 
through the winter. 

A happy summer to you.

BUTTERFLIES 

Gkeat ships are sailing on the broad blue 
sea ; their sails are white or gray and they 
can cross the ocean. 

See these little ships a-sailing in the 
air; their sails are all bright colors. 

They are the butterflies, and their 
wings are their sails. 

Sometimes they are blown out to sea and wrecked, 
for if they fall into the water they cannot get out 
again. 

MONARCHS 

Look ! the air is full of Monarchs. 

That is the name of this large butterfly that has dark 
yellow-red wings with black veins. 

Does it not look like a monarch among the insect 
folk? 

Can you count all the Monarchs you can see ? 

John says he can get as far as twenty, but they 
move about so rapidly that he cannot then tell which 
he has counted and which he has not. 




They seem to be sailing about for the pleasure of it, 
but many of them are at rest on the golden-rods. 

See ! the golden-rods seem to have blossomed out 
into butterflies. 

Monarchs, what are you doing on the golden-rods? 

They are walking daintily about on long, black legs 
_ that look like threads. 




May says they have only, four legs, which puzzles 
her, as she knows that insects have six legs. Look 
more carefully. Ah! now you see how it is. 

They have four long legs and two short ones, for the 
front legs are very small and the Monarchs hold them 
up close to their bodies, so we have to look sharp to 
see them. 

Why are the front legs of the Monarchs so small 
and useless? 







Doubtless the front legs were once strong and large 
enough to walk with, but for some reason this family 
of butterflies ceased to use these two legs, and they 
gradually grew smaller and weaker. 

You will remember that if an organ is not used, it 
dwindles away in course of time. 

There is a large family of butterflies with small 
front legs; they are called the Four- 
footed butterflies. 

May says the Monarchs are doing 
something besides walking about on 
the golden-rods* They uncui'l a longy 
black, threadlike tongue, and this 
they thrust into the little golden- 
rod flowers and suck out the 
nectar that is there. 

Look at the 
tongue ; it seems 
to have a joint 
in the middle, ¡ª 
at least it is ^^ 
bent in the (y^ 
middle. ^^' 







Now watch this one near us put the tip of that long 
tongue into first one tiny golden-rod flower and then 
another. 

The Monarchs seem to enjoy golden-rod nectar. 

Golden-Rod Flowers 

Do you know of the golden-rod flowers ? 
Each spray of golden-rod is made up of many separate 
flowers. The flowers are gathered into little clusters. 
Here is one branch from a large spray. 
.How many flowers are there on it ? 
Yes ; I thought you would all say four. 
Well, there are more than twenty. 
Each of those that you think is a single flower 
is really a cluster of tiny flowers. 
We will take off one little cluster. 
Now we will take it apart and look at one of the 
tiny flowers. 

We shall have to use a magnifying glass to 
see it Well. 

See what a perfect little flower it is under the glass. 
Yes, May, it looks somewhat like a little lily. 
Who would guess that the golden-rods were made up 
of so many, many tiny flowers ! 

There is a drop of nectar for the butterflies in each 
little flower tube. 






And now you see why the butterflies need such 
slender tongues. 

They could not reach the nectar hidden away in the 
bottoms of the tiny flower cups unless they had tongues 
as slender as threads. 

See them go from flower to flower ; they know just 
what to do with those tongues of theirs. 

Other insect folk are searching for the nectar, but 
there are more butterflies than anything else. 

The bumblebees are burying their flat faces deep in 
the golden-rod flowers, for they, too, have long, slender 
tongues. 

The Tongue, Eyes, and Antenna 

No, May, the tongues of the bees are not so long and 
slender as are those of the butterflies, and therefore the 
bees cannot reach the nectar so well as can o\ir dainty 
butterflies. 

The tongue of the 
butterfly is really a 
long tube. The mouth 
parts are modified to 
make it. It is not like the sharp tube of the bugs. 
The butterfly cannot pierce with its tongue. 

Do you know what becomes of the long tongue when 
the butterfly is not using it ? 








Yes, May, it is coiled up like a watch spring. 
What a pretty way to take care of it ! 
See the little coiled tongue under the butterfly's head. 
And see its black eyes. How round they are ! 

Yes, you are right, Charlie ; they 
^;Ji0^ are compound eyes, but I do not 

know how many 
facets they have. 
Facets, you remem- 
ber, are the small 
eyes into which 
these large ones are 
divided. 
Nearly all adult insects have com- 
pound eyes, you know. 

Eutterflies see well. We have to be 
careful when we go near one or it will 

/fly away before we have a chance 
to get a good look at it. 
Yes^ Mayj our butterfly has a little 
round head and two pretty, delicate 
' 1/ ./autennaN with a knob at the end of 
each. 
Watch it examine the little flowers 
of the golden-rod with its anten- 
'^ UEJD, or feelers as we also call them. 





before it uncurls its tongue. It touches first one flower, 
then another. 

Yes, little Nell, it is smelUng to see where the nectar 
is. I see you remember that insects smell with their 
feelers. 

As soon as our butterfly finds a flower that is full of 
nectar, out comes that long, black tongue, and the tip 
of it soon finds its way into the little flower cup. 

Wings 

Be careful, Ned, my boy ! You will break the butter- 
fly's wings if you handle it so carelessly. 

What could it do with broken wings ? 

It could not go a-sailing in the air, ¡ª that is, if its 
wings were too badly injured. 

There goes one with wings all rags and tatters ! 

What do you suppose has happened to it ? 

Sometimes birds bite the wings of the butterflies. 

They think they can catch them by their wings ; but 
it is not easy for a bird to catch one of the large 
butterflies in this way. 

Often all that the bird gets for his trouble is a mouth- 
ful of dry butterfly wing, and the butterfly is not much 
the worse for the encounter, ¡ª that is, unless the bird 
takes too big a bite, or bites one wing a great deal 





Motiardy 



more than the other, so that the butterfly cannot 
balance itself. 

A butterfly can lose a good deal of sail and still keep 
afloat, so long as both sails are clipped alike. But if 
one is cut and the other not, that is a sad 
matter ; butterfly tries to float off in the 
air and tumbles to the ground instead. 

Birds do not often bite 

the wings of the Monarchs; 

they have a very disagree- 

al>le taste and the birds know it 

and do not often try to eat one. 






Viceroys 

Now what do you think ? 

Here is a butterfly that is not 

' a Monarch. It is called the Viceroy. 

The birds like the taste of this 

butterfly, but it looks so much 

like a Monarch that they do not often 

catch it. They think it is an ill-tasting 

Monarch and let it severely alone. 

It is smaller than the Monarch, and has a 
black band running across the middle of its hind wings. 
See if you can find a Viceroy. 
It belongs to the Four-footed butterflies. 






Mimicry 



A good many insects mimic other insects. 

They do it for protection. 

You will always find that the insects mimicked are 
those able to care for themselves. 

The helpless ones mimic the others. 

Bad-smelling or bad-tasting insects are very apt to be 
mimicked by those that are not disagreeable. 

Protective mimicry is adopted by a great many insects. 

The fierce stinging insects are apt to be mimicked by 
those that have no sting. Some flies and beetles look 
so much like bumblebees or wasps that you would not 
dare touch them. 

Yes, May, some insects mimic leaves and twigs in 
order to escape notice. 

One butterfly, which is not found in our country, 
mimics the leaves of certain shrubs so exactly that you 
would have to look sharp indeed to detect it. Those I 
have seen in museums are brownish in color and look 
exactly like a dead leaf on a twig. 

On the next page is a picture of a twig with a butter- 
fly on it, and at first glance you do not know which is the 
butterfly. It has its wings folded together over its back. 

Yes, John, we see only the under side of its wings. 
The upper side is not dull and brown ; it is bright in 



^ -^y^ on 




color, ¡ª blue, orange, and black, I 
think. But when this butterfly comes 
to rest it folds up its wings dull side 
out, and you see that there are 
lines like the veining of leaves 
them. You can imagine that 



butterfly sitting on a twig with its leaf- 
like wings folded over its body and say- 
ing, "Now, bird, find me if you can." 
Other insects, as you know, are the 
color of the earth or of the leaves, so that you 
can scarcely see them unless they move. 
When insects are colored like their surroundings we 
say that their coloring is protective. 

Can you think of any other insects that have pro- 
tective coloring? 

Yes, John, the little brown moths tha;t hide close to 
the roots of the grass. 

Yes, the Walking Sticks have protective coloring. 
Nell says tree toads have protective coloring, for they 
can change their color to suit their surroundings. 
That makes the rest of the children laugh. 
Do you know why they laugh, little Nell ? 
Yes, she says she knows. Tree toads are not insects, 
but the protective coloring of insects made her think of 
tree toads. 



That is right, Nell; tree toads have protective col- 
oring like the insects. A great many animals have 
protective coloring. 

John asks whether insects change their color to suit 
their surroimdings, as some other animals do. 

Now, John, I cannot answer you. I do not know 
whether they do or not. 

As a rule they do not, but I should not like to say it 
never happens. 

This I do know, that grasshoppers are differently 
colored in different places. 

For instance, those near the seashore are often 
nearly white, just the color of the sand they hop on, 
and in places where the soil or rock is black, or very 
dark brown, the grasshoppers are of the same color. 

Young insects are often different in color from 
the adults, and this is usually the case where the 
surroimdings are different. 

'No, MoUie, not all insects have protective coloring. 

Some are very bright and very different in color 
from their surroundings. 

Such are our Monarchs. 

Perhaps they wish to be seen. 

I think the very bright butterflies that come out in 
the sunshine are usually offensive to the birds. This 
being the case, it is an advantage to the butterflies to 







have the birds recognize them quickly, before taking a 
taste, you see. 

Butterflies have another way of escaping birds. 
Some kinds fly very swiftly indeed, suddenly and 
frequently changing their course. They go zigzagging 
along at such a rapid rate that no bird can follow. 

The Monarchs do not need to fly so fast; their 

disagreeable flavor protects them. Often their great 

wings move slowly as they sail in the air, though when 

they wish they can dart about at a very rapid rate. 

Yes, little Nell, the butterfly's wings, as well as its 

,;^ legs, are attached to its thorax, 

and its abdomen is divided into 

segments, like the abdomens of 

all the insects. 

It has four large wings, two on 
each side, which it holds up over its 
back when it is at rest. 

It cannot fold them away. 
Nell has caught one of the 
Monarchs, which she is hold- 
ing carefully by the wings. 




Scales 

See how dusty her little fingers are. 

The dust comes from the wings of the butterfly. 

See, it rubs oflE and then the wing is not so pretty. 

No, I do not think it hurts the butterfly to hold it 
carefully by the wings. It rubs the pretty color oflE, 
though. 

Yes, May, some of the butterflies have wings that look 
old and worn, and no doubt they are old and worn. 

It does not take long for them to look so if the 
butterfly gets caught under a bush, or in any place 
where it beats its wings against something in trying 
to escape and thus scrapes ofE the bright dust. 

Mollie thinks the butterfly's wing is powdered with 
this bright dust on purpose to look beautiful, and that 
undoubtedly is true. 

Would you like to see some butterfly-wing dust 
under the microscope? 

You shall see it when we go home. 

"What is that, Mollie, ¡ª Let us go home now and see it ? 

Well, so we will. It is not far, and we can come 
back to the butterflies again. 

This wing dust that you are to see is not from a 
Monarch ; it is from other butterflies, and from a moth 
or two. 






Now, Mollie, all is ready, and you may be the first 
to look. 

"Oh! oh!" 

I thought you would be surprised. 

Mollie says the butterfly-wing dust 
is like fairy-fish scales from fairy fish 
' that live in rainbows. 
Indeed, these tiny scales are wonder- 
fully beautiful, ¡ª they are so delicate, 
and so lovely in coloring. 
Yes, John^ small as they are, they are 
linished off with exquisite perfection. 
'^ No matter how much we 
^ were to magnify them, they 
' would never seem coarse or rough. 
ou wonder why anything so small 
and unimportant as the dust on the 
butterfly's wing should have 
been so carefully made? 

Well, my boy, that is 

Nature's way. Everjrthing 

is done perfectly, and the small 

things are as carefully finished as 

the large ones. 

May says she thinks we could learn a 
lesson from that. 







scales, 
flies, you 



Indeed, May, I am sure we could. 
Ned has not yet seen these beautiful scales through 

the microscope. 

Yes, Ned, they do look like 
dainty stick-tight seeds 
made of thin glass. 

These little objects are 
really tmy scales; not fish 
scales, of course, but insect 
These are from, several species of butter- 
know, and so they are of different shapes. 
Yes, May, each species has scales different from 
the scales of other species. Yes, indeed, I think it is 
wonderful. 

Now look through the microscope again. 
Here is a piece of wing with a few scales attached. 
See how they overlap. 
They protect the wing and 
strengthen it as well as beautify it. 
Look, too, at the wing where the 
scales have been rubbed off. It is 
no longer bright in color. It looks 
like a piece of oiled paper. 

Yes, May, the little dots on it are 
where the scales that have been brushed off were 
fastened. 







What a beautiful and wonderful thing is the butter- 
fly's wing ! 

We name the butterfly order from these scales on 
the wings, just as we named the caddice-fly order from 
the hairs on the wings. 

Yes, May, the insects in an order are no doubt closely 
related to each other, more closely than insects of 
different orders. 

You see they are alike in other 

j^ ways than in their wings, al- 

y though we have chosen to name the 

orders from some peculiarity of the wings. 

K^ John is anxious to know the name 

^^,^ of the butterfly order. 

It is the Lep-i-dop-te-ra. 
The word comej^ from the Greek ^<^on, a wing, and 
lepis^ a scale. Scale Wing, ¡ª that is the name of the 
order of our butterfly. 

May wants to know why we do not say " lepis-pteron," 
instead of " lepidoptera." 

For one reason, it is easier to say " lepidoptera." 
Other reasons you will understand when you have 
grown a little older and have studied a little more about 
how words are formed. 

I hope you will like to study how words are made 
some day, for words are very interesting. 





Scales and Hairs 

Now I think you would like to know 
something more' about scales 
and hairs. 

Both of them grow out 
from the skin, as you know. 

If you look at the wing of 
the moth close up to the body, you 
will see hairs mingled with the scales, 
and you will find scales almost as thin 
as hairs; for scales are only flattened hairs, 
modified hairs, you know. 

What, Ned, ¡ª fish scales are not flattened hairs? 
Oh, but they are. 

Scales and hairs and feathers are all really the same. 

Scales and feathers are modified hairs ; they all grow 
out from the skin in the same way. 

¡ö Yes, May, the hairs are modified to suit the needs of 
those that wear them. 

The hairs of the fox grow very thick to make him a 
warm fur coat, that he may not suffer in the freezing 
winter. 

The hairs on the bird are large and flattened out into 
feathers to make a smooth covering, as well as a warm 
one, when the bird flies through the air. Feathers are 


lighter than fur and they lie down flat and keep in 
place better when the wind blows. Feathers help make 
useful wings for the birds. 

The birds could not fly unless their hairs were modi- 
fied into feathers. 

Imagine a bird clad in fur like a fox! 

The fish does not need fur or feathers. It needs 
hairs that are short, flat, and homy, so that it can slip 
easily through the water. Therefore its hairs are modi- 
fied into smooth, flat scales. Some insects have spines 
that are modified hairs, and the Lepidoptera have, as 
you know, modified hairs that are scales to protect their 
wings and make them beautiful. 

So now you know how useful hairs are to all the 
animals. 

Fritillaries 

Let us take a walk in the woods. 

How dark and mysterious it is under the big trees ! 

We see no butterflies here, for they like the sunshine. 

Now we come out into a sunny glade. And here are 
butterflies in bright array. 

Pretty ones, we are very glad to meet you on our 
walk. 

See those two butterflies over there. They are called 
Fritillaries, 



How they go flitting up and down in the sunshine ! 

Now they are gone. No, there they come back again. 

The same butterfly will flit up and down a sunny 
opening in the woods all day long. 

They love the sunshine. 

They love the air beating in per- 
fumed waves against their wings. 

And surely they love the swift^ 
strong movement of their flight. 

It is beautiful, butterflies, to 
flit thus swiftly up and down the 
sunny spaces in the woods. 

These yellowish-brown butter- 
flies, with their wings bordered 
and marked with black, their 
hinder ones often embroidered 
with silver spots, are very often seen. 

They are the Fritillaries, and we have more than fifty 
species of them, and ¡ª yes, they too have tiny, helpless 
fore feet. They belong to the Four-footed butterflies. 




Red Admiral 

So does our charming Red Admiral. 
Do you know the Red Admiral ? 
Come, then, and make its acquaintance. 







I see one on that thistle head. 

Butterflies love the thistles. 
Where there are thistles you will be sure to 
¡ö' see butterflies. 

The thistle head, like the 
golden-rod, as you 
know, is made up of 
a great many small, 
tubular flowers. 
In each little flower tube is 
a drop of nectar. 

The Red Admiral is a 
beauty. How rich the colors 
of its purple-black wings, with 
orange-colored bands and 
white spots! 

Indeed, May, the Four-footed 
butterflies are a large family, 
and many of them are very beautiful. 




The Mourning Cloak 

One of the commonest of this family is the Mourning 
Cloak. 

You all know it. 

It flies about all summer long, and it is everywhere. 



The wings are dark brown, with a broad yellow 
border along the margins. The yellow border is 
embroidered with brown, and there is a row of blue 
spots above it, on the upper side of the wings. 

See! here comes a Mourning Cloak, flitting down the 
sutmy glade as though on purpose to let us see it. 

It is on its way to the thistle. It, too, is fond of 
thistle nectar. 

The tube of the little thistle flower is longer than 
that of the golden-rod; consequently not so many in- 
sects can eiijoy thistle nectar. Their tongues are not 
long enough to reach it. 

But the tongues of the butterflies can easily reach it. 

If you watch the butterflies, you will find that they 
visit a great many flowers which store their nectar 
at the bottom of long, slender tubes. 

The table of the butterflies is spread 
all summer long with bright and fragrant 
blossoms, ¡ªdelicate dishes that hold 
delicious nectar for them. 

And the butterflies do what in 
return for this royal feast that is 
always ready ? May says they carry pel 
len from one flower to another. Pollen, 
you will remember, is necessary to tho 
forming of the seeds. 





Pollen 





What, Ned, ¡ª you have forgotten what pollen is ? 
Do you not remember the dust in the little flower 
boxes which we call anthers? 

You shall see the jpicture of a lily; 
for the anthers show plainly there. 

There are six anthers, crescent 
shaped, and balanced on long, slen- 
der stems. The crescent-shaped an- 
ther is full of pollen dust, ¡ª tiny grains that fall 
out when the flower is ripe. 

At the center of the lily you can see the seed 
pod. There is a long, tubular stem growing from 
the top of it, and this stem ends in a knob. 

If the pollen touches the knob it remains there. 
Yes, the knob when ripe is sticky and holds the 
pollen grain. Soon the substance of the pollen grain 
finds its way down the long, slender tube to the seeds in 
the pod. This pollen substance unites with the seeds 
and then the seeds develop into plants. 
The seeds cannot grow without pollen. 
If it were not for the insects, most of the pollen 
would fall out of the anthers and be wasted. 

Bees and other nectar-eating insects visit the flowers 
and thus scatter the pollen. 





The butterfly also comes for nectar. It touches the 
ripe anther with its fuzzy back, or with its legs or its 
tongue. The pollen clings to the butterfly and then 
the butterfly, all dusty with pollen, goes to another 
flower and, brushing against the sticky knob^ 
leaves some pollen grains on it. 

Now you know what cargo is 
borne by these brave little ships 
of the air. 

They do not cgLrry bales of 
merchandise, like the great 
ships of the sea, but the 
freight they bear is as precious as 
the cargoes of the ships. 

Were it not for the insect folk who 
bear pollen from plant to plant, there 
would be no seeds formed on some species 
of plants, and if there were no seeds 
there would soon be no plants. 

Were it not for the insect folk, there would be fewer 
flowers to cheer us ; and without our friends the insects 
we should have less food to eat, for they carry the 
pollen that helps to form the seeds for our fruits and 
vegetables. 

When the flower receives the pollen we say that it is 
fertilized. Many kinds of insects fertilize the flowers. 





The butterflies help to fertilize the golden-rods. When 
they put long tongues into tiny nectar cups, they rub 
off pollen grains to carry to the next golden-rod ; for 
each little golden-rod flower has its tiny pollen cases, 
and each has its seed pod. 

Is it not a pleasant thought that we owe our lovely 
flowers to our beautiful insect friends ? and that we owe 
our insect friends to our flowers ? For if it were not for 
the flowers, our fairy-winged insects that make the 
world so cheery would not be with us, for the flowers 
supply the nourishment on which they live. 

Where the Butterflies come From 

Where do the butterflies come from ? little Nell wants 
to know. 

Where do you think they come from, little Nell ? 

Yes, they are hatched out of eggs. Butterflies often 
lay their eggs on the leaves or twigs of plants, and 
one day last summer I saw a Monarch butterfly hover- 
ing over some milkweeds. It darted down every little 
while and rested on a leaf for just a second, then off 
again, only to return to another leaf. Every time it 
thus rested on the milkweed leaf it left there a tiny 
green egg. Of course I picked some of those milkweeds 
and took them home and put them in water. What do 
you suppose happened in a few days ? 






Yes, the eggs hatched. 

Do you think they hatched into butterflies ? 

No, you all know better than that. Out of butterfly 
eggs are hatched little larvaB, and the larvaB of butter- 
flies are caterpillars. 

Yes, John, the caterpillar is a larva. 

Caterpillars never lay eggs, for only adult insects do 
that. 

No, indeed. May, caterpillars are not " worins " ! 

Some people call everything that creeps a worm, just 



as they call all 
I will tell you

abdomen.

They belong to 
of animals,

Some larvaB look like worms, but they transform 
finally into insects, with head, thorax, abdomen, and 
six legs. 

Worms never do that. 

Yes, Ned, the angleworm, or earthworm, is a true 
worm. There is not much difference between its head 
end and its tail end. It never has legs or wings, no 
matter how long it lives. 

The Larva 

When the little caterpillars (the larvae, you know) 
first hatched out of the Monarch's eggs, they were so 
tiny that one could hardly tell their color and shape ; 
but you know what they at once began to do. Yes, eat, 
eat, eat, eat ; and grow, grow, grow. 

It was great fun to watch them from day to day, 
they grew so fast and changed so rapidly. In two or 
three days the little dots of things looked quite like 
caterpillars with their yellow bodies ringed with black. 

Oh, yes, they shed their skins a number of times 
before they were full grown ; and you could tell when 
they were about to do it, for they would stop eating for 
several hours and look quite pale and faded. 

The outer skin that loosened and fell off was so 
very thin and delicate that you had to look carefully 
to find it. 



How bright their colors were after they had shed 
their skins, and how fast they grew ! 

Do you know, I see some milkweeds over there in the 
fence comer, and I should n't wonder if you could find 
some Monarch caterpillars there. Go and see. 

The Monarch Caterpillar 

Ah, yes ! now you know just how they 
look. You wonder what those two long, 
black horns near the head end are for ? 

And see ! there are two shorter ones 
near the tail end. 

No, they are not antennae. 

The butterfly has anten- 
nae, but the caterpillar has not. 
These horns do not grow from 
the head, you see, but from one 
of the rings back of the head. 

May has noticed that they cotne 
out of a black ring and, in sliort, 
look like an elongation of the black 
skin, and I am sure that is just 
what they are, ¡ª modified skin. 

As to their use, the caterpillar seems 
to use them like feelers, and ]jrobably they 
are sensitive, though I do not know whether 






they contain nerves of scent or not. But you see the 
caterpillar waves them about when it moves, as though 
it were using them to help find its way. 

No, indeed, caterpillars do not usually have these 
horns, ¡ª only the Monarch caterpillars and a few others. 

See its little, shining black head. Can you find its 
tiny, simple eyes ? 

Its body is not divided into thorax and abdomen. 
The segments are alike, except that there are legs 
attached to some of them. 

The -first three segments back of the head each bear 
a pair of short, sharp-pointed, jointed legs, with little 
feet at the ends. 

What is that. May, ¡ª it has several short, fat legs in 
the middle of its body ? Yes, we can see them quite 
plainly. 

True, Mollie, there are little clasping feet at the end 
of these short elephant legs. 

This caterpillar has four pairs of them in the middle 
of the body, and if you look at the tip end of the body 
you will find another pair. 

These extra legs are called "pro-legs." They are not 
jointed, and I can tell you something about them that 
you will like to know. 

They are merely modified skin. The skin is modified 
to do duty as legs. 





Yes, Mollie^ the skin is very changeable ; it readily 
assumes new forms. 

The caterpillar is supplied with prolegs because it has 
such a heavy, clumsy body to pull around. 

No, May, not all caterpillars have five pairs of pro- 
legs, though nearly all do. 

We shall meet a caterpillar that has less than ten 
prolegs, ¡ª that is, less than five pairs, you know, ¡ª and 
we shall meet one that has mure 
than ten. 

Generally, however, the true 
caterpillars have ten prolegs. 

Now see its little jaws move as 
it chews the edge of the leaf. 

Yes, John, the jaws of insects move sidti- 
ways, instead of up and down like ours- 

No, they have no teeth, but the jaws themBelves are 
quite hard and homy, and are sharp on the edges. In 
some insects they are notched like little saws on the edges. 

Yes, Mollie, this is just like the caterpillars 1 raised 
from the eggs, and I will tell you what happened to them. 

One day one of them stopped eating. It moved rest- 
lessly about and I saw threads of silk on the milkweed 
leaves. 

It had eaten enough. It began to feel the strange 
changes that were taking place in its little body, and it 



wished to creep away to undergo the wonderful trans- 
formation in store for it. It left the milkweed and 
began to wander about the room. So I put it in a large 
\ ^ pqpny box and shut the cover down. 

This safe hiding place was what it wanted, 
and it soon spun a little button of silk out of 
ita mouth on the under side of the box cover, 
and this button it grasped firmly with the two 
prolegs at the tail end of the body. 
Then it let go with all its other legs imtil it 
was hanging by its hind feet. It did not hang 
head down, but curled up a little, as you see 
in the picture. It hung there for a whole day, 
and then ¡ª the caterpillar skin split open and dropped 
off, and there remained, not a caterpillar, but a very 
beautiful little pupa. 

The Pupa 

This pupa looked as though made of delicate pea- 
green glass, and there were sparkling gold dots on it, 
and a line of shining gold halfway around the upper 
part of its body. 

You can hardly imagine anything more beautiful or 
anything more different from a yellow-and-black-ringed 
caterpillar. 





You see it had molted for the last time, and under its 
old skin was the hard pupa skin, like a shell. 

Yes, Mollie, the hard pupa shell is needed to protect 
it in its resting stage. 

In its larval or eating stage it can move about and 
curl up and wriggle, if disturbed. In its pupal or resting 
^tage it cannot help itself, and so it has this hard, shell- 
like skin, which, like all insect skins, is made of chitin. 

Some day you will find a strange and beautiful little 
object attached to a fence rail or a bush. It will be 
pale green with golden spots on it. It will be 
hard and smooth, and of a* strange shape. 

It will not look at all like a caterpillar 
or a butterfly, but you will know that it 
is the pupa of a Monarch butterfly. 

Some caterpillars are covered with 
hairs and some have spines on their 
bodies. But the pupa shell has no hairs, 
although it is sometimes supplied with 
sharp points. Sometimes it is very beautiful 
like a jewel, or, we might say, like a jewel case in 
which is inclosed the beautiful butterfly. 

The pupa of the butterfly has a name of its own. 
It is called a "chrysalis," or "chrysalid." Chrysalis 
comes from a Greek word meaning gold. So in its 
golden case the jewel lies. But not all chrysalids are 







golden, or pale 
green spotted 
¡öwith gold* Some are 
diill brown. 




know if the pupa ormnr^t move 
at all. Yes, if you touch it, it will sometimes 
move its abdomen. You can see the abdominal segments 
quite plainly as it hangs head down. You can also see 
the eyes if you look carefully, and the antennae and 
legs too, all soldered down into an immovable jacket. 

But soon it will be free. The chrysalid shell will 
split down the back, and out will come the butterfly 
that has been folded up inside. 

Under the chrysalid skin a wonderful trans- 
formation takes place: the form of the but- 
terfly gradually becomes perfected ; antennae, 
wing pads, legs, ¡ª all are there. 



In the beautiful green pupa case of the Monarch you 
can see in part what is taking place. 

In a few days the green shell will look darker and 
the veins on the tiny wings inside can be seen. Soon 
after this you can distinguish the bright colors of the 
wings. Such tiny wings ! not so long as the little pupa 
case. 

When the wings begin to shine through you must 
look often, for the coming out of the butterfly is close 
at hand. When the moment arrives the pupa shell will 
split open and out will drop a fat butterfly with tiny 
little wings. 

The Adult 

This fat butterfly will cling to the now empty pupa 
case with its slender, black legs. Then, before your 
very eyes, the soft little wing pads will lengthen and 
broaden and stiffen, the body will become slender, and 
in a few minutes there will be hanging from the empty 
pupa shell a perfect butterfly, ¡ª the adult as we call 
it, ¡ª opening and shutting its bright new wings. 

Now look at the pupa shell ! You will be astonished 
to see that it is no longer green with gold markings, 
but a little torn bag of thin, transparent chitin. 

When the butterfly has rested until those wonderful 
wings are fully expanded, away it flies, without learning 





how, just as though it had been flying all its life. 
Away it flies out into the lovely world it has 
never seen before. 

Ned says it did see the world ¡ª when it 
was a caterpillar. 
Ah, Ned! the caterpillar is not made for 
seeing. You have forgotten that its eyes are 
small and simple. 

Its one concern is to eat, and it doubtless finds its 
food not so much by seeing as by smelling. It can 
probably distinguish light from darkness, and perhaps 
can also see very near objects, but that may be all its 
eyes are capable of. 

It must await the wonderful transformation before it 
can really see the world. 

And now you will be interested to know that the wings 
of the butterfly are made of modified Q skin. 

The full-sized wings could not of ^^II course find 
room in the little pupa shell, and (^^L/^m A 

so they remain small and soft 
until they are free, when the air and 
moisture, rushing into them, stretch a 
them out into their perfect form. 'V [ 

Yes, Charlie, the butterfly imder- 
goes a complete metamorphosis. The 
larva is very unlike the adult, and it goet? into the' 






motionless pupa state, from which it emerges a trans- 
formed creature, as unUke the clumsy, creeping cater- 
pillar as you can imagine. 

You had better find some more of these caterpillars 
and take them home. Put a fresh milkweed stalk in 
a glass of water and the caterpillars will not leave it 
until they are ready to transform. As soon as one tries 
to leave the milkweed, put it in a box and it will soon 
become a chrysalid. It will take about a week for the 
chrysaUd to transform into a butterfly. 

Sometimes it happens that the caterpillar is not 
changed into a chrysalid. There is a fly on the watch. 
Although the Monarch caterpillar has such a disagree- 
able odor and taste that birds let it alone, yet this fly 
does not find it unpleasant. On the contrary it looks 
eagerly about for these caterpillars, and when it finds 
one it lays an egg or two in its body. 

That, as you may imagine, is the end of the poor 
caterpillar, although you would not suspect there was 
anything the matter. It eats and grows and finally 
hangs itself up to become a chrysalid. By this time 
the fly's larvaB, which have been living inside the cater- 
pillar, are ready to undergo their transformation. So 
out they come, little whitish maggots, that fall to the 
ground, into which they burrow, later to emerge as 
perfect flies. 





The poor caterpillar has been so nearly eaten up by 
these merciless, uninvited guests that it can only die. 

This is very often the fate of the Monarch cater- 
pillars that live out of doors. But if you are fortunate 
enough to get the eggs you will have nothing of the 
sort to fear. 

The Swallowtails 

Now let us go out again and 
take a run across the 
meadow. 

The golden-rod still 
lights the hedges, 
but where are the 
Monarchs ? 
What has become of the 
great Bwarm we saw a few 
days ago? 
Who can understand the ways of the Mon- 
archs ? Suddenly they appear in thousands ; the air is 
full of them. 

Then they disappear ; they have gone somewhere else 
and you only see one here and there. 
But to-day we have the Swallowtails. 
See ! on the edge of that pool are five or six of them 
sipping the water. 








Yes, Ned, they are called Swallowtails 
from the long, tail-like extensions on the 
hinder wings. 

Watch that one rise and sail away. 
It is a handsome little craft ; its sails are 
of yellow, banded with black. 

These yellow and black Swallowtails are 
called Turnus butterflies. 

Perhaps if we look on those weeds in 
the fence corner we may find the cater- 
pillar of the Turnus. 

Ah! here is one. Strange Jittle creature! 
Nell says it has big eyes like a fish. 
John declares that those spots 
are not its eyes. They are only 
marks on its body. 

See if you can find its tiny 
head ¡ª its little dots 
of eyes are not easy to 
find. 

Mabel thinks it is 
lying on a spider's web. 

No, Mabel, it is lying ^ 
on a bed of its own weav- 
ing. It made that little 
mattress of silk. 








Yes, the silk was first in a liquid form in the head of 
the caterpillar. It hardened into silk when the cater- 
pillar spun it out. 

Mabel says she knows of another Swallowtail, ¡ª a 
black one with yellow and blue markings on the wings. 
^:?^ That is the Black Swallowtail, 

^MC4: and it is a beauty. 
^"^^^ Besides the orange and yellow 

¡ª -^i" spots on its wings there are patches 
covered with shining blue or green scales. 
Oh, yes, indeed! the yellow spots are 
made of yellow scales. Rub off the scales 
and you have only a thin, papery, color- 
leyss wing left. 

The larva of the Black Swallowtail is 
the well-known green caterpillar, with 
black rings and yellow spots on it, that 
sometimes covers the leaves of the pars- 
nip or caraway plants. 
Mollie says she saw some in the fence corner yester- 
day. Let us go and get them. 

Are n't they gay fellows ! Why, why ! what is the 
matter ? 

Nell's caterpillar has horns! She poked it with a 
stick and it shot out two soft, yellow horns from behind 
its head. What a caterpillar ! 





The yellow horns are pretty on its green body, but, oh 
dear ! what an odor they give off ! It is fairly sickening. 

Ned says that it makes that vile odor for the same 
reason that the grasshopper makes molasses, ¡ª it wishes 
to be let alone. 

I think that is so. 

If you poke these larvae they will punish you. 

They wish to be let alone so that they can eat, eat, 
eat. 

Yes, May, I think they are so brightly colored because 
they want to be seen and recognized at once. 

No bird would eat such vile-smelling things, and they 
do not want a bird to mistake them for an edible cater- 
pillar and swallow them down before it discovers its 
mistake. So they shine out, bright flags of warning. 
Birds soon learn .^.^^^ to recognize vile-smelling 

caterpillars and ^^UJJ^*'^^--^ ^ l^t them alone. 

Here, under this ^t^^ll^sl^^'^^i^ twig, is the 
chrysalis of one of ^?^^^ our Swallow- 

tails. Strange little brown ^'^ object! 

Not only is it suspended by the two prolegs at the 
tail end, but it is also supported by a silken line 
thrown about its body. 

Evidently it does not wish to be blown away. 

We will take the chrysalid home and perhaps we 
shall see the butterfly come out of it. 






Watch the Swallowtail butterfly on that flower. 

It has six long, black legs. 

The Swallowtails do not belong to the Four-footed 
butterflies. 

We do not distinguish the butterflies by their legs so 
much as by their wings. 

Each species has its wings veined differently. 

It is very difficult to study the veining on the wings 
of the butterflies, ¡ª too difficult for us now, but some 
time you may want to do it. 



Sulphur Butterflies and Spring Azures 

Little Nell says she knows where there are some little 
yellow butterflies. She sees them every day clustered 
around a wet spot by the roadside. 

Oh, yes, here they are ! They are the Sulphur butter- 
flies. We see them everywhere in the 
summer time, for they love to hover 
about wet places. Sometimes dozens 
of them will stand around a mud 
puddle. The little larvae feed on 
clover. 
?r There goes a white one. That 
J¡ì^^^^^^i-H^^<;' is a Cabbage butterfly, ¡ª a pretty 
^"^ * little nuisance. 






Mollie wants to 
know why it is a 
nuisance. 

John says he can guess* 
He thinks the larvae feed on cab- 
bage leaves. 

They do, and that is why it 
is called the Cabbage butterfly. The 
next time you go into the garden, examine the 
cabbages to see if there are wormholes in them. If 
so, you wUl doubtless be able to find a little cater- 
pillar, just the color of the cabbage leaf, with yellow 
bands running the length of its body, ¡ª that is the 
larva of the Cabbage butterfly. 

It is not always easy to find these larvae, for they 
burrow into the very heart of the cabbage, where it is 
tenderest and juiciest, and also where they do the most 
harm. 

The Sulphur and Cabbage butterflies do not belong 
to the Four-footed butterflies, but, like the Swallowtails, 
their chrysalids are lashed fast by a silken cord. 

Another lovely little roadside frequenter is the Spring 
Azure. It is much smaller than the Cabbage butterfly, 
and gets its name from its color. 

Azure, you know, means blue, ¡ª sky color, ¡ª and 
these daintiest of butterflies are of this color. 




They are like flower petals fluttering in the sunshine. 

They, too, like wet places, and, as in the case of the 
Cabbage butterfly, you will sometimes find great num- 
bers of them grouped about a wet place in the road. 

They flutter up, a shining company, when any one 
approaches them. 

The under side of their lovely wings is pearly gray 
or white, with tiny black spots. 

Yes, indeed, Charlie, there are a very great many 
species of butterflies. 

Some are large and some are small. Some are 
bright in color and some are dull. But they are all 
beautiful. 

Yes, May, they all began life as caterpillars. Every 
butterfly was first a lowly, nearly blind, creeping 
caterpillar. 




MOTHS 



The Luna Moth 

Here is John with a prize. 

He found it by the roadside, and he says it is, a 
pea-green Swallowtail butterfly. 

What a beauty ! 

Little Nell says that it has windows in its wings. 

The round wing spots are transparent like glass, and 
they are bordered with beautiful bright-colored scales. 




But, John, this is not a butterfly ; it is a moth. 
MoUie says she always thought moths were little 
gray things that ate our clothes. 

Ah, but there are a great many kinds of moths, 
Mollie. Some are tiny gray things and some are very 
large and handsome, like this one. 
How do I know that it is a moth? 
There are several ways to tell the moths from the 
butterflies. One way is by the antennae. You remem* 
ber that the antenna of the butterfly is thread- 
like, with a knob at the end. 

Now look at the antennae of our beauti- 
ful green moth. You see they are flat and 
broad and are fringed along the sides like 
little feathers. 

No, not all moths have feathered antennae, 
but no moths have antennae with knobs at the tips. 
Another way to tell the moths from the 
butterflies is by the manner in which they 
h(4d their wings. 
When the butterfly is at rest it holds 
its wings close together and straight 
up over its back. 

Yes, Nellie, that is why it is so easy 

to pick up a butterfly by the wings. 

The moth does not hold its wings up in this way. 










Some moths, like the one John has here, 
allow the wmgs to lie out flat. 

Others fold them down on the sides of the 
body, making a sort of tent roof over the 
back, as shown in this picture. 

Another difference is that butterflies fly in the day- 
time, while most of the moths appear at night or in the 
dusk. They flutter about the iiight-bloomiiig 
flowers, from which they extract nectar. 

This exquisite creature that John has 
brought us is the Luna moth. 

Luna is the Latin word for moon, and [^ 
it is derived from a word mean- 
ing to shine. 

This, then, is the shining 
moth, the moth of the moon, 
¡ª or we might call it the moonlight moth. 

May says she thinks it is mysterious and lovely like 
moonlight. 

Yes, and it flits about in the moonlight. 

Mabel says that of all the beautiful insects she has 
seen she thinks the Luna moth is the loveliest. 

And Ned thinks that nothing else so well deserves 
its name. 

Beautiful Luna! 

See what wonderful colors are in the wings. 






Its eye spots, or wing windows, are edged with red 
and yellow, and it has a margin of purple along the 
outer edge of the front wings. 

Its legs are a dull purple-red, and its body is heavily 

dressed in a coat of snow-white down, while its wings 

are an exquisite pale green color ; but no 

words can describe the beauty 

of this moth. 

Yes, Mayj moths belong to the 

same order as the butter- 

^ flies, ¡ª to the Lepidoptera. 

Nell says that our Luna is fuzzier than a butterfly. 

The moths are generally thicker and fuzzier than 

the butterflies. 

John wants to know from what kind of a caterpillar 
the Luna comes. 

It is a large caterpillar, as you would expect, and it 
is a handsome one. It is over three inches long when 
fully grown, and it is pale green in color, ¡ª not quite the 
color of the wings of the moth, but rather more bluish. 
It has a light yellow stripe running the length of its 
body on each side, and there are yellow bars across its 
back, with tufts of hairs growing from the top of each 
segment. 

Now see Ned's eyes sparkle! He has one of these 
caterpillars in a box in his pocket to show us. What 





a gorgeous great fellow ! And how plainly the spiracks 
show on its sides ! 

It feeds on the leaves of forest trees, and when it is 
ready to become a pupa it does not attach itself by the 
prolegs to some strong support and there transform in 
the open air. 

Oh, no ; this larva spins itself a snug cradle of silk. 

We call this cradle of the moth a ^' cocoon." ? 

Many species of moths make cocoons, though there 
are some that do not. 

The Luna likes to weave its cocoon on the ground 
among the fallen leaves, which it wraps about the 
outside of the cocoon. If you look under the trees in 
the fall of the year, 
may find some of the 
cocoons of the 

Luna moth ¡ª ^^??^^i'?/?^;^l'^^ 

lying like ripe "~^::: ^1;^^ M m |^^ f 

fruit on the grouinl " 

The Silk Moth 

Yes, John, the silkworm is the larva of a moth. 
It is really not a worm but a caterpillar. 

It is a very old friend of man ; for ages it has been 
cultivated for its silk, and the cocoon of this caterpillar 
is the source of our beautiful silk cloths. 





The silkworm ¡ª to use ita Gommon 
rjative of China, where for centurie^^ 
raised with 



name ¡ª is a 
it has been 
the great- 
est care, 
80 that it 
has changed 
very 
much 




animal It 
kind of mill 



in color and in the 

quality of its silk. 
In short, it has be- 
come a domestic 
feeds on the leaves of a certain 
berry tree that is also foimd in 
China. Of course the silkworm is no longer confined to 
China, but is raised in other parts of the world, ¡ª in Italy, 
for instance, whole families devoting all their time to 
the care of the silkworm. Even the little children help. 

Here is the pic- 
ture of a 

""¡ª ^^--^ It is a light<3olored 
caterpillar and it is about the size shown here. 





Yes, Mollie, it has a 
queer wrinkled hump on \ 
its back, but in spite of 
that it is rather a dainty 
looking little creature, 
and a great eater, as 
all caterpillars are. V^ 

When full grown 
the caterpillars weave a 
thick, smooth, roundish 
cocoon of very strongs fine 
threads which are pale yellow 
or white in color. 

Here is a picture of this cocoon, \ 'M^ my dears. 
As you can see, it is not much larger .f :^ than your 
mother's thimble, and yet from it / :^a^ can be un- 
wound a silken thread two miles ^ w long! 

This thread is indeed delicate! It is so fine that 
you can hardly see it, and within this wonderful cradle 
made of this fine silk lies a very dainty little pupa that 

finally becomes a pale and pretty 

moth, as you see here. 

It is creamy white in 

color, with some faint 

brownish lines on the wings. 

Only a few of the moths are allowed 



to come forth in a silk-raising establishment, ¡ª just 
enough to supply plenty of eggs for future use. 

The reason is not far to seek. If the moth emerges 
the cocoon is torn and the silk ruined. So after the 
cocoons are made they are heated hot enough to kill 
the pupae within. 

Before the silk is unwound the cocoon has to be 
soaked in boiling water to dissolve the gummy sub- 
stance that fastens the dehcate threads together and 
makes the cocoon waterproof to protect the little in- 
mate against wet weather. 

The silk used to be unwound by hand, but it is now 
done dexterously by machinery. 

The threads may be bleached or dyed any color that 
is desired. 

Silk cloth is not woven of single threads, but the 
fine threads are twisted together into coarser, stronger 
ones, though some of these are still very fine. More 
and more strands are twisted together to make coarser 
threads for weaving, and, also for making sewing 
silks. 

Our little silkworm is one of the most valuable of our 
insect friends, and its cocoons are every year worth 
many millions of dollars. 

Mabel wants to know if we could not use the silk 
from the cocoon of the Luna moth. 



No, the Luna moth makes a thin cocoon that contains 
very little silk, not enough to be of use. 

We have a large native moth, however, whose silk is 
sometimes used, but this silk is not so fine and beautiful 
as that of the silkworm. 

The Polyphemus 

The name of this native silk moth is the Polyphemus. 

Fortunately I have one of them to show you. 

Charlie thinks it is almost as beautiful as the Luna. 

It is yellowish brown in color, 
you see, with beau- 
tiful markings on 
the wings. 

Yes, like the 
Luna it has a little 
windowlike spot ¡ª 
"eye spot" it is called ¡ª on each 
of its wings. 

Its copoon looks like tliat of the 
Luna, but it contains much more silk. 

The caterpillar feeds on the leaves of 
forest and fruit trees, and it too rolls a 
leaf about its cocoun, weaving a strong 
band of silk about the twig to which the 
leaf grows, so that when the leaf is ready to 






fall it cannot do so. The cocoon hangs dangling to the 
tree, though sometimes it is made among the leaves on 
the ground. 

The Cecropia 

Another of these large cocoon-making moths common 

among us is the Cecropia. 
See tills one that flew into 
the sitting room 
one night. Is it 
not a wonder! It 
has on a red and 
white velvet coat, and 
its brown wings are beau- 
tifully marked with red 
and black and gray and white. 
Noj it has no windowlike spots 
in its wings, but it has a large, 
white, crescent-shaped spot, bordered 
with red and black, on each wing. 
It is a fuzzy fellow. 
And here, my dears, is its larva. 
Did you ever see such a big caterpillar ? And really 
it is very handsome. 

See the tubercles along its body. Do they not, make 
you think of the buttons on a gorgeous uniform ? 



Those near the head are like red coral, and see ! some 
of the others are bright blue and some yellow. 

No, it will not hurt you. 

You can let it walk on your hand. 

What is that, May,- ¡ª you wouldn't let it walk on 
your hand for anything in the world? 

Well, I don't believe it wants to walk on your hand. 

Now I will tell you what to do with it. 

Put it in a large box with netting over the top. Give 
it fresh apple or oak leaves every day ¡ª all it can eat. 

After a few days something will happen. 

Spinning 

Something is happening in the box with the Cecropia 
caterpillar. 

A large silken cocoon is growing like magic there. 

The larva has done eating ; it has become a spinner, 
¡ª a weaver, industrious, wonderful. 

See it toss its head about. A glistening thread follows 
wherever that little head moves. 

The silk is within the caterpillar in the form of a 
liquid. 

This liquid silk is drawn out in a fine thread through 
a spinning apparatus in the upper lip. 

The upper lip is modified to form a spinneret. 






As soon as the fine thread of liquid silk comes in 
contact with the air it hardens. 

Fine as it is, it is surrounded by a gummy substance 
that causes the threads to stick together. 

Thus supplied with plenty of the best of materials 
made in its own little body, our weaver is eager to 
work. 

It touches its lip to the side of the box ¡ª the thread 
clings there. It throws its head to the other side of the 
cocoon and again fastens the thread. 
Thus back and forth it weaves, the glistening threads 
quickly fallinfj into place. 

It makes an outer shell of silk smeared thick with 

the gummy substance to keep out the wet. 

Then it weaves a looser layer of soft, silken 

threads, and finishes by a close-woven 

cover to its body. 

No wonder you love to watch this 
matchless weaver, who spins his 
thread as he uses it and makes 
this strong, brown cocoon. 

By to-morrow he will be 

almost lost to view and in 

four or five days the cradle 

of the moth will be finished. 

What happens next ? 






Could you look within the silken walls, you would see 
strange things. 

The caterpillar that retired from our view soon dis- 
appears forever. 

A caterpillar went in, but a caterpillar will never 
come out again. 

If we could see through the cocoon a few days after 
it is spun, we should find a little shriveled-up mass, the 
skin of the caterpillar. But that 
is not aU. In front of it 
we should see, in place of 
the caterpillar, a pupa. 

Look carefully at the 
pupa. It bears hints of 
coming moth. 

The abdominal segments are plainly to be seen, with 
their large spiracles. 

The thorax, too, is distinguishable. 

Look close! see the antennae soldered down to the 
front of the thorax ! 

Legs, too, you can get a hint of, and the wing' pads 
show plainly, all tightly fastened down. 

This pupa hes motionless before us. It is hard and 
brown, but it is not dead. 

Touch it, and it will show that it is alive ; it will move 
its abdominal segments back and forth. 







That is the only motion it can make. 
You see the pupa of the moth looks like the chrys- 
alid of the butterfly. It is shaped very much like it, 
only it 13 heavier and clumsier looking, and I 
^lo not think the pupa of the moth is ever 
brightly colored like the 
pupa or chrysalid of cer- 
tain of the butterflies. 
We can take the pupa 
from the cocoon, if we 
are careful, and look at 
it and return it to its 
cradle without harming 
it. It will still transform. 
These cocoons are made in the fall of 
the year and the pupa lies through the 
winter in its snug cradle, but it knows 
when spring comes. An astonishing 
change then comes over it. 
The dark brown pupa shell is burst asunder, the silk 
at one end of the cocoon is moistened, the threads are 
pushed aside or broken, and out of the open prison the 
beautiful moth comes forth. 

It has left its dry, chitinous pupa shell in the cocoon* 
It clings to the cocoon or to the nearest object until its 
small wing pads expand and its wings harden; then 





when night spreads a curtain of darkness over the earth 
it will fly about. 

The caterpillar of the Cecropia, as yqu see, builds a 



ooloi\ 
attached to tree 



tent-shaped cocoon, dark brown in 

You can find these little tents 
twigs in the fall of the year. 

The Cecropia does not usually 
wrap a leaf about its cocoon 
like the Polyphemus, and it 
attaches the cocoon firmly to 
twigs, so that 
it is not often 
seen lying on 
ground. 

The Prometh 

The Prometlj 
another of the 
Silkworms, as tl 
cocoon-making moths are 

sometimes called. It is not as large, however, as our 
Polyphemus or Cecropia. 

It looks a little like a smaller edition of the Cecropia, 
and it is the most abundant of all these large moths. 

We often see its cocoons hanging on lilac bushes. 





It is a very pretty cocoon, wrapped in a leaf; but Pro- 
metheus is far more careful of herself than is Luna. 

She is not going to he on the ground among the 
fallen leaves! She carefully winds silk all over the 
stem of the leaf and around the twig to which the leaf 
grows. 

Thus she ties the leaf to its own twig, as Poly- 
phemus often does, and all winter long the little 
cocoon swings back and forth in the wind. 

The pupa inside lies safe, 
waiting for the 



The Io 

Ah, Charlie ! you have 
something to show us. 

It is another of the Giant 
Silkworms, ¡ª it is the Io 
moth. 

You see it has red fore 
wings, which shows that it is a female moth. The male 
Io is yellow, and he is a good deal smaller than the female. 
Yes, May, the male insect is often quite different in 
appearance from the female, and he is almost always 
smaller. 

You will find the males of the butterflies and moths 
noticeably smaller than the females as a rule, and the 
female moths have \ narrower antennsB than the males. 

Iti is a ^^ wicked-looking 

It is covered all over 

s^harp prickles that 

sting like nettles if 

you touch them. 

Yes, that is its method of 

protecting itself. 

You may be sure it does 

hide away. It is green with 

lilack-tipped spines and it has a brown stripe

down each of its sides. Most children know them and 
are careful not to touch them. 

No, John, not many of the caterpillars are as well 
protected as our venomous lo ; that is, they are not so 
well protected from us. 

A good many of them are gifted with a bad flavor 
that keeps the birds at bay, and little Nell says truly 
that like the grasshoppers a good many of them "make 
molasses " and spit it out on oiu- fingers when we touch 
them. 

The Woolly Bear 

No, Mabel, not all moths make cocoons, though a good 
many do. 

Butterflies never make cocoons. 
You can get some very beautiful moths by collecting 
cocoons and keeping them until the moths come out. 

Look for them all summer, but particularly in the fall 
of the year. , 

Be careful not to mistake a case of spider's eggs for 
--__^ a cocoon. 

^ The case in which the spider 

/ r lays its eggs sometimes looks 
very much like a little cocoon, for 
cocoons are not always large. 
What do you suppose hatches out 






of the little fuzzy cocoons we so often see in fence 
corners ? 

See, John has one of these little cocoons. 

They are not made wholly of silk. They are made 
of felt, like a felt hat, you know. The caterpillar takes 
the hairs from its own body and with a little silk and 
gum mats them together into a feltlike substance. 

John says it must be a hairy caterpillar that 
does this. Yes, it is our little friend the 
Woolly Bear. You all know tlie fellow witli 
a heavy coat of fur, black at 
the head and tail ends and 
tawny in the middle, and that 
suddenly curls up when you 
touch him. 

We often see him hastening along the 
paths in the fall of the year. 

His real name is the Isabella Tiger moth. 

A near relative to this one is the Yellow Bear, a very 
common caterpillar indeed, with a coat of long, yellow 
hairs. 

It also makes its cocoon out of its own hairs, and 
the moth that emerges is the snowy white little miller 
with black dots on its wings, that we sometimes sur- 
prise into daylight flight when we walk in the grass or 
among the bushes. 








Millers and Other Moths 

^^ Oh, indeed, there are a great many 
species of inothB, Some are large and 
V^ some are smalL Some make cocoons 
and some do not. Some come from 
smooth caterpillars and some from hairy 
or prickly ones. 
We call the smaller moths millers. 
You all know the millers. 

Most of the moths drop their wings down 
roof -like over their backs when they 
^^^f are not flying. Very few, except the 
^f Giant Silkworms, keep their wings 
spread. No, not all moths have feathery 
antemue. Some have long, slim ones, 
bnt without knobs at the ends. 
Knobbed antennae belong to the but- 
terflies, you know. There are 
many, many moths, ¡ª and just 



as many caterpillars. In the summer time caterpil- 
lars seem to be everywhere, ¡ª green ones and brown 
ones, striped and streaked and spotted and speckled 
ones, smooth ones and fuzzy ones, spiny and prickly ones, 
bright ones and dull ones, tufted ones and humpbacked 
ones, large ones and small ones, ¡ª and they all eat, 
eat, eat the green leaves, or the fruits, or the bark, 
or the wood. 

Some we can pick up, others have a very bad odor, 
and others again are covered with prickles that sting 
like nettles. 

Some moths are our good friends, like those that give 
us silk ; others do us no harm ; but a good many are 
very destructive to vegetation while in the larval state. 

The Akmy Worm and Tent Caterpillar 

Yes, May, the Army worms are caterpillars. They 
are not worms. 

We often see caterpillars that we call Army worms, 
but we do not notice them particularly luiless they 
occur in very large numbers. 

This caterpillar is about an inch and a half long and 
is striped with yellow and black. It has no hairs on its 
body, therefore we say it is naked. 

You know why the Army worm has its name. 





Yes, Ned, it sometimes appears in countless numbers, 
¡ª an army that goes marching over the fields destrojdng 
everything before it. An army of these caterpillars is 
a terrible sight to the farmer. 

The miller that comes from the Army worm is dull 
brown with a white spot on each fore wing. 

Another troublesome larva is the Tent caterpillar. 
You have seen its tents many a time in the apple trees. 
When these tents are first made they are often quite 
handsome, but ; the caterpillars, unlike the spiders, 
housekeepers. They take no, pains 
to keep their web clean, and it 
soon becomes very- 
dirty and disagreeable 
to look at. 

These caterpillars 
are social in their 
habits; they do not 
wander far from home. 

night they all return 
to the tent they have made. 
h you suppose they talk over 
events of the day? 
They are often seen hanging from 
the leaf by a thread of silk. 

Wherever the Tent caterpillar goes it spins its thread. 





Perhaps it does so in order to find its way 
home at night. I do not think it can see where 
to go with its tiny, simple eyes. 

It may use the thread as Ariadne used the 
clue to help Theseus find his way out of 
the labyrinth. 

Do you know the story of Ariadne and the 
labyrinth? Get somebody to tell it to you. 

The Tent caterpil j^ lars are very destructive to 

farmers dread them and 
with torches when the cater-

cater pillars 

They travel 




along the twigs and 
branches until they 
find a fork that 
suits them. 

Here they 
make their 

tent and eat the buds and young leaves of the tree. 
Is it not wonderful how the moths and butterflies 






remember just what kind of leaves the larvae must have 
to eat ? The butterfly and the moth eat nothing but 
honey or fruit juice. The caterpillars need certain kinds 
of leaves. 

Each butterfly, each moth, remembers to lay the eggs 
on or near the right kind of plant, so that when the 
little caterpillars hatch out they will have food. 

You see they provide for their young although they 
pay no attention to them after the eggs are once laid. 

John says he thinks all insects provide 
for their young. 

Very true, John; but some are more 
careful parents than others. 

However, all remem- 
ber to lay the eggs in 
places that are suitable fur 
the young. 

The Measuring Worm 

What is little Nell looking at so care- 
fully? 

She has a Measuring worm on her finger. 

May thinks it should be called a " measuring 
caterpillar.'' 

It certainly is a caterpillar, 

What a cunning fellow! 




See how industriously it is measuring little Nell's 
finger. There it goes! 

No, it has not fallen to the ground. It is suspended 
in mid-air by a cord of silk. 

The Measuring worms are cautious travelers. They 
are always provided with a silken cable to catch them 
in case they fall. 

May has just discovered that the Measuring worm 
has no prolegs in the middle of its body. 

John says that is why it walks in loops. 

Having no legs in the middle, it draws those at the 
tail end close up to those at the head end and humps 
up its back at every step. 

No, it has not as many prolegs as the 
other caterpillars. Generally it has 
only four instead of ten. 

Have you ever seen a little /^ 7 
brown Measuring worm / ^ ] 
standing on its hind feet, its , \\' . w 
body stiff and straight like 
a little dead twig on a bush ? 

Yes, you all know what that 
means. Little Loop worm has no idea of being swal- 
lowed by a bird, so all day long he stands reared up 
on end and " plays possum/' but when night comes he 
gets down and goes to feeding in the safe darkness. 



The moths of the Measuring worms are dainty little 
creatures that fly up when we go for a walk in the 
woods or fields. 

Many of these moths do us no harm, but others are 
very troublesome, as the Cankerworm, which is the 
most destructive of all the Measuring worms. 

The innocent- ^^^^ V y looking little 

moth lays her ^^^^^^^^^^^ff" ^ggs on fruit or 
shade trees, and ^K^^rw^^^ when they hatch 
the little caterpil ^^^--^ ^K^^ lo^^g proceed to eat 
the leaves of the tree on which they find themselves. 

When full grown they let themselves down from the 
tree by their silk thread and bury themselves in the 
ground to pass the pupal stage. 

One kind of Cankerworm makes a little cocoon 
down in the ground; the other kind just hollows out 
a place and transforms without troubling itself to make 
a cocoon. 

Ned wants to know how the moth finds its way to 
the upper world again. He says he should not think 
it could dig its way out of the ground without soiling 
its wings. 

No, it could not. 

It comes to the surface of the earth while it is still 
a hard, smooth pupa. It wriggles up by moving its 
abdominal segments. 



There is something very curious about the Canker- 
worms. The female moths have rudimentary wings, 
and so of course they cannot fly. 

They have to climb up the tree to lay their eggs on 
the branches. 

People sometimes paint a ring of tar or some other 
sticky substance around the trunks of their trees and 
thus prevent the moth from going up to lay the eggs. 

The Gypsy Moth 

No, John, we cannot get rid of the Gypsy moth so 
easily. It has, you know, become a serious nuisance in 
New England. 

It did not originally belong to this country, but was 
brought here from Europe. 

The female lays the eggs in a^*; 
mass and covers them with hairs f rom^ 
her own body. k^ 

She is quite a pretty little mothj ^^-^-^ 
with dark markings on her wings. 

The caterpillar of the Gypsy moth is quite a gay 
looking brigand. If it were not so troublesome a ma- 
rauder, we might admire its black body striped with 
yellow lines and ornamented with red and yellow tuber- 
cles bearing stiff, black hairs. 






A large force of men have to be hired each spring 
to collect and destroy the egg clusters and cocoons 
of the Gypsy moth from the trees in the parks of 
Boston and in many adjoining towns. 



The Codlin Moth 

Caterpillars cause us very great trouble. We have to 
be constantly fighting some of them in order to have 
anything to eat ourselves. 

Some species eat our vegetables, others our grains, 
and yet others our fruits. 

There is the Codlin moth, for instance. You may not 
know the moth itself, but you all know its larva, the 
little white " worm " at the cores of apples. 

It bores into the apple through the bud, eats all it 
wants, and when ready to transform, bores out through 
the side of the apple. This larva 
does look very much like a worm, 
but it is not a worm. 

Because it has lived in apple 
cores for so many generations its 
legs are very small and weak. 

But, you see, it transforms into 
a moth, so it cannot be a worm. 
If you keep the larva from a 




wormy apple for some time and give it plenty to eat, 
you may have a chance to watch it spin its little 
cocoon. The next spring, early, out of the cocoon will 
come a very dainty, lovely little moth dressed in pearly 
gray or rose pink robes. 

It looks far too beautiful to be mischievous. 

But be not deceived ! 

This elegant little fairy, if she gets the chance, will 
lay an egg in the bud end of the young apple soon after 
the petals have fallen, and there will be another wormy 
apple to testify to the activity of the Codlin moth. 

The Leaf Rollers 

See here ! Who do you suppose rolled 
this leaf up in that clever fashion ? 

Let us unroll it. Ah! that is easier 
said than done. See ! it has been fastened 
together by threads of silk. But in spite 
of that let us imroll it and find out, if we 
can, who this Leaf roller is. 

Ah ! I thought so. See that little 
caterpillar scurry back out of sight. 
He is very much frightened to have 
his home thus invaded. He rolls himself up in a 
leaf to hide from the light and then he is also 



safer from hungry birds and preying insects. Very 
many of the Leaf rollers eat the leaves which they roll 
about themselves. 

It must be very convenient to wrap yourself up and 
then find your blankets good to eat when you are 
hungry. 

May says that the edges of these blankets are bound 
with silk just like the edge of the blanket that mother 
made for baby. 

Look closely at this, all of you, and I think you will 
see a difference. 

See, May ; the caterpillars do indeed fasten the edges 
of the leaf together with silk, but they do not sew 
through and through as mother did, making a pretty 
silken binding. 

Some species fasten several leaves together, forming 
quite a web. Some of them mine into the leaf, making 
tunnels all over it. 

Oh, yes, you have all seen these leaves rolled up or 
embroidered by the caterpillars, and sometimes the work 
is done by the tiniest of tiny larvae that transform into 
minute but very beautiful little moths. 

Of course you all remember that caterpillars are 
larvce, and that the larva is the first stage of the insect 
after it comes out of the egg. 





The Sphinx Moth 



Listen ! What sound is that we hear ? 

Mollie says it is a humming bird. 

Let us look, ¡ª there, in the trumpet flower over 
the fence. 

Is it a humming bird ? 

No, it is a Humming-bird moth. 

What a pretty thing ! See it poise before the flower 
on steady, whirring wings. How quickly it darts about ! 

It has very strong wings, ¡ª stronger than any other 
moth, although some Hawk moths are small. Because 
of its strong wings it is also called the Hawk moth, for 
hawks, you know, have great strength of wing. 

These moths usually fly in the twilight, though we 
sometimes see one in the daytime. 






These moths, I think, have the longest tongues of any 
of the Lepidoptera. Such tongues can reach to the 
bottom of the flowers that have the longest tubes. 

Yes, John, these are also called Sphinx moths. 

The reason is ^^mm,. rather curious. 

The Egyptian f ^K Sphinx, jou remember, is 
a great stone f f/\ 1 image half buried m the 
sands of the V 7 J desert. It has the body 
of a lion and J the face of a woman. 




It is a great mytjtery t.L>Tj|7 ^he modern world, though 
no doubt it was once a temple built by the ancient 
Egyptians for the worship of their gods. 

Of course you cannot understand why any one should 
be reminded of the Hawk moth when thinking of the 
Sphinx of Egypt. 

Indeed, the resemblance is very fanciful and refers 
not to the moth but to the queer-acting larva, which is 
really a great beauty. When disturbed or when it is 
resting it rears up in a ridiculous manner, and people 
have imagined it looks like the Sphinx ! 


I do not think it does ; but at least it is mysterious, 
like the Sphinx. 

It goes down into the ground to 
transform. The pupa is dark brown 
and is large, as you 
would expect. You 
may see it by saving the 
caterpillars and letting 
them transform in a box 
of earth. 

Some species transform 
above ground in little shel- 
ters made by fastening 
leaves together with 
silk. Silk is certainly very convenient for the cater- 
pillars. Many of them are always ready with a supply. 

No, Ned, the butterfly and moth cannot make silk ; 
that power belongs exclusively to the larva. 

The large, green Tomato worm is the larva of one of 

our largest and hand- 
somest Sphinxes. 
Its pupa is often 
plowed up in gardens 
and can be recognized quickly because the tongue case 
is not soldered down to the body, as in other pupae, but is 
free, like a handle. 




The Sphinxes are very handsome creatures, though 
their upper wings are not brilliantly colored. They are 
rather sober-looking brown moths and carry their wings 
folded down over their bodies. 

You need to look closely to see how beautiful these 
sober-hued wings are. The Sphinxes are at their best 
when flying, for what is prettier than a Humming-bird 
moth hovering in front of a flower? 

Other Brown Moths 

There are a great many big brown 
moths that are not Sphinxes. 

They often fly in at the window at night 
and insist upon singeing their wings over 
the flame of the lamp. 

Sometimes we see them resting on the 
wall in the morning, ¡ª those that have escaped being 

burned, ¡ª their wings 
like long, brown cloaks 
about them, folded over 
their backs, as is the fashion 
of the moths. 
But if they raise their upper 
wings, these brown moths are no longer dull. 

The under wings are often gayly trimmed with 
bright colors, ¡ª red and yellow and white. 





The Clothes Moth 

What eats holes in our best clothes and rums our 
furs? 

Nobody needs an introduction to the silvery little 
rascal that invades every home and causes us to worry 
over cedar chests, camphor, or moth 
balls as soon as winter is over. ^SL^^^^^^J^^ 

And yet if you were to see one of ^^^^ 




these little pests under the microscope, 

you could not help admiring it. / 

Its tiny wings are bordered with lovely fringes and 
covered with silvery scales. No fairy could be more 
daintily dressed. 

The little moths themselves do no harm ; it is their 
larvae that feed on our clothes. 

The eggs are laid on woolen cloth or fur. They 
hatch into tender little caterpillars that creep about in 
the dark, eating holes in the clothes. 

They spin a tube as they go ¡ª that is, some of them 
do ¡ª and mix bits of cloth with their own silk. In 
this tube a wonderful transformation takes place when, 
instead of a creeping caterpillar, there presently emerges 
a winged creature. 

Those that do not build tubes make a tiny silken 
cocoon in which to transform. 







The Flannel Moth and Meal Moth 

If the Clothes moths eat wool, here is a fellow who 
looks as if he were made of wool. See, it is the 
Flannel moth, and surely if ever an insect was well 
named, it is this one. 

Yes, it is very pretty with its cream- 
colored body and its fuzzy wings. 

The caterpillars of these moths differ 
from all other caterpillars by having an 
extra number of prolegs. 
Instead of ten prolegs they have fourteen. Yes, Nell, 
they have seven pairs of prolegs instead of five pairs. 

They make queer-looking cocoons, too, ¡ª queer not 
only in shape, but opening by a sort of trap i door. 
Here is one of them. 

Another which is almost as com- 
mon in our houses as the Clothes 
moth is the Indian-meal moth, 
whose larva gets into meal and 
dried fruits. This little, whitish, 
wormlike creature not only eati^ 
meal but spins delicate silken tubes all through them. 
Yes, indeed, we are all familiar with the traces of 
these little nuisances, though we may not know by sight 
the little moth that comes from the troublesome visitors. 




our fruit and 






The Skippers 

Just see the strange-looking caterpillar Amy 
has brought us! 

What a remarkably large head and long neck 
it has ! She found it rolled up in a leaf, 

I think it is the larva of one of the 
Skippers. These dark-colored little 
fellows seem to belong to both the 
butterflies and the moths. 

They fly in the daytime, which is like the butterflies, 
but they have stout bodies like the moths. 

Their antennaa are like those of the butterflies, except- 
ing that there is usually a little sharp tip beyond the 
knob, and they hold their wings like them. 

The pupa of the Skippers resembles the pupa of the 
moth, and the larva builds a slight cocoon, which is 

very decidedly a moth 
characteristic. 
Oh, yes, the Skippers are 
common enough, Ned. 
Do you not remember the brown 
butterfies that dart suddenly from 
a bush as you walk along ? 
They flash ahead and are resting on 
another bush so quickly that we cannot 





see what has become of them miless we are very 
attentive indeed. 

It is their habit of making these short, swift flights 
that has given them their name. 

They have big heads and their brown wings have 
white patches on them, and often patches through 
which the light shows. 

The Bagworm Moth 

Little Nell has foimd a caddice worm crawling on a 
tree. 

How very remarkable ! 

See, does it not look like a caddice ? 

^ No, indeed, it is not one. It is 
the queerest of the moths and its 
name of Bagworm moth is well 
bestowed. 

The larva makes its bag of silk 
and little twigs and moves about 
until it is full grown. 

Then it fastens its bag to a twig. 

One often sees these queer little 

cases dangling like so many brown 

tassels from the twigs of a tree. 

Within the bag the pupa forms and 





the moth comes out. But the female moth never leaves 
the home of her infancy. 

She has no wings, so when she emerges from the 
pupa case she remains within the bag. 

Here the eggs are laid, and when they hatch the 
little caterpillars creep out and each makes a tiny bag 
for itself. 

As it grows it enlarges the bag at the open end. 

The males come out of the bags as soon as they leave 
the pupa case, for they have wings with which to fly. 

Collecting Caterpillars 

Indeed, May, there is no end to the moths and 
butterflies. 

We might study them for years and yet we should 
not know them all. 

The best we have been able to do is to make the 
acquaintance of some of the more common ones, and 
of course in learning about them we have learned 
to know something of the habits of all Lepidop- 
tera, for in a general way they are alike. 

A very pleasant way to make the acquaint- 
ance of the butterflies and moths is to collect 
the caterpillars wherever you find them and take 
them home and keep them to look at. 







Towards the end of summer and in the autumn we 
often see large caterpillars wandering about apparently 
going nowhere. In reality they are seeking a place in 
which to metamorphose. They have done eating larval 
food forever. They will never consume another leaf. 
The silk glands in the heads of those that spin are 
now full to overflowing. 

If you take these wandering ones and put them in a 
box of earth, you may have the pleasure of owning some 
very beautiful butterflies and moths. Give them plenty 
of room and fresh air and at least six inches of good 
clean earth. 

If they are cocoon makers they will soon begin to 

\{ spin ; if they are not they will attach themselves to the 

^ sides of the box and become chrysalids, or they will 

burrow down into the ground, there to undergo the 

great change. 

Yes, indeed, Charlie ; another good way is to collect 
the caterpillars with a supply of the leaves on which 
they are feeding. 

Keep them well fed in the box of earth and do not 
forget to give them a drop of water occasionally. Cat- 
erpillars are thirsty creatures and eagerly drink up a 
few drops of water sprinkled on the leaves. 

The substance of the leaf itself does not seem to con- 
tain quite enough moisture to satisfy them, and it is 






I' 






quite interest- 
ing to watch 
the little mouths 
search around 
near the drop of water until it is 
found, when it is quickly sucked up. 
Of course the box in which the cat- 
,¡ª L tME^ erpillars are kept will need to be covered 
yS'Vl ^*th a piece of netting to prevent the 

captives from walking off when they have 
done eating and are ready to hunt up a good 
place in which to transform. 

There is no pleasanter way of amusing oneself out of 
doors in the fall of the year than in hunting for the 
caterpillars and watching them prepare for their winter 
sleep. Later in the season ¡ª in October and November, 
and indeed all through the winter ¡ª we can hunt for the 
cocoons attached to the twigs of trees, or dangling on 
slender cords from bushes, or safely tucked away in 
fence corners, the crevices of old stone walls, under 
piazza roofs, or anywhere else where protection is 
afforded to the helpless occupants of the cocoons. 



Yes, May, it is much more interesting to go walking 
with some object in. view. Even in the winter months 
when the snow is deep on the ground we can enjoy the 
woods and fields, and even then we can add to our store 
of cocoons. It is only necessary to keep our eyes open 
as we walk along. You know we can learn to see 
things by looking very carefully at first, then after 
a while we will notice the things about us without 
making any apparent effort. 

Oh, yes, we can have butterflies and moths even in 
midwinter by keeping the cocoons in the warm house. 
The heat causes them to undergo their metamorphosis 
more rapidly. 

Yes, it is a pity to have them come out too early, for 
they cannot fly out of doors, and soon die. 

Remember to keep the earth in the caterpillar box a 
little moist if the box is kept in the warm house, other- 
wise the dry air may cause the wings to shrivel up 
before they have had time fully to expand. 

I am sure you will have a great deal of pleasure 
watching the caterpillars and the beautiful butterflies 
and moths. 









FLIES 

Buzz! buzz! buzz! 

Listen to the flies. ^ 

They take possession of the ^"^^ 
earth in the summer time. 

We cannot keep them out of our 
houses even with screens. 

They seem to enjoy walking over our _Z^\^ 
faces when we are asleep, particularly 
in the early morning. But though the flies __vr-^ 
are so troublesome they also do a great deal of good. 

What, May, you cannot imagine how a fly can be 
of any use ? 

Nevertheless, the fly helps to keep the world clean. 

Like the turkey buzzard it is a very good scavenger. 

You know how quickly dead animals decompose in 
warm countries, and how bad any sort of refuse matter 
is in those regions. 

Well, the buzzard is always on hand. As soon as an 
animal dies he is there, and in a few hours not a vestige 
remains but polished bones that the hot sun soon makes 
perfectly dry and clean. 





The buzzards watch about the peoples' houses and 
quickly consume anything that is thrown out. 

So useful are these large, awkward birds that no one 
f^^\ ever thinks of killing one. Indeed, in many places, 
there is a heavy fine imposed for killing a buzzard 
that in spite of its good deeds is no beauty. Its 
lead is bare and suggests its horrible food ; 
is body is large and awkward, though when 
t flies it is one of the most beautiful things 
in nature. It spreads its great wings and 
soars and floats in the air for hours at a 
time, seeming scarce to move a pinion. 
The flies are the insect buzzards. 
They help the buzzards in hot countries, 
and in the North where there are no buz- 
zards they perform an important service. 

You see it is not the adult fly that does the work. It 
is the larva. 

John says it never occurred to 

him that flies came from larvae. ,-¡ª*-- 

But they do. -^^^^ 

The larva of the fly is the little -iir 

footless thing we call a maggot. 

Probably you have all seen maggots in decaying 
animal or vegetable matter, and here is the picture of 
some enlarged. 





The fly lays the egg and it soon hatches into this 
little white wormlike creature. 

No, it is not really a worm, though it much resembles 
one. 

Why is it not a worm, May ? 

Yes, because it will transform into a six-legged 
winged creature. True worms never do that. 

Cheese Skippers 

Maggots are often found in cheese, where they are 
called skippers because they skip about so when 
disturbed. 

How can they skip without legs ? 

That is easy enough for a maggot. It just doubles 
its head end and tail end close together and suddenly 
straightens out. 

Some people think that maggots are natural to some 
kinds of cheese, but this is not so. 

There are no maggots excepting those that hatch 
from the eggs of flies. The cheese maggot comes from 
the egg of a small black fly only half as large as a 
house fly; these maggots are also found on ham and 
bacon. 

If food is covered so that flies cannot get into it, it 
will never contain maggots. 






Flesh Flies 

Some species of flies lay their eggs in meat, and we 
have to be careful in the summer time not to leave the 
meat exposed or we shall be sure to find little patches 
of small white eggs on it. 

These are the eggs of the flesh-eating flies. 



Metamorphosis of Flies 

When maggots have eaten and grown and molted in 
the usual way, they change into pupae. 

Sometimes they make a cocoon of delicate silk before 
they change, but some species remain in the last larval 
skin, which shrinks and hardens into 
a pupa case and is called a puparium. 
Yes, John, the flies imdergo a com- 
plete metamorphosis; here are pic- 
tures of the adult fly, the long, slen- 
der maggot, and the shorter, thicker 
puparium. 

Yes, indeed, these are all. a good 
deal magnified, so that we can see 
them distinctly. 

No, May, flies do not grow after 
their final metamorphosis. When 









they come out of the pupa state as winged flies 
they are as large as they ever will be. 

This is true of all insects. They do not grow 
after their last molt. 

The flies do all their growing while they are maggots. 
The tiny flies we sometimes see will not grow any 
larger. They are a small species. They 
come from small maggots. 

There are a great many species of flies 
in the world. Some are large and some 
are small, but they all have their mouth 
parts formed into a tube for sucking, and some can 
also pierce with their mouth tube. 

Yes, indeed, John, some flies are very 
troublesome or even dangerous to us, and 
on the whole it is a question whether the 
Fly Order is not more injurious than bene- 
ficial to the human race. 

Although the flies are scavengers, and although the 
larvae of some species live on certain injurious insects 
and destroy them, yet many of the flies are instru- 
mental in spreading diseases. 
1/1 1 The fly crawls over or sucks the blood 
of the diseased animals or persons and 
then carries the poison to a healthy person. 
It has recently been discovered that flies 






carry the germs of malaria, as we have heard, and are 
important instruments in spreading this troublesome 
disease. 

The House Fly 

The fly we know best is the common house fly. 
Perhaps you would like to know its name. It is the 
Musca domestica. 

You all know very well indeed how it 
looks, with its big eyes and glassy wings. 

Under a magnifying glass its body is 
rather hairy, although it looks so smooth to 
the naked eye. 

Yes, Ned, the fly has only two wings, and in that 
respect it differs from other insects. 

As you might guess, the Fly Order is the Diptera, 
from pteroii, a wing, and dis^ two. 

Behind the wings and in place of the hind 
wings, which are lacking, you can see on each 
side a little threadlike stalk with a knob on 
top. It is called the halter. 

Nearly all flies have these halteres. 

They are really rudimentary wings, and they show 
that once the fly had four wings. 

For some reason the hind wings dwindled to these 
halteres. 




There is nothing unusual about the legs of the fly. 
They are used for walking and for holding fast. 

Yes, little Nell, we remember about the foot of the 
fly, and how it is able to cling to smooth surfaces by 
the sticky hairs on the pulvillus. 

Yes, May, the antennsB are rather curious. They are 
short and thick and ^itMMU f ^^^ down in front of 
the face, with a little ' ^^j^^^ - featherlike bristle 
sticking out of each. *^ The tongue, you 

know, is doubled back under the head when not in use. 

You have all watched the fly eat with its thick short 
tongue, which is in the form of a tube by which it 
sucks up its food. 

House flies lay their eggs in horse manure, and so 
where the stable is near the house, flies will appear in 
swarms that blacken the walls. 

As the fly lays over one hundred eggs, and as it takes 
only about ^ week for the adult to appear after the egg 
is laid, you see there is opportunity for a good many 
flies to be bom in the course of a season. 

Stables should be kept very clean indeed, as house 
flies are known to carry diseases, and every means 
should be adopted to lessen their numbers. 

No, May, house flies do not bite. 

Ned says he has always heard that when the flies 
bite it is a sign of rain. 






That is so, but it is not the house fly that bites. The 
house fly is very annoying by walking over us and tick- 
ling our faces, but its tongue can only suck up juices. 

There is a fly, however, that looks like the house fly 
unless examined very carefully; this one bites and is 
the nuisance that finds shelter in our houses to escape 
an approaching storm. 

Some flies as you very well know are able to pierce 
with the mouth tube ; such is the horsefly and the fly 
that comes before the rain. 





The Horsefly 

See, there goes a big 
black horsefly ! 

Not all horseflies 
are large, however, 

and not all are black. Some have 

white patches on their wings, but 

large or small, black or not, they all can 

bile. They worry horses and cattle nearly 

to death in the summer time. 

They hide in the bushes by the roadside 

and when you come driving along, out they 

d'art and pounce upon your poor horses. 

Some of them bite us as well as our horses. 






When riding or driving tlirough 
the woods in summer we should 
always put branches of leaves in 
the horses' bridles, letting them 
hang over their ears and heads ' 
to keep off these flies; the 
Wild Indigo plant is a 
good one to use. It 
grows nearly everywhere 
along the roadsides; it 
bushy, and the flies dislike it. 

Now I must tell you something 
rather curious about the horsefly. It Ls the female alone 
that bites. The mouth parts of the male are small and 
are not able to pierce tough skin, and so he contents him- 
self with flower juices and water for his frugal repast. 
It is only the female among all the blood-sucking flies 
that is able to commit painful depredations 
upon our persons. For the most part 
she, too, contents herself with flower 
juices and other vegetable food, 
but when she gets her chance, ¡ª 
well, she makes the most of it. 

The horseflies are also called 
"gadflies" and '^deerflies." The 
bite of the gadfly is painful, but 





it does not last long, for fortunately it does not poison 
the blood as does the bite of the mosquito. But it is 
a dangerous fly, nevertheless, for it is known to carry 
disease germs to healthy horses and cattle. 

Horseflies are most abundant near wet places in the 
woods, and the larvae of some of them live in the water. 

The eggs are laid in the summer time and soon hatch 
into larvae. The larvae of the common black horseflies 
hibernate, and the adults come out early the next season, 
so we have the horsefly with us all simimer. 

Yes, the horsefly often spoils the pleasure of a walk 
or a drive in the country for us as well as for our 
horses, for several species of horseflies also bite human 
beings. 

John says he once had to walk by the horse's side to 
brush off the horseflies that clustered in a black cloud 
about its face and ears, driving the poor animal almost 
crazy. 

This often happens in wooded roads in midsimimer. 
I once drove a horse that was very sensitive to these 
flies. When even a single one settled on his neck or ear 
he would begin to groan in the most heartrending man- 
ner and continue to do so until I got out and brushed 
away the fly. You see that was his way of saying, 
" Please, dear mistress, come and take that tormenting 
fly away from my head." 






The Crane Fly 

Now do see that crane fly on the wall. What legs! 

Long Legs, I should think you would always be trip- 
pmg over yourself. 

Yes, MoUie, how plainly the halteres show on the 
crane fly ! 

Our crane flies do not bite. Suppose our friend here 
had a mouth tube as long as its legs, and sharp withal ! 





Now let US go to the little brook across 
^^ ^¡êJ^ the field and look along the edge. See, there 
by the roots of those weeds ¡ª what is 
it ? A spider's web full of crane flies ? 
No, just crane flies, numbers of 
them, all hanging together 
by their long legs. 

See, there are 





two or three of 
them dancing about. 



They lay their eggs in running water, though some 
species lay them in the ground. 

Yes, they look considerably like enormous mosquitoes, 
but fortunately for us they are not mosquitoes. 



The Mosquito 

Now, May, what do you think the mosquito is? 

May says she knows what it is, ¡ª 
it is a nuisance. ^^ 

Yes, it is a nuisance, but it is also 
a fly. 

Yes, my dears, the mosquito is 
but a species of biting fly. 

Like the other biting flies it is ^ 
only the female that bites. 




> 





She alone has power to suck our blood. 
The male mosquito is a harmless 
and pretty little gentleman^ 
who eats the sweet nectar of 
flowers and spares us, because 
he cannot bite. 

Although we may be 
tempted ¡ª when in a mos- 
quito-infested region ¡ª to 
believe that mosquitoes live upon nothing but human 
blood, yet as a matter of fact their principal diet is 
vegetable juices, flower nectar especially, and they are 

all, male and female alike, 
very fond of sweets, attack- 
ing the molasses jug as 
voraciously as flies when 
they get the chance. 

It is only a few out of 
the whole number of mos- 
quitoes living at any one 
time that get a chance to 
taste blood. 

The females, however, 
are very fond of it, and bite 
not only long-suffering humanity but horses and cattle 
as well, sometimes worrying the poor creatures sick, for 





unfortunately the bite of the mosquito is poisonous, and 
that is why it is so irritating to the skin. It probably 
injects a httle of its saliva into the wound it makes. 

Mosquitoes do not confine their attention to warm- 
blooded animals, but have been seen complacently filling 
a long-felt want from the heads of young fish, the 
chrysalids of butterflies, and presumably they would 
attack any Hving creature that they could reach and 
whose skin was not too tough. 

Since mosquitoes lay their eggs in water, much can 
be done towards getting rid of them by draining the 
swamps and filling up the wet places. 

Sometimes kerosene oil is put on ponds to destroy 
the mosquito larvae. 

Mosquitoes breed not only in swamps and ponds but 
in any stagnant water, and as it needs but a few days 
for the larvae to develop, a very small quantity of water 
will suffice to accommodate a large and hungry swarm 
of these unwelcome guests. 

Eain-water barrels are often the unsuspected strong- 
holds whence pour forth mighty hosts of bloodthirsty 
barbarians to make life miserable for the innocent 
inmates of country houses. 

You all know the larva of the mosquito. Yes, Mabel, 
it is the curious " wriggler " we so often see in stagnant 
water. 






Here are some in a tumbler. They 
look longer than they are, for the 
glass sides of the tumbler magnify 
them. 

The mosquito lays its eggs in a 
mass that floats like a raft on top 
of the water. When the weather 
is warm the eggs hatch in a few 
hours, and out of each egg comes 
a wriggler. 

This remarkable larva is often seen head down and 
tail up near the surface of the water. 

It seems to be standing on its head for no reason 
whatever. But it has a very good reason. Coming out 
of the side of its abdomen near the tip is a tube in 
_ which are two air vessels, and it is the 
tip end of this tube it is sticking out 
of the water. 

You see that is the way it breathes. 
At the tip of the abdomen are six 
hairs and four little flaps that give it 
quite an ornamental appearance. These 
appendages, however, are not for orna- 
ment, but to aid in propelling this active little larva 
through the water, for, as you very well know, it does 
not remain quietly breathing all day long. 





It comes to the surface for air; then snap, skip, 
whirligig, wriggle ! What has become of it ? It seems 
to have taken a fit; but no, it has merely taken itself 
to the bottom of the water, where it goes whirligigging 
about for something to eat. It has a big head, you 
see, and there are hairs about its ever-ready mouth that 
are in constant motion, fanning into it tiny particles of 
animal and vegetable matter. 

It molts and becomes a pupa, but do not imagine 
that this extraordinary creature does anything so ordi- 
nary as to retire into a cocoon or a puparium and keep 
quiet while undergoing its final metamorphosis. That 
would be expecting too much. 

Its larval stage lasts about a week in hot weather, ¡ª 
longer if the weather is cool, ¡ª and then it assumes the 
pupal form, which is but little less active than the larval 
form, though now it no longer eats, its mouth parts 
being sealed up, so to speak. 

But it breathes, coming to the surface of the water 

j^ as before, only now its breathing 

tubes are two in number and stand 
out from its thorax like a pair of 
little horns. 

It remains at the top of the 
water with the tips of its breathing 
tubes out, unless it is disturbed. 








when presto! it descends to the bottom as lively a 
wriggler as ever. 

Its pupal stage lasts but two or three days as a rule, 
when there emerges our well-known but not well-loved 
mosquito. 

The adult finds some snug comer before winter 
arrives and hibernates, coming forth at the first breath 
.of spring to lay its eggs. 

Sometimes these hibernating mosquitoes wake up 
during the few warm days that occasionally come in 
the winter time, and then they like to refresh themselves 
by biting us. 

Where there are long spells of dry weather the mos- 
quito does not die. Oh, no, it patiently waits for the 
rains to come and make pools and ponds in which it 
can lay its eggs. 

Yes, Charlie, there are a good many species of mos- 
quitoes in the world, and their transformations are not 
all just alike; the one we know best transforms as I 
have just told you. You can easily watch 
J it and see for yourself. 





Ned wants to know how the mosquitoes give us 
malaria. 

So you have heard about that, Ned. 

It would seem that certain species of mosquitoes are 
infested by the tiny malaria germs, and that these 
germs pass from the tube of the mosquito into the 
blood of the person bitten by this poisonous insect. 

It is now supposed that this is the principal, perhaps 
the only, way by which the malarial germ finds its way 
into human blood. 

No, little Nell, the mosquito does not sing by rubbing 
its wings together. Perhaps it does not sing on purpose. 
The humming sound we so hate to hear is caused by 
the rapid movement of its wings during flight. As 
soon as it comes to rest this sound ceases, as you well 
know. 

If it could come silently to its feast, we should not 
defeat its purpose so often. 

Warned by the tiny, shrill trumpet tones of the 
advancing one, we are often able to brush it away or 
even to kill it before it has had a chance to regale itself 
at our expense. 

Some flies, however, have a true voice and sing when 
we hold their wings immovable ; but how this is accom- 
plished we can learn better from the bee people, who 
have this power of song developed to a high degree. 






The Gnat and the Gall 

Yes, Ned, gnats are small flies, and some of them are 
as troublesome as mosquitoes, for they come silently, 
and the first intimation we have of their presence is the 
pain of their sharp little mouth ^ tube in our skin. 

There is one family of very 
tiny gnats with whose work 
we are better acquainted 
than with the gnat itself- 

Look at that willow 
over there. See how '^^^J 
many curious fruits it 
seems to be bearing. 

Yes, May, they look like M^ j 'M\ 
azalea buds, ¡ª the large buds \wl f^jjm 
the flowers come from. But ->fe.\(lLt>^i 
these are not flower buds. 
Once they were leaf buds, 
but a minute gnat laid its 
eggs on the young leaf bud M4\ 
and out hatched tiny maggots 

that ate into the bud and prevented its proper develop- 
ment. 

Instead of growing out into a healthy twig covered 
with leaves, the willow bud, when attacked by these 







larvie, thickens without lengthening, and finally becomes 
this queer stunted thing which we call a gall. 
If we were to open one of these galls early in 
the summer we should find the little maggot 
inside " as snug as a bug in a rug." 
It has a little room there in which 
it lives not only all summer but all 
winter, too, changing to a pupa early 
the next spring. 

When the willow buds are well formed 
and just ready to leaf out, the pupa in 
the gall bursts its bonds and out steps 
Madam Gnat, who loses no time in de- 
|X)siting her eggs on the young buds. 

You have all noticed the little swell- 
ings on pine twigs, but you may not 
know that these, too, are formed by the larvae of gnats. 
The larvae eat the bark of the pine twig, which causes 
the gummy sap to ooze out. This hardens, forming a 
covering about the larvae. In their little waterproof 
house they undergo their transformations. 

And there are the round golden-rod galls. They, too, 
are made by the maggot of a fly. 

The maggots that spoil our golden-rods have a happy 
time doing it. Think of living in a house whose walls 
were a golden-rod stem. 






Within this golden-rod gall in a little cell just 
large enough to hold it the little larva passes its 
days, to come forth at last a pretty fly, with no 
care but to seek other golden-rods upon 
which to lay its eggs. 

No, indeed, John, the flies are not re- 
sponsible for all kinds of galls, as you will 
discover in time. Indeed, the golden-rod has 
another gall on its stem that is made by the 
larva of a moth. It is oblong instead of 
round, and when you break it, it is hollow. 

The Hessian Fly 

Some of the great larvaB are very destruc- 
tive to grains and to clover, as they feed on 
the young seeds. 

The Hessian fly is one of the most formi- 
dable enemies to wheat that we have in this country, 
and it has destroyed many millions of dollars' worth of 
grain. It attacks rye and barley as well as wheat. 

It is a tiny fly, but its deeds are great. It lays its 
eggs on the wheat leaf, and the larvae crawl down to 
the stalk just where the leaf grows from it and there 
they feed on the juices of the plant to such an extent 
as to destroy the life of the grain. 




no 




The Hessian fly is not native to this country, or, as 
we say, it is not indigenous. It is supposed to have 
been brought to this country in the grain which the 
Hessian troops fed their horses in the War of the 
Revolution. 







Parasites 

There are a great many species of flies in the world, 
and a great many more in this country than we could 
make the acquaintance of in an ordinary lifetime ; but 
though we cannot know everything about all of them, 
we are glad to know something about a few of them. 

Quite a number of flies lay their eggs on other 
insects or in their nests, and the fly larvaB thus devour 
the other insects or their larvaB. These parasites are bene- 
ficial when the larvae they attack are harmful to us. 

Ned wants to know just what " parasite '* means. 

Well, Ned, long ago those people who did not work 
for themselves but who ate at the tables of the rich and 
earned their welcome by flattery were called 
parasites. 

The word came to be applied a] 
animals that live in or on other 
animals and at their expense. 
It is also used of plants that^ 
suck out the juices of other 
plants instead of getting their 
food from the earth. 

The mistletoe is a parasite. 
It grows on the limbs of trees 
and sends its roots through the 




into the sap and so lives without taking any trouble. 
When a fly lays its eggs on the larva of a beetle and 
the fly larva feeds on the larva of the beetle, then we 
very justly call the fly larva a parasite. 

Yes, May, lice are parasites, and so are bird lice and 
fleas and bedbugs. 

Some insects are parasitic in the larval form and not 
in the adult form, as is the case with certain flies. 
Some are parasitic in the adult and not in the larval 
form, as the fleas that do not suck blood until they are 
full grown. Some, like the lice, are parasitic in both 
larval and adult form. 

When insects are parasites in the adult form they are 
nearly always ^'degraded," as we say; that is, they 
have lost certain organs that their kind usually have. 
The bedbug is a degraded form, ¡ª it has lost its wings, 
¡ª and the lice are yet more degraded, having lost all 
the higher characteristics of the Bug Order to which 
they belong. They cannot fly and they cannot see well ; 
they are not much better than living machines for 
sucking blood. 

No, indeed, John, an animal is not a parasite because 
it eats other animals. 

Our swift dragon flies that hunt and capture insects 
are not parasites. Only those insects that live in another 
animal or on it and feed upon it are called parasites. 




The Robber Fly 

Yes, Mollie, that fellow is a fly. 
You thought so because you have been 
watching it a long time and found it had 
but two wings. It is easily alarmed, so if we wish to 
see it we must be very quiet. 

It has a long abdomen, which is unusual in flies. 
It is the robber fly ¡ª and there ! ¡ª now you ^ 
know why. ¡ª -^-^T 

Did you see it pounce upon that large 
green fly and grab it ferociously ? Now 
it is sitting on that twig eating its prey. 
These robber flies well deserve their name. 

J They are strong and fierce and some of 

^/ them are even able to capture and consume 

J that other notable robber, the dragon fly. 

The larvaB of these highwajnnen, so far as 

\ is known, live in the ground and prey upon 

the larvae of beetles. 










Beelike Flies 

Mollie looks deKghted. 
She says she has found a fly that 
mimics a bee. 

She thought it was a bee for a long 
time, but something in its behavior as 
it hovered over the flowers aroused her suspicions, and 
upon looking yet more carefully she discovered it had 
but two wings! 

Yes, Mollie, that is a trick some flies 
play upon the rest of the world.. They 
look like bees. Some of them are clothed in 
beelike hairs, some mimic the big bumble- 
bee with his yellow jacket, and some mimic wasps and 
hornets. 

Some of these masqueraderS go boldly into the nests 
of the bees and lay their eggs on the larvaB there ; others 
parasitize the eggs of moths, grasshoppers, or other 
insects. Most of them like to hover about the flowers 
and drink the nectar. 

They dart about so quickly that it is not easy to 
catch them, and most people would think twice before 
taking hold of one, as only those who are careful 
observers know that these gay deceivers are not bees 
at all but just harmless flies. 





The Botfly 

The larvae of the flies are often beneficial to us from 
their habit of parasitizing other insects, some destroying 
plant lice, some ants, and some even clearing our gar- 
dens of snails ; but there is one fly whose larvaB have the 
most outrageous habits of any known insect. This is 
the botfly. 

There are several species of it, and one that closely 
resembles a honeybee lays its eggs on the legs of 
horses. 

The horses are afraid of it, as in some way they know 
it is an enemy. 

When the eggs are laid, the horse, > 
annoyed by them, licks them off and 
swallows them. 

This is what the botfly wants. 
When the eggs hatch the larvae fasten 
themselves to the coat of the horse's 
stomach until they are ready to become pupae, when 
they pass from the horse in the dung and crawl into 
some safe place to transform. 

They do not. make a cocoon, but remain in the pupal 
skin, which under such circumstances, you remember, is 
called a puparium. They do not need a cocoon and 
they have no silk with which to make one. 








There is another botfly that 
troubles cattle and is often called 
the ox warble. 

It lays its eggs on the legs or 
backs of cattle, when as before the animal licks them 
off. These larvaB do not want to get to the stomach, 
but burrow through the walls of the oesophagus and 
wander about through the animal's tissues for several 
months, finally taking up their abode on its back just 
under the skin. Here the larva becomes spiny, and 
boring a hole through the skin, remains with its breath- 
ing pores close to the orifice. When ready to become 
a pupa it bores its way out and drops to the ground, 

where it transforms within a puparium. 
The sheep botfly is another member of 

this disreputable family. It lays its eggs in 

the nostrils of sheep, and the larvae creep 

up into the head and horns. 

When full grown they come down again 

and fall to the ground, where they transform. 




The Bluebottle and Apple Flies 

The bluebottle fly that buzzes about so crazily when 
it gets caught in a room is the rascal ¡ª or one of the 
best known of the rascals ¡ª that lay their eggs on our 




meat and spoil it. It is a handsome little nuisance with 
its polished blue % ^^ body and its red 
eyes, but Madam x^^Hj^ Bluebottle, your 
deeds are not as fair ^Mj|^U2^ as your looks. 

The larva of the z' ^ Codlin moth is not 
the only apple eater we have. 

There is a fly whose larva bores tunnels all through 
the pulp of the apple. 

Salt-Water Flies 

Among the queerest of the fly folk are the salt- 
water flies. 

The larvaB of these live in the salt lakes of the West, 
and even in alkaline water in which nothing else 
can live. 

In eastern California is the very strange Lake Mono, 
whose water is nauseous to the taste and slippery to the 
touch. But this is the breeding place of such enormous 
numbers of certain salt-water flies that the larvae can 
be collected by bushels from the shores where they 
have drifted. There in olden time went the Indians, 
who collected these larvae, dried them in the sun, rubbed 
off the outer skin of the puparium, and used the rest 
for food. 


Fruit Flies 

We are all acquainted with the little fruit flies, 
those tiny things that swarm over ripe fruit late in the 
summer. We cannot leave a dish of grapes standing on 
the table but that these little thieves will find it. 

They eat the fruit, and they also lay their eggs on it. 

The larvae are also fond of canned fruit and even of 
pickles. They seem to enjoy life in a bath of brine or 
of vinegar, and unless we seal our cans perfectly they 
will be very apt to spoil the contents for us. 

So-called Ticks 

There are also parasitic flies that look like lice and 
that live on birds and other animals. These are called 
ticks, but they are not real ticks. The real ticks are not 
insects in the proper sense of the word. Our troublesome 
wood ticks are closely related to the spiders, and they, 
you know, are not insects. No, indeed, spiders are not true 
insects ; they have eight legs instead of six, and the adult 
has the head and thorax soldered together in one piece 
instead of being separate; there are also other differences. 

Yes, Charlie, the daddy longlegs, or grandfather gray- 
beard, as it is also called, has eight legs, and it is not an 
insect. 





Early Comers 

The fly folk are perhaps the earliest of all to appear 
in the spring. Which do you think would come first, a 
mosquito or a Monarch butterfly ? 

Ah, yes, John, you have thought about it. The mos- 
quito can find food at once. We often see mosquitoes 
and gnats around the early-blossoming willow flowers ; 
but the Monarch butterfly must wait until the milkweeds 
are up in order to lay its eggs on the leaves. 

Insects appear when the plant they feed upon or lay 
their eggs upon is ready for them. 




THE FLEA FOLK 

The prize jumpers are certainly the fleas. 
Grasshoppers and crickets do very well, 
but for real get-over-the-ground high jumping 
you must go to the flea. 

Oh, yes, it is a parasite and a troublesome 

one, yet we do not loathe it as we do other 

Fieamagnitied parasitcs that trouble us. It is such a hard, 

shiny little rascal, and it is so ridiculous in its frantic 

efforts to get away from us. 

It has paid the penalty of living on other animals 
and has lost almost everything but its jump. 

Its wings have gone, and its eyes are merely two 
ocelli. Its antennaB are small and short, but no doubt it 
can smell very well with them. 

From long slipping about between the hairs of animals 
the fleas have become modified, ¡ª an aid in that pleas- 
ing occupation. Their bodies are flat sideways, and they 
are shaped somewhat like flaxseeds standing on edge. 

They have strong, sharp mouth tubes, and their order 
has been named the Siphonaptera, from siphon^ a tube, 
and apteros, wingless. 





No, indeed, John ; they could not be named from their 
wings because they have none, so they are named from 
their lack of wings. 

You see, in the other orders we know, some of the 
members had wings ; not so the Flea Order. 

That ancient and honorable order is entirely wingless. 

The fleas are distinguished the world over by their 
lively manners. For their size they can outjump any 
other living thing, and this they accomplish by their 
very large and strong hind legs. 

Our domestic fleas lay their eggs on 
the hairs of dogs and cats, and these 
eggs, not being fastened in any way,-^ 
fall to the floor or the ground, where 
they hatch into little wormlike larvae Fiea magnified 

that feed on the decaying matter they find in the dust. 

In a week or two these larvae spin delicate cocoons 
and retire from the trials of life for a time. But they 
are not long inactive ; in three or four days they come 
out of their cocoons and find themselves possessed of all 
the powers of champion leapers. 

Cat and dog fleas readily turn their attention to us, 
though the owners of pet animals usually try to think 
they do not. 

A great many wild animals, including birds, are the 
unwilling victims of different species of fleas, and in 








some countries they are such a nuisance as to make 
living in those otherwise delightful places almost 
unbearable. 








The Ladybird 

Ladybird, ladybird, fly away home ; 

Your house is on fire and your children will burn. 

Thus sings little Nell to the ladybird, often also called 
ladybug, on her finger. And see ! it has flown away* ^:¡êj 

The ladybng is not a bug. '' "* "* 

May says you might know that from its name, 
because almost everything that is called a bug 
is n't a bug. 

Anyway, the ladybug is not a l3ng; it is a 
beetle, which is another matter entirely. 

Did you watch it spread its wings? 

Yes, Ned; they are four in number, and* 
like some other wings we know of, the upper pair are 
not used for flying. 

True, Charlie ; it is the upper wings of the grass- 
hoppers and of all the other Orthoptera that are modified 







to serve as wing covers, and it is so with the' pretty 
beetle folk. 

The upper wings are hard and small ; sometimes they 
are not large enough to cover the abdomen. They do not 
overlap on top like the wing covers of the Orthoptera, 
but they meet together in a straight line down the back. 

They are called elytra ; they used to be called shards, 
¡ª a word still used in poetry. Under the elytra he 
the inner wings, which are thin and large. These are 
sometimes a great deal longer than the elytra. 




The May Beetle 

Here is a May beetle whose wings 
we can spread out. 

Yes, Nellie ; the elytra are not 

used in flying. The beetle 

raises them up out of the 

way so that the inner 

wings will have ^ , 



room for their movements. "^ 
Now I am sure you wonder how 

these long wings can be tucked ^ 

away under the short elytra. 
Let us look at our friend May 

beetle again. We will slowly open 

one wing. There! now you see. 









The under wing has a sort of joint about halfway down 
so that it can be doubled in two. When thus doubled it 
can be easily folded down under the wing cover. 

_^ The May beetle sometimes has a deal of 

trouble tucking these under wings into 

place, and the ends of them stick out in 

a funny way after the elytra have been 

shut down. 

The inner wings of soi?ie of the 
?^beetles are very large, and they are 
^ "y folded and crumpled up in various ways to 
make them fit under the elytra. 

Here is one, a near relative to the 
May beetle, that saves itself .¡ª 
the trouble of opening its 
elytra when it flies. 

The elytra do not fit down tightly 
over the sides, so the clever little beetle just slips its 
wings out from under the closed elj^tra, and slips them 
back under when it is done using them. 

The Beetle Order is named from the elytra. The 
beetles are the sheath wings or Coleoptera, from coleos, 
a sheath, and pteron, a wing. 

You will not find the beetle folk sucking up their 
food, for their mouth parts are not modified into tubes. 
They have jaws with which they seize their prey. 





' 


I The larvse o¡ê the beetles are six-footed as a rule and 
^/Mk}'-t7r^T-=~-^^\ ^ a^e called grubs. 
-^^^^^^I ^M^lXk ^^ Y^"' ^^^^^^5 we often dig 
" ^ up big white ones when work- 

ing in the garden, and we find 
them in rotten wood and under 
i^^^^^;^:^^ ' J^ boards and stones. 
l^ S^"j The metamorphosis of the 

^^^^-Vl / beetles is complete. They 
;J L change from larvaa into motion- 
less pupae that are in some cases 
very funny little dolls indeed. 

The Number of Insects on Earth 

There are a great many beetles in the world, and we 
have more than eleven thousand species in oiu: country. 

It is difficult to say, John, which order of insects is 
the largest. 

You must remember that not all the insects in the 
world are yet known; there are thousands of species 
still unnamed, but the Beetle Order is a very large one, 
and so is the Diptera or Fly Order. Yes, May ; so is the 
Hemiptera or Bug Order, and the Lepidoptera or Butter- 
fly and Moth Order. 

The insects far outnumber all the rest of the animals 
in the world put together. 









And there 
are good reasons 
for this. The small 
size of the insects is in 
their favor, as is also 
their power of 
flight. 

John asks how 
their power to fly 
c:an help them. 
Being able to fly 
they can more easily escape 
their enemies, and they can also change their environment. 
What is their environment, Mabel wants to know. 
The environment of a creature is that which sur- 
rounds and influences it. 

We say it is suited to its environment when the 
temperature and moisture and food supply suit it and 
when there is freedom from enemies. 

A creature that is not suited to its environment can- 
not prosper and often cannot live. An aphis that 




happens to be bom in a fertile region in a warm dry 
season finds itself in a good environment unless a man 
comes along and deluges it with kerosene emulsion, 
when its environment is no longer good. 

Yes, we speak of environment with respect to people, 
and we do not consider a city slum a good environment 
for a child to grow up in. A clean, bright home with 
good influences is a fortunate environment for any 
child. 

When an insect finds its environment bad for it, 
when, for instance, the food supply fails, it can spread 
its wings and fly away to pastures new. 

The Ladybird again 

But how far we have wandered away from little 
Nell's ladybug ! Hers was red with black spots on it, 
but there are a good many species of these little friends 
of ours, and some are black or yellow with white or red 
or yellow spots. All of them have the power to give off 
a bad odor if we happen to disturb them. 

But we can easily excuse them for this when we 
remember what good friends they are on the whole. 
What do you suppose the larvaB of the ladybug live on ? 

As a rule they are predaceous, that is, they eat living 
creatures, and many of them revel in feasts of plant lice. 




Some destroy scale bugs and are exceedingly valuable 
to fruit growers. Do you know that < 
fomia is the proud possessor of a lady- 
bug purposely imported from \V 
Australia to destroy certain de- \^ 
structive scale insects, and it is \/ doing it tool 

The hop growers have a ladybug f / that they call 
'' nigger " because it is black, and they prize it above 
everything because it destroys the hop louse. 

The adults as well as the larvaB are predaceous, and 
we have reason enough for our kindly feelings towards 
the pretty ladybugs. 

When the ladybug larva is ready to become a pupa it 
attaches itself to something by its 
tail end, the larval skin splits down 
the back and discloses an odd- 
looking little pupa, though sometimes it stays within 
the larval skin to transform. 









The Tiger Beetle 

What beauty is this that 
crosses our path? 
See it shine ! A most brilliant 
green you are, lovely one, like 
y^J^/^^^i^ a livmg jewel. 

"No, no. Master John; you 
cannot catch me," he seems to say as he flits off just 
out of reach, and now he is waiting in the path again. 
But see, his head is turned this way. The tiger beetle 
does not mean to be taken by surprise. 

Yes, it is a tiger beetle; and you can always know it 
by its very quick motions and its sudden flight. It flies 
much better than the rest of the beetle folk, and it is a 
champion runner. 

Why is it called a tiger beetle ? If you knew it better, 
MoUie, you would not need to ask. You have not seen 
it pounce upon other insedis, for both 
the brilliant adult and the homely larva 
are fierce hunters. Moreover, the adults 
are often spotted and striped in quite 
a tigerish fashion. 

The larvaB live in burrows in the 
earth. Watch the little holes in the 
footpaths and see if you do not some 







day find a pair of tiny pincers at the opening 
of one. These pincers will very likely turn 
out to be the jaws of a tiger-beetle larva. 
There the little rascal waits, jaws wide open, 
all ready to close over any unfortunate 
insect that sets foot on this pitfall. 

No, these fellows are not as clever as the 
ant-lion larvaa; they do not build a funnel ' 

for the unwary to tumble into. 

The tiger-beetle larvaB are modified to live in their 
holes. They have a hump on the back and two stout 
hooks on the hump to hold them fast in case there comes 
a tug of war between themand some unwilling captive. 
Now see ! Mollie is the wise one to-day. She has 
been looking carefully at the path as we walked along 
and she thinks she has found the larva of a tiger beetle. 
Where is John with his trowel? But before we try 
to dig him out let us run a straw into the burrow so we 
won't lose the direction. 
Dig carefully, John. 
There, he has found it, and oh, how 
indignant it is! See, it has hold of 
the end of the straw ! It is biting it 
for all it is worth. 

There now, little larva, you need not 
get into such a temper. Nobody is going to hurt you. 












The Ground Beetle 

See that ground beetle ! It will soon 
make a meal of the caterpillar. 

Yes, the ground beetles generally live 

, on the ground under stones and sticks 

y and come prowling out after prey.- A 

.y good many of them prefer to come out 

at night. 

The larvaa live under stones, too, and 
^ / if we search we may find one. Yes, this 
]j / is one ; it is black, you see. 
But not all the larvae of the 
l^'iji- gi'o^iid beetles are black, 
^-^'-^ though they are all shaped a 
good deal like this one. See its little jaws ! 
/ Ravenous one, we know what you 
/ do with those jaws. 
\?( Many of the ground beetles are black in color 
'^^'i3 V^^ ^^^ y^^ often see them running when you 
lift up stones. 

But here is one that is not black. It is 

the Searcher, with its brilliant green wings. 

Ah, yes, you can guess why it is called 

the Searcher. These fellows that live in 

the grass and imder stones do not fly. They run when 







they have business on hand. Because they have not 
used their wings for so long a time, what do you think 
has happened? 

John guesses their wings may have disappeared. 

And so they have in many species. The wing covers 
are there, but if you were to lift them up you would 
find the inner wings mere rudiments. 

Because they would not fly when they could they 
cannot now fly at all; they must spend their lives in 
running about. 

Yes, indeed. May; it is so with all living things. If 
an organ is not used at all if becomes useless. If you 
were to tie up one of your arms, after a while it would 
get so weak you could not use it. The more an organ 
is rightly used the stronger it grows. If we look with 
our eyes and try to remember what we see, our eyes 
learn to see better and our minds to remember better. 

The only way to keep and to improve our powers is 
to use them. 

The ground beetles have lost their wings, but they 
have very fine strong legs because they have used them 
so much. 

You know how many beetles have the power to give 
off a bad odor. Well, our ground beetles are no excep- 
tion, and the little Bombardier, with its yellowish thorax 
and legs and its black or blue wing covers, is the chief 






performer in this respect. It gets its name from its 
habit of squirting an offensive fluid upon any one who 
disturbs it. This fluid, when coming in contact with 
the air, quickly vaporizes and looks like smoke. 

. This queer little gun is used 

j^ / '^'f / ^iisparingly upon any insect that 




-w>^^ 



presumes to attack the well-armed brigadier who thus 
bombards the enemy. 

Yes, Mollie; I am sure you have often seen these 
queer fellows. \ 

¡ö ' ? J/

.M^^'' 




The Water Beetle 

Not all the insects that dart about our ponds belong 
to the Bug Order. 

There are water beetles as well as water bugs. 







You can tell which are beetles and which are bugs by 
their mouth parts. The bugs, you know, suck up their 
food through a mouth tube, which they readily thrust 
into your finger tip if you give them the chance. The 
beetles have only jaws 'with which to nip inquisitive 
fingers. 

The predaceous diving beetles or Water Tigers are 
very common in still water, and Ned has a plan for our 
afternoon. 

We are to go with him to a pond not far off, where 
there are a great many of those fellows. 

Now here we are and here they are. See the polished 
dark brown beetles that are floating head downward 
near the surface of the water, 
a.s though from this po^^itiou 
ol" adviiiitage to keep an eye on 
'their neighbors down below and 
welcome any straggler into 
evei^ready stomach^s. 




The diving beetles have well-developed wings, and 
they fly from pond to pond in search of food. 

Yes, John; they change their environment to suit 
their needs. 

These corsairs are pleasanter to watch than to handle, 
for like so many of the beetle folk they protect them- 
selves by bad odors. 

If you touch one it gives off a disgusting milky fluid 
from the thorax just back of the head ; and not satisfied 
with this it will also pop at you a suffocating yellow 
liquid from two glands near the end of its tail. 

Why, yes, Charlie ; you can try it if you want to ; take 
the net and catch one. There, now you are satisfied. 
Yes, it is a horrible smelling little wretch when it 
wishes to be. 

Little Nell wants to know what those tiny black 
~^ _ things are that go darting about every- 



^Qi>_^^^^^TZ^'~~ where like comets in the water. 
: ¡ª ^^l'^i;S^ ,^^^ Mabel says they are the W 
-^[^^ pi^^ ¡ª .'' Yes, that is one name for them 



¡ª ? How shiny they are ! and how absurd 
in their gyrations ! 

They, too, are diving beetles, and when they go to 
the bottom they take a bubble of air. 

If we could put one under the magnifying glass we 
sliould see what strange legs it has. 








But here is a picture that will show us. 

The hind ones are greatly modified for 

swimming ; they are large and broad when 

we stretch them out. The joints are flat, 

the tarsal joints particularly 

being shaped almost like the j^^^ 

fins of a fish. This is why^^j 

^ they can flash about so quickly. -^ 

They are no pleasanter to handle than ^ 

the Water Tigers, for as soon as you touch ^ 

them they give out an ill-smelling milky z:r 

fluid from nearly every joint in their bodies. ^ 

The Whirligig lays its eggs on water plants, and the 
little larvae are predaceous. The adult Whirligigs can 
fly, and they can also squeak by rubbing the under side 
of the wing covers against the body. 

The diving beetles, or Water Tigers, 
are also able to squeak. 

The Great Water Beetles 

There are quite a number of aquatic 
beetles besides these we have been 
watching, and one of the most inter- 
esting is the large, black water scaven- 
ger, or great water beetle, that makes a 
silken cocoon in which to lay its eggs. 







It spins this cocoon from a spinneret at the tail end, 
much as a spider spins its web. It also has a sharp spine 
on its breast that pierces fingers that handle it carelessly. 

The full-grown larvae of these big fellows are black 
in color, and, of course, they are aquatic. 

Yes, Mabel ; aquatic means living in water. The 
creatures that live all the time in the water are aquatic. 

Yes, indeed, fish are aquatic. What larvae besides 
those of the beetles can you think of that are aquatic ? 

Yes, the dragon fly and May fly larvae, and the caddice 
larvae, and mosquito larvae, oh, there is a long list of them. 
But remember that aquatic animals must all breathe air. 



The Burying Beetles 







See what little Nell has found ! 

No, no, don't touch it, dear. 
The poor httle bird is 
dead, and now, see ! the 
/ \ , beetles are at work 
^J]^ burying it. 
^ Yes, May ; that is what 
1|T[I__ they are doing. You have often 
seen those queer-looking red 
spotted beetles about dead ani- 
mals, but you did not know what they were doing? 





Well, that is what they are doing, burying the little 
animals that die in the woods or the fields. 

They are called the burying beetles, or the sexton 
beetles. 

Y^s, indeed, John ; they will really and truly bury the 
little bird. You watch and see if they don't. 

Yes, Charlie ; they dig under the bird ; you can see 
one all gone but its tail. Their front legs are modified 
for digging ; see how broad and thick they are. 

Why, yes, John ; catch one if you want to, but let me 
:wam you that these Gravediggers do not smell like 
violets or roses. 

Ah, yes, one can now get a good look at you, old fel- 
low. See how short its wing covers are ; they -^^ 
do not nearly cover its abdomen. 

And what queer clublike antennae it has. ^_¡êE 

Poor fellow, he is so anxious to get back to _^ 
his grave digging, suppose we let him go. 

Indeed, Mabel, these are thorough little 
grave makers. 

They burrow under the animal until they 
have made an excavation into which it settles, and they 
keep on digging away until the hole is deep enough to 
receive it. Even then they do not stop, but actually 
sink it two or three inches below the surface of the 
ground. 






Then what do you think ? Those tireless little work- 
ers throw the dirt back into the hole until the animal is 
well covered. 

Why do they do this? Well, John, for the usual 
reason that these insects take an interest in decaying 
matter. Now can you guess ? 

That is right, my boy ; they want the bird as food for 
their larvaB.. When it is buried the female beetles dig 
down to it and deposit their eggs on it. 

The larvae are hard, flat, black things that smell 
¡ª my, how they do smell ! 

Why, yes, indeed, John ; you can mark the place 
where the little bird lies, and after a few days you 
can dig it up. 

See May hold her nose, but you know you don't 
have to come. May. 
Oh, you want to come ! Well, I thought so. 
These Gravediggers are interesting in spite of their 
bad odor, and they are wise little people too. 

If they find a dead animal small enough for them to 
handle, they are bound to have it, and if it is lying on 
ground too hard to dig into, these clever little people 
roll it to a softer spot. Sometimes they will move an 
animal several feet to a suitable burial place. 

It will take them about twenty-four hours to bury 
this little bird, but they will work much longer than that 




if necessary. Even if you were to fasten the bird with 
sticks or tie it with strings to the top of the ground, 
they would manage to get it loose and bury it. 

The Rove Beetle ^ 

Now this is a rove beetle. 

It is also anxious to have a share in the body of 
the bird, but it will not help to bury it. 

Yes, Ned ; its wings are ridiculous, they are so 
short, like a little jacket over the upper part of its 
abdomen. But let me tell you, the rove beetle can 
fly in spite of appearances. 

Its wings are long if its wing covers are short, and 
when it wishes to fly it spreads a pair of wings as long 
as its body, or even longer. 

The rove beetle sometimes has trouble in getting these 
long wings tucked away under the short elytra, and if 
you watch you may see it using its legs or the end of its 
abdomen to push them under. 

These beetles are usually quite small insects, though 
some species are large, as this one we have found. If 
you touch it, you will be treated to an odor that out- 
ranks even that of the Gravedigger, and often they 
raise up the tip of the abdomen as if they meant to 
sting. But they have no sting, ¡ª only the horrid scent 





glands, which are .almost as bad as a sting. Some of 
them are colored like a bumblebee, and dressed in bee- 
like hairs, with a form, too, like that of a bee. 

I think you are right, May ; when such a beetle raises 
the tip of the abdomen most creatures would think it 
was a. bee getting ready to sting, and thus we have a 
case of protective mimicry. 

The Carpet Beetle 

Poor Mollie ! So your are tired out helping your mother 
hunt for buffalo moths. 

You know how they look, then. Yes, and you know 
they are not moths at all ; you think they are some sort 
of larva. 

Grood, Mollie ! Your interest in insects is making 
you observe carefully and think well. 

You are right about the buffalo moth. It is not a 
moth at all, nor is it a bug. The tiny fat grub cov- 
ered with brown hairs is the larva of a beetle. The 
carpet beetle it is called. 

It is a nuisance where it finds its way into houses, 
the larva eating carpets, clothes, furs, and feathers. It 
is more troublesome even than the clothes moth. 

The adult carpet beetle is a pretty little black, white, 
and red thing that looks like a small ladybug. It feeds 
on pollen, but comes into the house to lay its eggs. 







The Click Beetle 

Ah, Charlie ! So you have caught a click 
beetle. 

The children often call it snapping bug 
and skipjack. 

Is he not a beauty with his dark gray 
wings and the two velvety spots on his thorax '^'^ 

What is that, Little Nell? You used to 
think those were his eyes, but now you know 
better? 

Yes, indeed ; none of us would mistake those spots for 
his eyes now. His little eyes are in front of his head, 
just back of the antennaB. 

The click beetle lays its eggs on the ground or on the 
bark of trees, and the larvaB of some species do a good 
deal of damage to the roots of grains 
other plants. 

You will be surprised 

w \'-x vv^i^y^yo^^ A>wc?vi4. y.wicx-y ^q know that the larva 

of the click beetle is the 
^long, hard, slender wire- 
worm we often dig up in 
the garden or see under the bark of decaying trees. You 
would not guess that this queer object was the larva of 
a beetle. 





Yes, John ; it is generally yellowish brown in color. 
It does a great deal of mischief in some places ; but the 
adult is harmless enough, and we are all well acquainted 
with it. 

Yes, indeed, MoUie ; we have all put the click beetles 
on their backs to see them spring into the air. As they 
spring they turn over and come down on their feet, or 
at least try to, for they don't always succeed. 

What is that, Nell ? If at first they don't succeed, 
they try, try again ? ^^ 

So they do, Nell; so 
they do. 

Now turn this fellow 
over and you wiU see how he 
turns his somersault. The thorax is provided with a 
spine that fits in a groove on the abdomen. 

When you turn the beetle on his back he bends him- 
self upwards, resting on his head 
and the tip of his abdomen. 
Then suddenly he straightens 
out; the spine strikes against the groove in the abdo- 
men and acts as a spring to toss him into the air. 

Yes, indeed; he will work this spring while we hold 
him, so that it is quite difficult to prevent his smooth 
body from snapping out from between our fingers. 
What a surprise we get the first time we touch one ! 







The scientific name of these fellows is el'a-ter, and 
elater comes from the same Greek word that " elastic " 
comes from. 

Yes, when we catch them they tuck their antennae 
close down against the under side of the thorax, so that 
they look as though they had none. 

I have no doubt you are right, Ned ; they do so to 
protect those delicate threads from being broken. 

Yes, little Nell ; they ^^play possum" when we take 
hold of them. They lie as though dead. 

We have a good many elaters in this country. Some 
of them are quite small and have no eye-spots on the 
thorax. 

There are elaters in Central and South America, also 
in Mexico and the West Indies, that shine in the dark. 

Here is a picture of one of them. 

The two spots on the thorax emit a bright 
light, as does also the end of the abdomen. 

Yes, John ; they are like our fireflies only they 
shine very much brighter. 

Some of the large ones make a light bright 
enough to read by, and the people use them 
when traveling at night. They are put to a pretty use 
by the ladies of the countries where they are found. 
The cucuyos, as they are called, are caught and kept 
in little cages of fine wire and fed on sugar cane. 





Now when milady is ready to go to a party she 
takes her little cucuyos, puts them in gauze bags, and 
fastens them in her hair or on her dress, where they 
shine, ¡ª Uving jewels to enhance her beauty. When she 
comes home again she carefully gives her 
Il\ shming little friends a bath to refresh them. 
'\^ They have to be bathed twice a day and 
f' carefully fed and cared for or they will 
f^^ die and their shining light go out. 
^^ Yes, they light up the dark 
woods at night like so many 
little lamps. It is said that 
travelers who have to be out 
at night fasten cucuyos to 
their boots, and when they 
are through using them they 
carefully return them to the 
bushes. 
Yes, May; it is a pity the larvaB 
re so destructive, as the elaters are 
such pretty and interesting little creatures. 









The Buprestids 

No, my boy, that is not an elater. 
It looks like one, but it has no spine 
to jump with, and it is much handsomer 
in color than the black or gray elaters. 
See, it shines like some bright metal, 
and it is of a bronze color. You 
always know these fellows by their color. 

They are the buprestids, and their larvse 
wood borers. 

They are queer larvaB that have no legs 
that seem to have a very big head. But tht 
head is really tiny, and it is the segments back 
of it that are enlarged. It is a mischievous 
little creature, for it bores under the bark 
of trees and into the solid wood. Some 
injure apple trees in this way, and some 
prefer forest trees. 








The Firefly 




Ah, yes, Mollie ! that little loose-winged thing 
is a firefly. 

It is not a fly, of course ; it is a beetle, but 
its elytra are quite soft, not like the usual hard 
wing covers of the beetle folk. 
You cannot see it shine in the daytime, but if you 
turn it over, you will see the tail end of its abdomen 
turn white every few moments ; and if you take it into 
a dark room, the last segments of the abdomen will 
shine out as though they were burning instead of 
seeming white. 

You cannot see its light in the daytime, because the 
brilliant sunlight overpowers its feeble little ray. But 
at night, which is the time it flies, its little lamps are 
seen shining all through the woods in the summer time. 
Yes, the little light givers love to fly over damp 
meadows, and sometimes the air seems to be spangled 
with tiny stars, there are so many of these little insects 
flashing all at once. 

Once in a while we see a soft greenish light shining 
steadily from some spot on the ground. This is a form of 
firefly not very common in our country ; it is called the 
glowworm. It is only the female that shines. She has 
no wings and is grublike in form. 




Yes, John ; we sometimes see a shining spot moving 
over the ground at night ; this is a firefly larva walking 
about, for the larvaB of our fireflies have the power to 
shine. 

Why, John, no doubt they shine as a signal to each 
other. It is their way of saying to their friends, " Here 
I am," and a pretty way it is too. 

Yes, indeed, we do love to see the fireflies on a dark 
night. 

Their larvae are dark-colored little fellows that, as a 
rule, live in the earth and eat snails and soft-bodied 
insects. 

Yes, indeed, they are harmless, and we are all glad 
that the child of the pretty firefly is not our enemy. 

No, little Nell ; the firefly cannot biun your fingers. 

We do not know how it makes its wonderful light. 

There are many beetles that look like the fireflies 
but that give no light. You all remember the long, 
narrow, black and yellow fellows that swarm over the 
golden-rods in the fall. They are soft like the fireflies, 
and are nearly related to them. 








The Stag Beetle 

So here we have Mr. Stag Beetle ! 
He is so named because of his jaws that 
in some species of the stag beetles are enor- 
mous and branched like the antlers of a stag. 

Digging into this 
rotten stump brings 
us to the larva of 
our stag beetle. See, 
it is a fat, white grub 
that lives on decayed 
wood. When ready 
to transform it makes 
for itself a nice little cocoon of 
the chips it has gnawed off. 

There are a great many stag beetles in the world, 
and some of them are remarkable looking creatures. 




i^M.y.hr- 











The Lamellicorn Beetle 

Now here goes a tumblebiig- 

Well met, little ball roller. Where 
do you suppose it is off to, 
May ? And why do you sup- 
pose it is so solemnly rolling 
that ball along ? 

Ah, tumblebug, tumble- 
bug ! we know your ways and why you are working so 
hard this summer day. 

How fast it trundles along ! 

True, John ; it does seem absurd to stand upside down 
and push a ball along behind one. But that is the 
tumbleb^g's way. 

See ! see ! Little Madam Tumblebug has climbed to 
the top of her ball and thrust out her little turtle head 
as far as she can to look about her. 

Why do I say little Madam Tumble- 
bug ? How do I know it is not little Mr, 
Tumblebug? 

Mr. Tumblebug would not take the 
trouble to roll a ball all by him- 
self. Often you will see him .^^ 
helping, though. And when he ^ -^i! 
is once at it he works with a will. 









Ah, yes ; over there is a pair of them rolling the ball 
together. The larger of the two is the female. 

True, Mollie ; his lordship does n't seem to help much. 
Half the time he is in the way, and now ¡ª the ras- 
cal ! ¡ª he is actually riding on the 
ball and letting his partner roll 
him along! 

There! he has tumbled 
off head over heels, and 
the ball has trundled off 
without him. Serves you 
right, sir. 
But see ! he is up and after it, 
and now he is doing his share. 
He walks ahead and pulls. 

Yes, indeed, little Nell; 
he still walks on , ^ '^^ 
his head. 

That is the way 
of the tumblebugs 
when they have a ball to roll. 

Now they have crossed the road and ¡ª is it possible 
they are going to try to climb up that bank ? 

There goes the ball ! Poor little fellows ! But they 
are after it. See them run. Now they have found it 
and rolled it back to the bank. 








There ! that naughty little male is on top of the ball 
again, and is making his partner lift him as well. 

But see ! he is not naughty ; he is wise. He has 
caught hold of the bank with his hind feet, and now 
he is pulling with all his might, while she pushes. 

See ! he is now on the top 
of the bank with his feet 
securely hooked in some 
weeds. She is almost stand- 
ing on her head and bal- 
ancing the ball, on the tip of 
her abdomen. 

Dear me! it is going to 
roll back again. No ; he has 
a better hold with his left 
foot. See him pull, and see " ¡ª ^^^ ' 

her push ! There ! hurrah ! it is up, and they are roll- 
ing it along as quietly as though they had done nothing 
uncommon. I should think they would want to stop 
and shake hands. 

Well done, little tumblebugs. You knew what you 
were about; and you, little gentleman, were wiser 
than we. 

It is not fair to judge a tumblebug by human standards. 

Yes, John; we should try to put ourselves in the 
tumblebug's shoes before we judge it. 






Indeed, May, you are right. We should never judge 
anybody without first understanding the matter from 
the other person's point of view. 

But where have our tumblebugs gone ? 

Ah, yes ; they have rolled their ball under that pile of 
dead leaves. See, they are burying it. 

Now you can guess what all this ball rolling is 
about. 

That i^ so, Mollie ; the female wishes to lay her eggs 
in the ball, and when it is buried she will do so. 

Sometimes the ball is made of rich earth, but gener- 
ally it is made of cow dung or of horse manure. 

These black tumblebugs are nearly always to be 
found in cow pastures. 

They fly well, and go whizzing over the ground until 
they find what they want. 

John has caught a tumblebug for us to look at. Ah ! 
it has a good strong means of defense. But we are 
going to look at you, sir, in spite of the dreadful odor 
you give forth to prevent us. 

Right, May ; it is not a bug at all ; it is a beetle. 

It is a scavenger, clearing up the dirt of the pastures ; 
it is a lamellicom scavenger. 

There are numbers of lamellicom beetles, and the 
family gets its name lamellicom from the shape of the 
antennae. 




You see they are like clubs at the end, and the clubs 
are made of the last segments of the antennae, which 
are flattened and enlarged like plates. 

LamelUcorn comes from two Latin words meaning 
plate and horn, so they are plate horns, or plate 
antennae, and the beetles that bear such antennae are 
called lamellicorn beetles. 

Here is a picture of the antennae enlarged. 
Yes, indeed ; such antennae afford room for a great 
many sense organs, and the tumblebugs can smell 
exceedingly well. The adults eat decaying animal 
and vegetable matter, as do also the larvae. 

Why do you suppose the tumblebugs roll a 
ball of food material off by itself and biu-y it? 
Why do they not lay the eggs right in the manure ? 

They are wise little people. They know that many 
voracious larvae live in dung, and that these would 
devour their eggs or larvae; for other insects besides 
tumblebugs use maniu-e for food. So 
they cut out a ball from the general 
supply and roll it to a safe place. 
Here is one making 
ball. See, the ball is 
p^.r^ nearly separated from 
y j^i^^ VT^Ti ^ r" , the rest of the manure. 
"^ ' '-=^;^ ¡ª ^^ - Watch and see how it uses 







its little flat, sharp-edged head for a spade. Now its 
head is quite out of sight under the wall. See it pat 
the ball with its little hands. 

It digs and pats until the ball is quite firm and round 
before it tries to roll it. 

Here is a picture of the front foot enlarged. 

You see the tarsus is very small ; it is often turned 
under out of the way. 

The tibia is flat and broad. Yes, Charlie ; it is modi- 
fied to form a good tool for patting and digging. 

No, May ; not all the turablebugs are black. Some are 
very beautiful in color, and shine like polished metal. 

Yes, you have aU seen the shining green or bronze- 
colored tumblebugs, but they are not as common as 
these black fellows. 

No, Nell, we do not need to ask why they are called 
tumblebugs. It is enough to see them tumbling around 
on the ground. Very often their ball rolls away with 
them, and over and over they go, clinging to it as well 
as they can. 

Moreover, tumblebugs are great fighters. Sometimes 
one will come along and try to take the ball from 
another instead of making one for herself. When this 
happens there is trouble. The one attacked starts off with 
her ball ; the would-be robber grasps it and tries to roll 
it in another direction. Then comes a tug of war, or 





rather a tumble of war, in which one finally succeeds in 
rolling the ball away from the other. The other at once 
gives chase and the pulling and tumbling about begin 
all over again. Sometimes both leave the ball and grap- 
ple with each other. After wrestling awhile one con- 
quers the other and goes back to the ball, but the enemy 
was not really conquered and in a moment is racing 
after the receding ball. How the trouble is finally settled 
I have never been able to find out. 

The sacred scarab of Egypt is a_^^ 
tumblebug. 

It is larger and more ornamental 
than our tumblebugs, but it provides 
for its young in the same way. 

Here is a picture of the Egyptian -^~ 
scarab. 

It was held sacred by the ancient 
Egyptians because of its habit of roll- 
ing a ball of earth which to them was symbolical of the 
world. Connected with this beetle there were a great 
many superstitions which you may some time read about. 

It was carved in stone and in jewels and put in the 
tombs of the dead, and it is also seen carved on pillars 
and in temples. The Egyptian stone scarab is often 
seen in museums. It is flat on the under side, which is 
marked with hieroglyphics. 








Here is a picture showing the upper and the 
under sides of a scarab. 

There are other lamellicorn scavengers besides 
the tumblebugs in our pastures. 

One of them is a big black fellow with a horn 
on its thorax, but it does not roll a ball. It digs 
a deep tunnel under the manure and carries the 
manure down to a hollow place at the bottom 
of the tunnel. Here the eggs are laid. Probably it fills 
up the tunnel, but I cannot say 
certainly about that. 

Yes, John ; our May beetles, or 
June bugs, as they are also called, 
are lamellicorn beetles, but they 
are not scavengers. 

Their antennaB are like those of 
the tumblebugs, but their larvaB, 
which are rather large white 
grubs, live in the earth and eat the roots of grasses and 
other plants. They sometimes do a very great deal of 
damage. The adult May beetles eat foliage and often 
injure young trees. 

The goldsmith beetle is very much like the May beetle, 
only it is yellow, and the head and thorax shine as 
though they had been polished. They are blundering 
fellows like the May beetles and often come whizzing 








into the room at night, striking against the lamp, 
thumping on the wall, getting tangled in our hair^ and 
finally tumbling on their backs in the comer. 

Yes, little Nell; we hear their funny little feet scratch, 
scratch, scratching in their efforts to turn over'. And 
then what do we say ? " Oh ! never mind; it's nothing . 
but a clumsy old May beetle." 



The Long-Horned Beetles 




Z-^-^-ZrZ-^'OOO-Z-^rZ-OOO ! 

Who is this humming low as he flies over the lawn? 
Ah ! the big, black Prionus. 
Rascal, what are you doing there ? 








What, John, ¡ª it digs holes in the lawn? 
Yes, it lays its eggs on the roots of the 
trees into which the larvae bore. 

This is one of the Long-homed beetles. 
See how spiny is the thin edge of its 
thorax. 

Yes, MoUie ; its legs are strong and large, 

and it is a great digger and a strong runner. 

The larvae of the Long-homed beetles are 

soft, whitish grubs, but they have very hard 

and powerful little jaws. 

Most of the Long-horned beetles lay their 
eggs on the limbs or tmnks of trees and 
the larvaB bore into the solid wood, 
where they are very destructive. 
Here is one of the Long-homed 
beetles that often come flying 
into a lighted room at night. He 
is quite a beauty with his straight, 
tan-colored wings. Yes ; he has 
three little sharp spines like 
needle points on each side of the ^ 
thorax. 

Yes, May; some of the Long- 
homed beetles are very beauti- 
ful indeed. 






Ah, see ! May has one of these beauties for " ^^ 
us to look at. 

It is the beautiful maple borer, and gay it 
is, with its black dress marked with yellow. 
It is too bad that our beauty should lay its ^ 
eggs on the sugar maples that the larvaB may 
bore into the trees. 

Another beauty belonging to this family is 
the Cloaked Knotty-horn. 

Here is one that Mabel found the 
other day and kept to show us. 

Yes, little Nell ; it wears a yellow 

i^ cloak over its shining blue dress. The 

upper part. of the blue elytra, you see, 

is bright yellow. And no wonder it is 

called Knotty-horn ! 

Yes, Mabel; its antennae are 
composed of large, 
triangular segments, which is the 
case with the antennae in a number 
of the members of this family. 

Perhaps for the longest-horned of the Long-horns 
we should go to the sawyer. This beautiful gray 
and brown nuisance lays its eggs on pine and fir trees 
and the larvae bore into the solid wood, sometimes 
there being enough of them to kill the tree. 








The sawyers are funny little people and they wave 
their long antennae about in quite a captivating manner. 

A near relative to this sawyer is the round-headed 
apple-tree borer, ¡ª a pale brown beetle, smaller than the 




sawyer, and with two white stripes running down its 
back from head to tail. It is one of the worst enemies 
our apple trees have, as the larva lives nearly three years 
and spends its time boring through the wood of the tree. 
There are a great many Long-homed beetles. 







The Colorado Potato Beetle 

Charlie says he has had enough 
of beetles. 

He has had to help "bug" his ^^i^Vi 
father's potatoes. 

Fortunately the potato bug, or 
Colorado potato beetle, as it is bet- 
ter called, is not as abundant as 
it used to be ; but it is still all 
too common. 

Oh, yes ! we all know how \ 
the little nuisance looks, with V, 
its striped back. And we know 
how its disagreeable reddish- 
yellow grubs look. 

We have all seen them in the potato fields. 

Had you lived before the year 1859 you would not 
have been troubled by the potato beetle. 

It then lived near the foot of the Rocky Mountains, 
feeding on the sand spur, a plant belonging to the 
potato family. But when the white settlers began to 
plant potatoes in Colorado, their foliage tasted so much 
better than sand-spur leaves to the discriminating bee- 
tles that they left their sand spurs and swarmed over 
the potatoes. 






Gradually they found their way eastward from potato 
patch to potato patch, until in about fifteen years they 
had conquered the country to the Atlantic Ocean. 

They lay their eggs on the potato leaves, which are 
devoured by the voracious larvaB. Some of the bee- 
tles remain underground in the pupal state all winter, 
the adult beetles emerging in the summer at the right 
time to lay their eggs on the young potato plants. 

True enough, John ; the potato beetle prospered 
greatly by changing its environment. 

The sand spurs at the foot of the Rocky Mountains 
supported but a small colony of beetles compared to the 
hordes that now devastate the country. 

Yes, Nell ; potato leaves were better food than sand 
spurs, and no doubt the beetles enjoyed the milder climate 
of the East. Anyway they multiplied prodigiously, two 
or three broods appearing in one season. 



The Oil Beetle 

May, why do you look so mischievous, and 

what are you holding so carefully in that box ? 

Oh ! an insect, a beautiful blue insect. Be 

\ careful how we open the box or it will kill us. 

Dear me ! has it such a tremendous sting, 

then? 






No sting at all. 

Then how can it kill us ? 

Open the box and we shall see. 

Phew! WeU, weU! 

You have been teasing it, May, and it does smell bad 
enough to make us want to drop it and run away. 

It is a beetle, in spite of the fact that its elytra over- 
lap. How short the elytra are ! 

Yes, Nell ; they do look like an old-fashioned over- 
skirt such as you were looking at in an old magazine of 
your mother's this morning. 

This queer, dark blue little scent bottle gets its strong 
odor from a yellow liquid that oozes out of its joints 
when disturbed, and because of this yellow, oily liquid it 
is sometimes called the oil beetle. 

It is not a pleasant beetle by any means, and you 
may be sure the birds let it severely alone, although 
it is so soft and juicy. 

Now I will tell you something odd about it. It is a 
blister beetle. Blister plasters are very often made of 
beetles. These plasters blister the skin and are used 
in sickness. The plasters are often called Spanish-fly 
blisters, because they used to be made from Spanish 
beetles that were easily collected. 

The beetles are dried and powdered, and then mixed 
with an ointment and spread on cloth. 






^^-¡ª- 



Those who collect the beetles as well as those who 
powder them have to be very careful or they will get 
their hands blistered. ? 
Yes ; I think that if you handled May's 
blue beetle much it would probably 
blister your hands. 

These fellows are quite often found 
on buttercups. 

The larvae of the blister beetles have 
a curious way of getting their living. 
The eggs are sometimes laid in 
flowers and the larvae watch for 
the coming of a bee to which they 
can attach themselves. They suck 
j the blood of the bee and when it flies 
home they leave it and eat its honey and its larvae. 

Not all the blister beetles are shaped like our blue oil 
beetle, but they all have soft elytra. Here is a picture 
of three of them. 




The Weevils 

What is that, John? There is no use going chest- 
nutting this year, the nuts are so wormy? 

Then at least let us gain something from the 
worms. 

What do you think they are ? 








Ah, I see ; you believe they are the larvae of some- 
thing. Yes, the little fat, white grubs that eat the 
chestnuts before you get a chance to are larvae, and 
I think that most of them belong to the weevils. 

The weevils are great nut eaters and we find the 
grubs also in acorns. 

The weevils are the snout beetles, and for the most 
part they are little fellows. 

The head is prolonged in front into a long beak or 
snout, and at first you might mistake them for bugs. 
But the long, slender snout is not a tube. At the tip 
end of it are tiny jaws, which though so small are yet 
very hard and strong, enabling the beetle to bore through 
nut shells. 

It is rather a pretty little gray or brown nuisance and 
its antennae, as you see, are bent at a sharp angle and 
are fastened halfway down the snout. 







Some weevils are able to bore into the hard 
hickory nut and some injure grain and 
seeds. Some again eat fruit, and 
one is very destructive to the 
plum, sometimes quite destroy- 
ing the whole crop. The beetle 
lays her eggs in the 
^^^^ fruit and the larvae eat 
^^^^ it. The rascals we find 
wormy cherries are usually weevil 
grubs. 
The weevils have cunning little pads on their feet, 
and what do you suppose they use their 
long snouts for ? 

Yes ; they bore into nuts, fruits, and 
grain with them. 

They bore a hole with the snout, then 
they lay an egg in the hole and poke it 
down with the snout. 











Lady Bombus 

Now who comes droning over the flowers ? 

See! she has settled on a clover head 
and is burying her face in it. 

Everybody knows our friend Bumble- 
bee. And I think we all like her lady- 
ship and love to see her hovering 
about the flowers and digging her 
shining black face down into them. 

Yes, John ; she is after the 
honey. She is a fine bee and we \ 
will call her Lady Bombus, be- 
cause Bombus is the name of the 
genus to which she belongs. 

No ; it will do no harm to catch 
her, if you can. 

See ! John has put a tumbler i , m 
over her and slipped a postal card 
under the tumbler so that she can- 
not escape. What a buzzing ! How angry my lady is ! 


MoUie says she" has caught bumblebees in pumpkin 
blossoms to hear them sing. When you see one in the 
bottom of the flower you just double the petals over the 
top ¡ª and there you have your prisoner. 

Yes, they do sing, but not as we do; their song 
comes from their spiracles where their vocal organs 
are located. 

You see they breathe at the spiracles, so it is quite 
natural they should sing there too ; but they also sing ¡ª 
or buzz ¡ª by vibrating the upper part of the body and 
the upper parts of the wings. If you touch the thorax 
of one of these singing bees, you will/(2eZ the song as 
well as hear it. 

Yes, May ; it can be felt very distinctly through the 
delicate petals of our pumpkin flower, which vibrate so 
rapidly as to tickle our fingers sometimes. 

May says an angry bumblebee emits a bad odor. So 
it does, as you can easily discover from our captive here 
in the tumbler. It is a strange odor the angry bee 
gives forth, a little like honey and a good deal like 
bee poison. 

Poor frightened little bee ! Now she has settled down 
on the clover head that John squeezed in through a 
crack between the card and the rim of the tumbler. 

She seems to have forgotten her excitement as she 
explores the treasures of the clover. 





Her Wings 

Just notice her wings folded over her back. 

Yes ; her back is broader than her wings, 
which do look small for such a heavy body. 

They are large enough, however, to enable 
her to dart about with great rapidity, and fly 
very swiftly indeed when she makes a " bee 
line" for home. It is because she can move 
her wings so quickly that she can fly so well. 

Yes, Mollie; we get the expression "bee line" from 
.. the bees, because they take the most 
£¤- direct route home when they have a 







bee's back ? If you were to go home with Lady Bombus 
you could guess. 

John says he has been to her home, which is in a hol- 
low under ground. She has to crawl down between the 
grass blades and through a little hole in the ground ; and 
when she finally reaches her nest she still needs narrow 
wings in order to move about in the restricted space. 

We have here a dead bumblebee that was found in the 

house the other day, so we can easily examine its wings. 

There are four, you see, and they are all used in flying. 

The outer ones are larger and the inner 

^>ones slip under them, out of the way, 

when the wings are folded. 

These brown wings are thin and gauzy, 
though not nearly so delicate as the wings 
of the honeybee. 
It is the gauzy wings that give the name to the Bee 
Order, ¡ª membrane-wings, or Hymenoptera. 

No ; you cannot always see four wings on a bee. The 
reason is that these champion flyers have a way of hook- 
ing together the two wings on each side, 
thus making one strong wing. ""^^^^^^^N^ 

Yes, indeed. May ; they do really hook ^^-^ 
the wings together. You can see the hooks with the 
little magnifying glass. There is a row of them on 
the upper edge of the under wing. 






Now look on the lower edge of the upper wing and 
you will find a sort of fold or groove into which these 
hooks catch. 

You can quite easily hook the wings together, and 
when you have done so ¡ª see, John has done it ! ¡ª you 
would have to look carefully indeed to discover that 
there were two wings. 

All bees, so far as I know, have these wing fasteners. 

What an old fuzzy coat our bumblebee is ! Jacket of 
yellow fur and abdomen clad in bands of black \s 
and yellow fur ! 

What is that, May ? She may be pretty, but 
she certainly is not good-natured ? 

Ah, May ! you surely do not judge her fairly. 

Of course she will sting you if you pick her up in 
your fingers. But who can blame her for that ? She is 
only defending herself from what she thinks is an enor- 
mous and terrible enemy. 

If you do not frighten her, she is the gentlest of insects 
and never stings unless you threaten her nest or herself. 

Honey and Beebread 

Now just see what we can do with her. All bees are 
very fond of honey and will leave any other sweet for 
it. Knowing we were to look at bees to-day, Mollie 







brought a little bottle of honey, 
'and now we will put a drop of 
it on my finger. 

What, Nell, ¡ª you want it on 
your finger ? 
Are you sure you will not be afraid when 
^ the bee crawls on your finger to get it? 
No, you are not afraid of old Fuzzy Bumbles? 
Well, then, stick the end of your finger in the honey. 
Now raise the tumbler a little bit and put the tip of your 
finger in. 

Ah, how quickly those sensitive antennae know that 
honey is near ! Lady Bombus is already tapping Nell's 
finger with her feelers. 

Yes, Ned ; the antennae are bent at a sharp angle in 
the middle; that is one way by which we know the 
bees, ¡ª they all have these bent antennae. 

Ah ! now Lady Bombus has clasped her two front feet 
about Nell's finger while she sucks up the honey. 

Raise the tumbler very gently, John ; now remove it 
altogether. See ! she does not move away. Now Nell, 
slowly raise your finger. Don't be afraid ; it will never 
enter her good little heart to sting you. 

There ! she has clasped two more feet about Nell's fin- 
ger. Now she has let go of the card altogether and is 
clinging to the little girl's finger eating the honey. 






While she is thus busy let us take a good look at 
those yellow balls on her hind legs. 

Do you know what they are made of ? John says he 
has part of one that fell off when she was so excitedly 
buzzing about in the tumbler after he first caught her. 

It is soft, you see, and pastelike, something like stiff 
cake dough. 

It smells like honey and has a sweetish taste. 

Yes, it is beebread ; and our little lady here is taking 
it home to the nest to feed the young bees. 

John says it is made of pollen gathered from the 
flowers and mixed with nectar to make it stick together. 







Pollen Baskets 




Charlie thinks that is a funny place to carry it. 

Perhaps it is a, very good place when you come to 
think of it. 

You see it is on the outside of the hind legs, where it 
is as much out of the way as it very well can be. 

There is something peculiar about the hind l^s of 
bumblebees. They 'are modified to form baskets in 
which to carry pollen. 
^^^^ Look at this picture of a bee's leg magnified. 

The femur, you see, is very broad, and is hol- 
lowed on the outside, the hollow being bordered 
by stiff hairs. You can see this little basket 
quite plainly on our dead bee. 

Yes, indeed ; this arrangement exists on purpose that 
the bee may carry home her pollen. 

Have you ever watched a bumblebee collecting pollen ? 

She wallows about over the pollen-covered flower, 
working with her hairy legs and getting her hairy body 
all dusted over with the little pollen grains that stick 
to the hairs. Then she rubs her hind legs, which are 
covered on the tibias with little stiff and hairy combs, 
over her body and collects the pollen, which she finally 
scrapes from one leg into the basket of the other. 

We must watch her do it this very day. 






Combs and Brushes 




Yes, you are quite right, 
Ned; those other spines and 
brushes on the leg are to keep 
our pretty friend clean. She is constantly cleaning her 
face, and her body, and her gauzy wings with her legs. 

Yes ; she carries her combs and brushes on her legs. 

May says she is doubling up her fore leg and drawing 
it over her antenna. Yes, that is in order that she may 
clean the antenna. 

Perhaps you do not know that she has a round comb 
on the upper end of her tibia. Well, she has, right at 
the joint. And there is a hard little scraper hanging 
down from the lower end of the femur. 

When she draws her leg over the antenna, the an- 
tenna slips into the round comb; then she shuts the 
scraper down on it, and as she pulls the antenna 
through every particle of dust is cleaned off. 

Clever? Well, I should think so ! 

If you examine this picture, perhaps you can see how 
it is done. And if you examine the bee's leg with a ^^ 
magnifying glass, you will see yet better. ^"^^/^ 

Yes, all bees have these cleaners for their /Jx I 

antennae, ¡ª one on each fore leg. While ^/"^ ^.^^-"'^^ 
we have been talking about the antennae ^ 






cleaners our bee has flown away. No doubt she has 
gone home with her load of honey. 

What good will the honey do those at home when 
she has eaten it herself, May wants to know. 

Well, the truth is, May, she has n't eaten it. She has 
only swallowed it, and when she likes she can pump it 
up again and put it into the places provided for it in 
her nest. 

The Honey Sac 

She has a little sac in her body on purpose to hold 
nectar from the flowers while she is carrying it home. 
It is a tiny sac as clear as a bubble and holds only a 
small drop. 

No, May; nectar is not just the same as honey. The 
bees collect the sweet nectar from the flowers and in 
some way convert it into honey. If you were to gather 
nectar, you could not change it into honey, but the bees 
are able to do so. 

Yes, they sometimes swallow pollen, too, and this 
goes into the honey sac with the nectar ; but there is a 
tiny strainer in this remarkable honey sac, by means of 
which the pollen is all strained out, and only the clear, 
pure honey left to go into the honeycomb. 

What, Nell ¡ª your bee has comeback ? She cannot live 
far away, and she wants the rest of that drop of honey. 







See ! she goes straight to Nell's finger. Now 
she has settled on it and is finishing the drop 
which, fortunately, Nell had not wiped off. 



W^l_y <^:2 ___^? ^ ^^^^^^^^^3^ 









The Tongue 

Watch her little black tongue go in and out. 

How fast she licks it up ! 

She lets down a sort of stiff tube first, and out of /\ 
the lower end of it comes wriggling a soft little 
tongue. 

That tongue is so important. Lady Bombus, that 
we shall have to consider it. See ! here is a picture 
of it magnified. You see the hairy little tongue 
coming down below the sheath. 







Well, that sheath is not so simple as it looks. 
Here is another picture showing how it can be 

separated into four parts. 

The four stiff parts lie olose together, forming 

the tube in which the long tongue lies. 

Yes, John; she has good strong little jaws; but 

these you can see better when her tongue sheath 

is folded back under her head, which is where she 
carries it when it is not in use. 

Here is a picture showing the jaws open. The jaws 
are very useful to some bees, ¡ª more useful ,,''"x 
to some others than to the bimiblebees. /i ti 

All insects have these mouth parts, only|>r^*^ 
they are shaped differently in different species, i x^""""^ 

They are quite distinct in the grasshopper, ^ 
and quite short. You can see them move when the 
grasshopper eats. 

In some insects the mouth parts are all separate and 
of about the same size. 

Yes, John ; it is so in the grasshoppers. 

In some insects a portion of the mouth parts are very- 
large, while other parts are very small. In some the 
mouth parts grow together to form tubes, as you know. 

In our bees the mouth parts form tubes without grow- . 
ing together. 

We must now look at your home, little bee. 





The Nest 



How can we do this ? Why, a man was plowing near 
here yesterday, and he plowed up a biunblebees' nest. 

Yes, indeed; there loas a time! The man ran, and 
the horses ran, and everybody was very much excited 
for a little while. One of the horses was stung twice, 
and the man who had his hat off fighting the bees that 
were buzzing around him had a jab from a stinger on 
the top of his head. 

You could not blame the bees for trying to defend 
their home. 

Sometimes boys dig up bumblebees' nests for the sake 
of the honey there. 

What, May, ¡ª you should think they would be pretty- 
looking objects ? 

Oh! they run when the bees get after them, and 
fight them off with their caps. And if they do get 
stung, why that is nothing compared to the fun of 
taking the nest, ¡ª so they think. 

But to return to our plowed-up bumblebees' nest. 

Towards night, when the bees had quieted down, some 
of us went out and picked up the nest and put it in a 
box, and there it is, ready to be looked at. 

No ; I hardly think the bees that are in the box will 
sting us. There are only a few old ones left, and they 







do not seem at all ugly. They seem to understand 
there is no lifee fighting any more. 

See ! here is the nest. Yes ; it does look like a giant 



honeycomb, 
it, though* 




Toil would hardly care to eat 
It i^ not made of wax. 

In order to under- 
stand just how it 
was made, we shall 
, have to go back 
to last spring, 
when this nest 
was first started. There was only one bee to start it, ¡ª 
one large queen bee. 

Yes, Nell ; we can call her Queen Bombus. 
She had been lying all winter hidden away in some 
safe comer, and as soon as spring came out she crawled 
and flew about to find, a place to make her home. 

Finally she selected a little hole she found in the 
ground in the meadow. 

Perhaps the hole once held a mouse's nest. 
But it was vacant then, and Queen Bombus by 
carrying out bits of earth soon enlarged it until it 
suited her. 

Then she flew to the flowers and gathered balls of 
pollen on her hind legs. She hurried home with load 
after load of pollen, until she had quite a lump of it. 




In this pollen she laid a few eggs, and from these there 
soon hatched ¡ª what do you think? 

John thinks some sort of larva hatched out. 



Young Bees 

Yes, John ; out of the eggs hatched little white, leg- 
less things more helpless even than a maggot, for they 
could not even skip about. 

They stayed quietly in the mass of pollen, which, of 
course, they ate ; and of course they grew and grew fast. 
By the time they had eaten quite a little den about 
themselves they were ready to become pupae. When 
this happened they began to spin silk from their 
mouths, as the caterpillars do, and soon each larva had 
made a silken cocoon about itself. It is the silken 
cocoons that we have here in the box. These cells that 
look like honeycomb are made of silk instead of wax, 
and they hold young bees instead of honey. 

As soon as the bee larva has spun its cocoon it trans- 
forms into a pupa and lies quite still for a few days. 

Then you know what happens next. Yes ; it trans- 
forms into a perfect winged bee, bites its way out, 
and begins the work of living in the outer world. 

Here is one of the young bees just coming 
out. It is a little fellow and ¡ª yes, it has white 





hair. But its fuzz will turn yellow in a day or two. 
Young bees start out in life very pale and dainty little 
things. 

This is a worker bee, and they are never as large as 
the queens. 

Workers 

When the queen bee starts her nest she lays only a 
few eggs at first. These hatch into workers. As soon 
as the workers are strong enough, they go out in search 
of honey and pollen. 

But they do not desert their home and start one of 
their own. No, indeed; these faithful little workers fly 
to the old nest with their booty and help the queen 
mother, who now stays at home andjeaves all the food 
gathering to the workers. 

The pollen comes in fast now, with so many to bring 
it, the queen lays many eggs, and young bees ¡ª always 
workers ¡ª begin to appear in large numbers. 

The worker bee is a small female, but it lays no eggs 
as a rule. It is the nurse and the housekeeper, taking 
care of the nest and carrying home the food. 

Because the bees live together in this way in com- 
munities, all working together for the common good, 
we call them " social " insects. If one were separated 
from the rest it would soon die. 






Yes, May; the reason we see only small bumblebees 
in the middle of the summer is because the big queens 
are staying at home. 

Oh, yes ; the little bees can sting, but they do not go 
about looking for trouble. They never sting unless 
they are very much excited. But if you disturb their 
nest you may be sure they will punish you to the best 
of their ability. 

Sometimes the workers fill the empty cocoons with 
honey. Their honey is rather strong in flavor, but 
children like to eat it. Bears like it, too, and in spite 






of the frantic stings of the luckless workers Bruin will 
rip open a bees' nest, if he can find it, and eat up every- 
thing there. 

Sometimes there is quite a good deal of wax found in 
a bumblebees' nest, and then again there will be none at 
all. It is the honeybees that are so skillful in wax making. 

Queens and Drones 

Mollie wants to know where the queen bee comes 
from, ¡ª if only workers hatch out of the eggs. 

Well, late in the summer a few of the larvae turn into 
big queens. Others of the larvae turn into king bees ; these 
are also large, though not quite so large as the queens. 
What is that. May, ¡ª you never heard of a king bee ? 
Oh, yes, you have, only you called it by another name. 
We usually call the king bees drones. 
Only the male bee is a drone. 

Yes, May ; he is always scolded for being 
lazy, but that is not fair. 
He has no honey sac and no pollen baskets, 
so he cannot help provision the hive. 

He is the big, square-bodied bee with long 
antennae that we often see sitting on the flowers 
in the fall. You can easily tell him by his long, 
drooping feelers and his large wings. 






If you watch the bumblebees on the flowers in the 
fall, you will soon be quite sure which are the drones. 
And when you are sure, you can safely put your hand 
over one and pick him up. 

He will laake a great buzzing, but he will not sting. 

Ned says he saw a boy once who had his hand full 
of big bumblebees that did not sting him. No 
doubt, Ned, they were droneSj aod you could 
have handled them as well as he. 

The drone is perfectly harmless, and 
reason is that he has no sting. 

The sting of the bee is its ovipositor, aud 
females, therefore, have stings. 

May wants to know ^^^^ 
what would happen if ^^ '^^^''^ ^ \^^^ 
you should take up a ^|>^^i^ ^,K/ 
bee, thinking it was a \^ 

drone, and it should turn out to 
be a queen. / 

In that case you might pay 
the penalty of yoin: mistake, 
though the queens do 
not like to stiug. 

After all,- a bee sting 
isn't so terrible, and there is not 
much danger of making a mistake 







if you are careful. The long, drooping antennaB and the 
square end to the abdomen, set with rather stiff hairs, 
readily distinguish the drone. 

Ned asks if it is true that the bumblebees turn the 
drones out to perish in the fall of the year. 
- No, Ned ; that is not true of the bumblebees. 

When fall comes all the bumblebees excepting the 
young queens die. These hide away until the next 
season, when they come out and each one starts a nest 
for herself. 

We see them in the spring, flying about, poking into 
every rubbish pile, and examining carefully the side- 
walks and the fields ; for they build their nests in any 
convenient and sheltered spot, and what farmer has 
not had a bumblebees' nest in one of his 
sheds where things were thrown down in 
a less orderly manner than they might 
have been? 

The bees will take possession and will 
H, heartily sting anybody who interferes. 

The Sting 

The queens do not like to sting. You see, the sting 
sometimes sticks fast and cannot be pulled out again. 
When this happens the frightened bee jerks loose, 






leaving her sting in the wound. This is a fatal accident, 
and the bee soon dies as a result of it. 

This happens less frequently to the large, strong 
bumblebees than to the smaller honeybees. Indeed, 
a honeybee almost always loses its sting when it jabs 
it into a human being's tough skin, and it is almost 
impossible to make the honeybee queen sting. You can 
tease her and pinch her, and yet she will not run the 
risk of losing her precious sting by runniag it into you. 
Queen bees never like to sting anything but another bee. 

Yes, Ned ; I guess most everybody knows how the 
little black bee sting looks with the little bubble at the 
top. 

That little bubble that comes out with the sting is 
really the cause of almost all the pain the sting 
occasions. 

John says he has heard it is a sac of poison. 

And that is just what it is, ¡ª a sac of poison. 

The muscles in the body of the bee squeeze this 
poison down through the sting into your skin, and it 
is the poison that makes the tiny woimd so painful and 
causes the flesh about it to swell so badly. 

If it were not for the poison, a bee sting would not 
hurt any more than a pin prick. 

Why do you suppose the sting sticks so fast ? 

Well, for the same reason a fishhook sticks. 






Ned says it is the barbs on the end of a hook that 
make it stick. 

And if you can believe it, Ned, this outrageous little 
sting has ever so many tiny barbs at its end. 

They are too small to be seen without a strong mag- 
nifying glass, but' they are very efficient, nevertheless. 
Here is a picture of a sting magnified. 
? Now is n't that a pretty thuig to stick into your 
skin? 

The bee's sting was doubtless not given to it in 
the first place as a weapon of defense, but for quite 
another purpose, which we will discover later. 

But the bee learned to use it as a means of defense, 
and now that is the only use to which it is put by 
the bee family. 

The bumblebees are our good friends, and we should 
never needlessly kill one or break up a nest. If it were 
not for the bimiblebees we would have no red clover, 
as their long tongues alone are able to 
fertilize the little clover blossoms that you 
know are packed together in each clover 
head. If you examine a clover head care- 
fully you will understand about it. 







Lady Apis 

Fairy, fairy on the flowers, who are you, little 
fairy? 

See what dainty wings ! and how fast they buzz ! 
May says she thinks the honeybees are the prettiest 
of all the insects. 

MoUie says she loves to hear them hum and she 
loves to see them flying about. 

They have tongues like the bumblebee, only not so 
long. They cannot get the red-clover honey, but they 
can get that from the little white clover, ¡ª and how 
they do love it ! You will always see honeybees where 
there is a field of white clover, and we all 
know how delicious 
white-clover honey is. 
No, the honeybee is 
not called Bombus, 
but Apis. But like the 
bumblebee it is, as you 
know, a social insect, 
living in communi- 
ties and all working 
together for 
Ai^i^ the common 
good. 







Yes, John; our little Lady Apis is formed very much 
like her big relative, Lady Bombus, as to legs, tongue, 
and sting. 

She carries her pollen in baskets on the hind legs and 
stings in defense of her home. 

She has antenna cleaners and a honey sac, but in one 
respect she differs from the other bees of this country. 

Wax 

Ned says he can guess what that is; it is her wax- 
making habit. 

Right, Ned ; the honeybee is the great wax maker of 
the world. 

Now where do you suppose this wax comes from ? 

Mollie says she guesses the bee collects the wax from 
plants. 

No, Mollie ; our dainty bee actually makes the wax. 

She sweats it out on the under side of the abdomen. 
There it appears as little white scales that lie in depres- 
sions like little pockets on the rings of the abdomen. 

Now, Nell, what are you laughing so about ? 

You never heard of anything so funny as sweating 
out wax ? 

Well, it may be funny, but it is a very useful habit 
to the bees. 





You see the bees live in a hive or a hollow tree, and 
they do not die when winter comes. They all live, 
queen and workers, ¡ª all but the drones. There are a 
great many thousands of bees in a hive and it takes a 
large supply of food to carry them through the winter. 

You know very well what their food is. It is honey 
and beebread. 

Yes, Nell; they live on bread and honey. 

Their bread is made of pollen mixed with honey and 
is like the mass of pollen the bumblebees store away. 

No, indeed. May; our dainty bees are not satisfied to 
live on beebread alone. They want pure honey as well, 
and so they make the delicate honeycomb from the wax 
that oozes out of their own clean little bodies. 

You can see the bees gathering honey on any sum- 
mer's day, and you must not forget their little honey 
sac with the strainer that holds the clear honey, free 
from any impurity. 

The making of honeycomb is one of the most Wi)n- 
derful things in the world. 

If you could look into a hive when the honeycomb 
was being made you would find the wax-making bees 
hung up like a curtain in the hive, clinging to each 
other by their feet and keeping perfectly still. 

No, John; the bees do not all make wax at once. 
Only part of them do this while the others are off after 







honey or doing other work in the hive. 
I'be wax-making bees gorge themselves 
with honey, and then keep 
still until the heavy meal 
digests. A part of the honey 
* they have eaten becomes con- 
verted mto wax. 

Yes, May; eating honey is 
very different from carrying it in 
the honey sac. When the bees eat 
it, it passes on through the honey 
/ \f]!^ S i^^^ sac into the stomach, where it is 
digested. They can pass it on when they 
please, and they can hold it back in the honey sac when 
they please. 

Ned is surprised that bees have stomachs. 
The truth is, Ned, all animals are alike in a general 
way. All of them, from the humblest up to man him- 
self, breathe, digest food, and give off waste substances 
from the body in essentially the same way. 

When you have studied living things more you will 
understand this beautiful truth. 






Honeycomb 



Now about honeycomb. 

When the wax has filled the little pockets of the 
wax workers, they take this brittle substance in their 
little mandibles, or jaws, and chew it, so you see 
how very useful the hard little jaws are to the honey- 
bees. They chew the wax until it is soft and can be 
molded into shape. Then the fim begins. 

You know how a piece of honeycomb looks. 

Yes, Nell ; it is like a great. /^\^^ many long little 
boxes piled up close together. 

Yes, they really are boxes, or 
cans, or cups, just as you _3 __f 
choose to think of them. ; 

Well, the bees have to ,^^'Mp f^:^^ --^ >^^ 

make these wax cups, and yon '^^^([l^^ ^ ¡ê^ 
must not forget that the honeycomb 
has a double set of cups piled up bottom to bottom 
and opening on opposite sides of the comb. 

How do you suppose the little bees do it ? 

Try it yourself with a lump of wax. Make if you can 
just one of those fragile cells, and make it as thin and 
as perfect in form as the bee makes it. 

My dears, you could not do it. Try as long and as 
hard as you like, you could not do it. 






Yet the bees, dozens at a time, work together on the 
honeycomb. They mold the wax into shape with their 
homy mandibles, they pat it with their feet, they pinch 
it and pull it, all standing side by side and working 
together. 

No, May; one bee does not make a whole cell; ever 
so many bees work at each cell, and yet they do not 
get in each other's way nor do they interfere with each 
other's work. 

When they get through there is the marvelous honey- 
comb, made of munberless cells, perfect, empty, ready 
for the honey. 

If you look at honeycomb carefully, you will see 
there is a top and a bottom to it. If you stand it upside 
down, the honey will run out. 

See this honeycomb. Now is it right 
side up or wrong side up ? 
Yes, it is wrong side up. 
If the caps at the end should break, 
the honey would run out. 

Now John is holding it right side up, and you see 
the cells slant up a little, so 
that the top is higher than 
the bottom. 

This helps the bee when 
she is filling the comb with 







honey. It does not run out but remains in place uniil 
she can get the cap on. 

Yes, Nell ; when the cell is full, the bee makes a tight 
wax cap or cover over the top. 

No, John; the cells are not all of exactly the same 
size, even in the middle of the comb. But they are 
nearly the same size, excepting that sometimes, in the 
corners, the cells are large in size or irregular in form 
to fill up the space. 

True, May ; the cells are not curved and smooth inside 
like a cup. They are six-sided, excepting again those 
on the edges, which are somewhat rounded on 
the outside. 

Why do you think the bee makes six-sided 
cells ? 

If you draw a figure with six equal sides, you 
will see. You can place six-sided figures around it and 
fill up all the space. 

Now draw a five-, or a seven-, or an eight-sided figure, 
and you will see how impossible it would 
be to finish it and make a honeycomb of it. 
John says squares would fit together as 
well as hexagons. 

That is true, John. And why do you suppose the 
bees do not make four-sided cells instead of six-sided 
ones ? 








' Yes, that is true ; the four-sided cups would not be 
nearly so strong. 

And so our Uttle architects have wisely chosen the 
one form of cell best suited to their needs. 

Do all the wax cells in the hive contain honey ? 
Nell says they do. 

John says they do not. Last summer he was on a 
farm where they took honey out of old-fashioned hives, 
and there were a great many cells that contained bee- 
bread instead of honey. 

We do not often see beebread these days, because 
man has made very clever hives for the bees, 'and these 
hives have little boxes on top. The bees put the bee- 
bread in the lower part of the hive in the honeycomb 
there, near the young. 

But in the top of the hive, where the little boxes are 
placed, the bees store the extra 
honey, and this hardly ever con- 
tains beebread. 

Yes ; the little glass cases of 
honey we buy in stores are taken 
from the tops of the hives. The 
wooden frames are put in a row, 
and when they are filled with 
honey they are taken out, and 
the glass sides put on to protect 








them on their way to market. We all like to eat the 
honey out of these glass cases. 

No, the bees do not miss this honey. They have 
plenty stored away in the bottom of the hive. And 
then you know that if honey should get scarce towards 
spring, the bee keeper, who is always on the watch, 
would find it out and feed the bees on sugar and water. 



Beehives 

Our neighbor has a hive, and I am sure he will be 
glad to have us make it a visit. 

We will be careful not to go too near, or we may 
get stung. Bees in the field and V on the flowers will 
not sting; but if you go near 
their hive they are apt to. 

Yes, indeed; you can 
clearly see the upper part 
where the little honey 
frames are stored. All I 
you have to do is to 
lift that top off and 
take out the frames 
of honey. 

You would n't like to be the 
one to do it, May ? 






Oh, but the beemaster understands just how to man- 
age, and he seldom gets stung. 

His wise little bees learn to know him, too, and allow 
him to do what they would not submit to from a stranger. 

Sometimes he blows a little smoke on the bees from 
a smoker that comes on purpose, and this smoke quiets 
them imtil he can escape with the honey. 

It is great fun to keep bees. 

Mollie wants to know what is in the lower part of 
that hive*. 

Ah, Mollie ! there is something very important down 
there. 

K you could see in, you would find it full of honey- 
comb and bees. Oh, such quantities of bees ! 

And if you were to examine the honeycomb, you 
would find some of it containing honey and some of it 
something else. 

Yes, Ned ; some of it would be found to contain bee- 
bread. But that is not all. Yet other wax cells would 
contain neither beebread nor honey, but something very 
different. 

See how excited Nell is ! 

Yes, my dear ; you have guessed it. Some of the 
waxen cells contain eggs and larvae. 

The queen bee lays an egg in the cell, and soon this 
hatches into a little larva, like the bumblebee larva. 







The Larv^ and Pup^ 

There is just one queen in the hive, and she lays all 
the eggs. 

As soon as the egg hatches the worker bees feed it ; 
for these cells are not packed full of food upon which 
the larva can feed at pleasure. 

No ; each honeybee larva lies in its waxen cradle and 
waits for the good nurse bees to come along and fill its 
little mouth, as the old bird feeds the young ones. 

When the larvae have grown and molted their very 
delicate skins o¡êE; ¡ª so delicate you can hardly see them, 
¡ª and have finished their larval development, then what 
do you suppose happens ? 

Why, the nurse bees cap over the open end of the cell 
with a cover of wax ; and there are those larvae with 
nothing to do but to turn into 
pupae. 

The first thing they do is to 
spin a cap of silk over the door 
end of their prison. 

I don't know why they do 
that, unless it is a " survival," as we say of a habit 
that was once useful to them. 

Of course the bees have progressed very far indeed 
from what they once were. 





Very likely the young bees in bygone ages made a 
cocoon as the bumblebee larvae still do, and maybe they 
have not quite outgrown the habit, although they no 
longer need a cocoon, protected as they are in their 
beautiful wax cradles. 

What, May, ¡ª was there once a time when bees did 
not make honeycomb ? 

I am sure of it. They learned to do it gradually, 
until it finally assumed its present perfect form. 

But to return to those larvae. They soon change, as 
you will have guessed, into pupae, and in the picture of 
magnified brood cells you can see them. 

When their time is up the pupae cut a hole in their 
wax cover with their hard little mandibles, and out they 
come, perfect honeybees. 

Workers and Drones 

You can readily imagine that the greater number of 
the bees that come out are workers. 

All through the early part of the summer the workers 
come forth in great numbers ; thousands upon thousands 
appear, and as soon as they bite free from their prison 
cells they go to work. 

Some do the work of the hive, keeping it clean and 
ventilating it ; others fly forth in search of pollen and 






honey with which to feed the many hungry 
mouths in the hive and fill the 
empty cells. 

Yes; there are a very great many 
cells in a beehive, ¡ª enough to hold 
the brood and the honey, too. 

Yes, Mollie ; the bees use the , 
same cradle cells over and over ^ 
again. 

As soon as a bee comes out the 
careful nurses clean the cell, and the 
queen lays another egg in it. 

Mollie is asking where the drones 
come from. 

Knowing as you do about the bumble- 
bees, I am sure you can guess what kind of 
bees the drones are. 

Yes ; they are the male bees, and like the bumblebee 
drones they come out in the fall of the year. 

But they do not come from common honeycomb cells. 

No, indeed; the workers build larger cells for the 
drones. They are just like honeycomb cells, only larger. 

Of course these large cells are comparatively few in 
number, though there may be hundreds of them. 

The queen lays an egg in each drone cell, but this egg 
of the drone is different from the eggs of the workers. 






It hatches into a larva that grows into a large pupa 
and finally bites its way out, like the worker bees. 
Do you think you could tell a drone bee by sight ? 
Yes, he is larger than the worker. 
Like the bumblebee drone he has long, 
drooping antennae, and his wings are 
larger in proportion to his body than 
the worker's wings. 

He, too, has no sting, no collecting 
baskets on his legs, and his tongue is small and weak. 
No, he has no honey sac. 
He cannot work. 

You have all heard how he is turned out of the hive 
in the fall of the year. 

The poor fellows are driven forth to perish of cold 
and himger, and sometimes the workers even sting 
them to death. 

You see the bees cannot a¡êEord to have idle mouths to 
feed during the long winter, and so the poor drones are 
sacrificed. 

The Queen 

Now about the queen. She is generally the only per- 
fect female in the hive ; for the workers, as you know, 
are imperfect females that do not lay eggs. Well, there 
comes a time when there are several queens, and this is 






generally somewhat late in the season, ¡ª about the time 
the drones appear. 

The history of the queen is very remarkable, as I 
suppose the history of a queen ought to be. 

Her cell is very different from any other fy^'^ 
cell in the hive. ^{ 

See if you can tell which are the queen 
cells in the picture. 

Yes,they are much larger than the honey- 
comb cells, are thimble shaped, and hang 
mouth down. Now the strangest part is to come. 

The queen lays an egg, exactly like a worker's egg, in 
the queen cell. 

When this egg hatches the nurse bees feed it on a 
kind of food they make on purpose. This food is so 
nutritious that the larvae fed on it develop into perfect 
females, larger than the workers and able to lay the 
necessary eggs. 

May says she should think they might feed worker 
larvae on this food and make queens of them. 

So they can. And so they sometimes do, ¡ª that is, if 
the larva is not too old. 

If the queen should die before she had laid eggs in 
the queen cells, the workers would enlarge a worker 
cell and feed the yoimg larva on queen food, and she 
would develop into a queen. 





Yes ; it is very, very wonderful. 

But suppose the queen does not die, and suppose that 
finally there hatches out a young queen. What will 
happen ? 

Both cannot stay in the same hive. There would be 
trouble indeed. So the old queen departs with a few 
thousands of workers. 

Swarming 

This, you know, is what happens when the bees 
swarm. 

Out the bees come and sit around idle on the outside 
of the hive until it is half covered with them. 

Now all is ready and off they go, streaming, circling, 
gathering closer and closer, until there is a solid mass 
of bees with the dethroned queen somewhere in the 
middle. 

How in the world they can fly huddled together 
like that is a mystery. But they can, and they can 
all go for the same point, too, which seems even more 
wonderful. 

The question now is where to go. 

Generally they soon stop somewhere on the branch 
of a tree or on a bush before taking the final journey. 

This is the time the bee keeper appears. He collects 
them in a new hive, which he puts in a comfortable 




place, and generally they stay, though sometimes they 
do not like the new home and soon leave it. 

No; there is not much danger of getting stung by 
swarming bees; they are usually harmless at that time, 
though I should not advise one who did not understand 
bees to interfere with them. 

If the bee man does not take the swarm, what do you 
think becomes of it? 

Yes, John; it escapes to the woods and there in a hol- 
low tree it makes its new home. 

Nellie is asking how it knew where to go. 

Probably the bees send out scouts to find the new hive 
before they swarm, and these scouts direct them. 

Oh, yes, indeed; the bees are wise. In some respects 
they are wiser than we. 

If they find the opening to the new nest too large, or 
if there are holes in the nest, these clever little home 
makers know what to do. 

Away go the workers and collect a quantity of sticky 
varnish from plant buds and other places, and with this 
" propolis," as it is called, they plaster up all the holes. 






Care of the Home 

There are no better housekeepers than the bees. 
They know the value of fresh air, and you can imagine 
there is need of it in such a crowded house with only 
one small entrance. 

So these good bees ventilate their home. Some of 
them stand at the entrance and fan their wings very 
fast indeed, thus changing the air inside. 

Meantime what has been happening in the 
hive that the queen bee and the swarm so 
iniceremoniously left ? 

Well, the young queen flies out of the hive 
and high up in the air, where she mates with a 
drone. Then she comes back to the hive and 
the regular work of life goes on. 

The yoimg queen begins to lay eggs, and soon 
libber own progeny appear in large numbers to 
I \^ swell the size of the family. 
Vi^^ May wants to know about the other young 
)\r queens. 

If there are several queens all in a hive, 
the first queen to hatch out sometimes 
behaves very despotically indeed. 
She goes to the queen cells, pulls off the caps, 
*and stings the helpless occupants to death. 






If two queens hatch out at the same time, there is a 
fight unless the workers prevent it by surroimding the 
queens and keeping them apart. 

Sometimes several swarms will leave a hive in one 
season and each one, of course, will need a queen. In 
such cases the queens are not allowed to kiU each other. 

There are honeybees all over the world, though they 
are not all just like our honeybees. 

Now what do you think? 

Our only native honeybee is our old friend bimible- 
bee. The hive bees were brought to this country from 
Europe by the early settlers. 

No, MoUie; the Indians had no honey excepting what 
they could get from the bimiblebees' nests, until the 
white man brought the hive bees. 

Yes, there are a great many wild swarms now. The 
bees have left the hives of man's providing and gone to 
housekeeping in homes of their own finding. 

They dearly love a hollow tree, and these " bee 
trees," as they are called, are sought for the honey they 
contain.

LiiOKG Bees 

John says he has helped find a bee tree and it is great 
sport. 

You can soon learn to " line " bees, as it is called. 
Yes; when you see honeybees on the flowers catch 
two or three of them in a net. Then feed one of them 
all the honey it wants and let it go. It will rise up in 
-s. the air and make a " bee line " for its home. 

^-.^ Go some distance away and feed and liber- 

"^ ^ ate another bee. It will also make 

" ^ . a " bee line " for home, and 

^ ^ ^ the point at which these 

"^:^ two lines come together 

^ ^^ -^ " " " must be the home of 

^ ^-- - '"¡ö " the bee. See, here is a bee going 

^ straight to the hive. 

Here is another going straight to the same hive. 
By watching what directions the two bees take, one 
can soon learn to find the hive or the tree in which 
they live. 

It is fun to line bees even if you do not want to get 
the honey. 

No; it is not easy to get honey out of a tree. You 
have to chop the tree down, or at least chop a hole in 
it, ¡ª and there are the bees to settle with. 






No, indeed, Ned ; not ( all bees have as fine 
hives provided for them 
as those of our neighbor. 

The old-fashioned liives 
were just box.es from 
which the honey and 
beebread were taken, 
all in the combs 
together, and the 
poor bees were 
smoked to death. 

Now the hives 
are opened, the pure honey taken 
out from the top, and the rest not disturbed. Sometimes 
the bees are quieted with smoke, but not killed. 

In the South the hollow trunks of sweet-gum trees 
are used for beehives ; these are called bee gums. 

They are often very picturesque standing in the 
flower gardens, but they are not so good for the bees as 
the fine modem hives. 







Abtificial Comb 



May wants to know if it is true ihsii people now 
make artificial honeycomb. 

Yes and no, May. Very often the beeswax is melted 
up after the honey has been extracted, and this wax is 
pressed by machinery into sheets covered on both sides 
with hollows the shape of the bottom of a honeycomb. 

These sheets of pressed wax are hung up in the hives, 
and if you will believe it, the bees go to work and pull 
out the edges of the wax and complete the honeycomb! 

You see, this saves a great deal of time for the bees. 

Instead of secreting wax and building the honeycomb 
from the beginning, they can finish up this prepared 
wax and spend their time bringing in honey. 

In this way the bee men succeed in getting the bees 
to make a great deal more honey. 

What, May, ¡ª you should think the supply of wax 
would give out? 

Oh, but they do not make all the honeycomb this 
way! No, indeed; the bees still continue to make a 
great deal themselves. 

Yes, indeed, John ; another advantage in giving the 
bees a sheet of wax to start with, or a little piece of a 
sheet hung in their little frames, is that the bees are 
thus encouraged to build straight combs. In the 





old-fashioned box hives the combs soraetimea 

stand .side way a or even at right angles to 

each other, and it is then impossible to take 

them out unbroken. 

Oh, there is so much that is interesting about bees, 

we could spend the whole summer over them and then 

not know all. 




The Burly Carpenter 




Listen ! What do you 

suppose is in that stick 

John has in his hand ? Such 

a buzzing ! Ah ! he has his finger over 

a round hole on one side of it. What cart it be? 

Put the stick in a glass jar, John, take away your finger, 

and let us see if anything will come out of the hole. 

Ah, see! there comes a little f>^AK 
shining, coal-black head, and now 
out pops, in a state of great ex- 
citement, ¡ª who ? 
Madam Bumble? 

May says it does 
not look quite like Bumble, although it resembles her. 

No ; and the more you look at it, the more you feel 
sure it is not a bumble (^ \ bee.- For one thing, do 
you not remember what |r^^ a long face Bumblebee 
has ? It is just like this, V^f long and narrow. Do 
you not think this long face makes her look rather 
solemn and wise? 


This new bee has a round little face, and its 
black abdomen is hard and shining, with no 
hairs on it. See, the abdomen lacks the black 
and yellow furry coat of our bumblebee. 

How excited it^ is ! 

Yes, John; it is a carpenter bee, and it made the 
round hole in the stick. 

These bees get their name because they work in wood. 

That round, strong head is supplied with very power- 
ful jaws, and with these jaws our little friend bites bits 
out of hard wood. We find these holes in dead branches, 
and often in the beams and boards of houses. 

John has split open the stick with his 
strong knife, and you can see the 
channel the little workman has 
excavated. She will some- 
times make a channel several ^^|^^^^ inches long 
in the hardest of wood. You^^^^ can imagine the 
mischief these bees often do ¡ö in countries where 
they are very abundant. Indeed, I have seen a house in 
the South quite ruined by them. 

May asks why they do it. 

Well, May, the carpenter bee is not like the honeybee 
or the bumblebee in its habits. 

It is not a "social bee"; it does not live in large 
communities in which all help to do the work. 







This bee lives alone and makes its own nest. There 
iire never any workers to help it. So we call it a 
" solitary bee." 

This little bee, with no hive full of workers to depend 
upon, must find a safe nest for her progeny. Now can 
you guess why she makes these channels in the heart 
of the wood ? 

Yes, indeed ; it is in order that she may have a safe 
place to rear her young. 



Her Nest 

Look at the hind leg of Madam Carpenter Bee. 
MoUie says it looks like the little brush with which 
her mother cleans the lamp chimneys. 

That little black brush serves her instead 
of a basket for carrying pollen. 
=^, _ Yes; she manages to attach to her 
leg-brushes good big loads of pollen, mixed 
with honey, and home she goes to deposit it. 
When she has ^placed a lump about the size of a bean 
in the bottom of her tunnel, she lays an egg on it and 
then builds a partition of sawdust and sahva in front 
of it. The sawdust she makes herself, biting the wood. 
Away she goes, faithful little mother, and gathers 
another limip of pollen upon which she also lays an 








egg, and seals up the end "as before. She continues in 
this way until she has her tunnel quite filled with little 
compartments, each containing an egg and pollen enough 
to feed a larva. 

Nell wants to know why she separates the little com- 
partments with partitions of sawdust. 

I suspect it is in order that these voracious larvaB will 
not eat more than their share of the pollen. Each one has 
its own supply and with that it must be satisfied. 

When the eggs have hatched and the 
larvae have eaten all there is to eat, 
then each one 

spins itself 
a little cocoon 
within which it becomes a 
pupa. The egg that was lowest down in the gallery 
was laid first. Now what will happen if it gets ready 
to come out first as a full-grown carpenter bee ? 

How in the world can it get past all those other larvae 
and the partitions ? 

May says that perhaps it bites another hole out 
through the side of the stick. 

But it could not do that in the beam of a house. 

No, Nature has attended to this matter ; and strange 
to say, the last-laid egg is the first to become a perfect 
bee. 








It easily finds its way out through its sawdust parti- 
tion and through the entrance hole. 

Then No. 2 bites through its sawdust partition, 
crawls out through the empty cell of No. 1, and so 
on until all are out. 

There are a great many carpenter bees flying about 
in some parts of the South, and they have a funny way 
of poising in the air and then suddenly darting off with 
tremendous rapidity. 

It is only the female that has brushes 
' on the hind legs. She alone carries pollen. 
Tliere are male carpenters, or drones, but 
no workers. 

The carpenter bees do not live in com- 
munities like the bumblebees ; 
they are solitary in their habits 
and so there is no need of 
workers. 
Sting ? Well, I guess they can sting ! 
But they will not trouble you unless 
you trouble them. Queen bees never 
like to sting, and drones cannot. 






The Masons 

Way down South, where the houses are often made of 
logs chinked with clay, and where they have chimneys 
made of stones and mortar, one often sees the clay and 
mortar riddled with round holes, 
and bees constantly going in 
and out of them. Some- 
times you might imagine 
there was a swarm 
located somewhere in 
the walls of the house the 

bees go in and out in such large numbers. No, they 
do not sting the people who live in the house; they 
attend to their own affairs, flying straight to the holes 
in the walls which they have made themselves. Because 
they work in mortar or in banks of hard earth they are 
called mason bees. 

They are solitary bees that live very much like the 
carpenter bees, and you can imagine that they are a 
nuisance where they exist in large numbers. 



The Miners 

John says we must not sit down on this pleasant bank. 
Oh, yes ! we now see why. 

If we were to sit down here, we should close up the 
front doors to a great many homes. 

See all these little holes in the ground. And see who 
are going in and out of them. 
Yes, May ; the little owners of these 
^ underground nests are bees, but you 
need not run, for they have no desire 
to sting you. 

I do not believe they would sting even if you sat on 
the entrance to their nests, but they would be very much 
troubled, poor little mothers. For that is what they are, 
¡ª little mother bees. They have dug these holes, and 
are now busy storing them with pollen, which they bring 
home from the flowers. 

What, John, ¡ª you do not see any pollen on their 
legs as they go in ? 

That is because they do not carry pollen on their legs. 
They have another method of transporting it. If you 
were to look at the under side of the abdomen, you would 
find it covered with long collecting hairs, and when the 
bee goes into its nest these hairs are covered thick with 
pollen. 





No; you cannot see the pollen load on these busy 
miners unless you catch them. See how quickly they 
pop into their holes. 

See ! there goes one. 

No, indeed; they are not ^^ social" bees, although 
they like to build their nests so close together. Each 
bee has its own nest and no other bee helps to make it. 

These pretty bees dig a hole in the ground by taking 
out the earth, bit by bit, in their jaws. They do not 
make a single tube like our carpenter, but when they 
have sunk their main shaft they form side passages, 
each of which ends in a pocket. In these little 
pockets the mother bee places the pollen and 
lays an egg on each mass of it. 

Some of these little bees have long tongues 
like the honeybees and some have short tongues, 
but as they do not collect honey to store up, the 
length of the tongue is not of much consequence, 
as long as they are able to get enough to eat. 

May says she should think the ants and other 
insects would crawl down and get the pollen and 
eat the larvse of the miner bees. 

No, May; our bee is too careful a mother for that. As 
soon as she has stocked her pockets with pollen and laid 
her eggs, she fills in the opening to the gallery with dirt 
through which the young bees have to dig their way out. 



^^t' 








Rose-Leaf Blankets 

Perhaps the cunningest of these bee 

, homes is made by a little bee that bores 

into the stems of shrubs and wraps 

its masses of pollen in pieces cut 

from rose leaves. 

There is a rosebush over there on which 

these little ones have been at work. 

Let us see who will be the first to find 
a leaf cut by the bees. 
Ah! here comes Nell, the first to find the leaf. You 
did well, Nell; there are four of these leaflets from which 
our pretty bee has cut her nursery blankets. 
And now you shall see the nursery itself. 
Are they not dainty cradles? You can 
plainly see the rose leaves wrapped about the 
pollen. 

There is a bee even daintier than this one, 
for she takes flower petals in which to wrap 
her pollen. 

You will certainly be able to find the solitary bees 
if you look, and it is well worth while to watch their 
cunning ways. 

There are a great many kinds of solitary bees in the 
world. 








Lady Vespa 

John says he has found a 
paper house so small that we 
could carry it in one hand and 
yet not one of us would dare 
touch it* 

We can guess whose house it 
is. It is the home of Madam 
Wasp that you have found. 

Ned says that it isn't a 
wasps' nest but a hornets' nest 
that John means. 

But, Ned, a hornet is only one kind of wasp. 

You remember there are several kinds of bees. Well, 
there are also several kinds of wasps. 

Like the bees, the wasps are social or solitary. 

Hornets and yellow jackets are social wasps. They 
always live in communities. 

May wants to know if the wasps are not very much 
like the bees, for she has been looking at some of the 


hornets that John caught and has with him in a box 
with a net over the top. 

Yes, indeed, May; they belong to the same order. 
Who can remember its name? 

Nell is the first to say it. Yes, it is the Hymenoptera. 

We find the wings and the sting of the wasp like the 
wings and sting of the bee, differing very slightly in 
unimportant details. There is one thing about the 
wings though that we will be sure to notice; that is, 
they look so narrow when folded. 

This is not because they are narrow, but because they 
are folded lengthwise, like a fan, when not in use. 

els to legs, we will look in vain for pollen baskets 
^ on the hind legs of the wasps. The wasps do 

j I not live on pollen, so of course they do not need 
V baskets in which to carry it. 

Yes, John; they do eat honey, but they are not 
wholly dependent upon it, and their tongues are 
short and flat, so we never see them on those flowers 
that have long tubes. 

Our big black and white hornet is the largest of our 
social wasps, and quite a formidable antagonist it is with 
its large, strong sting. 

The yellow jackets are like the hornets excepting that 
their bodies are black and yellow instead of black and 
white, and they do not grow quite so large. 




Yes, May; the hornets and some of the yellow jackets 
build their nests out of doors, often hanging them to 
the tree limbs or under the eaves of houses; but some 
species of yellow jackets, like the bumblebees, build 
their nests underground. 




Paper Houses 

The nest, as you see, is not made of wax. 
Yes, MoUie; it is made of gray paper. 
Nell wants to know if they sweat out the paper, as 
the bees sweat out the wax. 





No, Nell, they do not. They make the paper in quite 
another way. 

The wasps were the very first paper makers in the 
world, and man has just learned to make his paper out 
of the materials the wasps use. 

Who knows what is used to-day for making the paper 
our newspapers are printed on? 

Yes; such paper is made from wood pulp, ¡ª wood 
ground up and mixed with certain substances and 
pressed into paper. 

My dears, that is just what the wasps did thousands 
of years ago. They bit out the pieces from dead wood 
and chewed it with their sticky saliva until it could be 
spread out and would harden. 

You can see the wasps in the summer time biting 
out bits of wood and then flying home with them rolled 
into a ball which they carry under their necks. This 
little lump of wood pulp they spread out into paper 
which quickly dries and hardens. 

John wants to know when the hornets make their 
nests. 

The nest is started in the early spring by one hornet. 

Yes, May; this is the queen hornet that has been 
hiding away somewhere over winter. 

In this respect the wasps' nest is like the bumble- 
bees'. 






"¡ö"y^ The large queen wasp collects wood pulp 

^ ""^ ' and makes with it a little group of four or 
five cells shaped like honeycomb 
cells. These she speedily covers 
with a dome of paper. And there the little 
home hangs, for all the world like a paper 
bell with a group of cells for a clapper. 

Young Wasps 

You can guess what Madam Vespa puts into those 
paper cells. 

No, indeed ; she does not fill them with food first and 
then lay an egg in the food, as the solitary bees do ; she 
behaves like the honeybees in the way she lays her eggs 
and cares for her young. 

In each empty cell she lays an egg, and when the eggs 
hatch good Mother Vespa has all the little larvaB to feed. 

What food do you suppose she carries home to these 
ravenous youngsters? The country butcher will tell you 
that the wasps steal his meat. Indeed, they do. They 
bite out bits of meat and fly home with them and put 
them into the hungry little mouths. They also like 
fruit and sugar, and they chew up insects to 
feed the young. Yes, they are omnivorous, 
which means they eat both animal and vegetable food 






Yes, May; young wasps are as hard to bring up as 
young birds. 

They have to be fed one by one by the mother wasp, 
and they have to be kept warm. 

But it does not take them many days to grow, and 
then you know what happens. 

Yes, May ; they change into pupaB. Just before this 
happens they spin their cocoon and shut themselves 
into their gray paper cradles by a pretty white cap of 
silk over the open end. 

Mollie says she should think they would fall out of 
the cells that hang mouth down. 

Sometimes they do, but they have a way of clinging 
fast, so that this fatal accident does not often happen. 
Yes, John ; if they fall out they perish, 
as the mother wasp is not able to put them 
back again. 
Well, after a few more days you know what 
happens next. These youngsters, changed into perfect 
wasps, bite open the silken cap they put on their cells, 
and out they come. 

Yes, Mollie; you are right. Out of these first cells 
come worker wasps, and when there are enough workers 
to attend to everything the queen no longer goes abroad. 
She stays at home and lays the eggs, and the workers 
enlarge the nest and feed the young. 





the social wasps ^5 

Enlarging the Nest 

John says he does n't see how it 
is possible to enlarge the nest after 
the outer cover has been put on. 

The wasps have solved this prob- 
lem, though not in a very eco- 
nomical manner. 

Outside the first cover, and a 
little space from it, they build 
another. Then they bite away the inside one. . 

Yes, May ; it is like building a house and finding it 
too small, and adding to it by building walls and a 
roof about it, and then knocking out the inside walls 
and roof. 

Nell says she should think their house would be in 
confusion all the time. 

Not so much so as our houses would be, if built by 
their plan. For paper is easy to work with, and the 
wasps are very quick and very neat, carrying out every 
little scrap and dropping it on the ground. 
Here is a picture of half a nest about 
I K^^'^k ^1^^^^ ^^^ walls have been built. 
V\'m^^ Rapidly the nest grows, and the 
outer wall is kept quite thick and 
made of many layers to protect 






the treasures within from wet weather and also from 
sudden changes of temperature. 

When the paper comb is as large around as the 
largest nest could hold, it still contains too few cells to 
accommodate the rapidly increasing family. 

If you examine a nest, you will quickly 
how this difficulty is overcome. 
\s the nest increases in diameter 
it also increases in length, 
and below the first round 
paper comb is suspended 
another, and then another 
and another. 

So the work goes on, the 

inner walls being constantly 

torn down, the outer ones 

made, and new combs added 

until the nest reaches the for- 

idable proportions it sometimes 

les. 

You can imagine that the wasps are very 
easily excited when any one comes near their fragile 
tenement; and as they have strong and effective 
weapons always at hand, they are ready at a moment's 
notice to sting you whenever they can find an un- 
protected spot. 





Yes, indeed ; they, too, have a poison sac attached to 
their sting. As a rule wasps will not sting unless mo- 
lested, and like the bees they learn to know their friends. 

Indeed, wasps have been tamed so that their owner 
could handle their nest, and cut it open and look into 
it when he pleased without any danger of being stung. 

But I do not advise anybody to try this. 

Queens, Workeks, and Drones 

Thus far our nest has a queen and many workers. 
Who can guess what happens next ? 

Yes, John ; towards the end of the summer the wasps 
build some large cells around the outer edge of the 
combs, and they often make the lowest comb entirely 
of these large cells. 

Of course you all know what come out of them. 

Yes ; out of some come large drones, 
and out of others come young queens. ^--^ 

There are no bitter feelings between 
the queens of a wasps' nest. They all live happily 
together imtil cold weather comes, when all leave the 
nests, the queens to hide away until the following 
spring, the drones and workers to perish. 

Yes ; it is safe to take a hornets' nest into the house 
after cold weather has come. 





Some say they have found live wasps in the nest then, 
but it is not usually the case. 

Probably the nests are too fragile to bear the winter 
storms, and the queens prefer a safer hiding place. 

Yes, Ned; the wasp drones are stingless, and there- 
fore harmless. You can recognize them, as you can the 
drones of the bees, by their long-drooping 
antennae, their large size, big wings, 
and square bodies. 

Ned says he thinks the wasps are 
as interesting as the bees. 

May says they are not so pretty 
and they do not give us honey. 
But surely they are interesting 
enough. 
And do not forget that they were the 
very first paper makers. 




Lady Polistes 

Ned says he has found a 
nest just started. It has r 
outer cover, and is hang- 
ing to a twig on that bush over 
there. Let us go and see. 

Ah, Ned! this is not our friend Vespa. The wasp 
that made this nest has a long, slender, brown body 






with a yellow line around it. See ! there she comes, a 
dainty little lady who does not look at all fierce. 

No, this is not a hornet nor a yellow jacket. 

It is our little friend Polistes, and she does not put 
an outer covering about her home. 

It is a very small and fragile affair, you see, when 
compared to the stately abode of Vespa. 

But Polistes manages to make it answer her purpose. 

She is a pretty little wasp and very easily tamed. 

You could go at night and cut off the twig with her 
house on it and put it in a box and take it home, and 
Polistes would soon become very friendly. 

Yes, indeed; the little nest, as you can see, is made 
of paper, and this Polistes collects as Vespa does. 

The story of her home is about the same as that of 
Vespa' s, and the drones, which come out in the fall, have 
white faces. You often see them sitting on rocks sun- 
ning themselves. 

Polistes sometimes comes into the house and often 
builds her nest under the roof of a shed ; indeed, 
we seldom find her in an unprotected place like 
this bush. Sometimes there will be a great many i 
of these little nests close together. 

You need have no fear of Polistes, for 
unless you actually take hold of her or touch 
her nest she will not sting you. 











. Yes, indeed; her wings lock together like the wings 
~**"^ of the bees and like those of Vespa, and 

when not flying she folds them together 
lengthwise like a fan, thus making them 
look very long and narrow. 
There are a good many species of these 
little paper-comb makers in the world, and 
they are always pretty and gentle and interesting to 
watch. It is surprising how many cunning things they 
do. Watch them when you get a chance and see if 
they are not wise and clever little housekeepers. 







Little Friend Mud Dauber 

What do you think? Ned says he 
has caught Polistes making her nest 
of mud. 

We must attend to that, Ned. 
Let us go to the shed where Ned 
saw this strange sight. 

Ah! there is the nest, but where, 
oh where, is Polistes? 

Here comes the owner of those 
mud caves. But do you call this wasp 
Polistes? Look at the long-waisted, yellow-legged 

dame! Surely that is not our 
little brown Polistes. 
No, Ned, this is not 

Polistes. It is not a social 

"^ wasp at all ; it does not live in communities 
of queens, workers, and drones. 

This is a solitary wasp. It lives alone and builds its 
nest aU by itself. 


This is the mud dauber. 
You can easily guess why it has this name. 
Yes, it makes its nest of mud. 
Let us watch this one and see how she does it. 
See, she has flown away, but not far. She is 
resting by the wet place near the bam pimip. 
And see! she is digging out mud and rolling 
^ it into a ball. 

Yes, Nell; she seems to be standing on her head in 
her eagerness. 

Now she is flying back to the shed with a little ball 
of mud held close imder her head. 

We will go, too, and see what she does with it. 
There, she is spreading it out over that unfinished 
cell, ¡ª and what a loud buzzing she keeps up! 

Yes, May ; it is as though she were singing at her work. 
Some of the cells you see are entirely closed up. 
What do you suppose is in them? 

John says he knows; he broke one open the other day 
and it was full of spiders. 

MoUie wants to know what spiders were doing in a 
wasps' nest. 

If we were to wait and watch our little mud dauber 
long enough, we should easily find out. 

When her mud cell is finished, all but closing up one 
end, she goes hunting. 





She does not provision her children's larder with pol- 
len and honey, but with fresh insects or spiders that she 
stings for the purpose. 

No; she does not sting her victims to death. She 
merely paralyzes them so that they remain quiet. 

On the body of one of them she lays an egg. When 
the cell is full of insects or spiders, she seals up the 
end and leaves her offspring to its fate. 

You can imagine what now happens. 

The egg hatches and the wasp larva at 
once begins the consumption of the spiders, 
or whatever the careful mother has provided. 
You see the creatures being alive remain fresh, 
so that the larva has fresh food all the time. 

By the time it has eaten up everything in 
the cell it has grown and molted until it is I 
ready to become a pupa. 

This it does, sometimes remaining in the pupa 
state all winter and coming out in the spring. 

Do you remember what we said awhile ago about the 
sting of the bee having been originally used for some 
other pm-pose than defense ? 

Yes, John says he guesses now what that sting means. 
It was first used as a hunter uses his spear, ¡ª to secure 
prey for food. It is believed that long ago the bee also 
used its sting to secure its prey, and that in course of 








time it learned to live on pollen and honey, preserv- 
ing the sting as a weapon of defense. 

No ; there are no workers among the mud daubers, 
¡ª only queens and drones. 

It is great fim to watch these little masons at 
work, and they are so gentle that one can 
stand quite close to them without any 
danger of being stung. 

Yes, May; their wings are narrow, but 
they do not fold them fanlike; only the 
social wasps fold the wings that way. 

Yes, the wasps are flesh eaters as a 
rule. They like insects or meat, although 
they also eat honey and are fond of fruit 
juices and all sweet things ; but they feed 
their young mostly on animal food. The 
solitary wasps, that shut their infants up in 
a roomful of food and let them help them- 
selves, always provide animal food, ¡ª 
never pollen, so far as I know. 

Yes; there are many species of the mud 
^^^^n^ daubers, and a very common one is bright 
blue in color. 

Yes ; I am sure you have all seen this 

beautiful, shining, blue wasp. And most of us 

have seen a pretty black mud dauber that builds a long 







tunnel of mud and divides it into cells, as the wood 
borers divide their tunnels. 

If you take a mud dauber's nest into the house in the 
fall, the wasps will come out quite early in the spring; 
and if you touch them gently with your finger and feed 
them honey or candy as 
soon as they bite the cap 
off, before they are even out of 
the cells, they will become perfectly tame, and 
will not sting you unless you hurt them. 

The Diggers and Miners 

May wants us to come and see a wasp dig a hole in 
the ground. 

See ! she digs with her fore feet like a dog and kicks 
the dirt out behind her. She has nearly disappeared. 
What do you think she will do when she gets 
her hole completed ? 

Yes, she will provision it. She will go 
on many a hunting expedition for 
caterpillars or other insects 

pleasing to her taste, and vihen^^^^^^^ii^^^y.^^^ 
she has gathered her store of food, '^^^ "^, 

andr tucked it away in the bottom of her hole, she will 
lay an egg on it and then close up the hole. 








The digger wasps are very, very interesting, 
and often they are very large and handsome. 

You must watch them and find out for your- 
selves the clever things they do. 

Yes f there are wasps that bore into wood to 
make their nests. 

Sometimes you will find a dried elder twig 
full of little cells placed end to end, as the f. 
carpenter bee places its cells, but these little ones belong 
not to Madam Carpenter but to a little miner wasp. 

There are a great many wasps in this country, and 
they are well worth watching. 

One handsome fellow that we occasionally see is by 
most people believed to be an ant. It is called the velvet 
ant because of the velvety fur that clothes its body. 

What, May, ¡ª you have seen it ? It is bright red and 
runs very fast ? 

Yes; that is the velvet ant, and it is the female 
which we see running so swiftly along the ground. 
She has no wings. 

What, May, ¡ª you never succeeded in catching her ? 
Tt 19 fortunate for you that you did not. 
My dears, if you catch this brilliant wasp 
in your fingers, you will be sorry 
for a long time after, for she 




J?^ 



has a most formidable sting. 




Running here, running there, running every- 
where, are the ants. 

We cannot walk in the country in the 
summer time without seeing them. 

Yes, John; they have been studied a 
great deal, and yet we do not know so 
very much about them. You see, they 
have their nests underground, so that 
it is usually rather hard to 
study them. 

The ants 
belong to 
bees, ¡ª to 

May is 
that when 

But 
We have 





the same family as the 
the Hymenoptera. 
wondering how we know 
they have no wings, 
they do have wings. May. 
often seen winged ants 
\ flying about in vast 
numbers in the summer. 
Yes, MoUie; they appear 
suddenly some day and cover 
everything ; then they as suddenly disappear. 


Now where do you suppose these flying 
"^ants come from? 

Yes, out of the nests. 
Down underground in the ants' nests 
these winged members of the family appear 
among coimtless numbers that have no wings. 
The ants that never have wings are the workers. 
Yes, May; like the bee and wasp workers, the ant 
workers are imperfect females. 

Now you can guess what the winged ants are. 
Yes ; they are the males and females, the fathers and 
mothers of the community. 

There are a great many species of ants, more than we 
could study in a whole summer, or in a dozen summers. 
Some of them live in the ground, making burrows in 
which the eggs are laid and the young reared. 

The Larv^ and Pup^ 

The ants take very good care of their young. As soon 
as the eggs hatch the busy workers feed the helpless 
larvae. These larvae look very much like bee larvae. 

Yes, they are little white grubs without legs or 
wings. When they are ready to pupate, which means, 
you know, to become pupae, many species spin for 
themselves a neat little cocoon. 







When an ant nest is broken into, the ants hastily 
catch up these cocoons and attempt to escape with them. 

Many people think these cocoons are the ants' eggs, 
but the eggs are so tiny that they are seen only by 
those who look very carefully for them. 

No, indeed, MoUie ; they are not as large as the head 
of a pin. 

Some ants' nests have winding galleries where the 
nurseries are located and where food is stored, for the 
ants, like the bees, live through the winter. 



The Queen 

Now about the winged ants. 

They fly out at certain times, many 
colonies together, and mate, after 
which the male ants, like the drones, 
die, and the females return to the 
nests. 

When the female goes back 
into the nest her flying days are over. She 
has no further use for her wings, so what do you think 
she does ? She pulls them off and leaves them outside. 

The female is very much larger than the workers, and 
in this way you can always recognize her. She lays 
the eggs for the whole colony, and unlike the queen 







bee, she does not hate the other queens ; so that 
several are sometimes found livmg happily together 
in the same nest. 

Sometimes a number of workers will take a young 
queen and start a new nest. With some species the 
young queen starts her own nest without any help, the 
first workers that hatch out quickly relieving her of all 
responsibility. 

The Ants' Cows 

Yes, the ants do many remarkable things. You have 
all heard about their fondness for the aphides, or plant 
lice, which are sometimes called the ants' cows. 

Ants are fond of sweets, and so they befriend the 
aphides for the honeydew which they afford. 

Wherever there are aphides on the plants one is 
pretty sure to find ants, and the ants may be seen 
caressing the aphides with their antennae in order, so 
it is said, to coax them to give forth the honeydew. 

Some species of ants take care of the aphides, driv- 
ing off their enemies and even carrying them to new 
feeding places when the old ones are exhausted, just 
as a herdsman takes his cattle to new pastures when 
the old fail. 

. When winter approaches, these wise ants carry the 
aphid eggs into their o\vn warm nests and take care of 







them until they hatch the following spring, when the ants 

carry the young aphides out and put them on the leaves. 

Yes, May ; all this is truly very wonderful. The ants 

do so many wise things that they fill us with amazement. 





In some species there are different kinds of 
workers, ¡ª small ones for general work and 
large ones with enormous heads that are called |> 
soldier ants, and that are believed to fight ^~" 
for the colony and to protect it. 

Yes, it is quite true. May, that some ants 
keep slaves. There is a long, reddish-brown 
or yellowish ant that does this, and the ants 
captured are black. 

Out sallies the marauding army until the 
nest of the poor black ants has been ap- 
proached, when forth rush the blacks, and 
there is a terrific combat in which the 
ants tear off each other's legs and even 
heads, which they leave strewn on the 
field of battle. Their weapons are not 
guns and swords, but their powerful jawa, 

If the attacking army conquers, it enters the 
nest of the defeated army and triumphantly carries 






off all the pupaB and larvaB it finds there. These are 
taken home and carefully raised, for they are destined 
to do the whole work of the colony for their masters. 

The young slave ants, thus brought up in a strange 
nest, do not leave it, but become very warmly attached 
to their masters, for whom they wilHngly labor. 

Some species of ants have depended so long and so 
entirely upon the services of their slaves that they have 
lost the power even of feeding themselves, and starve to 
death, with food within reach, unless a slave is at hand 
to put it in their mouths. 

They have retained only one power, and that is to 

fight and 
^g^=^ capture 
slaves. 

Wars and Other Occupations 

Oh, yes ; ants are great fighters, and two colonies will 
often go to war where there are no slaves involved. 

These ant wars are sometimes very formidable affairs, 
lasting many hours, or even two or three days, and 
involving thousands upon thousands of slain and 
wounded. 

Yes, John ; it is true that some species of ants in hot 
countries plant and raise their own grain, and some 







have gardens in their underground nests in which they 
grow a sort of plant that serves them as food. 

Some build tunnels or passages from their nests 
to their himting or collecting grounds, so they 
can run safely back and forth with no danger 
of being molested by enemies. 

Some go in armies after provisions and ran- 
sack the people's houses from top to bottom, 
leaving nothing behind that they can carry 
off, ¡ª that is, nothing good to eat. When 
the people see an army of ants coming, they 
catch up the baby, cover tightly or take 
away what food they wish to keep, and 
leave the ants to " clean house," which they 
very thoroughly do, killing and carrying 
away all the cockroaches and other trouble- 
some insects that may have taken up their 
abode there. 

Nell says she has heard that some ants 
carry parasols. 

Well, you can call them parasols if you 
like. There are certain Mexican ants that 
go up certain trees and bite off the leaves, which their 
comrades down below collect and carry home over 
their heads, reminding one of a procession with raised 
umbrellas. They store the leaves in their nests. 






Yes, the legs of the ants are like those of the bees 
and wasps. They have the antenna cleaners, like the 
bees and wasps, but of course they have no baskets or 
pollen brushes on their legs, for they have no use for 

such implements. 

They eat a great many things 
-and use both animal and vege- 
table food, which they carry 
^"^ home in their jaws. They 
have a way of telling each other when they find a piece 
of food too heavy for one ant to lift. Who has not 
seen several of these wise little sisters tugging away at 
one load, which together they pull into the nest ? 

They have remarkable brains, though it is impossible 
for us to know just how muqh thinking they do. 

Their antennae are very sensitive, and they know each 
other and seem affectionate. 

Bees and wasps recognize members from the same 
hive and fight strangers ; but the bees and wasps do not 
caress each other as the ants do, and if a bee or a w.asp 
gets hurt its friends do not try to help it. 

But the ants ! how tenderly they clean off an unfor- 
tunate comrade and care for it ! 

When they meet they touch each other with their 
antennae, and in this way seem to convey messages. 
Yes ; they send out scouts when they are ready to go 





on a slave-hunting expedition or on a y marauding ex- 
pedition for food J so when the ^^..^¡ªtime comes all 
is ready, and / ^^.^^^^^^ ^^^ army pours 

forth, going / Jli:^^^ straight to the right 

place with J^r out losing time or wandering aim- 
lessly about. 
Ants behave in very curious ways, and 
do many things that we cannot under- 
stand; it has even been supposed that they 
play games and dance about to express their 
happiness. . 
They often use dead insects as food, and if an 
unfortunate ant from another colony gets into 
the wrong nest it may be attacked, slain, and 
stored away for future consumption. 

But if one of their own number dies, you will 
see no such conduct. The dead comrade will be 
carried respectfully out, the bearer sometimes ac- 
companied by other ants, and laid down a long 
distance from the nest. They never eat the mem- 
bers of their own colony. 

Yes, indeed ; the ants are probably the wisest 
and most remarkable of all the insects. There 
are a great many species, and probably there 
are more ants creeping about the earth than any 
other kind of insect. 






No, not all ants live in the ground ; some live under 
the bark of trees, and some in dead wood or in the 
walls of houses. 

They are all sizes, ¡ª from the tiny little yellow ants 
so small that we can hardly see them, to the enormous 
black or red-and-black ants that sometimes get into 
our pantries. They are a very great nuisance to us, but 
there are so many of them and they are so well pro- 
tected in their homes undergroimd that it is impossible 
to exterminate them. 

In warm countries the ants sometimes make the life 
of man a burden, or even drive him away altogether. 



Mound Builders 

Yes, Ned ; some ants build large mounds 

with galleries running all through 

them, ¡ª very wonderful 

structures indeed, 

and very terrible 

for anybody to sit 

upon. For the 

ants can bite 

quite severely 

with their little 

jaws, and, like 





the bees and wasps, some of them have stings. Indeed, 
people have lost their lives from accidentally stumbling 
into one of these great ant-hills and being instantly 
covered with the angry insects. 

There are some very curious ants, in Mexico I think, 
that build mounds. Certain of the workers are modified 
to form, ¡ª guess what ? 

No, not soldiers with enormous heads. You could 
never, never guess. They are modified to form honey jars. 

The other workers gather a sort of honey and feed 
these accommodating bottles that cling fast to the roof 
and store away the honey until the abdomen becomes 
little more than a skinful of it, and as large as a currant. 
Later, when the honey season is over, the living bottles 
give up their contents to their comrades. 

John says he has heard that the people sometimes 
gather these honey ants and have them for dessert, 
eating them as we do ripe grapes. 

There, there. May ; you know you are not obliged to 
eat any of them. 

White Ants 

Ned wants to know if white ants are the same as the 
other ants. 

No, indeed, Ned ; the white ants, or termites, as they 
are sometimes called, are not ants at all. 







They belong to quite a different family, one more 
nearly related to the dragon flies than to the ants. 

Sometimes in the woods we find imder a stone a col- 
lection of grayish white little creatures that remind us 
a little of ants, though if we look at them carefully we 
will instantly see they are not. They are the termites, 
and they have the name " white ants " because their 
habits are so similar to those of the true ants. 

They have winged males and females and wingless 
workers, and live in communities and often do much 
damage. We are not much troubled by them in the 






North, but in tropical countries they are a terrible pest, 
destrojdng the walls and beams of houses, and, in fact, 
anjrthing made of wood, into which they bore, eating 
out everything but an outer shell. 






John says he has brought us some apples, but he fears 
^(, we will not enjoy their flavor. 

See ! the rogue has some oak apples, 
/or oak balls, or galls; you can take 
your choice of names. 

No, indeed ; we shall not care to 
eat them. They are not apples at 
all, ¡ª just little cradles. 

This is how it happened. A cer- 
tain insect laid an egg on the oak 
the egg hatched the little white, leg- 
to eat, and as soon as it began to 
eat, the skin of the leaf began to change and grow 
into this strange form. 

If we open one of these galls, we shall find a hard 
kernel at the center and the space between filled with 
a spongy material. If we crack the hard kernel, we 
shall find at its center either a fat little larva or a 
hard, brown, round, little pupa. 

The maker of these strange growths on the oak trees 
is a little insect that looks somewhat like a fly, but is 

260 




leaf, and when 
less larva began 





really closely related to the bees, wasps, and ants, ¡ª like 
them, belonging to the Hymenoptera. It is called the 
gallfly. There are a number of these gallflies that 
produce different kinds of galls. 

The galls on certain oaks that grow in Asia are quite 
useful, being frequently employed in the manufacture 
of ink. 

Oh, yes ; there are a great many kinds of galls on 
different plants, and a good many of them are caused 
by gallflies, though there are many kinds caused by 
other insects. 

No; the gallfly does not look much like a bee or 
a wasp, but if you were to examine it carefully you 
would discover that it really is very similar to them 
in structure. 

The truth is, the gallfly is one of those common 
insects that we know very well by sight, but concerning 
whose real nature we are usually quite ignorant. 

I quite agree with John, who thinks that the very 
best thing we get from studjdng the insects is the 
knowledge that they are really like all other animals. 

Yes, they differ in details, but all living things are 
essentially alike, ¡ª all need air and food, and all are 
able to employ their powers in like manner. 







My ! What is that ? 
I don't wonder you ask. 

Of all the insects we have seen, none equals this 
with its long streamers. 

That, my dears, is an ichneumon fly. 
Oh, no, it is not a fly at all; it belongs 
to the ^^ Hjonenoptera. 

What do^. you suppose those long streamers are 
for ? It is V^ hard to believe, but they are the ovi- 
positor ; and ^ slender as they are, the sharp point 
at the tip of one ^ of them can bore into the hardest 
wood. When egg- \\ laying time arrives Madam 
Ichneumon searches \\ about on a tree trunk until 
she thinks she has\\ located the burrow where in 



the wood of the tree 
tail, which is another 
There Madam Ichneu 
parts of the long oviposi 
her body, braces her long 
ceeds to bore a hole into the 
the burrow of the homtail 




lives the larva of a hom- 
of the Hymenoptera. 
mon shuts together the 
tor, curves it up over 
legs firmly, and pro- 
tree, as far as 
When she 





has bored into the burrow she deposits an egg there, and 

when the larva hatches it creeps about until it has found 

the homtail larva, when it proceeds to suck the blood 

of its hapless victim. When the ichneumon larva 

has reached its full size it transforms into a pupa^ 

and emerging, still within 

the. tree, it finds its way out 

through any convenient hole^ 

or if there is none, it bites its 

way through to the outside 

world. 

Only the females have these 
long streamers, and sometimes the 
long ovipositor is the cause of Madam Ichneumon's 
death, for it gets so tightly wedged into the tree trunk 
that she cannot pull it out again. 

Yes, indeed, John; the larva of the ichneumon is a 
parasite. It is parasitic on the larvae of another insect. 
These parasites are very valuable, killing as they do the 
tree borers. 

There are a great many ichneumons, though most of 
them are small in size, and the parasitic habits of the 
larvae make them the friend of man. 

Some ichneumons lay their eggs on caterpillars or 
other insects injurious to fruit or grain, and the larvae 
live inside their insect host. 






The host, May, is the insect that entertains the para- 
site, although very much against its will. 

The host caterpillar in some cases spins its cocoon and 
then dies, and the parasite makes its cocoon within the 
cocoon of its host. 

Again, certain ichneumon larvae live in the caterpillar 
until they have attained their growth, when they come 

out and spin their little silken 
^^f)f)/ii\{)i\. y cocoons on the back of the cater- 






pillar, which now soon perishes, 
having been literally devoured 
by its iminvited guests. 

We sometimes see these poor caterpillars walking 
about covered with cocoons. 

Even the aphides have their ichneumons, and tiny 
things they are, as you can imagine. 

Bees and wasps and indeed many kinds of insects 
are the victims of the many species of ichneumons that 
abound in the world. Some of these ichneumons are 
brilliant in coloring, and when you see a glittering, 
green fly, with long antennae that constantly vibrate, 
hunting along the path or on the side of a house, you 
may be pretty sure it is an ichneumon looking for a 
wasp in whose nest it can lay its egg. 



John has brought us a homtail, and he wonders if it 
is the one that burrows in trees and into whose burrow 
the big ichneumon lays its eggs. 

Yes, John, it is the very same. You see the long, 
hard horn at the end of the abdomen. Well, that is the 
boring instrument, and a powerful one it is for its size. 

Yes; like the ovipositor of the ichneumon, that of 
the horntail sometimes gets wedged in so tightly that 
it cannot be pulled out. 

The larvae of the homtails bore channels through the 
solid wood and are very destructive to trees. 

Yes, indeed ; the Hymenoptera is a large order, and its 
members present very different appearances and have 
very different habits. 

Yes, May ; the ovipositor is a curiously modified organ 
in the Hymenoptera. 

In the bees, wasps, and some ants it is a sting ; in the 
ichneumons it is a boring instrument for drilling holes 
in wood or piercing the bodies of insects. There is 
another family of Hymenoptera that have the oviposi- 
tor modified to form a saw, by means of which it saws 
little slits, for depositing eggs, in leaves or twigs. 




These are the sawflies, and 



great nuisances they are. If J j /Jjf^ 

Here is an enlarged picture y^ 
of the saw of one of them. 

There are two saws placed side by side, and these 
can be moved up and down. 

Yes, John ; it is only the female that has the saws, 
and so it is the mother of the family who wields this 
potent implement. 

The larva of some of the sawflies look like cater- 
pillars, only they have from twelve to sixteen prolegs, 
while true caterpillars, as you know, do not have more 
than ten, with the exception of the Flannel moths. 
Who remembers how many legs the caterpillars of 
the Flannel njoths have ? 
Yes, May; they have the large number of 
fourteen. 

You can recognize the caterpillarlike larvae 
' of the sawflies generally by their queer habit 
of turning the abdomen sideways. 






Yes, we have had a full summer and have become 
acquainted with a good many interesting insect folk. 
We have by no means become acquainted with all, nor 
do we know everything about those we have watched. 

But we have seen and learned enough to enable us to 
understand something of what we see going on about 
us in the insect world, and enough to make us interested 
in what we may afterwards read about the insect folk. 

The books and magazines will keep informing us, and, 
best of all, let us keep ^\ on looking for ourselves. 

After all. that m ^ );/ / the best way tu learn. 









PREFATORY NOTE 


In these days many strange, true stories 
about animals are being written and read, 
but it seems to me that some of our most 
intimate and interesting animal compan- 
ions are being overlooked. So I have 
tried to write about a few of them. These 
stories are true. I know this, for Mary 
and I have really seen almost every- 
thing I have told; and they seem to 
us strange. If there have slipped into 
the stories occasional slight attempts to 
show some reason for the strange things 
or to point an unobtrusive moral, it is 
because the teacher¡¯s habit has over- 
come the story-teller¡¯s intention. So the 
slips may be pardoned. 

Of course I recognize that it is taking 
great chances nowadays with one¡¯s repu- 




tation for honesty and truth-telling to 
write or tell stories about animal behav- 
ior. Nature writers seem to be held, as 
a class, not to be above suspicion. But 
is a truthful man to be kept silent by 
criticism or abuse, or, on the other hand, 
is he to surrender, even for cash, to bad 
examples? I call out, ¡°No!¡± and beat 
on the table as I say this until the pens 
and paper hop, and Mary asks, ¡°No 
what?¡± Which reminds me that I must 
make some exception to my sweeping 
declaration of the truth of the whole of 
this little book. I am not responsible 
for Mary! She is, bless her, a child of 
dreams, and sometimes her dreams get 
into her talk. So some of Mary in this 
book is fancy; but the beasties and their 
doings are ¡ª I say it again ¡ª true, quite 
true.

I FIRST got acquainted with Mary when 
she was collecting tarantula holes. This 
appealed to me strongly. It was so much 
more interesting than collecting postmarks 
or even postage-stamps. 

It is part of my work, the part which is 
really my play ¡ª to go out and look at 
things. To do the same, I found out, is 
Mary¡¯s play ¡ª which is, of course, her most 
serious employment. We easily got ac- 
quainted when we first met, and made an 
arrangement to go out and look at things, 
and collect some of them, together. So 
after Mary had shown me that collecting 
tarantula holes is really quite simple ¡ª al- 
though at first thought of ic you may not 
think so ¡ª I proposed to her to come along 


and help me collect a few wasp holes. They 
are smaller of course than tarantula holes 
and do not make quite such a fine showing 
when you get them home, but they have 
several real advantages over the spider bur- 
rows, only one of which I need tell you now. 
This one is, that you can watch the wasps 
make their holes because they do it in the 
daytime, while you can¡¯t watch the taran- 
tula make its hole because it does it at 
night. So Mary and I went together to 
the place of the wasps. 

I ought to tell you right away that Mary 
and I live in California. This explains to 
you partly why we are so happy in our 
rambles, because for any one whose work 
or whose) play it is to go out and look at 
things, California is a wonderfully good 
place to live in. In fact, I know of none 
better. But I should tell you more of 
where we live, because California is so many 
places at once; that is, so many different 
kinds of places, such as high mountains. 






burning deserts, great forests, fertile plains, 
salt lakes, blue ocean, low soft hills, wide 
level marshes, fragrant orchards, brilliant 
flower gardens, hot springs and volcanic 
cones, deep cafions and rushing rivers, ¡ª 0, 
indeed, almost all the kinds of places that 
the physical geography tells about. 

Mary and I live in a beautiful valley be- 
tween two ranges of mountains and very 
near the marsh-lined shores of a great ocean 
bay. Over beyond one range of mountains 
is the ocean itself stretching blue and rip- 
ply all the way to China, while beyond the 
other range of mountains is a desert with 
jackrabbits and burrowing owls and cac- 
tuses. Not the worst ¡ª or best ¡ª sort of 
desert like that far south toward Mexico, 
but one that gets a little rain, and hence 
is called a ¡°Land of Great Possibilities¡± 
by men who sell pieces of it now and then 
to people from Maine. 

It is easy for us to get from the little 
town in which we live to several very good 




places for looking at things. The foothills 
and mountain sides with their forests and 
coverts and swift little brooks; the orchards 
and flower gardens and grain and grass 
fields; the wide flat marshes with their salt- 
grass and pickle-weed, their wide channels 
and pools, and finally the bay itself; all 
are near by and all are fine places for 
observing and collecting things. 

When I met Mary first ¡ª the time she was 
collecting tarantula holes ¡ª we were on the 
gentle slopes of the lower foothills of the 
mountains. The big hairy tarantulas are 
very numerous there, although one rarely 
sees them because they mostly stay in their 
holes in daytime. There are tarantula 
hawks there too, enormous black and rusty- 
red wasps with wings stretching three 
inches from tip to tip. Mary and I saw 
one of these giant wasps swoop down on a 
big tarantula just as he came out of his 
hole one evening after sundown, and that 
was a battle to remember, and it had a 





very strange ending. The tarantula ¡ª but 
I must save that battle for another chapter 
all to itself. I must try and stick to the 
wasp holes in this one. 

It was a day in September. This month 
in California is the last one of the long, 
rainless, sun-filled summer, and everywhere 
it is very dry and brown. The valley floors 
and foothill slopes lie thirsty and cracking 
under the ardent sun, and a thin cover of 
fine dust lies on all the leaves of the live- 
oak and eucalyptus trees. Everything out 
of doors is waiting for the first rain. The 
birds are still and the frogs all hidden away. 
The insects buzz about rather heavily and 
keep pretty well under cover. If one wants 
to see much lowly life it is necessary to go 
to the banks of the few persisting streams 
or lakes or to the shores of bay or ocean. 
So Mary and I left the dry foothill 
slopes and their many silk-lined holes 
with a big black hairy tarantula sitting 
quietly at the bottom of each, and took 





the gently dropping dusty road to the 
marshes. 

I like the salt marshes of California. 
They are a change and relief, in their sooth- 
ing monotony and simple plant life, from 
the lush and variegated flower fields, the 
dense and hostile chaparral thickets, the 
dark forests of great trees, and the miles 
of artificial plantations of orchards and 
vines. On the marshes you are greater 
and more important than the plants. In 
an orchard or a giant-tree forest, you feel 
second-rate someway. The fruit-trees 
have men for servants, while to the giant 
trees with their outlook from a height of 
three hundred feet and their memories of 
two thousand years, a man is no more than 
an ant. But in the marshes you feel that 
you are much more important a kind of 
creature than the pickle-weed, and that is 
almost the only plant that grows there. 

There are 'many curious little bare dry 
spots in the marshes where we know it. 





Flat, smooth, salt-encrusted, clean white 
spots rather circular in outline, and per- 
haps twenty feet in diameter. All around 
is the low thick growth of fat-leaved pickle- 
weed, but for some reason it doesn¡¯t invade 
these pretty little empty rooms. Mary and 
I like to lie on the clean dry floor of one of 
these unroofed rooms and look up at the 
blue sky and out beyond the low side walls 
of pickle-weed far across the flat marsh 
stretches, over the shining bay, and on 
through the quivering blue to the beauti- 
ful mountains that bound our views on 
both sides. On clear afternoons we can 
see a gleaming white speck on the top of 
the highest mountain in the eastern range. 
That is the famous Lick Observatory, where 
the astronomers are looking always into 
the sky to read the riddle of the stars and 
planets and comets. We feel rather small, 
Mary and I, when we realize that we are 
only loafing or at best watching insignifi- 
cant little insects and collecting wasp holes 






that lie at our noses¡¯ ends, while those men 
up there are looking at wonders millions of 
miles away. But we are so interested and 
contented with our small doings and small 
wonders that we do not at all envy the 
astronomers on the mountain top. While 
they watch the conflagrations of the stars 
and the mighty sailing of the planets 
through the blackness of space, we watch 
the work and play and living of our lowly 
companions on the sun-flooded marshes. 
They like the cold glittering sky; we like 
the warm brown earth. 

We had been lying quietly on the white 
salt sand in one of the unroofed marsh 
rooms for some time this September day 
before we saw the first wasp begin to work. 
She was standing on her head, apparently, 
and biting most energetically with her jaws, 
cutting a little circle in the salt crust. 
When she got the circle all cut, she tugged 
and buzzed 'until she dug up, unbroken, 
the little circular piece (perhaps one-third 




ot an inch across) of crust. She dragged 
this about three inches away. Then she 
returned to the spot thus cleaned and dug 
out with her sharp jaws a bit or pellet of 
soil. Holding this in her mouth, she flew 
away about a foot and dropped it. Then 
came back. Then dug out another pellet 
of soil and carried and dropped it a foot or 
so away. Then back again and so on un- 
til it was plain that she was digging out a 
little cylindrical vertical hole or burrow. 
As the hole got deeper, the wasp had to 
crawl down into it, first with head and 
fore legs, then with head and half her body; 
finally her whole body, long legs, wings 
and all, was hidden as she dug deeper and 
deeper. She had to come out of the hole 
of course to carry away each bit of dug up 
soil. She always backed upward out of 
the burrow, and all the while she was dig- 
ging she kept up a low humming sound. 
It was this humming sound that attracted 
our attention to other narrow-waisted 



wasps like the first one. By moving about 
cautiously and listening and looking care- 
fully, we found more than a dozen others 
digging holes, each one going about the 
work just like every other one. 

When our first wasp had made its hole 
deep enough ¡ª this took a pretty long time; 
we found out later that it was about three 
inches deep ¡ª she brought back the first 
little circular piece of salt crust and care- 
fully put it over the top of the burrow, 
thus covering it up entirely and making it 
look as if no hole were there. Then she 
flew away, out of the little bare room and 
off into the pickle-weed somewhere. We 
waited several minutes but she didn¡¯t come 
back, so we turned our eyes to another 
wasp near by which had its hole only just 
begun. It was interesting to see how 
closely like the first wasp this second one 
worked. Prying and pulling with the jaws, 
the same fluttering of the wings and hum- 
ming, the same backing out of the hole and 




the swift little flight for a foot or two feet 
away from the hole to drop the pellet of 
soil. 

I tried to point out to Mary that this 
was the way animals do which work by 
instinct and not by reason. That all the 
animals of the same kind do things in the 
same way, and that they do them without 
any teaching or imitating or reasoning out. 
They are born with the knowledge and 
skill and the impulse to do the things in 
the particular way they do. But Mary 
found this very tiresome and let her eyes 
rove, and it is well she did or we might not 
have made our great (hscovery: a really 
thrilling discovery it was for us, too. 

The first wasp had come back! But not 
empty handed, or rather not empty 
mouthed, for in her pointed jaws she held 
a limp measuring-worm about an inch and 
a quarter long. A measuring-worm or 
looper is the caterpillar of a certain kind of 
moth, and it loops or measures when it 




walks because it has no feet on the middle 
of the under side of the body as other 
caterpillars have, and so has to draw its 
tail pretty nearly up its head to take a 
step forward. This naturally makes its 
body rise up in a fold or loop. ¡°See,¡± 
cried Mary, ¡°the wasp is going to put the 
measuring-worm into the hole.¡± 

That is exactly what happened. How 
the was]) could tell where the hole was, 
was surprising, for it had so carefully put 
the bit of salt crust in place that you 
couldn¡¯t tell the top of the hole from the 
rest of the crust-covered ground. But our 
wasp came straight to the right place. 
Perhaps as a carrier-])igcon comes to its 
loft from a hundred miles away, or a cat 
carried away in a bag to a strange place 
finds its way quickly back home. 

Some of the other wasps that we watched 
later weren¡¯t so sure of their holes, though, 
and other people who have watched digger- 
wasj)s in other places have found them 



showing varying degrees of uncertainty 
about locating their nests. Mr. and Mrs. 
Peckham, who have studied the behavior 
of the various kinds of digger-wasps more 
than anybody else in this country, have 
concluded that the wasps ¡°are guided in 
their movements by their memory of local- 
ities. They go from place to place quite 
readily because they are familiar with the 
details of the landscape in the district they 
inhabit. Fair eyesight and a moderately 
good memory on their part are all that 
need be assumed in this simple explana- 
tion of the problem.¡± 

But quite different from this conclusion 
is that of Fabre, the wonderful French ob- 
server of wasps, who experimented on them 
in regard to this matter of finding and know- 
ing their holes, by carrying them away 
shut up in a dark box to the center of a 
village three kilometers from the nesting 
ground, and releasing them after being 
kept all night in the dark boxes. These 




wasps when released in the busy town, cer- 
tainly a place never visited by them before, 
immediately mounted vertically to above 
the roofs and then instantly and energet- 
ically flew south, which was the direction of 
their holes. Nine separate wasps released 
one at a time did this without a moment¡¯s 
hesitation, and the next day Fabre found 
them all at work again at their hole-dig- 
ging. He knew them by two spots of white 
paint he had put on each one. 

¡°Are the wasps guided by memory when 
placed by man beyond their bearings and 
carried to great distances into regions with 
which they are unacquainted and in un- 
known directions?¡± asks Fabre. ¡°By 
memory so quick that when, having reached 
a certain height at which they can in some 
sort take their bearings, they launch them- 
selves with all their power of wing towards 
that part of the horizon where their nests 
are? Is it memory which traces their 
aerial way across regions seen for the first 





time? Evidently not,¡± emphatically de- 
clares Fabre. So there you are. Where 
doctors (of science) fall out it is not for you 
or me to decide. 

But Mary was growing excited. ¡°See, 
she has put the worm down and is prying 
up the top of the hole. She has got it off. 
She is¡ª¡± 

¡°Ss-h,¡± say I, for wasps can hear. Or, 
wait; that¡¯s quite dogmatic. Wasps fly 
away when you talk too loud. That¡¯s bet- 
ter. That¡¯s not judging wasp doing by 
what we can do. That is just telling an 
observed fact. 

Mary ¡°ssh¡±-ed, but she pointed a plump 
little finger; a finger trembling with ex- 
citement. The wasp had gone down into 
the uncovered hole with the worm. Then 
she backed out, found the lid, covered up 
the hole and flew away into the pickle- 
weed again! 

In twenty minutes she came back, with 
another limp measuring-worm, straight to 





the covered hole; worm dropped on the 
ground; lid taken off; worm dragged in; 
wasp backed out; lid carefully replaced; 
flight to the distant jungle of pickle- weed 
again! 

O, this was exciting. Mary fairly ex- 
ploded into exclamations and questions 
after the wasp was well away. What are 
the worms for? Are they dead? The 
second one seemed to wriggle feebly a little 
on the ground by the nest while the wasp 
was getting off the lid. Will she bring 
more? Will she fill the hole full of worms? 
Now I knew the answers to some of these 
questions, for I had been in this happy 
place before, but I wanted Mary to find 
out, to discover ¡ª exquisite and prideful 
pleasure ¡ª for herself. So I remained 
dumb. 

Three more times the wasp brought 
worms. Three more times went through 
all the performance. But the last time 
she didn¡¯t come up for a long time; that 




is, for several minutes, and when she did 
come, instead of putting the salt crust on 
the hole, she got a little pellet of soil and 
dropped it in; and then another, and many 
others. Sometimes she scraped them in 
with her front feet, but there weren¡¯t many 
bits of soil close enough for that, for she had 
carried them all a foot or so away as she 
brought them out of the hole. She worked 
very industriously: jumping and running 
about, making little buzzing leaps and 
flights, until she had quite filled up the 
hole with the five dead worms in the bot- 
tom. 

Then she did the most wonderful thing. 
With her fore feet she pawed and raked the 
surface until it was quite smooth, and with 
her jaws and horny head she pressed down 
and tamped the fine bits of soil until they 
were a little below the surface of the salt 
crust around the hole, and then she brought 
again the little circular lid or top of salt 
crust and carefully put it in the little de- 






pression on the top of the filled-in burrow, 
so that it fitted perfectly with the hard 
uncut salt crust around the hole¡¯s edge! 

This is true. Does it seem wonderful to 
you? Why? Because we think that other 
animals cannot do what would be a very 
simple thing indeed for us? Our wasp was 
evidently concealing the whereabouts of 
her worm-stored burrow. I don¡¯t say that 
she wanted to conceal it; or decided to con- 
ceal it; or even intended to conceal it. She 
was simply, I say, concealing it. That 
seems quite certain, doesn¡¯t it? Well, this 
action of cutting out and replacing the bit 
of salt crust over the burrow was about the 
simplest and most effective way of con- 
cealing the hole that could be reasoned 
out, if we ourselves were to undertake it. 
The wasp, and all the other wasps of the 
same kind in our marshes, concealed their 
holes in the way that our reason would 
suggest to us as the best way. But I do 
not say anything about the wasp¡¯s mental 





processes toward getting at this behavior. 
One thing is pretty sure. Among a score 
or hundred of us doing this work, there 
would be pretty sure to be some to do it in 
a different sort of way from the others. 
The wasps of the same kind all do it alike. 
Perhaps that is the chief difference between 
reason and instinct. 

But if our digger-wasp ¡ª whose name is 
Ammophila, the sand-lover ¡ª made Mary¡¯s 
and my eyes bulge out by her cleverness, 
what shall we think of that other Ammo- 
phila that Dr. Williston watched on the 
plains of Kansas, or that other one still 
which the Peckhams studied in Wisconsin? 
These other Ammophilas, instead of using 
their hard heads to tamp down the soil in 
the hole, hunted about until they found a 
suitable little stone which, held tightly in 
the jaws, was used as a tool to pack and 
smooth the dirt! And the Kansas wasp 
did another odd thing. Instead of making 
its hole of the same caliber or width all the 




way down, the upper half-inch or so was 
made of greater diameter than the rest of 
the burrow so that a little circular shelf 
ran around the inside of the hole half an 
inch below the top. Now when the clever 
Kansas wasp closed the burrow each time 
it went away to hunt for measuring-worms, 
it did it in a curious way. I quote the 
exact words of Professor Williston, the ob- 
server: "When the excavation had been 
carried to the required depth¡± ¡ª this is our 
professional way of saying, when the hole 
had been dug deep enough ¡ª "the wasp, 
after surveying the premises, flying away, 
soon returned with a large pebble in its 
mandibles, which it carefully deposited 
within the opening; then, standing over 
the entrance upon her four posterior feet, 
she rapidly and most amusingly scraped 
the dust, ¡®hand over hand¡¯ back beneath 
her till she had filled the hole above the 
stone to the tqp. [The stone of course was 
resting on the little circular shelf half an 



inch down in the hole.] . . . When she had 
heaped up the dirt to her satisfaction, she 
again flew away and immediately returned 
with a smaller pebble, perhaps an eighth 
of an inch in diameter, and then standing 
more nearly erect, with the front feet 
folded beneath her, she pressed down the 
dust all over and about the opening, 
smoothing off the surface and accompany- 
ing the action with a peculiar rasping 
sound.¡± 

Is this not a creature of wits, this Kansas 
wasp? And an undaunted worker? For 
each time she went away to get a nice 
fat looper, she covered up her hole in 
this elaborate way, and each time she 
came back, she had to remove the half- 
inch of tamped-down soil and the little 
covering stone resting on the shelf in 
the hole. 

The Peckhams, too, saw an Ammophila 
in Wisconsin use a pebble as a tool, and 
what is especially interesting and impor- 





tant, this wasp was only a single individual 
of several others watched by the observers, 
all these wasps being of one kind, that is, 
belonging to the same species. The tool- 
user thus revealed an individuality that 
made its actions seem to be dictated by 
something else than rigid instinct; cer- 
tainly so if instinct is to be defined as un- 
taught and unreasoned behavior common 
to all the individuals of a kind. In fact 
the Peckhams (most persistent, practised 
and intelligent observers) insist that ¡® ¡® in 
all the processes of Ammophila the char- 
acter of the work differs with the indi- 
vidual.¡± 

But where is Mary in all this digression 
of mine? Never fear for Mary. While I 
was mumbling about instinct and reason 
and automatism and individual idiosyn- 
crasy, Mary was crawling slowly and cau- 
tiously about over the salt-crust floor of 
our room, counting the wasp holes in course 
of making, and she was making a second 





discovery. The measuring-worms, limp 
and lifeless as they appeared, were really 
not dead! She had seen at least two, left 
lying on the ground by the hole while the 
wasp prized off the cover, give feeble wrig- 
gles, and one that she poked with a pin 
squirmed rather energetically. That is, it 
did if she poked it at one end, but not if 
she poked it in the middle, which is such a 
great discovery .that it really gets to be 
science! 

Now as one is entitled to take violent 
measures for the sake of science, Mary and 
I decided after considerable serious discus- 
sion to ¡°collect¡± the hole which our wasp 
had finished and apparently left for good. 
So we dug it up, and on the spot we exam- 
ined it and all of its insides. And we found 
it quite true that the loopers were not dead, 
but they were paralyzed! When we poked 
a head or tail, each worm could squirm just 
a little, but if we touched them in the mid- 
dle, they didn't know it, and on one of 





them, the top one, we found a little shin- 
ing white speck. 

Mary¡¯s excitement became merged into 
an intense thoughtfulness. Then she cried 
aloud with eyes shining: ¡°My, its the egg! 
the egg of the wasp! and the worms are for 
food for the young wasp when it hatches!¡¯¡¯ 

Ah, Mary, you have wits! Have you 
ever heard any one tell about this? Did 
you really guess it, or pot guess it, but 
actually reason it out for yourself? Mary, 
I have great hopes of you. 

For it is quite true what Mary says. The 
little white seed-like thing glued on to the 
last looper¡¯s body is the egg of the wasp, 
and the stung and paralyzed but not killed 
measuring-worms are the food stored up 
by this extremely clever narrow-waisted 
mother for the wingless, footless, blind, 
almost helpless wasp grub, when it shall 
hatch from the egg. Down in the dark- 
ness of the cell, there will be a horrible 
tragedy. For days and weeks together the 



wasp grub will nibble away on the helpless 
loopers until all five are eaten alive! Then 
the grub will change to a winged wasp with 
strong sharp jaws with which she will dig 
her way up and out of the noisome prison 
and into the free air and sunlight of the 
marsh room. And she will then dig holes 
of her own, find and sting and store loopers, 
lay an egg on one, and close up the hole just 
as her mother did. Or at least all this 
would happen if we hadn¡¯t collected the 
hole. But it will happen in the other holes. 

But why should the loopers be only par- 
alyzed instead of killed? Isn¡¯t it plain 
that if killed they would only be decaying 
carrion by the time the wasp grub was 
ready to eat them, and young wasps must 
have fresh meat, not dead and decayed 
flesh. And if the loopers were simply put 
in alive, not paralyzed, wouldn¡¯t their vio- 
lent squirming in the hole surely crush the 
delicate egg or the more delicate newly 
hatched wasp grub? Or wouldn¡¯t they 





simply dig their way with their heavy jaws 
out of the hole and away? Or, indeed, 
could the slender-bodied mother wasp carry 
and handle successfully a strong squirming 
looper over an inch long? The reason for 
the paralyzing of the worms is plain then. 
But how is this extraordinary condition 
brought about? And the answer to this, 
which Mary and I didn¡¯t discover for our- 
selves, but had to find out from the 
accounts of the men who did, like Fabre 
and others, reveals the most extraordinary 
thing that our wasps do. Most people 
think the wasps that live in communities 
or large families in big paper nests (the 
yellow- jackets and hornets) are the most 
interesting and most intelligent or clever 
of the wasps. But Mary and I do not 
think so. The solitary wasps do the most 
wonderful things, and of all they do, the 
paralyzing of the insects they store up as 
food for their young is the hardest to 
explain on any basis except that of wasp 



reasoning. But of course we don¡¯t have to 
explain it, which is fortunate for the high 
record of truth we are trying to establish 
in this book. 

Fabre, the patient Frenchman, waited 
for years and years for a chance to see just 
how the Ammophila paralyzes her victims, 
and at last he saw and understood it. To 
understand the matter from Fabre¡¯s ac- 
count of it, we must remember that the 
measuring-worm¡¯s body is made up of a 
series of rings or body segments, in each 
of which (except the very last) is a little 
nerve center or brain situated just under 
the skin on the under side of the body. And 
all this row of brains is connected by a 
slender nerve cord running along the mid- 
dle line of the under side of the long body. 
Now Fabre saw that the wasp darted its 
sting into each looper, ¡°once for all at the 
fifth or sixth segment of the victim.¡± And 
when he pricked the stung worms with a 
needle in various parts of the body, he 



found, just as Mary did, that the needle 
could entirely pierce the middle of the body 
(which is where the fifth and sixth segments 
are), without causing any movement of the 
worm. ¡°But prick even slightly a seg- 
ment in front or behind and the caterpillar 
struggles with a violence proportioned to 
the distance from the poisoned segment.¡± 

Now what is the reason, asks Fabre, for 
the wasp¡¯s selecting this particular spot for 
stinging the worm, and he answers his own 
question as follows: 0 *^H 

¡°The loopers have the following organi- 
zation, counting the head as the first seg- 
ment: Three pairs of true feet on rings two, 
three, and four; four pairs of membranous 
feet on rings seven, eight, nine, and ten, 
and a last similar pair set on the thirteenth 
and final ring; in all eight pairs of feet, the 
first seven making two marked groups ¡ª 
one of three, the other of four pairs. These 
two groups are divided by two segments 
without feet, which are the fifth and sixth. 




¡°Now, to deprive the caterpillar of 
means of escape, and to render it motion- 
less, will the Hymenopteron [that¡¯s the 
wasp] dart its sting into each of the eight 
rings provided with feet? Especially will 
it do so when the prey is small and weak? 
Certainly not: a single stab will suffice if 
given in a central spot, whence the torpor 
produced by the venomous droplet can 
spread gradually . with as little delay as 
possible into the midst of those segments 
which bear feet. There can be no doubt 
which to choose for this single inoculation; 
it must be the fifth or sixth, which separate 
the two groups of locomotive rings. The 
point indicated by rational deduction is 
also the one adopted by instinct. Finally, 
let us add that the egg of the Ammophila 
is invariably laid on the paralyzed ring. 
There, and there alone, can the young larva 
bite without inducing dangerous contor- 
tions; where a needle prick has no effect, 
the bite of a grub will have none either. 





and the prey will remain immovable until 
the nursling has gained strength and can 
bite farther on without danger.¡± 

But some Ammophilas catch much larger 
caterpillars than the inch-long, slender, lit- 
tle loopers. Fabre found a wasp dragging 
to its nest a caterpillar weighing fifteen 
times the weight of the wasp. Does one 
stab suffice for such a giant caterpillar? 
Here is what Fabre saw: An Ammophila 
was noticed scratching in the ground around 
the crown of a plant. She was ¡°pulling up 
little grass roots, and poking her head under 
the tiny clods which she raised up, and run- 
ning hurriedly, now here, now there, round 
the thyme, visiting every crack which gave 
access under it; yet she was not digging a 
burrow, but hunting something hidden un- 
derground, as was shown by manoeuvres 
like those of a dog trying to get a rabbit 
out of its hole. And presently, disturbed 
by what was going on overhead and closely 
tracked by the Ammophila, a big gray 




worm made up his mind to quit his abode 
and come up to daylight. It is all over 
with him; the hunter is instantly on the 
spot, gripping the nape of his neck and 
holding on in spite of his contortions. Set- 
tled on the monster¡¯s back, the Ammophila 
bends her abdomen, and, methodically, de- 
liberately ¡ª ^like a surgeon thoroughly fa- 
miliar with the anatomy of his subject ¡ª 
plunges a lancet into the ventral surface of 
every segment, from the first to the last. 
Not one ring is omitted; with or without 
feet each is stabbed in due order from the 
front to the back.¡± 

This is what the patient, careful observer 
saw, with all the ¡°leisure and ease required 
for an irreproachable observation.¡± ¡°The 
wasp acts,¡± says Fabre, ¡°with a precision 
of which science might be jealous; it knows 
what man but rarely knows; it is acquaint- 
ed with the complex nervous system of its 
victim, and keeps repeated stabs for those 
with numerous ganglia. I said Tt knows; 




is acquainted¡¯ ; what I ought to say is, ¡®It 
acts as if it did.¡¯ What it does is suggested 
to it; the creature obeys, impelled by in- 
stinct, without reasoning on what it does. 
But whence comes this sublime instinct? 
Can theories of atavism, of selection, of the 
struggle for life, interpret it reasonably?¡± 

When I had finished reading this to Mary 
she looked up and said softly; ¡°Of course 
I don¡¯t understand all this that he says 
about ¡®avatism and selection¡¯ and so on, 
but I think the wasp knows. Don¡¯t you?¡¯¡¯ 

¡°Mary,¡± I reply promptly, ¡°the word is 
¡®atavism,¡¯ not ¡®avatism,¡¯ please remem- 
ber!¡¯¡¯ 

¡°I hope I can,¡± said Mary. 





The meadow lark on the fence post be- 
hind my house is unusually voluble this 
uncertain morning; maybe he is getting 
his day¡¯s singing off before the sun shall 
hide, discomfited,^ ^behind the unrolling 
cloud furls. A solemn grackle, with yellow 
eyes and bronzed neck, stalks with cocking 
head in the wet green of the well-groomed 
front lawn; a whisking bevy of gold- 
finches, which chat to each other in high- 
pitched hurried phrases, disposes itself with 
much concern in the bare tree across the 
road, and swinging along overhead, a wood- 
pecker cries its harsh greetings. But the 
hfe here on the street is tame and usual 
compared to that busy living and to those 
eventful happenings taking place in a re- 



moter corner of the garden. There where 
the warm dust is figured with the dainty 
tracks of the quail hosts and the flower- 
flies hum their contentedest note; there 
in that half-artificial, half-wild covert of 
odorous vegetation, a life in miniature, with 
the excitement and stresses, the failures 
and successes and the inevitable comedies 
and tragedies of any world of life is going 
on, with the history of it all unrecorded. 

Mary has just cdfne to call on me, bring- 
ing an unkempt bouquet of Scotch broom 
from the garden. On these branches of 
broom are many conspicuous white spots. 
They are not flowers, for it is not broom 
flower time, and the flowers are yellow when 
their time does come. But these white 
spots, soft little cottony masses, like little 
pillows or cushions, and with regular tiny 
flutings along the top, have puzzled Mary, 
and she has come to ask me about them, 
for I am supf)Osed to know all things. Well, 
luckily, I do happen to know about these. 







but I suggest that we go into the garder 
together and see if we can find out. Th( 
truth is, I am glad of an excuse to get awa) 
from this tiresome German book aboui 
Entwicklungslehre. And then, too, I wani 
to look at things and talk with Mary. 

Mary has such a fascinatingly serioui 
way of doing things that aren¡¯t serious ai 
all. She has got the curious notion latel) 
that many little people live among th( 
grasses, the grass people she calls them, anc 
that that is the reason there are so man] 
very little white flowers coming up ini m3 
lawn. My own notion had been that som* 

ij 

rascally seedsman had sold me unclear 
grass seed, but Mary¡¯s notion that the grisi 
people are planting and raising these litt^ 
flowers for their own special delectation is 
of course, a much wiser one. So when w< 
walk on the lawn, we go very slowly, and ] 
have to poke constantly among the grasses 
with my stick as we move along so that th< 
little people may know we are coming anc 






have time to scurry away from under our 
great boots. 

When we got out to the row of brooms, 
we found many of the soft white cushions 
on all the bushes. But some of them were 
torn and dishevelled. And in these torn 
masses many tiny round particles could be 
seen. These little black specks are simply 
eggs, insect eggs, as I told Mary, and soon 
she had discovered among them some 
slightly larger but still very small red spots 
which were waving tiny black feet and 
feelers about. They were of course the 
baby insects just hatching from the eggs. 

¡°Does the mother lay the eggs in these 
little white cushions and then go away and 
leave them?¡± asks Mary. 

¡°No, she stays right by them,¡± I answer. 

¡°But where is she then? I can¡¯t ¡ª Yes 
I can too,¡± cries Mary in great triumph. 
¡°Here she is at one end of the egg cushion. 
She is a part ¡®of it.¡± 

¡°Well, no, not exactly,¡± I have to say. 




¡°It is part of her, or rather she spins the 
cushion, which is really a sac or soft box 
of white wax, in which to lay her eggs. 
Something the way the spiders do, you 
know. Only their egg box is made of silk 
and usually fastened to a fence rail or on 
the bark of a tree and left there. But some 
of the spiders, the large, swiftly running, 
black kinds that live under stones, carry 
the silken ball with the eggs inside about 
with them, fastened to the end of the body. 
Well, this cottony cushion scale insect ¡ª 
that¡¯s its right name ¡ª keeps its waxen sac 
of eggs fastened to it, but as the egg sac is 
much larger than the insect itself, it can¡¯t 
run about any more, but has to stay for all 
the rest of the time until it dies in the spot 
where it makes the sac. However, as it 
gets all the food it wants by sticking its 
slender little beak into the broom or other 
plant it is on and sucking up the fresh sap, 
it gets on very well.¡± 

¡°But what makes some of the egg cush- 




ions ¡ª how pretty they arc, too! ¡ª so torn 
and pulled open,¡± asks Mary, who has lis- 
tened to my long speech very nicely. She 
often gets impatient when I lecture for too 
many minutes together. 

¡°That is for you to find out,¡± I say. 
¡°There is a dreadful thing going on here if 
you can only see it. But a rather good 
thing too. Good for the broom bushes 
anyway, and as they are my broom bushes 
and I like their flowers, good for me.¡± 

Just then a very stubby, round-backed, 
quick little red beetle with black spots 
walked off a broom stem on to Mary¡¯s hand. 
She didn¡¯t scream, of course, nor even jerk 
her hand away. She may learn when she 
is older to be frightened when pretty, harm- 
less, little lady-bird beetles walk on her. 
But now she likes all sorts of small animals, 
and is not afraid at all. 

Mary is not at all slow to understand 
things, and when this hard-bodied little 
beetle, with a body like half a red-and-black 


pill, walked oh the broom on to her hand, 
she guessed that he might have something 
to do with the torn-up egg cushions. So it 
didn¡¯t take her long to find another little 
beast like him actually nosing about in an 
egg sac and voraciously snapping up all the 
unfortunate tiny, red, black-legged baby 
scale insects. He ate the eggs, too, and 
seemed to take some bites at the mother 
insect herself, and then Mary found more 
of the lady-bird beetle's, and still more. 
They were on all the broom bushes where 
the white cushions were. And so one of 
the dreadful tragedies going on in my gar- 
den was soon quite plain to Mary, and she 
was very sorry for the helpless white in- 
sects. 

¡°Where did the red beetles come from?¡± 
she asked pretty soon. 

¡°From Australia,¡± I answered. ¡°Or 
rather their great-great-grandparents did. 
These particular beetles were probably born 
right here in the garden, because a colony 





of them live here. But they couldn¡¯t if 
there were not some cottony cushion scale 
insects here too. For this particular kind 
of lady-bird beetle can¡¯t live on any other 
food ¡ª at least they don¡¯t ¡ª except this par- 
ticular kind of scale insect and its eggs, 
which is surely a curious thing, isn¡¯t it?¡± 

But Mary is so used to finding that the 
insects have extremely unusual and curious 
habits ¡ª that is, habits different from ours 
¡ª that she doesn¡¯t get excited any more 
when I tell her about them. She does 
though when she finds them out for her- 
self, which makes me wonder if I haven¡¯t 
wasted a good deal of time in my life giv- 
ing lectures to students about things in- 
stead of always making them find out for 
themselves. And maybe I am wasting 
some more time now while I am writing! 

¡°How did they come from Australia?¡± 
asks Mary. For she knows that Australia 
is several thousand miles away across the 
ocean from California, and lady-bird beetles 





do not swim. At least not from Australia 
to America. So I have to give Mary an- 
other informing lecture, and this is it: 

¡°Years and years ago, there lived in some 
fragrant-leaved orange-trees in Australia 
some white cottony cushion insects whose 
life was untroubled by other cares than 
those of eating and of looking after the 
children. As each insect was fastened for 
life on the leaf or twig that supplied it with 
all the food it needed, which was simply an 
occasional drink of sap, and as the white 
insects always died before their children 
were born, neither of these cares was very 
harassing. On thousands of other similar 
fragrant-leaved orange-trees in Australia 
lived millions of other similar white insects. 
And for a long time this race of white in- 
sects enjoyed life. Those were happy days. 
But on a time there came into one of the 
trees a few small red beetles, who eagerly 
and persistently set about the awful busi- 
ness of eating the defenceless white insects. 




From this tree the red beetles, or the chil- 
dren of them, went to other trees where 
white insects lived, and with unrelenting 
rapacity and uncloyed appetite ate all the 
white insects they could find. And so in 
other trees; and finally, with years, the red 
beetles had invaded all of the thousands of 
fragrant-leaved orange-trees in Australia, 
and had eaten nearly all of the millions of 
white insects. 

¡°One day a very small orange-tree was 
taken out of the ground in Australia and 
sent with many others across the ocean to 
California. On this small tree there were 
a few of the white insects. The little tree 
was planted again in California and soon 
put out many fresh fragrant leaves. The 
white insects were astonished and rejoiced 
that day after day went by without the ap- 
pearance of any red beetles. The white 
insects increased in numbers; there were 
thousands of fragrant-leaved orange-trees 
in California, and in a few years there were 



millions of white insects in them. One 
morning a man stood among the trees and 
said, 'Confound these bugs; they¡¯ll ruin me; 
what shall I do?¡¯ and a man who knew said, 
¡®Get some red beetles from Australia.¡¯ So 
this orange-grower, with some others, paid 
a man to go to Australia and collect some 
live red beetles. The collector went across 
the ocean, three weeks¡¯ steady steaming, and 
sent back a few of the voracious little bee- 
tles in a pill box. They were put into a 
tree in a California orange-orchard in which 
there were many cottony cushion scale in- 
sects. The red insects promptly began eat- 
ing the white ones; and their children and 
grandchildren and great-grandchildren 
have kept up this eating ever since. And 
so the orange-growers never tire of telling 
how the red beetles (whose name is Veda- 
lia) were brought from Australia to save 
them from ruin by the white insects (whose 
name is Icerya).¡± 

Now there are not many cottony cush- 





ion scales left in CaUforina. A very prom- 
ising colony of them seems to have sprung 
up in my Scotch broom bushes. But the 
red beetles have found their way there 
already, as Mary and I discovered to-day, 
and so we think that by the time the broom 
flowers come, there will be few white in- 
sects left in the bushes. 









This is the story of a fight. In the first 
story of this book, I said that Mary and I 
had seen a remarkable fight one evening at 
sundown on the slopes of the bare brown 
foothills west of the campus. It was not 
a battle of armies ¡ª we have seeii\th^^f, too, 
in the little world we watch, ¡ª but a com- 
bat of gladiators, a struggle between two 
champions born and bred for fighting, and 
particularly for fighting each other. One 
champion was Eurypelma, the great, black, 
hairy, eight-legged, strong-fanged taran- 
tula of California, and the other was Pepsis, 
a mighty wasp in dull-blue mail, with rusty- 
red wings and a poisonous javelin of a 
sting that might well frighten either you 
or me. Do you have any wasp in your 




neighborhood of the ferocity and strength 
and size of Pepsis? If not, you can hardly 
realize what a terrible creature she is. 
With her strong hard-cased body an inch 
and a half long, borne on powerful wings 
that expand fully three inches, and her 
long and strong needle-pointed sting that 
darts in and out like a flash and is always 
full of virulent poison, Pepsis is certainly 
queen of all the wasp amazons. But if 
tbcit is PC, no less is Eurypelma greatest, 
most areadful, and fiercest, and hence king, 
of all the spiders in this country. In South 
America and perhaps elsewhere in the 
tropics, live the fierce bird-spiders with 
thick legs extending three inches or more 
on each side of their ugly hairy bodies. 
Eurypelma, the California tarantula, is not 
quite so large as that, nor does he stalk, 
pounce on and kill little birds as his South 
American cousin is said, to do, but he is 
nevertheless a tremendous and fear-inspir- 
ing creature among the small beasties of 
field and meadow. 








But not all Eurypelmas are so ferocious; 
or at least are not ferocious all the time. 
There are individual differences among 
them. Perhaps it is a matter of age or 
health. Anyway, I had a pet tarantula 
which I kept in an open jar in my room 
for several weeks, and I could handle him 
with impunity. He would sit gently on 
my hand, or walk deliberately up my arm, 
with his eight, fixed, shining, little reddish 
eyes staring hard at me,¡°apc| hi^ long 
seven-jointed hairy legs swinging gently 
and rhythmically along, without a sign of 
hesitation or excitement. His hair was 
almost gray and perhaps this hoariness 
and general sedateness betokened a ripe 
old age. But his great fangs were un- 
blunted, his supply of poison undiminished, 
and his skill in striking and killing his 
prey still perfect, as often proved at his 
feeding times. He is quite the largest 
Eurypelma I have ever seen. ' He measures 
¡ª ^for I still have his body, carefully stuffed. 



and fastened on a block with legs all 
spread out ¡ª live inches from tip to tip of 
opposite legs. 

At the same time that I had this hoary 
old tarantula, I had another smaller, coal- 
black fellow who went into a perfect ecstasy 
of anger and ferocity every time any one 
came near him. He would stand on his 
hind legs and paw wildly with fore legs and 
palpi, and lunge forward fiercely at my 
inquisitive^ pciicit I found him originally 
in the niiddle of an entry into a classroom, 
holding at bay an entire excited class of 
art students armed with mahl-sticks and 
paint-brushes. The students were mostly 
women, and I was hailed as deliverer and 
greatest dompteur of beasts when I scooped 
Eurypelma up in a bottle and walked off 
with him. 

But this is not telling of the sundown 
fight that Mary and I saw together. We 
had been over to the sand-cut by the golf 
links, after mining-bees, and were coming 




home with a fine lot of their holes and 
some of the bees themselves, when Mary 
suddenly called to me to ¡°see the nice 
tarantula.¡± 

Perhaps nice isn¡¯t the best word for him, 
but he certainly was an unusually impos- 
ing and fluffy-haired and fierce-looking 
brute of a tarantula. He had rather an 
owly way about him, as if he had come 
out from his hole too early and was dazed 
and half-blinded by the light. Tarantulas 
are night prowlers; they do all their hunt- 
ing after dark, dig their holes and, indeed, 
carry on all the various businesses of their 
life in the night-time. The occasional one 
found walking about in daytime has made 
a mistake, someway, and he blunders 
around quite like an owl in the sunshine. 

All of a sudden, while Mary and I were 
smiling at this too early bird of a taran- 
tula, he went up on his hind legs in fight- 
ing attitude, and at the same instant down 
darted a great tarantula hawk, that is, a 




Pepsis wasp. Her armored body glinted 
cool and metallic in the red sunset light, 
and her great wings had a suggestive shin- 
ing of dull fire about them. She checked 
her swoop just before reaching Eurypelma, 
and made a quick dart over him, and then 
a quick turn back, intending to catch the 
tarantula in the rear. But lethargic and 
owly as Eurypelma had been a moment 
before, he was now all alertness and agility. 

-A * 

He had to be. He was defending his life. 
One full fair stab of the poisoned javelin, 
sheathed but ready at the tip of tlie flexi- 
ble, blue-black body hovering over him, 
and it would be over with Eurypelma. 
And he knew it. Or perhaps he didn¡¯t. But 
he acted as if he did. He was going to do 
his best not to be stabbed; that was sure. 
And Pepsis was going to do her best to 
stab; that also was quickly certain. 

At the same time Pepsis knew ¡ª or any- 
way acted as if she did ¡ª that to be struck 
by one or both of those terrible vertical, 





poison-filled fangs was sure death. It 
would be like a blow from a battle-axe, 
with the added horror of mortal poison 
poured into the wound. 

So Eurypelma about-faced like a flash, 
and Pepsis was foiled in her strategy. She 
flew up and a yard away, then returned 
to the attack. She flew about in swift 
circles over his head, preparatory to darting 
in again. But Iturypelma was ready. As 
she swooped viciously do>vn, he lunged up 
and forward with a half-leap, half-forward 
fall, and came within an ace of striking the 
trailing blue-black abdomen with his reach- 
ing fangs. Indeed it seemed to Mary and 
me as if they really grazed the metallic 
body. But evidently they had not pierced 
the smooth armor. Nor had Pepsis in that 
breathless moment of close quarters been 
able to plant her lance. She whirled up, 
high this time but immediately back, al- 
though a little more wary ¡®evidently, for 
she checked her downward plunge three 




or four inches from the dancing champion 
on the ground. And so for wild minute 
after minute it went on; Eurypelrna always 
up and tip-toeing on those strong hind legs, 
with open, armed mouth always toward 
the point of attack, and Pepsis ever dart- 
ing down, up, over, across, and in and 
out in dizzy dashes, but never quite 
closing. 

Were Mary and I excited? Not a word 
could we utter>-only now and then a swift 
intake of breath; a stifled ¡°0¡± or ¡°Ah¡± 
or ¡°See.¡± And then of a sudden came the 
end. Pepsis saw her chance. A lightning 
swoop carried her right on to the hairy 
champion. The quivering lance shot home. 
The poison coursed into the great soft body. 
But at the same moment the terrible fangs 
struck fair on the blue armor and crashed 
through it. Two awful wounds, and the 
wings of dull fire beat violently only to 
strike up a little cloud of dust and whirl 
the mangled body around and around. 




Fortunately Death was merciful, and the 
brave amazon made a quick end. 

But what of Eurypelma, the killer? Was 
it well with him? The sting-made wound 
itself was of little moment; it closed as 
soon as the lancet withdrew. But not be- 
fore the delicate poison sac at its base in- 
side the wasp-body had contracted and 
squirted down the slender hollow of the 
sting a drop of liquid fire. And so it was 
not well with Eurypelma in his insides. 
Victor he seemed to be, but if he could 
think, he must have had grave doubts 
about the joys of victory. 

For a curious drowsiness was coming 
over him. Perhaps, disquieting thought, it 
was the approaching stupor of the poison¡¯s 
working. His strong long legs became 
limp, they would not work regularly, they 
could not hold his heavy hairy body up 
from the ground. He would get into his 
hole and rest. But it was too late. And 
after a few uneven steps, victor Eury- 




pelma settled heavily down beside his 
amazon victim, inert and forevermore 
beyond fighting. He was paralyzed. 

And so Mary and I brought him home 
in our collecting box, together with the 
torn body of Pc})sis with her wings of slow 
fire dulled by the dust of her last struggles. 
And though it is a whole month now since 
Eurypclma received his stab from the poi- 
soned javelin of Pepsis, he has not recov- 
ered; nor will he ever. When you touch 
him, he draws up slowly one leg after 
another, or moves a palpus feebly. But it 
is living death; a hopeless paralytic is the 
king. 

Dear reader, you are of course as bright 
as Mary, and so you have noticed, as she 
did right away, the close j)arallel between 
what ha])pencd to Eurypelma and what 
happened to the measuring-worms brought 
by Ammophila to her nest burrow as de- 
scribed in the first story in this book. And 
so, like Mary, yon realize that the vendetta 





or life feud between the tarantula family 
and the family of Pepsis, the tarantula 
hawk, is based on reasons of domestic 
economy rather than on those of sentiment, 
which determine vendettas in Corsica and 
feuds in Kentucky. 

To be quite j)lain, Pepsis fights Eury- 
pelma to get his huge, juicy body for food 
for her young; and Eurypelma fights Pepsis 
to keep from becoming paralyzed proven- 
der. If Pepsis had escaped unhurt in the 
combat at which Mary and I ¡± assisted,¡± as 
the French say, as enthralled spectators, 
we should have seen her drag by mighty 
effort the limp, paralyzed, spider giant to 
her nest hole not far distant ¡ª a great hole 
twelve inches deep and with a side cham- 
ber at the bottom. There she would have 
thrust him down the throat of the burrow, 
and then crawled in and laid an egg on the 
helpless beast, from which in time would 
have hatched the carnivorous ¡®wasp grub. 
Pepsis has many close allies among the 





wasps, all black or steely blue with smoky 
or dull-bronze wings, and they all use 
spiders, stung and paralyzed, to store 
their nest holes with. 

¡°Do the little black and blue wasps 
hunt the little spiders and the larger ones 
the big spiders?¡± asks Mary. 

¡°Exactly,¡± I respond, ¡°and the giant 
wasp of them all, Pepsis, the queen of the 
wasp amazons, hunts only the biggest 
spider of them all, Eurypelma, the taran- 
tula king, and we have seen her do it.¡± 

¡°Well,¡± says Mary, ¡°even if she wants 
him for her children to eat, it¡¯s a real ben- 
detta, isn¡¯t it?¡± 

¡°Indeed it is,¡± I answer, ¡° it¡¯s more real, 
and fiercer, and more relentless, and more 
persistent than any human vendetta that 
ever was. For every Pepsis mother in the 
world is always hunting for Eurypelmas to 
fight. And not all Corsicans have a ven- 
detta on hand, nor all Kentuckians a 
feud.¡± 






¡°It seemed that some one was calling 
to me in a whisper ¡ª ¡®Sahib! Sahib! Sa- 
hib!¡¯ exactly as my bearer used to call me 
in the mornings. I fancied that I was de- 
lirious until a handful of sand fell at my 
feet. Then I looked up and saw a head 
peering down into the amphitheater ¡ª the 
head of Dunnoo, my dog-boy, who at- 
tended to my collies. As soon as he had 
attracted my attention, he held up his 
hand and showed a rope. I motioned, 
staggering to and fro the while, that he 
should throw it down. It was a couple of 
leather punkah-ropes knotted together, 
with a loop at one end. I s]ipj)ed the loop 
over my head and under my arms; heard 
 






Dunnoo urge something forward; was con 
scious that I was being dragged, face down- 
ward, up the steep sand-slope, and the 
next instant found myself choked and 
half-fainting on the sand-hills overlooking 
the crater.¡± 

And then Mary broke in. We were ly- 
ing in a sunny warm spot on an open hill- 
side a little way off the road, and I was 
reading aloud from a favorite author. 

¡°That is a fairy story,¡± said Mary, ¡°and 
I thought we were not going to read any 
more fairy stories now that I am grown 
up.¡± 

Mary¡¯s idea of being grown up is to be 
more than three feet eleven inches high 
and to have her hair no longer in two 
braids. 

¡°Not exactly a fairy story,¡± I replied. 
¡°For Kipling rather prefers soldiers to 
fairies and machines to caps of invisibility. 
Of course, though, he wrote the Mowgli 
stories.¡± 




¡°But those are not fairy stories,¡± inter- 
rupted Mary. ¡°Those were about a real 
boy and real animals only a long way off 
and different from ours.¡± 

¡°Ah-um, real? Well, perhaps; any- 
way, the Mowgli animals seem more real 
than most real animals. But this story of 
the sand-pit and the man sliding down 
into it and not being able to get out isn¡¯t 
impossible at all. Only the other people 
down in the bottom seem a little unusual.¡± 

¡°No, there can¡¯t be any such place,¡± 
said Mary positively, ¡°and as there can¡¯t 
be any such place, nobody could have slid 
into it or been in the bottom, and so it is 
a fairy story. Any story that isn¡¯t so is a 
fairy story.¡± 

¡°Well, that makes it easy to tell a fairy 
story from the other kinds, and I never 
knew exactly how before. But I once saw 
a place much like the sand-pit that Mor- 
rowbie Jukes slid into, or thit Kipling 
says he slid into. It is on the side of a 




great mountain in Oregon; Mt. Hood its 
name is. I had climbed far above timber 
line, that is, above where all the trees and 
bushes stop because it is too cold for them 
to live, and there is only bare rocks and 
snow and ice, and had sat down to rest 
near a great snowbank a mile long. As I 
looked back down the mountain I saw a 
curious yellowish smoke rising in little 
puffs and curls. I decided find out 
about this smoke on my way down; per- 
haps it was the beginning of a forest fire, 
and ought to be put out. 

¡°Well, when I got to it there was no 
fire; the puffs and curls were not smoke. 
It was a real Morrowbie Jukes pit; a great 
crater-like hole in the mountain, with its 
side so steep that the loose volcanic sand 
and rocks (for the whole mountain is an 
old volcano) kept slipping down in little 
avalanches from which puffs and curls of 
fine yellow' dust kept rising and drifting 
lazily away. If I had made the mistake 






of going too close to the edge, I should 
certainly have started one of these ava- 
lanches and gone slipping and sliding, 
faster and faster, to the very bottom, a 
thousand feet below.¡± 

¡°My!¡± said Mary; ¡°and were there 
horrible people in the bottom, and 
crows?¡± 

¡°Well, really, Mary, I couldn¡¯t see on 
account of the dust-smoke.¡± 

¡°Of course there weren¡¯t, probably,¡± 
said Mary thoughtfully and a little wist- 
fully. 

¡°Probably not,¡± I had to reply regret- 
fully. 

But a bright thought came to me. I re- 
membered something. Several days before 
I had tramped along this hillside road near 
which Mary and I were lying and I had 
seen ¡ª well, just wait. So I said to Mary; 
¡°But I know where there is a Morrowbie 
Jukes pit, several of them, indeed, near 
here. Sha¡¯n¡¯t we go and see them?¡± 





¡°Why, of course,¡± said Mary rather 
severely. 

¡°Let us go galloping as Morrowbie Jukes 
did,¡± said I. So we took hold of hands 
and as soon as we got out of the chapar- 
ral, we went galloping, hop, hop, hoppity, 
hop, down the road. I must confess that 
I got out of breath pretty soon and my 
knees seemed to creak a little. And when 
a swift motor-car came exploding by, go- 
ing up the hill, all the people stared and 
smiled to see an elderly gentleman with 
spectacles and a long coat hop-hopping 
along with a yellow-haired red-cheeked 
little girl in knee skirts. But we don¡¯t 
mind people much! They simply don¡¯t 
know all the things that go with being 
happy. 

Pretty soon ¡ª and it was high time, for 
I had only three breaths left ¡ª we came to 
a place where the road bent sharply around 
the hillside and was especially broad. 

¡°Now, Mary,¡± I said, ¡°be careful and 




don¡¯t fall in. I¡¯m afraid I could not get 
you out.¡± 

¡°Fall in where? Get me out of what?¡± 
asked Mary, quite puzzled. She was star- 
ing about excitedly, looking most of the 
time down into the canon with its spiry 
redwood trees pushing far up from the bot- 
tom. And then suddenly she saw. She 
flopped down on her hands and knees in 
the warm sand by the roadside and cried 
out, ¡°What funny little holes!¡± 

¡°Why, Mary,¡± I said with pained sur- 
prise. ¡°You don¡¯t really mean to call 
these awful Morrowbie Jukes pits ¡®funny 
little holes¡¯ ! That isn¡¯t fair after all we¡¯ve 
done to find them. Especially alter my 
galloping all the way right to the very edge 
of this largest one.¡± 

As I spoke I pointed it out with the toe 
of my shoe, but inadvertently filled it all 
up by poking a couple of tablespoonfuls 
of sand and dust into it. But size is quite 
a relative matter, and for the tiny creatures 





with whom Mary and I have to deal, the 
little crater-like holes in the sand of the 
roadside are large and dangerous ])its. We 
sprawled down on our stomachs among the 
pits to see what we could see. 

Mary saw first. Ah, those bright eyes! 
My spectacles are rather in the way out-of- 
doors, I find. But if I keep on getting 
younger ¡ª and I certainly am younger since 
I got acc^uainted with Mary ¡ª I shall be 
able soon to leave them at home in my 
study when I go out to see things. 

Mary, then, saw first. What she saw 
were two very small shining, brown, gen- 
tly curved, sharp-pointed, sickle-like jaws 
sticking up out of the loose sand in the very 
bottom of one of the pits. They moved 
once, these curved and pointed jaws, and 
that movement caught Mary¡¯s eye. 

¡°It¡¯s the dragon of the pit,¡¯¡¯ I cried. 
¡°Dig him out!¡¯¡¯ 

So Mary dug him out. He was very 
spry and had a strong tendency to shuffle 



backwards down into the hiding sand. 
But it takes a keen dragon to get away 
from Mary, and this one wasn¡¯t and 
didn¡¯t. 

He was an ugly little brute, squat and 
hump-backed, with sand sticking to his 
thinly haired body. But he was fierce- 
looking for all his diminutivencss. Re- 
member again that whether a thing is big 
or little to you depends on whether you 
are big or little. This dragon of the sand- 
pit was little to us. He is terribly big to 
the ants. 

When Mary got him out and had put 
him down on the sand near the pit, he 
trotted about very actively but always 
backwards. He seems to have got so used 
to pulling backwards against the frantic 
struggles of his prey to get up and out of 
the pit, that he can now only move that 
way. After we watched him ¡¯a while, we 
¡°collected¡± him; that is, put him into a 
bottle, with some sand, to take home and 





see if we could keep him in our room of 
live things. Then we turned our attention 
to another crater. It was about three 
inches across at the top and about two 
inches deep; a symmetrical little broad- 
mouthed funnel with the loose sand-slopes 
just as steep as they could be. The slight- 
est disturbance, a touch with a pencil- 
point for example, would start little sand 
avalanches down the slopes anywhere. It 
is, of course, easy to see how this horrible 
pit-trap works. And, in fact, in the very 
next moment we saw actually how it did 
work. 

A foraging brown ant that was running 
swiftly over the ground plunged squarely 
over the verge of the crater before she 
could stop. She certainly tried hard to 
stop when once over, but it was too late. 
Slipping and sliding with the rolling sand- 
grains, dowli she went right toward those 
waiting scimitar-like jaws. 

Now, these jaws deserve a word of de- 




scription. Because, horrible as they may 
seem to the unfortunate ants, they are so 
well arranged for their particular purpose 
that they must attract our admiration. 
The dragon of the pit, ant-lion he is usually 
called, has no open, yawning mouth behind 
those projecting jaws, as might be expected. 
Indeed there is no mouth at all, just a 
throat, thirsty for ant blood! The slender 
scimitar jaws have each a groove on the 
concave inner side, and down this groove 
runs the blood of the struggling victim, 
held impaled on the sharp points of the 
curving mandibles. The two fine grooves 
lead directly into the throat, and thus 
there is no need of open mouth with lips 
and tongue, such as other insects have. 

¡°But see,¡± cried Mary, ¡°the ant has 
stopped sliding. It is going to get out!¡± 

Ah, Mary, you are not making allowance 
for all the resources of this dreadful dragon 
of the pit. Not only is the pit a nearly 
perfect trap, and the eager jaws at the 





bottom more deadly than any array of 
spilces or spears at the bottom of an ele- 
phant pit, but there is another most effect- 
ive thing about this fatal dragon¡¯s trap, 
and that is this: it is not merely a passive 
trap, but an active one. Already it is in 
action. And Mary sees now how hopeless 
it is with the ant. For a shower of sand 
is being thrown up from the bottom of the 
pit against the ant and it is again sliding 
down. The dragon has a flat, broad head 
and powerful neck muscles, and has wit 
enough to shovml up and hurl masses of 
dry sand-grains against the victim on the 
loose slopes. And this starts the ava- 
lanche again, and so down slides the frantic 
ant. 

What follows is too painful for Mary 
and me to watch and certainly too cruel 
to describe. But one must live, and why 
not ant-lions as well as ants? If truth 
must be told, many ants have as cruel 
habits and as bloodthirsty tastes as the 




ant-dragon. Indeed, more cruel and re- 
volting habits. For ants have a gastro- 
nomic fondness for the babies of other 
ants, which is a fondness quite different 
from that which they ought to have. It 
means that they like these babies ¡ª to eat. 
Some communities of ants, indeed, spend 
most of their time fighting other com- 
munities just to rob them of their babies, 
which they carry off to their own nests and 
use in horrible cannibalistic feasts. 

Mary and I had seen enough of tlie Mor- 
rowbie Jukes pits. So we went back to 
our little open sunny spot in the chaparral 
on the hillside and lay quiet and silent for 
a long time. Then Mary murmured, ¡°I 
wonder how the ant-lion digs its pit.¡± 

¡°I can tell you, Mary,¡± I replied. ¡°For 
a man who once saw one digging told me. 
It is this way: First he makes a circular 
groove the full circumference of the top of 
the pit. Then he burrows into the sand 
inside of the groove and piles sand-grains 





on top of his flat, horny, shovel-like head 
with his fore feet. This sand he tosses over 
the groove so that it will fall outside. He 
works his way all around the groove, doing 
this over and over, and then makes another 
groove inside the first, and digs up and 
tosses the sand out as before. And so on, 
groove after groove, each inside the one 
made before, thus gradually making a con- 
ical pit with the sides as steep as the loose 
sand will lie. The pit must always be 
made in a dry sandy spot, and is usually 
located in a warm sunny place at the foot 
of a large rock. This man said that it is 
easy to get the ant-lions to dig pits in 
boxes of sand in the house, and so we can 
try with our ¡®collected¡¯ fellow.¡± 

Mary was silent some moments. Then 
she said softly, ¡°But how will he get any- 
thing to eat?¡± 

¡°Why,¡± said I, ¡°of course we can give 
him ¡ª ¡± Mary looked up at me in a spe- 
cial way she has. I go on, more slowly, 




but still without very much hesitation; 
¡°But, of course, we sha¡¯n¡¯t do that, shall 
we?¡± 

And Mary said quietly: ¡°No, we sha¡¯n¡¯t.¡± 

We rested our chins on our hands and 
lay still, looking down over the chaparral- 
covered hillside and far out across the hazy 
valley. On the distant bay were little 
white specks, small schooners that carry 
wood and tan-bark and hay from the bay 
towns to San Francisco; and across the 
blue bay lifted the bare, brown mountains 
of the Coast Range, with always that gleam- 
ing white spot of the Observatory a-tiptop 
of the highest peak. It was a soft, lan- 
guid, lazy day. Such a peace-giving, re- 
laxing, healing day! And we were so en- 
veloped by it, Mary and I, that we simply 
lay still and happy, with hardly a word. I 
had, of course, intended to give Mary an 
informing lecture about how the ugly, hor- 
rid ant-lion finally stops preying on ants 
and roUs himself up in a neat little silk-and- 




sand ball, and changes into a beautiful, 
slender-bodied, gauzy-winged creature 
without any resemblance at all to its earlier 
incarnation. But I didn¡¯t. It was too fine 
a day to spoil with informing lectures. 

And so Mary and I lay still and happy. 
Finally it was time to go. As we went 
down the road we ])assed again the place 
of the pits, and Mary looked once more at 
the neat little craters with their patient 
waiting jaws at the bottom. 

¡°I wonder,¡± she said, musingly, ¡°if Mr. 
Kipling ever saw an ant-lion pit.¡± 

¡°I wonder,¡± said I. 






Argiope of the Silver Shield is the hand- 
somest spider that Mary and I know. Do 
you know a handsomer? Or are you of 
those who have prejudices, and hold all 
spiders to be ugly, hateful things? We are 
so sorry for you if you are, for that means 
you can never enjoy having a pet Argiope. 
The truth is, Mary and I like clever and 
skillful people, but when we can¡¯t find that 
kind, we rather prefer clever and skillful 
spiders and wasps or other lowly beasties 
to the other sort of people, which shows 
just how far a fancy for nature may lead 
one. 

It is rather bad, of course, to prefer to 
chum with a spider, even such a wonder- 
fully handsome and clever one as Argiope, 



instead of with a human soul. But that 
isn¡¯t our situation exactly. We prefer 
human souls to anything else on earth, but 
not human stomachs and livers and human 
bones and muscles and sick human nerves. 
And, someway, too many people leave on 
one an impression of bowels or sore eyes 
rather than one of mind and soul. So we 
rush to the fields or woods or roads after 
such an experience and live a while with 
the keen bright eyes, the sensitive feelers, 
the dexterous feet and claws and teeth, and 
the sharp wits of the small folk who, 
while not human, are nevertheless inhabi- 
tants and possessors of this earth, side by 
side with us, and are truly our blood- 
cousins, though some incredible number of 
generations removed. 

Mary and I scraped acquaintance with 
our Argiope in a cypress-tree. That is, 
Argiope had her abiding-place there; she 
was there on her great symmetrical orb- 
web, with its long strong foundation lines. 











its delicate radii and its many circles with 
their thousands of tiny drops of viscid stuff 
to make them sticky. In the center was 
the hub, her resting-place, whence the 
radii ran out, and where she had spun a 
broad zigzaggy band of white silk on which 
she stood or sat head downward. Her 
eight long, slender, sensitive legs were out- 
stretched and rested by their tips lightly 
on the bases of the taut radii so that they 
could feel the slightest disturbance in the 
web. These many radii, besides support- 
ing the sticky circles or spiral, which was 
the real catching part of the web, acted 
like so many telegraph lines to carry news 
of the catching to waiting Argiope at the 
center. 

I have said that Mary and I think Ar- 
giope of the Silver Shield the most hand- 
some spider we know. There are, however, 
other Argiopes to dispute the ¡¯glory with 
our favorite; for example, a golden-yellow- 
and-black one and another beautiful silver- 





and-russet one. Other people, too, may 
fancy other spiders; perhaps the little pink- 
and-white crab-spiders of the flower-cups, 
or the curious spiny Acrosomas and Gaster- 
acanthas with their brilliant colors and bi- 
zarre patterns and shape. Others may 
like the strawberry Epeira, or the diadem- 
spider, or the beautiful Nephilas. There 
are enough kinds and colors and shapes of 
spiders to satisfy all tastes. But we like 
best and admire most the long-legged, 
agile, graceful Argiopes, and particularly 
her of the silver shield. Her full, firm body 
with its flat, shield-shaped back, all shin- 
ing silver and crossed by staring black-and- 
yellow stripes, the long tapering legs 
softly ringed with brown and yellow, the 
shining black eyes on their little rounded 
hillock of a forehead, and the broad, brown 
under body with eight circular silver spots; 
all go to make our Argiope a richly dressed 
and stately queen of spiders. But the 
royal consort ¡ª O, the less said of him, the 




better. A veritable dwarf; insignificant, 
inconspicuous and afraid for his life of his 
glorious mate. How such a queen could 
ever ¡ª but there, how tiresome, for that is 
what gets said of most matches, royal or 
plebeian. 

Mary and I brought Argiope in from her 
home in the cypress-tree and put her in a 
fine, roomy, light and airy cage, where she 
could live quietly and unmolested by ene- 
mies, and where we could see to it that she 
should not lack for food. There are many 
of the small creatures with whicli we get 
acquainted that do not object at all to be- 
ing brought into our well-lighted, well-ven- 
tilated, warm vivarium ¡ª that means live- 
room. Creatures of sedentary habits, and 
all the web-making spiders are of course 
that, ought not to object at all and iTsually 
do not seem to. For they get two things 
that they cannot be sure of outside: pro- 
tection and plenty of food. A rgiope seemed 
perfectly content and settled right down to 





spinning a glistening new web, a marvel of 
symmetry and skillful construction, in her 
roomy cage, and in a day or two was seated 
quietly but watchfully on the broad-banded 
hub in the center, with her toes on her tele- 
graph lines, ready for good news. It was, 
of course, our duty to see that she was not 
disappointed. 

The message she wanted was from some 
struggling fly fastened anywhere in the 
broad expanse of web. So we tossed in a 
fly. It buzzed about a moment, then 
blundered into the web which it shook 
violently in its struggle to escape. Argiope 
rushed at once out upon the web. 

¡°How can she run about on the sticky 
web without getting caught, too?¡± inter- 
rupts Mary. 

I think a moment, then with some dig- 
nity reply: ¡°Pretty soon, please, Mary.¡± 

Argiope, I repeat, rushed at once out 
upon the web, seized the fly in her jaws 
and ran back to the hub with it, where she 




appeared to wet it all over, squeeze it into 
a ball and then proceed to feed upon it, 
holding and manipulating it skillfully all the 
time in her jaws. Evidently Argiope was 
very hungry, for as you will see, this is not 
her usual way of taking care of her prey. 

¡°Now, Mary, what was it you asked?¡± 

¡°Oh, just how the spider can run around 
SO fast on the web without sticking to it 
and getting caught or tearing it all to 
pieces.¡± 

¡°Ah, ¡ª ah, yes. Well, Mary, I don¡¯t 
know! that is, exactly; or, well not even 
very close to exactly. But she docs it, 
you see.¡± 

¡°Yes, I see,¡± said Mary, demurely, and 
¡ª can it be that Mary is slightly winking 
one eye? I do hope not. 

¡°Of course you know, Mary, that the 
web is made of two kinds of silk or rather 
two kinds of lines? Oh, you didn¡¯t know?¡± 
Mary has shaken her head. 

¡°Well it is,¡± I continue, with my usual 




manner of teacher-who-knows somewhat 
restored again. ¡°The foundation lines, 
tlie radii and a first set of circles are all 
made of lines without any sticky stuff on 
them. As you sec¡± ¡ª and I touch my pen- 
cil confidently to a radius, with the manner 
of a parlor magician. ¡°Then the spider, 
on this foundation, spins in another long 
spiral, the present circles of the web, which 
is liberally supi)lied with tiny, shining drop- 
lets of viscid silk that never dries, but stays 
moist and very sticky all the time. This 
is the true catching part of the web.¡± 

¡°We surely must watch her spin a web 
sometime,¡± breaks in eager Mary. 

¡°We certainly must,¡± say I, and con- 
tinue. ¡°Now perhaps when Argiope runs 
out on the web from her watching-place at 
the hub, she only puts her long delicate feet 
on the unsticky radii. Or perhaps her feet 
are made in some peculiar way so that they 
do not stick to the circles. As a matter of 
fact, a spider¡¯s foot is remarkably fash- 





ioned, with curious toothed claws, and 
hosts of odd hairs, some knobbed, some 
curved and hook-like, and some forming 
dense little brushes. But after all, Mary, 
the truth is, I don¡¯t know really how it is 
that spiders can run about over their webs 
without getting stuck to them.¡± 

After my long discursus about web-mak- 
ing and spider¡¯s feet, it seemed time to give 
Argiope another fly. Indeed her bright 
little black eyes seemed to Mary to be shin- 
ing with eagerness for more fly, although 
she still had the remains of the first one in 
her jaws ¡ª gracious, Argiope¡¯ s jaws, please, 
not Mary¡¯s! 

So we tossed in another fly. We hope 
you won¡¯t think this cruel. But flies are 
what Argiope eats, and if she was out in the 
garden, she would be catching them, and, 
what is worse, they would not be the dis- 
gusting and dangerous house-flies and blue- 

o 

bottles that we feed her, but all sorts of 
innocent and beautiful little picture-winged 





flower-flies and pomace-flies and what not. 
House-flies and stable-flies and bluebottles 
are truly dangerous because they help 
spread human diseases, especially typhoid 
fever. So if we are to live safely they 
should be killed. Or, better, prevented 
from hatching and growing at all. 

So we tossed in another fly. Argiope 
immediately dropped the nearly finished 
first fly into the web, ran out to the new 
one and pounced on it, seizing it with her 
fore legs. Then she doubled her abdomen 
quickly underneath her and there issued 
from the spinnerets at its tip a jet, a flat 
jet of silk, which was caught uj^ by the hind 
feet and wrapped around the fly as it was 
rolled over and over by the front feet. She 
tumbled it about, all the time wrapping it 
with the issuing band of silk, until it was 
completely enswathed. Then she left it 
fastened in the web, went back to the hub, 
and resumed her feeding on the first fly. 
But soon she finished this entirely, dropped 




the wreck out of the web and went out and 
got the second fly, bringing it back to the 
hub to eat. 

¡°But why,¡± asked Mary, ¡°does Argiope 
wrap the fly up so carefully in silk? Why 
not just kill it by biting, and then leave it 
in the web until she wants it?¡± 

¡°Perhaps,¡± I answer, ¡°she wants to 
make it helpless before she comes to close 
quarters with it. You notice she holds it 
away from her body with her fore feet and 
pulls the silk band out far with her hind 
feet so that her body does not touch the 
fly at all while she wraps it. Perhaps she 
is not sure that it isn¡¯t a bee or some other 
stinging insect. It buzzes loud enough to 
make me think it a bee.¡± 

So Mary and I decided to try some ex- 
periments with our Argiope to find out, if 
possible, first, if she could tell a bee from a 
fly, and second, if so, whether she treated 
it differently, and third, why she wraps 
her prey up so carefully before coming to 





too close quarters with it. We feel quite 
proud of these experiments because we 
seemed to be doing something really scien- 
tific; and we know that Experimental 
Zoology, that is, studying animals by ex- 
perimenting with them, is quite the most 
scientific thing going nowadays among pro- 
fessional naturalists. So here are our notes 
exactly as we wrote them during our ex- 
perimenting. This is, of course, the cor- 
rect manner for publishing real scientific 
observations, because it gives the critical 
reader a chance to detect flaws in our tech- 
nique! 

OUR NOTES ON THE BEHAVIOR OF ARGIOPE 

¡°Nov. i8, 4:45 P.M.; released a fly in the 
cage. The spider pounced upon it, seized 
it with fore and third pair of legs, threw 
out a band of silk and enswathed it, tum- 
bling it Over and over with her hind feet 
about thirteen times, hence enswathed it 
in thirteen wrappings of silk. The fly was 





then disconnected from the web, the spider 
making but little attempt to mend the gap. 
It was carried to the hub and eaten. While 
the feast was going on, a honey-bee [with 
sting extracted; we didn¡¯t want to run any 
risks with Argiope!] was liberated in the 
cage. As soon as it touched the web, the 
spider was upon it, throwing out a band of 
silk in a sheet a quarter of an inch broad. 
[¡®Drawing out¡¯ would be more accurate, 
for the spinnerets cannot spurt out silk; 
silk is drawn out and given its band char- 
acter by lightning-like movements of the 
comb-toothed hind feet.] With her hind 
legs Argiope turned the bee over and over 
twenty-five or twenty-six times, thus en- 
swathing it with twenty-five or twenty-six 
wrappings of the silken sheet. 

¡°No sooner was the bee enswathed than 
a second bee was liberated in the cage and 
caught in the web. This was treated by 
the spider like bee No. i. 

¡°Nov. 20, 8:15 A.M.; Argiope perfectly 





still in center of hub, feeding on bee No. 2. 
The only thing that reveals the feeding is 
a slight moving of the bee¡¯s body as the 
juices are sucked up. Remains of bee 
No. I dropped to the bottom of the 
cage. 

¡°Fed all day, 8:15 a.m. to 5 p.m., on bee 
No. 2. 

¡°At 2:30 P.M., a box-elder bug, which is 
very ill-smelling, was thrown into the web. 
Argiope did nothing for three minutes, then 
went out on the web to it and wrapped, 
making five complete turns; then went 
away. Probably not hungry, as she has 
had two bees and a fly in three days. 

¡°Nov. 21, 8:15 A.M.; box-elder bug fin- 
ished during last night. Old web replaced 
by a new one with twenty-nine radii, eleven 
complete spirals and several partial spirals. 
The hub is formed of fine irregular web- 
bing about an inch and a half in diameter, 
without the viscid droplets that cover the 
spirals. An open space of about a half- 





inch intervenes between the hub and the 
beginning of the spirals. 

¡°4:30 P.M.; liberated a fly in the cage. 
Argiope pounced upon it and began to eat 
immediately, not taking time or trouble to 
enswath it. 

¡°While the fly was being devoured, we 
liberated a strong-smelling box-elder bug 
in the cage. It flew into the web. Ar- 
giope, by a quick movement, turned on the 
hub toward the bug and stood in halting 
position for eight seconds, then approached 
the bug slowly, hesitated for a second or 
two, then wrapped it about with five wrap- 
pings, halted again, and finally finished 
with five more wrappings. The bug was 
then attached to the web where it had first 
touched, the spider passing back to the cen- 
ter and resuming her meal. 

¡°When the fly was finished, Argiope 
walked over to the bug, grasped it in her 
mandibles, walked up to the hub, turned 
herself about so that her head was down- 



ward, manipulated the bug with her fore 
and third pair of feet until it seemed to be 
in right position for her with reference to 
the hub of the web, and began to feed. 

¡°5 P.M.j bee liberated in cage with sting 
not extracted. Argiope leaped instantane- 
ously to the spot where it was caught, 
enswathed it with great rapidity thirty- 
seven times, then bit at it, and enswathed 
it five times more, making forty-two com- 
plete wrappings in all, then left it fastened 
in the web and resumed feeding upon the 
bug. All the time she was wrapping it, 
Argiope kept her body well clear of the 
bee¡¯s body, the spinnerets being fully one- 
half an inch from the bee, making the 
broad band of issuing silk very noticeable. 
In biting it, which she seemed to do with 
marked caution, she of course had to bite 
through the silken covering. 

¡°A few minutes later a second bee, with 
sting, was liberated in the cage, caught in 
the web and rapidly pounced on by the 




spider. As before, she turned it over and 
over with great rapidity, using apparently 
all of her legs. She enswathed it fifty times, 
bit it, and then wrapped it with five more 
silken sheets, making fifty-five wrappings in 
all. Leaving it hung to the web, she went 
back to the bug. 

¡°Before Argiope had reached the bug, 
bee No. 3 was caught in the web at the 
exact spot where bee No. 2 was hung up. 
In its efforts to disentangle its feet, it shook 
the whole web violently. In spite of the 
violent vibration of the web, Argiope pur- 
sued her course to the bug at the hub of 
the web, adjusted herself with head down- 
ward, and resumed feeding. 

¡°Query: Did Argiope think the web- 
shaking due to futile struggles of the well- 
wrapped bee No. 2, and hence needing no 
attention? 

¡°Vibration of the web continued. After 
several seconds had elapsed, Argiope seemed 
suddenly to realize that her efforts were 



called for out on the web, for she pounced 
down as rapidly as before and rolled and 
tumbled both bees together, enswathing both 
in the same sheet of silk, never stopping 
until she had given them fifty-five wrap- 
pings. After biting twice, she wrapped 
them with five more turns, bit again, and 
wrapped again with seven more turns, mak- 
ing sixty-seven in all. Argiope then re- 
turned to her bug. 

"Query: Does Argiope distinguish bees 
from flies? 

"Further query: Does Argiope distin- 
guish bees with stings from bees with stings 
extracted? 

"Nov. 22, 9:45 A.M.; Argiope feeding at 
hub on bees Nos. 2 and 3 introduced into 
cage yesterday afternoon. With her right 
second leg she holds taut a line connected 
with bee No. i. 

¡°10:25 A.M.; packet dropped to the bot- 
tom of the cage, the juices of only one of 
the bees having been sucked out. The 



web is constructed at an angle so that any- 
thing dropped from the center falls free 
of it. 

"5 P.M.; began feeding again on bee 
No. I. 

"Nov. 23, 9:30 A.M.; another bee re- 
leased in cage, caught in web and en- 
swathed approximately thirty turns by 
Argiope. 

¡°Nov. 25, 8:30 A.M.; the web has been 
destroyed during the night. 

¡°Nov. 26, Argiope has made an entirely 
new web. 

¡°Nov. 30, 2 P.M.; gave Argiope a bee 
with sting. It was wrapped forty-seven 
times, but not so expeditiously as has been 
her wont. Later another bee was liberated 
in the cage, caught and wrapped about 
forty-five times. 

¡°Dec. 2, II A.M.; the body of a live bee 
was bathed in fluid from the freshly 
crushed body of a box-elder bug [very 
malodorous], and the bee liberated in 






Argiope¡¯s cage, and soon caught in the 
web. The bee was not very lively and 
did not shake the web violently, but 
Argiope rushed to it without hesitation, 
wrapped it with twenty-five turns of silk 
and returned to the hub of the web. 

¡°Dec. 3 ; Argiope stayed all day in the 
upper part of the web, on foundation lines, 
with head downward. 

¡°Dec. 5; yesterday Argiope moved 
down to her normal place on the hub. 
To-day she is on the hub, but in reversed 
position [head up], and with legs bent and 
limp, not straight out and stiffened as 
usual. 

¡°Dec. 6; Argiope hung all day from 
foundation lines of upi)er part of web, in 
reversed position [head up], with legs limp 
and bent. 

¡°Dec. 7; Argiope hanging by first and 
second right legs, from upper part of web; 
barely alive. 

¡°Dec. 8; Argiope dead.¡± 






An entire colony of those strange little 
people, the Orange-dwellers, were killed in 
our town yesterday morning. And not a 
newspaper reporter found it out! Just one 
of the Orange-dwellers escaped, and as 
Mary and I were the means of saving his 
life, and are taking care of him as well as 
we can (Mary has him now on a small 
piece of orange-rind in a pill box), he has 
told us the story of his life and something 
about the other orange-dwelling people. 
Some of the Orange-dwellers live in Mex- 
ico; some live in Florida, and some in 
California; in fact they are to be found 
wherever oranges grow. Of course, you 
have guessed already that the Orange- 
dwellers are not human beings; they are 
not really people; they are insects. 



The name of the Orange-dweller we had 
saved, and with whom we became very 
well ac(iuainted, is so long and strange that 
I shall tell you merely his nickname, which 
is Citrinus. The oranges on which Citri- 
mis and a great many of his brothers and 
sisters and cousins lived grew in Mexico, 
and when these oranges were ripe, they 
were gathered and packed into boxes and 
sent to our town. Imagine if you can the 
fearful strangeness of it! To have one¡¯s 
world plucked from its place in space, 
wrapped up in tissue-paper, and packed 
into a great box with a lot of other worlds; 
then sent off through space to some other 
place whete enormous giants were waiting 
impatiently for breakfast! When Citrinus¡¯s 
world reached our town, one of these giants, 
who is my brother, took it up, and saying, 
¡°Sec, what a specked orange,¡± straight- 
way began unwittingly to kill all of the 
Orange-dwellers on it by vigorously rub- 
bing and scra])ing it. For Citrinus and his 


companions were the specks! That is all 
an Orange-dweller seems to be when care- 
lessly looked at; simply a little circular, 
scale-like, blackish or reddish-brown speck 
on the shining surface of the orange, his 
world. You can find the Orange-dwellers 
almost any morning at breakfast. 

When my brother began to scrape off 
the specks, I hastily interfered, but only in 
time to save one of the little people, Cit- 
rinus, whom, as I have said, Mary has since 
faithfully cared for. He will soon die, 
however, for he has lived already nearly 
three months, and that is a ripe age for an 
Orange-dweller. But he has had time 
enough to tell me a great deal about his 
life, and as it is such a curious story, and 
is undoubtedly true, I venture to repeat 
it here to you. As a matter of fact I 
must confess ¡ª still Mary says that of course 
Citrinus can talk, because he talks with 
other Orange-dwellers later in the story, 
and so of course can talk to us now. 




Citrinus has lived for almost his whole 
life on the orange on which we found him. 
His mother lived on one of the fragrant 
leaves of the tree on which the orange 
grew. She was, as Citrinus is now, simply 
a reddish-brown circular speck on the 
bright-green orange-leaf; and because she 
couldn¡¯t walk, she had to get all her food 
in a peculiar way. She had a long (that 
is, long for such a tiny creature), slender, 
pointed hollow beak or sucking-tube, which 
she thrust right into the tender orange- 
leaf, and through which she sucked up the 
rich sap or juice which kept flowing into 
the leaf from the twig it hung on. She 
had thus a constant supply of food always 
ready and convenient; whenever she was 
hungry she simply sucked orange-sap into 
her mouth until she was satisfied. This is 
the way all the Orange-dwellers get their 
food, the very youngest of the family being 
able to take care of itself from the day of 
its birth. They never taste any other kind 



of food but the juice from the leaf or twig 
or golden orange on which they live. 

Citrinus is one of a large number of 
brothers and sisters, more than fifty in- 
deed, who were hatched from tiny reddish 
eggs which the mother laid under her own 
body. Before laying the eggs, Citrinus¡¯s 
mother had built a thin shell or roof of 
wax over her back, and after the eggs were 
laid she soon died and her body shriveled 
up, leaving the eggs safely housed under 
the waxen roof. When the baby Orange- 
dwellers were hatched, each had six legs 
and a delicate little sucking-beak project- 
ing from his small plump body. Citrinus 
and his brothers and sisters scrambled out 
from under the wax shell and started out 
each for himself to explore the world. 
First, however, each thrust his beak into 
the leaf and took a good drink of sap. 
Then they were ready to begin their jour- 
neying. But a terrible thing happened! 

Just as Citrinus was pulling his beak out 





of the soft leaf, he saw a great six-legged 
beast, in shape like a turtle, with shining 
red-and-black back and fearful snapping 
jaws. On each side of its head, which it 
moved slowly from side to side, it had an 
immense eye, which looked like a hemi- 
spherical window, with hundreds of panes 
of glass in it. The beast¡¯s legs were large 
and powerful, and on each foot there were 
two claws, eacli of them as long as the 
whole body of Citrinus. Truly this was 
an appalling sight, and all of the little 
Orange-dwellers ran as fast as they could, 
which, unfortunately, wasn¡¯t very fast. 
The beast leisurely caught up in its great 
jaws one after another of Citrinus¡¯ s brothers 
and sisters, and crushed and tore their ten- 
der bodies to pieces and ate them! 

Now this beast, which seemed so large to 
Citrinus, w'as what is to us a very small 
and pretty insect, one of the lady-bird 
beetles. These beetles care for no other 
food than plump Orange-dwellers and 




other equally toothsome small insects; and 
instead of being sorry for its victims, we 
are glad it eats them! This seems very 
cruel indeed, but there are so many, many 
millions of the Orange-dwellers all suck- 
ing the juice of orange-trees that although 
they are so small, and each one drinks so 
little sap, yet altogether they do a great 
amount of damage to the orange-trees, 
often killing all the trees in a large orchard. 
So the lady-birds are a great help to the 
orange-growers. 

Little Citrinus escaped from the Beetle 
by crawling into a small, dark hole in the 
surface of the leaf; but he was badly 
frightened. This was his first experience 
with the terrible dangers of the world, with 
the struggle for life, which is going on so 
bitterly among the people of his kind, the 
insects. For although there would seem 
to be enough plants and trees to serve as 
food for all of them, many insects find it 
easier or prefer to eat other insects than to 





live on plant food. Now because the in- 
sects which live on plant food do injury to 
our fruit-trees and vegetables and grain 
crops by their eating, we call them inju- 
rious insects; while we call the insect-eating 
kinds beneficial insects, because they de- 
stroy the injurious insects. 

But little Citrinus didn¡¯t look at the 
matter at all in this light. He thought 
the lady-bird beetle a very cruel and 
wicked being, and resolved to warn every 
Orange-dweller he met in his travels to 
beware of the cruel, turtle-shaped beast 
with the shining black-and-red back. As 
he wandered on from leaf to leaf along 
the tender twigs in the top of the tree, 
he met many other Orange-dwellers, 
whom he would have told all about 
the Beetle, but he found that all of 
them had had experiences as sad as his; 
in fact he soon learned that of all the 
Orange-dwellers who are born, only a very, 
very few escape the Beetles and other de- 





vouring beasts who pursue them. And 
he was highly indignant when one shrewd 
Orange-dweller told him that it really was 
a good thing for the race of Orange-dwellers 
that so many of them were killed. For, 
the shrewd Orange-dweller said, if all of 
us who are born should live and have fam- 
ilies, and not die until old age came on, 
there would soon be so many of us that we 
should eat all the orange-trees in the 
world, and then we should all starve to 
death. And this is quite true. 

Finally Citrinus came to a remarkable 
being, a very beautiful being indeed. It 
had two long, slender, waving feelers on 
its head, four large ball-shaped eyes, and, 
strangest of all, two delicate gauzy wings. 
This beautiful creature greeted Citrinus 
kindly and asked him where he was going. 
Citrinus, who was at first a little afraid of 
the strange creature, was reassured by its 
kind greeting, and answered simply, ¡°I 
don¡¯t know. My brothers and sisters were 




all eaten by the Beetle; my father and 
mother I have never seen; and no one has 
told me where to go.¡± 

The stranger smiled a little sadly and 
said, ¡°That is the common story among us 
Orange-dwellers. Our fathers and mothers 
always die before we are born. It is a 
great pity Yes, before my little Orange- 
dweller children are born ¡ª ¡± 

¡°What,¡± cried Citrinus, ¡°are you an 
Orange-dweller; you, who are so different 
from me?¡± 

¡°Indeed I am,¡± replied the gauzy-winged 
creature. ¡°I am an old Orange-dweller. 
Oh, I know it seems strange to you,¡± he 
continued, noticing the look of astonish- 
ment on Citrinus¡¯s face, ¡°but some day 
you will look just like me. You will have 
wings, and be able to fly; and will have 
long feelers on your head to hear and to 
smell with, and big eyes to see all around you 
with. You will have some strange experi- 
ences, though, before you become like me.¡± 



¡°But as I had started to say, we fathers, 
and the mothers too for that matter, al- 
ways die before you youngsters are hatched 
out of your eggs. Now I shall probably 
die to-morrow or next day, because I have 
lived three days already, and that is a 
long time to live without eating.¡± 

Little Citrinus could hardly believe his 
senses. It was so wonderful. ¡°But why 
don¡¯t you eat,¡± urged Citrinus, who felt 
very badly to think of any one¡¯s going 
without food for three days. He always 
took a drink of sap every few minutes. 

¡°Why, how absurd,¡± replied the winged 
Orange-dweller, ¡°don¡¯t you see I have 
nothing to eat with? No sucking-beak, no 
mouth at all. When I get my wings and 
my four eyes, I lose my mouth, and can¡¯t 
eat or drink any more.¡± 

This was incredible; but when Citrinus 
looked at the head of his companion, he saw 
it was perfectly true. He had no mouth. 
Citrinus gently waved his little sucking- 




beak, to be sure he still had it. Suddenly 
he began to cry; a sad thought had come 
to him. ¡°And did my mother starve to 
death too?¡± he sobbed. 

¡°Not at all, little one,¡± rather impa- 
tiently exclaimed the other. Little Cit- 
rinus seemed to know so very little, indeed. 
¡°Your mother was not at all like me. 
When she was full-grown she had no wings, 
no legs, and no eyes, but she had a very 
long beak, and could suck up a great deal 
of orange-sap. If you will listen and not 
interrupt, I will tell you how we Orange- 
dwellers grow. When we are hatched 
from our eggs we are all alike, brothers and 
sisters. We each have a plump little body, 
six legs, two eyes, and a sucking-beak to 
get food with. We walk about for a few 
days, and finally stop on some nice green 
leaf or juicy orange, and stick our beaks 
far in and go to sleep, or do something very 
like it. We never walk about any more. 
Indeed, if you are a girl Orange-dweller 





you never leave this spot, but live all the 
rest of your life and die here. However, 

I am getting too far along in my story. 
While we are asleep we shed all of our skin, 
fold it up into a little ball or cushion and 
put it on our backs, together with some 
wax which comes out of small holes in our 
bodies. While shedding our skin we make 
a great change in our bodies. We lose 
our legs! So we simply remain where we 
went to sleep, with our beaks stuck into 
the leaf, sucking the sap. After a few days 
we go to sleep again, and again we shed 
our skins and fold them on our backs. But 
at this time something even more wonder- 
ful than before happens to our bodies. 
That is, to the bodies of the boy Orange- 
dwellers. For this time we lose our suck- 
ing-beaks, but we regain our six legs, and 
in addition we get a second pair of eyes, 
we find on our heads a pair of long, slen- 
der, hairy feelers, and, most pleasing of all, 
we have been provided with a pair of wings. 





Our wings are not yet full-grown or ready 
to fly with, so we still remain quietly in 
our resting-place for a few days longer, 
when we shed our skin once more, and 
then fly away, looking just as I do now. 
Our sisters, though, when they shed their 
skins the second time, make no change in 
their bodies, except to grow larger. They 
remain with their sucking-beaks thrust 
into the leaf. They keep increasing the 
size of the wax scale or shell over their 
backs, until they are entirely covered by 
it. Now they look just as your mother 
did. From above, all one can see is the 
flat circular wax scale with two spots on 
it, where the folded-up cast skins are. Un- 
derneath the scale lies the Orange-dweller, 
with its sucking-beak stuck into the sap, 
but with no legs or wings or long, hairy 
feelers. After a while she lays a lot of 
eggs under her body, and then dies. And 
soon the new family is born. Now this is 
the way we grow, and all of the wonder- 




ful things which have happened to me will 
happen to you, ¡ª ^if the Beetle does not get 
you.¡± 

With that the winged Orange-dweller 
flew away, and little Citrinus was left alone, 
wondering over the strange story. After 
taking a drink of sap from the leaf on which 
he was standing, he wandered aimlessly 
about until he came to a large yellow ball 
hanging from the branch, which gave out 
a delightful odor. Scrambling down the 
slender stem by which it was suspended, 
he walked out on to the shining surface of 
the orange; for, of course, that is what 
the yellow ball was. He tried a drink of 
sap from the ball and found it delicious. 
He decided to stay on the ball, the more 
readily as he was getting rather tired with 
his long traveling, and a sort of sleepy 
feeling was coming over him. So thrust- 
ing his beak far into the ball, he went to 
sleep. How long he slept he doesn¡¯t know, 
but when he awoke he could hardly be- 






lieve his senses. He had no legs; and on 
his back there was a thin shell of wax and 
a little packet. He realized, too, that he 
was bigger than he was before he went to 
sleep. Then the strange story told him 
by the winged Orange-dweller came back 
to him, and he knew that the stranger had 
told the truth. The first great change had 
happened. He was delighted, for he 
thought it would be very pleasant to have 
wings and fly about wherever he wished, 
to see the world. 

Suddenly a great shock came: his World 
trembled, then shook violently, and, with 
a quick wrench, started to move swiftly 
through space. Then came a stop, a ser- 
ies of shocks and curious whirlings, and 
then a filmy-white cloud settled down over 
it all, shutting out the sunlight and the 
blue sky. Finally there came a few more 
shocks and wrenches, and then total dark- 
ness and silence. Citrinus had held on to 
his world all through this, because his beak 



was still thrust into the fragrant surface, 
and now he felt thankful that he had come 
alive through these series of world catas- 
trophes and convulsions and still had all 
the food he could possibly use. 

After a few days, when Citrinus¡¯s world 
all nicely wrapped in tissue-paper and 
packed in a box with ninety-nine other 
similar worlds had traveled a thousand 
miles, the sunlight came again, and soon 
after came that greatest danger of all ¡ª 
that danger from which I saved him by 
staying my brother¡¯s hand in its ruthless 
rubbing off of the specks on his break- 
fast orange! Now Citrinus and Mary and 
I are all waiting impatiently for the day 
when he shall get his beautiful wings and 
his two pairs of eyes. 








When Mary and I came to examine our 
ant-lion dragon the day after our adven- 
tures among the Morrowbie Jukes pits, we 
found him dead in the bottle of sand. Per- 
haps his haughty spirit of dragon could not 
stand such ignominious bottling up, or per- 
haps there wasn¡¯t enough air. Anyway, 
His Fierceness was dead. His cruel curved 
jaws would seize and pierce no more forag- 
ing ants. His thirsty throat would never 
again be laved by the fresh blood of vic- 
tims. Vale dragon! 

But there are more dragons than one in 
our world. Not only more ant-lion drag- 
ons, but more other kinds of dragons. And 
this is one of the great advantages that 
Mary and I enjoy in our looking about in 






the fields and woods for interesting things. 
If we were looking for the dragons of fairy 
stories, we could only expect to find one 
kind ¡ª if, indeed, we could expect to find 
any kind at all in these days when so few 
fairies are left. If we could find it, how- 
ever, it would be a monstrous beast in a 
forest cavern, with scaled body and clawed 
feet and great ugly head that breathed fire 
and smoke from its gaping mouth. That 
would be an interesting sort of dragon to 
see, we confess, more interesting than the 
great one, a hundred yards long, that we 
saw in a Chinese procession in Oakland, 
with two excited Chinamen jumping about 
in front of its head and jabbing at its eyes 
with spears. And more interesting than 
the one that roars and spits at Siegfried on 
the stage while the big orchestra goes off 
into wild clamors of 0-see-the-dragon mu- 
sic. But we do not expect ever to find a 
real fairy-story dragon any more, and so 
we content ourselves with trying to find as 






many different kinds of real dragons as we 
can in our world of little folk on the cam- 
pus. These dragons are rather small, but 
they are unusually fierce and voracious, to 
make up for their lack of size. And so they 
serve very well to interest us. 

To make up for the death of the ant- 
lion dragon of the sand-pits, I promised to 
take Mary to see the Dragon of Lagunita. 
Or rather the dragons, for there are many 
in Lagunita, and indeed many in several 
other places on the campus. Have I ex- 
plained that Lagunita is a pretty Spanish 
word for ¡° little lake,¡± and that our Lagu- 
nita is just what its name means, and be- 
sides is as pretty as its name? There is 
only one trouble about it. And that is, 
that every year, in the long, rainless, sun- 
fiUed summer, it dries up to nothing but 
a shallow, parched hollow in the ground, 
and all the dragons have to move. But 
this moving is a remarkable performance. 
For while during the spring the Lagunita 





dragons live rather inactively in their lairs 
under the water, when summer comes they 
all transform themselves into great flpng 
dragons of the air, and swoop and swirl 
about in a manner very terrif5dng to see. 

The morning we were to make our jour- 
ney to Lagunita, I came to Mary¡¯s house 
with a rake over my shoulder. 

¡°But what are you going to do with the 
rake?¡± said Mary. 

¡°One doesn¡¯t go to seek a dragon with- 
out weapons,¡± I replied with dignity. 
¡°And a rake is a much more formidable 
weapon in the hands of a man who knows 
how to rake than a gun in the hands of a 
man who doesn¡¯t know how to shoot.¡± I 
am something of an amateur gardener, but 
not at all the holder of a record at clay 
pigeons nor king of a Schutzen-verein. So 
I carried my rake. 

¡°Then what weapon shall I carry?¡± asks 
Mary. 

I ponder seriously. 





¡°A tin lunch-pail,¡± I finally reply. 

¡°With luncheon in?¡± asks Mary. 

¡°Empty,¡± I say. 

So we start. 

I have already said that Lagunita is a 
pretty little lake. It lies just under the 
first of the foothills that rise ridge after 
ridge into the forested mountains that sep- 
arate us from the ocean. Indeed, it is on 
the first low step up from the valley floor, 
and from its enclosing bank or shore one 
gets a good view of the level, reaching val- 
ley thickly set with live-oak trees and 
houses and fields. Around the little lake 
have grown up pines, willows and other 
beautiful trees, and at one side a tiny 
stream comes in during the wet season. 
There is no regular outlet, but the water 
which usually begins to come in about 
November keeps filling the shallow bowl 
of the lake higher and higher until by 
spring it is nearly bank full and may even 
overflow. Then as the long dry summer 





season sets in, the level of the water grows 
lower and lower until in August or Sep- 
tember there is only left a small muddy 
puddle crammed with surprised and de- 
spairing little fishes and salamanders and 
water-beetles and the like, who are not at 
all accustomed to such behavior on the 
part of a lake. And then a few days later 
they are all gasping their last breaths there 
together on the scum-covered, waterless 
bottom. 

But when Lagunita is really a lake, it is 
a very pretty one, and Mary and I love to 
go there and sit on the bank under the wil- 
lows near the horse paddocks and watch 
the college boys rowing about in their 
graceful, narrow, long-oared shells. These 
swift-darting boats look like great water- 
skaters, only white instead of black. , You 
know the long-legged, active water-skaters 
or water-striders that skim about over the 
surface of ponds or quiet backwater pools 
in streams in summer time? 



So Mary and I went to Lagunita with 
our rake and tin lunch-pail to hunt for 
dragons. No shining armor; no great 
two-handed sword; no cap of invisibility. 
Just a rake and a tin lunch-pail. 

¡°Where, Mary, do you think is the like- 
liest place for the dragon?¡¯¡¯ I ask. 

Mary answers promptly, ¡°There at the 
foot of the steep stony bank where the big 
willow-tree hangs over.¡± 

We go there. I grasp my rake firmly 
with both hands. I reach far out over the 
shallow water. Then I beat the rake sud- 
denly down through the water to the bot- 
tom, and with a quick strong pull I drag it 
out, raking out with it a great mass of oozy 
mud and matted leaves. I drag this well 
up on shore, and both Mary and I flop 
down on our knees and begin pawing 
about in it. Suddenly Mary calls out, 
¡°I¡¯ve got one,¡± and holds up in her fin- 
gers an extraordinary, kicking, twisting 
creature with six legs, a big head, and a 




thick, ugly body on which seem to be the 
beginnings of several fins or wings. It 
has, this creature, two great staring eyes, 
and stout, sharp-pointed spines stick out 
from various parts of the body. 

¡°Put him in the lunch-pail,¡± I shout. 
I had already filled it half-full of water 
from the lake. 

Then I found one; then Mary another, 
and then I still another. It was truly 
great sport, this dragon-hunting. 

We put them all into the lunch-pail 
where they lay sullenly on the bottom, 
glaring at each other, but not offering to 
fight, as we rather hoped they would. 

Then, what to do? These dragons in 
their regular lairs at the bottom of Lagu- 
nita might do a lot of most interesting 
things, but dredged up in this summary 
way and deposited in a strange tin pail in 
the glaring light of day, they seemed 
wholly indisposed to carry on any per- 
formances of dragon for our benefit. So 





we decided to take them home, and try to 
fix up for them a still smaller lakelet than 
Lagunita; one, say, in a tub! Then, per- 
haps, they would feel more at home and 
ease, and might do something for us. 

So we took them home. And we fixed 
a tub with sand in the bottom, water over 
that, and over the top of the tub a screen 
of netting that would let air and sunlight 
in, but not dragons out. Then we collected 
some miscellaneous small water-beasties 
and a few water-plants, and put them in, 
and so really had a very comfortable and 
home-like place for the dragons. They 
seemed to take to it all right; we called 
our new lakelet Monday Pond, because of 
some relation between the tub and wash- 
day, I suppose, and we had very good fun 
with our dragons for several weeks. Think 
of the advantage of having your dragon 
right at home! If it is a bad day, or we 
are lazy, or there may be visitors who stay 
too long so there is only a little time for 




ourselves, how convenient it is to have a 
dragon ¡ª or indeed a whole brood of dragons 
¡ª right in your study. Much better, of 
course, than to have to sail to a distant 
island and tramp through leagues of forest 
or thorny bushes or over burning desert 
or among spouting volcanoes to find your 
dragon, as most princes in fairy stories 
have to do. 

I can¡¯t, of course, venture to tell you of 
all the interesting things that Mary and I 
saw our dragons do. Two or three will 
have to do. Or my publisher will cry, 
¡°Cut it short; cut it short, I say.¡± And 
that will hurt me, for he is really a most 
forbearing publisher, and quite in the way 
of a friend. The three things shall be, 
one, eating, and what with; two, getting 
a new skin, and why; and third, changing 
from an under-water, crawling, squirmy, 
ugly dragon into an aerial, whizzing, flash- 
ing, dashing, beautiful-winged dragon, and 
when. Of course one of the most impor- 





tant things about any dragon is what and 
how he eats; and the other most important 
thing about Mary¡¯s and my special kind of 
dragon is his remarkable change. This 
was to us much more remarkable than hav- 
ing three heads or even getting a new head 
every time an old one is cut off, which seems 
to be rather a usual habit of fairy-book 
dragons. 

The dragons lay rather quietly on the 
sand at the bottom of Monday Pond most 
of the time. Sometimes one would be up 
a little way on the shore, that is, the side 
of the tub, or clinging to one of the plant- 
stems. When poked with a pencil, ¡ª and 
we were fearless about poking them, if the 
pencil were a long one, ¡ª they would half- 
walk, half-swim away. But mostly they 
lay pretty well concealed, waiting for some- 
thing to happen. What would happen oc- 
casionally was this: a young May-fly or a 
water-beetle would come swimming or walk- 
ing along; if it passed an inch away from 




the dragon, all right; but if its path brought 
it closer, an extraordinary ¡° catcher,¡± rather 
like a pair of long nippers or tongs, 
would shoot out like a flash from the head 
of the dragon and seize on the unfortunate 
beastie. Then the ¡° catcher¡¯ ¡¯ would fold up 
in such a way as to bring the victim against 
the dragon¡¯s mouth, which is provided with 
powerful, sharp-toothed jaws. These jaws 
then had their turn. And that was the end 
of the May-fly. 

Mary was rather shocked when she saw 
the dragon first u.sc its ¡± catcher.¡± She 
wanted to rescue the poor May-fly. But 
after all she has got pretty well used to 
seeing tragedies in insect life. They seem 
to be necessary and normal. Many insects 
depend upon other animals for food, just 
as we do. Only fortunately we don¡¯t have 
to catch and kill our own steer or pig 
or lamb or chicken. We turn the bloody 
business over to men who like ¡ª well, at 
least, who do it for us. But in the world of 





lower animals each one is usually his own 
butcher. 

Mary soon wanted to see the dragon¡¯s 
¡°catcher,¡± and so we dredged one out of 
Monday Pond, and put him on the study- 
table. As he faced us with his big eyes 
glaring from his broad heavy head, he 
looked very fierce. But curiously enough, 
he didn¡¯t seem to have any jaws; nor even 
a mouth. The whole front of his face was 
smooth and covered over by a sort of mask, 
so that his terrible jaws and catching nip- 
pers were invisible. However, we soon un- 
derstood this. The mask was the folded-up 
¡° catcher ¡± so disposed that it served, when 
not in use, actually to hide its own iniquity 
as well as that of the yawning mouth be- 
hind. Only when some small insect, all 
unsuspecting this smooth masked face, 
comes close, do the long tongs unfold, 
shoot out, and reveal the waiting jaws and 
thirsty throat. A veritable dragon indeed; 
sly and cruel and ever hungry for living prey. 




One day when we were looking into Mon- 
day Pond, Mary saw a curious object that 
looked more like a hollow dragon than any- 
thing else. It had all the shape and size 
of one of the dragons; the legs and eyes 
and masked face, the pads on the back 
that looked like half-fledged wings. But 
there was a transparency and emptiness 
about it that was uncanny and ghost-like. 
Then, too, when we looked more closely 
there was a great rent down the back. 
And that made the mystery plain. The 
real dragon, the flesh and blood and breath- 
ing live dragon, had come out of that long 
tear, leaving his skin behind! It was his 
complete skin, too, back and sides and 
belly, out to the tips of his feelers and down 
to his toes and claws. 

¡°But why should he shed his skin? 
Hasn¡¯t he any skin now?¡± asked Mary. 

¡°Of course he must have a skin. How 
could he keep his blood in, and what 
would his muscles be fastened to, for he is 




a boneless dragon, and his skeleton is his 
outside shell, with his muscles fastened to 
it? So how could he live at all without a 
skin? He must have a new skin.¡± 

And, of course, that was exactly it. He 
had cast his old skin, as a snake does, 
and had got a brand-new one. Why 
shouldn¡¯t a dragon change his skin if a 
snake can? 

But Mary is persistent about her ¡°why s,¡± 
and I was quite ready for her next ques- 
tion, which came after a moment of mus- 
ing. 

¡°Why should he shed his old skin and 
get a new one? Is the new one different; 
a different color or shape or some- 
thing?¡± 

¡°No; not a different color or different 
shape especially, but a different size. The 
dragon is growing up. He is like a boy 
who keeps on wearing age-nine clothes un- 
til they are too short in the sleeves, too 
tight in the back, and too high-water in the 




legs. Then one day he sheds his age-nine 
suit and gets an age-eleven one. See?¡± 

¡®¡®What a funny professor you are! Is 
that the way you lecture to your classes?¡± 

¡®¡®Gracious, no, Mary! This is the way: 
As the immature dragon grows older, his 
constant assimilation of food tends to 
create a natural increase in size. But the 
comparative inelasticity of his chitinized 
cuticula prevents the actual expansion, to 
any considerable degree, of his body mass. 
Thus all the cells of the body become tur- 
gid, and altogether a great pressure is 
exerted outwards against the enclosing 
cuticular wall. This wall then suddenly 
splits along the longimesial line of the 
dorsum, and through this rent the dragon 
extricates itself in soft and defenceless 
condition, but of markedly larger size. 
The new cuticula, which is pale, elastic 
and thin at first, soon becomes thicker, 
strongly chitinized and dark. The old 
cuticle, or exuvia, which has been moulted, 





is curiously complete, and is a hollow or 
shell-like replica of the external appear- 
ance of the dragon even to the finest de- 
tails. How is that, Mary?¡± 

¡°Very instruct ¡ª instructing¡± ¡ª with an 
effort ¡ª ¡°indeed,¡± replies Mary, with grave 
face. ¡°But I guess I understand the 
change from age-nine to age-eleven clothes 
better.¡± 

And then we saw the third wonderful 
happening in our dragon¡¯s life that I said 
we should tell about. We saw one of the 
dragons getting wings! That is, changing 
from an ugly, blackish, squat, crawling 
creature into a glorious long-bodied, reun- 
bow-tinted, flying dragon. Another dragon 
had crawled up above the water on a plant- 
stem and was also ¡°moulting its chitinized 
cuticula.¡± But it was coming out from 
the old skin in very different shape and 
color. I had forgotten, when I told Mary 
that they only changed in size after cast- 
ing the skin, about the last moulting. 




Each dragon casts its skin several times in 
its life, but the last time it does it, it makes 
the wonderful change I¡¯ve already spoken 
about, from crawling to fl}dng dragon. 
And it was one of these last skin-castings 
that was going on now under our very 
eyes. 

I can¡¯t describe all that happened. You 
must see it for yourself some time. How, 
out of the great rent in the old skin along 
the back, the soft damp body of the dragon 
squeezes slowly out, with its constant rev- 
elation of delicate changing color and its 
graceful new shape; how out of the odd 
shapeless pads on the back come four, long, 
narrow, shining, transparent wings, with 
complex framework of fine little veins, or 
ribs, and thin flexible glassy membrane 
stretched over them; how the new head 
looks with its enormous, sparkling, iri- 
descent eyes making nearly two-thirds of 
it and so cleverly fitted on the body that 
it can turn nearly entirely around on the 




neck. And then how the body fills out 
and takes shape, and the wings get larger 
and larger, and everything more and more 
beautifully colored! All this you will have 
to see for yourself some time when you have 
a Monday Pond in your own study, with a 
brood of dragons in. 

¡°It is wonderful, isn¡¯t it, Mary? How 
would you like to see twenty, thirty, forty, 
oh, a hundred dragons doing this all at 
once. We can if we want to. All we have 
to do is to go over to Lagunita some morn- 
ing early, very early, just a little after sun- 
rise ¡ª for that is their favorite time ¡ª and 
we shall see scores of dragons crawling up 
out of the water on stones, plants, sticks, 
anything convenient, and sloughing off 
their dirty, dark, old skins and coming 
out in their beautiful iridescent green and 
violet and purple new skins, with their 
long slender body and great flashing wings. 
They sit quietly on the stones and plant- 
stems until the warm rising sun dries them 



and their new skins get firm and all nicely 
fitted, and then they begin their new hfe, 
¡ª wheeling and dashing over the lake and 
among the hills and bushes and above the 
grasses and grain along the banks. Like 
eagles and hawks they are seeking their 
prey. Watch that little gnat buzzing there 
in the air. A flying dragon swoops by and 
there is no gnat there any longer. It has 
been caught in the curious basket-like trap 
which the dragon makes with its spiny 
legs all held together, and it is being crushed 
and chewed by the great jaws. Still a 
dragon, you see, for all of its new beauty!¡± 

Mary muses. ¡°Not all beautiful things 
in the world are good, are they?¡± she mur- 
murs. 

¡°Mary, you are a philosopher,¡± I say. 

:|e He )ie * 3ie 

As I read this over I realize quite as 
keenly, I hope, as you do, my reader, how 
little there is in this story. And yet find- 
ing out this little was real pleasure to Mary 





and me. Now we must perforce estimate 
the pleasures and pains, the likes and dis- 
likes, of other people by our own. And 
however untrue this estimate may be for any 
one other person, it must be fairly true for 
any considerable number of persons. There- 
fore ¡ª and this is the reason for putting 
down our simple experiences with the in- 
sects for other people to read and perhaps 
to be stirred by to see and do similar things 
¡ª therefore, I say, other people, some other 
people, also must be able to get pleasure 
from what we do. 

Now if there is any way and any means 
of getting clean pleasure into the crowded 
days of our living, then that way and 
means should be suggested and opened to 
as many as possible. Mary and I, you see, 
have the real proselyting spirit; we are mis- 
sionaries of the religion of the unroofed tem- 
ples. And we want all to be saved! So 
we give testimony willingly of our own ex- 
periences, and of the saving grace of our 





belief. We have no names for our idols, 
nor any formulation of our creed. But in 
various voice and word we do gladly con- 
fess over and over again the reality of the 
happiness that comes to us from our hours 
with the lowly w'orld that we are coming to 
know better and better. And any one of 
these happy hours may contain no more 
than the little that has been told in this 
story of the ¡°Dragon of Lagunita,¡± and 
yet be really and truly a happy hour. 






¡°Are you comfortable, Mary?¡¯¡¯ I ask, 
¡°and shall I begin?¡¯¡¯ 

¡°Yes; in just a mimite,¡± Mary replies; 
¡°I want to sit so that 1 can sec; both ways, 
Lagunita that way and the brown field with 
the tarantula holes that way,¡± and she 
sweeps half the horizon with a chubby 
hand. 

We are half-sitting, half-lying, in the 
shade at the base of a live-oak on a little 
knoll back of the campus, whcicce we can 
look down on the rcHl-tiled roofs and warm 
buffy walls of the Ouadrangle, and on be- 
yond to the Arboretum with its great eu- 
calyptuses sticking out above the other 
trees. We can catch glimpses of the bay, 
too, and of the white houses of the care- 



takers of the oyster-beds perched on piles 
above the water like ancient Swiss lake- 
dwellers. 

Strolling about over the brown field of 
the tarantula holes and carrying bundles 
of sticks, and stooping down now and then 
to strike at the ground with one of the 
sticks, are several young men. Sophomores 
by their hats, and one of them with a red 
jacket on; 

"Gowfin¡¯ a¡¯ the day, 

Daein¡¯ nae wark ava¡¯; 

Rinnin¡¯ aboot wi¡¯ a peck o' sticks 
Efter a wee bit ba¡¯!¡± 

Mary recites this in a pretty singsong. 

¡°Why, Mary, where did you learn that?¡± 
I ask in surprise. 

¡°From the Scotch lady that I take of.¡± 

¡°Take of! What is it you take of her? 
I hope not measles or smallpox, or ¡ª ¡± 

¡°Why no, of course not. Music. That¡¯s 
what all young ladies take.¡± 





¡°Oh, I see! It is catching, isn¡¯t it? I 
have seen some bad cases, especially in 
small towns. Every young lady, even just 
girls¡± ¡ª I glance sidewise at Mary ¡ª ¡°down 
with it. But is that what those boys over 
there are doing? I hope they won¡¯t inter- 
fere with the tarantulas. They probably 
don¡¯t know what lively times there are at 
nights in that field. Scores of big black 
tarantulas racing about, hunting, and hun- 
dreds of beetles and things racing about, 
trying to keep from being eaten. Well, 
I¡¯d better begin, because we have to get 
back by luncheon time. I have a most 
profound lecture to give on Orthogenesis 
and Heterogenesis to that unfortunate 
Evolution class at two o¡¯clock.¡± 

¡°Fm aU ready,¡± said Mary, looking up at 
me with confidence. She appreciates the 
kind of lectures I give outdoors, even if the 
lunch-gorged students don¡¯t appreciate my 
efforts ex cathedra. 

¡°Well this summer invasion that I prom- 




ised to tell you about happened when 1 
was a boy in a little town in Kansas. It 
was in Centennial year; the one-hundredth 
anniversary of the freedom of the United 
States^ and the summer of the Centennial 
Exposition at Philadelphia. 

¡°I was going down town one day in July 
to buy some meat for dinner. I was going 
because my mother had sent me. Natu- 
rally this promised to be a very uninterest- 
ing excursion. But you never can tell. 

¡°When I had got fairly down to Com- 
mercial Street, I saw that all the people 
were greatly excited. Some were talking 
loudly, but most were staring up toward 
the siin, shading their eyes with their 
hands. Then I heard old Mr. Beasley say: 
¡®That¡¯s surely them all right; doggon, 
they¡¯ll eat us up.¡¯ 

¡°My heart jumped. Who could be com- 
ing from the sun to cat us up? I burst into 
excited questions. ¡®Who are coming, Mr. 
Beasley? I can¡¯t see anybody.¡¯ 





¡°¡®Hoppers is cornin¡¯, boy; see that sort 
o¡¯ shiny thin cloud uji there jest off the 
edge o¡¯ the sun? Well, them¡¯s hoppers.¡¯ 

¡°¡®But how¡¯ll they cat us up, Mr. Beas- 
ley? No grasshopper can eat me up.¡¯ 

¡°¡®They¡¯ll cat us up with their doggoned 
terbaccy-spittin¡¯ mouths; thet¡¯s how. And 
they¡¯ll eat you up by catin¡¯ everything you 
want to eat; thet¡¯s how, too. Havin¡¯ noth- 
in¡¯ to cat is jest about the same as bein¡¯ et, 
accordin¡¯ to the way I looks at things.¡¯ 

¡°It is evident that Mr. Beasley was a 
philosopher and a pessimist; that is, a man 
who sees the disagreeable sides of things, 
who doesn¡¯t sec the silvery lining to the 
dark clouds. In fact, in this particular 
case Mr. Beasley was seeing a very dark 
lining to that silvery cloud ¡®jest off the 
edge 0¡¯ the sun.¡¯ 

¡°I stared at the thin shining cloud for a 
long time, wondering if it were really true 
that it was grasshoppers. People said the 
silvery shimmer was made by the reflec- 




tion of the sunlight from the gauzy wings 
of the hosts of flying insects. It occurred 
to me that if the hoppers were just off the 
edge of the sun, they would all be burned 
up, or at least have their wings so scorched 
that they would fall to the ground. How- 
ever, as the sun is 90,000,000 miles away 
from the earth, it would take a very long 
time for the scorched grasshoppers to fall 
all the way. I guessed that we might 
have a rain of dead and crippled hoppers 
about Christmas-time. Anyway there were 
no grasshoppers now, dead or alive, in the 
street. And I decided, rather disappoint- 
edly, that we probably shouldn¡¯t get to 
see any of the live hoppers at all. Then I 
asked Mr. Beasley where they came from. 

¡®¡°Rocky Mountains,¡¯ he answered, 
shortly. 

¡°This seemed a bit steep, for the nearest 
of the Rocky Mountains are nearly a thou- 
sand miles west of Kansas. And to think 
of grasshoppers flying a thousand miles! 



A bit too much, that was. Still I thought 
I ought to go home and tell the folks. But 
mother interrupted me in my picturesque 
tale with a dry request for the meat. Oh, 
yes. Oh ¡ª well, I had forgotten. So the 
first disagreeable result for me from the 
grasshopper invasion of Kansas in the sum- 
mer of 1876 was a painful domestic inci- 
dent. 

¡°But Mr. Beasley was right. The grass- 
hoppers had come. Next morning all the 
boys were out, each with a folded news- 
paper for flapper and a cigar-box with lid 
tacked on and a small hole just large 
enough to push a hopper through cut in 
one end. The rumor was we were to be 
paid five cents for every hundred hoppers, 
dead or alive, that we brought in. As a 
matter of fact nobody paid us, but we 
worked hard for nearly half a day; that 
is as long as it was fun and novelty. By 
noon the grasshoppers were an old story 
to us. And besides there were too many 





of them. Hundreds, thousands, millions, ¡ª 
oh, billions and trillions I suppose. And 
all eating, eating, eating! 

¡°First all the softer fresher green things. 
The vegetables in the little backyard gar- 
dens; the sweet corn and green peas and 
tomato- and jrotato-vines. Then the flow- 
ers and the grasses of the front yards. Then 
the leaves of the dooryard trees. Then the 
fresh green twigs of the trees! Then the 
bark on the younger branches!! 

¡°And you could hear them eat! Nip- 
ping and crunching, tearing and chewing. 
It got to be terrible, and everybody so 
downcast and gloomy. And the most aw- 
ful stories of what was going on out in 
the great corn-liclds and meadows and 
pastures. Ruin, ruin, ruin was what the 
hop])ers were mumbling as they chewed. 

¡°And then the reports from the other 
states in the great Mississippi Valley corn- 
belt came in by telegraph and letter. Over 
thousands and thousands of square miles 





of the great granary of the land were 
spread the hordes of hoppers. Farmers 
and stockmen were being ruined. Then 
the storekeepers and bankers that sell 
things and lend money to the farmers. 
Then the lawyers and doctors that depend 
on the farmers¡¯ troubles to earn a living. 
Then the millers and stock-brokers and 
capitalists of the great cities that make 
their fortunes out of handling and buying 
and selling the grain the farmers send in 
long trains to the centers of population. 
Everybody, the whole country, was aghast 
and appalled at the havoc of the hopper. 

¡°What to do? How long will they keep 
up this devastation? Have they come to 
settle and stay in Kansas and Nebraska 
and Iowa? What will the country do in 
the future for corn and wheat and pigs and 
fat cattle? 

¡°Well, it would be too long a story to 
tell of how all the entomologists went to 
work studying the grasshoppers and their 





ways: their outsides and insides, their 
hopping and their flying, their egg-la5dng 
and the growth and development of the 
little hoppers; how the birds, and what 
kinds, stuffed on them, and the robber- 
flies and the tachina flies and the red mites 
and the tiny braconids and chalcids at- 
tacked them and laid eggs on them, and 
their grubs burrowed into them; and every- 
thing else about them. But all the time 
the hoppers kept right on eating; at least 
they did where there was anything left to 
eat. Stories were told of their following 
roots of plants and trees down into the 
ground to eat them; of how they stripped 
great trees of bark and branches; of how 
they massed on the warm rails of railroads 
at nights and stopped trains; of how en- 
terprising towns by offering rewards to 
farmers collected and killed with kerosene 
great winrows and mounds composed of 
innumerable bushels and tons of grass- 
hoppers. 


*¡®Some people of active mind and fertile 
imagination suggested that if the grass- 
hoppers were going to eat up all our usual 
food, we should learn to eat them! And 
they got chemists to figure out how much 
proteids and carbohydrates and hydrocar- 
bons and ash, etc., there was in every little 
hopper¡¯s body. And there was a remark- 
able dinner given in St. Louis by a famous 
entomologist to some prominent men of 
that city, in which grasshoppers were served 
in several different ways: hopper sauU, 
hopper au gratin, hopper escallopp^, hopper 
souffle, and so on. The decision of the 
guests ¡ª those who lasted through the din- 
ner ¡ª was that ¡®the dry and chippy char- 
acter of the tibiae was a serious objection 
to grasshoppers as food for man.¡¯ 

¡°But you want to know the end of it 
Mary, don¡¯t you? Well, it was a very sim- 
ple end. Simply, indeed, that the hoppers 
went back! Yes, actually, when autumn 
came they all ¡ª ^that is, all that hadn¡¯t been 





eaten by birds and toads and lizards, or 
collected by farmers and burned, or hadn¡¯t 
got walked on by horses and people, or 
hadn¡¯t got studied to death by entomolo- 
gists ¡ª flew up into the air and sailed back 
lo the Rocky Mountains. Or at least they 
started that way. I never heard if any of 
them really got all the thousand of miles 
back. Ihit whereas in the summer they 
had all been flying southeast, in the fall 
they all began flying northwest. 

¡°But some of them had laid eggs in the 
ground in little cornucopia-like packets 
before dying or flying away. And much 
alarm was caused by predictions that mil- 
lions of new hoppers would come out of 
the ground in the coming spring and eat 
all the crops while young, even if the old 
ones or more like them didn¡¯t come again 
in the summer and eat the mature crops. 
But these predictions were only partly ful- 
filled. Not many hatched out in the 
spring, and those that did seemed to be 


more anxious to get back to the Rocky 
Mountains where their brethren were than 
to eat the Kansas crops. Indeed as soon 
as the young hoppers got their wings ¡ª and 
that takes several weeks after they come 
from the egg ¡ª they began flying north- 
west. 

¡°So this remarkable and terrible inva- 
sion was over. And all the poor farmers, 
and the bankrupt or about to be bankrupt 
storekeepers and bankers and the idle 
lawyers and doctors and the terrified cap- 
italists and the hard-studying entomolo- 
gists drew a long breath of relief together.¡± 

¡°But have the hoppers come back any 
time since 1876?¡± asks Mary. 

¡°No, that was the last invasion. There 
had been earlier ones, though, one or two 
of them just as bad as the Centennial-year 
one. Indeed Kansas was called the Grass- 
hopper State on account of these terrible 
summer invasions. There was a bad one 
in 1866 and another in 1874. The inva- 




sions of 1874 and 1876 cost the farmers of 
the Mississippi Valley at least fifty millions 
of dollars in crops eaten up.¡± 

¡°But what made them come to Kansas? 
Why didn¡¯t they stay in the Rocky Moun- 
tains? It¡¯s much more beautiful and in- 
teresting there than in Kansas, isn¡¯t it?¡¯¡¯ 

¡°Much, Mary. But it probably wasn¡¯t 
a matter of scenery with these tourist hop- 
pers. Much more likely a matter of food. 
In those days there were no farmers with 
irrigated fields on the great plateaus along 
the eastern base of the Rocky Mountains 
in Colorado and Wyoming. Nothing much 
but sage-brush and not overmuch of that 
grew there. And probably there simply 
wasn¡¯t enough food for all the hoppers. So 
in seasons when there were too many hop- 
pers or too little food ¡ª ^and if there was one, 
there was also the other ¡ª ^they flew up into 
the air, spread their broad wings and 
sailed away on the winds from the north- 
west for a thousand miles to Nebraska and 



Kansas and Texas. And that made an 
invasion.¡± 

¡°But, then, why didn¡¯t they stay there, 
where there were cornfields and wheat- 
fields and vegetables?¡± persisted Mary. 

¡°Mary, I can only tell you what the hard- 
studpng entomologists decided about this, 
and published along with all the other 
things they found out, or thought they 
did, in several big volumes devoted to the 
grasshoppers. They found out that the 
hoppers tried to go back because they 
couldn¡¯t stay! That is, odd as it may 
seem, either the climate or the low altitude 
or something else uncomfortable about 
Kansas and Missouri disagrees with the 
Rocky-Mountain hoppers and they can¡¯t 
live there permanently. They can¡¯t raise 
a family there successfully; at least it 
doesn¡¯t last for more than one generation. 
They have to live on the high plateaus of 
the northern Rockies, but they can get on 
very well for a single summer away from 




home. Then they must get back if they 
can. And so it was that the hoppers that 
came to Kansas solved the weighty prob- 
lem and relieved the great anxiety of the 
farmers and the whole country in general 
as to what was to become of the great grain- 
lickls of the Middle West, by going back 
home again. 

¡°And will they ever evade Kansas 
again?¡¯¡¯ 

¡°'I'liat, Mary, is not a question for a 
stick-to-what-is-known scientific person like 
me to answer. But as ever since farms 
and grain-lields and vegetable gardens have 
been established on the Rocky Mountain 
])lateaus by the farmers who kee]) moving 
west, the hoppers haven¡¯t come back to 
Kansas, and as this is jnobably because 
they have enough food at home in these 
Colorado and Wyoming fields, I should be 
very much surprised if they ever come back 
to Kansas again.¡± 

¡°Yes, but weren¡¯t you surprised that 



first time you saw them in the Sentinel 
year?¡± 

¡®¡®Mary, you are a (juibbler. Well, then. 
I¡¯ll say that I don¡¯t think they¡¯ll ever make 
another foreign invasion. There!¡± 

It is time for ns to stroll home for lunch- 
eon. As we get nj) from under the live- 
oak, a stum]))'-bodied little grasshopper 
whirs away in front of us. 

¡®¡®To think that such a little thing could 
make a summer evasion one thousand 
miles away from heng¡± said Mary. 

¡®¡®Much littler things have done much 
bigger things,¡± I rejily, with my serious 
manner of lecturer-after-luncheon. 




We were sitting in the warm sun on the 
very tip-top of Bungalow Hill. This is a 
gentle crest that rises three hundred and 
fifty feet above the campus level, and gives 
one a wonderful view far up and down the 
beautiful valley and across the blue bay to 
the lifting mountains of the Coast Range. 
Scpiare-shouldered old Mt. Diablo standing 
as giant warder just inside the Golden Gate, 
the ocean entrance to California, looms 
massive and threatening directly to our 
east, while to its south stretches the long 
brown range with its series of peaks. Mis- 
sion, Mt. Hamilton, Isabella, and so on, 
way down to the twdn Pachecos that guard 
the pass over into the de.sert. In the north 
rises Mt. Tamalpais, the wonderful fog 
mountain that looks down on the busy life 




at its feet of San Francisco, and its clus- 
tering child cities growing up rapidly these 
days, while the mother is l5dng ill of her 
wounds by earthquake and conflagration. 
To the south stretch the long orchard 
leagues of the Santa Clara Valley, with the 
little white spots of towns peeping out 
from the massed trees so jealous of every 
foot of fertile ground. And to the west ¡ª 
ah, that is the view that Mary and I lie 
hours long to look at and drink in and feel, 
¡ª "our view,¡± we call it. 

We think we see things there that other 
people cannot. We see these things es- 
pecially well when we half-close our eyes, 
and describe what we see in a sort of low, 
drowsy, monotone murmur. Then the 
fringe of towering spiry redwoods along 
the crest of the mountain range that lies 
between us and the great ocean and lifts 
its forested flanks full two thousand feet 
above xis, becomes a long row of giants¡¯ 
spears sticking up above the battlements 



of a mighty castle. And the shadow-filled 
somber slashes and tunnel-like holes of the 
dropping canons arc the great entrances 
and doors to this castle. At our feet the 
broad shallow Canada that stretches all 
along the foot of the mountains and was 
made ages ago by some tremendous earth- 
quake seems, seen through our half-closed 
eyes, to be full of water and to be really a 
broad moat shutting off all access to the 
castle. 

The giants themselves we have never 
yet seen. But some day when the light is 
just right, and they are stirring themselves 
to look out at the world, we probably shall. 
Perhaps if we had been up here that day 
not long ago when the last earthquake 
came, we should have seen the giants look- 
ing out to see who was knocking at their 
gates. For it will take an earthquake¡¯s 
knocking ever to be felt in the heart of 
that mountain castle where the giants keep 
themselves. 





The air was so clear tliis day that it 
seemed as if we could s(;e each individual 
great redwood, each red-trunked, glossy- 
leaved madrono, each thicket of crooked 
manzanita and purpling Ceanothus, on the 
whole mountain side. Straight across 
through the clear blue-tinged atmosphere 
above the Canada to the shoulders and 
canons, tli(' forests and clear spaces and 
chaparral of the mountain flanks, we look. 
And it rests our eyes that are so tired of 
reading. It is good to be a-stretch on sun- 
bathed liungalow Hill this afternoon in 
October. The rains will be coming in a 
few weeks and then we can¡¯t be out so 
much. Or at any rate wc can¡¯t lie close 
to tlie warm, brown, dry earth as we can 
now. But the rains will bring the fresh, 
green grasses and the flowers. If they 
come early enough the manzanitas will 
have on their little trembling pink-white 
lily-of-the-\'alley bells by (ihristmas-day, 
and the wild currants will be all green-and- 



rose color, with little leaves and a myriad 
fragrant blossoms. 

But Mary has found something. She 
had turned over a little flattish stone and 
under it was ¡ª life! Living things dis- 
turbed in their work, their play, their lay- 
ing up of riches, their care of their children; 
little animate creatures revealed in all the 
intimacies of their housekeeping and daily 
life. 

But they didn¡¯t lose their presence of 
mind, these active, knowing little ants, 
when the Catastrophe came. There was 
work to be done at once and wisely. First, 
the saving of the children; and so in the 
moment that passed between Mary's over- 
turning of the stone and our immediate 
shifting into comfortable position on our 
stomachs, head in hands, for watching, 
half of the racing workers had each a lit- 
tle white parcel in its jaws and was speed- 
ing with it along the galleries toward the 
underground chambers. 




¡°Ants¡¯ eggs/¡¯ said Mary. 

¡°No,¡± said I. ¡°That¡¯s a popular delu- 
sion. These little white things are not 
ants¡¯ eggs, but ants¡¯ babies. They are the 
already hatched and partly grown young 
ants, the larvae and pupae, which are so 
well looked after by the nurse ants. For 
these young ants are quite helpless, like 
young bees in the brood-cells in a honey- 
bee hive. And they have to be fed chewed 
food, and as they have no legs and so can¡¯t 
walk, they have to be carried from the cool 
dark nurseries up into the warmer lighter 
chambers for air and heat every day al- 
most, and then carried back down again. 
See how gently the nurse ant holds this 
baby in its jaws; jaws that are sharp and 
strong and that can bite fiercely and hold 
on grimly in battle.¡± 

And I hand Mary my little pocket-lens 
through which she tries to look with both 
eyes at once. She could, of course, if she 
would keep her blessed eyes far enough 




away, but as she persists in holding the 
glass at the tip of her nose as she has seen 
me do, and as she cannot shut one eye 
and keep the other open, as I can, and 
have done now so many years that I have 
wrinkles all round the shut-up eye, why, 
she makes bad work of it. So she hands 
back the lens with a polite "thank you,¡± 
and sticks to her own keen unaided eyes. 
And sees more than I do! 

For in the next breath she cries, with a 
little note of triumph in her voice: "But 
some of the ant babies are walking. See 
there! And you said they have no legs. 
I can see them; little stumpy blackish legs 
sticking out from their soft white body! 
And some of the ants are carr5dng these 
babies with legs; I can see them!¡± 

I squirm around nearer Mary. True 
enough there are some little white chubby 
creatures walking slowly around in the 
narrow runways. But I know they cannot 
be ant larvae. For ant larvae have no legs 




and simply can¡¯t walk. What are they? 
1 get out the little pocket-lens. And the 
mystery is solved. They are the ¡°ant- 
cattle,¡± the curious little mealy-bugs that 
many kinds of ants bring into their nests 
and take care of for the sake of getting 
from them a constant supply of ¡°honey- 
dew.¡± This ¡°honey-dew¡± which the mealy- 
bugs make and give off from their bodies 
is a sweetish syrupy fluid of which almost 
all ants, even those most fiercely carnivo- 
rous, arc very fond. And as the mealy- 
bugs and plant-lice that make the honey- 
dew are quite defenceless, soft-bodied, 
mostly wingless and rather sedentary in- 
sects, the bright-witted ants establish col- 
onics, or ¡°herds,¡± of them in their nests, or 
visit and protect colonics of them living on 
plants near the ant-nest. Some kinds of 
ants even build earthen ¡°sheds,¡± or tents, 
over groups of honey-dew insects on plant- 
stems. The mealy-bugs arc white because 
they cover their soft little bodies with del- 




icate threads or flakes of glistening white 
wax which they make in their bodies and 
pour out through tiny openings in the 
skin. 

We watch the busy, excited ants until 
they have carried all their babies and cat- 
tle down into the underground nursery 
chambers, out of harm¡¯s way. Then we 
put the stone carefully back in place, and 
roll back again to where we can watch the 
wonderful mountains in the west. The 
redwood-fringed crest stands so sharply out 
against the sky-line that we really can 
distinguish every tree that lifts its head 
above the crest, although they arc several 
miles away from us. These great trees, 
which are the giants¡¯ jagged spears, arc one 
hundred and fifty feet high, some of them, 
and as big around at the base as one of 
the massive columns in the Cologne 
Cathedral. 

Finally I say, rather lazily, ¡°Mary, shall 
I tell you about the special way the clever 



lyS Insect Stories 

little brown ant of the Illinois corn-fields 
takes care of its cattle?¡± 

"Yes, please, if it isn¡¯t too long,¡± says 
Mary. 

Mary and I are on perfectly frank terms. 
We are polite, but also inclined to be hon- 
est. And Mary is not going to be an un- 
resisting victim of a garrulous old professor. 
But Mary need not be afraid that I sha¡¯n¡¯t 
know when I am boring her. We have 
wireless communication, Mary and I. 
That¡¯s one, probably the principal, reason 
why we are such good companions. No 
true companionship can possibly persist 
without wireless and wordless communica- 
tion. 

¡°All right,¡± I answer, ¡°here goes, Mary. 
Say when!¡± 

¡°I forget how many millions of bushels 
of corn were raised in the state of Illinois 
last year, but they were very many. And 
that means thousands and thousands of 
acres of corn-fields. Now in all these com- 


fields there live certain tiny soft-bodied 
insects called corn-root aphids. Their food 
is the sap of the growing corn-plants which 
they suck from the roots. Although each 
corn-root aphid is only about one-twentieth 
of an inch long and one-twenty-fifth of an 
inch wide and has a sucking-beak simply 
microscopic in size, yet there are so many 
millions of these little insects all with their 
microscopic little beaks stuck into the 
corn-roots and all the time drinking, drink- 
ing the sap which is the life-blood of the 
corn-plants that they do a great deal of 
injury to the corn-fields of Illinois and 
cause a great loss in money to the farmers. 

¡°So the wise men have studied the ways 
and life of these little aphids to see if some 
way can be devised to keep them in check. 
The aphids live only two or three weeks, 
but each one before it dies gives birth to 
about twelve young aphids. Now this is 
a very rapid rate of increase. If all the 
young which are born live their allotted 




two or three weeks and produce in their 
turn twelve new aphids, we should have 
about ten trillion descendants in a year 
from a single mother aphid. Ten trillion 
corn-root aphids, tiny as they are, would 
make a strip or belt ten feet wide and two 
hundred and thirty miles long! 

¡°Some other kinds of a]:)hids multiply 
themselves even more rai)idly. An English 
naturalist has figured out that a single-stem 
mother of the common aphis, or ¡®green- 
fly¡¯ of the rose, would give origin, at its 
regular rate of multiplication and provided 
each individual born lived out its natural 
life, which is only a few days at best, to 
over thirty-three (puntrillions of rose aphids 
in a single season, ecpial in weight to more 
than a billion and a half of men. Of course 
such a thing never happens, because so 
many of the young aphids get eaten by 
lady-bird beetles and flower-fly larvae and 
other enemies before they come to be old 
enough to produce young. 




¡°However, besides this rapid increase of 
the corn-root aphids, there is something 
else that helps them to be so formidable a 
pest. And this is that they find very good 
and zealous friends in the millions of little 
brown ants that also live in the Illinois 
corn-fields. These swift, strong, brave lit- 
tle ants make their runways and nests all 
through the corn-fields, and are very de- 
voted helpers of the soft-bodied helpless 
aphids. For the aphids pay for this help 
by acting as ¡®cattle¡¯ for the ants. 

¡°This is what Professor Forbes, a very 
careful and a very honest naturalist, found 
out about the ants and the aphids. The 
eggs of the aphids, hosts of shining black, 
round, little seed-like eggs, are laid late in 
the autumn. These eggs are gathered by 
the ants and heaped up in piles in the 
galleries of their nests, or sometimes in 
special chambers made by widening the 
runways here and there. All through the 
winter these eggs are cared for by the ants, 




being carried down into the deeper and 
warmer chambers in the coldest weather, 
and brought up nearer the surface when it 
is warm. When the sunny days of spring 
begin to come, the eggs are even brought 
up above ground and scattered about in 
the sunshine, then carried down again at 
night. The little ants may be seen some- 
times turning the eggs over and over and 
carefully licking them as if to clean them 
of dust-particles. 

¡°In the late spring the aphid eggs hatch, 
and the young must have sap to drink 
right away. Their little beaks are thirsty 
for the plant-juices that are their only 
food. But there are no tender corn-roots 
ready for them in the fields because the 
corn has not yet been planted. What, then, 
shall the hungering baby aphids and their 
foster-mothers, the little brown ants, do? 

¡°This is what happens. Although it is 
too early yet for the corn to be growing, 
there are various kinds of weeds that be- 




gin to sprout with the coming on of spring, 
and two of these, especially, the smart- 
weed and the pigeon-grass, abundant and 
wide-spread in all the Mississippi Valley, 
are sure to be growing in the fields. While 
the aphids much prefer corn-roots to live 
on, they will get along very well on the 
roots of smart-weed or pigeon-grass. So 
the clever little brown ants put the almost 
helpless baby aphids on the tender roots of 
these weeds, and there their tiny beaks 
begin to be satisfied. Don¡¯t you call that 
clever, Mary?¡± 

¡°Clever! Gracious!¡± says Mary. ¡°Do 
you know Professor Forbes? Is he really 
¡ª does he always tell the¡ª¡± 

I interrupt. I am sensitive about such 
questions. I answer rather sharply. ¡°Yes, 
I do know him; and yes, he always tells 
the truth. Don¡¯t interrupt any more, 
please, for there is still more of the story.¡± 
Mary is silent. 

¡°Well, the aphids stay on the smart- 




weed roots until the corn is planted, which 
is in about ten days, and the kernels begin 
to germinate and to send down the tender 
juice-filled roots. And then the little 
brown ants take the aphids, now getting 
larger and stronger, of course, but still too 
helpless or stupid to do much for them- 
selves except to suck sap, and carry them 
from the smart-weed roots to the corn- 
roots ¡ª What¡¯s that, Mary?¡± 

But Mary had said nothing; just drawn 
in her breath with a little sound. Still I 
think it best to remind her that I do know 
Professor Forbes and that he really does 
always tell the truth. In fact, I quote to 
Mary this honest professor¡¯s exact words 
about this transfer of the aphids from the 
weed-roots to the corn-roots. This is what 
he writes in his intensely interesting ac- 
count of the whole life of these little in- 
sects; ¡°In many cases in the field, we 
have found the young root aphis on sprout- 
ing weeds (especially pigeon-grass) which 




have been sought out by the ants before 
the leaves had shown above the ground; 
and, similarly, when the field is planted to 
com, these ardent explorers will frequently 
discover the sprouting kernel in the earth, 
and mine along the starting stem and place 
the plant aphids upon it.¡± 

¡°And the little brown ants do all this 
so as to get honey-dew from the aphids?¡± 
asks Mary. 

¡°Exactly,¡± I reply. ¡°The ants take 
such good care of the aphids not because 
they pity their helplessness or just want 
to be good, but because they know, by 
some instinct or reason, that these are the 
insects that, when they grow up, make 
honey-dew, which is the kind of food that 
ants seem to like better than any other. 
Indeed not only the little brown ants alone 
take care of the corn-root aphids to get 
honey-dew, but at least six other kinds of 
ants that live in the Illinois corn-fields do 
it. But the little brown ants are the most 





abundant and seem to give the aphids the 
best care.¡± 

¡°It is exactly like keeping cows, isn¡¯t 
it,¡± says Mary. ¡°But they don¡¯t have to 
milk them.¡± 

¡°Well,¡± I reply, ¡°I don¡¯t know what 
you would call it, but some other ants that 
take care of some other kinds of honey- 
dew insects seem to have to carry on a 
sort of milking performance to make them 
pour out their sweet liquid. The ants have 
to pat or rub them with their hairy little 
feelers; sort of tickle them to get them to 
squeeze out a little drop of honey-dew. 
The truth is, Mary, if I should tell you the 
really amazing things that ants do, you 
simply wouldn¡¯t believe me at all. But 
the next time we go out. I¡¯ll take you to 
see for yourself an ant community right 
on the campus that does some remarkable 
things. I¡¯d much rather have you see the 
things yourself than tell you about them.¡± 

¡°I¡¯d rather, too,¡± says Mary, which isn¡¯t 






exactly the nicest thing she could say, but 
I know what she means. It¡¯s that seeing 
is better than being told by anybody. 

And then the up-and-down ¡° ding, dang, 
dong, ding,¡± of the clock-bells begins its 
little song in four verses that means the 
end of an hour. And then come the six 
slow deep calls of the biggest bell that tell 
what hour it is. It is the hour for us to 
go home. 










¡°But why didn¡¯t he go back if he liked 
France so much better; and if he had 
plenty of money?¡¯¡¯ asked Mary. 

¡°Ah, well, even having plenty of money 
doesn¡¯t always make it possible to do just 
what we prefer,¡¯¡¯ I say. ¡°The truth is, ¡ª 
if it is the truth, and not just malicious 
gossip, ¡ª ^it was exactly because he had 
plenty of money that he couldn¡¯t go back. 
He is supposed to have got that money in 
some wrong way. Anyway, he didn¡¯t seem 
to care to go back to la belle France, but 
preferred to live solitarily here, and to 
plant Hnes of trees and lay out little lakes 
and build rockwork towers and make ter- 
races and driveways and paths, all in very 
formal lines, as in the parks at Versailles 






and St. Cloud, which were the playgrounds 
of French kings and the pride of all France.¡± 

Mary and I were seated on a curious 
little cement-and-stonc imitation tower- 
ruin that stuck up out of Frenchman¡¯s 
Pond, which is near the campus, and is a 
good place for seeing things and getting 
away from the classroom bells. A long 
row of scraggly Lombardy poplars stretches 
away from the pond along an old terraced 
roadway with a cave opening on it . Around 
two sides of the little lake is a rockwork 
wall, and across one end, where the pond 
narrows, is a picturesque stone bridge of 
single span. Everything is neglected, and 
altogether Frenchman¡¯s Pond and its sur- 
roundings are a good imitation of some- 
thing old and foreign in this glaringly new 
and extremely Californian bit of the world. 
It is a favorite place for us to come when 
I want to tell Mary stories of the castles 
on the Rhine. We get a proper atmos- 
phere. 




It was so sunny and warm tliis morning 
that we had given up chatting and were 
simply sitting or sprawling as comfortably 
as we could on the irregular top of our Aus- 
sichtsthurm. A few fl3dng dragons, some 
in bronze-red mail, some in greenish blue, 
were wheeling about over the pond, and a 
meadow-lark kept up a most cheerful sing- 
ing in the pasture nearby. It was really 
just the sort of day and place and feeling 
that Mary and I like best. We knew we 
ought, as persevering Nature students, to 
get down and poke around in the weeds 
and ooze of the edges of the pond so as to 
see things. But we didn¡¯t want to do it, 
and so we didn¡¯t. That is one perfectly 
beautiful thing about the way Mary and I 
study Nature. We don¡¯t when we don¡¯t 
want to. 

But if we didn¡¯t climb down to the live 
things this day at Frenchman¡¯s Pond, they 
came up to us. One of the flying dragons 
actually swooped so close to our heads that 



we could hear its shining brittle wings 
crackle, and only a few minutes after, a 
curious delicate little creature' with four 
gauzy wings, a pair of projecting eyes with 
a fixed stare, and three long hair-like tails 
on its body, lit on Mary¡¯s hand and walked 
slowly and rather totteringly up her bare 
wrist and fore arm. Then without any 
fluttering or struggling, it slowly fell over 
on one side and lay quite still. It was 
dead! 

This rather took our breath away. We 
are only too well accustomed, unfortu- 
nately, to seeing death come to our little 
companions; they do not live long, at best, 
and then so many of them get killed and 
eaten. But they usually make some pro- 
test when Death approaches. They do not 
surrender their brief joy of living in such 
utterly unresisting way as this little crea- 
ture did. But when I had got my spec- 
tacles properly adjusted, I saw what it was 
that had died so quietly and suddenly. 





The little gauzy-winged creature was a 
May-fly, or ephemera, and life with the 
May-flies is such a truly ephemeral thing, 
and death comes regularly so soon and so 
swiftly, and without any apparent illness 
or injury intervening between health and 
dissolution, that we naturalists have ceased 
to wonder at it. Although this is not be- 
cause we understand it at all. Far from 
it. Indeed the death of any creature, ex- 
cept from obvious accident or wasting ill- 
ness, is one of the mysteries of life. Which 
sounds rather Irish, but is just what I 
mean. 

But Mary was looking thoughtfully at 
this dead little May-fly in her hand. It was 
so soft and delicate of body, had such frail 
and filmy wings, that it seemed that it 
must have been very ill-fitted to cope with 
the hard conditions of insect living, to 
escape the numerous insect-feeding crea- 
tures and to find food and shelter for it- 
self, to be successful, in a word, in the 




"struggle for existence¡±! And in a way, 
this is quite true. But, in another way, 
it is not true. For the May-flies, in their 
flying stage, make up for their frailness 
and feebleness, their inability to feed ¡ª 
they have really no mouth-parts and do 
not eat at all in their few hours or days of 
flying life ¡ª by existing in enormous num- 
bers, and millions may be killed, or may 
die from very feebleness, and yet there are 
enough left to lay the eggs necessary for a 
new generation, and that is success in life 
for them. Nothing else is necessary; their 
whole aim and achievement in life seems 
to be to lay eggs and start a new genera- 
tion of May-flies. 

I settled back into a still more comfort- 
able position and said: "Did I ever tell 
you, Mary, of the May-flies¡¯ dance of death 
I saw in Lucerne once, not far from the old 
bridge across the Reuss with its famous 
pictures of our own dance of death? Well, 
then, we¡¯ll just about have time before the 






tower-clock calls us home. Do you want 
to hear about it?¡± 

¡°Yes, please,¡± said Mary. 

¡°Well, I had been studying in a great 
university in an old German town all the 
spring and early summer and had come to 
Switzerland for my vacation. You know 
there are splendid mountains there ¡ª ¡± 

¡°The Alps,¡± interrupted Mary. ¡°The 
highest is Mt. Blanc, 15,730 feet above the 
sea.¡± 

How Mary does know her geog- 
raphy! 

¡® ¡®And beautiful lakes,¡± I continue. ¡® ¡®And 
the roads are good for tramping, and the 
hotels cheap. Anyway, the ones the stu- 
dents go to. I had come to Lucerne from 
Zurich¡ª¡± 

¡°Noted for its silks and university where 
women can go,¡± Mary broke in again. 

Bless me, what¡¯s the use of going to 
Europe anyway, if you learn ever3rthing 
about everywhere in the grades? 




¡°And had gone straight to the Muhlen- 
hrucke,¡± I go on, ¡ª ¡°that¡¯s the old bridge 
all covered with a roof that crosses the 
Reuss only a few rods from where it flows 
out of the lake; the lake of Lucerne, you 
know.¡± 

¡°Of course,¡± said Mary. 

¡°For it is on the ceiling of that bridge,¡± 
I persist, ¡°that these curious old Dance of 
Death pictures are painted, and I had 
heard a great deal about them. They show 
how everybody is dancing through life to 
his grave. Not very pleasant pictures, 
Mary.¡± 

¡°Very unpleasant, I should think,¡± says 
Mary, positively. ¡°I hope you didn¡¯t 
look at them long.¡± 

¡°No, because, for one reason, it was get- 
ting too dark to see them. The sun had 
set behind the Gutsch ¡ª that¡¯s a pretty hill 
just west of Lucerne ¡ª and the electric 
lights were already flashing along the lake- 
shore promenade. You know what a won- 




derfully beautiful lake Lucerne is, of course, 
Mary?¡± 

¡°Yes; it is unsurpassed in Switzerland, 
perhaps in Europe, for magnificence of 
scenery,¡± replies Mary, in level voice. 

I resolve to cut geographic informa- 
tion out of any further stories I tell Mary. 
Do they commit Baedeker to memory 
nowadays in the schools? 

¡°Exactly,¡± I manage to reply without 
betraying too much astonishment at this 
revelation of the American educational 
method. 

¡°Well, along the shore of this unsur- 
passed lake at the town of Lucerne there 
is a broad promenade with trees and 
benches and electric lights. Behind it 
are the big hotels all in a curving row, and 
after dinner all the people come out and 
stroll about while the band plays. It is a 
fine sight.¡± 

Mary seemed to be getting a little less 
than interested. She squirmed into a new 





position on the rough rockwork and then, 
looking out over the little pond with its 
hawking dragons whizzing back and forth, 
she asked: ¡°What about the May-flies, 
please?¡± 

I really believe she knew all about the 
hotels and promenade and the band. 
What wonderful schools! 

¡°I was coming ¡ª I have just come to 
them,¡± I reply with dignity. 

I am a professor and have a certain 
stock supply of dignity to draw on when 
necessary. It isn¡¯t often necessary with 
Mary. 

¡°Well, as I came from the covered Miih- 
lenbrucke and out on to the lake-shore 
promenade, I saw a little crowd of people 
gathered under and about a brilliant arc- 
light hanging in an open place in front of 
the great Schweizerhof Hotel. The light 
seemed to me curiously hazy, and even 
before I got near the crowd I had made a 
guess at what was going on. My guess 




that it was a May-fly dance of death was 
quite right. Perhaps it would really be 
better to call it a ¡®dance of life,¡¯ for it 
really was sort of a great wedding dance. 
But it was a dance of death, too, for the 
dancers were falling dead or dying out of 
the dizzying whirly circles by thousands. 
How many hundreds or thousands or mil- 
lions of May-flies there were in the dense 
circling cloud about the light, I have no 
idea. But the air for twenty feet every 
way from the light was full of them, and 
the ground for a circle of thirty or forty 
feet underneath was not merely covered 
with the delicate dead creatures, but was 
covered for from one to two inches deep! 

¡°The crowd of promcnaders looked on 
in gaping wonder. Not one seemed to 
know what kind of creature this was, nor 
of course anything about what was really 
going on; that this was all of the few hours 
of feverish life which these May-flies en- 
joyed in their winged state, and that they 





gave it all up to the business of mating 
and egg-la5nng; where they came from, 
how they had lived before, why they 
should be here to-night and no other in 
the whole year, all these things which it 
seems to me the onlookers ought to have 
wanted to know, nobody seemed to know, 
nor anybody seemed particularly to care 
to. 

¡°But there are places in the world where 
the people do want to know these things, 
and a great many more, about the May- 
flies. One such place is the Thousand 
Islands in the St. Lawrence River. One 
day I was sailing down this river among 
the Thousand Islands, and the acquaint- 
anceship of a small and unusually dehcate 
kind of May-fly was forced on me by the 
hundreds of them that persisted in alight- 
ing on my clothes, my hat, and my hair. 
They kept walking unsteadily about over 
my face and hands and the open pages of 
the book I was trying to read. And they 




kept dying, dying, all around. One would 
light on the outer edge of the page, and 
before it had walked across to the begin- 
ning of a sentence, it would die and its 
body would slide gently down into the 
back of the book and ¡ª be a book- 
marker!¡± 

¡°That¡¯s not a very nice way to talk 
about the poor little dead May-flics,¡± said 
Mary, rather seriously. 

¡°It isn¡¯t, Mary, I know,¡± said I. ¡°But 
we¡¯ve got to relieve the gloom of this tale 
someway, don¡¯t you think? There is too 
much wholesale death in it to suit my pub- 
lisher! And so I am trying to introduce 
a little jocularity into it, don¡¯t you see, 
Mary?¡± 

¡°People are not supposed to be very 
funny at funerals,¡± said Mary, severely. 
¡°Where did the little Thousand Islands 
May-flies come from, and why do the people 
there want to know about them?¡± 

¡°Because there are so many May-flies 



that they are a great pest. Not by eating 
crops ¡ª for there aren¡¯t any, I suppose, and 
the May-flies don¡¯t eat anything an5rway ¡ª 
nor by carrying malaria, but just by living 
and dying all over; everywhere in one¡¯s 
summer cottage, down on the river-bank 
where you are watching the sunset, under 
the trees when you are lying in your ham- 
mock and trying to read, in your rowboat 
when you are paddling about to visit your 
neighbors on other islands. To be walked 
on and died on by hundreds and hundreds 
of little flies, and all the time, grows to be 
very uncomfortable. So the May-flies or 
river-flies or lake-flies as they are variously 
called are cordially hated by all the Thou- 
sand-Islanders and the St. Lawrence- 
Riverers. And the people want to know 
about where they come from, and how they 
live, and all about them, indeed, so as to 
try to find some way to be rid of 
them.¡± 

¡°And do you know where they come 





from, and how they live, and all about 
them,¡± asks Mary, with a slightly roguish 
manner, I fear. 

¡°Well, I know something. In the first 
place, after the dance of death, the few 
that don¡¯t die fly out over the lake or 
river or pond and drop a lot of little eggs 
into it. Then they die happy ¡ª if May- 
flies can be happy. Mind you, I don¡¯t say 
they can. We are the only animals that 
we know can be happy. And we mostly 
aren¡¯t. From the eggs hatch young May- 
flies without wings or long thread-like tails, 
but just little, flat, under- water creatures 
with gills along the sides so they can 
breathe without coming up to the surface. 
Some kinds burrow into the mud at the 
bottom, some kinds make little tubes or 
cases in which to live, while others stay 
mostly on the under side of stones. They 
eat little water-plants or broken-up stuff 
they find in the water, although some eat 
other little live animals, even other young 





May-flies. And many of them get eaten 
themselves. They are favorite food of the 
under- water dragons. Y ou remember, don¡¯t 
you, Mary, how our dragons of Lagunita 
would snap up the young May-flies in 
Monday Pond? 

¡°Well, these young May-flies ¡ª the ones 
that don¡¯t get eaten by dragons, stone- 
flies, water-tigers, and other May-flies ¡ª 
grow larger slowly, and wing-pads begin 
to grow on their backs. In a year, maybe, 
or two years for some kinds, they are 
ready for their great change. And this 
comes very suddenly. Some late after- 
noon or early evening thousands of young 
May-flies of the same kind, living in the 
same lake or river, swim up to the surface 
of the water, and, after resting there a few 
moments, suddenly split their skin along 
the back of the head and perhaps a little 
way farther along the back, and like a 
flash squirm out of this old skin, spread 
out their gauzy wings and fly away. They 




do this so quickly that your eye can hardly 
follow the performance.¡± 

¡°And then they all fly to the light and 
begin their dance of death,¡± breaks in 
Mary. 

¡°No, wait; they are not yet quite ready 
for that. First, they do a very unusual 
thing; something that no other kinds of 
insects have ever been seen to do. This 
is it: They fly away to a plant or bush or 
tree at the water¡¯s edge, and there they 
cling for a little while and then cast their 
skin again.¡± 

¡°The new skin they have just got, with 
the wings and everything?¡± asks Mary. 

¡°Exactly; the new skin. It comes ofl 
of the wings, off of the long tails and the 
short feelers, and all the rest of the body. 
No other kind of insect but the May-fly 
casts its skin once its wings are outspread. 
But now the May-fly is ready for its dizzy 
dance. And as it has only a few hours to 
do it in, it usually starts as soon as there 




are any lights to dance about. Think of 
it, to come up from under the water, get 
your wings and be a real May-fly, not just 
a crawling thing on the bottom of a pond, 
and have only one evening to live in! Prob- 
ably to dance the whole evening through is 
about the best thing to do under such cir- 
cumstances.¡± 

¡°Don¡¯t any of the poor May-flies live for 
more than one evening?¡± asks Mary. ¡° It 
does seem a shame to put in so long a time, 
one year, two years for some, getting ready 
to fly and then have only one evening or 
night for flying.¡± 

¡°Well, yes, some do, Mary. That is, 
there are many different kinds of May- 
flies; some large ones, some small ones, 
some kinds with four wings, some kinds 
with only two, and the length of the 
fl3dng time is not the same for all these 
kinds. Some live a day, some two, some 
perhaps even three or four. But there are 
several kinds whose flying life is just a few 





hours; they are born, that is, as flying 
creatures, after sundown and they die be- 
fore the next sunrise. The first kind of 
May-fly whose life was ever carefully stud- 
ied ¡ª this was nearly two hundred and fifty 
years ago, by a famous naturalist of Hol- 
land ¡ª lives only five hours after it comes 
from the water. But remember what a 
fine long time they have being young! If 
we could be young ¡ª but there, that¡¯s fool- 
ish. Mary, the chimes in the tower-clock 
are sounding. Listen!¡± 

And we sit perfectly still and hear the 
beautiful Haydn changes on the four bells, 
and then count twelve clear strokes of the 
big clock-bell that come all the way from 
the Quadrangle to us, softened and mel- 
lowed by the distance. We must go home 
to luncheon. And after luncheon I must 
go and lecture ¡ª Ugh! How sad! ¡ª sad for 
the students and sad for me. But that¡¯s 
the way we do it, and until we find the real 
way, we must all continue to suffer together. 




¡°Come, Mary, we¡¯re off. How would 
you like to be a May-fly?¡¯¡¯ 

¡°And have only one day to live when 
I¡¯m all grown up?¡¯¡¯ 

¡°You might be saved some troubles, 
Mary.¡± 





Fuzzy was distinguished from most of 
her brothers and sisters, when we first be- 
came acquainted with her, by the fine 
head of hair which she had. It has been 
several weeks now since we first saw her, 
and there are bald places already ¡ª so stren- 
uous has been her life. To be sure that we 
should be able to recognize her even after 
she became worn and bald, like the others, 
we dabbed a spot of white paint on her 
back between the shoulders, and although 
old age and its attendant ills, including 
the loss of much of her hair, have come on 
rapidly, the white spot is still there, and 
we know Fuzzy whenever we see her. 

We were watching what was going on in 
Fuzzy¡¯s glass house at the very time that 


Fuzzy first came out of her six-sided little 
private nursery room. In this she had 
spent all of her three weeks of getting 
hatched from an egg ¡ª we had seen her 
own very egg laid by the queen mother! 
¡ª then of living as a helpless baby bee 
without wings or feet or eyes or feelers, 
and having to be fed bee- jelly and bee- 
bread by the nurses, and then as a slowly 
maturing young bee with legs and wings 
and eyes and feelers all forming and grow- 
ing. Part of this time she had been shut 
up in her room by having the door sealed 
with wax, and she had had no food at all. 
But she had been fed enough at first to 
last her through the days when she had no 
food. 

It was the twentieth or twenty-first day 
since she had been born, that is, had 
hatched from the little, long, white, seed- 
like egg that the queen bee had laid in this 
six-sided waxen room or cell. And Fuzzy 
was all ready to come out into the world. 







So she tried her strong new trowel-like 
jaws on the thin waxen door of her room, 
and found no trouble at all in biting a hole 
through it large enough to let her wriggle 
out. Which she did right under our very 
eyes. 

Indeed we had planned Fuzzy¡¯s glass 
house and had had it built in the way you 
see it in Sekko¡¯s picture just so we could 
see plainly and certainly what goes on in 
the house of a bee family. Everybody has 
watched bees outside gather pollen and 
drink nectar and hang in great swarms, 
and do the various other things they do 
in their outdoor life. But not everybody 
has seen what goes on indoors. Many peo- 
ple have seen the inside of a hive every 
now and then. But it is always when the 
bees are greatly excited and often when 
the people are too. And so besides seeing 
that the honey and pollen are in such and 
such combs and cells and the young bees 
in others, some of them in open and some 




in closed cells, and perhaps a few other 
things, one doesn¡¯t learn much by peering 
into a hive through a mass of smoke-dazed 
bees while dodging a few extra-lively and 
energetic ones! 

Mary and I had watched bees outside 
and we had looked into lots of hives and, 
of course, had learned a little about indoor 
bee ways. But ever since we got Fuzzy¡¯s 
glass-sided house built and a community 
of pretty amber-bodied gentle Italians liv- 
ing in it, we have never got over being 
sorry for ourselves in the old days and 
sorry for other people all the time. For 
it is so easy and sure, so vastly entertain- 
ing and utterly fascinating to sit quietly 
and comfortably in chairs (one of us on 
each side) for hours together and see all 
the many things that go on in the bee¡¯s 
house. The bees are not disturbed in the 
sliglitest by our having the black cloth 
jacket off of the hive and by the light shin- 
ing in through the great window-like sides 




of the house, nor by Mary¡¯s bright eyes and 
my round spectacles staring ever so hard 
at them. 

We have seen the queen lay her eggs, 
the little bees hatch out, the nurse bees 
feed them, the foragers come in and dance 
their whirling dervish dance and unload 
their baskets of pollen and sacs of honey, 
the wax-makers hang in heavy festoons and 
make wax, the carrying bees carry the wax 
to the comb-builders, and the comb-builders 
build comb of it, the house-cleaners and the 
ventilators clean house and ventilate, and 
the guards stopping intruders at the door. 
We have heard the piping of the new 
queens in their big thimble-like cells, and 
seen them come out, and the terrible ex- 
citement and sometimes awful tragedy 
that follows; we have seen the wild ecstasy 
that comes before swarming out, and the 
swarming itself begin in the house; we 
have looked in at night and found some of 
the bees resting, but others working, and 





always some on guard; we have seen the 
lazy drones loaf all the morning and then 
swing out on their midday flight and come 
back and fall to drinking honey again; we 
have seen a great battle when our gentle 
Italians fought like demons and repulsed 
a fierce attack of foraging black Germans, 
and again a nomad band of yellow-jackets; 
and we have seen the provident workers 
kill the drones and even drag young worker 
bees from their cells when the first cold 
weather comes on. We have seen, in truth, 
a very great deal of all the wonderful life 
that these wise and versatile little crea- 
tures live in their nearly perfect coopera- 
tive community. But above all we have 
followed with special interest and affec- 
tionate pride the education and experi- 
ences of Fuzzy, our most particular friend 
in all the thousands of our gentle Italian 
family. 

Fuzzy must have been very glad to get 
out finally from her tight, dark, little cell 




and into the airy, light hive, with all of her 
sisters and brothers moving around so lively 
and busily. And she must have been es- 
pecially delighted when she went to the 
open door of the house for a peek out ¡ª 
for she wasn¡¯t allowed really to go out- 
doors for exactly eight days ¡ª and saw the 
beautiful arcades of the outer Quadrangle 
underneath her and the red-tiled roof on a 
level with her, and then the great eucalyp- 
tus trees and the beautiful live-oaks in the 
field beyond, and far off on the horizon 
the crest of the distant mountains, with 
the giant redwoods standing up against 
the sky-line. You have a glimpse in 
Sekko¡¯s picture of all this that Fuzzy saw 
that day. That is, if she could see so 
much. I am afraid she couldn¡¯t. 

¡°But what are those other bees doing 
to her,¡± cried Mary in some alarm, as two 
or three workers crowded around Fuzzy 
just as she came from her cell. ¡°Are they 
trying to bite her?¡± 





¡°Not the least in the world,¡± I hasten 
to answer reassuringly. ¡°Just look sharp 
and you will see.¡± And Mary did look 
sharp and did sec. And she clapped her 
hands with glee. ¡°Why, they are licking 
her with their long tongues; cleaning her, 
just as a cat docs her little kittens,¡± sang 
Mary. Which was exactly so. For a bee 
just out from its nursery cell is a very 
mussed-up looking, and, I expect, rather 
dirty little creature. And it needs clean- 
ing. 

It was soon after Fuzzy had got cleaned 
and had her hair brushed and had begun 
to wander around in an aimless way in the 
glass-sided house that we got hold of her 
and dabbed the spot of white paint on her 
back. We did it this way. She had 
walked up to just under the roof of the 
house near where you sec (in Sekko¡¯s pic- 
ture) one of the cork-stoppers sticking up 
like a little chimney-pot. These corks 
stop up two round holes in the roof which 




we had made for the express purpose of 
putting things, ¡ª other insects, say, ¡ª into 
the hive to see what the bees would do 
with them, and also to take out a bee when 
we wanted to experiment with it. When 
Fuzzy got up just under one of the holes, 
we took the cork-stopper out gently and 
thus let her come walking slowly up and 
out on top of the roof. Then we caught 
and held her very gently with a pair of 
flat-bladed tweezers, and put the white 
paint on. Then we dropped her back 
through the hole and put the cork in its 
hole. 

We watched Fuzzy for a long time after 
she came out of her cell that day, and al- 
though she walked about a great deal, she 
only once ventured near the real door or 
entrance-slit of the hive through which 
the foraging bees were constantly coming 
and going. And next day we watched 
many hours and looked often between 
regular watching times, always finding 





Fuzzy in the house. And so for eight 
days. And then she made her first ex- 
cursion outside. 

It was interesting to watch her on this 
eighth day. She would fly a little way 
out, then turn around and come in. Then 
she would fly out farther, turn around, 
hover a little in front of the window, and 
finally come in again. A lot of other 
young bees were doing the same thing. 
They seemed to be getting acquainted 
with things around the door of the house 
so they would know how to find it when 
they came back from a long trip. On the 
ninth day Fuzzy brought in her first loads 
of pollen, two great masses of dull rose- 
red pollen held securely in the pollen- 
baskets on her hind legs. And after that 
she brought many other loads of pollen 
and later sacs of honey. 

But you must not imagine that Fuzzy 
was idle during all those eight days before 
she went outside of the glass house. Not 



a bit of it. No bees are idle. But yes, 
the drones. Big, blunt-bodied, hairy, 
blundersome creatures that move slowly 
about over the combs. Not over the 
nursery combs where there is work to be 
done, feeding and caring for the young 
bees. Dear me, no. But over the pantry 
combs. They keep close to the honey- 
pots and bread-] ars. But even they have 
their work. Each day from spring into 
late summer they all, or nearly all, fly out 
about eleven o¡¯clock and circle and trav- 
erse the air for long di.stances in search 
of queens. Then in the early afternoon 
they come back and fall to sipping honey 
again. 

However, to return to Fuzzy and her 
work in those first eight days spent all 
inside the house. One day Mary saw 
Fuzzy stretching her head down into one 
open cell after another in the brood-comb. 
At the bottom of each of these cells was a 
little white grub; a very young bee, of 





course, only one or two or three or four 
days out from the egg. Several days be- 
fore (it takes only three days for a bee¡¯s 
egg to hatch) we had seen the beautiful 
long slender-bodied queen moving slowly 
about over these cells, with her little circle 
of attendants all moving with her with 
their heads always facing toward her. 
She would thrust her long hind body down 
into one of these empty cells and stand 
there (juietly for two or three minutes. 
Then draw her body out and go on to 
another. And in the cell she had just left 
we could see plainly a tiny seed-like white 
speck stuck to the bottom of the cell. It 
was an egg of course. That is nearly all 
the queen does; she simply goes about all 
through the spring and summer laying 
eggs, one at a time, in the nursery or brood- 
cells. There is one other thing she does, 
or really several things, at the time of the 
appearance or the birth of a new queen. 
But that will come later. 




We do seem to have trouble keeping to 
Fuzzy and her life, don¡¯t we? Well, when 
Mary saw Fuzzy sticking her head down 
into the cells with the bee-grubs in, she 
knew at once what Fuzzy was doing. For 
it was plain that the young bees had to 
have something to eat and it was plain, 
too, that they couldn¡¯t get it for them- 
selves, for they have no legs, and can¡¯t 
even crawl out of their cells. Fuzzy was 
feeding them. She would drink a lot of 
honey from a honey-cell, and cat a lot of 
pollen from a pollen-filled cell, and then 
make in her mouth or front stomach (for 
bees have two stomachs, one in front of 
the other), or in certain glands in her head 
(it doesn¡¯t seem to be exactly known 
which), a very rich sort of food called bee- 
jelly. Then she sticks the tip of her long 
tongue into the mouth of the helpless, 
soft-bodied little white bee-grub and pours 
the food into it. After the bee-grub is 
two or three days old, the nurse bees ¡ª 




and that is what Fuzzy could be called 
now ¡ª feed the babies some honey and 
pollen in addition to this made-up bee- 
jelly, unless the baby is to be a queen bee, 
and then it gets only the rich bee-jelly all 
the time. 

Mary thought Fuzzy should have a neat 
cap and white apron on and drew a clever 
little picture of Fuzzy as a nurse. But we 
arc being very careful in this book not to 
fool anybody, and if we should print the 
picture Mary drew, some people would be 
stupid enough to think that we meant 
them to believe that the nurse bees wear 
uniforms! We say right now that they 
don¡¯t, and that you can¡¯t tell them from 
the other bees except that most of them 
are the younger or newly issued bees and 
hence haven¡¯t lost any of their hair, and so 
look ¡°fuzzier¡± than the other bees in the 
hive. For just as with Fuzzy, so with the 
other younger bees; they stay in the hive 
for a week or more and act as nurses. 



When they once are allowed to go out, 
and begin bringing in pollen and honey, 
however, then the new bees are ready to 
do any of the many other things that have 
to be done inside the hive. One day Mary 
saw Fuzzy standing quite still on the floor 
of the house, with her head pointed away 
from the door and held rather low, while 
her body was tilted up at an angle. She 
just stood there immovable and apparently 
doing nothing at all. Suddenly Mary 
called out: ¡°Why, what has happened to 
Fuzzy.? Her wings are gone!¡¯¡¯ I hurried 
to look. And it did seem, for a minute, 
as if Mary were right. Which would have 
been a most surprising and also a most 
terrible thing. But my eyes seemed to 
see a sort of blur or haze just over Fuzzy¡¯s 
back, and I bade Mary look close at this 
blur with her sharp eyes. And Mary 
solved the mystery. 

¡°She is fanning her wings so fast that 
you can¡¯t see them,¡¯¡¯ cried Mary. ¡°And 



here is another bee about two inches in 
front of Fuzzy doing the same thing; and 
another,¡± called out Mary, who was greatly 
excited. And it rather did seem as if these 
bees had gone crazy, or were having a very 
strange game, or something. Until I made 
Mary remember what would happen to us 
if not just three or four or five or six of us, 
but many thousand ¡ª indeed in Fuzzy¡¯s 
house there are more than ten thousand ¡ª 
were shut up in one house with but a 
single small opening to let fresh air in and 
bad air out. For bees breathe just as we 
do, that is, take fresh air into their bodies 
and give out poisonous air. And then 
Mary understood. Fuzzy and the other 
bees fanning their wings so fast and stead- 
ily were ventilating the house! They were 
making air-currents that would carry the 
poisonous air, laden with carbonic-acid 
gas, out of the door, and then fresh air 
would come in to replace it. 

And another time Fuzzy kept Mary 



guessing a little while about what she was 
doing. We had looked all through the 
crowds of nurses and wax-makers and 
comb-builders and house-cleaners without 
finding Fuzzy. And we decided she was 
out on a foraging trip, when Mary caught 
sight of our white-spotted chum loafing 
about in the little glass-covered runway 
that leads from the outer opening into the 
house proper, a sort of little glass-roofed 
entry we have arranged so that we can see 
the foragers as they alight and come in, and 
the various otlier things that go on by the 
door. Fuzzy seemed to be loafing, but 
both Mary and I have seen so much of the 
feverish activity and the constant work of 
bees in the hive, and out of it for that mat- 
ter, that we never expect to find a worker 
honey-bee really loafing. They literally 
work themselves to death, dying some- 
times at the very door of the hive, with the 
heavy baskets of pollen on their thighs, 
the gathering and carrying of which has 




been the killing of them. Only the bees 
that over-winter in the hive must have 
some sj)are moments on their hands. And 
here in California even these are few, for 
a certain amount of foraging goes on prac- 
tically all the year round. 

But Fuzzy did seem to be loafing there 
in the entry. Until Mary¡¯s sharp eyes 
discovered her important business. She 
was one of the warders at the gate, a guard 
or sentinel told off, with one or two others, 
to test each arrival at the entrance. As a 
forager would alight and start to walk in 
through the entry. Fuzzy would trot up 
to it and feel it with her sensitive antennae. 
If the newcomer were a member of the 
community, all right; it was passed in. 
But if not, ¡ª if it were one of the vicious 
black Germans from the other observation 
hive that stands close by, opening out of 
the same window indeed, ¡ª there would be 
an instant alarm and a quick attack. Two 
or three Italians would pounce on the in- 





trader, who would either hurry away or, 
if bold enough to fight, would get stung to 
death and pitched unceremoniously out of 
the entry. Or if it were a stray yellow- 
jacket attracted by the alluring odor of 
honey from the hive, one of the same 
things would happen. One day not a 
single German came, but an army, a guer- 
rilla band intent on pillage and murder. 
And then there was a grand battle ¡ª but 
we must wait a minute for that. 

There were also other enemies of Fuzzy¡¯s 
glass house besides German bees and yel- 
low wasps. There is a delicate little 
moth, bee-moth it is called, that slips into 
the hive at night all noiselessly and with- 
out betraying its presence to any of the 
bees if it can help it. And it lays, very 
quickly indeed, a lot of tiny round eggs in 
a crack somewhere. It doesn¡¯t seem to 
try to get out. At any rate it rarely does 
get out. For it almost always gets found 
out and stung to death and pulled and 



torn into small pieces by the enraged bees, 
who seem to go almost frantic whenever 
they discover one of these innocent-seem- 
ing little gray-and-brown moths in the 
house. And well they may, for death and 
destruction of the community follow in 
the train of the bee-moth. From the eggs 
hatch little si.xteen-footed grubs that keep 
well hidden in the cracks, only venturing 
out to feed on the wax of the comb near- 
est them. As they grow they need more 
and more wax, but they protect them- 
selves while getting it by spinning a silken 
web which prevents the bees from getting 
at them. Wherever they go they spin 
silken lines and little webs until, if several 
bee-moths have managed to lay their eggs 
in the hive and several hundred of their 
voracious wax-eating grubs are spinning 
tough silken lines and webs through all 
the corridors and rooms of the bees¡¯ house, 
the household duties get so difficult to 
carry on that the bee community begins 



to dwindle; the unfed young die in their 
cells, the indoor workers starve, and the 
breakdown of the whole hive occurs. 
Such a thing happened in this very glass 
house of Fuzzy¡¯s a year before we got ac- 
quainted with Fuzzy herself. And we 
had to get a new family of bees to come 
and live in the house after we had cleaned 
out and washed and sterilized all the 
cracks and corners so that no live eggs of 
the terrible bee-moth remained. 

Some days we found Fuzzy at work 
with several companions on more ])r()saic 
and commonplace things about the house; 
chores they might be called. She had to 
help clean house occasionally. For the 
bees are extremely cleanly housekeepers, 
with a keen eye for all fallen bits of wax, 
or bodies of dead bees, or any kind of dirt 
that might come from the housekeeping of 
so large a family. Every day the hive is 
thoroughly cleaned. If there conies a day 
when it is not, that is a bad sign. There 





is something wrong with the bee commu- 
nity. They haven¡¯t enough food, or they 
arc getting sick, or something else irregu- 
lar and distressing is happening. 

Also the house has to be ¡°calked¡± occa- 
sionally to keep out draughts and more 
particularly creeping enemies of the hive, 
like bcc-moths and bee-lice. The cracks 
are pasted over with propolis, which is 
made from resin or gum brought in from 
certain trees. If something gets into the 
hive that can¡¯t be carried out, then the 
bees cover it up with propolis. If they 
find a bee-moth grub in a crack where they 
can¡¯t get to it to sting it to death, they 
wall it up, a living prisoner, with propolis. 
Once our bees kept coming in with a curi- 
ous new kind of propolis; a greenish oily- 
looking stuff that stuck to their legs and 
got on their faces and bodies and wouldn¡¯t 
clean off. We discovered that they were 
trying to unpaint a near-by house as fast 
as it was being freshly painted! 



Fuzzy took her turn at all these odd 
jobs, and though she was beginning to 
show here and there a few places where 
her luxuriant hair was rubbed off a little, 
she was still as lively and willing and in- 
dustrious as ever. Every day we liked 
her more and more and wished, how many 
times, that we could talk with her and tell 
her how much we liked her, and have her 
tell us how she enjoyed life in the glass 
house. But we could only watch her and 
keep acquainted with all her manifold 
duties and hope that nothing would hap- 
pen to her on her long foraging trips for 
pollen and nectar and propolis. When- 
ever Mary and I came to the glass house 
and couldn¡¯t find Fuzzy, we were in a sort 
of fever of excitement and apprehension 
until she came in with her great loads of 
white or yellow or red pollen and went to 
shaking and dancing and whirling about 
in the extraordinary way that she and her 
mates have while hunting for a suitable 


pantry cell in which to unload ncr pollen- 
baskets. Sometimes she would walk and 
dance and whirl over almost all of the pol- 
len-cells in the house before she would 
linally decide on one. Then she would 
stand over it and pry with the strong 
sharp spines on her middle legs at the 
solidly packed pollen loads on her hind 
legs, trying to loosen them so they would 
fall into the cell. Sometimes she simply 
couldn¡¯t get the pollen loads loose, and 
then a companion would help her. And 
after they were loosened and had fallen 
into the cell, she or a companion would ram 
her head down into the cell and pack and 
tamp the soft sticky pollen loads down 
into one even mass. And then how in- 
dustriously she would clean herself, draw- 
ing her antennae through the neat little 
antennae combs on her front legs, and lick- 
ing herself with her long flexible tongue, 
or getting licked by her mates all over. 

Perhaps as she was washing herself after 



a hard foraging trip, the stately and grace- 
ful queen of the house would come walk- 
ing slowly by, looking for empty cells in 
which to lay eggs. Then Fuzzy would 
turn around, head toward the queen, and 
form part of the little circle of honor that 
always kept forming and re-forming around 
the queen mother. For the honey-bee 
queen is the mother of all the great family, 
and her relation to the community is 
really the mother relation rather than 
that of a reigning queen. She does not 
order the bees; indeed, the worker bees 
seem to order her. They determine what 
cells she may have to lay eggs in and when 
she shall be superseded by a new queen. 
And when they decide for a new queen, 
they immediately set to work in a very 
interesting way to make one. 

This is the way, as Mary and I saw it 
through the glass sides of Fuzzy¡¯s house. 
First, a little group of workers went to 
work tearing down, apparently, some comb 




already made; that is, they began on the 
lower edge of a brood-comb, in the cells of 
which the old queen had just laid eggs, 
to tear out the partitions between two or 
three of the cells. What became of the eggs 
we couldn¡¯t tell, for they are very small, 
and the bees were so crowded together 
that we could see only the general results 
of their activity. Soon it was evident that 
they were building as well as tearing down, 
and a new cell, much larger than the usual 
kind and quite different in shape, began to 
take form. It was like a thimble, only 
longer and slenderer, and it had the wide 
end closed and the narrower tapering end 
open. They worked excitedly and rapidly, 
and the new cell steadily grew in length. 
Never was it left alone for a minute. Al- 
ways there were bees coming and going 
and always some clustered about. It was 
a constant center of interest and excite- 
ment. 

Mary and I knew of course that this was 




a queen cell, and that at its base there was 
one of the eggs laid by the old queen in a 
worker cell. This egg hatched, we knew, 
in a few days, although we could not see 
the little grub, but nurse bees were about 
constantly besides the cell-builders, and all 
the bees that came to the wonderful new 
cell seemed to realize that a very impor- 
tant, if at present rather grubby and 
wholly helpless, personage was in it. The 
cell finally got to be more than an inch 
long, and at the end of five days it was 
capped. A lot of milky bee-jelly had 
been stored in it before capping. After 
this nothing happened for seven days. 

Mary was in the room where the glass 
bee-houses are, and I was in an adjoining 
room, with the door between the two 
open. As I sat peering through my big 
microscope, I seemed to hear a curious un- 
usual sound from the bee-room, a sort of 
piping rather high-pitched but muffled. 
Perhaps it was Mary trying a new song. 




She has a good assortment of noises. But 
now came another sound; lower-pitched 
but louder than the other; a trumpet-call, 
only of course not as loud as the soldiers¡¯ 
trumpets or the ones on the stage when the 
King is about to come in. Then the shrill 
piping again; and again the trumpet an- 
swer. And finally a third and new sound, 
but this last unmistakably a Mary sound. 
And with it came the dear girl herself, with 
her hair standing on ¡ª well, no, I cannot 
truthfully say standing on end, but trying 
to. And her eyes shooting sparks and her 
mouth open and her hands up. 

¡°The bees,¡± she gasped, ¡°the bees are 
doing it!¡± 

There was no doubt of what ¡°it¡± meant. 
It was this sounding of pipes and trum- 
pets; these battle calls. 

I leaped to my feet; that is, if an elderly 
professor, who has certain twinges in his 
joints occasionally, can really leap. Any- 
way I knocked over my chair ¡ª and pre- 




cious near my microscope ¡ª in getting up, 
and started for the bees. And that shows 
the high degree of my excitement. But 
never before in all the years I had played 
with bees had I heard the trumpet chal- 
lenges of queen bees to the death duel. In- 
side the cell was the new queen shut up in 
darkness, but ready and eager to come out, 
and piping her challenge. And outside, 
brave and fearless, if old and worn, was the 
mother queen trumpeting back her de- 
fiance. It was the spirit of the Amazons. 

And what excitement in the hive! Sim- 
ply frantic were the thousands of workers. 
We watched them racing about wildly; up, 
down, across, back; but mostly clustering 
in the bottom near the queen cell. And 
working industriously at the cell itself, a 
a group of builders, strengthening and 
thickening the cell¡¯s walls especially at 
the closed lower end. They seemed to be, 
yes, they were, preventing the new queen 
inside from coming out. She was probably 




gnawing away with her trowel-like jaws at 
the soft wax from the inside, while they 
were putting on more wax and keeping her 
a prisoner. 

This went on for two or three days. 
The piping and trumpeting kept up inter- 
mittently, and the thickening of the cell 
constantly. Until the time came! 

And now I am going to disappoint you 
dreadfully. But much less than Mary and 
I were disappointed. We were not there 
when the time came! 

The bees were excited, I have said. 
Mary and I were excited, I have said. The 
bees put in all their time being excited and 
watching the queen cell. We put in most 
of ours. But we had to eat and we had to 
sleep. The bees didn¡¯t seem to. And so 
we missed the coming out. What a pity! 
How unfair to us! And to you. 

As there is by immemorial honey-bee 
tradition but one queen in a community 
at one time, when new queens issue from 





the great cells, something has to happen. 
This may be one of three things: either the 
old and new queens battle to death, and it 
is believed that in such battles only does 
a queen bee ever use her sting, or the 
workers interfere and kill either the old 
or new queen by ¡°balling¡± her (gathering 
in a tight suffocating mass about her), or 
either the old (usually old) or new queen 
leaves the hive with a swarm, and a new 
community is founded. In Fuzzy¡¯s com- 
munity this last thing happened when the 
new queen came out. 

Mary and I were on hand very early the 
morning of the third day after the piping 
and trumpeting had begun. As we jerked 
the black cloth jacket off the hive to see 
how things were, we were astonished at 
the new excitement that was apparent in 
the hive; the bees seemed to be in a per- 
fect frenzy and had suspended all other 
operations except racing about in appar- 
ent utter dementia. We could find neither 




the old queen nor the new queen in the 
seething mass, nor could we even see 
whether the queen cell was open or still 
sealed up. 

Another curious thing was that the tak- 
ing off of the black cloth jacket seemed to 
affect the bees very strongly. They had 
suddenly become very sensitive to light, 
and while, when the jacket was on, they all 
seemed to be making towards the bottom 
and especially towards the exit corner, 
which was the lower corner next to the 
window, as soon as we lifted off the jacket 
they seemed all to rush up to the top where 
the light was strongest. So nearly simul- 
taneous and uniform were the turning and 
rushing up that the whole mass of bees 
seemed to flow like some thick mottled 
liquid. 

It was evident that all this was the ex- 
citement and frenzy of swarming. And it 
was also evident that the bees, in their 
great excitement, were finding their way 




to the outlet by the light that came 
in through it. And when we removed the 
cloth jacket we confused them because the 
light now came into the hive from both 
sides and was especially strong at the top, 
which was nearest the greatest o.\i)anse of 
the outer window. So wc finally let the 
jacket stay on, and after a considerable 
time of violent exertion, the bees began to 
issue pell-mell from the door of the house. 
The first comers waited for the others, 
and there was pretty soon formed a great 
mass of excited bees around the doorway, 
and clustered on the stone window-sill 
just outside. Then suddenly the whole 
mass took wing and flew away together. 
And pretty soon all was quiet in the hive. 

Mary and I had been nearly as excited 
as the bees, and we were glad to sit and 
rest a little and get breath again. Soon it 
was luncheon time and we went off to 
Mary¡¯s house without looking into the 
hive. We had had just about all the bee 





observing we needed for one forenoon. 
But almost the first thing that Mary did 
at the table was to straighten up suddenly 
and cry out, ¡°I wonder if Fuzzy swarmed!¡± 
And thereafter that was all we thought of, 
and we made a very hasty meal of it. And 
the moment we got up we hurried back to 
Fuzzy¡¯s home and jerked off the black 
jacket. 

How quiet everything was inside. And 
how lessened the number of bees. Fully 
one-third of the community must have 
gone out. We set to work looking care- 
fully at all the remaining bees. It was 
only a minute or two before Mary clapped 
her hands and cried, ¡® ¡® She¡¯ s here 1 ¡± ¡® ¡® She ¡± 

was Fuzzy, of course. And we were both 
very glad that Fuzzy had not deserted the 
glass house¡ª and us. 

Some one came in and said that a ¡°lot 
of your bees are out here hanging on to 
a bush.¡± But we had seen ¡°swarms¡± 
before, and were much more interested 




in finding out what the bees do inside 
after a swarm has gone off than in watch- 
ing the swarm outside. We knew that 
¡°scouts¡± would fly away soon from the 
great hanging bunch or swarm to look for 
a suitable new home; a hollow tree, a de- 
serted hive, a box in hedge corner, any 
place protected and dark, and when they 
had found one, they would come back, and 
soon the whole swarm would fly off to the 
new house. Once one of our swarms 
started down a chimney of a neighbor¡¯s 
house, and immensely surj^rised the good 
people by coming out, with a great buzzing, 
into the fireplace! And another swarm, 
not finding a suitable indoors place, sim- 
ply began to build new combs hanging 
down from the branch of a cypress-tree in 
the Arboretum, and really made an out- 
door home there, carrying on all the work 
of a bee-community for months. But 
usually a bee-swarm gets found by some 
bee-keeper and put into an empty hive. 





And that is what happened to our desert- 
ers. 

After Mary had found Fuzzy, who seemed 
to have lost considerable hair and to have 
got pretty well rubbed in the grand melee, 
she continued to ])eer carefully through the 
glass side of the hive. And I looked care- 
fully too. Of course we wanted to find 
out about the (picens. Was there any 
queen left in our hive? We knew there 
must be a (picen with the swarm; bees 
don¡¯t go off without a (piecn. So if the 
old and new (jueen had fought and one had 
been killed, or if the workers had ¡°balled¡± 
the new queen when she came out, there 
could be no queen left in the hive. Of 
course this would not be very serious. 
For there were many eggs and also many 
just-hatched bee-grubs in the brood-combs, 
and the workers could easily make a new 
queen. But this wasn¡¯t necessary, for we 
soon found a graceful, slender-bodied bee, 
but so fresh and brightly colored and clean 




that we knew her to be the new queen and 
not the old. 

Things were perfectly normal and quiet. 
Some foragers were coming and going; 
house-cleaners were busily at work on the 
floor of the house, and nurses were moving 
about over the brood-cells. Not a trace 
of the wild frenzy of the forenoon. What a 
puzzling thing it is to see all the signs of 
tremendous mental excitement in other 
animals and yet not to be able to under- 
stand in the least their real condition! 
They may seem to do things for reasons 
and impulses that lead us to do things, but 
we can¡¯t be at all sure that their mental 
or nervous proces.ses, their impulses and 
stimuli, are those which control us. We 
can¡¯t po.ssibly put ourselves in their ])laces. 
For we are made differently. And there- 
fore it is plainly foolish to try to interpret 
the behavior of the lower animals on a 
basis of our understanding of our own 
behavior. Insects may see colors we can- 





not see; may hear sounds we cannot hear; 
smell odors too delicate for us to smell. 
In fact, from our observations and experi- 
ments, we are sure they do all these things. 
The world to them, then, is different from 
the world to us. And their behavior is 
based on their appreciation by their senses 
in their own way of this different 
world. 

What determines which queen shall leave 
the hive with the swarm? What deter- 
mines which five thousand out of fifteen 
thousand worker bees, all apparently simi- 
larly stimulated and excited, shall swarm 
out, and which ten thousand shall stay in? 
These are questions too hard for us to an- 
swer. We may take refuge in Maeter- 
linck¡¯s poetical conception of the ¡°spirit 
of the hive.¡± Let us say that the ¡°spirit 
of the hive¡± decides these things. As 
well as what workers shall forage and what 
ones clean house; what bees shall venti- 
late and what make wax and build comb. 




Which is simply to say that we don¡¯t know 
what decides all these things. 

The reduction in numbers of the in- 
mates of Fuzzy¡¯s house made it much 
easier to follow closely the behavior of 
any one bee, or any special group of bees 
doing some one thing. And both Mary 
and I had long wanted to sec as clearly as 
possible just what goes on when the bees 
are making wax and building comb. We 
had often examined, on the bodies of dead 
bees, the four pairs of five-sided wax- 
plates on the under side of the hind body. 
We knew that the wax comes out of skin- 
glands under these plates as a liquid, and 
oozes through the pores of the plates, 
spreading out and hardening in thin sheets 
on the outside of the plates. To produce 
the wax certain workers eat a large amount 
of honey, and then mass together in a 
curtain or festoon hanging down from the 
ceiling of the hive or frame. Here they 
increase the temperature of their bodies 




by some strong internal exertion; and after 
several hours or sometimes two or three 
clays, the line glistening wax-sheets appear 
on the wax-plates. Tliese sheets get 
larger and larger until they project beyond 
the edges of the body, when they either 
fall off or are plucked off by other workers. 

It was only two or three days after the 
excitement of the swarming out that 
Mary and I saw one of these curtains or 
hanging festoons of bees making wax, and 
you may be sure we tried to watch it close- 
ly. The bees hung to each other by their 
legs and kept quite still. The curtain hung 
down fully six inches from the ceiling of 
the house, and the first or upper row of 
bees had therefore to sustain the hanging 
weight of all those below. And there were 
certainly several hundred bees in the cur- 
tain. The wax-scales began to appear on 
the second day. And many of them fell 
off and down to the floor of the house. 
Some of the scales were plucked off by 




Other workers and carried in their mouths 
to where a new comb had been started be- 
fore the swarming, and either used by 
themselves to help in (lie coinb-biiilding or 
given to comb-buildcrs already at work. 
Some of the scales wcmc pluckc'd off by 
the wax-making workers themselves, who 
then left the curtain ami carried the 
wax-scales to the seat of the comb-build- 
ing operations. Various other workers 
picked up from the lloor the fallen scales 
and carried them to the comb-builders. 
These building be(?s would chew u|) ])ieces 
of wax in their mouths, mixing it with 
saliva, and then would f)ress and mould it 
with their little trowel-like jaws against 
the comb, so as to build up steadily the 
familiar six-sided cells. 

Each layer of comb is comjrosed of a 
double tier or layer of these cells, a com- 
mon partition or base serving as bottom 
of each tier. The cells to be used for brood 
are of two sizes, smaller ones for workers 





to be reared in, and larger ones for the 
drones. Sometimes the queen lays drone 
eggs in worker cells and then the cells have 
to be built up higher when the drone-grub 
gets too large for its cell. Sometimes, too, 
the worker bees lay eggs ¡ª this happens 
often in a hive bereft by some accident of 
its queen ¡ª but these eggs can only hatch 
into drones. Occasionally the workers 
make a mistake and build a queen cell 
around a drone egg. This happened once 
in our hive when there were no queen-laid 
eggs in the brood-cells, and some workers 
had laid eggs. The workers tried to make 
a new queen out of one of these eggs, but 
of course only a worthless drone came out 
of the queen cell. In building comb and 
cells for storing honey, new wax is almost 
exclusively used, but for brood-comb old 
wax and wax mixed with pollen may be 
used. Any comb or part of a comb not 
needed may be torn down and the wax 
used to build new comb or to cap cells with. 

 

I have said that the nearest neighbors 
of Fuzzy¡¯s family arc a lot of black Ger- 
man bees, housed in a larger liouse than 
Fuzzy¡¯s, but one also with glass sides so 
that we can see what goes on inside. The 
door of the house opens throiigli the same 
large window as that of Fuzzy¡¯s house, 
but the foragers coming back from their 
long trips rarely make a mistake in the 
doors, the Germans coming to their door 
and the Italians to theirs. The German 
community is much the larger, there being 
probably thirty or forty thousand workers 
in it, although of course only one queen, 
and only a few hundred drones. Some- 
times the foragers, both Germans and Ital- 
ians, make the mistake of coming to the 
wrong window of the room in which their 
houses are. There are five large windows 
all alike in the west wall of this room, and 
often we find our bees bumping against the 
other windows, especially the ones just 
next to the right one. They can¡¯t, of 





course, see in through these windows be- 
cause the room is much darker than out- 
side, and so all that the home-coming bees 
can see as they approach the building is 
a row of similar windows separated from 
each other by similar spaces of buffy stone. 
And keen as our bees are in finding their 
way straight to their hives from distant 
flower-fields, this repetition of similar win- 
dows seems to confuse some of them. 

But what I started to tell about is some- 
thing that happened between the neigh- 
boring bcc-houscs (juite different from the 
troubles of the bees finding their way 
home. It was something that gave Mary 
and me the principal excitement that we 
had in all our many days of watching 
bees. 

Mary ami I do not want to say that the 
Gennan bees knew that a third of Fuzzy¡¯s 
community had swarmed out and gone 
away. Though how they could help know- 
ing it really seems more a puzzle, for there 



was excitement and buzzing and window- 
sill covered and air full of bees enough to 
have told everybody within a rod of what 
was going on in the Italian house. But it 
was true that Fuzzy¡¯s community had 
never been troubled at all seriously 
by the belligerent (icrmans, until after 
it had been much reduced in strength 
by the loss of one-third of its members. 
And then this trouble did come, and came 
soon. So it looks as if tlic (lermans real- 
ized the weakness of their neighbors. But 
perhaps not. 

Just as our other exciting time beginning 
with the piping of the new (jneen and last- 
ing until the subsequent swarming was a 
discovery of Mary¡¯s, .so with this new time 
of high excitement; high excitement I 
may say both on our part and the bees¡¯. 
Mary was in the room where the bees arc, 
although not at the moment watching 
them, when she heard a sound of violent 
buzzing and humming. It grew quickly 





louder and shriller, and in a moment both 
communities were in an uproar. 

It was a battle, a great battle. On the 
one hand, a struggle by brutal invaders 
intent on sacking the home and pillaging 
the stores of a community given to ways of 
peace and just now reduced in numbers by 
a migration or exodus from home of a large 
group of restless spirits; on the other hand, 
a struggle for home and property and the 
lives of hundreds of babies by this weak 
and presumably timid and unwarlike peo- 
ple. A great band of Germans were at 
the door of Fuzzy¡¯s house trying to get 
in! They buzzed and pushed and ran 
their stings in and out of their bodies, 
and crowded the entry way full. But the 
Italian workers and guards had roused 
their community, and pouring out from the 
hive into the narrow entry was a stream 
of angry and brave amber bees, ready to 
fight to the death for their home. 

It was really a terrific struggle. The 




Italians, few in numbers as a community, 
were yet enough to oppose on fairly equal 
terms the band of Germans, for by no 
means all the Germans had come from 
their house. And the Italians had the 
great advantage of being defenders. They 
had only to keep out the black column 
trying to force its way in through the 
narrow door and entry. And they were 
no laggards in battle. They fought with 
perfect courage and great energy. Often 
a small group of Italians would force its 
way out of the door and into the very 
midst of the Germans outside on the win- 
dow-sill. These brave bees were all killed, 
overwhelmed by the superior numbers of 
the enemy. But not until they had left 
many dying Germans on the stone window- 
ledge were their own paralyzed and dying 
bodies hustled out of the way. 

In many cases the combat took on the 
character of duels between single pairs of 
combatants. A German and an Italian 




would clasp each other with jaws and legs, 
and thus interlocked and whirling over and 
over with violent beating of their wings 
would stab at each other until one or both 
were mortally wounded. All the time the 
frenzietl ball would be rolling nearer and 
nearer the outer ('dge of the treacherous 
sloping window-ledge, until finally over it 
would go, whirling in the air through the 
thirty feet of fall to the ground below. 
Here the .struggle would go on, if the 
fighters wen' not too stunned by the fall, 
until one or both bees were dead or para- 
lyzed. 

It is really too jiainful to tell of this fight. 
And it was painful to watch. But the end 
came soon. And it was a glorious victory 
for Fuzzy and her companions. The Ger- 
man robbers flew back, what were left of 
them, to their own hive. Mary and I 
tried all through the light to watch Fuzzy. 
Hut we saw her only once; she was in the 
entry then and nearly in the front row of 





fighters. We were glad to see her so 
brave, but fearful for her fate. After the 
fight we looked an.xiously througli the 
hive for our little white-spotted friend. 
We didn¡¯t see her, and were ready to 
mourn her for lost, wlien Mary happened 
to look out on the window-ledge where a 
few Italians were pushing the remaining 
paralyzed or dead Ciermans off. There 
was Fuzzy dragging, with murh (¡®ffort, a 
dead, black bee along tlic rough stone. 

We were very happy, then, and wanted 
more than ever to be able to talk to our 
brave little champion and rejoice with 
her over the splendid vii'tory. But we 
could only do as Fuzzy seemed to be doing. 
That is, take up again the work that lay 
at our hands. My work was to go into 
the lecture-room and talk to a class about 
the absence of intelligence and mind and 
spirit in the lower animals and the de- 
pendence of their behavior upon physics 
and chemistry and mechanics! Mary¡¯s 





work was to go out into the poppy-field 
and talk with the little grass people whom 
she never sees or hears, but knows are 
tliere. 










It was one evening not long after our 
afternoon on Bungalow Hill, where Mary 
had found the mealy-bugs in the runways 
of an ant¡¯s nest under a stone, and I had 
told her about the clever little brown ants 
and their aphid cattle in the Illinois corn- 
fields. Ever since that afternoon Mary 
had been asking (juestions about ants, and 
so this evening I was translating bits to 
her from a new Herman book about ants. 
It told about the cruel forays of the hordes 
of the great fighting and robbing Ecitons 
of the Amazons; of the extraordinary 
mutually helpful relations between the 
Aztec ants and the Imbauba tree of South 
America, which result in the ants getting 
a comfortable home and special food from 





the treCj while the tree gets protection 
through the Aztecs from the leaf-stealing 
Ecodomas. It told of the ants that live 
in the hollow leaves of the Dischidia plants 
in the Philippine Islands, and the way the 
plants get even by sending slender aerial 
rootlets into the leaves to feed on the dead 
bodies of the ants that die in the nests. 
It told of the ants in this country that 
build sheds of wood-pulp over colonies of 
honey-dew insects or ant-cattle on the 
stems of plants; of the fungus-garden 
ants of South America and Mexico and 
Texas that bite off little pieces of green 
leaves and make beds of them in special 
chambers in their underground nests, so 
that certain moulds grow on these leaf- 
beds and provide a special kind of food 
for the ant-gardeners. It told of the ants 
that make slaves of other ants, and get to 
depend so much on these slaves that they 
can¡¯t even care for their own children, and 
it told about the honey-ants of the Garden 





of the Gods that make some of the workers 
in each nest ¡ª but that¡¯s what this story 
is going to tell about, so we had better 
wait. 

But it was all a veritable fairy-story 
book, as any good book about the ways 
and life of ants must be. And Mary lis- 
tened eagerly. She liked it. When going- 
home time came she had, however, one 
insistent question to ask. ¡°Wliat can I 
see?¡± she demanded. ¡°What can I see 
right away; to-morrow?¡± 

¡°Mary you can ¡ª sec ¡ª to-morrow,¡± ¡ª and 
I think rapidly, ¡ª ¡°you can see ¡ª to-mor- 
row,¡± ¡ª still thinking, ¡ª ¡°ah, yes ¡ª yes you 
can; you can see them to-morrow.¡± 

¡°But what can I see to-morrow?¡± 

¡°Why the animated honey-jars; didn¡¯t 
I say what? No? Well, to-morrow we 
can go to see them; in the Arboretum at 
the foot of the big Monterey pine. I think 
I remember the exact place.¡± 

¡°But I thought the honey-ants weth 




only in Mexico and New Mexico and Colo- 
rado,¡± says Mary. ¡°Didn¡¯t the book say 
that?¡± 

¡°Yes, that kind; but we have a kind of 
our own here in California. The sort that 
McCook found in the Garden of the Gods 
and studied all that summer twenty-five 
years ago is found only there and in the 
Southwest, but there are two or three 
other kinds of honey-ants known, and one 
of them that has never been told about in 
the books at all is right here on the cam- 
pus. 'there are several of the nests here, 
or were a few years ago, aiul we¡¯ll go to- 
morrow and try to find one. It will be 
fine, won¡¯t it?¡± 

¡°Fine,¡± said Mary. ¡°Good-night.¡± 

And so the next morning we went. The 
Arboretum is a place where once were 
planted almost all the kinds of trees that 
t^'ow wild in ('alifornia, besides many other 
^r^ljiinds from Australia and Japan and New 
/.ealand ami Peru and Chili and several of 







the other Pacific Ocean countries. But 
the big, swift-growing eucalyptuses and 
Monterey pines have crowded out many of 
the other more tender and less-pushing 
kinds. However, it is still a wonderful 
place of trees. Many birds live there; 
swift troops of the beautiful plumed Cali- 
fornia quails; crimson-throated Anna hum- 
ming-birds, crestless California jays, fidget- 
ing finches and j uncos, spunky sparrows 
and wrens, chattering chickadees and tit- 
mice, fierce little fly-catchers and kinglets. 
There are winding paths and little-used 
roads in it, and altogether it is a fine place 
to go when one has only a short hour for 
walking and seeing things. 

And so Mary and I came with a garden- 
trowel and a glass fruit-jar to the foot of 
the big Monterey pine near the toyon. A 
toyon, if you arc an Easterner and need 
telling, is the tree that bears the red ber- 
ries for Christmas for us Pacific-Coast ''rs. 
It is our holly, as the Ceanothus io'''our 





lilac, and the poison-oak is our autumn- 
red sumac. 

At the foot of the Monterey pine we be- 
gan our search for the honey-ants. We 
didn¡¯t, of course, expect to find them walk- 
ing about with their swollen bodies full of 
amber honey, for the honey-bearers are 
supposed not to walk around, but to stay 
inside the nest, in a special chamber made 
for them. We looked rather for the honey- 
gatherers, the worker foragers. 

Pretty soon Mary found a swift little 
black ant. But, no, it was an Apheeno- 
gastcr that ¡ª 

¡°A feeno-gasscr?¡± asks Mary. ¡°What 
is that?¡¯¡¯ 

¡°That has the curious, flat -bodied dwarf 
crickets living with it in its nests,¡± I con- 
tinue. ¡° Myrmccophila, the ant-lover, they 
call this little cricket which has lost its 
win^s and its voice and is altogether an 
ins(i^nificant and meek little guest unbidden 
but' .tolerated at the ant¡¯s table. And here. 





here is a big black-and-brovvn carpenter- 
ant going home with a seed in its mouth.¡± 

¡®¡®Where is its home? Does it build a 
house out of wood? Let¡¯s follow it,¡± 
Mary bursts in. 

¡°No, we are after honey-ants, remember. 
We mustn¡¯t let ourselves get distracted by 
all these others. The carpenter-ants do 
make them.selvcs a home of wood, but 
they do it by gnawing out galleries and 
chambers in a dead tree trunk or stump 
or in a neglected timber. That isn¡¯t 
exactly building, but it is at least a kind 
of carpentering, a sort of ¡ª ¡± 

¡°Is this one?¡± interrupts Mary, poking 
violently at an angry red-headed little 
slave-maker ant that seemed anxious to 
get off to its home where its slaves, which 
are other ants captured when still young 
and unacquainted with tlieir rightful fam- 
ily, do all the work of food-getting and 
cleaning and taking care of the babies. 

And then I recognized a Prenolepis, that 





is, ¡ª and I do beg pardon, ¡ª one of our cam- 
pus honey-ants. Of course I suppose they 
are elsewhere in California and perhaps 
north in Oregon and east in Nevada and 
Arizona, but I have only seen them here, 
and hence always think of them as belong- 
ing exclusively with us campus-dwellers. 
It was a little brown ant with black hind 
body and paler under side. It isn¡¯t par- 
ticularly impressive, for it is only about 
one-eighth of an inch long, and its colors 
and appearance are much like those of 
many other ants, but there is something 
about it sulficiently distinctive to let one 
recognize it at sight. 

The thing to do now, of course, was to 
find its nest. There are various ways of 
finding the nest of any particular ant you 
may happen to discover running about 
loose over the country, but not one of them 
am I going to tell you. They are good 
things to work out for yourself. Mary and 
I know how, and so we had little trouble 





and didn¡¯t have to spend much time in 
finding the home of our wandering Preno^ 
lepis , ¡ª there it is again, ¡ª campus honey- 
ant I mean. And that is a fair name for 
it, for McCook who found the famous 
honey-ants of the (harden of the (iods in 
Colorado named his kind Myrmccocystus 
melliger hortusdcoriim, wliich is straiglit 
Latin and Greek for the ¡°lioney-pot ant 
of the Garden of the Gods.¡± But whal a 
name for a little ant one-eighth of an inch 
long to carry! 

It would take too many words and I am 
afraid would be too trivial a story for even 
this very happy-go-lucky little book to 
tell how Mary and I dug and dug in the 
ground near the foot of the trcng and how 
carefully we worked with our garden- 
trowel and mostly with our fingers! And 
how we traced out runway after runway 
and opened chamber after chamber of the 
honey-ant¡¯s nest until we found the honey- 
pantry with its strange jars of sweetness 




all hanging from the roof. The picture 
that Mary carefully sketched in, and that 
Sekko Shimada painted for us with his 
dainty Japanese brushes and little saucers 
of costly Japanese ink, shows very well 
])art of the nest, that part that had one of 
the honey-rooms in. You won¡¯t see the 
base of the Monterey pine-tree in the pic- 
ture, nor any of the other trees that were 
all around, because Mary didn¡¯t put them 
into her sketch, and we forgot to tell Sekko 
where the nest was. But the galleries and 
houey-chamber and the ants themselves 
are all right in Sekko¡¯s picture. 

In some of the galleries w'e had found 
ants with considerably swollen hind bodies, 
which evidently had the stomach or crop 
w'ell filled with some nearly transparent, 
pale yellowish-brown liquid. But it was 
not until we discovered the honey-pantry 
that we saw the extraordinary fully laden 
real live honey- jars, which were, of course, 
nothing but some of the worker ants hang- 



ing by their feet from the roof of the cham- 
ber, with their hind bodies enormously 
swollen by the great (jnantity of honey 
held in the crop. In opening the cham- 
ber we dislodged two or three of the honey- 
jars that fell to the floor and could hardly 
turn over or walk at all, so helpless were 
they. And one of them broke and the 
honey came out in a big drop, and I tasted 
it on the tip of my little finger, and it was 
sweet. So it was surely honey. And you 
should have seen how eagerly two or three 
other workers in the chamber, without 
swollen bodies, lapped up this sweet drop 
that came out of the body of the poor, 
broken honey-jar! 

As we had broken into the home of the 
honey-ants and had pretty nearly wrecked 
it, it seemed only fair that we should try 
to help our honey-ants begin another home 
under as kindly conditions as possible. So 
we put as many of them as we could find, 
foraging workers, honey-holders, and the 





(jueen whom we found in a special queen 
rooiUj into our glass fruit-jar with some 
soil, and brought them all home and put 
them into a formicary. Which is simply 
an artificial ants¡¯ nest, or house already 
arrangcfl for ants to live in. It has a place 
to hold food and has dark rooms and sunny 
rooms, cool rooms and warm ones, all nicely 
fixed with runways connecting them, and 
food is |)nf in as often as necessary and 
always in one ])lacc, which the ants learn 
to know very soon, indeed. This makes 
housekeeping easy and pleasant for the 
ants, and lets us see a great deal of how it 
is carried on, because there are glass sides 
and top to the house, so that by lifting lit- 
tle pieces of black cardboard or cloth we 
can look in and watch the ants at work. 

The honey-ants¡¯ colony seemed to live 
very contentedly in our formicary, for they 
went ahead with all their usual business of 
laying eggs and rearing babies and feeding 
them, and finding honey and getting the 




honey- jars loaded with it and hung by 
their feet from the ceiling of their room, 
and all the other things that go on regu- 
larly in a honey-ant¡¯s house. 

The principal thing we wanted to do, 
however, was to learn how the honey-jars 
got filled and also how they got emptied 
again! And this was not at all hard to 
find out, although we never found out cer- 
tainly where the worker foragers got their 
honey in the Arboretum. McCook found 
that his foragers in the Garden of the Gods 
gathered a sweet honey-dew liquid that 
oozed out in little drops from certain live 
oak-galls near the nest. But our ants 
seemed to be getting their honey from some- 
where up in the pine-tree, for there was a 
constant stream of them going up and 
down the trunk. Besides, many of those 
coming down had swollen bodies partially 
filled with honey, while none of those go- 
ing up did. Now the only honey supply 
in the pine-tree that we know is the honey- 




clew given off liberally by a brown roundish 
scale insect that lives on the pine-needles. 
So we think our honey-ants gathered their 
honey material from these honey-dew 
scale insects. But we have seen them 
collect honey stuff from various aphids and 
also from the growing twigs of live-oak 
trees. They seem to be willing to take 
it wherever they can find it. 

Of course we had to pro\ide a supply of 
honey for our indoor colony, and this sup- 
ply was eagerly and constantly visited by 
the foraging workers. They would lap it 
up and then go into the nest and feed the 
live honey-pots! That is, a well-fed for- 
ager would go into the honey-pantry and 
force the honey out from its own crop 
through its mouth into the mouth of one 
of the live honey-jars. Undoubtedly the 
honey-bee honey wo furnished them was 
considerably changtxl while in the body of 
the foraging worker. 

But all the time the nurses and workers 



inside the nest needed honey for food. And 
this they got by going to the honey-pantry, 
and by some gentle means inducing the 
live honey-pots to give up some of their 
store. Mouth to mouth the feeder and 
the filled honey-ant would stand or cling 
for some minutes. And there was no 
doubt of what was going on. The honey- 
pot was this time forcing honey out of its 
own over-filled crop and into the mouth 
of the nurse. 

Thus all the time there went on a con- 
stant emptying and replenishing of the 
strange honey-pots. What an extraor- 
dinary kind of life! Nothing to do but to 
drink and disgorge honey; to cling mo- 
tionless to the ceiling of a little room, or 
lie helpless, or feebly dragging about on 
the floor and be pumped into and pumped 
out of! To have one¡¯s body swollen to 
several times its natural size by an over- 
loaded stomach, and to be likely to burst 
from a fall or deep scratch! 




But there is simply no telling before- 
hand what remarkable condition of things 
you may find in an ant¡¯s nest. There is 
an ardent naturalist student of ants in the 
great museum of natural history in New 
York, who keeps publishing short ac- 
counts of the new things he is all the time 
discovering about the habits and life of 
ants. And if I didn¡¯t know him to be not 
only a perfectly truthful man but a trained 
and rigorously careful observer and scien- 
tific scholar, I should simply put his 
stories aside as preposterous. But on the 
contrary, as I do know them to be true, I 
am more and more coming to be able to 
believe anything anybody says or guesses 
about ants! Which is, of course, not a 
good attitude for a professor! 

Ur. Wheeler, this New York student of 
ants, is putting a great deal of what he 
knows about ants into a large book which, 
when published, will make a whole shelf- 
ful of green, red, blue, and yellow fairy 




books hide their faded colors in shame. 
For tellers of fairy tales cannot even think 
of things as extraordinary and strange as 
the things that ants actually do! 

But what a prosaic lecture this story of 
the animated honey-jars has come to be. 
Mary is long ago asleep, curled up in a big 
leather arm-chair in my study, and I sit 
here in the falling dusk, straining my be- 
spectacled eyes to write what will, I am 
afraid, only put other little girls to slcej). 
Which is not at all my idea in writing this 
book. It is, indeed, just the opposite. It 
is to make anybody who reads it open his 
eyes. But, ¡°Schluss,¡± as my old Leipzig 
professor used to say at the end of his long 
dreary lecture. So Schluss it is! 










There are eight different kinds of oak- 
trees growing on or near the campus 
where Mary and I live. And each kind of 
oak-tree has several kinds of houses pecu- 
liar and special to it. Which makes al- 
together a great many styles and sizes of 
houses of oak for Mary and me to get 
acquai>ited with. For we have made up 
our minds to know them all, and some- 
thing about the creatures that live in 
them. This is a large undertaking, we are 
finding, but an intensely intcre.sting and 
delightful one. Some of it is quite scien- 
tific, too, which makes us proud and ser- 
ious. We are keeping notes, as we did 
about Argiope and the way it handled flies 
and bees, and some day we shall print 





these notes in the proceedings of a learned 
society, and make a real sensation in the 
scientific world. Anyway we think we 
shall. Just now, however, we shall only 
tell the very simplest things about these 
houses of oak and their inhabitants, for 
we suppose you wouldn¡¯t be interested in 
the harder things; perhaps, indeed, not 
even understand them all. 

Although, as I have already said, there 
are eight different kinds of oak-trees growing 
in our valley and mountains, two of these 
kinds, the live-oaks and the white oaks, 
are by far the most common and numer- 
ous. As one stands upon the mountain 
tops or foothills and looks down and over 
the broad valley, all still and drowsy under 
the warm afternoon sun, it seems as if you 
were looking at a single great orchard with 
the trees in it in close-set regular lines and 
plots in some places, and irregularly scat- 
tered and farther apart in other places. 
Where they are regular and close together. 



they really are orchard trees; where they 
are irregular and widely spaced and larger, 
they are the beautiful live-oaks and white 
oaks that grow in all the grain-fields and 
meadows and pastures of our valley. The 
live-oaks ha\e small lea\es, dark green 
and close together, and the lioad of the tree 
is dense and like a great ball; the white 
oaks have larger, less thickly set leaves of 
lighter green, and the branches are more 
irregular and straying and tliey often send 
down delicate pendent lines that swing 
and dance in the wind like long tassels. 
The live-oaks have leaves on all the year 
through; the white oaks lose theirs in 
November. 

In both of these kinds of trees the oak 
houses can be found, but especially in the 
white oaks. And there are, as I have 
said, many kinds of the houses. Wary 
and I have found little round ones, big 
bean-shaped ones, little star-shaped ones, 
slender cornucopia-like ones, green, whit- 





ish, rcd-stripcd, pink-spotted, smooth, 
hairy, rough-coated, spiny ones, and still 
other kinds. Some of the houses arc on 
the leaves, some on the leaf-stems, some on 
the little twigs, and some on the branches. 
Some of the houses stay in the trees all 
through the year, but most of them drop 
off in the autumn, especially in the white- 
oak trees, just as the leaves do. 

Wc go out and hunt for the houses in 
the trees and among the fallen leaves on 
the ground under the trees. They are 
sometimes, especially the little ones, hard 
to find, for their colors and shapes often 
seem to fit in with their surroundings, so 
as to make them very hard to see. But 
others, like the big ball-shaped white ones 
shown in Sekko vShiinada¡¯s picture, are, on 
the contrary, very conspicuous. If the 
houses arc on the ground, or even if they 
arc still on the tree anti wc think they are 
all through being made ¡ª and there are 
various ways of knowing about this, but 





the most important is the time of year¡ª 
Mary and 1 bring them home with us and 
put them in little bags of line cloth netting, 
tarlatan usually, the houses that arc alike 
and from one place being put together in 
a single bag. Then we tie a string around 
the mouth of the bag and wait for the 
dwellers in the houses to come out. 

For one has to be careful about trying 
to see the oak-house dwellers before they 
are ready to come out. It is much better 
to await their own sweet pleasure in this 
matter, than to go digging or prying in, 
for the houses have no doors or windows 
until just at the time the dwellers come 
out! In fact they make the doors as they 
come out. You will sec, after we tell you 
a little more, that this arrangement is a 
very good one. Even as it is, various un- 
welcome intruders find their way into the 
house much to the annoyance and even to 
the fatal disaster of the inmates. 

So we wait until the dwellers are ready 





to come out. Or if occasionally we really 
think Wit oui^ht to see how things are go- 
ing on inside, we (dioj) a house or two open 
and see what w(^ can sec. What this is, 
usually, is a house¡¯s insides very unusual 
and curious, for th(^ rooms occupy so little 
space and the walls so much. vSometimes 
thc're is only one room and that right in 
the middle, all the rest of the house being 
just a dense or sometimes loose and s]X)ngy 
wall all around it. In the single room, or 
in each of the several rooms, we lind a 
curled-up little shining white grub with- 
out legs, and of course without wings, and 
with a head that doesn¡¯t seem much like 
a head, for it has no eyes nor feelers, and 
most of the time is drawn back into the 
body of the grub so that it is hardly visi- 
ble at all. l)Ut there is a mouth on this 
silly sort of head, and the grub cats. What 
it eats is part of its own house! 

The houses, or galls, as the entomologists 
call them, are of course not actually made 




by the insects that live in them; they arc 
made by the oak-tree on which they are. 
But they are only made at the demand, 
so to speak, of the insects. Tliat is, the 
oak-galls are formed only where a gall- 
insect has pricked a live leaf or stem or 
twig with her sharp, sting-like little egg- 
layer, and has left an egg in the plant-tis- 
sue. Nor does the gall begin to foi in even 
yet. It begins only after the young gall- 
insect is hatched from the egg, or at least 
begins to devcloj) inside the egg. Then 
the gall grows rapidly. The tree s(mu1s an 
extra supply of sap to this s])()t, and the 
plant-cells multijdy, and the liousc Ixigins 
to form around the little white grub. Now 
this house or gall not only encloses and 
protects the insect, but it j)rovides it with 
food in the form of {)lant-sap and a spcicial 
mass or layer of soft nutritious plant-tis- 
sue lying right around the grub. So the 
gall-insect not only lives in the house, but 
eats it! 




After it is full-grown, the grub stops eat- 
ing. Then the house, or gall, stops grow- 
ing and becomes harder and changes from 
greenish to some other color, and, in most 
cases, pretty soon drops off the tree to the 
ground. The gall-insect is still alive in- 
side, of course, but is perfectly quiet and 
is simply waiting. It is at this time in 
the life of the houses and their dwellers 
that Mary and I collect them and bring 
them home and put them into little tar- 
latan bags. This is autumn, the time that 
the trees in the East turn yellow and red, 
but in California do not. They just stay 
green, but get quiet or turn brown or sim- 
ply drop off tlieir leaves and stand bare. 

All through the autumn and winter the 
gall-insects do nothing inside their houses. 
Indeed we can take them out and keep 
them in little \'ials, and most of them get 
on very well. They require no food; they 
simply want to be let alone. But in early 
spring ¡ª and spring in California comes 




very early; indeed, it comes in winter! ¡ª 
they wake up and in a short time change 
into stout-bodied little real insect-looking 
insects with six legs, four wings, a round 
head with feelers and eyes and whatever 
else an insect¡¯s head ouglit to have. Es- 
pecially sharp jaws. For each gall-dweller 
has now to got out of its house. And as 
there arc no doors, it has to make them. 
Which it docs with its sharp jaws, gnaw- 
ing a tunnel from the center of the house 
right out through the thick hard wall to 
the outside. 

When it gets out it flies around in lively 
manner for a few days, finally settling on 
a sprouting oak-leaf or bud or green stem 
or twig, and laying a few eggs, or several, 
or many, according to the habits of its 
special kind, and then it dies. And when 
the tiny white grubs hatch from these eggs, 
new houses begin to be made around them 
by the oak-trees, and a new generation of 
gall-insects is fairly started. 



But not all the dwellers in the houses of 
oak have such a smooth and easy life as I 
have described. There will often come 
out of one of the galls that Mary and I 
have in a tarlatan bag, not one kind of in- 
sect, but several kinds, and only one of 
these kinds is the regular proper house- 
owner. 'I'lie others are interlopers. Some 
of them may be only uninvited but not 
esi^ceially harmful guests, just other kinds 
of gall-insects that seem to have given up 
the habit ¡ª if they e\cr had it ¡ª of starting 
houses of their own, and ha\ e adopted the 
cuckoo-like way of laying their eggs in the 
just-starting houses of other gall-insects. 
The grubs, or young of these messmate 
gall-insects, live in, and feed on, the same 
house, with the rightful dwellers, but as the 
oak-tree has plenty of sap and the gall- 
house is usually large enough for all, there 
is generally no harm done by these cuckoo 
intruders. 

But some of the intruding insects that 





come from our galls are not so harmless. 
They arc the ones called parasites. They 
live in the houses not for the sak(^ of tlie 
protection or the food furnished by the 
house, but in order to eat the actual 
dwellers in the house. Often and often 
not a single real gall-insect would come 
out in the spring from many of our col- 
lected houses, but only a little swarm, or 
sometimes just two or three or even one, 
of these insect-devouring jxuasites that 
has eaten up the rightful owners of the 
houses. 

There arc other enemies, too, of the oak- 
house dwellers. ]>irds like to })ec,k into the 
soft, growing galls to get at the tidbits in- 
side. And predaceous beetles and other 
strong-] awed insects with a fondness lor 
helpless, soft-bodied, juicy grubs would 
like to gnaw into the houses. So the 
houses have to protect the dwellers inside, 
and they do this in various ways. Some 
are extra thick-walled or have an extra- 





hard outer shell. Some are covered with 
spines or hairs. Some have a viscous gluey 
excretion, some have a very bad odor, 
some are so colored and patterned that 
they are very hard to distinguish from the 
foliage or from the fallen leaves around 
them, and, finally, some secrete a sweet- 
ish honey-dew which attracts ants, and 
these fierce visitors, who are content with 
the honey-dew, jirobably drive away many 
visiting parasites and predaceous insects. 

I Jut it would be tiresome to go on and 
tell you all the things we are finding out 
about the houses of oak and the insects 
that live in them. Of how we have got 
them to lay their eggs right before our 
eyes on little fresh branches that we bring 
into the house. Of how the houses begin 
to form under the bark or leaf surface as 
mere little swellings and then break through 
and get larger and larger and take on their 
characteristic form and color. Of how we 
have to study the gall-dwellers with a mi- 




croscope, for the largest that we have found 
yet ¡ª the ones that make the big galls 
shown in Sekko's picture ¡ª are only one- 
fifth of an inch long, while others are not 
more than one-twenty-fifth of an inch long. 
Of how some kinds have to lay their eggs 
always on the same kind of oak-tree, while 
others prick different kinds of oaks. 

Nor can we tell of the questions and 
problems that we are trying to answer. 
As why it is that two galls made by two 
different kinds of gall-insects, but in the 
same parts, as leaves, of the same oak- 
tree, should be so different, or why the 
galls in different kinds of trees, though 
made by the same kind of insect, should 
be alike, as they usually are. And why 
with some kinds of the house-dwellers the 
children grow up to be different from the 
mother, but their own children grow up 
like the grandmother, and different from 
themselves. Or how they know not to lay 
too many eggs in one place, the ones mak- 




ing little galls often laying several to many 
eggs in one leaf, but the ones making large 
galls being careful to lay only one egg 
in a leaf. And a lot of other things that 
they do that need explaining. 

Perhaps we shall find out the reason for 
some of these things. But naturalists have 
known the houses of oak-insects for two 
hundred years now, and if they haven¡¯t 
found the answers to some of these (jues- 
tions yet, perhaps no one ever can. But 
that isn¡¯t a good way to look at Nature. 
And so Mary and I don¡¯t. We think we 
may make a great discovery any day. We 
are like prospectors in the gold mountains. 
We never give up; we always keep prying 
and peering. The worst of it is, I suppose 
you think, that we always keep talking 
too. Well, this is the last sentence of this 
dose of talking; or next to last. For this 
is the

of this rambling, talky, little book. 










dear little friendswhen the ten polliwogs came to spend a day with me some two years ago i promised to tell you stories of how they and their neighbors live in the pond i wanted to tell the stories at once but this is a busy world and storytelling is only play so there were many things to be done before i could sit down to my desk and hold my pen while the stories slid out of it onto paper i wonder where all my ten polliwogs are now one cannot come to know pond people quite so well as those who live in the forest or in the meadow yet down in the shining water they live and build their homes and learn much that they need to know and wherever people are living and working and playing there are stories to be found the pond people cannot be well or happy long away from the water and you can only come to know them by watching the ponds and brooks if you do that and are very quiet the minnows will swim to where you are the mud turtles will waddle out on the logs in the sunshine and you may even see a crayfish walking backward along the sand but if you should see a very large black bug with fore legs which open and shut like jackknivesthen keep away from him for that is belostoma some time you may see him under the electric lights in the city for he likes to sprawl around there and you can look at him on land but let him alone remember that the dragonflies and many of their friends who seem to do nothing but play in the sunshine have lived long in the dusky pond and that this life in the air comes only after a long time of getting ready remember that if you pick up a turtle or catch minnows in a net you must not leave the turtle on his back or keep any waterbreathing people like the minnows in the air watch them for a little while and then let them go free and then remember be sure to remember this that you are not to get acquainted with the pond people by tumbling into the water or by going into it with your shoes and stockings on if you do that your mothers will say we wish that mrs pierson had never written about the pond people and if they should say that just think how i would feel the biggest frog stretched the four toes of his right forefoot then he stretched the four toes of his left forefoot next he stretched the five toes of his right hindfoot and last of all he stretched the four toes of his left hindfoot then he stretched all seventeen toes at once he should have had eighteen toes to stretch like his friends and neighbors but something had happened to the eighteenth one a great many years before none of the pond people knew what had happened to it but something had and when the tadpoles teased him to tell them what he only stared at them with his great eyes and said my children that story is too sad to tell after the biggest frog had stretched all his toes he stretched his legs and twitched his lips he poked his head out of the mud a very very little way and saw a minnow swimming past good day said he is it time to get up time exclaimed the minnow looking at him with her mouth open i should say it was why the watercress is growing now every one who lives in a pond knows that when the watercress begins to grow it is time for all the winter sleepers to awaken the biggest frog crawled out of the mud and poked this way and that all around the spot where he had spent the cold weather wake up he said wake up wake up the water grew dark and cloudy because he kicked up so much mud but when it began to clear again he saw the heads of his friends peeping up everywhere out of that part of the pond bottom seven of them had huddled close to him all winter come out he cried the spring is here and it is no time for frogs to be asleep asleep no indeed exclaimed his sister an elderly and hardworking frog as she swam to the shore and crawled out on it she ate every bit of food that she found on the way for neither she nor any of the others had taken a mouthful since the fall before the younger frogs followed through the warmer shallow water until they were partly out of it there is always a biggest frog in every pond all the young frogs thought how fine it would be to become the biggest frog of even a very small puddle for then they could tell the others what to do now they looked at their leader and each said to himself perhaps some day i shall begin the concert the biggest frog found a comfortable place and sat down he toed in with his eight front toes as wellbred frogs do and all his friends toed in with their eight front toes he toed out with his nine back toes and all his friends toed out with their ten back toes one young yellow brown frog said how i wish i did not have that bothersome fifth toe on my left hindfoot it is so in the way besides there is such a style about having ones hind feet different he spoke just loud enough for the biggest frog to hear any one would know from this remark that he was young and foolish for when people are wise they know that the most beautiful feet and ears and bodies are just the way that they were first made to be now the biggest frog swallowed a great deal of air filled the sacs on each side of his neck with it opened his big mouth and sang croakily frogs frogs frogs frogs frogs frogs frogs frogs and all the others sang frogs frogs frogs as long as he the gulls heard it and the muskrats heard it and all were happy because spring had come a beautiful young green brown frog who had never felt grownup until now tried to sing with the others but she had not a strong voice and was glad enough to stop and visit with the biggest frogs sister dont you wish we could sing as loudly as they can said she no answered the biggest frogs sister i would rather sit on the bank and think about my spring work work first you know and pleasure afterward oh said the green brown frog then you dont want to sing until your work is done you may be very sure i dont want to sing then answered the older frog i am too tired besides after the eggs are laid there is no reason for wanting to sing why not asked the green brown frog i dont see what difference that makes that said the older frog wisely is because you are young and have never laid eggs the great time for singing is before the eggs are laid there is some singing afterward but that is only because people expect it of us and not because we have the same wish to sing after she had said all this which was a great deal for a frog to say at once she shut her big mouth and slid her eyelids over her eyes there was another question which the green brown frog wanted very much to ask but she had good manners and knew that it was impolite to speak to any frog whose eyes were not open so she closed her own eyes and tried to think what the answer would be when she opened them again the biggest frogs sister had hopped away and in her place sat the yellow brown frog the same handsome young fellow who had found one of his toes in the way it quite startled her to find him sitting so close to her and she couldnt think of anything to say so she just looked at him with her great beautiful eyes and toed in a little more with her front feet that made him look at them and see how pretty they were although of course this was not the reason why she had moved them the yellow brown frog hopped a little nearer and sang as loudly as he could frogs frogs frogs frogs frogs frogs frogs frogs then she knew that he was singing just for her and she was exceedingly happy she swallowed air very fast because she seemed to be out of breath from thinking what she should answer she had wanted to ask the biggest frogs sister what she should say if any one sang to her alone she knew that if she wanted to get away from him all she had to do was to give a great jump and splash into the water she didnt want to go away yet she made believe that she did for she hopped a little farther from him he knew she was only pretending though for she hadnt hopped more than the length of a grassblade so he followed her and kept on singing because she knew that she must say something she just opened her mouth and sang the first words that she could think of and what she sang was eggs eggs eggs eggs eggs eggs eggs eggs as it happened this was exactly what she should have sung so he knew that she liked him they stayed together for a long long time and he sang a great deal and very loudly and she sang a little and very softly after a while she remembered that she was now a fully grown frog and had spring work to do and she said to him i really must lay some eggs i am going into the water then i will go too said he and they gave two great leaps and came down with two great splashes the green brown frog laid eggs for four days and the yellow brown frog stayed with her all that time and took care of the eggs after she had laid them they were covered with a sort of green jelly which made them stick to each other as they floated in little heaps on the water the frogs thought that a good thing for then when the tadpoles hatched each would have playmates near one day after the eggs were all laid and were growing finely for frogs eggs grow until the tadpoles are ready to eat their way out the green brown frog sat alone on the bank of the pond and the biggest frogs sister came to her she had a queer smile around the corners of her mouth frogs have excellent mouths for smiling but it takes a very broad smile to go way across so when they smile a little it is only at the corners how are your eggs growing she asked oh answered the green brown frog sadly i cant tell which ones they are thats just like a young frog said the biggest frogs sister is there any reason why you should know which ones they are it isnt as though you were a bird and had to keep them warm or as though you were a mink and had to feed your children the sun will hatch them and they will feed themselves all they need i think said the green brown frog that my eggs
 were a little better than the rest yes croaked the biggest frogs sister every frog thinks that and i wanted to have my own tadpoles to look after sighed the green brown frog why asked the biggest frogs sister cant you take any comfort with a tadpole unless you laid the egg from which he was hatched i never know one of my own eggs a day after it is laid there are such a lot floating around that they are sure to get mixed but i just make the best of it how asked the green brown frog looking a little more cheerful oh i swim around and look at all the eggs and whenever i see any tadpoles moving in them i think those may be mine as they are hatched i help any one who needs it poor sort of frog it would be who couldnt like other peoples tadpoles i believe ill do that way said the green brown frog and then she added what a comfort it will be if any of them are cross or rude to think im glad i dont know that they are mine yes said the biggest frogs sister i often tell my brother that i pity people who have to bring up their own children it is much pleasanter to let them grow up as they do and then adopt the best ones do you know i have almost decided that you are my daughter my brother said this morning that he thought you looked like me one fine day in spring a great flock of sandhill cranes came from the south they were flying high and quietly because the weather was bright if it had been stormy or if they had been flying by night as they usually did they would have stayed nearer the ground and their leader would have trumpeted loudly to let his followers know which way he was going they would also have trumpeted but more softly to tell him that they were coming after they were a fine company to look upon orderly strong and dignified their long necks were stretched out straight ahead their long legs straight behind and they beat the air with slow regular strokes of the strong wings as they came near the pond they flew lower and lower until all swept down to the earth and alighted tall and stately by the edge of the water they had eaten nothing for several days and were soon hunting for food some on land and some in the water for they had stopped to feed and rest those who hunted in the water did so very quietly a crane would stand on one leg with his head against his breast so quietly that one might think him asleep but as soon as anything eatable came near he would bend his body stretch out his neck open his long slender bill and swallow it at one gulp then he would seem to fall asleep again while most of the cranes were still feeding some of them were stalking through the woods and looking this way and that flying up to stand on a tree and then flying down to stand on the ground they were those who thought of staying there for the summer when the flock arose to fly on again eight cranes stayed behind they watched their friends fly away and stood on the ground with their necks and bills uplifted and mouths open while they trumpeted or called out goodbye stop for us in the fall the flying cranes trumpeted back we will dont forget us that night they slept near together as they had done when with the large flock and one crane kept awake to watch for danger while the others tucked their heads under their wings they were fine looking even when they slept and some people never look well unless they are awake they were brownishgray with no bright markings at all and their long legs gave them a very genteel look the tops of their heads were covered with warty red skin from which grew short black feathers that looked more like hairs one morning when the cranes awakened a fine young fellow began to strut up and down before the rest bowing low and leaping high into the air and every now and then whooping as loudly as he could the gulls who had spent the winter by the pond screamed to each other the crane dance has begun even the frogs who are afraid of cranes crept quietly near to look on it was not long before another young crane began to skip and hop and circle around drooping his wings and whooping as he went every crane danced brothers and sisters and all and as they did so they looked lovingly at each other and admired the fine steps and enjoyed the whooping this went on until they were so tired they could hardly stand and had to stop to eat and rest when they were eating the young fellow who had begun the dance stalked up to the sister of one of his friends as she stood in the edge of the pond gracefully balanced on one leg she did not turn her head towards him although having such a long and slender neck she could have done so with very little trouble she stood with her head on her breast and looked at the water after a while he trumpeted softly as though he were just trying his voice then she gave a pretty little start and said oh are you here how you did frighten me i am sorry he said i did not want to frighten you and he looked at her admiringly it was just for a minute she answered of course i am not frightened now that i know who it is then they stood and fished for a long time without saying anything when she flew away she said that is a very pleasant fishingplace he stood on the other leg for a while and thought how sweet her voice sounded as she said it then he thought that if she liked the place so well she might come there again the next day he wondered why he could not come too although everybody knows that a crane catches more if he fishes alone the next morning when the cranes danced he bowed to her oftener than to any of the rest and he thought she noticed it they danced until they were almost too tired to move and indeed he had to rest for a while before he went to feed as she stalked off toward the pond she passed him and she said over her shoulder i should think you would be hungry i am almost starved after she had gone he wondered why she had said that if he had been an older crane and understood the ways of the world a little better he would have known that she meant arent you coming to that fishingplace i am going now still although he was such a young crane and had never danced until this year he began to think that she liked him and enjoyed having him near so he flew off to the fishingplace where he had seen her the day before and he stalked along to where she was and stood close to her while she fished once when he caught something and swallowed it at one gulp she looked admiringly at him and said what fine big mouthfuls you can take that pleased him of course because cranes think that big mouthfuls are the best kind so he tipped his head to one side and watched his neck as the mouthful slid down to his stomach he could see it from the outside a big bunch slowly moving downward he often did this while he was eating he thought it very interesting he pitied shortnecked people then he said pooh i can take bigger mouthfuls than that you ought to see what big mouthfuls i can take she changed and stood on her other leg i saw you dancing this morning she said now it was not at all queer that she should have seen him dancing for all the eight cranes had danced together but he thought it very wonderful did you notice to whom i bowed he asked he was so excited that his knees shook and he had to stand on both legs at once to keep from falling when a crane is as much excited as that it is pretty serious to my sister she asked carelessly as she drew one of her long tailfeathers through her beak no said he i bowed to her sister he thought that was a very clever thing to say but she suddenly raised her head and said there i have forgotten something and flew off as she had done the day before he wondered what it was long afterward he asked her what she had forgotten and she said she couldnt rememberthat she never could remember what she had forgotten it made him feel very badly to have her leave him so he wanted a chance to tell her something yet whenever he tried to it seemed to stick in his bill he began to fear that she didnt like him and the next time the cranes danced he didnt bow to her so much but he strutted and leaped and whooped even more and she strutted and leaped and whooped almost as loudly as he when they were all tired out and had stopped dancing she said to him i am so tired let us go off into the woods and rest you may be very sure he was glad to go and as he stalked off with her he led the way to a charming nestingplace he didnt know just how to tell what he wanted to but he had seen another crane bowing to her and was afraid she might marry him if he was not quick now he pointed with one wing to this nestingplace and said how would you like to build a nest there she looked where he had pointed i she said why it is a lovely place but i could never have a nest alone let me help you he said i want to marry and have a home why said she as she preened her feathers that is a very good plan when did you think of it so they were married and mrs sandhill crane often told her friends afterward that mr crane was so much in love with her that she just had to marry him they were very very happy and after a whilebut that is another story when i grow up said one young minnow i am going to be a bullhead and scare all the little fishes im not said his sister im going to be a sucker and lie around in the mud lazy lazy cried the other young minnows wiggling their front fins at her what is the matter asked a father minnow swimming in among them with a few graceful sweeps of his tail and stopping himself by spreading his front fins he had the beautiful scarlet coloring on the under part of his body which father minnows wear in the summertime that is most of them do but some wear purple what is the matter he asked again balancing himself with his top fin and his two hind ones then all the little minnows spoke at once he says that when he grows up he is going to be a bullhead and frighten all the small fishes and she
 says that she is going to be a sucker and lie around in the mud and we say that suckers are lazy and they are lazy arent they i am surprised at you began the father minnow severely to think that you should talk such nonsense you ought to know but just then a mother minnow swam up to him the snapping turtle is looking for you she said father minnow hurried away and she turned to the little ones i heard what you were saying she remarked with a twinkle in her flat round eyes which of you is going to be a wild duck wont somebody be a frog she had had more experience in bringing up children than father minnow and she didnt scold so much she did make fun of them though sometimes and you can do almost anything with a young minnow if you love him a great deal and make fun of him a little whyee said the young minnows we wouldnt think of being wild ducks and we couldnt be frogs you know frogs have legsfour of them a fish couldnt be a frog if he wanted to no said mother minnow a fish cannot be anything but a fish and a minnow cannot be anything but a minnow so if you will try to be just as good minnows as you can we will let the little bullheads and suckers do their own growing up she looked at them all again with her flat round eyes which saw so much and were always open because there was nothing to make them shut she saw one tiny fellow hiding behind his brother have you torn your fin again she asked yesm just a little said he a boy caught me when he was in wading and i tore it when i flopped away from him dreadful said she how you do look if you are so careless you will soon not have a whole fin to your backor your front either children you must remember to swim away from boys when the cows wade in to drink you may stay among them if you wish they are friendly we pond people are afraid of boys although some of them are said not to be dangerous pooh said one young minnow all the pond people are not so afraid the bloodsuckers say they like them the mother minnow looked very severe when he said this but she only replied very well when you are a bloodsucker you may stay near boys as long as you are a minnow you must stay away now she added swim along the whole school of you i am tired and want a nap in the pondweed so they all swam away and she wriggled her silvery brown body into the soft green weeds and had a good sleep she was careful to hide herself for there were some people in the pond whom she did not want to have find her and being a fish she could not hear very distinctly if they came near of course her eyes were open even when she was asleep because she had no eyelids but they were not working although they were open that is an uncomfortable thing about being a fishone cannot hear much one cannot taste much either or feel much yet when one has always been a fish and is used to it it is not so hard she slept a long time and then the whole school of young minnows came to look for her we are afraid they cried we feel so very queerly we dont know how we feel either and that is the worst part of it it might be in our stomachs or it might be in our fins and perhaps there is something wrong with our gillcovers wake up and tell us what is the matter the mother minnow awakened and she felt queerly too but being older she knew what was the matter that she said is the storm feeling but said the young minnows there isnt any storm no she answered wisely not now and there hasnt been any they said no she answered again the storm you feel is the storm that is going to be and shall we always feel it so they asked always before a storm she said why asked the young minnows because said she there is no answer to that question but just because when the storm comes you cannot smell your food and find it so you must eat all you can before then eat everything you can find and be quick as she spoke she took a great mouthful of pondweed and swallowed it all but one of the young minnows swam quickly away to do as she had told them to this young minnow wanted to know just how and why and all about it so he stayed to ask questions you know there are some questions which fishes cannot answer and some which oxen cannot answer and some which nobody can answer and when the mother minnow told the young minnows what she did she had nothing more to tell but there are some young minnows who never will be satisfied and who tease and tease and tease and tease hurry along and eat all you can said the mother minnow to him again i want to know said he opening his mouth very wide indeed and breathing in a great deal of water as he spoke i want to know where i feel queerly i cant tell said the mother minnow between mouthfuls no fish can tell well what makes me feel queerly there the storm said she how does it make me feel queerly i dont know said the mother minnow who does know asked the young minnow nobody said she swallowing some more pondweed of one kind and then beginning on another do eat something or you will be very hungry by and by well why does a storm make me feel so asked he because said she she said it very firmly and she was quite right in saying it then for there was a cause yet she could not tell what it was there are only about seven times in ones life when it is right to answer in this way and what the other six are you must decide for yourself just then there was a peal of thunder which even a minnow could hear and the wind blew until the slender forest trees bent far over the rain came down in great drops which pattered on the water of the pond and started tiny circles around each drop every circle spreading wider and wider until it touched other circles and broke down in the darkened water the fishes lay together on the bottom and wondered how long it would last and hoped it would not be a great great while before they could smell their food again one little fellow was more impatient than the others didnt you eat enough to last you they said i didnt eat anything he answered not anything they exclaimed why not because said he and that was not right for he did know the reason his mother looked at him and he looked at her and she had a twinkle in her round flat eyes poor child she thought he must be hungry but she said nothing nobody can truthfully say that the sticklebacks are not good fathers there are no other fish fathers who work so hard for their children as the sticklebacks do as to the stickleback motherswell that is different this particular stickleback father had lived ever since he had left the nest with a little company of his friends in a quiet place near the edge of the pond sometimes when they tired of staying quietly at home they had made short journeys up a brook that emptied into the pond it was a brook that flowed gently over an even bed else they would never have gone there for sticklebacks like quiet waters when they swam in this little stream they met the brook trout who were much larger than they and who were the most important people there now this stickleback was a year old and knew much more than he did the summer before when the alder tassels and pussy willows hung over the edge of the pond in the springtime he began to think seriously of life he was no longer really young and the days were past in which he was contented to just swim and eat and sleep it was time he should build a home and raise a family if he wanted to ever be a grandfather he had a few relatives who were greatgrandfathers and one who was a greatgreatgrandfather that does not often happen because to be a stickleback greatgreatgrandfather one must be four years old and few sticklebacks live to that age as he began to think about these things he left the company of his friends and went to live by himself he chose a place near the edge of the pond to be his home and he brushed the pondbottom there with his tail until he had swept away all the loose sticks and broken shells he told some pond snails who were there that they must move away because he wanted the place at first they didnt want to go but when they saw how fierce he looked they thought about it again and decided that perhaps there were other places which would suit them quite as wellindeed they might find one that they liked even better besides as one of them said to his brother they had to remember that in ponds it is always right for the weak people to give up to the strong people it will take us quite a while to move they said to him for you know we cannot hurry but we will begin at once all the rest of that day each snail was lengthening and shortening his one foot which was his only way of walking you can see how slow that must be for a snail cannot lift his foot from one place and put it down in another or he would have nothing to stand on while he was lifting it this was a very hard day for them yet they were cheerful and made the best of it well said one as he stopped to rest his foot im glad we dont have to build a home when we do find the right place how i pity people who have to do that yes said his brother there are not many so sure of their homes as we and what people want of so much room i cant understand a muskrat told me he wanted room to turn around in his house i dont see what use there is in turning round do you no answered the other snail beginning to walk again it is just one of his silly ideas my shell is big enough to let me draw in my whole body and that is house room enough for any person the stickleback had not meant to look fierce at the pond snails he had done so because he couldnt help it all his fins were bristling with sharp points of bone and he had extra bonepoints sticking out of his back besides wearing a great many of his flat bones on the outside all his family had these extra bones and that was why they were called sticklebacks they were a brave family and not afraid of many things although they were so small there came a time when the stickleback father
 wanted to look fierce but that was later now he went to work to build his nest first he made a little hollow in the pondbottom and lined it with watergrass and tiny pieces of roots next he made the sidewalls of the same things and last of all the roof when it was done he swam carefully into it and looked around under and beside and over him were soft grasses and roots at each end was an open doorway it is a good nest he said a very good nest for my first one now i must ask some of my friends to lay eggs in it for me before doing this he went to look at the homes built by his neighbors after he left the company in the quiet pool many others did the same until the only sticklebacks left there were the dullcolored ones the egglayers the nestbuilders had been dullcolored too but in the springtime there came beautiful red and blue markings on their bodies until now they were very handsome fellows it is sad to tell still it is true that they also became very cross at this time perhaps it was the work and worry of nestbuilding that made them so yet whatever it was every brightcolored stickleback wanted to fight every other brightcolored stickleback that was how it happened that when this one went to look at the nest of an old friend with whom he had played ever since he was hatched this same friend called out dont you come near my nest the visiting stickleback replied i shall if i want to then they swam at each other and flopped and splashed and pushed and jabbed until both were very tired and sore and each was glad to stay by his own home this was the time when they wanted to look fierce  soon the dullcolored sticklebacks came swimming past waving their tails gracefully and talking to each other now this fine fellow who had sent the snails away and built his nest who had fought his old friend and come home again swam up to a dullcolored stickleback and said wont you lay a few eggs in my nest im sure you will find it comfortable she answered why yes i wouldnt mind laying a few there and she tried to look as though she had not expected the invitation while she was carefully laying the eggs in the nest he stood ready to fight anybody who disturbed her she came out after a while and swam away before she went she said arent you ashamed to fight so we dullcolored ones never fight she held her fins very stiff as she spoke because she thought it her duty to scold him the dullcolored sticklebacks often did this they thought that they were a little better than the others so they swam around together and talked about things and sometimes forgot how hard it was to be the nestbuilder and stay at home and work then they called upon the brightcolored sticklebacks for they really liked them very much and told them what they should do that was why this one said we dullcolored ones never fight have you ever been red and blue asked the nestbuilder nno said she but i dont see what difference that makes well it does make a difference said he when a fellow is red and blue he cant help fighting ill be as goodnatured as any of you after i stop being red and blue of course she could not say anything more after that so she swam off to her sisters the brightcolored stickleback looked at the eggs she had laid they were sticky like the eggs of all fishes so that they stuck to the bottom of the nest he covered them carefully and after that he was really a stickleback father it is true that he did not have any stickleback children to swim around him and open their dear little mouths at him but he knew that the eggs would hatch soon and that after he had built a nest and covered the eggs in it the tiny sticklebacks were beginning to grow however he wanted more eggs in his nest so he watched for another dullcolored stickleback and called her in to help him he did this until he had almost an hundred eggs there and all this time he had fought every brightcolored stickleback who came near him he became very tired indeed but he had to fight you know because he was red and blue and he had covered all the eggs and guarded them else they would never have hatched the dullcolored sticklebacks were also tired they had been swimming from nest to nest laying a few eggs in each now they went off together to a quiet pool and ate everything they could find to eat and visited with each other and said it was a shame that the brightcolored sticklebacks had fought so and told how they thought little sticklebacks should be brought up and now the red and blue markings on the stickleback father grew paler and paler until he did not have to fight at all and could call upon his friends and see how their children were hatching one fine day his first child broke the shell and then another and another until he had an hundred beautiful stickleback babies to feed he worked hard for them and some nights when he could stop and rest his fins ached as though they would drop off but they never did as the stickleback children grew stronger they swam off to take care of themselves and he had less to do when the last had gone he left the old nest and went to the pool where the dullcolored sticklebacks were they told him he was not looking well and that he hadnt managed the children right and that they thought he tried to do too much he was too tired to talk about it so he just said perhaps and began to eat something yet down in his fatherly heart he knew it was worth doing he knew too that when spring should come once more he would become red and blue again and build another nest and fight and work and love as he had done before there is nothing in the world better than working for ones own little sticklebacks said he when the caddis fly felt like laying eggs she crawled down the stalk of one of the pond plants and laid them there she covered them with something sticky so that they were sure to stay where she put them there she said as she crawled up to the air again my work is done soon after this she lay down for a long long rest what with flying and visiting and laying eggs she had become very tired and it was not strange for she had not eaten a mouthful since she got her wings this had puzzled the dragonflies very much they could not understand it because they were always eating they would have liked to ask her about it but they went to sleep for the night soon after she got up and whenever she saw them coming she flew away i do not seem to feel hungry said she so why should i eat besides she added i couldnt eat if i wanted to my mouth is so small and weak i ate a great deal while i was growingquite enough to last meand it saves time not to bother with hunting food now when her eggs hatched the larvæ were slender soft sixfooted babies called caddis worms they were white and they showed as plainly in the water as a pondlily does on the top of it it is not safe to be white if one is to live in the water certainly not unless one can swim fast and turn quickly and there is a reason for this as any one of the pond people will tell you even the fishes wear all their white on the under side of their bodies so that if they swim near the top of the water a hungry fish hawk is not so likely to see them and pounce down on them the caddis worms soon found that white was not a good color to wear and they talked of it among themselves they were very bright larvæ one day the biggest one was standing on a stem of pickerelweed when his sister came toward him she did not come very fast because she was neither swimming nor walking but biting herself along all the caddis worms did this at times for their legs were weak she reached as far forward as she could and fastened her strong jaws in the weed then she gave a jerk and pulled her body ahead it is a very good way to travel said she and such a saving of ones legs now she was in so great a hurry that sometimes when she pulled herself ahead she turned a halfsomersault and came down on her back what is the matter called the biggest caddis worm dont hurry so there is lots of time that was just him for he was lazy everybody said so i must hurry said she and she breathed very fast with the white breathing hairs that grew on both sides of her body she picked herself up from her last somersault and stood beside her brother near enough to speak quite softly i have been getting away from belostoma she said and i was dreadfully afraid he would catch me well youre all right now arent you asked her brother and that was also like him as long as he could have enough to eat and was comfortable he did not want to think about anything unpleasant no im not she answered and i wont be so long as any hungry fish or waterbug can see me so plainly im tired of being white you are not so white as you were said her brother none of us children are our heads and the front part of our bodies are turning brown and getting harder that was true and he was particularly hardheaded yes but what about the rest of us said she and surely there was some excuse for her if she was impatient if belostoma can see part of me and chase that he will find the rest of me rather near by keep quiet then and see if you dont get hard and brown all over said he i never shall said she i went to the clams and asked them if i would and they said no im going to build a house to cover the back part of my body and youd better do the same thing the biggest caddis worm looked very much surprised whatever made you think of that said he i suppose because there wasnt anything else to think of said she one has to think of something i dont said he she started away to where her other brothers and sisters were where are you going cried he going to build my house answered she youd better come too not now said he i am waiting to get the rest of my breakfast ill come by and by the biggest caddis worm stood on the pickerelweed and ate his breakfast then he stood there a while longer i do not think it is well to work right
 after eating he said below him in the water his brothers and sisters were busily gathering tiny sticks stones and bits of broken shell with which to make their houses each caddis worm found his own and fastened them together with a sort of silk which he pulled out of his body they had nobody to show them how so each planned to suit himself and no two were exactly alike im going to make my house big enough so i can pull in my head and legs when i want to said one so am i cried all the other caddis worms after a while somebody said im going to have an open door at the back of my house then each of his busy brothers and sisters cried so am i when the tiny houses were done each caddis worm crawled inside of his own and lay with head and legs outside the front door the white part of their bodies did not show at all and if they wanted to do so they could pull their heads in even belostoma the giant waterbug might have passed close to them then and not seen them at all lets hook ourselves in cried one caddis worm and all the others answered lets so each hooked himself in with the two stout hooks which grew at the end of his body and there they were as snug and comfortable as clams about this time the big brother came slowly along the stem of pickerelweed what said he you havent got your houses done already yes answered the rest joyfully see us pull in our heads and they all pulled in their heads and poked them out again he was the only whitebodied person in sight i must have a home said he i wish one of you worms would give me yours you could make yourself another you know there is lots more stuff make it yourself they replied help yourself to stuff but i dont know how he said and you do whose fault is that asked his sister then she was afraid that he might think her cross and she added quickly well tell you how if youll begin the biggest caddis worm got together some tiny sticks and stones and pieces of broken shell but it wasnt very much fun working alone then they told him what to do and how to fasten them to each other with silk be sure you tie them strongly they said oh thats strong enough he answered itll do anyhow if it comes to pieces i can fix it his brothers and sisters thought he should make it stouter yet they said nothing more for he would not have liked it if they had and they had already said so once when he crawled into his house and hooked himself in there was not a caddis worm in sight and they were very proud to think how they had planned and built their houses they did not know that caddis worms had always done so and they thought themselves the first to ever think of such a thing the biggest caddis worms house was not well fastened together and every day he said i really must fix it tomorrow but when tomorrow came it always proved to be today and besides he usually found something more interesting to be done it took him a great deal of time to change his skin and that could not be easily put off he grew so fast that he was likely to awaken almost any morning and find his head poking through the top of his skin and lazy as he was he would not have the pond people see him around with a crack in the skin of his head right where it showed so when this happened he always pulled his body through the crack and threw the old skin away there was sure to be a whole new one underneath you know when they had changed their skin many times the caddis worms became more quiet and thoughtful at last the sister who had first planned to build houses fastened hers to a stone and spun gratings across both its front and its back doors i am going to sleep she said to grow my feelers and get ready to fly and breathe air i dont want anybody to awaken me all i want to do is to sleep and grow and breathe the water will come in through the gratings so i shall be all right i couldnt sleep in a house where there was not plenty of fresh water to breathe then she cuddled down and dozed off and when her brothers and sisters spoke of her they called her the caddis nymph they did not speak of her many times however for they soon fastened their houses to something solid and spun gratings in their doorways and went to sleep one day a wateradder came around where all the caddis houses were umhum said he to himself there used to be a nice lot of caddis worms around here and now i havent seen one in ever so long i suppose they are hidden away somewhere asleep well i must go away from here and find my dinner i am nearly starved the front half of my stomach hasnt a thing in it he whisked his tail and went away but that whisk hit a tiny house of sticks stones and bits of broken shell and a fat sleeping caddis nymph rolled out it was the biggest brother soon belostoma the giant waterbug came that way what is this he exclaimed as he saw the sleeping caddis nymph somebody built a poor house to sleep in you need to be cared for young caddis he picked up the sleeping caddis nymph in his stout forelegs and swam off nobody knows just what happened after that when the other caddis nymphs awakened they bit through their gratings and had a good visit before they crawled out of the pond into their new home the air has anybody seen my biggest brother asked one nymph of another but everybody answered no each looked all around with his two farapart eyes and then they decided that he must have awakened first and left the water before them but you know that he could not have done so because he could never be a caddis fly unless he finished the nymphsleep in his house and he did not do that he had stopped being a caddis worm when he turned into a caddis nymph nobody will ever know just what did become of him unless belostoma tellsand belostoma is not likely to tell it was a bright warm april day when the first tadpole of the season ate his way out of the jellycovered egg in which he had come to life he was a very tiny dark brown fellow it would be hard to tell just what he did look like for there is nothing in the world that one tadpole looks like unless it is another tadpole he had a very small head with a busy little mouth opening on the front side of it just above each end of this mouth was a shining black eye and on the lower side of his head was a very wiggly tail somewhere between his head and the tip of this were his small stomach and places for legs but one could not see all that in looking at him it seemed as if what was not head was tail and what was not tail was head when the first tadpole found himself free in the water he swam along by the great green floating jellymass of frogs eggs and pressed his face up close to first one egg and then another he saw other tadpoles almost as large as he and they were wriggling inside their egg homes he couldnt talk to them through the jellymasshe could only look at them and they looked greenish because he saw them through green jelly they were really dark brown like him he wanted them to come out to play with him and he tried to show them that it was more interesting where he was so he opened and shut his hard little jaws very fast and took big tadpolemouthfuls of green jelly perhaps it was seeing this and perhaps it was because the warm sunshine made them restlessbut for some reason the shutin tadpoles nibbled busily at the eggcovering and before long were in the water with their brother they all looked alike and nobody except that one particular tadpole knew who had been the first to hatch he never forgot it and indeed why should he if one has ever been the first tadpole he is quite sure to remember the loneliness of it all his life soon they dropped to the bottom of the pond and met their neighbors they were such little fellows that nobody paid much attention to them the older pond people often seemed to forget that the tadpoles heard what they said and cared too the minnows swam in and out among them and hit them with their fins and slapped them with their tails and called them littlebigmouths and the tadpoles couldnt hit back because they were so little the minnows didnt hurt the tadpoles but they made fun of them and even the smallest minnow would swim away if a tadpole tried to play with him then the eels talked among themselves about them i shall be glad said one old father eel when these youngsters hide their breathinggills and go to the top of the water so shall i exclaimed a mother eel they keep their tails wiggling so that it hurts my eyes to look at them why cant they lie still and be good now the tadpoles looked at each other with their shining black eyes what are our breathinggills they asked they must be these little things on the sides of our heads they are cried the first tadpole the biggest frog said so but i dont see where we can hide them because they wont come off and how could we ever breathe water without them hear the children talk exclaimed the green brown frog who had come down to look the tadpoles over and decide which were hers why you wont always want to breathe water before long you will have to breathe air by swallowing it and then you cannot stay long under water i must go now i am quite out of breath goodbye then the tadpoles looked again at each other she didnt tell us what to do with our breathinggills they said one of the tadpoles who had hatched last swam up to the first tadpole your breathinggills are not so large as mine she said they surely are he exclaimed for he felt very big indeed having been the first to hatch oh but they are not cried all his friends they dont stick out as they used to and that was true for his breathinggills were sinking into his head and they found that this was happening to all the older tadpoles the next day they began going to the top to breathe air the oldest ones first and so on until they were all there they thought it much pleasanter than the bottom of the pond but it was not so safe there were more dangers to be watched for here and some
 of the careless young tadpoles never lived to be frogs it is sad yet it is always so sometimes the frogs came to see them and onceonce after the tadpoles had gotten their hindlegs the biggest frog sat in the marsh near by and told them stories of his tadpolehood he said that he was always a very good little tadpole and always did as the frogs told him to do and that he was such a promising little fellow that every mother frog in the pond was sure that he had been hatched from one of her eggs and were you asked one tadpole who never listened carefully and so was always asking stupid questions the biggest frog looked at him very sternly no said he i was not each wanted me as her son but i never knew to which i belonged i never knew still he added it does not so much matter who a frogs mother is if the frog is truly great then he filled the sacs on each side of his neck with air and croaked loudly his sister afterward told the tadpoles that he was thinking of one of the forest people the ground hog who was very proud because he could remember his grandfather the green brown frog came often to look at them and see how they were growing she was very fond of the first tadpole why you have your forelegs she exclaimed one morning how you do grow what will i have next he asked more legs or another tail the green brown frog smiled the whole length of her mouth and that was a very broad smile indeed look at me she said what change must come next to make you look like a frog you havent any tail he said slowly is that all the difference between us tadpoles and frogs that is all the difference now she answered but it will take a long long time for your tail to disappear it will happen with that quite as it did with your breathinggills you will grow bigger and bigger and bigger and it will grow smaller and smaller and smaller until some day you will find yourself a frog she shut her mouth to get her breath because you know frogs can only breathe a little through their skins and then only when they are wet most of their air they take in through their noses and swallow with their mouths closed that is why they cannot make long speeches when their mouths are open they cannot swallow air after a while she spoke again it takes as many years to make a newly hatched tadpole into a fully grown frog she said as there are toes on one of your hindfeet the first tadpole did not know what a year was but he felt sure from the way in which she spoke that it was a long long time and he was in a hurry to grow up i want to be a frog sooner he said crossly it isnt any fun at all being a tadpole the green brown frog swam away he was becoming so disagreeable the first tadpole became crosser and crosser and was very unreasonable he did not think of the pleasant things which happened every day but only of the trying ones he did not know that frogs often wished themselves tadpoles again and he sulked around in the pondweed all day every time he looked at one of his hindfeet it reminded him of what the green brown frog had said and he even grew out of patience with his tailthe same strong wiggly little tail of which he had been so proud horrid old thing he said giving it a jerk wont i be glad to get rid of you then he thought of somethingfoolish vain little first tadpole that he was he thought and he thought and he thought and he thought and when his playmates swam around him he wouldnt chase them and when they asked him what was the matter he just answered oh nothing as carelessly as could be the truth was that he wanted to be a frog right away and he thought he knew how he could be he didnt want to tell the other tadpoles because he didnt want any one else to become a frog as soon as he after a while he swam off to see the snapping turtle he was very much afraid of the snapping turtle and yet he thought him the best one to see just now i came to see if you would snap off my tail said he your what said the snapping turtle in his most surprised way my tail answered the first tadpole who had never had a tail snapped off and thought it could be easily done i want to be a frog today and not wait certainly said the snapping turtle with pleasure no trouble at all anything else i can do for you no thank you said the first tadpole only you wont snap off too much will you not a bit answered the snapping turtle with a queer look in his eyes and if any of your friends are in a hurry to grow up i shall be glad to help them then he swam toward the first tadpole and did as he had been asked to do the next morning all the other tadpoles crowded around to look at the first tadpole whyee they cried where is your tail i dont know he answered but i think the snapping turtle could tell you what is this asked the green brown frog swimming up to them did the snapping turtle try to catch you you poor little fellow how did it happen she was very fond of the first tadpole and had about decided that he must be one of her sons well he said slowly for he didnt want the other tadpoles to do the same thing i met him last evening and he snapped at you exclaimed the green brown frog it is lucky for you that he doesnt believe in eating hearty suppers that is all i have to say but you are a very foolish tadpole not to keep out of his way as you have always been told you must then the first tadpole lost his temper im not foolish and im not a tadpole he said i asked him to snap it off and now i am a frog oho said the voice of the yellow brown frog behind him you are a frog are you lets hear you croak then come out on the bank and have a hopping match with me ii dont croak yet stammered the first tadpole aand i dont care to hop you are just a tailless tadpole said the yellow brown frog sternly dont any more of you youngsters try such a plan or some of you will be tadpoleless tails and a good many of you wont be anything the old snapping turtle waited all morning for some more tadpoles who wanted to be made into frogs but none came the biggest frog croaked hoarsely when he heard of it tails tails tails tails tails tails tails tails said he that youngster will never be a strong frog tadpoles must be tadpoles tails and all for a long time if they hope to ever be really fine frogs like me and that is so as any frog will tell you the green brown frog sighed as she crawled out on the bank what a silly tadpole she said im glad he isnt my child when the little water spiders first opened their eyes and this was as soon as they were hatched they found themselves in a cosy home of one room which their mother had built under the water this room had no window and only one door there was no floor at all when father stickleback had asked mrs spider why she did not make a floor she had looked at him in great surprise and said why if i had built one i should have no place to go in and out she really thought him quite stupid not to think of that it often happens you know that really clever people think each other stupid just because they live in different ways afterward mrs water spider saw father sticklebacks nest and understood why he asked that question when her home was done it was half as large as a big acorn and a charming place for water spider babies the side walls and the rounding ceiling were all of the finest spider silk and the bottom was just one round doorway the house was built under the water and fastened down by tiny ropes of spider silk which were tied to the stems of pond plants mrs water spider looked at it with a happy smile next i must fill it with air said she and then it will be ready i am out of breath now she crept up the stem of the nearest plant and sat in the air for a few minutes eating her lunch and resting next she walked down the stem until just the end of her body was in the air she stood so with her head down then gave a little jerk and dove to her home as she jerked she crossed her hindlegs and caught a small bubble of air between them and her body when she reached her home she went quickly in the open doorway and let go of her bubble it did not fall downward to the floor as bubbles do in most houses and there were two reasons for this in the first place there was no floor in the second place air always falls upward in the water this fell up until it reached the rounded ceiling and had to stop just as it fell a drop of water went out through the open doorway the home had been full of water you know but now that mrs spider had begun to bring in air something had to be moved to make a place for it she brought down thirteen more bubbles of air and then the house was filled with it on the lower side of the open doorway there was water and on the upper side was air and each stayed where it should when mrs spider came into her house she always had some air caught in the hairs which covered her body even when she did not bring a bubble of it in her hindlegs she had to have plenty of it in her home to keep her from drowning for she could not breathe water like a fish side doors may be all right for sticklebacks said she for they do not need air but i must have bottom doors and i will have them too after she had laid her eggs she had some days in which to rest and visit with the waterboatmen who lived near they were great friends belostoma used to ask the waterboatmen who were his cousins why they were so neighborly with the water spiders i dont like to see you so much with eightlegged people he said they are not our kind belostoma was very proud of his family we know that they have rather too many legs to look well said mrs waterboatman but they are pleasant and we are interested in the same things you know we both carry air about with us in the water and so few of our neighbors seem to care anything for it she was a sensible little person and knew that people who are really fond of their friends do not care how many legs they have she carried her air under her wings but there
 were other waterboatmen near relatives who spread theirs over their whole bodies and looked very silvery and beautiful when they were under water one day when mrs water spider was sitting on a lilypad and talking with her friends a waterboatman rose quickly from the bottom of the pond as soon as he got right side up and that means as soon as he got to floating on his back he said to her i heard queer sounds in your house i was feeding near there and the noise startled me so that i let go of the stone i was holding to and came up i think your eggs must be hatching really exclaimed mrs water spider i shall be so glad a house always seems lonely to me without children she dove to her house and found some very fine water spider babies there you may be sure she did not have much time for visiting after that she had to hunt food and carry it down to her children and when they were restless and impatient she stayed with them and told them stories of the great world sometimes they teased to go out with her but this she never allowed wait until you are older she would say it will not be so very long before you can go safely the children thought it had been a long long time already and one of them made a face when his mother said this she did not see him and it was well for him that she did not he should have been very much ashamed of himself for doing it the next time mrs water spider went for food one of the children said i tell you what lets do lets all go down to the doorway and peek out they looked at each other and wondered if they dared that was something their mother had forbidden them to do there was no window to look through and they wanted very much to see the world at last the little fellow who had made a face said im going to anyway after that his brothers and sisters went too and this shows how if good little spiders listen to naughty little spiders they become naughty little spiders themselves all the children ran down and peeked around the edge of the door but they couldnt see much besides water and they had seen that before they were sadly disappointed somebody said im going to put two of my legs out somebody else said ill put four out a big brother said im going to put six out and then another brother said ill put eight out dare you to you know what naughty little spiders would be likely to do then well they did it and as it happened they had just pulled their last legs through the open doorway when a stickleback father came along arent you rather young to be out of the nest said he in his most pleasant voice poor little water spiders they didnt know he was one of their mothers friends and he seemed so big to them and the bones on his cheeks made him look so queer and the stickles on his back were so sharp that every one of them was afraid and let go of the wall of the houseand then every one of them rose quickly to the top into the light and the open air they crawled upon a lilypad and clung there frightened and feeling weak in all their knees the dragon flies flew over them the wild ducks swam past them and on a log not far away they saw a long row of mud turtles sunning themselves why nothing dreadful happened one cannot tell perhaps it was bad enough as it was for they were so scared that they could only huddle close together and cry we want our mother here mrs water spider found them she came home with something for dinner and saw her house empty of course she knew where to look for as she said if they stepped outside the door they would be quite sure to tumble up into the air she took them home one at a time and how she ever did it nobody knows when they were all safely there and had eaten the food that was waiting for them mrs spider who had not scolded them at all said look me straight in the eye every one of you will you promise never to run away again instead of saying at once yes mother as they should have done one of them answered why we didnt run away we were just peeking around the edge of the doorway and we got too far out and somebody came along and scared us so that we let go and then we couldnt help falling up into the air oh no said their mother you couldnt help it then of course but who told you that you might peep out of the door the little water spiders hung their heads and looked very much ashamed their mother went on you neednt say that you were not to blame you were to blame and you began to run away as soon as you took the first step toward the door only you didnt know that you were going so far tell me she said whether you would ever have gone to the top of the water if you had not taken that first step the little water spiders were more ashamed than ever but they had to look her in the eye and promise to be good it is very certain that not one of those children even peeped around the edge of the doorway from that day until their mother told them that they might go into the world and build houses for themselves remember just one thing she said as they started away always take your food home to eat and they always did for no water spider who has been well brought up will ever eat away from his own home when the twenty little mud turtles broke their eggshells one hot summer day and poked their way up through the warm sand in which they had been buried they looked almost as much alike as so many raindrops the mother turtle who was sunning herself on the bank near by said to her friends why there are my children did you ever see a finer family i believe i will go over and speak to them most of the young mud turtles crawled quickly out of the sand and broken shells and began drying themselves in the sunshine one slow little fellow stopped to look at the broken shells stubbed one of his front toes on a large piece and then sat down until it should stop aching wait for me he called out to his brothers and sisters im coming in a minute the other little turtles waited but when his toe was comfortable again and he started toward them he met a very interesting snail and talked a while with him come on said the biggest little turtle dont lets wait any longer he can catch up so they sprawled along until they came to a place where they could sit in a row on an old log and they climbed onto it and sat just close enough together and not at all too close then the slow little turtle came hurrying over the sand with a rather cross look in his eyes and putting his feet down a little harder than he needed toquite as though he were out of patience about something why didnt you turtles wait for me he grumbled i was coming right along just then the mother turtle came up good morning said she i believe you are my children the little mud turtles looked at each other and didnt say a word this was not because they were rude or bashful but because they did not know what to say and that you know was quite right for unless one has something worth saying it is far better to say nothing at all she drew a long mud turtle breath and answered her own question yes she said you certainly are for i saw you scrambling out of the sand a little while ago and you came from the very place where i laid my eggs and covered them during the first really warm nights this year i was telling your father only yesterday that it was about time for you to hatch the sun has been so hot lately that i was sure you would do well the mother turtle stretched her head this way and that until there was hardly a wrinkle left in her neckskin she was so eager to see them all why are you not up here with your brothers and sisters she asked suddenly of the slow little turtle who was trying to make a place for himself on the log they didnt wait for me he said i was coming right along but they wouldnt wait i think they are just as mea the mother turtle raised one of her forefeet until all five of its toes with their strong claws were pointing at him she also raised her head as far as her upper shell would let her so you are the one she said i thought you were when i heard you trying to make the others wait it is too bad she looked so stern that the slow little turtle didnt dare finish what he had begun to say yet down in his little turtle heart he thought now they are going to catch it he was sure his mother was going to scold the other turtle children for leaving him he wanted to see what they would do so he looked out of his right eye at the ten brothers and sisters on that side and out of his left eye at the nine brothers and sisters on that side he could do this very easily because his eyes were not on the front of his head like those of some people but one on each side i have raised families of young turtles every year said the mother turtle the first year i had only a few children the next year i had more and so it has goneevery year a few more children than the year beforeuntil now i never know quite how many i do have but there is always one slow little turtle who lags behind and wants the others to wait for him that makes him miss his share of good things and then he is quite certain to be cross and think it is somebody elses fault the slow little turtle felt the ten brothers and sisters on his right side looking at him out of their left eyes and the nine brothers and sisters on his left side looking at him out of their right eyes he drew in his head and his tail and his legs until all they could see was his rounded upper shell his shell sidewalls and the yellow edge of his flat lower shell he would have liked to draw them in too but of course he couldnt do that i did hope said the mother turtle that i might have one family without such a child in it i cannot help loving even a slow child who is cross if he is hatched from one of my eggs yet it makes me sadvery very sad try to get over this she said to the slow little turtle before it is too late and you she added turning to his brothers and sisters must be patient with him we shall not
 have him with us long what do you mean asked the slow little turtle peeping out from between his shells im not going away you do not want to said his mother but you will not be with us long unless you learn to keep up with the rest something always happens to pond people who are too slow i cannot tell you what it will be yet it is sure to be something i remember so well my first slow childand how he she began to cry and since she could not easily get her forefeet to her eyes she sprawled to the pond and swam off with only her head and a little of her upper shell showing above the water the slow little turtle was really frightened by what his mother had said and for a few days he tried to keep up with the others nothing happened to him and so he grew careless and made people wait for him just because he was not quite ready to go with them or because he wanted to do this or look at that or talk to some other person he was a very trying little turtle yet his mother loved him and did not like it when the rest called him a land tortoise it is all right you know to be a land tortoise when your father and mother are land tortoises and these cousins of the turtles look so much like them that some people cannot tell them apart that is because they forget that the tortoises live on land have higher back shells and move very very slowly turtles live more in the water and can move quickly if they will this is why other turtles sometimes make fun of a slow brother by calling him a land tortoise one beautiful sunshiny afternoon when most of the twenty little turtles were sitting on a floating log by the edge of the pond their mother was with some of her friends on another log near by she looked often at her children and thought how handsome their roundedup back shells were in the sunshine with the little red and yellow markings showing on the black she could see their strong little pointed tails too and their webbed feet with a stout claw on each toe she was so proud that she could not help talking about them is there any sight more beautiful she said than a row of good little turtles yes said a fine old fellow who was floating near her a row of their mothers he was a turtle whom she had never liked very well but now she began to think that he was rather agreeable after all she was just noticing how beautifully the skin wrinkled on his neck when she heard a splash and saw two terrible great twolegged animals wading into the pond from the shore boys she cried boys and she sprawled off the end of her log and slid into the water all her friends following her the biggest little turtle saw these great animals coming toward him he sprawled off the end of his log and slid into the water and all his brothers and sisters followed him except the slow little turtle wait for me he said im coming in just a then one of these great animals stooped over and picked him up and held him bottom side uppermost and rapped on that side which was flat and on the other side which was rounded and stared at him with two great eyes next the other great animal took him and turned him over and rapped on his shells and stared at him the poor slow little turtle drew in his head and tail and legs and kept very very still he wished that he had sidepieces of shell all around now instead of just one on each side between his legs he was thinking over and over something has happened something has happened and he knew that back in the pond his mother would be trying to find him and could not the boys carried him to the edge of the meadow and put him down on the grass he lay perfectly still for a long long time and when he thought they had forgotten about him he tried to run away then they laughed and picked him up again and one of them took something sharp and shiny and cut marks into his upper shell this did not really give him pain yet as he said afterward it hurts almost as much to think you are going to be hurt as it does to be hurt it was not until the sun went down that the boys let the slow little turtle go then he was very very tired but he wanted so much to get back to his home in the pond that he started at once by moonlight this was the first time he had ever seen the moon for except when they are laying eggs turtles usually sleep at night he was not quite sure which way he should go and if it had not been for the kindness of the tree frog he might never have seen his brothers and sisters again you know the tree frog had been carried away when he was young before he came to live with the meadow people so he knew how to be sorry for the slow little turtle the tree frog hopped along ahead to show the way and the turtle followed until they reached a place from which they could see the pond good night said the tree frog you can find your way now good night said the turtle i wish i might help you some time never mind me said the tree frog help somebody else and it will be all right he hopped back toward his home and for a long time afterward the turtle heard his cheerful pukrrrup pukrrrup sounding over the dewy grass and through the still air at the edge of the pond the slow little turtle found his nineteen brothers and sisters sound asleep im here he cried joyfully poking first one and then another of them with his head the biggest little turtle moved without awakening i tell you im not hungry he murmured i dont want to get up and again he fell fast asleep so the slow little turtle did not disturb him but cuddled inside his two shells and went to sleep also he was so tired that he did not awaken until the sun was high in the sky when he did open his eyes his relatives were sitting around looking at him and he remembered all that had happened before he slept does my shell look very bad he cried i wish i could see it oh i am so glad to get back ill never be slow again never never his mother came and leaned her shell lovingly against his if you will only learn to keep up with your brothers and sisters she said i shall not be sorry that the boys carried you off you just wait and see said the slow little turtle and he was as good as his word after that he was always the first to slip from the log to the water if anything scared them and when one day a strange turtle from another pond came to visit he said to the turtles who had always lived there why do you call that young fellow with the marked shell the slow little turtle he is the quickest one in his family the pond people looked at each other and laughed that is queer they said after this we will call him the quick little turtle this made him very happy and when once in a while somebody forgot and by mistake called him the quick slow little turtle he said he rather liked it because it showed that a turtle neednt keep his faults if he did have them the dragonflies have always lived near the pond not the same ones that are there now of course but the greatgreatgreatgrandfathers of these a person would think that after a family had lived so long in a place all the neighbors would be fond of them yet it is not so the dragonflies may be very good peopleand even the snapping turtle says that they arestill they are so peculiar that many of their neighbors do not like them at all even when they are only larvæ or babies they are not good playmates for they have such a bad habit of putting everything into their mouths indeed the stickleback father once told the little sticklebacks that they should not stir out of the nest unless they would promise to keep away from the young dragonflies the stickleback mothers said that it was all the fault of the dragonfly mothers what can you expect exclaimed one of them when dragonfly eggs are so carelessly laid i saw a dragonfly mother laying some only yesterday and how do you suppose she did it just flew around in the sunshine and visited with her friends and once in a while flew low enough to touch the water and drop one in it is disgraceful the minnow mothers did not think it was so much in the way the eggs were laid although said one i always lay mine close together instead of scattering them over the whole pond they thought the trouble came from bad bringing up or no bringing up at all each egg you know when it is laid drops to the bottom of the pond and the children are hatched and grow up there and do not even see their fathers and mothers now most of the larvæ were turning into nymphs which are halfgrown dragon flies they had been short and plump and now they were longer and more slender and there were little bunches on their shoulders where the wings were growing under their skin they had outgrown their old skins a great many times and had to wriggle out of them to be at all comfortable when a dragonfly child became too big for his skin he hooked the two sharp claws of each of his six feet firmly into something unfastened his skin down the back and wriggled out leaving it to roll around in the water until it became just part of the mud like most growing children the dragonfly larvæ and nymphs had to eat a great deal their stomachs were as long as their bodies and they were never really happy unless their stomachs were full they always ate plain food and plenty of it and they never ate between meals they had breakfast from the time they awakened in the morning until the sun was high in the sky then they had dinner until the sun was low in the sky and supper from that time until it grew dark and they went to sleep but never a mouthful between meals no matter how hungry they might be they said this was their only rule about eating and they would keep it they were always slow children you would think that with six legs apiece and three joints in each leg they might walk quite fast yet they never did when they had to they hurried in another way by taking a long leap through the water of course they breathed water like their neighbors the fishes and the tadpoles they did not breathe
 it into their mouths or through gills but took it in through some openings in the back part of their bodies when they wanted to hurry they breathed this water out so suddenly that it sent them quickly ahead the snapping turtle had called them bothering bugs one day when he was cross and that was the day after he had been cross and just before the day when he was going to be cross again and they didnt like him and wanted to get even they all put their queer little threecornered heads together and there was an ugly look in their great staring eyes horrid old thing said one larva i wish i could sting him well you cant said a nymph turning towards him so suddenly that he leaped you havent any sting and you never will have so you just keep still it was not at all nice in her to speak that way but she was not well brought up you know and that perhaps is a reason why one should excuse her for talking so to her little brother she was often impatient and said she could never go anywhere without one of the larvæ tagging along i tell you what lets do said another nymph lets all go together to the shallow water where he suns himself and lets all stand close to each other and then when he comes along lets stick out our lips at him both lips asked the larvæ well our lower lips anyway answered the nymph our upper lips are so small they dont matter well do it exclaimed all the dragonfly children and they started together to walk on the pondbottom to the shallow water they thought it would scare the snapping turtle dreadfully they knew that whenever they stuck out their lower lips at the small fishes and bugs they swam away as fast as they could the giant waterbug belostoma was the only bug who was not afraid of them when they made faces indeed the lower lip of a dragonfly child might well frighten people for it is fastened on a long jointed armlike thing and has pincers on it with which it catches and holds its food most of the time the dragonfly child keeps the joint bent and so holds his lip up to his face like a mask but sometimes he straightens the joint and holds his lip out before him and then its pincers catch hold of things he does this when he is hungry when they reached the shallow water the dragonfly children stood close together with the larvæ in the middle and the nymphs all around them the snapping turtle was nowhere to be seen so they had to wait arent you scared whispered one larva to another scared dah whos afraid answered he oh look cried a nymph there go some grownup dragonflies over our heads just you wait until i change my skin once more and then wont i have a good time ill dry my wings and then ill shh said one of the larvæ here comes the snapping turtle sure enough there he came through the shallow water his wet backshell partly out of it and shining in the sunlight he came straight toward the dragonfly children and they were glad to see that he did not look hungry they thought he might be going to take a nap after his dinner then they all stood even closer together and stuck out their lower lips at him they thought he might run away when they did this they felt sure that he would at least be very badly frightened the snapping turtle did not seem to see them at all it was queer he just waddled on and on coming straight toward them ahhh said he how sleepy i do feel i will lie down in the sunshine and rest he took a few more steps which brought his great body right over the crowd of dragonfly children i think i will draw in my head said he the dragonfly children looked at each other and my tail here two of the youngest larvæ began to cry and lie down he began to draw in his legs very very slowly and just as his great hard lower shell touched the mud the last larva crawled out under his tail the nymphs had already gotten away oh said the dragonfly children to each other wasnt it awful humph said the snapping turtle talking to himselfhe had gotten into the way of doing that because he had so few friendshow dreadfully they did scare me then he laughed a grim snapping turtle laugh and went to sleep there was but one snapping turtle in the pond and he was the only person there who had ever been heard to wish for another he had not always lived there and could just remember leaving his brothers and sisters when he was young i was carried away from my people he said and kept on land for a few days then i was brought here and have made it my home ever since one could tell by looking at him that he was related to the mud turtles he had upper and lower shells like them and could draw in his head and legs and tail when he wanted to his shells were gray quite the color of a claybank and his head was larger than those of the mud turtles his tail was long and scaly and pointed and his forelegs were large and warty there were fine strong webs between his toes as there were between the toes of his relatives the mud turtles when he first came to live in the pond people were sorry for him and tried to make him feel at home he had a chance to win many friends and have all his neighbors fond of him but he was too snappy when the water was just warm enough and his stomach was full and he had slept well the night before and everything was exactly as he wished it to beah then he was a very agreeable turtle and was ready to talk in the most gracious way to his neighbors that was all very well anybody can be goodnatured when everything is exactly right and he can have his own way but the really delightful people you know are the ones who are pleasant when things go wrong it was a mud turtle father who first spoke to him i hope youll like the pond said he we think it very homelike and comfortable humph shallow little hole snapped the one who had just come i bump my head on the bottom every time i dive that is too bad exclaimed the mud turtle father i hope you dive where there is a soft bottom sometimes i do and sometimes i dont answered the snapping turtle i cant bother to swim down slowly and try it and then go back to dive when i want to dive i want to dive and thats all there is to it yes said the mud turtle father i know how it is when one has the diving feeling i hope your head will not trouble you much and that you will soon be used to our waters he spread his toes and swam strongly away pushing against the water with his webbed feet humph said the snapping turtle to himself it is all very well to talk about getting used to these waters but i never shall i can hardly see now for the pain in the right side of my head where i bumped it or was it the left side i hit queer i cant remember then he swam to shallow water and drew himself into his shell and lay there and thought how badly he felt and how horrid the pond was and what poor company his neighbors were and what a disagreeable world this is for snapping turtles the mud turtle father went home and told his wife all about it what a disagreeable fellow she said but then he is a bachelor and bachelors are often queer i never was said her husband oh said she and being a wise wife she did not say anything else she knew however that mr mud turtle was a much more agreeable fellow since he had married and learned to think more of somebody else than of himself it is the people who think too much of themselves you know who are most unhappy in this world the eels also tried to be friendly and when he dove to the bottom called to him to stay and visit with them you must excuse us from making the first call they said we go out so little in the daytime humph said the snapping turtle do you good to get away from home more no wonder your eyes are weak when you lie around in the mud of the dark pondbottom all day indeed ill not stay you can come to see me like other people then he swam away and told the clams what he had said and he acted quite proud of what was really dreadful rudeness itll do them good to hear the truth said he i always speak right out they are as bad as the wateradder they have no backbone the clams listened politely and said nothing they never did talk much the snapping turtle was mistaken though when he said that the eels and the wateradder had no backbone they really had much more than he but they wore theirs inside while his was spread out in the shape of a shell for everybody to see he did not even try to keep his temper he became angry one day because belostoma the giant waterbug ate something which he wanted for himself his eyes glared and his horny jaws snapped and he waved his long pointed scaly tail in a way which was terrible to see you are a goodfornothing bug he said you do no work and you eat more than any other person of your size here nobody likes you and there isnt a little fish in the pond who would be seen with you if he could help it they all hide if they see you coming ill be heartily glad when you get your wings and fly away dont let any of your friends lay their eggs in this pond ive seen enough of your family of course this made belostoma feel very badly he was not a popular bug and it is possible that if he could have had his own way he would have chosen to be a crayfish or a stickleback rather than what he was as for his not workingthere was nothing for him to do so how could he work he had to eat or he would not grow and since the snapping turtle was a hearty eater himself he should have had the sense to keep still about that belostoma told the mud turtles what the snapping turtle had said and the mud turtle father spoke of it to the snapping turtle by that time the snapping turtle was feeling better natured and was very gracious belostoma shouldnt remember those things said he moving one warty foreleg when i am angry i often say things that i do not mean but then i get right over it i had almost forgotten my little talk with him i dont see any reason for telling him i am sorry he is very silly to think so much of it he lifted his big head quite
 high and acted as though it was really a noble thing to be ugly and then forget about it he might just as sensibly ask people to admire him for not eating when his stomach was full or for lying still when he was too tired to swim when the mud turtle mother heard of this she was quite out of patience all he cares for said she is just snapping turtle snapping turtle snapping turtle when he is goodnatured he thinks everybody else ought to be and when he is badtempered he doesnt care how other people feel he will never be any more agreeable until he does something kind for somebody and i dont see any chance of that happening there came a day though when the pond people were glad that the snapping turtle lived there two boys were wading in the edge of the pond splashing the water and scaring all the people who were near them the sticklebacks turned pale all over as they do when they are badly frightened the yellow brown frog was so scared that he emptied out the water he had saved for wetting his skin in dry weather he had a great pocket in his body filled with water for if his skin should get dry he couldnt breathe through it and unless he carried water with him he could not stay ashore at all the boys had even turned the mud turtle father onto his back in the sunshine where he lay waving his feet in the air but not strong enough to get right side up again the snapping turtle was taking a nap in deep water when the frightened fishes came swimming toward him as fast as their tails would take them what is the matter said he boys cried they boys the dreadful splashing turtleturning kind humph said the snapping turtle ill have to see about that how many are there two cried the sticklebacks and minnows together and there is only one of me said the snapping turtle to himself i must have somebody to help me oh belostoma he cried as the giant waterbug swam past help me drive those boys away with pleasure said belostoma who liked nothing better than this kind of work off they started for the place where the boys were wading the snapping turtle took long strong strokes with his webbed feet and belostoma could not keep up with him the snapping turtle saw this jump onto my back cried he you are a light fellow hang tight belostoma jumped onto the snapping turtles claycolored shell and when he found himself slipping off the back end of it he stuck his claws into the snapping turtles tail and held on in that way he knew that he was not easily hurt even if he did make a fuss when he bumped his head as soon as they got near the boys the snapping turtle spoke over his backshell to belostoma slide off now said he and drive away the smaller boy dont stop to talk with these bloodsuckers so belostoma slid off and swam toward the smaller boy and he ran out his stout little sucking tube and stung him on the leg just then the snapping turtle brought his horny jaws together on one of the larger boys feet there was a great splashing and dashing as the boys ran to the shore and three bloodsuckers who had fastened themselves to the boys legs did not have time to drop off and were carried ashore and never seen again  there said the snapping turtle thats done i dont know what the pond people would do if you and i were not here to look after them belostoma im glad i happened along said the giant waterbug quietly but you will have to do it all after this im about ready to leave the pond i think ill go tomorrow going tomorrow exclaimed the snapping turtle im sorry of course i know you can never come back but send your friends here to lay their eggs we mustnt be left without some of your family thank you said belostoma and he did not show that he remembered some quite different things which the snapping turtle had said before about his leaving the pond and that showed that he was a very wise bug as well as a brave one humph said the snapping turtle there is the mud turtle father on his back and he ran to him and pushed him over onto his feet oh thank you cried the mud turtle mother i was not strong enough to do that always glad to help my neighbors said the snapping turtle pleasant day isnt it i must tell the fishes that the boys are gone the poor little fellows were almost too scared to swim and he went away with a really happy look on his face there said the mud turtle mother to her husband he has begun to help people and now he likes them and is contented i always told you so none of the pond people were alone more than the wateradders the snapping turtle was left to himself a great deal until the day when he and belostoma drove away the boys after that his neighbors began to understand him better and he was less grumpy so that those who wore shells were soon quite fond of him belostoma did not have many friends among the smaller people and only a few among the larger ones they said that he was cruel and that he had a bad habit of using his stout sucking tube to sting with still belostoma did not care he said a giant waterbug does not always live in the water i shall have my wings soon and leave the water and marry after that i shall fly away on my wedding trip mrs belostoma may go with me if she feels like doing so after laying her eggs here i shall go anyway and i shall flutter and sprawl around the light and sting people who bother me and have a happy time that was belostomas way he would sting people who bothered him but then he always said that they need not have bothered him and perhaps that was so with the wateradders it was different they were goodnatured enough yet the mud turtles and snapping turtle were the only ones who ever called upon them and found them at home the small people without shells were afraid of them and the clams and pond snails never called upon any one the minnows said they could not bear the looks of the addersthey had such ugly mouths and such quick motions the larger fishes kept away on account of their children who were small and tender one might think that the sandhill cranes the fish hawks and the other shore families would have been good friends for them but when they called the adders were always away people said that the adders were afraid of them the yellow brown frog wished that the adders could be scared badly scared some time so scared that a chilly feeling would run down their backs from their heads clear to the tips of their tails i wish said he that the chilly feeling would be big enough to go way through to their bellies their bellies are only the front side of their backs anyway he added because they are so thin of course this was a dreadful wish to make but people said that one of the adders had frightened the yellow brown frog so that he never got over it and this was the reason he felt so the wateradders were certainly the cleverest people in the pond and there was one mother adder who was so very bright that they called her the clever wateradder she could do almost anything and she knew it she talked about it too and that showed bad taste and was one reason why she was not liked better she could swim very fast could creep glide catch hold of things with her tail hang herself from the branch of a tree lift her head far into the air leap dart bound and dive all her family could do these things but she could do them a little the best one day she was hanging over the pond in a very graceful position with her tail twisted carelessly around a willow branch the snapping turtle and a mud turtle father were in the shallow water below her her slender forked tongue was darting in and out of her open mouth she was using her tongue in this way most of the time it is useful in feeling of things she said and then i have always thought it quite becoming she could see herself reflected in the still water below her and she noticed how prettily the dark brown of her back shaded into the white of her belly you see she was vain as well as clever the snapping turtle felt cross today and had come to see if a talk with her would not make him feel better the mud turtle was tired of having the children sprawl around him and of mrs mud turtle telling about the trouble she had to get the right kind of food the clever wateradder spoke first of the weather it must be dreadfully hot for the shore people she said think of their having to wear the same feathers all the year and fly around in the sunshine to find food for their children ah yes said the mud turtle how they must wish for shells humph said the snapping turtle what for to fly with let them come in swimming with their children if they are warm and tired the wateradder laughed in her snaky way and showed her sharp teeth i have heard she said that when the wild ducks bring their children here to swim they do not always take so many home as they brought the snapping turtle became very much interested in his warty right foreleg and did not seem to hear what she said the mud turtle smiled i have heard she went on that when young ducks dive head first they are quite sure to come up again but that when they dive feet first they never come up what do you mean asked the snapping turtle and he was snappy about it oh nothing replied the wateradder swinging her head back and forth and looking at the scales on her body i know what you mean said the snapping turtle and you know what you mean but i have to eat something and if i am swimming under the water and a duckling paddles along just above me and sticks his foot into my mouth i am likely to swallow him before i think the wateradder saw that he was provoked by what she had said so she talked about something else i think the ducks spoil their children said she they make such a fuss over them and they are not nearly so bright as my children why mine hatch as soon as the eggs are laid and go hunting at once they are no trouble at all i never worry about mine said the mud turtle although their mother thinks it is not safe for them
 all to sleep at once as they do on a log in the sunshine it isnt said the adder decidedly i never close my eyes none of us adders do nobody can ever say that we close our eyes to danger they couldnt shut their eyes if they wanted to because they had no eyelids but she did not speak of that how stupid people are she said most of them remarked the turtles all of them she said except us adders and the turtles i even think that some of the turtles are a little queer dont you we have thought so said the mud turtle they certainly are agreed the snapping turtle who was beginning to feel much better natured what did you say asked the adder who like all her family was a little deaf ouch exclaimed the snapping turtle ouch ouch what is the matter asked the mud turtle then he began to slap the water with his short stout tail and say ouch two naughty young waterboatmen had swum quietly up on their backs and stung the turtles on their tails then they swam away pushing themselves quickly through the water with swift strokes of their hairy oarlegs ahhh exclaimed the snapping turtle and he backed into the mud knowing that fine soft mud is the best thing in the world for stings ahhh exclaimed the mud turtle if i could only reach my tail with my head or even with one of my hind feet reach your tail with your head asked the wateradder in her sweetest voice nothing is easier and she wound herself around the willow branch in another graceful position and took the tip of her tail daintily between her teeth humph said the snapping turtle and he pulled his tail out of the mud and swam away ugh said the mud turtle and he swam away with the snapping turtle what a rude person she is they said always trying to show how much more clever she is than other people we would rather be stupid and polite after a while the snapping turtle said but then you know we are not stupid of course not replied the mud turtle not even queer when the sandhill cranes were married they began to work for a home of their own to be sure they had chosen a place for it beforehand yet there were other things to think about and some of their friends told them it would be very foolish to build on the ground there are so many accidents to ground nests these friends said there are snakes you know and rats and a great many other people whom you would not want to have look in on your children besides something might fall on it the young couple talked this all over and decided to build in a tree we are not afraid of snakes and rats they said but we would fear something falling on the nest they were talking to quite an old crane when they said this do you mean to build in a tree said he my dear young friends dont do that just think a high wind might blow the nest down and spoil everything do whatever you wish but dont build in a tree then he flew away dear me exclaimed young mrs crane one tells me to do this and never to do that another tells me to do that and never to do this i shall just please myself since i cannot please my friends and which place do you choose asked her husband who always liked whatever she did i shall build on the ground she said decidedly if the tree falls it may hit the nest and it may not but if we build in the tree and it falls we are sure to hit the ground how wise you are exclaimed her husband i believe people get in a way of building just so and come to think that no other way can be right which shows that mr sandhill crane was also wise both worked on the nest bringing roots and dried grasses with which to build it up sometimes they went to dance with their friends and when they did they bowed most of the time to each other they did not really care very much about going because they were so interested in the nest this they had to build quite high from the ground on account of their long legs if i were a duck said mrs sandhill crane it would do very well for me to sit on the nest but with my legs never i would as soon sit on two bare branches as to have them doubled under me so she tried the nest until it was just as high as her legs were long when it was high enough she laid in it two gray eggs with brown spots after that she did no more dancing but stood with a leg on either side of the nest and her soft body just over the eggs to keep them warm it was very tiresome work and sometimes mr crane covered the eggs while she went fishing the cranes are always very kind to their wives this you know was the first time that either had had a nest and it was all new and wonderful to them they thought that there never had been such a beautiful home they often stood on the ground beside it and poked it this way and that with their bills and said to each other just look at this fine root that i wove in or have you noticed how well that tuft of dried grass looks where i put it as it came near the time for their eggs to hatch they could hardly bear to be away long enough to find food one day young mr sandhill crane came home much excited our neighbors the cranes who live across the pond said he had two children hatched this morning oh how glad i am cried his wife how glad i am those eggs were laid just before ours which must hatch very soon now that is what i thought said he i feel so sorry for them though for i saw their children and they are dreadfully homelynot at all like their parents who are quite goodlooking i must see them myself said his wife and if you will cover the eggs while i go for food i will just peep in on them i will hurry back she flew steadily across the pond which was not very wide and asked to see the babies she had never seen any crane children you know since she herself was little she thought them very ugly to look at and wondered how their mother could seem bright and cheerful with two such disappointing children she said all the polite things that she honestly could then got something to eat and flew home they are very very homely she said to her husband and i think it queer all their older children are goodlooking she had hardly said this when she heard a faint tapping sound in the nest she looked and there was the tip of a tiny beak showing through the shell of one egg she stood on one side of the nest watching and her husband stood on the other while their oldest child slowly made his way out they dared not help for fear of hurting him and besides all the other cranes had told them that they must not oh look cried the young mother what a dear little bill ah said the young father did you ever see such a neck look at those legs cried she what a beautiful child he is he looks just like you said the father and i am glad of it ah no said she he is exactly like you and she began to clear away the broken eggshell soon the other crane baby poked her bill out and again the young parents stood around and admired their child they could not decide which was the handsomer but they were sure that both were remarkable babies they felt more sorry than ever for their neighbors across the pond who had such homely children they took turns in covering their own damp little cranes and were very very happy before this it had been easy to get what food they wanted for there had been two to work for two now there were two to work for four and that made it much harder there was no time for dancing and both father and mother worked steadily yet they were happier than ever and neither would have gone back to the careless old days for all the food in the pond or all the dances on the beach the little cranes grew finely they changed their down for pinfeathers and then these grew into fine brownish gray feathers like those which their parents wore they were good children too and very well brought up they ate whatever food was given to them and never found fault with it when they left the nest for the first time they fluttered and tumbled and had trouble in learning to walk a mud turtle father who was near told them that this was because their legs were too long and too few well said the brother as he picked himself up and tried to stand on one leg while he drew the other foot out of the tangled grass they may be too long but im sure there are enough of them when im thinking about one i never can tell what the other will do still it was not long before they could walk and wade and even fly then they met the other pond people and learned to tell a stickleback from a minnow they did not have many playmates the saucy little kingfishers sat on branches over their heads the wild ducks waddled or swam under their very bills the fish hawks floated in air above them and the gulls screamed hoarsely to them as they circled over the pond yet none of them were longlegged and stately the things that the other birds enjoyed most they could not do and sometimes they did not like it very well one night they were talking about the gulls when they should have been asleep and their father told them to tuck their heads right under their wings and not let him hear another word from them they did tuck their heads under their wings but they peeped out between the feathers and when they were sure their father and mother were asleep they walked softly away and planned to do something naughty im tired of being good said the brother the gulls never are good they scream and snatch and contradict and have lots of fun lets be bad just for fun all right said his sister what shall we do thats the trouble said he i cant think of anything naughty that i really care for each stood on one leg and thought for a while we might run away said she where would we go asked he we might go to the meadow said she so they started off in the moonlight and went to the meadow but all the people there were asleep except the tree frog and he scrambled out of the way as soon as he saw them coming because he thought they might want a late supper this isnt any fun said the brother lets go to the forest they went to
 the forest and saw the bats flitting in and out among the trees and the bats flew close to the cranes and scared them the great horned owl stood on a branch near them and stared at them with his big round eyes and said who who waughhooo then the brother and sister stood closer together and answered if you please sir we are the crane children but the great horned owl kept on staring at them and saying who who waughhooo until they were sure he was deaf and answered louder and louder still the screech owls came also and looked at them and bent their bodies over as if they were laughing and nodded their heads and shook themselves then the crane children were sure that they were being made fun of so they stalked away very stiffly and when they were out of sight of the owls they flew over toward the farmhouse they were not having any fun at all yet and they meant to keep on trying for what was the good of being naughty if they didnt they passed horses and cows asleep in the fields and saw the brown hog lying in the pen with a great many little brown pigs and one white pig sleeping beside her nobody was awake except collie the shepherd dog who was sitting in the farmyard with his nose in the air barking at the moon go away he said to the crane children who were walking around the yard go away i must bark at the moon and i dont want anybody around they did not start quite soon enough to please him so he dashed at them and ran around them and barked at them instead of at the moon until they were glad enough to fly straight home to the place where their father and mother were sleeping with their heads under their wings are you going to tell them asked the brother i dont know answered the sister when morning came they looked tired and their father and mother seemed so worried about them that they told the whole story we didnt care so very much about what we did they said but we thought it would be fun to be naughty the father and mother looked at each other in a very knowing way a great many people think that said the mother gently they are mistaken after all it is really more fun to be good well i wish the gulls wouldnt scream goodygoody at us said the brother what difference does that make asked his father why should a crane care what a gull says why ii dont know stammered the brother i guess it doesnt make any difference after all the next day when the crane children were standing in the edge of the pond a pair of young gulls flew down near them and screamed out goodygoody then the crane brother and sister lifted their heads and necks and opened their long bills and trumpeted back baddybaddy there they said to each other now we are even when the oldest dragonfly nymph felt that the wings under her skin were large enough she said goodbye to her water friends and crawled slowly up the stem of a tall cattail all the other dragonfly nymphs crowded around her and wished that their wings were more nearly ready and the larvæ talked about the time when they should become nymphs the oldest nymph the one who was going away told them that if they would be good little larvæ and eat a great deal of plain food and take care not to break any of their legs or to hurt either of their short stiff little feelers they would some day be fine great nymphs like her then she crawled slowly up the cattail stem and when she drew the tenth and last joint of her body out of the water her friends turned to each other and said she is really gone they felt so badly about it that they had to eat something at once to keep from crying the oldest nymph now stopped breathing water and began to breathe air she waited to look at the pond before she went any farther she had never seen it from above and it looked very queer to her it was beautiful and shining and because the sky above it was cloudless the water was a most wonderful blue there was no wind stirring so there were no tiny waves to sparkle and send dancing bits of light here and there it was one of the very hot and still summer days which dragonflies like best a sad look came into the nymphs great eyes as she stood there the pond is beautiful she said but when one looks at it from above it does not seem at all homelike she shook her threecornered head sadly and rubbed her eyes with her forelegs she thought she should miss the happy times in the mud with the other children a virgin dragonfly lighted on the cattail next to hers she knew it was a virgin dragonfly because he had black wings folded over his back and there were shimmering green and blue lights all over his body and wings he was very slender and smaller than she good morning said he are you just up yes said she looking bashfully down at her forefeet she did not know how to behave in the air it was so different from the water couldnt have a finer day said he very glad youve come excuse me there is a friend to whom i must speak then he flew away with another virgin dragonfly hurry up and get your skin changed said a voice above her and there was a fine great fellow floating in the air over her head ill tell you a secret when you do dragonflies care a great deal for secrets so she quickly hooked her twelve sharp claws into the cattail stem and unfastened her old skin down the back and wriggled and twisted and pulled until she had all her six legs and the upper part of her body out this made her very tired and she had to rest for a while the old skin would only open down for a little way by her shoulders and it was hard to get out through such a small place next she folded her legs close to her body and bent over backward and swayed this way and that until she had drawn her long slender body from its outgrown covering she crawled away from the empty skin and looked it over it kept the shape of her body but she was surprised to find how fast she was growing slender even then and she had been out only a short time she was much longer and thinner than she had been and her old skin looked much too short for her how styles do change she said i remember how proud i was of that skin when i first got it and now i wouldnt be seen in it her beautiful gauzy wings with their dark veinings were drying and growing in the sunshine she was weak now and had them folded over her back like those of the virgin dragonfly but as soon as she felt rested and strong she meant to spread them out flat the fine big dragonfly lighted beside her how are your wings said he almost dry she answered joyfully and she quivered them a little to show him how handsome they were well said he ill tell you the secret now and of course you will never speak of it i saw you talking with a virgin dragonfly he may be all right but he isnt really in our set you know and youd better not have anything to do with him thank you she said i wont she thought it very kind in him to tell her he soon flew away and as she took her first flight into the air a second big dragonfly overtook her ill tell you a secret said he if you will never tell i wont said she i saw you talking to a virgin dragonfly a while ago you may have noticed that he folded his wings over his back the big dragonflies never do this and you must never be seen with yours so thank you she said i wont but when they were drying i had to hold them in that way of course said he we all do things then that we wouldnt afterward before long she began egglaying flying low enough to touch her body to the water now and then and drop a single egg this egg always sank at once to the bottom and she took no more care of it a third big dragonfly came up to her i want to tell you something he said put your head close to mine she put her head close to his and he whispered i saw you flying with my cousin a few minutes ago i dislike to say it but he is not a good friend for you whatever you do dont go with him again go with me thank you said she yet she began to wonder what was the matter she saw that just as soon as she visited with anybody somebody else told her that she must not do so again down in the pond they had all been friends she wondered if it could not be so in the air she rubbed her head with her right foreleg and frowned as much as she could you know she couldnt frown very much because her eyes were so large and close together that there was only a small frowningplace left she turned her head to see if any one else was coming to tell her a secret her neck was very very slender and did not show much because the back side of her head was hollow and fitted over her shoulders no other dragonfly was near instead she saw a swallow swooping down on her she sprang lightly into the air and the swallow chased her when he had his beak open to catch her as he flew she would go backward or sidewise without turning around this happened many times and it was well for her that it was so for the swallow was very hungry and if he had caught herwell she certainly would never have told any of the secrets she knew the swallow quite lost his patience and flew away grumbling i wont waste any more time he said on trying to catch somebody who can fly backward without turning around ridiculous way to fly the dragonfly thought it an exceedingly good way however and was even more proud of her wings than she had been legs are all very well she said to herself as far as they go and ones feet would be of very little use without them but i like wings better now that i think of it she added i havent walked a step since i began to fly i understand better the old saying make your wings save your legs they certainly are very good things to stand on when one doesnt care to fly night came and she was glad to sleep on the under side of a broad leaf of pickerelweed she awakened feeling stupid and lazy she could not think what was the matter until she heard her friends talking about the weather then she knew that dragonflies are certain to feel so on dark and wet days i dont see
 what difference that should make she said im not afraid of rain ive always been careless about getting my feet wet and it never hurt me any ugh said one of her friends youve never been wet in spots or hit on one wing by a great raindrop that has fallen clear down from a cloud i had a raindrop hit my second right knee once and it has hurt me ever since i have only five good knees left and i have to be very careful about lighting on slippery leaves it was very dull nobody seemed to care about anybody or anything the fine big dragonflies who had been so polite to her the day before hardly said good morning to her now when she asked them questions they would say nothing but yes or no or i dont know and one of them yawned in her face oh dear she said how i wish myself back in the pond where the rain couldnt wet me id like to see my old friends and some of the dear little larvæ i wish more of the nymphs would come up she looked all around for them and as she did so she saw the shining backshell of the snapping turtle showing above the shallow water i believe ill call on him she said he may tell me something about my old friends and anyway it will cheer me up she lighted very carefully on the middle of his backshell and found it very comfortable good morning said she have you no snapped he i havent and i dont mean to dear me said she that is too bad i dont see why said he is there any particular reason why i should i thought you might have just happened to said she and i should like to know how they are what are you talking about snapped he i was going to ask if you had seen the dragonfly children lately she said and as she spoke she made sure that she could not slip she felt perfectly safe where she was because she knew that no matter how cross he might be he could not reach above the edges of his backshell well why didnt you say so in the first place he snapped instead of sitting there and talking nonsense they are all right a lot of the nymphs are going into the air today now that he had said a few ugly things he began to feel better natured youve changed a good deal since the last time i saw you when was that asked she it was one day when i came remarkably near sitting down on a lot of you dragonfly children he chuckled you were a homely young nymph then and you stuck out your lower lip at me oh said she then you did see us of course i did answered he havent i eyes id have sat down on you too if i hadnt wanted to see you scramble away the larvæ always are full of mischief but then they are young you nymphs were old enough to know better i suppose we were she said i didnt think you saw us why didnt you tell us oh said the snapping turtle i thought id have a secret if i cant keep a secret for myself i know that nobody can keep it for me secrets can swim faster than any fish in the pond if you once let them get away from you i thought id better not tell i might want to sit on you some other time you know youll never have the chance said she with a twinkle in her big eyes it is my turn to sit on you and after that they were very good friendsas long as she sat on the middle of his shell the eels were as different from the clams as people well could be it was not alone that they looked unlike but that they had such different ways of enjoying life the clams were chubby people each comfortably settled in his own shell which he could open or shut as he chose they never wanted to live anywhere else or to get beyond the edges of their own pearllined shells the eels were long slender and slippery people looking even more like snakes than they did like fishes they were always careful to tell new acquaintances though that they were not even related to the snakes to be sure they would say we do not wear our fins like most fishes but that is only a matter of taste after all we should find them dreadfully in the way if we did and that was just like the eelsthey were always so ready to explain everything to their friends they were great talkers they would talk about themselves and their friends and the friends of their friends and the pond and the weather and the state of the mud and what everything was like yesterday and what it would be likely to be like tomorrow and did you really think so and why the wateradder used to say that they were the easiest people in the pond to visit with for all one had to do was to keep still and look very much interested perhaps that may have been why the clams and they were such good friends the clams you know were a quiet family unless a clam was very very much excited he never said more than yes no or indeed they were excellent listeners and some of the most popular people in the pond those who were in trouble told the clams and they would say indeed or ah in such a nice way that their visitor was sure to leave feeling better others who wanted advice would go to them and talk over their plans and tell them what they wanted to do and the clams would say yes and then the visitors would go away quite decided and say we really didnt know what to do until we spoke to the clams about it but they agree with us perfectly the clams were also excellent people to keep secrets and as the eels were forever telling secrets that was all very well mother eel was fussy she even said so herself and if a thing bothered her she would talk and talk and talk until even her own children were tired of hearing about it now she was worrying over the pond water i do not think it nearly so clean as it was last year she said and the mud is getting positively dirty our family are very particular about that and i think we may have to move i do dread the moving though it is so much work with a family the size of mine and mr eel is no help at all with the children she was talking with mother mud turtle when she said this and the little eels were wriggling all around her as she spoke then they began teasing her to go until she told them to swim away at once and play with the young minnows im afraid i shall have to go said she if only on account of the children i want them to see something of the world it is so dull in this pond were you ever out of it she asked turning suddenly to mrs mud turtle oh yes answered she i go quite often and one of my sons took a very long trip to the meadow he went with some boys it was most exciting is that the one with thepeculiar backshell asked mother eel yes replied mother mud turtle sweetly he is very modest and does not care to talk about it much but i am really quite pleased some people travel and show no sign of it afterward one would never know that they had left home mother eel wondered if she meant her but with him it is different he shows marks of having been in the great world outside mother eel wriggled a little uneasily i think i must tell you after all she said i have really made up my mind to go mr eel thinks it foolish and would rather stay here but i am positive that we can find a better place and we must consider the children he thinks he cares as much for them as i do yet he would be willing to have them stay here forever he was hatched here and thinks the pond perfect we get to talking about it sometimes and i say to him mr eel where would those children be now if it were not for me and what does he say then asked the mud turtle mother nothing answered mother eel with a smart little wriggle there is nothing for him to say yes we shall certainly move i am only waiting for the right kind of night it must not be too light or the land people would see us not too dark or we could not see them and then the grass must be dewy it would never do for us to get dry you know or we should all be sick but please dont speak of this dear mrs turtle i would rather leave quietly when the time comes so the mud turtle mother remembered that it was a secret and told nobody except the mud turtle father and he did not speak of it to anybody but the snapping turtle did you say that it was a secret asked the snapping turtle yes said the mud turtle father it is a great secret humph said the snapping turtle then why did you tell me that same day when the stickleback father came to look for nineteen or twenty of his children who were missing mother eel told him about her plans i thought you would be interested in hearing of it she said but i shall not mention it to anybody else you may be sure i shall not speak of it said he and probably he would not have told a person if it had not been that he forgot and talked of it with the snails he also forgot to say that it was a secret and so they spoke freely of it to the crayfishes and the caddis worms the caddis worms were playing with the tadpoles soon after this and one of them whispered to a tadpole right before the others although he knew perfectly well that it was rude for him to do so now dont you ever tell said he aloud uhuh answered the tadpole and everybody knew that he meant no even if they hadnt seen him wave his hindlegs sidewise of course not having the right kind of neck for it he couldnt shake his head then the other tadpoles and caddis worms wanted to tell secrets and they kept whispering to each other and saying out loud now dont you ever tell when a caddis worm told a tadpole anything he said the eels are going to move away and when a tadpole told a secret to a caddis worm he just moved his lips and said sissel sissel sisselsiss im only making believe you know but he was sure to add out loud now dont you tell and the caddis worm would answer uhuh the eel mother also spoke to the biggest frog asking him to watch the grass for her and tell her when it was dewy enough for moving he was afraid he might forget it and so told his sister and asked her to help him remember and she was afraid that she might forget so she spoke to her friend the green brown frog about it the yellow brown frog afterward said that he heard it from her one night it was neither
 too dark nor too light and the dew lay heavy on the grass then mother eel said to her children now stop your wriggling and listen to me every one of you we shall move because the mud here is so dirty you are going out into the great world and i want you to remember everything you feel and see you may never have another chance the little eels were so excited that they couldnt keep still and she had to wait for them to stop wriggling when they were quiet she went on all the eels are goingyour uncles and aunts and cousinsand you children must keep with the older ones be careful where you wriggle to and dont get on anybody elses tail she led the way out of the water and wriggled gracefully up the bank although it was quite steep at that place i came this way she said because i felt more as though this was the way to come she closed her mouth very firmly as she spoke mr eel had thought another way better they had to pass through crowds of pond people to reach the shore for everybody had kept awake and was watching the older ones cried out goodbye we shall miss you and waved their fins or their legs or their tails whichever seemed the handiest the younger ones teased the little eels and tried to hold them back and told them theyd miss lots of fun and that they guessed theyd wish themselves back in the pond again when they got onto the shore the frogs and the mud turtles were there and it was a long time before they could get started on their journey one of the little eels was missing and his mother had to go back for him she found that a mischievous young stickleback had him by the tail when at last they were all together on the bank the eel father said to his wife are you sure that the cranes and fish hawks dont know about our moving because if they did i know she said it would be dreadful if they found out and we have been so late in getting started we shall have to stop at the very first water we find now whether we like it or not she lay still and thought i have a feeling said she that we should go this way so that way they went dragging their yellow bellies over the ground as carefully as they could their dark green backs with their long fringes of back fins hardly showing in the grass it was a good thing that their skin was so fat and thick for sometimes they had to cross rough places that scraped it dreadfully and even rumpled the tiny scales that were in it while their long fringes of belly fins became worn and almost ragged if your scales were on the outside said their father like those of other fishes you wouldnt have many left mother eel was very tired and did not say much her friends began to fear that she was ill at last she spoke i do not see she said how people found out that we were to move you didnt tell anybody said mr eel no indeed said she and she really believed it that was because she had talked so much that she couldnt remember what she did say it is always so with those that talk too much three stickleback mothers and several clams were visiting under the lilypads in the early morning mother eel was also there yes she said i am glad to come back and be among my old friends and the children are happier here as i often tell mr eel there is no place like ones home we had a hard journey but i do not mind that we are rested now and travel does teach people so much i should think you would get dreadfully tired of being in the water all the time i want my children to see the world now they know grass and trees and air and dry ground there are not many children of their age who know more than they we stayed in a brook the one day we were gone so they have felt running water too it was cleani will say that for itbut it was no place for eels and so we came back there is no telling how long she would have kept on talking if she had not been called away as soon as she left the sticklebacks began to talk about her so she thinks we must be tired of staying in the water all the time said one it doesnt tire me nearly so much as it would to go dragging myself over the country wearing out my fins on the ground indeed said a clam to whom she turned as she spoke well ill tell you what i think said another stickleback mother i think that if she didnt care so much for travel herself she would not be dragging her family around to learn grass and trees some night they will be learning owls or men and that will be the end of them i do not believe in it at all said the first speaker i certainly would not want my sons to learn these things for they must grow up to be good nestbuilders and babytenders i have told their fathers particularly to bring them up to be careful housekeepers with my daughters it is different for a long time nobody spoke then a clam said what a difference there is in mothers it quite startled the sticklebacks to hear a clam say so much it showed how interested he was and well he might be the clam who brings up children has to do it alone and be both father and mother to them and of course that is hard work it is hard too because when a little clam is naughty his parent can never say that he takes his naughtiness from any one else and there is a difference in fathers too exclaimed one finelooking stickleback mother i say that a fathers place is by the nest and that if he does his work there well he will not have much time to want to travel or to loaf around by the shore the clams looked at each other and said nothing some people thought that the stickleback mothers were lazy just then a crayfish mother came swimming slowly along stopping often to rest her legs were almost useless there were so many little crayfishes clinging to them now look at her said one stickleback just look at her she laid her eggs at the beginning of last winter and fastened them to her legs said she was so afraid something would happen if she left them and that this was a custom in her family anyway now they have hatched and her children hang on to her in the same way the crayfish mother stopped with a sigh isnt it dreadfully warm said she we havent found it so answered the sticklebacks while the clams murmured no let me take some of your children said one stickleback perhaps carrying them has made you warm and tired the crayfish stuck her tailpaddles into the mud and spread her pinchingclaws in front of her family oh no thank you said she they wont be contented with any one but me that must make it hard for you said another stickleback politely she was thinking how quickly she would shake off the little crayfishes if they were her children it does answered their mother it is hard for i carried the eggs on my legs all through the cold weather and until it was very warm again and now that they are hatched the children hang on with their pinchingclaws still i cant bear to shake them off poor little things she held up first one leg and then another to show off her dangling babies i dont know what will happen to them when i cast my shell said she i shall have to soon for i can hardly breathe in it my sister changed hers some time ago and her new one is getting hard already oh theyll be all right said a stickleback cheerfully their fathers tell me that my children learn remarkably fast how to look out for themselves but my children cant walk yet said the crayfish mother and they dont know how to swim what of that asked a stickleback who was beginning to lose her patience they can learn cant they they have eight legs apiece havent they besides the ones that have pincers isnt that enough to begin on and havent they tailpaddles i suppose so said their mother with a sigh but they dont seem to want to go i must put them to sleep now and try to get a little rest myself for the sun is well up the next night she awakened and remembered what the sticklebacks had said so she thought she would try shaking her children off it is for your own good she said and she waved first one leg and then another when she got four of her legs free and stood on them to shake the other four her children scrambled back to her and took hold again with their strong little pinchingclaws then she gave it up you dear tiny things she said but i do wish you would walk instead of making me carry you we dont want to they cried we dont know how there there said their mother no to be sure you dont the next night though they had to let go for their mother was casting her shell when it was off she lay weak and helpless on the pondbottom and her children lay around her they behaved very badly indeed come here and let me catch hold of you cried one i cant walk said another because i dont know how some of them were so cross that they just lay on their backs and kicked with all their eight feet and screamed i wont try it was dreadful the crayfish mother was too weak to move and when the wise old crayfish came along she spoke to him my children will not walk said she even when i tell them to he knew that it was because when she had told them to do things before she had not made them mind i will see what i can do said he but you must not say a word he walked backward to where they were and kept his face turned toward their mother which was polite of him do you want the eels to find you here he said in his gruffest voice if you dont youd better run what a scrambling there was in one way or another every little crayfish scampered away some went forward some went sidewise and some went backward some didnt keep step with themselves very well at first but they soon found out how even the crossest ones who were lying on their backs flopped over and were off the wise old crayfish turned to their mother it is no trouble to teach tenlegged children to walk said he if you go at it in the right way the little crayfishes soon got together again and while they were talking one of their many aunts came along with all her children hanging to her legs then the little crayfishes who had just learned
 to walk pointed their pinchingclaws at their cousins and said shhh fore id let my mother carry me babies the day after the eels left the pond people talked of nothing else it was not that they were so much missed for the eels you know do not swim around in the daytime they lie quietly in the mud and sleep or talk it is only at night that they are really lively still as the mother mud turtle said they had known that they were there and the mud seemed empty without them the larger people had been sorry to have them go and some of them felt that without the eels awake and stirring the pond was hardly a safe place at night i think it is a good deal safer remarked a minnow who usually said what she thought i have always believed that the eels knew what became of some of my brothers and sisters although of course i do not know why didnt you ask them said a stickleback why replied the minnow if i had gone to the eels and asked them that my other brothers and sisters would soon be wondering what had become of me i have heard some queer things about the eels myself said the stickleback but i have never felt much afraid of them i suppose i am braver because i wear so many of my bones on the outside just then a wise old crayfish came along walking sidewise what do you think about the eels asked the stickleback turning suddenly to him the crayfish stuck his tail into the mud he often did this when he was surprised it seemed to help him think when he had thought for a while he waved his big pinchingclaws and said it would be better for me not to tell what i think i used to live near them this showed that the wise old crayfish had been well brought up and knew he should not say unpleasant things about people if he could help it when there was need of it he could tell unpleasant truths and indeed that very evening he did say what he thought of the eels that was when he was teaching some young crayfishes his pupils their mother had brought up a large family and was not strong she had just cast the shell which she had worn for a year and now she was weak and helpless until the new one should harden on her it is such a bother she said to keep changing ones shell in this way but it is a comfort to think that the new one will last a year when i do get it while their mother was so weak the wise old crayfish amused the children and taught them things which all crayfishes should know every evening they gathered around him some of them swimming to him some walking forward some sidewise and some backward it made no difference to them which way they came they were restless pupils and their teacher could not keep them from looking behind them each one had so many eyes that he could look at the teacher with a few and at the other little crayfishes with a few more and still have a good many eyes left with which to watch the tadpoles these eyes were arranged in two big bunches and unless you looked very closely you might think that they had only two eyes apiece they had good ears and there were also fine smellingbristles growing from their heads the wise old crayfish sometimes said that each of his pupils should sit in a circle of six teachers so that he might be taught on all sides at once that is the way in which children should learn he said all around at once but i do the best i can and i at least teach one side of each this evening the wise old crayfish was very sleepy there had been so much talking and excitement during the day that he had not slept so much as usual and now when he should have been wide awake he felt exceedingly dull and stupid when he tried to walk his eight legs stumbled over each other and the weak way in which he waved his pinchingclaw legs showed how tired he was after he had told his pupils the best way to hold their food with their pinchingclaws and had explained to them how it was chewed by the teeth in their stomachs one mischievous little fellow called out i want to know about the eels my mother would never let me go near them and now theyve moved away and i wont ever see them and i think its just horrid eels my children said their teacher are long slender sharpnosed slippery people with a fringe of fins along their backs and another fringe along their bellies they breathe through very small gillopenings in the backs of their heads they have large mouths and teeth in their mouths and they are always sticking out their lower jaws and how do began the biggest little crayfish ask me that tomorrow said their teacher stretching his eight walking legs and his two pinchingclaw legs and his tail paddles but remember this one thingif you ever see an eel get out of his way dont stop to look at him we wont said one little crayfish who thought it smart to be saucy well look to stop at him all of which meant nothing at all and was only said to annoy his teacher they scrambled away over the pondbottom upsetting snails jiggling the young clams and racing with each other where the bottom was smooth beat you running backward cried the saucy crayfish to the biggest little crayfish and they scampered along backward in the moonlit water there was an old log on the bottom of the pond and they sat on that to rest the biggest little crayfish had beaten i would like to see an eel said he id like to see them running on the land said the saucy one pooh said the biggest one thats all you know they dont run on land well i guess they do replied the saucy one i know as much about it as you do eels swim they dont run said the biggest one guess i know well they dont swim in air said the saucy one thats the stuff that lies on top of the water and the ground and people cant swim in it so there well ive seen the wild ducks swim in it they swim with their legs in the water and with their wings in the air said the biggest one i dont believe it said the saucy one anyhow eels run on land eels swim on land said the biggest one eels run eels swim run swim then the two little crayfishes who had been talking louder and louder and becoming more and more angry glared at each other and jerked their feelers and waved their pinchingclaws in a very very ugly way they did not notice a great green and yellow person swimming gently toward them and they did not know that the eels had come back to live in the old pond again mother eel opened her big mouth very wide on land she said decidedly as she swallowed the biggest little crayfish eels wriggle then she swallowed the saucy crayfish there said she ive stopped that dreadful quarrel and she looked around with a satisfied smile during the warm weather the minks did not come often to the pond then they had to stay nearer home and care for their babies in the winter when food was not so plentiful and their youngest children were old enough to come with them they visited there every day it was not far from their home the minks lived by a waterfall in the river and had burrows in the banks where the young minks stayed until they were large enough to go out into the world then the fathers and mothers were very busy for in each home there were four or five or six children hungry and restless and needing to be taught many things they were related to the weasels who lived up by the farmyard and had the same slender and elegant bodies and short legs as they like the weasels they sometimes climbed trees but that was not often they did most of their hunting in the river swimming with their bodies almost all under water and diving and turning and twisting gracefully and quickly when they hunted on land they could tell by smelling just which way to go for their food the minks were a very dark brown and scattered through their close soft fur were long shining hairs of an even darker shade which made their coats very beautiful indeed the fur was darker on their backs than on the under part of their bodies and their tapering bushy tails were almost black their under jaws were white and they were very proud of them perhaps it was because they had so little white fur that they thought so much of it you know that is often the waywe think most of those things which are scarce or hard to get there was one old mink by the river who had a white tip on his tail and that is something which many people have never seen it is even more uncommon than for minks to have white upper lips and that happens only once in a great while this mink was a bachelor and nobody knew why some people said it was because he was waiting to find a wife with a white tip on her tail yet that could not have been for he was too wise to wait for something which might never happen however it was he lived alone and fished and hunted just for himself he could dive more quickly stay under water longer and hunt by scent better than any other mink round there his fur was sleeker and more shining than that of his friends and it is no wonder that the sisters of his friends thought that he ought to marry when the minks visited together somebody was sure to speak of the bachelors luck they said that whatever he did he was always lucky it is all because of a white tip on his tail they said that makes him lucky the young minks heard their fathers and mothers talking and wished that they had been born with white tips on their tails so that they could be lucky too once the bachelor heard them wishing this and he smiled and showed his beautiful teeth and told them that it was not the tip of his tail but his whole body that made him lucky he did not smile to show his teeth because he was not at all vain he just smiled and showed his teeth there was a family of young minks who lived at the foot of the waterfall where the water splashed and dashed in the way they liked best there were four brothers and two sisters in this family and the brothers were bigger than the sisters as mink brothers always are although they were all the same age one was very much larger than any of the rest
 and so they called him big brother he thought there was never such a fine mink as the bachelor and he used to follow him around and look at the tip on his tail and wish that he was lucky like him he wished to be just like him in every way but one he did not want to be a bachelor the other young minks laughed at big brother and asked him if he thought his tail would turn white if he followed the bachelor long enough big brother stood it very patiently for a while then he snarled at them and showed his teeth without smiling and said he would fight anybody who spoke another word about it minks are very brave and very fierce and never know when to stop if they have begun to fight so after that nobody dared tease big brother by saying anything more about the bachelor sometimes they did look at his tail and smile but they never spoke and he pretended not to know what they meant by it a few days after this the bachelor was caught in a trapa common clumsy wooden trap put together with nails and twine it was not near the river and none of his friends would have found him if big brother had not happened along he could hardly believe what he saw was it possible that a trap had dared to catch a mink with a whitetipped tail then he heard the bachelor groan and he knew that it was so he hurried up to where the trap was cant you get out said he no said the bachelor i cant the best way to get out is not to get inand ive gotten in cant you do something with your lucky tail to make the trap open asked big brother i could do something with my teeth answered the bachelor if they were only where the tip of my tail is why are minks always walking into traps he was trying hard not to be cross but his eyes showed how he felt and that was very cross indeed then big brother became much excited i have good teeth said he tell me what to do if you will help me out said the bachelor i will give you my luck and what shall i do with the tail i have asked the young mink who thought that the bachelor was to give him his whitetipped tail never mind now answered the bachelor and he told the young mink just where to gnaw for a long time there was no sound but that of the young minks teeth on the wood of the trap the bachelor was too brave to groan or make a fuss when he knew there was anybody around to hear big brothers mouth became very sore and his stomach became very empty but still he kept at work he was afraid somebody would come for the trap and the mink in it before he finished now try it said he after he had gnawed for quite a while the bachelor backed out as far as he could but his body stuck in the hole you are rumpling your beautiful fur cried the young mink never mind the fur answered the bachelor i can smooth that down afterward you will have to gnaw a little on this side and he raised one of his hind feet to show where he meant it was a beautiful hindfoot thickly padded and with short partly webbed toes and no hair at all growing between them the claws were short sharp and curved big brother gnawed away now try it said he the bachelor backed carefully out through the opening and stood there looking tired and hungry and very much rumpled you are a fine young mink said he we will get something to eat and then we will see about making you lucky they went to the river bank and had a good dinner the bachelor ate more than big brother for his mouth was not sore but big brother was very happy he thought how handsome he would look with a whitetipped tail and how after he had that he could surely marry whoever he wished it was the custom among his people to want to marry the best looking and strongest indeed it is so among all the pond people and that is one reason why they care so much about being goodlooking it is very hard for a young mink to have the one he loves choose somebody else just because the other fellow has the bushiest tail or the longest fur or the thickest pads on his feet now said the bachelor we will talk about luck we will go to a place where nobody can hear what we say they found such a place and lay down the bachelor rolled over three times and smoothed his fur he was still so tired from being in the trap then he looked at the young mink very sharply so you want my tail said he you said you would give me your luck answered big brother and everybody knows that your luck is in your tail the bachelor smiled what will you do with the tail you have said he i dont know answered big brother you wouldnt want to wear two asked the bachelor oh no answered big brother how that would look well how will you put my tail in place of yours asked the bachelor i dont know answered the young mink but you are so wise that i thought you might know some way he began to feel discouraged and to think that the bachelors offer didnt mean very much after all dont you think said the bachelor slowly dont you think that if you could have my luck you could get along pretty well with your own tail why yes said the young mink who had begun to fear he was not going to get anything yes but how could that be the bachelor smiled again i always tell people said he that my luck is not in my tail and they never believe it i will tell you the secret of my luck and you can have luck like it if you really care enough he looked all around to make sure that nobody was near and he listened very carefully with the two little round ears that were almost hidden in his headfur then he whispered to big brother this is the secret always do everything a little better than anybody else can is that all asked the young mink that is enough answered the bachelor keep trying and trying and trying until you can dive deeper stay under water longer run faster and smell farther than other minks then you will have good luck when theirs is poor you will have plenty to eat when they are hungry you can beat in every fight you can have sleek shining fur when theirs is dull luck is not a matter of whitetipped tails the more the young mink thought about it the happier he became i dont see that i am to have your luck after all said he when i have learned to do everything in the very best way it will be luck of my own of course answered the bachelor then it is a kind of luck that cannot be lost if i carried mine in the tip of my tail somebody might bite it off and leave me unlucky big brother kept the secret and worked until he had learned to be as lucky as the bachelor then he married the person he wanted and she was very very handsome it is said that one of their sons has a whitetipped tail but that may not be so one warm day in winter when some of the pussywillows made a mistake and began to grow because they thought spring had come a party of muskrats were visiting in the marsh beside the pond all around them were their winter houses built of mud and coarse grasses these homes looked like heaps of dried rushes unless one went close to them if one did that he could plainly see what they were and if one happened to be a muskrat and could dive and go into them through their watery doorways he would find under the queer roof of each a warm dry room in which to pass the cold days fine weather said every muskrat to his neighbor couldnt sleep all of such a day as this they spoke in that way you know because they usually sleep in the daytime and are awake at night we wish it would always be warm weather said the young muskrats whats the use of winter hard to tell answered one muskrat who had lived in the marsh longer than the rest hard to tell i know it always gives me a good appetite though then all the muskrats laughed they were a jolly goodnatured company and easy to get along with the other pond people liked them much better than they did their neighbors the minks the wild ducks who nested in the sedges were quite willing that the young muskrats should play with their children and the mud hens were not afraid of them mud hens cannot bear minks they say that when a mud chicken is missing from the nest there is quite sure to be a mink somewhere near with a full stomach and down around the corners of his mouth perhaps if the wild ducks and the mud hens were raising their families in the winter time it might be different for then the muskrats get hungry enough to eat almost anything in spring and summer when they can find fresh grasses and young rushes or a few parsnips carrots and turnips from the farmers fields other animals are quite safe in the winter they live mostly on roots fine day screamed the gulls as they swept through the air pity the frogs dont come out to enjoy it yes great pity chuckled the old muskrat how glad you would be to see them he smiled all around his little mouth and showed his gnawing teeth he knew that the frogs were better off asleep in the mud at the bottom of the pond than they would be sitting in the sunshine with a few hungry gulls above them the turtles were sleeping all winter too in the banks of the pond the eels were lying at the bottom stupid and drowsy and somewhere the wateradders were hidden away dreaming of spring of all the birds who lived by the water only the gulls were there and they were not popular it is true that they helped keep the pond sweet and clean and picked up and carried away many things which made the shore untidy still they were rude and talked too loudly and wore their feathers in such a way that they looked like fine large birds when really they were lean and skinny and small the other pond people said that was just like them always pretending to be more than they really were fifteen young muskrats all brothers and sisters and all born the summer before started off to look at the old home where they were children together that is to say they were not all there at once but there were five born early in the season and when they were old enough to look out for themselves five more came to live in the old nest and when these were old enough
 to leave the nest another five were born it doesnt mean so much to muskrats to be brothers and sisters as it does to some people still they remembered that they were related and they played more with each other than with those young muskrats who were only their cousins or friends their mother was very proud of them and loved to watch them running around on their short legs and to hear them slap their long scaly tails on the water when they dove they had short downy fur almost black on the back soft gray underneath and a reddish brown everywhere else there was very little fur on their tails or on their feet and those parts were black these fifteen children had been fairly well brought up but you can see that their mother had many cares so it is not strange if they sometimes behaved badly in some other families where there were only nine or ten babies all the season they had been brought up more strictly like all young muskrats they were full of fun and there were few pleasanter sights than to see them frolicking on a warm moonlight evening when they looked like brown balls rolling and bounding around on the shore or plunging into the water if they had all been exactly the same age it would have been even pleasanter for the oldest five would put on airs and call the others the children and the next five would call the youngest five babies although they were all well grown there was no chance for the youngest five to call other muskrats babies so when they were warm and well fed and goodnatured they laughed and said who cares when they were cold and hungry they slapped their tails on the ground or on the water and said dont you think youre smart when they got to talking so and their mother heard it she would say now children in such a way that they had to stop their father sometimes slapped them with his tail teasing is not so very bad you know although it is dreadfully silly but when people begin by teasing they sometimes get to saying things in earnesteven really hateful mean things and that was what made the muskrat father and mother stop it whenever they could now the whole fifteen crowded around the old summer home and some of them went in one way and some of them went in another for every muskrats summer house has several burrows leading to it when they reached the old nest at the end all of them tried to get in at once and they pushed each other around with their broad little heads scrambled and clutched and held on with their strong little feet five of them said its our turn first were the oldest and five more said well its our turn next anyway cause were next oldest the others said you might give up to us because were the youngest they pushed and scrambled some more and one of the youngest children said to one of the oldest well i dont care im just as big as you are which was so and the older one answered back well youre not so goodlooking which was also true then part of the brothers and sisters took sides with one and part took sides with the other what had been a lovely frolic became an unpleasant disgraceful quarrel and they said such things as these fore id make such a fuss whos making any more fuss than you are id like to know oh yes youre big enough but youre just as homely as you can be so there quit poking me you slapped your tail on my back im going to tell on you fellows i dare you to wont you catch it though and many more things which were even worse think of it fifteen young muskrats who really loved each other talking like that because they couldnt decide whether the oldest or the youngest or the halfwaybetween brothers and sisters should go first into the old nest and it didnt matter a bit who was oldest or who was youngest and it never would have happened had it not been for their dreadful habit of teasing just as they had become very hot and angry they heard their mothers voice say now children but they were too much excited to mind and they did not stop until their father came and slapped them with his tail then they kept still and listened to their mother she told them that they should leave the place at once and not one of them should even set foot in the old nest suppose somebody had gotten hurt she said this made the young muskrats look very sober for they knew that the muskrat who is hurt in winter never gets well after she had let them think about this for a while she said i shall punish you all for this then there was no quarrel among her children to see who should have the first turnnot at all one young muskrat said arent you going to let us play any more yes said she i shall let you play all the rest of the day but i shall choose the games the oldest five will play mud turtles in winter the next five will play frogs in winter and the youngest five will play snakes in winter the way to play these games is to lie perfectly still in some dark place and not say a word the young muskrats looked at each other sorrowfully they thought it sounded very much the same as being sent to bed for being naughty they did not dare say anything for they knew that although their mother was gentle as muskrats are most of the time she could be very severe so they went away quietly to play what she had told them they must but it was not much fun to play those games when all the others were having a fine time in the sunshine there were nine of the young muskrats who did not tease any after that even the other six were more careful

    THE GNOMIES


    As I lay awake in the white moonlight,
    I heard a sweet singing in the wood--
          'Out of bed,
          Sleepyhead,
          Put your white foot now,
          Here are we,
          'Neath the tree,
          Singing round the root now!'

    I looked out of window in the white moonlight,
    The trees were like snow in the wood--
          'Come away
          Child and play,
          Light wi' the gnomies;
          In a mound,
          Green and round,
          That's where their home is!
          'Honey sweet,
          Curds to eat,
          Cream and frumènty,
          Shells and beads,
          Poppy seeds,
          You shall have plenty.'

    But soon as I stooped in the dim moonlight
    To put on my stocking and my shoe,
    The sweet, sweet singing died sadly away,
    And the light of the morning peep'd through:
    Then instead of the gnomies there came a red robin
    To sing of the buttercups and dew.




    BLUEBELLS


    Where the bluebells and the wind are,
    Fairies in a ring I spied,
    And I heard a little linnet
    Singing near beside.

    Where the primrose and the dew are,
    Soon were sped the fairies all:
    Only now the green turf freshens,
    And the linnets call.




    LOVELOCKS


    I watched the Lady Caroline
    Bind up her dark and beauteous hair;
    Her face was rosy in the glass,
    And 'twixt the coils her hands would pass,
        White in the candleshine.

    Her bottles on the table lay,
    Stoppered yet sweet of violet;
    Her image in the mirror stooped
    To view those locks as lightly looped
        As cherry-boughs in May.

    The snowy night lay dim without,
    I heard the Waits their sweet song sing;
    The window smouldered keen with frost;
    Yet still she twisted, sleeked and tossed
        Her beauteous hair about.




    O DEAR ME!


    Here are crocuses, white, gold, grey!
      'O dear me!' says Marjorie May;
    Flat as a platter the blackberry blows:
      'O dear me!' says Madeleine Rose;
    The leaves are fallen, the swallows flown:
      'O dear me!' says Humphrey John;
    Snow lies thick where all night it fell:
      'O dear me!' says Emmanuel.




    TARTARY


    If I were Lord of Tartary,
      Myself and me alone,
    My bed should be of ivory,
      Of beaten gold my throne;
    And in my court should peacocks flaunt,
    And in my forests tigers haunt,
    And in my pools great fishes slant
      Their fins athwart the sun.

    If I were Lord of Tartary,
      Trumpeters every day
    To all my meals should summon me,
      And in my courtyards bray;
    And in the evenings lamps should shine,
    Yellow as honey, red as wine,
    While harp, and flute, and mandoline,
      Made music sweet and gay.

    If I were Lord of Tartary,
      I'd wear a robe of beads,
    White, and gold, and green they'd be--
      And small, and thick as seeds;
    And ere should wane the morning-star,
    I'd don my robe and scimitar,
    And zebras seven should draw my car
      Through Tartary's dark glades.

    Lord of the fruits of Tartary,
      Her rivers silver-pale!
    Lord of the hills of Tartary,
      Glen, thicket, wood, and dale!
    Her flashing stars, her scented breeze,
    Her trembling lakes, like foamless seas,
    Her bird-delighting citron-trees
      In every purple vale!




    THE BUCKLE


    I had a silver buckle,
    I sewed it on my shoe,
    And 'neath a sprig of mistletoe
    I danced the evening through!

    I had a bunch of cowslips,
    I hid 'em in a grot,
    In case the elves should come by night
    And me remember not.

    I had a yellow riband,
    I tied it in my hair,
    That, walking in the garden,
    The birds might see it there.

    I had a secret laughter,
    I laughed it near the wall:
    Only the ivy and the wind
    May tell of it at all.




    THE HARE


    In the black furrow of a field
    I saw an old witch-hare this night;
    And she cocked her lissome ear,
    And she eyed the moon so bright,
    And she nibbled o' the green;
    And I whispered 'Whsst! witch-hare,'
    Away like a ghostie o'er the field
    She fled, and left the moonlight there.




    BUNCHES OF GRAPES


    'Bunches of grapes,' says Timothy;
    'Pomegranates pink,' says Elaine;
    'A junket of cream and a cranberry tart
      For me,' says Jane.

    'Love-in-a-mist,' says Timothy;
    'Primroses pale,' says Elaine;
    'A nosegay of pinks and mignonette
      For me,' says Jane.

    'Chariots of gold,' says Timothy;
    'Silvery wings,' says Elaine;
    'A bumpity ride in a wagon of hay
      For me,' says Jane.




    JOHN MOULDY


    I spied John Mouldy in his cellar,
    Deep down twenty steps of stone;
    In the dusk he sat a-smiling,
      Smiling there alone.

    He read no book, he snuffed no candle;
    The rats ran in, the rats ran out;
    And far and near, the drip of water
      Went whisp'ring about.

    The dusk was still, with dew a-falling,
    I saw the Dog-star bleak and grim,
    I saw a slim brown rat of Norway
      Creep over him.

    I spied John Mouldy in his cellar,
    Deep down twenty steps of stone;
    In the dusk he sat a-smiling,
      Smiling there alone.




    THE FLY


    How large unto the tiny fly
      Must little things appear!--
    A rosebud like a feather bed,
      Its prickle like a spear;

    A dewdrop like a looking-glass,
      A hair like golden wire;
    The smallest grain of mustard-seed
      As fierce as coals of fire;

    A loaf of bread, a lofty hill;
      A wasp, a cruel leopard;
    And specks of salt as bright to see
      As lambkins to a shepherd.




    SONG


    O for a moon to light me home!
      O for a lanthorn green!
    For those sweet stars the Pleiades,
    That glitter in the twilight trees;
      O for a lovelorn taper! O
      For a lanthorn green!

    O for a frock of tartan!
      O for clear, wild, grey eyes!
    For fingers light as violets,
    'Neath branches that the blackbird frets;
      O for a thistly meadow! O
      For clear, wild grey eyes!

    O for a heart like almond boughs!
      O for sweet thoughts like rain!
    O for first-love like fields of grey,
    Shut April-buds at break of day!
      O for a sleep like music!
      For still dreams like rain!




    I SAW THREE WITCHES


    I saw three witches
    That bowed down like barley,
    And took to their brooms 'neath a louring sky,
    And, mounting a storm-cloud,
    Aloft on its margin,
    Stood black in the silver as up they did fly.

    I saw three witches
    That mocked the poor sparrows
    They carried in cages of wicker along,
    Till a hawk from his eyrie
    Swooped down like an arrow,
    And smote on the cages, and ended their song.

    I saw three witches
    That sailed in a shallop,
    All turning their heads with a truculent smile,
    Till a bank of green osiers
    Concealed their grim faces,
    Though I heard them lamenting for many a mile.

    I saw three witches
    Asleep in a valley,
    Their heads in a row, like stones in a flood,
    Till the moon, creeping upward,
    Looked white through the valley,
    And turned them to bushes in bright scarlet bud.




    THE SILVER PENNY


    'Sailorman, I'll give to you
      My bright silver penny,
    If out to sea you'll sail me
      And my dear sister Jenny.'

    'Get in, young sir, I'll sail ye
      And your dear sister Jenny,
    But pay she shall her golden locks
      Instead of your penny.'

    They sail away, they sail away,
      O fierce the winds blew!
    The foam flew in clouds,
      And dark the night grew!

    And all the wild sea-water
      Climbed steep into the boat;
    Back to the shore again
      Sail they will not.

    Drowned is the sailorman,
      Drowned is sweet Jenny,
    And drowned in the deep sea
      A bright silver penny.




    THE NIGHT-SWANS


    'Tis silence on the enchanted lake,
    And silence in the air serene,
    Save for the beating of her heart,
    The lovely-eyed Evangeline.

    She sings across the waters clear
    And dark with trees and stars between,
    The notes her fairy godmother
    Taught her, the child Evangeline.

    As might the unrippled pool reply,
    Faltering an answer far and sweet,
    Three swans as white as mountain snow
    Swim mantling to her feet.

    And still upon the lake they stay,
    Their eyes black stars in all their snow,
    And softly, in the glassy pool,
    Their feet beat darkly to and fro.

    She rides upon her little boat,
    Her swans swim through the starry sheen,
    Rowing her into Fairyland--
    The lovely-eyed Evangeline.

    'Tis silence on the enchanted lake,
    And silence in the air serene;
    Voices shall call in vain again
    On earth the child Evangeline.

    'Evangeline! Evangeline!'
    Upstairs, downstairs, all in vain.
    Her room is dim; her flowers faded;
    She answers not again.




    THE FAIRIES DANCING


    I heard along the early hills,
    Ere yet the lark was risen up,
    Ere yet the dawn with firelight fills
    The night-dew of the bramble-cup,--
    I heard the fairies in a ring
    Sing as they tripped a lilting round
    Soft as the moon on wavering wing.
    The starlight shook as if with sound,
    As if with echoing, and the stars
    Prankt their bright eyes with trembling gleams;
    While red with war the gusty Mars
    Rained upon earth his ruddy beams.
    He shone alone, adown the West,
    While I, behind a hawthorn-bush,
    Watched on the fairies flaxen-tressed
    The fires of the morning flush.
    Till, as a mist, their beauty died,
    Their singing shrill and fainter grew;
    And daylight tremulous and wide
    Flooded the moorland through and through;
    Till Urdon's copper weathercock
    Was reared in golden flame afar,
    And dim from moonlit dreams awoke
    The towers and groves of Arroar.




    REVERIE


    When slim Sophia mounts her horse
       And paces down the avenue,
    It seems an inward melody
         She paces to.

    Each narrow hoof is lifted high
      Beneath the dark enclust'ring pines,
    A silver ray within his bit
        And bridle shines.

    His eye burns deep, his tail is arched,
      And streams upon the shadowy air,
    The daylight sleeks his jetty flanks,
        His mistress' hair.

    Her habit flows in darkness down,
      Upon the stirrup rests her foot,
    Her brow is lifted, as if earth
        She heeded not.

    'Tis silent in the avenue,
      The sombre pines are mute of song,
    The blue is dark, there moves no breeze
        The boughs among.

    When slim Sophia mounts her horse
      And paces down the avenue,
    It seems an inward melody
        She paces to.




    THE THREE BEGGARS


    'Twas autumn daybreak gold and wild,
      While past St Ann's grey tower they shuffled,
    Three beggars spied a fairy-child
        In crimson mantle muffled.

    The daybreak lighted up her face
      All pink, and sharp, and emerald-eyed;
    She looked on them a little space,
        And shrill as hautboy cried:--

    'O three tall footsore men of rags
      Which walking this gold morn I see,
    What will ye give me from your bags
        For fairy kisses three?'

    The first, that was a reddish man,
      Out of his bundle takes a crust:
    'La, by the tombstones of St Ann,
        There's fee, if fee ye must!'

    The second, that was a chesnut man,
      Out of his bundle draws a bone:
    'La, by the belfry of St Ann,
        And all my breakfast gone!'

    The third, that was a yellow man,
      Out of his bundle picks a groat,
    'La, by the Angel of St Ann,
        And I must go without.'

    That changeling, lean and icy-lipped,
      Touched crust, and bone, and groat, and lo!
    Beneath her finger taper-tipped
        The magic all ran through.

    Instead of crust a peacock pie,
      Instead of bone sweet venison,
    Instead of groat a white lilie
        With seven blooms thereon.

    And each fair cup was deep with wine:
      Such was the changeling's charity,
    The sweet feast was enough for nine,
        But not too much for three.

    O toothsome meat in jelly froze!
      O tender haunch of elfin stag!
    O rich the odour that arose!
        O plump with scraps each bag!

    There, in the daybreak gold and wild,
      Each merry-hearted beggar man
    Drank deep unto the fairy child,
        And blessed the good St Ann.




    THE DWARF


    'Now, Jinnie, my dear, to the dwarf be off,
        That lives in Barberry Wood,
    And fetch me some honey, but be sure you don't laugh,--
      He hates little girls that are rude, are rude,
        He hates little girls that are rude.'

    Jane tapped at the door of the house in the wood,
        And the dwarf looked over the wall,
    He eyed her so queer, 'twas as much as she could
      To keep from laughing at all, at all,
        To keep from laughing at all.

    His shoes down the passage came clod, clod, clod,
        And when he opened the door,
    He croaked so harsh, 'twas as much as she could
      To keep from laughing the more, the more,
        To keep from laughing the more.

    As there, with his bushy red beard, he stood,
        Pricked out to double its size,
    He squinted so cross, 'twas as much as she could
      To keep the tears out of her eyes, her eyes,
        To keep the tears out of her eyes.

    He slammed the door, and went clod, clod, clod,
        But while in the porch she bides,
    He squealed so fierce, 'twas as much as she could
      To keep from cracking her sides, her sides,
        To keep from cracking her sides.

    He threw a pumpkin over the wall,
        And melons and apples beside,
    So thick in the air, that to see 'em all fall,
      She laughed, and laughed, till she cried, cried, cried,
        Jane laughed and laughed till she cried.

    Down fell her teardrops a pit-apat-pat,
        And red as a rose she grew;--
    'Kah! kah!' said the dwarf, 'is it crying you're at?
      It's the very worst thing you could do, do, do,
        It's the very worst thing you could do.'

    He slipped like a monkey up into a tree,
        He shook her down cherries like rain;
    'See now,' says he, cheeping, 'a blackbird I be,
      Laugh, laugh, little Jinnie, again-gain-gain,
        Laugh, laugh, little Jinnie, again.'

    Ah me! what a strange, what a gladsome duet
        From a house i' the deeps of a wood!
    Such shrill and such harsh voices never met yet
      A-laughing as loud as they could-could-could,
        A-laughing as loud as they could.

    Come Jinnie, come dwarf, cocksparrow, and bee,
        There's a ring gaudy-green in the dell,
    Sing, sing, ye sweet cherubs, that flit in the tree;
      La! who can draw tears from a well-well-well,
        Who ever drew tears from a well!




    ALULVAN


    The sun is clear of bird and cloud,
    The grass shines windless, grey, and still,
    In dusky ruin the owl dreams on,
    The cuckoo echoes on the hill;
      Yet soft along Alulvan's walks
        The ghost at noonday stalks.

    His eyes in shadow of his hat
    Stare on the ruins of his house;
    His cloak, up-fasten'd with a brooch,
    Of faded velvet grey as mouse,
      Brushes the roses as he goes:
        Yet wavers not one rose.

    The wild birds in a cloud fly up
    From their sweet feeding in the fruit;
    The droning of the bees and flies
    Rises gradual as a lute;
      Is it for fear the birds are flown,
        And shrills the insect-drone?

    Thick is the ivy o'er Alulvan,
    And crisp with summer-heat its turf;
    Far, far across its empty pastures
    Alulvan's sands are white with surf:
      And he himself is grey as sea,
        Watching beneath an elder-tree.

    All night the fretful, shrill Banshee
    Lurks in the chambers' dark festoons,
    Calling for ever, o'er garden and river,
    Through magpie changing of the moons:
      'Alulvan, O, alas! Alulvan,
        The doom of lone Alulvan!'




    THE PEDLAR


    There came a Pedlar to an evening house;
    Sweet Lettice, from her lattice looking down,
    Wondered what man he was, so curious
    His black hair dangled on his tattered gown:
    Then lifts he up his face, with glittering eyes,--
    'What will you buy, sweetheart?--Here's honeycomb,
    And mottled pippins, and sweet mulberry pies,
    Comfits and peaches, snowy cherry bloom,
    To keep in water for to make night sweet:
    All that you want, sweetheart,--come, taste and eat!'

    Ev'n with his sugared words, returned to her
    The clear remembrance of a gentle voice:--
    'And O! my child, should ever a flatterer
    Tap with his wares, and promise of all joys
    And vain sweet pleasures that on earth may be;
    Seal up your ears, sing some old happy song,
    Confuse his magic who is all mockery:
    His sweets are death.' Yet, still, how she doth long
    But just to taste, then shut the lattice tight,
    And hide her eyes from the delicious sight!

    'What must I pay?' she whispered. 'Pay!' says he,
    'Pedlar I am who through this wood do roam,
    One lock of hair is gold enough for me,
    For apple, peach, comfit, or honeycomb!'
    But from her bough a drowsy squirrel cried,
    'Trust him not, Lettice, trust, oh trust him not!'
    And many another woodland tongue beside
    Rose softly in the silence--'Trust him not!'
    Then cried the Pedlar in a bitter voice,
    'What, in the thicket, is this idle noise?'

    A late, harsh blackbird smote him with her wings,
    As through the glade, dark in the dim, she flew;
    Yet still the Pedlar his old burden sings,--
    'What, pretty sweetheart, shall I show to you?
    Here's orange ribands, here's a string of pearls,
    Here's silk of buttercup and pansy glove,
    A pin of tortoiseshell for windy curls,
    A box of silver, scented sweet with clove:
    Come now,' he says, with dim and lifted face,
    'I pass not often such a lonely place.'

    'Pluck not a hair!' a hidden rabbit cried,
    'With but one hair he'll steal thy heart away,
    Then only sorrow shall thy lattice hide:
    Go in! all honest pedlars come by day.'
    There was dead silence in the drowsy wood;
    'Here's syrup for to lull sweet maids to sleep;
    And bells for dreams, and fairy wine and food
    All day thy heart in happiness to keep';--
    And now she takes the scissors on her thumb,--
    'O, then, no more unto my lattice come!'

    O sad the sound of weeping in the wood!
    Now only night is where the Pedlar was;
    And bleak as frost upon a too-sweet bud
    His magic steals in darkness, O alas!
    Why all the summer doth sweet Lettice pine?
    And, ere the wheat is ripe, why lies her gold
    Hid 'neath fresh new-pluckt sprigs of eglantine?
    Why all the morning hath the cuckoo tolled,
    Sad to and fro in green and secret ways,
    With lonely bells the burden of his days?

    And, in the market-place, what man is this
    Who wears a loop of gold upon his breast,
    Stuck heartwise; and whose glassy flatteries
    Take all the townsfolk ere they go to rest
    Who come to buy and gossip? Doth his eye
    Remember a face lovely in a wood?
    O people! hasten, hasten, do not buy
    His woful wares; the bird of grief doth brood
    There where his heart should be; and far away
    Dew lies on grave-flowers this selfsame day!




    THE GREY WOLF


    'A fagot, a fagot, go fetch for the fire, son!'
      'O, Mother, the wolf looks in at the door!'
    'Cry Shoo! now, cry Shoo! thou fierce grey wolf fly, now;
      Haste thee away, he will fright thee no more.'

    'I ran, O, I ran, but the grey wolf ran faster,
      O, Mother, I cry in the air at thy door,
    Cry Shoo! now, cry Shoo! but his fangs were so cruel,
      Thy son (save his hatchet) thou'lt never see more.'




    THE OGRE


    'Tis moonlight on Trebarwith Vale,
      And moonlight on an Ogre keen,
    Who prowling hungry through the dale
      A lone cottage hath seen.

    Small with thin smoke ascending up
      Three casements and a door:--
    The Ogre eager is to sup,
      And here seems dainty store.

    Sweet as a larder to a mouse,
      So to him staring down,
    Seemed the sweet-windowed moonlit house,
      With jasmine overgrown.

    He snorted, as the billows snort
      In darkness of the night,
    Betwixt his lean locks tawny-swart,
      He glowered on the sight.

    Into the garden sweet with peas
      He put his wooden shoe,
    And bending back the apple trees
      Crept covetously through;

    Then, stooping, with an impious eye
      Stared through the lattice small,
    And spied two children which did lie
      Asleep, against the wall.

    Into their dreams no shadow fell,
      Of his disastrous thumb
    Groping discreet, and gradual,
      Across the quiet room.

    But scarce his nail had scraped the cot
      Wherein these children lay,
    As if his malice were forgot,
      It suddenly did stay.

    For faintly in the ingle-nook
      He heard a cradlesong,
    That rose into his thoughts and woke
      Terror them among.

    For she who in the kitchen sat
      Darning by the fire,
    Guileless of what he would be at,
      Sang sweet as wind or wire:--

    'Lullay, thou little tiny child,
      By-by, lullay, lullie;
    Jesu of glory, meek and mild,
      This night remember ye!

    'Fiend, witch, and goblin, foul and wild,
      He deems 'em smoke to be;
    Lullay, thou little tiny child,
      By-by, lullay, lullie!'

    The Ogre lifted up his eyes
      Into the moon's pale ray,
    And gazed upon her leopard-wise,
      Cruel and clear as day;

    He snarled in gluttony and fear:
      'The wind blows dismally,
    Jesu in storm my lambs be near,
      By-by, lullay, lullie!'

    And like a ravenous beast which sees
      The hunter's icy eye,
    So did this wretch in wrath confess
      Sweet Jesu's mastery.

    He lightly drew his greedy thumb
      From out that casement pale,
    And strode, enormous, swiftly home,
      Whinnying down the dale.




    DAME HICKORY


    'Dame Hickory, Dame Hickory,
    Here's sticks for your fire,
    Furze-twigs, and oak-twigs,
    And beech-twigs, and briar!'
    But when old Dame Hickory came for to see,
    She found 'twas the voice of the false faerie.

    'Dame Hickory, Dame Hickory,
    Here's meat for your broth,
    Goose-flesh, and hare's flesh,
    And pig's trotters both!'
    But when old Dame Hickory came for to see,
    She found 'twas the voice of the false faerie.

    'Dame Hickory, Dame Hickory,
    Here's a wolf at your door,
    His teeth grinning white,
    And his tongue wagging sore!'
    'Nay!' said Dame Hickory, 'ye false faerie!'
    But a wolf 'twas indeed, and famished was he.

    'Dame Hickory, Dame Hickory,
    Here's buds for your tomb,
    Bramble, and lavender,
    And rosemary bloom!'
    'Hush!' said Dame Hickory, 'ye false faerie,
    Ye cry like a wolf, ye do, and trouble poor me.'




    THE PILGRIM


    'Shall we carry now your bundle,
        You old grey man?

    Over hill and over meadow,
    Lighter than an owlet's shadow,
    We will whirl it through the air,
    Through blue regions shrill and bare;

    Shall we carry now your bundle,
        You old grey man?'

    The Pilgrim lifted up his eyes
    And saw three fiends, in the skies,
    Stooping o'er that lonely place
        Evil in form and face.

    'O leave me, leave me, leave me,
        Ye three wild fiends!

    Far it is my feet must wander,
    And my city lieth yonder;
    I must bear my bundle alone,
    Help nor solace suffer none:

    O leave me, leave me, leave me,
        Ye three wild fiends!'

    The fiends stared down with greedy eye,
    Fanning the chill air duskily,
    'Twixt their hoods they stoop and cry:--

    'Shall we smooth the path before you,
        You old grey man?

    Sprinkle it green with gilded showers,
    Strew it o'er with painted flowers?
    Shall we blow sweet airs on it,
    Lure the magpie there to flit?

    Shall we smooth the path before you,
        You old grey man?'

    'O silence, silence, silence!
        Ye three wild fiends!

    Over bog, and fen, and boulder,
    I must bear it on my shoulder,
    Beaten of wind, torn of briar,
    Smitten of rain, parched of fire:

    O silence, silence, silence!
        Ye three wild fiends!'

    It seemed a smoke obscured the air,
    Bright lightning quivered in the gloom,
    And a faint voice of thunder spake
    Far in the lone hill-hollows--'Come!'
    Then half in fury, half in dread,
    The fiends drew closer down and said:--

    'Grey old man but sleep awhile;
        Sad old man!

    Thorn, and dust, and ice, and heat;
    Tarry now, sit down and eat;
    Heat, and ice, and dust, and thorn;
    Stricken, footsore, parched, forlorn,--
    Juice of purple grape shall be
    Youth and solace unto thee.

    With sweet wire and reed we'll haunt you;
    Songs of the valley shall enchant you;
    Rest now, lest this night you die:
    Sweet be now our lullaby:

    'Grey old man, come sleep awhile,
        Stubborn old man!'

    The pilgrim crouches terrified
    At stooping hood, and glassy face,
    Gloating, evil, side by side;
    Terror and hate brood o'er the place;
    He flings his withered hands on high
    With a bitter, breaking cry:--

    'Leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me,
        Ye three wild fiends:
    If I lay me down in slumber,
      Then I lay me down in wrath;
    If I stir not in sweet dreaming,
      Then I wither in my path;
    If I hear sweet voices singing,
        'Tis a demon's lullaby,
    And in "hideous storm and terror"
        Wake but to die!'

    And even while he spake, the sun
    From the sweet hills pierced the gloom,
    Kindling th' affrighted fiends upon.
    Wild flapped their wings, as if in doom,
    He heard a dismal hooting laughter:--

    Nought but a little rain fell after,
    And from the cloud whither they flew
    A storm-sweet lark rose in the blue:
    And his bundle seemed of flowers
        In his solitary hours.




    THE GAGE


    'Lady Jane, O Lady Jane!
    Your hound hath broken bounds again,
      And chased my timorous deer, O;
        If him I see,
        That hour he'll dee;
      My brakes shall be his bier, O.'

    'Lord Aërie, Lord Aërie,
    My hound, I trow, is fleet and free,
      He's welcome to your deer, O;
        Shoot, shoot you may,
        He'll gang his way,
      Your threats we nothing fear, O.'

    He's fetched him in, he's fetched him in,
    Gone all his swiftness, all his din,
      White fang, and glowering eye, O:
        'Here is your beast,
        And now at least
      My herds in peace shall lie, O.'

    "In peace!" my lord, O mark me well!
    For what my jolly hound befell
      You shall sup twenty-fold, O!
        For every tooth
        Of his, i'sooth,
      A stag in pawn I hold, O.

    'Huntsman and horn, huntsman and horn,
    Shall scare your heaths and coverts lorn,
      Braying 'em shrill and clear, O;
        But lone and still
        Shall lift each hill,
      Each valley wan and sere, O.

    'Ride up you may, ride down you may,
    Lonely or trooped, by night or day,
      My hound shall haunt you ever:
        Bird, beast, and game
        Shall dread the same,
      The wild fish of your river.'

    Her cheek is like the angry rose,
    Her eye with wrath and pity flows:
      He gazes fierce and round, O,--
        'Dear Lord!' he says,
        'What loveliness
      To waste upon a hound, O.

    'I'd give my stags, my hills and dales,
    My stormcocks and my nightingales
      To have undone this deed, O;
        For deep beneath
        My heart is death
      Which for her love doth bleed, O.'

    Wanders he up, wanders he down,
    On foot, a-horse, by night and noon:
      His lands are bleak and drear, O;
        Forsook his dales
        Of nightingales,
      Forsook his moors of deer, O.

    Forsook his heart, ah me! of mirth;
    There's nothing lightsome left on earth:
      Only one scene is fain, O,
        Where far remote
        The moonbeams gloat,
      And sleeps the lovely Jane, O.

    Until an eve when lone he went,
    Gnawing his beard in dreariment,
      Lo! from a thicket hidden,
        Lovely as flower
        In April hour,
      Steps forth a form unbidden.

    'Get ye now down, Lord Aërie,
    I'm troubled so I'm like to dee,'
      She cries, 'twixt joy and grief, O;
        'The hound is dead,
        When all is said,
      But love is past belief, O.

    'Nights, nights I've lain your lands to see,
    Forlorn and still--and all for me,
      All for a foolish curse, O;
        Now here am I
        Come out to die,
      To live unlov'd is worse, O!'

    In faith, this lord, in that lone dale,
    Hears now a sweeter nightingale,
      And lairs a tend'rer deer, O;
        His sorrow goes
        Like mountain snows
      In waters sweet and clear, O!

    Let the hound bay in Shadowland,
    Tuning his ear to understand
      What voice hath tamed this Aërie;
        Chafe, chafe he may
        The stag all day,
      And never thirst nor weary.

    Now here he smells, now there he smells,
    Winding his voice along the dells,
      Till grey flows up the morn, O;
        Then hies again
        To Lady Jane,
      No longer now forlorn, O.

    Ay, as it were a bud, did break
    To loveliness for Aërie's sake,
      So she in beauty moving
        Rides at his hand
        Across his land,
      Beloved as well as loving.




    AS LUCY WENT A-WALKING


    As Lucy went a-walking one wintry morning fine,
    There sate three crows upon a bough, and three times three is nine:
    Then 'O!' said Lucy, in the snow, 'it's very plain to see
    A witch has been a-walking in the fields in front of me.'

    Then stept she light and heedfully across the frozen snow,
    And plucked a bunch of elder-twigs that near a pool did grow:
    And, by and by, she comes to seven shadows in one place
    All stretched by seven poplar-trees against the sun's bright face.

    She looks to left, she looks to right, and in the midst she sees
    A little well of water clear and frozen 'neath the trees;
    Then down beside its margent in the crusty snow she kneels,
    And hears a magic belfry a-ringing with sweet bells.

    But when the belfry ceased to sound yet nothing could she see,
    Save only frozen water in the shadow of the tree.
    But presently she lifted up her eyes along the snow,
    And sees a witch in brindled shawl a-frisking to and fro.

    Her shoes were buckled scarlet that capered to and fro,
    And all her rusty locks were wreathed with twisted mistletoe;
    But never a dint, or mark, or print, in the whiteness for to see,
    Though danced she high, though danced she fast, though danced she
        lissomely.

    It seemed 'twas diamonds in the air, or little flakes of frost;
    It seemed 'twas golden smoke around, or sunbeams lightly tost;
    It seemed an elfin music like to reeds and warblers rose:
    'Nay!' Lucy said, 'it is the wind that through the branches flows.'

    And as she peeps, and as she peeps, 'tis no more one, but three,
    And eye of bat, and downy wing of owl within the tree,
    And the bells of that sweet belfry a-pealing as before,
    And now it is not three she sees, and now it is not four.

    'O! who are ye,' sweet Lucy cries, 'that in a dreadful ring,
    All muffled up in brindled shawls, do caper, frisk, and spring?'
    'A witch and witches, one and nine,' they straight to her reply,
    And looked upon her narrowly, with green and needle eye.

    Then Lucy sees in clouds of gold sweet cherry-trees upgrow,
    And bushes of red roses that bloomed above the snow;
    She smells all faint the almond-boughs that blow so wild and fair,
    And doves with milky eyes ascend fluttering in the air.

    Clear flow'rs she sees, like tulip buds, go floating by like birds,
    With wavering tips that warbled sweetly strange enchanted words;
    And as with ropes of amethyst the boughs with lamps were hung,
    And clusters of green emeralds like fruit upon them clung.

    'O witches nine, ye dreadful nine, O witches seven and three!
    Whence come these wondrous things that I this Christmas morning see?'
    But straight, as in a clap, when she of Christmas says the word,
    Here is the snow, and there the sun, but never bloom nor bird;

    Nor warbling flame, nor gloaming-rope of amethyst there shows,
    Nor bunches of green emeralds, nor belfry, well, and rose,
    Nor cloud of gold, nor cherry-tree, nor witch in brindled shawl,
    But like a dream which vanishes, so vanished were they all.

    When Lucy sees, and only sees, three crows upon a bough,
    And earthly twigs, and bushes hidden white in driven snow,
    Then 'O!' said Lucy, 'three times three is nine--I plainly see
    Some witch has been a-walking in the fields in front of me.'




    THE ENGLISHMAN


    I met a sailor in the woods,
      A silver ring wore he,
    His hair hung black, his eyes shone blue,
      And thus he said to me:--

    'What country, say, of this round earth,
      What shore of what salt sea,
    Be this, my son, I wander in,
      And looks so strange to me?'

    Says I, 'O foreign sailorman,
      In England now you be,
    This is her wood, and this her sky,
      And that her roaring sea.'

    He lifts his voice yet louder,
      'What smell be this,' says he,
    'My nose on the sharp morning air
      Snuffs up so greedily?'

    Says I, 'It is wild roses
      Do smell so winsomely,
    And winy briar too,' says I,
      'That in these thickets be.'

    'And oh!' says he, 'what leetle bird
      Is singing in yon high tree,
    So every shrill and long-drawn note
      Like bubbles breaks in me?'

    Says I, 'It is the mavis
      That perches in the tree,
    And sings so shrill, and sings so sweet,
      When dawn comes up the sea.'

    At which he fell a-musing,
      And fixed his eye on me,
    As one alone 'twixt light and dark
      A spirit thinks to see

    'England!' he whispers soft and harsh,
      'England!' repeated he,
    'And briar, and rose, and mavis,
      A-singing in yon high tree.

    'Ye speak me true, my leetle son,
      So--so, it came to me,
    A-drifting landwards on a spar,
      And grey dawn on the sea.

    'Ay, ay, I could not be mistook;
      I knew them leafy trees,
    I knew that land so witcherie sweet,
      And that old noise of seas.

    'Though here I've sailed a score of years,
      And heard 'em, dream or wake,
    Lap small and hollow 'gainst my cheek,
      On sand and coral break;

    '"Yet now, my leetle son," says I,
      A-drifting on the wave,
    "That land I see so safe and green
      Is England, I believe.

    '"And that there wood is English wood,
      And this here cruel sea,
    The selfsame old blue ocean
      Years gone remembers me,

    "A-sitting with my bread and butter
      Down ahind yon chitterin' mill;
    And this same Marinere"--(that's me),
      "Is that same leetle Will!--

    "That very same wee leetle Will
      Eating his bread and butter there,
    A-looking on the broad blue sea
      Betwixt his yaller hair!"

    'And here be I, my son, throwed up
      Like corpses from the sea,
    Ships, stars, winds, tempests, pirates past,
      Yet leetle Will I be!'

    He said no more, that sailorman,
      But in a reverie
    Stared like the figure of a ship
      With painted eyes to sea.




    THE PHANTOM


    'Upstairs in the large closet, child,
      This side the blue-room door,
    Is an old Bible, bound in leather,
      Standing upon the floor;

    'Go with this taper, bring it me;
      Carry it on your arm;
    It is the book on many a sea
      Hath stilled the waves' alarm.'

    Late the hour, dark the night,
      The house is solitary,
    Feeble is a taper's light
      To light poor Ann to see.

    Her eyes are yet with visions bright
      Of sylph and river, flower and fay,
    Now through a narrow corridor
      She takes her lonely way.

    Vast shadows on the heedless walls
      Gigantic loom, stoop low:
    Each little hasty footfall calls
      Hollowly to and fro.

    In the dim solitude her heart
      Remembers tearlessly
    White winters when her mother was
      Her loving company.

    Now in the dark clear glass she sees
      A taper mocking hers,--
    A phantom face of light blue eyes,
      Reflecting phantom fears.

    Around her loom the vacant rooms,
      Wind the upward stairs,
    She climbs on into a loneliness
      Only her taper shares.

    Her grandmother is deaf with age;
      A garden of moonless trees
    Would answer not though she should cry
      In anguish on her knees.

    So that she scarcely heeds--so fast
      Her pent-up heart doth beat--
    When, faint along the corridor,
      Falleth the sound of feet:--

    Sounds lighter than silk slippers make
      Upon a ballroom floor, when sweet
    Violin and 'cello wake
      Music for twirling feet.

    O! in an old unfriendly house,
      What shapes may not conceal
    Their faces in the open day,
      At night abroad to steal?

    Even her taper seems with fear
      To languish small and blue;
    Far in the woods the winter wind
      Runs whistling through.

    A dreadful cold plucks at each hair,
      Her mouth is stretched to cry,
    But sudden, with a gush of joy,
      It narrows to a sigh.

    It is a wilding child which comes
      Swift through the corridor,
    Singing an old forgotten song,
      This ancient burden bore:--

    'Thorn, thorn, I wis,
    And roses twain,
      A red rose and a white,
    Stoop in the blossom, bee, and kiss
      A lonely child good-night.

    'Swim fish, sing bird,
    And sigh again,
      I that am lost am lone,
    Bee in the blossom never stirred
      Locks hid beneath a stone!'--

    Her eye was of the azure fire
      That hovers in wintry flame;
    Her raiment wild and yellow as furze
      That spouteth out the same;

    And in her hand she bore no flower,
      But on her head a wreath
    Of faded flag-flowers that did yet
      Smell sweetly after death.

    Clear was the light of loveliness
      That lit her face like rain;
    And sad the mouth that uttered
      Her immemorial strain.

        *     *     *     *

    Gloomy with night the corridor
      Is now that she is gone,
    Albeit this solitary child
      No longer seems alone.

    Fast though her taper dwindles down,
      Heavy and thick the tome,
    A beauty beyond fear to dim
      Haunts now her alien home.

    Ghosts in the world malignant, grim,
      Vex many a wood, and glen,
    And house, and pool,--the unquiet ghosts
      Of dead and restless men.

    But in her grannie's house this spirit--
      A child as lone as she--
    Pining for love not found on earth,
      Ann dreams again to see.

    Seated upon her tapestry-stool,
      Her fairy-book laid by,
    She gazes in the fire, knowing
      She hath sweet company.




    THE MILLER AND HIS SON


    A twangling harp for Mary,
      A silvery flute for John,
    And now we'll play the livelong day,
      'The Miller and his Son.'

    'The Miller went a-walking
      All in the forest high,
    He sees three doves a-flitting
      Against the dark blue sky:

    'Says he, "My son, now follow
      These doves so white and free,
    That cry above the forest,
      And surely cry to thee."

    "I go, my dearest Father,
      But O! I sadly fear,
    These doves so white will lead me far,
      But never bring me near."

    'He kisses the Miller,
      He cries, "Awhoop to ye!"
    And straightway through the forest
      Follows the wood-doves three.

    'There came a sound of weeping
      To the Miller in his Mill;
    Red roses in a thicket
      Bloomed over near his wheel;

    'Three stars shone wild and brightly
      Above the forest dim:
    But never his dearest son
      Returns again to him.

    'The cuckoo shall call "Cuckoo!"
      In vain along the vale,
    The linnet, and the blackbird,
      The mournful nightingale;

    'The Miller hears and sees not,
      A-thinking of his son;
    His toppling wheel is silent;
      His grinding done.

    '"Ye doves so white," he weepeth,
      "Ye roses on the tree,
    Ye stars that shine so brightly,
      Ye shine in vain for me!"

    'I bade him follow, follow,
      He said, "O Father dear,
    These doves so white will lead me far
      But never bring me near!"'

    A twangling harp for Mary,
      A silvery flute for John,
    And now we'll play the livelong day,
      'The Miller and his Son.'




    DOWN-ADOWN-DERRY


    Down-adown-derry,
    Sweet Annie Maroon,
    Gathering daisies
    In the meadows of Doone,
    Sees a white fairy
    Skip buxom and free
    Where the waters go brawling
    In rills to the sea;
        Singing down-adown-derry.

    Down-adown-derry,
    Sweet Annie Maroon
    Through the green grasses
    Runs fleetly and soon,
    And lo! on a lily
    She sees one recline
    Whose eyes in her wee face
    Like the water-sparks shine;
        Singing down-adown-derry.

    Down-adown-derry,
    And shrill was her tune:--
    'Come to my water-house,
    Annie Maroon,
    Come in your pink gown,
    Your curls on your head,
    To wear the white samite
    And rubies instead';
        Singing down-adown-derry.

    'Down-adown-derry,
    Lean fish of the sea,
    Bring lanthorns for feasting
    The gay Faërie;
    And it's dancing on sand 'tis
    That's smoother than wool;--
    Foam-fruit and wild honey
    To pleasure you full';
        Singing down-adown-derry.

    Down-adown-derry,
    Sweet Annie Maroon
    Looked large on the fairy
    Curled wan as the moon;
    And all the grey ripples
    To the Mill racing by,
    With harps and with timbrels
    Did ringing reply;
        Singing down-adown-derry.

    'Down-adown-derry,'
    Sang the Fairy of Doone,
    Piercing the heart of
    Sweet Annie Maroon;
    And lo! when like roses
    The clouds of the sun
    Faded at dusk, gone
    Was Annie Maroon;
        Singing down-adown-derry.

    Down-adown-derry,
    The daisies are few;
    Frost twinkles powd'ry
    In haunts of the dew;
    Only the robin
    Perched on a white thorn,
    Can comfort the heart of
    A father forlorn;
        Singing down-adown-derry.

    Down-adown-derry,
    There's snow in the air;
    Ice where the lily
    Bloomed waxen and fair;
    He may call o'er the water,
    Cry--cry through the Mill,
    But Annie Maroon, alas!
    Answer ne'er will;
        Singing down-adown-derry.




    THE SUPPER


    A wolf he pricks with eyes of fire
    Across the night's o'ercrusted snows,
        Seeking his prey,
        He pads his way
    Where Jane benighted goes,
      Where Jane benighted goes.

    He curdles the bleak air with ire,
    Ruffling his hoary raiment through,
        And lo! he sees
        Beneath the trees
    Where Jane's light footsteps go,
      Where Jane's light footsteps go.

    No hound peals thus in wicked joy,
    He snaps his muzzle in the snows,
        His five-clawed feet
        Do scamper fleet
    Where Jane's bright lanthorn shows,
      Where Jane's bright lanthorn shows.

    Now his greed's green doth gaze unseen
    On a pure face of wilding rose,
        Her amber eyes
        In fear's surprise
    Watch largely as she goes,
      Watch largely as she goes.

    Salt wells his hunger in his jaws,
    His lust it revels to and fro,
        Yet small beneath
        A soft voice saith,
    'Jane shall in safety go,
      Jane shall in safety go.'

    He lurched as if a fiery lash
    Had scourged his hide, and through and through,
        His furious eyes
        O'erscanned the skies,
    But nearer dared not go,
      But nearer dared not go.

    He reared like wild Bucephalus,
    His fangs like spears in him uprose,
        Ev'n to the town
        Jane's flitting gown
    He grins on as she goes,
      He grins on as she goes.

    In fierce lament he howls amain,
    He scampers, marvelling in his throes
        What brought him there
        To sup on air,
    While Jane unarmèd goes,
      While Jane unarmèd goes.




    THE ISLE OF LONE


    Three dwarfs there were which lived on an isle,
      And the name of the isle was Lone,
    And the names of the dwarfs were Alliolyle,
      Lallerie, Muziomone.

    Alliolyle was green of een,
      Lallerie light of locks,
    Muziomone was mild of mien,
      As ewes in April flocks.

    Their house was small and sweet of the sea,
      And pale as the Malmsey wine;
    Their bowls were three, and their beds were three,
      And their nightcaps white were nine.

    Their beds were of the holly-wood,
      Their combs of the tortoiseshell,
    Their mirrors clear as wintry flood,
      Frozen dark and snell.

    So each would lie on his plumpy pillow,
      The moon for company,
    And hear the parrot scream to the billow,
      And the billow roar reply.--

    Sulphur parrots, and parrots red,
      Scarlet, and flame, and green;
    And five-foot apes that jargonèd
      In feathery-tufted treen.

    And oh, or ever the dawning shed
      On dreams a narrow flame,
    Three gaping dwarfs gat out of bed
      And gazed upon the same.

    At dawn they fished, at noon they snared
      Young foxes in the dells,
    At even on dew-berries they fared,
      And blew in their twisted shells.

    Dark was the sea they gambolled in,
      And thick with silver fish,
    Dark as green glass blown clear and thin
      To be a monarch's dish.

    They sate to sup in a jasmine bower,
      Lit pale with flies of fire,
    Their bowls the hue of the iris-flower,
      And lemon their attire.

    Sweet wine in little cups they sipped,
      And golden honeycomb
    Into their bowls of cream they dipped,
      Whipt light and white as foam.

    Alliolyle, where the salt sea flows,
      Taught three old apes to sing,
    And there to the moon, like a full-blown rose,
      They capered in a ring.

    But down to the shore skipped Lallerie,
      His parrot on his thumb,
    And the twain they scritched in mockery,
      While the dancers go and come.

    So, alas! in the evening, rosy and still,
      Light-haired Lallerie
    Bitterly quarrelled with Alliolyle
      By the yellow-sanded sea.

    The rising moon swam sweet and large
      Before their furious eyes,
    And they rolled and rolled to the coral marge
      Where the surf for ever cries.

    Too late, too late, comes Muziomone:
      Clear in the clear green sea
    Alliolyle lies not alone,
      But clasped with Lallerie.

    He blows on his shell plaintive notes;
      Ape, parraquito, bee
    Flock where a shoe on the salt wave floats,--
      The shoe of Lallerie.

    He fetches nightcaps, one and nine,
      Grey apes he dowers three,
    His house as fair as the Malmsey wine
      Seems sad as cypress-tree.

    Three bowls he brims with honeycomb
      To feast the bumble bees,
    Saying, 'O bees, be this your home,
      For grief is on the seas!'

    He sate him lone in a coral grot,
      At the flowing of the tide;
    When ebbed the billow, there was not,
      Save coral, aught beside.

    So hairy apes in three white beds,
      And nightcaps, one and nine,
    On moonlit pillows lay three heads
      Bemused with dwarfish wine.

    A tomb of coral, the dirge of bee,
      The grey apes' guttural groan
    For Alliolyle, for Lallerie,
      For thee, O Muziomone!




    THE SLEEPING BEAUTY


    The scent of bramble sweets the air,
      Amid her folded sheets she lies,
    The gold of evening in her hair,
      The blue of morn shut in her eyes.

    How many a changing moon hath lit
      The unchanging roses of her face!
    Her mirror ever broods on it
      In silver stillness of the days.

    Oft flits the moth on filmy wings
      Into his solitary lair;
    Shrill evensong the cricket sings
      From some still shadow in her hair.

    In heat, in snow, in wind, in flood,
      She sleeps in lovely loneliness,
    Half folded like an April bud
      On winter-haunted trees.




    THE HORN


    Hark! is that a horn I hear,
      In cloudland winding sweet--
    And bell-like clash of bridle-rein,
      And silver-shod light feet?

    Is it the elfin laughter of
      Fairies riding faint and high,
    'Neath the branches of the moon,
      Straying through the starry sky?

    Is it in the globèd dew
      Such sweet melodies may fall?
    Wood and valley--all are still,
      Hushed the shepherd's call.

    Hark! is that a horn I hear
      In cloudland winding sweet?
    Or gloomy goblins marching out
      Their captain Puck to greet?




    CAPTAIN LEAN


    Out of the East a hurricane
      Swept down on Captain Lean--
    That mariner and gentleman
      Will ne'er again be seen.

    He sailed his ship against the foes
      Of his own country dear,
    But now in the trough of the billows
      An aimless course doth steer.

    Powder was violets to his nostril,
      Sweet the din of the fighting-line,
    Now he is flotsam on the seas,
      And his bones are bleached with brine.

    The stars move up along the sky,
      The moon she shines so bright,
    And in that solitude the foam
      Sparkles unearthly white.

    This is the tomb of Captain Lean,
      Would a straiter please his soul?
    I trow he sleeps in peace,
      Howsoever the billows roll!




    THE PORTRAIT OF A WARRIOR


    His brow is seamed with line and scar;
      His cheek is red and dark as wine;
    The fires as of a Northern star
      Beneath his cap of sable shine.

    His right hand, bared of leathern glove,
      Hangs open like an iron gin,
    You stoop to see his pulses move,
      To hear the blood sweep out and in.

    He looks some king, so solitary
      In earnest thought he seems to stand,
    As if across a lonely sea
      He gazed impatient of the land.

    Out of the noisy centuries
      The foolish and the fearful fade;
    Yet burn unquenched these warrior eyes,
      Time hath not dimmed nor death dismayed.




    HAUNTED


    From out the wood I watched them shine,--
      The windows of the haunted house,
    Now ruddy as enchanted wine,
      Now dim as flittermouse.

    There went a thin voice piping airs
      Along the grey and crooked walks,--
    A garden of thistledown and tares,
      Bright leaves, and giant stalks.

    The twilight rain shone at its gates,
      Where long-leaved grass in shadow grew;
    And black in silence to her mates
      A voiceless raven flew.

    Lichen and moss the lone stones greened,
      Green paths led lightly to its door,
    Keen from her lair the spider leaned,
      And dusk to darkness wore.

    Amidst the sedge a whisper ran,
      The West shut down a heavy eye,
    And like last tapers, few and wan,
      The watch-stars kindled in the sky.




    THE RAVEN'S TOMB


    'Build me my tomb,' the Raven said,
    'Within the dark yew-tree,
    So in the Autumn yewberries
    Sad lamps may burn for me.
    Summon the haunted beetle,
    From twilight bud and bloom,
    To drone a gloomy dirge for me
    At dusk above my tomb.
    Beseech ye too the glowworm
    To bear her cloudy flame,
    Where the small, flickering bats resort,
    Whistling in tears my name.
    Let the round dew a whisper make,
    Welling on twig and thorn;
    And only the grey cock at night
    Call through his silver horn.
    And you, dear sisters, don your black
    For ever and a day,
    To show how sweet a raven
    In his tomb is laid away.'




    THE CHRISTENING


    The bells chime clear,
    Soon will the sun behind the hills sink down;
    Come, little Ann, your baby brother dear
    Lies in his christening-gown.

    His godparents
    Are all across the fields stepped on before,
    And wait beneath the crumbling monuments,
    This side the old church door.

    Your mammie dear
    Leans frail and lovely on your daddie's arm;
    Watching her chick, 'twixt happiness and fear,
    Lest he should come to harm.

    All to be blest
    Full soon in the clear heavenly water, he
    Sleeps on unwitting of't, his little breast
    Heaving so tenderly.

    I carried you,
    My little Ann, long since on this same quest,
    And from the painted windows a pale hue
    Lit golden on your breast;

    And then you woke,
    Chill as the holy water trickled down,
    And, weeping, cast the window a strange look,
    Half smile, half infant frown.

    I scarce could hear
    The larks a-singing in the green meadows,
    'Twas summertide, and budding far and near
    The hedges thick with rose.

    And now you're grown
    A little girl, and this same helpless mite
    Is come like such another bud half-blown,
    Out of the wintry night.

    Time flies, time flies!
    And yet, bless me! 'tis little changed am I;
    May Jesu keep from tears those infant eyes,
    Be love their lullaby!




    THE MOTHER BIRD


    Through the green twilight of a hedge
    I peered, with cheek on the cool leaves pressed,
    And spied a bird upon a nest:
    Two eyes she had beseeching me
    Meekly and brave, and her brown breast
    Throbb'd hot and quick above her heart;
    And then she oped her dagger bill,--
    'Twas not a chirp, as sparrows pipe
    At break of day; 'twas not a trill,
    As falters through the quiet even;
    But one sharp solitary note,
    One desperate, fierce, and vivid cry
    Of valiant tears, and hopeless joy,
    One passionate note of victory:
    Off, like a fool afraid, I sneaked,
    Smiling the smile the fool smiles best,
    At the mother bird in the secret hedge
    Patient upon her lonely nest.




    THE CHILD IN THE STORY GOES TO BED


    I prythee, Nurse, come smooth my hair,
      And prythee, Nurse, unloose my shoe,
    And trimly turn my silken sheet
      Upon my quilt of gentle blue.

    My pillow sweet of lavender
      Smooth with an amiable hand,
    And may the dark pass peacefully by
      As in the hour-glass droops the sand.

    Prepare my cornered manchet sweet,
      And in my little crystal cup
    Pour out the blithe and flowering mead
      That forthwith I may sup.

    Withdraw my curtains from the night,
      And let the crispèd crescent shine
    Upon my eyelids while I sleep,
      And soothe me with her beams benign.

    From far-away there streams the singing
      Of the mellifluent nightingale,--
    Surely if goblins hear her lay,
      They shall not o'er my peace prevail.

    Now quench my silver lamp, prythee,
      And bid the harpers harp that tune
    Fairies which haunt the meadowlands
      Sing clearly to the stars of June.

    And bid them play, though I in dreams
      No longer heed their pining strains,
    For I would not to silence wake
      When slumber o'er my senses wanes.

    You Angels bright who me defend,
      Enshadow me with curvèd wing,
    And keep me in the darksome night
      Till dawn another day do bring.




    THE CHILD IN THE STORY AWAKES


    The light of dawn rose on my dreams,
      And from afar I seemed to hear
    In sleep the mellow blackbird call
      Hollow and sweet and clear.

    I prythee, Nurse, my casement open,
      Wildly the garden peals with singing,
    And hooting through the dewy pines
      The goblins all are winging.

    O listen the droning of the bees,
      That in the roses take delight!
    And see a cloud stays in the blue
      Like an angel still and bright.

    The gentle sky is spread like silk,
      And, Nurse, the moon doth languish there,
    As if it were a perfect jewel
      In the morning's soft-spun hair.

    The greyness of the distant hills
      Is silvered in the lucid East,
    See, now the sheeny-plumèd cock
      Wags haughtily his crest.

    'O come you out, O come you out,
      Lily, and lavender, and lime;
    The kingcup swings his golden bell,
      And plumpy cherries drum the time.

    'O come you out, O come you out!
      Roses, and dew, and mignonette,
    The sun is in the steep blue sky,
      Sweetly the morning star is set.'




    THE LAMPLIGHTER


    When the light of day declineth,
    And a swift angel through the sky
    Kindleth God's tapers clear,
    With ashen staff the lamplighter
    Passeth along the darkling streets
    To light our earthly lamps;

    Lest, prowling in the darkness,
    The thief should haunt with quiet tread,
    Or men on evil errands set;
    Or wayfarers be benighted;
    Or neighbours bent from house to house
    Should need a guiding torch.

    He is like a needlewoman
    Who deftly on a sable hem
    Stitches in gleaming jewels;
    Or, haply, he is like a hero,
    Whose bright deeds on the long journey
    Are beacons on our way.

    And when in the East cometh morning,
    And the broad splendour of the sun,
    Then, with the tune of little birds
    Ringing on high, the lamplighter
    Passeth by each quiet house,
    And putteth out the lamps.




    CECIL


    Ye little elves, who haunt sweet dells,
    Where flowers with the dew commune,
    I pray you hush the child, Cecil,
        With windlike song.

    O little elves, so white she lieth,
    Each eyelid gentler than the flow'r
    Of the bramble, and her fleecy hair
        Like smoke of gold.

    O little elves, her hands and feet
    The angels muse upon, and God
    Hath shut a glimpse of Paradise
        In each blue eye.

    O little elves, her tiny body
    Like a white flake of snow it is,
    Drooping upon the pale green hood
        Of the chill snowdrop.

    O little elves, with elderflower,
    And pimpernel, and the white hawthorn,
    Sprinkle the journey of her dreams:
        And, little elves,

    Call to her magically sweet,
    Lest of her very tenderness
    She do forsake this rough brown earth
        And return to us no more.




    I MET AT EVE


    I met at eve the Prince of Sleep,
    His was a still and lovely face,
    He wandered through a valley steep
      Lovely in a lonely place.

    His garb was grey of lavender,
    About his brows a poppy-wreath
    Burned like dim coals, and everywhere
      The air was sweeter for his breath.

    His twilight feet no sandals wore,
    His eyes shone faint in their own flame,
    Fair moths that gloomed his steps before
      Seemed letters of his lovely name.

    His house is in the mountain ways,
    A phantom house of misty walls,
    Whose golden flocks at evening graze,
      And witch the moon with muffled calls.

    Upwelling from his shadowy springs
    Sweet waters shake a trembling sound,
    There flit the hoot-owl's silent wings,
      There hath his web the silkworm wound.

    Dark in his pools clear visions lurk,
    And rosy, as with morning buds,
    Along his dales of broom and birk
      Dreams haunt his solitary woods.

    I met at eve the Prince of Sleep,
    His was a still and lovely face,
    He wandered through a valley steep,
      Lovely in a lonely place.




    LULLABY


    Sleep, sleep, lovely white soul!
    The singing mouse sings plaintively,
    The sweet night-bird in the chesnut-tree--
    They sing together, bird and mouse,
    In starlight, in darkness, lonely, sweet,
    The wild notes and the faint notes meet--
      Sleep, sleep, lovely white soul!

    Sleep, sleep, lovely white soul!
    Amid the lilies floats the moth,
    The mole along his galleries goeth
    In the dark earth; the summer moon
    Looks like a shepherd through the pane
    Seeking his feeble lamb again--
      Sleep, sleep, lovely white soul!

    Sleep, sleep, lovely white soul!
    Time comes to keep night-watch with thee
    Nodding with roses; and the sea
    Saith 'Peace! Peace!' amid his foam
    White as thy night-clothes; 'O be still!'
    The wind cries up the whisp'ring hill--
      Sleep, sleep, lovely white soul!




    ENVOY


    There clung three roses to a stem,
    Did all their hues of summer don,
    But came a wind and troubled them,
      And all were gone.

    I heard three bells in unison
    Clap out some transient heart's delight,
    Time and the hour brought silence on
      And the dark night.

    Doth not Orion even set!
    O love, love, prove true alone,
    Till youthful hearts ev'n love forget,
      Then, child, begone!


my dear little friends you can never guess how much i have enjoyed writing these stories of the nighttime and i must tell you how i first came to think of doing so i once knew a girland she was not a very little girl eitherwho was afraid of the dark and i have known three boys who were as brave as could be by daylight but who would not run on an errand alone after the lamps were lighted they never seemed to think what a beautiful restful growing time the night is for plants and animals and even for themselves i thought that if they knew more of what happens between sunset and sunrise they would love the night as well as i it may be that you will never see bats flying freely or find the owls flapping silently among the trees without touching even a twig perhaps while these things are happening you must be snugly tucked in bed but that is no reason why you should not be told what they do while you are dreaming before this you know i have told you more of what is done by daylight in meadow forest farmyard and pond it would be a very queer world if we could not know about things without seeing them for ourselves and you may like to think when you are going to sleep that hundreds and thousands of tiny outofdoor people are turning and stretching and going to find their food in the morning when you are dressing in your sunshiny rooms they are cuddling down for a good days rest i think i ought to tell you that i have not been alone when writing these stories i have often been in the meadow and the forest at night and have seen and heard many interesting things but my good cat silvertip has known far more than i of the nightdoings of the outofdoor people he has been beside me at my desk and although at times he has shut his eyes and taken catnaps while i wrote there have been many other times when he has taken the pen right out of my hand he has even tried running the typewriter with his dainty white paws and he has gone over every story i have written i do not say that he has written any himself but you can see that he has been very careful what i wrote and i have learned a great deal from him that i never knew before he is a very good and clever cat and if you like these stories i am sure it must be partly because he had a paw in the writing of them when the speckled hen wanted to sit there was no use in trying to talk her out of the idea for she was a very set hen so after the farmers wife had worked and worked and barred her out of first one nestingplace and then another she gave up to the speckled hen and fixed her a fine nest and put thirteen eggs into it they were black spanish eggs but the speckled hen did not know that the hens that had laid them could not bear to sit so unless some other hen did the work which they left undone there would have been no black spanish chickens this is always their way and people have grown used to it now nobody thinks of asking a black spanish hen to sit although it does not seem right that a hen should be unwilling to bring up chickens supposing nobody had been willing to bring her up still the black spanish hens talk very reasonably about it we will lay plenty of eggs they say but some of the common hens must hatch them they do their share of the farmyard work only they insist on choosing what that share shall be when the speckled hen came off the nest with eleven black chickens two of the eggs did not hatch she was not altogether happy i wanted them to be speckled said she and not one of the whole brood is that was why she grew so restless and discontented in her coop although it was roomy and clean and she had plenty given her to eat and drink she was quite happy only when they were safely under her wings at night and such a time as they always had getting settled when the sunbeams came more and more slantingly through the trees the chickens felt less and less like running around their tiny legs were tired and they liked to cuddle down on the grass in the shadow of the coop then the speckled hen often clucked to them to come in and rest but they liked it better in the open air the speckled hen would also have liked to be out of the coop yet the farmer kept her in he knew what was best for hens with little chickens and also what was best for the tender young lettuce and radishes in his garden when the sun was nearly down the speckled hen clucked her cometobed cluck which was quite different from her food cluck or her hawk cluck and the little black chickens ran between the bars and crawled under her feathers then the speckled hen began to look fatter and fatter and fatter for each chicken who nestled beneath her sometimes one little fellow would scramble up on to her back and stand there while she turned her head from side to side looking at him with first one and then the other of her round yellow eyes and scolding him all the time it never did any good to scold but she said she had to do something and with ten other children under her wings it would never do for her to stand up and tumble him off all the time that they were getting settled for the night the chickens were talking in sleepy little cheeps and now and then one of them would poke his head out between the feathers and tell the speckled hen that somebody was pushing him then she would be more puzzled than ever and cluck louder still sometimes too the chickens would run out for another mouthful of cornmeal mush or a few more drops of water there was one little fellow who always wanted something to drink just when he should have been going to sleep the speckled hen used to say that it took longer for a mouthful of water to run down his throat than it would for her to drink the whole panful of course it did take quite a while because he couldnt hurry it by swallowing he had to drink as all birds do by filling his beak with water and then holding it up until the last drop had trickled down into his stomach when the whole eleven were at last safely tucked away for the night the speckled hen was tired but happy they are good children she often said to herself if they are black spanish they might be just as mischievous if they were speckled still i do wish that those stylishlooking whiteeared black spanish hens would raise their own broods i dont like to be hatchmother to other hens chickens then she would slide her eyelids over her eyes and doze off and dream that they were all speckled like herself there came a day when the coop was raised and they were free to go where they chose there was a fence around the vegetable garden now and netting around the flowerbeds but there were other lovely places for scratching up food for nipping off tender young green things for picking up the fine gravel which every chicken needs and for wallowing in the dust then the black spanish chickens became acquainted with the other fowls whom they had never met before they were rather afraid of the shanghai cock because he had such a gruff way of speaking and they liked the dorkings yet the ones they watched and admired and talked most about were the black spanish cock and hen there were many fowls on the farm who did not have family names and the speckled hen was one of these they had been there longer than the rest and did not really like having new people come to live in the poultryyard it was trying too when the older hens had to hatch the eggs laid by the newcomers it is said that this was what made the speckled hen leave the eleven little black spanish chickens after she had been out of the coop for a while they had been very mischievous and disobedient one day and she walked off and left them to care for themselves while she started to raise a family of her own in a stolen nest under the strawstack when night came eleven little black spanish chickens did not know what to do they went to look for their old coop but that had been given to another hen and her family they walked around looking very small and lonely and wished they had minded the speckled hen and made her love them more at last they found an old potatocrate which reminded them of a coop and so seemed rather homelike it stood top down upon the ground and they were too big to crawl through its barred sides so they did the best they could and huddled together on top of it if there had not been a stoneheap near they could not have done that for their wingfeathers were not yet large enough to help them flutter the bravest chicken went first picking his way from stone to stone until he reached the highest one balancing himself awhile on that stretching his neck toward the potatocrate looking at it as though he were about to jump and then seeming to change his mind and decide not do so after all the chickens on the ground said he was afraid and he said he wasnt any more afraid than they were then after a while he did jump a queer floppy squawky kind of jump but it landed him where he wanted to be after that it was his turn to laugh at the others while they stood teetering uncertainly on the top stone they were very lonely without the speckled hen and each chicken wanted to be in the middle of the group so that he could have others to keep him warm on all sides somebody laughed at the most mischievous chicken and told him he could stand on the potatocrates back without being scolded and he pouted his bill and said much fun that would be all i cared about standing on the speckled hens back was to make her scold it is very shocking that he should say such things but he did say exactly that they slept safely that night and only awakened when the cocks crowed a little while after midnight after that they slept until sunrise and when the shanghais and dorkings came down from the appletree where they had been roosting the black spanish chickens stirred and cheeped and looked at their feathers to see how much they had grown during the night then they pushed and squabbled for their breakfast
 every night they came back to sleep on the potatocrate at last they were able to spring up into their places without standing on the stonepile and that was a great day they talked about it long after they should have been asleep and were still chattering when the shanghai cock spoke if you black spanish chickens dont keep still and let us sleep said he some owl or weasel will come for you and i shall be glad to have him that scared the chickens and they were very quiet it made the black spanish hen uneasy though and she whispered to the black spanish cock and wouldnt let him sleep until he had promised to fight anybody who might try to carry one of the chickens away from the potatocrate the next night first one chicken and then another kept tumbling off the potatocrate they lost their patience and said such things as these to each other you pushed me you know you did well he pushed me didnt either did too well i couldnt help it if i did the shanghai cock became exceedingly cross because they made so much noise and even the black spanish cock lost his patience you may be my children said he but you do not take your manners from me is there no other place on this farm where you can sleep excepting that old crate we want to sleep here answered the chicken on the ground there is plenty of room if those fellows wouldnt push then he flew up and clung and pushed until some other chicken tumbled off well said the black spanish cock and he would have said much more if the black spanish hen had not fluttered down from the appletree to see what was the matter when he saw the expression of her eyes he decided to go back to his perch there is not room for you all said the black spanish hen one must sleep somewhere else there is room said the chickens contradicting her we have always roosted on here there is not room said the black spanish hen once more how do your feathers grow finely said they and your feet they are getting very big was the answer do you think the speckled hen could cover you all with her wings if she were to try it now the chickens looked at each other and laughed they thought it would take three speckled hens to cover them but she used to said the black spanish hen she did not say anything more she just looked at the potatocrate and at them and at the potatocrate again then she walked off after a while one of the chickens said i guess perhaps there isnt room for us all there the mischievous one said if you little chickens want to roost there you may i am too large for that sort of thing then he walked up the slanting board to the appletree branch and perched there beside the young shanghais you should have seen how beautifully he did it his toes hooked themselves around the branch as though he had always perched there and he tucked his head under his wing with quite an air before long his brothers and sisters came also and heard him saying to one of his new neighbors oh yes i much prefer appletrees but when i was a chicken i used to sleep on a potatocrate just listen to him whispered the black spanish cock and he hasnt a tailfeather worth mentioning never mind answered the black spanish hen let them play that they are grown up if they want to they will be soon enough she sighed as she put her head under her wing and settled down for the night it made her feel old to see her children roosting in a tree it was a bright moonlight night when the oldest wigglers in the rainbarrel made up their mind to leave the water they had always been restless and discontented children but it was not altogether their fault how could one expect any insect with such a name to float quietly when the mosquito mothers laid their long and slender eggs in the rainbarrel they had fastened them together in boatshaped masses and there they had floated until the wigglers were strong enough to break through the lower ends of the eggs into the water it had been only a few days before they were ready to do this then there had been a few more days and nights when the tiny wigglers hung head downward in the water and all one could see by looking across the barrel was the tips of their breathing tubes sometimes if they were frightened a young wiggler would forget and get head uppermost for a minute but he was always ashamed to have this happen and made all sorts of excuses for himself when it did wellbred little wigglers tried to always have their heads down and mosquitoes who stopped to visit with them and give good advice told them such things as these the wiggler who keeps his head up may never have wings and up with your tails and down with your eyes if you would be mannerly healthy and wise when they were very young they kept their heads way down and breathed through a tube that ran out near the tailend of their bodies this tube had a cluster of tiny winglike things on the very tip which kept it floating on the top of the water they had no work to do so they just ate food which they found in the water and wiggled and played tag and whenever they were at all frightened they dived to the bottom and stayed there until they were out of breath that was never very long there were many things to frighten them sometimes a stray horse stopped by the barrel to drink sometimes a robin perched on the edge for a few mouthfuls of water and once in a while a dragonfly came over to visit from the neighboring pond it was not always the biggest visitor who scared them the worst the horses tried not to touch the wigglers while a robin was only too glad if he happened to get one into his bill with the water the dragonflies were the worst for they were the hungriest and they were so much smaller that sometimes the wigglers didnt see them coming sometimes too when they thought that a dragonfly was going the other way some of them stayed near the top of the water only to find when it was too late that a dragonfly can go backward or sidewise without turning around when they were a few days old the wigglers began to change their skins this they did by wiggling out of their old ones and wearing the new ones which had been growing underneath this made them feel exceedingly important and some of them became disgracefully vain one wiggler would not dive until he was sure a certain robin had seen his new suit it was because of that vanity he never lived to be a mosquito after they had changed their skins a few times they had two breathingtubes apiece instead of one and these two grew out near their heads and their heads were much larger at the tailend of his body each wiggler now had two leaflike things with which he swam through the water because they used different breathingtubes those wigglers who had moulted or cast their skins several times now floated in the water with their heads just below the surface and their tails down when a wiggler is old enough for this he is called a pupa or halfgrown one there are often young mosquito children of all ages in the same barreleggs wigglers and pupæ all together there is plenty of room and plenty of food but because they have no work to do there is much time for quarrelling and talking about each other this year the oldest brother had put on so many airs that nobody liked it at all and several of the wigglers had been heard to say that they couldnt bear the sight of him he had such a way of saying when i was a young wiggler and had to keep my head down or repeating up with your tails and down with your eyes if you would be mannerly healthy and wise one little wiggler crossed his feelers at him and they say that it is just as bad to do that as to make faces besides it is so much easierif you have the feelers to cross now the oldest brother and those of his brothers and sisters who had hatched from the same eggmass were talking of leaving the rainbarrel forever it was a bright moonlight night and they longed to get their wings uncovered and dried for then they would be fullgrown mosquitoes resting most of the day and having glorious times at night the oldest brother was jerking himself through the water as fast as he could giving his jointed body sudden bends first this way and then that and when he met anyone nearly his own age he said come with me and cast your skin it is a fine evening for moulting sometimes they answered all right and jerked or wiggled or swam along with him and sometimes a pupa would answer im afraid im not old enough to slip out of my skin easily then the oldest brother would reply dont stop for that youll be older by the time we begin that was true of course and all members of mosquito families grow old very fast so it happened that when the moon peeped over the farmhouse showing her bright face between the two chimneys twentythree pupæ were floating close to each other and making ready to change their skins for the last time it was very exciting all the young wigglers hung around to see what was going on and pushed each other aside to get the best places the oldest brother was much afraid that somebody else would begin to moult before he was ready and all the brothers were telling their sisters to be careful to split their skins in the right place down the back and the sisters were telling them that they knew just as much about moulting as their brothers did every little while the oldest brother would say now wait dont one of you fellows split his old skin until i say so then two or three of his brothers would become impatient because their outer skins were growing tighter every minute and would say why not and would grumble because they had to wait the truth was that the oldest brother could not get his skin to crack although he jerked and wiggled and took very deep breaths and he didnt want any one else to get ahead of him at last it did begin to open and he had just told the others to commence moulting when a mosquito mother stopped to lay a few eggs in the barrel dear me said she you are not
 going to moult tonight are you yes we are answered the oldest brother giving a wiggle that split his skin a little farther well be biting people before morning you said the mosquito mother with a queer little smile i wouldnt count on doing that but you young people may get into trouble if you moult now for it looks like rain she waved her feelers upward as she spoke and they noticed that heavy black clouds were piling up in the sky even as they looked the moon was hidden and the wind began to stir the branches of the trees it will rain she said and then the water will run off the roof into this barrel and if you have just moulted and cannot fly you will be drowned pooh answered the oldest brother guess we can take care of ourselves im not afraid of a little water then he tried to crawl out of his old skin the mosquito mother stayed until she had laid all the eggs she wanted to and then flew away not one of the pupæ had been willing to listen to her although some of the sisters might have done so if their brothers had not made fun of them at last twentythree soft and tired young mosquitoes stood on their castoff pupaskins waiting for their wings to harden it is never easy work to crawl out of ones skin and the last moulting is the hardest of all it was then when they could do nothing but wait that these young mosquitoes began to feel afraid the night was now dark and windy and sometimes a sudden gust blew their floating pupa skins toward one side of the barrel they had to cling tightly to them for they suddenly remembered that if they fell into the water they might drown the oldest one found himself wishing to be a wiggler again wigglers are never drowned thought he who are you going to bite first asked one of his brothers he answered very crossly i dont know and i dont care im not hungry cant you think of anything but eating why what else is there to think about cried all the floating mosquitoes well there is flying said he humph i dont see what use flying would be except to carry us to our food said one mosquito sister she afterward found out that it was good for other reasons after that they didnt try to talk with their oldest brother they talked with each other and tried their legs and wished it were light enough for them to see their wings mosquitoes have such interesting wings you know thin and gauzy and with delicate fringes around the edges and along the line of each vein the sisters too were proud of the pockets under their wings and were in a hurry to have their wings harden so that they could flutter them and hear the beautiful singing sound made by the air striking these pockets they knew that their brothers could never sing and they were glad to think that they were ahead of them for once it was not really their fault that they felt so for the brothers had often put on airs and laughed at them then came a wonderful flash of lightning and a long roll of thunder and the trees tossed their beautiful branches to and fro while big raindrops pattered down on to the roof overhead and spattered and bounded and rolled toward the edge under which the rainbarrel stood fly cried the oldest brother raising his wings as well as he could we cant where to cried the rest fly any way anywhere screamed the oldest brother and in some wonderful way the whole twentythree managed to flutter and crawl and sprawl up the side of the building where the raindrops fell past but did not touch them there they found older mosquitoes waiting for the shower to stop even the oldest brother was so scared that he shook and when he saw that same mosquito mother who had told him to put off changing his skin he got behind two other young mosquitoes and kept very still perhaps she saw him for it was lighter then than it had been she did not seem to see him but he heard her talking to her friends i told him she said that he might better put off moulting but he answered that he could take care of himself and that he would be out biting people before morning did he say that cried the other old mosquitoes he did she replied then they all laughed and laughed and laughed again and the young mosquito found out why it was because mosquito brothers have to eat honey and only the sisters may bite people and suck their blood he had thought so often how he would sing around somebody until he found the nicest juiciest spot and then settle lightly down and bite and suck until his slender little body was fat and round and red with its stomachful of blood and that could never be he could never sing and he would have to sit around with his stomach full of honey and see his eleven sisters gorged with blood and hear them singing sweetly as they flew if mosquito fathers had ever come to the barrel he might have found this out but they never did he sneaked off by himself until he met an early bird and thenwell you know birds must eat something and the mosquito was right there of course after that his brothers and sisters had a chance to do as they wanted to and the eleven sisters bit thirteen people the very next night and had the loveliest kind of mosquito time there was hardly a night of his life when the little brother of the raccoon family was not reproved by his mother for teasing mrs raccoon said she didnt know what she had done to deserve such a child when she spoke like this to her neighbors they sighed and said it must be trying but he may outgrow it the oldest wolverene though told the skunk that his cousin mrs raccoons husband had been just as bad as that when he was young i do not want you to say that i said so he whispered because he might hear of it and be angry but it is true the oldest wolverene didnt say whether mr raccoon outgrew this bad habit yet it would seem that his wife had never noticed it you must not think that mr raccoon was dead oh no indeed every night he was prowling through the forest on tiptoe looking for food but mrs raccoon was a very devoted mother and gave so much time and attention to her children that she was not good company for her husband he did not care much for home life and the children annoyed him exceedingly so he went away and found a hole in another tree which he fitted up for himself there he slept through the day and until the setting of the sun told him that it was time for his breakfast raccoons like company and he often had friends in to sleep with him sometimes these friends were raccoons like himself with wives and children and then they would talk about their families and tell how they thought their wives were spoiling the children the four little raccoons who lived with their mother in the dead branch of the big oaktree had been born in april when the forest was sweet with the scent of wild violets and every one was happy beautiful pink and white trilliums raised their threecornered flowers above their threefold leaves and nodded with every passing breeze yellow adderstongue was there with cranesbill geraniums squirrelcorn and spring beauties besides hepaticas and windflowers and the dainty bishopscap the young raccoons did not see these things for their eyes would not work well by daylight and when after dark their mother let them put their heads out of the hole and look around they were too far from the ground to see the flowers sleeping in the dusk below they could only sniff sniff sniff with their sharp little turnedup noses and wonder what flowers look like any way when their mother was with them for a time and that was while they were drinking the warm milk that she always carried for them she told them stories of the flowers and trees she had begun by telling them animal stories but she found that it made them cowardly just supposing one young raccoon had said a great big dreadful snail should come up this tree and eat us all the mother told them that snails were small and slow and weak and never climbed trees or ate people but it did no good and her children were always afraid of snails until they had seen one for themselves after that she told them stories of the flowers and when they asked if the flowers would ever come to see them she said no indeed you will never see them until you can climb down the tree and walk among them for they grow with their feet in the ground and never go anywhere there were many stories which they wanted over and over again but the one they liked best of all was that about the wicked wicked poison ivy and the gentle spotted touchmenot who grew near him and undid all the trouble that the ivy made when the night came for the young raccoons to climb down from their tree and learn to hunt all the early spring blossoms were gone and only the ripening seedvessels showed where nodding flowers had been you would have expected the raccoon children to be disappointed yet there were so many other things to see and learn about that it was not until three nights later that they thought much of the flowers they might not have done so then if little sister had not lost her hold upon the oaktree bark and fallen with her forepaws on a scarlet jackinthepulpit berry they had to learn to climb quickly and strongly up all sorts of trees perhaps mrs raccoon had chosen an oak for her nest because that was rough and easily climbed there were many good places for raccoons to grip with their twenty strong claws apiece after they had learned oaks they took maples ironwoods and beecheseach a harder lesson than the one before when you climb a tree said their mother always look over the trunk and the largest branches for hidingplaces whether you want to use one then or not why asked three of the four children big brother who was rather vain was looking at the five beautiful black rings and the beautiful black tip of his wonderful bushy tail between the black rings were whitish ones and he thought such things much more interesting than holes in trees because said the mother raccoon you may be far
 from home some night and want a safe place to sleep in all day or if a man and his dogs are chasing you you must climb into the first hidingplace you can we raccoons are too fat and slow to run away from them and the rings on our tails and the black patches on our broad faces might show from the ground if the hole is a small one make it cover your head and your tail anyway and as much of your brown body fur as you can mother raccoon looked sternly at big brother because he had not been listening and he gave a slight jump and asked wwhat did you say what did i say she replied you should have paid better attention yes m said big brother who was now very meek i shall not repeat it said his mother but i will tell you not to grow vain of your fur it is very handsome and so is that of your sisters and your brother so is mine and so was your fathers the last time i saw him yet nearly all the trouble that raccoons have is on account of their fur never try to show it off the time came for the young raccoons to stop drinking milk from their mothers body and when they tried to do so she only walked away from them i cannot work so hard to care for you said she i am so tired and thin now that my skin is loose and you must find your own food you are getting forty fine teeth apiece and i never saw a better lot of claws on any raccoon family if i do say it they used to go hunting together for it is the custom for raccoons to go in parties of from five to eight hunt all night and then hide somewhere until the next night they did not always come home at sunrise and it made a pleasant change to sleep in different trees one day they all cuddled down in the hollow of an old maple just below where the branches come out mother raccoon had climbed the tree first and was curled away in the very bottom of the hole the four children were not tired and hadnt wanted to go to bed at all little sister had made a dreadful face when her mother called her up the tree and if it had not already been growing light mrs raccoon would probably have seen it and punished her big sister curled down beside her mother and little sister was rather above them and beside mischievous little brother last of all came big brother who had stopped to scratch his ear with his hind foot he was very proud of his little round ears and often scratched them in this way to make sure that the fur lay straight on them he was so slow in reaching the hole that before he got into it a robin had begun his morning song of cheerily cheerily cheerup and a chipmunk perched on a stump to make his morning toilet he got all settled and little brother was half asleep beside him when he remembered his tail and sat up to have one more look at it little brother growled sleepily and told him to let his old tail alone and come to bed as long as they couldnt hunt any more but big brother thought he saw a sandburr on his tail and wanted to pull it out before it hurt the fur then he began to look at the bare tough pads on his feet and to notice how finely he could spread his toes those of his front feet he could spread especially wide he balanced himself on the edge of the hole and held them spread out before him it was still dark enough for him to see well come here little brother he cried wake up and see how big my feet are getting mother raccoon growled at them to be good children and go to sleep but her voice sounded dreamy and far away because she had to talk through part of her own fur and most of her daughters little brother lost his patience unrolled himself with a spring jumped to the opening and knocked his brother down it was dreadful of course big brother was not much hurt for he was very fat and his fur was both long and thick but he turned over and over on his way to the ground before he alighted on his feet he turned so fast and little brothers eyes hurt him so that it looked as though big brother had about three heads three tails and twelve feet he called out as he fell and that awakened the sisters who began to cry and mother raccoon who was so scared that she began to scold such a time mother raccoon found out what had happened and then she said to little brother did you mean to push him down no maam answered little brother hanging his head anyhow i didnt mean to after i saw him going perhaps i did mean to before that you see he was a truthful raccoon even when he was most naughty and there is always hope for a raccoon who will tell the truth no matter how hard it is to do so big brother climbed slowly up the trunk of the oaktree while more and more of the daytime people came to look at him he could not see well now and so was very awkward when he reached the hole he was hot and cross and complained to his mother make him quit teasing me he said pointing one forepaw at little brother i will answered mother raccoon but you were just as much to blame as he for if you had cuddled down quietly when i told you to you would have been dreaming long ago now you must sleep where i was at the lower end of the hole little brother must go next and i do not want to hear one word from either of you sisters next and i will sleep by the opening you children must remember that it is no time for talking to each other or looking at claws or getting sandburrs out of your tails after you have been sent to bed go to sleep and dont awaken until the sun has gone down and you are ready to be my good little raccoons again her children were asleep long before she was and she talked softly to herself after they were dreaming they do not mean to be naughty she said yet it makes my fur stand on end to think what might have happened i ought not to have curled up for the day until they had done so mothers should always be at the top of the heap then she fixed herself for a long restful days sleep it was not often that the little ground hogs were left alone in the daytime before they were born their mother had been heard to say that she had her opinion of any ground hog who would be seen out after sunrise mr ground hog felt in the same way and said if he ever got to running around by daylight like some of his relatives people might call him a woodchuck he thought that any one who ate twigs beets turnips young treebark and other green things from sunset to sunrise ought to be able to get along until the next sunset without a lunch he said that any ground hog who wanted more was a pig after the baby ground hogs were born matters were different they could not go out at night to feed for themselves and their stomachs were so tiny and held so little at a time that they had to be filled very often mr ground hog was never at home now and the care all fell upon his hardworking wife you know my dear he had said that i should only be in the way if i were to stay at home for i am not clever and patient with children as you are no i think i will go away and see to some matters which i have rather neglected of late when the children are grown up and you have more time to give me i will come back to you then mr ground hog trotted away to join a party of his friends who had just told their wives something of the same sort and they all went together to the farmers turnip patch and had a delightful time until morning mrs ground hog looked after him as he trotted away and wished that she could go too he looked so handsome with the moonlight shining down on his long thick reddish fur and showing the black streak on his back where the fur was tipped with gray he was fat and shaky with a baggy skin and when he stopped to sit up on his haunches and wave his paws at her and comb his facefur she thought him just as handsome as he had been in the early spring when they first met that had been in a parsnip patch where there was good feeding until the farmer found that the ground hogs were there and dug the rest of his vegetables and stored them in his cellar such midnight meals as they had eaten there together mrs ground hog said she never saw a parsnip afterward without thinking of their courtship she had been as handsome as he and there were many other ground hogs who admired her but now she was thin and did not have many chances to comb her fur with her fore paws she could not go with him to the turnip patch because she did not wish to go so far from her babies thinking of that reminded her to go into her sidehill burrow and see what they were doing then she lay down and let them draw the warm milk from her body while they were feeding she felt of them and thought how fast they were growing it would be only a short time before they could trot around the fields by themselves and whistle shrilly as they dodged down into their own burrows ah said she this is better than turnip patches or even parsnips when they had finished their mother left them and went out to feed she had always been a hearty eater but now she had to eat enough more to make the milk for her babies she often thought that if ground hog babies could eat anything else their father might have learned to help feed them she thought of this especially when she saw the great horned owl carrying food home to his son and daughter it is what comes of being fourlegged said she and i wouldnt be an owl for anything so i wont grumble after this she was more cheerful when she left the burrow she always said i am going out to feed and i shall not be gone very long dont be afraid for you have a good burrow and it is nice and dark outside the children would cry and you will surely come home before sunrise surely she always answered as she trotted away then the children would rest happily in their burrownest but now mrs ground hog was hungry and it was broad daylight she knew that it was because her children grew bigger every day and had to have more and more milk this meant that she must eat more or else when they wanted milk there would not be enough ready she knew that she must begin
 to feed by day as well as by night and she was glad that she could see fairly well if the sun were not shining into her eyes children said she to them just as they finished their morning lunch i am very hungry and i am going out to feed you will be quite safe here and i want you to be good while i am gone the young ground hogs began to cry and clutch at her fur with their weak little paws oh dont go they said please dont go we dont want to stay alone in the daytime were afraid i must said she or i shall have no milk for you and then you wouldnt have me lie here all day too hungry to sleep would you nno said they but youll come back soon wont you yes said she and she shook off their clinging paws and poked back the daughter who caught on again and trotted away as fast as she could it was the first time that she had been out by daylight and everything looked queer the colors looked too bright and there seemed to be more noise than usual and she met several people whom she had never seen before she stopped for a minute to look at an ovenbirds nest the motherbird was inside sitting there very still and brave although she was much frightened goodmorning said mrs ground hog i was just admiring your nest i have never seen it by daylight goodmorning answered the ovenbird im glad you fancy my nest but i hope you dont like to eat meat meat answered mrs ground hog i never touch it and she smiled and showed all her teeth oh exclaimed the ovenbird i see you dont for you have gnawingteeth rather like those of the rabbits then she hopped out of the nest and let mrs ground hog peep in to see how the inside was finished and also to see the four speckled eggs which lay there it is a lovely nest said mrs ground hog and those eggs are beauties but i promised the children that i would hurry goodby she trotted happily away while mrs ovenbird settled herself upon her eggs again and thought what a pleasant call she had had and what an excellent and intelligent person mrs ground hog was all this time the children at home were talking together about themselves and what their mother had told them once there was a long pause which lasted until the brother said im not afraid are you of course not said they because there isnt anything to be afraid of said he not anything said they and i wouldnt be afraid anyway said he neither would we answered the sisters there was another long pause she said wed be just as safe as if it were dark said the big sister of course said the brother and she said shed come back as soon as she could said the second sister i wish shed come now said the smallest sister there was another long pause you dont suppose anybody would come here just to scare us do you asked the second sister see here said the brother i wish youd quit saying things to make a fellow afraid you dont mean that you are frightened exclaimed the three sisters together and the smallest one added why you are too i can feel you tremble well i dont care said the brother im not afraid of people anyhow if it were only dark i wouldnt mind oh are you afraid of the daylight too cried each of the sisters so am i then they all trembled together i tell you what lets do said the smallest sister lets all stop looking toward the light end of the burrow and cuddle up together and cover our eyes and make believe its night they did this and felt better they even played that they heard the few noises of the nighttime a crow cawed outside and the brother said did you hear that owl that was the great horned owl the one who had to hatch the eggs you know when another crow cawed the smallest sister said was that his cousin the screech owl yes answered the big sister he is the one who used to bring things for the great horned owl to eat so they amused themselves and each other and really got along very well except when once in a while they opened their eyes a little crack to see if it were not getting really dark then they had to begin all over again at last their mother came and what a comfort it was how glad she was to be back and how much she had to tell them all about the ovenbirds nest and the four eggs in it and how the ovenbirds spent their nights in sleeping and their days in work and play i wonder if the little ovenbirds will be scared when they have to stay alone in the daytime said the smallest sister they would be more scared if they had to stay alone at night said their mother at night exclaimed all the young ground hogs why it is dark then they might be afraid of the darkness said their mother then the children laughed and thought she was making fun of them they drank some milk and went to sleep like good little ground hogs but even after he was half asleep the big brother laughed out loud at the thought of the ovenbird babies being scared at night he could understand any ones being afraid of daylight but darkness it was not very many nights after big brother had tumbled from the mapletree when he and the other children were invited to a raccoon party down by the pond the water was low and in the small pools by the shore there were many freshwater clams and small fishes such as raccoons like best of all a family of six young raccoons who lived very near the pond had found them just before sunrise when they had to climb off to bed they knew there was much more food there than they could eat alone so their mother had let them invite their four friends who lived in the hollow of the oaktree the party was to begin the next evening at moonrise and the four children who lived in the oaktree got their invitation just as they were going to sleep for the day they were very much excited over it for they had never been to a party i wish we could go now said big brother yes lots of fun it would be now answered little brother the sun is almost up and there are no clouds in the sky we couldnt see a thing unless we shaded our eyes with our fore paws and if we had to use our fore paws in that way we couldnt eat you do eat at parties dont you asked little sister who had not quite understood what was said of course shouted her brothers that is what parties are for i thought maybe you talked some said big sister i suppose you do have to some said big brother but i know you eat ive heard people tell about parties lots of times and they always began by telling what they ate thats what makes it a party oh i wish it were night and time to go sighed little brother i dont said little sister i wouldnt have any fun if i were to go now id rather wait until my stomach is empty there said their mother you children have talked long enough now curl down and go to sleep the birds are already singing their morning songs and the owls and bats were dreaming long ago it will make nighttime come much sooner if you do not stay awake were not a bit sleepy cried all the young raccoons together that makes no difference at all said their mother and she spoke quite sternly cuddle down for the day now cover your eyes and stop talking i do not say you must sleep but you must stop talking they knew that when she spoke in that way and said must there was nothing to do but to mind so they cuddled down and every one of them was asleep before you could drop an acorn mother raccoon had known it would be so when they awakened early the next night each young raccoon had to make himself look as neat as possible there were long fur to be combed faces and paws to be washed and twentythree burrs to be taken out of little brothers tail he began to take them out himself but his mother found that whenever he got one loose he stuck it onto one of the other children so she scolded him and made him sit on a branch by himself while she worked at the burrs sometimes she couldnt help pulling the fur and then he tried to wriggle away youve got enough out he cried let the rest go you should have thought sooner how it would hurt she said you have been told again and again to keep away from the burrs and you are just as careless as you were the first night you left the tree then she took out another burr and dropped it to the ground ouch said he let me go not until i am done she answered no child of mine shall ever go to a party looking as you do after that little brother tried to hold still and he had time to think how glad he was that he hadnt stuck any more burrs on the other children if he had gotten more onto them he would have had to wait while they were pulled off again and then they might have been late for the party if he had been very good he would have been glad they didnt have to be hurt as he was but he was not very good and he never thought of that when he was ready at last mother raccoon made her four children sit in a row while she talked to them remember to walk on your toes said she although you may stand flatfooted if you wish dont act greedy if you can help it go into the water as much as you choose but dont try to dive even if they dare you to raccoons can never learn to dive no matter how well they swim and be sure to wash your food before you eat it all the young raccoons said yesm and thought they would remember every word the first moonbeam shone on the top of the oaktree and mrs raccoon said now you may go be good children and remember what i told you dont stay too long start home when you see the first light in the east yesm said the young raccoons as they walked off very properly toward the pond after they were well away from the oaktree they heard their mother calling to them remember to walk on your toes raccoons cannot go very fast and the moon was shining brightly when they reached the pond and met their six friends such frolics as they had in the shallow water swimming twisting turning scooping up food with their busy fore paws going up and down the beach and rolling on the sand they never once remembered what their mother had told them and they acted exactly as they had been in the habit of doing
 every day big brother looked admiringly at his own tail every chance he got although he had been told particularly not to act as if he thought himself finelooking little brother rolled into a lot of sandburrs and got his fur so matted that he looked worse than ever big sister snatched food from other raccoons and not one of them remembered about walking on tiptoe little sister ate half the time without washing her food of course that didnt matter when the food was taken from the pond but when they found some on the beach and ate it without washingthat was dreadful no raccoon who is anybody at all will do that the mother of the family of six looked on from a tree near by the children did not know that she was there what manners said she i shall never have them invited here again just then she saw one of her own sons eat without washing his food and she groaned out loud my children are forgetting too she said i have told him hundreds of times that if he did that way every day he would do so at a party but he has always said he would remember the mother of the four young raccoons was out hunting and found herself near the pond how noisy those children are she said to herself night people should be quiet she tiptoed along to a pile of rocks and peeped between them to see what was going on she saw her childrens footprints on the sand aha said she so they did walk flatfooted after all she heard somebody scrambling down a tree near by goodevening said a pleasant raccoon voice near her it was the mother of the six are you watching the childrens party asked the newcomer i hope you did not notice how badly my son is behaving i have tried to teach my children good manners but they will be careless when i am not looking and then of course they forget in company that made the mother of the four feel more comfortable i know just how that is said she mine mean to be good but they are so careless it is very discouraging the two mothers talked for a long time in whispers and then each went to her hole when the four young raccoons came home it was beginning to grow light and they kept close together because they were somewhat afraid their mother was waiting to see them settled for the day she asked if they had a good time and said she was glad they got home promptly they had been afraid she would ask if they had washed their food and walked on their toes she even seemed not to notice little brothers matted coat when they awakened the next night the mother hurried them off with her to the same pond where they had been to the party i am going to visit with the mother of your friends said she and you may play around and amuse yourselves the young raccoons had another fine time although little brother found it very uncomfortable to wear so many burrs they played tag in the trees and ate and swam and lay on the beach while they were lying there the four from the oaktree noticed that their mother was walking flatfooted there was bright moonlight and anybody might see her they felt dreadfully about it then they saw her begin to eat food which she had not washed they were so ashamed that they didnt want to look their friends in the eye they didnt know that their friends were feeling in the same way because they had seen their mother doing illmannered things after they reached home big brother said very timidly to his mother did you know you ate some food without washing it oh yes she answered it is such a bother to dip it all in water and you walked flatfooted said little brother well why shouldnt i if i want to said she the children began to cry ppeople will think you dont know any bbetter said they we were ddreadfully ashamed oh said their mother oh oh so you think that my manners are not so good as yours is that it the young raccoons looked at each other in a very uncomfortable way we suppose we dont always do things right ourselves they answered but you are grown up yes replied their mother and you will be for a long time nobody spoke and little sister sobbed out loud then mrs raccoon spoke more gently the sun is rising said she we will go to sleep now and when we awaken tomorrow night we will try to have better manners so that we need not be ashamed of each other at parties or at home long after the rest were dreaming big sister nudged big brother and awakened him i understand it now she said she did it on purpose who did what asked he why our mother she was rude on purpose to let us see how it looked big brother thought for a minute of course said he of course she did well she wont ever have to do it again for me nor for me said big sister then they went to sleep the skunks did not go into society at all they were very unpopular and so many people feared or disliked them that nobody would invite them to a party indeed if they had been invited to a party and had gone the other guests would have left at once the small people of the forest feared them because they were meateaters and the larger ones disliked them because of their disagreeable habits the skunks were handsome and quiet but they were quicktempered and as soon as one of them became angry he threw a horrible smelling liquid on the people who displeased him it was not only horrible smelling but it made those who had to smell it steadily quite sick and would indeed have killed them if they had not kept in the fresh air if a drop of this liquid got on to a person even his wife and children had to keep away from him for a long time and the skunks were so unreasonable they would not stop to see what was the real trouble but if anybody ran into them by mistake in the darkness they would just as likely as not throw the liquid at once among themselves they seemed to be quite happy there were from six to ten children born at a time in each family these children lived in the burrow with their father and mother until the next spring sleeping steadily through the coldest weather of winter and only awakening when it was warm enough for them to enjoy life when spring came the children found themselves grownup and went off to live their own lives in new holes while their mothers took care of the six or seven or eight or nine or ten new babies there was one very interesting skunk family in the forest with the father mother and eight children living in one hole no two of them were marked in exactly the same way although all were stoutly built had small heads little round ears and beautiful long tails covered with soft drooping hair their fur was rather long and handsome and they were dark brown or black nearly all over most of them had a streak of white on the forehead a spot of it on the neck some on the tail and a couple of stripes of it on their backs one could see them quite easily by starlight on account of the white fur the skunks were really very proud of their white stripes and spots it is not so much having the white fur mrs skunk had been heard to say as it is having it where all can see it most animals wear the dark fur on their backs and the light on their bellies and that is to make them safer from enemies but we dare to wear ours in plain sight we are never afraid and what she said was true although it hardly seemed modest for her to talk about it in that way it would have been more polite to let other people tell how brave her family were perhaps however if somebody else had been telling it he would have said that part of their courage was rudeness father skunk always talked to his children as his father had talked to him and probably as his grandfather had also talked when he was raising a family never turn out of your way for anybody said he let the other fellow step aside remember that no matter whom you meet and no matter how large the other people may be if they see you they will get out of your path and if they cant it is not your fault dont speak to them and dont hurry always take your time father skunk was slow and stately it was a sight worth seeing when he started off for a nights ramble walking with a slow and measured gait and carrying his fine tail high over his back he always went by himself one is company two is a crowd he would say as he walked away when they were old enough the young skunks began to walk off alone as soon as it was dark mother skunk also went alone and perhaps she had the best time of all for it was a great rest not to have eight babies tumbling over her back and getting under her feet and hanging on to her with their thirtytwo paws and sometimes even scratching her with their one hundred and sixty claws they still slept through the days in the old hole so they were together much of the time but they did not hunt in parties as raccoons and weasels do one of the brothers had no white whatever on his tail so they called him the blacktailed skunk he had heard in some way that there was an ovenbirds nest on the ground by the fern bank and he made up his mind to find it the very next night and eat the eggs which were inside another brother was called the spotted skunk because the spot on his neck was so large he had found the ovenbirds nest himself while on his way home in the early morning he would have liked to rob it then but he had eaten so much that night that he thought it better to wait so it happened that when the family awakened the next night two of the children had important plans of their own neither of them would have told for anything but they couldnt quite keep from hinting about it as they made themselves ready to go out aha said the blacktailed skunk i know something you dont know oh tell us cried four or five of the other children while the spotted skunk twisted his head and said you dont either i do too replied the blacktailed skunk children children exclaimed mrs skunk while their father said that he couldnt see where his children got their quarrelsome disposition for none of his people had ever contradicted or disputed his wife
 told him that she really thought them very good and that she was sure they behaved much better than most skunks of their age then their father walked off in his most stately manner putting his feet down almost flat and carrying his tail a little higher than usual i do know something that you dont repeated the blacktailed skunk and its something nice too aw said the spotted skunk i dont believe it and i dont care anyhow i know you dont know and i know youd want to know if you knew what i know said the blacktailed skunk who was now getting so excited that he could hardly talk straight children exclaimed their mother not another word about that i do wish you would wake up goodnatured he started it said the spotted skunk and were not quarrelling anyhow but i guess hed give a good deal to know where im going children repeated their mother go at once i will not have you talking in this way before your brothers and sisters do not stop to talk but go so the two brothers started out for the night and each thought he would go a roundabout way to fool the other the blacktailed skunk went to the right and the spotted skunk went to the left but each of them you know really started to rob the ovenbirds nest it was a very dark night even the stars were all hidden behind thick clouds and one could hardly see ones forepaws while walking but of course the nightprowlers of the forest are used to this and fourfooted people are not so likely to stumble and fall as twofooted ones besides young skunks have to remember where logs and stumps of trees are just as other people have to remember their lessons so it happened that while mrs ovenbird was sleeping happily with her four eggs safe and warm under her breast two people were coming from different ways to rob her such a snug nest as it was she had chosen a tiny hollow in the fern bank and had cunningly woven dry grasses and leaves into a ballshaped nest which fitted neatly into the hollow and had a doorway on one side the blacktailed skunk sneaked up to the nest from one side the spotted skunk sneaked up from the other side once the blacktailed skunk thought he heard some other creature moving toward him at the same minute the spotted skunk thought he heard somebody so he stopped to listen neither heard anything mrs ovenbird was sure that she heard a leaf rustle outside and it made her anxious until she remembered that a dead twig might have dropped from the beechtree overhead and hit the dry leaves below slowly the two brothers crept toward the nest and each other they moved very quietly because each wanted to catch the motherbird if he could close to the nest hollow they crouched and sprang with jaws open and sharp teeth ready to bite there was a sudden crashing of leaves and ferns the two brothers had sprung squarely at each other each was bitten growled and ran away and how they did run it is not often you know that skunks go faster than a walk but when they are really scared they move very very swiftly mrs ovenbird felt her nest roof crush down upon her for a minute as two people rolled and growled outside then she heard them running away in different directions and knew that she was safe for a time at least in the morning she repaired her nest and told her bird friends about it they advised her to take her children away as soon as possible after they were hatched if the skunks have found your nest they said you may have another call from them when the blacktailed skunk came stealing home in the first faint light just before sunrise he found the spotted skunk telling the rest of the family how some horrible great fierce beast had pounced upon him in the darkness and bitten him on the shoulder it was so dark said he that i couldnt see him at all but i am sure it must have been a bear they turned to tell the blacktailed skunk about his brothers misfortune and saw that he limped badly did the bear catch you too they cried yes answered he it must have been a bear it was so big and strong and fierce but i bit him too i wouldnt have run away from him only he was so much bigger than i that was just the way with me said the spotted skunk i wouldnt have run if he hadnt been so big you should have thrown liquid on him said their father then he would have been the one to run the brothers hung their heads we never thought they cried we think it must have been because we were so surprised and didnt see him coming well said their father sternly i suppose one must be patient with children but such unskunklike behavior makes me very much ashamed of you both then the two bitten brothers went to bed in disgrace although their mother was sorry for them and loved them as mothers will do even when their children are naughty or cowardly one night some time later these two brothers happened to meet down by the fern bank it was bright moonlight and they stopped to visit for both were feeling very goodnatured the blacktailed skunk said come with me and ill show you where there is an ovenbirds nest all right answered the spotted skunk and then ill show you one ive just been waiting for a bright night said the blacktailed skunk because i came here once in the dark and had bad luck it was near here said the spotted skunk that i was bitten by the bear they stopped beside a tiny hollow there is the nest said the blacktailed skunk pointing with one of his long forefeet why that is the one i meant exclaimed the spotted skunk i found it first said the blacktailed skunk and id have eaten the eggs before if that bear hadnt bitten me just at that minute the two skunks had a new idea we do believe cried they that we bit each other we certainly did said the spotted skunk but well never tell said the blacktailed skunk now they added together lets eat everything but they didnt in fact they didnt eat anything for the eggs were hatched and the young birds had left the nest only the day before now that spring had come and all the green things were growing the cutworms crawled out of their winter sleepingplaces in the ground and began to eat the tenderest and best things that they could find they felt rested and hungry after their quiet winter for they had slept without awakening ever since the first really cold days of fall there were many different kinds of cutworms brothers and sisters cousins and second cousins so of course they did not all look alike they had hatched the summer before from eggs laid by the owlet moths their mothers and had spent the time from then until cold weather in eating and sleeping and eating some more of course they grew a great deal but then you know one can grow without taking time especially for it it is well that this is so if people had to say i can do nothing else now i must sit down and grow awhile there would not be so many large people in the world as there are they would become so interested in doing other things that they would not take the time to grow as they should now the cutworms were fine and fat and just as heedless as cutworms have been since the world began they had never seen their parents and had hatched without any one to look after them they did not look like their parents for they were only worms as yet but they had the same habit of sleeping all day and going out at night and never thought of eating breakfast until the sun had gone down they were quite popular in underground society and were much liked by the earthworms and may beetle larvæ who enjoyed hearing stories of what the cutworms saw above ground the may beetle larvæ did not go out at all because they were too young and the earthworms never knew what was going on outside unless somebody told them they often put their heads up into the air but they had no eyes and could not see for themselves the cutworms were bold saucy selfish and wasteful they were not good children although when they tried they could be very entertaining and one always hoped that they would improve before they became moths sometimes they even told the earthworms and may beetle larvæ stories that were not so and that shows what sort of children they were it was dreadful to tell such things to people who could never find out the difference one spotted cutworm heard a couple of earthworms talking about ground moles and told them that ground moles were large birds with four wings apiece and legs like a caterpillars they did not take pains to be entertaining because they wanted to make the underground people happy but because they enjoyed hearing them say what bright fellows those cutworms are really exceedingly clever and doing it for that reason took all the goodness out of it one bright moonlight night the cutworms awakened and crawled out on top of the ground to feed they lived in the farmers vegetable garden so there were many things to choose from young beets just showing their redveined leaves above their shining red stems turnips cleanlooking onions holding their slender leaves very stiff and straight radishes with just a bit of their rosy roots peeping out of the earth and crisp pale green lettuce crinkled and shaking in every passing breeze it was a lovely growing time and all the vegetables were making the most of the fine nights for you know that is the time when everything grows best sunshiny days are the best for coloring leaves and blossoms but the time for sinking roots deeper and sending shoots higher and unfolding new leaves is at night in the beautiful stillness some cutworms chose beets and some chose radishes two or three liked lettuce best and a couple crawled off to nibble at the sweet peas which the farmers wife had planted they never ate all of a plant ah no and that was one way in which they were wasteful they nibbled through the stalk where it came out of the ground and then the plant tumbled down and withered while the cutworm went on to treat another in the same way well exclaimed one spotted cutworm as he crawled
 out from his hole i must have overslept guess i stayed up too late this morning youd better look out said one of his friends or the ground mole will get you he likes to find nice fat little cutworms who sleep too late in the evening neednt tell me answered the spotted cutworm its the early mole that catches the cutworm i dont know when i have overslept myself so have you fellows been up ever since sunset yes they answered and one saucy fellow added i got up too early i awakened and felt hungry and thought id just come out for a lunch i supposed the birds had finished their supper but the first thing i saw was a robin out hunting she was not more than the length of a beanpole from me and when i saw her cock her head on one side and look toward me i was sure she saw me but she didnt after all lucky for me that i am green and came up beside the lettuce i kept still and she took me for a leaf st said somebody else there comes the ground mole they all kept still while the mole scampered to and fro on the dewy grass near them going faster than one would think he could with such very very short legs his pink digging hands flashed in the moonlight and his pink snout showed also but the dark soft fur of the rest of his body could hardly be seen against the brown earth of the garden it may have been because he was not hungry or it may have been because his fur covered over his eyes so but he went back to his underground runway without having caught a single cutworm then the cutworms felt very much set up they crawled toward the hole into his runway and made faces at it as though he were standing in the doorway they called mean things after him and pretended to say them very loudly yet really spoke quite softly then they began to boast that they were not afraid of anybody and while they were boasting they ate and ate and ate and ate here and there the young plants drooped and fell over and as soon as one did that the cutworm who had eaten on it crawled off to another guess the farmer will know that weve been here said they we dont care he doesnt need all these vegetables what if he did plant them let him plant some more if he wants to what business has he to have so many anyhow if he wont share with other people you would have thought to hear them that they were exceedingly kind to leave any vegetables for the farmer in among the sweet peas were many little tufts of purslane and purslane is very good to eat as anybody knows who has tried it but do you think the cutworms ate that not a bit of it we can have purslane any day they said and now we will eat sweet peas one little fellow added you wont catch me eating purslane its a weed now cutworms do eat weeds but they always seem to like best those things which have been carefully planted and tended if the purslane had been set in straight rows and the sweet peas had just come up of themselves everywhere it is quite likely that this young cutworm would have said you wont catch me eating sweet peas they are weeds as the moon rose higher and higher in the sky the cutworms boasted more and more they said there were no robins clever enough to find them and that the ground mole dared not touch them when they were together and that it was only when he found one alone underground that he was brave enough to do so they talked very loudly now and bragged dreadfully until they noticed that the moon was setting and a faint yellow light showed over the treetops in the east time to go to bed for the day called the spotted cutworm where are you going to crawl in they had no regular homes you know but crawled into the earth wherever they wanted to and slept until the next night here are some fine holes already made said a green cutworm and big enough for a garter snake they are smooth and deep and a lot of us can cuddle down into each im going into one of them who made those holes asked the spotted cutworm and why are they here oh who cares who made them answered the green cutworm guess theyre ours if we want to use them perhaps the farmer made them said the spotted cutworm and if he did i dont want to go into them oh whos afraid of him cried the other cutworms come along no answered the spotted cutworm i wont i dont want to and i wont do it the hole i make to sleep in will not be so large nor will it have such smooth sides but ill know all about it and feel safe goodmorning then he crawled into the earth and went to sleep the others went into the smooth deep holes made by the farmer with his hoe handle the next night there was only one cutworm in the garden and that was the spotted cutworm nobody has ever seen the lazy ones who chose to use the smooth deep holes which were ready made the spotted cutworm lived quite alone until he was fullgrown then he made a little oval room for himself in the ground and slept in it while he changed into a black owlet moth after that he flew away to find a wife and live among her people it is said that whenever he saw a cutworm working at night he would flutter down beside him and whisperthe cutworm who is too lazy to bore his own sleepingplace will never live to become an owlet moth from the time when she was a tiny goldengreen caterpillar miss polyphemus had wanted to go into society she began life on a maple leaf with a few brothers and sisters who hatched at the same time from a cluster of flattened eggs which their mother had laid there ten days before the first thing she remembered was the light and color and sound when she broke the shell open that may morning the first thing she did was to eat the shell out of which she had just crawled then she got acquainted with her brothers and sisters many of whom had also eaten their eggshells although two had begun at once on maple leaves it was well that she took time for this now for the family were soon scattered and several of her sisters she never saw again she found it a very lovely world to live in there was so much to eat yes and there were so many kinds of leaves that she likedoak hickory apple maple elm and several others sometimes she wished that she had three mouths instead of one in those days she had few visitors it is true that other caterpillars happened along once in a while but they were almost as hungry as she and they couldnt speak without stopping eating they could of course if they talked with their mouths full but she had too good manners for that and besides she said that if she did she couldnt enjoy her food so much you must not think that it was wrong in her to care so much about eating she was only doing what is expected of a polyphemus caterpillar and you would have to do the same if you were a polyphemus caterpillar when she was ten days old she had to weigh ten times as much as she did the morning that she was hatched when she was twenty days old she had to weigh sixty times as much when she was a month old she had to weigh six hundred and twenty times as much and when she was fifty days old she had to weigh four thousand times as much as she did at hatching every bit of this flesh was made of the food she ate that is why eating was so important you know and if she had chosen to eat the wrong kind of leaves just because they tasted good she would never have become such a fine great caterpillar as she did she might better not eat anything than to eat the wrong sort and she knew it still she often wished that she had more time for visiting and thought that she would be very gay next year when she got her wings ill make up for it then she said to herself when my growing is done and i have time for play then she ate some more good plain food for she knew that there would be no happy mothtimes for caterpillars who did not eat as they should she had five vacations of about a day each when she ate nothing at all these were the times when she changed her skin crawling out of the tight old one and appearing as fresh and clean as possible in the new one which was ready underneath after her last change she was ready to plan her cocoon and she was a most beautiful caterpillar she was about as long as a small cherry leaf and as plump as a caterpillar can be she was light green with seven slanting yellow lines on each side of her body and a purplishbrown vshaped mark on the back part of each side there were many little orangecolored bunches on her body which showed beautiful gleaming lights when she moved growing out of these bunches were tiny tufts of bristles she had three pairs of real legs and several pairs of makebelieve ones her real legs were on the front part of her body and were slender these she expected to keep always the makebelieve ones were called prolegs they grew farther back and were fat awkward jointless things which she would not need after her cocoon was spun but for them she would have had to drag the back part of her body around like a snake with them the back part of her body could walk as well as the front although not quite so fast she always took a few steps with her real legs and then waited for her prolegs to catch up as the weather grew colder the polyphemus caterpillar hunted around on the ground for a good place for her cocoon she found an excellent twig lying among the dead leaves and decided to fasten to that then began her hardest work spinning a fluffy mass of graywhite silk which clung to the twig and to one of the dry leaves and was almost exactly the color of the leaf other caterpillars came along and stopped to visit for they did not have to eat at cocoonspinning time better fasten your cocoon to a tree said a pale bluishgreen promethea caterpillar put it inside a curled leaf like mine and wind silk around the stem to strengthen it then you can swing every time the wind blows and the silk will keep the leaf from wearing out but i dont want to swing answered the polyphemus caterpillar id rather lie still and think about things fasten to the twig of a tree
 advised a pale green cecropia caterpillar with red yellow and blue bunches then the wind just moves you a little fasten it to a twig and taper it off nicely at each end and then yes said the polyphemus caterpillar and then the bluejays and chickadees will poke wheat or corn or beechnuts into the upper end of it i dont care to turn my sleeping room into a corncrib just here some other polyphemus caterpillars came along and agreed with their relative go ahead with your tree homes said they we know what we want and well see next summer who knew best the polyphemus cocoons were spun on the ground where the dead leaves had blown in between some stones and no wandering cows or sheep would be likely to step on them first a mass of coarse silk which it took half a day to make then an inside coating of a kind of varnish then as much silk as a caterpillar could spin in four or five days next another inside varnishing and the cocoons were done as the polyphemus caterpillars snuggled down for the long winters sleep each said to himself something like this those poor caterpillars in the trees how cold they will be i hope they may come out all right in the spring but i doubt it very much and when the cecropia and promethea caterpillars dozed off for the winter they said what a pity that those polyphemus caterpillars would lie around on the ground well we advised them what to do so it isnt our fault they all had a lovely winter and swung or swayed or lay still just as they had chosen to do early in the spring the farmers wife and little girl came out to find wild flowers and scraped the leaves away from among the stones out rolled the cocoon that the first polyphemus caterpillar had spun and the farmers wife picked it up and carried it off she might have found more cocoons if the little girl had not called her away this was how it happened that one may morning a little girl stood by the sittingroom window in the white farmhouse and watched miss polyphemus crawl slowly out of her cocoon a few days before a sour milkylooking stuff had begun to trickle into the lower end of the cocoon softening the hard varnish and the soft silken threads until a tiny doorway was opened now all was ready and miss polyphemus pushed out she was very wet and weak and forlorn oh said she to herself it is more fun to be a new caterpillar than it is to be a new moth ive only six legs left and it will be very hard worrying along on these i shall have to give up walking it was discouraging you can see how it would be she had been used to having so many legs and had looked forward all the summer before to the time when she should float lightly through the air and sip honey from flowers she had dreamed of it all winter and now here she waswet and weak with only six legs left and four very small and crumpled wings her body was so big and fat that she could not hold it up from the windowsill she wanted to cryit was all so sad and disappointing she would have done so had she not remembered how very unbecoming it is to cry when she remembered that she decided to take a nap instead and that was a most sensible thing to do for crying always makes matters worse while sleeping makes them better when she awakened she felt much stronger and more cheerful she was drier and her body felt lighter this was because the fluids from it were being pumped into her wings that was making them grow and the beautiful colors began to show more brightly on them i wonder she said to herself if moths always feel so badly when they first come out if she had but known it there were at that very time hundreds of moths as helpless as she clinging to branches leaves and stones all through the forest there were many polyphemus moths just out for in their family it is the custom for all to leave their cocoons at just about such a time in the morning perhaps she would have felt more patient if she had known this for it does seem to make hard times easier to bear when one knows that everybody else has hard times also of course other people always are having trouble but she was young and really believed for a time that she was the only uncomfortable moth in the world all day long her wings were stretching and growing smooth when it grew dark she was nearly ready to fly then the farmers wife lifted her gently by the wings and put her on the inside of the wire windowscreen when the lights in the house were all put out the moonbeams shone in on miss polyphemus and showed her beautiful sandcolored body and wings with the dark border on the front pair and the lighter border on the back pair on the back ones were dark eyespots with clear places in the middle through which one could see quite clearly i would like to fly sighed miss polyphemus and i believe i could if it were not for this horrid screen she did not know that the farmers wife had put her there to keep her safe from night birds until she was quite strong the wind blew in sweet with the scent of wild cherry and shadtree blossoms and poor miss polyphemus looked over toward the forest where she had lived when she was a caterpillar and wished herself safely there much good it does me to have wings when i cannot use them said she i want something to eat there is no honey to be sucked out of wire netting i wish i were a happy caterpillar again eating leaves on the trees she was not the first moth who has wished herself a caterpillar but she soon changed her mind there fluttered toward her another polyphemus moth a handsome fellow marked exactly as she was only with darker coloring his body was more slender and his feelers were very beautiful and feathery she was fat and had slender feelers ah said he i thought i should find you soon indeed she replied i wonder what made you think that my feelers of course said he they always tell me where to find my friends you know how that is yourself i said she as she changed her position a little i am just from my cocoon this was my comingout day and so you have not met any one yet he asked ah this is a strange worlda very strange world i would advise you to be very careful with whom you make friends there are so many bad moths you know goodevening said a third voice near them and another polyphemus moth with feathery feelers alighted on the screen he smiled sweetly at miss polyphemus and scowled fiercely at the other moth it would have ended in a quarrel right then and there if a fourth moth had not come at that minute one after another came until there were nine handsome fellows on the outside and miss polyphemus on the inside of the screen trying to entertain them all and keep them from quarrelling it made her very proud to think so many were at her comingout party still she would have enjoyed it better she thought if some whom she had known as caterpillars could be there to see how much attention she was having paid to her there was one caterpillar whom she had never liked she only wished that she could see her now still society tires one very much and it was hard to keep her guests from quarrelling when she got to talking with one about mapletrees another was sure to come up and say that he had always preferred beech when he was a caterpillar and the two outside would glare at each other while she hastily thought of something else to say at last those outside got to fighting there was only one the handsomest of all who said he thought too much of his feelers to fight anybody supposing i should fight and break them off said he i couldnt smell a thing for the rest of my life he was very sensible and really the eight other fellows were fighting on account of miss polyphemus for whenever they thought she liked one best they began to bump up against him  toward morning the farmers wife awakened and looked at miss polyphemus when she saw that she was strong enough to fly she opened the screen and let her go by that time three of those with feathery feelers were dead three were brokenwinged and clinging helplessly to the screen and two were so busy fighting that they didnt see miss polyphemus go the handsome great fellow who did not believe in fighting went with her and they lived in the forest after that but she never cared for society again beyond the forest and beside the river lay the marsh where the muskrats lived this was the same marsh to which the young frog had taken some of the meadow peoples children when they were tired of staying at home and wanted to travel when they went with him you remember they were gay and happy the sun was shining and the way did not seem long when they came back they were cold and wet and tired and thought it very far indeed one could never get them to say much about it some people like what others do not and ones opinion of a marsh must always depend on whether he is a grasshopper or a frog but whether people cared to live there or not the marsh had always been a pleasant place to see in the spring the tall tamaracks along the edge put on their new dresses of soft needleshaped green leaves the marshmarigolds held their bright faces up to the sun and hundreds of happy little people darted in and out of the tussocks of coarse grass there was a warm wet earthy smell in the air and near the pussywillows there was also a faint bitterness then the marsh hens made their nests and the sandpipers ran mincingly along by the quiet pools in summer time the beautiful moccasin flowers grew in family groups and over in the higher dryer part were masses of white boneset tall spikes of creamy foxglove and slender purple vervain in the fall the cattails stood stiffly among their yellow leaves and the redwinged blackbirds and the bobolinks perched upon them to plan their journey to the south even when the birds were gone and the cattails were ragged and worneven then the marsh was an interesting place soft snow clung to the brown seed clusters of boneset and filled the open silverygray
 pods of the milkweed in among the brown tussocks of grass ran the dainty footprints of mice and minks and here and there rose the coneshaped winter homes of the muskrats the muskrats were the largest people there and lived in the finest homes it is true that if a mink and a muskrat fought the mink was likely to get the better of the muskrat but people never spoke of this although everybody knew that it was so the muskrats were too proud to do so the minks were too wise to and the smaller people who lived near did not want to offend the muskrats by mentioning it it is said that an impudent young mouse did say something about it once when the muskrats could overhear him and that not one of them ever spoke to him again the next time he said goodevening to a muskrat the muskrat just looked at him as though he didnt see him or as though he had been a stick or a stone or something else uneatable and uninteresting the muskrats were very popular for they were kind neighbors and never stole their food from others that was why nobody was jealous of them although they were so fat and happy their children usually turned out very well even if they were not at all strictly brought up you know when a father and mother have to feed and care for fifteen or so children each summer there is not much time for teaching them to say please and thank you and pardon me sometimes these young muskrats did snatch and quarrel as on that night when fifteen of them went to visit their old home and all wanted to go in first you may recall how on that dreadful night their father had to spank them with his scaly tail and their mother sent them to bed they always remembered it and you may be very sure their parents did it makes parents feel dreadfully when their children quarrel and it is very wearing to have to spank fifteen at once particularly when one has to use his tail with which to do it there was one old bachelor muskrat who had always lived for himself and had his own way more than was good for him if he had married it would not have been so and he would have grown used to giving up to somebody else he was a finelooking fellow with soft short reddishbrown fur which shaded almost to black on his back and to a light gray underneath there were very few hairs on his long flat scaly tail and most of these were in two fringes one down the middle of the upper side and the other down the middle of the lower side his tiny ears hardly showed above the fur on his head and he was so fat that he really seemed to have no neck at all to look at his feet you would hardly think he could swim for the webs between his toes were very very small and his feet were not large he was like all other muskrats in using a great deal of perfume and it was not a pleasant kind being so strong and musky he thought it quite right and it was better so for he couldnt help wearing it and you can just imagine how distressing it would be to see a muskrat going around with his nose turned up and all the time finding fault with his own perfume nobody could remember the time when there had been no muskrats in the marsh the ground hog who lived near the edge of the forest said that his grandfather had often spoken of seeing them at play in the moonlight and there was an old rattlesnake who had been married several times and wore fourteen joints in his rattle who said that he remembered seeing muskrats there before he cast his first skin and it was not strange that after their people had lived there so long the muskrats should be fond of the marsh one day in midsummer the farmer and his men came to the marsh with spades and grubhoes and measuring lines all of them had on high rubber boots and they tramped around and measured and talked and rooted up a few huckleberry bushes and drove a good many stakes into the soft and spongy ground then the dinnerbell at the farmhouse rang and they went away it was a dull cloudy day and a few of the muskrats were out if it had been sunshiny they would have stayed in their burrows they paddled over to where the stakes were and smelled of them and gnawed at them and wondered why the men had put them there i know said one young muskrat who had married and set up a home of his own that spring i know why they put these stakes in oh do listen cried the young muskrats wife he knows and will tell us all about it nobody ever told me this said the young husband i thought it out myself the ground hog once said that they put small pieces of potato into the ground to grow into whole big ones and they have done the same sort of thing here you see the farmer wanted a fence and so he stuck down these stakes and before winter he will have a fence well grown humph said the bachelor muskrat it seemed as though he had meant to say more but the young wife looked at him with such a frown on her furry forehead that he shut his mouth as tightly as he could he never could quite close it and said nothing else do you mean to tell me said one who had just sent five children out of her burrow to make room for another lot of babies that they will grow a fence here where it is so wet fences grow on high land that is what i said answered the young husband slapping his tail on the water to make himself seem more important well said the anxious mother if they go to growing fences and such things around here i shall move every one of my children will want to play around it and as like as not will eat its roots and get sick then the men came back and all the muskrats ran toward their burrows dived into the water to reach the doors of them and then crawled up the long hallways that they had dug out of the bank until they got to the large rooms where they spent most of their days and kept their babies that night the young husband was the first muskrat to come out and he went at once to the line of stakes he had been lying awake and thinking while his wife was asleep and he was afraid he had talked too much he found that the stakes had not grown any and that the men had begun to dig a deep ditch beside them he was afraid that his neighbors would point their paws at him and ask how the fence was growing and he was not brave enough to meet them and say that he had been mistaken he went down the river bank and fed alone all night while his wife and neighbors were grubbing and splashing around in the marsh or swimming in the river near their homes the young muskrats were rolling and tumbling in the moonlight and looking like furry brown balls after it began to grow light he sneaked back to his burrow every day the men came in their high rubber boots to work and every day there were more ditches and the marsh was drier by the time that the flowers had all ripened their seeds and the forest trees were bare the marsh was changed to dry ground and the muskrats could find no water there to splash in one night and it was a very very dark one they came together to talk about winter it is time to begin our coldweather houses said one old muskrat i have never started so soon but we are to have an early winter yes and a long one too added his wife who said that mr muskrat never told things quite strongly enough it will be cold said another muskrat and we shall need to build thick walls why asked a little muskrat sh said his mother the question is said the old muskrat who had first spoken where we shall build why asked the little muskrat pulling at his mothers tail shh said his mother there is no water here except in the ditches said the oldest muskrat and of course we would not build beside them why not asked the little muskrat and this time he actually poked his mother in the side shhh said she how many times must i speak to you dont you know that young muskrats should be seen and not heard but i cant be seen he whimpered it is so dark that i cant be seen and youve just got to hear me of course after he had spoken in that way to his mother and interrupted all the others by his naughtiness he had to be punished so his mother sent him to bed that is very hard for young muskrats for the night you know is the time when they have the most fun the older ones talked and talked about what they should do they knew as they always do know just what sort of winter they were to have and that they must begin to build at once some years they had waited until a whole month later but that was because they expected a late and mild winter at last the oldest muskrat decided for them we will move tomorrow night said he we will go to the swamp on the other side of the forest and build our winter homes there all the muskrats felt sad about going and for a minute it was so still that you might almost have heard a milkweed seed break loose from the pod and float away then a gruff voice broke the silence i will not go it said i was born here and i will live here i never have left this marsh and i never will leave it they could not see who was speaking but they knew it was the bachelor the oldest muskrat said afterward that he was so surprised you could have knocked him over with a blade of grass of course you couldnt have done it because he was so fat and heavy but that is what he said and it shows just how he felt the other muskrats talked and talked and talked with him but it made no difference his brothers told him it was perfectly absurd for him to stay that people would think it queer and that he ought to go with the rest of his relatives yet it made no difference you should stay he would reply our family have always lived here when the muskrat mothers told him how lonely he would be and how he would miss seeing the dear little ones frolic in the moonlight he blinked and said well i shall just have to stand it then he sighed and they went away saying to each other what a tender heart he had and what a pity it was that he had never married one of them spoke as though he had been in love with her some years before but
 the others had known nothing about it the muskrat fathers told him that he would have no one to help him if a mink should pick a quarrel with him i can take care of myself then said he and showed his strong gnawing teeth in a very fierce way it was only when the dainty young muskrat daughters talked to him that he began to wonder if he really ought to stay he lay awake most of one day thinking about it and remembering the sad look in their little eyes when they said that they should miss him he was so disturbed that he ate only three small roots during the next night the poor old bachelor had a hard time then but he was so used to having his own way and doing what he had started to do and not giving up to anybody that he stayed after all the others went away and he began to build his winter house beside the biggest ditch he placed it among some bushes so that if the water in the ditch should ever overflow they would help hold his house in place he built it with his mouth bringing great mouthfuls of grass roots and rushes and dropping them on the middle of the heap sometimes they stayed there and sometimes they rolled down if they rolled down he never brought them back for he knew that they would be useful where they were when it was done the house was shaped like a pine cone with the stem end down for after he had made it as high as a tall milkweed he finished off the long slope up which he had been running and made it look like the other sides after that he began to burrow up into it from below the right way to do he knew was to have his doorway under water and dive down to it other winters he had done this and had given the water a loud slap with his tail as he dived now there was not enough water to dive into and when he tried slapping on it his tail went through to the ditch bottom and got muddy he had to fix the doorway as best he could and then he ate out enough of the inside of his house to make a good room and poked a small hole through the roof to let in fresh air after the house was done he slept there during the days and prowled around outside at night he slept there but ate none of the roots of which it was made until the water in the ditch was frozen hard he knew that there would be a long long time when he could not dig fresh roots and must live on those at night the marsh seemed so empty and lonely that he hardly knew what to do he didnt enjoy his meals and often complained to the mice that the roots did not taste so good to him as those they used to have when he was young he tried eating other things and found them no better when there was bright moonlight he sat upon the highest tussock he could find and thought about his grandfathers and grandmothers if they had not eaten their houses he once said to a mouse this marsh would be full of them no it wouldnt answered the mouse who didnt really mean to contradict him but thought him much mistaken if the houses hadnt been eaten they would have been blown down by the wind and beaten down by rains and washed away by floods it is better so who wants things to stay the way they are forever and ever id rather see the trees drop their leaves once in a while and grow new ones than to wear the same old ones after they are ragged and faded the bachelor muskrat didnt like this very well but he couldnt forget it when he awakened in the daytime he would think about it and at night he thought more he was really very forlorn and because he had nobody else to think about he thought too much of himself and began to believe that he was lame and sick when he sat on a tussock and remembered all the houses which his grandparents had built and eaten he became very sad and sighed until his fat sides shook he wished that he could sleep through the winter like the ground hog or through part of it like the skunk but just as sure as night came his eyes popped open and there he wasawake when spring came he thought of his friends who had gone to the swamp and he knew that last years children were marrying and digging burrows of their own the poor old bachelor wanted to go to them yet he was so used to doing what he had said he would and disliked so much to let anybody know that he was mistaken that he chose to stay where he was without water enough for diving and with hardly enough for swimming how it would have ended nobody knows had the farmer not come to plough up the old drained marsh for planting celery then the bachelor went he reached his new home in the early morning and the mothers let their children stay up until it was quite light so that he might see them plainly isnt it pleasant here they cried dont you like it better than the old place oh it does very well he answered but you must remember that i only moved because i had to oh yes we understand that said one of the mothers but we hope you will really like it here afterward her husband said to her dont you know he was glad to come whats the use of being so polite poor old fellow she answered he is so queer because he lives alone and im sorry for him just see him eat and truly it was worth while to watch him for the roots tasted sweet to him and although he had not meant to be he was very happyfar happier than if he had had his own way the red fox had been well brought up his mother was a most cautious person and devoted to her children when he did things which were wrong he could never excuse himself by saying that he did not know better of course it is possible that he was like his father in being so reckless yet none of his two brothers and three sisters were like him they did not remember their father in fact they had never seen him and their mother seldom spoke of him his mother had taken all the care of her six children even pulling fur from her own belly to make a soft nest covering for them when they were first born they were such helpless babies their eyes and ears were closed for some time and all they could do was to tumble each other around and drink the warm milk that their mother had for them they had three burrows to live in all of them in an open field between the forest and the farmhouse sometimes they lived in the first sometimes in the second and sometimes in the third one night when their mother went out to hunt she smelled along the ground near the burrow and then came back there has been a man near here she said and i shall take you away that excited the little foxes very much and each wanted to be the first to go but she hushed them up and said that if they talked so loudly as that some man might catch them before they moved and then she said nothing more yet they knew from the way she moved her tail that it would be dreadful to have a man catch them while she was carrying them to another burrow one at a time those who were left behind talked about men i wish i knew why men are so dreadful said the first it must be because they have very big mouths and sharp teeth i wonder what color their fur is said another now these young foxes had seen nobody but their mother if she had not told them that different animals wore different colored furs they would have thought that everybody looked just like her with long reddishyellow fur and that on the hinder part of the back quite grizzled throat belly and the tip of the tail white and the outside of the ears black they were very sure however that no other animal had such a wonderful tail as she with each of its long reddish hairs tipped with black and the beautiful brush of pure white at the end in fact she had told them so the next time their mother came back the four children who were still there cried out please tell us what color is a mans fur she was a sensible and prudent fox and knew it was much more important to keep her children from being caught than it was to answer all their questions at once besides she already had one child in her mouth when they finished their question and she would not put him down for the sake of talking and that also was right you know for one can talk at any time but the time to do work is just when it needs to be done after they were snugly settled in the other burrow she lay down to feed them and while they were drinking their milk she told them about men men she said are the most dreadful animals there are other animals will not trouble you unless they are hungry but a man will chase you even when his stomach is full they have four legs of courseall animals havebut they use only two to walk upon their front legs they use for carrying things we carry with our mouths yet the only thing i ever saw a man have in his mouth was a short brown stick that was afire at one end i thought it very silly for he couldnt help breathing some of the smoke and he let the stick burn up and then threw the fire away however men are exceedingly silly animals one of the little red foxes stopped drinking long enough to say you didnt tell us what color their fur is the only fur they have said mother fox is on their heads they usually have fur on the top and back parts of their heads and some of them have a little on the lower part of their faces they may have black red brown gray or white fur it is never spotted the children would have liked to ask more questions but mother fox had eaten nothing since the night before and was in a hurry to begin her hunt one could never tell all that happened to the little red foxes they moved from burrow to burrow many times they learned to eat meat which their mother brought them instead of drinking milk from her body they frolicked together near the doorway of their home and while they did this their mother watched from the edge of the forest ready to warn them if she saw men or dogs coming she had chosen to dig her burrows in the middle of a field because then there was no chance for men or dogs to sneak up to them unseen as there would have been in the forest yet she feared that her children would be playing
 so hard that they might forget to watch they slept most of the day and at night they were always awake when they were old enough they began to hunt for themselves mother fox gave them a great deal of good advice and then paid no more attention to them after that she took her naps on a sunny hillside lying in a beautiful soft reddishyellow bunch with her bushy tail curled around to keep her feet warm and shade her eyes from the light the six brothers and sisters seldom saw each other after this foxes succeed better in life if they live alone and of course they wanted to succeed the eldest brother was the reckless one his mother had done her best by him and still he was reckless he knew by heart all the rules that she had taught him but he did not keep them these were the rules always run on hard dry things when you can soft wet places take more scent from your feet and dogs can follow your trail better on them never go into any place unless you are sure you can get out keep your tail dry a fox with a wet tail cannot run well if dogs are chasing you jump on to a rail fence and run along the top of it or walk in a brook always be willing to work for your food that which you find all ready and waiting for you may be the bait of a trap always walk when you are hunting the fox who trots will pass by that which he should find for a while he said them over to himself every night when he started out then he began to skip a night once in a while next he got to saying them only when he had been frightened the day before after that he stopped saying them altogether i am a fullgrown fox now he said to himself and such things are only good for children i guess i know how to take care of myself he often went toward the farmhouse to hunt sometimes for grapes sometimes for vegetables and sometimes for heartier food collie had chased him away but collie was growing old and fat and had to hang his tongue out when he ran so the red fox thought it only fun he trotted along in the moonlight his light slender body seeming to almost float over the ground and his beautiful tail held straight out behind his short slender legs were strong and did not tire easily and as long as he could keep his tall dry he outran collie easily sometimes he would get far ahead and sit down to wait for him then he would call out saucy things to the panting dog and only start on when collies nose had almost touched him fine evening he once said hope your nose works better than your legs do that was a mean thing to say you know but collie always keeps his temper and only answered its sweating finely thank you he answered that way because it is the sweat on a dogs nose which makes it possible for him to smell and follow scents which drynosed people do not even know about then the fox gave a long light leap and was off again and collie had to lie down to breathe i think said he that i can tend sheep better than i can chase foxesand it is a good deal easier still collie didnt like to be beaten and he lay awake the rest of the night thinking how he would enjoy catching that fox every little while he heard the red fox barking off in the fields and it made him twitch his tail with impatience now the red fox was walking carefully toward the farmhouse and planning to catch a turkey he had watched the flocks of turkeys all afternoon from his sleepingplace on the hillside every time he opened his eyes between naps he had looked at them as they walked to and fro in the fields talking to each other in their gentle complaining voices and moving their heads back and forth at every step if his stomach had not been so full he would have tried to catch one then he made up his mind to try it that night and decided that he would rather have the plump lightcolored one than any of her darker sisters he did not even think of catching the old gobbler for he was so big and strong and fiercelooking he had just begun to walk with the turkey mothers and children during the summer they had had nothing to do with each other when the red fox reached the farmyard he found them roosting on the low branches of an appletree a long board had been placed against it to let the chickens walk up now the chickens were in the henhouse but the board was still there the red fox looked all around it was a starlight night the farmhouse was dark and quiet collie was nowhere to be seen once he heard a horse stamp in his sleep then all was still again the red fox walked softly up the slanting board the gobbler stirred the red fox stopped with one foot in the air when he thought him fast asleep he went on the gobbler stirred again and so did the others the red fox sprang for the plump lightcolored one she jumped also and with the others flew far up to the top of the barn the red fox ran down the board with five buff tailfeathers in his mouth he was much out of patience with himself if i hadnt stopped to pick for her he said i could have caught one of the others easily enough he sneaked around in the shadows to see if the noise made by the turkeys had awakened the farmer or collie the farmhouse was still and dark collie was not at home i will look at the henhouse said the red fox he walked slowly and carefully to the henhouse the big door was closed and bolted he walked all around and into the poultry yard there was a small opening through which the fowls could pass in and out the red fox managed to crawl though but it was not easy it squeezed his body and crushed his fur he had to push very hard with his hind feet to get through at all when he was inside it took him some time to get his breath thats the tightest place i ever was in said he softly but i always could crawl through a very small hole he found the fowls all roosting too high for him perhaps if the henhouse had been larger he might have leaped and caught one but there was not room for one of his finest springs he went to the nests and found many eggs there these he broke and ate they ran down in yellow streams from the corners of his mouth and made his long fur very sticky you can just imagine how hard it would be to eat raw eggs from the shell with only your paws in which to hold them one egg was light and slippery he bit hard to break that one and when it broke it was hollow not a drop of anything to eat in it and then it cut his lip a little too so that he could not eat more without its hurting he jumped and said something when he was cut the shanghai cock who was awakened by the noise said that he exclaimed brambles and traps but it may not have been anything so bad as that we will hope it was not the shanghai cock awakened all the other fowls dont fly off your perch he cried stay where you are stay where where you are stay where you are the other cocks kept saying eruuuu as they do when hawks are near the hens squawked and squawked and squawked until they were out of breath when they got their breath they squawked some more the red fox knew that it was time for him to go the farmer would be sure to hear the noise he put his head out of the hole through which he had come in and he pushed as hard as he could with his hind feet and scrambled with his fore feet his fur was crushed worse than ever and he was squeezed so tightly that he could hardly breathe you see it had been all he could do to get in through the hole and now he had nine eggs in his stomach excepting what had run down at the corners of his mouth and he was too large to pass through the fowls saw what was the matter and wanted to laugh they thought it very funny and yet the sooner he could get away the better they would like it the red fox had his head outside and saw a light flash in the farmers room then he heard doors open and the farmer came toward the henhouse with a lantern in his hand collie came trotting around the corner of the house the red fox made one last desperate struggle and then lay still when the farmer picked him up and tied a rope around his neck he had to pull him backward into the henhouse to do it the red fox was very quiet and gentle as people of his family always are when caught collie pranced around on two legs and barked as loudly as he could the fowls blinked their round yellow eyes in the lantern light and the farmers man ran out for an empty chickencoop into which to put the red fox collie was usually quite polite but he had not forgotten how rude the red fox had been to him and it was a fine chance to get even good evening he barked oh good evening im glad you came dont think you must be going excuse me but your mouth worked better than your legs didnt it the red fox shut his eyes and pretended not to hear the dirt from the floor of the henhouse had stuck to his eggcovered fur and he looked very badly they put him in a chickencoop with a board floor so that he couldnt burrow out and he curled down in a little heap and hid his face with his tail collie hung around for a while and then went off to sleep after he was gone the red fox cleaned his fur i got caught this time he said but it wont happen again now i must watch for a chance to get away it will surely come it did come but that is another story several very large families of fireflies lived in the marsh and were much admired by their friends who were awake at night once in a while some young firefly who happened to awaken during the day would go out and hover over the heads of the daylight people he never had any attention paid to him then however for during the day he seemed like a very commonplace little beetle and nobody even cared to look at him a second time the only remarkable thing about him was the soft light that shone from his body and that could only be seen at night the older fireflies told the younger ones that they should get all the sleep they could during the daytime if they were to flutter and frisk all night most of them did this but two young fireflies who cared more about seeing
 the world than they did about minding their elders used to run away while the rest were dreaming each thought herself very important and was sure that if the others missed her they wouldnt sleep a wink all day one night they planned to go by daylight to the farthest corner of the marsh they had heard a couple of young muskrats talking about it and thought it might be different from anything they had seen they went to bed when the rest did and pretended to fall asleep when she was sure that the older fireflies were dreaming one of them reached over with her right hind leg and touched the other just below the edge of her left wingcover are you ready she whispered yes answered the friend who happened to be the smaller of the two come on then said the larger one picking her way along on her six tiptoes it was already growing light and they could see where they stepped but you know it is hard to walk over rough places on two tiptoes so you can imagine what it must be on six there are some pleasant things about having many legs there are also some hard things it is a great responsibility when well away from their sleeping relatives they lifted their wingcovers spread their wings and flew to the farthest corner of the marsh they were not afraid of being punished if caught for they were orphans and had nobody to bring them up they were afraid that if the other fireflies awakened they would be called silly or foolish young bugs they thought that they were old enough to take care of themselves and did not want advice oh wouldnt they make a fuss if they knew exclaimed the larger firefly they think we need to be told every single thing said the smaller firefly guess were old enough now to go off by ourselves said the larger firefly i guess so answered the smaller firefly im not afraid if it is light and i can see pretty near as well as i can at night just then a flycatcher darted toward them and they had to hide he had come so near that they could look down his throat as he flew along with his beak open the fireflies were so scared that their feelers shook i wish that bird would mind his own business grumbled the larger firefly thats just what he was doing said a voice beside them as a garter snake drew himself through the grass then their feelers shook again for they knew that snakes do not breakfast on grass and berries did you ever see such luck said the smaller firefly if it isnt birds it is snakes perfectly dreadful answered the other i never knew the marsh to be so full of horrid people besides my eyes are bothering me and i cant see plainly so are mine said the smaller firefly are you going to tell the other fireflies all about things tonight i dont know that i will said the larger firefly ill make them ask me first then they reached the farther corner of the marsh and crawled around to see what they could find their eyes bothered them so that they could not see unless they were close to things so it was useless to fly they peeped into the cool dark corners under the skunk cabbage leaves and lay down to rest on a bed of soft moss a few stalks of last years teazles stood stiff and brown in the corner of the fence the smaller firefly alighted on one and let go in such a hurry that she fell to the ground ouch she cried it has sharp hooks all over it while they were lying on the moss and resting they noticed a queer plant growing near it had a flower of green and dark red which was unlike any other blossom they had ever seen the leaves were even queerer each was stiff and hollow and grew right out of the ground instead of coming from a stalk im going to crawl into one of them said the larger firefly there is something sweet inside i believe it will be lots better than the skunk cabbage she balanced herself on the top of a fresh green leaf im going into this one said the other firefly as she alighted on the edge of a browntipped leaf it looks nice and dark inside we must tell about this at the party tonight even if they dont ask us then they repeated together the little verse that some of the pond people use when they want to start together  tussock mud water and log  muskrat snake turtle and frog  here we go into the bog when they said bog each dropped quickly into her own leaf for a minute nobody made a sound then there was a queer sputtering choking voice in the fresh green leaf and exactly the same in the browntipped one after that a weak little voice in the green leaf said abuschougerh i fell into water another weak voice from the browntipped one replied gtschagust so did i on the inside of each leaf were many stiff hairs all pointing downward when the fireflies dropped in they had brushed easily past these hairs and thought it rather pleasant now that they were sputtering and choking inside and wanted to get out these same hairs stuck into their eyes and pushed against their legs and made them exceedingly uncomfortable the water too had stood for some time in the leaves and did not smell good perhaps it would be just as well not to tell all the things which those two fireflies said for they were tired and out of patience after a while they gave up trying to get out until they should be rested it was after sunset when they tried the last time and the light that shone from their bellies brightened the little green rooms where they were they rested and went at it carefully instead of in the angry jerky way which they had tried before slowly one foot at a time they managed to climb out of the doorway at the top as they came out they heard the squeaky voice of a young mouse say oh where did those bright things come from they also heard his mother answer those are only a couple of foolish fireflies who have been in the leaves of the pitcherplant all day after they had eaten something they flew toward home they knew that it would be late for the party and they expected to surprise and delight everybody when they reached there on the way they spoke of this im dreadfully tired said one but i suppose we shall have to dance in the air with the rest or they will make a fuss yes said the other it spoils everything if we are not there and well have to tell where weve been and what weve done and whom we have seen when we would rather go to sleep and make up what we lost during the daytime as they came near the middle of the marsh they were surprised to see the mild summer air twinkling with hundreds of tiny lights as their friends and relatives flew to and fro in the dusk well said the larger firefly i think they might have waited for us humph said the smaller firefly if they cant be more polite than that i wont play after weve had such a dreadfully hard time too said the larger firefly got most eaten by a flycatcher and scared by a garter snake and shut up all day in the pitcherplant i wont move a wing to help on their old party so two very tired and cross young fireflies sat on a last years cattail and sulked people didnt notice them because they were sitting and their bright bellies didnt show after a long time an elderly firefly came to rest on the cattail and found them good evening said he have you danced until you are tired they looked at each other but before either could speak one of their young friends alighted beside them and said the same thing then the smaller firefly answered we have been away said she and we are not dancing tonight going away did you say asked the elderly firefly who was rather deaf i hope you will have a delightful time then he bowed and flew off dont stay long added their young friend we shall be so lonely without you after he also was gone the two runaways looked into each others eyes we were not even missed they cried we had a bad time and nobody makes any fuss they were dancing without us poor little fireflies they were much wiser after that for they had learned that two young fireflies were not so wonderfully important after all and that if they chose to do things which it was never meant young fireflies should do they would be likely to have a very disagreeable time but that other fireflies would go on eating and dancing and living their own lives to be happy they must keep the firefly laws one day the three big kittens who lived with their mother in the farmers barn had a dreadful quarrel if their mother had been with them she would probably have cuffed each with her fore paw and scolded them soundly she was not with them because she had four little new kittens lying beside her in the hayloft over the stalls you would think that the older kittens must have been very proud of their baby brothers and sisters yet they were not they might have done kind little things for their mother but they didnt they just hunted food for themselves and never took a mouthful of it to her and this does not prove that they were bad kittens it just shows that they were young and thoughtless the brown kitten the one whose fur was black and yellow mixed so finely as to look brown had climbed the barn stairs to see them when he reached their corner he sat down and growled at them his mother said nothing at first but when he went so far as to switch his tail in a threatening way she left her new babies and sprang at him and told him not to show his whiskers upstairs again until he could behave properly his sisters the yellow kitten and the white kitten stayed downstairs they didnt dislike babies so much as their brother they just didnt care anything about them cats never care much about kittens you know unless they are their own and big brothers always say that they cant bear them now these three older kittens were perfectly able to care for themselves it was a long time since their mother stopped feeding them and they were already excellent hunters they had practised crouching crawling and springing before they left the hayloft sometimes they hunted wisps of hay that moved when the wind blew in through the open door
 sometimes they pounced on each other and sometimes they hunted the grasshoppers who got brought in with the hay it was when they were doing this once that they were so badly scared but that is a story which has already been told there was no reason why they should feel neglected or worry about getting enough to eat if one of them had poor luck in hunting all he had to do was to hang around the barn when the cows were brought up and go into the house with the man when he carried the great pails full of foamy milk then if the kittens acted hungry mewed very loudly and rubbed up lovingly against the farmers wife they were sure to get a good dishful of warm milk you can see how unreasonable they were they had plenty to eat and their mother loved them just as much as ever but they felt hurt and sulked around in corners and answered each other quite rudely and would not run after a string which the farmers little girl dangled before them they were not cross all the time because they had been up the whole night and had to sleep they stopped being cross when they fell asleep and began again as soon as they awakened the hens who were feeding around became so used to it that as soon as they saw a kitten twist and squirm and act like awakening they put their heads down and ran away as fast as they could they did not even keep themselves clean oh they licked themselves over two or three times during the day but not thoroughly the yellow kitten did not once try to catch her tail and scrub it and actually wore an unwashed tail all day it didnt show very plainly because it was yellow but that made it no cleaner the white kitten went around with her fore paws looking really disgraceful the brown kitten scrubbed his ears in a sort of halfhearted way and paid no attention to the place under his chin when he did his ears he gave his paw one lick and his ear one rub and repeated this only six times everybody knows that a truly tidy cat wets his paw with two licks cleans his ear with two rubs and does this over and over from twenty to forty times before he begins on the other ear toward night they quarrelled over a dishful of milk which the farmers wife gave them there was plenty of room for them all to put their heads into the dish at once and lap until each had his share if it had not been for their whiskers there would have been no trouble these hit and each told the others to step back and wait nobody did and there was such a fuss that the farmers wife took the dish away and none of them had any more they began to blame each other and talk so loudly that the man drove them all away as fast as they could scamper now that they were separated each began to grow more and more discontented the brown kitten had crawled under the carriage house and as soon as it was really dark he stole off to the forest my mother has more kittens he said and my sisters get my whiskers all out of shape and ill go away and never come back i wont say goodby to them either i guess theyll feel badly then and wish theyd been nicer to me if they ever find me and want me to come back i wont go not if they beg and beg ill just turn my tail toward them and walk away the brown kitten knew that cats sometimes went to live in the woods and got along very well he was not acquainted with one who had done this his mother had told him and his sisters stories of cats who chose to live so she said that was one thing which showed how much more clever they were than dogs dogs you know cannot live happily away from men although there may be the best of hunting around them i will find a good hollow tree said he for my home and i will sleep there all day and hunt at night i will eat so much that i shall grow large and strong then when i go out to hunt the forest people will say sh here comes the brown cat as he thought this he was running softly along the country road toward the forest once in a while he stopped to listen and stood with his head raised and turned and one fore foot in the air he kept his ears pointed forward all the time so as to hear better when he passed the marsh he saw the fireflies dancing in the air sometimes they flew so low that a kitten might catch them he thought he would try so he crawled through the fence and toward the place where they were dancing he passed two tired ones sitting on a leaf and never saw them that was because their wings covered their sides so well that no light shone past and their bright bellies were close to the leaf he had almost reached the dancers when he found his paws getting wet and muddy that made him turn back at once for mud was something he couldnt stand i wish i had something to eat he said as he took a bite of catnip this is very good for a relish but not for a whole meal he trotted on toward the forest thinking about milk and fireflies and several other things when he was stopped by some great winged person flying down toward him and then sweeping upward and alighting on a branch the brown kitten drew back stiffly and said haaah who who to who asked the person on the branch the brown kitten answered it is i but the question came again who who to who that made the brown kitten remember that since his voice was not known in the forest nobody could tell anything by his answer this time he replied i am the brown kitten if you please and i have come to live in the forest who who to who was the next question and the brown kitten thought he was asked to whose home he was going i am not going to anybody he said i just wanted to come and left my old home suddenly i shall live alone and have a good time i didnt even tell my mother who who to who said the great horned owl for it was he my mmother said the brown kitten and then he ran away as fast as he could he had seen the owl more clearly as he spoke and the owls face reminded him a little of his mother and made him want to see her he ran so fast that he almost bumped into the skunk who was taking a dignified stroll through the forest and sniffing at nearly everything he saw it was very lucky you know that he did not quite run into the skunk for skunks do not like to be run into and if he had done so other people would soon have been sniffing at him the brown kitten thought that the skunk might be related to him they were about the same size and the brown kitten had been told that his relatives were not only different colors but different shapes his mother had told of seeing some manx kittens who had no tails at all and he thought that the skunks elegant longhaired one neednt prevent his being a cat good evening said the brown kitten would you mind telling me if you are a cat cat no growled the skunk they sometimes call me a woodkitty but they have no right to i am a skunk skunk skunk and i am related to the weasles step out of my path a family of young raccoons in a tree called down teasingly to him to come up but after he had started they told him to go down and then laughed at him because he had to go tail first he did not know that forest climbers turn the toes of their hind feet backward and scamper down head first still it would have made no difference if he had known for his toes wouldnt turn he found something to eat now and then and he looked for a hollow tree he found only one and that was a bee tree so he couldnt use it all around him the most beautiful mushrooms were pushing up from the ground white yellow orange red and brown they were and looked so plump and fair that he wanted to bite them he knew however that some of them were very poisonous so he didnt even lick them with his eager rough little pink tongue he was just losing his kitten teeth and his new cat teeth were growing and they made him want to bite almost everything he saw one kind of mushroom which he thought the prettiest of all grew only on the trunks of fallen beech trees it was white and had a great many little branches all very close together most of the plants which he saw were sound asleep every plant has to sleep you know and most of them take a long nap at night some of them like the waterlilies also sleep on cloudy days he was very fond of the clovers but they had their leaflets folded tight and only the mushrooms the evening primroses and a few others were wide awake everybody whom he met was a stranger and he began to feel very lonely cats do not usually mind being alone indeed they rather like it still you can see how hard it would be for a kitten who had always been loved and cared for to find himself alone in a dark forest where great birds ask the same questions over and over and other people make fun of him you wouldnt like it yourself if you were a kitten at last when he was prowling along an old forest road and hoping to meet a tender young woodmouse he saw a couple of lightcolored animals ahead of him they looked to him very much like kittens but he remembered how the skunk had snubbed him when taken for a cat and he kept still he ran to overtake them and see more clearly and just as he reached them they all came to a turn in the road before he could speak or they could notice that he was there the wind roared through the branches above and just ahead two terrible great eyes glared at them out of an old log they all stopped with their backfur bristling and their tails arched stiffly not a sound did one of them make they lifted first one foot and then another and backed slowly and silently away when they had gone far enough they turned quickly and ran down the old road as fast as their twelve feet could carry them they never stopped until they were in the road for home and could look back in the starlight and be sure that nobody was following them then they stared at each otherthe yellow kitten the white kitten and the brown kitten did you run away to live in the forest asked the sisters did you asked the brown kitten youll never tell said they never said he well then we did run
 away and met each other just before you came we meant to live in the forest so did i said he and i couldnt find any hollow tree did you meet that dreadful bird said theythe one who never hears your answers and keeps asking you over and over yes said he dont you ever tell haha screamed a laughing little screechowl who had seen what had happened in the old forest road and flapped along noiselessly behind them three big kittens afraid of foxfire oho oho now all of them had heard about foxfire and knew it was the light which shines from some kinds of rotten wood in the dark but they held up their heads and answered were not afraid of foxfire haha screamed the screechowl again thought you saw big eyes glaring at you only foxfire dare you to come back if you are not afraid we dont want to go back answered the brown kitten we havent time haha screamed the screechowl havent time where are you going going home of course answered the brown kitten and then he whispered to his sisters lets all right said they and they raced down the road as fast as they could go to this day their mother does not know that they ever ran away from home but it was only foxfire the weasels were very unpopular with most of the forest people the pond and meadow people did not like them and those who lived in the farmyard couldnt bear them something went wrong there every time that a weasel came to call once you know the dorking hen was so frightened that she broke her wonderful shiny egg and there were other times when even worse things had happened usually there was a chicken or two missing after the weasel had gone the weasels were very fond of their own family however and would tell their best secrets to each other that meant almost as much with them as to share food for they were very inquisitive and always wanted to know all about everything they minded their own business but they minded everybodys else as well if you told a thing to one weasel you might be sure that before the night was over every weasel in the neighborhood would know all about it they told other people too when they had a chance they were dreadful gossips if they saw a person do something the least unusual they thought about it and talked about it and wondered what it meant and decided that it meant something very remarkable and became very much excited at such times they made many excuses to go calling and always managed to tell about what they had seen what they had heard and what they were perfectly certain it meant they went everywhere and could go quietly and without being noticed they were small people about as long as rats but much more slender and with such short legs that their bodies seemed to almost lie on the ground all their fur was brown except that on their bellies and the inside of their legs which was pure white sometimes the fur on their feet matched their backs and sometimes it matched their bellies that was as might happen you can easily see how they could steal along over the brown earth or the dead leaves and grass without showing plainly in winter they turned white and then they did not show on the snow the very tip of their short tails stayed a pale brown but it was so tiny as hardly to be noticed any hawk in the air who saw just that bit of brown on the snow beneath him would be likely to think it a leaf or a piece of bark and pay no more attention to it the weasel mothers were very careful of their children and very brave it made no difference how great the danger might be they would stay by their babies and fight for them and such workers as they were it made no difference to them whether it was day or night they would burrow or hunt just the same when they were tired they slept and when they awakened they began at once to do something several families lived in the high bank by the edge of the forest just where the ground slopes down to the marsh they had lived there year after year and had kept on adding to their burrows there was only one doorway to each burrow and that was usually hidden by some leaves or a stone they were hardly as large as chipmunks holes and easily hidden it is a good thing to have a fine large home said the weasels but we build for comfort not for show all the weasel burrows began alike with a straight narrow hall then more halls branched off from this and every little way there would be a room in which to turn around or rest in some of these they stored food in others they had nothing but bones and things which were left from their meals each burrow had one fine large room bigger than an ovenbirds nest with a soft bed of leaves and fur some of the rooms were so near the top of the ground that a weasel could dig his way up in a few minutes if he needed another door they were the loveliest sort of places for playing hideandseek and that is a favorite weasel game only every weasel wants to seek instead of hiding there was never a bit of loose earth around these homes and that is the one secret which weasels will not tell out of the familythey never tell what they do with the earth they dig out it just disappears weasels like to hunt in parties they say there is no fun in doing anything unless you have somebody with whom to talk it over one night four of them went out together as soon as it was dark they were young fellows and had planned to go to the farmers henhouse for the first time they started to go there but of course they wanted to see everything by the way they would run straight ahead for a little while then turn off to one side as ants do poking into a chipmunks hole or climbing a tree to find a birds nest eating whatever food they found and talking softly about everything it is disgraceful the way that chipmunk keeps house said one of them as he came back from going through a burrow under a tree halfeaten food dropped right on the floor of the burrow in the most careless way it was only a nut if it had been anything i cared for i would have eaten it myself then they gossiped about chipmunks and said that although they always looked trim and neat there was no telling what sort of housekeepers they were and that it really seemed as though they would do better to stay at home more and run about the forest less the chipmunk heard all this from the tree where he had hidden himself and would have liked to speak right out and tell them what he thought of callers who entered ones home without knocking and sneaked around to see how things were kept he knew better than to do so however he knew that when four hungry weasels were out hunting their supper it was an excellent time to keep still he was right and there are many times when it is better for angry people to keep still even if they are not afraid of being eaten after they had gone he came down it was lucky for me he said that i awakened hungry and ate a lunch if i hadnt been awake to run away theres no telling where i would be now there are some things worse than having people think you a poor housekeeper just as the chipmunk was finishing his lunch one of the weasels whispered to the others to stop there is somebody coming said he lets wait and see what he is doing it was the blacktailed skunk who came along slowly sniffing here and there and once in a while stopping to eat a few mouthfuls doesnt it seem to you that he acts very queerly said one of the weasels to the rest very replied another and he doesnt look quite as usual i dont know that i ever saw him carry his tail in just that way id like to know where he is going said another i guess he doesnt think anybody will see him lets follow him said the fourth weasel who had not spoken before while he was near them they hid behind a hemlock log out of which many tiny hemlocks were growing once in a while they peeped between the soft fringy leaves of these to see what he was doing they were much excited he is putting his nose down to the ground one would say it must be that he has found something then another would poke his little head up through the hemlocks and look at the skunk he couldnt have found anything after all he would say i cant hear him eating it is very strange the rest would murmur now it just happened that the blacktailed skunk had scented the weasels and knew that they were near he had also heard the rustling behind the hemlock log he knew what gossips weasels are and he guessed that they were watching him so he decided to give them something to think about he knew that they would often fight people larger than themselves but he was not afraid of anybody he did not care to fight them either for if he got near enough to really enjoy it they would be likely to bite him badly and when a weasel has set his teeth into anybody it is not easy to make him let go i rather think said he to himself that there will be four very tired young weasels sleeping in their burrows tomorrow hes walking away whispered one of the weasels where do you suppose he is going well have to find out said the others as they crept quietly out of their hidingplaces the skunk went exactly where he wanted to whenever he found food he ate it the weasels who followed after found nothing left for them they became very hungry but if one of them began to think of going off for a lunch the skunk was certain to do something queer sometimes he would lie down and laugh then the weasels would peep at him from a hidingplace and whisper together what do you suppose makes him laugh they would ask it must be that he is thinking of something wonderful which he is going to do we must not lose sight of him once he met the spotted skunk his brother and they whispered together for a few minutes then the spotted skunk laughed and as he passed on the blacktailed skunk called back to him be sure not to tell any one i do not want it known what i am doing then the four young weasels nudged each other and said there we knew it all the time after that nobody spoke
 about being hungry all they cared for was the following of the blacktailed skunk once when they were in the marsh they were so afraid of being seen that they slipped into the ditch and swam for a way they were good swimmers and didnt much mind but it just shows how they followed the skunk once he led them over to the farm and they remembered their plan of going to the henhouse they were very very hungry and each looked at the others to see what they thought about letting the skunk go and stopping for a hearty supper still nobody spoke of doing so one weasel whispered now we shall surely see what he is about he ought to know that he cannot do wrong or mischievous things without being found out and since we discover it ourselves we shall certainly feel free to speak of it collie the watchdog was sleeping lightly and came rushing around the corner of the house to see what strangers were there but when he saw who they were he dropped his tail and walked away he was old enough to know many things and he knew too much to fight either a skunk or a weasel every one lets skunks alone and it is well to let weasels alone also for although they are so small they bite badly now the blacktailed skunk turned to the forest and walked toward his hole the screechowl passed them flying homeward and several times bats darted over their heads when they went by the bats cave they could tell by the sound that ten or twelve were inside hanging themselves up for the day a dim light showed in the eastern sky and the day birds were stirring and beginning to preen their feathers what do you think it means whispered the weasels he seems to be going home do you suppose he has changed his mind when he reached his hole the blacktailed skunk stopped and looked around the weasels hid themselves under some fallen leaves i bid you goodmorning said the skunk looking toward the place where they were i hope you are not too tired this walk has been very easy for me but i fear it was rather long for weasels besides i have found plenty to eat and have chosen smooth paths for myself goodmorning i have enjoyed your company when even the tip of his tail was hidden in the hole the weasels crawled from under the leaves and looked at each other we believe he knew all the time that we were following him they said he acted queerly just to fool us the wretch yet after all you see he had done only what he did every night and it was because they were watching and talking about him that they thought him going on some strange errand when the days grew short and chilly and bleak winds blew out of the great bluegray cloud banks in the west many of the forest people went to sleep for the winter and not only they but over in the meadow the tree frog and the garter snake had already crawled out of sight and were dreaming sweetly the song birds had long before this started south and the banks of the pond and its bottom of comfortable soft mud held many sleepers under the water the frogs had snuggled down in groups out of sight some of the turtles were there also and some were in the bank the ground hogs had grown stupid and dozy before the last leaves fluttered to the ground and had been the first of the furbearers to go to bed for the winter there were so many interesting things to see and do in the late fall days that they tried exceedingly hard to keep awake a weasel was telling a ground hog something one dayand it was a very interesting piece of gossip only it was rather unkind and so might better not be told herewhen he saw the ground hog winking very slow and sleepy winks and letting his head droop lower and lower once he asked him if he understood the ground hog jumped and opened his eyes very wide indeed and said oh yes yes perfectly ohahahahahah his yawn didnt look so big as it sounds because his mouth was so small he tried to act politely interested but just as the weasel reached the most exciting part of his story the ground hog rolled over sound asleep the next day he said goodby to his friends wished them a happy winter and said he might see some of them before spring as he should come out once to make the weather i only hope i shall awaken in time he said but i am fat enough to sleep until the violets are up he had to be fat you know to last him through the cold weather without eating he was so stout that he could hardly waddle his big looseskinned body dragged when he walked and was even shakier than ever he really couldnt hurry by jumping and he was so short of breath that he could barely whistle when he went into his hole the raccoons went after the ground hog and the skunks were later still they never slept so very long and said they didnt really need to at all and wouldnt except that they had nothing to do and it made housekeeping easier it saved so much not to have to go out to their meals in the coldest weather when the large people were safely out of the way the smaller ones had their best times the muskrats were awake but they had their big houses to eat and were not likely to trouble mice and squirrels there was not much to fear except owls and weasels the ground hogs had once tried to get the great horned owl to go south when the cranes did and he had laughed in their faces towhoo said he not i im not afraid of cold weather you dont know how warm feathers are i never wear anything else furs are all right but they are not feathers he and his relatives sat all day in their holes and seldom flew out except at night sometimes when the day was not too bright they made short trips out for luncheon it was very unfortunate for any mouse to be near at those times now the snow had fallen and the beautiful still cold days had come the weasels fur had changed from brown to white as it does in cold countries in winter the chipmunks had taken their last scamper until early spring and were living each alone in their comfortable burrows they were most independent and thrifty no one ever heard of a chipmunk lacking food unless some robber had carried off his nuts and corn the mice think that it must be very dull for a chipmunk to stay by himself all winter since he does not sleep steadily the chipmunks do not find it so one of them said dull i never find it dull when i am awake i eat or clean my fur or think if i had any one staying with me he might rouse me when i want to sleep or pick the nut that i want for myself or talk when i am thinking no thank you i will go calling when i want company the mice make winter their playtime then the last summers babies are all grown up and able to look out for themselves and the fathers and mothers have a chance to rest the meadow mice come together in big parties and build groups of snug winter homes under the snow of the meadow with many tiny covered walks leading from one to another their food is all around themgrass roots and brown seedsand there is so much of it that they never quarrel to see who shall have this root and who shall have that they sleep during the daytime and awaken to eat and visit and have a good time at night sometimes they are awakened in the daytime as they were when the grouse broke through the snow near them that was an accident and the grouse felt very sorry about it they had snuggled down in a cozy family party near by and were just starting out for a stroll one morning when the eldest son stumbled and fell and crushed through the snow into the little settlement of meadow mice the young grouse was much ashamed of his awkwardness i am so sorry he said im not used to my snowshoes yet this is the first winter i have worn them that is all right said the oldest mouse politely it must be hard to manage them at first we hope you will have better luck after this then they bowed to each other and the grouse walked off to join his brothers and sisters lifting his feet with their newly grown feather snowshoes very high at every step the meadow mice went to work to make their homes neat again yet they never looked really right until that snow had melted and more had fallen one might think that the meadow mice and the grouse would care less for each other after that but it was not so it never is so if people who make trouble are quick to say that they are sorry and those who were hurt will keep patient and forgiving it was only the night after this happened that one of the deer mice had a great fright his home was in a bee tree in the forest the bees and he had always been the best of friends and now that they were keeping close to their honeycomb all winter the deer mouse had taken a small room in the same tree it helped to keep him warm when he slept close to the bees for there was always some heat coming from their bodies once in a while too he took a nibble of honey and they did not mind the deer mouse did not keep much of his own winter food where he lived he had a few beechnuts near by and when the weather was very stormy indeed he ate some of these there was room for many more in the storeroom another hole in the bee tree but he liked to keep food in many places it is wiser said he supposing i had them all here and this tree should be blown down and it should fall in such a way that i couldnt reach the hole what would i do then he was talking to a rabbit when he said this the rabbit never stored up food himself yet he sometimes told other people how he thought it should be done he was sure it would be better to have all the nuts in one place as the chipmunks did and now that the deer mouse had given his reasons he was just as sure as ever the bee tree is not very likely to blow down in that way said he there is not much danger not much but some answered the deer mouse hollow trees fall more quickly than solid ones you may store your food where you please and ill take care of mine the deer mouse spoke very decidedly although he was perfectly polite his beautiful brown eyes looked squarely at the rabbit
 and you could tell by the position of his slender long tail that he was much in earnest the rabbit went home the deer mouse put away hundreds and hundreds of beechnuts these he took carefully out of their shells and laid in nicely lined holes in treetrunks he used leaves for lining these places besides keeping food in the trees he hid little piles of nuts under stones and logs and tucked seeds into chinks of fences or tiny pockets in the ground he had worked in the wheatfield after the grain was cut picking up and carrying away the stray kernels which had fallen from the sheaves he never counted the places where food was stored but he was happy in thinking about them when he lay down to sleep in the morning he always knew where the next nights meals were coming from there was not a thriftier happier person in the forest he was gentle goodnatured and exceedingly businesslike he was also very handsome with large ears and white belly and feet the night after his cousins the meadow mice had been so frightened by the grouse this deer mouse started out for a good time he called on the meadow mice ate a chestnut which he dug up in the edge of the forest scampered up a fencepost and tasted of his hidden wheat to be sure that it was keeping well and then went to the tree where most of his beechnuts were stored he was not quite certain that he wanted to eat one but he wished to be sure that they were all right before he went on he had been invited to a party by some other deer mice and so you see it wouldnt do for him to spoil his appetite they would be sure to have refreshments at the party i suppose they are all right said he as he started to run up the tree still it is just as well to be sure my whiskers he exclaimed when he reached the hole if that isnt just like a red squirrel the opening into the tree had been barely large enough for him to squeeze through and now he could pass in without crushing his fur around the edge of it were many marks of sharp teeth somebody had wanted to get in and had not found the doorway large enough the deer mouse went inside and sat on his beechnuts then he thought and thought and thought he knew very well that it was a red squirrel for the red squirrels are not so thrifty as most of the nuteaters they make a great fuss about gathering food in the fall and frisk and chatter and scold if anybody else comes where they are busy for all that the chipmunks and the deer mice work much harder than they it is not always the person who makes the greatest fuss you know who does the most a red squirrel is usually out of food long before spring comes and after that he takes whatever he can lay his paws on sometimes the chipmunks tell them that they should be ashamed of themselves and work harder then the red squirrels sigh and answer oh that is all very well for you to say still you must remember that we have not such cheek pouches as you the deer mouse thought of these things cheek pouches cried he i have no cheek pouches but i lay up my own food it is only an excuse when they say that i dont think much of people who make excuses he passed through the doorway several times to see just how big it was he found it was not yet large enough for a red squirrel then he scampered over the snow to a friends home im not going to the party said he i have some work to do work said the friend work in winter but before he had finished speaking his caller had gone all night long the deer mouse carried beechnuts from the old hidingplace to a new one he wore quite a path in the snow between one tree and the other his feet were tiny but there were four of them and his long tail dragged after him it was not far that he had to go the new place was one which he had looked at before it was in a maple tree and had a long and very narrow opening leading to the storeroom it was having to go so far into the tree that had kept the deer mouse from using it before now he liked it all the better for having this if that red squirrel ever gnaws his way in here he said he wont have any teeth left for eating when the sun rose the deer mouse went to sleep in the maple tree the red squirrel came and gnawed at the opening into his old storeroom if he had gnawed all day he would surely have gotten in as it was he had to spend much time hunting for food he found some frozen apples still hanging in the orchard and bit away at them until he reached the seeds inside he found one large acorn but it was old and tasted musty he also squabbled with another red squirrel and chased him nearly to the farmyard then collie heard them and chased him most of the way back when night came and he ran off to sleep in his hollow tree he had made the hole almost but not quite large enough he could smell the beechnuts inside and it made him hungry to think how good they would taste i will get up early tomorrow morning and come here he said i can gnaw my way in before breakfast and then he went off in fine leaps to his home and was soon sound asleep in summer he often frolicked around half of the night but now it was cold and when the sun went down he liked to get home quickly and wrap up warmly in his tail the red squirrel was hardly out of sight when the deer mouse came along his path in the snow and up to his old storeroom his dainty white feet shook a little as he climbed and he hardly dared look in for fear of finding the hole empty you can guess how happy he was to find everything safe all night long he worked and when morning came it was a very tired little deer mouse who carried his last beechnut over the trodden path to its safe new resting place he was tired but he was happy there was just one other thing that he wanted to do he wanted to see that red squirrel when he found the beechnuts gone he waited near by for him to come it was a beautiful still winter morning when the hoarfrost clung to all the branches and the shadows which fell upon the snow looked fairly blue it was so cold the deer mouse crouched down upon his dainty feet to keep them warm and wrapped his tail carefully around to help along came the red squirrel dashing finely and not noticing the deer mouse at all a few leaps brought him to the tree a quick run took him to the hole and then he began to gnaw the deer mouse was growing sleepy and decided not to wait longer he ran along near the red squirrel oh goodmorning said he beautiful day i see you are getting that hole ready to use hope you will like it i liked it very well for a while but i began to fear it wasnt safe whwhat do you mean asked the red squirrel sternly he had seen the deer mouses eyes twinkle and he was afraid of a joke oh answered the deer mouse with a careless whisk of his tail i had some beechnuts there until i moved them you had exclaimed the red squirrel he did not gnaw any after that he suddenly became very friendly you couldnt tell me where to find food i suppose said he id eat almost anything the deer mouse thought for a minute i believe said he that you will find plenty in the farmers barn but you must look out for the dog thank you said the red squirrel i will go there said the deer mouse after he had whisked out of sight he has gone to steal from the farmer still men have so very much that they ought to share with squirrels and that you know is true the hawkmoths are acquainted with nearly everybody and are great society people they are invited to companies given by the daylight set and also to parties given at night by those who sleep during the day this is not because the hawkmoths are always awake oh dear no there is nobody in pond forest meadow marsh or even in houses who can be well and strong and happy without plenty of sleep the hawkmoths were awake more or less during the day but it was not until the sun was low in the western sky that they were busiest when every tree had a shadow two or three times as long as the tree itself then one heard the whirrr of wings and the hawkmoths darted past they staid up long after the daylight people went to bed the catbird who sang from the tip of the topmost maple tree branch long after most of his bird friends were asleep said that when he tucked his head under his wing the hawkmoths were still flying in that way of course they became acquainted with the people of the nighttime there was one fine large hawkmoth who used to be a tomato worm when he was young although he really fed as much upon potato vines as upon tomato plants he was handsome from the tip of his long slender suckingtongue to the tip of his trim gray body his wings were pointed and light gray in color with four blackish lines across the hind ones his body was also gray and over it and his wings were many dainty markings of black or very dark gray on the back part of it he had ten square yellow spots edged with black there were also twenty tiny white spots there but he did not care so much for them he always felt badly to think that his yellow spots showed so little that couldnt be helped of course and he should have been thankful to have them at all another thing which troubled him was the fact that he couldnt see his own yellow spots he would have given a great deal to do so he could see the yellow spots of other hawkmoths who had been tomato worms when he was but that was not like seeing his own he had tried and tried and it always ended in the same wayhis eyes were tired and his back ached his body was so much stouter and stiffer than that of his butterfly cousins that he could not bend it easily when he got to thinking about his yellow spots he often flew away to the farmers potatofields where the young tomato worms were feeding he would fly around them and cry out look at my yellow spots are they not fine then he would dart away to the vegetablegarden and balance himself in the air over the tomato plants the humming of his wings would make the tomato worms there look up and he would say if
 you are good little worms and eat a great deal you may some day become fine moths like me and have ten yellow spots apiece sometimes he even went down to the corner where the farmer had tobacco plants growing and showed his yellow spots to the tomato worms there he never went anywhere else for these worms do not care for other things to eat everywhere that he went the tomato worms exclaimed oh oh what beautiful yellow spots what wonderful yellow spots when he flew away they would not eat for a while but rested on their fat prolegs raised the front part of their bodies in the air folded their six little real legs under their chins and thought and thought and thought they always sat in that position when they were thinking and they had a great many cousins who did the same thing it was a habit which ran in the family when other people saw them sitting in this way with their real legs crossed under their chins they always cried look at the sphinxes although not one of them knew what a sphinx really was and that was just one of their habits this was why the hawkmoths were sometimes called sphinxmoths it was not kind in the hawkmoth to come and make the tomato worms discontented if he had stayed away they would have thought it the loveliest thing in the world to be fat green tomato worms with two sorts of legs and each with a horn standing up on the hind end of his body that is not the usual place for horns still it does very well and these horns are worn only for looks they are never used for poking or stinging before the hawkmoth came to visit them the tomato worms had thought it would be quiet and restful and pleasant to lie all winter in their shining brown pupacases in the ground waiting for the spring to finish turning them into moths now they were so impatient to get their yellow spots that they could hardly bear the idea of waiting they did not even care about the long slender tonguecase which every tomatoworm has on his pupacase and which looks like a handle to it one day the tomato worms told the rubythroated hummingbird about all this the hummingbird was a very sensible fellow and would no doubt have been a hardworking husband and father if his wife had not been so independent he had been a most devoted lover and helped build a charming nest of fernwool and plantdown and cover it with beautiful graygreen lichens when done it was about as large as half of a hens egg and a morningglory blossom would have more than covered it the lichens were just the color of the branch on which it rested and one could hardly see where it was that is the nicest thing to be said about a nest if a bird ever asks you what you think of his nest and you wish to say something particularly agreeable you must stare at the tree and ask where is it then when he has shown it to you you may speak of the soft lining or the fine weaving or the stout way in which it is fastened to the branches after this nest was finished and the two tiny white eggs laid in it mrs hummingbird cared for nothing else she would not go honeyhunting with her husband or play in the air with him as she used to do he tried to coax her by darting down toward her as she sat covering her eggs and by squeaking the sweetest things he could think of into her ear but she acted as though she cared more for the eggs than for him and did not even squeak sweet things back so of course he went away and let her hatch and bring up her children as she chose it was certainly her fault that he left her she might not have been able to leave the eggs but she could have squeaked now that the rubythroated hummingbird had no home cares he made many calls on his friends they were very short calls for he would seldom sit down yet he heard and told much news while he balanced himself in the air with his tiny feet curled up and his wings moving so fast that one could not see them when the tomato worms told him how they felt about the hawkmoths yellow spots he became very indignant those poor young worms he said to himself it is a shame and something must be done about it the more he thought the angrier he became and his feathers fairly stood on end he hardly knew what he was doing and ran his long slender bill into the same flowers several times although he had taken all the honey from them at first that night when the sun had set and the silvery moon was peeping above a violetcolored cloud in the eastern sky the rubythroated hummingbird sat on the tip of a sprucetree branch and waited for the hawkmoth i hope nobody else will hear me talking said he it would sound so silly if i were overheard he sat very still his tiny feet clutching the branch tightly it was late twilight now and really time that he should go to sleep but he had decided that if he could possibly keep awake he would teach the hawkmoth a lesson i wish he would hurry said he i can hardly keep my eyes open he did not yawn because he had not the right kind of mouth for it you know a yawn ought to be nearly round his beak would have made one a great great many times higher than it was wide and that would have been exceedingly unbecoming to him yellow evening primroses grew near the sprucetree and the tall stalks were opening their flowers for the night above the seedpods and below the buds on each stalk two three or four blossoms were slowly unfolding the rubythroated hummingbird did not often stay up long enough to see this and he watched the four smooth yellow petals of one untwist themselves until they were free to spring wide open he had watched five blossoms when he heard the hawkmoth coming then he darted toward the primroses and balanced himself daintily before one while he sucked honey from it whirrrr the hawkmoth was there good evening said he rather late for you isnt it it is a little answered the hummingbird growing a bit chilly too isnt it i should think youd be cold without feathers mine are such a comfort feel as good as they look and that is saying a great deal the hawkmoth balanced himself before another primrose and seemed to care more about sucking honey up his long tonguetube than he did about talking i think it is a great thing to have a touch of bright color too said the hummingbird the beautiful red spot on my throat looks particularly warm and becoming when the weather is cool you ought to have something of the sort i have yellow spotsten of them answered the hawkmoth sulkily you have exclaimed the hummingbird in the most surprised way oh yes i think i do remember something about them it is a pity they dont show more mrs hummingbird never wears bright colors she says it would not do people would see her on her nest if she did excepting the red spot she is dressed like mewhite breast green back and head and black wings and tail green is another good color you should wear some green the hawkmoth murmured that he didnt see any particular use in wearing green oh said the hummingbird it is just the thing to wearneat never looks dusty here the hawkmoth drew back for his own wings you know were almost dust color and matches the leaves perfectly the hawkmoth said something about having to go and thinking that the primrose honey was not so good as usual i thought it excellent said the hummingbird perhaps you do not get it so easily as i ah yes you use a tonguetube what different ways different people do have now i like honey but i could not live many days on that alone what i care most for is the tiny insects that i find eating it and you cannot eat meat what a pity i must say that you seem to make the best of it though and do fairly well oh must you go well good night the hawkmoth flew away feeling very much disgusted he had always thought himself the most beautiful person in the neighborhood he rather thought so still yet it troubled him to know that others did not think so and he began to remember how many times he had heard people admire the rubythroated hummingbird he never liked him after that but neither did he brag the young tomato worms soon forgot what the hawkmoth had said to them and became happy and contented once more the rubythroated hummingbird never cared to talk about it yet he was once heard to say that he would rather offend the hawkmoth and even make him a little unhappy than to have him bothering the poor little tomato worms all the time


A WORD TO THE CHILDREN


DEAR CHILDREN,--The very best way to know the insects is to go
and watch them. Watch them whenever you can, and each time you will find
out something new. Books will help you, but you must watch, too. Look
more than you read.

If you need to catch them, put them under a tumbler, and feed them and
give them a drop of water every day to drink. Slip a card under the rim
of the tumbler on one side so as to let in the air. If you do not know
what to feed them, or if they will not eat, let them go after a day or
two.

If you wish to kill an injurious insect, do it _quickly and completely_.
Remember the insects are alive, and we should not make them suffer
unnecessarily.

Of course you must try to make your captives feel at home. If they live
in the sand, put sand in the tumbler and tie a piece of netting over the
top so they cannot escape.

If they live in the water, put them in a tumbler of water. And when you
have secured your captives, watch them as much as you can.

If you do not know how to pronounce the words in this book, study the
glossary at the back and it will help you.

I hope you will have a very happy time getting acquainted with your
little insect neighbors.

Come, children; come with me.

Come to a pond I know of.

See how the water shines in the sun.

Over there is an old log lying on the edge of the pond.

It is covered with green moss, and a green frog is sitting on one end of
it.

Let us go and sit on the other end.

Goop! he says, and--plump! he has jumped into the water.

That is too bad, frog; we did not mean to disturb you.

How pretty it is here!

See the pickerel weed growing out in the water with its arrow-shaped
leaves, and its spikes of purple flowers.

See, down in the water are little fish, and very likely pollywogs are
there too, and lots of queer little things.

But who is this darting over the pond?

Ah, we know you.

You are our queer little, dear little old dragon fly.

Look, children; see the dragon flies darting about like flashes of light
in every direction.

They are having such a good time.

Whizz! One flashed right past Mollie's ear.

   

Pretty people, I wish one of you would come and sit by us a little
while, so we could get a good look at you.

What is that, Ned? You have found a large one lying on the ground?

Sure enough; it is a beauty too, with a green body and silver wings.

Something seems to be wrong with it; it does not fly nor try to get
away.

What a big one it is!

My! my! what eyes!

Don't crowd, Amy; let little Nell see too.

What is that you say, Richard? "It catches mosquitoes and gnats and
flies and other insects while flying."

Yes, and that is why it has such big eyes. We should need big eyes
ourselves if we were to spend our time chasing mosquitoes.

Two eyes you have, little dragon fly, like the rest of us, but your eyes
are not like ours.

No, indeed!

Each of your big eyes is made up of a great many small eyes packed close
together.

Do you know, children, that some of the largest of the dragon flies have
as many as twenty thousand facets, or small eyes, in each large eye?

Think of it! Forty thousand eyes in one little dragon fly head. It
_ought_ to see well.

These facets are six-sided, excepting those along the edge, which are
rounded on the outside. You cannot see their real shape without a
microscope, they are so small. But here is a picture of some facets as
they look under the microscope.

   

Eyes like these, made up of many facets, we call compound eyes.

All grown-up insects have compound eyes, though not many have as large
ones as the dragon fly.

Only insects that chase other insects or that need to see in the dark
have very large eyes.

See what a big mouth the dragon fly has. Its jaws do not show unless it
opens its lower lip, which fits over its mouth like a mask.

I should not care to have it bite my finger.

It could not hurt very much, and its bite is not poisonous, still I
shall handle it carefully.

Some call the dragon fly a darning needle, and say it sews up people's
ears when they lie on the grass. This is not true. It does not sew up
anything. It has nothing to sew with.

   

Why should it want to sew up people's ears, anyway?

It does nothing unpleasant but bite fingers, and it never goes out of
its way to do that.

If we let it alone, it always lets us alone.

It is our good friend because it catches mosquitoes. For this reason it
is sometimes called mosquito hawk.

We should never kill a dragon fly.

Sometimes it is called a spindle, I suppose because it is long and
slender like a spindle.

Down South the colored people believe the dragon fly brings dead snakes
to life, and they call it snake doctor.

In some places it is called snake feeder.

But it has nothing to do with snakes, dead or alive.

The French have given it a pretty name, _demoiselle_, or damsel fly, and
that is quite deserved, for the dragon fly is a graceful little
creature, as pretty as pretty can be.

   

See, sticking out of the front of its head are two little feelers, or
antennæ, as we must call them.

They are very short, but it does not need long ones.

Insects smell with their feelers, you know, but our dragon flies see so
well they do not need to smell very well, I suppose.

See how it can turn its head around. That is because it has a little
short neck between its head and its body.

Its eyes, its mouth, and its antennæ belong to its head.

Of course our demoiselle can fly well; one need only look at those wings
to know that.

To fly well is quite as necessary to one of its habits as to see well.

What would be the use of seeing an insect if it could not fly fast
enough to catch it?

We all like your pretty wings, little dragon fly; they look like glass
and they shine so in the sun.

How fast the wings can move! See that dragon fly skimming over the pond;
its wings make a whizzing sound as it darts about.

   

Why does it zigzag so?

Why doesn't it fly in a straight line?

Yes, Mollie, you are right, it goes zigzagging along after insects.

It sees one it wants off at one side--whizz! around it turns after it.

Shouldn't you like to fly like that, children?

And yet we would not be willing to exchange our arms and hands for
wings.

We could not whittle a stick nor write a letter if we had only wings.

In fact we could not do most of the things we now do.

I am glad I have my hands.

We are glad, too, that the dragon flies have their pretty, swift wings.

They have four wings, all nearly the same size and shape, you see, and
they are all stiff and shining.

Some dragon flies, like this one we have picked up, always keep their
wings spread out.

   

But over there, standing on the end of that stick, is another kind.

When it rests its wings are folded together.

What a pretty one it is! Do you see it?

It is small, but so pretty.

It is bright blue and shines as though it had been polished.

Sometimes birds catch these smaller dragon flies, though birds, as a
rule, are not fond of any of them.

They are so hard and their wings are so stiff I should think a bird
might almost as well swallow nails.

I am sure no bird could swallow one of the big ones, wings and all!

But frogs can.

A frog will try to swallow almost anything it can catch, and it watches
for the dragon flies when they come to lay their eggs in the water.

Suddenly it jumps out, and away goes poor dragon fly into that great
wide frog-mouth.

   

Now look at the legs of the dragon fly. It has six.

Every dragon fly has six legs.

They are rather short and small for so large an insect, but that is
because it does not need large, strong legs.

You never saw a dragon fly dig a hole, or run, or even walk, did you?

Their legs are not arranged for walking. All six of them are directed
forwards as though they were reaching out after something. And so they
are--reaching out after insects.

Dragon fly catches his prey while he is flying, and he grasps the
insects with his feet.

He snatches one, and then what?

Does he sit down somewhere and eat it?

Not he, he is far too hungry for that; he continues his swift flight,
and as he flies he eats.

As soon as he has finished one fly or gnat, zip! he snatches another.

He has an insatiable appetite, consuming hundreds of insects in the
course of a day. Nor does he confine his attention to flies and gnats
and mosquitoes and such small fry. He catches what he can. A large
dragon fly will even gorge himself on one of the large-sized
butterflies, and one has been seen calmly chewing away at an enormous
wasp!

No, indeed, Mabel, the dragon fly does not eat the wings of the
butterfly, it eats only the soft body.

Probably nothing eats a butterfly, wings and all. Birds and insects
sometimes catch butterflies, and you often see the bright wings lying on
the ground. The wings of insects are not worth eating, and are almost
always cast aside by the creatures that eat the insects.

Besides catching insects with their legs, the dragon flies cling fast to
things with them, but when they wish to move they do not walk, they fly.

Yes, indeed, Frank, you are right; their legs are jointed.

That is so they can move them easily and fold them up when they want
to.

They would find it as hard to get along without joints to their legs as
we should.

Wouldn't we be stiff if we had no joints!

See, the legs and wings are fastened to the middle part of the body, the
_thorax_, we call it.

All insects have the legs and wings attached to the thorax.

The rest of the body is the abdomen. See how long it is.

   

It is the long abdomen that gives the dragon fly its name of spindle, I
suppose.

The abdomen is jointed, and it can curl up.

All grown-up insects have a head, a thorax, and a jointed abdomen.


What are you looking at, Charlie?

Something moving in the bottom of the pond?

Let us get it out.

Here, we will dip it out with this cup.

What a lot of stuff!

Sticks and mud--and--what is that?

Something alive, surely.

Let us put some clean water in the cup and examine what we have found.

My! my! what a queer little thing!

What do you suppose it is?

Ah, I know now, but I do not think you could ever, ever guess, not if
you tried a week.

It is a young dragon fly!

It does not look much like its shiny-winged parents.

It looks like I don't know what, with a face like--well, when you look
right in front of it, like a pug dog.

Queer! Well, I should think so! What is that, Amy? Am I sure it is a
dragon fly?

Yes, there is no mistake; a dragon fly one day dropped an egg in the
pond, and out of it hatched--this.

   

It will some day become a shiny-winged dragon fly and catch mosquitoes.

We will call it larva, and we will watch it a little while.

Look and see if it has a head, a thorax, and an abdomen.

Are there antennæ on its head? And has it eyes?

If you were to look at its eyes with a microscope, you would find that
they are made of six-sided facets, like the eyes of the grown-up dragon
fly.

They are compound eyes, but they are not as large as the eyes of the
grown-up dragon fly.

How many legs has it? What are its legs fastened to?

Yes, Nellie, thorax is right.

Its six legs are fastened to its thorax. I am glad you remembered
thorax.

Has it a jointed abdomen? and has it wings?

Look! did you see that?

It opened its innocent-looking face all of a sudden, just darted it out
into a long-handled spoon, with hooks at the end, and hooked up that
little grub.

Now it is holding the grub on the hooks in front of its mouth and eating
it as greedily as if it were half starved.

   

So that is why its face looks so queer.

It is its long under lip all folded up in front like a mask that makes
it look like a pug dog.

When it pleases it darts out that lip, and any unlucky insect or snail
may fall a prey to its greedy appetite.

It is said that the larvæ of some dragon flies even eat pollywogs and
small fishes.

Ned wants to know if "larvæ" means the same as "larva."

Yes, it is the plural form of the word. When we speak of only one we say
"larva"; when we speak of more than one, instead of saying "larvas," we
say "larvæ."

The dragon fly larvæ are terrible gluttons, and hidden under the mask
are strong jaws for chewing up their prey.

Their legs are quite large and strong, too, for they crawl about the
bottom of the pond or up the stalks of the plants.

They do not move about very fast, but they do shoot out that under lip
very, very, _very_ fast indeed, so good-by to any little live thing in
the pond that comes within reach of it.

The dragon fly larvæ do not all look alike. They are different in the
different species of dragon flies, and, like the rest of us, they change
as they grow older.

Yes, May, you can keep the dragon fly larvæ until they change into
dragon flies.

You must supply them with fresh water and with enough to eat.

And you must put a net over the bowl or aquarium in which you keep them,
otherwise as soon as they are able they will fly away.

How can they fly without wings?

Oh, but they are going to have wings. You know they are young dragon
flies in spite of their strange appearance.

Be sure and feed them enough, or else they will eat each other, and that
would be a pity; and be sure there are some water plants for them to
hide under and crawl upon.

You can give them a little fresh fish or a tiny bit of very fresh meat,
though they like best the living things they find in the bottom of the
pond.

   

When the dragon fly larva first hatches it is very small and its legs
are rather long and spidery, but it eats and eats and eats,--my, how it
eats!

And it grows and grows, and one day it finds its skin too tight.

A tight skin must be rather uncomfortable.

But the larva does not care much for its skin.

It merely splits it open down the back and pulls itself out.

Perhaps you think it must be yet more uncomfortable to be without a
skin.

But it is not without a skin. It is covered by a new and soft one that
soon hardens, and that is larger than the old one.

It wriggles out of its old skin as though it were an old coat, and
leaves it clinging to the weeds in the pond.

Sometime you may find these cast-off dragon fly overcoats.

After it has shed its skin the dragon fly continues to grow. It keeps on
growing until it has outgrown its new skin.

Then what do you think it does?

Yes, Charlie, that is right, it sheds this skin too.

   

When it sheds its skin we say it moults.

It moults several times, and at last little short wings appear. At first
it has no wings at all, you know.

Amy wonders how the larva breathes under water.

Ah, Master Ned, you are laughing too soon. You think insects do not have
to breathe, but you are very much mistaken, sir.

Insects do have to breathe.

They would die if they could get no air to breathe.

Some of the dragon fly larvæ have an odd arrangement for breathing under
water. They have a sort of syringe in the end of the body, and there are
breathing pores or gills in the syringe.

The water goes in and out of this syringe, and the larva breathes as the
fish does, by means of its gills.

Yes, May, its gills are in its syringe, which seems very odd,--you see
the dragon fly larva breathes at its tail end instead of at its head
end.

Mollie thinks it is an upside-down, inside-out sort of a creature
anyway. But it knows what it is about.

Ned wants to know how it can get any air to breathe when it lives under
water.

The truth is, there is always air mixed in with water, and it is this
air the larva breathes when the water goes in and out of the syringe.

It uses the syringe for another purpose too. When it pleases it can
shoot out the water with great force, and thus propel itself quite a
distance.

By means of the syringe it can leap through the water faster than it can
move by its slow-going legs.

Mollie wants to know if we can see the syringe.

No, it is inside the body.

But there is a kind of dragon fly that has a pair of gills outside, at
the end of the abdomen, instead of the syringe inside.

The best I can do is to show you a picture of one. Some day we may find
it in the pond.

   

Those two feather-like parts at the tail end are gills.

Yes, John, it can propel itself through the water by rowing, as it were,
with these gills.

There are some species of dragon fly larvæ that swim by moving the tip
of the abdomen from side to side, as a fish moves its body when it
swims.

But now let us return to our funny larva that lives at the bottom of the
pond. It stays down there, eating and growing and moulting, for nine or
ten months or even longer; then something very wonderful happens.

It suddenly feels a great desire to get up to the top of the pond.

   

It climbs up a weed or a stick until it is clear out of the water.

Then its skin splits down the back for the last time, and out there
pulls itself, not a larva, but a weak-looking dragon fly, with soft and
flabby little wings.

Now is its hour of danger, and now is the time for such birds as like
the taste of young dragon flies to help themselves.

Catbirds seem to have a special fondness for these helpless insects, and
have been known to eat them before the flabby little wings had grown
stiff.

If the birds do not find the newly emerged dragon fly, it remains
motionless an hour or so, but it does not remain unchanged.

Its wings stretch out and harden.

Bright metallic colors begin to play over them and over its body; and
all at once--off it darts, away and away, glittering in the sunshine, a
swift, beautiful winged creature.

Towards the end of summer you will often see dragon flies darting about
in every direction.

They seem to come in swarms and I think they usually come where there
are ponds or marshes, for in such places there are many gnats and
mosquitoes.

Mollie wants to know why it would not be a good plan for people who live
where there are many mosquitoes to raise dragon flies?

That is a very sensible idea, Mollie, and it has been tried.

Yes, indeed; some men once collected dragon fly larvæ, and took care of
them until they changed into dragon flies.

Then what do you think happened?

As soon as they got their wings, away went those dragon flies,--away
and away, without stopping to catch a single mosquito for the men who
had taken the trouble to raise them.

The dragon flies will not stay at home.

They fly so fast and so far there is no use raising them.

They are among the swiftest and strongest of insects.

How do the larvæ get in the ponds? Frank is asking.

I will tell you what I know about it.

   

The winged dragon flies mate, and the female then drops her eggs in the
water or lays them on twigs in the water, where they hatch out into
larvæ.

The dragon flies have to be very careful when they go close to the water
to lay their eggs.

You all know why.

Yes, it is because the frogs are on the watch to catch them.

   

The mother dragon fly knows the larvæ have to live in the water, and so
she takes pains to put the eggs there; sometimes she even crawls down
under the water on stems of plants to lay her eggs. Isn't she a wise
little mother?

There are a good many species of dragon flies.

Some are large and some are small.

Some are bright and some are dull.

There are black ones and bright blue ones, or green ones with blue eyes.

Some are marked with red and yellow.

They are a very gay family.

The dragon fly family is also a very old one.

Indeed, it is one of the oldest families on earth.

Long before there were bees or butterflies or dogs or horses or human
beings, there were dragon flies.

Don't you suppose that may be why the dragon fly is such a
strange-looking insect?

It does not look like other insects; it is very old-fashioned, like the
pine trees.

Pine trees, too, belong to a very old plant family that lived long ago,
before there were oaks or maples, or other trees that shed their leaves.

Now we must go home.

Good-by, green frog, you may come back to your log now.

Good-by, pretty dragon fly people, we shall never forget you.

Good-by, pleasant pond and moss-grown log, we hope to see you often
again.

   

Come, children, and see! Hundreds and hundreds of them are dancing
about.

What are they? Yes, May, they do make us think of the dragon flies, but
they are like fairy demoiselles.

They are the May flies, fairy ships sailing in the sea of air.

See how they are tossed about.

Many have fallen to the ground, which is covered with them.

They live but a day, or sometimes only a few hours, and so they are
called day flies, and also ephemeræ, which means short-lived.

They have eyes, as you can see, little round eyes, but their mouth is so
tiny they cannot eat.

Strange little beings to come into the world so helpless!

How different from the strong, fierce dragon flies!

See their dainty little legs. Six, you see, and legs and wings grow out
from the thorax.

Have they an abdomen?

See the long threads at the end of it, they look like slender tails. How
they spread these threads out as they fly!

They have four wings, but the wings are not shaped like those of the
dragon fly, and they are very much more delicate.

 

Yes, May, I agree with you, they look like fine lace.

The fore wings, you see, are larger than the hind ones.

Richard asks, "Where do May flies come from? and why are they called May
flies?"

Now, Richard, one question at a time, if you please, and the last shall
come first because it is easier to answer.

They are called May flies because they often come out in the month of
May, though sometimes not until June, and some species are as late as
July in appearing.

   

We shall have to look into the ponds and little streams to discover
where they come from.

See, John has scooped up some little speckled grubs out of the mud. Is
it possible that _they_ are the larvæ of our fairy May flies? _They_
have a mouth!--see what big jaws for such little creatures.

And what do you suppose they eat?

No doubt they, too, live on animal food.

No doubt they move about in the mud and catch what they can.

You see, John had to dig them up; they like to burrow in the weeds and
mud, and some of them even make tunnels of mud in which to protect their
soft bodies. Their short, stout legs enable them to dig well.

Their bodies are soft, but their jaws are not. O dear, no!

   

The grown-up May flies mate, and then the female drops her eggs on the
surface of the water. When she does this a fish will very often jump up
and seize her, for fish are very fond of May flies, and lucky are the
May flies to escape these ravenous enemies.

The eggs are heavy and sink to the bottom, where they hatch into these
queer-looking larvæ that eat and grow and shed their skin just like the
dragon fly larvæ.

Those brushes along their sides are the gills they breathe with.

See the gills moving swiftly back and forth; they look as though the
larva wished to swim with them, but this is not why it moves them so
constantly.

The continual motion of the gills stirs up the water and keeps our larva
supplied with fresh air.

Nellie is asking what gills are.

Well, gills in fishes and in such insects as have gills, and in crabs
and lobsters and other creatures that live in the water, are parts that
often look like fringes or flat plates.

The gills of fishes have a great many blood vessels running through
them. The walls of these blood vessels are very thin, and the oxygen
from the air that is in the water passes into the blood that is in the
gills, and then this blood, all full of oxygen, circulates through the
fish's body.

You see in fishes the blood vessels come into the gills and get the
oxygen.

In insects it is different. There are air tubes running like tiny pipes
all through the gills and into the body of the insect. The oxygen of the
air that is in the water passes out through the walls of these tubes
into the blood of the insect.

Yes, John, in fishes the blood comes to the air, in insects the air goes
to the blood. The air passes into the air tubes of the insects, and thus
is carried all through their bodies.

The blood takes the oxygen out of the air.

Without oxygen in the blood no animal could live.

Now let us go back to our May flies. They remain in the larval state a
year, and some species remain two years. Think of living in the mud for
two long years!

In the mud they creep about, eating, eating, eating. Then some summer
day they leave the mud and swim to the surface of the water.

Pop! they are gone.

They were so quick about it we could not see what happened.

The larval skin burst open and forth leaped the May fly, like a winged
fairy from a prison cell.

They do not come out slowly and wait for their wings to dry like the
dragon fly.

   

They spring out all of a sudden and fly away, leaving their cast-off
skin in the pond.

Unless their motions were quick they might be snapped up by the fish
that are so fond of them.

But though they seem to emerge thus quickly into perfect winged May
flies, they are not quite done with infancy. They are still wrapped
about by a very delicate skin that they have to get rid of. So they fly
to a bush near the water and stay a little while until this skin splits
and comes off, and they are free.

In spite of their quick motions when they spring from the water, many of
the May flies fall back into it and are caught by the fish.

   here, as the text is broken 

It is said that the trout become fat and good-flavored when the May
flies emerge, they eat so many of them. And what the fish do not catch
the birds try to. Swallows and other insect-loving birds have a glorious
feast when the May flies come out. For a season they live in the midst
of more delicacies than they can possibly use.

Fish like the May fly larvæ, too, which is probably the reason the larvæ
have learned to live in the mud, out of reach.

Fishermen dig up the larvæ for bait, so you see the May flies have a
hard time to get safely through the world.

But in spite of difficulties a great many of them live, and some summer
day out they come trooping.

They spring all at once from the surface of the water as by magic,
hundreds and thousands, yes, millions of them. They fill the air, they
cover everything.

The great naturalist Swammerdam, who was the first to make a thorough
study of the May flies, thus tells us how they appeared in France one
year:--

"I then saw a sight beyond all expectation. The ephemeræ filled the air
like the snowflakes in a dense snowstorm.

"The steps were covered to a depth of two, three, or even four inches. A
tract of water five or six feet across was completely hidden, and as the
floating insects slowly drifted away, others took their places. Several
times I was obliged to retreat to the top of the stairs from the
annoyance caused by the ephemeræ, which dashed in my face, and got into
my eyes, mouth, and nose."

These swarms of May flies appear only from three to five days at a
time.

Wherever there are streams there are May flies, and the canals of
Holland make good breeding places for them; no wonder, then, the Dutch,
who you know live in Holland, have a saying, "As thick as May flies."

Although so many of the May flies perish at once, multitudes of them
drop their eggs into the water to renew the race of May flies.

Is it not wonderful that after so long a period of creeping about in the
mud as larvæ, these graceful and beautiful little creatures have but a
few hours in which to dance joyously about in the upper air on wings of
gossamer? Some, indeed, live less than an hour, and some, that come out
in the evening, finish their dance of life and perish before sunrise,
without ever having seen the beautiful daylight.

Yes, strange little beings are they.

They do us no harm and we should not kill them.

Let them live their short lives and be happy.




John has been fishing.

What do you think he caught?

Nary fish, my dears, but a goodly number of stone flies, which he has
brought to show us.

Yes, Mollie, they do remind us a very little of our May flies, only, of
course, they are many times larger.

It is rather a clumsy creature in spite of its large wings, and John
says he had no trouble whatever in catching it.

See, it has four wings, and the hind ones are the larger.

Yes, May, they fold up in plaits, like the sticks of a fan.

See its long antennæ and its compound eyes. Its eyes are not so large as
are those of the dragon fly. It does not spend its time pursuing other
insects, but is more like the May fly after it gets its wings.

Yes, Ned, it lives longer than the May fly, but it does not live very
long, and it eats little.

It is a pretty little gray thing as it rests on the side of John's box,
with its wings folded like a gossamer cloak over its body.

   

It lays its eggs in the water, and out of them hatch little six-legged
larvæ that are not troubled by want of appetite. If the winged stone fly
does not eat, its larva does; it is like the other larvæ we know, always
devouring something.

   

Yes, Charlie, it feeds on living creatures, greatly relishing the larvæ
of the May flies, or any other luckless insect infants it can capture.

It grows fast and moults several times, and when winter comes it hides
away, only to come forth at the first breath of spring and continue its
eating.

Like other larvæ that live under water, it does its breathing by means
of gills, and these gills are in little tufts just above the base of
each leg.

It lives under stones, which is why it is called the stone fly, and it
slides quickly around a corner when you lift up its stone.

Fish are very fond of it, and hunt it as eagerly as it hunts larvæ.
Since it makes good bait for brook trout, its life is always in danger.
It finishes its growth in early summer, and emerges from its larval
skin as a perfect winged insect.

Yes, indeed, John, you can often find dozens of the cast-off skins of
the stone flies along the brook sides in the month of June.

The stone flies are harmless little people, and we should never kill one
needlessly.

   

May has something here for us to look at. She says it is a slippery
rascal. Let us see it. Oh, yes, you have it in that little box. See, the
box has a glass top. May cut the top off the box herself, and fastened
in a little pane of glass so we could see the rascal without danger of
its escaping.

   

Pretty rascal! Like a little silver fish slipping about the box.

Yes, Charlie, it is called the silver fish. A land fish? Why, yes, it
would be a land fish if it were a fish at all. But in spite of its name
it is no fish. It is covered with shining scales, though, that are very
much like fish scales, and it is shaped a good deal like a fish.

Oh, yes, it is an insect. You see it has six legs. But it has no wings.

No, it is not a young one.

It never will have any wings, no matter how old it may get to be.

It is flat, you see, and its scales make it very slippery, so that it is
hard to catch and yet harder to hold on to after you have caught it. It
goes flashing about like a little silver dart, and it loves to eat
starch.

That is why May calls it a rascal. It eats the starch from the paste
that fastens on her wall paper, and from book-bindings, so you see it
makes things fall to pieces. But my! what a pretty rascal it is! Besides
its name of silver fish, it is also called fish moth, though it is not a
moth at all. It is also called bristle-tail, because of the long,
bristle-like parts at the end of its body; and in some places it is
called a slink, because, you know, it loves dark places, and when you
uncover it in the daytime, it slips around a corner into the dark again.

Yes, it seems to slink about as if it were ashamed of itself, but it is
not ashamed; it does not like the light, and it does not like us to see
it.

Perhaps it is afraid of us.






Children, here is a cockroach.

It was one of the first insects that came to live on the earth;
cockroaches were here before people, and they are here yet.

You do not think it is pretty?

Neither do I.

I don't know anybody who thinks a cockroach pretty.

Oh, no, it won't bite you.

It will only get into your pantry and eat your food.

It will walk around in the night and frighten you if you go suddenly
into the kitchen.

It will not frighten you on purpose, but when it hears you coming, it
will run, and then maybe you will scream and run too.

What is that, May? You've a good mind to scream and run as it is?

Very well, scream and run if you want to; the cockroach won't care.

We do not often see these big black fellows in the North, but sometimes
we do. Down South cockroaches seem to be everywhere.

What, May? You are never going South, then?

Well, you do not need to go; the cockroaches won't care.

They have little heads and long antennæ, like threads.

What is that, May? You don't care anything about their heads? You don't
want to know anything about cockroaches?

Oh, yes, you want to know about cockroaches. Remember how old they are.

They have six legs, you see.

You don't care how many legs they have?

Oh, yes, you do. They could not walk if they had no legs.

You wish they couldn't walk?

Dear me, May; you don't seem to like cockroaches.

Poor old cockroaches.

   

Think how old they are.

What is that you say? They are old enough to know better?

Why, May, what have they ever done to you?

Nothing, only you don't like them?

Well, well, they don't like you, either. Poor old cockroaches; nobody
seems to like them.

Perhaps they don't care.

Will you let me tell you where they came from?

They do not belong to this country.

Their natural home is tropical Asia.

You see, about four hundred years ago, the ships that bore fruits and
other merchandise from India and other warm countries in Asia, bore, as
well, a number of little, flat, reddish brown stowaways.

   

Stowaways, as you know, are people that do not buy their tickets, but
that hide among the ship's cargo, and so get free transportation to
other countries.

Well, these little flat stowaways were not human beings, they were
insects. Yes, May, they were the cockroaches.

When they landed from their hot land of Asia in cold England, they must
have wondered what was to become of them. Many of them no doubt died,
for they cannot stand cold weather at all; but some of them were
carried, with the fruits and other things, quite unintentionally, of
course, for nobody guessed they were there, into warm cellars and
kitchen cupboards.

_Then_ they felt at home!

They knew better than to leave the cosey nooks where they could hide
away and sleep all day, and when they came out at night would find a
delicious supper close at hand.

They are great eaters, you know, so what with the good things in the
pantry and the warmth of the kitchen quarters they prospered wherever
they could find a kitchen to live in.

Soon they spread all over the large cities of England and finally into
even remote country districts.

Of course they found their way to the United States of America, and in
many houses in the North they have taken lodging. But down South, where
it is always warm enough, they have prospered greatly, and they are
there in far greater numbers than in the North.

Besides, there is a large American cockroach that belongs to tropical
America, but that has found its way pretty well over the country. And
there are cockroaches that live in the woods, some of them coming in the
night to visit our houses and help themselves from our pantries.

Yes, Mollie, the cockroaches eat almost anything they can find, and what
they do not eat they spoil by an ill-smelling liquid they give out when
disturbed.

It is this liquid that makes the cockroaches so very offensive to us.
We cannot bear to touch one because of it.

Cockroaches eat one variety of food that nobody objects to their having.
They are fond of bed bugs and greedily devour them.

Besides the large, dark, reddish brown cockroaches there is a little
tan-colored fellow that is often very troublesome.

   

It is not a native of this country, but is supposed to have been brought
to England by soldiers from the Crimea, and later it found its way to
America.

We call it the croton bug, but it is not a bug at all, it is a
cockroach.

It is particularly numerous about water pipes, and, like the rest of the
cockroaches, it hides in the daytime.

At night out troop crowds and crowds of the little tan-colored water
bugs. They run about the floor, and over the pantry shelves. They get
into everything they can find, and have a beautiful time.

They are funny little fellows, and if they were not so troublesome, we
might admire them.

How they can run!

All the cockroaches run very fast, so that it is hard to catch one. And
they are hard and smooth, too, which makes it yet more difficult to
catch them. They are well made to escape their enemies, and they are so
flat they can hide in cracks or almost anywhere.

No, May, they do not fly very much. You see this one has short wings. It
is a male cockroach. The female of this species of cockroach has no
wings at all, only little hints of wings, as it were.

Such little useless wings we call "rudimentary" wings.

John says he thinks that is a long word for short wings.

Yes, but it is not a hard word,--ru-di-ment-ary, see if you can remember
it.

The croton bugs have longer wings and they sometimes fly.

If you were to spread out the wings of a cockroach, you would find it
had four.

What is that, May? You wouldn't spread them out for anything?

Yet wise men have been very much interested in our poor, ill-smelling
old cockroaches, and have studied carefully all about them.

   

If you dislike to touch the cockroach so much, perhaps you will look at
this picture of a croton bug.

See, the upper wings are different; the cockroach does not fly with
them, he merely uses them to cover up the under wings, and we call them
wing covers.

It is the under wings the cockroach flies with.

Cockroaches may not be pleasant, but who can say they are not
interesting?

What other insect lays its eggs in little bandboxes?

Here is one of the little boxes, shiny and hard.

   

This little case is at first a sticky substance that soon hardens. The
eggs lie in it side by side in two rows.

These cases remain attached to the abdomen of the female cockroach until
the eggs are all laid. Then the case falls off, and soon out runs a
crowd of infant cockroaches.

   

The case is something like a satchel that shuts with a spring. The
youngsters are packed close together, side by side, with their heads
towards the mouth of the satchel.

As soon as one hatches it pushes open the side of the case and creeps
out. Then the case springs together again to protect the rest of the
brood.

They are funny fellows when they first come out, little and
white-looking. But they eat and grow of course, and shed their skins,
and after each moult they become darker in color.

Now, do look again at this cockroach I have taken such pains to catch
for you and put into the tumbler.

I think even May will own that it has a cunning little head.

See it turn its head around to look at us.

After all, the cockroach is a knowing little fellow.

This one is hungry; it has had nothing to eat for some time. We will
give it this crumb of cake.

Be careful, or it will get away; it can run very fast, and it is very
quick, you see, in all its motions.

Ah, it is examining the crumb with the tips of its long antennæ.

See how daintily it touches the crumb.

It can smell with its antennæ, you know.

Now it has decided the cake is good to eat.

See how eager it is!

   

It almost stands on its head to reach just the part it wants.

John says he does not understand how insects smell with their antennæ.

I can tell you a little about it, John.

If you look at one of the cockroach's antennæ under the magnifying
glass, you will see it is made up of a good many short pieces, or
segments, as we call them, fastened together end to end.

Yes, Mollie, that is why it can move about so easily. It can curl up
like a whiplash, you see.

Next the head is a round segment that fits into a socket.

   

Double up your right fist and fit it into the half-closed palm of your
left hand.

There! That is like the ball-and-socket joint.

You see you can move your fist around in all directions.

The insect can move its antennæ in all directions because they are
fastened to its head by ball-and-socket joints.

On the segments of the antennæ, particularly towards the tip, are little
dots.

You cannot see the dots without the help of a strong microscope, but
they are there.

These little dots are sensitive spots. There is a nerve coming from the
insect's brain to each dot.

Some of the dots are sensitive to odors, just as the nerves of our nose
are sensitive to odors.

May thinks it is very funny that the insects smell with antennæ instead
of with noses.

The insects, no doubt, would think it very funny for us to smell with,
noses instead of with antennæ, if they thought about it at all.

The little dots on the antennæ are extremely sensitive to smells. They
are often much more sensitive than our noses.

Put a bit of food at some distance from a hungry cockroach, and it will
not be long before a pair of long, sensitive feelers will come waving to
and fro out of some dark corner.

   

Little Mrs. Cockroach has smelled the dainty morsel, and, as soon as it
is dark, out she will run, her feelers moving eagerly this way and that,
until she has found it.

Yes, May, insects also feel with their antennæ. That is why the antennæ
are often called "feelers."

There are other dots on the segments that are sensitive to touch.
Sometimes there are tiny hairs on the antennæ, also sensitive to touch.

The little fellows feel and smell, yes, and oftentimes _hear_ with their
antennæ.

Many insects have spots sensitive to sound on the antennæ.

Yes, indeed, May, it is wonderful that such tiny threads as an insect's
antennæ should hold so many kinds of sensitive spots.

An insect's antennæ are among the most wonderful things in the world.

And _I_ think a cockroach, in spite of its bad reputation, is a very
wonderful little fellow.

What is that, May? Our cockroach is drawing one of its antennæ through
its mouth?

Ah, yes, see it clean its antenna, children.

It seems to nibble at it as it draws it through its mouth.

Insects are very careful to keep their antennæ clean.

It would not do to let these sensitive spots become covered with dust,
you know.

   



Isn't this a pretty place to sit down and--

"Ouch! ow! ow! ow!"

Why, May, what is the matter?

Anybody would think you had seen a cockroach.

What has she found, John?

   

Oh, it is a walking stick!

Why do I call it that?

Look and see.

Does it not look like a stick?

And does it not walk?

Then why is not walking stick a good name for it?

May thinks its legs look like a collection of pine needles, for they are
green and flat on the upper joints.

It is as pretty as it is queer, with its brown body and its green legs.

This is the male walking stick; the female has brown legs. She is brown
all over, just the color of dried leaves, and she is not as slender as
her mate.

Mollie thinks it is the long and slender thorax that makes the walking
stick look so queer.

See its thorax. Its six legs are attached to its thorax, which is as
long and as slender as the abdomen.

John thinks it looks queer because everything about it is so long and
slender.

   

Long antennæ, long legs, long thorax, long abdomen--that is Mr. Walking
Stick.

Sir, why do you have such long antennæ? Can you hear and feel and smell
extra well because of them?

I wish you could tell us about them.

Now where is it?

Oh, yes, it is standing on that brown twig. It is so nearly the color of
the twig and so much the shape of a little stick itself, that it is not
easy to find it.

There, it is walking off again.

   

It has a good name, for I am sure that if a stick tried to walk, it
could not do it more awkwardly.

See now, what it is doing, hanging by one foot from that twig.

How still it is.

Who would imagine, seeing it thus for the first time, that it was a
living creature?

The walking sticks feed on leaves, and I suppose their queer shape and
their color protect them from being eaten by birds.

A bird would have to be very close to a walking stick to tell it from a
twig.

The female drops the eggs on the ground, and leaves them to hatch out
and make their way in the world as best they can.

   

The young walking sticks look just like their parents, only of course
they are very small, and they are green in color, like the leaves they
eat.

Yes, little Nell, I should like to find some too; they must be cunning
little things.

They eat and grow and moult, and eat and grow and moult, until they are
grown up.

There are a good many species of walking sticks in the world,
particularly in hot countries; and to their family belong the longest of
known insects, some being nearly a foot long. Just imagine a walking
stick a foot long!

And some of them are quite prettily colored, though certain species are
not pleasant to handle, as they give forth a bad-smelling milky fluid
when disturbed.

They are gentle little folk, all of them, and move slowly about over the
leaves and twigs, not wishing to harm any living thing.

Some members of the walking stick family have wings, and these are even
more curious than those that have none.

Their wings and legs are flattened to look like leaves, so that it is
very difficult to find them among the foliage.

   

Yes, May, they are also the color of the leaves they live among.

Here is a picture of one that will give some idea of these strange
little people.

We have none of these leaf-like insects in our country, but we do have a
near relative to the walking sticks, though it does not feed on leaves,
I assure you.

How many of you are acquainted with his lordship, the praying mantis?

   

Charlie says he has seen these fellows in Kansas, and Nellie says she
has a cousin in the South who has told her about them.

Here is a picture of one; is it not a beauty!

Its wings are green and its body is brown, so that it can stealthily
creep about among the foliage without being noticed.

When at rest it holds its front legs up as though it were raising its
arms in an attitude of devotion.

But not a thought of devotion lies in that cruel little head. There is
only one idea there; and if any unwary insect were to come along, those
devotional arms would be thrust out with incredible rapidity, and the
unfortunate insect clasped tightly in them.

Then the mantis, hugging its prey in the strong trap-like clasp of its
spiked legs, would coolly proceed to devour it alive, eating it as a boy
would eat an apple.

   

This praying mantis is called a "mule-killer" in the South, where the
people think the brown liquor it spits out of its mouth, when disturbed,
is fatal to mules.

The mantis is also called a devil-horse, a rear-horse, a camel-cricket,
and many other names inspired by its outlandish appearance.

Some have even thought it looked wise, standing in that knowing attitude
with extended arms, and so it has been called prophet and soothsayer, as
though it could foretell what is going to happen.

Undoubtedly it never foretells anything but the approaching death of
some insect and possibly a coming change in the weather, for insects
often know when the weather is going to change long before we do.

Although our mantes are brown or green, there are a great many species
living in hot countries that are much more brightly attired; and when
you find yourself on a visit to the tropics, you must look for the
flower mantis.

It mimics in color the brilliant hues of the showy orchids in which it
hides.

It does not seem to wear its gorgeous robes from a love for the
beautiful, however, but rather that it may the better lie concealed in
the heart of the gay flowers, to pounce upon unsuspecting insects that
come there for refreshing draughts of honey.

   

In some parts of Africa the mantis is worshipped by the natives, and in
France these fellows are believed to point out the way to travellers by
stretching out one leg when questioned.

Its strange attitude, with uplifted arms, has won the mantis regard in
all parts of the world, though the insects it clasps in these uplifted
arms would not be likely to share the good opinion held of this hardy
cannibal.

For it is a cannibal, and enjoys eating another mantis as much as
anything else.

The mantes are terrible fighters, too, and if there is a meeting between
two of them, there is very apt to be a battle in which one is vanquished
and devoured by the other.

Our mantis lays its eggs, thirty or forty in number, on tree twigs, and
they are embedded in a soft substance that soon becomes very tough and
horny. These strange egg-cases of the mantis are easily recognized
because they look as though they were braided on top, as you can see in
the picture.

   

Yes, May, the tough covering is to protect the eggs from wet and from
prying birds and hungry insects.

The young mantes are similar to their parents, only they have no wings.
But they hold up their spiny front legs and catch insects, and they grow
and moult in the usual way.

While we have been talking about leaf-like insects and mule-killers our
walking stick has gone off.

   

Well, well, let him go, and good luck go with him.

I am glad you like the walking stick, children.

And now, May, let me tell you something.

This queer fellow is a very near relative of your friend, the
cockroach.

   


Don't you often wonder where they come from? The swarms of grasshoppers
in the late summer?

Charlie says he walked across a field last night where he believes there
were as many grasshoppers as there were blades of grass.

Just think of it! and yet they do not seem to do any harm.

In some places, however, they do a great deal of harm.

They come flying in swarms that darken the sun, and they settle on the
trees and the crops and eat up every green thing. There is nothing a
Western farmer dreads so much as the passing of the grasshoppers.

Grasshoppers are funny little fellows, and we like them--when there are
not too many of them.

Summer would not seem quite like summer unless we heard the grasshoppers
shrilling.

There are a great many species of them, and we have placed them in two
divisions,--The Shorthorned Grasshoppers and The Longhorned
Grasshoppers.

   



They have no horns, of course, but some have short antennæ that stick
out like little horns, and those we call shorthorned.

The right name for the shorthorned grasshoppers is locusts.

We call another insect a locust, but the shorthorned grasshoppers are
the true locusts.

Some say it was these locusts that John the Baptist ate with his honey
in the wilderness.

   

A good many people in different parts of the world still eat locusts.

They are said to be good food when roasted, but I would rather eat
roasted peanuts.

Come here, little locust, and let us look at you.

Now, stand still, and show us your short "horns."

See its eyes!

Yes, May, they are compound eyes, but I do not know how many facets they
have.

What a funny little rabbit face it has.

See it move its little mouth parts.

It bites bits out of the leaves and chews them up very fast.

Has it teeth? May is asking.

Well, yes, but not like our teeth. Sometime you must see the mouth parts
of the grasshopper under the microscope. They are very interesting.

Mollie says the locust has a cape on.

John says the cape is the top of its thorax.

   

Frank has been counting its legs; he says it has six.

See it walk. It uses all six legs to walk with.

But it does something besides walk with its hind legs.

Yes, it jumps with them. How long and large they are! Now watch it jump.

See! It draws those long hind legs close up to its body, then suddenly
straightens them out--and away it goes as though it had been shot from a
spring board.

John says its hind legs work just like a spring, and so they do. It can
leap several times the length of its body. Amy thinks it should be
called a grass-jumper instead of a grasshopper.

Suppose we all look carefully at the locust's long hind leg, segment by
segment.

What, John? You do not know what a segment is?

Well, a segment is the part between two joints. The joints are where
the leg bends, you know.

May proposes that we draw a picture of the long hind leg.

It will be fun to try.

There are two tiny segments close to the body.

If you are not careful, you will find only one.

You must look sharp to see both of them.

How well Charlie has drawn his! He has both the little segments.

   

The one next the body we will mark I, and we will call it the coxa.

The next little one we will mark II, and that we will call the
trochanter.

The long, strong one, III, we will call the femur.

The next one, long and narrow, we will mark IV, and call the tibia.

All the rest of the leg, made of several short segments, we will call
the tarsus, and we will mark it V.

Now how are we to remember all those hard names?

Here is a jingle that perhaps will help us:--

  _Coxa_ first, and then _trochanter_,
  Number three the _femur_ stands,
  After this, the long, straight _tibia_,
  And last of all the _tarsus_ comes.

Now let us see who can learn it first.

Charlie says we are taking a good deal of trouble over the hind legs of
a grasshopper.

   

Very true, Mr. Philosopher, but let me tell you something.

When we have learned the names of the segments in the grasshopper's hind
leg, we have learned the names of the segments in the legs of all
insects.

You see all the legs are made on one common plan, and it is very
convenient, as you will soon see, to have the parts named.

What a fine set of drawings of the grasshopper's hind leg we have!

Why do you suppose the coxa and trochanter are so small?

Yes, John, it is in order that the leg can move easily.

The grasshopper can turn its leg in almost any direction because of
these small upper segments.

It can put its leg up over its head if it wants to. Next to the little
coxa and trochanter is the longest and largest segment in the
grasshopper's leg; I suppose nobody remembers its name.

Listen to little Nell,--"number three the _femur_ stands."

So it does, and what a very useful femur it is!

If it were not for the long femur and the long, slender tibia, the
grasshopper would not be a grasshopper--it could not hop at all.

Watch the grasshopper, and see how he uses those long segments to jump
with.

   

First he draws the tibia close up to the femur--now he is off!

He just straightened those long hind legs out with a jerk, and away he
went!

   

What do you suppose the two little sharp spines at the end of the tibia
are for?

What, May? You did not see any spines?

   

Look again.

See, Charlie has drawn them very plainly in his picture of the
grasshopper's leg. Mark them _s_, Charlie.

Now we must all look at Charlie's picture.

He says he thinks he knows what the spines are for--they are to keep
the grasshopper from slipping when he makes his leap forward.

I have no doubt Charlie is right.

May wants us to look at the beautiful little hinge x where the femur and
the tibia are fastened together.

   

Let us mark it _X_.

See the little ball on the end of the tibia. How well it fits into the
hollow on the end of the femur.

In order to see this hollow or groove, you must look on the under side
of the leg.

Yes, John, it reminds us of the ball-and-socket joint, only this is a
hinge joint, and does not move in so many directions.

The tibia can move towards the femur and away from it on this hinge.

When our little friend gets ready to jump, he draws the tibia close up
to the femur. When he jumps, he pushes the femur quickly away from the
tibia.

If you watch the grasshoppers, you will soon understand just how they
use their hind legs in jumping.

The tarsus bends easily.

It has three joints.

The last segment is a cunning little foot.

What is John doing?

He is looking at the grasshopper's foot through the magnifying glass.
Wise John!

Let us all look.

Yes, Charlie, we will try to draw it.

Mollie has hers drawn already. Do not hurry too much, Mollie. You cannot
draw well if you hurry.

See the sharp claw on each side of the foot.

   

Let us mark these claws _a_ and _b_.

Between them is a flat little pad which we may as well mark _c_.

May says her picture looks like a crazy pond lily.

Let us see, May. Well, it _is_ rather funny.

If I were you, I should try again. Any child can learn to draw who will
keep trying.

Touch the grasshopper's foot with the tip of your finger.

How the little foot clings to you!

It clings by the two little claws that have caught in your skin, and
that hold fast.

   

What do you suppose the little pad between the claws is for?

It is important, I can tell you.

John says he has heard there is a little pad in the fly's foot that
enables it to walk on glass.

Yes, and it is the same with the grasshopper.

The little pad between the claws is fringed with hairs.

You can see them with a good magnifying glass.

Out of the tip of each hair comes a little drop of sticky liquid.

This fastens the foot to any smooth surface.

Many insects have these sticky hairs on their foot pads.

When a fly walks up a window pane, it does it by gluing its feet, one
after the other, to the glass.

I don't wonder you laugh.

No, Mollie, the glue does not harden and hold it fast.

The fly can easily pull its foot loose. The grasshopper cannot walk on
glass quite as well as the fly. Its foot pads do not cling so well.

   

Would you not like to know the name of these curious little foot pads?

We call the foot pad a _pulvillus_.

Some insects do not have sticky hairs on the pulvillus.

There are beetles that simply put the pulvillus so flat against a smooth
surface that it stays there by the pressure of the air above.

Some people think that is the way the pulvillus on the fly's foot acts.

Perhaps it acts both ways, sucking fast and sticking by hairs.

John wants to know if the beetle's pulvillus does not act just like the
"sucker" that boys make.

The sucker, you know, is a round piece of leather with a string attached
to the middle.

When the leather is wet and laid flat on the floor or on a smooth stone,
all the air below it is pushed out, and the air above presses so hard
that a boy cannot pull the leather up from the floor.

   

You can peel it up from one edge and let the air under easily enough,
and then a baby could lift it.

When the insect wants to move, it peels its foot loose.

It can do this very quickly.

Mollie wants to know what all these little sharp spines on the back of
the tibia are for.

Let us look at them.

There is a double row of them.

Do they not look a little like a comb?

I suspect that is what they are, the grasshopper's comb.

Insects are very neat little folks.

They are always cleaning their wings and their legs and their antennæ
and their bodies.

The spines on their legs are very convenient for that.

Charlie says he thinks the grasshopper's legs are as good as a whole box
of tools.

So they are, and you have not yet heard all they can do.

The funniest is to come.

Mr. Grasshopper sings his song with his hind legs!

He rubs the inside of his femurs against the outside of his wings.

There is a row of very fine spines down the inside of the femur for the
use of the little fiddler.

He scrapes away with these on his wing covers.

Yes, Ned, his femur is his violin bow, and his wing cover is his violin.

The noise he makes does not sound much like a violin, little Nell
thinks.

No, indeed, it does not.

It is the shrilling sound we hear in the grass in the summer time.

   

It is only the male grasshopper that sings.

The little lady grasshopper sits still and listens to him.

Now, let us look at the other legs.

The front pair are the smallest.

Can you find the little coxa and trochanter?

Yes, Charlie, we will draw the little front leg.

Let us number the segments as we did those of the hind leg.

See, the femur is larger than the other segments, but it is small as
compared to the femur of the hind leg.

The tibia is shorter, too, than the tibia of the hind leg.

The little tarsus is like the tarsus of the hind leg with its claws and
its pulvillus, only, of course, it is smaller.

The middle pair of legs is like the front pair, only larger.

Now, see how the legs are placed on the grasshopper's body.

   

The front pair are directed forward. When the insect walks, they pull.

The middle and hind legs are directed backward. When the insect walks,
they push.

Well, little legs, you all have your own work to do, and you surely do
it very well.

Let me see, who has front legs as odd as the grasshopper's hind legs.

Yes, Mollie, the mantis has.

Let us look again at the mantis.

Here is another picture of it.

Its hind legs are just common walking legs, you see.

And so are its middle legs.

   

John says they are directed forward instead of backward.

You can see why.

They have to take the place of the front legs, that do not touch the
ground at all.

They have to hold Mr. Mantis up, and pull him along when he wants to
walk.

Now, let us see if we can make anything out of these front legs.

The coxa is small and close to the body.

The trochanter, II, is very large and long.

Yes, Charlie, it increases the size and strength of the leg very
greatly, by being thus enlarged.

The femur, III, is large and strong, too, and it has a row of sharp,
spiny teeth down the inside.

The tibia, IV, is also well supplied with cruel teeth, and at the end of
it is the tarsus, as you see.

You know how the mantis uses these legs. The joint between the tibia and
femur is a strong hinge joint. If can shut the tibia close to the femur,
the spiny teeth of the one locking into the spiny teeth of the other,
and forming a terrible trap for the insects that are so unfortunate as
to get caught in its merciless grip.

Altogether, you see, it is quite a terrible leg, though it has no more
segments than a common leg.

The segments are changed in shape and size from the regular leg
segments.

When any part is changed from the regular shape or size, we say it is
_modified_.

The front legs of the mantis are modified to catch and hold its prey.

Yes, John, the hind legs of the grasshopper are modified too.

They are modified to jump with.

Ned says he didn't know there was so much to learn about a little thing
like an insect's leg.

Yes, indeed, there is a great deal to learn about all living things.

I wonder how you would like to look at the grasshopper's wings for a
little while.

Here is one with large wings.

   

See how they lie along each side of the body.

They come together on top like the ridge of a sloping house roof.

Yes, May, they are the roof to the grasshopper's body, and they help to
protect it.

Let us gently spread them out.

Ah! these roof wings are not what the locust flies with at all.

See, folded up under them is a pair of delicate gauzy wings.

   

If we are careful, we can spread them out.

We will use this dead grasshopper that Charlie has found.

What pretty wings! So dainty! And how cleverly they are folded up, like
little fans.

Who would imagine such delicate gauzy wings were folded away under the
hard, stiff roof wings.

The roof wings are called wing covers, because they cover up these
pretty inner wings.

The locust does not fly with the wing covers.

It spreads them out wide to get them out of the way.

It flies with the inner wings.

   

How pretty the flying wings are when they are spread out!

See, over there goes a grasshopper whose flying wings are bright yellow.

And there goes another with red flying wings.

Some of the grasshoppers are almost as pretty as butterflies when they
are flying.

They show their gay inner wings only during flight.

As soon as the grasshopper comes to rest the inner wings close of
themselves.

The wing joints act like springs.

The grasshopper does not have to think about shutting up its wings.

   

John says it has a spring in its wing covers too.

Open the wing cover.

There, it locks itself, as it were, and stays open without any effort on
the part of the grasshopper.

You see the grasshopper wants its wing covers to stay open and out of
the way of the inner wings when it flies.

So it just opens them, and there they are.

It moves the inner wings very fast indeed when it is flying. It would
not do at all for them to be fastened open.

If it did not move them, it could not fly. The wings fairly _whirr_,
they go so fast. They beat against the air, and thus the grasshopper is
pushed along through the air.

As soon as it is done flying it stops moving the wings, and they
instantly close of themselves.

   

Then it unlocks the wing covers and they shut down over the inner wings.
They shut down very tightly. They overlap, as you can see, just below
where they are fastened to the insect's body. Thus they form a very good
roof.

   

What wonderful wings the grasshopper has!

And there is something more to be said about them.

Some species of locusts use their wings as musical instruments. When
they wish to, they rub the upper end of the inner wings against the
upper end of the wing covers when they are flying.

This makes the crackling sound we sometimes hear when the locusts fly.

What is that, Mollie? You have caught a locust that has no wings at all?

Who can guess why?

Ah, yes, our wise John says he thinks it is because it is a young one.

What makes you think so, John?

I know, you remembered the larva of the dragon fly and of the May fly.

   

Those larvæ had no wings at first, but the wings grew, and finally at
the last moult they were full-sized.

When first hatched, the locust larva is like the full-grown locust,
only, of course, it is very small, and it has no wings at all.

It is a little dot of a thing with an enormous head.

Here are three clinging to a blade of grass.

Are they not funny little rascals!

The baby locust eats and grows and moults until, finally, the wings
begin to show as little pads at its sides.

   

It is easy to find these half-grown grasshoppers in the middle of the
summer.

Here is one that little Nell has caught.

See its wing pads.

Mollie says they are rudimentary wings.

It continues to eat and grow and moult, and the little wings are moulted
off with the rest of the skin--for the wings of the insect are only
modified parts of the skin.

But there are new and larger wings underneath, and these grow and are
moulted off with the next skin, until, at last, the grasshopper is
full-grown, with full-grown wings.

It will not moult any more after that.

When full-grown, the females lay their eggs.

Where do you suppose they lay their eggs?

Some of them make a hole in the ground.

The end of the abdomen is very strong and sharp, and the locust can make
a hole with it quite easily.

When the hole is made, then the eggs are laid in it, and the locust
covers the opening to the hole with a sticky substance to keep out the
wet.

The eggs usually lie in the ground all winter.

   

Just think of the locust eggs there are under our feet as we cross the
fields!

Millions and millions of little eggs are hidden in the ground.

Early in the next summer the little eggs hatch, and then tiny locusts
creep up out of the earth and go hopping about everywhere.

Most of the full-grown locusts die in the fall.

As you know, the young ones have no wings, and this is why there are so
few winged locusts early in the summer.

Some locusts make their holes in fence rails or in old stumps.

It is the locusts, or shorthorned grasshoppers, that sometimes come in
swarms that darken the sun.

There is nothing the Western farmer dreads so much as a swarm of
locusts.

I have heard how the grasshoppers came in Kansas one year.

They appeared all of a sudden in countless millions.

They were piled up against the fences clear to the top.

They swarmed into the houses, and in places on the railroad track they
were piled so deep the trains could not run through them.

Think of a railway train being stopped by grasshoppers!

They stripped every leaf from the trees and left them as bare as in
winter.

They ate up every blade of grass.

But in the East they do not do so much damage, though they sometimes
cause the farmers serious loss. When summer comes we may listen to their
cheery din with pleasure.

I am sure we shall enjoy the merry sounds of the grasshoppers all the
more now that we know something about how they are made, and something
about the little fellow that makes them.

   




Probably it was the longhorned grasshoppers that Charlie saw so many of
in the meadow.

Look, next time, Charlie, and see if the swarms that start up before you
have not long, slender antennæ.

See, here is one.

Its antennæ are like threads, and they are longer than its body.

If you were to look at its tarsus, you would find it had four joints
instead of three.

Otherwise, the longhorned, or meadow grasshoppers are very much like the
locusts, or shorthorned grasshoppers.

John says he thinks the meadow grasshoppers are more slender and
delicate in shape.

That is true, as a rule, though there are some species of the locusts
that are as slender as the longhorned grasshoppers.

But there is one thing about these longhorned fellows that will amuse
you.

Some of them have ears on their front legs!

It is not uncommon for insects to have hearing organs on their front
legs.

You know what an ear is. It is something to hear with. The hearing part
of our own ears is way inside, out of sight.

The outer part of the ear, that we can take hold of, is only a sort of
funnel to gather up the sound, and we could still hear if this part of
our ears were cut off.

Way back inside the ear is a little curtain, or eardrum, made of a thin
membrane.

When sounds enter the ear they cause the eardrum to tremble or vibrate,
and this excites the nerve of hearing that is behind the eardrum.

Now some grasshoppers have a little flat membrane on the tibia of each
front leg. It is an eardrum. Behind it is the nerve of hearing. When
sounds strike the eardrum it vibrates and excites the nerve of hearing.

   

So you see the insects have _ears_, though they have no funnel-like
outsides to them.

So, after all, there isn't so _very_ much difference between the way the
grasshoppers hear, and the way we hear, although they do hear with their
legs.

Yes, Ned, it is about the same thing when they hear with sensitive spots
on their antennæ.

The sounds strike the sensitive spots, which are tiny eardrums, and
cause the nerves that come to them to hear.

You see, after all, an ear is only a membrane able to vibrate when
sounds strike it and a nerve sensitive to those sounds.

It does not matter much where the ear is located. Our ears are on either
side of our head, and so are the ears of all the higher animals.

But the ears of the insects are more useful to them when on the antennæ,
or the legs, or some have them on the abdomen. An ear is an ear wherever
it happens to be, and the insects hear well enough with theirs.

   

In many species of the longhorned grasshoppers, the male has a curious
musical instrument on his wing covers, close to where they grow from the
body.

Little Mr. Grasshopper sings to his lady-love by rubbing the upper parts
of the wing covers together. You see the round places at _X_,--those are
the modified parts of the wing cover, by means of which he can make his
music.

What is that, May? Your grasshopper has a long sword at the end of its
body?

   

Yes, that is its ovipositor. Ovipositor means "egg-placer."

With this long, sharp ovipositor the grasshopper can roughen the bark of
twigs or make holes in the stems of plants or in the earth.

Then the eggs are guided down through the long ovipositor to the place
prepared for them, and fastened there by a gummy substance.

   

Only the female grasshoppers have the long, sword-shaped ovipositor.

The ovipositor of the locust is not long and sword-like.

It is short, but it is strong and sharp, and you remember how the locust
uses it to dig with.

Yes, indeed, Mollie, there are a great many species of locusts and
grasshoppers, and some of them are very beautiful.

In hot countries they sometimes grow to an enormous size.

May is asking why they make molasses.

No, Ned, of course it isn't molasses. Children call it molasses because
it looks like it.

Now, May, where does it make its molasses?

In its mouth, you say, and then it spits it out on your finger.

What? You don't like its old molasses on your finger?

No, of course not.

It smells bad, and it is sticky and disagreeable to the touch, and if
you happen to put your finger in your mouth it has a nasty taste.

   

John says he hates to touch the grasshopper on account of this molasses.

You _all_ do?

Well, I guess that is why it makes its molasses; it doesn't want you to
touch it.

It doesn't want birds to eat it, or other insects to bother it, and so
it smears them with this ill-smelling, sticky liquid.

Some birds eat it, however, in spite of its molasses.

Turkeys do.

What is that, Ned? turkeys are not birds, you think?

What are they?

If you think about it, you will have to come to the conclusion that
turkeys are birds.

Then chickens and ducks and geese must be birds?

Well, so they are. They are all birds.

But to return to turkeys.

A flock of turkeys will spread out in a long line, and go across a
field, driving the grasshoppers ahead of them, and eating them as fast
as they can pick them up.

It is a funny sight to see a big flock of turkeys hunting grasshoppers
in a meadow.

It is not funny to the grasshoppers, though.

What is that, Charlie? The grasshopper somehow reminds you of the
praying mantis?

Do you know it is a near relative of the mantis?

Now, I will tell you something funny about the mantis.

It makes "molasses" like the grasshopper. Yes, it is this harmless
"molasses" that has given it the name of "mule-killer."

I will tell you something else. If you lie down in the grass and watch
the grasshoppers, you will have a good time, and you will see some
strange things.

Nobody can tell you very much about the grasshoppers--or about the
living creature. The best way is to use your own eyes and watch.

Just lie down in the grass perfectly still, and soon the insects that
live in the grass will begin to appear.

   

What they will do you must find out for yourselves; but you may be sure
it will be worth finding out,--the funny, clever, wise little
people!--ah! they are good to watch.

They will soon go on chirping and shrilling and rasping and kricking and
tapping and whizzing and whirring and buzzing all about you; and if you
listen sharp, perhaps you can understand some of the things they say.

And this I am sure of; if you really watch and listen, you can learn to
know the different insects by their sounds, just as you can know the
birds by their songs. You can even tell whether you are listening to the
meadow grasshopper, or the locust.

If I thought you were not tired of hearing how grasshoppers are made, I
should tell you some more.

John says he would like to know some more.

Well, then, I will tell you about their rings.

You can see the rings of the grasshopper people very plainly in their
abdomens.

   

Here is a picture of a grasshopper. It is not all drawn. The legs and
wings are not shown, and the abdomen is drawn by itself so you can see
it easily.

There are ten rings, you see.

The rings are covered with a hard, horny substance.

This horny substance is what makes the body of the insect so stiff. It
would be soft but for the chitin, as the horny substance is called.

It is better for the insect to have a chitinous covering.

If you had no bones, you would be glad to have your skin hardened with
chitin.

You see how it is, you wear your skeleton inside. Your skeleton is of
bones; it is an inside skeleton.

The grasshoppers and all the insects wear their skeleton outside. It is
made of chitin; it is an outside skeleton.

Insects have no bones.

They do not need any. They are kept stiff by the chitin.

Each ring in the insect's abdomen is made of four pieces, the back
piece, the side pieces, and the under piece. You can see the back piece
and one side piece in the picture, but you cannot see the other side
piece nor the under piece without turning the insect over.

The rings are made in pieces so the insect can move.

Suppose each ring were made of one stiff piece like a finger ring. What
a poor stiff, old grasshopper it would be! The rings are called
segments.

Segment number one has only a back piece, you see.

All the other segments have four pieces.

Segments two, three, four, five, six, seven, and eight are alike.

Segments nine and ten are modified to form the ovipositor.

The segments are fastened together by skin. The skin is soft so the
segments can move back and forth.

The segments can be crowded close together to shorten the abdomen.

The segments can be separated from each other to lengthen the abdomen.

There is no chitin in the skin between the segments. It is soft so the
segments can move.

Do you know how a telescope is made?

The abdomen of the insect can lengthen and shorten somewhat like a
telescope.

It is easy to see the rings in the abdomen of the locust or grasshopper.

Now, what about the thorax?

That, you tell me, has no rings.

   

Look again, and look carefully.

You will have to see another picture.

This is a picture of the head and thorax of the grasshopper. It is drawn
to show the separate parts of the thorax.

Yes, John, the thorax has three segments. They are grown so close
together you would not suspect it until you looked very close.

The front legs are fastened to the first segment.

What is fastened to the middle segment?

Yes, May, the middle pair of legs and the wing covers.

Mollie says the long hind legs and the flying wings are fastened to the
third or hind segment.

Oh, you funny little folks! you are all made up of rings.

Yes, indeed, little Nell, the segments of the thorax are made of chitin;
they are very stiff.

Ned thinks the segments of the legs are made of chitin too.

Their outside shell certainly is.

The whole outer shell of the insect is made of the horny chitin.

You hard little chitin-covered, segmented people, you are very different
from us.

Ah! yes, May, they are like us in many ways.

Indeed, Mollie, insects do have brains.

They have muscles, too, to move their little bodies with.

We have muscles under our skin, you know. The muscles move our arms and
legs and bodies.

If you clasp your fingers around your arm and then move your arm, you
can feel the muscles.

The insects have muscles inside their chitinous shells. The muscles move
their bodies.

The muscles are very, very strong.

They are stronger for their size than the muscles of a horse.

John, do you know how heavy a load a horse can pull?

Well, it cannot pull a load equal to the weight of its own body.

Now, listen to this,--almost any insect can pull a load that is five
times the weight of its body!

Ah, yes, some insects can pull a much heavier weight than that. The
honey bee, for instance, can pull a load twenty times as heavy as its
body.

And think how our little insect friends can jump! Why, a kangaroo cannot
begin to jump like a grasshopper.

No, indeed, Ned, the finest jumper in the world of men cannot begin to
jump as well as a grasshopper, not even with the aid of a spring board.
He is a mere baby in comparison.

Ah, yes, we can do a great many things better than the grasshoppers,
but, you see, they can do some things better than we can.

What is that, John?

You want to know about the mouth parts of the grasshopper?

Suppose we leave the mouth parts.

They are difficult to understand. We have had a good many new names to
learn lately.

What, May? You can't remember such hard words?

Oh, yes, of course you can.

You don't mind learning "rhinoceros," and "Mississippi," and
"Popocatepetl," and "eenie, meenie, monie mike," and they are quite as
hard as femur and tibia; and, besides, you have a femur yourself! Did
you know it?

Your thigh bone, like the grasshopper's thigh, is called a femur.

Yes, Mollie, there is a bone in your leg called the tibia, and you have
a tarsus in your foot.

So, after all, when you are learning hard words about insects you are
learning a great deal besides, as you will find.

   



Katy did!

Katy didn't!

Katy did!

Well, well, did she or didn't she, and what of it anyway.

Come here, Katy did and Katy didn't, the children want to see you.

She's a pretty little Did and Didn't, isn't she.

Katy, why do you not know your own mind and always tell the same story?

Krick--krick--krick, there, she is talking; that's her way of saying
"Katy did."

Krick--krick--krickkrick. Now she has said "Katy didn't."

Well, we never shall know anything more about it.

No, little Nell, she doesn't really say Katy did or Katy didn't, but it
sounds like that, and we make believe she says it.

John says he is sure the katydids are first cousins to the grasshoppers
and locusts, and so they are.

They are very closely related to--which division of locusts, do you
think?

Oh, yes, the longhorned, of course.

See their long, long antennæ, and the male has the same little musical
places on his wings, little membranes that vibrate and make his song of
Katy did and Katy didn't.

   

No, the little lady katydid cannot sing--only the little male, and he
keeps it up all night long.

We sometimes wish he would get tired or sleepy and stop, but he never
does.

Why do you suppose he likes to sing so well in the night?

The katydids generally live on trees and bushes.

Yes, they are a beautiful, pale green people, and that is one reason we
do not often see them. It is not easy to find a katydid among the green
leaves.

The female katydids have a long sword-shaped ovipositor with which they
roughen the bark on twigs, and place the eggs there, fastening them with
a gummy substance.

The egg is glued fast so it will not fall off.

It hatches into a little dot of a katydid that has no wings, but, like
the larvæ of the other insects we know about, it eats and grows and
moults, and at last its wings and the rest of its body are full grown.

It casts its skin for the last time; it is no longer a larva, but a
full-grown insect.

Yes, May, we call the young of all insects larvæ.

   

See this dainty katydid that Charlie has caught for us.

How pretty it is!

Its feelers are like long green threads.

And how sensitive they are!

It quickly starts away when we touch one of the feelers.

Yes, Mollie, the katydid walks more than the grasshopper.

It can jump well with those long, slender hind legs. How beautiful its
hind legs are! They are longer and more delicate than those of the
grasshopper.

And its wings, how gauzy and dainty! Its wing covers are not so stiff as
those of the grasshopper. They look almost like flying wings, they are
so delicate.

See, they open, and fasten themselves open, like the wing covers of the
grasshopper; and when they are at rest they overlap like the wings of
the grasshopper.

The inner wings are like fine lace.

They look too delicate for use, and yet the katydid flies very well
indeed with them.

They are a little longer than the wing covers.

   

When the katydid is at rest you can see the tips of the wings extending
beyond the ends of the wing covers.

The part of the inner wing that extends beyond the wing covers is green,
like the wing covers, you see.

But the rest of the inner wing is not green, it is like very thin glass,
or like fine isinglass.

Look for a moment at the long curved ovipositor of the female katydid.

If you look sharp, you will see teeth on it like a little saw. It is
with these teeth the little katydid is able to rasp the surface of the
twigs, and make a place to fasten her eggs to.

Her wings are wrapped about her form like an ample cloak of green.

   

Now, my little katydid, you may fly away if you want to.

We are very much obliged to you for letting us look at you, and we hope
we have not troubled you too much.

See her go!

How prettily the katydids fly.

They seem almost like little birds.

I am sure they love to fly about in the bright summer-time.

Happy katydids.





Now what strange-looking little creature are you?

John says it looks like a grasshopper, only it has no wings and its body
is not that of a grasshopper.

May says it looks like a cricket, only it has the long legs of a
grasshopper.

It is called the cricket-like grasshopper, and it is partly like a
cricket, as you see, and partly like a grasshopper.

It is a funny little fellow that lives around in dark corners, usually
in the woods.

Do see those long, spiny legs!

   

How he _can_ jump.

He has strong, short, sharp spines on the femurs and on the tibias.

He has spines on all his legs, and what long feet he has!

Yes, Nell, his antennæ are longer than anything else about him. I
should think they would be in his way.

He has no wings at all, and he never will have any.

He has two pairs of feelers in front of his mouth that show very
plainly. They show more plainly than the mouth parts of the grasshopper,
though they are quite like them.

Yes, Ned, they are larger than the mouth parts of the grasshopper.

There is another little fellow very similar to the cricket-like
grasshopper.

It has no wings, and the top of the thorax is like a broad shield.

It is called the shield-backed grasshopper.

See if you can find one of them.

   


   


Chirp! chirp!

Chirp! chirp!

Ah, listen to that cheery song. It is the cricket on the hearth singing
thus gayly.

Dear little cricket; he lives in the corner by the fireplace. When all
is still we hear his cheery chirp! chirp! chirp!

Sometimes he comes peering out and runs across the hearth, a little
black fireside fairy.

Do you know one of the prettiest stories in the world has been written
about a cricket?

Charles Dickens wrote it, and it is called "The Cricket on the Hearth."

Be sure to read this beautiful story. If you do not own it, ask to have
it for Christmas. It is in the book of "Christmas Tales," a book that
everybody ought to have.

Grasshoppers and katydids are pleasant people, but they live out of
doors, and they do not seem quite so much like our very own little
friends as the crickets.

Of course the crickets live out of doors, too, only once in a while one
of them comes into the house to live with us.

We hear them chirping in the grass and among the stones.

   

There is a certain place near the seashore where the rocks are alive
with the black cricket folk.

They come peeping out at you from all sides. They skip over the rocks,
and you will often see a pair of long feelers and an inquisitive little
head looking around a corner.

You too, know there are crickets, little Nell?

Let us go and see them.

Ah, yes, there is one, looking at us out of inquisitive eyes, over there
by that big stone.

   

Of course they are cousins to the grasshoppers. I knew you would guess
that right away.

Yes, John, the little cricket people have flat backs.

Their wing covers do not make a peaked roof over their backs, but are
flat on top and bent down at the sides like a box cover.

   

They are not so long as the wings of the grasshopper, but they overlap
on top.

Sometimes they are not so long as the body of the cricket.

Just watch now!

How spry the cricket folk are!

They jump well, but they also run well. They are always running about as
though they enjoyed it.

It is not easy to catch one of them unless we, too, are "as spry as a
cricket."

Funny little rascals, to come peeping at us like that, from out the
crevices in the stones.

When we stir,--pop! they are back out of sight.

They eat leaves, and they enjoy a piece of nice, ripe fruit, or a bit of
juicy vegetable.

See here, one has jumped on my hand and is sitting quite still.

It is a male cricket.

   

How do I know that?

May says because it has no ovipositor.

Yes, that is one way to know.

Look at his wing covers.

  : MALE CRICKET 

See how they are ribbed.

  : FEMALE CRICKET 

Now look at this cricket Mabel has caught. It is a female, and its
wings, you see, are not ornamented like those of the male.

   

Do you know the meaning of his heavily ribbed wing covers?

Why, his wing covers are his musical instruments. See one of them
magnified.

It is divided into spaces like so many little drum-heads. The ridge that
runs across the top of the wing is something like a file in structure.

When little Mr. Cricket is in the mood for chirping, he raises his wing
covers and rubs them together.

This throws the stiff membranes of which the wing covers are made into
vibration, and the result is the cheery call of our little black fairy.

Little Nell says the cricket is more like a brownie than a fairy, and
maybe she is right.

You can easily see the crickets rub their wings together if you watch in
the fall of the year.

John says, Why do you have to watch in the fall of the year?

Now who can guess?

Yes, May, it is because the crickets are then full-grown, and have
large wing covers. At first, in the early summer, they have no wings,
and so of course, we could not see them chirp.

The whole grasshopper tribe is a vocal one; the males all have musical
instruments, and in Japan, the people are so fond of the song of _their_
grasshopper folk, which are not quite like ours, that they make tiny
cages for them.

The chirpers are caught and put in these cages, and sold in the city
streets.

Yes, little Nell, the crickets make molasses. So do the katydids.

All these little hopping neighbors of ours seem to understand the useful
art of molasses making.

The mole crickets are different from the others.

   

They burrow in the ground like a mole, and we do not often see them.

The strangest thing about them is their hands.

No, of course they are not really hands, but they look like them.

All the joints of the fore legs are modified to form strong digging
tools, and they look very much like the paws of the mole.

   

They are troublesome fellows, sometimes, when they eat the tender roots
of the vegetables in the garden.

You all have seen the little tree cricket, but you might not recognize
it as a cricket, it is such a pale little creature.

Its light green body may often be seen on bushes in the summer-time,
and, if you look carefully, the form will tell you what the little one
is.

   




The crickets, grasshoppers, walking sticks, praying mantes, and
cockroaches, strange as it may seem, are all near relatives to each
other.

They all belong to one large family or order, the ORTHOPTERA.

Or-thop-te-ra, is it not a hard word!

It will not seem so hard when you know what it means.

It comes from two Greek words _orthos_, meaning straight, and _pteron_,
meaning a wing.

Straight-wing.

And do you know, it does not mean that the _upper_ wings are straight,
but that the under wings are folded down in long straight lines.

Now let us see if we can tell in what ways all of our Orthoptera are
alike.

They all have--?

"Four wings"--that is right, little Nell.

What, John? the walking sticks have no wings?

   

Not our walking sticks, but yet they belong to a winged family. You
remember the tropical walking sticks that have queer leaf-like wings, do
you not?

Are the four wings alike?

No, John says, the upper ones are narrow and stiff and serve as wing
covers.

The inner ones are broader and more delicate. They fold up when not in
use and are used to fly with.

Very good indeed, John. Now I will tell you something. The Orthoptera
all have mouth parts made to bite with. They do not bite anything but
what they eat, however. They are quite harmless so far as we are
concerned.

The young Orthoptera look like the old ones, only they have no wings.
They hatch out of the egg with a head, a six-legged thorax, and an
abdomen.

Now, come, let us look at all of our orthopterous friends again,
cockroaches first.

   

How do they get about, John?

Yes, indeed, they run, the rascals. They run fast too. They are flat and
their six legs are very much alike. They are well built for running and
hiding in cracks.

Suppose we call them the _Running Orthoptera_.

Now, look at our mantis.

He does not run very much. How is he different from the others?

Ah, yes, he has big front legs, and little Nell says he grabs things
with them.

   

So he does. Now, what shall we call these grabbers?

The Grabbing Orthoptera, Ned says.

Suppose we say instead the _Grasping Orthoptera_, because grasping
sounds a little better than grabbing. Do you not think so?

   

Now for Mr. Walking Stick.

We cannot very well call him a member of the Running Orthoptera, can we?

Ah, Mollie has it. We must call his kind the _Walking Orthoptera_.

His six legs are all long and slender, and he moves them slowly.

   

Now for those fellows with the long hind legs, the locusts and katydids
and crickets. Yes, all of you are ready to name them.

We call them--what?

May says, the Hopping Orthoptera.

John thinks Jumping Orthoptera would sound better.

And that is what we name them, the _Jumping Orthoptera_.

How many kinds of Jumping Orthoptera are we acquainted with, Ned? Now,
think before you speak.

He says we know the shorthorned grasshoppers, or locusts, the
longhorned, or meadow, grasshoppers, and the crickets.

Very well done, Ned.

May wants to know what has become of the katydids and the cricket-like
grasshoppers--she thinks Ned has left them out.

Ned says they belong to the longhorned grasshoppers.

Now you shall have a list of the Orthoptera that will help you to
remember them.

If we can group together things that are like each other, it is easier
to remember them.

       ORDER ORTHOPTERA.

      _Running Orthoptera._
          Cockroaches, Croton Bugs.
      _Grasping Orthoptera._
          Praying Mantis.
      _Walking Orthoptera._
          Walking Sticks.
      _Jumping Orthoptera._
          Shorthorned Grasshoppers, or Locusts.
          Longhorned, or Meadow, Grasshoppers.
          Crickets.

There are a great many species of Orthoptera in the world, and we have
seen but a very few of them.

But I can tell you, we feel a little better acquainted with you
orthopterous fellows than we did.

The dragon fly says we have not given him a place.

But, dear dragon fly, you belong to another family. You are not an
orthopterous insect.

Your order is called the ODO-NA-TA.

The wings of the Odonata are very different from those of the
Orthoptera.

   

You remember how they are?

Yes, Ned, they are stiff and covered with a close network of fine veins,
and all four of them are alike.

No wing covers, you see.

I do not know why they have the name Odonata.

The young Odonata are not like their parents, excepting that they have a
head, a thorax with six legs, and an abdomen. But they certainly do not
look like their parents!

No, John, the May flies do not belong to the Odonata. Their wings are
quite different.

   

Do you not remember how small the hind wings are?

The name of their order is EPH-E-MER-I-DA.

There is a big name for a little insect!

It comes from the Greek word _ephemeros_, and you know what it means.

What? Has everybody forgotten about the dainty little ephemeræ, that
live but a day?

That is what _ephemeros_ means, lasting but a day.

The stone flies have four wings, but they are not like those of the
Odonata, or of the Ephemerida.

Do you remember how the hind wings are folded?

Yes, May, in plaits, so these are the plaited wings, or
PLE-COP-TE-RA, from _pteran_, a wing, and _plecos_, plaited.

The little silver fish, as you remember, has no wings at all,
so its order is called THY-SA-NU-RA, from its bristle tail,
_thysanos_, in Greek, meaning a tassel, and _oura_, the tail.




   


Now, my children, do you know what a bug is? Most people do not.

They call every insect a "bug," but bugs are bugs, flies are flies, ants
are ants, and neither flies nor ants are bugs.

Indeed, no insects are bugs--excepting just bugs!

Our croton bugs are not really bugs. They do not belong to the bug
family.

   

A bug has four wings--when it has any.

But its wings are not like those of the Orthoptera or Odonata or
Ephemerida or Plecoptera.

Some bugs have no wings.

Young bugs are like old bugs, only smaller, and they have no wings.

You remember the Orthoptera and Odonata bite their food.

They chew it up and swallow it.

Bugs do not bite, they suck. Their mouth parts are often grown together
in the form of a tube that is sometimes very sharp.

They stick these sharp tubes or beaks into their food, and suck it up.





What, May; you want to see a bug? Well, that is easy enough.

Here is one in this pond at our feet. Do you know it?

   

Yes, John; it is the water boatman.

Nell says she doesn't see it.

There, Nell, that little thing that shines like silver under the water.
It is clinging to a weed.

No, we cannot see it very well unless we catch it.

Ned, do you think you can be spry enough to scoop it out with the net?

There, he has it,--no, it is off.

Well, we shall never see that one again; but here, in this corner of the
pond, see, several of them.

   

Now don't be in too great a hurry, Ned; they are hard to catch.

He has it!

Here, don't touch it,--bugs are biters, remember.

Put it in this tumbler of water, and clap the cover over
it--quick--so!--now we have it.

What is that, Mollie? I just said bugs do not bite, and now I call them
biters?

I don't wonder you are puzzled.

They do _not_ bite, but they pierce with their mouth tubes, and that
feels just as though they bit us. So we commonly speak of bugs as
biting.

If you wish to be very exact, we will hereafter speak of bugs as
piercing or sucking.

Now, Mr. Water Boatman, we are going to have a good look at you.

Nell says it is not like silver any more, but just a little black and
gray speckled bug.

That is because it is now on top of the water. When it goes under it is
surrounded with a layer of air, and that is what makes it look as though
it had on a silver dress.

May wants to know how it manages to take a layer of air down under the
water. If you were to look at it with a magnifying glass, May, you would
see it is covered with fine hairs; the air becomes entangled in these
hairs. Do you not remember how the leaf of the jewel weed, or
touch-me-not, as it is also called, shines when you plunge it in water?
It, too, is covered with fine hairs that hold air. Many leaves shine in
this way when put under water, and always because of the fine hairs
that prevent the air from being pushed out by the water. You see the
hairs on the bugs serve the same purpose as those on the leaves; they
hold fast the air.

Our water boatman breathes this air that surrounds him.

You know how insects breathe do you not?

Dear me, then I shall have to tell you.

They have no lungs; of course, so they cannot breathe with lungs as we
do.

Take a long breath--see how your chest rises--that is because you filled
your lungs full of air.

Well, the insects have to breathe air.

Every living thing has to breathe air. Nothing in the world could live
without air.

Even plants breathe the air, you know.

Now, there is a little row of holes or pores along each side of the
abdomen of the insect.

These are the breathing pores. No, May, the insects do not breathe
through their mouths, they breathe through their sides.

   

You can see the breathing pores, or spiracles, as they are called, very
plainly in many insects.

You can see them on the abdomen of the locust, and in some caterpillars
they are bright-colored spots.

There are spiracles on the sides of the thorax, too, but they do not
show so plainly as those on the abdomen.

The spiracles open into air tubes that carry air to the blood of the
insect.



If you watch a grasshopper or a bee, you can plainly see it breathe. The
abdomen moves in the bee as though it were panting. These movements of
the abdomen cause the air to go in and out. All insects move their
abdomens to send the air in and out, but it does not show plainly in all
of them, for, though insects need air, some of them can get along with
very little.

Yes, John, insects have blood. It is not just like our blood, but still
it is blood.

It is not generally red in color, though sometimes it is reddish, and
sometimes it is brown, or violet, or even bright green.

Yes, that seems strange to you, but you remember how ears are ears, and
serve to hear with, no matter where on the body of the creature they are
located. So blood is blood, and serves the purpose of blood, no matter
what its color. The blood of some insects has a very bad odor, and in
the case of certain beetles, when they are disturbed, this foul-smelling
liquid oozes out of the joints of the legs.

Yes, Mabel, it is probably used, like the "molasses" of other little
friends we know, to repel enemies.

But to return to breathing. Some larvæ breathe by gills, and do not have
spiracles until they are grown up, but all grown-up insects breathe by
spiracles.

Yes, John, the larvæ of the dragon flies and May flies breathe with
gills.

I thought you would remember that.

The water boatman breathes by spiracles, and carries his supply of air
with him. All grown-up bugs breathe by spiracles.

Now look down into the pond. I think you will see some water boatmen
anchored near the bottom.

Yes, May, they cling by their front feet. Their hind pair of legs are
rather odd-looking; they have a fringe of hairs on the inside.

John says their hind legs are modified to swim with.

Very good, John.

The hind legs are the oars that row these little boats about in the
water.

But why are the little boats that have come to anchor down there moving
their paddles so constantly?

Ah, yes; it is because they want fresh air to breathe.

You know there is always air in pond water, and they keep their paddles
moving, so as to change the envelope of air that surrounds them.

   

They know what to do to take care of themselves, if they _are_ nothing
but little bugs.

When winter comes, they go down to the bottom of the pond and bury
themselves in the mud. They lie there without moving or breathing until
spring, when out they come, as lively as ever.

Yes, certain other animals pass the winter in this way; the bears, for
instance, find a snug den and sleep all through the coldest winter
weather. We call this winter sleep of animals hibernation, and many of
the insects hibernate.

Yes, Ned, hibernating animals can get on with very little air; they
sometimes seem to need none at all, and they take no food.

May wants to know what these queer water boatmen eat.

They suck out the juices of other insects.

They must lay their eggs in the water, little Nell thinks.

And so they do, on water plants.

Near the city of Mexico there are species that lay enormous quantities
of eggs in the ponds, and what do you think? The Indians mix these eggs
with meal, make them into cakes, and eat them.

The Mexican bugs are gathered by the ton, too, and sent to England as
food for cage birds, fish, and poultry.

Little Nell thinks there must be a great many bugs in a ton. Indeed,
there are, probably about twenty-five millions of them; so you can
imagine Mexico is well supplied with water boatmen!

When the young ones hatch out they look like their parents, only, of
course, they are tiny little dots of things that have no wings.

But they eat and grow and moult like other larvæ until they are
full-grown insects.

What have you discovered, Ned? You look surprised.

The water boatman has no antennæ!

It doesn't seem to have any. But look carefully and I think you will
find some tiny ones tucked away under its head.

Nell wants to know if the water boatman has a thorax and an abdomen.

Indeed, it has, but you will have to look carefully to see them. Its
abdomen is short and thick and hard. The water boatman is much more
compact in form than the Orthoptera, or any of the other insects we have
studied.

You are right, John, an insect with a long abdomen, like the
grasshopper, could not get on very well in the water.

Now, May, take the cover off the tumbler. There!

Our water boatman was not slow to make use of his wings.

Well, good-by and good luck to you, little water boatman.

   


What, John? You know a water boatman that swims on its back?

That makes Nell laugh, and no wonder.

Yes, there is a little bug that swims on its back.

   

It is very much like the water boatman, and it has long paddles made of
its queer hind legs.

Unlike the water boatman, however, its back is not flat but is shaped
like the keel of a boat.

This being the case, it just turns over and swims with its keel-shaped
back in the water.

It is sometimes called the back-swimmer, and most boys are well
acquainted with it.

What do you think about catching it in your fingers, Ned?

Ah, you do not like to!

It has a very sharp beak for sucking the life out of other insects, and
if you succeed in getting hold of it, it will stick that into your
finger.

And my! how it does sting!

It is not an easy matter to catch it, however,--it is such a quick
little rascal.




A good many kinds of bugs live in the water, but perhaps the oddest of
all is the giant water bug.

It _is_ a giant!

Have you ever seen very large, flat brown bugs lying on the ground under
the electric street lamps?

Those are the giant water bugs.

They fly in the night from pond to pond, and are attracted by bright
lights.

They fly into the electric lights, and are killed in great numbers
sometimes.

This is such a common habit with them that in some places they are
called electric light bugs.

A good many people never saw these bugs until they were found dead
under the electric lights, and so they imagined they did not exist until
electric lights were invented.

But that is a very foolish notion; the bugs were here thousands of years
before electric lights were dreamed of.

The giant water bugs are not pleasant to handle when alive.

If you ever succeed in catching one in the water, which is not easy,
they slip about so quickly, be sure and not take it in your fingers.

The California children call a species they have there "toe-biters," and
they say they bite their toes when they go in wading.

The giant water bugs are the largest of living bugs, and they even kill
and eat fish.

Their fore legs can shut up like a jackknife. The tibia shuts into a
groove in the femur, and thus the bug is able to seize and hold its
prey.

It clasps its victim in its arms, as it were, and calmly proceeds to
suck out its blood.

In some species of the giant water bugs the female does not leave her
eggs in the pond to take care of themselves; she puts them on the back
of her mate, who is obliged to carry all of his progeny about with him
until they relieve him by hatching out and swimming off to see life for
themselves.




LITTLE MRS. SHORE BUG

   


May says she wants to hear more about bugs. Well, there is little Mrs.
Shore Bug. I think you must all know her.

She is the little bug that flies along in front of you on the seashore,
or, indeed, on the edge of any body of water.

She flits along just in front of you, and is so quick in her motions
that you will hardly ever catch her.

She does not fly far--she alights just far enough ahead to make you try
again to capture her, but when you think you have her, she isn't there!

   

She has sped off on one of her short flights, and so she will continue
to do as long as you continue to chase her.




Then there are the water striders.

They are bugs, and it is easy to guess how they got their name.

You surely remember the longlegged, dark colored fellows that straddle
about on top of the water, in ponds or in still pools in streams?

Who has not tried to catch them!

And how very seldom any one succeeds!

May knows where we can see some water striders close at hand.

They are on the pond in the meadow. Let us go.

Ah, you little ones! There you are, scampering over the water on your
airy, fairy feet, as though you were on dry land.

   

How they flash about! And what cunning dimples their little feet make on
the water when they stand still!

If we keep very quiet, they will stop darting about in that wild way,
and we can see them better.

Now, water striders, why do you behave so, and what do you eat?

Eat? Why, insects, of course. And as to behavior, they may well wonder
more at ours than we at theirs.

They skate about on the surface of the water all summer, and when winter
comes they hide away at the bottom of the pond, right under the water,
or along the edges of the banks.

When the warm spring sunshine wakes up the sleeping plants, then the
little water striders wake up too.

Out they come, to resume their endless skating and insect catching, but
now they lay their eggs, gluing them fast to water weeds.

The young water striders look like their parents, and they, too, like to
go circling and flashing over the top of the water, with their long legs
spread out.





What do you suppose is in this box?

Little Nell may open it.

There, out he comes--slowly, as though he were looking around and
thinking about it.

   

May says, "Hello, Mr. Walking Stick, you here again?"

Ho! ho! _is_ it Mr. Walking Stick?

You look again.

Mollie thinks, if she were going to name it, she would call it Mr.
Walking Threads.

Yes, it is more slender than even the walking stick.

What is that, John? You thought insects had six legs, and this has only
four?

Now, here is something for us to think about.

Ned says it has six long threads that might be legs, but it does not
walk on the two front ones.

It seems to use them as antennæ.

   

Ned says those front ones look to him to be jointed just like the
others, and he thinks they are legs.

Mollie says they have no little feet like the others, and she thinks
they are antennæ.

Well, well, what are we to do? Think of its having feelers that look
like legs or legs that look like feelers, so that you cannot tell which
they are!

Now it is beginning to move, and--Oh, ho, that long part in front is not
its head!

   

See, it separates into two--what?

Surely, two front legs.

See, they were folded up, somewhat like the front legs of the mantis,
only these could fold close together, being threadlike.

So the long threads are antennæ after all.

Now it has raised its head, which we easily see is quite round, with
tiny eyes, and the antennæ are growing out from the front of it.

What is it? A walking stick? A mantis?

   

Why! why! There it goes, sailing off in the air with a queer little
fluttering motion of its whole body.

It has wings!

John has caught it and brought it back.

Now let us see those wings, you strange little creature.

You will have to look close, but there they are, narrow, short, such
tiny wings! How _do_ you suppose it flies with them?

You seem queerer and queerer the more we look at you, little
what-shall-we-call-you.

But we know you are not a walking stick because our walking sticks have
no wings.

The truth is you are a--bug!

Yes, this little threadlike creature belongs to the same order as the
big flat giant water bug.

It grasps its victim, in its fore feet like the mantis, but instead of
biting its prey it sucks out the juices.

You would hardly expect such a delicate creature to catch and kill other
insects, yet such is the case.

No, I do not think it will pierce your finger with its beak. I have
often handled them, and have never been stung by one. We often see them
walking about in the grass and along paths.






IF we pay a visit to that hawthorn bush we shall probably find
a bug to our liking. Yes, here is one.

It is a tiny thing, I know, but wait until you see it under the
microscope.

Ah, I thought you would be pleased!

Nell says it looks as though it had on a lace party dress.

Is it not a dainty fairy!

We call it the lace bug.

It does not suck the juices of other insects, but instead it sucks the
juices of plants.

Its eggs are very curious. It lays them on leaves and glues them fast.
They look like little out-growths of the leaf.

The young lace bugs are like their parents in form, only, of course,
they have no wings and so they are not pretty.

   

Fairy lace bug, we are glad to make your acquaintance.




Now, here is a bug we all loathe. It is round and flat, and reddish
brown in color, and it has a disgusting odor.

But though we hate this bug, it is very fond of us. It has a short,
sharp tube folded down under its head, and this tube it likes to raise
up and stick into the skin of people, and suck out their blood.

It has no wings, only a pair of little scales where its wings should be.
Yes, May, these scales are rudimentary wings, and they are good for
nothing. It once had wings, but it preferred to go slipping about in
cracks and hiding in beds, until in course of time no wings grew, which
served it right.

It has antennæ and eyes and spiracles; indeed, it has everything a bug
should have but wings and good manners.

We call it the bed bug because its favorite home is in beds, so that it
can sally forth at night and feast upon its sleeping victims.

It lays its eggs in cracks and crevices, and each egg is like a little
jar with a rim and a lid at the top. When the young one hatches it
pushes off the lid. The young are in shape like their parents, only they
are very light colored, and almost transparent. They look like ghosts of
bugs, but they are very voracious ghosts indeed, and they eat and moult
and grow and become darker colored until they reach maturity.

One strange thing about them is that they can live a very long time with
nothing to eat, so that houses long vacated may still contain these
nuisances, that sally forth, eager to round out their emaciated forms at
the expense of the new occupants of the house.

The barn swallow is sadly afflicted by a species of these unwelcome
visitors to its nest, and the poor bats are also victimized by a species
of bed bug.

The bad odor comes from a liquid poured out of the back of young bugs,
and from the under side of old ones.

These insects are very undesirable acquaintances, and they breed so fast
that even one, brought into a house, may cause it to become generally
infested in a few weeks.

Eternal vigilance and great cleanliness are the housekeeper's only
safeguards.

There are some species of bugs that closely resemble the bed bugs, only
they have wings, and live on flowers or in the cracks of the bark of
trees.





There are a great many kinds of bugs on the leaves and flowers in
summer, and some of them do much damage by eating the vegetation.

One of the most troublesome of these is the red bug. Here is a picture
of one.

Its wings look as if they had an X drawn on them.

Let us spread out one of the wings.

Why do you all laugh?

Sure enough, Ned, how _can_ we spread out the wings of a bug in a
picture?

   

But there is a way out of that difficulty.

Yes, another picture.

Only the upper wings are spread out.

You see, the half of the wing next the body is stiff like a wing cover,
and the other half is thin and silky, and folds up under the stiff part.
When the insect flies it spreads out the under wings, too, for there is
a pair of thin, flying wings folded on the body under these upper wings.

These upper wings, that are half wing cover and half flying wing, are
characteristic of the bug order.

Not all the bugs have them, but a great many have.

The name of the bug order is HEM-IP-TERA, meaning half-wing.
You see why.

Yes, John, the word "hemiptera" comes from two Greek words, _hemi_,
meaning half, and, as you know, _pteron_, meaning a wing.

The young red bugs are like the old ones, excepting in color.

What do we call the young of insects, little Nell?

Yes, we call them larvæ. These red bug larvæ are bright red with black
legs.

They pierce the cotton plants in the South, and suck out the juices.

Of course, they grow and moult until they arrive at the adult form.

What, John? You do not know what "adult" means? Adult means "grown-up."

It is a short way of saying grown-up; and after this, when we mean a
grown-up insect, let us say an adult insect.

To return to the red bug. When it reaches the adult state, it is not
such a bright red, but rather of a reddish color with brownish wings
striped with light yellow.

Beside eating the juices of the cotton plants and thus injuring or even
killing them, the red bugs stain the white cotton and spoil it.

They are also troublesome in some parts of Florida, where they pierce
the skins of the oranges, and cause the fruit to decay.

   



There are a great many bugs injurious to vegetation, among them the
little chinch bugs.

They are so small, each one no larger than a plant louse, that you would
not think they could do much harm.

One of them could not, but when they appear in millions, then they are
terrible.

Here is one magnified to show the white wing covers with black markings.

   

Would you believe that this tiny insect has destroyed millions of
dollars' worth of grain in the United States?

What, Charlie? you should think they could be killed out? That is a very
difficult task. You see they are so small, and they breed so fast. There
are two broods of them in one year, and when they have eaten one grain
field they start off, millions strong, to another.

Of course a great many methods have been tried for getting rid of them,
and one very curious method you will like to hear about.

You know insects are subject to diseases.

What, Nell, you never heard of a sick bug?

Yet it seems they are sick sometimes, and certain diseases kill them.
Chinch bugs are not as healthy in some places as in others.

There is a contagious disease that kills them off in very great numbers.

Ned says he can guess what remedy the people apply to the healthy chinch
bugs that are eating their grain.

Yes, they introduce diseased chinch bugs into the grain fields with the
healthy ones. The contagion spreads and the bugs die!

There is another way of getting rid of some kinds of troublesome
insects. That is, to introduce an insect not injurious to vegetation,
that will prey upon the injurious ones.






One of the bugs we know the best and like the least is the stink bug.

It deserves its name.

John says he had one on his hand this morning.

How did you like it, John?

Did any of you ever pick berries where these bugs were?

See what a face Mollie is making! It is very evident that _she_ has.



What a nasty taste they give the delicious fruit.

Even the flavor of the red raspberry is spoiled if one of these bugs
pollutes it.

What makes them smell so? May is asking.

The disgusting odor is caused by a liquid that is ejected out of little
pores on the under side of the thorax.

The bug can eject this liquid when it pleases.

Most members of the bug order can eject a disagreeable liquid, though
few of them do it so successfully as the stink bug.

If the stink bug is not disturbed, it does not give forth the bad odor;
but when we jostle the bushes in getting the berries, that startles it,
and we get the benefit of its alarm.

Yes, undoubtedly the bugs make a bad odor for the same reason the
grasshoppers make molasses. They wish to repel their enemies.

Very few birds ever touch a stink bug.

Nell thinks a bird would be crazy to eat a stink bug.

Mollie says if it were not crazy when it began, it surely would be
before it got through!

Not only the bugs make these disagreeable odors.

Many other insects do.

The cockroaches, as we know, and one reason we dislike them so is
because of this offensive odor.

Some species of crickets, too, and indeed many, many insects give forth
odors from glands that exist just for that purpose.

No, indeed, these odors are not all alike. Some have a strangling
quality like ammonia, and sometimes the odors are not disagreeable. Some
insects have sweet odors, like perfumes.

   

The pleasant odors are not used to repel, but to attract.

If an insect wishes to see its mate, it may be able to give forth a
pleasant odor that will reach a long way through the air, and the mate,
smelling it, will follow it to its source. You see, this pleasant odor
is one way of talking; at least it is one way of sending a message.

Insects can detect odors much better than we can.

No doubt many insects produce odors that affect other insects, but that
are so faint we cannot smell them at all.

The sense of smell, even in the human being, is very wonderful. It is
the keenest of all the senses.

You have studied weights and measures, and you know how small a quantity
a grain of anything is. Well, you will be astonished to know that your
nose can detect the presence of 1/2,760,000,000 of a grain of mercaptan,
a substance having a very bad smell.

   

So you see, insects that can smell very, very much better than we would
be greatly influenced by the odors of other insects.

Some of the stink bugs, although so disagreeable if disturbed, are very
useful to us, as they eat other insects injurious to vegetation.

Most of them, however, eat fruits and vegetables, and some species do a
vast amount of mischief.





Yes, John, lice are bugs, and very mean bugs too.

They have lived at the expense of other creatures so long that they
cannot exist unless they have a living body to feed on.

Here is a picture of one very much enlarged. No wings, no beauty, a pale
white thing, all claws and mouth.

   

It has a long sucking tube by which it pierces the skin, and a sucking
stomach by which it pumps the blood into its mouth.

Such creatures are called parasites.

Yes, bed bugs are parasites too.

Besides the lice that live on human beings, there are species that
infest animals.





Bird lice are not lice!

That is, they do not belong to the bug order.

They belong to a small order by themselves, but they are parasites like
the lice.

The little white book lice that scurry away when we open an old book
that has been standing on the back shelf, are not lice, either; they
also belong to a little order of their own, and are constructed very
differently from the true lice.




May says she wishes that locust would keep quiet. It makes her warmer
than ever to hear him carrying on so this hot day.

John says it is the weather that is warm, not the song of the locust.

And yet, locusts generally sing during the hottest part of the summer,
so that we have learned to associate them with warm weather.

Since we must listen to its shrill out-cry, I wish we could also see
it.

Ah, that is a wish soon gratified! Here comes one out of John's pocket.

   

John says it is _not_ a locust.

Ah, yes, the shorthorned grasshoppers are the real locusts, and this
fellow has somehow got the name.

But it is not a locust.

It is also called the dog-day harvest fly, but it is not a fly, though
it looks considerably like one.

Really, you know, it is a--bug!

Yes, it belongs to the bug order.

Its true name is cicada, and its shrill midsummer song has been famous
from the beginning of time.

   

It looks like an enormous fly, but its mouth parts are the mouth parts
of the bug, and in other respects it resembles the members of the bug
order, when it is examined closely.

What glassy wings!

Let us spread them out carefully. Four of them it has.

The cicada, you see, has no wing covers. Nor are its upper wings, half
wing cover, and half wing, like those of so many of the bugs.

No, all four of its wings are alike, and all four are flying wings.

When it is at rest, the inner wings slip out of sight under the outer
ones, which fold down like a roof over its body.

See how beautifully the wings, are veined.

You think cicada has a very broad back, Nell?

So it has, and a broad head.

   

See its black eyes on the corners of its head!

How many facets have its eyes?

I wish I knew, but I do not. This, however, I can tell you. If you look
on the top of its head between its compound eyes, with a magnifying
glass, you will find it has three little eyes there.

These small eyes are simple, and are called _ocelli_.

Many insects have ocelli, indeed, some of the grasshoppers have these
extra eyes on top of their head.

May says the grasshoppers are very astonishing insects.

You think you know all about them, and you are all the time finding out
something new. You would not be apt to notice these little ocelli on the
grasshopper's head, they are so small, and besides, some of the
grasshoppers do not have them.

Yes, Mollie, it is the same with the crickets and katydids. Some species
have ocelli, and some have not.

If you look full in the face of a cicada, you can see the three little
round ocelli between the compound eyes.

   

They show very plainly with a magnifying glass.

Indeed, it is difficult to explain what the ocelli are for.

Some think they are to see objects close at hand, while the compound
eyes see more distant objects.

Others think the ocelli are only capable of distinguishing light from
darkness.

Yet others think they are merely a "survival" of the eyes of the worms.
You know, way back in time, before there were winged insects there were
worms. In some way the insects are descended from the worms, and though
they have got rid of many of their wormlike parts they still retain some
of them, and probably among these are the ocelli.

When an animal of any kind keeps organs that belonged to its ancestors,
but that are of no use to it, we say these organs are "survivals." They
have not yet had time wholly to disappear.

Yes, John, the time may come when the ocelli will disappear from the
insects. A good many insects have lost them already.

Indeed, you are right, May; they have lost them because they did not use
them. When an animal ceases to use an organ in course of time, for lack
of exercise, that organ dwindles away and disappears. It generally takes
a very long time for this to happen.

Yes, Mabel, thousands or even millions of years may pass before an organ
that has gone out of use entirely disappears. As generations succeed
each other each generation loses a little power in that organ until,
finally, there is no organ left.

John is puzzled to know just what is meant by an organ. It is some
particular part of the creature. An arm is an organ, a stomach is an
organ, an eye is an organ. The whole creature is made up of organs, and
is called an _organism_.

Your whole body, John, is an organism, but your legs and arms are
organs. Now, I think you understand.

Our cicada has one organ that is very interesting; it is the little
apparatus by which it sings.

Turn it over, Ned, and all of you look at the two thin plates lying
against the abdomen just below the thorax.

Those membranes are like two little kettle drums, and they are its song
organs.

There are other membranes beneath them, and large muscles within the
body to move the membranes.

The membranes being set in rapid vibration we get the shrill cry of the
locust.

Only the male has the kettle drums. In the female these organs are
rudimentary, and she is dumb.

   

Cicada, you are a pretty little thing with your clear, glasslike wings
and your black body with red and green trimming. See its mouth lying in
that little groove under its head. It is a tube, and sharp. The cicada
sticks it into a leaf or young twig to suck out the juice.

Nell wants to know if the young cicadas are like the old ones. Indeed,
they would be cunning little things if they were, and--yes, they _would_
look very much like flies.

But the young cicadas are queer babies, indeed. They do not look very
much like their parents, although they have a head, a thorax, and an
abdomen.

   

The female cicada makes a slit in the bark of the tree twig with her
ovipositor and lays the eggs there. As soon as they hatch out, the tiny
cicadas drop down to the ground and burrow into the earth.

You would not know that they are cicadas, they are such queer-looking
little things. But they have strong, sucking mouth parts with which they
pierce holes in the roots of trees and suck out the juices.

Of course these larvæ grow and moult and continue to do so until they
have moulted a good many times and grown quite large.

They stay down under the ground two years.

At the end of that time they crawl up to the surface of the earth in the
early summer.

They climb trees, or weeds, or fence posts, and then the skin splits
down the back for the last time, and out comes a full-grown cicada with
bright glassy wings.

The wings of the larva do not grow at each moult like the wings of the
grasshopper.

The larva never gets beyond short little wing pads. See John's eyes
twinkling! I believe--yes, he has! He has brought us the cast-off skin
of a cicada to look at.

   

Why, John, you are like a good fairy to us to-day, giving us just the
things we want just when we want them.

Now, see this little shell. See the front legs, like strong paws to dig
with. And see its little glassy eyes, and its little wing pads!

It is a perfect cast of the cicada larva.

Yes, May, this little cast is made of chitin, and it will last a long
time. Chitin is a very indestructible substance; even fire will not
destroy it, but in course of time the moisture and the acids in the
earth destroy it, so that at last the millions of cicada shells and
grasshopper cast-off skins, which are also of chitin, and cricket
moults, and all the other little cast-aside chitinous overcoats of the
insects, return again to the earth and the air whence they came. The
minerals and gases that compose them let go of each other, as it were,
and the chitin is no longer chitin.

Amy says she has seen these little cicada shells hundreds of times but
did not know what they were.

Yes, we are sure to find them almost every summer.

If we look, we will also find other larvæ shells. Down in the grass are
the cast-off coats of the grasshoppers and the crickets.

All we need do is to look, and we shall be sure to find them--like
unsubstantial ghosts of the active little wearers.

No doubt you all have heard of the seventeen-year locusts. They, too,
are cicadas, and they look very much like this one, only it takes the
young ones seventeen years to complete their growth.

Think of living in the ground and sucking the juices out of the earth
and of tree roots for seventeen years!

   

How would you like to do it?

But no doubt the cicada is quite happy living in this way.

At the end of seventeen years the cicadas come up out of the earth in
great swarms.

They cast their skins for the last time. The queer little shells are
seen everywhere, and the air resounds with the songs of the freed
prisoners.

In the South it takes only thirteen years for these cicadas to develop.

   

I once went up the side of a beautiful mountain in North Carolina, where
was such a mighty host of cicadas in the trees that I could not hear my
companion speak, and a little way off the noise sounded like a torrent
of rushing water.




Why, little Nell! What is the matter?

You do wish the frogs would stop spitting on the grass?

Let me see; why, poor child, she is all covered with frog spittle.

That is kind, Ned. See, he is wiping her apron off with some fresh,
clean leaves. Let us rest awhile under this shady tree.

John, pick that grass blade with the frog spittle on it. Be careful not
to disturb it.

   

There is a surprise in store for you; this white frothy substance that
is so abundant in some places in the summer and that looks like spittle
is--guess what?

Frog spittle, May says. So you think the frogs spit on the grass do you?
They must be tall frogs to reach up so high.

With this little twig let us carefully brush away the white froth.

Now see.

Yes, there is something in the centre of it.

It is the larva of a--bug!

   

The female bug, and here is one of the little things, lays the egg on
the leaf or twigs, and when it hatches the young bug sucks out the sap
of the plant which finally appears as this white froth.

The larva remains surrounded by the froth until its transformations are
complete.

Just before the last moult it stops sucking out sap. The froth dries
about it in the form of a little room, and in this it undergoes its last
moult and comes out--an adult bug.

The froth is supposed to be used as a protection, and it may be against
some enemies, but there are certain wasps that delight in invading the
frothy masses and hauling out the unwilling morsels within to feed to
their young.

No, little Nell, the frogs have nothing whatever to do with this frothy
substance which was called frog spittle before people understood about
the little insect that made it.

They really thought the frogs did it.

The adult spittle insect is called a frog hopper, and it has the power
of leaping very well.

   



Just see this bush! Be careful not to shake it.

It is covered with such pretty, bright-colored little insects.

   

There, May ran against the bush and see--they are hopping wildly off in
every direction.

Yes, little Nell, they do sound like rain drops pattering on the leaves.

They are prettier than the spittle insects and more slender, but they
hop about in very much the same way.

The larvæ do not make froth, however.

These are the leaf hoppers.

What big heads they have!

And how daintily their green forms are pencilled with red lines.

There are a great many species of the leaf hoppers, and not all of them
are as pretty as these.

   

Some of them are very small indeed, and some do great damage to the
grain crops and the fruits.

They suck out the juices of the plants.

If you sweep the insect net over bushes or through the grass in
midsummer, you will be pretty sure to draw in a good collection of leaf
hoppers.

Most of us are only too well acquainted with the rose-leaf hopper that
swarms on rose bushes and kills the leaves. If we have not noticed the
insect itself, we have not failed to notice the little white skins that
it has cast off and left clinging to the leaves.

Yes, these are the little skins it discards when it moults.

John says we can kill them by washing the bushes with strong soap suds.

   

Ned says it is better yet to spray them.

It is better and also easier to spray them than to wash them.

You know there are machines for spraying trees and other plants. They
consist of a tank to hold the liquid that is to be sprayed and a pump to
force it through a rubber pipe with a sprinkler at the end.

Very often a mixture of soap and kerosene oil, known as "kerosene
emulsion," is used to spray with.

Paris green and blue vitriol, both very poisonous, are often used on
grape vines before the grapes are formed, and very gaudy vines they are
for a little while after this bright poison has been sprayed upon them.

Although insects are so very interesting, we have to protect ourselves
against many species in order to live.

Yes, John, it is oftentimes merely a question which shall profit by the
crops we plant, the insects or ourselves.

Sometimes the insects win, sometimes we win, but it is a closely
contested warfare all the time.

We plough the land and take care of it, we plant the seeds and keep out
the weeds. Then, when we have a fine crop growing, along come certain
destructive insects, feeling very happy, no doubt, to have found such a
feast.

Now the fight begins. They attack the crop, we attack them. We spray
them with poisons, burn up their eggs, do everything we know how to get
rid of them.

Wise men have spent many years of close study finding out the habits of
the insects destructive to grains and fruits, in order to be able to
destroy them.

Although many of the plant hoppers are such nuisances to us, there is
one family of hoppers that is seldom a nuisance.




Do you know the tree hoppers,--absurd little jokers that they are?

Oh, yes, they are hard and three cornered, like animated beechnuts, as
somebody has said.

Yes, some of them have humps on their backs and some have horns.

   

John says he once made a collection of tree hoppers and put them in a
box with a reading glass over the top, and showed them to his friends to
make them laugh.

May says she saw them, and they reminded her of Brownies.

Would it not be fun to have a tree hopper Brownie book!

The tree hoppers jump about on the bushes and eat the juices of the
plants, but there are not usually enough of them to do damage. They
seldom come in swarms like some of the leaf hoppers, though sometimes
they do.




THE JUMPING PLANT LICE


The jumping plant lice are nearly related to the tree hoppers, but they
do not look at all like them.

Under the magnifying glass they look like tiny cicadas.

See, here is a picture of one enlarged.

   

Their natural size is no larger than a plant louse.

Have you not often seen them clustered close together on the young twigs
of pear trees--tiny, light-colored things that jumped in all directions
when you touched the twig?

The name of the plant louse that infests pear trees is the pear-tree
psylla. It is very destructive to pear trees, sucking out the juices of
the young shoots.

The pear trees can be saved by spraying them with kerosene emulsion as
soon as the young leaves have opened in the spring.





Now, let us go in search of the aphids, or aphides, as they are also
called. We shall not have to search far.

   

In a very dry season we generally need not search at all. All we need do
is to examine the nearest weed to find plenty of aphides.

Yes, they are the little plant lice that seem at times to cover every
growing thing.

Sometimes they are green, sometimes brown, or gray, or reddish, in
color.

They are tiny creatures, but what they lack in size they more than make
up in numbers.

Go now, and find some aphides.

Ah, here you all come, each bearing a leaf or a twig on which are
aphids.

There was no trouble in finding them!

They do not hop like the jumping plant lice when they are disturbed.
They remain where they are unless they are very much shaken up.

See, most of them are without wings, though here are a few with
beautiful transparent wings.

Antennæ they have, long and threadlike. And see, the knowing little
eyes!

They seem to be anchored to the leaf.

Hold the leaf up to the light, and see if you can discover what they are
doing.

Ah, see those mouth tubes firmly stuck into the leaf. There they stand
all day long and suck out the juice.

   

Ned says he should think they would burst.

But they do not; they grow. And they also get rid of a large part of the
superfluous sap in a curious way.

They use what they need to grow on, and the rest escapes from the
insect's body in the form of "honey dew." It is a sweet liquid of which
ants and bees are very fond.

What, John, you have heard that the aphids give out honey dew from two
little horns near the tip of the abdomen?

Let us see if we can find these horns. Yes, we can see them plainly, and
_very_ plainly with a magnifying glass.

But now listen; the honey dew does not come from the horns. On the end
of some of the horns, or tubes, we can see a drop of clear liquid.

For a long time people believed this was honey dew, but instead, it is a
waxy substance which is not sweet.

It has been very carefully studied by wise men who tell us it contains
no sugar and is probably used as a means of defence, as aphides have
been seen to smear the faces of insect enemies with this wax.

There are a great many species of aphides, and not all of them have the
little tubes or horns on their backs. But probably many that have no
horns give forth honey dew.

It is really a waste substance from the body of the aphid.

Ants are so fond of the honey dew that certain species of aphides have
been called the _ants' cows_, because the ants take care of them for the
sake of the honey dew.

Some ants protect the aphids from their enemies. They drive off those
insects that would devour the aphids, and when winter comes these ants
carry the aphids down into their warm nests under ground, and keep them
safe through the cold weather.

The aphides cannot stand wet weather, but after a long spell of dry
weather they will be found in great abundance.

   

Sometimes they eat so fast and so much that the honey dew falls like a
shower from the trees upon which they are. It covers the ground beneath
and the leaves of plants, and makes everything very sticky and
disagreeable to the touch. The dust settles on it, too and a growth
something like mould often turns it black--as we find to our discomfort.

But when the honey dew is fresh the bees love it. They collect large
quantities of it and make it into honey. Squirrels like it to.

It is great fun to watch the nimble squirrel folk sitting in the trees
and holding a leaf between their little hands while they lick off the
honey dew.

Children sometimes suck the honey dew from the leaves in back country
places, where sugar is scarce and where candy is seldom to be had.

Which side of the leaf does the aphid prefer?

Yes, it is on the under side always.

I wonder why.

John says the aphides would be better protected in case of a shower.

Ned says the skin is tenderer on the under side and easier to pierce.

Mollie thinks they want to be in the shade out of the hot sunshine.

I should not wonder if all of these reasons were right.

My little aphid, how many wings have you when you have any?

Yes, little Nell, they have four of the daintiest, prettiest little
wings you ever saw.

   

True enough, most of them have no wings at all.

   

John thinks those must be young ones.

Sometimes they are, but not always. Many of the adult aphids have no
wings.

The aphids are very curious insects, and when you are older I hope you
will remember to study them carefully.

No, John, not all species of aphides make honey dew.

Some form instead a white, powdery substance that is seen scattered over
the body.

May says that must be the kind she has.

Let us see. Yes, May's aphids produce the white powder instead of honey
dew.

That is _their_ way of getting rid of the waste matter.

May says she is glad to know that; she thought her aphids had something
the matter with them. They seemed to be falling to pieces.

No, May, they are not falling to pieces; that powder can all be rubbed
off, and there are your aphids whole and sound beneath it.

Do you know that some species of your funny little tree hoppers secrete
honey dew also, and even have ants to attend them? See if you can find
some of these this summer.

Sometimes aphids live on the roots of plants as well as on the leaves.

Yes, indeed, May, they are very destructive insects. We have to spray
our house plants to get rid of them, and often our garden flowers as
well, and they do a great deal of damage to fruits and vegetables, and
one of them, the phylloxera, has nearly destroyed the vineyards of
France. It lives on the leaves of some species of grapes and on the
roots of others. We have to be very careful about getting grape vines
from Europe to plant in this country on account of the phylloxera.

   

What have you found now, John? Ah, yes, an alder branch, with a white,
cottony substance on it. You have been poking into it with a little
stick, and you think there are insects beneath it.

What, May, you always thought that white stuff was a plant growth, like
mould?

We can easily find out. Get out some of the little things inside if you
can, John. It is not easy to separate them from their cottony covering
without crushing them, but now we can see quite well with the magnifying
glass--and yes--you see they are little insects.

We call them the woolly aphids.

They also secrete honey dew.

You say the ground below the alder bush was all sticky and black, John?

That was the honey dew, blackened by a little plant something like
mould, that grows on it.

We often see woolly plant lice in the summer-time on different plants,
and one species injures apple trees. It gets on the roots as well as on
the tender bark of young trees and kills them.

Yes, indeed, Mollie, the aphids are bugs. They belong to the bug order,
which is a very large and important insect family, and contains some
members that are exceedingly troublesome to us.




What, May, you are tired out?

What have you been doing?

Oh, yes, washing the scales off the leaves of your mother's window fern.

   

It must indeed have been a task; what did you wash them off with? Why
did you use soap suds?

Because your mother told you to; well, that is a good reason, but why do
you think she told you to use soap suds?

You say you don't know, but you think very likely these scales are some
sort of bug, as everything nowadays seems to be bugs.

Well, I don't know about everything being bugs, but those scales
certainly are. They are scale bugs.

Did you stop to look at them under the magnifying glass?

   

No, but you brought a piece of the fern for us to look at.

It will be necessary to put it under the microscope.

There, now look.

Yes, that scale looks like a tiny mussel shell; but look carefully, and
you will see it has legs.

Lift it up with the point of a pin, and under it you will find a mass of
eggs. Yes, Ned; it is like a quantity of eggs under a dish cover.

The cover is the female scale bug, and she has laid all those eggs.

Yes, the scales we see on so many plants are the scale bugs.

They are not all alike in shape, or size, or color; here is a different
kind, you see.

   

But they are all very prolific; that is to say, they produce a great
many young, and do it in a short time.

Yes, John, the tiny, dark-colored scales that look like little oyster
shells on the skins of oranges are a form of scale bug, and a very
troublesome one, too, to the orange grower.

But though most of these insects are troublesome, the family is redeemed
by a few members that are of great value to us.

One of these is the scale bug that supplies shellac, and all that comes
from it to our markets. These curious bugs give forth a resinous
substance that envelops the eggs and glues them to the twigs whose
juices the bug sucks out. It is this resinous substance that is
collected by breaking off the twigs where the insects are. It is used
for varnishes, as you know, and for polishing wood and other substances.

There are other scale bugs that secrete wax, and some of them produce it
so abundantly, and of such good quality, that it has become an article
of commerce. China wax, which is wax of a very fine quality, is secreted
by a Chinese scale bug, and the wax is used for making fine candles, as
well as for other purposes.

In Mexico we have the cochineal insect, which is a scale bug that lives
on a cactus that grows in Mexico.

Like many others of the scale bugs, the cochineal males have wings and
are not so scalelike as their helpless mates.

But they are of no use to us. It is only the female cochineal we use.

She is raised in great numbers in cactus gardens planted on purpose.

Here is the picture of a cactus with cochineal insects upon it.

   

These insects contain a very brilliant, red coloring matter that is used
by us in dyeing leather and wool, and in making paints. The insects are
gathered and dried, and thus sent to market.

Although a few of them are useful to us, the scale bugs, on the whole,
are a serious pest; and they are found on nearly all kinds of plants all
over the world.

You should think all the plants would soon be gone, so many insects eat
them?

Well, they would, only other things eat the insects.

Insects have a great many enemies, after all.

Sometimes the weather is bad for them, the season is too hot or too
cold, too wet or too dry, and then they do not appear in large numbers.

Sometimes one kind of insect eats another kind.

Sometimes tiny plants, like moulds, grow on the insects and kill them;
and birds destroy a very large number.

If the farmers only knew how much good the birds do them, they would
never allow one to be killed. Even the crows that pull up their corn are
worth many times the corn they eat in the insects they destroy. There is
scarcely a bird but what is of value to the farmer.

The hawks that catch his chickens catch more mice and moles in his
fields, than chickens in his barn-yard.

And as for the robins, the blue jays, and all the small birds, they do
more to save the growing plants, than all the soap suds and kerosene
emulsion that were ever made.

No one should ever shoot a bird. The birds are our natural protectors
against the vast armies of insects, that, but for the birds, would soon
destroy us by eating up our food plants.

What is that, May? You belong to an Audubon Society for the protection
of the birds?

Yes, I know you do, and so do John and Ned and Mollie and little Nell.

I wish every child in the United States belonged to the Audubon Society.
Then our birds would be safe. They would never be killed as they are now
for foolish women to wear on their hats.

When the Audubon Society children grew up they would not wear dead
birds, of course, and their children would be taught better, so that
after a while the Audubon Society people would be the only ones left,
and so the birds would be safe.

Let us get as many people to belong to the Audubon Society as we can.

What is that, Amy? You have learned more interesting things about birds
in the Audubon Society than you ever knew in your life before?

Yes, I am sure you have, and what could be lovelier to study about than
the birds.

What is that you are saying, Ned? You love to go bird hunting? Ah, I see
your eyes twinkle, sir; I know how you go hunting. You hunt with your
mother's opera glass! That is the proper way to hunt birds.

We can learn more from watching one bird with a glass than we could from
shooting a hundred.

But you do shoot them, John? Yes, I know about that, too. I know what
kind of a shooting instrument you got for Christmas, sir, and I have
seen the birds you shot!

Yes, nearly all of us have seen them, and how well he does it!

What, Amy, you think John ought to be ashamed of himself to go about
shooting birds, and we ought to be ashamed of ourselves to talk so about
it?

There, now, don't be vexed with Amy, children. She has known us but a
little while, and she has not seen John's birds, so I do not wonder she
feels indignant.

What is that, May? You have one of John's birds right here in your
school-bag? Show it to Amy.

Isn't it pretty! It is a very charming photograph of a catbird on its
nest.

You see John shoots birds with a camera! His father gave him a beautiful
one for Christmas, and he has made good use of it.

How long did it take you to get that bird, John?

Just hear! He spent more than a week getting acquainted with the bird so
it would sit still on the nest while he took its picture.

I am sure that was a week well spent.

John says he feels better acquainted with the catbird than he would have
been if he had read fifty books about it.

And I am sure he is right. The only way to enjoy a bird and to know it,
is to watch it alive.

A camera is the very best gun in the world for catching birds. And it is
really much better fun to take their pictures than to shoot and kill
them.

It seems to me we have strayed a long way from bugs.

May says she thinks birds are much more interesting than bugs.

That may be, but still we want to know about bugs, too.

Do you think you will know a bug when you see it now?

No, I do not believe you can be sure of that. But at least you know
something about a few bugs.

Some day you will study more carefully how insects are formed, and then
you will understand better how we decide what order they belong to.

We group together the insects that are most like each other.

   



No more bugs, if you please.

We are to make the acquaintance of another order of insect folk this
time.

   

I think we can find some worthy members of this new order if we go with
John to a brook he knows of.

Here we are, and it certainly is a lovely brook, whether we find a
dobson in it or not.

Yes, Nell, the dobson is the new insect we shall try to find.

Now, be careful and not get your clothes too wet, but we have to turn
over the stones along the edge of the brook until we find what we are
after.

Mollie wants to know how she is to know it if she finds it.

Well, Mollie, whatever you find that is interesting you must show us.
Even though it is not what we are searching for, we shall enjoy seeing
it.

Look at little Nell! She has tumbled into the brook. Her foot slipped,
and down she went.

Don't cry, deary, you are not wet enough to do any harm. The warm sun
will soon dry you.

No, indeed, you will not have to go home.

   

Perhaps you will be the first one to find a dobson after all.

Hurrah! hurrah! hear John shout!

He must have found the first dobson.

Yes, he has.

What, May? It is a horrid monster, and you have a good mind to scream?

Well, scream if you want to; that won't do any harm.

It _isn't_ pretty! but we shall like to look at it. You see it is a
larva and a big one, dark gray in color and with a thick leathery skin.

Mollie says it reminds her a little of the larva of the May fly; that
is, in shape.

Let us look at a picture of the May-fly larva.

You see it has a head, a thorax to which is attached the six legs and
the rudimentary wings, and an abdomen, all distinctly separated from
each other.

   

The dobson has a head, but no thorax.

The body behind the head is divided into segments that all look very
much alike, and there is a pair of legs attached to each of the first
three segments.

The dobson eats other larvæ that it chews up with its strong jaws.

It lives almost three years in the larval state, so you see it has
plenty of time in which to grow. Of course it moults. It is usually to
be found under stones in swift, running water. Those two pairs of hooks
at the tip of its body are its anchors.

It clasps them about a bit of stone or a stick that is firmly lodged,
and then it can bid defiance to the swirling stream.

Ned wonders why it is always found hiding under stones.

Listen to John, he says fishes are very fond of dobsons, and that is why
they hide away.

Fishermen hunt the dobsons for bait; so you see they have a hard time in
spite of their large size and their strong jaws.

When they have lived nearly three years in the water they crawl out on
the bank and hollow out a place under a stone.

Here they lie, apparently dead, but they are not dead.

They are undergoing a wonderful transformation.

It takes about a month for this transformation, or _metamorphosis_, as
it is called, to be completed.

All of our other insect friends have changed gradually from larval to
adult form. At each moult they became a little more like their parents,
and finally at the last moult, without any resting period, out sprang
the perfect insect.

Not so the dobson. It goes into its hole in the bank a larva, almost
exactly like the larva that hatched from the egg, only, of course, it is
larger. There is no hint of wings. It has no separate thorax and
abdomen. Could we see under the bank where it has crept, to undergo its
great metamorphosis, we should find, not a larva, but a strange-looking,
motionless object.

   

Here is the picture of one. See its little wing pads. And now it has a
thorax and an abdomen.

It seems to have changed and been turned to some hard substance.

In this state it is called the _pupa_, which means doll. Is it not a
cunning insect doll? But it is not really a doll. Although so still and
apparently lifeless, yet it lives.

Some day it will burst its pupa shell and pull itself out--not a larva
now, not a pupa, but a strong-winged insect.

In its adult form, it is known as the horned corydalus.

There! I thought John was saving one for us. He had it in a box in his
pocket. Now see what a--a--what shall I say? A beauty? or a monster?
That is just as you feel about it.

It certainly is an alarming-looking insect.

This one is a male, as we can tell by the long, curved jaws that look
very dangerous; but in this instance the creature's appearance is worse
than its bite, and the real biter is the female whose jaws are smaller
but very useful in nipping tormentors or biting prey.

Now here she is--a fit mate for her formidable-looking companion.


John, you were fortunate in your hunting.

In spite of its terrifying appearance, see what wonderful wings the
corydalus has.

See! John has spread out the wings of the female.

They are indeed beautiful.

May cannot understand how those great wings came out of those little
wing pads.

When the wings were first pulled out of the wing pads they were small,
but they rapidly expanded and became thin and broad and long as the air
touched them.

You will understand that better after a while.

The corydalus differs from all the other insects we have studied, in its
metamorphosis.

It begins life far more unlike its parents than the other insects we
have been looking at, for they had the thorax and abdomen distinct from
the beginning. Instead of changing gradually and remaining active all
the time up to the final metamorphosis, our corydalus goes into the pupa
state, and in that motionless condition transforms to the perfect
insect.

This is called a complete metamorphosis.

When the change is gradual, without any pupa form, any stopping place as
it were, the change is said to be an incomplete metamorphosis.

Yes, the metamorphosis of the grasshoppers is incomplete, and of the
katydids and the crickets and all the other insects we have studied
until we came to the dobson.

Another name for the larva of insects that undergo an incomplete
metamorphosis is _nymph_. Some books speak of the nymph of the
grasshopper, and never of the larva of the grasshopper. Such books use
the word _larva_ only in speaking of the young of insects that undergo a
complete metamorphosis.

Yes, Ned, they would speak of the nymph of the dragon fly, and the nymph
of the May fly and the nymph of the cricket and the katydid, but they
would speak of the larva of the corydalus.

Egg, nymph, adult,--those are the stages of insects that have an
incomplete metamorphosis.

Egg, larva, pupa, adult,--those are the stages of insects that have a
complete metamorphosis.

No, it is not wrong to say larva instead of nymph. I only want you to
know how the word nymph is used, so that when you see it in reading
about insects you will know what it means.

The corydalus lays its eggs near the water, and it lays a great
many--sometimes nearly three thousand. Think of that! The young larvæ
crawl into the water as soon as they are hatched, and those that escape
the hungry fishes grow into these large larvæ and finally metamorphose
into the big-horned corydalus.

It is such a remarkably fierce-looking creature that it has received
many names that are neither complimentary nor beautiful, such as
conniption bug, alligator, and dragon, and numerous others equally
expressive.

Now, we must go home. Let us put the dobson back into the brook.

It does no harm, and we will not kill it.

Yes, Ned, there are smaller insects like the corydalus that are near
relatives to it, and I am sure you have often seen them.



Here is our little Lacewing.

   

May says it is a darling, like a woodland fairy clad all in green.

And, oh, its eyes! Are they not beautiful? They shine like gold.

Do its wings not remind you a little of the wings of the corydalus?

May says no, indeed; that has ugly brown wings.

But look again, May. See how these wings are veined, and do you not
remember how you admired the silvery wings of the corydalus when we
spread them out?

Yes, it belongs to the same order as the corydalus.

The name of the insect order to which they both belong is Neuroptera,
from _neuron_, a nerve, and _pteron_--who remembers what _pteron_ means?

Yes, a wing. Nerve-winged.

What does that mean?

It means that the wings are crossed by many nerves or veins. Yes, that
is what gives them their lacelike appearance.

Pretty golden eye, why do we not oftener see you on the trees and
bushes? It is only by accident we found you to-day, down in the grass.

The truth is, this pretty fairy hides by day and comes out at night to
lay its eggs. Like the May fly, the adult lacewing does not eat. It is a
helpless little beauty, though it has one powerful means of defence, as
you will discover if you touch it.

Ah, yes; you have already detected it! It gives forth such an offensive
odor that nothing, one should think, could have the hardihood to eat it.

May says she supposes the larva of the lacewing is a little monster like
that of the corydalus.

But you will not expect to find it as large as a dobson.

I think if we hunt about a little, we can find one.

Here is one on the leaf. See what a little fellow! And how fast it runs!

   

We shall have to take it captive, in order to get a chance to see it.

It is a funny little larva, with jaws that are _tre-men-dous_ for one of
its size.

Why do you suppose it has such jaws?

May says, for the usual reason, to eat up other larvæ.

Yes; but wait till I tell you another name for this larva.

It is also called the aphis lion.

Aphis, you know, is the same as aphid, or plant louse. In other words it
is the plant-louse lion.

Ah, yes; you are quite willing it should devour the aphids.

And it does. It is very fond of them, though it will also devour any
unlucky insect it is strong enough to overcome.

It has a terrible appetite, this child of the pretty lacewing.

It would even eat its brothers and sisters before they hatched out of
the egg if it could get at them.

The pretty lacewing knows what an appetite her ever hungry larvæ will
have, and so she protects them against each other.

Clever little mother! she lays the eggs in such a way that the larvæ
that hatch out first cannot devour the rest of the eggs.

How do you think she manages it?

Here are some of her eggs on this leaf.

Yes, John; each one is on top of a slender stalk.

The stalk is of stiff silk.

There they are, like a little forest, with an egg for each tree top.

   

When an egg hatches the young aphis lion drops down to the leaf and runs
about like a ravening lion seeking some living thing to devour.

Above his head, quite unsuspected by him, are the eggs out of which his
brothers and sisters have not yet hatched.

What a feast he could have if he knew about it!

And what a sad little cannibal he would be!

The larva of the aphis lion has no distinct thorax. Its legs are
attached to the upper segments of the body, and its metamorphosis is
like that of the corydalus.

When about to become a pupa, it makes for itself a little covering of
white silk. Here it lies quite motionless and undergoes the final
transformation.

Yes, its metamorphosis is complete.

It bites an opening through its silken walls, and out steps--not the
hungry, little, all-devouring aphis lion, but this elegant lady with her
pale-green lacelike wings and her large, golden eyes.

You see the aphis lion is our very good friend.

It helps us get rid of the aphids, and we should never kill a lacewing
or a child of the lacewing.




John has found something he wants us all to see.

We will go with him.

Now we will sit down on this sand bank and look at what he has to show
us. See! those smooth little funnels in the sand.

   

Those are what we have come out to see.

Let us watch them a while.

Mollie says an ant is walking close to the rim of the funnel she is
watching. Now the ant slips over the edge and slides down the smooth
sides of the funnel.

And see! from the bottom of the funnel leap out two curved jaws
and--good-by, ant!

The ant has been dragged down out of sight through a hole in the bottom
of the funnel.

What a strange proceeding!

Who can be living down there at the bottom of the funnel?

We are sorry to disturb such a pretty piece of work, but we shall have
to dig out one of the funnels. We shall have to be quick, too.

There, there, under the trowel! No, it is gone. There it is again. Dig
fast, Ned. That is right. He has put it with a trowelful of sand into
our box.

We will gently shake out the sand until we uncover it.

Mabel says it is just what she thought it was--a larva.

Yes, it is a larva.

   

You see it looks a little like the lacewing larva, and it, too, belongs
to the Neuroptera.

What jaws!

How do you suppose it makes its tunnel?

If we give it plenty of sand, and keep very quiet, perhaps it will go to
work.

There! it is throwing the sand about.

May says it is using its own head as a trowel. Yes, it is shovelling the
sand away with its head.

Why is Ned laughing? Oh, see the ant lion he is watching! An ant slid
part way down its funnel and tried to climb out again, and the ant lion
down below is flinging sand at it.

There! it has succeeded in making the poor ant slip; down it goes, and
now the ant lion has seized it and dragged it down under the ground.

It is easy to find these pit-falls of the ant lion in sand banks in the
summer-time.

Yes, May, the ant lions eat many ants, and they moult and grow, and,
finally, they, too, make a little cocoon about themselves.

Yes, the little silken room they weave we call a cocoon, but the ant
lions make theirs of silk and sand.

   

Within the cocoon they become motionless pupæ, and finally appear as
silver-winged little creatures that bear no resemblance to the
large-jawed, ever hungry, ant lion.

May says she thinks the Neuroptera differ from all the other orders in
the way the larvæ transform.

That is true, May, they do.

In no other order that we have studied do the insects go into the pupal
state to undergo the final transformation.

Who remembers what the young of insects that undergo an incomplete
metamorphosis are sometimes called?

Dear me, you all remember!

Yes, the young are sometimes called nymphs.

The nymphs do not change into pupæ.

The young grasshoppers do not change into motionless pupæ, they just
keep on growing until they are perfect adults.

Young grasshoppers are sometimes called nymphs instead of larvæ.

   



Here we are in the woods again.

How sweet it smells!

Let us sit down by this brook and look into it.

It is such a clear little stream, with fine sand and little pebbles at
the bottom.

What has Nell found that pleases her so?

She says she sees some little bars of sand moving about.

Ned says they are not sand bars but tubes of sand, containing a little
live thing.

The truth is, this sand bag is a house, and its occupant is a larva.

   

See the black head come popping out, and the tiny fore legs.

The larva does not come entirely out, you see, but pulls its house along
with it, and when it is frightened it pops back into its little stone
case.

Mollie says it reminds her of a hermit crab.

A hermit crab, you know, lives on the seashore and takes possession of
an empty snail shell for a house.

It comes partly out dragging its house with it, but if you disturb it,
it draws back, sometimes quite out of sight.

   

This little larva lives in a house, too, but it is a house of its own
making.

It is the larva of the caddice fly, or case fly.

Let us put one of these little sand cases in the saucer here.

Please fill the saucer about half full of water, John. Thank you.

Now, Mollie, I see you have picked up a fine big caddice case.

Put it in the saucer, and let us watch the larva crawl about.

   

It never comes entirely out of the case, you see. It holds on to it with
the hinder part of its body.

Its little black head is hard, but its body is soft, and that is why it
does not like to expose itself to hungry larvæ that might be living in
the water.

May says she wants to see the whole larva.

Suppose we carefully break away the little sand case.

No, indeed, little Nell, we are not going to hurt the larva; we are only
going to open its house.

   

There, the larva is outside now, and you can see what a tender, pale
little thing it is.

It does not like to have its soft body exposed.

See! it is already gathering little bits of sand together.

It seems to be sticking them fast to its body.

It is really binding them together by a saliva-like substance from its
mouth.

It draws out little glistening threads that harden into silk as soon as
they touch the water.

Queer saliva you think.

But the caddice larva does not find it queer. It is used to saliva that
hardens into silk.

Yes, that is the way the larva of the aphis lion and of the ant lion
made their cocoons. They spun out silk in this manner.

The caddice larva makes its house of silk and sand and also lines it
with a beautiful covering of fine silk.

Yes, May, it papers its walls with silk.

You see it did not hurt the caddice larva to take away its house; it
immediately went to work to build another.

Why not pull it out, instead of breaking its house to pieces?

Because if it had been pulled hard enough to come out, it might have
been torn to pieces, it is such a tender little thing, and it holds fast
so tightly.

So the best way to remove it safely is to break its case bit by bit from
around it.

It does no harm to break its case if one is careful. It will soon build
another.

Yes, this larva has no distinct thorax. It is like the larvæ of the
dobson, the aphis lion, and the ant lion in that respect.

   

See! John has found one whose tube is made of quite large stones as
compared with this tube of fine sand that we have broken open.

Some caddice larvæ build houses of wood instead of stone. They stick
little twigs together, and some use little pieces of leaves.

Others again use tiny snail shells which, as you can imagine, make very
pretty cases.

   

Our little caddice has made a neat little house of fine sand grains very
nicely put together.

Some others make much rougher houses.

You will be apt to find the caddice larvæ in any brook and in some
ponds, and I hope you will always look for them.

Notice the tracery in the soft mud of the brook.

Those lines that look as though some one had been ornamenting the bottom
of the brook are made by our caddice larvæ.

   

They drag their cases along and thus make these lines.

Sometimes such lines are made by the little fresh-water snails; but you
can always find the decorator by following along the lines he makes.

What, May? How is the delicate larva able to cling to the case tightly
enough to pull it along? If you look at it very carefully, you will find
a pair of tiny hooks at the tail end by which it can hold on to the silk
lining; and some caddice larvæ have hard points on their backs which
help them to hold fast.

The caddice larvæ are carnivorous; that is, they eat animal food.

Yes, May, their food is usually the larvæ of other insects, but you will
be glad to know that some of them eat plants too.

They eat the larvæ of the May flies when they can find them and no doubt
they build these strong cases about themselves to prevent the May fly
larvæ from returning the compliment.

Frank has found some empty cases, yes, and some that are closed at both
ends.

Now, let us look at this one closed at both ends. What do you suppose is
in it?

We will open just one of these closed cases.

There! It is a pupa! Yes, Nell, a very pretty doll is this.

   

It has a thorax, you see, and an abdomen. Its long antennæ lie close to
its body as do its little wing pads.

Yes, the caddice larva grows and moults in the usual way. It keeps
adding to its house as it grows longer. Finally, it closes the end of
its little tube and lies quite still.

You know what happens next. Its wormlike form divides into thorax and
abdomen. Legs and wings appear, attached to the thorax. In short, it is
no longer a wormlike creature.

Finally, it comes forth from its case. It never goes into it again.

   

It does not need to, for now it is a dainty little nun, with a long,
tan-colored cloak. Its cloak, of course, is its wings folded down about
its body. Like the fairy May flies it has no mouth and eats nothing in
the adult form.

It looks like a dainty brown moth as it flutters about the bushes and
goes flying up and down the brook.

You will always find these little brown-cloaked figures flitting about
the brooks, where the caddice larvæ live.

You see the caddice undergoes a complete metamorphosis.

No, it does not belong to the Neuroptera.

Examine its wings very carefully. Look at them through the magnifying
glass, and you will see they are clothed with hairs.

So these are the hair wings.

The name of the order to which they belong is Trichoptera, from
_pteron_, a wing, and _thrix_, a hair.

Sometime you must take a caddice larva from its house and put it in a
saucer of water with fine bits of mica, which you know is another name
for the isinglass that makes the little windows in our stoves.

If you are fortunate, your caddice will build for itself a little glass
house, through whose walls you can look and see what is going on inside.

The Unique Adventures of the WOGGLE-BUG

ONE day Mr. H. M. Woggle-Bug, T. E., becoming separated from his
comrades who had accompanied him from the Land of Oz, and finding that
time hung heavy on his hands (he had four of them), decided to walk
down the Main street of the City and try to discover something or other
of interest.

The initials "H. M." before his name meant "Highly Magnified," for this
Woggle-Bug was several thousand times bigger than any other woggle-bug
you ever saw. And the initials "T. E." after his named meant "Thoroughly
Educated"--and so he was, in the Land of Oz. But his education, being
applied to a woggle-bug intellect, was not at all remarkable in this
country, where everything is quite different than Oz. Yet the
Woggle-Bug did not suspect this, and being, like so many other thoroughly
educated persons, proud of his mental attainments, he marched along the
street with an air of importance that made one wonder what great
thoughts were occupying his massive brain.

Being about as big, in his magnified state, as a man, the Woggle-Bug
took care to clothe himself like a man; only, instead of choosing sober
colors for his garments, he delighted in the most gorgeous reds and
yellows and blues and greens; so that if you looked at him long the
brilliance of his clothing was liable to dazzle your eyes.

I suppose the Waggle-Bug did not realize at all what a queer appearance
he made. Being rather nervous, he seldom looked into a mirror; and as
the people he met avoided telling him he was unusual, he had fallen
into the habit of considering himself merely an ordinary citizen of the
big city wherein he resided.

So the Woggle-Bug strutted proudly along the street, swinging a cane in
one hand, flourishing a pink handkerchief in the other, fumbling his
watch-fob with another, and feeling his necktie was straight with
another. Having four hands to use would prove rather puzzling to you or
me, I imagine; but the Woggie-Bug was thoroughly accustomed to them.

Presently he came to a very fine store with big plate-glass windows,
and standing in the center of the biggest window was a creature so
beautiful and radiant and altogether charming that the first glance at
her nearly took his breath away. Her complexion was lovely, for it was
wax; but the thing which really caught the Woggle-Bug's fancy was the
marvelous dress she wore. Indeed, it was the latest (last year's) Paris
model, although the Woggle-Bug did not know that; and the designer must
have had a real woggly love for bright colors, for the gown was made of
red cloth covered with big checks which were so loud the fashion books
called them "Wagnerian Plaids."

Never had our friend the Woggle-Bug seen such a beautiful gown before,
and it afflicted him so strongly that he straightaway fell in love with
the entire outfit--even to the wax-complexioned lady herself! Very
politely he tipped his to her; but she stared coldly back without in
any way acknowledging the courtesy.

"Never mind," he thought; "'faint heart never won fair lady.' And I'm
determined to win this kaliedoscope of beauty or perish in the
attempt!" You will notice that our insect had a way of using big words
to express himself, which leads us to suspect that the school system in
Oz is the same they employ in Boston.

As, with swelling heart, the Woggle-Bug feasted his eyes upon the
enchanting vision, a small green tag that was attached to a button of
the waist suddenly attracted his attention. Upon the tag was marked:
"Price $7.93--GREATLY REDUCED."

"Ah!" murmured the Woggle-Bug; "my darling is in greatly reduced
circumstances, and $7.93 will make her mine! Where, oh where, shall I
find the seven ninety-three wherewith to liberate this divinity and
make her Mrs. Woggle-Bug?"

"Move on!" said a gruff policeman, who came along swinging his club.
And the Woggle-Bug obediently moved on, his brain working fast and
furious in the endeavor to think of a way to procure seven dollars and
ninety-three cents.

You see, in the Land of Oz they use no money at all, so that when the
Woggle-Bug arrived in America he did not possess a single penny. And no
one had presented him with any money since.

"Yet there must be several ways to procure money in this country," he
reflected; "for otherwise everybody would be as penniless as I am. But
how, I wonder, do they manage to get it?"

Just then he came along a side street where a number of men were at
work digging a long and deep ditch in which to lay a new sewer.

"Now these men," thought the Woggle-Bug, "must get money for shoveling
all that earth, else they wouldn't do it. Here is my chance to win the
charming vision of beauty in the shop window!"

Seeking out the foreman, he asked for work, and the foreman agreed to
hire him.

"How much do you pay these workmen?" asked the highly magnified one.

"Two dollars a day," answered the foreman.

"Then," said the Woggle-Bug, "you must pay me four dollars a day; for I
have four arms to their two, and can do double their work."

"If that is so, I'll pay you four dollars," agreed the man.

The Woggle-Bug was delighted.

"In two days," he told himself, as he threw off his brilliant coat and
placed his hat upon it, and rolled up his sleeves; "in two days I can
earn eight dollars--enough to purchase my greatly reduced darling and
buy her seven cents worth of caramels besides."

He seized two spades and began working so rapidly with his four arms
that the foreman said: "You must have been forewarned."

"Why?" asked the Insect.

"Because there's a saying that to be forewarned is to be four-armed,"
replied the other.

"That is nonsense," said the Woggle-Bug, digging with all his might;
"for they call you the foreman, and yet I only see one of you."

"Ha, ha!" laughed the man, and he was so proud of his new worker that
he went into the corner saloon to tell his friend the barkeeper what a
treasure he had found.

It was just after noon that the Woggle-Bug hired as a ditch-digger in
order to win his heart's desire; so at noon on the second day he quit
work, and having received eight silver dollars he put on his coat and
rushed away to the store that he might purchase his intended bride.

But, alas for the uncertainty of all our hopes! Just as the Woggle-Bug
reached the door he saw a lady coming out of the store dressed in
identical checks with which he had fallen in love!

At first he did not know what to do or say, for the young lady's
complexion was not wax--far from it. But a glance into the window
showed him the wax lady now dressed in a plain black tailor-made suit,
and at once he knew the wearer of the Wagnerian plaids was his real
love, and not the stiff creature behind the glass.

"Beg pardon!" he exclaimed, stopping the young lady; "but you're mine.
Here's the seven ninety-three, and seven cents for candy."

But she glanced at him in a haughty manner, and walked away with her
nose slightly elevated.

He followed. He could not do otherwise with those delightful checks
shining before him like beacon-lights to urge him on.

The young lady stepped into a car, which whirled away rapidly. For a
moment he was nearly paralyzed at his loss; then he started after the
car as fast as he could go, and this was very fast indeed--he being a
woggle-bug.

Somebody cried: "Stop, thief!" and a policeman ran out to arrest him.
But the Woggle-Bug used his four hands to push the officer aside, and
the astonished man went rolling into the gutter so recklessly that his
uniform bore marks of the encounter for many days.

Still keeping an eye on the car, the Woggle-Bug rushed on. He
frightened two dogs, upset a fat gentleman who was crossing the street,
leaped over an automobile that shot in front of him, and finally ran
plump into the car, which had abruptly stopped to let off a passenger.
Breathing hard from his exertions, he jumped upon the rear platform of
the car, only to see his charmer step off at the front and walk
mincingly up the steps of a house. Despite his fatigue, he flew after
her at once, crying out:

"Stop, my variegated dear--stop! Don't you know you're mine?"

But she slammed the door in his face, and he sat down upon the steps
and wiped his forehead with his pink handkerchief and fanned himself
with his hat and tried to think what he should do next.

Presently a very angry man came out of the house. He had a revolver in
one hand and a carving-knife in the other.

"What do you mean by insulting my wife?" he demanded.

"Was that your wife?" asked the Woggle-Bug, in meek astonishment.

"Of course it is my wife," answered the man.

"Oh, I didn't know," said the insect, rather humbled. "But I'll give
you seven ninety-three for her. That's all she's worth, you know; for I
saw it marked on the tag."

The man gave a roar of rage and jumped into the air with the intention
of falling on the Woggle-Bug and hurting him with the knife and pistol.
But the Woggle-Bug was suddenly in a hurry, and didn't wait to be
jumped on. Indeed, he ran so very fast that the man was content to let
him go, especially as the pistol wasn't loaded and the carving-knife
was as dull as such knives usually are.

But his wife had conceived a great dislike for the Wagnerian check
costume that had won for her the Woggle-Bug's admiration. "I'll never
wear it again!" she said to her husband, when he came in and told her
that the Woggle-Bug was gone.

"Then," he replied, "you'd better give it to Bridget; for she's been
bothering me about her wages lately, and the present will keep her
quite for a month longer."

So she called Bridget and presented her with the dress, and the
delighted servant decided to wear it that night to Mickey Schwartz's
ball.

Now the poor Woggle-Bug, finding his affection scorned, was feeling
very blue and unhappy that evening, When he walked out, dressed (among
other things) in a purple-striped shirt, with a yellow necktie and
pea-green gloves, he looked a great deal more cheerful than he really
was. He had put on another hat, for the Woggle-Bug had a superstition
that to change his hat was to change his luck, and luck seemed to have
overlooked the fact that he was in existence.

The hat may really have altered his fortunes, as the Insect shortly met
Ikey Swanson, who gave him a ticket to Mickey Schwartz's ball; for
Ikey's clean dickey had not come home from the laundry, and so he could
not go himself.

The Woggle-Bug, thinking to distract his mind from his dreams of love,
attended the hall, and the first thing he saw as he entered the room
was Bridget clothed in that same gorgeous gown of Wagnerian plaid that
had so fascinated his bugly heart.

The dear Bridget had added to her charms by putting seven full-blown
imitation roses and three second-hand ostrich-plumes in her red hair;
so that her entire person glowed like a sunset in June.

The Woggle-bug was enraptured; and, although the divine Bridget was
waltzing with Fritzie Casey, the Insect rushed to her side and, seizing
her with all his four arms at once, cried out in his truly educated
Bostonian way:

"Oh, my superlative conglomeration of beauty! I have found you at
last!"

Bridget uttered a shriek, and Fritzie Casey doubled two fists that
looked like tombstones, and advanced upon the intruder.

Still embracing the plaid costume with two arms, the Woggle-Bug tipped
Mr. Casey over with the other two. But Bridget made a bound and landed
with her broad heel, which supported 180 pounds, firmly upon the
Insect's toes. He gave a yelp of pain and promptly released the lady,
and a moment later he found himself flat upon the floor with a dozen of
the dancers piled upon him--all of whom were pummeling each other with
much pleasure and a firm conviction that the diversion had been planned
for their special amusement.

But the Woggle-Bug had the strength of many men, and when he flopped
the big wings that were concealed by the tails of his coat, the
gentlemen resting upon him were scattered like autumn leaves in a gust
of wind.

The Insect stood up, rearranged his dress, and looked about him.
Bridget had run away and gone home, and the others were still fighting
amongst themselves with exceeding cheerfulness. So the Woggle-Bug
selected a hat which fit him (his own having been crushed out of shape)
and walked sorrowfully back to his lodgings.

"Evidently that was not a lucky hat I wore to the ball," he reflected;
"but perhaps this one I now have will bring about a change in my
fortunes."

Bridget needed money; and as she had worn her brilliant costume once
and allowed her friends to see how becoming it was, she carried it the
next morning to a second-hand dealer and sold it for three dollars in
cash.

Scarcely had she left the shop when a lady of Swedish extraction--a
widow with four small children in her train--entered and asked to look
at a gown. The dealer showed her the one he had just bought from
Bridget, and its gay coloring so pleased the widow that she immediately
purchased it for $3.65.

"Ay tank ets a good deal money, by sure," she said to herself; "but das
leedle children mus' have new fadder to mak mind un tak care dere
mudder like, by yimminy! An' Ay tank no man look may way in das ole
dress I been wearing."

She took the gown and the four children to her home, where she lost no
time in trying on the costume, which fitted her as perfectly as a
flour-sack does a peck of potatoes.

"Das _beau_--tiful!" she exclaimed, in rapture, as she tried to see
herself in a cracked mirror. "Ay go das very afternoon to valk in da
park, for das man-folks go crazy-like ven he sees may fine frocks!"

Then she took her green parasol and a hand-bag stuffed with papers (to
make it look prosperous and aristocratic) and sallied forth to the
park, followed by all her interesting flock.

The men didn't fail to look at her, as you may guess; but none looked
with yearning until the Woggle-Bug, sauntering gloomily along a path,
happened to raise his eyes and see before him his heart's delight the
very identical Wagnerian plaids which had filled him with such
unbounded affection.

"Aha, my excruciatingly lovely creation!" he cried, running up and
kneeling before the widow; "I have found you once again. Do not, I beg
of you, treat me with coldness!"

For he had learned from experience not to unduly startle his charmer at
their first moment of meeting; so he made a firm attempt to control
himself, that the wearer of the checked gown might not scorn him.

The widow had no great affection for bugs, having wrestled with the
species for many years; but this one was such a big-bug and so
handsomely dressed that she saw no harm in encouraging him--especially
as the men she had sought to captivate were proving exceedingly shy.

"So you tank Ay I ban loavely?" she asked, with a coy glance at the
Insect.

"I do! With all my heart I do!" protested the Woggle-Bug, placing all
four hands, one after another, over that beating organ.

"Das mak plenty trouble by you. I don'd could be yours!" sighed the
widow, indeed regretting her admirer was not an ordinary man.

"Why not?" asked the Woggle-Bug. "I have still the seven ninety-three;
and as that was the original price, and you are now slightly worn and
second-handed, I do not see why I need despair of calling you my own."

It is very queer, when we think of it, that the Woggle-Bug could not
separate the wearer of his lovely gown from the gown itself. Indeed, he
always made love directly to the costume that had so enchanted him,
without any regard whatsoever to the person inside it; and the only way
we can explain this remarkable fact is to recollect that the Woggle-Bug
was only a woggle-bug, and nothing more could be expected of him. The
widow did not, of course, understand his speech in the least; but she
gathered the fact that the Woggle-Bug had id money, so she sighed and
hinted that she was very hungry, and that there was a good short-order
restaurant just outside the park.

The Woggle-Bug became thoughtful at this. He hated to squander his
money, which he had come to regard a sort of purchase price with which
to secure his divinity. But neither could he allow those darling checks
to go hungry; so he said:

"If you will come with me to the restaurant, I will gladly supply you
with food."

The widow accepted the invitation at once, and the Woggle-Bug walked
proudly beside her, leading all of the four children at once with his
four hands.

Two such gay costumes as those worn by the widow and the Woggle-Bug are
seldom found together, and the restaurant man was so impressed by the
sight that he demanded his money in advance.

The four children, jabbering delightedly in their broken English,
clambered upon four stools, and the widow sat upon another. And the
Woggle-Bug, who was not hungry (being engaged in feasting his eyes upon
the checks), laid down a silver dollar as a guarantee of good faith.

It was wonderful to see so much pie and cake and bread-and-butter and
pickles and dough-nuts and sandwiches disappear into the mouths of the
four innocents and their comparatively innocent mother. The Woggle-Bug
had to add another quarter to the vanished dollar before the score
was finally settled; and no sooner had the tribe trooped out
restaurant than they turned into the open portals of an Ice-Cream
Parlor, where they all attacked huge stacks of pale ice-cream and
consumed several plates of lady-fingers and cream-puffs.

Again the Woggle-Bug reluctantly abandoned a dollar; but the end was
not yet. The dear children wanted candy and nuts; and then they warned
pink lemonade; and then pop-corn and chewing-gum; and always the
Woggle-Bug, after a glance at the entrancing costume, found himself
unable to resist paying for the treat.

It was nearly evening when the widow pleaded fatigue and asked to be
taken home. For none of them was able to eat another morsel, and the
Woggle-Bug wearied her with his protestations of boundless admiration.

"Will you permit me to call upon you this evening?" asked the Insect,
pleadingly, as he bade the wearer of the gown good-bye on her
door-step.

"Sure like!" she replied, not caring to dismiss him harshly; and the
happy Woggle-Bug went home with a light heart, murmuring to himself:

"At last the lovely plaids are to be my own! The new hat I found at the
ball has certainly brought me luck."

I am glad our friend the Woggle-Bug had those few happy moments, for he
was destined to endure severe disappointments in the near future.

That evening he carefully brushed his coat, put on a green satin
necktie and a purple embroidered waist-coat, and walked briskly towards
the house of the widow. But, alas! as he drew near to the dwelling a
most horrible stench greeted his nostrils, a sense of great depression
came over him, and upon pausing before the house his body began to
tremble and his eyes rolled wildly in their sockets.

For the wily widow, wishing to escape her admirer, had sprinkled the
door-step and the front walk with insect Exterminator, and not even the
Woggle-Bug's love for the enchanting checked gown could induce him to
linger longer in that vicinity.

Sick and discouraged, he returned home, where his first act was to
smash the luckless hat and replace it with another. But it was some
time before he recovered from the horrors of that near approach to
extermination, and he passed a very wakeful and unhappy night, indeed.

Meantime the widow had traded with a friend of hers (who had once been
a wash-lady for General Funston) the Wagnerian costume for a crazy
quilt and a corset that was nearly as good as new and a pair of silk
stockings that were not mates. It was a good bargain for both of them,
and the wash-lady being colored--that is, she had a deep mahogany
complexion--was delighted with her gorgeous gown and put it on the very
next morning when she went to deliver the wash to the brick-layer's
wife.

Surely it must have been Fate that directed the Woggle-Bug's steps;
for, as he walked disconsolately along, an intuition caused him to
raise his eyes, and he saw just ahead of him his affinity--carrying a
large clothes-basket.

"Stop!" he called our, anxiously; "stop, my fair Grenadine, I implore
you!"

The colored lady cast one glance behind her and imagined that Satan had
at last arrived to claim her. For she had never before seen the
Woggle-Bug, and was horrified by his sudden and unusual appearance.

"Go 'way, Mars' Debbil! Go 'way an' lemme 'lone!" she screeched, and
the next minute she dropped her empty basket and sped up the street
with a swiftness that only fear could have lent her flat-bottomed feet.

Nevertheless, the Woggle-Bug might have overtaken her had he not
stepped into the clothes-basket and fallen headlong, becoming so
tangled up in the thing that he rolled over and over several times
before he could free himself. Then, when he had picked up his hat,
which was utterly ruined, and found his cane, which had flown across
the street, his mahogany charmer in the Wagnerian Plaids had
disappeared from view.

With a sigh at his latest misfortune he returned home for another hat,
and the agitated wash-lady, imagining that the devil had doubtless been
lured by her beautiful gown, made haste to sell it to a Chinaman who
lived next door.

Its bright colors pleased the Chink, who ripped it up and made it over
into a Chinese robe, with flowing draperies falling to his heels. He
dressed himself in his new costume and, being proud of possessing such
finery, sat down on a bench outside his door so that everyone passing
by could see how magnificent he looked.

It was here the wandering Woggle-Bug espied him; and, recognizing at
once the pattern and colors of his infatuating idol, he ran up and sat
beside the Chinaman, saying in agitated but educated tones:

"Oh my prismatic personification of gigantic gorgeousness!--again I
have found you!"

"Sure tling," said the Chink with composure.

"Be mine! Only be mine!" continued the enraptured Woggle-Bug.

The Chinaman did not quite understand.

"Two dlolla a day," he answered, cautiously.

"Oh, joy," exclaimed the insect in delight; "I can then own you for a
day and a half--for I have three dollars left. May I feel your
exquisite texture, my dearest Fabric?"

"No flabic. No feelee. You too flesh. I _man_ Chinaman!" returned the
Oriental calmly.

"Never mind that! 'Tis your beautiful garment I love. Every check in
that entrancing dress is a joy and a delight to my heart!"

While the Woggle-Bug thus raved, the Chinaman's wife (who was Mattie De
Forest before she married him) heard the conversation, and decided this
love affair had gone far enough. So she suddenly appeared with a
broomstick, and with it began pounding the Woggle-Bug as fiercely as
possible--and Mattie was no weakling, I assure you.

The first blow knocked the Insect's hat so far over his eyes that he
was blinded; but, resolving not to be again cheated out of his darling,
he grasped firmly hold of the Wagnerian plaids with all four hands, and
tore a goodly portion of it from the frightened Celestial's body.

Next moment he was dashing down the street, with the precious cloth
tucked securely underneath an arm, and Mattie, being in slight
dishabile, did not think best to follow him.

The triumphant joy of the Woggle-Bug can well be imagined. No more need
he chase the fleeting vision of his love--no more submit to countless
disappointments in his efforts to approach the object of his affection.
The gorgeous plaids were now his own (or a large part of them, anyway),
and upon reaching the quiet room wherein he lodged he gloated long and
happily over its vivid coloring and violent contrasts of its glowing
hues. To the eyes of the Woggle-Bug nothing could be more beautiful,
and he positively regretted the necessity of ever turning his gaze from
this bewitching treasure.

That he might never in the future be separated from the checks, he
folded them, with many loving caresses, into compact form, and wrapped
them in a sheet of stout paper tied with cotton cord that had a
love-knot at the end. Wherever he went, thereafter, he carried the
parcel underneath his left upper arm, pressed as closely to his heart
as possible. And this sense of possession was so delightful that our
Woggle-Bug was happy as the day is long.

In the evening his fortunes changed with cruel abruptness.

He walked out to take the air, and noticing a crowd people standing in
an open space and surrounding a huge brown object, our Woggle-Bug
stopped to learn what the excitement was about.

Pushing his way through the crowd, and hugging his precious parcel, he
soon reached the inner circle of spectators and found they had
assembled to watch a balloon ascension. The Professor who was to go up
with the balloon had not yet arrived; but the balloon itself was fully
inflated and tugging hard at the rope that held it, as if anxious to
escape the blended breaths of the people that crowded around. Just
below the balloon was a small basket, attached to the netting of the
gas-bag, and the Woggle-Bug was bending over the edge of this, to see
what it contained, when a warning cry from the crowd caused him to
pause and glance over his shoulder.

Great horrors and crumpled creeps! Springing toward him, with a scowl
on his face and a long knife with a zig-zag blade in his uplifted hand,
was that very Chinaman from whose body he had torn the Wagnerian
plaids!

The plundered Celestial was evidently vindictive, and intended to push
the wicked knife into the Woggle-Bug's body.

Our hero was a brave bug, as can easily be proved; but he did not wait
for the knife to arrive at the broad of his back. Instead, he gave a
yell (to show he was not afraid) and leaped nimbly into the basket of
the balloon. The descending knife, missing its intended victim, fell
upon the rope and severed it, and instantly the great balloon from the
crowd and soared majestically toward the heavens.

The Woggle-Bug had escaped the Chinaman, but he didn't know whether to
be glad or not.

For the balloon was earning him into the clouds, and he had no idea how
to manage it, or to make it descend to earth again. When he peered over
the edge of the basket he could hear the faint murmur of the crowd, and
dimly see the enraged Professor (who had come too late) pounding the
Chinaman, while the Chinaman tried to dissect the Professor with his
knife.

Then all was blotted out; clouds rolled about him; night fell. The man
in the moon laughed at him; the stars winked at each other as if
delighted at the Woggle-Bug's plight, and a witch riding by on her
broomstick yelled at him to keep on the right side of the road, and not
run her down.

But the Woggle-Bug, squatted in the bottom of the basket and hugging
his precious parcel to his bosom, paid no attention to anything but his
own thoughts.

He had often ridden in the Gump; but never had he been so high as this,
and the distance to the ground made him nervous.

When morning came he saw a strange country far beneath him, and longed
to tread the earth again.

Now all woggle-bugs are born with wings, and our highly-magnified one
had a beautiful, broad pair of floppers concealed beneath ample
coat-tails. But long ago he had learned that his wings were not strong
enough to lift his big body from the ground, so he had never tried to
fly with them.

Here, however, was an occasion when he might put these wings to good
use, for if he spread them in the air and then leaped over the side of
the basket they would act in the same way a parachute does, and bear
him gently to the ground.

No sooner did this thought occur to him than he put it into practice.

Disentangling his wings from his coat-tails, he spread them as wide as
possible and then jumped from the car of the balloon.

Down, down the Woggle-Bug sank; but so slowly that there was no danger
in the flight. He began to see the earth again, lying beneath him like
a sun-kissed panorama of mud and frog-ponds and rocks and brushwood.

There were few trees, yet it was our insect's fate to drop directly
above what trees there were, so that presently he came ker-plunk into a
mass of tangled branches--and stuck there, with his legs dangling
helplessly between two limbs and his wings caught in the foliage at
either side.

Below was a group of Arab children, who at first started to run away.
But, seeing that the queer creature which had dropped from the skies
was caught fast in the tree, they stopped and began to throw stones and
clubs at it. One of the missiles struck the tree-limb at the right of
the Woggle-Bug and jarred him loose. The next instant he fluttered to
the ground, where his first act was to fold up his wings and tuck them
underneath his coat-tails again, and his next action was to assure
himself that the beloved plaids were still safe.

Then he looked for the Arab children; but they had scuttled away
towards a group of tents, and now several men with dark skins and gay
clothing came from the tents and ran towards the Woggle-Bug.

"Good morning," said our hero, removing his hat with a flourish and
bowing politely.

"Meb-la-che-bah!" shouted the biggest Arab, and at once two others
wound coils of rope around the Woggle-Bug and tied the ends in hard
knots.

His hat was knocked off and trampled into the mud by the Shiek (who was
the big Arab), and the precious parcel was seized and ruthlessly
opened.

"Very good!" said the Shiek, eyeing the plaids with pleasure. "My
slaves shall make me a new waistcoat of this cloth."

"No! oh, no!" cried the agonized Insect; "it is taken from a person who
has had small-pox and yellow-fever and toothache and mumps--all at the
same time. Do not, I bet you, risk your valuable life by wearing that
cloth!"

"Bah!" said the Shiek, scornfully; "I have had all those diseases and
many more. I am immune. But now," he continued, "allow me to bid you
good-bye. I am sorry to be obliged to kill you, but such is our
custom."

This was bad news for the Woggle-Bug; but he did not despair.

"Are you not afraid to kill me?" he asked, as if surprised.

"Why should I be afraid?" demanded the Shiek.

"Because it is well-known that to kill a woggle-bug brings bad luck to
one."

The Shiek hesitated, for he was very superstitious.

"Are you a woggle-bug?" he asked.

"I am," replied the Insect, proudly. "And I may as well tell you that
the last person who killed one of my race had three unlucky days. The
first his suspenders broke (the Arab shuddered), the second day he
smashed a looking-glass (the Arab moaned), and the third day he was
chewed up by a crocodile."

Now the greatest aversion Arabs have is to be chewed by a crocodile,
because these people usually roam over the sands of the desert, where
to meet an amphibian is simply horrible; so at the Woggle-Bug's speech
they set up a howl of fear, and the Shiek shouted:

"Unbind him! Let not a hair of his head be injured!"

At once the knots in the ropes were untied, and the Woggle-Bug was
free. All the Arabs united to show him deference and every respectful
attention, and since his own hat had been destroyed they wound about
his head a picturesque turban of an exquisite soiled white color,
having stripes of red and yellow in it.

Then the Woggle-Bug was escorted to the tents, where he suddenly
remembered his precious plaids, and asked that the cloth he restored to
him.

Thereupon the Shiek got up and made a long speech, in which he
described his grief at being obliged to refuse the request.

At the end of that time one of the women came op to them with a lovely
waistcoat which she had manufactured out of the Wagnerian plaids; and
when the Shiek saw it he immediately ordered all the tom-toms and
kettle-drums in the camp destroyed, as they were no longer necessary.
Then he put on the gorgeous vestment, and turned a deaf ear to the
Woggle-Bug's agonized wails.

But there were some scraps of cloth left, and to show that he was
liberal and good-natured, the Shiek ordered these manufactured into a
handsome necktie, which he presented Woggle-Bug in another long speech.

Our hero, realizing a larger part of his darling was lost to him,
decided to be content with the smaller share; so he put on the necktie,
and felt really proud of its brilliance and aggressive elegance.

Then, bidding the Arabs farewell, he strode across the desert until he
reached the borders of a more fertile and favored country.

Indeed, he found before him a cool and enticing jungle, which at first
seemed deserted. But while he stared about him a sound fell upon his
ear, and he saw approaching a young lady Chimpanzee. She was evidently
a personage of some importance, for her hair was neatly banged just
over her eyes, and she wore a clean white pinafore with bows of pink
ribbon at the shoulders.

"Good morning, Mr. Beetle," said she, with merry laughter.

"Do not, I beg of you, call me a beetle," exclaimed our hero, rather
peevishly; "for I am actually a Woggle-Bug, and Highly-Magnified at
that!"

"What's in a name?" laughed the gay damsel. "Come, let me introduce you
to our jungle, where strangers of good breeding are always welcome."

"As for breeding," said the Woggle-Bug, "my father, although of
ordinary size, was a famous Bug-Wizard in his day, and claimed descent
from the original protoplasm which constituted the nucleus of the
present planetary satellite upon which we exist."

"That's all right," returned Miss Chim. "Tell that to our king, and
he'll decorate you with the medal of the Omnipotent Order of Onerous
Orthographers, Are you ready to meander?"

The Woggle-Bug did not like the flippant tone in which maiden spoke;
but he at once followed her.

Presently they came to a tall hedge surrounding the Inner Jungle, and
without this hedge stood a patrol of brown bears who wore red
soldier-caps and carried gold-plated muskets in their hands.

"We call this the bearier," said Miss Chim, pointing to the soldiers,
"because they oblige all strangers to paws."

"I should think it was a bearicade," remarked the Woggle-Bug.

But when they approached the gateway the officer in charge saluted
respectfully to Miss Chim, and permitted her to escort the Woggle-Bug
into the sacred precincts of the Inner Jungle.

Here his eyes were soon opened to their widest capacity in genuine
astonishment.

The Jungle was as clean and as well-regulated as any city of men the
Insect had ever visited. Just within the gate a sleek antelope was
running a pop-corn stand, and a little further on a screech-owl stood
upon a stump playing a violin, while across her breast was a sign
reading: "I am blind--at present."

As they walked up the street they came to a big grey monkey turning a
hand-organ, and attached to a cord was a little nigger-boy whom the
monkey sent into the crowd of animals, standing by to gather up the
pennies, pulling him back every now and then by means of the cord.

"There's a curious animal for you," said Miss Chim, pointing to the
boy. "Those horrid things they call men, whether black or white, seem
to me the lowest of all created beasts."

"I have seen them in a highly civilized state," replied the Woggle-Bug,
"and they're really further advanced than you might suppose."

But Miss Chim gave a scornful laugh, and pulled him away to where a
hippopotamus sat under the shade of a big tree, mopping his brow with a
red handkerchief--for the weather was somewhat sultry. Before the hip
was a table covered with a blue cloth, and upon the cloth was
embroidered the words: "Professor Hipmus, Fortune Teller."

"Want your fortune told?" asked Miss Chim.

"I don't mind," replied the Woggle-Bug.

"I'll read your hand," said the Professor, with a yawn that startled
the insect. "To my notion palmistry is the best means of finding out
what nobody knows or cares to know."

He took the upper-right hand of the Woggle-Bug, and after adjusting his
spectacles bent over it with an air of great wisdom.

"You have been in love," announced the Professor; "but you got it in
the neck."

"True!" murmured the astonished Insect, putting up his left lower hand
to feel of the beloved necktie.

"You think you have won," continued the Hip; "but there are others who
have 1, 2. You have many heart throbs before you, during your future
life. Afterward I see no heart throbs whatever. Forty cents, please."

"Isn't he just wonderful?" asked Miss Chim, with enthusiasm. "He's the
greatest fortune teller in the jungle."

"On account of his size, I suppose," returned the Woggle-Bug, as they
walked on.

Soon they came to the Royal Palace, which was a beautiful bower formed
of vines upon which grew many brilliant-hued forest flowers. The
entrance was guarded by a Zebra, who barred admission until Miss Chim
whispered the password in his ear. Then he permitted them to enter, and
the Chimpanzee immediately ushered the Woggle-Bug into the presence of
King Weasel.

This monarch lay coiled upon a purple silk cushion, half asleep and yet
wakeful enough to be smoking a big cigar. Beside him crouched two
prairie-dogs who were combing his hair very carefully, while a red
squirrel perched near his head and fanned him with her bushy tail.

"Dear me, what have we here?" exclaimed the King of the Jungle, in a
querulous tone, "Is it an over-grown pinch-bug, or is it a
kissing-bug?"

"I have the honor to be a Woggle-Bug, your Majesty!" replied our hero,
proudly.

"Sav, cut out that Majesty," snapped the King, with a scowl. "If you
can find anything majestic about me, I'd like to know what it is."

"Don't treat him with any respect," whispered Miss Chim to the Insect,
"or you'll get him riled. Sneer at him, and slap his face if you get a
chance."

The Woggle-Bug took the hint.

"Really," he told the King. "I have never seen a more despicable
creature than you. The admirable perspicacity inherent in your tribe
seems to have deteriorated in you to a hyperbolated insousancy." Then
he reached out his arms and slapped the king four times, twice on one
side of his face and twice on the other.

"Thanks, my dear June-Bug," said the monarch; "I now recognize you to
be a person of some importance."

"Sire, I am a Woggle-Bug, highly magnified and thoroughly educated. It
is no exaggeration to say I am the greatest Woggle-Bug on earth."

"I fully believe it, so pray do not play any more foursomes on my jaw.
I am sufficiently humiliated at this moment to recognize you as a
Sullivanthauros, should you claim to be a member of that extinct race."

Then two little weasels--a boy weasel and a girl weasel--came into the
bower and threw their school-books at the squirrel so cleverly that one
hit the King upon the nose and smashed his cigar and the other caught
him fairly in the pit of his stomach.

At first the monarch howled a bit; then he wiped the tears from his
face and said:

"Ah, what delightful children I have! What do you wish, my darlings?"

"I want a cent for chewing gum," said the Girl Weasel.

"Get it from the Guinea-Pig; you have my assent. And what does my dear
boy want?"

"Pop," went the Weasel, "our billy-goat has swallowed the hare you gave
me to play with."

"Dear me," sighed the King, "how often I find a hair in the butter!
Whenever I reign people carry umbrellas; and my son, although quite
polished, indulges only in monkey-shines! Uneasy lies the head that
wears a crown! but if one is scalped, the loss of the crown renders the
head still more uneasy."

"Couldn't they find a better king than you?" enquired the Woggle-Bug,
curiously, as the children left the bower.

"Yes; but no worse," answered the Weasel; "and here in the jungle
honors are conferred only upon the unworthy. For if a truly great
animal is honored he gets a swelled head, and that renders him
unbearable. They now regard the King of the Jungle with contempt, and
that makes all my subjects self-respecting."

"There is wisdom in that," declared the Woggle-Bug, approvingly; "a
single glance at you makes me content with being so excellent a bug."

"True," murmured the King, yawning. "But you tire me, good stranger.
Miss Chim, will you kindly get the gasoline can? It's high time to
eradicate this insect."

"With pleasure," said Miss Chim, moving away with a smile.

But the Woggle-Bug did not linger to be eradicated. With one wild bound
he cleared the door of the palace and sprinted up the entrance of the
Jungle. The bear soldiers saw him running away, and took careful aim
and fired. But the gold-plated muskets would not shoot straight, and
now the Woggle-Bug was far distant, and still running with all his
might.

Nor did he pause until he had emerged from the forest and crossed the
plains, and reached at last the city from whence he had escaped in the
balloon. And, once again in his old lodgings, he looked at himself in
the mirror and said:

"After all, this necktie is my love--and my love is now mine
forevermore! Why should I not be happy and content?"

                                PREFACE.


This little book should be used as a simple guide to the practical study
of Nature rather than as a mere reader.

Every lesson herein set down has, during the author’s many years’
experience in teaching Nature Study, been taught by observation and
practice again and again; and each time with satisfactory result. The
materials required for most of the lessons—whether they be obtained from
the naturalist-dealer or from the nearest hedge, ditch, or pond—are
within everybody’s reach.

There is nothing that appeals to the heart of the ordinary child like
_living things_, be they animal or vegetable, and there is no branch of
education at the present day that bears, in the young mind, such
excellent fruit as the study of the simple, living things around us.

Your child is nothing if not curious. He wants to understand everything
that lives and moves and has its being in his bright little world.

Nature Study involves so many ingenious little deductions, that the
reasoning powers are almost constantly employed, and intelligence grows
proportionately. The child’s powers of observation are stimulated, and
his memory is cultivated in the way most pleasing to his inquiring
nature. By dissecting seeds, bulbs, buds, and flowers, his hand is
trained, and methods expeditious and exact are inculcated. By drawing
his specimens, no matter how roughly or rapidly, his eye is trained more
thoroughly than any amount of enforced copying of stiff, uninteresting
models of prisms, cones, etc., ever could train it.

The love of flowers and animals is one of the most commendable traits in
the disposition of the wondering child, and ought to be encouraged above
all others.

It is the author’s fondest and most sanguine hope that the working out
of the exercises, of which this booklet is mainly composed, may prove
much more of a joy than a task, and that the practical knowledge gained
thereby may tempt his little readers to study further the great book of
Nature, whose broad pages are ever open to us, and whose silent answers
to our manifold questions are never very difficult to read.

                         I.—STRUCTURE OF STEMS.


“We are going to have a peep into the inside of these twigs,” said Uncle
George, as he laid some willow and horse-chestnut twigs on the table.

“First,” he said, “let us examine the outside of them.” He handed a
small willow branch to Tom and a horse-chestnut branch to Frank.

“Now, Frank, tell me all you see.”

“I see the rings of scars which mark each year’s growth,” said Frank.
“This year’s growth is at the top, above the first ring of scars. Below
this is last year’s growth. Then comes another ring of marks, and below
this again is the growth of two years ago.”[1]

“That is to say,” said his uncle, “the upper part of your twig is about
one year old, the middle part is two years old, and the lower part is
three years old. Go on, Frank.”

“The upper part is light brown, while the middle and lower parts are
dark brown.”

“Take your lens, Frank, and look at that brown covering carefully.”

“Oh, it is studded all over with little oval marks like pits,” said
Frank.

“Now, what about the buds?”

“The buds,” said Frank, putting down his lens, “are in pairs; and the
stem is swollen where each pair of buds comes off.”

“Very good,” said Uncle George. “That is exactly what I wanted you to
notice. The swollen parts of a stem are called its _nodes_. In every
stem, buds and leaves occur at the nodes. Nodes are very well seen in
grass and corn stems.”

“Then at the top of the twig there is a very large bud and a pair of
small buds, one on each side of it,” said Frank.

“You have described it very well,” said his uncle. “Now, Tom, what about
the willow twig?”

“I see some very tiny marks on it,” said Tom. “There are no rings
marking the year’s growth; and the buds are not arranged in pairs.”

   [Illustration: Horse-Chestnut Twig, showing Three Years’ Growth.]

“That is quite right, Tom. Willow grows very quickly. Your twig is all
one season’s growth. It is smooth and green—not brown like the
horse-chestnut twig. The buds are arranged alternately. That is to say,
there is only one bud at each node.”

“Now, let us see what the horse-chestnut twig is made of.”

Uncle George next cut two pieces off the top part of the horse-chestnut
twig and handed one to each of the boys.

“Now, take your knives,” he said, “and carefully peel off a very small
piece of the brown covering. You will have to be very careful, as it is
very thin and rather difficult to remove. Ah, Frank, you have done that
very nicely. Now, hold it up to the light and tell us what you think it
is for.”

“It is the skin or covering of the twig,” said Frank.

“It is; and if you look with your lens you will see that the tiny
markings on it are holes. It is really a thin layer of bark or cork.
Perhaps you can tell me why the twig is covered with a thin layer of
cork?”

“To keep water from getting in,” said Frank.

“Rather to keep water from getting _out_,” said Uncle George. “You must
remember that water is continually passing up stems from the roots.
Water cannot pass through cork. If we were to remove the cork layer from
the outside of a growing twig, that twig would shrivel up and die. There
is also a layer of cork protecting the willow twig, but it is so very
thin that we can see through it. Remove as much of the cork layer as you
can, and tell me what is underneath.”

“There is a layer of green stuff beneath,” said Frank.

“Just so,” said Uncle George. “Now, if you remember, I once told you
that plants took most of their food from the air by means of the green
stuff in their leaves. This green layer in the twig does the same thing;
but how can the air get in if it is covered up by a layer of cork?”

“Oh, I see now,” said Tom, “what the tiny holes or pits are for—to let
air in to the green layer underneath.”

 [Illustration: Diagram Sections of (A and B) a One-Year Old and (C and
                         D) Two-Year Old Stem.]

  1. Bark.
  2. Green Layer.
  3. Bast.
  4. Slippery Layer.
  5. Wood.
  6. Pith.

“That is what they are for, Tom,” said Uncle George. “Scrape away this
green layer. It is greenest on the outside and is rather thick. There
are really two or three layers there, but they cannot be separated with
a pen-knife. What do you come to next?”

“A white, woody layer with a very slippery surface,” said Frank.

“That slippery surface is itself a layer, and a very important one,”
said his uncle. “The wood, you can see, is a very thick layer. In the
centre you have a mass of dry, spongy stuff. This is called the pith.”

Uncle George then cut the twig straight across, and the boys saw that
each layer formed a ring. In the middle there was a round mass of pith.
Around this was a thick ring of wood with the thin slippery layer
outside. Outside this was a fairly thick ring, the outer half of which
was green in colour. And outside the whole lot was the ring of the thin
bark or cork which the boys had first examined.

“We have seen,” said Uncle George, “how a one-year-old stem is built.
Let us now make a clean cut through the two-year-old part of the twig,
and another through the three-year-old part.

“You see there are two rings of wood in the two-year-old part and three
rings of wood in the three-year-old part. What does this show us?”

“That a ring of wood is added every year,” said Frank.

“And so, three years ago, this thick branch was a tiny bud,” said Uncle
George, pointing to the lower part of the twig.


                         Exercises on Lesson I.

  1. An apple will keep sound for months if the skin is unbroken. If we
          remove a small piece of the skin, the apple soon shrivels up.
          How is this?
  2. Can you explain why we ought not to eat the outer skins of the
          plum, grape, tomato, pear, etc.?
  3. Cut a stout twig of any tree straight through. Make a rough sketch
          showing the different layers, and tell how old the twig is.
  4. Get stout twigs of different trees, such as ash, elm, holly,
          sycamore. Take about an inch length of each. Split these down
          the centre, and see if you can make out the different layers
          on each side of the pith. Make an enlarged drawing of one of
          these.




                          II.—BULBS AND CORMS.


“These,” said Uncle George, “are what we grow our snowdrops and crocuses
from.”

As he spoke he handed each of the boys a few hard, round objects. Some
of these were small, white, and almost pear-shaped. The others were
larger, rounder, and brown in colour.

“The small white ones are snowdrop _bulbs_,” he continued. “The others
are crocus _corms_. There is a great difference between a bulb and a
corm, as we shall see when we examine and compare them.”

“The corm is covered with brown, papery skins, and has white buds on the
top of it,” said Frank.

“These brown skins are leaves,” remarked Uncle George.

“Leaves?” said Tom. “I thought all leaves were green.”

“Oh no, Tom, there are other leaves besides green leaves, called
scale-leaves. Green leaves, as you know, give off the moisture which the
roots take up from the soil. They also take in plant-food from the air.
Scale-leaves protect buds, flowers, and tender stems from cold and from
insects. These thin brown leaves of the crocus corm are scale-leaves
formed underground. Please remove the brown scale-leaves from one of the
corms, Frank.”

                             [Illustration]

  1. Snowdrop.
  2. Tulip.
  3. Narcissus.
  4. Crocus.

When Frank had done so, it was seen that these leaves were attached in
layers all round the corm. The corm was now a white, rounded lump. The
removal of the scale-leaves had left thin rings of leaf-marks; and on
these leaf-marks, here and there a tiny bud was seen.

“Now,” said Uncle George, “we can see that a corm is a stout, swollen,
underground stem. If you could imagine a horse-chestnut stem to be
squeezed up into a lump, you would have something like a corm. These
rings of leaf-marks are the nodes, where leaves and buds are found on
all stems. The large buds on the top of the corm correspond to the large
buds at the end of your horse-chestnut stem. Now, let us take off one of
these large top buds. Notice that it is covered with many tough,
protective scale-leaves.”

                 [Illustration: Crocus Bud Dissected.]

  1. Scales.
  2, 3, 4. Parts of Flower.
  5. Leaves.
  6. Spathe.
  7. Ovary.
  8. Young Corm. A. Old Corm.

Removing these scales, Uncle George came to a round object in the
centre.

“This,” he said, “is a long sack or bag. It contains the flower of the
crocus.”

Taking a needle, he carefully opened this up.

“Now, boys,” he said, “take your magnifiers and look carefully.”

Frank and Tom looked, and saw a curious little flower, surrounded by
four or five yellow needle-shaped things which, their uncle told them,
were the young green leaves of the crocus.

“Let us now,” he said, “examine the snowdrop bulb.

“Here we have thick, fleshy scale-leaves. If we remove them one by one,
we find that they are all attached to a flat, button-shaped stem.
Between the thick scale-leaves we see, here and there, a small side bud,
and on the top the baby snowdrop flower snugly wrapped up in their sack.
This protective sack is called a _spathe_.”

Uncle George then took from his pocket a very large bulb.

“This,” he said, “is the bulb of the narcissus or ‘white lily.’ It is
almost exactly like the snowdrop bulb, but it is larger, so that we can
see things much more distinctly.”

He then split the large bulb down the centre with his knife. With a pin
he pointed out the baby flower wrapped up in its spathe. All the parts
of the flower were seen, even the little seed-vessel containing the tiny
eggs, which become seeds after the flower has grown up.

“If you remember,” said Uncle George, “in our lesson on seeds we learned
that a seed contained a baby plant and a large supply of plant-food. I
am now going to show you that both the corm and the bulb contain a large
food supply. We have seen that the protective bud-scales in the corm are
tough and thin, while the stem is swollen and hard. In the bulb, on the
other hand, the bud-scales are thick and fleshy, while the stem is flat
and very small. If we place some of our crocus corms or snowdrop bulbs
in pure water, they will grow and flower just as well as if we had
planted them in the garden. What does this show us?”

“That, like the seeds which we grew in water, bulbs and corms contain a
store of food,” said Frank.

                             [Illustration]

  A. Narcissus Bulb split open.
    s., stem;
    b., side buds;
    s.l., scale-leaves;
    f.l., leaves.
  B. Snowdrop Bulb.
  C. Flower of same Dissected out.

“That is correct, Frank. Let us put a corm and a bulb in water. Let us
also plant one of each in a pot of soil. We will watch them growing and
compare them from week to week.

“Now I am going to show you a simple experiment. You know that the food
we eat is drawn largely from plants. This food which we take from the
plant world is chiefly what the chemist calls _starch_. We have it in
bread, potatoes, rice, cornflour, and in nearly all the vegetables we
eat.

“I have here in this bottle a substance, called _iodine_, dissolved in
water. Anything containing _starch_ turns blue when touched with iodine.
Now observe what happens here.”

Uncle George poured some of the iodine into a saucer. He then dipped
into the iodine a piece of crocus corm, a thick scale of the snowdrop
bulb, soaked seeds of maize and wheat, a slice of raw potato, and a
piece of bread. Each at once turned dark blue on being dipped into the
liquid.

“Now, boys,” he said, “what do you learn from this?”

“The food store in bulbs and corms is the same as that in seeds,” said
Tom.

“The food supply of the bulb is contained in the thick, fleshy
scale-leaves, while in the corm it is in the stem,” said Frank.

“Very good,” said Uncle George. “It also shows us, I think, that we
ourselves owe a great deal to the plant world.”


                        Exercises on Lesson II.

  1. Split an onion (or tulip bulb) down the centre, and compare it with
          the snowdrop bulb. Draw it, giving special attention to the
          middle part.
  2. Take a potato and a crocus corm. Observe them both carefully, and
          find out (1) how they resemble each other, and (2) how they
          differ.
  3. Explain how it is that a hyacinth grows so well in water.
  4. Take any underground stem (_e.g._, iris or Solomon’s seal) and
          compare it with a crocus corm. Notice the marks of underground
          scale-leaves on the former.




                   III.—WHAT GOES ON INSIDE A PLANT.


“We have seen how an ordinary twig is built up,” said Uncle George. “Let
us now try to find out what goes on inside the twig; and in order to do
this we shall have to perform one or two simple experiments.”

Uncle George took two wide-mouthed glass jars. They were both perfectly
dry, and each could be closed with a large, tight-fitting cork. He
placed some fresh green leaves inside one of the jars. The other
remained empty. Then both jars were tightly corked up, and both corks
covered outside with wax.

                   [Illustration: First Experiment.]

“That is experiment number one,” he said, as he placed both jars in the
window.

He next took a small plant which was growing in a pot. He wrapped the
pot up in thick, dry paper, so that the paper covered up everything but
the plant. The edges of the paper were tied tightly round the lower part
of the stem of the plant with a string. The plant was put in the window,
and over it Uncle George placed a glass bell-jar.

                   [Illustration: Second Experiment.]

“The third experiment is much simpler,” he said. “You see I just put one
of the willow twigs into a glass half filled with water, and into the
water I pour some red ink. Frank, place a white pansy in the coloured
water beside the willow twig.”

Uncle George’s fourth experiment was as follows:—

He placed four willow twigs in a glass of water. But from two of these
twigs he first removed a broad ring of the bark and outer layers,
leaving about an inch of the wood bare near the lower end of the twig.

“Now,” said he, “we will come back in about an hour, and I think we
shall find that some change has taken place in each of our first three
jars.

“The fourth glass one will have to be left for several weeks; and we
must take care to keep water always in the glass containing these four
twigs.”

About an hour afterwards, Uncle George and the boys came to look at the
experiments.

“Let us examine experiment one first,” said Uncle George.

“The empty jar is just the same as when we put it there,” said Tom. “The
jar containing the leaves is all dimmed, and there are tiny drops of
water on the inside of it.”

“Where did that water come from, Tom?”

“It must have come out of the leaves.”

“Exactly so! Now look at the second experiment, and you will see that
the bell-jar which covered both plant and pot is also dimmed with
moisture. Pot and soil were securely covered up, so that this moisture
on the glass must have come from the leaves of the plant. Where do you
think this water really comes from?”

“From the soil in the pot,” said Frank. “If we did not water those
plants which we keep in pots, they would die.”

“Then we have learnt that water travels up the stems of plants,” said
Uncle George, “also that it is drawn from the soil and is given off by
the leaves. The third experiment, where we placed a twig in coloured
water, will, I think, show us which part of the stem the water travels
up.”

Uncle George peeled the bark off the lower end of the willow twig which
was placed in the mixture of red ink and water. He removed all the
layers until he came to the wood. The wood was stained red. He cut slice
after slice off the twig, and it was found that the coloured water had
gone quite an inch up through the wood. None of the other layers of the
twig were stained red.

“It travels up through the wood-layer,” said Frank. “And look at the
pansy flower. It was white when we put it into the glass, now it is all
streaked with red.”

“The flower itself,” said Uncle George, “is not near the coloured
water.”

“The water must have travelled up the long stalk to the flower,” said
Frank.

                 [Illustration: The Fourth Experiment.]

The fourth experiment was left in the window, and two or three weeks
passed before any change was noticed in any of the four twigs which had
been placed in the water. Then roots began to grow. In the two whole
twigs these roots grew out at the bottom end. But in those twigs from
which the belt of outer layers had been removed, it was quite different.
Here the roots grew out—not at the bottom, but just where the ring of
bare wood began and at the top of it.

Frank and Tom were quite puzzled. They could not understand why the
roots should come at the bottom in two of the twigs and not in the other
two.

“First of all, then,” said Uncle George, “these new roots were made from
materials which came from inside the plant. These building materials are
carried through the plant dissolved in water—just as you dissolve sugar
in your tea. Water containing these dissolved stuffs in a plant is
called _sap_.

“We have seen, by our first three experiments, that water travels up the
wood part of the stem. This experiment shows us that sap travels _down_
the stem in the layers outside the wood. For, when I removed the outer
layers and left a bare ring of wood, the flow of the sap was stopped and
the new roots formed there.”

“And where does this sap come from first of all?” Tom asked.

“It is really formed in the leaf first of all. I think I told you that
plants take most of their food from the air by means of their green
leaves. In the great quantities of water which pass up the wood and into
the air from the leaves there is always a very little mineral matter
dissolved. This small quantity of mineral matter comes from the soil.
This, along with water and the large quantity of matter taken from the
air, are changed, inside the leaf, into a fluid which we call sap.

“Our four experiments show us that water travels up through the
wood-layer from soil to leaf; and also that sap travels down through one
of the outside layers of the stem.”


                        Questions on Lesson III.

  1. How does water travel in a plant? How can you prove this?
  2. If we enclose a leafy plant in a glass vessel, we see that water is
          given off by the leaves. How is it that we do not see this
          water when the plant is grown in the open air?
  3. What is “sap”? Where is it first formed? How does it travel in the
          twig or stem?
  4. If we keep ferns growing under a glass bell—or in a glass case—we
          never have to water them. Can you explain this?




                    IV.—SNOWDROP, CROCUS, AND TULIP.


The boys watched the growth of the crocuses in water and in soil from
day to day, and made sketches of them once a week. Fed by the food
contained in the corm, the top buds of the crocus grew longer. Then the
scales moved apart and the yellow flower was seen. Round about it were
four or five narrow green leaves, each having a pretty white stripe down
the middle. Both leaves and flower were encircled at the base by long
white sheaths.

The crocus grown in the pot did not seem to thrive much better than the
one in the water. Both flowers remained closed for a long time after
they were full grown.

At last, on one fine sunny day, they opened out wide at the top, and the
boys could see right down into them. In the evening they closed up
again. Next day was a dull day, and the crocus flowers remained closed.

The snowdrops were also watched and sketched. Their growth was somewhat
different. From the centre of the little bulb two green leaves first
appeared. These leaves were much broader and thicker than those of the
crocus. From between these leaves a little white, flat object grew up.
This the boys at once recognised as the spathe or bag containing the
flower. Then more green leaves came up. The flower-stalk grew longer.
The spathe split open, and the flower-bud appeared.

This bud grew until it became a beautiful white bell hanging downwards.

                    [Illustration: Crocus Flowers.]

In a large pot Uncle George had planted a few tulip bulbs. They were not
completely covered with soil, so that their growth could be watched.
Their growth was similar to that of the snowdrop. The leaves came first.
They were rolled firmly round each other. As each large, broad, green
leaf unrolled, another rolled-up leaf was seen under it. These leaves
were rolled round a thick stalk, to which they were attached. When the
last leaf unrolled, a single flower was seen at the top of the stalk.
This flower remained closed up like the crocus. When at length, however,
the warm sun shone in the window, the tulip flowers opened out very wide
indeed; in fact, they became almost saucer-shaped.

Then Uncle George dug the snowdrop and crocus out of their pots. He
washed the roots and asked the boys to compare them with those grown in
water.

“The plants grown in soil seem stronger in flower and leaves,” said
Frank. “But the greatest difference is in the corm and bulb.”

“That is right, Frank,” said Uncle George. “Look at the crocus corms.
They have both shrunk a great deal, because they have been used up to
form what has grown out of them. But the one grown in soil has formed a
new corm, which will produce new flowers next year. This new corm has
grown upon the top of the old one. The crocus grown in water has also
produced a new corm, but it is too small to produce a flower next year.

“Then, again, take the snowdrop. The one grown in the soil has produced
two or three new bulbs, while that grown in water has not. These new
bulbs were the side buds we noticed between the scales when we opened
out our snowdrop bulb. In both snowdrops the old bulb has been
completely used up to form green leaves and flower.

“But the bulb grown in soil has not only produced flowers and green
leaves. It has gathered up enough material from soil and air to form new
bulbs for next year.”

                             [Illustration]

  2. Crocus Plant.
  3. Old and Young Corms of Crocus.
  4. Young Snowdrop Flower enclosed in its spathe.
  5. Crocus Flower.
  6. Tulip Flower dissected.

Uncle George then divided the crocus flower with his knife from top to
bottom.

“At the very bottom of the flower,” he said, “you see the ovary, or
seed-vessel, containing the tiny seeds. From the seed-vessel a long thin
rod or tube stretches to the very mouth of the flower. You can also see
the remains of the spathe which once enclosed the whole flower.”

“And what are those three things covered with orange-coloured dust?”
asked Tom.

“These,” said his uncle, “are the stamens or pollen-boxes; and the
orange-coloured powder is the pollen. This pollen is carried about from
flower to flower by the bees. Pollen is necessary for the production of
seeds.

“Do you know why the seed-vessel of the crocus is so far down under the
ground?

“It is because the crocus flowers in winter-time, and the frost might
kill the young seeds. Underground they are safe from frost. The snowdrop
is a hardy flower, and, besides, the walls of its seed-vessel are very
thick.

“The tulip, if grown outside, flowers much later than the other two
plants.

“Notice the difference between the flower of the tulip and those of
either crocus or snowdrop. Its petals are all separate, while those of
the others are joined to form a bell or tube. The seed-vessel of the
tulip, also, stands right up in the centre of the flower, while that of
the snowdrop (and crocus) is placed underneath the flower altogether.”

“How is it, Uncle George, that the flowers of both tulip and crocus open
out wide when the sun shines and close when the sun goes down?” asked
Frank.

“Plants can feel to a certain extent,” said Uncle George. “That is to
say, they are affected by heat and cold, by light and shade. A great
many flowers close up at night—the daisy, for instance; and have you
never noticed how clover leaves fold up long before night comes?”

“Yes, but why should the crocus and tulip open and close? The snowdrop
never closes up.”

“They do so to protect their pollen,” his uncle answered. “Rain or dew
would ruin pollen. Those flowers, like the crocus and tulip, which open
out to the sky must close up, or the precious pollen would be destroyed.
Flowers like the snowdrop and bluebell, which hang downwards, have no
need to close up, for their pollen is under a roof of joined petals.”


                        Exercises on Lesson IV.

  1. Place an onion or daffodil bulb in the mouth of a bottle containing
          water. Keep it in the dark for about ten days. Then place it
          in the window. Make sketches every week.
  2. Make a list of all the plants you know which close their flowers,
          or fold up their leaves, at night.
  3. Cut open a flower of the daffodil (or narcissus), also one of the
          wallflower. Draw both, naming their parts. What points of
          difference do you notice in the two flowers?
  4. Examine the following flowers, and see if you can find where the
          young seeds are:—Hyacinth, primrose, violet (or pansy),
          chickweed, Christmas rose, shepherd’s purse.




                         V.—VEGETABLE FINGERS.


When the sweet-peas in the garden were nearly full grown, Uncle George
sowed some sweet-peas in a pot. In a fortnight those sown in the pot
were about four inches in height, and those in the garden were in
flower.

“Let us go into the garden, boys,” he said, “and see if we can learn
something from the sweet-pea.”

In the garden the sweet-peas were really lovely. They looked, as Frank
said, like so many beautiful butterflies on the wing; and they filled
the air with delicious perfume.

“I think,” said Frank, “that our row of sweet-peas is by far the best
thing in the garden.”

“That is quite true, Frank,” said his uncle, “but it is not so much the
flowers we are going to study at present. The sweet-pea is certainly one
of our finest flowering plants. It is also one of the most interesting.
Can you tell me why we put stakes up for our sweet-pea plants to cling
to?”

“Because they have long, slender stems—too slender and weak to grow up
by themselves,” said Frank.

“Quite right, Frank. If the sweet-pea were a wild plant, where would it
grow?”

“In the hedges,” said Tom.

“Right again,” said Uncle George. “If we grow the sweet-pea in the
garden, we must imitate its surroundings in the wild state—we must give
it a hedge of some kind to cling to, otherwise it would trail along the
ground.”

“Then it would get choked among the other plants,” said Frank.

                             [Illustration]

  Rose Leaf.
  Vetch Leaf.
  Ash Leaf.

“What do you mean by ‘_choked_,’ Frank?”

“Well, it would die for want of air”——

“And light,” his uncle added. “No green plant can live without air and
sunlight; and, in order to get these, our weak-stemmed sweet-pea has to
climb. It clings to its stronger brethren just as the wild peas do in
the hedgerow. Now notice how it climbs. The end part of each leaf
consists of little gripping organs called tendrils. These twine tightly
round the smallest twigs near them.

                             [Illustration]

  1. Ox Eye.
  2. Daisy.
  3. Corn Marigold.

“Here is a rose leaf. It is composed of several leaflets, and at its
base there are two small, brownish-green things called _stipules_. If we
compare this leaf with the leaf of the sweet-pea, we find that in some
points they are similar, but in others very different.

                             [Illustration]

  Sweet-Pea.
  Edible Pea.

“The rose leaf is called a compound leaf, because it is made up of many
small leaflets. The sweet-pea leaf is also a compound leaf, but it has
only two leaflets, and these are of enormous size. The rose leaf has two
small stipules. The stipules of the sweet-pea leaf are large and green.

“If I place the rose leaf beside a sweet-pea leaf, you will notice that
the latter has _no upper leaflets_.”

“It has tendrils ‘instead,’” said Frank.

“Exactly!” said Uncle George. “These tendrils correspond to leaflets.
Now, if the plant has been forced to turn all its leaflets, except two,
into gripping organs, how does it manage to make up for this loss of
green leaves?

                   [Illustration: Young Edible Pea.]

“We have already learned that plants take in food from the air by means
of the green substance in their leaves. The more of this green substance
a plant possesses, the more food it can take in from the air. If it
sacrifices leaves in order to climb up to the light and air, its amount
of the green material must be lessened. But the sweet-pea makes up for
this loss of leaves. Can you see how it does so?”

“The stipules are very large,” said Frank.

“And the lower part of the leaf-stalk is very flat, broad, and green,”
added Tom.

“Very good,” said Uncle George, “but look at the long, slender stem. It
has flat, green, ribbon-like outgrowths on each side throughout its
whole length. So, you see, what the plant loses in leaves, it makes up
in another way.

“Let us now look at the ordinary pea plant. Its leaf has four pairs of
leaflets and three pairs of tendrils besides the terminal tendril—seven
tendrils altogether. The stipules here are also very large—much larger
than those of the sweet-pea. But the stem is round and smooth. There are
no green outgrowths. Here is a wild pea, which I found to-day, which has
no leaves at all. All its leaflets have been turned into tendrils or
gripping organs. But look at the enormous stipules it has! They are much
bigger than ordinary pea leaves.

                             [Illustration]

  A Wild Pea with no Leaves.
  Young Sweet-Peas have no Tendrils.

“Let us now look at the tendrils of the sweet-pea, and see how they grip
their supports. Notice that they begin to twist long before they reach
the supporting twig. Then, when they have reached it, they twist round
it _in the opposite way_—just like a piece of string, if you twist it at
one end, it untwists at the other.”

“Can you see any reason for this coiling before it reaches the twig?” As
he spoke, Uncle George pulled a sweet-pea plant out from its supports,
and the boys saw that the tendril was really a spiral spring. The plant
could be pulled out a considerable length without breaking the tendril.

“You see,” Uncle George continued, “if it were not for that first
coiling of the tendril—that is to say, if the tendril grew out straight
and only began to twist when it reached the twig—the first breeze of
wind would snap the plant from its supports and it would fall to the
ground.

“Look now, at the young sweet-peas which we grew in the pot. They are
without tendrils of any kind. This shows us, I think, that the sweet-pea
was at one time a small plant, like its relative the clover. It grew in
open places and did not have to struggle for light and air. But, by and
by, when strong growing plants took up the soil, it became forced to
produce climbing organs or become choked out. And, having turned its
leaves into climbing or gripping organs, it made up for the loss of
leaves by producing large stipules and green out-growths to stem and
leaf.”


                         Exercises on Lesson V.

  1. Draw a leaf of the wild rose and one of the sweet-pea side by side.
  2. Make a list of all the climbing plants you know, and state how each
          climbs.
  3. Look for stipules on the apple, pansy, and bean leaves—make
          sketches.
  4. Those plants of the pea family which have many leaflets have smooth
          round stems. Those which have few leaflets have “winged”
          stems. Can you explain this?




                      VI.—THE GREAT WATER BEETLE.


During summer the boys paid many visits to the horse pond. Each time
they went there they saw something to interest them.

Their uncle taught them to keep perfectly still while looking into the
water. They soon came to know that this was the best way to study
pond-life, for, whenever they moved, the creatures they were watching
would dart out of sight.

One day, while they were both lying on the bank gazing into the pond, a
huge black beetle came up to the surface of the water. It remained there
for a few moments, with its head hanging downwards and its tail sticking
right out of the water. Then it dived down out of sight. In a few
minutes it came up again, and this time Frank’s net was under it before
it could escape.

Just as Frank was putting it into the glass jar, Tom whispered, “Here is
another one—quick, Frank!”

But Frank was too late; for before he could get the first beetle into
the jar, the second one had dived to the bottom of the pond. The boys
waited for a long time, hoping to see the other beetle again. At last
their patience was rewarded. The beetle came up again to the surface. As
soon as it did so, in went the net, and out came beetle number two.

“What big beauties,” said Frank. “I wonder what they are. Let us hurry
home and show them to Uncle George.”

When they got home, their uncle placed the two beetles in a glass tank
by themselves, so that they could be more easily observed.

“What do you call them, uncle?” asked Frank. “We have never seen such
large, handsome beetles before.”

            [Illustration: Dyticus Beetle, male and female.]

“Have you not?” his uncle replied. “I am surprised at that, for this
beetle is found in nearly all our ponds and ditches. It has a long Latin
name,[2] which means _Bordered Diver_, but it is commonly known as the
‘great water beetle.’ There are several kinds of these diving beetles.
This is the largest. Can you give me an idea of their size?”

And Uncle George handed Frank a small measuring rule which he carried in
his pocket.

Frank looked at the beetles, and then moved his thumb nail along the
rule.

“About an inch and a half in length,” he said.

“That is about right,” said his uncle. “Are these two beetles exactly
alike?”

“They are both about the same shape and colour. One is slightly bigger
than the other. They are both greenish-black above and brown below.
There is a curious broad border of yellow all round the edge of their
bodies,” said Tom.

“But they are not both exactly alike,” said Frank, “I notice that one is
smooth on the back, while the other’s back is all grooved.”

“You are right, Frank,” said Uncle George. “The one with the grooved
wing-cases is the female. The one with the smooth cases is the male.

        [Illustration: Fore Leg of Male, showing Sucker Organ.]

“Notice the long legs they have for swimming, and how they seem to oar
themselves through the water. Notice also that the male has a large flat
disc upon each of his fore legs. These are suckers, by which he can
cling to things.”

“Why do they come up to the surface so often?” Frank asked.

“They cannot live without air. They carry a supply of air under their
wing-cases. They just come up to renew it from time to time. This is
done by thrusting the end of their bodies out of the water as you see.”

“One would think they ought to thrust their heads out to get air,” said
Tom.

“That seems more natural to us, because we breathe with our mouths,”
said Uncle George. “These animals take in air with their tails. A great
many pond insects breathe in this curious way.”

“What do they feed upon?” Frank asked.

“They are fierce, greedy creatures,” his uncle replied. “They attack and
kill worms, tadpoles, and even small fishes.”

Uncle George threw a small worm into the tank. One of the beetles seized
it at once and began to devour it greedily. Presently the other beetle
seized an end of the worm. The boys watched closely, and saw that the
beetles’ jaws moved from side to side like a pair of pincers.

Next morning, when Uncle George and the boys went in to see the beetles,
they found only one in the tank. The other had escaped during the night.
After a careful search they found it, at the far end of the room, dead.

“Now, how do you think this beetle managed to get out of the tank and
travel all that way?” Uncle George asked.

“It must have crawled up the inside of the tank, then down the outside.
Then it must have fallen off the window-sill, and crawled right across
the floor,” said Frank.

Uncle George shook his head.

“It might,” he said, “have managed to crawl up to the edge of the tank
so long as its legs were wet. But as its long legs are made for
swimming, and not for crawling with, I can hardly see how it could have
crawled or walked all that distance.”

“Then how did it get there, Uncle George?”

In answer to Frank’s question, his uncle took the dead beetle, and
placed it on a piece of paper on the table. He next moved aside each of
the large black wing-cases with a pin.

Underneath these wing-cases the boys saw a pair of large wings neatly
folded up. Uncle George removed one of the wing-cases, and unfolded one
of the wings. Stretched out, it was longer than the beetle’s body, and
it seemed to be made up of thin, clear skin, stretched on a framework of
long, thin supports.

“Why, these beetles can fly,” said Tom.

     [Illustration: Male and Female Beetles, showing Flying Wings.]

“Of course they can,” said his uncle. “All beetles can fly. This
creature has evidently been flying about the room all night. These
insects are furnished with wings, so that they may be able to fly to
another pool when food gets scarce, or when their pool dries up.”


                        Exercises on Lesson VI.

  1. Would you keep water beetles, tadpoles, and stickle-backs together?
          Give your reasons.
  2. Water beetles cannot live without air. Explain how they get it.
  3. Compare the legs of a water beetle with those of any of our garden
          beetles.
  4. Why are water beetles furnished with wings?




                             VII.—DAISIES.


While Uncle George and Frank and Tom were having a game of cricket,
Dolly was amusing herself in another way. She had pulled a bunch of
daisies and was joining them up into a daisy chain.

                     [Illustration: Common Daisy.]

She finished her daisy chain just as her uncle and the boys finished
their game.

“We will take some daisies home,” said Uncle George. He stooped down and
dug out a whole daisy plant with his knife, while Dolly gathered a small
bunch of the flowers. When they got home Uncle George placed his daisy
plant in a saucer of water, and told the boys to bring out their
magnifiers and sketch-books.

“First of all,” he said, “I want you to look at the daisy plant. Notice
its leaves. Each leaf is broad at the end and narrow where it joins the
plant. Notice also that the leaves all form a round green mat on the
ground. Now, can you tell me what the leaf resembles in shape.”

                             [Illustration]

  1. Daisy Leaf.
  2. Primrose Leaf.
  3. Cowslip Leaf.

“It is like a spoon,” said Tom. “It is,” said his uncle; “and can you
see any reason for it being so shaped?

“You cannot? Well, I must tell you. All plants whose leaves are all at
the ground have leaves shaped something like this. The primrose and
cowslip are good examples. We have seen that plants, like the pea, climb
up so that their leaves and green parts may get as much light and air as
possible. And if you look at any tree, such as the horse-chestnut, ash,
elm, or beech, you will notice that their leaves are spread out so as to
catch as much light as possible.”

Uncle George then drew a circle.

                             [Illustration]

  1 and 2. Diagram to show Leaf arrangement of Daisy.
  3. Head of Daisy split.
  4. Outer Floret.
  5. Inner Floret.

“Now, boys,” he said, “I want you to try to fill that circle with leaves
so shaped that they will fill it without covering one another. The best
way to do so is to make them broad at the end. If you make them broad at
the base and narrow at the end, they overlap and rob each other of light
and air. Now you can see why the leaves of the daisy are so shaped.

“Take up a daisy and split it down the centre with your knife. You will
notice that the daisy is _not_ a flower, but a collection of tiny
flowers, or florets, all packed closely together upon a pad or disc, and
surrounded outside by many little green things like small leaves. These
little leaf-like things are called _bracts_.”

        [Illustration: London Pride, showing Leaf arrangement.]

“There are two distinct kinds of florets,” said Frank, looking at the
split daisy with his lens.

“Yes,” said Uncle George, “you will see them better if you remove one of
each with a pin, and examine them separately.”

“The outer florets are very large and white,” said Frank.

“They are very flat, while the inner ones are yellow and round. They are
very like small crocus flowers. What is that small two-headed thing that
comes out in the centre of each floret?”

“That is the part which leads to the seed-vessel. Can you see the
seed-vessel at the bottom of each floret?”

“Yes,” said Tom, “it is large and round. On the top of it and all round
the petal part of the floret there are long silky hairs.”

“In flowers of this kind, when the seeds are ripe they are carried away
by the wind,” said Uncle George. “The petal part withers, but the tuft
of hairs remain. They are to the seed what sails are to a ship. They are
much better seen in some other flowers related to the daisy, such as the
thistle.

“Now cut open the seed-vessel and see how many seeds it contains.”

“There is only one, I think,” said Frank.

“You think correctly,” said his uncle. “Each seed-vessel holds a single
seed.”

“The seed-vessel in the large white floret is small and flat,” said Tom.

“It is,” said Uncle George. “In fact, the outer florets seldom produce
seeds.”

“Then what is the use of them?” Tom asked.

“I’ll show you,” said Uncle George. As he spoke he took up a fresh daisy
flower.

“Look!” he said, “what a pretty flower it is, with its golden centre and
its bright white edge tipped with red. It is like a beautiful star.”

Then he pulled off all the large white florets.

“Look at it now,” he said. “It is a dingy, ugly little flower. Without
its white florets it would not be seen at all. Now perhaps you can tell
me what the large white florets are for.”

“To help us to see them at a distance,” said Frank.

“So that bees and other flying insects may be able to see them,” said
Uncle George.

“Insects visit flowers for honey, and, in doing so, carry the yellow
dust, or pollen, from flower to flower. This pollen, as I told you
before, has to do with the making of seeds: and stronger seeds are
produced if the pollen comes from another flower.

“Now compare a white floret with a yellow one, and you will notice still
another difference between them.

“Round the _stigma_—that is the forked tube which leads to the
seed-vessel—in the yellow florets, there is a yellow ring of _stamens_,
or pollen-boxes. It is shaped like a little barrel with its ends knocked
out, and the _stigma_ grows right up through it.

“In the white florets there are no pollen-boxes of any kind.

“Thus, we see that the inner florets are _perfect_ florets which produce
seeds.

“The outer florets have all run to petal. Their business is to show the
way to the plain little florets in the middle.

“There is another thing about the daisy that I should like you to
notice,” Uncle George continued. “If you go out on a dull day, or in the
evening, you will find all the daisy flowers closed up. They only open
out in bright sunshine, when all the insects are flying about.”


                        Exercises on Lesson VII.

  1. Daises are called “composite” flowers. Can you tell why? Cut a
          large “ox-eye daisy” or corn marigold through the centre and
          examine the florets carefully.
  2. Using a lens, draw separately, an inside and an outside floret.
          Make your drawings large, and name the various parts of each
          floret.
  3. Take two ox-eye daisies. Pull off all the white florets of one of
          them. Then compare them. Pin both flowers up on the wall. Go
          back about thirty paces and note which flower is best seen.
  4. The daisy leaves form a little rosette on the ground. Make a
          collection of wild plants which have similar leaves. Draw a
          single leaf of each, and compare with those of the daisy.

                   [Illustration: Nest of Chaffinch.]




                    VIII.—CHAFFINCH AND SONG-THRUSH.


It was Frank who found the chaffinch’s nest in the wood. It was built in
the fork of a small tree, about eight feet from the ground.

Although not surrounded either by branches or leaves, it was completely
hidden, for the cunning little birds had matched the outside of the nest
exactly with the bark of the tree.

Uncle George got an old chaffinch’s nest from the gardener, and showed
the boys how it was constructed. Horse-hair, feathers, and moss were
neatly woven together to form the nest. The inside was lined with finer
hairs and feathers. The outside was covered with pieces of bark, lichen,
and faded moss. These were stuck on with silken threads stolen from
spider’s webs. The whole thing looked at a distance more like a part of
the tree than a bird’s nest.

                   [Illustration: A CHAFFINCH’S NEST]

                       [Illustration: THE THRUSH]

The next time the boys went to see the nest they found four tiny eggs in
it. They were bluish-green in colour, and splashed with red and brown
marks.

It was while paying a third visit to the chaffinch’s nest that Uncle
George found the nest of the song-thrush.

High up on a tall tree the cock thrush was pouring out his song, and
filling the woods with melody.

“Can you see him, boys?” Uncle George asked, and he handed Frank a pair
of field-glasses which he used for watching the birds.

“Oh, yes,” said Frank, “I can see him quite plainly. He is a brown bird,
with a white and yellow breast, all dotted over with small dark spots.”

“He is not such a beautiful bird as the chaffinch,” said Uncle George,
“but he is a much finer singer. Our prettiest birds are by no means our
best songsters. The lark, thrush, linnet, and nightingale are all plain
birds to look at, but they are by far our sweetest singers.”

“Tell us what you see through the glasses, Tom?”

“I can see him nicely,” said Tom. “He holds his head high in the air, as
if he were singing to the sky. His bill is wide open, and the feathers
of his throat are moving rapidly as he sings.”

“I think,” said Uncle George, “that his nest must be near. Let us look
for it.”

Just as Uncle George moved, a brown bird flew out of a low bush close at
hand.

“Ah, ha!” said Uncle George, “I thought we should find it. We have
disturbed the hen bird. She has been sitting on her eggs all the time.”

He moved the branches of the bush gently aside, and the boys saw a large
nest made of dried grass. It was not very high up, and the boys, by
standing on an old tree stump, could look down into it.

“Oh, what pretty eggs,” said Tom. “There are four of them, Uncle George.
They are light blue in colour, and sprinkled with black spots.

                             [Illustration]

  Egg of Song-Thrush.
  Egg of Chaffinch.

“The nest is quite smooth and hard inside. What is that queer brown
stuff all over the inside of the nest?”

“That is clay, Tom. When the thrushes have built their nest, they line
the inside of it with clay. This clay is soft at first, but it soon
dries and turns quite hard.

“But, come, let us go, boys. The cock thrush has stopped his singing. He
and his little wife are flying about in great alarm.”

When they came to the chaffinch’s neat little nest in the fork of the
tree, they got a great surprise. The four little mottled eggs were gone.
In their place were four tiny naked creatures, with little tufts of dark
coloured down upon their heads and necks. They had very large mouths,
and their eyes were closed.

“Oh, what funny little things,” said Frank.

As soon as he spoke, the baby chaffinches stretched out their slender
little necks, opened their wide, gaping mouths, and cried for food.

“_Pink, Pink, Pink!_” came from a neighbouring tree.

“Come down, Frank!” Uncle George whispered. “Let us go back from the
nest, and we will perhaps see the old birds feeding them.”

With another “_Pink, Pink, Pink_,” the cock chaffinch flew down and
stood on the edge of the nest. He had something in his bill. This he
dropped into one of the gaping little mouths, and flew away.

Next came the hen bird with something in her bill. She fed another of
the hungry little birds, and flew away also.

The boys were greatly interested. They wanted to stay the whole
afternoon and watch the chaffinches feeding their young, but their uncle
would not allow this.

“No, no, my dear boys,” he said, “we must not annoy our little feathered
friends too much, or they may forsake their beautiful nest and their
helpless young ones.

“We will come back in a fortnight and see the young birds. You will not
know them then, for they will be fully fledged.”

“What do you mean by ‘fully fledged,’ Uncle George?” Tom asked.

“It means covered all over with feathers, does it not?” said Frank.

Their uncle nodded.

“Are these little birds not cold without feathers?” asked Tom.

“Oh, dear, no,” his uncle answered. “During the day they cuddle up
together in their cosy nest. At night the mother bird folds her wings
over the nest.”

“Where does the cock bird go at night?” asked Tom.

“He sleeps on a branch quite near the nest,” his uncle answered.

                    [Illustration: Rooks and Nest.]

“I have just two more questions to ask, Uncle George,” said Frank. “What
do the chaffinches feed their young ones on? and what becomes of the
young birds after they are fledged?”

“They feed their young chiefly on small worms, flies, grubs, beetles,
and other insects. When the young chaffinches are fledged, their parents
lead them from the nest. They teach them to fly, and show them where to
find their food. They never lose sight of them until they are quite
grown up and able to take care of themselves.”


                       Exercises on Lesson VIII.

  1. Describe and compare the nests of rook, thrush, and chaffinch.
          Where would you look for each?
  2. How does the chaffinch, in building his nest, imitate the colour of
          the tree it is built on. Can you see any special reason for
          this?
  3. Make a list of all the British birds you know. Then divide this
          list into—(1) pretty birds; (2) plain birds; (3) singing
          birds.
  4. Write a description of any bird’s nest you have seen, stating where
          and how it was built, and also what you learned from it.

                    IX.—PLANTS THAT ARM THEMSELVES.


“Some time ago,” said Uncle George, “I promised to tell you something
about how plants arm themselves. And here, in this hedgerow, we have
some good examples of armed plants.”

“There is the stinging nettle,” said Tom, pointing to a large patch at
the roadside.

“The stinging nettle is certainly well protected,” said his uncle. “You
have only to touch any part of it lightly with your hand to find that
out. Every part of the plant is covered with small needle-shaped hairs.
These hairs are hollow and contain a poisonous juice. At the base of
each hair there is a bag filled with this juice, while the tip of each
is sharp and very brittle.

“When your hand touches a nettle—unless you grasp it tightly—the sharp
hair pierces the skin. It’s brittle point breaks off and the poisonous
juice is poured out.”

“Why is the nettle covered with these horrid stings?” asked Frank.

“To save it from being eaten up, of course. The nettle is a tender and
juicy plant, and, if it were not for its stings it would soon disappear
altogether.

“Now, here is another armed plant, the blackberry or bramble. The stem
and also the backs of the leaves are covered with large curved prickles.
These prickles not only protect the plant from grazing animals, but they
help it to climb and scramble up walls and hedges.

“If you try to pull a bramble branch down out of the hawthorn hedge, you
will find it rather difficult, for its large prickles are all turned one
way. They are really sharp hooks.”

“Here is a wild rose bush. It is also covered with large hooked
prickles,” said Frank.

“Yes, Tom, and, like the bramble, it threads its way among stronger and
taller plants.

“The wild gooseberry growing close beside it is also armed with
prickles. But the prickles of the gooseberry are for protecting its
tender leaves. It is not a climbing plant like the rose and bramble. The
raspberry also is covered with many sharp little prickles. There is a
clump of these plants growing at the other side of the road. Let us cut
off a small branch of each of these plants and take them home.”

                     [Illustration: Armed Plants.]

  1. Thistle.
  2. Blackberry.
  3. Whin.
  4. Barberry.
  5. Raspberry.
  6. Sloe.
  7. Buttercup.

“This is the most prickly plant of all,” said Frank, as he halted before
a huge thistle. “You can scarcely touch it without getting severely
pricked.”

“The thistle is well armed,” said Uncle George. “There are sharp
prickles on its leaves, on its stem, and on its flowers.”

As they walked down the road they came upon a mass of whin bushes.

“Here,” said Uncle George, “we have a plant which has turned its leaves
into sharp spines.” He bent down and pulled up a tiny plant which was
growing under the larger gorse bushes. “Look at this little plant, boys.
This is a young whin plant.”

“But it is not a bit like the whin, Uncle George,” said Tom. “Its leaves
are soft and flat. They are more like clover leaves. There are no spines
or prickles on this little plant.”

“That is so, Tom; but still it is a young whin plant.

                      [Illustration: Young Whins.]

“There are a great many of these young whins growing under the older
bushes. Let us take a few of them home. If we grow one of them in a pot,
and supply it with plenty of water, we will find that it will _never_
produce sharp prickles.”

“That is very wonderful,” said Frank.

“It is,” said Uncle George, “and it teaches us something of the whin’s
history. Like the nettle, the whin is a juicy plant, and, if it were not
for its prickles, would be eaten by cows, sheep, and horses. In fact,
some farmers give whins to their horses. Of course the whins are passed
through a mill first. The mill crushes the whins and destroys the
prickles.

“It shows us that many, many years ago the whin was a soft-leaved plant
like the clover. It grew in moist soil. But by and by other plants
invaded the land. These plants grew more quickly than the whin, and
choked it out of the rich moist soil. Forced to grow upon bare
hill-sides and commons, the soft-leaved juicy whin would be destroyed by
grazing animals if it did not arm itself with sharp spines.

“Here is the blackthorn or sloe. It bears many hard, sharp-pointed
spines. Yet, if we grow a sloe plant in the garden, we find that its
sharp spines gradually disappear. They become branches bearing leaves
and flowers.

“But plants have other ways of protecting themselves against animals.
Look through the hedge into the meadow and you will notice that while
the grass has been eaten bare, there are other plants which have been
left to grow up untouched. Buttercups grow up all over the field, and
tall ragwort plants. How is it that the cows do not eat these plants?
They are not armed with spines or prickles.

“They protect themselves in another way. They contain bitter or
poisonous juices. No cow will eat a buttercup. If it did so it would be
ill and uncomfortable for a time.

“I want you to notice, boys, that—with the exception of those plants,
like the bramble and wild rose, which use their prickles for climbing as
well as for protection—all our armed plants grow in exposed places. The
thistle and whin are good examples of this.”


                        Exercises on Lesson IX.

  1. Take in twigs of hawthorn, barberry, holly, bramble, and
          gooseberry. Examine, and sketch them so as to show their
          protective parts.
  2. Grow a small whin bush in a pot and water it daily. Note that the
          _new growth_ it makes is tender, and that _no spines_ are
          produced.
  3. Some plants are covered with dense woolly hairs. These are seldom
          eaten by cattle. Can you explain why?
  4. Make a list of all the armed plants you know, and tell how each is
          protected.




                        X.—THE HORSE POND AGAIN.


Frank and Tom returned from the horse pond one day with their jars
filled with curious creatures.

“We took the water beetle back to the pond, Uncle George,” said Frank,
“and I almost felt sorry to let such a cruel and greedy monster loose
among the other creatures in the pond.”

“You have here creatures even more cruel and greedy than the diving
beetle,” said his uncle, looking into the glass jars which the boys had
brought.

“Here is the larva of the diving beetle, and a fiercer or greedier
creature is not to be found in the whole world.”

Uncle George refilled the three large tanks. He poured the contents of
one of the jars into one of the tanks. It contained, besides the larvæ
he spoke of, a number of tadpoles, some small stickle-backs, and a great
many water snails or whelks.

In addition to these, there were one or two curious insects, with a pair
of very long legs. They came to the surface every now and then, and
moved their long limbs like oars. Whenever the tank was touched, they
would suddenly dive to the bottom. Here they would remain for a short
time, then, returning to the surface, would “oar” themselves along as
usual.

“What are these queer things, Uncle George?” Tom asked. “They look
exactly like little boats.”

“They are beetles,” Uncle George replied, “and they do resemble little
row-boats—so much so that they are called ‘water boatmen.’ This beetle’s
body is shaped like a boat, and he lies on his back and moves his very
long hind legs exactly like oars. He has a large, sharp beak, which you
can see if you look closely.”

Just as Uncle George was speaking, a small fly alighted on the surface
of the water. It was immediately seized by a water boatman, who dived
with it to the bottom of the tank.

                             [Illustration]

  1. Water Boatman.
  2. Water Whelk.
  3. Water Hog Louse.

“That is how the creature feeds,” said Uncle George. “When an unlucky
fly comes near, he seizes it with his two fore pairs of short legs,
drives his cruel beak deep into its body, and dives with it to the
bottom of the pool. When he has drowned his victim, he devours it at
leisure.

“But let us look at the creature I first spoke of—the larva of the
diving beetle.”

There were several in the tank. Uncle George lifted one out with a small
gauze net. He placed it in a saucer of water and asked the boys to
sketch it.

“It has six legs,” said Frank. “Its head is large and flat, and there
are two things like horns sticking out of it.”

“These are the creature’s jaws,” said his uncle.

Uncle George touched the creature’s head with the point of his pencil.
Instantly the long, curved fangs moved apart, and the creature sprang at
the pencil and closed its fangs upon the wood.

                             [Illustration]

  1. Larva of Diving Beetle.
  2, 3. Head, showing how Fangs work.
  4. Larva seizing Tadpole.

“What a fierce creature,” said Tom.

“Yes,” replied his uncle. “We must remove the others from the tank, or
there will be nothing left alive in it. See, one of them has caught a
tadpole already.” And, sure enough, the creature had sunk his cruel
pincers deep into the body of a tadpole. He shook the tadpole as a dog
would shake a rat.

“Those huge fangs are hollow,” Uncle George continued. “With them he
sucks every drop of blood from his victim’s body. In this way he devours
tadpoles, whelks, little fishes, and even his own weaker brethren.

“We shall have to put these larvæ in a tank by themselves, and feed them
upon pieces of fresh raw meat, to keep them from devouring one another.

“Now, boys, I am going to describe this larva. Look closely, and see if
I am right. You can correct your drawings as we go along.

“His body, which is nearly two inches long, is narrow at each end and
broad at the middle. It is divided into twelve segments, and to each of
the first three of these segments a pair of legs are attached. His
large, flat head is almost heart-shaped. At its broad end are a pair of
large, beady eyes, three pairs of organs which look like feelers, and
the two large, curved fangs with which he seizes his prey.

“Notice how beautifully the legs are adapted for swimming. They are
edged with long, stiff hairs, which stand out flat with every down
stroke, but fold in when the legs move upwards. That is how the creature
is such a graceful swimmer.

“The last three segments of his body are thickly covered with long
hairs. His tail is divided into two long plumes. You can see what these
are for, I hope.”

“Oh yes,” said Frank. “Like the parent beetle, the larva comes often to
the surface and hangs downwards with his tail exposed to the air. So
these plumes must be his breathing organs.”

“And do these long, slender creatures actually become broad, stout
beetles like the one we returned to the pond to-day?” Tom asked.

“Yes, Tom, they do. Just as your green caterpillar became a beautiful
white butterfly. These larvæ hatched out of eggs which were laid by the
female beetle in the stem of some water weed. She first cuts a slit in
the water weed, and then places an egg in the slit.

“When the larvæ are full grown, they crawl out of the pond and bury
themselves in ground. Here they pass the winter in the pupa stage. They
come out in spring, fully-formed beetles, and pass the remainder of
their lives in the water.”

“What are these curious creatures that crawl among the water weeds?”
Frank asked. “They are very like the ‘slaters’ which we find among old
wood-work in the garden.”

“That creature is the ‘water hog.’ Its proper name is _Asellus_, and it
is very closely related to the garden ‘slater’ or wood-louse.

“These water hogs, like the whelks, are very useful in an aquarium. They
eat up all waste matter, and so help greatly to keep the water fresh.

“By the by, I want you to watch the whelks from day to day. They usually
lay their eggs in a clear, broad band on the inside of the glass tank;
and with our lenses we can watch the changes in these eggs nicely.”


                         Exercises on Lesson X.

  1. Procure some “water boatmen” from the nearest pond (see Appendix),
          feed them upon flies, and watch their habits. Notice
          particularly their method of swimming and of feeding.
  2. We should not keep all our pond animals in one tank. Can you
          explain (giving examples) why this is?
  3. Write the life-history of the diving beetle.
  4. Make large sketches of the diving beetle and its larva. Compare
          them.

                               XI.—WASPS.


The wasp’s nest was found at the edge of the wood, hanging from the
branch of a small tree. It was greyish white in colour, shaped like a
pear, and about the size of a hen’s egg.

                             [Illustration]

  Queen Wasp.
  Worker Wasp.
  Queen Bee.
  Worker Bee.

Uncle George removed it from the branch and carried it home carefully,
for it was very light and very fragile. He took a pair of scissors and
cut through the thin walls so as to remove nearly half of the coverings.
When he had finished cutting, two thin, papery shells fell upon the
table, one a size smaller than the other.

“Examine the stuff the wasp’s nest is made of, and tell me what it is
most like, boys,” he said.

“It is more like paper than anything else,” said Tom.

“It _is_ paper,” said his uncle.

“Where did the wasps find this paper?” Frank asked.

“Not ‘_wasps_,’ Frank, but _wasp_,” his uncle answered, “for this nest
was all built by _one_ wasp. The insect did not find the paper. She made
it. It was the wasp who first taught man to make paper.

“The queen wasp awakens from her winter sleep in spring, and at once
sets about making her nest. She gathers tiny fragments of wood and bark,
chews them up, and mixes them with a fluid from her mouth. This, when it
hardens, is paper.

“First she makes a stiff rod, or pillar, of paper. This hangs down from
the branch and forms the centre of the nest. Round this are built the
walls of her house.

“Observe, boys, that there are two distinct walls of paper, one inside
the other; and there is a wide air space between them all the way round.
The entrance to the nest is at the bottom. Round the centre pillar there
is a little thing shaped like an opened umbrella. If you look underneath
this, you will see something curious, I think.”

“Oh,” said Frank, “it is divided into six cells, and in each cell there
is a small, stout maggot or grub. I can see them moving.”

“These are the young wasps,” said Uncle George. “Like your butterflies
and caddis flies, the wasp passes through egg, larva (or caterpillar),
and pupa stage before it becomes a perfect insect. These are in the
larva stage but, unlike your caterpillars, they have no legs, and they
cannot feed themselves.”

“Then the mother wasp must have laid an egg in each cell,” said Frank,
“and these grubs hatched out of them.”

“That is so,” said Uncle George. “You see what a clever and industrious
creature a wasp is. To build this beautiful nest all alone and unaided,
and to rear and feed her helpless grubs, is a task indeed.”

“What are the wasp grubs fed on?” asked Frank.

“At first,” said Uncle George, “they are fed on animal food, and this
keeps the queen wasp hunting insects all day long. As they grow older,
they are fed upon honey.

                             [Illustration]

  Same Nest in Autumn.
    A. Combs of cells.
    B. Supporting pillars.
    C. Entrance.
    DD. Inner and Outer walls.
    E. Air space.

“The wasps which come from these first eggs are ‘worker’ wasps. As soon
as they are hatched out, they begin to enlarge the nest. This they do by
removing the inside wall and building a new and larger outer wall. This
is done from time to time, until at last the nest becomes as big as an
ordinary-sized turnip. While this is going on, more and more cells are
being built inside, until at last five or six large combs of cells fill
the inside of the nest. The queen wasp lays an egg in each cell as it is
formed; and the worker wasps gather food and nurse the young grubs until
they become perfect wasps.

“By and by some young queens, or female wasps, are hatched out. These
lay eggs, and soon the population the paper nest numbers many
thousands.”

“And that is why the gardener kills every wasp he sees in spring time,”
said Frank.

“Every wasp we see in spring,” said Uncle George, “is a queen wasp. If
allowed to live, each queen would become the founder of a nest and the
mother of thousands of wasps.”

“But why destroy the wasps?” asked Tom.

“Because wasps are very destructive and dangerous insects,” said Uncle
George. “They destroy our best fruit, and their sting is poisonous,
sometimes causing death.”

            [Illustration: Wasp’s Nest inside Wren’s Nest.]

During the summer the boys found several wasp’s nests. One was built
under-ground at the roadside. Another was built inside a wren’s nest.
The queen wasp who built it had driven the wrens out. A third nest hung
from the branch of a gooseberry bush in the garden.

                 [Illustration: Humble Bees and Nest.]

The latter was watched by Uncle George and the boys as it grew larger
and larger. Soon, however, the wasps became too numerous. One day they
chased Tom and Frank out of the garden and stung them badly. Then Uncle
George removed the nest. Putting on his bee-veil and gloves, he cut off
the branch from which the nest hung. He put nest and branch inside a
large box; and, having placed a saucer containing burning sulphur inside
the box, he closed the lid.

                   [Illustration: Nest of Tree Wasp.]

In the morning the wasps were all dead, and the boys examined the huge
nest. Thus they were able to see queens, workers, and male wasps, eggs,
larvæ, and pupæ, and to make drawings of each.

“What becomes of the wasps in winter?” Frank asked his uncle.

“They come to a sad end, Frank,” said Uncle George. “They do not store
food like the hive bee, and so, when the cold weather comes, they starve
to death.

                             [Illustration]

  Queen Humble Bee.
  Worker Humble Bee.

“Our good-humoured and hard-working friend, the humble bee, shares the
same fate. A few young queens leave the nest before winter comes on.
These bury themselves in mossy banks and sleep the winter through.”


                        Exercises on Lesson XI.

  1. Look under low branches of larch and spruce trees in spring for the
          nest of the wasp. Make a drawing of it. Cut it open and
          examine the interior.
  2. Compare a piece of the wall of the nest with the torn edge of (1) a
          piece of coarse brown paper and (2) a piece of ordinary
          newspaper.
  3. Write out the life-history of a wasp.
  4. Compare the combs of the hive bee with those of the wasp. Notice
          that the former are placed vertically in the nest, the latter
          horizontally. Observe how the wasp’s combs are kept apart.




                          XII.—THE DANDELION.


Uncle George and the boys were having a stroll along a lane where briar
and hawthorn and all sorts of wild flowers grew. Although it was an
October day the sun was shining brightly, and all along the wayside the
golden flowers of the dandelion opened wide to the sunlight.

“I thought that the dandelion was an early summer flower,” said Frank.

“So it is,” said his uncle; “but this year the autumn has been so warm
that our dandelions are flowering a second time. This often happens with
many of our wild flowers during an extra mild season.

“You ought to dig up one of these dandelion plants, take it home and
grow it in a pot. It is a most interesting plant to observe, especially
the growth and ripening of its seeds. I see here dandelion flowers in
almost every stage of their growth.

“If you look you will find among the wide open flower-heads many others
which are closed. Let us split a few of these down the centre, and we
will find that they are not all alike.

“Here is one with a bright yellow tip. This one has not yet opened. If
you use your lens you will notice that, like the daisy, this is not a
single flower, but is made up of a great many small yellow florets.
These florets stand upon a flat round disc, and they are surrounded by
two rings of green things called bracts. One set of these bracts stands
up straight. These protect the florets. They open and close the flower.
The down pointing bracts protect the flower from ants and crawling
insects.

                       [Illustration: Dandelion.]

“Now, Frank, look at the split flower and tell me what you see with your
glass.”

“The florets are all of one kind,” said Frank. “They are all strap
shaped, and there are a great many of them. The younger florets are in
the middle.”

“If you were to pull the florets out and count them you would find about
three hundred of them in a single flower-head,” said Uncle George.

                             [Illustration]

  1. Dandelion Flower-head not yet opened.
  2. Single Floret of same.
  3, 4, 5. Flower-head closed for Seed ripening.
  6. Second time of opening.

“Now, take one single floret and examine it, please. It is very like the
outer (white) florets of the daisy. But it is more complete. There is a
large seed-vessel at the bottom. Just above this there are a great
number of long silky hairs. You will see what these are for by and by.
The lower part of the floret is tubular, but it opens up into a long
yellow strap-shaped petal. There are really five petals all joined
together here.”

“Oh yes,” said Frank, “at the top of the floret I can see five distinct
teeth, and five ridges run down from them. I also see the barrel-shaped
ring of stamens.”

“Let us gather some more of the closed flowers,” said Uncle George.

“Here are two other closed flowers. One of them has a yellow tip,
withered and faded almost to brown. The other has a white woolly tip.”

“Have these not opened yet?” Tom asked.

“Oh yes! they have opened and closed up again. The dandelion opens out
to the sun so that flying insects may visit it and carry pollen from
flower to flower. When it has received, in this way, enough pollen to
enable its seeds to form, it closes up completely and remains closed
until its seeds are ripened. During this time the short stalk between
the seed-vessel and petal part grows long. If you look again at a single
floret you will see that this short stout stack bears the long straight
hairs I spoke of. The flower-head closes so tightly that the yellow
strap-shaped petal parts of the florets are squeezed together into a
bunch. They soon wither. Meantime all the hair-tipped seed-stalks are
growing longer and longer. At last they push the bunch of withered
petals right out of the flower and it falls off.”

Uncle George then gathered a few more closed heads, and, by cutting them
open, showed the boys all the stages in the growth of the seeds.

“When the dandelion flower-head opens for the last time, instead of a
flat golden mass of florets, this is what appears.” As he spoke, Uncle
George pointed to a dandelion head which was one huge fluffy ball of
stalked seeds.

Frank held it up and blew his breath upon it. Immediately all the seeds
went sailing through the air.

“Why does the flower-head keep closed when the seeds are ripening?”
asked Tom.

“Because,” answered Uncle George, “not only has the seed to ripen, but a
plumed stalk has to be formed by means of which the seed is carried away
from the parent plant. These plumes have to be perfectly dry or they
would be of no use as sails to the seed. Notice that it is only on dry
days that these ‘clocks’ of the dandelion appear.”

“But, Uncle George,” said Frank, “are these seeds actually fitted with
feathery tops so that they may be carried far away from the parent
plant?”

“Certainly, my boy. You would not have them all trying to grow in the
place where the parent plant grows, would you? There would be no room
for three hundred seeds to grow there. Besides that, the parent plant
has already exhausted the soil. It is necessary that they should seek
pastures new, and therefore the seeds of most plants are furnished with
some means of travelling.”

“Are all seeds carried by the wind?” Tom asked.

“Oh dear no,” Uncle George replied, “plants have many ways of scattering
their seeds. Some plants, by suddenly bursting their seed-vessels, shoot
their seeds far out; some seeds are furnished with little hooks which
grip on to the fur of passing animals; some are carried by birds; but by
far the greater number are scattered by the wind.

“We shall learn more about these at some future time. Meantime we will
grow a dandelion plant at home, and watch the opening and closing of its
flowers, and the wonderful way in which its travelling seeds are
produced.”


                        Exercises on Lesson XII.

  1. Gather dandelion flowers at different stages of growth. Draw, on a
          large scale, a single floret from each,
  2. Draw a leaf of the dandelion. Compare it with a primrose leaf. See
          if you can make out, from the shape of the leaf, why the plant
          is called “dandelion” (_dent de lion_ = “lion’s tooth”).
  3. Take in a dandelion plant bearing young flowers. Keep the root in
          well-watered soil, or in water only, and watch the growth of
          its flowers.
  4. Make a list of all the wind-carried seeds you know, and give a
          drawing or short description of each.

                              XIII.—TROUT.


One day in November the postman brought Uncle George a small wooden box.
There were holes bored in the sides and top of it. The box, when opened,
seemed to be filled with damp moss; but when some of this moss was
removed there was found in the middle of the box a piece of folded
muslin.

                             [Illustration]

  Hatching Bottle.
    A. Supply pipe.
    B. Exhaust pipe.
    C. Trout Eggs.
  Rearing Box.
    C. Perforated zinc tray to fit box.

Uncle George laid the muslin on the table, and opened it out. It
contained a number of tiny pink balls, much smaller than peas.

“These are the trout eggs you promised to get for us, are they not?”
said Frank.

“They are,” said Uncle George, “and we must put them into running water
at once. I have a bottle here ready for them.”

Uncle George filled a wide-mouthed bottle with water from the tap and
placed the eggs in it. He then corked it with a cork in which he had
bored two holes.

Into each of the holes he had fitted a tube. One tube was long enough to
reach almost to the bottom of the bottle. The other was bent over the
outside of the bottle.

The straight tube was connected with the water tap by a piece of
indiarubber tubing. He then turned the tap on gently, so that the water
went in by the straight tube and came dripping out by the bent tube.

“Trout require a constant supply of fresh water,” he said. “Their eggs
are usually laid in shallow streams.

“Now, boys, I want you to watch these eggs and note down any changes you
see in them. You can remove the bottle from the tap at any time, but you
must not keep it more than fifteen minutes at a time, or your trout will
not hatch.”

At the end of a week the boys noticed two black dots and a coiled white
line in each egg.

In two weeks more some curious-looking creatures were seen wriggling
about among the eggs. As there were some empty egg-skins to be seen,
they guessed that these lively creatures must be young trout.

They were not a bit like fish. Each seemed to be made up of a long white
streak, which looked like the “backbone” of a fish, a big, clumsy yellow
bag with red veins running through it, and two large black spots that
looked like eyes.

In a few days all the eggs hatched out, and in place of the little pink
eggs there was a crowd of these wriggling creatures and a number of
empty egg-skins. The boys were puzzled, and Uncle George had to be
consulted.

          [Illustration: Six Stages in Development of Trout.]

“I don’t think these were trout eggs,” said Frank. “The creatures that
came out of them are not a bit like fishes. They swim on their sides and
have a huge yellow bag attached to their bodies.”

“They _are_ young trout, I can assure you, Frank,” said his uncle
laughing. “If you remember, your tadpoles were not a bit like frogs when
they hatched out of the egg. These huge bags you talk of are called
‘yolks.’ Each trout when hatched is furnished with a huge yolk or food
supply.

“The tadpole, when hatched, has also got a yolk upon which he lives
without eating for four or five days. Our trout will require no food for
six weeks. During that time the yolk will become smaller and smaller,
and at last disappear entirely. While the yolk is shrinking, you will
notice that the creature gradually assumes the form of a fish.”

Uncle George emptied the bottle containing the young trout into a wooden
box which he had made. This box was fifteen inches long, four inches
broad, and four inches deep. The inside of it he had charred with a
red-hot iron after it was put together. It was placed under the tap, and
the water dripped into it all day and all night.

Frank made a small gauze net about the size of a dessert-spoon, and with
this they lifted troutlets out of the box whenever they wanted to
examine them.

As their uncle had said, the creatures changed from day to day. By
placing a single trout in a white saucer, the boys could note these
changes; but they were such lively little creatures that making good
sketches of them was somewhat difficult.

First the big black dots became more like eyes. Then delicate fins and
tail appeared, and mouths which opened and shut. At the top of the
yolk-sac, just under the head, the boys could see a little red thing
like a heart beating constantly. As the yolk-sac grew smaller, the
little fish’s body grew more shapely, and tiny brown spots appeared all
over it.

At last, at the end of six weeks, the yolk was completely gone, and the
young trout were now beautiful little fish, shaped and coloured exactly
like big trout.

Then Uncle George began to feed them. They were fed four times a day on
the yolk of an egg which had been boiled for half an hour. A very small
quantity of this hard yolk was squeezed through a piece of gauze into
the water, and the little fishes dashed at it and gobbled it up
greedily.

They were so rapid in their movements, swimming about and leaping out of
the water, that the boys were never tired of watching them.

“What are the brown spots on a trout for?” Frank asked his uncle one
day.

“The trout is protected by his colour,” said Uncle George. “Each trout
is coloured like the bed of the stream he lives in, and the spots
resemble grains of sand and tiny pebbles. The trout can change his
colour, like the frog, as I will show you.”

Uncle George took two trout out of the box and placed them in a glass
dish. He placed the dish in a white saucer, and so arranged it that
water was kept flowing into and out of it.

Next day he took two more trout out of the box and placed them in the
glass dish. It was then seen that the first two trout had grown quite
light in colour. They were much paler than those taken out of the box,
the inside of which was charred and black.

One day Uncle George found two of the trout dead in the box.

“I am afraid, boys,” he said, “that we cannot keep them confined any
longer. Get a large pail full of water, and we will carry them to the
brook.”

“We must come here and fish next year, Frank,” said Tom, after the trout
were transferred to the brook. “How long will it be before they become
big trout, Uncle George?”

“They are now about an inch long,” said Uncle George. “In a year they
will be four inches long. In about three years, if they are not devoured
by larger trout, they will weigh about a pound apiece.”

“I think it is a shame to kill such pretty little creatures,” said
Frank.

“I quite agree with you, Frank,” said his uncle.


                       Exercises on Lesson XIII.

  1. Compare a newly-hatched trout with a seed (bean). How do they
          resemble, and how do they differ from one another?
  2. The trout is protected by its colour markings. Make a list of any
          other animals you know that are “colour protected.”
  3. If you put a fish (trout) into water which has been boiled and
          allowed to cool, it dies. What are your reasons for this?
  4. Make notes, with sketches, of the development of a young trout from
          the time it is hatched until it requires food.




                            XIV.—SILKWORMS.


The silkworm eggs came in a very small box. They were sent by a friend
of Uncle George’s who lived in the south of England. The eggs were stuck
to pieces of paper in scattered groups. Some pieces of paper had only
one or two eggs on them, others had as many as forty. They were small,
round things, flattened on the top, and coloured light green. They
reminded the boys of small mustard seeds, but they were not so round.

In answer to Frank’s question as to why the eggs were laid in irregular
groups, Uncle George answered:

“When the silk-moth emerges from her pupa case, she lays her eggs
anywhere on the floor of her cage. As the eggs are coated with a gluey
material when newly laid, they stick firmly to the floor.

“Those people who rear silkworms always have a sheet of clean paper
covering the floor of the cage before egg-laying commences. After the
eggs are laid, they are found adhering to this sheet of paper. The paper
is taken out of the larva cage, and those parts containing eggs are cut
out with scissors.”

“How many eggs are laid by one moth,” Frank asked.

“From four to five hundred,” his uncle replied. “Let us get our larva
cage cleaned out, and we will put these eggs in the lower part of it and
await their hatching.”

“Why in the _lower_ part,” Frank asked, as he set about cleaning the
cage.

“Because its floor is a drawer which can be pulled out. If you put them
in the upper part, you must lay a sheet of paper on the floor first, for
your silkworms must not be handled on any account.”

“And how long do we have to wait for these eggs to hatch?” asked Tom.

                      [Illustration: Larva Case.]

“That depends altogether upon the amount of warmth they receive, Tom.
They will remain unhatched ever so long if kept in a cool place; but
whenever they are placed where they can get the necessary amount of
warmth, they begin to hatch. Let us put them in the front window, where
they can get most sunshine.”

About a week after the larva cage was placed in the window, Frank
reported to his uncle that some of the eggs had turned white.

“Take your lens and examine carefully those eggs which have lost their
colour,” said Uncle George.

Lifting out one of the small pieces of paper with eggs on it, Frank
examined it with the glass.

“Oh,” he said, “these colourless eggs are just empty shells, and there
are two small creatures crawling along the edge of the paper. How small
they are! They are no longer than the breadth of a pin-head. They are
almost black in colour, covered all over with hair, and have very large
heads.”

“Well, these are newly-hatched silkworms,” said Uncle George, “and they
are already looking for food. Run out to the garden and bring in some
fresh lettuce leaves.”

Uncle George carefully dried the lettuce leaves before putting them into
the cage. In two days all the eggs were hatched, and in their place were
as many black, hairy, crawling little creatures with clumsy heads.
Although they did not seem to eat much, they grew very rapidly. When
three days old, they were fully twice as big as when hatched.

In five days the silkworms seemed to have increased in number as well as
in size. In fact, there seemed to be twice as many grubs as there were
of eggs.

Then Uncle George explained that half of these were not grubs, but
simply empty skins.

“The silkworm, in order to grow, must cast its skin,” he said. “It does
this four times during its lifetime. Look out for another _moult_, or
skin-casting, in four days’ time.”

Four days later the grubs cast their skins again, just as Uncle George
had said. They were now about half an inch in length, and much lighter
in colour.

In six further days they moulted a third time. Instead of dingy, hairy
grubs, they were now hairless caterpillars, yellowish-white in colour,
and with round black heads. Their fourth and last moult took place in
another week. By this time they were over an inch in length. They now
began to eat the lettuce leaves ravenously, and grew very fast. For ten
days they ate much and grew rapidly. Then they seemed to get tired of
feeding, and began to crawl lazily up the sides of their cage.

                       [Illustration: Silk Moth.]

  1. Eggs.
  2. Larva.
  3. Silk Cocoon.
  4. Chrysalis.

“They are full grown now, boys,” said Uncle George, “and will soon begin
to spin their silken cocoons.

“They are now about three inches long, and very different from the tiny
hairy grubs which came out of the eggs over a month ago.”

“We have been comparing drawings of them with drawings we made of the
caterpillar of the white cabbage butterfly,” said Frank, “and we find
that they are very much alike.”

“That is good,” said Uncle George. “They are, indeed, very much alike.
The body is made up of thirteen segments, and they have the same number
of legs. They differ from the cabbage caterpillar, however, in size and
colour. Notice the little horn which sticks up out of the twelfth
segment. Your cabbage caterpillar did not have that. If you look closely
you will notice a long silk thread issuing from the head of one of these
silk-spinning caterpillars. This one has just begun to make his cocoon;
and, in order to prevent his threads becoming entangled with those of
the other caterpillars, I will place this small paper cone over him.”

Next day Uncle George covered several of the caterpillars with paper
cones. On the roof of the cage the boys saw one caterpillar surrounded
with a flimsy web of silk of a golden-yellow colour. As they watched the
creature turning its head round and round inside the silky veil, their
uncle told them that the creature was spinning silk at the rate of about
a foot per minute.

In three days each caterpillar had surrounded itself with a dense silken
cocoon as large as a walnut. Then Uncle George took one of the cocoons,
and, cutting it open, showed the boys the brown, shining chrysalis
inside. He took another cocoon, and, having dipped it into warm water,
began to wind the silken thread on to a piece of card.

Both Frank and Tom were amazed at the length of this silken thread. They
were more surprised when they were told that each caterpillar produces a
silk thread more than half a mile long.

“Tell us, please, Uncle George,” said Frank, “why the creature spins all
this silk, and how it makes it?”

“You are asking a difficult question,” said his uncle, “but I will tell
you something about it.

                             [Illustration]

  S. Silk Fibres.
  W. Wool.
  C. Cotton.
    (All highly magnified.)

“The creature spins this cocoon to protect its chrysalis, of course. The
silk is produced in two long, coiled tubes, which occupy nearly the
whole length of the creature’s body.

“Silk, before it issues from the caterpillar’s body, is a fluid.
Whenever it comes out into the air, it becomes horny. Two strands are
produced at once—one from each of the long coiled tubes. Before they
leave the caterpillar’s body they are pressed together to form one flat,
ribbon-like thread. Silk is one of the strongest fibres in the world. It
is nearly as strong as steel, and much stronger than many of our metals.

“In a fortnight your silken cocoons will produce white, fluffy moths.
‘Then you can supply your friends with hundreds of ‘silkworm’ eggs, and
still have enough over to stock your larva cage.”

              [Illustration: Silk Moths—Male and Female.]


                        Exercises on Lesson XIV.

  1. Are “silkworms” really worms? What creatures do they most resemble?
  2. Many of our common caterpillars spin silk of a kind. Take in
          “woolly bear” caterpillars. Feed them on the plants you find
          them on. Compare the cocoons they make with those of the
          “silkworm.”
  3. Compare egg, larva, pupa, and perfect insect of the “silkworm” with
          that of the white cabbage butterfly. Does the caterpillar of
          the latter spin any silk?
  4. Make a list of all the spinning insects you know, and try to
          explain the use of the “silk” thread in each case.




                               APPENDIX.
                           HINTS TO TEACHERS.


STRUCTURE OF STEMS.—One- and two-year-old twigs of horse-chestnut, elm,
and willow should be cut into half-inch lengths and distributed among
the class. If cut straight across with a sharp pen-knife, the different
layers can be seen with the naked eye. Afterwards these pieces should be
slit longitudinally, and the various tissues _peeled off_ by the pupils.

BULBS AND CORMS.—Bulbs of snowdrop and tulip, and corms of crocus, can
be bought from seedsmen, from September to January, at from 6d. to 1s.
per 100. At any other season of the year the onion will make a good
substitute.

WILLOW TWIGS will root readily if placed in water and kept near the hot
pipes in school.

VEGETABLE FINGERS.—To illustrate this lesson, peas (of any kind) ought
to be grown in school. Branches of the many wild peas and vetches are to
be found in abundance in every hedgerow during spring, summer, and
autumn. Branches of Virginia creeper, clematis, tropæolum (Indian cress)
may be shown with advantage. The compound leaves of the rose, ash, or
mountain ash should be shown along with those of sweet-pea and edible
pea, and the amount of green (assimilating) area compared.

THE GREAT WATER BEETLE is found in nearly every pond. One or two should
be kept and fed upon small worms. These beetles can also be obtained
from any naturalist dealer. The larvæ of this beetle is found in ponds
in summer months.

“WATER BOATMAN” BEETLES (_notonecta_ and _corrixa_) are common to all
our ponds.

PLANT ARMOUR.—Branches of whin, bramble, hawthorn, and barberry, and
leaves of holly, thistle, and nettle will be found to illustrate this
lesson. Young whin plants are to be found plentifully in spring, growing
under the old bushes. One of these should be grown in a pot in school
and kept well watered. It will produce _no_ prickles.

TROUT EGGS are obtainable from any of the fisheries—_e.g._, Howietoun
Fisheries, Stirling, or Solway Fisheries, Dumfries, at about 1s. per
100, from October till April. They are easily hatched and reared
wherever running water can be obtained. If not hatched in a bottle, as
described in Lesson XIII., the ova ought to be placed in a shallow
trough of perforated zinc suspended in a small wooden box. The inside of
the box must be charred with a red-hot iron to prevent fungal growths.
When the yolk-sac is completely absorbed, the young trout should be fed
on yolk of hard-boiled egg, and, later on, on a mixture of this and
chopped raw beef. In each case the food should be squeezed through
perforated zinc.

“SILKWORMS.”—Eggs of the silk-bearing moth (_Bombex Mori_) can be had
from Messrs Watkins & Doncaster, 36 Strand, London, and other dealers,
at 4d. and 6d. per 100. The larva should be fed on mulberry or lettuce
leaves, and the leaves should never be given _wet_.

Caterpillars of Tiger Moth (_Arctia caja_), Emperor Moth (_Saturnia
carpini_), or Puss Moth (_Cerura vinula_) should be kept for comparison.

the cheerful cricket had been running around anxiously in the grass all the morning mrs cricky carried her head down and when she ran she scuttled and when she stopped she was absolutely still except for her eyes which she turned about brightly in every direction mrs cricky was looking for food for chee chirk and chirp usually mr cricky brought home the food but he was a member of the marsh grass vesper quartettemade up of himself miss k t did mr frisky frog and mr tree toad todson first cousin to toadie todsonand they had all been out very late the night before so mrs cricky didnt wish to disturb him at last mrs cricky found what she wanted and home she came chirp and chee and chirk were fed and then it was time to begin school mrs cricky always taught her own children she had rented three little toadstools not any bigger than tacks from toadie todson and these the children used for desks she often said that she thought roundtop desks better than flat for then the children were not so likely to lean their elbows on them school began promptly as the sun rose nine oclock would have seemed a lazy hour to the little cricketses the principal study mrs cricky taught was cheerfulness much the same as you are taught reading and writing she said that the whole duty of a cricket was to be cheerful after this she gave them some lessons in fear these lessons were something like the things your mother tells you such as dont go near the water fire burns dont put beans in your ears look before you leap only mrs cricky told chirp and chee and chirk never to go near one of old stingys spiderwebs and when they saw a giant coming with a fish pole in his hand to hop away as fast as they could then too she said there was a fourfooted animal called a cat that caught little crickets to eat them up after this they all chirruped together as she waved a blade of grass to keep time then she rang a bluebell and school was over she put three little cloverleaf sunbonnets on them and sent them out into the sun to play now chirp and chee and chirk were like other little boys and girls who do not learn their lessons very well and chee was careless about listening to his lessons in fear they went right out with their three little cloverleaf sunbonnets on and down to the edge of the lake chee climbed way up to the top end of a large blade of grass and was balancing there much as you like to on a springboard when accidentally he fell into the lake chirp and chirk ran to and fro frightened to death calling for help but nobody heard them in the meantime chee was kicking in the water and making a great fuss when a big oak leaf floated by and chee scrambled on if however the leaf had not come at just that moment chee would have drowned when the leaf floated in shore they all went home and told mother cricky she stopped chirruping for quite a long time and didnt say anything at all when mrs cricky began to chirrup again she said it served them just right and she hoped it had taught them all a lesson then they all chirruped together because chee was safe and mrs cricky said now let us all sing a little song to show that we are happy and this is the song they sang  jump jump  rather fast  jump jump everywhere  how we like the summer air  chirp chirp chirp in tune  on the grass beneath the moon the slothful toad his real name was toadie todson crawled out of his hole and looked about he saw a bee near by buzzing busily over a rich large clover blossom and a sturdy ant dragging a white parcel marked food toward a round sandy house and a cheery little cricket marching rapidly up a green stalk in search of a dinner for three hungry little cricketses it was a busy time for all except toadie todson the spring had just come that much toadie todson knew and all these neighbors were busy putting their houses in order well the bee was stocking his honeycomb house the ant was putting her summer pantry into order and filling it with cookies cream cheese cake and honey that her majesty the queen bee sent over every day and the cricket although his house was out of doors under a big green oak leaf that had dropped to the ground was busy piling up all the food he could find for mrs cricky to guard while she nursed the three little cricketses toadie todson was tired to see so much going on he wished they would all be quiet and stop hurrying around he drew a long sigh which made him swell up and look rounder and fatter than ever why couldnt his neighbors feed as he did he just sat there and opened his big red slit of a mouth gave a lazy snap and a noisy fly still buzzing was swallowed up he moved a little further away from his hole dragging one fat squashy leg after the other then down he squatted again a little ball of green inchworm dropped off the bush on to toadie todsons back and began to measure its length over toadies big warts and veins it made him feel very important to have an inchworm all to himself to tickle his back as important as an egyptian queen with a slave to tickle the sole of her foot all the hot afternoon long toadie todson swelled with pride as the green inchworm went measuring up and down up and down his back the busy bee just then flew buzzing by and buzzed to toadie as he went theres a sandslide rolling down this way im getting outs fast as i can when the bee said sandslide it sounded just like szszszzzzzide toadie todson opened his fat eyes and dropped his mouth in an ugly laugh it made him sick to see any one in such a hurry then the honest ant went scurrying past and very kindly gave him the same message but toadie only sneered the more he had been living in this very spot for years almost as many as you have lived and nothing had ever happened to him no he would stay right there it was too much trouble to move for anybody the green inchworm was very green and went on measuring toadie todsons back for it didnt understand a word the bee and ant had said suddenly gravel gravel gravel slip slip slipand toadie todson was under mountains of sand with a great big rock square on his back the green inchworm began to bore its way out of the sand it could hear toadie todson groaning and saying o o i wish id never been so lazy i might have lived an been as happy and rich as the bee or the ant o o and the green inchworm knew that toadie todson was dead not more than six hours after this mrs cricky overheard the green inchworm practising a tune it pleased her so much that she tried to sing it again to father cricky for the marsh grass vesper quartette of course it was all about toadie todson and this was it  a lament  very slowly  mournful mournful notes  in our little throats we sing  flowers flowers dead  for our toadies head we bring all the little green inchworms and the energetic thin roadworms called him glummie for short although his whole name was longinus rotundus caterpillar thats a very long hard name and they couldnt be bothered with a name like that for such a sulky fellow as he and for fear i shall take too long telling my story about him we also will call him not longinus rotundus caterpillar but glummie glummie was born into a most talented and attractive familythat means a family that could do many things very well and was pretty to look at but from the time he went out to eat his own leaves he was sullen nobody knew exactly what was the matter it is true his sisters were prettier than he for they had long yellow hair that waved all over a silky green body and they had dark yellowbrown eyes but a boy should not mind having his sisters prettier than he and he had an older brother they all called squirm he was very much liked he was browner and larger than glummie and he was always doing nice things for his brother and glummie shouldnt have been jealous but however all that might be this day glummie was sulking away in the grass and making himself generally disliked two katydids had said a pleasant goodmorning to him and almost jumped out of their green coats when he snapped out it aint mrs cricky in passing by chirped pleasantly and glummie glowered so out of his great fierce redbrown eyes at her that she hurried on in terror of her life there was only one thing snappier than he on the grass by the lake shore that morning and that was the snapping turtle presently a locust came along and turned on his buzzing hum right in glummies ear then glummie was furious raised his head and struck at the locust now the locust was a tease and this pleased him immensely so he cracked his wings right in the very face of glummie and began to sing  the firefly song  not too fast  dancing dancing  fireflies dancing  flash your wings  froggie sings  dance my little wings dance glummie fairly raged till the hairs all over his fat body stood up straight and his long stiff whiskersand he had whiskers on both his head and his tailfairly bristled he grumbled out that he didnt see why he couldnt live in peace in the grass that all he wanted was to be let alone then he said he knew how he could get away from the society of worms and crickets and katydids he hated and all the deafening noises they made to drive him crazy thereupon with a sulky twist of his head he crawled toward the road he had just crawled into the first wheelrut when a big jouncing yellow kentucky cart came by and made an end of longinus rotundus caterpillar mrs cricky said the moral of his end was very plain to her she told all the little cricketses that you couldnt expect to speak sullenly to people and have them like you and that you couldnt expect to live away from the society of other people without having something killed in you mrs cricky called it love and then perhaps a little inconsistently ask your mother what that means she added she for one was glad glummie was dead greenie toadie todsons green inchworm was measuring his way carefully around a birch tree since toadie todsons death he
 spent a large part of every day looking at trees and measuring distances so that stingy could spin his webs in the best manner possible all the rainbow qualities of web were spun on white birch trees greenie was humming over mournfully to himself the song which mr tree toad todson had composed in memory of his cousin toadie todsona lament greenie sang the words over and over again and seemed as his voice grew more and more mournful to be happier and still happier that is often the way with melancholy people greenie felt he had good reason to be unhappy not so long ago his first cousin longinus rotundus caterpillar or by his more familiar name glummie had been killed then his master toadie todson with whom he at least had a lazy time was killed in a sand slide and now he spent all his days at work for stingy who was a very exacting master if he so much as stopped to nibble a little from a tender green birch leaf stingy would fly at him and bid him go to work at once but one day greenie discovered something about him which he intended to use to good advantage stingy was in love every day at certain hours stingy went quietly off and one day greenie followed him there down in the meadow under a big apple tree he found stingy together with five other spiders they were arranged in a row before silken web more often called silkie whom they were courting and silkie was waiting ready to accept the spider who did best out danced the first spider the shining hairs all over his body glistened in the sun now he seemed silver now jet black now crimson as he whirled jumping lightly into the air silkie looked for a second and then turned her head away it was plain she would have none of him off dejectedly crawled the first spider greenie watched fascinated by this bright colored little spectacle under the blossoming apple tree then his eyes grew dark and angry he had to work when he was hungry he had not had a single holiday for over a month he had been spoken to crossly his family tree had been scoffed at hewell he had had enough of this the last fine cobweb stingy spun it was greenies business to fold and put away carefully in the centre of a buttercup he would get it and be back before it was time for stingy to dance he measured his way quickly over to the buttercup his little back fairly popped into the air every other half second as he went furiously humping himself along he found the cobweb covered with the gold dust of the buttercup and taking it up hastily he hurried back he knew just the spot where stingy would dance before silkie beside a tall piece of timothy grass the fifth spider was finishing his dance as greenie reached the bottom of the timothy grass stalk out came stingy with a fierce and selfconfident air which plainly said all the other five have failed now i am about to succeed he looked at silkie then began to dance first he whirled round madly and so swift and light was he that he seemed to have wings his broad back and thin tufted legs shone with dusky golden colors after whirling around he hopped several times lightly into the air in the meantime greenie climbed the stalk and was waiting stingy was just about to do a sidewayshop when over him fell inches and inches of his own gold dusted cobweb down he tumbled his legs all tangled up in the web fiercely he fought to get out while off scuttled the other spiders leaving him to his fate for a minute the little green hairs on greenies back stuck up straight with merriment then complacently he measured his way home to his own family tree mrs cricky as she passed him heard him muttering its a long worm that has no turning a very long worm that has no turning well said mrs cricky that may be true but it is none of a crickets business it is just as well not to take part in other peoples quarrels your father says the cricket rule is the best precept for living he has ever known and your father children is a very wise cricket i dare say greenie has had a hard time but then lazy worms often do now let us sing a little song about these flowers weve been hopping about in its pleasanter chirp dont sing too loud chirk not too fast and chee dont mumble your words  golden flowers  fast  everywhere you go  you see them dancing  flowers dancing  in the sunlight  nodding heads are shining  like the dewdrops  sparkling dewdrops  shining gayly old stingy sat in the midst of his spiderweb as some old giant used to sit in his fortress waiting to pounce upon innocent people to kill them and eat them stingys shoulders were all humped up and his eight claws looked very ugly he had already tangled up one noisy fly and now he sat waiting for another everybody hated him even toadie todson went out of his way to give a lazy snap at stingy all day long stingy spun webs caught noisy flies and even other spiders and yet nobody ever knew what he did with his webs or with the flies he caught stingy had never been heard to say one word and when he wanted exercise he hung by his leg to a thin cobweb and dangled up and down but if he saw anything coming he gave a jump and back he went again into his web there he would sit with his shoulders humped and his big mean black eyes fairly popping out of his head for once in his life stingy was feeling a little sleepy the evening that something happened to him all day long the wind had been blowing very hard and stingy had to rebuild a great many cobwebs that were blown down suddenly he started up something was struggling in his web what do you suppose it was nothing less than a beautiful little yellowwinged moth that was caught and was beating his wings and fluttering to get out stingy rose slowly and moved his humpy shoulders toward the moth quietly he stole on and in a minute more the moth would be choked to death on on went stingy the tiny yellow moth fluttering more and more feebly but just at the moment stingy was almost on the moth a beak ripped open the web and stingy went tumbling to the ground while the yellow moth fluttered away toward the waxy white flowers of the nearest syringa bush the moth had time to see hummy go whirring off and that night she told the fireflies and glowworms and other moths all about it and each one had some other good deed of hummys to relate but perhaps you would like to know what became of stingy when the web was broken and he tumbled to the ground he fell into the open mouth of the frisky frog who gave a comfortable croak as he swallowed him nobody was sorry that stingy was swallowed mrs cricky said it served him right but then poor mrs crickys good wishes were often lost in anxiety lest harm should come to one of her own little cricketses for stingy fifteen days before had been known to smother and eat a little cricket not more than a minute old mrs cricky herself would probably have been the last person to hurt stingy only she could not help feeling relieved she said it wasnt in cricketnature to feel otherwise father cricky was usually too busy singing songs for the marsh grass vesper quartette to make remarks but this time he agreed with mrs cricky and said they would all better have their evening song and go to sleep and this was the song they sang  lullabye  not too fast  come see where the night winds sleep  and the dews fall on the ground  while the trees arustling keep  and the stars turn round and round  there little frogs leap and croak  and little eels slip and slide  and the crabs lie still and soak  while the marsh is singing wide  the sand hills sleep neath the moon  and blink away at the sea  while they sing a little sand tune  which is plain as plain can be  lullabye  sleep away  say my little one  byebye to the day it was toward evening and the marsh grass vesper quartette was seated at the edge of shiner pond the quartette always gathered here about dusk upon a broad flat toadstool which grew at the foot of a spreading oak mr tree toad todson had leased this toadstool for the summer season from his first cousin the unfortunate toadie todson from pieces of straw he had built up to the edge of it a short flight of steps so that miss k t did their first soprano found it easy to mount to the platform tonight was a special evening and the attendance was large out on the pond the snapping turtles were moving swiftly from one log to another bearing upon their backs groups of fireflies the fireflies were there in numbers this night because one of the selections on the program was a firefly dance composed by mr frisky frog and to be danced by miss k t did the other members of the quartette were to sing the song while miss katy danced it spoiled the effect somewhat to lose her clear high soprano but mr tree toad todson filled in with his penetrating tenor and it was rumored that the composition would be a great success as nearly as i can remember it this was the program for that evening  sixth annual inseason out of door concert  of  the marsh grass vesper quartette  june the twentysixth  nineteenhundredandsix  shiner pond pavilion  members  miss k t did soprano  mr tree toad todson tenor  mr cricky baritone  mr frisky frog 3d

mr cricky  sung by miss k t did  vii theres dreamland coming  the quartette  assisted by miss glo worm and mr fiah fli jr it would be impossible to give the whole program without taking you right into the concert the lullabye mrs frisky frog sang together with mr t toad todson and sang very beautifully she had sung it a great many times to her own little children while they were still pollywogs
 only when she sang it to them she altered the chorus mrs frisky frog changed the chorus for her little ones because she knew well enough that her pollywogs never slept at night at least i never saw any asleep at night of all those who swarm in black clumps there on the edge of shiners pond in the moonlight but i have not told you yet how mrs frisky frog sang the chorus  wiggle wog  woggle wig  sing my pollywog  a tune to every jig once while they were practising the lullabye at rehearsal mrs frisky frog forgot and through force of habit sang the chorus she had made up for her own little pollywoggles but dear me mr t toad todson flew into a towering rage and croaked at her till he was fairly hoarse nonsense nonsense nonsense he jerked out and when finally he could control himself he spluttered aloud that he had never in his life written such nonsense you remember it was he who composed the song poor mrs frisky frogs eyes rolled back a little further than usual and her throat jumped up and down with fear it did not do to speak crossly to mrs frisky she was so tenderhearted and was never known to speak a cross word to her own little ones or for that matter to any one mrs cricky one day while she was talking with mrs poe tatobug said that she knew of only one model mother in the community and that was the admirable mother of those ugly little pollywogs here mrs cricky heaved a proud sigh as she thought of her own little darlings chee and chirk and chirp decked out in their pretty little clover sunbonnets but to go back to mrs frisky frog mr frisky frog who was a member of the quartette became so angry with mr t toad todson for the angry croaking at his wife that his eyes fairly glowered at him mrs cricky always called that kind of anger in mr cricky righteous indignation peace was soon restored however as mr tree toad todson very much of a gentleman at heart was most anxious to ask pardon for this display of temper but we have spent too much time in discussing the lullabye and the trouble it brought mrs frisky the concert began a warm night was vigorously applauded and the firefly dance was the success of the evening miss k t did had bought at a most extravagant price from stingy one fourth of an inch of his best rainbowhue cobweb this made for her a beautiful scarf which she waved over the light of the glowworms that had been arranged in a wide circle on the broad flat toadstool around in and out now over now under her scarf three fireflies sped with burning wings and miss katy never danced better flashing her cobweb scarf in and out the glowworm circle as with lightsome foot and wing she danced round and round mrs cricky said she did wish the little ones had been allowed to come usually it did not seem right for children to stay up late at night but this night she did believe it would have added to their education to see such skill especially as chee was a little inclined to toe in and be clumsy you remember chee stumbled and fell into the lake all of the evening was successful and the applause at the close of the concert as they responded to an encore with the mosquito aria was wonderful there were no clapping hands but rather the beating of wings the enthusiastic croaking from various kinds of little red throats and the flashflash of lights from the fireflies and glowworms mr cricky in writing it up for the june bug journal pronounced it the success of the season we will close with a few stanzas of theres dreamland coming probably you have heard it for it has a way of singing itself the moment you are off to sleep try sleeping and see if it is not heard  theres dreamland coming  adaptation from eugene cowles forgotten  moderately slowly  theres dreamland coming dearie  and dreaming coming too  sweet dreamland for the weary  to cradle such as you  then close your eyes my darling  and say your little prayer  dreamland is waiting for you  and god will take you there  theres dreamland coming dearie  and dreaming coming too  sweet dreamland for the weary  to cradle such as you mrs cricky came out of her house with an angry flounce what in the world was all this noise about zzz zzz then a thump and a bump and the strangest little noises more like a falsetto squeak than anything else this had been going on for the last minute which is a whole hour for a cricket and going on while she was trying to teach chee and chirk and chirp their lessons in running and humming these two things unlike other people they always did at the same time mrs cricky came out with an angry little flounce as i said onto the piazza of grass cottage she had been fearfully disturbed but the instant she saw the noisy fly she broke into chirping merriment the noisy fly had evidently been to last evenings concert and was trying to imitate miss k t did in the firefly dance he was whisking around at a great rate his long legs looking very spindly under his fat black body but what amused mrs cricky most was the way in trying to do the wing step his legs got tangled up for all the world as if they were on sticky fly paper of course he fell over and that accounted for the bumping and the buzzing but each time he got up and went at it again as if nothing had happened singing in his high falsetto voice the tune miss gloworm had sung which was a little moonbeam songto find out what a moonbeam song is you must look long at the sky  moonbeam song  not too fast  moonbeams weave  about this place  fairies leave no fairy trace  weave him in  and weave him out  spin it thin  and round about  dingdong dingdong ding  see our spell  can hold him fast  tinkle bell  the hour is past it was not very polite for mrs cricky to laugh but really she could not help it never did she see such a buzzing clumsy attempt at imitation as this by this time the noisy fly had spied mrs cricky and his popping black eyes scanned her anxiously for he was accustomed to be driven off wherever he went mrs cricky remembered the interrupted lessons and spoke severely to him well noisy here again you are always disturbing somebody you are just like some other folks who never know when they are not wanted noisy people are always a nuisance you are about before respectable crickets have a chance to go to sleep buzz buzz buzz so that there is no sleeping after that your noisy wings are worse than toadie todsons heavy feet when he used to come hopping onto the piazza after the folks were asleep and what is more youre not much cleaner by this time mrs cricky had worked herself into a state of righteous indignation and concluded all she had to say with a sharp be off off went noisy in a great flurry and skurry he fairly dropped from the roof of the piazza where he had been hanging upside down in his haste to let go and get away when mrs cricky went back into the school room she found that chirp had upset his brown grasshopper writing ink all over the floor and was wiping it up with his little wing and smearing it onto chee now this ink was expensive and could be bought only from the grasshopper who manufactured it himself she looked at chirp just one second and told him to bring the timothy grass rod hanging in the corner chirp knew what that meant but he took his punishment bravely when mrs cricky had finished she dropped the rod on the floor with a sigh and gathered chirp into her wings o chirpie chirpie why will you be such a naughty little cricket and make me punish you then mother cricky gave them a little talk about noisy and told them there were two things they must always remember to be clean and quiet when it was proper to be quiet after this she gave them some red clover honey and sent them out to play dizzy batted up against the window striking his head and wings with a hard rattle mother moth like a good mother had told dizzy time and time again never to fly toward a light dizzy had already had some experience with odd lights hung up on poles among the oaktrees these lights had hoods over them hard and white dizzy often wondered why the white hoods were not as soft as the oakbuds notwithstanding the fact that his mother as often explained both to him and his little sister flutter that electric lights were not oakbuds poor dizzy there is no use in preaching up up through the oaktree he flew now tumbling against a branch now untangling himself from a sticky new bud up up dizzy sped toward a square white glare of light little flutters yellow wings trembled with fear as she saw her brother start upward she told him in a faint voice that window panes were very dangerous mother moth had cautioned them both about window panes dizzy stumbled onto the sill with a sickening thud scattering the diamond dust from his suncolored pearl wings into a fine glittering mist upon the green paint ugh with a jar up flew the window and dizzy thinking faintly about little flutter cuddled among the clover blossoms was swept into the room and its blinding light the soft warm fragrance of the night air reminded him of the cozy little place on the grass at the foot of the hillthe little birchleaf home mother moth flutter and father buzz were all down there now and listening perhaps to the cobweb symphony played by the marsh grass vesper quartette and this too was the evening when the june bug was to sing the june bug wing solo composed by himself dizzy had heard his father practising the accompaniment and the melody and words kept running through dizzys head somewhat like this  the june bug wing solo  moderately fast  crack crack my brittle wing  is all i ever sing  tho ive almost always said  when ive struck my little head  that im angry with a buzz buzz buzz  crack crack my brittle wing  be careful how you fling  where the dusty little toad  is still sitting on the road  waiting for you with a gulp gulp gulp how distinctly dizzy could still hear father buzz linger over the last line with so much feeling and with what terror he thought of all the dangers that might befall him round and round the room dizzy flew scattering silver hairs from his lacy wings each moment his head growing heavier for an instant there was a tiny flash of light and the faint noise of a shrivelling wing half of dizzys wing had been burned off what would flutter think now of the blackened silver wing of her brother down went dizzy his good wing beating helplessly upon the window sill flutter and mother moth were in his mind the cool air blew in through the shutter which a few minutes before had closed upon him but wonderful providence a big white hand opened the shutter and gently brushed out dizzy he had learned his lesson and mother moth did not speak one reproachful word as with dragging wing he hobbled into the little birchleaf home father buzz however was heard singing in an undertone these words to one of the melodies in the cobweb symphony  singed wings  teach many things antywhen she was godmother to any of the little ones her full name was given as anty hillwell to go on anty was in a great hurry she often preached against hurry but she found that there was really so much worth while doing in life and that life was so short she had to hurry once in a while to get it all done this particular morning there was more than ever to do first she had milked the cows you would call them little white bugs but they were really cows which she drove into a tiny pen there sitting on a milking stool sandy ant had whittled out of a bit of straw for her she milked as fast as she could make her hands go after that she went bustling into the house and taking the silkie tassel from a piece of timothy grass she swept the house out till it was as clean and fresh as a may morning she was very happy it was her nephew sandy ants birthday and he was coming of age for he was just twentyone hours old she still had his cake to bake and candles to make from the waxy bayberries that grew near the shore and last but not least his presents to arrange sandy had always been a very good boy and so today everybody had remembered him and wished him well but what excited anty hill more than anything else was that the king and queen for the ant state was a monarchy had sent a special messenger to say that they would honor them with their royal presence on this occasion anty hill had been a hard working honest ant all her life and she felt that this honor was a reward for all that she had done to bring sandy up as a good and honest citizen of the kingdom she bustled about busily and every time sandy came in the house she shooed him out and told him to go take care of the horses and cows by and by she called him in and bade him put on his best clothes she didnt tell him that the king and queen were coming for sandy was a bashful boy and she was afraid this would frighten him now the king and queen had heard reports far and wide of the honesty and goodness of anty hill and her nephew sandy if there were any ants sick in the kingdom anty hill and sandy did something to help them all this pleased the king and queen very much and they made up their minds to do something for anty and sandy the other guests had come and it was time for the king and queen at last their coach drew up in front of the door it was a beautiful shiny green beetle shell drawn by two gnats two little liveried green midges tumbled off the coachbox opened the coachdoor and the king and queen stepped out while the guests bowed low to the ground as they passed up the entrance to the house where anty and sandy were waiting anty hill bowed low to the king and kissed the queens hand while sandy bowed very low to both then the king called all the guests about him and made a little speech he said he always liked to reward kindness and honesty and that anty hill and her nephew sandy had been as kind and honest as any two people in his kingdom after this the king drew out his sword which was a fine blade of sharp grass and telling sandy to kneel down he said i dub thee knight of the red hill this was a great honor and ever afterward sandy served the king and anty hill who became lady hill lived with him at the court that night mrs cricky told all the little cricketses she hoped they would remember sandys honor and that if they helped other people they too might be honored some day chee and chirk and chirp looked much awed and waved their little pink clover sunbonnets helplessly in the air till father cricky said he did wish they would stop it kept him from seeing the music he was studying for the marsh grass vesper quartette what is it father called chee who was always curious its a cantata said mr cricky chee nudged chirk and whispered say whats that o i dont know said chirk lets ask him to sing it then well find out all right you do said chee father cricky was very glad to sing it and this was the song he sang  treetop cantata  moderately fast  swing tree top swing  this morning bright  swing gold and green  in gay sunlight  swing treetop swing  swing tree top swing  in night time too  theres shining stars  and falling dew  swing treetop swing the walking stick was soberly walking down the path looking spindly in every way long thin legs and a long thin body that were for all the world like a stick probably you have seen the walking stick many times and thought him just a twig if you hadnt been in such a hurry you might have seen something interesting each time he picked up a leg he seemed to wave it in the air before he put it down again that was i suppose because he had to each leg was so very long the walking stick had been given the name of the parson by some naughty little crickets for no other reason i am sure than that he was so exceedingly grave chee and chirk and chirp were the naughty crickets who gave him the name and although mrs cricky said it was unkind yet other people took it up now chee and chirk were waiting for the parson when they saw him come out of grass cottage where he had been visiting mrs cricky ssh said chee dont make so much noise hell hear us there chirk take that blade of grass and stretch it across the path hell never see it they say hes always thinking about things that folks dont think about at all say said chirk tugging at the blade of grass if i wind it around this buttercup stalk will that do yes replied chee here he comes oh i wish chirp was here along came the parson gravely swinging one leg after the other in the air and thinking with much pleasure of the kindliness of mrs cricky who was always a very cordial hostess ssh whispered chirk hes thinking of miss k t did they say but the sentence was never finished for with a sprawl the parson stumbled over the blade of grass and came down on the other side with a clatter teehee teehee teehee chirruped both chee and chirk so amused at the funny tangle of legs in which the walking stick was that they forgot to run away now the parsons long legs made great strides and before they knew what had happened chee was being soundly beaten whack whack whack went the walking stick on his little shiny black back o o o cried chee ill never do it again no said the parson in a high thin voice i think you wont you black imp by this time mrs cricky had come out to see what all the noise was about when she heard the explanation she said in a sorrowful tone chee and chirk is this the way ive brought you up when your father hears of this he will be very angry come into the house with me at once and into grass cottage they were marched when they were inside grass cottage mrs cricky said in a sad way that the worst thing anybody could do in his own house was to be inhospitable to strangers that they had been rude to mr walking stick upon their own grounds then mrs cricky went on to say that she feared they would never grow up to be gentle crickets if this was the way they intended to behave both chee and chirk were too unhappy for words and said they would never do it again and that really they did not want to hurt anybodys feelings well said mrs cricky i dont see how you could forget so soon after that song your father taught you we will sing it together again and perhaps you will remember next time and this was the song they sang  the cricket rule  rather slow  chirp for chirp is all our song  cheerful chirps  will help a long  do not say  what will not cheer  try to soothe  each tiny fear  chirp for chirp is all our song  cheerful chirps  will help a long well said mrs poe tatobug its a pity such things have to go on what those horrid black roadworms mean by eating up all the apple leaves is more than i can see lady bug listened to this outburst quietly as if she had been accustomed to such words from her kinswoman finally she said really i cant see that they do any more harm than crack crack crack spluttered mrs poe tatobug forgetting entirely the dignity of a hyphenated name hum why there wont be a single leaf on a single apple tree left to shade me and my family by time july comes hum indeed yes my dear said lady bug who was always reasonable as well as gentle i understand all you say but you know yourself that we eat leaves huh sniffed mrs poe tatobug i cant see that its the same thing at all what goods a leaf to a potato now just tell me that i only know this replied lady bug last year mrs cricket overheard farmer hayseed say that if he could get rid of the poe tatobug family hed live twenty years longer he said we ate up the leaves and made the roots good for nothing i presume he meant our family for a quiet body you can say the meanest things exclaimed mrs poe tatobug just then mrs cricket head down went hurrying by and said as she passed youd better go home farmer hayseed is pouring white stuff all over your houses most of your folks have left but i saw little poe and tato still there dear me o o they both cried those children will be choked to death
 no two mothers could have hurried home faster lady bug tried to give a little comfort on the way i think said she that rose bug will help the children for all she lives in such a beautiful new home rose is so fond of poe and tato and then too bush manor is not so far away not one word did mrs poe tatobug say but flying and jumping she hurried home her red speckled wings kept cracking louder and louder as she hurried along faster and faster i wish you would not hurry so fast said lady bug gently really i am quite out of breath and see there is farmer hayseed way up at the other end of the patch he hasnt reached our home yet mrs poe tatobug looked eagerly and sure enough there was farmer hayseed with a big box marked paris green in one hand and in the other a sieve through which he was sifting fine white powder dear me sighed mrs poe tatobug this is such a relief here we are at once she began scurrying around over every leaf of her home but not a sign of little poe and tato could she find gracious said lady bug how very unfortunate where do you suppose they are i dont suppose but i guess i know replied mrs poe tatobug as off she scurried toward the rose bush in the old fashioned garden near by and as they hurried toward the bush they could see rose bug with her wings around little poe and tato she was singing a lullabye trying to keep them quiet or put them to sleep and this was the lullabye she sang  lullabye lake  quietly  lullabye lake  is a place i know  where the tree tops sing  and the breezes blow  where the treetops sing  and the breezes blow  the moon shines dim  with a silver light  and the ripples dance  and the stars are bright  and the ripples dance  and the stars are bright  the glow worm burns  on the misted green  and scatters his lights  for the faery queen  and scatters his lights  for the faery queen mrs poe tatobug listened carefully to the song at last she exclaimed that rose bug always did sing strange songs i hope my children will not remember any such unpractical nonsense the poetato family never was given to notions what in the world can she mean by the faery queen i dare say some romantic tale the clover blossoms grew heavier every day with honey and their great red heads bobbed about clumsily in the little breezes that visited the grass by the lake shore squirm glummies caterpillar brother had been heard to say that it was so sweet about those clover blossoms that he could scarcely crawl by them it made him faint but every morning just as the sun got up hummy came whirring along singing so busily and sweetly that even toadie todson stuck his head out of his mudhole to listen and the frisky frog on the waters edge stopped croaking hummy came for a very simple reason and that was to get his breakfast his luncheon and dinner he always took from the honeysuckle vines and the rose bushes that grew on the side of the giants house he preferred his breakfast however from the clover for he said that the dew on them was fresher than on the blossoms up by the big house it made hummys beak feel cool and fresh for all the world like a morning bath in the clear fresh dew all the time hummy sang away and made everybody within hearing distance happy because of his tunefulness and he waved his wings about so prettily that it made you feel good to see them they were such little rainbows of color every morning when hummy came round just as the sun got up mrs cricky called all her children to the door and told them that it was as good as going to school for them to watch the manners of such a perfect gentleman as master hummy she said she wished them always to remember that to be so beautifully clean and so very cheerful as master hummy would make up for a multitude of other sins then as hummy flew past their door all the little cricketses and mrs cricky too gave a hop and a cheerful chirrup as a good morning to him and at every place that hummy went that day he made a sweet sound and everybody felt happier because he had been there hummy did a great many things besides making others happier with his tunefulness he pulled a young hopper out of a mud puddle into which he had hopped by accident he turned over a beetle that got stranded on its back and everything he did was so pleasant and full of song that it was a pleasure to have him do things for you anty hill said she did wish sandy could learn to sing that way it did make one feel so much happier when there was somebody around who was always merry and in such a good temper about helping people she said she didnt see how ma squiters family had lived they were so nagged with her ugly buzz and her bad temper late that same night anty hill overheard sandy trying to sing a song the frisky frog had taught him sandys voice was very poor and this is the song he sang in a most mournful way the frog song rather slowly come froggie sing your evening song  the summers short and winters long come sing away now that the day has faded quite into the night




Before Penelope could toddle she lived far away among the oleanders. The
sunbeams who came down to see the oleanders saw Penelope too. She sat on
the grass and played with them, and they loved her very much.

One day the sunbeams were sad.

"Penelope is going to England," they said to each other.

"I am going to England with her," said Sunbeam the First.

"How?" asked the others.

"I shall hide in her hair," said Sunbeam the First.

"Then," said Sunbeam the Second, "I shall go too. I shall hide behind
her eyelashes."

"And I," said Sunbeam the Third, "shall hide in her heart."

So Penelope went to England, with one sunbeam in her hair, and one in
her eyes, and one in her heart.

When she was old enough to talk she spoke to the sunbeams.

"Shall you always stay in my hair?" she asked Sunbeam the First.

"That is more than I can say," he answered. "Perhaps when you are old I
shall be obliged to go away."

Then Penelope asked Sunbeam the Second--

"Shall you always stay in my eyes?"

"I hope so," said Sunbeam the Second; "but perhaps if you are unhappy I
shall be obliged to go away."

Then the corners of Penelope's mouth began to droop a little.

"Dear Sunbeam," she said to Sunbeam the Third, "shall you be always in
my heart?"

"Yes, if you keep me there," said Sunbeam the Third.

"How can I keep you there?" asked Penelope.

"You must love the fairies," said the sunbeam, "and understand them when
they speak to you. If you love the fairies even when you are old, I
shall stay in your heart always."

       *       *       *       *       *

These stories have been written for Penelope, so that she may love the
fairies, and keep the sunbeam always in her heart.

Little Agatha lived in the days when castles were as common in the land
as cottages are now, and when there were plenty of magicians always
ready to help people out of difficulties.

One of the castles was Agatha's home. It stood on a hill and was
surrounded by a dark wood. Agatha was a lonely little girl: she had no
sisters or brothers to play with. She used to stand at the narrow window
in the castle tower and look out into the wood, and long to run about
with other little girls. If you had seen her you would have thought her
a very funny figure in her long gown reaching nearly to the ground, and
a close cap over her curls.

In the evening Agatha could see very little when she stood at the
window, but still she stood there and looked at the dark wood. It was
then that the nightingale, the Bird of Shadows, sang to her; and this
was what she liked better than anything else. She thought the
nightingale's voice was lovely to hear, and she wondered why it was so
sad.

Evening after evening the lonely little girl looked out through the
tower window listening to the nightingale, till she felt that he was her
friend. Sometimes she spoke to him.

"How much I should like to fly out of the window and be a nightingale
too!" she said. "Then we would play together in the wood, and I should
have a voice like yours--ever so sweet and ever so sad."

Sometimes she tried to sing, but she found her voice was not in the
least like the nightingale's.

Every day she became more anxious to be a nightingale, until at last she
thought about it always, and yet seemed no nearer to her wish. She hoped
sometimes that her curls might turn into feathers; but after several
weeks of wishing she saw that the curls were still made of yellow hair.
She began to be afraid she would never be anything but a little girl.

One day she heard some of the maids talking together. They were speaking
of the Wise Man, the Magician, who lived in the dark cave on the side of
the hill, and could do the most wonderful things. In fact, they said,
there was hardly anything he couldn't do; you had only to tell him what
you wanted most and he could manage it for you.

"Perhaps he could turn me into a nightingale," thought Agatha. "I'll go
and ask him, anyway."

So while the maids were still talking she slipped out of the castle, and
through the wood, and down the hill, till she came to the dark cave. Her
long frock caught on the brambles as she went, and her hands were a good
deal scratched, and once she tripped and fell. But of course she did not
mind anything of that kind, because she was thinking all the time about
the nightingale.

Agatha walked into the cave without knocking, and found the Magician at
home. I dare say you know that all good Magicians have kind faces and
long white beards. This one was a good Magician, so he had a kind face
and a long white beard. Agatha was not in the least afraid of him. She
told him at once why she had come.

"Please," she said, "I want to be a nightingale."

"A nightingale, my dear?" said the Wise Man. "That is a very strange
thing for you to want to be! Don't you know that the nightingale is the
Bird of Shadows, who sings by night and is very sad?"

"I shouldn't mind that a bit," said Agatha, "if I could only fly about
and sing with a beautiful voice."

"Well, then," said the Wise Man, "if you don't mind being sad, this is
what you must do. Every day you must come here to see me, and each time
you must bring me one of the pearls from your necklace."

Agatha clasped her hands tightly round her neck, as if to save her
pearls. She wore them in a chain, and the chain was so long that it
passed twice round her neck and then fell in a loop that reached nearly
to her waist.

"Oh, must it be my pearls?" she asked eagerly. "Would nothing else do
instead? I have some very nice things at home--really nice things. I
have some lovely toys, and a gold chain, and a pony, and--oh, lots of
things. Wouldn't you like some of those?"

"No," said the Wise Man, "I must have the pearls if you want to fly
about and sing with a beautiful voice. Nothing else will do. For every
pearl you bring me I will give you a feather from the nightingale, the
Bird of Shadows."

Agatha went home slowly, still clasping her pearls tightly in her hands.
She liked them better than anything she had. She liked to watch the soft
lights and shades on them, and to think of the wonderful sea they came
from. She did not feel sure that it was worth while to give them up,
even for the sake of being a bird and learning to sing.

But in the evening, when she stood by the tower window as usual, and
listened to the nightingale, she had no longer any doubts as to what she
should do. To be able to sing like the nightingale was more important
than anything else, she felt. And besides, if she were going to be
turned into a bird, the pearls would not be of much use to her in any
case. She was pretty sure that nightingales never wore pearl necklaces.

The next day she slipped one of the pearls off her chain, and then she
ran out of the castle and through the wood and down the hill, till she
came to the dark cave.

The Wise man smiled when he saw her.

"Here is----" she began, and then she could say no more, because of the
lump in her throat.

The Wise Man looked rather sorry for her, but he took the pearl without
speaking. Then he gave her the feather he had promised her, and she went
away again. As she climbed the hill and ran back through the wood to the
castle, she tried to feel glad that she had the feather instead of the
pearl.

For a long, long time the same thing happened every day. Every day
Agatha slipped a pearl off her chain, and then ran out of the castle and
through the wood and down the hill, till she came to the dark cave; and
every day she brought home a little feather instead of her pearl.

The long loop of the chain grew shorter and shorter. The time came when
it was not a long loop at all, but fitted closely round Agatha's neck
as the other loops did. By-and-by the time came when the chain would
only pass twice round her throat; then the time came when it would only
go round her throat once; then it grew too short to reach round her
throat at all, and she was obliged to turn it into a bracelet. Then it
became too short for her wrist, and she made it into a ring. And all the
time her store of feathers was growing larger and larger, till it seemed
to her that there were enough to make at least ten nightingales; but
this was because she did not know how many feathers a nightingale likes
to have. When there were only two pearls left, the Wise Man said to
her--

"When you bring me the last pearl you must bring me the feathers too;
and after that you will be able to sing with a beautiful voice and to
fly wherever you like."

So when Agatha left the gloomy old castle for the last time she was not
able to run through the wood, because she was carrying a big bag of
feathers as well as the pearl.

She was feeling very much excited when she gave the bag of feathers to
the Wise Man.

He put the last pearl carefully away with the others; and then he took
the bag of feathers and emptied it over Agatha's head. As he did so he
said some of the strange long words that Wise Men use.

And then----

Agatha was there no longer. There was nothing to be seen of her except a
little heap of yellow curls, which the Wise Man kept to give to the next
person who asked him for gold.

But out of the cave there flew a happy bird. It flew far, far up into
the sky, singing with a beautiful voice. It flew higher up into the sky
than any nightingale ever flew.

For the Wise Man had done more than he had promised. The bird's
beautiful voice was not the voice of the nightingale, the Bird of
Shadows; but the voice of the lark, the Sun-Bird, who is never sad.





The sea-fairy's name was Laughing Sapphire, and he lived in a
nautilus-shell: the land-fairy was called Sweet-of-the-Mountain, and his
home was a tuft of heather. One day Sweet-of-the-Mountain went for a
stroll on the sea-shore, and there he met Laughing Sapphire, just at the
edge of the ripples. It was then that the quarrel began.

"I am really sorry for you," said the sea-fairy. "It must be very
unpleasant to live up on that cliff. It is so dangerous too. You might
be blown down at any moment!"

"Ha-ha, how very amusing!" laughed the land-fairy. "Unpleasant, did you
say? Dangerous? Not at all, not at all. Now, _your_ life is something
too horrible to think of. I am glad it is not my fate to wander for ever
on the sea. And as for danger--well, every one knows that the sea is
full of dangers."

"I never heard such nonsense," said Laughing Sapphire indignantly. "The
sea is perfectly safe if you know how to manage your shell."

"But think of the discomfort of it," said Sweet-of-the-Mountain. "You
never have any peace."

"And _you_ never have any change," answered Laughing Sapphire.

"There's not much change in always looking at the sea--a great dull
stretch of water!"

"Dull!" cried Laughing Sapphire angrily. "Dull, did you say? Not half so
dull as being mewed up on a rock!"

"Why," said Sweet-of-the-Mountain, "you've no flowers, and no bees, and
no----"

"And you," interrupted Laughing Sapphire, "have no glittering spray, and
no forests of seaweed, and no creamy foam."

"You've no heather," said the land-fairy, as if that settled the matter.

"As for you," cried the sea-fairy, "I can't think of anything you _have_
got! So there!"

They went on quarrelling in this way for some time, getting more and
more angry. At last they agreed upon a very good way of settling the
dispute. And this was their plan. Each of them was to go away for a
certain length of time. On a particular day they were to meet again on
the shore, at the edge of the ripples. Laughing Sapphire was to bring
with him three treasures of the sea; and Sweet-of-the-Mountain was to
bring three treasures of the land. The fairy whose treasures were the
best would be the winner in the quarrel.

"But who will decide which are the best treasures?" asked the
land-fairy.

"My friend the sea-anemone lives near here," said Laughing Sapphire. "As
he is partly on land and partly in the sea, he will be able to judge
fairly between us. He shall decide."



Then the sea-fairy sailed away in his nautilus-shell, and the land-fairy
flew home to the heather on the cliff.

Hardly had Laughing Sapphire left the shore when he saw a huge curling
wave rolling towards him. The hollow of the wave was like a great green
cavern, lit up with magic light; the top of it was sparkling spray. A
sunbeam was shining straight down through the spray, and gleaming with
every colour you can think of, so that it seemed as if a piece of
rainbow had fallen from the sky.

The fairy laughed happily, and steered right into the hollow of the
wave, for he knew that his nautilus-boat was safe. In his hand was a
little shell. As his boat rode smoothly over the crest of the wave and
through the rainbow, he held out the little shell in the beam of
coloured light. There was a wonderful change in the shell after it had
passed through the rainbow; it was lined with mother-o'-pearl!

The fairy laughed again for joy when he saw the rainbow colours of the
little shell.

"They've nothing like that on shore!" he said.

Then the nautilus-boat sailed on and on across the sea.

The next thing that Laughing Sapphire found was a glowing piece of red
seaweed. As he pulled it, dripping, out of the sea, it looked like a bit
of broad crimson ribbon; except that no ribbon ever had so much colour
and so much light in it. It was so transparent that you could see the
sunlight through it, and yet it was as strong as a rope.

As the fairy coiled it round and round he smiled.

"That should please them, I think," he muttered.

The third thing that Laughing Sapphire found was the best of all. To
find it he was obliged to leave his nautilus-boat and dive down to the
bottom of the sea. I must not tell you now of all the wonders he saw
there, for it would take me too long, and it would be very difficult for
me to stop. But when he came to the surface again he was clasping a
splendid pearl tightly in his hand.

"If this doesn't persuade them," he said, chuckling, "that the sea is
the best place in the world, _nothing_ will!"

Meanwhile the land-fairy had been busy too.

First he flew to a beautiful garden, full of roses and verbena and
everything sweet. It was a garden he often visited, for many of the
flower-fairies there were friends of his. So he knew exactly where to
find the sweetest lilies. There were great clumps of them--tall, white
lilies with drooping heads and hearts of gold. Sweet-of-the-Mountain
crept into one of them, and came out with a big, heavy drop of honey.
The scent of it was so strong that all the fairies in the garden sniffed
joyfully. Then Sweet-of-the-Mountain flew over the wall, and away and
away till he came to a wood.

In the wood there was perfect silence. If you had walked there your
footsteps would have made no sound, for the ground was soft and springy
with moss. There was moss everywhere: moss on the tree-stems and on the
stones, and carpets and cushions of moss on the ground. The fairy picked
a piece of it--a piece like a soft green feather--and flew off with it
out of the wood.

Then he went back to his own hills, where the heather grew right up to
the edge of the cliff; for he knew that the best thing of all was to be
found there. He saw the hills far away, purple and blue, with here and
there a streak of crimson where the sun was shining on the heather. As
he came nearer and nearer he grew happier and happier, for a fairy is
always happiest in his own country. He picked a sprig from his own tuft
of heather; and then he flew down to the shore to meet the sea-fairy at
the edge of the ripples.

He found the nautilus-boat lying on the sand, and Laughing Sapphire
sitting on a rock talking to the sea-anemone. The fairies nodded to each
other.

"This," said Laughing Sapphire to the sea-anemone, "is the fairy I was
speaking of. He declares that it is better to live on land than on the
sea. Of course I know better than that! So we have each brought three
treasures to show you, that you may decide which of us is right."

The sea-anemone answered in a very sleepy, drawling voice: for when you
spend all your life fastened to the same rock your mind moves rather
slowly.

"Very well," he said, "go on."

Then Laughing Sapphire showed them his mother-o'-pearl shell.

"This shell," he said, "is lined with a bit of rainbow."

The sea-anemone waved all his arms about wildly to show that he was
pleased.

"And this," said Laughing Sapphire, unrolling the crimson seaweed, "is a
bit of the ribbon that mermaids use for tying their hair."

"Beautiful!" murmured the land-fairy.

"And this," went on the sea-fairy, showing them the pearl, "is one of
the lanterns that the moonlight-fairies use when they dance on the sea."

"Beautiful--beautiful!" said the sea-anemone and the land-fairy
together.

Then Laughing Sapphire turned to the land-fairy with an air of triumph.

"Let us see your treasures now," he said a little contemptuously.

Sweet-of-the-Mountain held out a flower-cup with the drop of honey in
it.

It was so sweet that the sea-fairy could not help exclaiming: "Oh, how
delicious!"

"That," said the land-fairy, "is the sweetness of the garden."

Then he showed them the little green feather of moss.

"That," he said, "is the quietness of the woods."

Then he threw down the sprig of heather.

"That," he said, smiling, "is the glory of the hills."

The two fairies looked at each other silently. Each felt certain that
his own treasures were the best.

The sea-anemone's arms were all waving furiously. He was very much
excited, because he knew that the time had come for him to decide which
of the two fairies had brought the most beautiful things; and as I told
you before, he was not very quick in making up his mind.

"Well?" said Laughing Sapphire impatiently. "What do you think? Is it
best to live on the sea or on the land?"

"I think," said the sea-anemone very slowly, "that the sea is the best
place for a sea-fairy."

"Yes, yes," said the sea-fairy, "of course it is!"

"But then, you know," the sea-anemone went on, "I can't help thinking
that the land is the best place for a land-fairy."

Then he drew in all his arms and became a little knob of red jelly.

"It is possible," said Sweet-of-the-Mountain thoughtfully, "that there
is some sense in what he says. And yet"--he sniffed happily at his cup
of honey--"and yet I don't believe you have anything at sea as sweet as
this."

"It is certainly a very nice scent," agreed Laughing Sapphire, "but I do
think it would be improved by a little salt."







A fairy whose name was Hedgeflower once lived in a wild rose at the
corner of a field. One day he went out to search for adventures, for
most fairies have a great wish for adventures.

He wandered on for a long time, sometimes walking and sometimes flying,
and sometimes stopping to talk to friends, for the wild-rose-fairies
have a great many friends. He crossed several fields in this way, and
then he came to a high hedge. He was just thinking of going home when he
heard a great buzzing of voices on the other side of the hedge, and as
the voices were fairy-voices he was interested at once. Perhaps, he
thought, he would find the adventure he was looking for on the other
side of the hedge. So he spread his pink-and-white wings and flew over.

It was not surprising that he had heard a great many fairy-voices, for
he found himself in a beautiful garden, and all beautiful gardens are,
as you know, full of fairies. In this garden there were not only the
sorts of fairies that one meets every day, such as rose-fairies and
lily-fairies and the quiet little ones that live in mignonette, but
there were also all kinds of smartly dressed fairies belonging to
strange and splendid flowers. They all seemed to be getting on very well
together, for they were all talking loudly about something that
interested them very much.

As Hedgeflower dropped down into the middle of the group he felt a
little shy. But fairies are as a rule kind and friendly, so a good many
voices called out Good-morning to him as he sat down under the shade of
a large purple pansy. Then a butterfly whom he had met once or twice
before came rustling up to him and began to talk.

"I like this place," said the butterfly. "One meets so many different
kinds of fairies. But don't sit there. Come and let me introduce you to
some of my friends." Then as they moved away he lowered his voice and
went on--

"Those little pansy-fairies are good little things, but they are a bit
too thoughtful for me. I find them just a trifle dull, you know. But
here is a cousin of yours; I must introduce you."

Hedgeflower looked round and saw that a beautiful rose-fairy was
standing near. She wore flowing robes of two shades of pink, and her
appearance was full of dignity.

"Madame La France," said the butterfly, "may I introduce to you a cousin
of your own?"

"A very distant cousin, I am afraid, Madame," said Hedgeflower, bowing
low.

Madame La France smiled kindly and asked Hedgeflower if he had often
been in the garden before. He told her that this was his first visit.

"Then," she cried, "you must come to the party--you must certainly come
to Princess Orchid's party. She lives over there in the glass house, and
she has asked all the fairies in the garden to a party this afternoon.
We have been talking about it all day. You must come with me; the
Princess will be glad to see any cousin of mine."

Hedgeflower was delighted. He thought it would be great fun to tell the
fairies at home all about it: Meadowsweet, and that cheeky little
Eyebright, and Buttercup who stared at everything one said, and all the
honeysuckle-fairies, who were such friends with the wild-rose-fairies
because their families had lived close together for so long. Hedgeflower
thought that to go to a Princess's party with his beautiful cousin was a
nicer adventure than anything he had expected when he set out for his
walk.

Meanwhile all the fairies in the garden were making their way towards
the glass house.

"You must keep close to me," said Madame La France kindly. "The flower
in which the Princess lives is some way from the door, and you might be
lost in the crowd."

In another moment Hedgeflower found himself in a scene of the greatest
splendour. The glass house was full of flowers, and every flower had of
course its own special fairy, and nearly all of them were magnificently
dressed and were quite different to any fairies that Hedgeflower knew.
The greatest crowd was of course round the beautiful flower in which the
Princess Orchid lived, and Hedgeflower and his cousin found it quite
difficult to get near the Princess without crushing their wings. They
were obliged to walk so slowly that Hedgeflower had plenty of time to
look about him. He saw numbers of his cousins the rose-fairies, and tall
lily-fairies, and fern-fairies dressed all in green. The pansy-fairies
were there too, with their sad little faces and their splendid
purple-and-gold dresses. Quite close to him there was a fuchsia-fairy,
dressed in a stiff white petticoat with a pointed overskirt of scarlet;
and standing beside her were several fairies whose crimson tunics were
so fine that Hedgeflower asked who they were.

"They are the young Prince Begonias," said Madame La France. "The
Princess, being a foreigner herself, has a great many foreign friends.
The Begonias think a good deal of themselves, but I think myself that
our own family has more reason to be proud. But come, we can speak to
the Princess now."

Princess Orchid was standing on a drooping petal of the beautiful flower
in which she lived. Her long robes of mauve and white swept over the
flower as if they were themselves petals. Her hair was golden, and her
face was the loveliest that Hedgeflower had ever seen. She smiled at him
very graciously when he was introduced to her, and after he had seen
that smile he took no interest in anything else that was going on. He
never glanced again at any of the fairies who had seemed to him so
splendid a short time before: he just sat down in a nice shady clump of
ferns and watched Princess Orchid. He had been to a great many parties
in his own hedge where the wild-roses grew, but he had never seen a
fairy or even a butterfly receive her guests with so much sweetness and
graciousness. He sat there for a long time and wished it could be for
ever. Then he remembered that perhaps he would never see Princess Orchid
again, and that made him sad.

A fairy party is never dull. Fairies are full of fun and enjoy
everything very much. There was a great deal of talking and laughing and
sipping of dew flavoured with sunshine, which is the drink fairies like
instead of tea. The fairies of the Canterbury Bells had brought their
music too, and gave a great deal of pleasure. It seemed as if the party
were going to be a great success, when unfortunately a disaster
happened which was talked about for many a day afterwards.



On the roof of the glass house, just above the Princess's head, there
was a large spider who was very busy spinning his web. He was so busy
that he did not look where he was going, and when people forget to look
where they are going it is a very common thing for accidents to happen.
The spider came lower and lower, spinning all the time, while Princess
Orchid was talking very kindly to a shy little violet-fairy and was not
noticing anything else. Lower and lower, nearer and nearer, came the
spider.

Suddenly a shrill little voice was heard to cry out--

"Take care, Princess, take care!" and Hedgeflower, flying from his clump
of ferns, flung himself against the great spider. He was too late.
_Flop!_ The spider fell with all his weight upon the flower in which the
Princess lived!

No flower could bear the weight of such a monster, and to the horror of
all the fairies the beautiful mauve orchid trembled and drooped, and
then slowly fell to pieces, petal by petal. The Princess spread her
dainty wings and flew safely to the ground. Then she turned and looked
sadly at the ruin of her home. It lay bruised and crushed and shapeless
on the earth, and if once a fairy's flower-home falls to pieces it can
never be put together again.

There was a great commotion in the glass house. All the fairies flew
about in a fuss, chattering angrily and trying to find the spider who
had done the mischief. But he had quickly climbed up the rope that he
had been spinning, and was hiding behind a leaf, so he was never found.

Now, it is a very uncommon thing to find a fairy who is not kind and
anxious to help other people, so all the Princess's guests crowded round
her and begged her to come and stay with them. The fuchsia-fairies
declared they knew of the loveliest little fuchsia-bud which was in want
of some one to take care of it: it would really be a charity if the
Princess would live there. Prince Begonia objected to this, because, he
said, a fuchsia-bud was not a fit place for the Princess to live in; the
right home for her was in one of his magnificent palaces. The
lily-fairies cried out that this was all nonsense, because any one could
see that the Princess would feel more at home in a white flower than in
a red one, after living so long in the pale orchid.

While all this talking was going on the Princess did not seem to be
paying very much attention to it, though of course she bowed and smiled
and thanked the fairies very prettily, as was only right. She looked
round several times, as if she wanted some one who was not there. At
last she said--

"Where is the little fairy with the kind face, who tried to save my
home?"

Several fairies pushed Hedgeflower forward. He felt and looked very shy.

The Princess smiled at him, and then she held out her hand.

"I will go with you," she said, "and be a wild-rose-fairy."

Hedgeflower dropped on one knee before her.

"My home is in a common hedge," he said, "and there are thorns round it.
But there is no glass between me and the open sky. I think, Princess,
that a fairy should be always under the open sky and the sunshine."

"That," said the Princess, "is exactly what I think myself."

So Hedgeflower and the Princess spread their wings and took each other's
hands and flew away out of the window of the glass house, and across the
garden and over the hedge. They flew on and on, across field after
field, till they came to the hedge with the wild roses.

There the Princess Orchid made her home, among the honeysuckles and the
meadowsweet. She was no longer a princess with sweeping robes, but a
quiet little wild-rose-fairy in a pink-and-white frock. But there was no
glass between her and the sunshine.







There was once a cloud that had no lining. You have often, I dare say,
heard grown-up people say that every cloud has a silver lining, and so
you will understand that a cloud without a lining is a very uncommon
thing.

The fairies who lived in the cloud found it very uncomfortable, because,
you see, it let the rain come through.

"If only our cloud had a lining," they said, "the rain would not come
through, and that would be very nice for us."

"We must really have it lined," said one.

"What with?" asked another.

"Why, with silver, of course," said a third. "Every one knows that a
cloud ought to be lined with silver."

"But we have no silver!"

"Then we must get some. It is ridiculous to go on living in this state
of dampness. Other fairies have comfortable clouds over their heads, and
why should we be always drenched? And all for want of a simple silver
lining!"

"Where does one find silver?" asked one of the fairies.

"There are a good many kinds of silver," said a fairy who had been about
the world a great deal. "There is the kind that is dug out of the
earth,--but that is a common kind of stuff, and no use for lining clouds
with. Then there is the silver stream that you can see far below,
winding through the fields and shining white in the sun. That is a much
better kind of silver than the other. Then, of course, moonshine makes
beautiful silver: you can see it glittering on the sea whenever the moon
shines. But I really don't know what would be the best kind of silver to
line clouds with."

"We must try them all, and see which is the best," said another fairy.

They went on talking about it for some time, because such an important
matter could not be settled in a hurry. At last it was arranged that
three of them should fly away and look for some silver to line their
cloud with. The names of the three fairies were Pearlywing, and
Skybright, and Mist-of-the-Morning.

Now, all the time that the fairies were talking, Pearlywing was looking
down at the silver stream far below, winding through the meadows. It was
so white and shining that he felt sure the silver of it would make a
beautiful lining for the cloud. So when he was told to fly away and look
for some silver, he lost no time in wondering where to go. He spread his
wings--the soft grey wings that cloud-fairies have--and he flew down and
down, away from the cloud to the meadows where the silver stream was
shining. The nearer he came to it the more it sparkled. He felt sure it
must be made of the very best silver.

But how could he carry it? A fairy's cap is not very large, and he had
nothing else.

"I must just carry up a capful at a time, and empty it, and come back
for another. I must go on till there is enough silver to line the cloud
with," he said to himself.

So he filled his tiny cap with the silver of the stream, and flew up
again to his cloud, carrying the cap very carefully for fear of spilling
the silver. Then he went round to the back of the cloud where the lining
ought to have been, and poured the silver out of his cap.

Now, as I dare say you have guessed, the silver of the stream was really
nothing but water. So when it was poured out of the cap it fell right
through the cloud, and made the fairies on the other side much wetter
than they had ever been before! I need not say that they were very much
annoyed. They made so much commotion, spluttering and grumbling and
scolding, that Pearlywing heard them through the cloud, and went round
to see what was the matter.

"What we want," said one of them angrily, shaking the water off his
wings, "is something to keep us dry, not something to make us wet!"

"I am so sorry!" said Pearlywing; "but I thought it was such good
silver! And now, I suppose, you don't want any more of it."

"Certainly not!" said all the fairies very quickly.

"It is most unfortunate," said Pearlywing. "I can't understand it at
all. The silver looked so _very_ nice."

He was not a very clever fairy, I am afraid.

"I hope Skybright will have more sense," grumbled the wet fairies.

Skybright meanwhile was waiting on the sea-shore, far below the clouds.
He was waiting for the moon to rise above the sea. He had to wait a
long time, but he did not mind that, because there are always such nice
fairies to talk to on the sea-shore.

At last the big round moon sailed slowly up into the sky. At the same
moment a hundred thousand moonshine-fairies rushed out across the sea
towards Skybright, flying and dancing on the water, and turning it into
a sheet of silver as they came. For the moonshine-fairies carry silver
with them wherever they fly, and scatter it as they go.

This was the moment that Skybright had been waiting for.

"Please, pretty moonshine-fairies," he cried, running to the water's
edge and holding out his arms, "give me some of your silver to line my
cloud with, and keep the rain from coming through!"

Then the moonshine-fairies danced towards him across the sea, with their
tiny hands full of silver.

"Take our silver, little cloud-fairy," they said, "and line your cloud
with it, and dip your wings in it, and scatter it over the earth as you
fly, for everything is made more beautiful by our silver."

Then they poured the silver out of their hands into his, and because the
silver of the moonshine-fairies is very light he was able to carry a
great deal of it. He filled the pockets of his pretty grey coat with it,
and he filled his cap, and took a quantity of it in his hands. And he
said Good-bye to the moonshine-fairies, and flew away up to the clouds.



When the other cloud-fairies saw the beautiful silver he had brought
with him they were delighted. They all set to work to line the cloud
with it, spreading it out carefully and making it nice and tidy at the
edges. When the lining was finished it looked lovely, and the fairies
were much pleased with it. They sat down under the cloud, feeling quite
safe from the rain.

But unfortunately their satisfaction did not last long. Presently it
began to rain. The fairies smiled and nodded at each other, and agreed
that it was very pleasant to be safe from a wetting. Then a big heavy
drop fell right through the cloud and lining and all--and another--and
another, and soon the fairies were as wet and uncomfortable and cross as
if the cloud had never been lined. It was really very annoying.

The truth is that the silver of the moonshine-fairies is rather
thin--altogether too thin to keep the rain out, and of very little use
for lining clouds with.

"It is really too bad!" cried the poor cloud-fairies, wringing the water
out of their nice little grey coats. "What are we to do? Any one would
have thought that such beautiful silver would keep the rain out!"

"Perhaps," said one of them who liked to be cheerful,
"Mist-of-the-Morning may bring us a better kind of silver even than
this."

So they decided to grumble no more till Mist-of-the-Morning came home.

Now, when Mist-of-the-Morning started out to look for silver he did not
fly down to the earth at all.

"Every cloud but ours has a silver lining," he said to himself; "so the
best way to find the right kind of silver will be to ask the fairies who
live in the other clouds."

He saw the clouds all about him, each with a bright rim round it, which
was the edge of its lining. He went to the nearest one and spoke to the
fairies that lived in it.

"Brother fairies," he said, "where can I find silver to make my cloud a
lining as beautiful as yours?"

And the fairies answered--

"Go to the sunbeam-fairies. Their silver is the best for lining clouds
with."

Then Mist-of-the-Morning went to one cloud after another, and asked all
the fairies that lived in them the same question. And they all
answered--

"Go to the sunbeam-fairies. Their silver is the very best."

So Mist-of-the-Morning flew away to the nearest sunbeam. It was crowded
with fairies, who were all hard at work, for the sunbeam-fairies have
more work to do than any others. As they worked they were laughing and
singing, for the sunbeam-fairies are always happy.

"Please, kind sunbeam-fairies," said Mist-of-the-Morning, "I want some
silver to line my cloud with. It must be the very best silver, and every
one says that none but yours is good enough."

Then all the sunbeam-fairies shouted out--

"Quite right, little cloud-fairy, quite right! It is waste of time to
line a cloud with any silver but ours. Our silver is the very best!"

While they were speaking they all rushed to the end of the sunbeam, and
before Mist-of-the-Morning knew what they were going to do, they had cut
off a great piece of it. There it lay in a shining heap!
Mist-of-the-Morning had to shade his eyes, because its silvery
brightness dazzled him.

"Sunbeam silver!" sang the fairies. "Sunbeam silver is the best of all!"

Then Mist-of-the-Morning spread his wings and flew home, trailing the
sunbeam after him. And all the fairies in his own cloud welcomed him
with shouts and singing, because they saw at once that sunbeam silver
was the best of all.

They made their cloud a beautiful thick lining of it, with the silver
shining all round the edge. And the rain never came through any more.

Now that I have told you this story I hope you will not forget that it
is waste of time to line a cloud with any kind of silver except the kind
that sunbeams are made of.







This story is about something that happened long, long, and ever so long
ago, before the fairies had really settled down to their work.

There was then a little fairy called Starblossom, whose business it was
to take care of the earliest Spring flowers; and there was also a fairy
called Drop-of-Crystal, whose work it was to make snowflakes. These two
fairies were great friends.

One day Starblossom had not very much to do. She had finished sharpening
the little green spikes of her flower-leaves, and had even made ready
one or two white buds. But when she saw that Drop-of-Crystal was very
busy making heavy drops of snow, she thought to herself that there was
no need for her to be in a hurry about the Spring flowers. They would be
much more comfortable underground if Drop-of-Crystal were going to fling
snowflakes all over them. So she carefully covered up her buds and went
off to watch the snow-fairy at work.

Drop-of-Crystal was too busy to speak. He was making an enormous
quantity of snowflakes. Starblossom was silent for some time, but at
last she asked--

"What are they all for?"

"For a snow-storm, of course," said Drop-of-Crystal shortly.

"Are they all to be used in one storm?" asked Starblossom. "It will be a
very big storm, I'm afraid."

"It will," said Drop-of-Crystal--"very big. You'd better take care of
those flowers of yours, or they'll be hurt."

"There are not many of them above ground," Starblossom answered. "I saw
what you were doing. But in any case my flowers are not likely to be
hurt by the snow-fairies so much as by the frost-fairies."

Drop-of-Crystal said nothing to this, but went on working busily.

Presently Starblossom spoke again.

"It seems to me that snowflakes are very easy to make. Your work is
really much easier than mine. It is very difficult to make flowers
nicely. One has to be so particular about the shape of them."

"I don't agree with you at all," said Drop-of-Crystal rather crossly.
"My work is much harder than yours. I have to make thousands and
thousands of snowflakes for the very smallest snow-storm. You can take
quite a long time arranging the shape of your flowers, but I have to
work in a hurry, or the storm would run short of snowflakes. And that
would be very serious."

"Not half so serious as it would be if the Spring were to run short of
flowers," said Starblossom indignantly.

"Look here," said Drop-of-Crystal, losing his temper, "if you like my
work so much I wish you'd do it! You can set to work and make a few
thousand snowflakes while I take a rest."

"I shall be delighted to do such easy work," said Starblossom; "but of
course if I make your snowflakes you must make my flowers. That is only
fair."



"Very well," said Drop-of-Crystal, "I don't mind. After all, work of
that kind is just the same as resting."

So he flew off to the place where Starblossom's flowers were beginning
to show their spiky leaves above ground. He had never made a flower
before, and did not know how to set about it, but he was much too proud
to ask Starblossom how it ought to be done. So he did the best he could
by himself.

It was a long time before he had finished a flower-bud. When the first
one was done he thought it looked rather odd.

"There is something peculiar about that flower-bud," he said to himself.
"It is really more like a big drop of snow than a flower! I suppose that
comes of making snowflakes for so long. I must try again."

So he tried again, and again, and again. But every time the flower-bud
was exactly like a big drop of snow.

"I can't help it," he said at last. "They _will_ keep on being like
drops of snow. But, after all, there is no reason why a flower should
not be like a drop of snow. They are dear little flowers, anyway, and I
shall go on making them like this."

So he went on for a long time making flowers that were like drops of
snow, and dear little flowers they were.

In the meantime Starblossom was hard at work making snowflakes. She knew
no more about making snowflakes than Drop-of-Crystal knew about making
flowers, but, like Drop-of-Crystal, she determined to do the best she
could without asking for help. She took a long time to make the first
snowflake, because she was accustomed to finish her flowers very
carefully, and she liked everything she made to be pretty. She laughed
to herself as she put down the first finished snowflake.

"That is what comes of making nothing but flowers," she said. "That
snowflake is exactly like a flower!"

She was quite right. The snowflake was like a delicate, starry flower,
light as air, and clear as crystal, and glistening in the sunshine.

"I like that kind of snowflake," said Starblossom. "I shall make some
more."

So she made a great number of snowflakes, and they were all like
feathery flowers, all different in shape, but all beautiful.

"I should like to go on making snow-flowers always," she said to
herself.

At that moment Drop-of-Crystal flew up to her in a great hurry.

"Oh, do come and see my nice new flowers," he cried. "They are quite a
new kind, and they are so pretty--just like drops of snow!"

"And my drops of snow are just like flowers!" cried Starblossom. "And I
want to go on making them always, because they are so beautiful."

"Well then," said Drop-of-Crystal, clapping his hands, "suppose you and
I change places! You shall go on making snowflakes, and I'll go on
making flowers!"

So that was the way they settled it.

And because Drop-of-Crystal was a snow-fairy, the flowers he made were
always like drops of snow; and because Starblossom was a flower-fairy,
the snowflakes she made were always like flowers.

That is the reason why, to this day, the first flowers of Spring are
like drops of snow, and the snowflakes are like beautiful, starry
flowers. You must often have noticed it yourself.







The opal was the last of the precious stones to be made. And this was
how it happened.

Long, long ago--so long ago that no one had ever seen a ruby or a
sapphire or an emerald--there was a Princess who had a great many
friends among the fairies. Because they loved her they called her the
Dear Princess, and the country in which she lived was known as the
Crystal Mountain. It was the delight of the fairies to do her bidding,
to fly and fly over hill and dale to fetch her anything she wished to
have. Sometimes she wished to have very curious things, because all the
ordinary things that Princesses like to have had been brought to her
long ago by the fairies. If she wanted things that no one had ever heard
of before, the fairies would set to work to make them for her. One day
she said--

"Oh, Fairies dear, I am going to be married. I am going to marry the
Prince of the Far Land over the Hill, and the wedding is to be the
grandest ever seen. My dress is lovely: it was cut out of a rainbow on
purpose for me, and trimmed with the edge of a sunset cloud. But what
_am_ I to wear in my hair?"

Now, the Princess's hair hung over her in dark waves, like a long cloak.

"Flowers!" cried the fairies. "Quick--quick--let us fly for flowers to
twist in the Dear Princess's hair!"

So they all flew away, some in one direction and some in another, while
the Dear Princess of the Crystal Mountain sat and waited, with her
cloud of hair hanging round her.

Very soon she saw them flying back, some from gardens and some from
orchards, and some from the hills where the heather grew, and some from
country lanes where the flowers were very sweet, and some from hothouses
where the flowers were very rare. Wherever they came from they were all
laden with flowers. Some brought roses, red and white and yellow; some
brought heavy white lilies; some brought long trails of honeysuckle.
Some were carrying great bundles of forget-me-nots; others had strange
flowers from distant countries; others had bunches of golden daffodils.
They crowded round the Dear Princess, and laid the flowers in great
heaps beside her.

"Wear my roses!" cried one. "See how the crimson of them glows in your
dark hair!"

"Wear my daffodils!" cried another. "See how they shine like gold!"

"Wear my lilies!" cried a third, "for they match your lily-face!"

Then they all held up the flowers against the Princess's dark hair, to
see which looked the best; red, or yellow, or white. The Princess
herself found it very hard to make up her mind, because they were all so
beautiful that she would have liked to wear them all. First she chose
one, and then another, and then she thought that, after all, a third
would look the best.

This went on for so long that at last the flowers died.

"Ah, look," said the Princess, "the flowers are dead!"

"Oh dear, oh dear!" cried all the fairies together. "The flowers are
dead! What shall we do now?"

The Princess sat down among the dead flowers, and thought.

"I must have something that will not die," she said at last, "something
stronger than flowers. In my dark hair I must have something that will
gleam and sparkle. I must have colour that will not fade, a dewdrop that
will not melt, a spark of fire that will not go out."

"Dear me!" said the fairies; and they said no more for some time, for
they were thinking that the Dear Princess wanted a good deal.

After a time three of them began talking together all at once, as if a
very good idea had suddenly come into their heads.

Then these three spread their wings and flew away. They flew far away
from the Princess and her palace, far from the other fairies, up and up
to the heights of the Crystal Mountain. Then each of them chipped off a
little piece of the rock at the top of the mountain, and each, as he did
it, laughed aloud gleefully. Then each little fairy tucked his chip of
rock under his arm; and they all nodded to each other, still laughing,
and spread their wings again, and flew off in different directions.

The first of the three, with his chip of rock under his arm, flew
straight to the sea-shore. On the shore, close to the shining blue sea,
there lived a very nice mermaid who was a great friend of the fairy's.
So he flew to her with the bit of crystal rock and said--

"Mermaid, mermaid, here is a chip from the Crystal Mountain. Take it
for me, and dip it into the darkest and deepest deep of the blue sea."

So the mermaid took the crystal chip and dived down with it into the
darkest and deepest deep of the blue sea.

Now, it is well known that whatever is touched by the deepest deep of
the sea is changed by it for ever, and becomes itself a part of the sea.
And so, when the mermaid brought the chip of crystal back to the fairy
it had become like a chip of the sea--shining and gleaming and deep,
deep blue.

And that was the first sapphire.

And when the second fairy left the Crystal Mountain with his little bit
of rock under his arm, he flew to the great forest where the wood-pixies
lived.

"Pixies, pixies," he called to them, "here is a chip from the Crystal
Mountain. Take it for me into the darkest and deepest deep of the green
forest, and do not bring it back to me till the green of the forest has
sunk into its very heart."

Of course you must have noticed that the wood-pixies have the gift of
making things green; for every one knows that in the forest where they
live everything is green--the trees and the grass and the soft moss. And
the shade under the trees is dark, dark green, and here and there where
the sun peeps through, the green is very bright. So the pixies took the
chip of crystal away with them into the darkest deep of the forest and
laid it in the green moss where the green shadows were darkest under the
green trees. And after a time the magic of the pixies began to work, and
the greenness of the forest sank into the very heart of the crystal.
Then they carried it back to the fairy, and he saw that the greenness of
the deep shadows had sunk into the heart of the crystal, and because the
sunshine had peeped through the trees there was a glint of light in it.

And that was the first emerald.

When the third fairy left the Crystal Mountain with his little bit of
rock under his arm, he flew away to that other mountain where the
fire-gnomes worked underground. At the top of the fire-mountain there
was a great hole, and when the fairy stood at the edge and looked in he
could see the gnomes at work, keeping the fire alight that warms the
world. So he called out to them--

"Fire-gnomes, fire-gnomes, here is a chip from the Crystal Mountain.
Take it for me into the hottest and deepest deep of the fire, and keep
it there until its heart is glowing red."

So the fire-gnomes took the chip of crystal and carried it down, down
into the deepest deep of the fire that warms the world. And the fire
sparkled and glowed and wrapped it round. And before very long the
crystal began to glow too as it lay in the fire, for of course a fire
that is hot enough to warm the world is hot enough to warm a chip of
rock. So the fire-gnomes picked it up again and carried it back to the
fairy who was waiting at the edge of the great hole; and he saw that the
heart of the crystal chip was crimson and glowing like a fire.

And that was the first ruby.

Then he flew away from the fire-mountain with the ruby safely tucked
under his arm, and went back to the Dear Princess. At the same moment
the fairy with the emerald arrived from the forest, and the fairy with
the sapphire came back from the sea. They flew to the feet of the Dear
Princess, and held out the beautiful stones to her.

The Princess clapped her hands and cried--

"Oh, how splendid, how splendid they are! The blue is like a bit of the
dark sea, and the green is like the shade of the forest with the sun
peeping in, and the red is like the red heart of the fire!"

Then the first fairy laid the sapphire against her dark hair.

"You must wear it on your wedding-day," he said.

But the second fairy held up the emerald and said--

"No, no, this is what you must wear!"

And the third fairy laughed and cried--

"How silly they are! Any one can see that red is the colour to wear in
your dark hair!"

The Princess looked from one to the other and was puzzled. She thought
all the stones were so beautiful that she would have liked to wear them
all; but she did not think they would look really nice all together.

"What am I to do?" she said, puckering up her forehead. "How can I
choose when they are all so beautiful?"

Then there was a very long discussion about it. Each of the three
fairies wished his own stone to be worn, and the Princess could not tell
what to do.

"Each of them is quite beautiful," she said, "but, dear fairies, I am
obliged to say that I do _not_ like the look of them all together!"

All this time a very small fairy had been sitting quietly in the corner,
saying nothing, but thinking a great deal. He came forward now and
spoke.

"Give the stones to me," he said, "and I will settle the question."

So he took the three stones and flew away, far up into the sky, above
the Princess's dark head, above the houses and the trees, above the
Crystal Mountain even, into the misty sunshine behind the clouds.

Then he called to the sun-fairies--

"Sun-fairies, sun-fairies, melt me these stones in your furnace. Melt
them, and mix them, and make them into one stone. And soften their
colours with mist of sunshine, so that my Dear Princess may wear them
all together in her hair."

So the sun-fairies carried the three stones away, and melted them all
into one, and mixed them with mist of sunshine, and it lay over the
colours like a cloud. And then there was only one stone, but it was a
great big one, and as beautiful as all the others put together. For, you
see, that was just what it was.

The small fairy took it carefully into his tiny arms and flew down again
through the clouds, past the Crystal Mountain and past the tops of the
trees, to the feet of the Dear Princess.

He held up the great gleaming stone to her, and she thought she had
never seen anything so beautiful. For the blue of the sea was in it, and
the green shade of the forest, and the red heart of fire. And over the
colours the mist of sunshine lay like a veil.

And that was the first opal.

Of course the Dear Princess of the Crystal Mountain wore the great opal
on the day that she was married to the Prince of the Far Land over the
Hill. And when she was an old, old Princess, with white hair instead of
dark, she often showed the opal to her grandchildren, and told them how
it was made of blue sea, and green shadows, and fire, melted all
together by the fairies and mixed with mist of sunshine.




The sun-fairies were hiding behind a black cloud; but in the middle of
the cloud there was a hole, and through this hole the sun-fairies
peeped.

In this way they were able to see everything that went on in the garden
where the Big Spider lived. If the Big Spider had looked up at the sky
he could have seen the sun-fairies peeping through the hole in the black
cloud; but he did not look up, because he was thinking of other things.
He was in an excited state of mind.

Quite lately the Big Spider had spun a most beautiful web for himself,
and had slung it between two tall blades of grass. He was very proud of
it, for it was the nicest web in all the garden, being of a lovely and
difficult pattern, and made with great skill. And now something had
happened in the night to make it still more beautiful. While the Big
Spider was asleep the dew-fairies had crept up from the grass, and had
hung hundreds of sparkling diamonds on the strings of his web. He knew
it must have been done by the dew-fairies, because they only keep the
very best diamonds.

"Dear me, this is most kind of them," he said to himself. "They must
have noticed that my web was the best in the garden; otherwise they
would not have done it so much honour."

As a matter of fact, the dew-fairies had been hanging diamonds that
night on the webs of all the spiders in the garden; but the Big Spider
was so much occupied in admiring his own web that he had no attention
to spare for the others.

"Good morning," he said pleasantly to a fly who was passing. "Have you
seen my diamonds? They look very well there, don't they? They show off
the pattern of the web. Won't you come a little closer? You can hardly
see them properly at that distance. One really sees them best when one
is inside the web. Can't you come in this morning?"

"No, thank you," said the fly firmly; for his mother had told him that
the Big Spider was not a nice friend for little flies.

Then he flew away, and the Spider went on admiring his diamonds. He
looked at them first from the right, and then from the left, and then he
stepped backwards and looked at them again. If you have ever seen a
person who paints pictures you will know exactly how he behaved.

All this time the sun-fairies had been peeping through the hole in the
black cloud and watching the Big Spider. They could not help laughing at
him.

"Ridiculous creature!" cried one. "Look at him admiring his web, as if
it were the only one that had ever been hung with diamonds!"

"If he would look about him a little bit," said another, "he would see
that the whole garden is blazing with diamonds this morning."

"The very grass is all twinkly and shiny with them," said a third, "but
the grass-fairies are not behaving in that absurd way."

"No fairy would be so silly," said a fourth.

Suddenly a little sun-fairy began to clap his hands.

"I've got an idea," he cried.

As his ideas were generally full of mischief and very interesting, all
the other fairies stopped talking.

"It's a lovely idea," he went on, chuckling. "This is what we'll do.
We'll wait till that silly old Spider goes to sleep or is busy, and then
we'll rush down--quick as quick--and _steal his diamonds_!"

Then all the sun-fairies laughed and clapped their hands so loudly that
the hole in the black cloud grew a good deal larger. They thought it was
a grand idea.

They had not long to wait. Presently the Spider became rather tired of
admiring his diamonds all by himself, so he set to work to send out
invitations for a fly-party. He asked all the flies in the neighbourhood
to come and see how nice his web looked when it was hung with diamonds.
As soon as the sun-fairies saw that he was busy they took each other's
hands, and with a little run and a big jump they all burst through the
hole in the black cloud. Then they flew softly down to the garden where
the Big Spider lived.

"How nice and warm it is getting!" thought the Spider.

Presently he said to himself--

"My diamonds must be sparkling beautifully in this sunshine. I'll just
take a look at them."

He turned round, expecting to see the pattern of his web delicately
outlined in sparks of light. You will not be surprised to hear that he
saw nothing of the kind. He saw his web, it is true, looking like filmy
lace against the green of the grass; but there was not one single
diamond hanging upon it!

Then the rage of the Big Spider was terrible to see.

He stamped with all his legs, and he rolled himself round and round, and
he used all the most dreadful threats in spider-language.

"I don't care who the thief is," he said; "I shall think no more of
eating him than if he were a fly!"

At that moment he heard the sweetest little laugh just behind him. This
made him so angry that he spent a long time in looking for the person
who laughed. While he was still searching the sun-fairies flew up again
to the black clouds, carrying the diamonds with them.

"There," they said, as they threw the diamonds down on the cloud, "he
won't find them there!"

They had forgotten for the moment that, hidden in the black cloud, there
were a great number of rain-fairies. Now the rain-fairies never enjoy
themselves so much as when they are annoying the sun-fairies: and in the
same way there is nothing that pleases the sun-fairies so much as a good
quarrel with the rain-fairies. This does not prevent them from being
very friendly when they are not quarrelling.

The rain-fairies had seen all that had happened. They pretended to think
that the sun-fairies had behaved very unkindly to the Big Spider.

"It's too bad," they said, "to steal the poor thing's diamonds. It's not
fair. Let's throw them down to him."

Then a great fight began between the sun-fairies and the rain-fairies
for the diamonds, and the fight lasted a long time, and all the time
that it lasted the Big Spider was in a rage.



At last the rain-fairies won the fight, and went off with the diamonds
in their arms.

"Now we'll throw them to the Big Spider," they said, "and we'll see how
glad he is when his web is hung with diamonds as it was before."

They forgot that the dew-fairies, when they had trimmed the web with the
diamonds, had crept up softly and touched the strings with gentle
fingers. But the rain-fairies are rather rough.

They flung out their little arms and threw the diamonds down out of the
black cloud. Down dropped the diamonds, and down, and down, till they
reached the garden where the Big Spider lived, and the web that the Big
Spider had made. But instead of hanging on the web in rows, like little
lighted lamps, they dropped into the middle of it with a crash and a
dash and a splash, and broke it into a great many pieces, so that the
web and the diamonds and the Big Spider himself all fell to the ground.

And by the time the Big Spider was standing on all his legs again the
diamonds had disappeared into the grass.

The truth is that the dew-fairies had found them and had taken them
home. I expect they will keep them till the Big Spider has made a new
web.







Christabel was a little girl who read a great many books. She noticed
that the girls and boys in the books were not altogether like the girls
and boys who played with her in the Square and came to tea with her. The
children in the books were wonderfully brave and clever; and when they
were having their magnificent adventures they always did exactly the
right thing at the right moment. They never had a dull minute, and they
never said anything silly. The girls and boys who came to tea with
Christabel were not like this, and Christabel knew that she herself was
not like this. She never had any adventures, and she knew that even if
she ever did have one she would not behave at all bravely or cleverly.
And she was often so dull that she drummed with her fingers on the
window and said--

"What on earth shall I do?"

Now, Christabel had a Big Sister who wrote books.

One day she said to her Big Sister--

"How I do wish I were a little girl in a book! Nothing ever happens to
little girls in real life. It is so dull!"

The Big Sister went on writing, and said nothing.

"It's no use talking to her," thought Christabel, "because she always
goes on writing."

A few days after this Christabel began to feel rather strange. A kind of
stiffness came into all her limbs, so that they would not do what she
told them. And sometimes she found herself saying things that she had
not intended to say at all. This puzzled her and made her very
uncomfortable. She wondered if other people noticed that there was
something wrong with her. She even thought of speaking to her Big Sister
about it, but the Big Sister was so busy writing that it was no use to
try and make her hear.

This went on for some time. Christabel grew stiffer and stiffer, and
more and more uncomfortable; and her Big Sister went on writing busily.

At last one day Christabel understood what had happened. She woke up and
found that everything round her had changed; the people and the place
and everything. She was frightened at first, and then the truth suddenly
flashed into her mind. A most remarkable and unusual and unexpected
thing had happened: her Big Sister had put her into a book!

"So I really am a little girl in a book, after all!" she said to
herself.

She tried to say it aloud, but she found she couldn't. The words were
not in the book, you see.

"Now I am going to enjoy myself," she thought, "and never be dull any
more."

There was not much chance of her being dull, for the book was full of
adventures and narrow escapes, and other delightful things.

First she was captured by pirates; and after having a terrible time with
them she was saved from them by a shipwreck. The shipwreck did not do
her much good, however, for she at once fell into the hands of the most
dreadful savages. So you will understand that she was not at all likely
to be dull.

Christabel was delighted to find that she behaved, like other little
girls in books, with the greatest courage and cleverness. Whenever an
adventure was going on she always managed to get out of every
difficulty, and she saved the lives of several of the other people in
the book by her bravery. The strange thing was that she found it quite
easy to be brave; while she was a little girl in real life she had not
found it easy at all.

"I do hope the book has a happy ending," she thought sometimes.

She wished very much that she could peep into the end of the book, as
she used to do when she was a little girl in real life. Meantime every
chapter was more exciting than the last. Of course Christabel did not
know whether she would escape from the savages at all. Perhaps they were
going to eat her. That would not be a happy ending to the book, she
felt.

After a great many terrible dangers, she managed to escape; for a ship
sailed into the bay at the right moment, and took her home to England.
This was the end of the book. The person who was reading it shut it up
with a bang--and Christabel went to sleep.

By-and-by, some one else took up the book and began to read it. Then
Christabel woke up and found herself at the beginning of the story.
After so many adventures she was rather tired, and did not feel inclined
to begin them all over again. But that was just what she had to do.
Being captured by pirates is not nearly so exciting when you know you
can only escape from them by a cold, wet shipwreck; and when you are
shipwrecked you are not very anxious to scramble ashore when you know
there are a large number of fierce savages waiting for you!

"This is rather tiresome," thought Christabel.

She was very glad when the person who was reading the book shut it up
again, and she was allowed to go quietly to sleep.

But her sleep was not long. Every time any one began to read the book
poor Christabel was obliged to wake up and go through all her troubles
again. She soon became horribly tired of being shipwrecked.

"Have I got to spend the rest of my life with pirates and savages?" she
asked herself in despair.

It was especially annoying that they were always the same pirates and
savages, who said always exactly the same things. Christabel soon knew
the whole book by heart. She wished sometimes she could be one of the
pirates for a change, instead of being always a little girl.

"I suppose I shall never even be grown up," she thought sadly.

The most unpleasant thing of all was that she was never able to say what
she wished to say: she was always obliged to say what was in the book.
Sometimes she opened her mouth to say what was in her mind, and then
found herself speaking words that had nothing to do with her thoughts.

"It is simply hateful not to be able to say and do what one likes," she
thought.

She made up her mind to try and be drowned at the very next shipwreck.
Of course it was useless for her to try, for the book said she was saved
by a big wave which flung her up on a rock. It was uncomfortable for her
to be saved in this way, but she could not avoid it. The shipwreck
happened in the usual way, in spite of her efforts to be drowned; and
then, as usual, she met the savages on the Island, and soon afterwards
came the end of the book.



Now, it happened this time that the person who was reading the book did
not shut it up at all, but handed it at once to some one else who wished
to read it. This was really too much for Christabel's temper. She had
had no sleep, and she was determined not to begin all over again without
a rest. It suddenly struck her that this was her only chance--now,
before the beginning of the first chapter.

She lost no time. She knew she ought to be standing up--the book said
she was standing up. Finding to her great joy that she was able to move
of her own accord, she calmly sat down and folded her arms. The other
people in the book looked at her in surprise.

"It's no use looking at me like that," she said; "I'm tired of this. I'm
not going on any more saying the same things over and over again. If
there's any pirate who would like to change places with me I don't mind
being a pirate for a bit. But I'm not going on being the little girl."

Then there was indeed an outcry. All the people in the book began
speaking at once. Just at that moment--before the beginning of the first
chapter--they were all able to say what they chose.

"Make her stand up!" cried one.

"I never heard such nonsense!" said another.

"Why can't she behave as we do?" asked a third angrily.

"The idea of wanting a change!"

"She'll have to behave like other people in the end."

"So discontented!"

"So very odd!"

So they went on, while Christabel still sat calmly, with her arms
crossed.

"I'm not going to begin all over again," she repeated firmly.

"But that poor boy is waiting to begin the book," said some one; "and we
can't go on while you are behaving in this silly way."

"I can't help that," said Christabel; "I'm tired of saying things I
don't a bit mean."

Before she knew what was going to happen Christabel found herself in the
middle of a terrible turmoil. All the people in the book seemed to be
rushing at her.

Far away she heard a voice saying--

"There's something very queer about this book. It seems all in a muddle,
somehow!"

Then there was silence, and Christabel realized that the people in the
book had turned her out! She was no longer a little girl in a book, but
a little girl in real life. She looked round and saw her Big Sister,
still writing.

"I don't want to be in a book any more," said Christabel. "Real life is
nicer. In real life one can at least say what one thinks one's self,
instead of always saying what other people think."

"Don't be too sure of that," said her Big Sister.







Little Fairy Flitterwing had no home. Whenever he settled down in a
place something happened to turn him out. If he found a comfortable
rosebud some one would come and pick it, and then it died and he was
homeless again. If he chose a pink-edged daisy to live in, the gardener
would mow the lawn at once. He grew very tired of wandering about the
garden, and he determined at last to go out into the world in search of
a home.

It was quite a small garden, in the middle of a town. Flitterwing felt
rather afraid of venturing into the streets, because he knew there would
not be many fairies there, and not many nice places for a fairy to live
in. So he was a little sad and anxious as he flew over the high brick
wall of the garden and looked about him. He found himself in a queer
little yard, not nearly as nice as the garden, with a pavement of round
stones and an ugly brick house at one end of it. There never was a more
unlikely place for a fairy to find a comfortable home. Flitterwing was
on the point of flying back again over the garden wall, when he caught
sight of something green at the further end of the courtyard. Some grass
had grown up among the stones.

"The very place for me!" said Flitterwing to himself. "No one is likely
to disturb me here, and I can fly across to the garden whenever I feel
lonely."

So he found a cosy corner between two stones, where the grass was thick
and soft, and there he made up his mind to stay. It was not, of course,
the very best kind of place for a fairy, but, after all, it was quiet
and near his friends, and he was terribly tired of moving about from
rose to rose and from daisy to daisy. So he thought he would make the
best of it.

Very soon he felt quite at home in the grass-patch at the end of the
yard. Every morning, of course, he had to attend to the grass and see
that it was always fresh and green, for it is the business of every
fairy to take care of the place he lives in. He does it instead of
paying rent. Then, after polishing his wings nicely and making them
shine like opals, he would fly across the brick wall and have a chat
with the grass-fairies and flower-fairies in the garden.

His life went on in this quiet and comfortable way for some time.

But one morning poor Flitterwing received a great shock. He was very
busy cleaning the grass with a dewdrop, and thinking how strong and tall
the blades had grown since he first began to take care of them. They
were a good deal taller than himself now, and he was not able to see
over them. So, when he heard a heavy footstep clattering across the
yard, he peered between the blades of grass to see who was coming.

"Oh dear, oh dear," he cried, "here's that dreadful gardener! I'm sure
he's going to turn me out!"

He quickly dropped the crumpled cobweb soaked in dewdrop with which he
was rubbing the green blades, and folding his wings closely round him he
hid himself in the grass, and waited to see what was going to happen.

The gardener was carrying a basket in one hand, and in the other a tool
with dreadful prongs. He was going to pull up the grass that had grown
among the stones! Poor Flitterwing's nice new home was going to be
spoilt!

One by one the tufts were dragged up by the roots, while the sharp
prongs clinked against the stones and the gardener's fingers crumpled up
the blades of grass that had looked so green and fresh a few minutes
before. Flitterwing was terribly frightened.

"The sooner I get out of this the better," he said to himself, skipping
away from the gardener's big fingers. Then he spread his wings and flew
up and away, over the wall and over the garden and on and on. He went on
flying, flying, till all his friends were left far behind and he came to
strange streets such as he had never seen before. Still he went on
flying, flying. You see he was extremely anxious to be very far away
from the gardener with the big fingers and the terrible, sharp prongs.

At last he became dreadfully tired. It would be impossible, he felt, to
go on flying much longer, so he looked about him for shelter. He saw an
open window, and beyond it a large cool room. Here was shelter at all
events, so he flew straight in. There were a number of tables and chairs
in the room, and at each table a man sat writing; but Flitterwing was
too much frightened to see anything. He only wanted to find a place
where he could hide and rest. A large ink-pot stood on a table, and just
inside the ink-pot was a little ledge where a fairy might rest
comfortably. Flitterwing lost no time; he darted into the ink-pot and
sat down on the ledge. In a few moments he folded his tired wings about
him and fell fast asleep.

Now, the room into which Flitterwing had flown was a place where a great
deal of business was done. Every day a number of men sat there adding up
figures and writing letters about dull things that neither you nor I
could understand. If you have done many sums, you will agree with me
that no sensible man could really like spending all his time in adding
up pounds, shillings, and pence. Very few of the men in this big room
really liked it. Some of them wanted to be playing cricket or golf, some
would rather have been reading books or listening to beautiful music;
and every one of them was longing to be in the country among the flowers
and the fairies. And there was one among them--a little man with a pale
face and a thin coat--who wished above all things to be making poetry.
There were two good reasons against his doing this. In the first place,
he was obliged to earn money, and this is more easily done by adding up
figures than by making poetry; and in the second place, he did not in
the least know how poetry ought to be made.

On the sunny morning when Flitterwing took refuge in the ink-pot the Man
in the Thin Coat was very busy. There were rows and rows of figures
waiting to be added up, so that there seemed to be no end to them. A
large sheet of paper was before him on which he was doing these sums,
and the figures were arranged in terribly long columns--and no doubt you
know how unpleasant that is. Suddenly something glittered in the air for
a moment and then disappeared. It was so bright that it caught his eye
and made him lose his place. He thought it was some beautiful kind of
insect with the sunshine caught in its wings.

"It was like a messenger from the summer!" he said to himself.

Then he dipped his pen in the ink-pot and went back to his sums.

He had been working busily for some time when he noticed something very
curious. His pen was not writing figures at all! He was thinking about
figures, and he wished to put figures on the paper, so it was a very
strange thing that his pen was writing words all the time. The words
were arranged in short lines with a capital letter at the beginning of
each line.

"Dear me, how annoying!" he said to himself. "What can I have been
thinking of? This will never do."

So he took a fresh sheet and began again.

He imagined that he was copying all the figures on to the clean sheet of
paper, for that was what he intended to do. He wrote the figures very
quickly, as he thought, because he wanted to make up for lost time. Then
he glanced at what he had written--and threw down his pen angrily.

There were no figures at all on the paper; nothing but line after line
of words. He began to think he must have got a sunstroke.

"This is really terrible!" he muttered. "I must pay more attention to
what I am doing."

So he took another clean sheet of paper and began again.

It was no use; the pen refused to make a single figure.

Then the Man in the Thin Coat was in despair. He pushed the paper away
from him and threw himself back in his chair.

"There is something very serious the matter with me," he said to
himself. He did not notice that another man had come up to the table and
was gathering together the sheets of paper that lay on it. This was the
person who paid the Man in the Thin Coat for doing his sums for him. He
had a round face and a big waistcoat.

"Come, come! what's this?" he said, looking at the sheets of paper.
"Poetry, I declare! So you're a poet, are you? That's all very well, but
I don't pay you to write poetry."

The poor Man in the Thin Coat looked very much disturbed. When you come
to think of it, it is a disturbing thing to find you are writing poetry
when you imagine you are doing sums.

"I couldn't help it," he said meekly.

"Yes, yes, that's the excuse they all make," said the Man with the Big
Waistcoat. Then he took up the papers and began to read. There was
silence in the room while he was reading the poem that the Man in the
Thin Coat had written by mistake; every one left off working, and
watched with great interest to see what would happen. The silence lasted
for some time.

"Dear me!" said the Man with the Big Waistcoat at last. "This is a very
beautiful poem!"

Then he began to read aloud.

The poem was about the summer; about the sunshine and the blue sky and
the singing larks that were far away from that ugly room. It seemed as
though the far-off fields and the glory of the sun had been really
brought there, to the tired men who sat listening. And to each man as he
listened came a dream of the thing he loved best. To one man the room
seemed to have turned into a garden; the scent of a thousand roses was
in the air, and the colours of a thousand flowers. Another man thought
he was in a field, lying under a tree and looking at the pattern of the
leaves against the sky. And another saw the sunshine sparkling on the
dear sea, and the little ripples running races on the sand. But the Man
in the Thin Coat saw more things than any of them.

And while they were all listening to the beautiful poem about the
summer, little Fairy Flitterwing slipped out of the ink-pot and flew off
to play with a sunbeam on the window-sill. The sunbeam showed him a very
comfortable scarlet geranium that was growing in a window not far off,
so Flitterwing went to live in it, and found a safe home at last.

And the Man in the Thin Coat went back to his sums. He was happier than
he had ever been before, because he had written a beautiful poem. He was
never able to write any more poetry, and he thought this was rather odd
until, years afterwards, his little daughter guessed the truth. He had
just finished reading to her his poem about the summer.

"Why, Daddy," she said, "there must have been a fairy in your ink-pot
when you wrote that!"







Long ago there lived in a far country a little girl called Gretel, whose
mother was dying. Before she died she said to Gretel--

"I am very poor, and I have no money to leave for you after I am gone. I
have nothing to give you but this box. It was given to me when I was a
child by some one who was wise and good. You must be very careful of it,
for it is full of Dreams, and they are hard to keep safely. You must
never open the box except when you are alone, or the Dreams will fly
away. But keep them safely till your hair is grey, and something will
happen to surprise you."

Gretel took the box and hid it safely, and said nothing about it to any
one. Her mother died a few days afterwards, and then Gretel was sent
away to be a little servant, and to work very hard. She had to get up
early, and light the fire, and feed the pigs, and she had to wash the
dishes and scrub the floor, and do a great many other things, so that
there was very little time for anything but work. All the time her box
of Dreams was hidden away upstairs in her little trunk, underneath her
Sunday frock. Often, when she was working in the kitchen, or in the
farmyard among the hens, she was thinking of her box of Dreams; and
sometimes when she was quite alone she would open it and look inside.
The first time she opened the box she felt a little bit frightened, for
she had never seen any Dreams before, and she was not sure what they
were like; but when she saw them, soft and pink and downy, like lovely
sleeping birds, she was not frightened any more.

"Oh, but they are pretty things!" she said to herself. "How I hope I
shall be able to keep them safely till my hair is grey! They look as if
a breath would blow them away, out of the window and over the hill!"

For a long time she was very careful not to let any one see her pretty
rosy Dreams. Indeed, she never spoke of them; and the old farmer's wife,
whose servant she was, little guessed that anything so strange as a box
of Dreams was hidden upstairs in the garret, underneath Gretel's Sunday
frock.

The farmer and his wife had a son about the same age as Gretel. His name
was Eitel. He was a big, clumsy sort of boy, and not very clever; but
Gretel had very few friends, so when Eitel was kind to her and talked to
her over the fire in the evenings she was very glad. Sometimes he
carried the big bucket for her when she went out to feed the pigs, and
sometimes in the summer they made hay together in the field on the
hillside. In this way they became great friends. Gretel told Eitel
everything that had happened to her since she was a little child; and
one day she told him about her box of Dreams.

"Let me see them, Gretel dear," said Eitel.

"Oh, but I mustn't!" said Gretel. "No one must see them till my hair is
grey. If any one sees them they will fly away, out of the window and
over the hill."

"What are they like?" asked Eitel. "And what are they for?"

"They are lovely," said Gretel, "but I don't know yet what they are
for."

"Come, let me see them," said Eitel coaxingly. "I believe I see a grey
hair on your head, Gretel."

It was really a bit of white thread, but Gretel thought her hair must be
growing grey, so she ran upstairs and fetched the box of Dreams down to
the kitchen. She opened the box very carefully, and Eitel peeped in.

_Pouf! Pouf!_ Half-a-dozen soft rosy Dreams fluttered out from under the
lid, and hovered in the air for a moment like wisps of pink mist. Gretel
shut the box with a snap, and tried to catch the floating Dreams with
her fingers. But it was too late. They floated higher and higher,
farther and farther, out of the window and over the hill.

"Oh, Eitel," cried Gretel, sobbing, "I have lost my Dreams--so many of
them--so many of them!"

"Well," said Eitel, "I don't see that there's much to cry about. They
were only pink fluff after all! I wouldn't cry about pink fluff if I
were you!"

So Eitel went out of the house whistling, and thinking that girls were
sometimes very silly; while Gretel carried her box upstairs, crying, and
thinking that boys were often very unkind. As soon as she was in her
room she opened her box again, and found to her great joy that it was
still half full of beautiful Dreams.

She soon made friends with Eitel again, but she never spoke to him any
more about her box of Dreams.

As the years went by Gretel became first a big girl and then a grown-up
woman, and still she had to work for her living. She lived in a good
many different places, sometimes with nice people and sometimes with
people who were not kind to her; but wherever she lived she had to scrub
and sweep, and get up early and go to bed late. She still kept her box
of Dreams safely in her little trunk, hidden under her Sunday frock.
Since the time that she had lost so many of her Dreams she had never
opened the box except when she was alone. She was afraid of losing some
more; and, besides, she did not like it when Eitel laughed at her and
called her pretty Dreams "nothing but pink fluff." So she made up her
mind to wait till her hair was really grey.

It seemed to her sometimes that this would never happen! Her hair was
browner than other people's, she thought, and was not going to turn grey
at all. But though the time seemed so long to her, she was as a matter
of fact still a young woman when she discovered that there were two grey
hairs growing among the brown ones. She was combing her hair at the
time, and the moment she saw the grey hairs she dropped the comb, and
clapping her hands for joy ran quickly to get her box of Dreams out of
her little trunk. She was so much excited that her trembling fingers
could hardly undo the fastenings of the box.

When the box was at last open she was still more excited. Her mother had
promised that she should be surprised, but she had not expected such a
strange and delightful and altogether wonderful surprise as this! You
could never guess what had happened! Her pretty rosy Dreams had all
turned into jewels more splendid than any you ever saw or heard about!
Every kind of precious stone was there--emeralds and pearls and fiery
opals, glowing rubies and sea-blue sapphires, besides a great many
strange stones whose names you have never heard.

Gretel gasped.

She sat on the floor beside the box, and stared and stared. She could
hardly believe that the glittering things were real, and she could not
believe at all that they belonged to her. At first she expected every
minute that they would disappear, and she was afraid to touch them; but
presently she took courage and lifted them out of the box one by one.
Then she took them to the light, and they looked still more beautiful
than before.

As Gretel sat on the floor near the window, with the many-coloured
jewels glimmering and shimmering in her lap, she came gradually to
understand that when her mother gave her the box of Dreams she gave her
great riches.

Gretel lived to be very old, but she never lost her jewels. She was able
now to show them to all the world without any danger of their flying
away, and as time went on the people flocked to see her and her jewels.
Eitel admired them as much as any one, but he could never be persuaded
that the fluffy pink things he had once seen had really turned into
these shining and wonderful stones.







I am going to tell you now about a fairy who lost one of his wings. His
home was in a white rosebud, which one would imagine to be a nice, safe,
comfortable home for a fairy to have. And yet it was while he was in the
white rosebud that the terrible accident happened which left him with
only one wing.

All would have been well if he had stayed in the country. But one day a
man came with scissors and snipped the white rosebud off the tree, and
packed it in cotton-wool, and sent it off to London. Of course the fairy
had to go too, and a very uncomfortable journey he had. There were a
number of other flowers packed in the same box, and in each flower there
was a fairy; so they were all able to grumble together. But you can't
grumble with any real comfort when you are packed very tightly, and have
to talk through a good deal of cotton-wool.

At last the journey was over, and the rosebud was taken out of the
cotton-wool and put in water. Then the fairy crept up from the heart of
the rosebud, and put his head over the edge of the petals and looked
about him.

There were flowers all round him: flowers in pots, flowers in glasses,
flowers lying on the table, flowers in baskets, and great bunches of
flowers in the big window. The truth was that the rosebud was in a
flower-shop, but he did not know this. He only knew that it was very
pleasant to be again in a place that was full of flowers and fairies.

He thought he was going to enjoy himself; but that was because he did
not know how cruelly fairies are sometimes treated in flower-shops. The
people who arrange the flowers have a horrible way of trying to kill the
fairies; and this is what they do. They take a dreadful, sharp piece of
wire and poke it through the very heart of the flower, and then fasten
it tightly round the stem! You will see at once that nothing is more
likely to hurt a fairy than this. Indeed, he would certainly be killed,
if it were not almost impossible to kill a fairy.

The little rosebud-fairy was lying comfortably curled up, deep down
among the white petals of the rose, when suddenly he saw coming through
the walls of his home a sharp glittering point!

"Oh dear!" he cried, trying to scramble out of the way.

But that was no use, the glittering point came nearer and nearer.

"Oh dear--oh dear!" he cried again. "Where is it coming to? Oh--it's
coming this way--the horrible thing. _Oh--oh--oh!_"

It was no wonder that he cried out. The dreadful wire had caught one of
his beautiful gossamer wings, and dragged it, and torn it, till there
was nothing left of it but some little shreds of fluttering gauze.

"What shall I do?" he wailed. "How can I fly with only one wing, and
what is the use of a fairy that can't fly? What shall I do?"

He picked up the torn pieces of his wing and wondered if he could mend
them. But he soon saw that it was impossible, so he folded them up
carefully and laid them inside the rose-petals; and ever afterwards
there was a faint tinge of pink deep down in the heart of the rosebud.

For a long time, long after the rosebud had been tied up with a sprig of
fern and put in the window, the poor little fairy went on moaning and
sighing over the loss of his wing. He was still sighing when a little
girl came into the shop. If the fairy had not been hiding among the
petals of his rosebud he would have seen at once that she was the kind
of little girl that the fairies always love; a little girl with bright
eyes and a laughing face--altogether a very nice little girl. She
pointed to the white rosebud and said--

"I want to buy that rosebud, please, for Granny's birthday."

In another minute she was walking along the street with the rosebud in
her fat hand.

Then the fairy crept up from the heart of the rose and looked over the
edge of the petals. The little girl saw him at once and was not at all
surprised.

"There you are!" she said. "I wondered when you would look out. Of
course I knew there was a fairy in the rosebud, or I wouldn't have
bought it. It would have been no use, you see."

"What a very nice little girl!" thought the fairy. "She seems to have a
great deal of sense."

The little girl went on: "Poor thing, I see your wing has been torn off.
That nearly always happens to the fairies that come from flower-shops.
But I dare say Granny won't mind. She sees very few fairies. I am going
to leave you at Granny's house because it is her birthday. Now remember,
you're to be very nice to Granny, because she sees so few fairies."

By this time they had reached Granny's house. Granny lived all alone in
a very splendid house in a great square. The house had a great many fine
things in it: handsome furniture and valuable china and grand silks and
brocades. But there was not a single fairy in it, and a house that has
no fairies in it is a very dull place.

Granny was sitting alone on her birthday. She looked round the great
drawing-room and thought there were a number of empty chairs and sofas
in it. That made her feel very lonely. No one had been to see her on her
birthday; she had had no presents or letters; no one had noticed her
birthday at all. If there had been any fairies in the house Granny would
not have felt so lonely, because the fairies are always good company.
But poor Granny had quite forgotten all about the fairies; it was so
long since she had seen any.

Then a footman brought the white rosebud into the room, with a message
from the little girl with the bright eyes and the nice laughing face.

Granny sat for a long time with the white rosebud on her knee. She felt
happier than she had been all day. She sat so still that the fairy
thought he might safely peep out and see what was going on. To his great
surprise Granny noticed him at once; he had not thought it at all likely
that she would see him, for she was not the kind of person who often
sees fairies. Probably she would not have seen him if she had not been
so sad and lonely.

"Why," she said, "it's a fairy! It is years since I saw a fairy. I
thought I should never see one again."

When the fairy saw that Granny was glad to see him, he crept out of the
rosebud and sat on her wrinkled hand, and talked to her.

"Poor little thing," said Granny, "you have lost one of your wings.
Well, it was not likely that any but a one-winged fairy would find his
way in here."

Then she sighed. So the fairy, to cheer her up, told her all about the
lovely garden he had left behind him in the country--the garden where he
had lived before the man with the scissors came to cut the rosebud. He
told her about the other roses and the fairies that lived in them, and
the tall hollyhocks whose fairies were so prim and old-fashioned, and
the sweet, shy love-in-a-mist whose fairies always wore veils when they
went out, and the sunflower-fairies who had never been taught that it
was rude to stare, and the dear unselfish verbena fairies who made the
world so sweet for other people and never thought of themselves. Then
Granny remembered all sorts of things that she had forgotten for
years--fairies she used to know when she was a little girl, and the
stories they used to tell her. She told some of the stories to the
rosebud fairy, and they talked together for a long time. Granny was
happier that evening than she had been for a great many evenings. She
said to herself that her birthday had been a very nice one after all.

"Won't you come and live with me?" she said.

The fairy looked round the room.

"Well," he said, "I should like to stay very much, but I really don't
see any place here for me to live. My rosebud will soon die and be
thrown away."

"But if I were to keep the rosebud always, even when it was dead? Would
you stay then?"

The fairy thought for a moment.

"I tell you plainly," he said, "that I don't like the idea of living in
a dead rosebud. But I know it's done sometimes, and one mustn't be too
particular when one has only one wing."

"I'll ask the little girl who brought you here to come and see you
often," said Granny, "and you and I will go out to-morrow and buy some
picture-books for her, and some chocolates, and then we shall all three
enjoy ourselves together."

The fairy nodded happily.

"That settles it," he said. "I'll stay."





If you spend all the year in a big town it is a fine thing to have a
summer holiday near the sea. Otherwise you never have a chance of making
friends with the sea-fairies or the mermaids, who are the most
delightful playmates in the world. You may know all kinds of other
fairies, and be quite intimate with them, but as long as you live
nothing can ever make up to you for not knowing the sea-fairies.

Little Michael was eight years old, and he had never met a sea-fairy,
for he lived in a great town. Then at last his father and mother and he
went off for a whole month to the seaside. There were sands there, very
hard and yellow and good to make castles with; and there were lonely
caves with dripping walls; and there were heaps of slimy, green seaweed,
and shells, and rocks for climbing on. Best of all, there were plenty of
fairies. Michael made friends with all the fairies of the sea and shore;
but his greatest and best friend was a Mermaid who lived in a cave.

The roof of the cave was wet and green, and its floor was pebbly, with
here and there a rock. Every day Michael came and sat on one of the
rocks and listened to the Mermaid's stories, and to the soft, lapping
sound of the little waves. The Mermaid told him such stories as he had
never heard before, for she had not always been in that cave, but had
swum in deep seas and lived on many shores. She told Michael of places
where the sea was warm and green, and the rocks were made of coral, and
palm-trees shaded the mermaids when they played upon the sands. She
told him too of bitter seas that were made of ice, so that no mermaid
could swim in them; and of towering icebergs shining in the sun; and of
white mist-fairies, who turned the hair of mermaids into a shower of
icicles. Then she told him of sailors who had been her friends, and how
some of them were sailing far away, and some of them were drowned, and
how all of them were good playmates.

While Michael listened to these stories his eyes were very round and
wide open, and often his mouth was open too. He had never enjoyed
anything so much before, and he thought it would be dreadful when the
day came for him to leave the dancing sea-fairies and the Mermaid's
cave, and go back to the big town where he hardly ever saw any fairies
at all. One day he said--

"Mermaid dear, I want something to take back to town with me; something
to make me remember the sea-fairies and you, and to make me think of the
sea for ever and ever."

"Tell me what you want," said the Mermaid, smiling; "and if I can get it
for you, I will."

"Well," said Michael, "it's rather a big thing I was thinking of.
Perhaps it's too big to ask for. But you see the Bay is full of
white-horses to-day. Do you think you could possibly catch one for me? I
think if I could take home a white-horse from the Bay, I should remember
the sea for ever and ever."

The Mermaid slipped off her rock and dived into the deep water. A few
moments afterwards Michael saw her far out in the Bay, with her hair
floating in the wind, and her tail glittering under the waves. There
were a great many wind-fairies playing about that morning, and that was
the reason that the Bay was full of white-horses, for when the
wind-fairies are playing on the sea they always ride white-horses.

Michael climbed a high rock and stood on the very top of it, and watched
the Mermaid. It was grand to see her gliding through the water, chasing
first one white-horse and then another, diving and darting and dodging,
and enjoying herself all the time.

"Quick, quick!" cried Michael. "You nearly had him that time!"

But she was not quick enough, for the white-horse was far out of reach
even as she threw out her white arms to catch his mane.

The chase lasted a long time, for though mermaids can swim better than
most people, a white-horse on the sea is one of the hardest things to
catch. At last, however, Michael clapped his hands and shouted--

"She's got him, she's got him! Hurrah--now I shall have a white-horse to
take home with me, and to make me think of the sea for ever and ever!"

If it had been a fine sight to see the Mermaid chasing the white-horse
across the Bay, it was far finer to see them come prancing back again.
The Mermaid was not swimming this time, but riding on the back of the
angry white-horse, who plunged and galloped across the Bay, tossing his
long mane. And the Mermaid tossed her golden hair and laughed, because
she was enjoying her ride. Michael laughed aloud too, because when the
white mane and the golden hair streamed up together upon the wind they
were very beautiful to see.

And now a very curious and unfortunate thing happened. The wind-fairies
suddenly grew tired and went to sleep, every one of them. Now when the
wind-fairies go to sleep, the white-horses always dive down below the
sea and go to sleep too. Before the Mermaid had reached the shore she
was swimming again, for her white-horse had suddenly disappeared and
left her with nothing to ride. He had gone to sleep below the sea until
the next time the wind-fairies wanted to play.

"Oh, Mermaid dear," cried Michael, "what have you done with my nice new
horse?"

"I am very sorry to tell you," said the Mermaid, lying down on the sand
to rest herself, "that he has gone below the sea to sleep. It is really
most unfortunate, but when a white-horse wants to sleep you can't stop
him."

"Oh dear, oh dear," said Michael piteously, for it was a great
disappointment. "I did so much want to have a white-horse to make me
think of the sea for ever and ever."

"Wouldn't anything else do instead?" asked the Mermaid, who was very
kind.

Then Michael noticed that every time a little wave reached the shore it
broke on the rocks in a shower of coloured jewels. He pointed to them.

"Bring me some of those, please, Mermaid dear," he said.

So the Mermaid took a large shell, shaped like a saucer, and waited on a
rock till a little wave came in and sprinkled the rock with jewels. She
held out her shell to catch the jewels, but as soon as they touched the
shell they changed into water.

"Look," she said to Michael, "the jewels have melted."

"Oh dear," said Michael, "what am I to do? I am going back to town
to-morrow, and I have nothing to remind me of the sea!"

"Do you really and truly wish to think of the sea for ever and ever?"
asked the Mermaid.

"Of course I do," said Michael.

"Then I will sing you the Sea Song," said the Mermaid, "and after that
there will be nothing that can make you forget the sea."

So while Michael sat on the rock and looked at the sea, the Mermaid sang
him the Sea Song, which mermaids have sung to sailors ever since the
first ship was built. It is a song that no one ever forgets. It is like
the voice of the sea calling, calling; and there are many people who
hear it always, even in their dreams. If they are people who have to
live in towns, or in country places far from the sea, they are not very
happy.

When the Mermaid had finished singing, she said--

"Now I have given you something that will make you think of the sea for
ever and ever."

The next day Michael went back to town. He took with him the sound of
the Sea Song; and for ever afterwards he heard the voice of the sea
calling, calling, even in his dreams.

That was why he became a sailor when he was old enough.




  


PREFACE 



These books are intended to interest children in 
country life. They are written in the simplest language, 
so as to be fit for each class to read aloud. But 
the information given in them requires explanation 
and illustration by the teacher. I have, in fact, tried 
to make each lesson the groundwork for oral teaching, 
in the course of which the children should be en- 
couraged to observe, to bring in specimens, and to ask 
questions. Then when the chapter is read and re-read, 
as is the case with most school books, it will become 
part of the child's own knowledge. 

No one can be more aware than I am how very 
slight these outlines arc, and how much more might 
have been given if space permitted. But I hope that 
rnuch is suggested, and a teacher who loves nature 
will fill in the gaps. 

The charming illustrations will enable the children 
to identify the animals and plants mentioned.

We three friends, Peter, Peggy, and Paul, 
walk to school together every day. We all 
love flowers and animals, and each day we try 
to find something new. 

Peter is a little boy. He can only just read. 
But he has sharp eyes. He sees most things 
in the hedges. Peggy's father is a gamekeeper. 
She knows the birds and where to find their 
nests. Paul comes from the farm. He is a big 
boy and will soon be a teacher. 

We meet at the big pond under the elm 
trees. Then we walk along a narrow lane, 
across the common, through the wood, and over 
three fields to the village school. 

In the pond we find all kinds of creatures. 
In the lane are beetles and mice, flowers and 
berries, biids' nests and wasps' nests. On the 




common the spiders spin their webs on the 
yellow gorse. In the ploughed field the lark 
hides her nest. In the grass field there are 
buttercups and daisies. In the cornfield there 
are poppies and cornflowers. 

Paul is going to write down for us aU we 
see and put it in a book. 

 

When we cross the common on a fine summer 
morning, we see many spiders' webs sparkling 
in the sun. The webs on the gorse bushes are 
round. They are fastened to the gorse prickles 
by long silk threads, and each web has spokes 
like a wheel. These spokes are joined together 
with rings of silk. There are drops of gum all 
over the rings. It is these drops which sparkle 
like diamonds, and make the web so pretty. 

The spider spins a little tent in the centre of 
the web. In this tent she hides, till some insect 
flies against the gummy threads. Then she feels 
the web shake, and darts out to catch the fly 
before it breaks the threads. 

We saw a little bee to-day fly right against 
the web on the gorte bush. Out came the 
spider from her tent. She bit the bee with her 
sharp fangs, tore off its wings, and then sat and 
sucked the juice out of its bodv. 




Paul caught her, while she was busy, and 
showed us the two fangs with sharp points, 
which hang down in front of her head. Above 
them are her eight eyes, four large ones and four 
small ones. She has eight legs with such 
strange claws ! Each one is like a comb. 
What do you think they are- for ? She uses 







them to guide the silk threads as she makes her 
web. 

We turned her on her back and saw, undei 
her body, six little pockets, out of which she 
pulls the silk. It comes out through tiny holes. 
She draws it through the combs on her legs, 
and so makes her web as she runs along. 

Besides the webs on the gorse, there are 
webs all over the common close to the ground 
These are not made with spokes like the round 




webs. The threads are mixed up Hke wool. 
For a long time we could not find the spider= 
At last one day Paul said, " Here is a hole right 
in the middle of the web. It goes down into 
the ground." 

This hole was lined with silk threads. Just 
then a beetle crawled on to the web, and shook 
it. At once the spider darted out from the 

tunnel in the 
ground and seized 
the beetle. She 
was so quick that 
she had carried 
him down into 

HUNTING SPIDER WITH HER

EGO-BAG. could catch her. 

There are many spiders on the common 
which do not spin webs, though they hang from 
a thread. They spring on the flies and beetles 
on the ground, and are called "hunting-spiders." 

The mother hunting-spiders carry their eggs 
about with them in a round bag. Peter caught 
one of these as she was running along with this 
white ball under her body. He took the ball 
away and put it on the ground. When he let 
her go, she ran up and seized it. He took it 
away three times. Each time she caught it 
up again, and at last ran away before we could 
catch her. 






We were lying under the shade of the trees 
in the wood one afternoon. All was very quiet, 
when suddenly we heard such a strange cry. 
It was like someone laughing, " Yafhl, Yaffil, 
Yaffil." "That is the woodpecker," said Peggy. 
" Wait and see what he will do." 

80 we lay quite still under the tree. Soon 
the sound came nearer, and a great heavy bird, 
bigger than a large thrush, flew towards us. He 
was a beautiful bird. His wings were green, and 
so was his breast. He had yellow on his tail. 
His head was red, and he had a red streak on 
his throat. His beak was long and grey. 

He came quite close to us, hopping along. 
Then he stopped, and a long shining tongue 
came out of his mouth, and went back so 
quickly that we could scarcely see it. 

" He is eating ants," said Peggy. " The tip 
of his tongue is sticky and he draws them into 
his mouth." 

Then he began to climb the tree so funnily. 
His tail is jquite stiff and wiry, and he bent it 
against the tree, and pushed himself up, jump, 
jump, holding on with his sharp hooked toes. 
He jumped first to the right, then to the left* 
Then he ran round the tree and came out on tjfie 
oth«r side. 





All the while he was trying the hark with his 
beak. Tap, tap, tap. At last he found a soft 
spot. Then he tore off the bark and ate the 
grubs, which had made the tree rotten in that 
place. After this he came down tlie tree 
again. 

It was so funn}^ to see him. He came down 
backwards tail first, using it to steady himself. 
Then he spread his wings and flew slowly 
away. 

We crept after him, and bj^-and-by he 
stopped at an old elm tree and flew round it. 
Then we could see no more of him. : ? 

" His nest must be in this tree," said Peter. 
" Give me a back, Paul, and I will soon find 
it." 

So Paul let Peter climb on his back till he 
could reach the branches of the tree. Then 
Peter caught hold of the boughs, and crept 
round the trunk. 

" Here it is," he cried at last " There is a 
small hole, just big enough for a bird to creep 
in. But they have made such a big hole inside 
the tree. I can only just reach down." 

Then Peter drew his hand back with the 
mother bird in it. Her head was not so red 
as the father's, and she had no red whiskers. 
He let her fly away, and then pulled out six 
white shining eggs. 





I can feel a number of soft chips of wood at 
 the bottom of the 
hole," said he. 
''Shall I put the 



eggs back?" 

" Of course,'' 
said Paul ; " then 
the mother will fly 
back and sit on 
them, and we will 
come again and see 
the little birds when 
they are hatched." 

So we went 
away. But every 
day, as we came 
from school, we 
turned aside to see if the 
little woodpeckers had 
come out of their shells. 
At last one day we saw 
the old woodpeckers carry- 
ing insects into the hole. 






After some time we saw 
the young birds out on 
the tree. They could not 
fly. But they ran about 

the branches, and jumped so funnily with their 

stiff tails. 




A week later we saw them flying about, and 
when we came again they were all gone. Peter 
climbed up and found the nest quite empty. 


We are always glad when April comes. Then 
we can find many flowers on our way to school. 
Even in February there are snowdrops in the 
orchard, and Peter knows where he can some- 
times find a primrose or violet in flower. 

But we cannot get a good bunch till April. 
Before that the plants are busy growing their 
leaves. 

The first bright flowers we find are the 
daffodils in the fields, and the anemones in 
the woods. We call the daffodils "Lent lilies" 
and we put them in the church at Easter. 
They have very long, narrow leaves which come 
straight out of the ground. Each flower hangs 
on its own tall stalk. It has a deep yellow 
tube in the middle, with a crown of pale yellow 
leaves round it. If you dig up a daffodil plant 
you will find that it has a bulb like an onion. 
Paul says this is why it blooms so early. It 
stores up food in the bulb in the autumn. Then 
it uses this food in January to make its leaves 
and flowers. 

The wood - anemone is Peggy's favourite 








flower. It is called the '' wind-flower " because 
it nods so prettily in the wind. Its soft pink 
and white flower stands high up on a long stalk, 

which has three 
feathery green 
leaves half-way 
down. When 
the sun shines, 
it is a little pink 
and white cup, 
but when the 
clouds gather 
and the rain 
falls, it shuts up 
in a tight bud, 
till sunshine 
comes again. 

Peggy once 
bit one of the 
leaves of the anemone. It 
burnt her tongue and tasted 
T ery bitter. Then Paul told 
us that the plant is poi- 
sonous. This is one reason 
why there are so many 
anemones in the wood. 
Animals will not eat the leaves, but leave them 
alone to grow. 

The anemone has not got a bulb. It has a 




thick brown stem under the ground in which it 
stores its food. 

Before the daffodils and anemones are over, 
the primroses and violets cover the banks. It is 
pretty to watch the primrose plant on a wet 
morning. The leaves are not smooth. They 
have hills and valleys all along them. The 
water runs so cleverly down the valleys of the 
leaf. These guide it down to the roots, so that 
the plant can drink. 

How busy, too, the bees and flies are. They 
jettle first on one primrose, then on another. 
We know what they find there. If you pull off 
the yellow crown of the primrose, and suck the 
end of the tube, you will taste something sweet. 
This is the honey that the bees come to find. 
And besides the honey they carry off some 
yellow dust from flower to flower. Paul says 
that this is good for the flowers, as we shall 
learn some day. 

The honey in the violets is not so easy to 
find. But we have found it. When a violet 
looks straight at you, it shows five purple leaves 
and a little yellow beak in the middle. But if 
you look behind, you will find a small long bag, 
like the finger of a glove. We have often pulled 
this off and sucked it. It is full of honey. When 
the bee sits on the flower, and thrusts her head 
into the yeUow beak in the middle, she sips out 




the toney with her tongue from the bag or spur 
behind the flower. 

With primroses and violets and blue-hells 
the bees can now find plenty of ho'aey to fil? 
their hives. 


We have a pet called Bobby, and we love him 
very much. He is a little squirrel, living among 
the beech trees of the wood. 

We see him every morning leaping from 
branch to branch, with his long furry tail 
stretched out behind. Sometimes he leaps right 
down on to the ground and runs about picking 
up beech nuts. 

Sometimes he sits bolt upright on a branch, 
with a nut or acorn in his paws. Then his tail 
is bent up against his back. 

We have known him for two years, and when 
we whistle to him he comes to us. But if any- 
thing frightens him he darts away to the nearest 
tree. He climbs up in a moment with his sharp 
claws, and peeps back through the green leaves 
We see his bright black eyes looking down at 
us. 

His back is covered with a brown red fur, 
but under his body the fur is white. His lovely 
red tail is like a brush on his back. His hind 




legs are long. That is why he can jump so well. 
On his front paws one toe stands out from the 
others, almost like our thumb. He uses his 
paws like hands, when he sits up with a nut in 
them, and peels off the brown skin with his 
teeth. 

Sometimes he steals birds' eggs. Then he 
holds the egg in his paws, cracks the top, and 
sucks out the yolk. 

He has such funny ears ! They have long 
tufts of hair behind them He sometimes comes 
out of his hole in winter to eat, and we see that 
the tufts are much longer then than in summer. 

But for most of the winter we never see him. 
He is fast asleep in a hole in a tree. We know 
where his hole is, for Peter found it once. He 
had seen Bobby come down one mild day to feed 
on his store of acorns, buried at the foot of the 
tree, and he watched him as he went back. Then 
he climbed up the tree, and in a hole in the trunk 
he saw Bobby's bushy tail curled round. So he 
knew that Bobby was snag a,nd cosy in the hole. 

Bobby has a little wife, and they always 
keep near each other. But she is very shy, and 
will not come to us. In the spring, when there 
are no nuts, they eat the buds of the trees. 

About May they are very busy. They gather 
leaves, and moss, and twigs. These they weave 
into a nest in a fork of the tree, far from the 




ground. Tlien in June their little ones are born, 
Paul climbed up and saw four such lovely little 
squirrels, covered with soft red and white fur. 
They stayed in the nest for some time, though 
we often saw them moving about among the 
branches. The old squirrels took such care of 
them, and they stayed together all the summer. 
In the autumn they hid little heaps of nuts and 
acorns at the foot of the tree, to eat when they 
should awake in the mild days in winter. 

Then we did not see them again. We do not 
know whether they all crept into one hole, or 
whether they each found a hole, and curled 
themselves up to sleep. 



Theee are a great many larks near our home. 
They sing so gaily in the morning as we go to 
school. But they sing much earlier than that. 

We wanted once to try if we could get up 
before the lark. So we agreed to meet at five 
o'clock in the morning, in the meadow where 
one has been singing all this year. We heard 
him before we got out of the lane. There he 
was, rising up into the air, going a little to the 
right, and then a little to the left, rising and 
singing all the time, as if he wanted to wake all 
the world with joy. 





We watched him till he was quite a tiny 
speck in the sky. Then he came down again. 
When he was only a few feet from the ground 
le shut his wings and dropped into the grass. 

The next morning we went at four o'clock, 
That lark was not singing, but one in the next 
field was rising up as gay as a lark could be. 
Then our mothers said we must not get up 
any earlier. So we could not rise before the 
larks. 

We caught a lark once to look at it, and then 
let it fly away again. It is not a gay bird. It 
has brown wings marked with dark streaks. 
Its breast and throat are a dull white, dotted 
with brown spots, and it has a white streak 
above its eye. Its feet are curious. The toes lie 
flat on the ground, and the hind toe has a very 
long claw. If you watch a lark you will see 
that he runs, he does not hop. Neither does he 
perch in the trees, and only sometimes on a low 
bush. He lives on the ground, except when he 
rises up to sing. 

In the winter, as we go to school, we see large 
flocks of larks in the fields, looking for insects, 
and seeds of wheat and oats. When we come 
near them, they get up, a few at a time, and fly 
away a little further. Then they wheel round 
and settle down to feed. 

In the winter thej'' scarcely ever sing. It 



i 






is in the spring, when they pair, that they sing 
so beautifully- 

About March we can often find a lark's nest 
hidden in the 
grass. They 
build in a rut, 
or a little hollow 
in the ground, 
often in the 
middle of the 
field. They line 
the nest with 
dry grass, and 
lay four or five 
eggs in it. The 
eggs are a dirty 
grey colour with 
brown spots on 
them, and they 
lie very snugly 
in the thick 
tufts of grass. 

When the lark comes down after singing he 
does not drop close to the nest but a little way 
off. Then he runs up to the nest through the 
grass. This is because he is afraid that the 
sparrow-hawk might see the nest, and pounce on 
the little ones. 

The sparrow-hawk is the lark's great enemv. 




One day we were looking at a lark rising up, and 
all at once we saw a sparrow-liawk just going to 
pounce upon it. The lark saw him too, and 
darted up faster than the hawk could soar. Then 
the hawk flew away a little and hovered about 
till the lark was tired and was obliged to come 
down. Then once more the hawk tried to 
pounce. But the lark was too clever for him. 
He closed his wings and dropped right down 
into the thick grass, and the hawk could not 
find him. We were glad the little lark was safe, 
and got back to his wife and little ones. 

 

We pass through a small nut-wood on our way 
to school. In the winter, when there are no 
leaves on the trees, we see the grey clusters 
which we call "lambs-tails" hanging on the 
nut-bushes, Paul says their real name is " cat- 
kins." 

We often look at them to see how they grow. 
At first they are only like little grey buds on the 
branch. Then they grow larger and hang down. 
By degrees they become very loose, like tassels, 
and under the grey scales come some little bags 
of yellow dust . 

Then in March, still before the leaves are on 


the trees, the wind shakes the tree and blows the 
yellow dust about. 

. By this time we find small flowers, grow- 
ing near the end of the branches. You have to 
look well to find them. But they are very 
pretty. Each flower has two tiny red horns, 
and there are many flowers in one green 
cup. 

We know that these red flowers grow into 
nuts, for we find the nuts just in that place in 
September. When the wind blows the yellow 
dust out of the lambs- tails, some of it falls on 
the red horns of the flowers, and this makes the 
nut grow. 

In the autumn we look out well to see when 
the nuts are ripe. We want to get some before 
the Squirrels, and the little birds called Nut- 
hatches, carry them all away. 

Peggy is in such a hurry that she picks them 
sometimes before they are ripe. This is foolish, 
for then there is only a very small watery kernel 
inside. The rest of the shell is filled mth white 
soft stuff. 

Paul says this white stuff is the food which 
the nut uses to make itself large and firm. 
When the nuts are ripe they drop quite easily 
out of the brown leafy cup in which they sit. 

Sometimes when we pick the nuts we find 
one with a little hole in the shell. Then we 



know that the nut is a bad one, and we shall 

most likely find a maggot inside. 

It is so curious ! Paul tells us that this 

maggot is a young beetle. 

It does not look like one. 

But many beetles when 

they are young have no 

legs and are only grubs. 
This nut-beetle is 

called a Weevil. When 

the nut is quite young and soft, the mother 

weevil comes and lays an eg^ in it. She is a 

very small beetle and has a long snout. With 

her snout she makes a hole in the soft green 

nutshell, and then la3^s a tinj egg in the hole. 

By-and-by the egg hatches into a maggot. 

It grows fat by 
feeding on the 
nut. So when 
we gather it, 
the nut is half 
eaten, and the 
maggot is 
curled up 







in- 



side. 



If we had not picked the nut, the maggot 
would have eaten a large hole in the nutshell 
with its horny mouth, and then have crept out 
ot its mao^crot skin as a little weevil with wings. 



So the yellow dust and the red flowers make 
nuts. Some of these nuts we get. Some the 
squirrels get. Some the nuthatch gets. Some 
fall to the ground and grow up into young nut 
trees, and some the weevil grub gets, before 
they are ripe. 



Peteb has a fine old cat. She is very clever. 
She rattles the handle of the front door when 
she wants to come in. If she comes home very 
late at night she jumi3s on the wire which runs 
along the garden wall. This rings a bell, and 
Peter comes down and lets her in. 

But in one thing she is very stupid. She 
cannot learn that a shrew and a mouse are not 
the same kind of animal. We are glad when 
she catches the mice in the garden and in the 
field. For the mice eat our peas and the bulbs 
of our crocuses. They hide in the corn-ricks 
and eat the wheat and oats. 

But shrews eat insects and worms and slugs, 
and this is good for us, because insects and 
slugs eat our plants. 

It is so silly of Pussy, for she ought to know. 
When she has killed them, she does know them 
apart, for she eats a mouse and Hkes it, but 
she will not eat the sh?'ew. She only kills it 





ana leaves it lying on the path. We think she 
kills it because it runs away ; and does not eat 
it because it has a bad smell. 

A great many people do not 
know a 

mouse
from
shrew, 

for they are very 
much alike. A 
shrew is not 
qijite so large as 
a field-mouse, 
and a little 
larger than 
the dear little 
harvest-mouse, 
which makes a 
round nest of 
dry grass among  

the corn-stalks. 

We found one of these 
nests last summer. It was 
about as big as a large 
swan's egg, and the same 
shape. We peeped inside 
and found seven wee little harvest-mice, with, 
red-brown fur on their backs and white fui 
underneath. 




The shrew is more of a grey colour. But 
there is one way by which you can always tell a 
mouse from a shrew. The mouse has a short 
snout and four broad white teeth in front. It 
uses these for gnawing roots and bulbs, and 
biting the ears of corn. 

But the shrew has a long, thin snout, and it^ 
Grown teeth are very small and pointed, so that 
it can kill and eat insects, worms, and snails. 

Shrews and mice are both very busy in the 
evening. We go out sometimes to watch them 
when the moon is shining. The mice run along 
so fast out into the field and back to the hedge. 
Paul says they are carrying seeds and bits of 
roots into their hole in the bank. For they 
know that they will want food when they wake 
up in the winter, and there is none to be found. 
The shrews move more quietly under the hedge. 
They push their long snouts into the thick 
grass, and eat the earwigs and caterpillars. 

Both the mice and the shrews are very much 
afraid of the Barn Owl, which comes out at 
night and carries them away in her sharp claws 
to feed her young owls. 

Shrews do not store up food, for they sleep 
in a hole in the bank all the winter through. 
Then in the spring they line the hole with soft 
dry grass, and there the mother brings up five or 
six little shrews. 





The mouse, too, burrows deep into the bank. 
She lays up a nice store of food and goes to 
sleep. But she often wakes and has a feed, and 
goes to sleep again. She brings up a great 
many families in a year. This is why there are 
many mice. 



There is a big ant-hill in the wood on the way 
to school. It is at the foot of the old oak tree, 
near the path, and is almost as tall as Peter. 
It looks like a loose heap of leaves, mixed with 
sticks and earth. It is broad at the bottom, and 
round at the top. 

When we come home in the evening aU is 
quiet on the ant-hill. We cannot see even 
one ant outside. It looks as if no one lived 
there. But when we pass in the morning, and 
the sun is warm and bright, we can see the ants 
creeping out of the cracks and running about 
the heap. 

They are as big as a grain of barley, and have 
a tiny knob in the middle of their body. They 
have long feelers and strong jaws. They bite 
hard if you touch them. But they do not sting 
with their tails, as our house ants do. 

At dinner-time we find them still more busy. 
They have opened many holes in the hill, and 




hurry to and fro. Some fetch hits of leaves and 
sticks, and add them to the heap. Others bring 
in food. One day Paul saw a number of ants 
pulling a dead worm to pieces. Then each ant 
carried a tiny bit in her jaws to the hillj and went 
in at a hole. 

Sometimes the ants bring some little white 
lumps in their mouths out of the hill. Peggy's 
father, the gamekeeper, gives these white lumps 
to his birds to eat. He calls them ant-eggs. 
But Paul says they are not eggs. They are 
baby ants shut up in silk bags, and thej^ are 
called " cocoons." 

Keal ant-eggs are much smaller. When the 
baby ant comes out of the egg it is blind and 





has no legs. It is called a grub. The nursing 
ants feed it with honey, and it puts a silk thread 
out of its mouth and spins a bag round itself. 
When the bag is done, the nurses cannot feed 




the grub any more. So they take care of it. 
They carry it up to the sunshine by day, and 
down below at ni^ht. Inside the bag, the gmb 



grows into a real ant, with eyes and legs. Then 
the nurses help it out of its prison, and it begins 
work. 

One day Paul poked a hole in the ant-hill 
with his stick. We saw in the ground, under 
the leaves, a hollow place full of white cocoons. 
The ants were very angry. Some bit us, others 
picked up the cocoons in their jaws and ran 
away, for fear we should hurt their babies. 

When we came back in the evening the ants 
had mended the hill. Every hole was closed, 
and all the cocoons were safe inside. 




 

One day in summer we saw a number of ants 
with wings, flying over the ant-hill. Paul says 
these are the father and mother ants. The antp 
without wings are the nurses and workers. 




Last March, when the days began to be warm, we 
saw a big Humble Bee, or Bumble Bee, as the 
little ones call it, buzzing along across the field. 

"Look out, Peter," said Peggy; "that is a 
mother humble bee, who has been asleep all the 
winter. She must be making a nest." So Peter 
followed her. She flew to a bank, and went in 
among some tufts of grass. Peter put a large 
stick there, and we went to see her every day. 

We used to find her dragging in little piecey 
of moss. But we did not look in, for fear she 
should go away. After a fortnight Paul said we 
might look, and, hidden in the grass, we found a 
small round patch of moss lined with bees -wax. 




It was like a tiny saucer turned upside down. 
We lifted it up and found under it a few round 
Eat pockets, some as big as a halfpenny, some 
not larger than a farthing. They were made of 
brown, sticky wax, and when we opened one we 




found inside seven tiny eggs, as small as poppy 
seeds, and some little brown balls. The balls, 
Paul said, were made of honey, and of the 
yellow dust from flowers. In another pocket we 
found grubs which had already been hatched 
from eggs. These were feeding on the brown 
balls near them. 

The mother bee was very uneasy while we 
were looking at her nest. She sat down quite 





near. We could see how big and stout she was. 
She was so handsome. Her brown body was 
covered with soft yellow^ hairs, with stripes of 
black hairs between. Her wings were broad, 
and shone so brightly in the sun. She did not 
stiDg- us. Paul says that humble bees are very 
gentle But she was afraid we should hurt the 
grubs, which were going to grow up into work- 
ing bees. We put the cover back and waited 
two months. Then it was June. We were 
afraid the horses might tread on the nest when 
the hay was cut. So we went to look at it. 

Oh ! how big it was now. There was a large 
round moss roof. It was lined with wax, and 
was so strong that we had to cut it with a knife. 
The only way for the bees to get into it was by 
a long tunnel just under the ground. Under 
the roof were a number of dirty yellow silk 
cocoons. In these were the grubs, growing into 
humble bees. The cocoons were stuck together 
with wax. Some of them were open, for the young 
bees had come out. These had honey in them. 

There w^ere a great many humble bees going 
in and out. These had all come from eggs 
laid by the mother bee in two months. They 
were very busy bringing in honey and bee- 
bread for the grubs to eat. But Paul says they 
do not store honey, like our hive-bees. For 
when the cold damp weather comes, they aU 




die, except a few mothers. These creep into 
holes ill the trees or into a warm haystack, and 
sleep till the spring comes again. 

Ahout Christmas time we went to look at the 
nest. The roof was hroken, and the cells all 
crushed. There was not one humble bee to be 
found. 


Peter's cat is very fond of going into the wood. 
We are afraid she will be killed some day. For 
Peggy's father shoots all the cats he finds in the 
wood, because they eat the rabbits and pheasants. 

But Peter cannot keep her at home. As 
soon as it gets dusk, she slips out, aud often does 
not come home all night. She goes in the 
dusk, because then all the animals are feeding. 
So she can catch mice and young rabbits, as well 
as partridges asleep on the ground, and other 
birds in the trees. 

She is a very clever hunter. Her body is so 
well made for catching her prey. She is slender, 
but very strong. She can kill a mouse with one 
stroke of her paw. She can spring ever so far, 
and so quickly that few mice or birds can escape 
her. 

Then she has soft pads under her feet, so 
that she can creep along very quietly. And she 









can jump down from a high wall because the soft 
pads keep her feet from being hurt when she 
reaches the ground. 

We all know what sharp claws she has at 
the end of her toes. But when she is playing 
with her kitten or with Peter, her paw is so 
soft you would not 
think she could 
scratch. This is be- 
cause she has a groove 
in each toe under the 
skin, and when she 
does not want her 
claws, she draws each 
one back into its own 
sheath. 

But when she springs on a mouse or a bird, 
she strikes with her paw, and as she bends her 
toes, out come the claws and pierce the flesh of 
her prey. 

But how does she see the rats and mice in 
the night ? Paul showed us that she can open 
the middle of her eye very wide in the dark. 
We took pussy near to the lamp and saw that 
the hole or " pupil" of her eye was only a little 
narrow slit Then we shut her up in a dark 
room for some minutes, and took her outside 
and looked at her eyes in the moonlight. The 
little slit had become a large round black hole. 






The slit lets in enough light for pussy to see 
in the daytime, and vjhen she goes out at night 
the slit stretches out into a big round hole which 
lets in all the light there is, from the moon or 
the stars. 

But if it is very dark indeed, she feels hei 
way with her whiskers. Paul says it 
is very cruel to cut a cat's whiskers, 
for they are a great help to her in 
the dark. 

Pussy has a very rough tongue- 
If you let her lick your hand, you 
will feel how different it is from 
your own tongue, or that of a dog. 
It is so rough that she can rasp the 
scraps of meat off a bone, after she 
has torn away the flesh with her long pointed 
front teeth. 

Pussy is very clever in getting her living, 
and if you look at her head you will see why. 
For she has a good broad forehead with plenty 
of room inside for a large brain. We put a 
rabbit's head near hers the. other day. It was 
so narrow, and had so little room for a brain, 
we were not surprised that the cat is too 
cunning for him. 

Who would think that Pussy, who sits and 
purrs with her kitten by the fire, is so fierce in 
the wood ^ But Paul savs that there were once 




wild cats in Scotland and the north of England, 
and they were as fierce as tigers. Tigers and cats 
are very much alike. Tigers can be loving too. 
We heard a tiger purr one day in a wild beast 
show, when she was licking her cub. 

It was the middle of April this year when we 
first heard the cuckoo. We love to hear it, for 
it tells us that spring has come. This year we 
were very lucky. We saw a young cuckoo grow 
up in his nest. 

This was how it happened. 

We had heard the cuckoo for some time, 
cuck-oo, cuck-oo, and it seemed as if many 
cuckoos were singing. One day we heard such 
a funny noise, like kik-kik-kik. " Ah ! " said 
Peggy, "father says that is the cry of the 
mother cuckoo which lays the eggs. That is 
why there are so many cuckoos about. They 
are singing to her." 

"Well then," said Peter, "if she stops here, 
perhaps we may find one of her eggs. I do s( 
want to see a young cuckoo." 

About a week after this Peter found a tit- 
lark's * nest. It was in a tuft of grass, on the 

* Now called a " Pipit." But country children know it ag 
the " Titlark." 




bank, near the wood. Two small dull-grey eggs, 
spotted with brown, were lying in the nest. 
The next day, as we went to school, there were 
three eggs. The next morning there were four. 
But as we came back from school that afternoon 
there were five eggs. 

" The titlark cannot have laid two eggs in 
one day," said Peter. " I wonder if the cuckoo 
has brought one of her eggs here." 

For we know that the cuckoo lays her eggs 
on the ground, and brings it in her wide beak to 
the nest of some other bird. We looked every 
day for a fortnight. The little titlark was so 
used to our coming, she did not even fly off the 
nest. She was a pretty little bird, with brown 
spotted wings and a yellow throat and chin. 

At the end of a fortnight two little titlarks 
came out of their shells, and the next day two 
more. They opened their beaks for food, and 
the father titlark flew out to the field, and 
brought flies and caterpillars to feed them. But 
the mother still sat on the fifth egg. 

Two days later the fifth bird came out. It 
had a curved beak, and bent toes with short, 
sharp claws. Its toes were two in front and two 
at the back. Titlarks have straight beaks and 
flat toes, three in front and one at the back. 

So we knew our young cuckoo by his beak 
and toes. 




We came next day to look. The little tit- 
larks had quills on their wings where the 
feathers were growing, and their eyes were open. 
The cuckoo was naked and blind. But he had 
pushed two of the titlarks out of the nest, and 
they lay on the bank quite dead. 

The cuckoo had grown bigger 
Dven in one day, 
and the old tit- 
larks kept feed- 
ing him with 
insects as he sat 
with his beak 
wide open. 
While we were 
booking at him, 
the cuckoo 
pushed about in 
bhe nest and 
shoved another little titlark over the edge, on 
fco the bank. We put it back in the nest and 
then we had to go on to school. When we 
came back the cuckoo sat in the nest alone. 
All the four little titlarks were dead on the 
bank. He had pushed them all out. 

The old birds did not seem to see their dead 
children They were so busy feeding the big 
hungry stranger. They fed him for five or six 
weeks, even after he could come out of the nest. 





It was so fanny to see I The cuckoo was  arger than a thrush and the titlarks not bigger 
than a sparrow. Yet the big bird sat on a 
branch with his beak open, and let these Uttle 
birds carry all his food. 

At last he flew away. We heard a cuckoo 
singing in August, when we knew the old birds 
were all gone. We wondered if it was our 
young ''greedy stranger." 



There were so many moles in the barn field last 
summer. We used to see mole heaps thrown up 
all over the field. At last Paul's father sent for 
the mole-catcher. He put traps in the runs and 
brought in many dead moles. 

A mole is a curious creature. We country 
children call him a " wunt." He has a long, 
plump body and a short, stumpy tail. His dark 
brown fur is like velvet, it is so soft and close. 
He has a long, pointed snout, very hard at the 
tip, and his mouth is full of strong, sharp teeth. 

His feet are very curious. They have no fur 
on them, but are naked and pink. His front 
paws are like broad flat hands with very strong 
claws. They turn away from his body, and look 
too big for such a small, soft creature. 

Paul says these paws are the mole's shovels. 



He lives under the ground and catches worms tc 
eat. As he goes along he makes a hole with his 
hard nose, and then shovels away the earth with 
his strong hands. In this way he makes a tunnel, 
and when he wants to get rid of the loose earth 
he pokes it above ground with his snout. This is 
how the mole-hills are made. 



But the moles do not always stay under the 
ground. We have seen them sometimes on a 
warm summer's evening poking about in the 
hedges, looking for slugs and snails. There are 
more he-moles than she- moles. 

We wanted so much to find a mole's home. 
We dug down below some of the mole-hills 
hoping to find one, but we only found a tunnel. 
The mole-catcher laughed at us for digging 
there. He asked us if we thought that the mole 
would put a heap of loose earth over his home, 
to tell his enemies wliere to find him 




At last, one day a gentleman came to Paul's 
father and asked him to open a mole's home for 
him. He wanted to see what it was like. This 
was just what we wanted, so we went too. 

The mole-catcher took us some way across the 
field. At the corner near the wood we came to a 
large mound, under the trees, covered with grass. 

Then he began to dig away the side of the 
mound. By-and-bye, about the middle, he 
stopped and cleared away the earth very care- 
fully with his hands. And there, just below the 
ground, was a big round hole covered with a roof 
of very hard earth. He had taken away the 
side, and we could see in. The hole was lined 
with dry grass, and in it lay four tiny moles. 
We filled it in again very carefully and left the 
baby moles safe and quiet. 

We saw four holes in the sides of the nest. 
These led to the runs through which the old 
moles went in and out to feed. We are afraid 
they got rather filled with earth from our digging, 
but the mole-catcher said that they would soon 
be put right by the old moles. 

He says that the father mole lives in another 
home like this all alone in the winter, feeding 
on worms. Sometimes he comes up above the 
ground, and if it is very frosty weather he dies of 
Dold. He only takes a wife in the spring. 


 

Croak, croak, croak, we hear the frogs in the 
month of March. They make a great deal of 
noise in this month, because they are jnst awake 
from their winter's sleep, at the bottom of the 
pond. 

The mother frogs are laying then tiny dart 
eggs in the water. Each egg is not bigger than 
a grain of sand. But it has a coat of jelly, and 
this jelly swells and swells in the water, till it is 
as large as a pea, with a little black dot in the 
middle. The jelly lumps all cliug together. You 
may see them in almost any pond, driven up to 
the side by the wind. 

Soon the dark speck lengthens. A head 
grows at one end, and a tail at the other. The 
head has a mouth, but no eyes as yet. The tail 
has a fin all round it, and the tadpole wrigglep 
about in its slimy bed. 

In about a week it wriggles out of the jelly, 




and hangs by its mouth to the weeds (1). Then 
two curious tufts grow on each side of its head. 
It uses these tufts to breathe, by taking ah out 
of the water. You can see them if you dip a 
glass into the pond and catch a few tadpoles. 

By this time the tadpole has let go of the 
weed and is swimming about. A sharp beak has 
grown on to his mouth. He uses it to tear off 
pieces of weed to eat. Now he grows eyes, nose- 
holes and flat ears. His tufts shrivel up, and a 
cover grows over them (2), so that you cannot 
see them. They are now like the gills of a fish. 
He gulps water in at his mouth and sends it out 
through the cover. As it passes, the gills take 
the air out of it, and so the tadpole breathes. 

Soon two small lumps appear on each side of 
his body, behind the cover, just where it joins 
his tail. They grow larger and larger, till at last 
two hind legs come out. These legs grow very 
long and strong, and he uses them to swim. Two 
front legs are growing as well, but you cannot see 
them, because they are under the cover. In a 
few days these peep out (3), but they are short 
and stumpy. 

Our tadpole has now four legs and a tail. 
He has four toes on the front feet, and five toes 
on the hind feet, with a skin between the toes. 
So his hind legs are web-footed, and this helrss 
him to swim. 




He comes to the top of the water much more 
often than before, and sends a bubble of air out 
of his mouth. What do you think has hap- 
pened ? The gills under his cover have closed 
up, and a small air-bag has grown inside him. 
So he comes up to breathe in the air through his 
mouth, instead of taking it out of the water 
through his gills. 

Now he likes to jump on a piece of weed and 
sit in the shade. He does not want his tail any 
longer, for he can swim quite well with his legs. 
So his tail is slowly sucked in to feed his body. 

There you have yom- little frog (4) . If you look 
through the web of his foot at the sun, you will 
see that he has red blood now. But it is not 
warm blood like ours. He is always cold and 
clammy, because his blood moves slowly. 

He has a number of teeth in the top of his 
mouth, and such a curious tongue. It is tied 
down to the front of his mouth, and the tip, 
which is very sticky, lies back down his throat. 
He does not eat weed now. He feeds on insects 
and slugs. He catches them by throwing out 
his tongue and drawing it rack very quickly. 

He lives chiefly on land during the summer 
if he is not eaten by ducks, rats, or snakes. Then 
he drops to the bottom of the pond to sleep in the 
mud all the winter. 




EvEEY country boy or girl, who wants to learn 
xbout water-animals, should make a pond net. 
You have only to get a willow twig, and bind it 
into a hoop with string. Then make a muslin 
bag and sew a small stone in the bottom of it, 
and sew the mouth of the bag on to the hoop. 
Get a stick out of the hedge and fasten to it 
a long piece of string. Split the string near the 
end, and tie it to the two sides of the hoop. 
Then you have a net which you can let down 
and fish up animals from the bottom of the 
pond. You had better have a wide-mouthed bottle 
as well in which you can put what you catch. I 
know a shady pond just outside a farmyard at the 
turn of a lane. There on a bright sunny day the 
insects are often very busy. 

In one corner of the pond the little whirligig 
beetles are swimming round and round, making 
circles in the water. Their shining black backs 
look almost green in the sun. Every now and 
then one jumps up to catch a fly in the air, or 
another dives down to eat a grub. Drop your net 
into the water and bring it up quickly under a 
beetle, and put him in the bottle so that you can 
see him. 
jpsif You will think that he has four eyes, for each 
if his two eyes is divided. One half looks up 



into the air, and one half looks down into the 
water. So as he whirls about, he can see the 
flies in the air and the grubs in the water. 

Gnats are flitting to and fro over the pond, 
and there is quite a crowd of those large flies 
with gauze wings which we call May-flies. And 

now a more 
splendid fly, 
three inches 
long, with 
four big 
gauze wings 
rises out of 
the bulrushes 
and flies over 
the pond. 

All boys 
know the 
dragon - fly. 
H i s lovely 
wings are 
covered with 
cross-bars filled with air, and they glitter in the 
sunshine with red, blue, and green colours. He 
has a long tail and a thick body with six legs, 
and a round head with huge eyes. 

Each eye has more than ten thousand tiny 
window.'^' jn it, so that he can see up and down, 
right ^d left, as he darts about, killing the butter- 




flies and moths that come in his way. Then he 
settles down on a plant or bush by the water-side, 
and rests till he starts off again across the poiui. 

If you go often in April to a pond where 
dragon-flies are, you may perhaps see one begin 
its life in the air. This is how it happens. 

Under the water a large insect crawls up the 
stem of a plant. He has a body as big as a dragon- 
fly and has six legs. But he has a curious dull 
look in his face, and where his wings should be 
there are only two short stumps. 

He crawls very slowly up the stem, till he 
comes out of the water into the air. Then a 
strange thing happens. The skin of his l)ack 
cracks, and out creeps a real dragon-flv. 

First his head, then his body with its six le'>'s 
and four soft, crumpled wings, and lastly his 
tail. He cannot tly yet. He stands by his old 
empty skin, and slowly stretches out his wings 
to the sun. In a few hours they are long and 
strong and hard. Then he is ready (o fly over 
the pond and feed. 

This is how the (U-agon-ily comes up to the 
air. You will not lind him so easily under the 
water, but we will try next week with our ; net. 
We have seen so much at the top of the pond 
to-day that we have not had time to dredge in 
the mud below. 

To-day we will use our net. Hold the stick 
tight, and throw the net out into the pond as a 
fisherman throws a fly. Then the stone will 
sink the net slowly. If now you pull it gently 
through the mud and water-plants, you are sure 
to get something. 

Bring the net to land and lower it on the 
grass, and put all you can find into the clear 
water in the bottle. You may find a little fish, 
or some tadpoles, or water- snails. Or there may 
be one of the curious creatures shown at «, on 
page 10. I am sure you would not think this was 
the grub of a dragon-fly. But it is. It is a long 
insect, all joints, with six legs, and eyes some- 
thing like those of the dragon-fly. It has no 
wings, but a curious kind of arm, with pincers 
at the end, comes out from under its chin. 

This is really part of its under-lip. It is 
called a mask, and has a hinge, so that it can be 
folded back under the chin. Now when the 
grub wants food, he waits quietly in the mud, till 
a beetle or a water-bug passes by. Then he 
throws out his mask, and catches his prey with 
the pincers. 

Look nelt at the end of its tail. Some- 
times it is pointed, sometimes it opens; out like 
the leaves of a flower. Wben it is open tha^rub 





draws water in, and uses the air in it to breathe. 

Then it shoots the water out and so pushes 

itself across the pond. 

This dragon-fly grub lives at the bottom of 

the pond for two years. 
So you ought to catch 
one some time if you 
try. It changes its skin 
many times, and grows 
some wing-stumps. 
Then it creeps up a 





stem, as we saw in the last lesson, and becomes 
a dragon-fly. 

And now what is this in our net ? At first 
you may think it is only a bit of stick, or a 
piece of mud with little stones in it, or a 
number of bits of grass matted together. And 
cio it is. But there is something alive inside. If 
you look carefully you can see the head of an 
inswt sticking out with six legs behind it. This 




is a soft little creature called a caddis- worm. If 
you clear off the pieces of grass, or stick, or smalJ 
stones, or shells, you will find the soft grub in- 
side. It has six legs and a number of little tufts 
under its body. It breathes with these tufts just 
as the tadpole does with its tufts. 

You may often see caddis-worms creeping 
along the bottom of brooks, looking like tiny, 
moving bundles of sticks or stones. You may pick 
them up without using a net. They build these 
cases round themselves to try to protect their 
soft bodies, which the fish like to eat. 

By-and-by they will turn into little yellow- 
brown flies like moths. They rise and fall in the 
an over the water in the evening. We did not 
see them with the May-flies and gnats, because 
they do not like the sunshine. 

You wiU very likely fish out a good many 
little water grubs in your net. But you must 
look carefully, for they are very small. Some 
have tufts all along their sides. These are the 
grubs of the gnats and May-flies you saw flying 
over the pond. They all live some time in the 
water. And when they come out into the air 
they do not live more than a few hours. 


It was a lovely day in May. The sun was 
shining, the grass was green, and the bushes 




on the banks of tlie river Thames weie covered 
with fi^esh leaves. 

In a hollow place in the river a little fish 
was building a nest. The fish was a stickleback. 
It was not more than two inches long. It had 
three spines sticking up on its back. .Boys 
often catch this fish, and keep it in bottles or 
sell it to people who have aquariums. 

It was more pleasant to watch him at work 
under the shade of the bushes. He brought 
little pieces of fine root-threads and narrow 
grass, and made them into a tiny saucer at the 
bottom of the river. Then he brought more 
pieces and stuck them on with slime from his 
mouth. In this way he made sides and a round 
roof. When he had done, the nest was as big 
as a large gooseberry. 

It was about six inches below the top of the 
water, and had a hole right through it. When 
the stickleback put his head out at one end, his 
tail stuck out at the other. But he had not 
built it to live in. He wanted it for the eggs of 
liis young ones. 

He was a lovely little fish with a shining 
back, and bright red belly. He had a bluish 
green eye that shone like a jewel. 

Now that his nest was built he swam ofi" to 
fetch a mate. He soon came back with another 
fish, not so bright as himself. He played with 




her, and drove her, and coaxed her, till at last 

she went m at one 

hole of the nest 

and, after a 

little while, 

came out at the 

other end. 

She had de- 
posited a tiny 
packet of yellow 
eggs, which she 
left behind her 
Then she went 
away and took 
no more care 
of them. 

The 
father 
stickleback 
now went 
t hrougli 
the nest 
and took 
charge 
of the 
eggs. 
Each 

not bigger than a poppy seed, and the whole 
bunch was very tiny. He shook the nest up 
and poked the eggs into a snug, safe corner. 
Then he swam over the top of the nest, waving 
his fins, so that fresh water went in and out. 

Sometimes he went into the nest and 
brought out some dirty sand in his mouth. 
This he puffed away into the water. You see 
he wanted to keep the nest clean. 

He did this every day for three weeks, till 
the eggs were hatched. Then a number of tiny 
fish came out. They were so small and trans- 
parent that you would think no other fish would 
see them. But the stickleback knew better. 
There were plenty of hungry fish watching to 
eat the tiny fry, which were very weak and had 
to carry a bag of food under their body, to suck 
in till they could eat. 

So the brave little stickleback stuck up his 
three spines, and dashed angrily at any fish 
which snapped at his little ones. He seized 
their fins, and struck at their eyes and drove 
them away. 

He made a small round place in the sand at 
blie bottom of the river and gathered the little 
sticklebacks into it, and there he watched over 
them. Even after their spines were grown and 
they could swim boldly, he followed them out 
into the river to see that they were safe. 




You may find plenty of stickleback's nests in 
rivers and ponds, if you look carefully for them. 
Or if you catch several sticklebacks in a bottle 
and put them in a large pan with plenty of 
weeds and food, most likely you will see a 
stickleback build his nest, and learn what a 
good father he is. 



Hush ! Do not make a noise ! There is a 
kingfisher sitting on the bough of the willow tree 
hanging over the river. If we once startle him, 
he will fly away and we shall not see him again. 

How lovely he looks against the grey leaves. 
With his long beak and his stumpy tail he is not 
much larger than a sparrow, yet he seems to wear 
all the colours of the rainbow. 

He has a bright blue streak down his back, 
his head and wings are a lovely green, with blue 
spots on the tips of the feathers. His beak is 
black. His chin and throat are white. He has 
a red streak behind his eye, with soft white 
feathers beyond, and his breast is like shining 
copper. Even his feet are red, and look quite 
gay against the dull branch. 

> He is peering down into the quiet pool under 
the willow, watching the fish swimming below, 
There ! he has darted down to the water. New. 



 

he is up again with something in his mouth. It 
is a small minnow. He taps its head against 
bhe branch, and gulps it down, head first. -- 

One more, and still one more fish he catches 
in the same way. While he is eating the last, 
another kingfisher comes and perches by his side. 
This is his mate, who has been fishing a little 
way off. She is not quite so bright as he is, and 
has a httle bit of red under her chin. 

Now they are going home, and they fly away 
crying " Seep-seep-seep " as they go. They live 
in the trees and bushes by the side of the river. 
For you must always remember that birds do not 
live in nests. The nest is only a cradle for their 
eggs and their little ones. As soon as they are 
able to fly, the young birds leave it with their 
parents, and do not often live in a nest again, till 
they make one for their own eggs. 

I do not think you will easily find a king- 
fisher's nest, so I must tell you about it. When 
the mother wants to lay her eggs, the kingfishers 
dig a tunnel in the bank, and when it is made 
they dart into it so fast that you cannot see 
where they go. 

But if you could know where it is and dig 
down from above, you would find a snug chamber 
which measures about six inches across. At the 
bottom of this chamber are a number of fish 
bones Tshiph the old birds have put there. They 






are mixed up together so that they make a nice 
open floor, where the wet can get away. 

On the fish bones lie some shining white eggs. 
There will be seven, if the mother has laid as 
many as usual. And, if the eggs are hatched, 
there will be seven little birds. Each bird will 
have all the lovely colours of which I have told 
you. The only difference between them and the 
old birds is that their beaks are shorter. 

Though you may, perhaps, not find a king- 
fisher's nest, you will very likely see some young 
birds on the river. I was once out with a friend 
who was fishing, and while his rod was over the 
water, all at once two small kingfishers flew up 
and settled upon it. They rested a moment, and 
then flew on. He had only just thrown his fly 
again on to the water, when two more kingfishers 
flew up and sat on the rod. They, too, soon went 
on. It was clear that they were young birds 
just out of the nest and could not fly far. 

The kingfishers are the brightest birds you 
can see on the river. They look so pretty among 
the green leaves, and hovering over the water, that 
if you have once seen them, you will want to see 
them again. 



Have you ever seen a water-rat? T do not mean 
aiartdfTat swimming in the water, but a water-rat. 




or icater-vole, as he ought to be called, for he is 
not a true rat. I saw one once when he did not 
see me. What do 3'ou think he was doing? He 
was sitting up on his hind legs, and in his front 
paws he held a piece of the leaf of the sweet 
yellow flag, which grows so thickly by the river. 
It was that part of the leaf near the root which 
is thick and juicy. He was gnawing it so busily 
that he did not see me at first. 

He was a stout little fellow, not quite so big as 
a rat. He feeds on plants. When he cannot get 
pieces of yellow flag he eats duckweed, or even 
the bark of young willows. I could see that he 
had a short, thick neck and round head, with a 
short snout. His eyes were small, and I could 
scarcelv see his oars, they were so thickly covered 
with fur. His round tail was not very long and 
had short hairs on it. 

I sat down very ([uietly on the bank, not far 
from him. And i)resently he looked round and 
saw me. But as 1 did not move perhaps he did 
not think I was alive, for he went on munching 
his leaf. 

At last I touched a dead leaf with my foot. 
His ears heard quickly enough. He turned his.- 
little bright eyes to me, and in a second he was 
in the water and swam away. I was toe; late to 
see him go into his hole, but I found one not far 
from the flags, just under the water. ' ' 







I knew I should not find his home; for the 
water-voles make long burrows. I went for several 
days to the same place, and took some bread to 
leave there. At last one day, as I sat watching, out 
came my little friend and ate the bread. After that 
we met several times, and he became quite tame. 
But I had to be very careful. The least thing 
frightened him, and plop he went, into the water ! 

If you go often to a pond or river, when all is 
very quiet in the evening or early morning, you 
may sometimes see a water-vole swimming in the 
water, or feeding on the bank. He has beautiful 
yellow teeth. The lower ones are large and show 
very clearly above his short lower lip. 

The young water-voles are such pretty little 
creatures. They are born in a nest of dry grass, 
which the old voles make in the burrow, and 
when they come out they swim about with the 
old ones, and feed on the duckweed. 

But though the water-vole lives mostly in the 
water, he can come on land to gather his winter 
store. He is often a great trouble to the farmer, 
for he likes the carrots and potatoes and even 
the broad beans, which grow in the fields, and he 
comes in the evening to eat them and to carry 
pieces back to his home. 

A farmer once dug out a water-vole's burrow 
and found enough pieces of potato and mangold- 
v^rzel to fill a gallon measure. 



If your way to school lies along a river-path, 
where trees hang over the water, you will very 
likely have seen a water-hen and her little ones. 
Perhaps you may know where a nest is, either 
among the rushes, or on a bough of a tree over- 
hanging the water. 

It is made of dead rushes, and though it is 
quite close to the water, it is dry and warm. If 
you are bathing you may look in. You will find 
about eight pale-grey eggs spotted with red-brown 
patches. Or perhaps some of the eggs may be 
hatched, and then the young birds will be hidden 
with their mother in the rushes. They are little 
black balls of fluff with red on their heads and 
white tail-feathers, and they can run and swim 
directly they are born. All the time you are 
looking, the mother, hidden in the rushes, will 
cry " Crr-ooh^ crr-ooh " to drive you away. 

She is a black bird, about as big as a pigeon, 
with a bright red forehead and yellow beak. And 
she has white feathers on the edge of her wings 
and under her tail. When she is in the water, 
she keeps jerking her head down, so that you see 
the white feathers, and even her green legs with 
their red garters. 

Very soon after the young water-hens are 
hatched, they slip out of the nest and sw' 




round her. If you are lying very still among the 
bushes, you may perhaps see them all come out 
on to the bank, to feed on worms or snails. Then 
you can notice that their feet are not webbed like 
a duck's feet, but all four toes are separate.. 

But if you make the least noise, the mother 
will cry ^^ KreJc-hrek" to her little ones, and 
they will dive into the water and swim to a safe 
place among the rushes. They will not go back 
to the nest, and even if you beat the rushes with 
a stick they will not move. They know that they 
are safer in their hiding place. 

This bird is often called a moor-hen and she 
does go to the moors sometimes. But Water- 
hen is her better name. 

And now, if there is a large lake anywhere 
near, you will see the water-hen there, and 
another bird, which you may think is the same, 
for she jerks her head and dives just in the same 
way. But if you look you will see that this 
second bird has not got a red forehead, but a 
large, bald patch on its head, and it is larger than 
the water-hen. 

It is a bird called the coot, and often the 
•' bald-headed coot," because of its bald patch. 
If you see one on the bank feeding on seeds or 
insects, you will notice that it has a wavy skin 
round each of its three front tpe^^ though they 
are not joined together. 


But the coot is not easy to see, for she is 
very shy. She runs up a tree, or dives under 
water, before you can get near her. She has 
sharp claws, which help her to climb, and which 
will hurt you if you catch her alive. 

She builds her nest among the flags or rushes, 
almost touching the water. Sometimes her little 
ones are drowned when there is a flood. 

If a boat comes near her nest, she slips off it 
into the rushes and cries '' Keiv-Jcew" to entice 
you away. If you find it, you will see about ten 
eggs in it. They are like the water-hen's eggs, 
but larger, and the spots are darker and smaller. 
If the eggs are hatched, you will know the little 
birds by their bald patch, though they are black, 
fluffy balls just like those of the water-hen. 

You will not find the coot in rivers ; nor will 
you find her on the ponds in the winter. Then 
she starts off with a number of other coots to the 
sea in the south of England, and stays tiU spring 
comes again. 


When you go home from school, if you pass a 
pond, you are almost sure to be able to find one, 
or more, of the three water-bugs of this lesson, 
and I want you to look at them. 

The first is a long, thin, black insect. He 


walks on top of the water, looking like a needle 
on legs. He is sometimes called a "needle- 
bug," but more often a "water-measurer," 
because he seems to measure the water with his 
legs as he runs. 

He has very iine haii's under his body and on 
his legs. The air between these hairs prevents 
him from getting wet and being drowned. He 
has two long feelers, and a long thin beak. His 
legs and body are a reddish colour and his 
wings a glossy black. 

If you watch him, you will see him start all 
at once across the pond. He is catching a 
water-fly. Then he will hold it in his front 
claws, and suck the juice out of its body. 
Though the water-measurer has wings, he does 
not often fly. 

The next water-bug is not so thin. He is 
about an inch long, and has a flat body with grey 
wings folded across it. He has only very short 
feelers, and his front legs are thick and strong, 
with pincers at the end, and this is why he is 
called the "water-scorpion." He uses these 
pincers to seize the insects in the water, and 
sucks them dry through his sharp beak. 

He swims under water very slowly, or crawls 
in the mud, and is easily caught. You may 
catch him too when he comes up to get air. 
This he does in a verv funny way. He has two 






long bristles at the end of his tail. When he 
puts these together they make a tube like a 
hollow straw. He comes near the top of the 
water, and thrusts out the end of this tube into 
the air, and draws some into his body. The 

eggs of the 
mother water- 
scorpion are 
stuck on to the 
leaves of water- 
plants, and look 
like seeds. 

The last 

water-bug I am 

sure you know. 

He is a 

little 

fellow, 

" rather 

like a 

beetle, 

with six 

legs, two 

of them being very long ones ; and he swims 
apside down, rowing himself along with these 
two legs, as if they were oars. This is why 
he is called a "water-boatman," 

He has a long, sucking beak, but you will 
hardly see it unless you dip him out with a glass 




and look close. For as lie swims upside down, 
the bug bends liis head down on his chest, so 
that his beak lies between his legs. 

His eyes at the side of his head are very 
large, so that he can look both down and up. 
This is very useful, for he swims under tadpoles 
and grubs, and catches them in his claws. Then 
he bites them with his sharp beak, and sucks out 
their soft body. He is always swimming in the 
water, or crawling in the mud. In the evening 
he sometimes comes out and flies to another pond 
or ditch. 

The mother water-boatman lays small, long, 
white eggs on stems and leaves in the water. 
You may often find them in March, and in April 
you may see the little bugs swimming upside 
down like their parents. 

If you take the trouble, yon may catch these 
three water-bugs in a net, and put them in a 
glass, and see all I have told you. 

ljET us stroll a short distance along the river. 
How pretty it is, with the evening sun shining 
through the trees ! What a number of little 
creatures are enjoying themselves in the air 
and in the water ! 

Pale little TommY, who has come from 





London for a holiday, slips his hand in mine and 
says, "I wish I could live in the country.'' 
When he goes back to his own home in a narrow 
street, where there is only a hard pavement 
instead of green grass, and no shady trees nor 





flowing water, he will remember this walk by the 
river. 

Look at those fish, about three inches long, 
swimming up and down under the bridge. Those 
are bull-heads. They are called so because they 
have such broad, thick heads. And they have a 
sharp spine on each side of their head, which we 
might call the bull's horns. You will feel those 





spines if you try to hold them in your hand. The 
kingfisher knows them well enough, if he tries to 
swallow one, for they stick in his throat. 

You boys call them " millers' thumbs." 1 
wonder why you think that millers have broad 
thumbs ? The bull-heads hide under stones, and 
eat water insects, and the eggs of other fish. Ah ! 




Fred has caught one and put it in the bottle. 
Now Tommy can see what a lovely eye the bull- 
head has, and the red, green, brown and yellow 
colours on his scales. 

How busy those flies are with long wings and 
three long bristles on their tails. They are May- 
flies rising and falling over the water. They are 
not feeding, for May-flies do not eat, and only 
live a few hours. But they have lived a long time 
under water as grubs, Hke the di-agon-fly grub. 
They only want now to lav their eggs and die. 


The gnats flying over that quiet pool near the 
mill are quite different. One has just pricked 
my hand and sucked some blood, so I know that 
he can feed. But then gnats have not had so 
long a life in the water as the May -flies. 

Those gnats flying over the pool were onl5> 
born a few weeks ago. Their mother laid some 
3ticky eggs, each not bigger than the point of 
a pin, and left them in a packet on the top of 
the still water. They were very soon hatched, 
and a number of grubs came out, looking like 
very tiny worms with fine hairs on their sides. 
Each swam about in the water and ate specks of 
weed. 

Why do you think they swam with their 
heads down ? Because they could only breathe 
near their tails, and so had to stick them up in 
the air. 

In about three weeks each grub had changed 
his skin three times. The fourth time he came 
out with a wrapper round him, and if you could 
have looked at him then, you would have seen a 
perfect gnat, with wings, cuddled up inside. 

Now he had to creep out, and that was very 
risky. For if he fell in the water he would be 
drowned. So he stretched himself very carefully 
on the top of the pool, and began to push his 
head through a slit in the wrapper. 

Then he drew himself gently out, and stood 





on tiptoe on the empty skin, which floated Hke a 
boat on the water. He spread his wings, and 
then he was safe and flew away. Sometimes the 
wind blows him over before he can get out, and 
then he is drowned. 

If you take a pail of water out of a pond in 
May, and keep it in the open air, you may be 
able to see a gnat grow up, for there will most 
likely be a great many in it. But you must have 
sharp eyes, for they are very tiny. 

And now the sun is setting and birds and 
beasts and flow^ers are all soino- to rest. Soon 
the night-moths and the owls and bats will be 
coming out. We must go home. 


About live o'clock one tine morning in May, Tom, 
the gamekeeper's son, was examining the traps 
set for weasels, stoats, and other vermin. His 
way led him over a bridge across the river, and 
as he came near it he heard a strange whistling 
noise. 

Now, Tom was a Devonshire lad, and all 
country boys in the West of England have sharp 
ears for the calls of animals. Tom knew that 
this cry came from a father or mother otter who 
were fishing in the river with their little ones. 

Just below the bridge, where the bank wai 





very high, there grew an old willow tree, with 
branches hanging over the river. The water had 
washed away the bank under the willow, so that 
there was a big hole between its strong roots. 

Now, Tom knew that this hole was the home 
of some otters. Many a time the otter-hounds 
had stood in the water near this hole baying with 
all their might. But they could not get in, and 
the otters took care not to come out. 

The hounds were far away now, and every- 
thing was very quiet in the early morning. So 
Tom lay down in the thick grass at the top of 
the bank and waited. By-and-bye on came 
the otters, swimming smoothly along with only 
their noses above water. 

The old otters swam so quietly that Tom 
would not have known they were there. But 
the young otters were playing and twisting about, 
so that first their brown furry backs, and then 
their white bellies, shone in the light of the 
early morning sun, and the water splashed about 
them. 

The river was very broad in this place, and 
just opposite the willow was a small island. Tom 
was so well hidden in the tall grass that the 
otters had no idea that he was there. So ojie 
by one they scrambled up on the island, each 
with a fish in its mouth. Then they each took 
hold of their fish with their front ffijet, and began



bo eat just behind the head. They ate on till 
they nearly reached the tail and then left that. 

While they were eating, Tom could see what 
they were like. They had long bending bodies, 
and broad, flat heads, and their mouths and noses 
were short and broad. Their feet were webbed 
like duck's feet, but each foot had very sharp 
claws at the end. Then- fm' was a lovely soft 
brown, but the long hairs on the old otters were 
coarse, and they did not look so soft as the little 
ones. Their tails were thick and strong, and 
very useful for helping them to swim. 

The father tore the fish with his teeth quite 
fiercely, and sometimes threw small pieces to 
the young ones, who had soon finished their tiny 
fish. At last all was eaten up, except the heads 
and tails. Then the father otter slid down the 
bank, and the others followed him, and they all 
went to fish again. 

There are fewer otters than there used to be 
in the rivers of England. But they are still 
to be found in many places. Only, if you want 
to see them at home, you must get up early 
in the morning. 



"Where are you going, Peggy?" asked Peter, 
as he passed her in the lane, one Saturday 
afternoon in July- 
'' I am going to look for flowers, foi' the 
flower-show next week. I shall not gather them, 
but I want to see what I can find." 

" May I go with you ? " 

"Yes, if you can keep a secret. I want to 
make quite a new kind of nosegay, of flowers 
that grow in the water." 

" But they will all fade if you put them in a 
bunch." 

" I am not going to put them in a bunch. I 
am going to get one of father's large zinc pans 
which he uses for the dogs' food, and let the 
plants float in the water." 

So Peggy and Peter started ofi" to their 
favourite pond. 

" See, Peter, I must have one of those lovely 
yellow ' water-hlies,' with its large, shiny green 
leaf, and one of its curious seed-boxes, which 
remain after the yellow flower-leaves have fallen 
off. I know that this plant has a thick stem 
in the mud at the bottom of the pond, and the 
long stalks grow right up, so that the leaves 
float on the top of the water. Little beetles 
crawl inside the flower and get honey from 
under the smaU yellow flower-leaves inside. 

' Then I must have some of those white stars 
with yellow in the middle. They look so pretty 
among their small green leaves, which are cut into 
three half-rounds. That is the ' water-crow-foot,' 





and if you hook a bit in with your stick we shall 
see that it has some other leaves under water, 
which are cut into strips like fine blades of grass." 

" Why should it 
have two kinds of 
leaves, Peggy ? " 

'^ One set are 
its floating leaves 
to keep the flowers 
above water, where 
the insects can get 
at them, and the 
others are lighter 
and can spread out 
in the water with- 
out making so much 
green leaf. And 
look, Peter, the 
yellow lines on the 
white flowers point 
straight to the nar- 
row end of the flower- 
leaf, where the in- 
sects find the honey. 

" Then I must have some duckweed. It 
will cover the pan so nicely." 

" But the duckweed is not pretty, Peggy. It 
is all leaves." 

"No, Peter, that is just what it is not. Paul 




told me the other day that the duckweed has no 
real leaves. Each plant is a httle bit of stem 
with a thin root hanging down in the water. 
Very tiny flowers sometimes grow in a little split 
in the side of the stem. I shall try to get one 
of these, but they are so very small, and are only 
made of two little dust-bags and a seed-box. But 
the duckweed will float on the water. 

'' Now, Peter, I want to find a 'bog-bean ' in 
flower. I am afraid it is rather late in the year, 
but there are some, I know, at the shallow 
end of the pond You must look for a large 
spike of pink- white flowers, shaped something 
like wide blue-bells and lined with a number 
of white hairs. Ah ! here is one with the buds 
just opening ; it will be all right for Wednesday. 

" Now we must have one more. A little 
plant called the ' water-milfoil,' which is almost 
ill under water, except the spike of tiny pink 
flowers which stands straight up in the air. 
Look at its fine leaves arranged in stars round 
the stem. They lie out so well in the water. If 
you look very carefully at the flowers, you will 
see that the top ones have only dust-bags 
in them, and the lower ones only seed-boxes. 
But they are so small it is not easy to see this. 

" Now I must not choose any more, for I 
must describe each one on my show-card, and it 
will take a long time." 



When Wednesday came, Peggy's pan was ready. 
She had taken it to the pond, and dipped it 
gently under the duckweed. She brought it up 
quite full, and picked it over very carefully, 
leaving only the best plants. Then she carried 
it to the show-room. 

There she put the yellow lily into the middle 
of the pan, so that the flower, and the stalk with 
the seed-vessel, fitted into the hollow between 
the ears of the large green leaf just at the leaf- 
stalk. Next she put pieces of the water-crowfoot 
here and there, the pretty white blossoms streaked 
with yellow resting upon the top of the water. 

She stuck two spikes of bog-bean, with their 
leaves, one on each side of the water-lily. Lastly, 
she put spikes of the water-milfoil round the edge 
of the pan. Their leaves made little green stars 
in the water all the way round, and their tiny 
pink flower-spikes made a lovely edge. 

Then she wrote her card. This is what she 
said : 

1. The yellow water-lily grows in the pond 
near the farm. It has a thick stem rooted in the 
mud down at the bottom. I saw it once when 
they cleaned the pond. We see nothing on the 
top of the water in March. But in May the large 




shining green leaves have grown to the top of 
the water on long stalks. They are shaped rather 
like a heart, but are pointed at the tip. 

In June the buds 
come up. They are like 
green knobs tipped with 
yellow. But as they 
grow bigger, the five 
outer leaves, or sepals^ 
open, and they are 
quite yellow in- 
side. Then we can 
see the small inner 
flower - leaves, or 
petals, arranged in 
two rows ; after 
them come a num- 
ber of stamens, 
made of thin 
threads, with dust-bags 
on the top. TheL right 
in the middle is the 
seed-box, or ovary. It 
is shaped like a water-bottle 
with a round cushion on the 
top, and has a number of 
sticky points, which lie on the 
cushion in the shape of a star. w\ter-buttbbcdp, 
Little beetles are often foiind i™ <i^L^?;™ 



in the flowers. They fly m, and suck the 
honey at the back of the petals. 

2. The water-crowfoot grows 

in our pond. It is a kind oi 

buttercup. It has five outer 

green leaves, or sepals. They 

turn back against the stem 

when the flower is open. 

They often fall ofi". There are 

five white petals. They are 

streaked with yellow near the 

middle of the flower, where 

there are drops of honey. Aftei 

the petals, come many 

stamens, and then, in the 

middle of the flower, a 

number of seed-boxes, 

each with one seed 

inside. 

The water- crow- 
foot has two kinds 
of leaves. The 
leaves which float 
on the top of 
the water are 
flat and cut 









into three half 
rounds. The leaves under water are cut into 
threads and spread out on all sides. 



 

3. There is a great deal of duckweed in our 
pond. Each plant has one little root in the 
water and a kind of stem at the top. It has no 
leaves. The tiny flowers sometimes come out of 
a slit in the side of the stem. Each flower is 
nothing but two dust-spikes and a tiny seed-box. 

4. The bog-bean, or buck -bean, is nearly out 
of flower now. It grows at the edge of the pond, 
and its leaves are cut into three long parts. 
The pinkish flowers stand out on little stalks 
upon a tall stem. They are cup-shaped, with 
five points, and have a number of white hairs 
inside. 

5. The water-milfoil grows almost all under 
water. Only the small pink flowers stand in a 
spike out in the air. The flowers at the top of 
the spike have only stamens in them. Lower 
down some have both dust-bags and seed-boxes. 
The ones at the bottom have seed-boxes, or 
ovaries, only. Milfoil leaves are narrow, like 
grass, but quite short. They stand round the 
stem like the spokes of a wheel, or the rays oi 
a star. 

Peggy's water-nosegay and show-card won 
the prize. 



It is seven o'clock on a lovely summer morning. 
Jump up and look out of the window. It is a 
shame to be in bed when the sun is shining so 
brightly, and the birds are singing, and the bees 
are flying from flower to flower. 

Why are the bees at Avork so early ? They want 
to gather the yellow pollen-dust from the flowers, 
and the dew helps them to wet it, so that they can 
roll it up in little balls. Then they pack these balls 
into a groove in their hind legs, and fly away to 
the hive. There they mix it with honey, and make 
it into bee-bread to feed the young bees. 

See how busy that woodpecker is, under the elm 
tree. He is catching insects to carry home to his 
little ones, which have been hatched more than a 
week. Further away in the field is a thrush 
struggling with a big worm : I expect that he too 
is getting a breakfast for his family. 




How busy they all are, and you in bed! K 1 
were you I would get up and pull up some ^v^eeds in 
the garden. Then you will be of some use, and you 
can learn many interesting things, while you are at 
work. 

Here is a weed, growing among the cabbages. 
Do you know its name? It is called "The 
Shepherd's Purse" (see picture, p. 12) because of its 
curious seed-pods. These grow on stalks up the 
stem of the plant, below the little white floTvers. 
If you open one of them very carefully, you wiU 
find that there is a small bag on each side, which 
can be pulled away from the middle, when the 
pod is ripe, leaving the seeds hanging on a small 
division. 

So the pod is a kind of purse, ^vith two pockets, 
and we can pretend that the seeds are the shep- 
herd's money. 

Take hold of this plant, and I will tell you about 
its different parts. First look at the root. That 
always grows downwards into the ground. It has 
small rootlets growing out of it. The root and the 
rootlets all have tender tips, and they drink in the 
food of the plant out of the ground. 

You know that your father puts manure into 
the earth before he sows his seeds, or plants his 
fruit trees. Then the rain sinks into the earth and 
takes the juice out of the manure. This makes a 
rich drink for the roots to suck in, and so the plants 
grow strong. 

Next look at the stem. You can tell where it 
begins, for a tuft of leaves grows close to the 




ground. A root never has any leaves on it, so 
where the leaves grow must be the . stem. The 
place where the stem joins the root is often called 
the stock. 

Look carefully at this tuft of leaves. You will 
see that they do not grow exactly one above the 
other. The leaves in the upper row always grow^ 
just between the leaves of the lower row. And as 
the stem grows upwards, and the leaves are farther 
apart, they still grow so that they are not exactly 
one above the other. 

Why do you think they grow like this ? Because 
they want to get as much sun as they can. If they 
grew exactly one above the other, the upper leaf 
w^ould keep the sun away from the lower one. But 
now they get as much as there is to be had. 

You see then that a plant has a root which 
gro'^s doTvnwards to take in water out of the 
ground, and stems to grow upwards and carry the 
leaves up into the sunlight. What the leaves do 
we will learn in the next lesson. 




The leaves want a great deal of sunshine and air, 
for they are busy all day long, making food. Have 
you ever thought how wonderful it is that plants 
can make their own food ? You do not make your 
food, and no animals make their own food. AH 
you eat has once been either an animal or a plant. 




In a cake, for instance, the flour conies from grains 
of wheat, the currants from a Httle tree, the sugar 
from the sugar-cane, the spices come from trees, 
and the candied peel from fruits. 

The other things you eat are meat, fish, birds, 
vegetables, and fruits, and all these have once been 
alive. 

Plants do not feed like this. Their roots take in 
water out ot the earth, and other substances, such 
as lime, soda, and potash, dissolved in it. The 
leaves take in gases out of the air. But earth, 
air, and water are not living food. You or I could 
not live on them. The plant can. 

The pretty green leaves we love so much work 
very hard. When the sun shines upon them they 
can turn the water and gases into living food, and 
this food makes more leaves, flowers, and fruits 
which we eat. 

See how useful plants are ! If they did not make 
food, there could be nothing alive in the world. 
Insects feed on plants, and birds feed on insects. 
Sheep feed on grass, and we feed on sheep. Rabbits 
feed on plants, and foxes and weasels feed on 
rabbits. If there were no plants, there could be 
no insects, no birds, no animals, and no men alive. 

But this is not the only useful work which plants 
do. You know that if many people are shut up in 
a room, they use up the fresh air, and breathe back 
bad air, which is not fit to use again. Now plants 
want this foul air. They take it in through their 
leaves, and use a gas which is in it to help them 
t-o grow. So they not only turn gases into food 









for us to eat, but in doing this they use the bad 
air we send out of our mouths, and give it back 
to us fresh and pure. This is why it is so healthy 

to Kve in the country, wliere 
there are so many plants. 

You will find it very in- 
teresting to look at the leaves 
of plants, and notice their 
shapes, and how they are 
arranged on their stems so 
as to get light and air. 

I think you must know 
the common Dead- 
nettle, which is so 
like a stinging- 
nettle but does not 
sting. It grows in 
the hedges, and 
has a pretty purple 
or white flower 
slipped like a hood. 
J, Its leaves are ar- 

ranged in pairs all 
 up the stem, and 

each pair stands 
exactly across the 
pair below it, so as 
to let in plenty of 
light. 

The glossy green leaves ot the ivy on the wall 
(ie out flat, and have long stalks, so that they can 
stand out well into the air. 
B — in 





The leaves of the Nasturtiums in our gardens 
are shaped Hke a round shield. The leaf -stalk grows 
from under the middle of the leaf and is very long. 
So the leaf looks up straight to the sky, and gets 
plenty of light and air. 

The leaf of the Horse Chestnut tree is divided 
into leaflets, so that it looks as if it were made of 
five leaves, and each leaflet is spread out to the 
light. 

The leaves of the little Wood Sorrel, which 
children love to bite because it tastes sour, have 
three round leaflets like the Shamrock, and these 
leaflets droop down at night, or on a wet day, but 
Btand up wide open when the sun is shining. 

And now let us go back to our shepherd's purse. 
We have not yet looked for the flowers ; they grow 
on stalks which come out between the leaf-stalks 
and the stem. On these stalks there are some 
smaller leaves and a good many seed-pods. 

Above the seed-pods at the top of the stalk are 
some white flowers grooving close together. They 
are so small that you can scarcely see the parts. 
But you can make out that they have four outer 
green leaves and four white inner leaves. In the 
next lesson we will learn more about these. 

Gather six plants with different shaped leaves and notice 
how they grow upon the stem. 



The flowers of the Shepherd's Purse are very small 
so we will get the flowers of another plant to help 
us to learn about them. If you can find, in the 
garden, a turnip plant that has run to seed, you 
will see that it has flowers very like those of the 
Shepherd's Purse, only they are larger, and yellow 
instead of white. 

In both flowers there are four outer green 
leaves. These are called sepals. They form the 
cup or calyx of the flower. Then there are the 
four coloured leaves, which grow above the sepals. 
These are called petals. They make the crown or 
corolla of the flower. They are white in the 
Shepherd's Purse, and yellow in the Turnip flower. 
But in both flowers they stand in the form of a 
cross. 

Next come six thin threads with little knobs on 
the top. Two of them are short, and four are long. 
These are called stamens. The knobs are called 
inthers, they are the dust-bags which hold the 
yellow dust or pollen. Lastly, in the middle of the 
flower, is the seed-box or ovary. In the Shepherd's 
Purse the ovary is shaped like a heart, in the 
Turnip flower it is a long pod. 

The pods grow on little stalks down the stem 
They once had flower-leaves round them. But 
these have withered away, and the pods have 
grown large. 
 

Some of the best vegetables in your garden 
have flowers Kke these in the form of a cross, and 
with four long and two short stamens. Some, like 
the turnip and radish, have roots that are good to 
eat. In others, such as the cabbage and mustard- 
and-cress, we eat the leaves. In cauliflower and 
broccoli we eat the flowers. 

Now let us go back to our turnip. What a 
splendid round root it has ! You can find a kind of 
turnip growing wild in the lanes, but the root is 
hard — you would not like to eat it. Our turnips are 
good, l)ecause they have been grown in good 
ground, and had good food for hundreds of years, 
ind only the best seeds are sow^n. 

Now I daresay you think that, as we dig the 
ground and sow the seed, we ought to keep the 
turnip for ourselves. But there are a good many 
animals and insects wdiich want their share. As 
soon as the turnip seed has sent up its first green 
leaves, a little beetle is there, ready to eat them. 
When its wings are closed it is not much bigger 
than the letter O in the title of this lesson. It has 
long hind legs and can hop very far, so it is called 
the Turnip Flea-beetle. 

In the winter these beetles sleep under the clods 
of earth, or under dead leaves. W hen spring comes 
they wake up, and feed on the Shepherd's Purse, or 
some other weed, which conies up early in the year, 
riie mother fiea-beetle lays her eggs under the 
leaves, and very soon the tiny maggots come out, 
and eat tunnels in them. 

In a fortnight they are fat. Then they fall to 





rhe ground, and wrap themselves up in their cocoor 
skin, just as the baby ants did in the ant-hill. In 
another fortni<^ht they become little beetles. 



By that time the early turnips are just sending 
up their first leaves, and the flea-beetles will hop a 
long way to eat them. So, when you get up some 
morning, you may find the turnip bed very bare, 
ind if you have sharp eyes you may catch the little 
black shiny beetles which have done the mischief. 
A whole field of swedes or yellow turnips may be 
eaten down in this way. 

If you clear away all the weeds early in the year, 
and rake the ground, so that the young turnips 
grow quickly, you may keep the flea-beetle away. 
But then other creatures are wanting their share. 
The turnip-weevil will lay her egg in the root 
underground, as the nut-weevil did in the nut in 
the tree (see Book I.). If you pull up a turnip with 
little lumps or galls on it, you may know that a 
weevil maggot has been hatched inside. 

Then, when the large turnip leaves have grown, 
the pretty orange saw-fly Avill leave her eggs in 
them, so that the maggots eat them all away. 
Then the rabbit, if he can get in, will eat the tops, 
while the mice will nibble at the root. Lastly, if 
you grow turnips for seed, the pretty little green 
flower-beetle wants his share, and he eats the 
flower-buds. 

So you see the turnips feed many creatures 
besides the sheep and ourselves. A good gardener 
enjoys learning how to keep these garden thieves 
away. 

Bring the flowers of wallflower, stock, candytuft, penny- 
cress, turnip-flower, and shepherd's purse, and notice their 
likeness in the form and arran cement of their parts. 



We saw in the last two lessons that a plant has a 
root, stem, leaves, flowers, and seed-boxes. To-day 
I ^vant to tell you how these grow. 

If your teacher will let you make a little ex- 
periment, you can watch a plant j^ourself as it 
grows out of the seed. Get a savicer and a small 
piece of flannel. Put the flannel in the saucer, and 
pour water over it till it is quite wet. Then get 
someone to give you a pinch of mustard seed, and 
scatter it on the flannel. Put this on the window- 
sill, or on the table, and take care to keep the flannel 
wet. Then watch w hat happens. 

The second day after you have sown the seeds, 
you will find that they are swollen and soft. They 
have sucked up some water, and are using it to 
grow. On the third day many of the seeds will 
have sent out a tiny white root, which will cling 
to the flannel. 

The tip of the root will now suck in more water, 
and if you will open a seed you will find that it is 
splitting in half. Each of the two halves is going 
to be a leaf. But they are not green, they are 
still quite white, and you would not think that they 
were leaves. 

When you go to school on the fourth morning 
you may find these two halves out of their coat. 
Some of them are white, but some are Lurning 
green above and i)urple belo^v, and everyone 
would flow call them leaves. They grow up ou h 



stem, and the empty coat of the seed still hangs 
on the place where the stem and the root meet. 

Look well at the shape of these leaves, they are 
made of two rounds with a dent in the middle- 
They are the seed-leaves of the mustard plant. They 
have come out of the seed, and have used the food 
that was in it, to spread themselves out, and rise up 
into the sunlight. Now as the light pours do"\vn 
on them, they turn green, and can make their own 
food out of the water and gases, which the roots 
suck in. For the root has now many rootlets and 
root-hairs on it, as you w'll see if ycu will iDull one 
out of the flannel. 

In a few days a grejn tip shows between the 
two seed-leaves, and grows up, opening out into 
two more leaves. These again have a little bud 
growing between them, which spreads out into 
other leaves, and so the plant goes on getting 
larger. 

But the new leaves are quite different in shape 
from the seed-leaves. They are long, and are cut 
up into five leaflets, one large one at the tip, and 
two small ones on each side. 

What you have seen happen to the mustard 
seed on the flannel is just what happens to every 
seed you sow in the ground. First it swells, when 
the warm rain reaches it. Then it puts out a tiny 
root. The seed-leaves stretch themselves out, their 
stem grows, and they creep out of their coat, and 
find their way above ground. 

There they turn green in the sunlight, and 
begin to work up nourishing food. With this 








food tiiey make fresh stems and leaves, till they 
grow^ into big plants, or even trees. 

Another pretty experiment you can make is to 
soak a haricot bean in warm water, and put it on 
the top of some earth in a pot. Keep the earth 
moist and watch the bean, as you did the mustard 
seed. It will take longer to grow. It may be 





1. Soaked Seed. 2. Root appearing. 3. Arched Stem before the Seed-leaves 
rise up. 4. Seed-leaves open with shoots between. 5. Full-grown Bean- 
plant. 

nearly a week before the root finds its way into 
the earth, and another week before the big green 
seed-leaves break out of the seed-coat. 

It is very curious to ^vatch the root. First it 
sends out only one rootlet. Then several more 
grow out, till the bean looks like a big spider 
with long legs. The heavy bean still lies on t)i 


eartli, while the stem goes on growing. So the 
stem forms an arch, with the seed at one end, 
and the root at the other. At last the seed-leaves 
grow thinner as the plant uses the food in them, 
and the stem is strong enough to lift them, so 
that they stand up in the air. They do not leave 
the seed-coat down below, as the mustard seed 
did. They carry it up with them, and it dries and 
falls off at the top. Then you can see the new 
bud, between the seed-leaves, which soon opens 
out into real leaves. 

Grow mustard seed on damp flannel. Soak a haricot bean 
in warm water for one night, and then keep it on very damp 
earth in a flower-pot. 


We left our plants, at the end of the last lesson, 
growing green leaves in the sunlight. Now they go 
on very quickly. Their roots take in water from 
the ground, and the leaves take in gases from the 
air. 

When the plant has made plenty of roots, stems, 
and leaves, it begins to store up food for making 
flowers, in which new seeds will be formed. This is 
a very important work, for seeds are needed 
to grow up into new plants, and so many are 
destroyed by birds and insects or stifled by othei 
plants that, if there were not plenty, the plants 
ivould die out. 

So the seed-l)ox, or ovary, is very carefully 
protected. It grows right in the middle of the 





flower, where it can be closely wrapped up in the 
bud. Even when it grows below the flower, as in 

the honeysucltle, the 
sticky tip is always safe 
inside the bud. 

Gather a Primrose 
and Buttercup in the 
field, and a flower from 
the ro^v of Peas in the 
garden, and look for 
their seed-boxes. In the 
middle of the butter- 
cup flow^er you will find a great number, shaped 
like pears standing up.ido down, with their stalks 
upwards, and in each of these seed-boxes there 
is the beginning of 
a little seed. 

You will have to 
pull the yellow 
crown off the Prim- 
rose before you can 
see the little round 
seed-box sitting in 
the green cup. It 
has a tube growing 
out of it Avith a 
round knob on the 
top. 

In the Pea-flower 
you will find one 
single pod inside 
the flower-leaves, and it has a 




tip. When you open the pod yor will see seven 
or eight white balls inside it, which are the baby 
peas. If you can cut open the seed-box of the 
primrose, you will find the same kind of balls, but 
very small indeed. These balls are soft and trans- 
parent. You can crush them with your fingers 
easily. They are not yet real seeds, but only bags 
of juice, called " ovules." Before they can grow 
into hard seeds, they must use some of the yellow 
grains out of the dust-bags which grow round 
chem. 

This is why the seed-boxes have tips, and beaks 
and knobs. The tip of the buttercup pods, the beak 
at the end of the pea-pod, and the knob at the top 
of the primrose-tube, are all sticky. The yellow 
grains stick to them liKe flies on fly-paper. Tnen 
the grains burst and send some juice down to the 
ovules in the seed-box, and turn them into real 
hard seeds. 

As you go home pick any flower you gee, and 
'-.ry to find its seed-box. You may perhaps pick 
a Poppy in the cornfield. That iias a fine large 
seed-box, like a covered cup, with holes under the 
cover. When the seed-box is ripe, and hangs down 
its head, the seeds fall out at the holes. There are 
so many you could not count them. 

You may pick a Violet, and when you have 
taken off the coloured leaves, you will find a very 
curious seed-box. For the tube, and the sticky 
knob at the top, are just like a bird's neck and 
head. The dust-bags which fit close round the 
seed-box are a lovely orange colour. 




If you can find a pretty purple flower called the 
Marsh Mallow, you will see that the seed-box is like 
a round flat cheese, with a long tube standing up 
in the middle. This tube has eight or twelve red 
sticky points ; there are a great many yellow 
stamens round it. Country 
children often call the 
seed-boxes of the mallow 
"cheeses," ^vhen they are 
ripe and the long tube has 
fallen ofl^. 

But very likely you maj 
pick a Daisy or a Dande- 
lion. Then you will be 
puzzled, for you will not 
find a seed-box in the 
middle. This is because a 
daisy or a dandelion is not 
one flower, but a great 
many flowers crowded to- 
gether in one head. 

Take a dandelion flower- 
head to pieces, and you will 
find that each tiny flower 
will come away from the 
rest. There are more than 

a hundred in one dandelion head. Take one of 
these florets in your hand and have a look at it. 

At the bottom there is an oval bag, that is the 
seed-box. On the top of it there are some fine hairs, 
these are the sepals. Then there is the yellow 
crown with a long strap to it. Inside the crown 




come the stamens, with very long dust-bags, whicb 
cling round the tube. On the top of the tube stand 
two yellow sticky horns. 

So you see this tiny thing is a whole flower, 
growing with its companions on the dandelion 
nead. The daisy is the same, with some little 
differences. See if you can make that out for your- 
self. 

Find the seed-boxes of the pea, wallflowers, shepherd's 
purse, buttercup, primrose, poppy, marsh-mallow, and dande- 
lion. 


As soon as the sun begins to warm the earth you 
may look out for spring flowers. If j^ou have any 
damp ditches near you, you may find in March the 
Marsh Marigold in flower (picture, p. 82). This is 
a plant with hollow stems and dark green leaves 
shaped like a heart, and notched round the edge. 
It has large bright yellow flowers, which children 
often call "king-cups." 

The yellow cuj^ has only one set ot flower-leaves, 
and inside it there are a great many dust-bags and 
yeed-boxes. If you take off one of these seed-boxes 
and look on each side, yovi will find a little hollow 
with some honey in it. 

The bees are very eager to get this honey, as 
it is so early in the year that there are very few 
plants in flower. They want too some of the 
pollen dust to make bee-bread for the baby-beea 

 

The early flies too are in search of food. If you 
watch a bed of king-cups on a sunny day, you will 
see a number of bees and flies settling on the 
flowers. 

They fly from flower to flower sipping a drop in 
each, and as they rub against the dust-bags, they 
carry the pollen-grains with them. 

We saw in the last lesson that plants cannot 
Lnake seeds unless the pollen grows downwards 
into the seed-box, and we find by experiments that 
they make better seeds when the pollen - grains 
come from another flo^ver. So the bees do the 
flowers good, by carrying the pollen, in return for 
the honey that the plants give to them. 

You are sure to find somewhere in the lanes in 
March a pretty little yellow flower like a star, with 
shining heart-shaped green leaves. It is the Lesser 
Celandine, and has a cup of five green sepals, and a 
crown of eight or ten yellow petals. Flies and bees 
come to it in numbers, for it has a drop of honey at 
the thin end of each petal, in the middle of the 
crown. 

If you dig up a bit of this plant, you will find 
some white lumps growing among the roots. Each 
of these has a small bud at the top, and will groAV 
into a plant if you put it into the ground. 

Another flower already out in the fields is the 
common yellow Coltsfoot, a very tiresome weed to 
the farmers. It has a long creeping stem, and 
spreads very quickly underground. It has a flower- 
head, like the dandelion, made of luiudreds of tiny 
flowers. This head grows on a flully stem which 





is covered with pink scales. The leaves do not 
grow till after the flowers are over. 

Look carefully at the flower-head. You wiU 
find about forty tiny round flowers in the middle. 
They have dust-bags in them, and a large drop of 
honey. Round these stand about three hundred 
little flowers, each with a long yellow strap, and 
inside each of these outer flowers is a seed-box 
with two sticky horns. The bees and flies creep 
over these outer florets to suck the honey from 
the flowers in the middle, and on their way back 
they bring some pollen and leave it on the sticky 
horns. 

And now, if you can find in the hedges the 
Cuckoo-pint or Arum I will show you a real trap 
for insects. It is a plant with a green pointed 
hood, and a purple club sticking up in the middle. 
We used to call it "Lords and Ladies," but many 
children call it " Parson-in-the-pulpit." In spring 
this plant has a very strong smell. When the 
flies smell it, they crawl down the purple club to 
look for honey. 

On their way they pass a row of stiff hairs 
(1, p. 33) which bend down with their weight and 
let them pass. Then they come to a ring of red 
dust-bags (2) which are not yet open. Next they 
pass some useless seed-boxes (3) and reach at last 
the true seed-boxes (4) with sticky points. 

Now they have come to the bottom, and they 
look for some honey. Alas! There is none thera 
Then they try to get back. But the stiff hairs 
will not bend upwards, and they are prisoners. 





They are shut in for a day or two, and then the 

sticky points of 

the seed-boxes 

wither, and each 

gives out a drop 

of honey. So the 

flies have not 

been cheated. At 

the same time 

the dust-bags 

burst, and the 

pollen dust falls 

on the flies. Then 

the stamens and 

the hairs wither 

away and the 

flies can get out 

again. 

As they pass 
the withered 
dust-bags, they 
brush off any 
pollen - grains 
which remain, 
and have plenty 
on their backs 
to carry to 
another flower- 
trap. 

You can see 
this for yourself 
if you will look 
V — ni 





for the Parson-in-the-pulpit, and chose two plants, 
one young one with the dust-bags full, and one 
old one in which they are withered. 

Look for marsh marigold, lesser celandine, coltsfoot, and 
arum or cuckoo-pint. 



When the seed-boxes of plants are ripe we call 
them " fruits." I daresay it seems strange to you 
to call a pea-pod a fruit. But if you think of all 
the other fruits you know, you will find that they 
are all seed-boxes. 

The apple is the seed-box of the apple-blossom. 
The gooseberry holds the seed of the gooseberry 
plant. The nut is the fruit of the nut-tree. The 
acorn is the fruit of the oak. 

In peas and broad beans we eat the seeds out of 
the fruit. But in French beans and scarlet-runners 
we eat the whole fruit, seed-box as well as seeds. 
If you walk round a kitchen garden I think you 
can find one, and perhaps two, vegetables of which 
we eat the whole fruit. 

In most gardens there is some corner where the 
dead leaves and rubbish are heaped up to make 
a hot-bed. Earth is thrown over the heap, and 
cucumbers and vegetable marrows are grown 
there. You will see at once that cucumbers and 
marrows are fleshy seed-boxes, for tbev are full of 
seeds. 




Have you ever looked at the flowers of the 
Vegetable Marrow? They are as large and beau- 
tiful as many garden flowers. I want you to notice 
something curiovis in them. 

If you look at several flowers you will see that 
they are not all alike. They all have a pale green 
cup, with five long points, and a grand yellow 
crown. But some, which are very big, have the 
beginning of a 
young marrow 
just under the 
green cup 
while others, 
which are 
smaller, have 
nothing but 
the stem under 
the cup. In a 
few days the 
young mar- 
row will have 
grown bigger. 
But the flow- 
ers which have no marrows under tlum will be 
fading away. 

Look inside the fading flowers. You will see 
some curious twisted pouches full of yellow pollen- 
dust, but you will not find a sticky knob in the 
middle. Then look at the big flower at the top 
of the young marrow. Inside that flower you will 
find some sticky lumps, and most likely some 
yellow dust on them. So you will know that 



these lumps are the top of the seed-box. But 
you will not find any dust-bags in this flower. 

So you see that the vegetable marrow has its 
dust-bags in one flower and its seed-box in another. 
How can the yellow grains get from one flower to 
the other to make the seeds grow ? 

Here the insects help. We found them trouble- 
some when they spoilt the turnips, but now they 
are going to be useful. 

Inside each marrow flower there are some juic^' 
folds, which the bees and flies love to nibble, to 
get the sweet juice. When they press into the 
flower to bite the folds they rub against the 
pouches and carry off some yellow grains on their 
backs. Then they go into the bigger flower to 
bite the folds, and pass the sticky lumps on their 
way. The yellow grains stick on to the lumps, 
and so the ovules of the marrow get the pollen-food 
and are able to grow into seeds. 

The Cucumber flowers are of two kinds, like 
those of the marrow. Perhaps now^ you can guess 
why the gardener is careful to open his frames 
every day. He must not only let in the fresh air. 
He must also give the insects a chance to fly in tc 
the flowers. For if they did not come, there would 
be no one to carry the pollen from one flower to the 
other. Some gardeners pick off a flower with dust- 
bags, and rub it against the sticky lumps of the 
large flower, and so do the same work as the 
insects. 

Pumpkins, melons, and gourds have two kinds of 
flowers like the cucumber and marrow. 






There is one more fruit AV'hieli we eat as a 
vegetable, but I am not sure if you will have 
it in your garden. It is the beautiful tomato, 
vvhich looks like a deep red apple. If you hav€ 
not got it 5'ou should tr}^ to grow it. Cottagers 
often grow it in Devonshire, even when they have 
only a sandy path to plant it in. 

Sow the seeds in a box in February, put a 
piece of glass over it, and keep it in the kitchen 
where it is warm. Then when the little jilants 
have two or three leaves on them, put each plant 
in a small pot with some very sandy earth. 

Keep the plants well watered, and in May put 
the pots outside the house in a warm corner. As 
soon as they are a little hardened you may scoop 
a deep hole in the bed, or path, under a sunny 
wall. Fill it with manure and earth, and put the 
plants in out of the pots. They will grow against 
the wall and give you fine tomatoes. Only you 
must be careful to keep off the slugs and snails, 
for they love the sweet tomato juice as much as 
we do. 

When the fruits are big, if the weather is i\v.\ 
warm enough for them to ripen out of doors, you 
may pick them and put them on the kitchen 
shelves and they will turn red and be fit to 
eat. 

Bring the two kinds of flowers which grow on the vegetable 
man-ow plant— also those of the cucumber. Bring in the fruit 
of a marrow, a cucumber, and a tomato. 



When the spring flowers are beginning to peep out 
in the fields, your father will be hard at work in the 
garden. In March, if not before, neat seed beds of 
cabbage, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and cauliflo^wer 
will have to be sown, for planting out by-and-by. 
Early turnips must now be sown in their rows, 
and radishes and mustard and cress may be grown 
for salad. 

All these belong to the family which have 
flowers in the form of a cross. So you see this is a 
very useful family to gardeners. It gives us, besides 
the lovely wallflower, the purple stock and the 
sweet alyssum in our flower garden, as well as the 
watercress in the brooks. 

But as soon as our cabbage plants begin to grow, 
we find that the insects, vi^hich are so useful in help- 
ing to make seeds, can do harm in a kitchen garden. 
Early in May, before the plants are very large, you 
will see the white cabbage butterfly with two black 
spots on her wings, flitting about the garden. (Sec 
p. S.) 

Where do you think she has come from? All 
the winter her body has been covered with a hard 
gum, which spread over it when she wriggled out 
of her caterpillar skin, and fastened herself by 
?silken threads to the stem of an old cabbage stalk» 
or hid perhaps in a crack in the palings. 

Now that the sun is warm she has come out to 
lay her eggs. She does not feed on cabbages her- 
self, she sips honey from the floweps. But slie fed 



on leaves when she was a caterpillar, so she lays her 
eggs under a cabbage leaf, where the caterpillars 
will find food when they are hatched. 

The Tortoiseshell Butterfly, out in the fields, layt 
her eggs on stinging nettles, because her cater- 
pillars feed on nettle leaves. They weave a little 
tent under the leaves to come back to at night, and 
there you may find them. 

But if you want to save your cabbages from 
being eaten by caterpillars, you must look for the 
eggs of the white cabbage butterfly under the 
cabbage leaves. They are very tiny, but in a 
fortnight they will hatch out into little green 
caterpillars with black spots, and a yellow line 
down their backs. 

They eat and eat for about a month, and then 
about July or August they creep away to some tree 
or paling, and bind themselves there by their silken 
thread till next spring. Then each Lutterfly como^^ 
out to lay her eggs on fresh cabbages. 

il: you search very carefully all about your 
garden and in the shed, and along the palings in 
the winter, you may find and destroy the chrysalis 
and help to save your cabbages from the cater- 
pillars. 

But if you see some little white balls, about the 
size of a hemp-seed, lying near a dead caterpillar, 
take care not to destroy them. They are the 
cocoons of a little fly, which lays her egg in the 
body of the caterpillar of the white cabbage butter- 
fly, and when the egg is hatched the grub feeds 
upon the inside of the caterpillar. 





Is it not a curious history ? The butterfly sucks 
honey from the flowers, and carries their pollen- 
dust for them. Then she lays her eggs under a 
cabbage leaf and dies. The caterpillar feeds on 
the cabbage, and then perhaps a little fly comes, 
and lays her e^^ in him ; and the grub feeds on 
him, so that "when the time comes for him to turn 
into a butterfly he dies instead. 

Many other creatures feed on our cabbage. 
Slugs and snails like green meat, and the gall 
?weevil, which we saw feeding on the turnip, likes 
cabbage root as well. The best way to keep all 
enemies away is to make the ground clean and 
free from weeds, and to pick off all the insects 
you find. 

Find any Crucifers (flowers formed in a cross) you can — 
wallflower, candytuft, stock, charlock, turnip, and any cab- 
bage plant which is run to seed. Try to find the chrysalis 
of the cabbage butterfly. 





In May the hedgerows will be full of flowers. I 
have not room to describe them all to you. You 
should pick one of each, on your way to school, and 
ask your teacher about them. On the tops of the. 
banks, and nestling in the wood, you "will find the 
wild hyacmths, which children call bluebells, and 
the red ragged-robin, and the lovely starworts or 
stitchw^orts with flowers like pure white stars and 
narrow pointed leaves. Children call these " snap- 




Jacks," because the seed-box, when it is ripe, snaps 
if you pinch it. There are many kinds of star- 
worts. One of them with small floAvers is called 
chickweed. 

The meadows are now golden with buttercvips, 
and the ditches are blue with forget-me-nots, and 
you can find the little blue Sj)eedwell or Bird's-eye 
almost anywhere. It is a weed, with thin weak 
stalks, and you may know it by its four blue petals, 
and its two stamens standing out like horns. Be- 
fore long the tall Meadow-sweet, with its clusters 
of tiny white flowers, will be blooming by the side 
of the streams and in damp j)laces ; and the pretty 
little Bird's-foot Trefoil will brighten the hedgerows 
and fields. 

You will know this little flower well. It grows 
quite low down, and is like a very small yellow 
pea-flower. About four or five little blossoms grow 
on tb.e top of each flower-stalk, and the buds have 
bright red streaks upon them. When the pods are 
ripe they stand out like the toes of a bird's foot. 

These, and many other flowers, you can find in 
the fields and hedges and you know now how to 
look for their seed-boxes and dust-bags; and I am 
sure you will watch to see what flies and bees and 
beetles come to fetch honey and pollen-dust. 

If you do this and keep your eyes open, you will 
find out that other creatures come to the i)lants and 
flowers, which are not as useful to them as the bees. 
There is the cow, which takes large mouthfuls of 
their leaves as she grazes. There is the donkey, 
which feeds on the thistles. There is the rabbit, 





which conies out in the evening., to nibble at the 
tender young shoots ; and there are the little field- 
mice, w^hich scrape away the earth and feed on 
the thick stems and roots underground. 

Now let me tell you of a few plants which 
protect themselves, and perhaps you can find more. 
First come the Anemone and the meadow Butter- 
cup. Both these have bitter leaves which burn your 
tongue w^hen you bite them. If you walk across 
a field which has many buttercups in it you will 
find that the cows and the sheep have left them 
alone as much as they can. If they eat the leaves, 
they will not touch the flowers, which are much the 
most acrid. So these plants prevent the cows from 
killing them. In the same Avay the leaves of wild 
geraniums have a disagreeable taste and smell. 

Then there are the Ferns. They have a great deal 
of bitter tannin in them. You will find that if cows 
or sheep have been feeding where the Bracken fern 
is grow^ing, they will not have touched it. So the 
ferns keep themselves safe. 

Then the little Wood-sorrel tastes acid, and the 
Speedwells dry up the inside of your mouth if you 
eat their leaves. So these plants are left alone. 
Lastly the Parson-in-the-pulpit has such poisonous 
berries, leaves, and underground stems, that no 
animal will eat it above ground, and no sensible 
field-mouse would think of nibbling at it under- 
ground. 

Then there are the plants which grow thorns on 
their stems. Cows and horses do not like to eat 
gorse for it hurts their tender mouths. These 



Plants want bees and flies to visit their flowers, 
because they carry their pollen from flower to 
flower. But other insects, such as ants and spiders, 
like honey too, and they only crawl ; they rub ofC 
any dust which falls on them before they reach 
another flower. So they rob the flowers of their 
honey and do nothing in return. 

How do you think the plants protect them- 
selves? In many difl'erent ways. The Teasel has 
a large flower-head full of honey. But the ants 
cannot steal it because its leaves grow opposite to 
each other on the stem, and join round it so that 
they make a little basin. The dew and the rain 
collect in the basin, and stop the ants from creep- 
ing past. 

Then the piants we call Campions, of which the 
ragged-robin is one (p. 45), often have their flower 
stems covered with flne hairs, and the stem near 
the flower is very sticky. When the ants climb up 
to try to steal the honey they stick fast, and can 
get no further. This is why some of the campions 
ire often called " catch-flies." 

A very common plant in the hedges is the Sun- 
spurge (p. 45), which has curious small green 
flowers. This plant has a poisonous milky juice 
in its stem. When the ants try to climb up, they 
prick holes with their claws, and stick fast and die. 

I wish I could tell j^ou more of the way in which 
plants protect themselves by jjrickles, by hairs, and 
by poisons, but you must look for yourselves. 

Bring in sun-spurge, campion or catch-fly, wood-sorrel, 
bracken teasel, and wild geranium. 




Now you know how wild plants grow, how insects 
halp to make the seeds, and how plants have to 
defend themselves from enemies which would eat 
their leaves or steal their honey. 

Next let us look at the flow^ers in our gardens 
and see how far they are like the wild ones in the 
fields. All garden plants grow wild in some part 
of the world. We have taken them into our 
gardens, and made their flowers larger and 
brighter. Some still live wild in England, others 
have been brought from foreign countries. 

The forget-me-nots in the garden border are 
very much the same as those we find in the lanes. 
The snowdrop has run wild in many parts of Eng- 
land. The lovely blue periwinkle, with its dark 
shiny leaves, grows in every Devonshire lane. The 
large ox-eye daisies which gro^v in our gardens are 
the same as those in the cornfields. The honey- 
suckle is as fine in the hedges as on the trellis-work 
of the porch. 

But the large purple clematis and the beau- 
tiful yellow and white chrysanthemums, which 
gro^v^ in so many cottage gardens, come from 
abroad. I knew an old woman once who called 
them "Christmas anthems." I think she imagined 
that they flowered late in the year on purpose for 
Christmas. 

The lovely yellow and purple pansies, which 





bloom all the summer, seem at first too grand to 
have come from wild ones. But you can gather 
small wild pansies in the lanes, and if you look 
inside the flower of the garden pansy you will see 

the curious bird's head 
on the top of its seed- 
box which w^e found 
in the violet. So the 
pansy, or Heartsease, 
is a true English 
plant. 

I am sure you have 
some of the yellow 
and bro^vn polyanthus 
in your garden. At 
first you will think 
there is nothing like 
it in the fields. But if 
you gather a cowslip 
and compare it with 
the polyanthus, you 
will find that all their 
parts are alike. For 
the polyanthus was 
once wild like the 
cowslip, and the gardeners have manured it, and 
chosen out the best seeds, till they have given it 
the bright colours it has now. 

The reason that garden flowers are often larger 
and more beautiful in their colours than wild 
flowers is because the plants are not obliged to 
take so much pains to live nor to make so many 



 

seeds. The gardener puts tliem in good ground, 
feeds them well, and picks out the seeds of the 
best flowers to sow next year. 

You can do the same if you try, and though you 
pannot do much in a few years you will get much 
finer flowers for your trouble. You must watch the 
plant and pick off all the withered leaves, and keep 
the ground raked, well manured, and free from 
weeds. Then you must settle which of the plants 
have the best and brightest flowers. Tie a little 
piece of cotton round the stem of these flowers, 
and watch when their seed-boxes are ripe, then 
keep those seeds to sow next year. In two or 
three years you will have much better flowers. 

The pinks and carnations are some of the 
prettiest and sweetest of our garden flowers. 
They belong to an English family, called the Pink 
Family. You may perhaps not have any wild pinks 
in your part of the country. But you will have the 
ragged robin and the campion, and these belong to 
the same family. 

If you compare their flowers with the pink, you 
will find that they both have narrow leaves grow- 
ing opposite each other. The stem is swollen at 
the joint where they grow. They both have a long 
green cup with points, and five pink or white petals, 
ragged at the edge. Ten stamens grow inside on 
the top of the stem, and there is a tall seed-box in 
the middle, with two or three sticky horns. 

Now try to find a ripe seed-box. It will be 
open at the top and its points bend out like the top 
of a vase. Inside is a little upright pillar with the 



seeds growing round it. When you find all this in 
a flower you will know that it belongs to the Pink 
Family. 

Chickweed, starwort, campion, soapwort, ragged 
robin, and wild pink can all be found in the lanes. 

But no doubt you have in your garden some 
double flowers — pinks, wallflowers, stocks, and roses. 
These have a great many coloured petals, and 
hardly any dust-bags or seed-box, sometimes none 
at all. Gardeners have made these double flowers 
by growing the j)lants in very rich earth, and 
sowing the seeds of those which grew the most 
flower-leaves instead of stamens. 

Plants in the fields hardly ever have double 
flowers. They must make plenty of seeds. If you 
turn a plant with double flowers out into poor 
grovmd and let it run wild, it will go back to single 
flowers. But gardeners want fine blooms. So they 
grow double hollyhocks, dahlias, peonies, and prmi- 
roses, as well as single ones. 

Compare wild and garden rose, wild and garden pansy, 
cowslip and polyanthus, pink and ragged robin. 



In June the dog-roses are in bloom. They look very 
pretty thrusting their pink and white flowers out 
of the hedge. Though they have thorns, you can 
manage to cut a branch and take it to school. We 
will learn to-day about the rose family. 

I shall want you to bring a good many flowers 




and fruits from the hedges and the garden, besides 
the rose. You remember that some of our best 
vegetables come from the flowers shaped hke a cross. 
Now you will see that some of our best fruits come 
from the Rose Family. (See frontispiece.) 

So bring from the hedges a branch of wild rose. 
It must be ^"ild, for you remember our garden roses 
have turned most of their stamens into flower- 
leaves. Next get if you can a piece of bramble with 
a blackberry flower on it. Then from the bank 
below bring a wild strawberry plant. Get one if 
you can with a ripe strawberry hanging on it, as 
well as the flower. For there is another plant 
called the potentilla which is so like the wild straw- 
berry that you might bring it by mistake, unless 
you saw the little strawberry fruit. 

Then bring from your garden a straw^berry, f 
raspberry, a cherry, and a plum, a green apple and 
a pear. What a number we shall have ! And yel 
you might bring a peach, a medlar, a quince, a 
nectarine, and an apricot as well, for all these fruits 
belong to the Rose Family. Only I expect you will 
not have them in your garden. 

First let us look at the flowers. You will see 
that the Wild Rose has a very deep cup, with five 
green sepals, which stick out in long points. (See 
p. 47.) 

If it is a dog-rose its crown will be made of five 
lovely pink petals. They are all separate, so that 
you can pull each one off the green cup, without 
disturbing the others. If you pull them all off, you 
will find that there are a great many dust-bags 
gro"^dng on the rim of the green cup. 





No\v look for the seed-boxes. Their sticky tops 
are peeping out of the cup. But you will have to 
tear the cup open to find them inside. Then you 
will see that they are all separate and that each 
one has a sticky top of its own. 

Now look at the Strawberry flower: it too has 
five green sepals and five white petals, and a great 
many dust-bags, just like the rose. But it has no 
deep cup. Its seed-boxes grow on a little mound 
inside the sepals. By-and-by this mound ^\all 
swell and grow soft and juicy and sweet, and the 
tiny seed-boxes will be buried in it, like pins in a 
pincushion. Look at the little fruit of the wild 
strawberry and the big fruit of the garden straw- 
berry and you will see this. People often call these 
dry pips " seeds," but they are not seeds, they are 
tiny seed-boxes, each with one seed inside. 

Now look at the Blackberry flower. It is just 
like the strawberry, and its seed-boxes grow on a 
mound. But when the fruit is ripe, you will find 
that the mound is no bigger. In the blackberry, 
the seed-boxes themselves grow soft, and become 
small balls full of sweet juice. You can separate 
them one from another, and you will find a seed 
inside each. 

The Raspberry is like the blackberry, only the 
little red juicy seed-boxes shrink away from the 
mound. So you can pull them off like a cap, 
leaving the white pointed mound behind. 

And now how about the other fruits ? Next 
spring Av hen the Plum trees and Cherry trees are 
in bloom, you will find that they have the same 




kind of flowers as the rose. But they have only 
one seed-box to each flower. This seed-box groAvs 
juicy outside, and leaves a very hard shell inside, 
round the seed. So you have to eat the juicy 
covering and crack ths 
hard shell before you can 
get at the kernel or 
seed. 

The Apple and the 
Pear will puzzle you, till 
you cut an apple across. 
Then you will see the 
five Httle seed-boxes ar- 
ranged like a star in 
the middle of the fruit. 
Each seed-box will have 
one or two pips or seeds 
in it, and the boxes are 
what we call the core of 
the apple. The green cup 
has grown thick and 
fleshy all round them. 
You can see the dried 
tips of the green sepals 
on the top of the apple. 
In the apple blossom the 
seed-boxes are separate, 
till the cup grows round them, and makes one big 
apple. 

Bring a wild rose, a piece of blackberry in flower, a wild 
strawben-y in flower, an apple, near, plum, cherry, raspberry, 
and g iden strawberry. 




 

When a bee goes in search of honey, there is one 
plant she is very glad to find. This is the Dead- 
nettle. She does not mind whether it has white 
or purple flowers. She knows that unless some 
other bee has been there before 
her she will find some honey. 

There are generally plenty of 
dead-nettles to be found, for their 
leaves do not taste nice, and they 
look so like stinging-nettles that 
very few animals will eat them. 

The real nettle has only small 
green flowers, while the dead- 
nettle has clusters of red or ^vhite 
blossoms growing all round the 
stem, just above each pair of 
leaves. These flowers are shaped 
like helmets, and they have a 
broad lip hanging down in front, which has a 
deep notch in the middle. 

The stem of the plant is not round, like the 
stems of most i3lants. It is square with four sides. 
By this you may always know it from a sting- 
ing-nettle, even when it is not in flower. The 
coarse leaves grow opposite to each other, and 
each pair grows across the one below it, as we saw 
in Lesson II. 

Now let us look at the flower. You had better 




take a white dead-nettle, as the flowers are k^rt^e. 
Take hokl of the hehnet and pull it very gently. It 
will come off, leaving the green cup with its five 
points. But most likely you will have hrought 
away the long tube w' itli sticky horns, which grows 
out of the seed-box, for 
it comes off very easily. 

If you have, try an- 
other flower, and tear 
the helmet open very 
carefully. Then you 
will see that at the 
bottom of the cup there 
are four little seed- 
boxes, like nuts, with 
a long tube standing 
right up in the middle 
of them. It has two 
sticky horns. 

Now look inside an- 
other flower. You will 
find four stamens grow- 
ing on the cro^vn, and 
two of them are so long that they reach right up 
into the hood. Before you pulled the hood off the 
sticky horns w^ere close to them. At the bottom 
of the tube there is plenty of honey, but creeping 
insects cannot get it, for there is a thick fringe of 
hairs in the tube to keep them away. 

But when the bee comes for honey, she pushes 
her trunk through the hairs, and as she sucks she 
brushes the dust out of the bags. Then she goes 





to another flower and leaves it on the sticky 
horns. There are a great many flowers with lips 
like the dead-nettle. Mint, Sage, Balm, Thyme, 
Pepx^ermint, Lavender, Rosemary, and the pretty 
blue and white bugle flowers in the hedges are all 
lipped— you wall know them by their square stems, 

opposite leaves, and the 
four little seed-boxes. 

In Sage plants the 
anthers swing on a bar. 
The bee hits her head 
against the lower end, 

 which Is empty, and the 

 full dust-bag COmeS down 



on her back. 

Another flower which the bee loves is the Pea, 
There again she is sure to find honey. In the 
kitchen garden on a fine morning you will see the 
bees buzzing along the rows of peas and beans, and 
only stopping to poke their heads into the flowers. 

Get a pea-flower and let us see how they do it. 
Hold the flower facing you. At the back is one 
large petal, with a deep dent in the middle. This 
stands up like a flag to tell the bee where to come 
for honey. So it is called the " standard." Two 
smaller petals are folded together, just below it. 
These are called "wings." Between these wangs are 
two more petals, which are joined together like the 
end of a boat. These are called the " keel." 

If you take hold of the wings, and pull them 
gently down, you will find they bring the keel witu 
them. Then you will see the dust-bags of ten 





stamens and the sticky beak of the tiny pea-pod 
These Tvere hidden before in the keel. 

If you pick the flower to pieces, you will see why 
Ihe keel came down. Inside each wing there is a 
knob, which fits into a hollow in the side of the 
keel. Is not this curious ? When the bee settles on 
the wings, she presses them down with her weight. 
They press down the keel, and the dust-bags knock 
against the breast of the bee. So she goes away to 
the next flower covered with pollen-dust. 

There are almost as many flowers like the pea 
as there are like the dead-nettle. The beautiful 
3^ellow Gorse, the little Trefoil, and all the Vetches 
in the hedges belong to this family. So do the 
sweet Clovers which we grow for clover hay. Each 
head of clover is a cluster of tiny flowers shaped 
like a pea. 

Then in the flower garden ^ve have the Laburnum, 
and in the kitchen garden the Scarlet-runners and 
the Broad Beans. 

Examine a dead-nettle, mint, thyme, and meadow-sage. 
Notice the cuiious swinging anther of the meadow-sage. Also 
a pea blossom, gorse blossom, tare, and bird's-foot trefoil. 



When you were picking the flowers of the peas and 
scarlet-runners, if you kept your eyes open, you must 
have noticed that they climb up the sticks which we 
put for them. But I daresay you did not ask your- 
self why theyclimb, nor how they climb. 







You know that if you took the sticks away they 
would fall in a tangled mass on the ground. For 
peas and scarlet-runners have thin weak steins. 
They could not get enough light and air all tumbled 

together on the 
ground. They 

would be stifled 
under other plants 
So they have learnt 
to climb up on a 
hedge or sticks, or 
anything they can 
find, to lift them 
towards the sky. 

That is why 
they climb, now let 
us see how they 
do it. For they do 
not both set to 
work in the same 
way. 

You will find 
on the pea-plant 
that in many places 
where a leaf ought 
to be, there is a 
little curled green 
thread, which clings round the twig of the stick, 
just as a baby clings to its mother's finger. We 
call these threads " tendrils." They hold the plant 
up to the light and air, and let the blossoms hang 
out where the bees can find them. The scarlet 






runners do their climbing differently. They do 
not use their loaves, but twine their whole 

stem round the 
sticks. 

If you look 
along the hedges 
you will find 
many climbing 
plants, which 
manage to use 
the thick 
bushes as a 




sort of bank on which to spread out their leaves 
and flowers. There is the Clematis, or Traveller's 
Joy. It has not turned its leaves into tendrils, 




nor twined its stem. It twists the stalk of the 
leaves tightly round the twigs, so that the leaves 
stand out at the end. Its pretty greenish flowers 
are spread in this way all over the top of the 
hedge, and by-and-by the feathery seed-boxes will 
hang like an old man's beard, just where the wind 
can catch them to blow them away. 

I think you must know the Goose-grass or 
Cleavers, which grows over everything in the lanes 
Its narrow green leaves are arranged round the 
stem like a star, and it has very tiny white flowers. 
The stem, leaves and seed-boxes are all crowded 
with tiny hooks so that it clings to your hand 
when you gather it. It is really a very weak 
plant, but it clings to other plants which are 
stronger, and so raises itself up. 

The blackberry and other brambles climb in 
the same way, and the wild rose climbs by its 
thorns. Further along the hedgerow the wild Hop 
may be growing. Its stems die down every year 
and grow up again in the spring. Yet it manages 
to spread a long way, for its stem twines round 
twigs and small trees, and everything it can find, 
spreading out its broad leaves shaped like a heart. 
You will find the flowers of the hop rather puzzling, 
for its dust-bags and seed-boxes grow on different 
2)lants. 

The Honeysuckle, too, twines its stem, as you 
must have seen on the porch or the paling. Some- 
times when it twines round a young branch, it 
winds itself so tightly that the branch cannot grow 
in the places where the honevsuckle binds it. So 




it is marked all the way up, as if it had a ribbon 

round it. 

Then there are the pretty p)lants called Tares or 

vetches, which have flowers like small j^ea-flowers. 

They cKmb everywhere by their tendrils. I think 

you will be able to find 
all these as well as the 
Convolvulus or bindweed, 
which twines round all 
plants, even our goose- 
berry and currant bushes, 
and wants weeding out 
very carefully. But I am 
not quite sure whether 
you can find a curious 
plant called the Dodder. 
You must look for it on 
the common, climbing 
over the heath and gorse 
bushes. It is only a thin 
wiry stem, with clusters 
of tiny pink flowers on 
it. It has no leaves at 
all. How then can it live 
since it has no leaves to 
make food? It twines 

round the gorse, or heath, or clover, and sends its 

roots into their stems and sucks out ready-made 

food! 

The Vine and the pretty Virginia creepers turn 

their small branches into threads for climbing. 

Very likely you have a Virginia creeper on your 




wall, which turns red in the autumn. Two kinds 
of this creeper have a very curious plan for 
climbing. . When the threads, or tendrils, touch 
the wall, their tips turn red, and swell into little 
cushions. These cushions stick so fast to the ^vall 
that even when the branch is dead you have to 
pull them off. Lastly the Ivy climbs by small 
roots, which grow all along the stems. 

Now you know all the four dodges which plants 
have for climbing. By hooks, by threads, by their 
roots, and by the ^vhole plant twining itself round. 
Try to see how many you can find. 

Bring one of each kind of climbing plant. 



Some plants live for one year only. Some live for 
two years. Some live for many years. 

Have you not noticed that you have to sow 
mignonette, marigolds, and peas and beans fresh 
every year in the garden? — unless you keep the 
young seedlings, which grow from the seeds that 
fall. In the fields, wheat and oats only live till 
their grains are rij)e, and then die away if they 
are left in the ground till winter comes. 

In the same way chick^veed, the corn poppy, and 
our old friend the shepherd's purse die when their 
seeds are ripe. These plants are like people who 
earn just enough to live from day to day, an(3 
cannot save for next .year, 



But if you want to have Sweet Williams, or 
Canterbury Bells in flower in the summer, you must 
sow the seeds the summer before. For these plants 
do not flower the first year. They only grow their 
root, and a short stem with leaAes on it. The 
plant is busy making food, and storing it up in 
the root and stem, as starch and sugar and gum, 
so that it is ready to make a strong flowering plaiit 
next year. 

Then after they have flowered and made theii 
seeds, these plants die. They have only stored 
enough for a short life, and cannot live anothei 
year. Foxgloves, Thistles, and Wild Parsley behave 
in this way. 

Lastly, you know that Snowdrops, Crocuses, 
Daisies, Primroses, Pansies, and Dahlias live on for 
many years, dying down in the autumn and coming 
up again in the spring. These plants send down 
the starch and sugar into the root, or the lower 
part of the stem, or into the bottom of the leaves 
underground. 

Some of them grow more than two years before 
they try to flower. They are like people who save 
when they are young, and always go on saving, so 
that they have something to spare. 

You can sometimes make a plant store up food. 
If you sow some mignonette and put one plant in a 
pot, and keep on nipping off the flower-buds so that 
it cannot make seeds, it will grow into a little shrub, 
and flower for two or three years. 

Different plants store . their food in differenf' 
parts. The wild carrot and the acorn, which is. 


growing into an oak, store theirs in the root. The 
carrot is fleshy and only lasts two years. But the 
root of the oak is woody and lives long. 

The lesser celandine, you remember, stores its 
food in small white lumps like white sugar-plums, 
which are swollen roots with a bud at the top. The 
marsh marigolds, and the pretty yellow flags, which 
^row by the river, store theirs in an underground 
stem. You must follow the stalks of the marsh 
marigold right back till you come close to the roots, 
and there you will find the thick knob, which lives 
on, all through the winter, and sends up fresh leaves 
in the spring. 

If you can get a long piece of the creeping stem 
of the yellow flag, you will see the marks of the 
places w^here the flowering stems have come up year 
after year. They follow each other along the stem 
till you come to the plant of this year. And beyond 
that is the bud for next year. 

Thei'e is a very pretty plant called Solomon's Seal, 
which is wild in some parts of England, and is often 
grown in cottage gardens. It has a tall flower- 
stalk with rather narrow leaves, and lovely white 
flowers, with green tips. The flowers hang down all 
on one side of the stalk. If you dig up a piece of 
the stem of this plant you will see large scars like 
seals upon it. These are the places where the stems 
have grown year after year, and this is why it is 
called Solomon's Seal. 

You can make out for yourself the mass of stems 
and buds people call a primrose root. I want now 
to show you an underground bud or bulb. Dig up 



a wild hyacinth, usually called a 
will find that it has a large knob 
with small roots grooving 
out of it. Cut tliis knoh in 
half, and notice that it is a 
bulb made of 
scaly leaves 
folded one 
over the 
other, ex- 
actly like an 
onion. 

If you dig 
it up in the 
spring, the 
flower - stalk 
will be standing 
up in the niiddk*, 
and when you pull 
the scaly leaves off 
one by one, you 
w^ill find another 
bud very small 
close to the bottom of the flower- 
stalk. If you dig up another 
plant in the autumn, the flower- 
stalk will have withered away, 
and the baby bud will be peeping 
out of the top of the bulb. 

This is what has happened. 
After the hyacinth left off 
flowering, the leaves grew long 



blue-bell. You 
at the bottom, 




primrose and solo 
mon's seal. 

Showing tlin thick stems ill 
which food is stored. 



and made food. 




and sent it down to the scaly leaves under- 
ground. The bulb grew fat and strong, and the 
}niall bulb mside grew larger. Now it is ready to 
lie quiet all the winter. When the spring conies 
the little bulb will take the food from the thick 
scaly leaves, and grow into a new plant. 

Bring six plants — two with food stored in the root, two 
in the vmdei'ground stem, two in bulbs. 



Now you will be able to understand how it is that 
we get such nourishing vegetables from the kitchen 
garden. The bees take honey and pollen from the 
flowers of plants. We take the sugar and starch 
and other food, which they store up in their leaves, 
and steins, and roots. 

Carrots, Parsnips, and Beet-roots are plants Avhich 
store up food in their roots the first year, and 
flower the second year. So we sow them, and feed 
them very w ell the first year, and ^ hen they have 
laid up a good store of sweet food, we jjuU them up 
and eat them before they can flower. 

If you can get your father to leave one of these 
plants in the ground till the second year, you will 
see it flower and make its seeds. But a turnip will 
flower in the first year, if you sow it early in the 
spring, and leave it all the summer. This is why 
we sow our largest stock of turnips in June and 
July so that they may not flower before w^e want 
them in the winter 






A carrot badly-grown and well-grown. Asparagus in the bud, as we eat it, and with its 
red seeds as it ripens. Onion cut across to show the scaly leaves iu which food 
is stored. 




Now I think I hear a little boy saying, " She has 
forgotten potatoes." No, I have not. But potatoes 
are not roots, like carrots and turnips. Cut one 
open and you will see some dark spots in it called 
' eyes," Indeed you may see tliem without cutting 
if you wash it and look carefully. 

Each of these eyes is a little bud, with a growing 
tip, and the beginning of leaves. Noav you know 
that a root cannot bear leaves. It can onlj^ have 
one bud on the top where the stem begins. So the 
potato cannot be a root. 

Next time you dig up some potatoes for dinner, 
look at the roots carefully before j^ou shake off the 
potatoes. You will then see that each potato grows 
at the end of a white stalk, very different from the 
roots. For a potato is a swelling at the end of a 
stem, which grows underground. It is a " tuber " 
hke the Jerusalem Artichokes, which I expect you 
also have in the garden. 

If you cut up either an artichoke or a ])otato into 
pieces, and leave a bud in each piece, it will grow 
vip into a new plant, and send down food into the 
stems below the ground, and form more tubers. 
The potato plant flowers, and forms seed every 
year. The seed-box is poisonous, and so are the 
seed-boxes of many of the Potato Family. The 
Deadly Nightshade, with its dark black berries, 
belongs to this family. It is never safe to eat 
any berry, or other fruit, unless you know what 
it is, for many berries -which even the birds eat, 
are poisonous to some animals and to man. 

The potato plant stores its poison only in its 





seed-box, which is green, there is none in the 
potato. The potato disease which gives us so 
much trouble is a little plant like the mould on 
jam, which eats the potato away. 

In Celery we eat the stems which gro^\' above 
ground. But we earth them up to keep them 
white. For plants cannot become green without 
sunlight. In Asparagus we eat the green stem with 
the bud at the top. Those buds which we do not 
eat branch out in summer, and have beautiful 
leaves and bright red berries. 

Lastly in Onions, Leeks, and Shallots we eat 
the bulbs, or underground buds, like that of the 
hyacinth. They have plenty of good food in them 
stored up in the scaly leaves. 

Now let us see what you must do if you want 
your roots, bulbs, and stems to grow into good 
vegetables. First you must drain the ground if it 
wants it, and dig it deeply and break the earth up 
so that the roots have no hard lumps in their way 
and can grow straight and strong. Then you must 
dig in some manure. And be careful that you dig 
it in deep, for grubs and maggots like carrots and 
onions as much as we do ; and in the autumn and 
spring, when you dig the garden, they are lying 
about in their cocoon shells. If you bviry them 
deeply in the ground, then when they turn into 
flies they cannot get out to lay eggs. 

There is another way in which you can get the 
better of them. Each plant has its own grub which 
feeds upon it. There is the grub of the onion fly, of 
bhe carrot fly, and so on. So when you sow your 





seed, if you so^v the carrots where the onions were 
last year, and the onions in the old parsnip bed, 
when the fly is hatched she does not find the leaves 
for her eggs close at hand, and you may save your 
roots. 

Then in such plants as carrots and onions you 
must keep the roots and bulbs well covered, and 
when you thin them out you must make the 
ground firm again. For the onion fly and the 
carrot fly lay their eggs on the root or bulb, and 
if they cannot find their way in, the root is 
safe. 

Lastly, you know the troublesome wireworm 
which wriggles along just underground and eats 
everything it finds. To be even with him you must 
keep the ground clean, for he likes rubbish to hide 
in, and you had better mix some salt or lime with 
the earth. If he is still troublesome you can put 
some slices of potato just under the ground and 
stick a t^ag in, to show where they are, and you 
are pretty sure to find him underneath in the 
early morning. 

Bring six vegetables — 1, root ; 2, bulb ; 3, stern ; 4, tnber; 
5. leaves ; 6, flowers. 




In the autumn, when the plants have left off 
flowering, there is plenty for us to do in looking 
for fruits, and finding out how they scatter their 
seeds. 

Some drop them near at home. The poppy, as 
we saw, has a hard fruit with little openings under 
the cover. When the stalk bends the seeds fall out 
through these holes and grow in the ground all 
around. 

If you look at the dry seed-boxes of the wild 
geranium which grows in the lanes, you will see 
that each one has curled up from the bottom. 
There will be five little curls round the sticky 
knob in the middle, and the seeds will be gone. 

There is a tall yellow Balsam which is found wild 
in some parts of England, and another with reddish 
flowers, which is often grown in cottage gardens, 
which have a most amusing seed-box. When it is 
ripe it bursts open and flings out its seeds. If you 
can get a friend to touch a ripe pod, it will make 
you laugh to see how he jumps as it pops with a 
bang ill his hand. This is why the plant is often 
called " touch-me-not." 

But plants want their seeds to be carried farther 

away than even pojiping will send them. Think 

iiow many flowers there are crowded together in 

hedgerow. If all the seeds fell close round they 




would stifle each other. So plants try all sorts of 
plans to get their seeds scattered. 

I am sure you have blown the feathery dande- 
lion "clocks" on your way home from school. 
Next time you do it look at one of the little floating 




messengers. Do you remember that when we 
looked at the dandelion we found that it was a 
flower-head with hundreds of tiny flowers, and 
that each flower had an oval seed-bag at the 
bottom Avith a number of fine hairs on the top of 
it and a yellow crown with a long strap ? 




Now the yellow cro^vn has withered away, and 
che top of the seed-box has grown up into a long 
neck with the hairy sepals on the top {see Fig., p. 25). 
A.nd when the wind catches these hairs it carries 
the tiny fruit along perhaps for miles, and then 
it drops down to grow. 

Thistles and sow-thistles, groundsel and teasels, 
and a number of other flowers of that kind have 
these feathery seeds. So you see when you let 
them grow on your own ground you spoil the 
ground of other people as well. 

This is the way that wind carries seeds. 

Other seeds are washed down by streams and 
left on their banks, Others, again, are often 
carried in the mud that sticks to the feet of birds. 

Another plan is to grow tiny hooks on the seed- 
boxes so that animals carry them. The goose-grass 
does this. We saw on p. 64 that it has tiny hooks 
all over its stem and leaves, which it uses for 
climbing. It has the same kind of hooks on its 
tiny seeds. If you take a bunch of goose-grass 
in your hand you will get a number of the very 
small seed-boxes sticking to your fingers. 

But there is a much bigger " burr," wnich 
grows on the common Burdock in the lanes. The 
burdock (see p. 77) is a tall plant, with very large 
heart-shaped leaves and pink flower-heads, some- 
thing like a thistle. You often bring its burrs 
home on your clothes, dogs carry them in their 
hair, and sheep in their fleece. Each of these burrs 
is a cup of leaves covered with hooks. The leaves 
grow together into a ball with the flowers peeping 




Out at the top, and if you open a ripe burr you will 
find the tiny fruit inside. 

So you, and the dogs, and the sheep carry the 
seeds for the plants. 

But the prettiest plan of all is when the seed- 
box growls into a sloe, or a cherry, or into some 
bright berry like the berries of the hawthorn and 
the honeysuckle. For then the birds come to eat 
the nice fruit, and when they carry it off to some 
tree near they drop the stone down in a new place. 
Or they eat the berry, and the hard seeds pass 
through their body, and fall with their droppings 
somewhere far ofP. 

Now you see why the blackberry and the rasp- 
berry grow juicy pulp round their seeds, and why 
the little hard seed-boxes of the strawberry stick 
in the juicy mound. All this is to tempt the birds 
to eat them and carry their seeds. 

So too in the hip of the wild rose, the green cup 
grows large and soft, and turns a bright red just 
when w^inter is coming, and there is not much food. 
Then the birds come and peck at the cup, and the 
seed-boxes inside stick to their beaks or are swal- 
lowed, and so are carried away. 

You know that in a hard winter the holly 
berries and mistletoe, the hips and haws, and even 
the berries of the yew and the honeysuckle, are 
often all gone before Christmas. But I daresay 
you did not know before that the birds were 
carrying about seeds to grow up next year. 

But if you keep your eyes open, you can learn 
a great many things like these, which children shut 





up in towns cannot see. You are happy to live in 
the beautiful country, among the birds and the 
flowers. You breathe the fresh air, which the 
plants make sweet, you gather your own flowers, 
and grow your own vegetables and fruit, and you 
can watch the plants in your garden growing 
prettier every year. 

Try to find the fruits of the wild geranium, yellow balsam, 
dandelion, groundsel, thistle, teasel, goose-grass, burdock, rose, 
hawthorn, honeysuckle, yew, and other plants. 



These lessons are intended to be read after the teacher 
has given one or more lectures on the subject. It is not 
necessary to read the book straight through. Different lessons 
are suited for different seasons, and in some cases one lesson 
may serve for a month's work ; the children being enconraeed 
to observe and ooUect. 


I WONDER how many birds you know by sight, and 
what you could tell about their nests and their 
lives ? 

There are between three and four hundred 
different British birds, and very few people know 
them all. But in any one place there are not more 
common birds than you could learn in a year. You 
can look for the rare ones afterwards. 

The best ^vay to begin is to write down those 
you are sure about, and say ho'w you recognise 
them. You cannot mistake a Rol)in, with his red 
breast, his plump little body, and his brown wings. 
The mother robin's breast is not quite so red, ano 
the young have no red at all. But when you have 
seen them with the cock-robin, you will soon know 
them by their shape. 

But a Chaffinch has a red breast. How can you 
tell him from a robin ? His breast is much browner 
than the robin's, and even at a distance you may 


know him by the white bands on his dark wings, 
and the yellow tips to some of his feathers. Then 
his body is longer, and he moves more gracefully 
than the robin, while his loud ^^ pink, pink" if you 
go near his nest, will tell you at once T\^hat he is. 

The Lark you know by his slender brown body 
and white speckled throat, and by the way he soars, 
as he sings his sweet song. The common green 
Woodpecker is easily known by his bright colours, 
his curious feet, and his stiff tail, which he uses to 
jerk himself up a tree. And though a Nuthatch 
also goes up a tree by jumps, you would never take 
him for a woodpecker, for he is no bigger than a 
sparrow, and he has a short tail and blue-grey 
wings with a dingy red breast. 

Then you know the cooing Wood-pigeon, the 
chattering Magpie, the soaring Hawk with his 
hooked beak, and the downy Owl. And I daresay 
you could tell me of many more. 

The birds you kno^v best will most of them be 
with us all the year round. But not all. The Swifts 
fly away to the south in August, and the Swallows 
and the Martins follow in October. When they are 
gone the Fieldfares come from the north, and feed in 
flocks on the worms in the damp fields, and on the 
holly berries when the ground is hard ^vith frost. 

The Swallow^ and the House Martin are so alike 
trhat, as they come and go together, you might not 
know them apart, unless you remember that a 
Swallow has a blue-black collar across his breast, 
and that the fork of his tail is longer than that of 
the Martin {see p. 45). You may be busy all the 





year round watching the birds, seeing when they 
come and go, what food they eat, how they fly. 
whether they sing in the morning or evening, and 
where they build their nests. 

Many farmers and gardeners shoot little birds 
because they eat their corn and peas and fruit. But 
a large number of birds feed chiefly on insects. You 
ought to know which these are, for they are very 
useful in clearing away earwigs and caterpillars, as 
well as slugs and snails. If you look out early 
some morning and see a Thrush tapj)ing a snail- 
shell against a stone to get at the snail, you will 
say he is a good gardener. You will not grudge 
him a little fruit in the summer. 

Then there are the nests and the young birds to 
Tvatch. You need not take the nests, nor rob the 
birds of their eggs. You will learn much more 
by pulling back the leaves and the twigs, and 
peeping gently into the nest. For then you can 
come another day and watch when the eggs hatch, 
and how the young birds grow. If you are careful 
not to disturb the bush nor touch the eggs, the 
mother will not desert them. Last year a pair of 
Thrushes built their nest in a hedge by the side of 
a path where people were always passing. But 
though I w^ent often to look at it, the mothei 
brought up all her four little ones. She would 
even sit still on the nest Tvhen I peeped in, while 
her mate sang on a tree close by. 

Point out and describe six birds common in the neighbour- 
hood. 


Birds sing when they are happy, and cry out ^when 
they are frightened, just as children do. Only 
they have songs and cries of their own. You can 
always tell ^when the little song-birds are happy, 
for each one trills out his joyous notes as he sits 
3n a branch of a tree, or the top of a hedge. 

In the early mornings of the spring, you wdll 
hear singing in the garden almost before it is light. 
First there is a little chirping and twittering, as 
if the birds were saying " good-morning " and pre- 
paring their throats. Then, as the sun rises, there 
conies a burst of song. 

Robins, Thrushes, Blackbirds, Chaffinches, and 
Wrens whistle away merrily, and many other little 
birds join in. While they are all singing together, 
it is not easy to tell one song from another, though 
the Thrush sings loudest and clearest of all. 

Then they fly away to their breakfast and, as 
the day goes on, you hear one or two at a time. 
So you can listen to the notes of each song, and 
if you go near very quietly, you can see the throat 
of the bird swelling and quivering as he works the 
little voice-chords inside, w^hich make the notes. 

It is not easy to write down what a bird sings, 
for it is like whistling — there are no words in it. 
But people often try to imitate their songs in 
words. Listen to the Thrush. You can fancy he 
says "cherry-tree, cherry-tree, cherry-tree" three 
times. Then, after some other notes, he sings 




"harry-up, hurry -up," and "go-it, go-it." For the 
thrush has a great many notes. 

The pretty Yellowhanimer, with its brignt yellow 
head, sings "a little bit of bread, and no ehe-e-s-e." 
The Chiff-chaff calls "chiff-chaff, chiff-chaff" quite 
distinctly. Any child can imitate the cuckoo, or the 
coo-oo-oo of the wood-pigeon. 

As the days grow hotter, the birds sing less. 
They sit on the branches of the trees, or on the 
hedges under the shade of the leaves, or hop about 
in the wood. 

Then when the evening comes, and long shadows 
creep over the grass, each bird looks out for his 
supper. When he is satisfied he sings his evening 
song of content, before he goes to sleep. 

What a concert it is! Finches, tomtits, sparrows, 
wrens, robins, and chaffinches all singing at once. 
And above them all, come the song of the thrushes 
and blackbirds, the cooing of the wood-pigeon 
and the caw-caw of the rooks as they fly home 
from the fields. As the thrushes were the first to 
begin in the morning, except the lark, so they are 
the last to leave off at night, and often one thrush 
will go on long after all the others are quiet. 

Then at last all seem to have settled down for 
the night. But no ! If you live in Kent, or any 
part of the south or east of England, you may hear 
in May or June a sweet sound, like a flute, coming 
softly from many parts of the wood. This comes 
from the Nightingales, who, in the warm summer, 
will sing nearly all night. 

They sing in the day as well, but their note is 


so soft that often you cannot hear it when the 
more noisy birds are singing. In the still night you 
ean hear the sweet song rising up six notes and 
then bubbling like a flute played in water. When 
you have once heard a nightingale sing you will 
never forget it. In Yorkshiie or Devonshire you 
will not hear him, for he does not go so far to 
the North or to the West. 

Birds sing most in the spring, for then they are 
making their nests, and the father bird sings to the 
mother while she is building, and when she is 
sitting on the eggs. You may often find out 
where a Robin's nest is hidden by seeing the cock- 
robin sitting on a branch singing to his mate. 
Most people too, have seen the Wood-pigeon 
puffing out his throat and cooing and bowing to 
the mother bird on her nest. For pigeons make 
love all the year round. 

When the mother bird is sitting, the father sings 
for joy, and when the young birds are hatched he 
teaches them his song. Song-birds have very deli- 
cate throats. They have muscles, which quiver like 
the strings of a violin, and the young birds have 
to learn to work these muscles. 

It is curious to hear a young Blackbird or 
Thrush beginning to try a tune. First he sounds 
one note, then two or three. They are not always 
In tune, but he tries again and again. So little by 
little he learns his father's song. 

Listen to the song of birds— robins, thrushes, blackbirds, 
larks, nightingales, bullfinches and others, and try to imitate 
them by whistling. 



If you want to know how cleverly nests are made, 
you should collect a few which the birds have 
deserted, or from which the young birds have 
flown. 

You will find a Hedge-sparrow's nest in many 
a hawthorn bush, and though it is a simple nest, 
I think you will find, if you pull it to pieces, that 
you cannot put it together again as well as the 
bird did. 

A Chaffinch s neat is more fiuely woven. You 
will most likely find one in the apple trees in the 
orchard. It is made of dry grass and moss matted 
together with wool in the shape of a deep cup, and 
lined with hair and feathers. Outside, the bird will 
most likely have stuck pieces of grey or white 
lichen. Lichen is the papery-looking plant which 
grows on apple trees, and which children call grey 
moss. The pieces woven in help to hide the nest in 
an apple tree. When the Chaffinch builds in a 
green hedge she often uses green moss instead. 

Now try to find a Thrush's nest. It may be in a 
laurel-bush or a fir-tree. It is large and quite firm, 
not soft like the hedge-sparrow's nest. For the 
thrush plasters the inside with mud, or cow-dung, 
or rotten wood, till it is almost as hard as the 
inside of a cocoa-nut shell. 

When you have looked at these nests, you will 
want to see one built next spring. But this is not 
so easy. For birds try to hide the cradles of their 



little ones, and do not like to work when anyone is 
near. 

Rooks are the easiest to watch, for they build in 
high trees, and therefore are not shy. You may see 
them flying along ^th pieces of stick in their 
mouths, and bringing mud and clay to plaster them 
together. Sometimes you may see the old rooks 
staying behind in the rookery, to steal the sticks 
from the nests of the young rooks while they 
are away, instead of fetching them for themselves. 

Birds do not all make the same shaped nests. 
The Lark makes her nest of grass in a rut or a 
furrow of the field. The green Plover or Peewit, 
whose cry you know so well, "pee-Tveet, pee-weet," 
lays a few bits of grass, or rush, in a marsh or in 
a rough field. Her little ones run about as soon 
as they come out of the egg. 

The Swallows build their nests of mud and straw 
on the rafters of barns, or under the ledges of 
chinmeys, in the shajie of a shallow basin, and line 
them with feathers. But the Martins build under 
the eaves. They make their nests of clay stuck 
against the wall like a bag, with only a small hole 
at tJie top. It is very funny to see the tail of a 
martin sticking out, when she puts her head into 
her nest to feed the young ones. 

The Woodpecker makes a hole in a tree for her 
nest, and lines it with chips of wood. The Nuthatch 
looks out for a hole in a branch, and lines it with 
flakes of bark and dry loaves. Then, if it is too big, 
she fills up the opening with clay all except one 
little hole 




Rooks and Pigeons build coarse nests. Th€ 
rooks build theirs of sticks and turf lined with 

grass and moss. The pigeon 
leaves hers so loose that the 
eggs almost slip through. 

Then the Httle 
singing birds, the 
Warblers, the 
Thrushes, the Nightin- 
gales, and the Robins 
build lovely cup-nests. 
Reed - warblers weave 
their nest round two 
or three reeds, or other 
plants, near the ^vater. 
It is made of blades of 
grass and lined with 
water-weed. The Wren, 
the long-tailed Tit- 
mouse, and the Chiff- 
chaff, build nests in the shape 
of a ball, with a hole in one 
side. The chiff-chaff lines 
hers with a beautifully soft 
layer of feathers. 

Wrens build in all sorts 
of strange places, in walls 
and trees, in holes of rocks, 
on the tops of hedges and on the banks of rivers. 
If you look about near the nest in which the wren 
lias laid her eggs you will often find one or two 
other nests built exactly like it, but not lined with 


feathers. They are called "cock's nests.' We do 
not know why the birds build them. Perhaps one 
day you may find out if you watch. The chiff- 
chaff hides her nests in the hedges or banks, and 
the long-tailed titmouse loves to build in the gorse 
bushes. 

Once two Wrens were watched building their 
nest in a juniper tree. They began at seven o'clock 
in the morning. The mother wren brought some 
leaves from a lime-tree. She put one leaf in a fork 
of the tree, and laid the others round it. Then she 
went back for more. So she went on all day, bring- 
ing in leaves, and matting them together with moss, 
and all the while the cock-wren sang to her from 
the top of the tree. 

By seven o'clock in the evening she had made the 
outside of the nest, in the shape of a ball with a 
hole in one side. 

Next day the two birds began work together at 
half-past three in the morning. They worked for 
eight days, carrying in moss and feathers. When 
they had done, the nest was a firm little ball, lined 
with a thick layer of soft feathers, for the wee 
wrens to lie in, when they were hatched. 

Then the mother wren laid five small white eggs 
with a few red spots upon them, and sat for a whole 
fortnight, while her mate sang to her, and brought 
her insects to eat. 

Examine nests. Mxid-huilt — swallow, martin. Roughly 
woven — honse-spaiTow. Cup-nests — hedge-sparrow, chaffinch. 
Woven and mud-lined — thrush. 


When you have looked at several birds' nests, you 
will want to see what the eggs are like. Try first to 
find those which are near your home. Some are 
so well hidden, that you will have to watch T^^here 
the old birds go in and out, before you can find 
them. Others, like the nests of rooks, magj)ies and 
jays, are easy to see, but not easy to reach. 

Do not take the eggs. Each ^dll hatch out into 
a happy little bird, and if you carried the egg home 
it would only be broken. Your teacher will very 
likely collect one of each kind, which will do to 
show the class for many years. 

But look Tvell at the eggs in the nest. Then you 
will know them again when you find them in 
another place. Count how^ many there are, and 
notice if any more are laid afterwards. Then 
reckon how long the eggs are being hatched, after 
the last one is laid. You vnU. find it is about a 
fortnight for the small birds and a day or two 
longer for rooks and pigeons. Then you can 
watch the feeding of the young birds, which we 
shall talk about in the next two lessons. 

It is better not even to touch the eggs ; for some 
birds, like the wood-pigeon, will desert their nests 
if the eggs have been handled. Other birds are not 
so particular. Mr. Kearton tells us that when he 
vvas a boy he used to find plovers' nests and amuse 
himself by turning the large end of the egg into the 
middle of the nest. As soon as the tidy mother 



came oack, she always turned them round again 
with the points in the middle. The baby bird 
always comes out at the large end, so this gives 
them more room, as they hatch out. 

If you have a laurel hedge in the garden jca 
may find a Thrush's nest in it, with four to six 
beautiful blue eggs, about an inch long and spotted 
with black at the large end (see picture, p. 10). The 
mother will scold you well, and perhaps will not 
leave the nest, and you will have to take your 
chance ^vhen she is away. You may find a Black- 
bird's nest not far off. You will know it from 
the thrush's nest because it is lined with fine 
roots and grass, so is not hard inside. The eggs 
are greener with red-brown spots. The Missel 
thrush generally builds in a tree, and her eggs are 
a light buff colour spotted with reddish brown and 
pale lilac. 

The Chaffinch will build close to your house, 
or in the apple trees of the orchard ; and a pair 
of Bullfinches may make their nest in the ivy of 
the old garden wall, though they are shy birds. 
The chaffinch's eggs are a pale brown-green colour 
with brown spots (see picture, p. 20). They are 
about one-third the size of the thrush's egg. The 
bullfinch's are a pale blue, spotted with bro^^ni or 
purple. Be careful when you look at the bull- 
finch's nest, for though the mother will sit still, 
the father will be angry, and he may make her 
desert her nest, if he sees you. 

You will have to get a ladder if you want to see 
a Martin's nest, for they build under the eaves of 




fche house. And when you pull away a little of the 
nest and look in, make sure that you see the right 
sggs, for a sparrow will often take a martin's nest 
and lay her eggs in it. You can find out, by 
watching which bird goes into the nest. But if 
you cannot do this, you may know by the colour 
of the eggs. A martin's e^g is white without any 
spots upon it, A sparrow's egg is grey with brown 
blotches on it. When the sparrow builds her own 
nest, it is made of straw or hay lined with feathers. 
It has about live or six eggs in it. 

It is easier to look into a Swallow's nest than 
into a martin's, for it is not covered at the top, 
and is often put upon a rafter in a barn. It will 
have about five white eggs in it, with dark red 
patches on them. Watch these nests carefully, for 
when the eggs are hatched it is very pretty to 
see the old swallows teaching the young ones to 
catch flies {see picture, p. 45). 

We must not forget the Robins, though I expect 
you know their eggs well. They are white, spotted 
?with light red, and you may easily find them, for in 
the spring there is a robin's nest in almost every 
bank or hedgerow. 

You may look for a Tomtit's nest in all sorts of 
strange places, from a hole in a tree, to a flower-pot 
which has been thrown away. There will be s 
number of little white eggs in it speckled with 
red. The mother will hiss and peck at you to 
prevent you from taking them away. But in a 
few days she will not be afraid, for she is a bold 
little bird. 


You must learn to look for other eggs your- 
selves. In the barn you may find the Owl's large 
white eggs, and sometimes young birds and eggs 
together. In a bank of a river, or a hole in a 
wall, you may find the nest of a Water-wagtail 
with greyish white spotted eggs. The Rook's bluish 
green eggs sometimes fall down from their nests; 
and the Jackdaws will build in your chimneys. 

When you have spent some time hunting for 
nests and eggs, you will notice how cunningly they 
are hidden by their colour and their marks. 

Wherever you find white eggs like those of the 
owl, the martin, the woodpecker, the kingfisher, and 
the pigeon, they are either quite hidden in a bank, 
a tree trunk, or a deep nest, or they are high up 
out of reach. Most other eggs are spotted, and 
they are either some shade of green or grey or 
brown, like the moss and leaves and twigs of the 
nest. 

In any nest yon can find, see how many of the eggs grow 
up into yoiing birds, (-hoose one nest each, to watch and see 
ivhich child can count vip most young birds. 



The mother bird sits on the nest and keeps the 
eggs Aivarni all the time that the little birds are 
growing inside. She never leaves them except to 
stretch herself and get food. Sometimes the father 
bird sits while she is away, or he brings food to 
her. Sometimes he only sings to her. 

The first thing that the baby-birds do for them- 
selves is to get out of the egg. When they are 
ready you may hear them crying " cheep, cheep " 
inside. Then they tap away at the big end with 
a little horny tip, which grows on the top of theii 
beak, and the shell cracks, and out they come. 

If you can catch a chicken as soon as it is out 
of the egg, you may see this horny tip. But you 
must be quick, for a chicken is a very active baby- 
bird. It runs about directly it is hatched, and the 
horny tip falls off. 

The next thing young birds do is to open 
their beaks and cry for food. Some, like the 
chickens, ducks, and partridges come out with 
downy feathers all over them. These run about 
and get food for themselves. Their mother takes 
care of them, and they cuddle under her wing when 
she calls to them. 

Others, like the pigeon, the sparrow, and the 
thrush, are naked, blind, and helpless when thejf 
are hatched. They cannot get out of the nest, and 
their parents have to feed them. 

 



If you keep doves in a cage, or it you can climb 
up to the pigeon-boxes where the pigeons have 
their nests, you may learn a good deal by watching 
a baby pigeon. 

The day it conies out of the e^^ its eyelids are 
tightly closed. It has only a few downy tufts on 
its naked body, so you can see its fleshy wing and 
feel the bones. Handle it carefully and notice that 






its wing has three joints, just like your arm. 
One at the shoulder (s) close to the body, one at 
the elboiv (e), and one at the wrist (w). 

As it lies in the nest, it draws its elbow back 
and touches its shoulder with its hand. Then the 
wing is shut. But if you take hold of the hand {h] 
gently, and pull the arm out straight, then the 
wing is open. This is just what a bird does when 
he stretches his wings to fly. 

Now watch the little ones day by day. By 
degrees pimples come out all over the body. Then 
the middle of each pimple sinks in and some 


The first feathers are quite 
limp. The little 
featherlets grow 
all round the steir 
like hairs on a cat's 
tail. These are the 
down feathers. 
There are not many 
on a young pigeon. 
The next feathei^ 
are quite difPerent 
They are flat and 
much stiffer. The 
featherlets only 
grow on each side 
of the stem. They 
are tinted, and you 
- can see now 

whether the pigeon 
is going to be w^hite or 
coloured. 

It is these "covering^ 
feathers which are so 
beautiful in most birda 
They do not grow all over 
the body. If you push 
back the feathers of a 
dead bird you w ill see that 
they grow^ in places only, 
and spread themselves 
over the rest. 



Meanwhile the long tail and wing feathers have 





been growing. Those for the tip of the wing grow 
on the hand, those for the edge of the wing on the 
arm, between the wrist and the elbow, and above 
these, like tiles on a roof, gro^v the small feathers 

right up to the 
s shoulder, making 

the wing round 
and firm. 

Feel one of 
the long wing 
feathers. It has 
a strong quill 
down the middle, 
which tapers 
away at the end 
so that the 
feather will bend, 
No"w try to pull 
the featherlets apart. You will find that 
they stick together, as if they were glued. 
This is because there are tiny hooks all along each 
little branch, by which it is hooked on to the next 
one. So when the wings beat the air, it cannot 
pass through them, especially as the small side of 
each feather lies over the broad side of the next 
one. 

By this time the young pigeons will have opened 
their eyes. But though they can stand up, they are 
very weak, and take all their food from their 
mother. 

Then about a month after coming out of the 
egg, t}iey go to the edge of the pigeon-house and 




watch the other pigeons. From time to time they 
stretch out their wings, and flap them a Httle. As 
they flap them downwards, the air under the front 
of the wing cannot get away there, and is driven 
out behind just as water is driven by an oar when 
we row. But as they Kft the wing up again the 
feathers turn so that the air can pass through. 
Therefore, as they flap their wings they raise them- 
selves a Httle, and flutter to the next ledge, and at 
last they fly to the ground and begin to jDick up 
food with their parents. 

Compare a yoving pigeon and a young chicken. Examine 
the down feathers, covering feathers, and long quill feathers. 


You will find it very interesting to peep into nests 
and see "which birds are naked and which are 
downy, -which can see, and which are blind. 

By the river the little Water-hens come out of 
the egg as black fluffy balls with red heads, and 
swim away at once after their mother. But King- 
fishers come out of the egg naked and helpless. 
They have to wait till their feathers have grown, 
before they can leave the nest, and meanwhile theii 
mother feeds them with fish. 

Then if you see a young Owl in its nest in a barn, 
or pick up a young Hawk which has fallen out of 





a tree, you will find that they are quite blind and 
helpless, though they are covered with down. Their 
mothers have to bring them insects, mice, and 
young rabbits till they are full-grown. 

Those of you who live by the seaside know quite 
well the Gulls which fly out to sea and float on the 
waves. In the spring and early summer you may 
hear the young gulls, called Sea-mews or Kitti- 
wakes, mewing like kittens on the ledges of the 
cliffs. They are calling to their parents to feed 
them {see picture, p. 71). 

For though these young gulls can see and are 
covered with down, they are born so high up on 
the cliffs that they must sit and wait till they are 
strong. Even then they can only creep along the 
ledges till their wings are full-grown. They sit 
there with open beaks, crying to be fed, and the 
old sea-birds bring fish for them to eat. The com- 
mon gulls and the herring gulls generally lay 
their eggs on islands, and the little ones swim about 
when they are only a few days old. 

Or, if you live far away from the sea in the 
depths of the country, you will enjoy seeing the 
other kinds of birds feeding their young ones in 
the trees and in the hedges. Sometimes the mother 
does all the work, and sometimes the father takes 
his share. 

Mr. Kearton, who knows so much about birds, 
tells us that he once helped in the feeding. One 
day he watched a mother Chiff-chaff bringing food 
to her five little ones in a nest under a thorn- 
bush. Chiff-chaffs are verv small, graceful birds. 



Their back and wings are a kind of dull olive green 
colour, and their breast a yellowish white. The 
mother was bringing in caterpillars and flies, about 
four or five every five minutes, and she popped 
them into the little beaks stretched to reach them. 
As she worked, her mate flew first to one bough, 
then to another singing " chiff-chafp, chiff-chaff," 

Mr. Kearton thought he ^vould help the little 
mother. He collected some green caterpillars, and 
put them on the edge of the nest while she was 
away. Then he knelt do^Ti a little way off. 

The mother flew to and fro at her work and 
looked at him as she passed, but he did not move. 
At last she picked up the insects he had brought 
and divided them among the little mouths. Then 
she flew away for more. 

That little mother worked all day long, only 
resting for half an hour in the afternoon. She not 
only brought food, but also cleaned the nest be- 
tween each journey, j^icking out the pellets of 
dung, and making everything clean and neat. I 
think she must have been very glad of the little 
heaps of insects which her friend put near her 
nest from time to time. 

Tomtits are such bold little birds that you may 
often see them going in and out of a hole in some 
wall, or a tree stumj), with insects in their mouths. 
The father and mother Tit both help in feeding 
(see p. 36). They go out and come back together, 
laden with caterpillars, and after giving them to 
the young ones they start off again, calling to 
each other as they go. 



We had some young Robins once which were fed 
by three birds. They were born in the hedge of 
our garden. We called the third bird the uncle. 
He worked quite as hard as the other two. By-and- 
bye the old robins flew away. But the young ones 
stayed with us all the summer and used to hop 
about the dinner table and pick up the crumbs. 

Blackbirds feed their baby-birds with large 
worms, which they pull to pieces, giving a bit to 
each. The jay looks as if she brought nothing, 
but she pours the food from her crop into the 
mouth of the little one. The mother pigeon throw^s 
the food up from her crop into her mouth, and the 
little ]3igeon puts its beak in at the side of its 
mother's beak and sucks out the food. 

Most parent birds go on feeding the little ones 
for some time after they can fly. You may often 
see little sparrows or thrushes sitting in a row on 
ii bough while the mother j)ops the food into their 
beaks. She begins at one end and goes quite fairly 
from one to another, each in its turn. 

Watch for birds feeding young in the spring. Thrushes, 
sparrows, robins, tomtits. 1. In the nest. 2. Sitting oi\ 
branches. 3. Small birds feeding a young cuckoo. 4. Young 
pigeon taking food from the mother. 



Where are all the birds at night ? In the daytime 
we see them in the fields, on the trees and hedges. 
or on the cliffs. They feed in the garden, the 
orchard, and the Avood. But in the evening, when 
the sun sets, we hear them singing as if they 
were saying "gocJ-night," and then they disappear 
Only the night birds are about after sunset. Owls 
hoot and fly after dark, nightingales sing all night 
in warm summer weather, and if there are any 
corn-crakes about, you will hear their tiresome 
cry, " craake, craake," long after you want to go to 
sleep. 

But the other birds are nowhere to be seen. 
Where are they ? It is not easy to find them, 
for they hide themselves, from fear of the owls, 
the weasels and the stoats, and they wake and 
flutter away very soon if you come near them. 

The small birds sleep chiefly in the hedges. 
You will be surprised how difficult it is to see 
them, even in winter when the leaves are off the 
trees ; for the twigs and branches crossing each 
other hide them well. No owl or hawk could 
seize a bird in a hawthorn hedge. 

But how do they keep themselves upon the 
twigs when they are fast asleep ? If you or I 
tried to sleep standing up we should fall. For our 
muscles would grow slack, our heads would nod, 
and our knees would give way under us. 


It is different with a bird. He sits on a branch, 
and grasps it with his claws. Then he squats down 
ind bends his legs. As he does this, a muscle round 
his knee-joints pulls the muscles of his toes quite 
tight, so that his claws are kept clasped round 
the branch. He cannot move till he has raised 
himself up and straightened his legs, and thus set 
his claws free. So the more soundly he sleeps the 
tighter he grasps the bough, and the less likely he 
is to fall. 

Birds sleep out of doors both summer and 
winter, and they have a curious covering to keep 
them warm. It is made of air. When a bird 
goes to roost, he tucks his head under the plumage 
of his shoulder, and puffs out his feathers, so that 
the air gets in between them, and settles all among 
the soft down which grows close to his body. This 
air soon becomes warm, and, as it cannot get out, it 
prevents the bird's warm body from being chilled 
by the cold air outside. 

Still, in bad weather birds often like to find 
warm nooks to sleep in. House-sparrows, tits, 
wrens, and other small birds sometimes make 
holes in hay-stacks for their beds. The owls keep 
themselves warm in barns, church towers, and 
sometimes in holes in the trunks of trees. The 
blue-tit loves to sleep under a thatched roof, and 
Wrens often hunt up old nests in winter, and 
huddle together in them to keep themselves 
warm. 

Swallows and swifts do not want to be kept 
warm, for they fly south in cold weather. In 




summer they perch on the rafters in the barns, 
and if you go into a barn after dark, you may 
often hear them flitting from one rafter to another 
if they are disturbed. 

Wood-pigeons roost on the fir-trees in the wood, 
and hawks on the branches of the taller trees. 
Pheasants, too, roost in the trees of the wood, 
and it is curious that they always tell you where 
they go to bed. For they call " crok, crok," as they 
settle down to sleep. 

But partridges sleep on the ground in the fields. 
They lie in a circle with their heads outwards and 
their tails together. The father generally sleeps 
a little way off as a sentinel. Then if a fox, or 
a weasel, tries to catch them in their sleep, any 
one that is awake and sees the enemy can give 
the alarm to the rest. 

All these birds sleep inland in the woods and 
fields. But if you can go to the sea-shore some 
summer evening and lie on the beach under the 
high cliffs, you may see other birds coming home 
to roost. Just as the sun is setting many little 
birds from the fields perch in the bushes at the 
top of the rocks. Next come any jackdaws, a\ Inch 
happen to live near the sea, cackling and chasing 
each other over the cliffs. They creep into holes 
to sleep. Then a few big cormorants sail in from 
the sea, followed by the gulls, and settle on the 
ledges half-way down the face of the cliff. Some 
croaking ravens come flying from the land, and 
twist and tumble about, before they too sit down 
for the night. The sand-martins disappear into 





their holes in the sandstone-rocks, and perhaps a 
falcon will come circling round in the air and swoop 
down in some quiet nook. 



Then after a time the cackling and the croaking 
cease and as the moon rises all is quiet. But if you 
look on the silvery water you will see that many of 
the gulls are still floating on the waves, and they 
may remain there all the night. 

Watch the birds going to roost at night, and notice their 
special haunts. 





Spring and summer are happy times for birds. 
Then there is plenty of food for them and their 
httle ones. Let us go out some fine sunnner morn- 
ing, and watch the different birds as they feed. You 
will not see them all in one day. But you ought to 
find each one some time during the summer. 

Close to the house you are sure to see a House 
Sparrow picking up scraps in the yard and eating 
the caterpillars and red spiders on the gooseberry 
bushes in the kitchen garden. For the sparrow^ i? 
not dainty. He will eat most things, from a grain 
of wheat to a scrap of meat. 

In the kitchen garden, too, you may see the 
Chaffinch breaking the husks of seeds with his sharp 
little beak. He is not j^articular whether he takes 
them from the weeds, or from the beds of radishes 
or turnips which we have sown. But he does us 
more good than harm, for he destroys a great deal 
of groundsel and chickweed. 

Out in the fields the little brown Lark, which has 
been singing in the sky, drops down to hunt for 
seeds in the furrows turned up by the plough. In 
the rickyard I can see several little Finches, the 
greenfinch and the yellowhammer, picking up the 
grains of corn. 

All these birds feed usually on grain, .•uid liave 
short sharp beaks which will split tiie husks, 






though they sometimes eat insects and feed their 
young ones on them. We have to drive them 
away from our wheat and oats for a few weeks 
in the year, but they are very useful in keeping 
down the weeds, for they eat every seed they can 
find. 

The Swallows, Swifts, and Martins have very 


 

different beaks. If you watch them as they skim 
along in the air, you will see they can open their 
mouths very wide to catch the flies and gnats. But 
fche hard beak itself is very small. They have weak 
legs and strong wings, for they catch all their food 
as they fly. Notice how near the ground they keep 
in dull weather. Then the insects are flying low, 
and the swallows follow them. But on a bright day 



the gnats and midges fly higher, so swallows fly- 
higher too. 

That big Thrush which is hopping about on the 



grass is very different from the swallows. He has 
strong feet and legs, and a long, narrow, round beak. 
He feeds on worms and snails in the summer, and 
on berries in the autumn. Look at him now. He 
has his feet firmly planted on the grass, and he is 



pulling away at a worm with all his might. He will 
get it out of the ground soon, and carry it away to 
feed his little ones. 

Many of the smaller perching birds feed only on 
insects. I am sure you ^11 love them. They are 
such pretty little things. First, there is the Wag- 
tail with his black and white wings, and his long 
tail bobbing up and down as he hunts for insects 
in the grass. Not far off is a little Wren hopping 
on a rose-tree and picking off the green-fly, which 
does so much harm. 

On a bush near, sits a small brown bird with 
a grey speckled breast. He only came back to 
England from warm countries at the end of May. 
He is the common spotted Fly-catcher. Look how^ 
still he sits. Then all at once he darts into the air 
with wide open mouth, snaps his beak, and goes 
back to his place. He has cavight a fly and will 
now^ sit and w^ait for another. 

Next I want you to look at a little bird which I 
love because he is so bright and gay. He is a Blue 
Tit or Tomtit {see picture, p. 36), a small bird with 
a bright blue head and wings, and a yellow breast. 
He is hanging upside down on the branch of a tree 
watching for spiders. When he has caught one he 
will flutter off to another tree and get a good 
breakfast in a very little while. He is a very bold 
little bird, and in the winter you may learn to 
know him well, if you will give him some food. 

These birds, the thrush, the wagtail, the fly- 
catcher, the wren and the tomtit are very useful to 
UAx They kill the snails and slugs, the caterpillars, 



maggots, and grubs. So do the nightingale and the 
blackbird, and another little bird, which I want you 
to knoT^^ This is the Hedge-sparrow, a small brown 
bird with a blue-grey breast, which flutters along 
the lanes. I am sure you must have seen him. He 
picks up a tiny insect, flits a little way and picks up 
another, and then flits away again jvist in front 
of you as you walk along the lane. You must not 
confuse him with the house-sparrow. He is quite 
another kind of bird, he is one of the warblers and 
sings very sweetly. He is sometimes called the 
"hedge-warbler," and this is a much better and 
truer name for him. 

We have not much time to watch other birds. 
But w^e must look at the rooks hunting for worms 
and slugs in the ploughed fields ; and as we come 
near the wood I see a partridge feeding on ants 
under the trees. He flies away with a loud whirr 
long before "w^e get near him, and as he cries " cluck, 
cluck" I expect the mother bird and her nest are 
not far off. 

If you go into the wood you may see the little 
Tree-creejier running up the trees looking for 
insects, and the woodpecker darting out his sticky 
tongue and tapping at the trunks of the trees, and 
the wood-pigeon flying home with her crop full of 
oats or peas to feed her little ones. 

Or if you stroll by the river there may be the 
tiny kingfisher darting down to seize tiny fish ; or 
the grave heron sitting quite still, with his neck 
stretched out, till in a moment his head shoots 
forward, and he brings up a big eel in his beak. 





You can notice many of these things for your- 
selves. The great secret is to look at every bird 
you see and try to learn something about it. 

Notice the hard beaks of birds which eat seeds— ChaflQnch. 
The hooked beaks of birds which eat flesh— Hawk. The wide 
gape of birds which catch insects on the wing — Swallow. The 
long, slender beaks of birds which feel underground for food — 
Woodcock. 



When the summer is over, there is not so much 
food for the birds, and some begin to go away. 
Those which live on flying insects go first. The 
cuckoo is generally gone by the end of July. The 
swifts start off in August, and about the middle 
of September the swallows begin to find very 
few flies, gnats, or moths, and get ready for their 
long journey. 

If you keep a sharp look-out you may see the 
Swallows and Martins collecting, about the 15th of 
September, on some church tower, or perhaps on 
the roof of a barn, and flying off together to roost 
in the trees. This they never do in the summer 
Then they sleep on the rafters of some barn, or 
under the eaves of a roof, always keeping near 
buildings. But before they fly away for the winter 
they gather together in the trees, or on the willows 
in the osier beds. 

Then ggjjie morning yery early they all dis- 





appear. They have started to fly steadily in large 
flocks, for hundreds of miles, to Africa, where they 
will have Avarni weather, and insects to eat, all the 
winter. You will not see them again till next April. 





The little Fly-catchers and the Nightingales go 
away about the same time as the swallows, and the 
Chiff-chafP goes in October. Some of the Wagtails 
and Robins go too, but not nearly all. 




A great many birds shift from place to place in 
England during the autumn, for food begins to be 
scarce, and they wander in search of it. Many 
thrushes and redwings come to us from Norway 
and Germany, and robins, finches, and other birds 
come from the north of England to the south, 
They leave the cold moors and mountains of Cum- 
berland and Yorkshire to feed in Hampshire and 
Devonshire, where they can find more berries, such 
as hips and haws, holly-berries, juniper-berries, 
sloes, and the red berries of the mountain ash. So 
if you live in the south of England, you may see 
more robins, thrushes, chafiinches, and yellow- 
hammers in the winter than you did in the 
summer. 

You will find it very interesting to watch for the 
different birds, and see when they come and go, and 
whether you see many or few of any one kind. 

You will notice that in winter the little birds 
move about in flocks, instead of alone, or in pairs, 
as they do in the summer, ^len they have their 
nests and families. In November you will see a 
great many larks together. The cock-chaffinches 
sometimes fly in one flock, and the hen-chaffinches 
in another. The Finches, too, fly in parties ; yellow- 
hammers, greenfinches, and goldfinches all together. 
They hunt about for seeds, and sleep on the ground, 
or in the ivy bushes. But the Bullfinches, with their 
lovely blue-black wings and bright red breasts, keep 
together in small flocks, flying in a line one after 
the other along the hedges. 

These flocks of different birds flit about from 



one field to another, keeping together, and scatter- 
ing over one place at a time, looking for food. 

When many of our summer birds have gone 
to the sunny south, other birds come to us from 
still colder countries. The Fieldfares fly over from 
Norway and Sweden. You may see them, in parties 
of about forty or fifty, wheeling round in the air, and 
settling down on a field to look for grubs and seeds. 
They are pretty grey birds with brown-red wings 
and buff speckled breasts. But you cannot often 
get near enough to see them, for they are very shy. 
If they hear a noise they are off in a moment, and 
over the hedge into the next field, where they drop 
down again to feed. They sleep on the ground ; 
and go back to Norway to build their nests in the 
spring. 

A great many Starlings come from Norway and 
Germany in the ^nter, and join those which live 
with us always. They often fiy about with the 
rooks, but sometimes in flocks by themselves peck- 
ing in the fields and chattering one to another. 

So when the song-birds are silent in the wintei*, 
you can look out for all these other birds and find 
out where they feed and sleep ; when you first see 
them come, and when you see the last one go. But 
the thrush and the robin will sing all the year 
through, when the weather is mild. 

Make a list of summer birds which yoxi do not see in the 
winter. Make a list of winter birds which go away in the 
spring. Make another list of birds you see all the year roimd. 


When Christinas is past and the real winter cold 
begins, the poor little birds often have a hard time. 
So long as the weather is mild, the thrush picks out 
the slugs and snails from their hiding-places in the 
walls and palings. The robin and the wren bustle 
about, looking for seeds and insects. The little wag- 
tails run about the lawns wagging their tails, as 
they try to find a stray grub or beetle. In the 
wood the tree-creeper hunts for spiders and the 
eggs of insects in the bark of the trees, and the 
nut-hatches and pigeons feed under the beeches. 

But after a while, when a hard frost comes, 
and snow lies deep on the ground, the birds look 
very sad. The larks and the linnets crouch down 
under the banks of the cornfields to keep warm. 
The thrushes fly from tree to tree to look for a 
few mistletoe berries, now that all the others are 
eaten. The chaffinches and the yellow-hammers 
fly round the farmers ricks, to pull out some 
grains of wheat or oats, or grass seeds. The field- 
fares wander sadly about in flocks. The rooks, 
starlings, and jackdaws fly from field to field 
screaming and cawing as they try to find some 
place where the wind has blown the snow away and 
they can peck in the furrows. The lapwings, which 
you may know b}^ the feathers, which stand up on 
the back of their head, cry " peewit, peewit " mourn- 
fully, as they journey to the sea-coast, where they 
find food on the sands and mudflats at low tide. 




It IS sad to think how often little birds are 
starved to death. They do not so much mind the 




cold, for you remember that the air under their 
teathers keeps them warm. But in a hard winter 
they often die from want of food. If you pick up a 
dead robin, starling, or rook after a long frost, you 





will find that the bones are only covered with skin 
and feathers. Its flesh has all wasted away. 

Now is your time to be kind to the birds which 
have sung to you all the summer. They did good 
work then, eating the caterpillars and grubs, the 
tvire-worms and maggots, the slugs and snails, and 
keeping down the weeds by eating the seeds. Now^ 
you can feed them, for a little while, till the frost 
and snow^ are gone. 

You will learn to know a great many birds in 
this way, and you need only give them a few scraps, 
which you can well spare. Some birds, you will 
remember, like seeds and crumbs and green food, 
Others, which eat insects in the summer, will be 
glad of a little gristle or fat. 

So you must save up every scrap from break- 
fast, dinner, and supper, and keep it for the next 
morning — crusts of bread, the crumbs off the 
table, cold potatoes, and potato skins. You can 
get your mother to boil the potatoes in their 
skins, and then the birds will like the peel. 
Perhaps, too, you may save some pieces of 
cabbage, some apple parings, and a little fat. 

All this will make a nice dish for starving birds, 
if you chop it up and pour a little hot w^ater over 
the crusts. And if you live on a farm you may be 
able to sweep up a few grains of corn in the 
stables, before they are thro^wn away with the 
manure. 

Then clear the snow away in front of your door, 
throw the food down and go back out of sight. 
The birds will soon come, and in a few days they 




win even be waiting about for their morning meal 
before you bring it. 

You must not forget to hang a piece of fat from 
the branch of a tree, so that you may see the tits 
hang head downwards on the string to peck at it. 
A.nd if you hang up a bone with a httle meat on 
it the starKngs and jackdaws will come too. 





Then remember that birds want to drink. You 
can put water for them in a pan, if you change it 
when it freezes. But if you can spare a few pence 
to buy a cocoa-nut, you may make it serve two 
purposes. 

Saw it across the middle, and scoop out all the 
white from one half. Bore two holes near the rim of 
this cup, and make a handle with a piece of string 
Then hang it on a tree and put some water in it 
The l.urds will sit on the rim and drink. And as 



they nialcG it swing to and fro the water will not 
freeze. Then hang up the other half in the same 
way, but leave the white inside. The little tomtits 
will peck away, and light for the sweet food till it 
is all gone. 

A number of birds will come — robins, chaffinches, 
sparrows, wrens, starlings, rooks, jackdaws, 
thrushes, and many others. You will be able to 
notice the difference between the big missel-thrush, 
with his white spotted breast, and the smaller 
brown song-thrush. And if you put some nuts on 
the window-sill the nuthatch may come to fetch 
them if he lives near. 

So you will see the birds more closely than you 
can at any other time, and next summer, when 
they sing in the trees, they will be old friends. 

Iake a list of the birds which come to feed at youi' door in 
winter. 

There are many other small birds which you may 
find out for yourselves, but I should like to tell you of 
a few which are interesting. First there is the little 
Goldfinch, which is so useful to us because it eats 
thistle seeds and dandelion seeds. It builds a lovely 
little nest of fine roots, wool, and horsehair, and 
often lines it with the soft down of the coltsfoot, 
that big yellow flower which blooms in the spring 


and has feathery seed-boxes. The goldfinch has a 
beautiful red forehead and throat, and black wings 
barred with yellow, and tij)ped 'with, white. You 
may know it from the bullfinch because its breast 
is pale brown, while the bullfinch has a rich red 
breast and grey and black wings. 

Then there is the cock-Linnet with his crimson 
breast, bro^n wings, and a red patch on his head. 
Linnets change colour at difl^erent times of the 
year. In the winter, the breasts of both birds are 
grey striped with brown. 

All birds moult, that is change their feathers, at 
least once a year. The father-birds are nearly 
alw^ays more gaudy ^vhen they are building their 
nests. You will notice too that hen-birds are 
scarcely ever so gay as their mates. This is most 
likely because they sit on the nests, and it would 
not do for them to be seen too easily. 

Linnets feed in big flocks in the winter. You 
may see them in the evening dropping down among 
the gorse and other bushes to sleep. It is sad that 
both the goldfinch and the linnet are caught and 
sold to sing in cages. This is why we have not 
nearly so many in England as ^ve used to have. 

I hope you wall look out for the Nuthatch, a 
little bird with a short black beak, a blue-grey 
back and wings, and a pale yellow breast, shaded 
with red. He is often seen in orchards and gardens 
m the autumn, when the nuts are ripe. You may 
catch sight of him coming down a nut tree, head 
downwards. He sticks the nuts into the cracks of 
the trunk and hammers them with his beak to 



break them. You may sometimes find a little 
store of nuts which he has hidden at the foot of 
the tree. . He feeds on other things, besides nuts 
and beech-mast, and he will peck at a piece of 
bacon in winter, if you hang it out for him. 

You must listen for the Blackcap. You will hear 
him more easily than you will see him. He is a 
little dark grey bird, with a black head and a pale 
grey breast, and sings almost as well as a nightin- 
gale. He comes back to England in April, and if 
you listen well you may hear him practising his 
song. He hides himself in a thick bush and begins 
gently in a low voice, singing over and over again 
till he gains strength. In a few days his voice is 
ready, and he trills out a wild, sweet song all the 
summer day, flitting from bush to bush as he sings. 
He feeds on insects and berries, and brings up four 
or five little ones in a lovely nest made of dry grass 
and spiders' Tvebs, and lined with horsehair. Then 
he flies away in October till the next spring. But 
he has been so often caught that he is not so 
common as he used to be. 

Then there is the little Whitetnroat, which 
creeps along almost everywhere under the hedges, 
and is often called the " nettle-creeper." He too is 
a brown-grey bird with a little red at the tips oi 
his feathers and on his breast. He hops and flies 
a little way as the hedge-sparrow does, chattering 
all the time, and sometimes flying higher and 
higher and singing louder. He, too, comes in 
May and goes in October. 
. There are two other little birds you may very 





likely see. One is the Stonechat, which Uves on 

commons and sits on the top of the furze bushes. 

It is a small brown-black 

bird with white markings 

and a rusty red breast. It 

cries " chat, chat, chat," 

and hides its nest so well 

in the gorse bushes that 

you will scarcely find one. 

The other is the little 
Dipper or water- 
ouzel, which hops 
about the stones 
in the bed of " 
rapid streams 
ana rivers. It feeds on 
insects and water snails. 
It is a black bird not 
quite as big as a thrush, 
with a very short tail and a 
sno^'y-white breast. It has a 
curious way of dipping its head 
down and flirting its tail. 

There is no room to tell about 
magpies or jays, but if you have 
any near you, you will know 
them already. 






Find out these small birds and any others in your neigh- 
oourhood, and try to know their nests and eggs. 


We call " Birds of Prey " those which feed on the 
smaller animals, such as rabbits, mice, frogs, and 
snakes, as well as on other birds. The chief kinds 
in our country are eagles, falcons, hawks, and 
owls. 

If you live in the mountains of Scotland, or the 
north of England, you may, perhaps, have seen 
an eagle {see picture, p. 51). But the birds of 
prey you are most likely to know are hawks 
and owls. 

I am sure that sometimes when you are in the 
fields, you must have seen a bird with long pointed 
wings and a tail like a fan hovering in the air. 
This is the Kestrel or common hawk. Country 
people call him the " wind-hover." His wings beat 
the air so quickly that you can scarcely see them 
move, yet he keeps quite still in the same place. 
His bright eyes look eagerly on the ground. Now 
he darts a little up or down, and floats along some 
distance. Now he hovers again, and all at once 
drops to the ground. He has seen a mouse in the 
grass, and rises up with it in his claws. 

Farmers often shoot kestrels because they steal 
young partridges and chickens, when they cannot 
find other food. But they are very useful in killing 
field-mice, moles, beetles, and all kinds of vermin. 

If you cannot tame a young hawk, nor find a 



dead one, you can see on pp. 51 aiid 61 how to 
know a bird of prey. Look at the long toes and 
sharp claws of the eagle or the hawk. They pierce 
the skin of any animal he seizes. His hooked beak 
is A'ery strong, and has sharp edges, so that it cuts 
Uke shears. The upper half is pointed, and hangs 
over the lower half. A few strong pecks with this 
cruel beak soon kill the tiny mouse or larger 
animals, which are swallowed whole or torn to 
pieces. After a little time the furry skin and the 
bones are thrown up in a ball. The feet and legs of 
a bird of prey are covered ^th scales, so that when 
he is fighting he is not so much hurt by hard pecks. 

The kestrel's wings are strong and pointed, and 
he can fly quickly, or keep himself floating, as he 
pleases. He is about as large as a wood-pigeon. 
His back and ^ngs are a bright brick-red, and 
his tail is grey, tipped with white, with a black 
band across. The long feathers of his wings are 
black, while his breast is pale yellow. 

Another common hawk is the Sparrow-hawk, 
which has dark grey wings and a reddish-brown 
breast with orange stripes. He does not often 
hover, but glides along the hedges looking for 
birds and mice. He does more harm than the 
kestrel, for he often kills game. But he is useful in 
destroying mice, and insects, and in preventing the 
small birds, which eat the corn, from becoming too 
numerous. The mother sparrow-hawk is much 
larger than the father. 

Owls, like hawks, have hooked beaks and long 
sharp claws. But their beak is not so strong, and 



their feet are more useful for climbing. Their four 
toes stand, three in front and one behind, like most 
birds, but they can turn back the outer front toe so 
as to have two in front and two behind, like the 
woodpecker. 

Notice too the difference in their eyes. A hawk 
has his eyes on the sides of his head, but the ow^l 
has his in front of his face like you or 1. So, 
when he hunts in the twilight, he can peer down 
at things close to him. He can make the pupil of 
his eye as large as the cat does, so as to gather all 
the light there is. His feathers are so soft and 
downy that he makes very little noise as he flies, 
and he has large hidden ears with flaps over them, 
and can hear the slightest sound. Some owls have 
ear tufts sticking up in the air like a cat's ear. 

The owl you hear so often crying " to-whoo, 
to-whoo " is the brown or Ta^vny Owl. He hunts in 
the early morning and late evening. In the day- 
time he hides in holes of the trees and in church 
towers. If he is driven into the sunlight he winks 
and blinks, and cannot see clearly. But in the 
dusk, or the moonlight he flies noiselessly along 
the hedges, and catches mice, moles, frogs, and 
birds, swallowing the small ones whole and throvi^- 
ing back the feathers and skin in little balls. 

The Barn Owl is a much lighter bird than the 
brown owl. His back and wings are buff colour, 
and his breast and face are white. He cries "te- 
whit, te-whee " in a loud screech, and is therefore 
often called the "Screech Owl." He hides in the 
barn, or in trees, by day and hunts by night, feeding 



chiefly on mice. When he conies out by daylight 
the chaffinches and other little birds tease him, for 
they know he cannot see well. 

Compare a hawk and an owl. Notice the cere, or piece of 
bare skin at the top of the beak, which all birds of prey have. 
It is partly covered by bristles in the owls. Try to draw the 
foot and beak of the eagle, pp. 51 and 73. 




"You go and scare they rooks out o' that field. 
They be eating all the seed," I heard a Devonshire 
farmer say to his boy one day. He was quite right. 
He had not sown his wheat deep enough, and the 
rooks were feeding on it. 

But some time after another farmer pointed to 
the rooks in his field, where the corn was green. 
"See how they be pulling up they young oats," 
said he. And so they were. But when we looked 
at the plants which they had pecked up, we found 
that each one had a place in the root where a grub 
had been living. 

This time the rooks had been doing useful work. 
Wire-worms and other grubs eat away the roots of 
grass, corn, and turnips all across a field. When the 
rooks kill a few grubs, they often save the whole 
crop. 

Once, a long time ago, some Devoi:shire farmers 
gave a large reward for rooks' heads, thinking they 
did harm to the farms. All the rooks around were 

 

soon killed. But the farmers were sorry after- 
wards. During the next three years all their crops 
were destroyed by insects and grubs. They had to 
persuade some fresh rooks to build in their neigh- 
bourhood to keep down the insects. 

No doubt rooks do some mischief, for they eat 
birds' eggs, and newly sown corn, new potatoes, and 
green walnuts. They even sometimes pull grain 
out of the stacks, when they are short of food. But 
they destroy so many wire-worms and grubs, snails 
and slugs, maggots and insects of all kinds, that 
they do more good than harm. 

You all know the heavy whirring cockchafer, 
which flops into your face in the evening. But 
perhaps you do not know that before he had wings 
he lived for three or four years undergrovmd feed- 
ing on the roots of grass and corn. Rooks eat these 
cockchafer grubs wherever they can find them, 
and so save our crops. 

I hope you have rooks near you, for they are 
delightful to watch. When they build their huge 
nests high up in the forks of trees, they make a 
great deal of noise and bustle. The father-rook 
begins to fetch food for his mate even before she 
lays her eggs, and feeds her all the time she is 
sitting. 

The old birds feed the young ones long after 
they are hatched. If you watch, you may see the 
young ones sitting on the edge of the nest opening 
their mouths to be fed. Rooks like to build near 
old houses, and use the same nests year after year. 
They will not allow strange rooks to join them. 





If the trees in which they huild lose their leaves 
ill winter, the rooks do not stay there long after 




the last young ones are able to ny. About August 
or September they often go to the beech and pine 
woods to sleep, and do not come back to their 



rookery till the spring. But every now and then 
on their way to and fro they call at their rookery 
and look after their nests. 

Crows do not live together in numbers like 
rooks. They live in pairs, and build their nests 
in the top of some high tree away from houses. 
They are more mischievous than rooks, for they 
feed on birds and young lambs, young pigeons, 
ducks, or chickens. 

You may tell a crow from a rook at a dis- 
tance because you very seldom see more than two 
together. When you can see them near, you will 
know them apart, because the rook, after he is a 
year old, has a bald patch on his head just above 
his beak, where the crow has feathers. 

Have you ever noticed how gravely a rook 
walks across a field? He does not hop like a 
thrush or a sparrow, but moves one foot after the 
other, and gives a little jump every now and then. 
One or two always remain on the trees near, to 
give notice of danger, and when these sentinels cry 
" caw-caw " the whole flock rises. They fly away, 
flapping their wings slowly, and drop down one 
by one in another field. 

A friend of mine who lives near a rookery says 
she often sees from her window one or two sen- 
tinel rooks go round every morning and wake up 
the others, and it is very funny to see how the 
lazy ones scramble up in a great hurry at the last, 
so as to be in time to fly away with the rest. 

Though rooks will not allow another party of 
their own kind to join them, they allow starlings, 




jackdaws, and fieldfares to feed with them. A 
Jackdaw moves much Hke a rook, though he is 
a more sprightly bird. He is smaller and has a 
grey patch on his 
head. The Starling 
{see p. 53) is a walk- 
ing bird. Though 
his head and back 
are black, he has so 
many bright colours 
on the tips of his 
feathers that he does 
not look so dark as 
the rook and the 
jackdaw, but very 
bright and gay. 

I wonder why 
these birds like so 
much to follow the 
rooks ? Perhaps it is 
because the rook has 
a keen scent, and 

turns up the earth for food with his long beak. 
The jackdaw and starling only pick up what they 
find above ground, so when the rook turns up the 
earth, they may get some of the food. 





Try to see a rook, a crow, a jackdaw, and a starling, a 
magpie and a jay, and point out how you know them apart. 

 

Besides the birds which live and feed on the land 
there are a great many which live mostly on the 
water. Some of these are called "waders," and 
some are " swimmers " and have webbed feet. We 
read about two waders, the coot and the moorhen, 
in Book II. To-day we will talk about the swim 
ming birds. 

If you live by the seaside, you will know the 
gulls which float on the sea, and often fly a long 
way up the rivers. Gulls come up the river Thames 
as far as London, and feed in the ponds of the 
parks. In the winter it is a pretty sight to watch 
them circling round and round, and catching the 
food which people throw to them. 

You may have seen Cormorants {see p. 38), big 
black birds which fly heavily over the sea, with 
their long necks stretched out and their narrow 
wings beating the air. Then they settle on the 
water, and suddenly jump up and dive down head 
foremost, presently coming up with a fish, which 
it takes them often some time to swallow. 

But if you live in the country near a large lake 
or a river, you are more likely to see a curious little 
swimming bird called the little Grebe or dabchick. 
This is a brown bird with a thin neck and head, 
which paddles about among the reeds on the bank 
of a river, or swims along quietly, diving down 
every now and then to catch water-snails, fish, or 






weeds. You will have to move very quietly if you 
want to get near the dabchick, for it dives down 
at the least alarm and comes up a long way off, out 
of sight. 

If you have not seen any of these web-footed 
birds, nor even a wild duck yet every child knows 






the tame Duck which lives in our farmyards. Our 
ducks and drakes ^vere tamed long, long ago from 
wild ducks, and are still very like them. Let us see 
what we can learn about a duck. 

First I want you to look at her as she waddles 
across the yard. Her feet have a skin between the 
three front toes which joins them together. That is 



to say she is " web-footed." Now notice that, as she 
lifts her foot, the skin folds up like a fan, and when 
she puts her foot down, it spreads out again. When 
she reaches the pond, she glides into the water and 
begins to paddle, using one foot after the other, just 
as you do when you walk. In clear water you can 
see that as she puts her foot forward the skin shuts 
up, as it did when she walked, but when she puts 
it back and strikes the water, it opens and makes 
a paddle, and so she rows herself along. 

Her legs grow far back on her body, so that she 
can use them to twist and turn herself about, and 
she can tip her head and body down into the water 
to look for water-snails and tadpoles, while she 
paddles along with her tail up in the air. 

Next notice how light her body is. It floats quite 
on the top of the water. This is partly because she 
has a layer of light fat under her skin, and partly 
because she has a thick covering of down under her 
feathers. There is a great deal of air caught in this 
down, and this makes her light. 

Do you know why her feathers do not get wet 
and draggled in the water? The reason is very 
curious. Her outer feathers are all smeared with 
oil which she gets from a little pocket near hei 
tail. Look at her when she comes out of the 
water. She presses her beak against her tail and 
then draws the feathers through the beak. When 
she has oiled them in this way, they are water 
proof and keep the wet off her body. 

Next watch her as she feeds. She goes gobble, 
gobble through tlie mud, and often throws her 



"head up to swallow something she has found. Her 
beak is broad and flat. It is hooked at the tip, but 
higher up it is covered with a soft skin full of 
nerves. With this skin the duck feels what is in 
the mud as well as if she saw it. The tip and edges 
of the beak are very horny and sharp, and, both 

above and below, it is lined 
•with, thin strips of horn. 
When she closes her beak 
these strips fit into each 
other and make a strainer 
With her sharp beak she 
cuts the weeds or kills the 
snails. With the strainer 
she sifts the mud and 
keeps the food in her 
mouth, forcing out the 
water with her thick 
tongue. Geese, swans, and all wild ducks have 
feet and beaks much like our farmyard duck. 

You may have seen wild-ducks in the lakes or 
rivers. The drake is a very handsome bird. His 
head and neck are a dark shiny green. He has a 
white collar, and his breast is the colour of a 
chestnut. His wings and back are partly brown 
and partly green. The four middle feathers of his 
tail are a glossy black and curl up. The others 
are grey, edged with white. When the wild drake 
changes his coat in June he puts oif this beautiful 
plumage, and puts on a plain brown and grey suit- 
like the mother duck, till August. Then he begins 
to moult again, and in October is as gay as before. 


The cormorants and gulls have not beaks like the 
duck, for they do not grope in the mud. Their bills 
are sharp and strong for fishing, and their ^ngs 
long for flying. The little dabchick, on the contrary, 
has short wings, as he chiefly floats on the water. 
His beak is not very long, and it has no hook at the 
end. His feet are rather large, but the web is not 
wide as in ducks. 

There are a great many other web-footed birds. 
Try if you can find some. 

Examine a dead duck. Notice the webbed foot, the parts of 
the beak, the thick down, and the glossy oiled feathers not 
wetted in water. Draw the foot of any dead bird you can 
find. 



Almost every morning, when I yvsike, I hear a 
curious cry, " tek-tek-tek," in my garden, and I 
know that if I go out and look, I shall see the cat 
about somewhere. Sometimes many birds "will be 
making the same cry all together, and when the 
cat is on the lawn I have seen the swallows swoop 
down and peck her back, and then rise up again 
before she can turn round. 

For the birds know very well that the cat is 
their enemy, and scold at her when she conies near^ 
especially when they have young ones. 


I wonder if you have ever thought as you lie 
snugly in bed how many dangers there are for the 
little birds outside? The owl prowling along the 





hedge is on the look-out for sitting mothers and 
for young birds. The cat may climb the tree and 
put her sharp claws into the nest. Weasels and 
stoats are hunting about to catch any birds which 



are sleeping near the ground, or even in the trees, 
and snakes like eggs for their early breakfast as 
much as you or I do. 

The fox is a great enemy of the ground birds 
Partridges, pheasants, and grouse dread a fox at 
night, as the fowls and ducks do in the farmyard; 
while in the daytime the hawk is a terror to aU 
birds. The mother lark, on her nest, crouches down 
in the hope that the grass may hide her. The 
father lark, as he soars, rises or falls to try to 
escape. Other little song-birds flutter away to 
the bushes; partridges run to cover, and pigeons 
hide in the wood w^hen a hawk is near. 

All these are the birds' natural enemies; for of 
course animals must kill their food, and we too 
kill birds to eat. But we need not destroy their 
nests nor take their eggs for show, nor catch them, 
as many do, in nets to put them in cages, or to use 
their feathers for ornaments. 

Many birds, which were quite common thirty 
years ago, are rare now because such a number of 
eggs and birds have been taken. So laws have 
been made to protect the little song-birds, birds 
of prey, and sea-birds, as well as partridges and 
pheasants. 

All over England people are now forbidden to 
shoot or snare any wild hh^ds except on their own 
land, or to take their eggs, between the 15th of 
-March and the 1st of August. This leaves the birds 
time to bring up their little ones. And there is a 
special list of birds which people may not disturb, 
even in their own garden, during this "close time." 


I am sure you will be glad to know that the 
lark is one of these birds. 

Then there are some parts of England where 
people are not allowed to take the eggs of wild 
birds at any time. These are places, such as some 
of the Broads in Norfolk, and the sea-shore at 
Slapton Lee in Devonshire, where many birds 
breed. 

You cannot know all these places, but there is 
one very safe rule. Do not take any eggs, nor kill 
any birds ; then you are sure not to do "wrong. 

Watch the birds in the garden, and the fields, 
and the woods. Learn to know where they build 
their nests round your house, and take care they 
are not disturbed. When you wake up in the 
morning listen to their songs. You will soon know 
them, and know too when they are happy, or when 
something is frightening them. Then notice what 
good work they do, eating the slugs and snails, the 
wire-worms and grubs. 

You must drive them away when you see them 
eating your seeds, or your young buds, or the 
sprouting corn. But you can feed them in winter 
to make them your friends, and you will be sur- 
prised how much you can learn about their ways. 




These lessons are intended to be read after the teacher 
has given one or more lectures on the subject. It is not 
necessary to read the book straight through. Different lessons 
are suited for different seasons, and in some cases one lesson 
may serve for a month's work ; the children being encouraged 
to observe and collect. 


I "WONDER if you have ever stopped to think 
how usefvil trees are in the ?\;\^orld. We saw in 
Book III. that plants make the air i^iire for ns to 
breathe. Trees, with their hundreds of leaves, do 
a lar^e part of this work, and they do a great 
deal besides. 

Let us imagine a little tree growing up in the 
wood, or in the field. It may perhaps be eaten 
away by rabbits or squirrels before it is a year 
old. If so, it has been useful as food. But if it 
grows up, it begins even the first year to drop 
some leaves in the autumn, and these help to 
make leyf-mould, and so give food for other 
plants. 

So it goes on each year, making leaves, puri- 
fying the air, and producing leaf-mould. But very 
soon insects begin to make their home in the young 
sapling, for every kind of tree has some insects 

living on it. A moth conies and lays her eggi^ 
under the leaves, and the caterpillars feed on theno 
when they are hatched. A beetle conies and lays 
her eggs in the bark, and the grub feeds there, 
till it turns into a beetle, or til^ the woodpecker or 
the nuthatch find and eat it. 

In this way every tree is quite a little colony 
of living creatures. Then the birds come and sleep 
in its boughs at night and build their nests there 
in the spring. If the trees are elms the rooks 
often choose them for their rookery. If they are 
firs in a wood the woodpigeon ^vill sleep there, or 
pheasants and hawks perch on their branches, 
^lile the thrush and the blackbird spend the night 
in laurels, or hollies and other evergreen trees. 

When the tree has grown big it bears flowers 
and fruits. These fruits, jr the seeds in them, 
serve as food for many creatures. The birds feed 
on the berries, the nuts, and the acorns. The 
squirrel makes its home in the beech-trees, and 
eats all kinds of nuts it can find. The field-mouse, 
hedgehog, and pig make good meals off the beech- 
nuts and acorns on the ground, while we eat the 
fruit of the sweet chestnut and the walnut tree, the 
apples, pears and cherries from the orchard. 

How useful the trees are to man ! They help 
to keep the ground moist and fresh. There is 
always more rain in a country where there are 
trees, and the ground Avould grow parched and 
dry, if it were not for their pleasant shade. How 
the cattle gather under them, when the sun is 
bright, and stand chewing the cud so peacefully 



out of the glare and heat ! And how glad you are 
on your way to school, if you can walk through 
a shady lane instead of along the high road. 
Then they are so beautiful in the spring ; when 
the fresh green leases burst out they make us 
glad to think that every year tree-life begins 
again. 

On the other hand, some trees are so old, 
several hundreds of years, that they remind us 
of times long gone by, and make us love our 
country when we think Mdiat a long history 
those trees could tell. 

But even trees must die at last, and, if they 
are to be of use to us we must cut them down 
before they decay. Then, after the tree is dead, 
how useful it is ! 

Let us just go through one day of your life, 
and see how much of a tree you use. You get 
up in the morning, and the first thing to be 
done is to light a fire with wood. You sit on a 
chair : that is made of wood. You open the door : 
that is of ^'ood too. You take up your umbrella 
when you start for school : the handle was once 
the bough of a tree. You go upstairs to fetch 
your bag : the stairs are made out of planks. 
You set off on your way, and have to cross a 
brook : the bridge is made of wood. You are 
careful to shut the gate of the field : that, too, 
is made of a tree, and so is the paling round the 
school. 

You take your place in class. Your feet rest 
on deal planks which come from the fir-tree. 




You sit on a ^vooden bench. Your slate has a 
wooden frame. Your pen has a wooden handle. 
The teacher puts up a wooden easel and a wooden 
blackboard upon it. She opens the ink-bottle to 
fill the inkstands, and the cork of the bottle comes 
from the bark of a tree, while the ink itself is 
made with acid which comes from a gall made 
by an insect on an oak-tree. 

Dinner-time comes. Surely, now, you will not 
want any wood. You fetch your basket with your 
dinner in it. That may be made of wood-chips or 
willow twigs, and the pastry which you eat is 
made of j)aste, which your mother rolled out on 
a wooden board with a wooden rolling-pin. 

As you come out from school you get a lift in 
a farm-cart, that too is made of wood, and so is 
the wheelbarrow you use, when you get home, 
for wheeling manure into the garden. You put 
your school things away in the old oak-chest in 
the corner, and when yovi go to bed after supper, 
you look up at the old beams across the ceiling 
and fall asleep dreaming of wood everywhere. 

You could add many more things that I have 
forgotten ; and even no^\' we have not reckoned 
up the gums, the turpentine, the oils, the tannin, 
and the many sweet scents which we get from 
trees. Nor have we spoken of boats, and railway 
carriages, nor of the beautiful wood-carvings in 
our churches and other public buildings. Surely 
the world would get on very badly without trees ! 

Name any things made of wood besides those given in the 
/esson. 









We saw in Book III. that some plants live much 
longer than others. Some live for one year only, 
make their seeds and die. These we call arinuals. 
Others live two years. They grow their roots and 
leaves one year, and flower and make their seeds 
the next year. These we call biennials, because bi 
means two. Others live for many years, and are 
called 23e?^ennm/s. Trees are perennials, for they 
live for very many years. There are some oak 
trees more than a thousand years old. 

Yet all these old trees began their lives as little 
seedlings, like the bean you grew on the top of 
the earth in the flower-pot. How, then, have 
they managed to live so long > We shall learn 
this best by looking at a young seedling. 

If you poke about in a wood, you will easily 
find some small plant, either of oak, or beech, or 
hazel, which has grown up from a nut, or an 
acorn trodden into the ground. I am going to 
take an oak tree, because I have one close to my 
door and can give you a picture of it. If you 
get an acorn and stick it in the neck of a bottle 
the same way up as it sits in its cup, and keep 
the bottle full of water, you can grow^ a small oak 
for yourself, and see if yours is like mine. 

First the acorn puts out some roots downwards. 
Then the husk splits, and you can see the two thick 
seed-leaves open, with the growing tip between 



them. This tip now grows steadily upwards and 
Koon puts forth leaves. There may be one, or 

even two, one above the 
other, on the sides of the 
stem. But there will cer- 
tainly be two or three close 
together at the top of the little tree 
by the time autumn comes. At 
the foot of each leaf, nestling up 
to the stem, will be a little bud, and 
at the end of the stem will be a 
stout bud, bigger than all the rest. 

The difference between the oak- 
plant and the bean which we grew in 
Book III. is that the stem is woody.' 
If you get another oak-plant of the 
same age from the wood, and cut off 
its head this is what you will see 
(Fig. 1, p. 13). In the middle there is 
a round white patch, p. This is 
the pith, or soft part, which you 
scoop out of the branch of an 
elder-tree when you make a 
popgun. Next conies a ring of 
soft whitish wood, iv. Outside 
this again is the harl:, b. 

Now you know that water, 
with earthy matter in it, has 
to rise up from the roots and 
go to the leaves, to be made 
into food. It travels up through this ring of living 
wood, and when it comes back it makes new wood 






and new bark just where the wood and the bark 
meet. You know how easy it is to peel the bark 
off wood. That is because the tender new part 
is between them, and gives way easily. 

But as soon as autumn comes, the roots leave 
off taking in water ; and the crude s«p, as it is 


called, does not rise up any more. The stalks of 
the leaves dry up where they join the stem, and 
they fall off. The tree rests for the winter. 

Now watch your little plant next spring. You 
will see the big bud at the tip, and often two 
other buds close to it, begin to grow into branches 
and have leaves of their own. But in a very young 
tree the smaller ones usually die away and the 
trunk grows straight up. However, you can always 
tell where the new growth began in the spring, 
because there is a ring (r, p. 12) left by the scales of 
the buds. The wood of the new piece will be just 




like the wood of the lower piece was last year. 
But that lower piece "will be growing some fresh 
wood and getting bigger (Fig. 2, p. 13). The sap 
will go up and down as before, and a new ring of 
wood (to i2) ^11 form outside the old wood, and a 
v^ery thin new ring of bark inside the old bark. 
So at the end of the second year, while the ne^v 
piece will have only one ring of wood, the old 
piece below the scales will have two rings {iv and 
w2), with a mark between the rings, showing 
where the tree rested in the winter. 

All this is rather difficult to see in such small 
trees, and you must look at the diagrams. But 
if you go into the wood when they are cutting 
down timber, you "will see the rings much more 
distinctly in the older trees, and you will like to 
look at the trunks, and try to make out how old 
the trees are. You cannot be quite sure that you 
count all the years, because as the new wood grows, 
the old is squeezed together, and makes a very hard 
wood, called " heart- wood," in the middle of the 
trunk. But you can be sure that the tree is not 
younger, and most likely much older, than the 
rings you can count. 

Now to come back to our question, how trees 
live to be so old. Year after year they make a 
new ring of wood, narrower and narrower as they 
grow older. Through the younger rings the crude 
sap goes up to the leaves, and the food-sap conies 
down to feed the parts of the tree. Buds tire 
formed every spring on the stems at the foot of 
each leaf, and these buds are Kke new plants. 





They start with fresh strength, making new food 
for the tree, which carries them up on its trunk 
and branches into the Hglit and air. 

The heart-wood of the tree is really dead, and 
sometimes decays away while the outer part of 
the tree is still flourishing. But many of the 
rings of wood far inside the trunk still want 
food, and if you look at a felled tree you can see 
how they get it. Besides the rings, you will see 
some lines (in), like the spokes of a wheel, starting 
from the centre of the trunk and spreading out 
to the bark. These lines are made of pith, like 
that "\ve saw in the middle of the young seedling 
oak. Until they are squeezed away the sap passes 
along them all through the tree. 

There are some trees, such as the palms, which 
you see in hot-houses, which do not grow in rings. 
But these are not English, and do not concern us 
here. 

Get several pieces of tree-branches and tr-y to see the bark, 
the inner bark, the rings of wood and the heart-wood — Lilac, 
Lime, and Elder show the parts well. Oak and Pine show 
heart-wood best. 



When a young tree has made plenty of wood and 
branches, it begins to use some of its buds for 
making flowers. These buds groTV in the same 
places as leaf -buds. In some trees they grow where 
the leaf joins the stem. In others they grow at 
the tips of the twigs. They are generally rounder 
and less pointed than the leaf-buds. 

The flowers of the oak are very small, so you 
had better look out for a horse-chestnut tree and 
gather a bough for this lesson. You will find bvids 
on a horse-chestnut tree almost any time in the 
year, except when it is in full leaf, and then they 
will be very small. 

The best time to look is just at the end of the 
winter, "when the tree is bare. First notice the 
smaller buds, which grow two and two opposite 
each other along the twig. You will see belo^w each 
bud a scar marking the place on which the leaf 
grew last year. This scar is shaped like a horseshoe, 
and has several black spots on it arranged like the 
nails. These spots show where the bundles of tubes 
were, which carried the sap into the leaf. 

Now pick one of the buds to pieces. They are 
^mall, and you will not find it very easy, but you 
can take off the brown sticky scales, and you will 
find inside, first some soft gummy do\\^i, and then 
bhe young green leaves, tightly folded togetheri 
with, a green growing tip between them. 




So if you had left that bud, and it could got food 
enough, it would have grown into a small branch in 
the spring, with leaves on it. But it is very seldom 
that all the buds on a branch grow. The stronger 
ones take the food, and 
the weaker ones either 
die or wait till next year. 

Now look at the buds 
on the tips of the 
branches. They are very |^ 
much larger than those 
growing on the sides, and 
you can examine them 
easily. When you have 
taken away from twelve 
to seventeen sticky scales, 
you will come to the same 3-. 
kind of soft Avliite gummy i- - 
down which you found 
in the leaf-buds, making 
a warm bed for the 
tender growing parts in- 
side. 

But this bud is not 
all leaves like the smaller 
one. It has four small 
bright green leaves, and wrapped up inside them 
is a tiny spike covered with little knobs (f). 

You cannot examine the flowers on this spike 
without a microscope. But if you wait and watch 
till May, you will see others like it gradually open- 
ing out into a lovely branch of flowers, and I think 




you will like them all the better for knowing how 
the tree prepared them last autumn, when it was 
covered with leaves, and wrapped them up warm 
all the winter in sticky buds. 

And while you are waiting for the flowers, look 
at the tree itself. The trunk is smooth and round 
The branches begin to grow out of it about ten feel 
from the ground. They grow two and two opposite 
to each other like the leaves, except where a bud 
has failed. The lower branches, which of course 
are the oldest, stretch out farthest, so that the tree 
rounds off very gracefully up to the top. 

Then, as April comes, the brown scales fall from 
the leaf-buds, and the tree is covered with bright 
green downy leaves. They are each cut into seven 
leaflets, which hang down from the tip of the leaf- 
stalk like a half-opened umbrella. Little by little, as 
they grow stronger, they rise up into a broad leaf 
with seven fingers. It is while they are doing this 
that the flower-buds throw off their scales, the four 
green leaves open out, and the flower spike begins 
to hang out its snow-white flowers, streaked with 
pink and yellow (see p. 10). 

The flowers nearest to the branch open first and 
grow strong. They are perfect flowers, with five 
green sepals and five beautiful crimped petals, and 
have both stamens and seed-box inside. These will 
^orm the chestnuts which ripen in the autumn. The 
flowers nearer to the tip of the spike have only 
stamens inside the petals. They wither away as 
soon as they have shed their pollen-dust. 

If you can get an old flower spike when the 



flowers are withered, and c at the seed-box of a flower 
across, you will see that it has three divisions with 
two little seeds in each. But when you pick up the 
prickly fruit in the autumn, though it burst into 
three parts, there are generally only two horse- 
chestnuts inside (see p. 10), with another very tiny 
One. The two big seeds have starved out the other 
four little ones and grown big and strong. If the 
chestnuts are brown and shiny, they are ripe, and 
will grow if you sow them. 

Though the horse-chestnut is very beautiful in 
the summer, its leaves turn yellow very early 
and fall in August, and then you can see tlie buds 
already formed for next year. All boys know 
that horse-chestnuts are bitter and not good 
eating. The sweet chestnuts, which we roast, come 
from quite a different tree, and are not seeds, 
but fruits. 

Bring a branch of Ilorse-chestniit and examine the buds. 
Find a flower spilce in May ; look at the ovary in June, and 
the fruit in September. 


The horse-chestnut is the only big English tree 
which has large flower-spikes. There are many 
pretty flowering shrubs in the hedge, such as the 
Blackthorn, the May, and the Guelder rose. But 
all the big trees have tiny flowers As some of 
these trees flower before they open their ieo^ves, 



you can see their blossoms. So we will look at a 
few. 

If you live where there are many bees, and 
where there are any trees of the conmion Sallow 
Willow growing in the hedges, or the woods, go out 
some sunny day in March, and lie down under one 
of the trees and listen. 

Before long you will hear a buzzing, which will 
go on as long as the sun is bright. For the bees 
have wakened from their long winter sleep, and 
want honey and pollen to make bee-bread. There 
are very few flowers open in March and, as the 
sweet smell of honey comes from the blossoms of 
the willow, the bees are quick to find them out. 

Perhaps you will ask me how you are to know 
a Sallow^ Willow, You know it quite well, though 
you may not know the name. It is a big shrubby 
tree, with a purple-brown stem, w^hich grows in 
the hedges and woods, and from which people 
cut branches before Palm Sunday, and call them 
palms. 

All up the twigs you will see in March and 
April round soft bodies about as big as thimbles 
growing now on one side now on the other. It is 
into these that the bees are poking their heads. 
You remember the catkins which we saw on the 
nut-trees in Book I. These soft bodies clinging 
close to the willow stems are also catkins. In 
willows they stand up, instead of hanging down as 
they do on the nut-trees, and on the sallow willow 
tjiey hug the stem. 

But now I want yoi: to look a little further. 






rhe tree under which you sit may ha\e broad 
yellow catkins (2, plate, p. 20), and if you gathei 
a branch and look closely at it, you will see 
the yellow anthers standing out all rooind the 
catkin. Children call these "golden palms." But 
you may find, not so very far away, another of 
the same kind of tree, on which the catkins 
are soft and grey 
(1, plate, p. 20). 
They are much 
longer and nar- 
rower than the 
golden catkins. 
Children call them 

' silver pussy - 
palms." 

Gather a branch 
from each of these 
trees and take 
them to school. 
When you pick 
them to pieces, 
you will find that each catkin is ma^do up of a 
number of tiny flowers. In the golden catkins 
each flower is only a little scaly leaf (l, 2) 
with two stamens growing on it. No ! I forgot. 
There is something else, for at the bottom of each 
scaly leaf is a small cup (fl), holding a drop of 
honey. So you see there are i)lenty of drops of 

honey in a catkin. 

Then if you pick the silver-pussy-palm to pieces, 
you will find the same honey cup («) at the 




bottom of the scale, but instead of stamens, there 
is a Kttle seed-box or ovary (o) shaped hke a bottle, 
with a crumpled stigma (s). 

^ Now you see the use of the honey. As the dust- 
bags and the seed-boxes are on different trees, the 
flowers have to tempt the bees to carry the pollen. 
It is wise to plant willows near where bees are 
kept, for they get plenty of honey from them in 
the spring. The Osier willow, which grows in the 
marshes, and is used for making baskets, is in 
bloom at the same time as the sallow. But the 
common English willow which grows into a large 
tree, and the Crack willow whose branches break 
off so easily when you bend them, bloom later, 
when their narrow pointed leaves are out. They 
all bloom early, however, and when the tiny seeds 
covered Tvith down are blown out of the catkins 
many a little bird uses them to line its nest. 

Another tree, which blooms before its leaves 
come, is the English poplar, which groTvs by the 
streams, or in the woods. Poplars have their two 
kinds of flowers on different trees, like the ^villows. 
But they have no honey, and no bees come near 
them. I think that if you have any poplars in your 
woods and watch them, you will guess how they 
manage. For when the wild March winds are 
blowing, the long hanging catkins swing to and 
fro, and the dry pollen-dust is blown through the 
lair from tree to tree. 

I wonder if you know which tree I mean by the 
English poplar? Not those tall stiff trees which 
point straight up to the sky. Those come from 



TREES WITH CATKIN FLOWERS. 



25 



Italy and are called Lombardy poplars. The 
English poplars are graceful trees with very broad 



leaves hanging on long stalks. The white poplar 
has soft white hairs under its leaves, and the leaves 
of the aspon or trembling poplar are silky under- 
neath. The leaves turn on their long stalks when 

 

the wind blows and look very pretty as they show 
their white sides. 

One other tree you must look for, which has it? 
stamens in long loose catkins and its ovary in a 
little bud with scales round it. This is our friend 
the oak after it has grown into a large tree. The 
oak flowers in the spring, just as the leaves are 
coming out. You will easily see the catkins waving 
in the wind, but the flowers which will grow into 
acorns are very small and grow singly, or in pairs, 
between the leaf -stalk and the stem. Each one has 
a number of small scales round it, which by-and-by 
will harden into the cup of the acorn. 

But the oak is such a i important tree that we 
must talk of it in a separate lesson. 

Bring willow branches in March with stamen-catkins, and 
others with seed-forming catkins. Look for the honey cup 
Bring leaves and flowers of the English poplai*. 


I WONDER if you have any woods near you with 
oak trees growing close together, or mixed with 
beech and ash trees. This is the way they are 
grown, when they are to be cut into long planks, 
or poles, and most likely there will be some wood, 
where you can stop and look at them on your way 
home from school. 

They will have straight, smooth trunks; some 
twenty, some thirty, some perhaps fifty feet liigh, 
before the branches spread out above. Yet you 



know that your seedling oak has buds, first on one 
side, then on the other, all up the stem. Ho"w is it 
that these buds have not groTVTi into branches? 

The reason is that in a thick w'ood, where the 
trees crowd each other, every tree wants to raise 
its head up to the light. So- in tae spring when the 
leaves and buds open out at the top of the little 
tree, and the crude sap rises up to them from the 
roots, the tree wants so much to use for growing 
up higher that only a small quantity goes down 
again to make new wood. So the buds lower down 
do not get enough food to grow, and they either 
die or become dormant. That is, they remain 
waiting for another opportunity, which often never 
comes. For this reason oaks in a wood grow 
taller and taller with only a crown of branches 
and leaves near the top. 

But if you can find an old oak out in the open 
field, or at the edge of the wood, ^vhere it has 
plenty of room, you will see that it has grown 
differently. The trunk is much larger, and the 
branches grow out lower down. In many big oaks 
a man can reach the lower boughs as he stands 
under it.' The branches are very heavy and stretch 
out widely all round, so that an old oak tree covers 
a great deal of space in open ground. If the trunk 
were not very strong it could not bear the weight 
of such huge branches. But it is very broad at the 
bottom and then curves in and rises like a stout 
pillar till it becomes broad again where the 
branches divide away from it. 

When Smeaton, the great engineer, built the 


Eddystone lighthouse, he shaped it like the trunk 
of an oak, and the lighthouse stood firm against 
wind and waves for more than a hundred years. 

The oak has a very thick strong root from which 
long ropy roots run out all round the tree. I will 
tell you a way by Tv^hich you may know how far the 
roots of a tree spread underground. Look at the 
branches and see how far they stretch out from 
the trunk, for the roots will reach just as far 
underground as the branches do above ground. 

The reason of this is very interesting. You will 
remember that the tips of the roots are the mouths 
of a plant. They drink in the Tvater. Now when it 
rains, the raindrops trickle from leaf to leaf till 
they come to the tips of the branches, and then they 
drip down and sink into the ground. The roots 
would get very little rain-water if they stopped 
under the tree where you and I stand to keep out 
of the rain. But as the tree grows, the roots find 
their way farther and farther out, till they reach 
the place where the drip will be. 

You Avill find it useful to know this in gardening 
and farming, for tree roots are often very trouble- 
some. 

When you have looked at the rugged bark of 
the old oak, which is so useful for tanning leather, 
look up at the branches. They twist and turn in all 
directions, and there is a very thick joint wherever 
a new branch starts. 

You can see the reason of this, if you look at 
your young tree (p. 12), or at a t^vig of the old tree. 
There is not one bud at the tip of the twigs as there 





was in the horse-c4iestniit, but two, three, or some- 
times more. All these buds crowd each other, and 
vhe middle one generally dies. The others go off 
different ways, and so make what carpenters call 
" knee-joints." These were used for shipbuilding in 
olden days, because they are very strong. But now 
that ships are made of iron, knee-timber is not so 
much wanted, 
and straight 
planks and poles 



are more valu- 
able. So it is 
best now to plant 
oaks in woods, 
where their stems 
grow straight 
and smooth. 

Oak timber has 
always been valu- 
able. The beams 
of Westminster 
Hall, which was 
built about nine 
hundred years ago, were made of Durmast Oak, and 
were only recently i*epaired. Man}' country cottages 
have old chests and carved chairs in them quite 
as old as this. The heartwood of the oak is very 
firm and strong, and this is why the old song says : 

"Heaits of Oak are our ships, 
Hearts of Oak are oui- men." 

You can see the trunk and V)ranches of the oak 

best in winter. Then when April is nearly over, a 


pretty crfmson colour comes on all the buds, the 
leaves open out, and the loose catkins hang down 
between them, while the tiny acorn flowers nestle 
between the leaf -stalk and the stem. 

When the leaves are fully out, and the acorns 
are beginning to form, try if you can find the two 
kinds of English oak. Their leaves are much the 
same shape, long and cut into deep divisions. But 
the leaves of the Common Oak (1, p. 30) have very 
short leaf -stalks, they almost touch the stem, while 
the acorns stand on long stalks. In the other tree 
called the Durmast Oak the leaves usually have 
longer stalks, and the acorns have none. 

The evergreen oak, which is often grown in 
gardens, was brought from Italy. Its leaves are 
something like the leaves of the holly, so it is called 
the holm oak or holly oak. 

Get a branch of oak and notice the crowded buds. Get a 
log of oak and notice the dark heartwood and the rings round 
it. Also the rugged bark. Try to find the two kinds of English 
oak. Notice the scales grown together in the acoi-n cup. 



The oak feeds more creatures than any other 
English tree. Not only do the pigs, the hedgehogs, 
the squirrels, and the field-mice feed on the acorns, 
but more than fifty kinds of insects get their food 
from some part of the tree. 

Many of these are too small for you to find, but 
you will enjoy looking out for others. If you 







examine an oak-tree in May, you will most likely 
Rnd some of its leaves rolled up, either from the 
tip towards the stalk, or from side to side. Undo 
this roll and you will find a caterpillar inside, or 
perhaps a chrysalis. There are two kinds of 
caterpillars which roll up oak leaves. One, which 
is called simply the Oak-moth caterpillar, is large. 
It rolls up the leaf rather untidily, and spins a 
cocoon round itself 
inside, in the shape 
of a Httle boat. The 
moth when it comes 
out has bright green 
wings with two white 
bands on them. 

The other cater- 
pillar, which you are 
almost sure to find, 

does its work more tidily. It makes a very neat 
roll, and fastens it together with fine threads. 
Then it feeds on the inner rolls till it goes to sleep, 
and turns into a moth. If you shake an oak-tree in 
June numbers of these little moths will often fly 
out. They are called the Green Oak-moth, though 
their hind wings are browoi. They are much 
smaller than the oak-moth, whose caterpillar spins 
the boat cocoon. 

Another insect which you may find, is the grub 
of the great Stag Beetle. For this you will have to 
cut into the trunks of old trees, where the big grub 
hollows out a bed for itself under the bark. It 
stays there and feeds on the wood of the tree for 



three or four years, till it turns into the beetle. 
You remember that the woodpecker taps with his 
beak as he climbs the trees. It is grubs like these 
that he is trying to find. 

But the most curious homes on an oak-tree are 
the galls made by mother insects, which lay their 
eggs on some part of the tree. Every country child 




knows the red -brown rosy -cheeked oak-apple, 
which grows on the tips of the oak-twigs, and 
which many people mistake for fruit. Boys used 
to stick these in their hats on the twenty-ninth 
of May, because Charles the Second, who hid from 
his enemies in an oak-tree, came back to his throne 
on that day. 

Instead of sticking it into your caps, cut the 


oak-apple across ^vith a sharp knife. You will 
find that it is soft and spongy, and is divided into 
a number of small cells. In each of these cells 
there will be either a grub, or a cocoon, or a perfect 
fly ready to come out. Or perhaps the home may 
be empty, all the inmates having flown away. 

Let us see how this oak-apple came to be there. 
Early in the spring a small wasp-fly, called a 
Cynips, settled on the twig, and pierced the bark 
^vith a sharp-pointed tube. She carries this tube 
coiled up at the end of her body, till she wants to 
use it. Then she darts it out into the twig and 
squeezes some juice into the hole, together with 
several eggs. 

In a very short time a swelling rises up, and the 
spongy oak-aj)ple grows round the eggs, each one 
being in a cell by itself. So when the grubs are 
hatched they find plenty of soft food to eat, till 
they spin their cocoons. 

Another of these flies lays its eggs on the loose 
catkins. You may easily find them hanging like 
little brown currants on the stalk (3, p. 39), after the 
flowers have withered. For though the stalk falls 
off as a rule, yet when these galls ai-e on it, it 
remains hanging till the fly comes out. 

These "currant galls" have each one grub in 
them, and so too have the galls which you will 
find under the leaves. There are at least two 
kinds of leaf -galls. One is bright red, and is called a 
" cherry gall." The other is very small, pink, hairy, 
and flat. There are a great many of these under 
each leaf, and they are called "oak-spangles" (2, p. 39), 



The grub remains in these galls after the leaves 
have fallen, so you will be able to find them. 

The next gall (1, p. 39) I am sure you will thinV 
is a bud. It is called the " artichoke gall," and really 
begins in the oak-bud, in which the fly lays her eggs 
early in the spring. Then instead of growing into 
a twig with green leaves, the bud covers itself with 
scales, and a number of grubs are hatched inside. 

Last of all there are the big brown galls, specially 
called " oak-galls " (4, p. 39). They grow half-way 
down the twigs, and remain hanging on the tree all 
the winter, after the flies have flo^vn out. This gall 
was first seen in England about sixty years ago, in 
1840. It has spread very fast, and is hurtful to 
the trees, for it sucks out a great deal of sap. It 
is very like the galls ^vhich we get from Asia, in 
order to use the acid in them for making ink. 

Many other trees have galls on them besides 
the oak, and I advise you when you find a curious 
lump or a strange-shaped bud, unlike anything you 
expect to find on a tree, to cut it open and see if 
there is a grub inside. 

Find as many different kinds of oak-gall as you can. Find 
the leaf-rolling caterpillar's, and try to find the grub of the 
stag-beetle. 

 

As you go through the woods in spring, you 
should watch the trees when they break out into 
leaf One of the prettiest is the Beech Tree (1, plate, 
p. 36). You may know it in the middle of winter by 





its olive-grey bark, its tall, smooth trunk with a 
broad crown of branches on the top, and its brown 



sharp-pointed buds which grow one after the other, 
now on one side, now on the other of the stem. 
How different thev are from the thick buds of the 




horse-chestnut, and yet they keep the Kttle leaves 
inside quite as safe and warm. 

Pick one of them to pieces in the early spring, 
just before they burst open (see p. 41). You will find, 
first, a number of shiny brown scales folded tight one 
over the other. Then inside these, some transparent 
scales as soft as silk, wrapping round the delicate 
tiny leaves which are folded up like a fan, and have 
a fringe of silvery hairs on them. Lastly, in the 
middle, the tender growing tip lies safely hidden. 

A few days later these bright green leaves will 
open, and the scales hang loosely below them, 
while the silken fringe now shows as hairs 
under the leaves. Each leaf is oval and notched 
at the edge, and the twigs on which they grow 
drooj) at first, and then slowly raise themselves. 
By the time the leaves are full grown the brown 
clusters of flowers are hanging among them. 

Those with the stamens in them are soft and 
silky, and hang on long, thin stalks ; but those 
with the seed-boxes, stand up on short stalks near 
the end of the twigs. There are two or three of 
them on each stalk, with their sticky horns stand- 
ing up, and a number of prickly scales round them. 

These scales are like those we saw round the 
acorn. They grow into a hard husk covered with 
prickles, and by-and-by quite shut in the two or 
three little nuts. But when autumn comes, the 
"beech-mast" (2, p. 36), as it is called, falls dowTi, 
the husk bursts open into four pieces, and then 
you see inside the three-cornered nuts with the 
withered horns still on the top. 





Now, why do you think these scales grow into 
such a hard husk and shut in the fruit, and why 
do they burst in the autumn? Because the squir- 
rels and field-mice feed chiefly on beech-nuts, and 
if there were no husk to pro- 
tect the nuts while they are 
green, they would be eaten 
before they were ripe. But 
now the husk falls and bursts, 
just when they are ready to 
grow. The tree can spare a 
good many to be eaten, if the 
squirrels and other animals 
tread a few^ into the ground or 
bury them so that they grow. 
Beech trees spring up so well 
from seed that there is no 
need to plant them. But if 
you want to keep a beech 
wood healthy and cut it 
down for timber you must 
take care of it. The trees live 
for more than two hundred 
years, though they are ready 
to be cut down when they are 
about ninety years old. 

Good foresters cut down 
one block at a time, so that there is always some 
part of the wood getting ready for timber. In 
the part they are going to cut, they first clear 
away the other kinds of trees and the young 
stunted beeches, so as to let in the light and air. 





Then they wait for a year or two, till there 
comes a season when the beech-mast is good, and 
the seeds are strong and will grow well. This 
happens generally about every three or four 
years. Then they begin to thin out the trees for 
timber, and so to leave room for young seedlings to 
grow up and begin a new crop. 

After this they go on cutting down some every 
year, and clear that piece of the wood in about ten 
years or more. By that time the new beech-trees 
have a good crown of branches and leaves on the 
top and go on and grow, while the forester begins 
to cut down another part of the wood. 

If the beech-tree is pretty in spring, it is still 
more lovely in the autumn, when its leaves turn a 
bright red, and by-and-by fall and make a lovely 
carpet of leaves in the wood. The young beech- 
trees keep their dead leaves on all through the 
winter, and so do beech-hedges, which are kept cut 
and not allowed to grow into trees. 

There is another tree you know well, which 
shuts up its fruit in a husk made of prickly scales. 
This is the sweet or Spanish chestnut (3, p. 36), 
which the Romans brought to our country, and 
which now grows in the woods, or is often planted 
in the avenues leading to big houses. It opens its 
leaves later than the beech, and does not bloom 
till July. Still by October the nuts are ripe, and 
the husks burst open on the ground. And when 
you pick up the nuts to take them home to roast, 
you may notice the dry remains of the flower 
making » kind of bristling fringe on their points 




(4, p. 36). Quite late in the autumn the chestnut is 
a lovely tree. Its long narrow leaves, cut in sharp 
points at the edge turn a beautiful golden brown 
and hang on a long time. 

Many beams of old houses are made of chestnut, 
and the trunks of the young trees are made into 
hop-poles. Beech-wood is used very largely for 
making chairs. 

The Birch and the Alder are both trees with 
catkins and hard-shelled fruits like the beech and 
the oak. They flower in the early spring before 
the leaves are fully out. The alder grows near 
streams or on wet ground. The birch you will find 
in the woods, and know it by its slender, graceful 
trunk, marked with brown, yellow and silvery 
streaks, its purple-brown twigs, and its dark green 
leaves — these smell very strong after rain, because 
the resin oozes from them. Some diseased birches 
have large tufts of twigs growing on the upper 
branches, looking like crows' nests. 

Bring, in spring, a beech branch with its buds. Bring, in 
autumn, beech-nuts and chestnuts in their husks. Compare a 
chestnut, which is a fruit, with a horse chestnut, which is a 
seed. Find Birch and Alder fruits. 

 
Pines, firs, and larches grow in almost all parts oi 
England. They are very interesting and useful 
trees. They all form their seeds in woody cones, 
and their leaves are very narrow or needle-shapedj 
quite unlike the leaves of most other trees. 





A large part of the timber we use comes from 
pines and firs, grown in Norway and other countries. 
It is called pine-wood and deal. No doubt you 
have noticed the small round jjieces called " knots " 
in deal, and have poked them out, leaving a hole. 
These are places where branches grew and broke 
off, and then the trunk closed round them ; they 
are common in deal and pinewood. The sap in 
these trees is very resinous and they are tapped 
for turpentine. If you walk in a pine wood, or 
crush the leaves of a pine or fir, you will notice 
the strong scent of this resinous juice. 

Every country child has picked up fir cones, and 
you may easily find three different kinds, those 
belonging to the Scotch pine, the Spruce fir, and the 
Larch. Of these three, only the Scotch pine is a 
native of Great Britain, the other two have been 
brought from abroad. 

There were once dense forests of Scotch pine in 
England, but these have been cut down long ago, 
and the pine woods we have now, have grown up 
fron\ the seeds of trees brought from the great 
forests in Scotland, Norway, and France. It is a tall 
tree with spreading branches and a trunk covered 
with a red or brown scaly bark. Perhaps you know 
it as Scotch fir, for people confuse these two names, 
and call the same tree " j)ine " or " fir," though you 
may know the difference if you look at the cones. 

The dark-green leaves of the Scotch pine are 
very narrow, and about two inches long (see col- 
oured plate). They grow hco together in a sheath 
of brown scales. Its cones have no stalks, and 



 

they bulge out at the bottom, and taper away to a 
blunt point at the vipper end. They are made of a 
number of thick woody scales which look as if they 
were folded back at the top, making a solid thick 
knob with a brown scaly spot where the tip ends 
{see p. 45). These scales fit over each other so 
tightly that, before the cone is ripe, not even a 
drop of rain can get in, and they take two or three 
years to ripen. Sometimes they hang all the time 
on the tree. Sometimes they fall off earlier. As 
they ripen, the woody scales bend outwards and 
you can see two thin, transparent scales inside 
each, which look like the wings of a fly. They 
stand upright against the woody scale. 

Shp a knife carefully down under these, right 
to the bottom and pull them out. You will find 
a seed at the end of each, if you have not broken 
the tender transparent membrane. 

For these are "winged seeds, which have no 
seed-box over them, but grow naked inside the 
woody scale. After a time they fall out and are 
blown away by the wind. If you get a cone that 
is too old they will be gone. 

kW trees with cones have these winged seeds, 
and the cones of true pines are very much alike. 
You will easily know the Cluster pine, which has 
been brought from France and is found in many 
English woods among the Scotch j)ines. Its large 
cones grow in clusters roand the branches, four or 
sometimes eight together. They are larger and 
browner than the cones Of the Scotch pine and 
they often remain a great many years on the tree. 







The Spruce fir (2, p. 45) is very different from 
the Scotch pm^?. Its spreading branches grow 
nearly down to the ground, and its needle-shaped 
leaves, which are barely an inch long grow singly 
on the stem. Its cones are long and narrow and 
the scales are not so thick as in pines. But 
the chief difference is that the 
tips are not bent back 
into knobs, they are 
polluted and 
bend in a little, 
and by this 

you may 
know fir- 
cones from 
pine-cones. 
The firs have two 
seeds inside each scale 
like the pine, but these 
ripen in one year. The 
spruce fir came from Nor- 
LARCH TWIG BEARING CONES, way, aud uow grows all 

over England 
The Larch, which came from Switzerland, and 
the Cedar, which came from Lebanon in Palestine, 
both grow their seeds in cones, but they are rather 
different from the pines and firs. Their needle- 
leaves are very thin and grow in tuffs eighteen 
or twenty together in the same sheath of scales. 
The cones cf the cedar stand upright and are 
shaped like an egg, but the tree does not often 
bear cones in England. 






Larch cones are quite small, not more than an 
inch in length ; they grow along the twigs in a row. 
The woody scales do not fit very tightly together. 

I think you 
can find the cones 
of all these trees 
except the cedar. 
Of course you 
must look for fir 
and larch cones 
in the autumn, 
because they 
ripen each year, 
but pine-cones 
are on the trees 
all the year 
round. If you 
look at any of 
these trees in the 
spring and early 
summer, you will see their 
stamen - catkins hanging 
from the branches, and 
the yellow pollen blowing 
about in clouds so as to 
tall on the young cones. 

'Pines, firs, and cedars are evergreen trees. Their 
leaves remain on the tree three years or more; 
and as the branches are not of the same age, the 
leaves fall ofP in difPerent years, so that the trees 
are always green. But the larch sheds its leaves 
every year, and you may easily know it in the 




autumn by its bare drooping boughs covered with 
small brown cones. 

Pines and firs will flourish in very poor soil and 
their seeds grow up easily. If you are near a pine 
wood, or a wood of mixed trees with pines or firs 
in it, try and find a seedling tree. It is curious to 
look at, for it shoots up with a long, thin stalk, and 
carries up the seed-coat with it. When this coat 
falls off, you see five or six long seed-leaves under- 
neath, and in the middle of them a bud with the 
real pine or fir leaves. 

There is another tree which you know well, 
which has needle-shaped leaves. They grow all 
round the stem, two together in each sheath, but 
they are flattened down on two sides of the stem 
like the featherlets of a feather. This is the Yew 
tree (see p. 49), which you find so often in church- 
yards. It does not bear cones. Its naked seeds sit 
each one in a red juicy cup. The stamen-catkins 
are not on the same tree as the red cups, but if you 
search well you will find them on another yew tree. 

Bring in a bunch of the Scotch pine and the Spruce fir. 
Compare the cones of the two trees. Try to find a branch 
of Cedar, a branch of the Larch with cones, a seedling pine or 
fir, a branch of Yew with stamen flowers in March, and another 
with the red cup and naked seed in the autumn. 


There is no country in tlie world where the hedge- 
rows are so beautiful as in England. Whether we 
look at the neatly trimmed hedges round our 




gardens, or the roughly trimmed fences between 
the fields, they each have their beauty. Perhaps 
the most delightful of all, to look at, are the hedges 
which are not cut more than once in six years. 
But these are not good for the fields. 

Let us look first at the garden hedges. Have you 
ever thought that these are all made of young trees, 
clipped so that they remain only branches and 
leaves, and do not grow tall trunks? A box hedge 
is made of box trees closely cut. The holly hedge, 
whose prickly leaves are so useful in preventing the 
cattle from breaking through, would grow into tall 
trees if left alone. I know a garden in Devonshire 
where there are holly trees thirty feet high, growing 
here and there in a holly hedge. 

The hawthorn fence is the same as the May-tree 
which grows on the lawn. The beech hedge is made 
of beech trees, kept well clipped, and the dead leaves 
hang on it in winter, as they do on young beeches. 
The yew hedge is the same as the big yew tree in 
the churchyard, and it is well to be careful how you 
plant it anyAvhere near cattle and horses, for in a 
hard winter they sometimes eat the poisonous leaves 
and die. 

But each of these hedges is made of only one 
kind of tree. They are not nearly so interesting as 
the mixed hedges which grow between the fields. 
There we find blackberries and nuts and all sorts of 
curious fruits and flowers. 

Do you know the Blackthorn bush, whose small 
white flowers grow on its black stem, almost before 
winter is over, and while it has no leaves ? If you 




do, 1 expect you know that you vnW. find purple sloes 
on it in the autumn, under its small dark-green 
leaves, and you can gather the fruit to make sloe 
syrup or sloe wine. The blackthorn is not a good 
hedge plant, for its roots wander far out into the 
field, and it often grows into a tree and so leaves a 
gap in the fence. 

The Hawthorn or May is much better, for it 
grows into a thick quickset hedge, if it is properly 
cut, and the cattle do not break through it, because 
of its thorns. But you cannot use the fruit of the 
hawthorn, you must leave the haws for the birds. 

Then, in the hedge, or the wood, you will most 
likely find the Crab-apple tree, with its spreading 
branches, often covered with thorns. It has oval 
leaves ^vith sharp points, which are dowaiy under- 
neath when they are young. Its rosy pink-and- 
white blossoms come out in May, and in the autumn 
you will find the red crab-apple in their place. This 
fruit is sour and bitter. 

Another hedgerow treo is tlie W ild Cherry, ^wdiose 
fruit feeds the birds in the summer, and helps to 
keep them away from the corn. It is a bushy shrub 
with a red bark and blue-green egg-shaped leaves, 
very much notched round the edge. Its flowers 
grow on short stalks four or five from one point 
like our garden cherries, and the fruit, when it is 
ripe, is a bright red. If you live in Wales, or the 
middle or north of England, you may find another 
tree called the Bird-cherry (1, p. 56), whose fiowers 
grow along a thin stalk, and its fi-uit is black. 
But be sure you find the right one with long, 




drooping flower clusters, for many people call the 
wild dwarf cherry by this name. 

The blackthorn, hawthorn, crab-apple, and cherry 
all belong to the rose family, which, j^ou remember, 
has so many fruit-bearing plants in it. So does 
the pretty Rowan tree (plate, p. 51), often called the 
Mountain Ash, because its leaves are cut into leaf- 
lets ver3^ like those of the ash-tree. You will find the 
small white flowers of the Rowan tree (see l,p. 51) open 
in May. But you will like it best in autvimn Avhen the 
clusters of beautiful red berries are ripe. Perhaps 
you have one over your gate, for they were often 
planted there when people believed in witches, as 
they were supposed to keep them away. 

I must find room to tell you of two more hedge- 
1 ow shrubs. One is the Guelder Rose (2, p. 56), which 
has dark-green leaves cut into three or five points 
with a jagged edge. These leaves turn a lovely red 
in the autumn. Its white flowers grow in a flat 
cluster. The outer ones are large and have neither 
stamens nor seed-box in them. Their use is to 
attract the bees and flies, which come to the smaller 
flowers in the middle to fetch honey. These middle 
flowers are perfect and so the insects help them to 
form seed. The guelder rose has beautiful coral- 
red berries in the autumn. 

The other bush, which grows about five feet high 
in the hedge, is called the Spindle tree (2, p. 51), 
because its wood is used for making spindles and 
skewers. It has a smooth, grey stem and narrow, 
green leaves, which are very poisonous. You wiH 
scarcely notice j<^s small green-wbUc flfuvcrs in Ma 





But in the autumn it has a lovely and curious fruit. 
Four red seed-boxes gro^sv together in a clump on 
a short stalk. They lock very quaint, and if you 








open them you will find that the seed inside is 
covered with a blight orange-coloured membrane. 

Find the flowers and fruit of the hlackthorn, may, apple 
and wild cherry, rowan tree, guelder rose- and spindle tree. 




There is not room to grow large trees in a 
cottage garden, but many flowering shrubs can 
be planted in corners, and some of them are very 
lovely. The first to bloom in the year is the Japan 
pear, JPyrus japonica (plate, p. 61). It grows on 
many cottage walls, and makes them bright when 
the trees are bare of leaves. Its deep-red buds are 
showing even in January, and by the end of Feb- 
ruary the w'all is covered with them. They are like 
pear blossoms in shape, and grow in little bunches 
close against the stem. If you have not got one 
you will easily find a sucker, growing out from 
some neighbour's plant, and it is not difficult to rear. 
In the autumn you will see its hard, green fruit. 

Soon after the Japan pear is in full bloom 
the Rihes, or "flowering currant," will be showing 
its red tassels in most gardens. It was first brought 
from North America, and has spread all over Eng- 
land. You will easily know it, because its leaves 
are very like those of the currant-bushes in the 
kitchen garden, and its pretty hanging clusters 
of red or pink flowers are shaped like the little 
green blossoms of our currants and gooseberries 
Then in the autumn it has hanging bunches of 
dark berries, which are not good to eat. A piece 
of Ribes cut oft" and stuck in the ground will grow 
without any trouble. 

Another very pretty bush flowers in early summer. 






This is the Barberry, whose small scarlet fruits 
used at one time to be put inside sugar plums. 
The barberry is an interesting shrub, for it has 
turned some of its leaves into thorns, so that at 
each joint there is a three-pronged thorn, as well 
as the smooth, fringed leaves. The wild 
barberry has yellow flowers 
with bright red anthers, but 
there is a garden kind with 
ever-green leaves, 
which has deep 
orange-coloured 
flowers. They are 







small and 
, hang in a 
long spray, 
and if you are 
clever you can 
?A try an experiment 
with either the wild 
or garden barberry. 
Look carefully at one of the flowers and you 
will see that the six stamens are spread out, one 
lying down vipon each petal. At the bottom of 
the petal, near the middle of the flower, are two 
bags, out of which oozes honey in drops. The 
sticky stigma on the top of the seed-box stands 
up in the middle of the flower. 




Now take a needle and touch one of the stamens 
fit its base, just where the honey drops are. It will 
jump up, as if moved by a spring, and touch the 
sticky stigma, then after a Httle "vvhile it ^vill fall 
doTV n again. Now when a bee puts her head in for 
honey she irritates the stamen so that it jumps up 
and hits her and she carries the pollen-dust to 
another flower. Or the anther leaves some pollen 
on its own stigma, before it falls down again. 

But we must go on, for when the " March winds 
and April showers bring forth May flowers " there 
will be plenty of shrubs to look at. There is the 
Spanish Broom, with its bright yellow blossoms 
shaped like a pea-flower. You can find wild 
broom growing on the heaths. It is very like 
gorse, only it has smooth, green stems, and no 
prickles. But in the wild broom the blossoms 
grow^ singly on the stem, while in Spanish broom 
they form bright yellow clusters. The broom has 
no honey, but the bees come to it for pollen-dust to 
make bee-bread. 

If there is a Lilac bush growing near the broom 
you will notice how lovely the two colours, yellow 
and lilac, look together. You can make a very 
pretty nosegay from the two shrubs. But you 
will make a more graceful one, if you can find 
a Laburnum with its long sprays of golden blos- 
som. The laburnum has plenty of honey in its 
flowers, and, as the bees have to gnaw a lump to 
get at it, they often stop a long time at each 
flower, and you may see many on one tree. 
Laburnum pods are like small pea-pods, but take 





care not to eat the seeds in them, for they ax"e very 
poisonons. 

Next the Rhododendrons will be opening their 
beautiful bunches of red-purple flowers among 
their glossy, green leaves. These come from 
North America. But the Elderbush, which grows 
in the corner, making a pleasant shade over a 
little seat, is a true English shrub, which almost 
deserves to be called a tree. It does not bloom 
much before July, but it is one of the first trees 
to put out its leaves in the early sj)ring. Though 
it is not tall, it has very thick stems, and its bark is 
rough and corky. 

You must take the young branches if you want 
to make pop-guns, for in the old ones the pith 
is crushed up into quite a tiny space by the rings 
of wood outside. The leaves of the elder grow 
opposite to each other on the stem, and each leaf 
is cut into seven or nine leaflets, with one at the 
end. The small w^hite flowers grow in very large 
flat clusters, and leave the sweet elder -berries 
behind them in the autunni. 

If you have not an elder tree in the garden, you 
will very likely have a Snowball tree (see plate). 
This is a garden kind of Guelder rose. Its blossoms 
are not in a flat bunch as they are on the wild tree. 
They grow in a ball and they have no stamens or 
seedbox in them, so they make no seeds. But the 
leaves turn purple in the autumn and are very lovely. 

By this time the big purple Clematis will be 
out over the porch. It will last in bloom till 
October, and behind it on tl^e wall grows the 





Myrtle, which will be covered with white flowers 
in August. We all know the myrtle so well that 
it is difficult to believe that it is not a British 
shrub. It came from the south of France, and 
now grows in all warm parts of England, keeping 
our walls green all the year round. Its oval 
leaves give a delightful scent from the little pockets 
of oil, which you may see if you look through the 
leaf at the light. 


Next to the oak, the two hardwood trees which are 
most useful are the ash and the elm. Both these 
trees grow in the hedgerows as well as in the open 
fields, and they both blossom quite early in the 
year, before they put forth their leaves. 

You may know Ash stems anywhere, even in 
winter, by two things. First by the tips of its 
branches, which are flat, as if they had been pressed 
under a weight. And secondly by its black buds 
shaped like little pyramids (see p. 65). No other 
tree has black buds like these. The trunk is an 
ash-grey colour, and the branches grow very grace- 
fully, first di[)ping do^vn from the boughs and then 
tilting up again like the horns of a deer. 

In April the ash-buds on the side branches near 
to the tip begin to open out into clusters of purple- 
black flowers (2). Each flower is very small. It has 
no flower-leaves, nothing but a seed-box and two 




purple stamens. But these tiny flowers are so closely 
crowded that the whole tree is coloured by them. 

Then, at the end of May, the leaf -buds begin to 
open. The leaves grow opposite to each other on 
the branches, and each leaf (1) is cut into seven or 
more leaflets, with an odd one at the end. Many 
leaves are cut up like this, and you might think 
each leaflet was a leaf. But if they were leaves, a 
bud would grow at the base of each, near the stem, 
and there would be a growing tip at the end. So 
when there are neither of these you may know 
that all the leaflets make up one leaf ; and when it 
fades, the whole falls off together. 

All through the summer the tree is very beauti- 
ful, and its bluish-grey leaves differ from those of 
any other tree. But early in the autumn they turn 
yellow and fall. Then you will know the tree by its 
curious long, flat, narrow fruits (3), which hang in 
groups from the branches like bunches of keys. In 
fact, they are called " keys." They hang on some- 
times quite into the winter, till the rough winds 
tear them off. 

You may often find a young ash-tree growing in 
your garden, for they are very hardy. But rabbits 
are fond of eating the young seedlings, so they have 
not much chance to grow. Young ash stems are 
often used for walking-sticks and hop-poles, and the 
wood, when full-grown, sells very well for coach- 
building and for making furniture. 

We all know Elm-trees so well that perhaps you 
may think that there is nothing interesting to learn 
about them. But I wonder if you have noticed that 





the twigs of an elm grow on the trunk almost to the 
bottom of the tree unless they are lopped o£P. And 
I am almost sure that many of you do not know that 






the twigs are often covered with little lumps of cork 
making the branch look as if it were diseased. 

It is really quite healthy, but it tells a secret, 







namely, that the elm has a very corky bark. Even 
on the trunk the cork is thick and rugged, and on 
the small branches it has no room to spread, and 
has to lie in lumps. The inner part of the bark 
called the "liber" is very tough, and is used for 

making mats and 
ropes. 

The common 
elm, which so often 
grows in rows be- 
tween the fields, or 
is planted on the 
village green, was 
brought to England 
by the Romans. It is not quite 
at home even now, for its seeds do 
not ripen, except in very hot 
summers, and new trees have to 
be planted from suckers. 

The real old elm of England is 

the Wych elm or Scotch elm. It 

has not such a tall trunk as the 

common elm, for its big branches 

grow out much lower do^vn. Its 

leaves are bigger, and its seeds ripen 

and grow, when they are sown. But 

it is not very common in our country and grows 

chiefly in Scotland, Wales, and the West of 

England. 

Even ill winter you can count a great number 
of buds on the elm, and when April comes, if you 
look up through the boughs, ycu will see a purple 








tinge all over the top of the ti'ee. This is caused by 
the t\ny purple flowers which burst out on the 
twigs. Now watch the tree. At the end of April 

. 

the fresh green lea\-es peep out of the leaf-buds. 
But already the seed-boxes are begiiniing to fall and 
are blown into heaps by the wind. 




I am sure you must kno^v^ these little, flat, green 
plates, with a lump in the middle where the seed 
lies. They are blown along the fields, and often 
down the village street, filling the gutters. If they 
fall from the Common elm it is very doubtful 
whether they will grow. But if you have a Wych 
elm on the green, you may know its seed-boxes, be- 
cause the seed ai\\^ays lies quite in the middle of 
the plate, while in the common elm it lies nearer 
the point. These seeds are ripe and worth sowing. 

There are a great many kinds of elm in England, 
very like each other, but it is easy to know the 
Cornish elm because it grows such a great deal of 
cork on its twigs. All the big forest elms are very 
useful for timber. They sometimes live for four or 
five hundred years, but the best time for cutting 
them down is when they are about one hundred 
and twenty years old. 

A great many insects feed on the elm. The most 
destructive one is a beetle which eats its way down 
to the inner bark, and sucks the sap. Then the 
mother beetle works her way down about two 
inches and makes little galleries all along the tube 
on each side. In each gallery she lays an egg, and 
the grubs when they are hatched eat the wood. The 
trees of whole forests have been killed by this "elm- 
destroying beetle," 

Bring an ash branch to look at the twigs and buds. Find 
a, bunch of ash-keys. Find the corky twigs of the ehn, and the 
green seed-plates in May. Look in decayed elms for the gal« 
leries of the elm-destroying beetle. 




In our great parks you will find the largest 
and grandest English trees, besides many which 
are interesting because they come from abroad. 
Avenues, of a mile or two miles long, are often 
planted with one kind of tree, chestnut, beech, 
oak, horse-chestnut, or lime, while in the open 
ground the oaks and horse-chestnuts grow into 
much finer trees than in the fields. 

We have not yet spoken of the Lime-tree, but 
you know it quite well, with its straight, smooth 
trunk, its bright, heart-shaped green leaves, bigger 
on one side than the other, and pointed at the 
tip, and its bunches ol yellowish green flowers, 
which grow on a long stalk coming out of the 
middle of a yellow-green leaf (2, p. 71). 

Get some of these flowers in July, or some 
of the round, downy fruit with ribs on it in the 
autumn when it is ripe. The leaf out of which 
they grow is called a bract, and is the same kind 
of leaf as the scales on which the willow stamens, 
and the pine seeds grow. But in the Lime it has 
become a long leaf which can be carried by the 
wind. The inner bark or "liber" of the lime tree 
is very useful in making ropes, and of all trees the 
bees love this one, for the flowers have a sweet 
scent and plenty of honey in their cups. 

There is another tree which is ahnost as useful 





to the bees, which blooms rather earlier than the 
lime. This is the Sycamore, ^vhose clusters of 
green flowers hang from the twigs in May, before 
the leaves are quite out. The sycamore is a very 
handsome tree with large leaves cut into five 
broad divisions. It is really a kind of maple, very 
like the common English field maple which grows 
in the hedges. If you stand under a sycamore in 
warm weather you will often notice that drops 
fall from it, and you will find that its leaves are 
sticky. This is because all maples have a great 
deal of very sugary juice or sap in them, which 
rises up and oozes out of the leaves, either from 
cracks made by the leaf being dry, or because some 
insect has , bitten a hole. You must have seen 
the little green blight-insects which cling on rose 
trees and other plants, and suck out their juice. 
Hundreds and thousands of these, besides other 
bugs (such as the cuckoo-spit, "which you find 
covered with froth), suck the sap of trees. So 
through the cracks they have made the sugary 
juice of the sycamore or the maple oozes out 
over the leaves. 

The fruit of these trees is very curious. It is 
winged like the keys of the ash, but two fruits 
grow together, so that the two wings spread out 
like those of a moth (see p. 73). The wings of the 
Field Maple fruit are spread more widely than 
those of the sycamore. 

Maple wood is very useful for furniture. A 
great many of our desks and wardrobes are 
made from American maple. Maple sugar, which 










American children love, conies from the sugary 
sap of an American species. 

Another tree which you will find in the park 
is the Walnut, which was brought to England by 
the Romans. It is a large, 
spreading tree with a rough 
trunk and strong, crooked 
branches. Its leaves are cut 
like those 

of the ash, > 

but they 
are much 
larger. They 
h a V e a 
pretty red 
tinge when 
they are 
young, and 
always have 
a strong 
smell when 
they are 
crushed. 

These trees grow so quickly that 
they are twenty feet high in ten years, (^, 
and then begin to flower and make sycamoiu; twig 
fruit. They go on growing till they ^^'^th ns fruit 
are about seventy feet high. You 
can see the long catkins hanging from the tree in 
April just as the leaves are opening. The stamen 
catkins are at the tip of last year's tAvigs. But 
the little grouj) of flowers which will grow into 





walnuts are on the new twigs, which have just come 
from buds. In autumn every boy knows the 
walnut fruit shut up in the green husk, Avhich 
stains your fingers brown as you peel it off. When 
the husk is off you can slip a knife between the 
halves of the hard shell and split them aj)art. In 
doing this you divide the two seed-leaves of the 
seed, which are the parts you eat ; and if you look 
carefully you will see the little white bud and 
root, lying bet^veen them, at the pointed end of the 
walnut. Walnut wood is very useful for furni- 
ture, for it becomes a deep brown when the tree 
is old, and has very beautiful veins in it. 

There is one more tree or shrub w^hicli grows 
only in parks and shrubberies, about which I must 
tell you, because it is so pretty. But I am not 
sure you will be able to find one. It is the Arbutus, 
or Strawberry tree (plate, p. 71) so called because its 
fruits look like strawberries. It is an evergreen 
shrub with green, glossy leaves shaped like a bay leaf 
and very notched at the edge. Its flowers are bell- 
shaped and waxy like the flowers of the heath, and 
they hang on bent stalks. But the curious thing 
about them is, that the fruits take a year to ripen. 
First they are a pale yellow, then they grow deeper 
and deeper in colour till they are a bright scarlet, 
hanging in twos and threes among the dark-green 
leaves, just when the tree blooms afresh Avith its 
pretty, greenish-white flowers. 

Other trees which you may find in the park are 
the Chili pine, or monkey-puzzle, a tree which bears 
cones and has such prickly leaves close together. 





that it would indeed puzzle a monkey to climb it, 
and the large magnolias and tulip-trees which have 
such beautiful white and pinkish flowers as large 
as bowls. But these are foreigners and w^e must 
be content wdth knowing about English-growing 
trees. 

Find the flowers and fruit of the lime tree ; the leaves of the 
sycamore sticky with honey-dew ; the winged seeds of the 
maple and the sycamore ; the leaves and catkins of the walnut 
tree. Open a walnut and find the young shoot inside. 



In the summer when the trees are in full leaf, and 
you have learnt to know" them, you should bring 
in leafy twigs from each tree and note how the 
leaves grow on the stem, and what shapes they 
have. 

We have already noticed that some trees, such 
as the horse-chestnut and the maple, have their 
leaves opposite to each other on the stem, two 
growing on each joint, Avhile others, such as the elm 
and the beech for example, have their leaves 
alternate, one only growing from each joint. But 
there are many kinds of alternate leaves, and you 
mil enjoy finding them out. 

In the elm and the beech every other leaf comes 
exactly above the one below. Leaf 1 comes on one 
side of the stem, leaf 2 on the other side, leaf 3 
exactly above leaf 1. But if you take a twig of the 




trembling poplar, or Aspen, it ^vill be leaf 4 which 
conies above leaf 1. They have crept more slowly 
round the stem. Then take a twig of oak. You 
will find that you will have to count six leaves 
before you find one exactly over the first one. All 
these differences have their use, and when you are 
in the lanes, if you look at the trees, you will see 
how these arrangements bring the leaves into posi- 
tions where they can best get light and air. 

The next thing to look at is the shape of the 
leaves themselves. Botanists have a great many 
names to describe the shapes, the edges, the veins, 
and the divisions of leaves. I can only tell you of a 
few, so that you may keep your eyes open and 
notice others. 

Leaves which are whole, so that you cannot pull 
off one i3iece without tearing it away from the rest, 
are called simple. The leaves of the elm, beech, 
sweet-chestnut, lime, oak, "willow, sycamore, and 
many others are simple. 

Leaves which are cut into separate leaflets, so 
that you can pull one off without touching the 
others, are called co7tipou7id. The leaves of the 
horse-chestnut, ash, rose, rowan-tree, and elder are 
co7npound. You will remember that you know the 
divisions are leaflets and not leaves, because there 
is no growing tip at the end, and there are no buds 
in the angles. The leaflets grow out from the top 
of the leaf stalk (horse-chestnut), or from the 
narrow, green line, up the middle (rose), which is 
not a stalk, but the niidrib of the leaf. 

Now take all the simple leaves you have and see 





what sIlapo$ they are. The hest way to find out 
this is to lay a leaf on your slate and draw a line 
round it. This is very easy Avith a beech leaf, or the 
leaf of a sweet- chestnut. But when you take art 
oak leaf, you will want to know whether you are to 
rvm in and out of the divisions. 

For the shape of a leaf you are not to do this. 










You are to begin at the leaf stalk and run round the 
outside points of the leaf all the way till you come 
back to the leaf stalk again. If you go round a 
maple leaf Kke this you will have a shape something 
hke a kidnerj. A sycamore leaf will be more heart- 
shaped, longer, and ending in a bhnit tip. An oak 
leaf will be oblong, longer than it is broad. The 




leaf of an elm or a beech you will find is shaped 
like an egg, and so is called oval, while the leaf of 
l;he sweet-chestnut is narrow and long. Lastly, if 
you take a lime leaf it will be heart-shaped, but 
uneven, one side of the leaf larger than the other. 
It is called oblique. 

Now let us see how much the different leaves 
are cut. Some, like those of the lilac and ivy, are 
smooth at the edge. Others are wavy, and the holly 
has prickles at the end of its waves to protect it. 
But, if you look at holly leaves near the top of a 
tree where the cattle cannot reach, you w^ill often 
find they do not take the trouble to grow prickles. 

Other leaves have teeth round the edge. The 
leaf of the sweet-chestnut is toothed like a saw. So 
is a birch leaf, but if you look closely you will find 
it has two sets of teeth. The large teeth have their 
edges cut into small teeth. This leaf has a double- 
sawed edge. Some leaves again are very deeply cut 
into divisions or lobes. An oak leaf is cut, sometimes 
only in a wavy line, and sometimes into quite large 
divisions. A sycamore leaf has five large pointed 
divisions or lobes. 

Get these two leaves and compare them. You 
will see that the veins which make the skeleton of 
the different shapes are not the same. In the syca- 
more leaf the large veins, or ribs, start from the 
top of the stalk, and spread out like five fingers, 
while the little veins start out from them. A leaf 
like this is called a palm-veined or palmate-veined 
leaf because the veins are like fingers on a hand. 
In the oak leaf, on the contrary, one long rib runs 




up the middle. The smaller ones start from it, like 
the featherlets of a bird's feather. So an oak leaf is 
said to be feather-veined or pinnate-veined, from 
pi7ina, a feather. 

Now take the compound leaves of the horse- 
chestnut, ash, and rose. In the horse-chestnut the 
leaflets grow just like the veins of the sycamore. 
Seven fingers start from the top of the leaf stalk 
and spread out like fingers, so it is called a pahnate 
leaf. But the ash and the rose have a rib up the 
middle and the separate leaflets are arranged 
feather-wise. So these leaves are called pinnate. 

There are a great many leaves with shapes 
between these, and if you collect them and arrange 
them in an old copy book, you will soon get an 
idea of the meaning of their names. 

Describe the leaves of the oak, horse-chestnut, and elm and 
their position on the stem. Arrange any simple leaves and 
compound leaves you can find in a copy book and describe 
them. 



It is a lovely svinimer morning. Let us shut up 
our books and wander in the garden and field, in 
search of insects. The best way is to take a few 
card match-boxes with us, and drop one insect into 
each as we find them. Then when we get back to 
school, we can put them separately under tumblers, 

Insects are so small that we often pass them by. 
But they form three-fourths of the whole animal 
kingdom, and they do us so much good and so 
much harm that we ought to know about them. 

As we start I see a Cabbage Butterfly in the 
kitchen garden, and a beautiful Red Admiral 
flitting about among the flowers. We will takt 
the Cabbage Butterfly, so that she may not lay 
her eggs on our cabbages. 

Next stop at this rose-tree, there are a number 
of tiny insects on the flower-stalks. If you look 
closely, you will see that each one has his beak 
buried in the stem, so as to suck out the juice. 
These are Dlant-lice, Each one is called an Aphis 



We must syringe the tree with soft soap and 
tobacco water, or it will soon be covered Tvith 
xhese insects, for they increase at the rate of more 
than a million in a month, and they suck out all 
the sweet sap from the plants to which they cling. 
On the same tree you ^11 very likely find a Lady- 
bird, for she feeds on ajjliides. 

Now look into the flower of this old Cabbage 
Rose, which grows in most cottage gardens. You 
are almost sure to find in it a lovely Rose-beetle 
with green shining wings shot Tvith gold. Take 
it up and look at the bright wing-cases. While 
you are looking, it may open these cases and 
spread out the transparent ^vings underneath ; but 
if it flies away you can easily get another. 

Now, look ! At your feet runs a beetle which is 
not half so pretty. It is the Cocktail, or Rove 
Beetle (see p. 36), often called the Devil's Coach- 
horse. As you pick him up he will cock up his tail 
and squirt out a very disagreeable fluid over your 
fingers, while he raises his head and snaps with his 
jaws. So drop him in his box quickly. The fact 
is, he is terribly frightened, and hopes to make 
you set him free. 

Now we will go out into the newly-mown field, 
and there you will see a number of small green 
Grasshoppers hopping about. They have been 
hatched under the earth-clods, and are eating 
the tips of the young grass. Some will have 
wings, but others, which are not fully grown, 




I have not asked 
for a Spider. You 
had better get one, 
and also a Hun dred- 
legs or Centipede, 
if you can find 
it. 

When you hav^ 
put these specimens 
under their glasses, 
look carefully at 
them. You will 
find a difference 
between the spider, 



will have none. 

Pick one up and 

make him too a 

prisoner. 

Next try to find a 

Wasp or a Bee. You 

can pick it up in your 

handkerchief and drop 

it in its box. We must 

go down to the river to 

find a May - fly or a 

Dragon - fly, and near 

there w^e shall easily get 

a Daddy-long-legs. But 

if there is not one to be 

seen, a Blue-bottle or a 

Gnat will do. 

You will wonder that 




the hundred-legs and all the others. The spider 
has eight legs and the centii)ede a very great 
many, while all the others have only six. 

Now look at the Grasshopper, the Wasp, and 
the Daddy-long-legs. You can see very clearly 
that their bodies are divided into three parts — 
(a) the head ; (6) the front body, on which the six 
legs and the wings grow ; (c) the hind body, which 
has no legs on it, even when it is very long, as in 
the daddy-long-legs and the May-fly. You cannot 
see these divisions quite so well in the beetle be- 
cause its wing-cases cover the join between the 
front and hind body. 

Wo had better call these three divisions by 
their light names — (a) head; (b) front body, or 
thorax; (c) hind body, or abdomen. It is because 
insects are cut into these three parts that they 
have their name. It conies from the Latin " inseco" 
(/ cut into). The Spider's head is not clearly divided 
from i<s body, and a Centipede has not three 
divisions. For this reason, and because they have 
not six legs, some naturalists separate them from 
the true insects. This is why I did not call them 
insects 

Another thing you can notice well in the little 
green Grasshopper : his body is divided into rings 
(r), from his tail up to his head ; and you can 
see the same i^ the wasp and the daddy-long-legs, 
the aphis and tiie cocktail beetle. All insects 
have ringed bodies. 

It is these rings which enable the Wasp to 
bend her abdomen (c) when she wants to sting 






and to breathe. You can see, as she stands, 
how it keeps moving up and down all the time. 
This is because she is breathing. How do you 
think she does it ? Not through her mouth as 
we do, but through her sides. 

If you look closely at the grasshopper you will 
see along the sides of his body, some little black 
dots (h, p. 7), one in each ring. These are breathing 
holes, and through them the air goes in and out. 
They are smaller in a wasp, but they are there, and 
she is pumping the air in and out of them. 

NoT\^ that we have put aside the spider and 
the centipede, those that remain are true insects. 
But there is a difference between the daddy-long- 
legs and the rest, which you must notice. This 
is that they all have four wings and he has only 
two. This would be very strange if it Avere not 
that we can find some remains of the right number. 
He has two little knobs (k) behind his front wings, 
and with these he balances himself. So he has two 
wings and the stumps of two more. 

There is a great deal more to be learnt about 
these insects. But I want you to remember now 
— that they have six legs ; that their body is divided 
into three parts ; that you can see the rings in 
their hind body or abdomen ; that their legs and 
wings grow on the front body or thorax ; and that 
they never breathe through their mouths. Also 
that while bees, butterflies, and beetles have four 
wings, flies have two wings and two stumps. 

Find as many insects as you can, and notice their different 
parts. 



In the last lesson we found the full-grown insects 
very easily. But it is often more difficult to know 
some of them when they are young. Grasshoppers, 
crickets, and plant-lice, when they come out of the 
egg, are very much the same as -when they are 
grown up, except that they have no wings. But 
the daddy-long-legs begins its life as a grub under- 
ground. The lady-bird when young is a kind of 
caterpillar and runs over the plants eating plant- 
lice. And beetles are grubs with six small legs 
jefore they grow into perfect beetles with wings. 

The caterpillars of Moths and Butterflies are easy 
to find, so we will look at one in this lesson. There 
is hardly any time in the summer that you cannot 
find a caterpillar. Those of the Orange-tipped 
Butterfly come out first in April. In May the 
Cabbage Butterfly lays her eggs, and soon the 
caterpillars are eating the young cabbage leaves. 
A little later you may find among the nettles the 
black caterj)illars with white spots (2, p. 10) which 
will tvirn in June into the Peacock Butterfly; or 
the dark green caterj)illars of the Red Admiral. 
These are hidden in a bunch of leaves generally tied 
up with caterpillar silk. 

If you do not find either of these you cannot 
miss the heaps of little black caterpillars striped 
with yellow "which feed under the leaves of nettles, 
and turn into the small Tortoiseshell Butterfly. 
These caterpillars are very useful in killing nettles^ 




SO the butterfly is one you should always be glad 
to see. Then towards the autumn the caterpillars 
of the big Hawk-moths do a great deal of mischief. 
If you go out in the evening or early morning you 
may find the caterpillar of the Sjjurge Hawk-moth 
feeding on the green spurge in the hedges. It is 
a fine creature three inches 
long, with three bright 
lines on its back, and yel- 
low spots on each ring. 

But the most common 
one, which I have often 
found, is the caterpillar of 
the Privet Hawk-moth {see 
coloured picture, p. 20), 
which feeds in the evening

on the privet hedge or the 
lilac bushes. It is from 

three to four inches long, and is a bright apple- 
green, with seven sloping violet stripes on its sides, 
and a horn at the end of its body. Its head is 
green, edged with black, and the breathing holes 
on its sides are circled with bright orange. 

It destroys the hedges terribly, for it is very 
nungry and w^ants to store up food so that it 
may grow into a moth. Though its body is 
soft, its head is hard and horny, and as its mouth 
has nothing to do in breathing, or making any 
noise, it can be used all the time for eating. It 
is made of a great many pieces, but the parts 
you can see well are the large upper lip (ul) 
and the two broad strong outer jaws (j) which 




move to and fro sideways as it gnaws the leaf. As 
soon as a piece is cut off the caterpillar tucks it 
into his inner jaws (ij), where it is chewed and 
swallowed. Under the jaws is the flat lower lip 
(ZZ), through which passes a little tube. Look well 
at this tube (s). It is the place from which comes 
the silk which he uses to sj)in his cocoon, in which 
he sleeps while his butterfly body is growing. 

You remember Ave read in Book I. that the 
spider spins her web out of silk which comes from 
six little pockets under her body. But a caterpillar 
or a silkworm brings its silk out of its mouth. 

Now look at the legs. There are three pairs, 
one on each ring of the thorax. They have joints 
in them and claws at the end (2, p. 15). These are 
true legs, and they are hard and horny like the 
head. When the caterpillar turns into a moth 
these six legs will remain. But it has also some 
cushion feet {see p. 20), on the other rings of its 
body, which it uses to hold fast to the twigs. 
These are not true legs, but only fleshy cushions 
(1, p. 15) with a ring of hooks under them, and they 
will disappear with the caterpillar's body when the 
moth grows up. There are generally four pairs 
of cushion feet behind the true legs, and two 
pairs at the end of the body, but some cater- 
pillars do not have so many. Do you know hose 
called "Loopers," which bend their body ii to an 
arch or loop? You may often find them on the 
currant bushes, where they do a great deal of 
mischief They have only six true legs and four 
cushion feet at the end of their body, and they 





walk in a curious fashion. They hold firmly to 
the twig by their front legs, and then draw up 
their cushion feet till their body makes a loop in 
the air. Then they let go with their front legs and 
lift up their head like an elephant raises his trunk, 
and stretch forward fvirther up the twig. 

As a caterpillar is always eating, his skin be- 
comes so full that there comes a time when he 
cannot put in any more food. Then he remains 
quiet for a few hours, and swells 
out his rings. His skin splits and 
he creeps out, with a new soft skin 
ready underneath. This will stretch, 
and very soon he is eating away as i cushion feet of 
merrily as ever, caterpillar. 



Me does this about nve tunes m 
his caterpillar life, and then he stops eating and 
remains without moving for some days. His colour 
fades, and ^vhen he splits his skin and shuffles it 
off, all the parts of the butterfly or moth are to be 
seen underneath, soft and unfinished. Soon a kind 
of gum oozes out over them. This hardens and 
keeps the tender body safe from harm while it is 
growing. 

Now he is called a chrysalis, or sometimes a pupa 
or doll ; and, indeed, he looks like a crumpled doll 
as you sec his legs bent together and his head folded 
down over them under the hard gum. The pupa 
of a butterfly is generally broad at the top and 
narrow at the bottom, and it has ridges and 
prickles on it (3, Plate, p. 10). But the pupas of 
moths are shaped more like an egg, and are smooth 




(3, Plate, p. 20). Moths generally wrap their pupa 
in a silk bag" or cocoon, but butterflies leave theirs 
naked, and fasten it to a stem or a blade of grass 
with a silken cord (5, Plate, p. 10). 

The caterpillar of the Hawk-moth works its way 
down into the ground and lies in a hole which it 
lines with silk. I had one in a large flower-pot 
once for many months. After about seven months, 
or sometimes much longer, the pupa wriggles up 
to the top of the ground, and then breaks through 
its cover and conies out as a moth. 

Bring in sone caterpillai^s, each witli the plant on which 
you find it. Keep them fed and watch tlieir changes. 


When Moths creep out of their cases they no 
longer do us any harm. They spread their wings 
and fly about sipping honey from the flowers. 
Their strong jaws have almost disappeared, and 
featliery lips take their place. Their inner jaws 
have grown very long, and are rolled together 
into a long double tube (p. 17) — very like a tiny 
elephant's trunk. When the insect is not using 
this trunk it is rolled up under its lip, but when 
it wants to reach the honey in the flowers it 
unrolls the trunk and thrusts it into the blossoms. 

In the early morning, or evening in August, j^ou 
may see the Privet Hawk-moth (1, p. 20) with its 
beautiful rose-coloured wings striped with black, 
thrusting its head into the honeysuckle in the 
hedge. Cr the large brown Humming-bird moth 




may be hovering in the sunshine over a bed of 
flowers in the garden, or sucking honey out of 
the deep flowers of the evening primrose. You 
may know it partly by the humming noise it 
makes ^"ith its wings, and partly because it does 
not settle on the floAA^ers, but suclvs as it flies. 

Then there is the Death's-iiead Hawk-moth, 
which is the largest moth in England, and has this 
curious name because the grey marks on the back 
of its thorax are something like a 
skull. It has brown front wings, 
and yellow^ hind wings, with dark 
bands across them, and its feelers 
and trunk are very short. You may « ' 
find it, if you look out after sunset 
in the autumn, fluttering over the 
hedge, for it is not nearly so rare as 
people think, only it always flies by head of a moth. 


If you get one of these big moths 
you will be surprised to see how different it is from 
the caterpillar out of which it grows. The six legs 
are still there on the three rings of the thorax, but 
there are four splendid wings above them. These 
wings are made of very fine transparent skin, and 
are covered all over with scales, which are arranged 
like tiles on a roof. However carefully you take 
hold of a moth or a butterfly you will always find 
some fine dust left on your fingers. Each grain of 
this dust is a lovely scale, and it Is these wliich give 
the moth its beautiful colours. Moths and butter- 
flies are called Lejiidoptera, because this word means 







scale-winged. The caterpillar had six small eyes, 
so tiny that we did not notice them. The moth has 
these still, hut it has besides two glorious globes (e, 
p. 17) on each side of its head, cut into hundreds of 
little ^windows, so that the moth can look every way, 
although the eyes do not move. The eyes of the 
Death's-head moth shine like red 
imps in the dark night. 
The moth is plainly divided 
the three parts. Its hind 
is oval and pointed, its 
broad front body carries its 
legs and wings, and its head 
carries the big eyes (e), the 
delicate feelers, and the 
sucking trunk (p. 17). The 
feelers or anteniice of 
moths are broad in the 
middle and pointed at 
the end, and they have 
tiny feathers on them. By this you may know 
moths from butterflies. For the antennae of butter- 
flies are nearly always round and thick at the ends 
like a club and have no feathers on them. 

Another difl^erence between them is, that butter- 
flies fold their wings upicards over their backs so 
chat the upper side of the wings touch each other, 
while moths lay theirs down on their backs like a 
roof on a house. 

One common moth you may find is the Goat- 
moth. It has a short body and brownish white 
wings with wavy black lines on them. You will 






find it resting on the leaves of the willow or poplar. 
It does not fly about much, for it has no trunk, and 
does not eat any food during its short moth life. 
It only wants to find a place on which to lay its 
eggs, which will hatch into a naked red grub. This 
grub "svill bore its way into the tree and live there 
for years, eating 
the ^vood. 

Many moth 
grubs live inside 
trunks an d 

branches. If you 
look over the cur- 
rant bushes on a 
hot summer's day 
you ^vill often find 
a pretty little moth 
with a narrow 
yellow and black 
body, thin legs, 
long feelers and 
clear transparent 
wings, very unlike 
most moths. This is one of the Clear-wing-moths 
(5, Plate, p. 20), which have scales round the edge of 
their wings only. It is so lazy that you will easily 
catch it, and it looks so like a gnat that it is called 
the Gnat Clearwing. This moth lays its eggs in the 
twigs of the currant bushes, and its little yellow 
caterpillar, with a black line on its back, eats its 
way into the pith of the twigs. You should always 
clear away the dead or faded twigs on the currant 
c — VI 



bushes, for fear these caterpillars should be in 
them. 

Another moth which you may find flying in the 
bright sunshine is of a dark blue-green colour, with 
six bright crimson spots on its wings. It is the 
Six-spot Burnet-moth, whose cocoons you may 
find in May fastened on the blades of long grass 
in the meadow. By August the moth is out and 
flits from flo^ver to flower. 

There is one more moth which you will like to 
knoTV% because its caterpillar is the Woolly Bear, 
or Hairy Man, which curls itself up in a ball when 
you pick it up. It is very fond of feeding on the 
lettuces and strawberries, and when it is ready to 
change it bites off its long hairs and weaves them 
into its cocoon. When the moth comes out it runs 
about the flower beds in the evening and does not 
fly very high. But everyone knows it as the Tiger- 
moth (4, p. 20), for it is the grandest moth w^e 
have. Its front wings are cream coloured with 
wavy brown stripes on them. The hind ones are 
bright scarlet spotted with black. Its thorax has a 
bright red band on it, and its abdomen is scarlet 
with black bars. If you can find a Woolly Bear in 
the early summer and keep it in a box with a piece 
of wire over it and give it plenty of dead nettles to 
eat you may see its cocoon and the grand Tiger-moth 
which comes out of it. 

Try to find a Hawk -moth, a Clearwing-moth, a Tiger-moth, 
and the cocoon of the Burnet-moth. Bring in caterpillars and 
cocoons, when you can find them, always with a piece of the 
plant ou which they feed. 


There are not nearly so many butterflies as there 
are moths. But as the moths often fly at night, we 
know butterflies best, because they flutter about in 
the bright sunshine. Their caterpillars do not do so 
m.uch harm in the garden as the moth caterpillars, 
except those of the Cabbage butterfly, which we 
read about in Book III. 

You will find it very interesting, in the spring 
and early summer, to look for the chrysalis of each 
common butterfly, and keep them in a box with a 
piece of coarse muslin over it, so as to watch when 
they come out. 

If you do this you will see their colours much 
better than by catching them, because when they 
first come out of their sheath, their wings are not 
battered with wind and rain. And you need not kill 
them ; when you have looked at them you can set 
them free to enjoy the sunshine. 

It is curious that so many butterflies lay their 
eggs on the leaves of stinging nettles. Perhaps it is 
because the cows and sheep will not eat these 
plants, so the eggs are safe. The Peacock butterfly, 
the small Tortoiseshell, and the Red Admiral all 
leave their eggs on nettles. It is there that you 
will find their pupas or chrysalises. Let me tell 
you how to know them. 

The eggs of the Peacock butterfly are gummed 
in patches under the nettle leaves, and in June 
you may find the little black caterpillars spotted 
with white all feeding together in groups. Early 


in July they will each of them have spun a little 
cushion of silk under some leaf, by which the 
curious stiff chrysalis hangs head downwards, look- 
ing like a brown shining shell (3, Plate, p. 10). 

If you carry home either the caterpillar (2), 
or the chrysalis, you will find that about the end 
of July a glorious butterfly (1) will come out. Its 
hind ^wings are brown and its front wings bright 
red and blue, and on each of the four wings 
there is a large bright eye-spot, like the eyes on 
a peacock's tail. The body is dark blue, and the 
feelers on the head are long and thin, with 
knobs at the end. But when the butterfly shuts its 
wings (la), all the bright colours are hidden and 
the whole insect is brown like the trunk of a tree, 
with pale edges like wood newly cut, so that the 
birds are not so likely to see it when it is resting. 

But, if you bring home another chrysalis from 
the nettles by mistake, a different butterfly will 
surprise you. This one has wings much notched 
round the edge, and they are coloured black 
with red markings and white spots. It is the 
Red Admiral, whose pupa also hangs head down- 
wards under nettle leaves. You will not make 
this mistake if you find the caterpillar, for it is 
not black like that of the Peacock butterfly, but 
dark green with a yellow line on its sides, and it 
has spikes all over it. It feeds on nettle leaves 
which it ties round itself with silken threads. And 
you must remember that these green and yellow 
caterpillars will turn into Red Admirals. 

Again, you may find a bunch of settle leaves tied 




together with silk, which have many caterpillars 
inside them. These will be very spiny, and have 
four yellow stripes on their black bodies. They will 
turn into small Tortoiseshell 
butterflies. 

Unless you know these 
three kinds of caterpillars 
well, the safe way is to 
bring them all home 
and keep them till the 
butterflies come out, 
and then notice many 
little differences which 
I cannot give you here. 

On the thistles jow 
may find another 
caterpillar which 
draws the leaves 
round it, and whose 
chrysalis has gold 
spots upon it. This 
will turn into a reddisl 
fly called the Painted ] 
years there are very 
while in other years they are plentif i 

Our next search shall be among 
the alder trees by the riverside 
either in the early spring or al)out 
the end of July, for there are two 
broods of this butterfly. 

You must look among the small twigs for a 
pretty green chrysalis with red dots on it, something 




like a ribbed shell. It will be tied round the middle 
to the stem of the twig by a fine rope of silk (5, 
Plate, p. 10). Notice how cleverly the caterpillar 
has swung it, so that the heavy broad end balances 
the long thin one. Then cut off the twig and take 
it home. The chrysalis will turn into the Brim- 
stone butterfly (4), whose pale yellow wings 
have four red spots on them. You will know it 
quite well, for it is generally the first butterfly to 
come out in the spring. 

Next we shall have to look low down among the 
plants by the roadside. There are some with white 
and pink flowers 'whose petals are in the form of a 
cross. They are called rockcress and bittercress, and 
if you can find out which they are, and look under 
their leaves you may find a most curious chrysalis 
(7, p. 10) shaped like a boat pointed at both ends. 
This will turn into the Orange-tip butterfly (6), 
which has a broad orange patch on the tip of its 
front wings. This butterfly is very gay when it is 
flying, but when it settles (8) and folds its wings 
upwards, it can scarcely be seen on the flowers of 
the wild parsley from which it sips honey. This is 
because the underside of the wings are dotted with 
green and white, like the tiny parsley flowers with 
their white petals and green centres. 

Another common butterfly is the small Heath 
(9) which may be seen any fine day in June or 
September sipping honey from the heath on the 
common. It feeds as a green caterpillar on the tall 
grasses, and comes out a pretty little butterfly with 
tawny yellow wings, with a round eye-spot. 




Now you kno^v liow^ to look for caterpillars, 
and chrysalises, and butterflies, you can learn 
about them for yourself. Anywhere on the violet 
beds you may find the spiny caterpillars* of the 
pretty striped and dotted butterflies called Fritil- 
laries. Blue butterflies are found mostly in chalk 
districts, though the Common Blue lives almost 
everywhere, and you may often see the little 
Copper butterflies flying with it, their dark glitter- 
ing wings gleaming amongst the lovely blues. And 
wherever you see a butterfly on the wing you 
should try to follow it till it alights, for one of the 
most interesting points to notice, among all butter 
flies, is how the under colour of their wings helps 
to hide them when they are resting, while the 
upper colour is bright and gay. 

Bring in caterpillai's and chrysalises, and watch them. 
Notice the plant on which the caterpillar feeds. Compare the 
under surface of their wings with the plants on which they 
settle, 



All living creatures must hunt for food, and 
insects eat a great deal for their size. Beetles 
are very heavy feeders. They eat most when they 
are grubs, but some, like Cockchafers and Tiger- 
beetles, eat almost as much when they are full- 
grown and have their wings. 

There are plant-eating beetles, and beetles which 
feed on other insects and animals. Altogether 
there are more than 3,000 species of beetles ir the 




British Isles. It is useful to know w^hat kind of food 
a beetle eats, for some do good work in the fields and 
gardens, while others do great injury to the crops. 

One of the most mischievous is the Cockchafer. 
You know^ him quite well when he flies in your 
face in the evening. But perhaps you do not 
know him as a grub, when he lives for three or 
four years underground, and eats the roots of the 
grass, corn, and vegetables. If you see plants in 
the cornfield or garden looking sickly and yellow, 
and drooping their leaves although the ground is 
damp, it is most likely that there is a grub under- 
neath, and it may be the grub of a Cockchafer. 

Dig up the plant and you will find an ugly 
white creature (3, Plate, p. 30) like a huge maggot, 
almost as thick as your little finger, with a red 
head and very strong jaws. It has six long legs, 
with five joints, growing on the rings behind its 
head, and is so full of food that it can hardly crawl. 
The end of its tail is swollen into a thick cushion, 
and you can see the breathing all along its sides very 
clearly because it is so distended with food. You 
remember that it does not take in breath through 
its mouth, so it can go on eating all the time. 
If you had not disturbed it, it would have crept 
on from plant to i3lant across the field, doing 
nothing but eat for three years. It goes down 
deeper in the ground in winter to keep "warm 
during the frosty weather. 

At last in the autumn of the third year it draws 
itself together (4, p. 30), and leaves off eating for 
nearly eight months. If you can find one at this 



time you will be able to see the parts of the real 
beetle crumpled up under the clear skin, and for 
the last few months it will be a full-grown sleeping 
cockchafer. 

Then, when tlie warm summer comes, it crawls 
up above ground and flies into the trees, eating 
their leaves as greedily as it ate their roots while 
it was a grub. This is the time to catch and kill 
them, for they only live about a month, and mean- 
while the mother cockchafer lays the eggs which 
will hatch into grubs. 

You will be surprised to see how different the 
beetle is from the white grub you found under- 
ground. It is now a flying insect, about half an 
inch long, with brown powdery wing-cases, covering 
a pair of transparent wings. Its hind-body, or 
abdomen, ends in a fine point, and on its head 
it carries a pair of feelers tipped with broad folds 
like a half-open fan. 

These folds are very handsome in the male 
Chafer (1, p. 30), but much smaller in the female 
(2), and by this you may know the mother which 
will lay the eggs. You must catch and kill these 
last if you want to save your crops, and the most 
merciful way to do this is to drop them into boiling 
water. A crushed beetle is a long time dying, but 
boiling water kills them at once. 

You will find that they rest in the daytime on 
favourite trees, and, if you spread a cloth under- 
neath, you may beat the boughs and so catch a 
good many. Farmers use gas-lime and other dress- 
ings to kill the grubs in the ground. 



Another very mischievous creature is the young 
of the Skipjack or Click-beetle (5, Plate, p. 30). All 
children know these little beetles, though perhaps 
you may not know their name. They are narrow 
and flat, about half an inch long, with very short 
legs. The most common one in England has 
reddish wing-cases, striped with long furrows, and 
a black head and thorax. Boys love to pick them 
up, and turn them on their backs, for they bend 
themselves up in the middle so as to rest on their 
head and tail. Then with a sudden jerk and a click 
they straighten themselves, so that their back hits 
your hand and sends them up in the air, and they 
come down the right way up. Sometimes they fall 
again on their backs, then they rest a little and 
begin again. 

These amusing little creatures are very destruc- 
tive when they are grubs, for the iviretcorms we 
know so well are the young of the Click-beetle. If 
you find a wireworm and look at it carefully you 
will see that it is not a worm, but has the six legs 
on the rings behind its head, by which you kno\\" 
that it is an insect. Wireworms feed on the roots 
of most plants. They are long and narrow like a 
piece of wire, and are generally of a reddish yellow 
colour, and have very tough skins. 

The Click-beetle lays her eggs in meadows, and 
among the roots of plants, and the wireworm when 
it is hatched often feeds for five years before turn- 
ing into a beetle. Therefore Click-beetles must be 
desti'oyed, and salt and lime sprinkled on the earth 
to kill the grubs. 




Unfortunately the pretty little "Weevil-bt^etles 
are also very destructive. We read in Book I. 
about the Nut-weevil, and almost every plant and 
tree has some weevil which attacks it. There i;- 
the weevil of the apple-blossom (4), the Pea-weevil 
(1 and 2), the Bean-weevil (3), the Furze-weevil, the 
Vine-weevil, and many others. They all begin life 




as little soft maggots with no true legs, but only 
cushion feet, and Avith horny heads and sharp jaws. 

You may know the full-grown weevils by their 
prominent snouts, sometimes broad and sometimes 
long. They are beautiful little creatures with 
polished wings which shine like jewels, and bright 
eyes ; but as grubs they destroy the flowers, fruits, 
and green shoots everywhere. 

Some of the most curious are the Stem-boring 
weevils. They have long snouts and very sharp 




jaws, and their feet have hairy pads underneath 
with sharp hooks at the end, so that they can 
cHng firmly to smooth stems. If you search on 
the poplar tree in summer you may find a lovely 
Stem-borer with shining green wings and red 
eyes; and on the fruit trees of the orchard you 
are almost sure to find the Steel-blue weevil which 
lays her eggs in their shoots. 

When the mother stem-borer wants to lay, she 
bores a hole in a young shoot with her snout and 
forces an egg into it. When she has laid several 
in this way, she sets to work to cut off the shoot 
with her sharp jaws. This often takes her some 
weeks, and if you see the hanging shoot and burn 
it you will destroy the grubs. But at last, when it 
hangs by only a thread of bark, she weighs it down, 
and it falls to the ground, where the grub feeds 
in peace when it is hatched. 

Try to find Cockchafers — male, female, and grub. Bring in 
a Click-beetle and a Wireworm. Find as many weevils as 
you can ; and twigs, flowers, and fruit with grubs in them. 




We cannot help destroying some beetles when- 
there are so many that they eat our crops. But 
it is pleasant to know that there are others which 
do us so much good that we need not wage war 
upon them. 

The Tiger-beetles (1, Plate, p. 36), for example, 
are very hungry creatures ; but, as they feed on 


other insects, they destroy the weevil and cock- 
chafer grubs, wireworms and caterpillars, and so 
save our plants. Their name is given to them 
because they are so fierce and cunning. They are 
not very large — our common tiger-beetle is not 
more than three-quarters of an inch in length — 
but their long slender legs are very strong, and 
they can fly very fast. 

There are always plenty running about in the 
hot sun across dry, dusty fields or commons in 
summer. Their wing-cases are a beautiful shining 
green colour shot with copper, and dotted with 
five yellow spots. They run very gracefully, and 
so fast that you will find it difficult to catch one. 
Just as you think you have it, it will suddenly 
open its wing-cases, spread its delicate transparent; 
wings, and be off almost before you can see it go. 

But if you can catch it, you will see that it has 
large eyes standing out on each side of its head 
and tAvo sharp jagged jaws for tearing its prey, 
while the lower ones are covered with stiff bristles 
which help to hold it. 

And now you must look for its grub, which is 
a very curious creature. The best way to find it 
is to go to some soft part of a sandy field where 
you have seen the Tiger-beetles running about. 
Then look at any small holes in the sand, and 
try to find one which leads to a tunnel in the 
ground. The grub of the Tiger-beetle sits at the 
mouth of this tunnel to catch insects as they pass- 
It will disappear as soon as you come near, but if 
you put a blade of grass into the hole and shake 



it, the grub will grasp the blade, and you can pull it 
out. 

Then you can see the tools it uses. It is a 
long soft white grub with a horny head, and jaws 
like sickles, and, besides its six brown spiny feet, 
it has two soft humps on its back with little hooks 
on them. As soon as this grub is hatched in the 
ground, it scoops a tunnel in the soft sand with 
its spiny legs, and pulls itself up to the top, holding 
on by its legs and the hooks on its back. Its head 
just fills the hole, and as it is a poor weakly 
creature and cannot move fast, it keeps quiet till 
some insect passes, and then darts its head out and 
pulls its victim down. ..If you have the patience 
to find some of these tunnels, and sit still and 
watch, you may see the grub catch its prey. 

The Rove or Cocktail-beetles (2, p. 36), which 
we found in the first lesson, are very useful in 
eating insects, though they are not beautiful. But 
the Ground-beetles, which have only very small 
wings under their wing cases, and seldom fly, are 
the best hunters. You may sometimes see a good- 
sized beetle with long legs running along through 
the grass. Its body is very dark, shaded with red 
and violet. This is the Violet Ground-beetle, and 
it is hunting for grubs and wire worms. 

There are some very curious beetles not difficult 
to find which will interest you. These are the 
Sexton, or Burying-beetles. When you see a dead 
mouse or bird lying in some part of the field or 
garden, pick it up quietly. If it has been there a 
few days it will already have a bad smell, and you 



are almost sure to find underneath it two or more 
beetles with thick bodies and strong legs. They are 
generally black with red feelers, and two light red 
bands on their abdomen. These are Sexton-beetles 
(3, p. 36), which have scented the dead body and 
flown, often for some distance, to bury it. 

They scrape away the soft ground underneath, 
till the body sinks down, and then they drag the 
earth over it. Why do you think they do this ? 
Because the mother beetle wants to lay her eggs 
there that the grubs may feed on the flesh. She 
does this as soon as the animal is buried, and in 
a few days the grubs are hatched. They are 
narrow, and each has six legs and a number of 
spines along its back. With these it wriggles 
through the flesh, and eats away till it buries itself 
in the ground and turns into a beetle. 

A great many beetles are useful to us by eating 
dead and living animals. Among these are the 
little black shining Mimic-beetles, which draw up 
their legs and pretend to be dead %vhen they are 
touched, and the Glow-worms, which shine sc 
brightly in the lanes in the summer nights. 

A good gardener who sees a glow-worm in a 
hedge will always pick it up gently, and put it in 
his garden when he has the chance. For the young 
of the glow-worm is a soft grub (3, p. 40), which 
works its way into the shells of small snails and 
feeds upon them. 

If you find a dry snail-shell with a white grub 
in it, it will most likely be the grub of the glow- 
worm. You may know it by a tuft of white threads 






on its tail, which it uses to brush off the sHme of 
the snail from its back. 

When they are full-grown you will find the 
mother glow-worm (1) very easily at night, because 









she gives out such a bright light. She has no 
wings, and you might take her for a slug if you 
did not notice her six little legs. The male glow- 
Avorm (2) has two spots of light near his tail. But 
he is not so bright hs the fei-iale. He has long 



soft "wing-cases and broad wings, with which he 
often flies into a lightf^d room w^hen the window 
is left open. 

The last useful beetle w^e can mention is the 
little Ladybird. She feeds all her life long on the 
plant bugs and aphides which destroy our plants. 
Wherever there are plant-lice, there the ladybird 
lays a bunch of yellow eggs and, wdien they are 
hatched, the long dark grubs clamber vij) the plant 
stalks and poke the lice into their mouths with 
their front feet. After a time each one glues its 
tail to a leaf and hangs till it becomes a ladybird, 
and then it flies away to feed on plant-lice on some 
other bush and to laj' more eggs. 

Bring in a Tiger-beetle, and try to find its grub. Search for 
Sexton-beetles under dead animals. Bring in a Mimic-beetle. 
Find a male and female glow-worm. Look for the grub of the 
Ladybird. 



"We all like Butterflies because they are pretty, 
and Bees because they give us honey. But no one 
likes Wasps, for w^e are always afraid that they 
w^ll sting, and they spoil our garden fruit. Yet 
w^asps are very industrious and interesting. They 
act as scavengers, eating otfal, raw^ meat, and 
insects, and they never sting unless they are 
frightened. You may be stung by pressing a 
wasp without knowing it. But people are very 
silly who flap them, and keep dodging about when 



they are near, for if you sit qiiite still they Tvill 
not hurt you. 

We are obliged to kill wasps, or we should be 
overrun by them and have no fruit, and the best 
way is to keep a good look out in the spring and 
early summer. The few big ones ^vhich come 
out then are queen wasps, or mothers, and each 
one will found a nest. It is more merciful to 
kill these, than to have to take nests in the summer, 
when there may be as many as 3,000 or 4,000 in 
each. Most boys have seen a wasps' nest dug out at 
night, but perhaps you have never looked at one 
carefully. Let us see how it is made. 

When the queen-wasp comes out from under 
the moss or grass, w^here she has spent the winter, 
she looks out for a hole in the ground, left perhaps 
by a mouse or a mole. Creeping into it, she makes 
it larger by biting the earth and kicking it out 
with her hind feet. Then she flies away and 
scrapes small pieces of fibre off the trees and 
plants. You may sometimes see her scraping 
window frames or posts with her ja^vs^s. She is 
getting shreds of wood. With these she goes back 
to the hole, and works them up, with some gluey 
matter from her mouth, into a kind of greyish 
paper or cardboard. 

Before it hardens she plasters this into the top 
of the hole, making a thick lump, which she glues 
to the roots of plants. Then she starts afresh for 
more fibre, and with it builds a few cells under 
the lump. 

She lays an egg in each, and tlien go'^s ou making 





more paj)er and more cells. In about eight days 
the first eggs are hatched into legless grubs, and 
she feeds them with honey and insects, still going 
on with her work. In about three weeks Cie grubs 





spin their cocoons, and in another week they come 
out as working wasps. After that, some come out 
almost every day, and the queen-wasp leaves them 
to do the work of building the nest and feeding 
the grubs, while she only lays eggs. 




They not only build cells, they also cover the 
nest with a papery dome of several layers, which 
hangs like an open umbrella from the lump at 
the top. When they have finished one comb it 
is like a round plate, and is smooth above, with 
a great number of cells underneath, all opening 
downwards. 

The wasps then make several gluey pillars under 
this comb to hold up a new one below which they 
form in the same way as the first. So they go on 
till August, when there may be fifteen or sixteen 
flat round plates one below the other, joined by a 
number of pillars. Then they draw the papery 





dome in at the bottom so that the whole nest is 
a round or oval-shaped ball. As wasps do not 
store honey, these combs are only cells for grubs. 
The papery covering prevents the wet soaking in 
from the bank. 

In August they build larger cells, out of which 
come males or drones which have longer antennae 
than the workers and queen-wasps. These queens 
are larger than either the males or workers. They 



soon fly out of the nest and pair with the drones 
and as winter comes on the wasps kill any grubs 
which remain, and, growing sleepy and dull, die 
themselves, leaving only the queen -wasps to 
sleep till next spring. Then if you know where 
there is an old nest you can dig it carefully out 
and see the long tunnel in the bank, along which 
the wasps went in, so that no one might know 
where their nest was. 

Some wasps build under the roofs of houses, 
especially the large wasps called Hornets, unless 
they choose the old trunk of a tree. If you look 
in a wood you may sometimes find the nest of the 
Wood-wasp hanging under the bough of a tree, 
though you would scarcely notice it unless you 
follow a Wood-wasp home. They are built like 
the other nests, only they have a thick papery 
column down the middle. 

Besides the connnon wasps there are a great 
many smaller kinds, some of which you may find. 
They are very interesting, because they carry 
insects into a hole and bury them with their eggs, 
so that the young grub may have food when it 
is hatched. 

There is a pretty little wasp, generally called 
the Wall- wasp (1, p. 45), which you may see 
in June or July biting the mortar in the garden 
wall or making holes in a sandy bank. It is smaller 
and blacker than the common wasp, and has a 
few bright yellow bands on its hind body. It 
scoops out a tunnel in the mortar and leaves the 
pieces sticking round the hole. Then after going 

in to see that all is right it comes out and flies 
away, coming back presently with a small green 
caterpillar. It carries this in and goes off for 
another, and so it goes on till it has brought about 
fifteen or twenty. 

If you dig out the mortar along the w^all, so 
as to open this tunnel, you ^vill find at the end an 
egg hanging by a thread. The wasp put the egg 
there before she went for the first caterpillar. 
Between this egg and the hole the fifteen little 
caterpillars will be lying curled up one beyond 
the other. The curious thing is that they are not 
dead. The wasp has only stupefied them with 
her sting so that they do not try to escape. If 
you do not break into the nest she ^\411 stop the 
hole up with the pieces of inortar round the edge 
and leave it. Then when the grub has eaten the 
caterpillars and turned into a wasp it will bite 
its way out. 

Then you may find some of the Sand-wasps 
(2, p. 45), which dig so many holes in the sand- 
banks on heaths, or in the lanes and gardens, 
wherever it is sunny and warm. One of these, 
called the Hairy Sand-wasp, piits Spiders in her 
hole for the grub to eat. She is orange coloured, 
with a black head and straggling legs. But she 
is very strong and can drag a big spider to 
her den. 

I have not room to tell you more of these 
curious wasps, some of which fill their nests with 
beetles, others with crickets. But now you know 
about them you will follow any you see and watch 



their habits for yourself, which is much the best 

way. 

Find an old wasps' nest and try to make a drawing of it. 
Notice the shape of the conmioii wasp and compare it with 
any others you find. Notice paiticularly the difference in the 
thread joining the abdomen to the thorax. 



We all know the Hive-bee well, but i^erhaps you 
have not noticed that there are other kinds of bees 
flying in the garden. Some of these are about the 
same size as the hive-bee ; some are much smaller, 
and they are differently marked. 

Most of these are solitary bees. There are no 
neuters among them, only niales and females 
living in pairs. Others live in great numbers in 
the holes of sandy banks, but do not work together. 

If you have ivy. growing on your cottage, you 
must often have noticed small bees flitting in and 
out of the flowers. Among these there will most 
likely be one, about half an inch long, with a black 
body covered 'with a taAvny do^vn. She will have 
two little horns on her head, and is called the " Two- 
horned Osmia" (1, riate, p. 51). 

If you can watch one and follow her, you may 
see her fly into some old rotten post, or tree-stump. 
Then if you cut into the post near the hole you \\ ill 
find a curious nest. For this bee bores a lon<r 
tunnel and builds a waxen cell at the bottom. Here 
she lays an egg and puts round it bee-bread, made 
of pollen and honey from the flcjwers. She has no 



groove in her leg like the hive-bee, so she carries the 
sticky pollen in the thick hairs under her body, and 
scrapes it of£ with a comb on her feet. 

When she has laid the egg and put in food, she 
seals the cell with wax, and begins another on the 
top of it. So she goes on till she has filled the 
tunnel. 

But how is the bottom bee to get out '? Her 
egg was laid first and she has eight or ten others on 
the top of her. Strange to say they wait for each 
other. They all become perfect bees about the same 
time, and, if one below is ready sooner than the 
others, she eats through the cover of her cell and 
tries to push past her neighbour. But if the one 
above is so big that the bee cannot get by without 
hurting her, she waits patiently till all are ready. 

Another little bee which you may often find is 
the Sleeper bee (2, p. 51), so-called because she 
often sleeps in the blossoms of -flowers, where you 
may find her. She is thin and black with a square 
head and strong jaws, and she has a little yellow 
down on her hind body or abdomen. She too 
burrows in posts, but very often she makes her 
nest inside a large stra^v. In olden days, when 
cottages were thatched, hundreds of these bees 
would build in the larger straws of the thatch, and 
might be heard buzzing abovit the roof. 

Then there is another bee which you cannot 
help finding. This is the Leaf-cutting bee (3, 
p. 51). Have you not seen the leaves of rose-trees 
with pieces like a half-moon cut out of their edge ? 
If you watch you may see a bee doing this work. 




She is about the same size as a hive-bee, but 
rather stouter, and her bod}'^ is black with soft bro^vn 
hairs over it. She clings to the leaf and turns 
round in a circle biting 
as she goes. Just before 
she has finished she 
opens her ^vings and so 
balances herself in the 
air. Then, when the 
last bite is made, she 
flies off with the piece 
of leaf carried be- 
tween her feet and her 
jaws. 

She goes to a hole in 
the ground, which is 
straight down for a little 
way, and then turns, and 
runs along under the sur- 
face. Here she packs the 
leaf in and goes back for 
more. With several 
pieces she makes a little 
thimble, in which she lays 
an egg, with food round 
it, and closes it with 
three or four i-ound 
pieces. Then she begins another thimble, pushing 
it in, so that it fits a little way into the last one. 
In this way she builds about seven cells, each with 
its egg and bee-bread, for the grubs to feed on till 
they turn into bees. Though you will easily see 





the bees cutting the leaves, you will not so easily 
find their tunnels, for they fill in the earth again at 
the top, so that the entrance cannot be seen. The 
best way is to follow a bee Avhich has been cutting 
^ a leaf, but she is so quick you will 
have to be quick too. Sometimes she 
makes her hole in a willow tree 
when the wood is soft. 

There is another Osmia "which 

makes its nest in the stem of the 

 bramble. It hollows out 

the pith and covers the 
cells with it. When you 
see a blackberry stalk with 
the end bitten off, you may 
as well cut dowai a little way 
with your knife and see if 
there is a tunnel in it, ^vith 
bee-cells, or wasp-cells, in- 
side. 

Another very curious 
bee, called the Carder bee 
(4, p. 51), lines its tunnel 
with fluffy hairs and 
cotton stripped off plants. 
You will remember that 
the ragged robin and wild 
campion have their stems covered with thick down 
The " Carder bees " strip this flviff off the plants, roR 
it up in a ball, and fly away with it to their nests in 
the ground, where they use it to make their cells. 
Solitary bees do not store honey for the wintei* 



like the hive bees. They die off in the autumn, all 
except some mothers, which creep into holes and 
sleep till the spring, when they make their nests and 
lay their eggs. 

There are so many of them that I cannot 
tell you about them all. You must watch for your- 
selves, and you will soon learn to notice the little 
holes in the trees and the ground, and in some of 
them you are sure to find curious creatures. 

Notice different kinds of solitary bees, and try to find their 
tunnels in the spring. 


Hive bees are so much at home in our gardens, 
that I am afraid most people think they know all 
about them, and take very little notice of them. 
This is unfortunate, because bee-keeping is very in- 
teresting, and many more cottagers might make 
money by bees, and at the same time become really 
fond of these busy little insects. 

When all the bees in the hive had to be killed 
each time the honeycombs were taken, we could not 
get fond of our bees. But now, even cottagers can 
have boxes and glasses on the top of their hives^so 
as to take the combs without destroying the little 
friends who fill them for us. 

The hive-bee is a wonderful insect. She has 
three pairs of legs, and two pairs of wings just like 
a Wasp. But the hind pair of legs is longer than 
the others, and she has a groove in each of them 



 



which makes a kind of basket, into which she 
packs pollen from the flowers, and carries it home 
to make bee-bread for her grubs. You may often 
see a bee going into a hive with both its hind legs 
heavily laden with sticky f)ollen. It is puzzling at 
first to guess how she gets it into the basket, but, 
if you look lower down her leg, you ^\'ill see that 
it is covered with hairs which form a small brush. 
When she comes out of a flo^ver her hairy body 
is covered with pollen-dust, 
and she brushes it off with 
one leg, making it into a little 
lump, which she packs into 
the basket of the other leg. 

Her mouth is a most use- 
ful tool for getting honey. 
When she is not sucking, 
her trunk is drawn in under 
her strong jaws. But ^^hen 
she is feeling for honey, this trunk, which is really 
a long under lip with a hairy tongue inside it, is 
thrust into the flo^ver and brings back the honey, 
which she passes down her throat into a honey- 
bag, or first stomach. 

Then she flies back to the hive. There other 
bees take the pollen out of her basket as she goes 
in, and she passes on to the cells, and pours into 
them the honey from her throat. Some of this 
honey is used to feed the young bee-grubs, and the 
rest to fill the honey-combs for the winter. 

Sometimes, however, the bee does not pour out 
the honey, but goes to the top of the hive, and 



hangs quietly by her front feet. After about four 
and twenty hours the honey is digested in her 
stomach, and part of it forms bees-wax, which 
oozes out under her body into eight little pockets. 
Then she goes down into the hive, and picks this 
wax out with her strong jaws, moistens it with her 
tongue into a kind of paste, and uses it to build the 
cells of the comb. 

It is when the bees are out getting honey and 
pollen that they are so use- 
ful to the gardener. You 
will remember that the vege 
table marrows cannot grow 
unless the bees carry pollen 
from one flo^ver to another. 
Our plants have better flowers 
and our fruit trees bear better 
fruit because the bees fly to bee hanging and showfno 


and iro and carry j)ollen from her body. 
one to another. 

But if the bee carried it haphazard from one 
kind of flower to another it would be of very little 
use, for strange pollen would not make the seeds 
grow. Watch a bee and you will find that she very 
seldom visits more than one kind of flower on the 
same journey. She will fly from one bed of violets 
to another, or from apple-tree to apple-tree. But 
she will not in one journej^ go from an apple-tr^e 
to a pear-tree, nor from a violet to a primrose. 
We do not know an hy she does this, but it is very 
useful to us, and all gardeners should encourage 
bees in their garden. 








And now, if you want to keep bees, you must 
learn a few simple things. You must always be 
very gentle and quiet with them. They will soon 
learn to know you, and to understand that you 

are not afraid of them. 

If you have a straw hive 
it sliould measure about six- 
teen to eighteen inches across, 
be about eight or nine inches 
high, and flat on the top, with 
a hole in it in which a plug 
is fixed. Put this hive in a 
warm sheltered part of the 
garden on a wooden bench 
about fifteen inches from the 
ground. Then in May buy 
a swarm of bees which has 
just come out from a neigh- 
bour's hive. Smear your 
own hive inside with balm 
and sugar, and hold it under 
the bough on which the 
swarm hangs. Shake the 

bough gently till the bees tall 
in. Turn the hive do^vn on 
to a piece of wood, and in 
the evening carry it gently to your garden. The 
next morning the bees will be busily at work. 
The big heavy drones will wander about idly, but 
the smaller working bees will go out and collect 
honey, hang up in the hive till they have wax in 
their pockets (see p. 57), and begin to build the coml> 






If your swarm was the first to leave the hive 
the old queen bee, which was in the middle, will 
soon begin to lay eggs in the cells — about 200 
a day. But a second swarm is led by a young 
queen, and she will fly out with the drones before 
she settles down in the hive. 

Now the w^orking bees will be very busy. In 
two or three days the first eggs are hatched, and 
the nursing bees feed the grubs with honey and 
pollen which the other bees bring in. In about 







five or six days they seal up the mouth of each 
cell, and the bee-grub spins its silken cocoon, in 
which it turns into a bee in ten days more. Then 
it comes out and works w^ith the rest. 

The empty cell will soon be fillp'^ with honey; 
but it "will be brown, not white and clean like the 
"virgin" honey which is put into new cells. After 
about six weeks the queen lays some eggs in 
larger cells, out of which come males or drones. 
Then about every three days she lays an egg in a 
cell like a thimble, on the edge of the comb. The 





grub in this is fed with special food, and becomes a 
queen-bee. 

Unless you have a hive ^vith a glass ^vindow in 
it you cannot see all this going on. But about the 
beginning of June you may expect that the hive 
is getting full of combs and bees. Then is the time 
to take out the plug at the top, and put on a bell- 
glass, or a box of ^vooden sections (see p. 58). In 
these the bees will make comb which you can take 
away. You must pvit in a small piece of comb to 
tempt the bees to build, and then you must put a 
straw cover or some old cloths over the whole to 
keep it warm and dry and dark. 

In about a month you will find this upper hive 
full of honey-comb sealed up in the cells. You 
can take it oif with a cloth dipped in weak 
Condy's Fluid, for the bees do not like this, and 
they "will not come near you. These sections of 
honeycomb Tvill be pure and clear, and you can 
take them away without killing a single bee. 

In July you may get one or more new swarms, 
and then when September comes you must take 
off the top and cork up the hive for the winter. 
But remember that you have taken a great part of 
the bees' store of food and you must feed them 
with honey and sugar during the cold weather. 

Examine three bees — male, female and neuter. Examine 
trunk and hind legs of the working bee. Get a piece of 
brown honey-comb with remains of bee-bread and young 
bees. Compare it with pure honey-comb. AVatch a bee among 
the flowers. Find honey-comb with thimble cells on the edge. 



There are a number of small flying insects Avhicli 
belong to the same family as the Bees and Wasps, 
such as the Saw-flies, which destroy our vegetables, 
and the Gall-flies which make those curious galls 
we found on the oak-tree and other trees. But 
though we call these " flies " you may always know 
them from true flies because they have four wings, 
while all real flies have only two. 

Try to collect as many two-winged flies as you 
can. There will be the common House-fly, the 
Blue-bottle or Blow-fly, Gnats, Midges, Daddy-long- 
legs, Horse-flies, and many others. 

The House-fly and the Blue-bottle are both 
very useful in their right place, for they eat decay- 
ing matter and dead animals. But they do grenu 
harm if we allow them to multiply in the wrong 
place. 

If you nave a great number of flies in your 
house you may be sure that there is dirt some- 
where, for the House-fly lays her eggs in dung- 
heaps, dust-heaps, or on any dirt she can find 
behind a shutter or door, or in an unsT\'ept cornei-. 

She lays about 150 at a time, and in a day or two 
the little legless grubs are hatched, and feed on 
the dirt. In four or five days they leave ott' eating 
and rest in their grub-skin, which grows hard and 
brown. Then in summer they come out as full- 
grown flies in about a week. But in winter- the 
hard pupa often lies for months, and people who 






do not clean their house thorovighly in autumn 
are Kkely to have a plague of flies next year. 

The Blue-bottle or Blow-fly (1, p. 61) lays her eggs 
(a) on meat of any kind, or on the bodies of decaying 
animals. When her grubs are hatched they are a^ ery 
useful in ridding us of bad-smelling creatures, for 
they give out a kind of liquid which makes the flesh 
decay more quickly so that they may eat it. 

All boys know " gentils " 
(b) used for fishing. These are 
the maggots of the Blue-bottle, 
and when they have done 
feeding they grow soft inside 
and dra^v themselves vip into 
an egg-shape. Then they give 
out a liquid which hardens 
their skin into a shiny reddish- 
brown case (c). Inside this the 
Blue-bottle forms, and ther 
pushes its head out between 
two little lids at the top of the 
cocoon. 
If you catch a Blue-bottle and put it under a 
bell-glass with a few grains of sugar you may 
watch it put out its trunk and feed. You will see 
that it turns and twists the sugar as if it were 
playing with it. But all the time it is wetti^iig 
it with some liquid Avhich it sends down its trunk 
so as to work the hard lump into syrup which it 
can suck up. If you press the thorax of a Blue- 
bottle very gently with your finger and tliumlj 
it will put out its trunk and you can see the 





thick lips at the end with the sucker (a) between 
them. But you will want a magnifying glass or 
a microscope to see a little lancet (/) %vhich it has 
inside its trunk, and which it uses to j)ierce the 
skins of fruits, when it wants to suck their juice. 

There are two kinds of flies which 
are much more hurtful than the 
common fly or the blue-bottle. These 
are the Gad-flies and the Bot-flies. 
You know one of tlie small Gad-flies 
quite well, for it drops on our hands, 
or our neck, ^vhen we are sitting out 
of doors, and lets us know that it is 
there, by giving a sharp bite to suck 
our blood. We call it the Horse-fly 
because it teases the horses so much 
in summer; but there are man j^ others 
Ave do not know so well. The largest 
English Gad-fly (4, p. 61) is about an 
inch long. 

The Bot-flies are more dangerous 
than the Gad-flies, for instead of 
biting with their mouths they prick with a sharp 
tube at the end of their abdomen, so as to lay 
their eggs under the skin of an animal. The 
Bot-fly or Warble-fly of the ox (2, p. 61) looks 
<'ery like a humble bee, only she has two wing?' 
instead of four. She has a pointed tube at the 
end of her body, with w^hich she pricks the skin 
of the ox, and lays her eggs underneath it. In 
a short time the eggs hatcli, and the maggot 
irritates the flesh so much that large lumps are 




seen on the side or back of the animal. If the 
farmer does not press out the maggots from 
these himps, and put a proper dressing on them, 
the beef of the ox will be poor and bad, and no 
feeding will make it any better. When the maggot 
is full-grown it drops to the ground to make its 
change. 

The horse Bot-fly (3, p. 61) does not put her eggs 
under the skin, but sticks them, with a little slime 
from her mouth, to the hairs of the horse on his 
shoulder or under the knee. 

When the egg is ready to break, the warmth of 
the horse's tongue, as he licks himself, makes it 
crack and the grub slips down the horse's throat 
to his stomach. There it feeds, and when it is full- 
gro^vn passes out with the dung. 

The way to check this grub is to keep the skin 
of the horse clean and the hair short. This Bot- 
fly is rather larger than the House-fly, with 
bright yellow markings and a very hairy body. 

I wonder how many grubs you know of those 
gnat-like flies, with thin feelers and legs, which 
fly in the fields and over the rivers. We read 
about the gnat in Book II., but you should know 
the midges, which attack "v\^heat and other grain. 
! The Wheat-midge is a little orange yellow fly, 
about the size of a A^ery small gnat. Early on a 
June morning, when the wheat is in flower, you 
may shake these midges off the stalks and see them 
flying near the ground. The mothers have a 
sharp tube as thin as a hair, with ^vhich they 
lay their eggs in the ^vheat blossom. There they 




hatch into little red maggots, which feed on the 
grain and often destroy half a crop. 

You ought to know, too, the grubs of the 
Daddy-long-legs, which do so much harm to our 
crops. If you see a Daddy-long-legs clinging to 
a blade of grass she is most likely thrusting her 
egg-tube into the ground to lay her eggs. 

These hatch into legless brown grubs with 
strong jawp and a pair of short horns. Farmers 
call them • Leather Jackets," and you may find 
them when you are ploughing damp fields. Or you 
may find the hard pupa, which is shaped like a 
Daddy-long-legs with its wangs folded, its legs 
drawn up, and two horns on its head. It has 
spines on its abdomen, with which it will drag itself 
up when the fly wants to come out. 

The best way to get rid of these hurtful grubs 
is to plough the ground deeply and bury the eggs 
or maggots, so that they die, or cannot get to the 
surface, or to put a dressing of gas-lime or other 
insect-killer on the land. Starlings are very useful 
in pulling them out of the ground and eating them. 

Find grub and pupa of Blue-bottle. Examine a Blue- 
bottle—legs, body, and proboscis. Try to find House-fly eggs. 
Bi-ing in a Horse-fly. Try to find the Bot-flies of the ox and 
the horse. Find a Wheat-midge and its ^rub; also the grub 
and pupa of the Daddy-long-legs. 



All the insects about which we have been reading 
are different when they are young from what they are 




when full grown. But young Crickets and Grass- 
hoj)pers when they come out of the egg are much 
the same as when they are older, except that 
ohey are smaller and have no wings. They jump 
and eat and behave in the same way as their parents, 
and change their coats four or five times. Aftei- 
the last change you can see their wing-cases under- 
the skin, and, ^vhen this bursts, they spread their 
wings and fly. 

If you make a cage of wire gauze and put some 
young crickets in it, and feed them with damp leaves, 
you may see these changes. But do not try with 
a muslin cover, as a friend of mine did. For 
crickets have strong jaws and soon eat their way 
through. 

The little green Grasshoppers of the fields are 
easy to find, but the large green Grasshopper (see 
p. 71), is not so common. Still if you know where to 
look, in the nut-hedges and woods, you may often 
catch one, and it is a fine insect to examine. His 
head is well separated from his front body or thorax, 
and he has two very long feelers which lie back over 
his body. His jaws are very strong, and if you give 
him a leaf to eat, under a glass, j^ou can see how 
they move sideways to cut the food, and the 
upper and lower lips, through which he passes it 
to his chewing jaws inside. 

If you have caught a female, she will have a 
curious long tube or egg-layer at the end of her 
Taody, which she forces into the ground, to lay her 
eggs, and this will show you the way that other 
Bmaller insects do it. 





And now you will want to know how a grass- 
hopper chirps, for you will remember that no 
insect can make any noise with its mouth. Put 
your finger gently along, under the left front wing 
of the great green Grasshopper, close to where it is 
joined to the body. You m ill feel that it is rough 
like a file. The grasshopper rubs this file against 
the edge of the other wing, and makes the rasjaing 
noise. 

The small green Grasshopper (2, p. 71), which 
has short feelers standing forward from his head, 
makes his chirping noise in another way. He 
has a file on the inside of his hind leg, which he 
rubs against the top of his wing. This little grass- 
hopper is really a small locust, like those which fly 
in swarms over Europe, eating every green thing 
which comes in their way. Fortunately for us, 
though he eats very greedily, our little friend is not 
so destructive as they are. Locusts have no egg 
laying tube ; they drop their eggs into the loose 
sarth and cover them up. 

Crickets are very like grasshoppers, and make 
their chirping by rubbing their wings together. 
The females have long egg-laying tubes, as you 
will see if you can catch a moi;iier cricket in the 
kitchen. She lays her eggs behind the oven or near 
the fireplace, where they will hatch all the year 
round in the warmth. 

Grasslioppers and crickets do not chirp to please 
us, they are calling to each other. Therefore they 
must be able to hear. Where do you expect to find 
their ears ? I arn sure vou will never guess. 







Look under the wing of the small grasshopper 
on the first ring of his abdomen, the one behind his 
hind leg. There, a little above his breathing holes, 
you will see a very small hole. This has a thin skin 
over it, and it is his ear. The great grasshopper 
has his ear in a still more curiovis place, on his front 
leg below his knee (e, p. 70). 

I expect you will know the Field-cricket (3, p. 71), 
for though it is very timid, and seldom comes out in 

the day, yet if you 
find out where it lives, 
by its chirp, and poke 
a blade of grass down 
the cracks of the 
earth, it is sure to 
seize it, and you 
can draw it out. 
Many country 
children get them in this way. A Field-cricket is 
rather larger than the House-cricket ; his body is 
more yellow, and his chirp much more shrill. He is 
very useful in the garden, for he feeds on insects 
as well as plants, sitting outside his hole at night 
to catch them. But by day he is always in the 
ground, where the young ones remain all the 
winter till they get their wings. 

I wonder if you have ever found a Mole-cricket ? 
There are plenty in England in sandy ground, es- 
pecially in damp fields, and on the banks of canals 
and rivers. But they do not live in all parts of 
*;he country, and they are very shy, only coming 
out at night. Tliey make a strange croaking cry, 




and by it you may know that there are some in 
your neighbourhood. Then you must look along 
the river-bank or in a sandy and damp part of the 
garden, and if you can see ridges of earth thrown 
up, most likely the Mole-cricket will be working 
underneath. 

He is a very curious insect, about half an inch 
long, with a 
small head and 
long feelers, a 
very broad 
thorax, and 
thick flat front 
legs, ending in 
large feet like 
a mole, with 
sharp black 
claws. With 
these he digs his 
way through 
the earth, just 
as the mole 
does, and his 
body is covered 

with soft hairs, brown above and yellow beneath, to 
keep off the damj) earth. He does great mischief 
if he gets into a garden, for he tunnels along, eating 
the roots and stems of the plants. The mother 
Mole-cricket has no egg-laying tube, for she does 
not want it underground. She lays about 200 eggs 
in a chamber at the end of the run, and the young 
Mole-crickets live there for two or thre<^ ^^ears 




before they get their wings. If you can find a 
nest, and get a few of the young ones, you may 
see their curious shape. 

There are two other straight-winged insects 
which you knoTV quite well. One is the Earwig, of 
which some silly people are afraid, though it does no 
harm to anyone. Its pincers are used to fold its long 
hind wings under its short wing-cases, and the only 
mischief it does is to eat our flowers. The mother 
earwig is very affectionate. She carries aw^ay her 
eggs if they are disturbed, and watches over her 
little ones till they are full-grown. 

The other straight-winged insect is the Cock- 
roach, which people call "black beetle." It is not 
a beetle, for it does not grow out of a grub, and it 
is not black but brown. The young are like the old 
ones, only smaller and without wings. The mother 
cockroach never has any wings. She carries her 
eggs in a curious way at the end of her body in a 
case like a purse, and hides it behind the oven, or 
under the boards, just before the eggs are hatched. 
These cases are brown, horny, and shaped something 
like a bean. Inside there are about sixteen eggs, 
neatly arranged in two rows like peas in a pod. 
Cockroaches are very disagreeable and destructive 
insects. They eat everything they can get, and have 
a very repulsive smell. 

Try to find the different kinds of grasshopper and cricket, 
both full grown and before they have their wings. Examine 
the wings of an earwig. Find the egg-cases of the cocki'oach. 

 
Ants are the most intelligent of all insects. We 
learnt a little about the home of the Hill-ant in 
Book I., to which you can look back for drawing!- 
of the male, female, and worker ants with their 
grubs and cocoons. 

Now we will look at some other ants, and learn 
about their ways. There are two very common 
kinds to be found in most 
gardens. One is red and the 
other black. They both build 
their homes underground, by 
clearing out the earth with i 
their jaws and feet, and so 
making galleries and cham- 
bers. There is generally a 
little rise in the ground, 
where they are at work, 
making a dome above the nest, but it is not so 
conspicuous as the hill of the Hill-ant. If you dig 
a deep hole on one side of a nest you will open 
the chambers and see the grubs inside them, and. 
if you do not make it too big, the busy ants will 
soon put it right again. 

Then you can take a few cocoons, and put them 
in a little earth under a glass so as to see the 
young ants come out. But do not take the grubs, 
unless you take some grown-up ants with them, for 
they cannot feed themselves. 

If you get a black and a red ant you will know 



them apart, not only by their colour, out because 
the black ant has one round knob (1, p. 75) in the 
thin part joining her hind body to her fore body, 
w^hile tlie red ant has two knobs (2, p. 75). By this 
we know that the red ant has a sting, and the 
black ant has none. All English ants which have 
two knobs to their abdomen can sting; but those 
with only one knob cannot (with one rare excep- 
tion). Those which have no sting attack their 
enemy with their strong jaws, and squirt out a 
strong acid over them. 

There is a little yellow ant which lives in our 
houses and eats our food. She has two knobs, and 
stings quite sharply. I once cut open a cake w^hich 
had been some days in the cupboard and found the 
middle full of these ants. They swarmed on my 
hand and made it tingle with their stings. This 
ant generally makes her home behind the fireplace. 

If you put your ants under a glass, and give them 
a piece of nut or bread to eat, you may see them 
use their outer jaws to scrape the surface, and their 
tiny tongue to lick off the juice or oil, while they pass 
the food to the inner jaws, just as the bees and 
wasps did. You may also see them pause to stroke 
their body with their front legs. Look closely at 
these and you will see a small spur on a joint a 
little way up the leg. This spvir has more than 
fifty fine teeth on it, and there are some coarse 
teeth on the leg itself. These are the ant's brush 
and comb. She scrapes herself with them, and then 
draws them through her outer jaws, or inandibles, 
to clean them. 



She has very small eyes, and always uses her 
antennae to find out anything she wants to 
know. These stand out in front of her curious 
flat head, and are very mysterious instruments. 
When ants want to talk to one another they touch 
their antennae, and in some strange way they can 
tell each other where to go and what to do. 

The Garden-ants live much more underground 
than the Hill-ants, but you may often see them 
sunning themselves in the garden, or cutting off 




blades of grass with their mandibles to line their 
nests, or tearing a spider or fly to pieces. They 
often seem to run hither and thither as if they 
did not know what they were doing, but if you 
watch you will And that each one has an object. 
Some are carrying things into the nest, others 
are climbing the stalks of the flowers to sip their 
honey. As these honey-laden ants go home, if they 
meet with an ant which has been doing other work 
and is hungry, the well-fed ant will squeeze honey 
out of her throat to feed her friend. For it seems to 
be a rule among ants that each one helps the other. 



And now you must watch day by day till you 
see a much more ^^onclerful thing. You will re- 
member that we saw in the first lesson little plant- 
lice called Aphides sucking juice out of the stalks 
of plants. But we did not notice that they have 
tw^o little horns at the end of their bodies. As 
they suck and suck they become too full, and the 
sweet juice often oozes out of these horns. You 
may see it standing in tiny drops on their tips. 

This juice is just what the ant loves, and you 
may be fortunate enough to see the garden-ant 
take it, because she brings the aphides and puts 
them on daisies near her nest. She goes up behind 
the aphis and strokes its sides with her antennae, 
so that it gives out a drop of honey from its horns. 

She has another her'? of these honey-cows 
safely hidden underground where you cannot see 
them. She carries them down into her galleries, 
and puts them on the roots of plants. There she 
takes care of them, just as she does of her own 
grubs, and keeps their eggs and young ones through 
the winter, ready for the next spring. In our cli- 
mate ants sleep through the winter, but in warmer 
countries they remain awake and store up food. 

When you are digging into the nest of a Garden- 
ant look very carefully at the roots you dig up, and 
you will most likely see some plant-lice on them. If 
you put them carefully back they will be none the 
worse, and the little ant will not have lost her 
honey-cows. 

There is a small yellow ant called the Meadow- 
ant, which lives in great numbers on heaths and 



meadows, and has no sting. She keeps nearly all 
her honey-cows underground, putting them on 
the roots of the grass. Sometimes when you ar€ 
ploughing up a field you may cut through one of 
these nests. If you do, stoj) a minute and watch 
the ants. Their first care will be for the ant-grubs 
and cocoons. But as soon as these are carried down 
you will see them fetching the little green plant-lice 
as carefully as if they were their own children. 

The Hill-ants do not bring their cows home. 
They visit them on the plants, and many battles 
between the ants of two nests begin because one 
colony has interfered with the other's cows. Then 
the working ants turn out of both nests and fall 
upon each other two and two, biting with their 
mandibles and standing on their hind legs, each 
trying to squirt formic acid over its enemy. These 
battles often go on for some days till one party is 
exhausted. 

The battles are fought, and the honey-cows are 
milked, by the working ants, of which there may 
be thousands in a large nest. The queen-ants do 
no work, beyond laying the eggs. There may be 
two or three queen-ants in a large nest, and they 
never quarrel like queen-bees. When they are 
laying eggs in the home they have no wings. But 
in the summer there will be a number of winged 
male and female ants growing up in the nest, and 
some warm day they fly out, and you may see 
them rising and falling in the air like gnats. 
Then they tumble helplessly to the ground and 
crawl about The m/^les are eaten by birds or die. 




None of them go back to the nest. Those of the 
females which are not killed have their wings pulled 
off by the workers, or pull them off themselves, and 
they go back to lay eggs, or join a new nest. 

Find any ants you can. Keep them a little, feeding them 
with honey and giving them some earth to build. Keep a few 
aphides on a plant to see the honey-drops. Examine an ant's 
nest by opening the side; put the aphides and cocoons back 
carefully.
