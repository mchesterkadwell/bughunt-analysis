CHAPTER I  THE NEST  To look at a housefly as it performs its figureof  eight dances in the air of our rooms or as it buzzes  against the windowpane vainly endeavouring to  dash its tender body through the firm and clear  glassy wallto mark how soon it comes into  existence and how soon its little day of life is  goneone would say it is a foolish and trifling  thing to write the history of an insects life but  any one who would thus speak must be ignorant  of that which he declares to be folly and trifling  He cannot know the miracles of skill that insects  insignificant as they seem are capable of per¬  forming nor the astonishing lessons of wisdom  which even man may learn from these minute and  shortlived beings So long as we are ignorant of  any part of Gods creation we may very probably  think light of it but when we come to inquire into  the things we have formerly despised and will give  a patient attention to what we before thought  beneath our notice the tone of our remarks will  greatly alter Now we shall find in the meanest  things formed by the Divine hand inexhaustible  themes for wonder and praise and innumerable  proofs that the great Almighty power which built  our round world and countless worlds besides  which fixed them with a firm decree in an appointed  course has not been less displayed even in the  formation of a tiny insect which is this hour alive  and the next lost to being  The telescope shows us what God has created in  the innumerable millions of stars and suns which  every clear night look down with gentle beams  upon the earth it shows us that the earth on  which we dwell compared to the worlds by which  it is surrounded is as a grain of sand to a mighty  mountain But the microscope on the contrary  shows us what is almost more wonderful even than  this for it shows us that though the High and Lofty  One who inhabits eternity has created all these vast  systems of suns and stars yet he has not thought  it beneath Him to chisel the egg of an insect or to  adorn the coat of a tiny caterpillar Well might we  pause and ask as we look now through the wonder  revealing tube of the microscope and then through  that of the telescopeWas it not a greater evidence  of power and wisdom to create clothe organize  and endow with the powers of life a little atom  which we can detect only by means of a powerful  microscope than to form even a great and mighty  world For our part then we think an insects  history as much a display of the wisdom and  infinite power of the Creator as the history of  such an enormous body as is the sun or any of  the large planets belonging to our system How¬  ever humble be the object which God has seen  fit to create let not any one think it beneath  him to examine The poet Thomson has written  some pretty lines which we shall venture to tran¬  scribe which with far greater beauty of language  than we can pretend to set before us the same  train of thought   Let no presuming impious railer tax  Creative wisdom as if aught was formed  In vain or not for admirable ends  Shall little haughty ignorance pronounce  His works unwise of which the smallest part  Exceeds the narrow vision of her mind  Animals birds reptiles fisli and plants have  had their biographers and ponderous books have  been written to give us an introduction to their  various families so also have insects although  despised by many they have been highly esteemed  by a few and if honours went by the size of books  written about them it might perhaps be shown  that the insects can boast of great and closely  printed books taken up with nothing else but an  account of them and their doings  Perhaps there is another feeling about insects  which ought to be mentioned beside the feeling of  contempt that is the feeling of aversion A great  many people ought we to write a great many  ladies and children are ready to scream and  take to their heels if they see a poor black  beetle racing in terror of his life for fear of them  and as both parties are equally frightened of one  another it becomes very difficult to manage a  reconciliation between them At the sight of  spiders some people are ready to faint away and  to see a little caterpillar creeping along with his  magnificent coat of particoloured hairs and with  that funny gait which it is quite ludicrous to behold  as he binds himself into a loop and walks after a  fashion like no other earthly being is enough to  make their hair stand on end and their flesh to creep  Sometimes insects are the innocent causes of  alarm even to nations Thus there is a peculiar  kind of moth upon the back of which there is  very distinctly marked the appearance of what is  Deathshead Moth  vulgarly called a deaths head its name being  the deathshead hawk moth represented in the  adjoining cut which was once the cause of the  greatest terror to a number of persons It was in  Bretagne that a large flight of them suddenly made  their appearance at the same time a dangerous  epidemic disease fell upon the inhabitants the  awful look of the poor insect together with its  strange supernatural noise filled the ignorant  people with alarm and the disease was considered  to be actually caused by the moths Another  insect the churchyard beetle which is of a jet  black colour is related by the great Linna3us as  producing the most alarming feelings upon the  minds of the superstitious and ignorant among the  peasantry of Sweden  The deathtick beetle has also a terrible repu¬  tation for frightening people This little creature  takes up its abode in decayed wood and thus  frequently makes the bedpost its dwellingplace  or ensconces itself in the wainscot of an old room  Now when as some entomologists tell us it wants  to give a signal to its mate the insect begins ham¬  mering with all its might at the side of the wall  or knocks upon its little floor until the noise is  heard and the mate then begins to hammer both  producing for their size a tremendous noise but  in human ears not sounding louder than the tick  of a large watch The poor invalid as he lies in  bed perhaps very nervous and unable to bear loud  conversation hears the noisy insects knocking one  to the other and immediately  his mind is filled with fears of  the most groundless kind which  the nurse if she is one of the  old school is sure to confirm by  telling him that this ticking is  the deathwatch  All this is not only very weak and foolish but  when it reaches the degree to which we have here  referred it is also very wrong As to the deaths  head hawk moth producing disease or foretelling  death and famine as it has been said to do how  weak and credulous must they be who draw such  omens from a mark on an insects head and how  dishonouring is it to the allwise providence of God  to imagine that he would suffer such a ridiculous  emblem to have any such actual signification  The little beetle which produces the ticking sounds  was caught by Dr Derham one fine sunshiny  day tapping as loudly as it could on a piece of  paper in a window he examined the little creatures  and kept them carefully and he states that during  the whole of one summer they scarcely ever ceased  tapping night and day Birds have their calls to  their companions and animals have theirs yet we  do not draw from these the wild supposition that  they foretell death or such like disasters Why  then should the lovetap of an insignificant beetle  have received such an interpretation It is hard  indeed to tell  Now all these feelings about insects contempt  abhorrence and terror arise in one common cause  and that is ignorance A very small acquaintance  with the contents of the little work upon which  we are now entering would suffice to dispel them  all It may be perhaps difficult to overcome  what is called a t natural aversion to any object  especially to an unfortunate insect but when it is  overcome and when we learn for the first time  all the extraordinary actions habits and instincts  of this portion of the great creation admiration  will take the place of contempt and even a  humble sort of affection that of the terror and  aversion produced by them before  With the readers permission then we will  proceed to take him with us as we describe the  various stages of the Life of an Insect from the  egg up to the perfect being It may be however  just necessary to premise that in so doing we shall  not give anything like the history of an individual  insect such for example as a fly or a bee but  shall describe in order some of the most interest¬  ing phenomena connected with insecthistory and  transformations generally Whither then must  we go to watch the awakening of life in the insect  We might ask the readers company to   where the pool  Stands mantled oer with green invisible  Amid the floating verdure millions stray  Here might we point to him that wondrous and  exquisite structure the lifeboat of eggs floating  securely on its silent surface or anchored perhaps  to the side of some pondplants slimy stem and  lingering here we might in a few days see the  little eggs become burst and give exit to a number  of minute creatures of great activity Some of them  would be seen twisting themselves about in a most  extraordinary manner and swimming here and  there through the still waters Or we might take  him to the depths of the forest and now under the  bark of some of the trees now upon their branches  now in little tents of leaves we could point out  many a colony of eggs only waiting for the life  giving influence of spring to burst into life and  activity  But it is better for us to proceed more sys¬  tematically and to notice shortly the interesting  facts which the science of entomology reveals to  us as to the eggcradles so to speak of insects  by which is meant the various localities selected  by them for the deposition of their eggs some of  them as we have mentioned in the water some in  the earth some upon plants and trees and some  in mansions made by the insects themselves for the  purpose of hatching their eggs  Let us come then and watch the great water  beetle at the time when the motherinsect is  about to commit her future offspring to the care  of the waters She is to be found on fine days  when the sun is going down into a bed of gold  enjoying herself and delighting in the pleasant air  of the evening as she sits upon a plant close by  the waters edge or she may even have taken up  her position on a floating leaf of the plant the clear  waters flowing gently beneath her She has been  in the water all day long and is now just emerged  On other evenings she will take wing and speed  her way whither no eye can follow but now she  has another and the most important duty of her  existence to perform and her customary evening  ramble is not permitted to interfere with its fulfil¬  ment On watching her closely we find her busy  at some selfimposed occupation what is its  nature To discover that she must be closely and  patiently watched At her tail are a couple of  spinning organs which move from right to left  and up and down with great swiftness all the  while a glutinous fluid which hardens into a  thread being discharged from each of them  With this apparatus the industrious insect is spin¬  ning a pouch not unlike the purses which were in  fashion before the long ones that ladies knit came  to be adopted This purse is three quarters of  an inch long it consists outside of a tissue like  parchment which is quite impervious to water  but is lined inside with the most beautiful light  downy material possible which is as white as  snow There is a sort of little horn to this pouch  which admits the air but the opening to which is  protected by a layer of cross threads which ex¬  cludes the wet In three hours of patient toil  12  this beautiful cradle is completed The water  beetle then safely secures it from being carried away  by the waters on which it floats so buoyantly by  fastening it by cables to the neighbouring plants  Here safely moored it rests until the eggs are  hatched soon after which the little creatures with¬  in escape into the waters out of the ark which has  during the period of their infancy safely preserved  them from every danger both of water and wind  The proceedings of the common gnat our  summer tormentor are no less interesting and  instructive Her actions have been closely watched  by the great Reaumur and are detailed by him with  very striking accuracy They require perhaps  sharper scrutiny than most of our readers are in  the habit of bestowing upon the actions of insects  but they well repay a patient and attentive ob¬  servation and subjects for the examination may  easily be found at the side of any pool in summer  The following is an outline of the difficulties the  insect has to contend with in depositing her eggs  First they must be hatched on the water but  2d her eggs are heavier than water and will  therefore sink if dropped into it one by one and  3d the eggs are so small and of so peculiar a shape  that it would be difficult to make them stand up¬  right on a solid surface far more so then on the  water A human shipbuilder would be probably  sorely puzzled to find out how to overcome these  difficulties and of such materials how to construct  a floating raft nay a raft which cannot by any  means be made to sink The insect has however  been instructed by a Greater and Wiser than man  and she solves the problem in a manner well calcu¬  lated to excite our admiration and praise Fixing  herself by her four front legs upon a leaf or twig  floating on the surface of the water she stretches  out behind her the two hind leos and crosses them  over one another somewhat in this manner Y In  the triangular space thus formed she purposes to  construct her boat of eggs Now all things being  ready just where the crossed legs meet she places  her first egg which is covered over with a thick  glue By the side of this she places another and  again another so that the three are by means of  the glue which covers them united together and  will consequently preserve the upright position  as there is now a sufficiently broad base of support  for them to rest upon To these she diligently  adds egg to egg until she has sufficiently formed  the shape of her boat after which she uncrosses  her legs and places them quite straight so as to  shape the sides of the boat When a sufficient  number of eggs have been thus glued together  the number varying from two to three hundred  the gnat considers her task as ended and wings  her way from the pool abandoning her ingenious  structure to the mercy of wind and wave although  not without the security of knowing that neither  wind nor wave could commit serious injury upon it   In shape write Messrs Kirby and Spence   this little boat pretty accurately resembles a  London wherry being sharper and higher to use  a nautical phrase fore and aft convex below and  concave above floating moreover constantly on  the keel or convex part But this they add fc is  not all it is besides a lifeboat more buoyant than  even Mr Greatheads The most violent agitation  of the water cannot sink it and what is more  extraordinary and a property still a desideratum  in our lifeboats though hollow it never becomes  filled with water even though exposed to the  torrents that often accompany a thunderstorm  To put this to the test I yesterday placed half a  dozen of these boats upon the surface of a tumbler  half full of water I then poured upon them a  stream of that element from the mouth of a great  bottle held a foot above them yet after this  treatment which was so rough as actually to  project one out of the glass I found them floating  as before upon their bottoms and not a drop of  water within their cavity  Some insects make the homes of their young  in the earth Of these the insect called the sand  wasp forms perhaps one of the most interesting  examples This insect selects generally a hard  sunny sandbank for the excavation it is about to  accomplish Armed with a pair of powerful jaws  by means of which the insect can break off good  sized fragments of the rock she is about to mine  she sets to her arduous undertaking with a bold  heart and it is not long before a tolerable cavity  is scooped out Many of our readers have seen  the manner in which human miners proceed when  they are forming a hole in a lime or other rock  for the purpose of blasting and must have noticed  that they are in the habit of using a little water  in order to facilitate the boring operation We  are all also familiar with the tale of Hannibal  chemically softening the Alpine rocks by means  of vinegar The little insect in question has  been instructed by the great Creator also to  adopt a means of shortening her labour for it  has been observed that she moistens the rock  by letting fall a drop or two of fluid upon it  from her mouth By this means her work goes  on rapidly The rubbish soon begins to accu¬  mulate It will be scarcely conjectured what  this patient labourer does with it Were we to  look narrowly at the sandbank which such wasps  Rubiish Towers of the SandWasp  frequent we should find on its surface a number  of curious little projections like horns rising from  the surface These are towers built by the sand  wasp of the pieces of rubbish which she scoops  out of her mine She cements them together and  instead of throwing them away she lays the masses  in regular order until they have assumed the ap¬  pearance here shown It has been supposed she  does this with a view to keep out enemies and to  keep her progeny cool just as in a tall house the  cellar is its coolest apartment so the height of the  tower in question seems to be an additional protec¬  tion against the rays of the scorching sun After  it has deposited its egg at the bottom of the exca¬  vation the sandwasp sets out on a foraging  expedition and hunts about until she finds certain  green caterpillars Seizing upon one of these she  flies with it to her mine and then returns for  more prey After collecting about a dozen of  these helpless beings fixing them so that they  are hopeless captives inside her dark prison she  bids farewell to the egg for the future wellbeing  of which she has thus assiduously provided She  takes down her tower of stones and with the  materials which composed it fills up the entrance  to the cell thus shutting in both the prisoners  and their future devourer in a common dungeon  there to await the changes which time will in¬  evitably bring about  Let us speak now of eggs carefully de¬  posited by other insects in galleries and excava¬  tions made into timber The insects which thus  act have been called by the fanciful title of car¬  penterbees in allusion to the drilling process  by which they penetrate the wood A highly  interesting spectacle it is in truth to see one  of these pigmy carpenters at her work and for¬  tunately some of the species are not very un¬  common in our gardens Spring is the season  when she commences her labours She recon¬  noitres about for a proper piece of timber for some  time and exhibits great discrimination in the  selection of a suitable place for establishing herself  and for the nurture of her progeny Strange to  say she will not select living wood such as the  trunk of a tree but generally prefers wood which  has already begun to decay as if fully aware that  such wood was likely to give her much less  trouble in boring than any other She also selects  a piece of wood placed in some sunny and genial  position with a view to the development and  comfort of her progeny This important point  being settled to her mind she next sets about the  work Well may Reaumur exclaim Truly the  labour she has undertaken demands strength  courage and patience  The violet carpenterbee is  perhaps the most interesting  example we can select She be¬  gins by cutting out with her  strong jaws small portions of the  timber and soon forms a little  hole which looks downwards and  inwards into the wood She then  alters the direction of her drilling  CarpenterBee  and now perforates the timber mndlv oflh Carr M  perpendicularly downwards and  in a parallel direction to the sides of the  wood Long and hard does she thus labour  until she has actually scooped out a tunnel in  the timber a foot or so in length and half  an inch in diameter Sometimes she will drill  several of these beautiful galleries in the wood  The task however arduous never seems to  weary her impelled by a heavenbestowed in¬  fluence she works strenuously and cheerfully for  weeks or even sometimes for months Our  readers may be interested to know what she does  with the sawdust If they can but get an op¬  portunity of watching her they will soon see her  mode of dealing with it Standing by the side of  the wood she is drilling and keeping our eyes sted  fastly fixed on the hole we shall presently observe  her head emerging from it and immediately after  she is seen to shovel out a little heap of the dust  which accumulates on the ground beneath into a  pile When her galleries are finished her labour is  yet far from accomplished She has now to deposit  her eggs and make provision for the prospective  wants of her young ones Now her eggs must  not be piled together nor be scattered about in  the same cavity The larvie which are to be pro¬  duced by them must each live in separation from  the others How is this fresh difficulty to be  overcome The insect soon supplies us with the  answer She has not forgotten her heap of saw¬  dust She first deposits an egg at the bottom of  the tunnel and then away she flies to the fields  for a load of the fine yellow dust of flowers called  pollen and also for honey She mixes these up  into a nice little mass of pollenbread or cake  which is intended for the food of the larva when it  comes out of the egg and then piles it up in the  gallery just over  the first egg She  then at a height  of about three  quarters of an  inch plaisters a  layer or ring of  sawdust made by  her into a sort of  mortar and adds  to this another and  another ring of the CMs °f carpenter b «»  same material until the ceiling is quite complete  and the cell thus formed is shut off from the rest of  the excavation by a circular plate of this substance  which effectually excludes all intercourse be¬  tween the occupants of this  wooden nursery Having  completed this cell she pro¬  ceeds in the same way to lay  an egg and to provide a store  of food and finally to close  in the rest of the gallery  until she has subdivided it into ten or twelve  Ceilingplate  separate apartments The appearance of the  circular ceilings formed on these ingenious prin¬  ciples is exhibited in the engraving annexed  One of the most striking facts  in connexion with the proceed¬  ings of this little creature has  yet to be brought under our  notice It will be readily ad¬  mitted that the first egg depo¬  sited at the bottom of the gallery  will be the first in point of time  that will be hatched and conse¬  quently the first to require to  make its escape from the wooden  prisonhouse of its birth How  is it possible for this to take  place when above the poor pri¬  soners head are ten or twelve  cells full of other occupants  and each shut in with a hard  ceiling and floor By referring  to the figure we obtain a clue  Section of Cells showing the  ways of escape  to this enigma It is here  seen that there are holes which communicate  with the tunnel within The uppermost of these  holes was the one by means of which the tunnel  was first formed but the two lower ones have  been expressly formed by the carpenterbee to  provide against the dilemma in which her young  would otherwise have been placed They form  as it were posterns or back doors by which when  the insect is perfected it is easily enabled to  make its escape Singular indeed it is that the  insects previous to passing into their last trans¬  formation arrange themselves with their heads  downwards so that every one of them generally  emerges at the socalled backdoor of the mansion  There are many similar instances in natural  history of the manifest wisdom and forethought of  the Creator of all things visible and invisible  but we may safely say there are not many which  show it in so clear and striking a point of view as  this It is to be remembered this industrious  insect in the arrangements in question does not act  from past experience She never saw her young  brood nor could learn of herself their wants and  dispositions yet her plans for their welfare are  as admirably contrived as if she had brought up  generation after generation under her own eye  and had learnt wisdom by the lapse of years  Plainly therefore her actions are all directed by  an impulse given her from God and we may well  exclaim with the wise king of old it is God who   doth instruct her to discretion and doth teach  her Altogether what an example of patience  and cheerfulness in her labours and of admirable  wisdom in their performance is presented to  us by this little sketch of the history of the  carpenterbees nest  Among the birds discovered in Australia is one  called the Bowerbird from its fondness for making  a bower which it ornaments in a very pretty  manner Other instances of a somewhat similar  kind could be mentioned tending to show that  some of the lower animals are as fond of decorating  their dwellings as we are ourselves There is how¬  ever in the insect world a little creature which has  been called the tapestrybee which adorns the  place where its progeny is to be born with a tapestry  as novel as it is elegant The great entomologist  whom we have before quoted thus describes his  first discovery of this interesting fact In one  of my rambles which had led me through several  lanes and in the course of which I had frequently  stopped to examine the little tunnels pierced in  the earth by various insects my companions began  to engage in the same occupation with myself  one of them at length perceived and pointed out  to my notice a tunnel which had some peculiarities  of appearance not possessed by the others we had  seen its interior seemed to be painted with ver¬  milion A small twig was immediately gently  pushed into it and with a knife we carefully  removed the earth which surrounded it taking  great care not to injure the walls of the tunnel  When we had uncovered it sufficiently it was  found that the little stick was buried in a tube  made of the leaves of the field poppy   I need scarcely say that during the remainder  of our ramble we were exclusively occupied in  searching for similar holes It is a common obser¬  vation that when a fact which has not hitherto  been recognised among those presented to us in  nature is once caught sight of we are almost sure  to see it again and again until we wonder how it  could have been that it was never noticed before  We therefore now found other holes leading to  similar tubes formed in the same manner of the  flowers of the red poppy Altogether before re¬  turning home we found seven or eight of them  and since that time I have found them in all their  different stages These elegantly decorated  apartments were subsequently found to belong to  the tapestrybee  This bee in forming the future abode of her  young begins by scooping out a burrow in some  pathway which she bores to the depth of two or  three inches She then smooths the walls of this  cavity and all being now ready for putting up  the hangings she betakes herself to the fields and  alights upon some freshexpanded poppy flower  just displaying its crimson cheeks to the light of  day Here she quickly plies the scissors which  she has been armed with for this purpose and in a  very short time cuts out of the bright petal on  which she rests a smooth portion of a definite size  She then returns home and by means of the  scissors and her legs she  cuts and smooths the  piece until it lays quite  flat upon the bottom of  her cell This done she  flies for more and in a  short time could we  peep in we might find  her mansion all over¬  spread with tapestry  more bright in colour  and more delicate in  point of finish and tex¬  ture than human art  can by possibility pro¬  duce The apartment  being thus not only de¬  corated but rendered  both to the eye and senses warm and comfort¬  able she then stores up in it a quantity of pollen  and honey until she has filled it to the height of  half an inch when she deposits the egg for wdiose  Poppyflower cut by the Bee  wants and as we might say even luxuries she  has thus elegantly provided folding some of the  hangings carefully over it The remainder of the  cavity is filled with loose earth  We have taken it for granted  in this account that the in¬  sect really takes a pleasure in  the brilliant colours with which  she ornaments her cell but it  is only right to say in addi¬  tion that we have of course  no positive proof that such is  really the case For aught we  know her motives may be very  different it is however an  amusing way to consider these actions be the ex¬  planation of them what it may  We fear however we dare not promise our  readers the same success as that which attended  M Reaumur and his companions It has been  thought that this interesting insect is not a native  of our island and it is certain it has not been  commonly observed amongst us but Mr Rennie  in his work on Insect Architecture says that at a  beautiful seabathing village in Ayrshire he once  found in a footpath a great number of the perfo¬  rations of the tapestrybee At all events they  deserve looking for  Although we have perhaps lingered long enough  over the insect cradle we must spare room for one  or two more remarks on this subject and it were  almost a shame while speaking thereon to omit  a notice of one of the most elegant cradles of all  one made with roseleaves As Reaumurs account  of the manner in which he first became acquainted  with these egg depositories is very pleasantly  written we shall extract the substance of it from  his work It was one day in July 1736 that a  gentleman of rank accompanied by his suite and  his gardener who was in a state of great alarm  waited upon an eminent naturalist in Paris The  gardener had left his masters countryseat near  Rouen to proceed with all haste to the metropolis  in order to communicate to his master the terrible  tidings that his ground was bewitched He had  the courage however to pick up the spells or  charms which the sorcerer had placed in the earth  and to carry them to his master in full belief that  they were sufficient to convince all the world of  the reality of the enchantment He had indeed  in the first instance taken them to the parish  priest begging his counsel and both came to the  same conclusionthat without doubt the garden  was now enchanted ground When the gentleman  saw the little things his gardener called charms  which are here  represented  he was much  perplexed al¬  though his  good sense led  him to ridicule  the idea of the  Leaf tubes bewitchment of  his property by such means He applied to his  medical adviser for a solution of this problem  but alas he was no entomologist and could  not enlighten him but he directed him to the  naturalist of whom mention has been made and  whose name was M Nollet On being admitted to  the presence of this gentleman the terrorstricken  gardener hastily put on the table the little rolls  of leaves he considered to be spells and which  had been made with some evil design as he  doubted not by the malevolent hands of some  sorcerer Fortunately M Nollet had in his mu¬  seum some rolls of leaves formed with equal art  by beetles he produced them and showed them  to the affrighted man assuring him that without  doubt they had been formed by insects and that  it was therefore highly probable that the rolls in  question were the productions of some other insects  of a different species The gardener looked incre¬  dulous being apparently unwilling to give up his  alarm until M Nollet greatly to his horror took  up one of those little leafrolls which had caused  him so much uneasiness and carefully unfolding  it drew from thence a fat little larva The  moment the gardener saw the little creature his  fears and troubled aspect vanished and an air of  cheerfulness spread over his face such as one  might imagine as the result of deliverance from  some fearful peril The only reward M Nollet  would receive from the poor man for thus dissi¬  pating his cares and fears was that he should leave  the leafrolls with him and collecting more of  them should send them to M Reaumurs address  for him to examine This little anecdote affords  us a good illustration of the connexion of super¬  stitious fears with ignorance on points of natural  history and sets before us in wellrelieved contrast  the foolish terrors of the unlearned gardener with  the collected bearing of the learned naturalist  Would that this anecdote stood alone in the  records of natural history We have already seen  that it does not and that the most groundless  apprehensions have taken their rise in the most in¬  nocent and trifling of natural causes  By and by after a little careful investigation  the true artificer of these spells was discovered  and proved to be a lowly insect which has been  since called the roseleafcutter bee On closer  examination these rolls of leaveswhich are  almost as long and as large as a toothpick case  were found to be made up of six or seven cells  each separate from the rest placed end to end  and covered with a common coating of leaves  The manner in which the roll is formed is as  followsThe insect sometimes makes a perfora¬  tion in decayed wood sometimes in the well  trodden earth of a footpath this she drives to  the depth of perhaps nine inches and she then  proceeds to hang this apartment with its green  tapestryfor it must be understood it is not the  leaves of the flower but of the stem of the rose  treeor in otlier words the green leaves that  she selects for this purpose The insect alights  upon what she considers to be a suitable leaf and  begins with her sharp jaws to cut out a piece of a  crescent form from its edge When she has cut  perhaps halfway round or rather more she sets  her wings in motion so as to keep her balanced in  the air lest she should drag away the halfcut  piece before it was properly divided  from the leaf When cut she places  it in a perpendicular position be¬  tween her legs and flies away with  it to her cell She then simply  folds it into a proper form and The Bee with a lea fcut  overlays the cell walls with this leafy covering  not using any cement to make it retain its form  but relying upon the natural elasticity of the leaf  to keep it close pressed against the wall in the  manner in which she places it Repeating this  process several times she finally completes each  cell with exquisite art and care and taking the  precaution of arranging all her joints and seams so  that they shall not present themselves in the same  place but covering them over with pieces of leaf  so as to strengthen them and in many other  respects exibiting an amount of mechanical and  mathematical skill never sufficiently to be admired  she now deposits the minute egg in it which is to  become the toilsome busy patient and clever being  the fullgrown insect of her own species Mind¬  ful of its future wants she then compounds a  delicate mass of pink conserve which she collects  from thistles and subsequently stops up each cell  with thin pieces of leaf as exactly round as if  they had been cut out with a punch or by means  of some mathematical instrument  Reaumur says he often in the month of May  on looking at his rosetrees detected these insects  at their work all he had to do was to stand and  patiently watch by the side of a tree the leaves of  which exhibited the singular marks made by this  insect Many times have the same appearances  arrested our attention and without doubt that of  the reader The spectacle of insect ingenuity  which it affords well promises to repay a little  exertion in endeavouring to find out the nest to  which the pieces are conveyed and some neigh¬  bouring post or footpath will probably discover it  to us after a sharp scrutiny Sometimes the insect  makes a bad choice of a leaf it may be perhaps  too tough for her but she soon discovers her  mistake and leaves it half cut to seek a better on  the same branch  A Rosebranch cut by the Bee  The nest formed by a species of moth for depo¬  siting her eggs in is one equally interesting to  describe From the resemblance of her actions to  the wellknown account of those of the eiderduck  whose maternal love strips her breast of down for the  purpose of protecting her eggs we might almost  venture to call this moth the eidermoth were it not  that it is known under another and far less appro¬  priate namethe gipsymoth Indeed in the care  of the insect the mothers love is as we might say  even more powerful than in the bird for while  the latter has the pride and pleasure of seeing her  little ones grow up around her the poor insect after  stripping herself of her own soft warm down thus  testifying her love to her offspring even to death  presently expires The insect in forming her nest  first plucks off by means of a singular instrument  like a pair of tweezers with which she is provided  a little portion of down from her body seated  upon a tree she attaches this to its trunk and then  deposits an egg in it which immediately adheres  to the down and becomes coated with it The  remainder of her operations until she has depo¬  sited the entire number of eggs are but repetitions  of the same actions When the process is at an  end she begins to form a regular tile or covering  to her nest and this she effects with a degree  of skill not unworthy of the most consummate  thatcher She arranges the hairs of the down  just as the thatcher does his stems of straw  for the cottage roof so that they all slope down  The Nest fo the Gipsymoth  wards resembling much the smooth pile of a hat  By this arrangement of the down it is next to  impossible that in the most drenching shower the  eggs warmly wrapped up within should be wetted  or otherwise injured and the down itself being a  material which as we all know is a nonconductor  preserves the eggs from the influence of the most  severe frosts In shape this nest of eggs resembles  a skittle or a truncated cone the broad end down¬  wards The engraving represents this form and  also shows the insect at work constructing the nest  Let us now pass on to mention that many eggs  are deposited without any special protection of the  kind we have described and without what would  be with propriety termed  a nest A moth called  the lackey moth fre¬  quently ornaments the  young twigs of trees  in our gardens with  exquisite bracelets of  glistening white eggs  looking like beads From  two to three hundred of  these eggs are glued on  Eggs of Lackeymoth  Natural sige and magnified  by the insect around the twig by means of a  tenacious waterproof cement and are arranged  with an accuracy of the most marvellous cha¬  racter in a close spiral line upon the twig  The cement employed by the insect in uniting  her eggs and in varnishing them over is so  hard as to serve the purpose of a covering  which admirably casts off the rain and preserves  the eggs free from injury by the elements all the  winter long Many eggs are simply glued on  irregularly upon the stems and leaves of plants  their shells or outer coating together with the  protecting varnish being sufficient to preserve  them from the inclemencies of the weather but  some are piled together with the most striking  regularity in regular columns of eggs  In addition to these it is proper to state that  some insects lay their eggs in the body of the  young of others Of these those which are most  dreaded by the insect tribe are the little but  terrible flies called Ichneumons They are so  called because in their actions they agree with the  popular account of those of the ichneumons of  Egypt which were venerated as the destroyers of  the eggs of serpents and crocodiles Such say  Messrs Kirby and Spence is the activity and  address of the ichneumons that scarcely any con  cealment except perhaps the waters can secure  their prey from them and neither bulk courage  nor ferocity avail to terrify them from effecting  their purpose They attack the ruthless spider in  his toils they discover the retreat of the little  bee that for safety bores deep into timber and  though its enemy the ichneumon cannot enter its  cell by means of her long ovipositor organ for  depositing the egg she reaches the helpless grub  which its parent vainly thought secured from  every foe and deposits in it an egg which pro¬  duces a larva that destroys it In vain does the  destructive cecidomia of the whecit conceal its larva  within the glumes that so closely cover the grain  three species of these minute benefactors of our  race sent in mercy by Heaven know how to in¬  troduce their eggs into them thus preventing the  mischief they would otherwise occasion and saving  mankind from the horrors of famine In vain  also the cynips by its magic touch produces the  curious excrescences on various trees and plants  called gulls for the nutriment and defence of its  progeny This parasite insect discovers its secret  chamber pierces its wall however thick and  commits the destroying egg to its offspring In  vain also might we add does the sandwasp  excavate her deep cell for her young ones for  when once the ichneumon has discovered the  retreat the destruction of the young larvas is  inevitable She pierces through the defences  piled over the mouth of the cavity with all the  precision and patience of a higher creature and  rests not until she has thrust down her long  ovipositor and placed the egg in the body of the  helpless prisoner below when she flies away con¬  fident that the days of her victim are numbered  and having thus doomed him to be eaten up alive  The common caterpillar which by its ravages in  our cabbage rows makes itself a little too familiar  to us has a fierce enemy in these flies they dart  upon it pierce its body in many places laying an  egg in each wound these in due time become  hatched and eat their way out of the body of the  poor caterpillar who soon dies while the larva  after undergoing their proper transformations  become perfect insects themselves fully equipped  to proceed to the same work in some other indi¬  vidual of the caterpillar kind  To man this ordinance of the Creator that  some insects should lay their eggs in the bodies  of others and so destroy them is of inestimable  benefit It is quite impossible to imagine what  would be the result were weevils caterpillars  and such like insects to be permitted to multiply  without a check Produce of all kinds would soon  be consumed and the desolations of an universal  famine would overwhelm man and beast But  God has been pleased to ordain it otherwise In  proportion to the increase of the destroyers is the  increase of those that prey upon and destroy them  Thus what has been well called the balance of  creation is preserved and by means of the insects  in question conjoined to other causes is the  command to the destroying powers enforced   Hitherto shall ye come but no farther  CHAPTER IT  STRUCTURE AND CONTENTS OF THE EGG  In the past pages we have now considered  shortly the various methods of depositing the eggs  of insects and have seen that the nursing place  where the young being is produced differs widely  both in point of its position and of the external  circumstances which variously affect it For some  are the deepbored galleries in timber for some  the hardwrought tunnel scooped by an insect out  of a rock for some the ingeniouslyformed boat or  raft which is to carry its cargo of life buoyant on  the dancing waters all the days of its appointed  time waiting until its change come for some  the cell of earth lined with painted hangings  exquisite in make and colour for some the little  leafcase curiously folded together but for others  none of those works of insect art are provided  they hid in a rainproof covering of varnish lie  open to every eye or scattered here and there on  all and every kind of flower and herbage lie at  the mercy of every wandering foot While lastly  others are buried with a cruel yet merciful art  in the bodies of myriads of unsuspecting members  of the insect community lying like the seeds of  evil in the heart of the infant dormant awhile  but destined to grow with its growth and to  strengthen with its strength  The time has therefore now come that we  should speak a little more particularly upon the  nature and character of the eggs of insects The  shape of an insects egg although frequently  something of an oval in its outline is very various  in fact were the egg of some peculiar species  placed in the field of a microscope probably not  one general observer out of a hundred could in  the least imagine what the object at which he was  looking really was Sometimes they are oval and  exactly resemble the form of the egg of the bird  but in other instances they are of the most irre¬  gular and fantastic appearance Some look like  pillboxes tied over and down their sides with  string others look like tiny flasks with many  raised ribs upon their surface others have  lids and springs The gnats egg resembles a  chemists phial or one of the new bottles for  holding aerated waters and those of the dungfly  Various forms of Eggs  have two little pieces sticking out at the top on  each side to prevent them sinking too deep into  the matter upon which they are deposited  The eggs of some insects strikingly resemble  the little shells like turbans with which we are  most of us familiar A very singular variety of  egg which has often caused much perplexity to  naturalists is the egg of the lacewinged fly Reau  mer says I had observed them several years  without actually knowing what they were Others  as well as myself had noticed that on the leaves  and twigs of many trees were a number of minute  stalks placed together scarcely as thick as a hair  their colour was nearly white and they were  about an inch in length there were sometimes  ten or twelve placed in a bunch the end of each  stalk bore a small head of an egglike or oblong  figure They ap¬  peared to me to be  fungi the little head  precisely resem¬  bling the appear¬  ance of moulds as  seen under the mi¬  croscope but they  were larger in size  They were in fact  the eggs of the fly  in question When  the larva escapes  from them they  have much the ap¬  pearance of little  vases and the same  Eg SS or Lacewinged Fly author assures US  that they were once described and engraved by a  naturalist as some curious minute flower growing  on the leaves of the elder for which he was unable  to account The representation of them in the  cut will enable the reader to form his own opinion  as to the difficulty of ascertaining whether they  were flowers or the nests of an insect  The manner in which these eggs are thus regu¬  larly placed by the insect is interesting Placing  herself upon the  leaf in the atti¬  tude represent¬  ed she fastens a  thread to the  leaf draws it out  in the same way  as a spider does  her lines and  when it has got  sufficiently firm  the wise insect  then puts forth  the egg glueing Manner of depositing the Egg  it to the extre¬  mity of the stalk this done she quits it and begins  to form another repeating the same actions until  the proper number is laid Poised on the summit  of these slender pillars the eggs are secure from  every invader but man himself and in time there  comes from them the larva which is to become the  beautiful insect the ts lacewinged fly in all the  elegance of its form  From what has been already stated the surface  of the eggs of insects it will be perceived is by  no means in all cases smooth and polished as in  the case of birds Far otherwise To look at  some of them by the help of a magnifying glass  we should imagine that they were covered with  very fine lace net others appear as if some clever  engraver had been chasing some intricate design  upon their surface The eggs of a species of  butterfly are studded over with an infinite number  of little knots or tubercles and those of another  are capped at the top with sculptured work dis¬  posed in the form of a circular tiling or roof to  the egg Some also closely resemble embossed  buttons  He who has thus adorned these minute objects  with beauty of form and carving has likewise  bestowed upon them the most beautiful and  variegated colours colours such as no human  art can imitate But from the small size of the  eggs it is difficult to appreciate this beauty in  them except when they occur in a mass The  most common tints are white yellow and green  but the richer and rarer hues are also to be found  amono them Thus the eggs of a moth are of a  beautiful blue colour banded in the most delicate  manner by three zones or rings of brown the  contrast being very pleasing Another moth which  loves to deposit its eggs in the bark of the willow  produces them tinged with a purple more delicate  than ever Tyrian lady wore as the finest produce  of the dyers art In the deep crevices of the bark of  the elm and only therefore to be found by sharp  scrutiny another moth lays eggs of a lovely pink  Messrs Kirby and Spence write We remember  once being much surprised at seeing the water at  one end of a canal in our garden as red as blood  upon examining it further we found it discoloured  by an infinite number of minute red eggs Some¬  times eggs are spotted and thus resemble the eggs  of many birds and strange to say sometimes  they change colour in a very remarkable manner  so that as far as colour is concerned an observer  could scarcely believe that the egg was the same  he beheld perhaps a few days previously The  eggs of the chameleon fly as we are told by the  gentlemen last quoted are at first pure white  then change to green and finally turn to a deep  olivegreen Others are at first mousecoloured  then reddish and lastly black The eggs of a  kind of moth we have seen first of the colour of  sulphur then becoming green after that rose  colour and lastly black In the instances of the  common gnat and silkworm similar changes  of colour take place The eggs of the gnat are  first white then green and finally gray and those  of the silkworm are in the first instance of a  pale yellow and ultimately take on a violet tint  Having thus noticed these points in connexion  with we are led to that  most important of all periods the dawn of life  in the egg or in common terms the period of  hatching But before proceeding to the sub¬  ject may we not pause and wonder as we behold  the varied manifestations of the Creators wisdom  in the actions of the minute and as we often call  them insignificant creatures of whom we have  spoken Should David say when he beheld the  sun moon and stars as the work of a Divine  hand Lord what is man that thou considerest  him or the son of man that thou regardest  him And shall not we as we contemplate the  few particulars here set down of the wonders of  insectlife exclaim with even greater astonish¬  ment What are these that thou considerest  them Let no one then say that entomology or  any other natural science whose field of study lies  chiefly among the minute portions of creation are  profitless sciences when they can reveal to us such  a display of the power wisdom and love of God  as is exhibited even in this small portion of the  Life of an Insect  Let us then take up one of these eggs so  minute but containing within it the rudiments of  a being which is in time to assume a form of con  siderable magnitude by comparison and to be  adorned with colours richer than art can boast of  and let us examine it on the field of a tolerably  powerful microscope We need not look far for a  specimen In the dark corner of the ceiling in a  neglected room after removing the mass of dust  filled webs that have accumulated there for months  we may find without difficulty a spiders nest of  eggs A more pleasant place to search for insects  eggs is perhaps the garden and if in the crevices  of the bark of the trees or attached to twigs  or branches none can be found we can almost  certainly promise success if the reader will care¬  fully and patiently  search the angles of  the garden walls par¬  ticularly if he has  noticed in the pre¬  ceding autumn many  of the beautiful webs  of the gardenspider  There in some shel¬  tered recess where  the pattering rain¬  drops may be heard  but never venture in  Nests of Garden Spider  and where few eyes would detect them may be  found little round yellow balls of the size of a  small cherry made of the most beautiful golden  coloured silk and attached by a slender stalk to  the wall or perhaps to a twig Sometimes they  exhibit the more elegant and curious appearance  shown in the figure on the next page resembling  an inverted wineglass or pear  On taking our prize indoors by the aid of a  very sharp penknife we may succeed in cutting it  smoothly open and in turning out some of the deli  cate eggs which lie warmly covered up at the bottom  Taking one of them up on the point of the knife and  laying it on the microscopefield we shall be able to  see something of the anatomy of an insects egg  First we may notice what seems  to be the shell that is the outer  covering of the egg This is very dif¬  ferent to the hard calcareous egg¬  shell of birds It is stated not to con¬  tain any lime in its composition as  the shells of birds do for when the  eggs of insects are put into very  weak sulphuric acid and water which  would act on the lime if it were pre¬  sent in their composition they are not  affected by it Although therefore  some eggs of insects are very hard  so hard indeed as to resist severe pres¬  sure with the nail they do not owe  their hardness as do the eggs of  birds to any lime in their chemical  composition The outer coat or shell is  apparently simply membraneous frequently vary¬  ing greatly in thickness being sometimes as dense  and horny as we have mentioned and at others so  delicate as to burst with the gentlest touch  Could we now do wliat it is so easy to do with  the egg of a fowlcarefully take off a little portion  of this outer shell we should be able to inspect  its contents more accurately But in the case of  most who read this book this extremely delicate  task will prove after many trials probably a hope¬  less failure Let us state therefore what some  expert and talented observers have found within  the insects egg It appears then that although  there is both a yolk and a white in the  tiny egg before us that they are not quite so  distinct as in the bird Yet they are sufficiently  separate from one another to make their differ¬  ences complete Probably the reader has noticed  in the hens egg a little round spot in the middle  of the yolk or yellow portion from this the  future bird is produced Although from their ex¬  treme minuteness it is difficult to detect anything  of this kind in the eggs of insects some observers  state they have seen a similar little spot in them  also Thus M Herold says that in the eggs of  the very insect whose nest we have robbed the gar¬  den spider this little spot can be seen as a minute  white point immediately under the shell and  in the middle of its circumference This was seen  by holding it up to the light and the spot was  more carefully examined by gently pressing the  contents of a spiders egg upon a watchglass  Mr Rennie says that the point where the cater¬  pillar originates answering to the scar in the eggs  of birds we can readily distinguish even by the  naked eye in the larger species of eggs as it lies  always immediately under the shell But it may  be doubted whether without the assistance of  some one versed in entomology many who make  the same attempt will succeed So much depends  in looking at any object upon whether we know  what to look for or not so that things which are  as clearly seen as possible by the eyes of the  initiated are not seen at all by any others To  perceive some things in natural history and many  in science the senses of sight hearing and touch  require to be well educated and they then become  apparent enough  And is this all that we can mention about the  structure of an egg This indeed is all Can it  be possible Is there no striking and broad differ¬  ence to mark the nature of the future insect Is  the egg of a spider the same in the number and  nature of its parts as that of a butterfly or the  egg of a gnat as that of a beetle Surely as we  should imagine there must be some important  differences between these otherwise why such  immense differences in the perfect insect Could  any one imagine that a grasshopper and a house  fly so strangely unlike each other in their perfect  forms originated in eggs to either of which the  same description of an insects egg would accu¬  rately answer and leave nothing out However  great our amazement the fact is uncjuestionable  The egg of every insect at first consists of an outer  covering a white a yolk and the little spot we  have alluded to We might have thought that in  creating so many different species of insects which  differ so surprisingly in form as the insect tribes  do the great Creator would have formed their  eggs essentially different too But except in the  matter of shape all are originally alike and the  wisest philosopher is unable to inform us of any  essential difference in the eggs of insects at first  The eye of God who knows the end from the  beginning sees some difference inappreciable to  the eye of man He said to this kind Cf Be thou  thus and to that Be thou different but until  the time comes when the young insect is much  more advanced it is not possible for us to recog¬  nise those marks of variety which His hand has  laid upon them from the beginning  CHAPTER III  LIFE BEGINS IN THE EGG  The eggs of birds are in most instances hatched  by the warmth of the mother who sits for a cer¬  tain time covering them with her wings and  downy breast But the exception to the rule in  insects is that the mother has anything to do with  rearing her young brood the cases in which this  takes place will be noticed in our next chapter  Generally speaking the eggs of insects are hatched  by the increasing temperature of the air in spring  The following sketch extracted from Mr Darwins  interesting Journal of the Voyage of the Beagle  sets before us in a very pleasing manner the  awakening influence of this season to all nature   When we first arrived at Bahia Blanca Sep¬  tember 7th 1832 we thought nature had granted  scarcely a living creature to this dry and sandy  country By digging however in the ground  several insects large spiders and lizards were  found in a halftorpid state On the 15th a few  animals began to appear and by the 18th three  days from the equinox everything announced the  commencement of spring the plains were orna¬  mented by the flowers of a pink woodsorrel wild  peas oenotherce and geraniums and the birds  began to lay their eggs Numerous beetles were  crawling about while the saurian tribe the con¬  stant inhabitants of a sandy soil darted in every  direction  As to the torpid animal and buried seed so to  the carefully laid up egg the returning warmth of  the air is the signal for the commencement of life  The winterclouds roll reluctantly back as the  genial days of spring advance and the changes  which are to have their accomplishment in the  production of a living being out of the minute  object before us are set in movement as the days  grow bright and pleasant That the hatching of  the egg in most cases is due chiefly to the stimu¬  lating influence of heat is now well ascertained  The schoolboy who has ever amused himself with  silkworms can well assure us of this fact for he  is in the habit of hatching the insects eggs by  carefully wrapping them in paper and keeping  them in his waistcoatpocket where they have all  the comfort and warmth of his body to bring them  forward In countries where the silkworm is  reared women carry them in their bosom and by  this means cause the young larva to come forth  from the eg in much less time than it would  naturally occupy By removing a twig of a plant  upon which in the preceding autumn an insect  may have been found to have deposited its eggs  into a warm room an opportunity will be had of  putting this operation practically to the test In  a short time it will be found that the eggs are all  hatched and that a number of minute larvae are  crawling actively about while their brethren in  the snowcovered fields are yet safely asleep in the  shell  On the other hand eggs which would otherwise  be hatched the same year are arrested by the ad¬  vancing cold of the winter season and are now  compelled to wait until the ensuing spring before  their time of hatching arrives Evidently there¬  fore to the commencement of  the condition of the external temperature is an all  important consideration Before proceeding imme  diately to consider the nature of the changes it  may be mentioned as an interesting fact that  although the eggs of insects are very quickly  sensible of a slight increase of heat and in con¬  sequence of its application to them very soon  begin to live yet they will endure the most  severe degrees of cold almost without inj ury As  an illustration of this point we may transcribe a  few sentences from a paper by the great Spallan¬  zani upon this subject  The year 1709 when the thermometer fell  to 1° Fahrenheit or thirtyone degrees below  freezing point is celebrated for its rigour and its  fatal effects on plants and animals Who can  believe exclaims Boerhaave 4 that the severity  of this winter did not destroy the eggs of insects  especially those exposed to its influence in the  open fields on the naked earth or on the branches  of trees Yet when the spring had tempered  the air these eggs produced as they usually did  after the mildest winters He adds further on I  have exposed eggs to a more rigorous trial than  the winter of 1709those of several insects and  among others the silkworm moth and elmbut¬  terfly were enclosed in a glass vessel and buried  five hours in a mixture of ice and rocksalt the  thermometer falling 6° below zero In the middle  of the following spring however caterpillars  came from all the eggs and at the same time as  from those which had suffered no cold In the  following year I submitted them to an experiment  still more hazardous A mixture of ice and rock  salt with the burning spirit of nitre reduced the  thermometer 22° below zero that is 23° lower  than the cold of 1709 or 52° lower than the  point at which water freezes They were not  injured as I had evident proofby their being  hatched  When it is known that many seeds will not  endure these degrees of cold without injury and  those even of some tolerably hardy plants it is the  more surprising to find such apparently delicate  and readily damaged objects as the eggs of these  members of the insect tribe thus resisting an in¬  tensity of cold to Avhich in a state of nature they  are scarcely ever exposed It is impossible to  assign any rational explanation of these singular  facts It is undoubtedly owing to this power of  resisting the generally deadly influence of extreme  cold that we find insects reappear in spring even  in countries where the winter is much prolonged  and is of extreme severity Thus in Lapland we  should have probably thought that the rigour of  the climate would have been fatal to all insects in  winter in any condition whether in the egg or  in other forms but as the poor inhabitants know  to their cost it is far different The mosquitoes  swarm in that country in numbers so prodigious  that they have been compared to a fall of snow or  to the dust of the earth The wretched natives  cannot take a mouthful of food or lie down to  sleep in their cabins unless they are fumigated to  a degree almost dangerous to life They fill the  mouth and nostrils and minute though they are  render existence almost a burden by their blood¬  thirsty propensities Not even thick plasters of  the most offensive compoundstar oil and grease  are sufficient to shield the Laplanders skin from  their attacks The great John Hunter considered  that this power of resisting cold was in some un¬  explained manner connected with the existence of  a living principle in the egg which had the effect  of withstanding a degree of cold that would other¬  wise have been fatal to it but after all this is  only an apology for an explanation When we  are unable to clear up tlie difficulties of a natural  history question like this although we cannot  explain we are not prohibited from admiring and  can clearly perceive that in thus endowing the  eggs of insects with a selfpreservative power  God has manifested his wisdom and forethought  for had it been otherwise the lapse of a few seasons  would have depopulated the insect world leaving  us it is true without a gnat or a mosquito to  annoy us but also without a silkworm or a bee  to supply us with the precious products of insect  industry  The frosts have disappeared the air brightens  the sun loses its pale aspect and glows with a  more golden face The days lengthen the breeze  has lost its penetrating chilliness gentle showers  descend and water the earth and there is a general  voice heard all over creation Spring has come  The eggs of a thousand insect species have already  perceived its presence and the newlyawakened  beings within hasten to welcome it by bursting  from the shell their long occupied but now for ever  forsaken dwellingplace Sometimes the young  larva bursts through the thin walls of the shell  by main force or eats its way through by means  of its jaws which is occasionally a task of many  hours duration In many instances however  write Messrs Kirby and Spence cc the larva is  spared this trouble one end of the egg being fur¬  nished with a little lid or trapdoor which it has  but to force up and it can then emerge at pleasure  Such lids are to be found in the eggs of several  butterflies and moths The eggs of a species of  bug besides a convex lid are furnished with a  very curious machine as it would seem for throw  ins it off This machine is dark brown of a  horny substance and of the shape of a crossbow  the bowpart being attached to the lid or pushing  against it and the handle by means of a mem¬  brane to the upper end of the side of the egg  But if in our account of the various attendants  on the opening of spring we had mentioned every  circumstance that takes place at that time alas  for any poor insects or at least for a large  number of them who should be hatched at that  time The warm air and gentle shower and  brighter sky would ill satisfy them in the absence  of all food and they would be born by a cruel  destiny only to starve and die We well know  this is not the case but there are probably few  persons who have ever thought much upon the  admirable arrangement by which the occurrence  of such a calamity to many of the insect tribes is  avoided We need scarcely remind the reader  that in the opening sentence of the last paragraph  there is one most important omission in the sketch  of the phenomena of returning spring that is that  there is no mention of what takes place in plants  of the putting forth of their young and tender  leaves Now as a majority of insects in the larva  state are vegetablefeeders we can easily under¬  stand that the unfortunate little beings if hatched  before the appearance of leaves would without  doubt quickly perish for lack of proper food Yet  the returning warmth of the air is all that is requisite to call the insect into existence and if by the  time it is ready to burst from the shell there is not  food all prepared for it it must die The difficulty  has been beautifully provided for and perhaps  few other instances of the wisdom of the Creator  in forming the insect world are so full of instructive thought as this It has been ordained then  that soon as winter is over the plant is first to  obey the voice of spring and to awake and the  bursting buds on its lower boughs are already full  charged with sap long before the young insect  being that is to be fed therewith has left the  shelter of the egg  One of the talented authors of the Introduction  to Entomology relates a pleasing anecdote in reference to this simple yet admirable arrangement  and mutual adjustment of these two eventsthe  awakening of life in the plant and in the insect   On the 20th of February 1816 observing the  twigs of the birches in the Hull Botanic Garden  to be thickly set especially about the buds with  minute oval black eggs of some insect with which  I was unacquainted I brought home a small  branch and set it in my study in which is a fire  daily to watch their exclusion On the 28th of  March I observed that a numerous brood of  aphides had been hatched from them and that two  or three of the lower buds had expanded into  leaves upon the sap of which they were greedily  feasting This was full a month before either a  leaf of the birch appeared or the egg of an aphis  was disclosed in the open air Thus showing that  the coming to life of the branch and of the insects  resting on it was beautifully arranged to take  place each at the proper time  It is very singular to add that as some trees  acquire their leaves earlier or later than others  the eggs of insects which are deposited on them  never are hatched before the leaves appear even  while some of their companion eggs of a different  species and placed therefore on different trees  may have long since sent their young into the  world Thus we learn that not only has God  been pleased to arrange generally the hatching of  the eggs of insects and the putting forth of the  leaves of trees so that the latter shall precede the  former but it has also been ordered that the eggs  deposited on each particular plant shall be hatched  just when the time of that plants putting forth its  leaves shall arrive at whatever period that may  be This may be more readily comprehended by  an example thus there is no difference so far  as we can perceive between the eggs of the little  insects just mentioned as feasting on the leaves  of the birch and those whose food is the leaf  of the ash yet the birch will be in leaf nearly  a month before the ashtree and the eggs depo¬  sited on it will therefore be hatched a month  before those placed upon the ash although both  trees are in the same position with regard to  warmth and may even perhaps be within a yard  or two of one another What a beautiful and  mysterious link is this between events so disproportionately important as the clothing of a great  tree with its leafy garments and the coming to life  of a little throng of beings whose dwellingplace  is a small twig and whose world a green leaf  Yet it was not too insignificant a matter for Him to  arrange whose dwellingplace is eternity and who  takes up the islands as a very little thing Does  God take thought for these and will He not  much more care for and arrange well every event  in the lives of his faithful children Surely yes  Speaking generally the time taken up in  hatching the eggs of insects is very variable It is  a general rule that the eggs which are laid in the  autumn must abide the return of spring before  they will be hatched But when eggs are de¬  posited in the summer they are often hatched in a  very short time The eggs of the paintedlady  butterfly are hatched in about eight days those of  the ladybird in a little less from five to six days  the eggs of another species of butterfly occupy a  month those of spiders three weeks those of bees  only three days and those of the meatfly shorter  than anyonly a few hours it has even been stated  that in very warm weather the eggs of the meat¬  fly will be hatched in about two hours In most  of these cases much depends upon the weather  but even this does not operate beyond certain  limits for it has been said that in the month of  June even if silkworms eggs were placed in  an icehouse they would be hatched in spite of the  cold but this observation deserves to be repeated  It would be impossible to make the exact nature  of the changes which take place in the egg from  first to last easily understood in a work of this  kind They have occupied the laborious in¬  vestigation of talented observers with the highest  powers of the microscope and although much is  now known on the subject it is of a nature too  abstruse to be dwelt upon in our unpretending  volume As we may well imagine the changes  are wonderful indeed which from a little drop of  fluid matter contained perhaps in a shell not  larger than a pins head end in the development  of the living and active larva who makes his  speedy escape out of his shellcradle But they  must be studied in the scientific treatises which  are written upon this subject and they are so  interesting as amply to repay the task of investi¬  gation It may be added however as a curious  fact that contrary to the general rule in the egg  of birds some of the eggs of insects actually grow  larger before they are hatched and frequently the  shape alters also  In our account of the nests made by insects  for their eggs the examples quoted although they  furnished us with many proofs of a mothers care  and forethought on the part of the insect yet there  was no instance given of anything like the solicitude displayed by the hen over her eggs Are  there then no anxious mothers concerned in the  wellbeing of their eags anions insects also In  the next chapter some instances of a mothers care  over the young larvse will be given and before  we conclude the present mention may be made of  some interesting observations upon this subject  made by the eminent naturalist M Bonnet The  insect upon which his observations were made was  the spider so commonly found on turning up a  log of wood in the fields or a clod of earth She  carries her eggs about with her in a little round  white pouch of silk attached to her body Well  has it been said Never miser clung to his  a spiders mothers love  treasure with more tenacious solicitude than this  spider to her bag Though apparently a con¬  siderable incumbrance she carries it with her  everywhere M Bonnet found that he could  not beat away the affectionate creature from her  treasure and on forcibly removing it from her she  instantly lost her ferocious aspect and became tame  In this emergency she stops to look around her  and begins to walk at a slow pace and searches dili¬  gently on every side for her lost eggs nor will she  fly if threatened by the bystander If however  out of compassion the bag is restored to her she  darts forward catches it up with all the intensity  of a mothers love and runs away with it as fast  as possible to some secret place where she may  again have the opportunity of attaching it to her  body In order to put this insects affection for  her eggs to a test M Bonnet threw a spider with  her bag into the den of a ferocious insect called  an antlion who lurks at the bottom like the  Giant in the Pilgrims Progress waiting for  poor insecttravellers to drop into the pit which  it forms and then rushing out devours them   The spider endeavoured to escape and was  eagerly remounting the side of the pit when I  again tumbled her to the bottom and the ant  lion more nimble than the first time seized the  bag of eggs with his jaws and attempted to drag  it under the sand The spider on the other hand  made the most strenuous efforts to keep her hold  and struggled hard to defeat the aim of the concealed depredator but the gum which fastened  her bag not being calculated to withstand such  violence at length gave way and the antlion was  about to carry off the prize in triumph The  spider however instantly regained it with her  jaws and redoubled her efforts to snatch the bag  from the enemy but her efforts were vain for  the antlion being the stronger succeeded in  dragging it under the sand The unfortunate  mother now robbed of her eggs might at least  have saved her own life as she could easily have  escaped out of the pitfall but wonderful to tell  she chose rather to be buried alive along with her  eggs As the sand concealed from my view what  was passing below I laid hold of the spider  leaving the bag in the power of the antlion But  the affectionate mother deprived of her bag  would not quit the spot where she had lost it  though I repeatedly pushed her with a twig Life  itself seemed to have become a burden to her  since all her hopes and pleasures were gone for  ever  As this spider may be easily found in the localities we have mentioned it may interest some  of our readers to make trial of the mothers care  for her eggs but let us hope only in a gentle  spirit Never let us be guilty of the cruelty  above narrated and leave the disconsolate mother  after her hard struggle for her treasure without  restoring it back to her Even in an insect a  mothers love so faithful selfdevoted and constant is a sacred thing and while as an illustration of the care it has pleased the Creator to  implant in it for its offspring it may be lawful to  put it to the trial it is wrong and cruel to do  more Never let us for our own amusement  give even to an insect that depth of anguish and  despair so beautifully expressed in the words of  Jacob as translated in the margin of our Bibles   And I as I am bereaved of my childrenI am  bereaved   In order to prove says the author of Insect  Architecture whether a spider of this species  could distinguish her own eggbag from that of a  stranger we interchanged the hags of two individuals which we had put under inverted wine¬  glasses but both manifested great uneasiness  and would not touch the strange bags We then  introduced one of the mothers into the glass containing her own eggs and the other spider but  even then she did not take to them which we  attributed to the presence of the other as all  spiders nourish mutual enmity Upon removing  the stranger however she showed the same in¬  difference to her eggs as before and we concluded  that after having lost sight of them for a short  time she was no longer able to recognise them  The common earwig a name at which some  who little know the beautiful traits in her character  are apt to shudder still more closely resembles the  affection of a higher animal than does the spider  just mentioned The following most interesting  notice of her proceedings was published by a  writer in the Penny Magazine some time since  He says About the end of March I found an  earwig brooding over her eggs in a small cell  scooped out in a garden border and in order to  observe her proceedings I removed the eggs into  my study placing them upon fresh earth under a  bell glass The careful mother soon scooped out  a fresh cell and collected the scattered eggs with  great care to the little nest placing herself over  themnot so much as it afterwards appeared to  keep them warm as to prevent the too rapid  evaporation of their moisture When the earth  began to dry up she dug the cell gradually deeper  till at length she got almost out of view and  whenever the interior became too dry she with¬  drew the eggs from the cell altogether and placed  them round the rim of the glass where some of  the evaporated moisture had condensed Upon  observing this I dropped some water into the  abandoned cell and the mother soon afterwards re¬  placed her eggs there When the water which had  been dropped had nearly evaporated I moistened  the outside of the earth opposite the bottom of the  cell and the mother perceiving this actually dug  a gallery right through to the spot where she found  the best supply of moisture Having neglected to  moisten the earth for some days it again became  dry and there was none even round the rim of  the odass as before Under these circumstances  the mother earwig found a little remaining moisture quite under the clod of earth upon the board  of the mantelpiece and thither she forthwith  carried her eggs The subsequent proceedings  were not less interesting for though I carefully  moistened the earth every day she regularly  changed the situation of the eggs morning and  evening placing them in the original cell at  night and on the board under the clod during the  day as if she understood the evaporation to be so  great when the sun was up that her eggs might  be left dry before night I regret to add that  during my absence the glass had been removed  and the mother escaped having carried away all  her eggs but one or two which soon shrivelled up  Our diligent little exemplars the ants are  equally careful about their eggs So soon as  they are produced the ants catch them up and  convey them to a separate chamber moisten¬  ing them with their tongues and incessantly  turning them backwards and forwards They are  the objects of constant solicitude until they are  hatched they are carried hither and thither  according as the temperature of the nest varies  On a sunny morning they are brought out and  laid to bask in the warm air but if the sky  becomes overcast and heavy clouds threaten  rain the careful nurses whip up the eggs and  hasten with them down to the deepest recesses  of the nest They even appear to imitate the  brooding of the hen and sit upon the eggs to  impart to them some of the warmth of their own  bodies  Before concluding this chapter and entering  upon the more striking manifestation of life in the  form of the insect which will next come under  our observation it will be useful just to allude to  the comparative number of eggs which some insects produce which we shall place in the form of  a table  The Noonday Fly 2  The Flea 12  May Flies 100  Silkworm Moth 500  Other Moths 1000 to 1600  Wasps 40000  Bees 50000  The most enormous number of all is produced by  the queen of the white warrior ants She deposits sixty eggs every minute which is at the  rate of 31557600 eggs in the course of a year  if we allow that she goes on laying at the same  rate constantly which is perhaps scarcely correct  Were all the eggs produced by insects to be  hatched and to bring forth living progeny we  may well ask what would become of mankind  Unquestionably in a short time their numbers  would multiply so excessively as to sweep every  green thing off the face of the earth and man and  beast would experience all the horrors of famine  But they are the sport of a thousand accidents  which destroy them and keep down the threatened  excess of population in this world of busy creatures And when the young larva has been put  forth this check upon their tendency to over multiplication is still more prominently displayed as  we may presently have occasion to remark  PART IITHE LARVA  CHAPTER I  THE YOUNG LARVA  The generality of insects as has been before  mentioned are destined never to behold the birth  of their progeny nor to experience either the  pleasures or the cares of parents surrounded by  their families Their anxieties cease when they  have carefully stored up their eggs and their exist¬  ence is generally soon afterwards at an end The  insect world therefore presents us with but few  opportunities of witnessing the display of a pa¬  rental affection on the part of its members but  as was mentioned in the conclusion of the last  chapter a few examples of the kind do exist  and perhaps the very fact of their being few in  number contributes to make them the more interesting to us We have seen a noble instance of  selfdevotion on the part of a poor spider in defence  of her eggs Let us now turn to some examples  of the love of an insect mother for her young  larva If the reader will carefully search the  twins and leaves of the birchtree in the month of  July he may possibly succeed in finding the little  insect the fieldbug of which mention is about  being made and witness for himself the strange  spectacle described in the following account from  the great work on insects by De Geer In order  that it may be recognised we have  here adjoined a representation of  the insect Its colour is a greenish  gray on the back dotted all over  with very minute black spots the  under portion of the insect is  greenish yellow with black spots  It lives upon the sap of the birch  The Fieldbug tree   The mother says De Geer was accompanied by a troop of little ones sometimes as many  as forty in number She remained constantly  with them generally on a twig or leaf I noticed  that the little ones and their mother did not always  remain in the same place and that as soon as the  mother began to move to another position all the  little ones began to run after her and stopped  whenever the mother halted She used to take  them as it were for a walk from twig to twig or  from one leaf to another parading up and down  the branches of the tree and she conducted them  wherever she pleased just as a hen does her  chickens It frequently afforded me great pleasure  to observe their movements One day I cut a  young branch of the birchtree inhabited by such  an insect family and I immediately saw the  mother apparently in great anxiety begin to flap  her wings violently but without attempting to fly  away as though she would frighten away her  enemy At another time she would have imme¬  diately made her escape thus plainly showing that  she remained only in order to defend her young  brood  As if to furnish an instance of precisely the  opposite import the cruel and murderous father of  this interesting little family is one of the greatest  enemies the poor mother has to contend against  This hardhearted parent does not hesitate when¬  ever he falls in with one of his children to seize  him and eat him up If the mother spies him at  this horrible feast she immediately attacks him in  the manner described and does her utmost to deter  him from his cannibal propensities by placing  herself in an attitude of determined resistance  before him Was ever mothers love more plainly  manifested than this love No other instance of  an affection so strange and strong is to be found in  the tribe to which she belongs  The care of the earwig not only extends to  her eggs but also to her young larvae In the  beginning of June writes the author last quoted   I found under a stone a female earwig sur¬  rounded by a number of little creatures which I  discovered to be her tiny family She did not  attempt to leave them and they frequently ran  and crouched under her just as chickens under the  wing of a hen I took them up and placed them  under a sandglass under which I had put a little  fresh earth They did not bore into the earth  and it was most curious to see them running for  shelter under the mother and pushing about  between her feet while she remained perfectly  quiet I fed them with pieces of ripe apple  which the mother seized and ate with great avidity  detaching morsels of it by means of her teeth and  swallowing them The young ones also ate a  little of it but with less avidity  When the eggs of the spider mentioned in the  last chapter as so devotedly attached to its trea¬  sure as to prefer death to parting with them are  hatched they make their way out of the bag by an  opening in it being assisted by the mother in this  difficult task De Geer indeed states that this is  the reason why the mother clings so tenaciously to  the bas of egos as if she knew that her assistance  in extricating her young from it was necessary  But this is not altogether correct as they are able  to make their way out by themselves in due time  When the young larvae have come forth from the  shell they run towards the mother and climb upon  her body some get on her head some on her  back and some on her limbs In this manner she  carries them about and is said to feed them until  they become strong enough to shift for themselves   I have more than once been gratified writes  one of the authors of the Introduction to Ento¬  mology by a sight of this interesting spectacle  and when I nearly touched the mother thus  covered by hundreds of progeny it was most  amusing to see them all leap from her back and  run away in all directions  For another instance of affection almost maternal for the young and helpless larvae let us take a  peep into an ants nest So soon as ever the young  larvae emerge from the eggs they require the unremitting attention of the best and most careful  nurses in order to rear them They must be kept  clean fed and taken lor an airing as regularly as  the day returns By means of their tongues which  are incessantly used in licking them their coats  are kept of the most snowy white They are fed  three or four times a day by their nurses who take  care to masticate the food for them and thus pre¬  pare it for their tender mouths But the most  strange part is their regularly being taken out for  the benefit of the air and warmth Some of the ants  at the top of the nest watch for the first beams of  the welcome sun and as soon as they pour upon  the nest they hasten down below in a great bustle  to wake up the nurses and bid them take the  young ones out of their chambers and bring them  up to the light which these indefatigable ants  quickly set about to do After basking there all  day long the nurses take care not to expose the  delicate constitutions of the larvae to the chill  evening air and soon as the sun begins to sink  towards the horizon they carefully take them up  and carry them to the warm deep cell below  For fear perhaps of their taking cold they never  allow them to be taken out in raw damp or frosty  weather It must not be forgotten however that  these ants are not the parents of the larvte they  are only the nurses  But it becomes us now to pursue the more  immediate subject of these remarks and ask the  readers attention to a few particulars about the  larva It is a great pity for the sake of a clear per¬  ception of the facts of insect history that there is  a sad confusion of names in use among the majority  of persons in speaking of the different forms and  changes of insects Who would imagine that  caterpillar grub maggot and larva signified one  and the same stage of the life of an insect  This abuse of terms cannot but render the know¬  ledge of any science less easily retained than it  would otherwise be for the question is continually  arising in the mindIf these all mean the same  why is not one term enough to express them  Let us then renounce those of uncertain meaning  and when we wish to give a name to the insect  just emerged from its eggshell let us call it by  its proper name the Larva The larva then is the first form assumed by  the insect on quitting its shell No more a little  inactive object lies before us as in the egg and its  slumbering tenant but a sharp fellow full of life  and soon walking off the field of the microscope  should we happen to be looking at it in that way  or from our book or table should it be there placed  by us for observation By what hidden and mysterious power this has been effected who can tell  It was not heat alone that could animate the contents of the shell nor could all a mothers care do  more than preserve it from injury It is very  possible that chemistry had some share in it and  when the tiny being first awoke in the shell the  The definition of the words Caterpillar Grub Maggot as  popularly understood is as follows  A Caterpillar is the larva of a butterfly moth or sawfly  often hairy and always provided with a larger or smaller number  of legs  A Grub is the larva of a beetle having six feet and a smooth  body  A Maggot is the larva of a bee wasp or fly and has no legs  oxygen of the air undoubtedly was necessary to its  health and the fulfilment of its early functions  but no more Not chemistry nor electricity nor  heat nor any other known force could effect this  wonderful change of apparently inanimate fluid  into a lively active and wellorganized being  much less could either of these give it its definite  form causing one larva to differ from another  in its characters No we cannot tell how it has  taken place nor what has wrought the change  but we know the author of iteven Him who  from the beginning created all things and established those principles which though hidden  from our eyes work out the marvels of the  created world It is enough for us to know and  to remember this Should we attempt more we  should probably fall under the Scripture reproof   Professing themselves to be wise they became  fools  Speaking generally insects in the larva form  appear as fleshy worms having long and round  bodies marked with rings and provided with a  head and a certain number of legs mostly six  How different in this condition from the ball¬  room gaiety of the butterfly or the elegant robes  of the lacewins flies To look at a number of  larvae all crawling over one another and bearing  perhaps not the most loving behaviour to each  other as they scramble about who would dream  that in a little while those slowly moving  bodies will be whirled through the air faster  than our feet can pursue or even than the eye  can follow Who also but one well versed in  the knowledge of insects could venture to say  what insect could be formed by this or that  larva now so little resembling winged insects at  all  In studying the forms and appearances of  various larvse we shall find that some of them bear  a tolerably close resemblance to the future insect  Larvce unlike the future Insects  Larvce like the future Insects  while others on the contrary do not resemble  their future condition at all and had we to decide  to what tribe of insects they belonged merely  judging by their shape and character we should  be sorely perplexed to do so and if we did we  should often in all probability be very far wrong  We need not go far for an illustration first of a  larva like the perfect insect and next for one  totally unlike it Taking a candle and exploring  into some snug hole near the kitchen fireplace we  shall not be long probably before we extricate a  number of the larvas of the cricket Those of the  bug also are very like the perfect insect so also  are young spiders cockroaches and grasshoppers  These all resemble more or less perfectly the in¬  sect in its complete form  Even amongst the larvae not resembling the  perfect insect a little attention will enable us to  perceive a sort of general resemblance between  those of different genera and species which we  may call the Larva family likeness This consists  in the form of the body in a number of instances  but in all in the ringlike marks or segments of  the body as they are called which are thirteen in  number If the reader will take the trouble to  count the rings in the larva of different insects he  will generally find that they are thirteen in number The general resemblance of larvae to one  another may also be noticed The larva is in  every instance destitute of  wings In many cases larvae  are provided with feet in  many others they have none  And in some instances  they have no distinct head  as in the larva of the blow  fly  By far the larger number of larvae belong to this  class that is they do not  resemble the perfect insect  Do not resemble could  any one believe that these  strange and some of them  awful looking larvae ever  Larvce of Butterflies  became butterflies yet they all belong to that  tribe of insects  In order to give a clear conception of the  structure of a larva we may briefly mention the  names of its various parts First then there is  a head of various shapes sometimes of the shape  of a heart sometimes round or triangular At¬  tached to the head are the two antennas or as  they are commonly called feelers most probably  an incorrect expression as it appears that insects  may possibly hear as well as feel by their means  At the side of the head are the  eyes which are formed much more  simply than those of the per¬  fect insect Next is the mouth  provided with its upper and lower  pair of jaws Then there is the  body and its legs and lastly there  is in many larvte living in the  water a tail which strange to  say is provided with a delicate  tube through which the larva  breathes A beautiful instance of  such an appendage to the body  of the larva is represented in the adjoining cut  Diagram of a Larva  the various parts of the larva are  also represented in the accompany¬  ing figure  We may now enter upon a few  particulars connected with the ge¬  neral history of insects in the larva  form  CHAPTEE II  HABITS OF THE LARVA  Generally for a little while after the larva  has emerged from the shell it is in a very weak  and languid condition The effort of extricating  itself from its little prisonhouse seems to leave  it almost without strength and for a period  which varies in different insects it lies help¬  less and almost motionless at the mercy of any  wandering adversary and might be demolished  without resistance But this hour of weakness  except in a few cases is not prolonged In the  course of an hour or two or even much less in  some instances the larva revives takes heart and  begins by eating whatever food may happen to  lie in its way and now the larva becomes a  terror to the world of insects or even indirectly  to man and to nations Instead of simply eating  in order to live like most other beings it only lives  to eat it has no other duty to perform at present  but to eat as fast and as much as it possibly can  in a certain time and it must be confessed the  larva generally speaking leaves little to be de¬  sired on the score of a sharp appetite Unlike  other creatures who allow themselves a certain  period between their meals the larva sets to its  feast and does not leave the table until it has  devoured all its contentsupon which it immediately begins again elsewhere No gourmand in  the world whether among human beings or brutes  can compare with the insect in this form for the  amount of food consumed Morning noon and  night is to it only a continued round of feasting  and as may well be imagined the larva grows  very rapidly accordingly Some larvae consume  animal others vegetable food or in the language  of science some are carnivorous some are graminivorous or herbivorous and some will eat anything  almost that comes before themthese would be  called and very appropriately so omnivorous  Let us speak of carnivorous larvie first The  larvse which have carnivorous propensities render  themselves often truly terrible to the insect world  around them The most mighty warrior that ever  lived in his whole career never slew half so many  of his own species as the larva of a beautiful fly  does of aphides in a few hours Well does Reaumur  call them the lions of the aphides and thus does  he describe their method of proceeding   There is no beast of prey in nature who hunts  so entirely at his ease as does this larva Resting  upon a twig or a leaf he is surrounded on every  side by the insects on which he feeds often  indeed they touch his sides and he is able to catch  hundreds of them without changing his position  Not only do the poor little aphides not fly from  him but they may be often seen creeping over  the body of their enemy It is only after the  larva has eaten up the greater number of his prey  around him that he has any need to remove to a  spot as thickly inhabited by them as that in which  he has been making his cruel ravages In order  to observe the manner in which he attacks them  the best plan is to take him put him between  two leaves and shut him up in a box for ten or  twelve hours to sharpen his appetite After this  fast he must be placed on some spot where the  aphides are found in abundance Immediately he  begins exploring around for prey which he does  simply by the sense of touch as he does not appear  to be able to see At length an unhappy insect  conies within his reach  Brandishing a trident with  which he is armed he im¬  mediately transfixes the  insect just as we take up  a morsel of food upon a  fork The little creature  is then sucked into a sort  of cavity like the neck of  a bottle where it is retained by a couple of  pins until its juices are  uon of the Aphides emptied by the destroyer  when he casts it away now nothing more of it  being left but a dry shrivelled empty skin The  aphislion however loses no time and presently  seizes another which he pierces and sucks dry as  quickly as the last When very hungry he will  devour one a minute Reaumur says I have  seen him eat twenty of these insects one after   One of these insects which fell under the writers notice  pierced and sucked dry aphides of several different species quite  indifferently  another in twenty minutes nor did this satisfy  him for in the course of two hours he devoured  more than a hundred insects with which I sup¬  plied him These larvae do repose a little but  never for long for they are seldom without some  prey in hand I have seen adds the last author   twigs of the elder seven or eight inches in length  entirely covered with these insects the aphides  and in four days time there remained not one  alive  This larva is a rare specimen of courage as  well as of destructive powers for when it is quite  young it often seizes upon an insect twice as big as  itself It is very amusing to see the unequal con¬  test between the little but courageous foe and his  great bulky and stupid adversary Immediately  the larva thrusts its trident into the body of the  enemy who stupid as he is does not like the  sensation of the wound in his side and makes off  as fast as he can The lionhearted larva follows  him up and wrestles with him and at length actually boards him to use a sailors term clambering up his sides and in triumph piercing him  through and slaying him What is perhaps most  singular of all the larvae of some species of these  flies not only slay their victims but actually clothe  themselves after the manner of Hercules on his  victory over the Nemaean lion with the skins of  their prey   It is almost to be regretted that the insect  world has not had the privilege of having its  combats sung by the poets Who can forget the  animated scenes painted in such lifelike colours  by Homer and Virgil of the conflicts hand to  hand of the heroes of their verse But the history  of insects supplies us with more singular and  more interesting deeds of fight than have ever yet  been fabled by poets or commemorated in song  In the instance we are about to quote the larva of  the antlion is the crafty Giant Grim who lives by  entrapping as we have before said poor wayfaring  travellers Like those giants of old of whom we  read in books a little more wonderful than true this  subtle and powerful enemy lies deeply ensconced  in his subterraneous cavern patiently abiding the  time when his unsuspecting prey shall fall into his  power His trap is depicted on the opposite page  This insect is naturally a very helpless being it  can only walk at a slow pace and strange to add  it can only walk backwards and not forwards  Yet its food is the juice of insect bodies How  then is it to seize upon them circumstanced so  unfavourably as it is having neither swiftness nor  ability to direct its motions sufficiently actively to  An Antlion in its Trap  fit it for such a task It succeeds by an artifice of  the most refined character Nothing daunted by  what we might call its natural disadvantages the  insect sets bravely to work to construct a trap for its  prey and the manner in which this is performed  may well strike us with wonder and raise our  admiration up to Him who has so marvellously  endowed this humble being with wisdom and skill  It first takes care to choose out a proper site for  the work it is about and in this always selects a  soil composed of fine loose and dry sand well aware  that as we shall presently see no other would be  fit for its purpose Generally it chooses such a soil  under the shelter of an old wall where the rain  cannot easily penetrate and ruin its work In so  doing it shows its wisdom for thither when the  heat of the sun is great or when the raindrops fall  heavily crowds of insects come for shelter and  fall into its cruel embrace  The site being chosen the next important step  is to mark out the bounds of its habitation and  with this view the insect begins digging a circular  ditch walking backwards until it has completed  the circle This defines the outer limits of its  Circular Ditch of the Antlion  trap and is a sort of guide line to it in its future  operations Then it sets about the more proper  task of excavating its trap Would that our readers  could see this insect at work Of all the wonderful sights presented to us in the insect world there  is none to equal it in interest none so calculated  to enlist our sympathies on the part of the patient  skilful and unwearied little labourers of this  kingdom of nature Guided by the line it has  marked out the workman steps into the circle  and sets to work with a hearty good will and  with a degree of diligence and excavating skill  that would put our railroad navigators to the  blush Shower after shower of sand is seen flying  up and beyond the boundary described with the  most unintermitting diligence until the insect has  completed the circle again arrived there it turns  round and excavates back again until it arrives at  the same point But it may perhaps be asked  where are its tools and by what means does it  succeed in casting up these loads of earth We  fear that at best any written description will  hardly do justice to our ingenious labourer its  method however is as followsIt uses the head  as the spade or rather shovel and in the strangest  manner it fills the shovel with one of its feet with  a load of sand and then by a quick movement of  the head tosses it out of the cavity By working  in alternate directions it manages so as never to  overfatigue one leg for on its return the leg  previously in use is at rest while the one on the  opposite side is now called into duty The insect  thus works on until its trap is completely exca¬  vated the task occupying a variable time some¬  times being finished in half an hour sometimes  even in less but occasionally occupying several  hours the little labourer being obliged to rest a  certain time Reaumur who has given a fasci¬  nating account of these insects writes I have  had at times hundreds of antlions in a large box  and I have often been amused with filling up their  traps Some of them would immediately begin  to form another but the greater number in the  warm long days of summer deferred executing the  work until the sun began to go down They  seldom worked in the heat of the day but in cold  or cloudy weather they would excavate at any  hour  We well know what perplexity a chain of rocky  hills causes to a railroad engineer and what vast  outlays of money labour and time are necessary  in order to overcome the obstacle thus presented  to the path of the engine and its train But it  may be safely said that we can furnish a parallel instance of difficulty and of patient allsurmounting  exertion from the history of the insect before us  M Bonnet was curious to know what it would do  if a stone or some such obstacle were met with  in the process of its excavations and one day had  the gratification of observing the behaviour of the  insect under these trying circumstances Not  being able to cast it out with its head the insect  determined to carry it out if possible on its back  With this view it contrived by various manoeuvres  to place the stone upon its back and to balance it  there This was the least difficult part of the undertaking The insect had to climb up an inclined  plane upon soil chosen with other views purposely  by itself as shifting and unsteady as possible and  not only so but to preserve the balance of the stone  with which it was encumbered Undaunted by  these difficulties it made the attempt but the first  step brought down a shower of sand and tumbled  the little rock to the bottom Again and again did  the heroic insect attempt the same feat and with the  same ill success and we might have thought we  beheld a realization of the fable of Sisyphus and  the rollingstone in the vain endeavours of the  insect to get rid of its encumbrance Five or six  times did the insect repeat its endeavours and at  last after one or two narrow escapes the stone  was fairly lodged on the outside of the trap and  the insect returned to its subterraneous recess at  the bottom of the cell in triumph  The traps vary in size in proportion to the age  of the insects which construct them The young  insects only form very small ones but as even  from the moment of their birth they are destined  to toil for their food they do not wait in idleness  and hunger because they cannot make large efforts  but are content to make little traps not more than  a few parts of an inch in diameter Thus they set  us the needful example of not despising to do  small things because our strength is not yet equal  to the performance of as much as we could  desire The diameter of the trap formed by a full  grown insect is about three inches the depth  about two  When its labours are over it has been well  remarked the insect now only requires patience  but it must have a good deal of it It generally  buries itself all but its jaws in the sand at the bot¬  tom and here awaits its victims If it requires much  patience surely it also needs to have much power  of endurance of hunger for it may wait for days  sometimes without catching any prey Frequently  when this is the case it marches out of its trap  and tries its fortune in some more favourable spot  But see an ant who has been out foraging for  the young ants at home is hastening back laden  with sweet treasures when suddenly she finds her  path arrested by what appears to her to be a deep  but smooth precipice To plunge down and rise  on the opposite side is a shorter cut in her estimation than to go round or perhaps she is led by  curiosity to wish to explore this singular cavity  and she plants her feet on its treacherous edge  causing a few grains of sand to roll down and give  notice to the wary giant below that a victim is at  hand A step back and her life would be saved  but no she leaves the bank trusts herself to the  unfaithful soil of the sides of the precipice and instantly rolls down in a cloud of dust to the bottom  Terror has now laid hold of her and with all speed  she strives to clamber up the unsteady sides For  a moment escape appears possible but the Argus  eyed monster below starts up into activity and  piling upon his head a huge load of sand he shoots  it after the escaping ant and once more brings her  down covered with dust into his embrace The  terrible jaws are instantly closed upon the un¬  happy insect and in a few minutes her existence  is at an end the savage enemy shaking her  violently or dashing her quivering frame against  the earth  Singular to add the antlion loves not dead  prey and will indignantly cast it out of its trap  Says Reaumur They appear so much to delight  in the glory of a victory that they disdain to touch  an insect who is not to say the least in a condition to contend with them It certainly is not  that the food when offered to it dead is not fresh  enough that it is thus treated for if only killed  an instant before the insect still refuses to touch  it Reaumur is disposed to believe that like our  sportsmen these interesting but cruel insects  destroy prey more for the pleasure of exhibiting  their superior skill than to appease their hunger  But it is rather uncharitable even to the antlion  to say so much as this When the insect has  sucked all the juices out of its victims body it  casts it out of its trap and the earth around strewed  with dead bodies is thus the silent witness to the  destroying powers of the giant within  This singular insect whose exploits have detained us so long remains in its larva form two  years growing daily in size until it has completed  its existence as a larva and must then enter upon  another condition of life It is to be regretted  that it is not to be found in England or at least  it has not been for some time discovered in our  island but it is common in France and other  parts of the continent and would well repay the  trouble of being brought over As the insect is  very patient of hunger it might easily be conveyed  in a little wooden box half filled with fine sand  and its proceedings could be readily watched by  placing it under a bellglass or in a little glass  case introducing a few ants or spiders for its food  from time to time  The insect exhibits to us a wonderful instance  of what we may call after the example of Dr  Paley the principle of compensation in nature  It can neither run nor fly with the speed necessary to overtake its prey who are swifter of  foot than itself But God never created it to  starve and has endowed it with a rare combination of faculties by which it is enabled to live  in the midst of plenty if not even of luxuriance  So it is in a thousand other cases in nature So  it is indeed in Providence likewise If He sends  us trials He also makes a way to escape that  we may be able to bear them If our day is to  be dark and cloudy and to call for the exercise of  much faith and patience there is still the same  provision made as thy day so shall thy strength  be If our lot in life is one of hardship He can  and if it is sought of him aright He will and He  does bear us up revive our drooping strength  and enable us to go on our way rejoicing  Let us go on to speak now of some other carnivorous larva If in the month of July we can  find out a spot where we can detect the traces of  the labours of the sandwasp of whom mention has  been made at page 15 and cutting out a little mass  of the sand rock containing several of their bur¬  rows then take the trouble to open gently one of  the cells formed by these insects we shall see a  carnivorous larva in as happy a condition as a fox  in a henroost or a mouse in the midst of a cheese  The best way to obtain access to this securely  imbedded and luxurious larva is to moisten the  mass of sand with a little water and then slice it  gently down with an old knife until we come to  the cells They are here represented At the  bottom of each we shall see the larvae which have  sprung from the eggs deposited in the manner be¬  fore described after the arduous and affectionate  labours of the parent Then above each is a heap of  caterpillars arranged  with beautiful neat¬  ness and larvae and  caterpillars are both  fast locked in their  prison house by the  firm stopping with  which the parent  wasp has closed the  mouth of the cells  These caterpillars are  all alive and are  rolled into a ringlike  form but are so  chained down that c e iu of sndwa ip  they cannot move in the least degree The poor  prisoners like the sheep in the slaughteryard are  only waiting their turn to be killed and devoured  The larva soon after it is hatched finds himself in  the midst of a wellstored larder and has nothing  to do but eat which he does not long delay doing  He devours at his ease and revels in the dainty  fresh food which the care of his parent had laid  up When he has eaten all his prisoners up  and grown to his full size he lays down to sleep  to awake again in another and a far different  form  Sometimes the reader may have the opportunity  it may be of finding out the nest of the wood¬  boring wasp and he may in June or July perhaps  succeed in discovering another instance of a larva  in a happy state of plenty  The larva is sure to be  found at the bottom and  above it will be piled a  heap of insects for its food  What is remarkable about  this store of food is that  the insects thus made  prisoners are not dead for  they would if so soon  become corrupted and  unfit for the diet of the  larva they are in a sort  Larva of Woodboring Wasp °f Mf Stupified Condition in all probability very like that induced by  the late plan of breathing ether and other vapours  to render persons insensible to pain while surgically operated on Since this plan has been introduced we read in some of the newspaperswe  may question with what truththat the butchers  in Albany America give ether to the oxen  before killing them so as to make them insensible  to the pain of the deathblow But the wasps in  question have for ages been in the habit of effecting  the same end by stinging their captives the poison  not sufficing to kill them nor yet permitting them  to be actively alive  The insects thus stored up for the larva cost  the parent many a conflict in their capture And  here we may interest the reader by describing the  exploits of a warrior wasp abundant in the Isle of  France It is curious that in the Isle of France  the common bee is not to be found as a native of  the woods while in the Isle of Bourbon it is very  common and furnishes an abundance of wax and  honey This is explained by supposing that the  warriors of whom we are about to speak destroy  the bees and have thus prevented their multiplying in the island in question Truly like the  banditti of whom we read in books these wasps  are splendidly attired although not in the spoils of  those they have robbed Their head chest and  body is of a resplendent lustre now green or  seen in another position blue and glistening with  all the lustre of an exquisite varnish their antenme are black their eyes of a brownish yellow  and their legs partly bronzecoloured and partly  of a beautiful violet They are strong and swift  of wing and are possessed of a terrible lance the  thrusts of which even man cannot endure without  far more pain and inflammation than attends an  ordinary sting  The foe with whom these magnificentlydressed  warriors have to contend is a kind of insect  allied to the cockroach which in our kitchens has  acquired the incorrect title of black beetle  This insect is detested by the inhabitants of the  island for its ravages upon almost everything of  value or delicacy and is not less hated by the  sailor for its destructiveness on shipboard It  is called Kakerlac and is much larger than the  cockroaches which are the plague and terror of  our cooks Imagine that one of these great and  odious insects is marching along the highway  The warrior wasp has also been making his  expeditions for prey abroad when suddenly his  eager eye catches sight of the kakerlac hastening  to some new scene of depredation The warrior  instantly alights and the kakerlac stops think¬  ing perhaps to intimidate its adversary by its size  and ferocious aspect Both insects glare at one  another   each other from afar  They view and rushing on begin the war  They launch their spears then hand to hand they meet  The trembling soil resounds beneath their feet  Their bucklers clash thick blows descend from high  And flashes of fire from their hard helmets fly  Courage conspires with chance and both engage  With equal fortune yet and mutual rage  Virgils description though scarcely accurate in  all points gives us a lively image of this insect  combat The kakerlac however is the Turn us  and the warrior wasp the Hmeas of the fight The  wasp is the first to attack and darts upon the  other seizing it by the muzzle with its strong  jaws then bending its body so as to bring its tail  under the abdomen of the kakerlac the lance  with its charge of poison is deepplunged into the  body of the unhappy foe imbuing a deadly venom  into its system Having made this thrust the  warrior looses the foe and soars in triumph a  little way into the air satisfied of a successful  issue  The wretched kakerlac after a few brief convulsions lies paralysed on the ground unable to  stir a step from the spot where it encountered  its terrible adversary Fully aware of this the  victorious wasp after taking a few turns as if to  proclaim the downfal of the Giant Kakerlac to  the surrounding neighbourhood returns to the  scene where the conflict was fought The kakerlac unable to resist the victor and being naturally though a great devourer a very fainthearted  creature lies immovable while the wasp seizes  the prostrate foe by the head and in a sort of  triumphal march drags it along the road to its  nest But though the kakerlac was not a difficult enemy to overcome the weight and size of  its body are a sore burden to the victor wasp  The way to the nest is long tedious and rugged  After a hard pull over all sorts of obstacles  the wasp becomes completely breathless and is  obliged to let go and for a rest it generally rises  into the air probably with a view of reconnoitring  future difficulties and of ascertaining the best  route to pursue Thus after alternately dragging  along the body of its victim and rising up to spy  out the path at length the conqueror succeeds in  bringing the carcase home  Here however arises another difficulty To  attempt to get the body of the huge kakerlac  in is just as if one were to attempt to get an  elephant through a small streetdoor What is to  be done The wasp enters the hole backwards  and seizing the head of the kakerlac endeavours  with all its might to drag it in but all in vain  Many times it repeats these efforts with the same  want of success and now it appears that its  labours in bringing hither the corpse and its  dangers in the battle were all for nought for the  great body cannot be put in the place the wasp  had designed for it As if exasperated with the  difficulties out comes the wasp in fury and fall¬  ing upon the body of the kakerlac hews off the  large wingcases together with several of the  limbs and goes back into the hole again to repeat  the attempt to get it in Success at length crowns  its efforts by little and little the body becomes  lost to sight and finally disappears altogether  from view being carried down to the very bottom  of the nest Here the larva as soon as hatched  feeds upon it thrives and grows and falls asleep  awaiting the time when itself shall awake to  follow in the steps of the glittering and formidable  warrior who with the boldness of an amazon and  affection of the tenderest of mothers supplied it  with nourishment during its hours of infancy  This may be thought a scene of sad carnage  but the following will perhaps appear even more  so What should we say if deep in the forests of  some wild uncultivated country was found a den  the bottom of which was strewed with skulls with  bones and mangled limbs What fearful scenes  should we not suspect to have taken place in this  dark and horrid place and as we shuddered in  looking round upon its walls as the once witnesses  of terrible deeds we might even fancy we heard  the cry of the poor traveller whose last agonies  were seen by no eye but that of the monster who  had waylaid and murdered him Such a den may  be found in the forest made horrible by the cutoff  heads limbs and wings of insectsit is the habita¬  tion of the carnivorous larva of a wasp Nay more  as is seen in the engraving the insect monster  actually works up the cutoff wings and limbs into  a sort of covering for itself and finally buries  itself in a shroud partly made of  the spoils of former victims  Perhaps the carnivorous larva   t The Larva of a Wasp in its  of the tigerbeetle or cicindela coat of wings and limbs  is as ferocious a being as any in this state  In this respect indeed it resembles the perfect  insect whose title sufficiently indicates its swift¬  ness cunning and bloodthirsty nature £ These  larvae writes Mr Westwood burrow cylindric  retreats in the earth to the depth of a foot or  more employing their legs and jaws in loosen¬  ing the particles of sand and earth which they  carry to the surface upon their broad saucer¬  like head ascending by the assistance of the two  hooks upon the back somewhat after the fashion  of a sweep going up a chimney Having com¬  pleted this burrow they station themselves by  means of their legs and back hooks at its mouth  their large flattened head and great segment  filling the hole Here they remain all day long  and many an insect might pass close by little  dreaming of the terrible foe who lay under that  trapdoor Presently comes a spider scrambling  over the ground in haste to mount up a branch  on which to hang one of its web lines the  treacherous trapdoor is in its direct path Its  feet rest on it instantly the trap drops and the  poor insect falls into the dark den and is caught  in the powerful jaws of the artful larva Truly  there is something even to man a little intimidating in the sight of such a monster as is represented here how much more  to the unfortunate insect who  happens to be caught in its  embrace and having only time  to just catch a glimpse of its  fearful captor is dragged down in a cloud of dust  to be devoured in darkness at the bottom of the den  Yet this also like other cruel creatures is in reality  a very timid larva and instantly on the approach of  danger drops to the bottom of the cell where if  we have courage to pursue it we shall find it much  in the attitude in which it is here represented  The singular pair of hooks on its back are used as  the flukes of an anchor to sustain the insect in  the position it assumes at the mouth of the cell  Mention has already been made in the previous  chapter of the insects called Ichneumons which  deposit their eggs in the bodies of the larvae of  other insects These when hatched are also to  be reckoned among the larvae which prey upon  flesh since they devour the bodies of the larvae in  which they have been deposited They are thus  most useful to mankind in destroying the devourers  of his vegetable food  We may now see an instance yet more strange of  a carnivorous larva We must wend our way to the  riverside in the months of May or June There  after a diligent search at the bottom in some  moderately shallow portion of  the stream shall we find a  larva the study of which might  well occupy us for many pages  Yet it is the larva of an in¬  sect well known to every  angler and brook side wanderer the dragonfly This  larva is provided with one of  the most remarkable contrivances for seizing its prey and   i p Larva of the DrasonJtij  conveying it to its mouth to  any being in the zoological kingdom By the  assistance of the engraving we may perhaps be  able to render this apparatus which is somewhat  complicated intelligible to the reader Looking  at the larvas head we are reminded somewhat of  The Mask partly open The same partly closed  that of a horse who has got blinders over his eyes  and a nosebag over his nose and partly up his  cheeks Now suppose the two blinders thrown  back on each side then conceive that the lower  part of the face which we have supposed covered  with a nosebag were to be uncovered we should  then see the following curious contrivance The  lower lip of this larva is lengthened downwards  into a sort of arm if we may so speak at what  we may call the elbow is a joint connecting the  upper and lower portions of it and the place of  the hand is occupied by two cross plates with a  claw at the end of each Suppose an unhappy  insect or even a tadpole swims carelessly by the  larva immediately the two sides of the mask or  blinders as we have called them fly open the  arm is uncovered the forearm let down and by  means of the plates which we have compared to  the hand the victim is caught and bending the  arm back is presented to the mouth of the larva  There is much similarity in this organ with the  wonderful apparatus of the elephant called its  trunk but of the two the trunk of this insect is  the most beautiful piece of animal mechanism  When the prey has  been devoured the  arm folds up covers the mouth and  part of the face of  the insect and the  blinders or two  side pieces of the  mask fall in and lock together in a toothed  manner as the engraving in the last page shows  Thus provided the larva is a formidable creature to the inhabitants of the pond or brook few  indeed more so It preys with incessant activity  on all aquatic insects that happen to come in its  way and sometimes as we have said even upon  tadpoles They do not even spare one another and  woe to the unhappy relative of the family who  happens to wander near the abode of another of the  The apparatus in the act of seising  same family anxious to begin his feasting for the  day So ferocious are they that they even attack  small fish and make little work of swallowing them  up Not only are these creatures fierce but they  also possess all the cunning of a tiger or a cat To  watch them seize their prey is an interesting occupation and as the larvae are common enough and  may be easily recognised by comparing them with  the accompanying cut we may venture to recommend the amusement of observing their proceedings  to the reader A little way off lies an unsuspecting insect delighting in the warm sunshine  and securely floating upon the waters on the corner  of a leaf Such an idea as danger at hand is pro¬  bably the very last from its conceptions and  pluming its bright and glossy wings it beguiles  away the sunny hour unmolested by a passing  enemy or a breath of air The larva has marked  it already for its own See it rouse itself up and  noiselessly make ready to pounce upon the unsus¬  pecting lounger It creeps stealthily along con¬  cealing itself from view as far as possible and not  even the telltale glassy surface of the water feels  its movements Measuring its distance well the  larva prepares to seize its prey in a moment  swifter than the eye can follow the victim is  caught by the apparatus we have described and  in another instant is in all the agonies of a violent  death in the mouth of the larva So exceedingly  cautious are these larvae in their movements and  so expert and active in darting upon their prey  that it scarcely ever escapes their power  Having mentioned these particulars about car¬  nivorous larvae let us consider some circumstances  connected with those larvae that are vegetable  feedersgraminivorous or herbivorous Of these  we could scarcely select a more destructive one  than the larva of an insect well known to every  schoolboy from the times of Greece and Rome  down to our ownthe common cockchafer melo  lontha vulgaris Our schoolboys however are less  merciful than those of Greece for they only tied a  string round the leg of the unhappy cockchafer  while these thrust a pin through its tail Yet its  terrible ravages considered the insect little de¬  serves to be pitied but Ave are not therefore to  be understood as by any means sanctioning the  cruel and inhuman sport alluded to These larva  are hatched in a sort of little cavern dug by the  parent insects care under the ground in our mea¬  dows or cornfields Here they begin their  ravages bv devouring the roots of the grasses  which surround them on all sides In this manner  they A r ery quickly destroy the plants which wither  and die in a manner quite mysterious to the agri¬  culturist if he does not happen to think of these  insects The turf soon becomes so completely  undermined by these excavators that it may be  rolled off as smooth as if a knife had been used  underneath to cut off all its connexions with the  ground In a few weeks meadows which shone  in all the fresh and luxuriant green raiment of  Spring change colour and before Summer has yet  come and before the stalks of the grass are yet  grown up one would think Autumn had passed  over the face of the field from its dry and dead  aspect About seventy years ago we are told  these larvce did so much injury to a poor farmers  fields near Norwich that the court of that city out  of compassion presented him with twentyfive  pounds Some idea of their numbers on this  farmers property may be formed from the fact  that the farmer and his servant declared with  very long faces we may be sure that they had  gathered eighty bushels of them Sometimes  they even attack the roots of young trees and in  this manner do an incalculable amount of mischief  to plantations They were at one time so abun¬  dant in France and did such immense mischief  that the Government in order to get rid of them  offered a handsome reward for the best method of  destroying them A number of experiments were  made and it really seemed as if nothing would  kill these larvae in the way of poison at least for  several poisons which are rapidly fatal to man and  animals failed to produce the least effect on them  It was found however at last that a solution of  alkalies such as potash and soda were certain  poisons to them and should land be much infested  with them it would be worth the trial to water it  with such solutions especially as they tend rather  to enrich the soil than otherwise A French  manufacturer determining to turn the visitation  of these insects to good account lias succeeded in  distilling an excellent lampoil from their bodies  and offers tenpence a bushel for them From  seventeen bushels he extracted twentyeight quarts  of good oil In Hungary a kind of grease is  obtained from them which is useful for carriage  wheels The ingenuity of man may thus even  procure good out of a very formidable evil  although the mischief done by the cockchafer  larva undoubtedly far exceeds the benefit it con¬  fers upon its captors in the amount of oil extracted  from it  An insect almost equally familiar to all persons  is the longlegged gnat of whom the famous  childrens rhyme runs   Old father longlegs would not say his prayers  Take him by the left leg and throw him down stairs  Many of our farmers would be glad no doubt  if taking him by the left leg would keep him out  of their meadows for there this insect commits  fearful ravages in the larva form In some parts  of England it has as completely destroyed the  pasturegrass as if it had been consumed by fire  In the spring of 1813 hundreds of acres of  pasture in the rich district of Sunk Island in Hoiderness were entirely destroyed by it being  rendered as completely brown as if they had suffered a three months drought and no other vegetation but that of a few thistles was left on land  which at more favoured periods was more than  commonly luxuriant On a square foot of the turf  being dug up from the affected spot the enormous  number of two hundred and ten larvae was counted  in it Fortunately the next year showed a very  different result for then it was difficult on careful  search to find one In some districts of France  it is also very destructive the grass of large tracts  being so completely destroyed by it that enough  food for the maintenance of the cattle is not to  be obtained These larvte like the lastnamed  appear to destroy by eating away the roots of the  grass From these and the foregoing facts entomology teaches us to regard these two insects  upon which we commonly look with compassion  as occasionally becoming the formidable though  indirect enemies of man The scientific name for   Father Longlegs is Tipula oleracea The  French call them oddly enough milliners or  tailors couturieres tailleurs a name of which it is  harder to guess the origin than the common one of  12 fatherlonglegs which is sufficiently expressive of  one of the features of the insect in the perfect  state perhaps the French tailors are distin¬  guished for being very long and thin  We may yet linger awhile in the fields for  another illustration of the devouring propensities  of vegetablefeeding larvte The pretty moth re¬  presented in the accompanying engraving together  with its larva was once the cause of more alarm  The Gamma Moth and Larva  in France than we can readily conceive It is  often to be seen in our meadows plunging its  minute drinking apparatus into the depths of the  wild flowers and flitting to and fro at no great  height from the ground all the day long and even  after sundown It is called generally the Gamma  moth or Plusia gamma in consequence of the  little mark in its wings which resembles the  Greek letter 7 Its larva is striped with green  and when multiplied excessively as was the case  in France in the year 1735 produces scenes of  desolation which as the results of apparently  an insignificant insects doings can scarcely be  credited In the months of June and July in  that year they became so numerous that the  gardeners and peasantry in the districts plagued  by them declared that they must have been created  by enchantment In some places Reaumur was  assured that an old soldier had been seen to throw  the spell In other places an ugly old woman  who was as wicked as she was frightful had caused  all the mischief Their prodigious numbers appeared to the ignorant and superstitious peasantry  an indubitable proof that they were created by  sorcery And though we cannot of course sympathise with their thoughts on this subject we  can well imagine and feel for their astonishment  and dismay as they beheld the wide desolation of  every green thing produced by the innumerable  millions of these larvae which covered forest field  and garden with their bodies Many persons  began to fear they were really poisonous creatures  and refused in consequence to partake of salads or  other vegetable food of a similar kind This was  probably an equal error with the last and it is  very droll to find the talented Reaumur pleading  with great earnestness that the caterpillars were  not unwholesome as food He even declares his  opinion that if these creatures were to become  excessively numerous in France the inhabitants  might be compelled to treat them as the wretched  inhabitants of Africa do the locusts and when  they have eaten up every green thing fall upon  and eat them With as much learning and eloquence as if he was treating one of his most  favourite topics in entomology M Reaumur recommends these larve for human food adding  that a very little time would enable us to conquer  our disgust at such aliment and that we should  even welcome to our tables a dish of the larvoe in  question as an agreeable luxury It is to be  hoped if ever such a custom be originated it will  be confined to the place of its birththe country  of this great but in this respect whimsical  naturalist  To account for their excessive multiplication  we have no need to have recourse to enchantment  for a solution of the difficulty Each of the  gamma moths produces about four hundred  eggs now if there were only twenty larvae in a  certain locality which lived through the winter  and became perfect insects in May following the  eggs deposited by these would supposing all to  be hatched produce according to a calculation  made by Reaumur in the course of a single  year eight hundred thousand larvse Well may we  exclaim then with this learned author Should  we not rather wonder at the wisdom and forethought which has ordered matters so that these  insects increase to annoy us so rarely The  wonder is in truth not that they should multiply  so excessively at particular periods so much as  that it should be so seldom that they are multiplied even to the extent of which they are naturally capable Thus if we suppose that all the  eggs of the moths of this species were to be  hatched it is more than probable that a large  portion of our vegetation would be consumed by  them How is this guarded against In various  ways The eggs are not all capable of being  hatched or if so are not allowed to escape injury  by various accidents and the larvae themselves are  a prey to countless enemies among the birds  while they also frequently perish owing to the  severity of winter From these considerations we  may readily perceive how completely the well¬  being of a great nation with the lives of a large  portion of its inhabitants are dependent upon the  preserving protecting and restraining influence  of the providence of God With the return of  every year we may say the question is asked by  this tribe of insects alone e Shall we go forth to  destroy and devour at once or shall we refrain  With every year the silent reply is experienced by  man in the unmolested condition of his fields  gardens and vineyards Oh we may ejaculate  with the Psalmist t4 Oh that men would consider  these things then should they understand the  lovingkindness of the Lord  Another and more remarkable instance of the  destruction caused by vegetableeating larvae may  be quoted from the fertile pages of the same  illustrious naturalist M Reaumur particularly  because it is the narration of one who was an  eyewitness to the facts of which he speaks In  two journeys he writes which I made from  Paris to Poitou at the commencement of the  month of September in 1730 and also in 1731  I noticed that from Paris all the way to Tours  every oak great and small had been attacked by  larva the highest branches appeared to be principally selected by them Great isolated oak trees  as well as those which formed dense forests were  alike attacked in this manner their summits being  absolutely withered and dry Had we not known  how greatly the larva may multiply and what  fearful ravages they are capable of committing  one might have conceived that some hot and  Destructive Larva and its Nest  blasting wind had reduced the leaves to this condition In certain districts the hedges along the  roadside had not a single leaf that was not  withered up The engraving represents one of  these mischievous larva it also shows the winter  nest into which they creep and a leaf which a  regiment of them have already attacked  Securely protected from the severity of the  winter of 1731 in their warm nests these larva  quitted them again early in April of 1732 to set  forth upon another mission of destruction They  had now multiplied to a degree calculated to  excite the most serious public alarm It began to  be feared that the leaves of the trees would not be  sufficient for the support of the devouring millions  and that if during that year the larva multiplied  in the same proportion as in the preceding year a  famine more terrible than any recorded in history  as produced by insect destroyers would be the  result These fears were in some measure ground¬  less as in all probability so soon as the larvae had  devoured all the leaves they would rather have  perished of hunger than have attacked the grass  and other plants But the matter was sufficiently  serious as it was The French parliament took the  alarm and determined to resist the threatened invasion of these small but formidable enemies An  edict was therefore issued calling upon all persons  to assist in removing the larvae from the trees while  they were as yet not reinforced by the addition  of countless millions more In orchards gardens  and pleasuregrounds this became a far from difficult duty because it was easy to ascend the trees  and to remove the larvae and their nests But in  dense forests where the tall trees waved high in  the air and where every branch and every twig  was loaded with larvae it was plainly impossible  Although as we know acts of parliament are  able to effect a great deal these insects set their  powers at defiance and little good was really accomplished Having thus as it were manifested  to the nation how powerless were their efforts to  remove the plague it pleased God to interfere by  his providence and a succession of cold rains for  three days in May effectually stopped the progress  of the destroyers by utterly annihilating them  Reaumurs remarks well deserve extracting he  says I had been hoping much from the effect  of these showers and attentively watched what  would be the result I saw day by day that  among the little bands of larvae which were aggregated together in order to cover the twigs of the  trees with silk or to despoil them of their leaves  there were many whose bodies became flabby  elongated and devoid of roundness These  quickly perished Every day the mortality became  more serious among them In a short time the  larvae which had previously swarmed upon the  trees became so few that before ten or twelve  days had passed by I could not find a single one  although I looked carefully for them It is re¬  markable enough and sets forth strikingly the  shortsightedness and ingratitude of man that  these very showers which produced what no combined efforts of human power could or did effect  were bitterly complained of as inappropriate to  the season at the time when they were falling  These larva were hatched from eggs deposited by  a common species of moth  Although England has been often mercifully  spared while continental countries have largely  suffered by such visitations as we have last decribed we have not always come off unscathed  The larva of a moth nearly allied to if not the  same as the lastmentioned produced an alarm in  1782 in our country perhaps even more extensive than the previous one in France All sorts of  strange and silly rumours were spread abroad  some believing that the larvse were the harbingers  of coming disease and death Poor people were  hired to cut off the webs of these larvte at the rate  of one shilling a bushel and they were then burned  under the inspection of the churchwardens and  overseers In the parish of Clapham we are told  by an author who wrote upon the history of this  insect eighty bushels were collected in one day  Prayers were offered up in some churches to  deliver the country from the apprehended approaching calamity  We need not however dwell longer upon the  vegetableconsuming larvae out of doors Unfortunately we are acquainted with instances equally  formidable within our barns storehouses and  larders In vain does man lay up the increase of  his fields with care in granaries of the best construction and using all possible precautions against  the introduction of insect enemies The weevil  called scientifically the Galandra granaria finds  entrance and in a short time makes its presence  felt in the vast destruction it produces So soon  as they are discovered they are collected with all  expedition by the owners of the stores and consigned to the flames for their misdeeds Some¬  times they are collected thus by bushels from  which it may readily be conceived what has been  the amount of damage they have done  There is a little moth whose larva is equally  mischievous in appropriating to its own use the  food and property of man its name is the Tinea  hordei This fly we are told deposits perhaps  twenty or thirty eggs in a single grain but as  one grain only is to be the portion of one larva so  soon as they are hatched they disperse by mutual  consent in a very amicable manner and each  selects its future home so that in a short time the  whole family is comfortably lodged in twenty or  thirty distinct grains of corn There surrounded  by food they live and thrive eating up all the  precious parts of the grain until nothing remains  but the husk They then fall asleep and enter  upon the further stages of insect development  No one could possibly tell by the external appearance of the corn that the least mischief had  taken place within the fulness and general aspect  of the grain being the same but on carefully  examining it a very minute hole may be found in  some spot or otherit was here the enemy got  in We need scarcely add that for any purpose  grain which has been thus attacked is rendered  perfectly useless  Any one who has ever been on a long sea  voyage will find it easy to supply us with another  example of a vegetablefood devouring larva  The hard substances commonly called captains  biscuits are the objects of attack together with  flour peas and similar articles of food and the  attacking insect is the larva of the mealworm  the entomological title of which is Tenebrio molitor  In vain does the ships cook with all his art pre¬  pare a soup composed of the richest ingredients  and calculated as one would think to gratify the  taste of the greatest epicure The larva have been  beforehand with him they have attacked and be¬  come mixed with the flour or the peas and when  the soup which has cost him so much pains is  brought to table not even the keen appetite of  seafaring people can reconcile them to it for it  is full of the dead bodies of these larva So  likewise is the biscuit and in disgust the guests  are compelled to confine their attention principally to such articles of food as are unpalatable  to their insect enemies  We have but little experience in our favoured  land of the more extensive domestic destructions  wrought by larvas But in hot countries they  become formidable by reason of their numbers  In India particularly during the rainy season the  interior of the houses swarms with them some  climb the walls some ascend the table some feast  on the viands and altogether by their numbers  and appearance they produce a degree of disgust  and loathing at food which cannot be overcome  for a long time by fresh residents We may  mention before concluding this part of our  subject that of those that do annoy us domestically some have appetites for very strange  kinds of food some love wine some vine¬  gar some butter and cheese some revel in  a pot of preserves some attack our meat and  one is mentioned by Reaumur as delighting in  chocolate  If surprise be expressed that we have dwelt so  long upon the eating propensities of larvae let it  be remembered that it was formerly said at p 94   To protect the wine from them it is customary to have little  silver covers for the wineglasses which are put on immediately  that the glass is taken from the lips  that the principal duty of the larva so long as  it lived was to eat It is born often only to eat  as much as possible and to grow as large as possible within a given time and in obedience to  this principle we find larvae with the sharpest of  sharp appetites embark in their career of existence  eating from their birth all the way along to their  final change It is therefore obviously a very  important part of the larvas history of which we  have been speaking for some pages past Considering the fact to have been now brought into  sufficient prominence we shall proceed to notice  the rate at which larvas grow and the actual  quantities of food  some of them devour Let us speak  of the last first  Silk as the  youngest of our  readers knows is  the production of  a little larva commonly called the  silkworm Now some years ago the calculation  was made that in the United Kingdom alone was  consumed every year not less than five million  pounds of raw silk By means of very accurate experiments it has been ascertained that  in order to procure one pound of raw silk we  must have twelve pounds of the cocoons spun by  these larvae In order to produce twelve pounds  of cocoons one hundred and ninetytwo pounds of  mulberryleaves must be eaten up or which is the  same thing for every pound of raw silk we have  to supply to the worms one hundred and ninetytwo  pounds of leaves We can now leave the calculation in the readers hands but we may mention  the sum total it is that for every years consumption of raw silk by our country there is a certain  consumption of ninetysix millions of pounds of mulberryleaves and as one hundred pounds of leaves  are calculated as the produce of one tree it follows  that nine millions six hundred thousand mulberry  trees must grow in order to supply food to the  silkworms necessary to furnish Great Britain with  silk for one year Let us add that this five mil¬  lion pounds of raw silk is the production of the  inconceivably great number of eighteen thousand  million silkworms The Count Dandolo who has  written an excellent treatise on this subject in  Italian made a number of experiments upon the  actual quantity of leaves devoured by the larvae  hatched from an ounce weight of eggs and he  found that the quantity of leaves consumed by  them up to the completion of their development  as larvae amounted to upwards of sixteen hundred  and nine pounds In a month from being first  hatched each larva consumes above an ounce of  leaves As at first each larva only weighs the  hundredth part of a grain it follows that it devours in thirty days about sixty thousand times  its original weight of leaves If we suppose a  puppy dog just born to weigh a quarter of a  pound and to eat in the same proportion for one  month it would have consumed at the months end  fifteen thousand pounds of food Could the puppy  eat meat from the first which as all are aware  he cannot he would at this rate devour in one  month from the time of his birth one hundred  and fifty sheep supposing each to weigh one hundred pounds or about five sheep for his daily  food These calculations will show how voracious  the larva of the silkworm are and they are probably far from being among the most voracious  of the larva only we are better acquainted with  their rate of devouring than with that of other  insects in this state  All this eating cannot of course be unattended  with a great increase in the size of the larva In  some insects growth is prodigiously rapid A naturalist who closely investigated this subject in  the common blowfly which is so apt to deposit  its eggs upon meat in hot weather found that  Growth of Silk worm Larva  in the space of fourandtwenty hours the larvae  hatched from these eggs had increased to from one  hundred and forty to two hundred times their original weight The larva of the great goat moth  we are told by another grows altogether to  about seventytwo thousand times its weight but  it takes three years so to do In thus growing  the larva becomes very fat and plump and should  it unhappily cross the path of any bird it would  probably be nipped up as a dainty morsel for the  little ones in the distant nest In birds beasts  and fishes the rate of growth is much slower and  the amount of increase much less Fortunate is  it for us that it is so for what would become of  mankind if animals of the size of dogs could grow  in a month to the size of elephants or young  elephants to the size of little kills yet these comparisons are not exaggerated remembering the  increase and growth of the silkworm and of  larvae generally  CHAPTER III  MOULTING OF THE LARVA  We are now to enter upon a very interesting  part of the history of a larva this is called moult¬  ing and consists in the larva casting off its old  skin and appearing clothed in a new garment  often more brilliant than before The change is  well and clearly described in the following passage  from the Introduction to Entomology of Messrs  Kirby and Spence A day or two previously  to each change of skin the larva ceases eating  altogether it becomes languid and feeble its  beautiful colours fade and it seeks a retreat  in which it can undergo this important and sometimes dangerous and even fatal operation in security Here either fixing itself by its legs to the  surface on which it rests or as is the case with  many caterpillars by its prolegs to a slight web  spun for this purpose it turns and twists its body  in various directions and alternately swells and  contracts its different segments The object of  these motions and contortions seems to be to separate the exterior skin now become dry and  rigid from the new one just below it After continuing these operations for some hours resting  at intervals without motion as if exhausted by  their violence the critical moment arrives the  skin splits in the back in consequence of the still  more violent swelling of the second and third  segments The opening thus made is speedily  increased by a succession of swellings and contractions of the remaining segments even the head  itself often divides into three triangular  pieces and the enclosed larva by degrees  withdraws itself wholly from its old skin  The engraving is intended to show the  larva just escaping out of its old skin  Sometimes the larva comes out of its  skin at the side sometimes it has been  seen to bite off portions of the skin ■  The most common wav is that above  described The skin when cast in this manner resembles a sort of universal coat which  has fitted into every crack and joint of the insects  body and just as a ladys glove if we could sup¬  pose it tinted of a fleshcolour and marked for the  various markings on the hand might be mistaken  if cast down after inflating it with air for a hand  cut off so only far more closely does the cast skin  represent in the minutest particular the larva  which has emerged from it It is a perfect mould  of all its parts even to the very antennae eyes  jaws c Thus say the authors last quoted  if you saved the skins cast by the larva of the  insect called Callimorpha or Arctia Caja you would  appear to have ten different specimens of caterpillars furnished with every external necessary part  and differing only in size and in the colour per¬  haps of the hairs and all representing the same  individual  In order to show how completely this is the  case some singular experiments have been made  by various observers in the following manner  Jlist before the larva v r as about to cast off its skin  they have by means of a sharp instrument cut  off one or two of its feet The larva was then  allowed to moult and was carefully examined and  it was invariably found that the feet cut off when  in its old skin were also wanting when it appeared  in its new robes thus plainly proving that the  feet were really sheathed in the old skin completely  It was just as if we had gloves on our hands and  were to put one finger or more between a pair of  sharp and powerful shears we should of course  find that when we took off the glove we should be  short of one or two fingers  But the hairs are not thus sheathed The old  skin if the larva was a hairy one such as many of  those with which we are familiar under the more  popular title caterpillars is cast off with the  hairs attached to ita circumstance which makes  the cast skin look still more like the real larva  How then it may be asked does the larva acquire  new hairs to take the place of the old ones  Were we to take a larva just before its moulting  and by a sharp and delicate instrument to slit  open and raise its old skin we should soon perceive how this has been contrived We should   there perceive sundry little tufts of very delicate  hairs lying down smoothly on the surface of the  larvas body and arranged in certain directions  with great regularity When the old skin is cast  in the course of a little time these hairs stand  upright find assume precisely the same appearance  as those on the former skin  The keeper of silkworms can tell us well and  perhaps with many a sigh that the period of  moulting is one of great peril to his tender  charge The larvae are sick and feeble for some  time after each period of moulting and large  numbers die at this time apparently unable to  bear the exhaustion attending the loss of their old  skin Larva generally are much debilitated by  each moult that takes place for a variable period  sometimes for some hours sometimes for a whole  day they will refuse food and lie without motion  All their parts are very soft and tender and re¬  quire hardening by exposure to the air After a  certain period however these effects pass off the  larva recovers its original strength its body becomes  firm its colour brightens and appears more brilliant than ever and above all like convalescents  among ourselves its appetite is twice as keen as  before which when we call to mind what has  been already said about the voracity of larva it  will be confessed appears scarcely possible  These changes of skin take place a definite  number of times in the larva of each species The  breeders of silkworms tell us that that precious  if not priceless little larva sheds its skin four  times other larvae moult oftener than these some  five times some seven times some eight times  and some nine or even ten times others again  only moult thrice The ordinary number of  moults appears to be about three or four Some  however never moult at all in the larva state  The larva of the common bee and that of  the fleshfly and some others are among this  number  Whatever may be the general opinion upon the  want of beauty and comeliness in insects and  particularly during the larva stage of their history  it is very certain that it is quite erroneous We  may possibly fail unaided by the pencil and co¬  lours of the artist in conveying even an approach  to an adequate conception of the rich and glowing  raiment with which it has pleased God to clothe  these minute and humble beings But a very  little actual observation of a few even of the commoner larvae or caterpillars of the butterfly and  moth species will convince the reader that few  other created things have been so exquisitely  adorned with magnificence of colour and apparel  as the 1 ary as of these insects Here will be found  hues so rich and deep as to   Make the roses blush of beauty pale  And dim the rich geraniums scarlet blaze  Here is a larva of a moth before us whose head  is a delicate orange colour whose belly and feet a  pale pure green whose sides are of primrose tint  variegated with slashes of green and along the  back there runs a beautiful band of white the intensity of which is most agreeably relieved by a vein  of lovely pink which divides it in the middle  There is another clothed in purple green and  white another the larva of the butterfly called  the Camberwell Beauty is of a brilliant black  dotted with spots glowing like carbuncles along  its back another has a coat which seems as if set  with precious stones blazing with an intensity of  colour which cannot be conveyed by description  In a word larvae on the whole can boast as varied  a display of beautiful hues as can almost the whole  array of flowers in our gardens In consequence  of the unfortunately too general feeling of  loathing to which allusion has already been made  but few persons are in reality acquainted with  their beauties Their diminutive size also renders  them less attractive than they might otherwise  prove since we are generally most pleased with  the beauty of an object when its size makes it so  manifest to our eyes as to render it impossible  it should escape our attention  It is a very remarkable fact and corresponds  to a certain extent with the influence of the same  agent upon plantsthat light seems to be in some  measure necessary in order to develop the colours  of the larva Thus it has been noticed that  those larva which are by their habits much in  darkness dwelling perhaps in caves of the earth  or immured in the heart of a piece of timber or  inhabiting a cell scooped out of the solid rock  are most frequently of a uniform whitish colour  Some experiments have shown that when these  whitish larvae have been brought out of darkness  and exposed to the sunlight their colour has  turned to brown Very probably this effect is due  to precisely the same kind of change as takes place  when a fairskinned European travels into a southern clime his face and hands becoming so brown  tanned and dark as to form a ludicrous contrast  to the whiteness of his chest or arms which are  not exposed to the influence of the solar ray  There is still something more to be said about  the coats of the larva To look at some of  them it would be difficult for a person unacquainted with entomology to guess at the real  nature of the object before him Some look  like dry twigs Some look far more like little  Cactuses than insects Some are clothed with  hairs arranged in the most curious and eccentric  manner Some have hairs so long as to give  them all the appearance of very minute shock  dogs In some the hairs are arranged like  stars in others like the quills of the e fretful  porcupine The backs of other larva look just  as if they were studded over with little camelhair pencils Madame Merian has described the  larva of an insect found in Surinam as having  the various divisions of its body ornamented  with three blue tubercles like turquoise beads  from each of which proceeds a long delicate  feathery plume of a black colour Another de¬  scribed by the same lady is splendidly adorned  on each side with fifty red tubercles shining  like coral from each of which proceed five or  six long hairs Some again are covered as  thickly as possible with sharp processes like  thorns sufficiently strong and sharp to pierce the  skin of any one who incautiously ventures to  take them up The body of a small caterpillar  brought from Brazil is described by Kirby and  Spence as possessing a body so thickly planted  with spines like the branches of a tree as absolutely to wear the appearance of a forest or  thicket in miniature It has been stated indeed  by some travellers that the larva of some insects  has the power of darting out when alarmed  by the approach of anything such as the human  hand from as many knobs or protuberances in its  back eight bunches of little stings with which it  inflicts a very painful and venomous wound  The larva of some insects again seem as if they  were clothed from head to foot in the most delicate  and snowy white cotton wool These may some¬  times be seen on our appletrees but one of the  most singular is figured in the cut from an en¬  graving given in Baron de Geers work The  larva is covered completely with a  coat of cottony flakes of the most  dazzling white and these are arranged as will be perceived with  great regularity The larva has in  this white and warm raiment some  Singularly cvated  Larva w hat of the aspect of a coachman  buried in the oldfashioned great coats with the  many capes  Having dwelt so long upon the food and clothing of the insect in the larva form it is right we  should now devote a little space to consider how  they breathe Some one perhaps will say Breathe  do larvae breathe Most certainly and respiration or the function of breathing is not more  necessary to us than it is to these creatures For  this purpose however we must begin a fresh  chapter  CHAPTER IV  RESPIRATION OF THE LARVA  We well know from the various melancholy accidents which have taken place that unless human  beings have a constant supply of pure fresh air they  must perish Many years ago a number of unfortunate persons were shut up in a narrow cell called  the Black Hole at Calcutta where they could  scarcely find room to stand much less obtain air to  breathe In one night the greater part of them died  More recently as some poor Irish were being conveyed in a steamer in stormy weather the captain  out of prudence and mistaken kindness ordered the  hatches to be all battened down so that fresh air  was prevented from getting in A shocking spectacle was beheld soon afterwardsin the close  suffocating cabin lay a number of dead bodies of  men women and children all destroyed by the  want of air Now precisely the same fatal results  take place if we treat larvm in the same manner  from which we learn that undoubtedly breathing  is not only one of their functions but a most  necessary and important one  This may be easily proved If the reader will  procure about a dozen caterpillars of any common  kind and put them into a dry phial corking them  closely up and if he leaves them in their prison of  glass a sufficient time all will die even though he  may have supplied them on putting them in with  an abundance of food Clearly therefore they do  not die of starvation and we should be naturally  disposed to say they must have died of suffocation  that is they died because the function of breathing  could not take place as there was not the necessary change of the air contained in the phial But  suppose that other caterpillars were procured and  put into another phial with a sufficiency of green  food the mouth being covered over with a piece of  muslin or fine lace what would then be the result  Simply that they would live and thrive for as long  a period as they received their proper quantity and  quality of food and would pass through all their  stages of existence as comfortably as if in the open  air The reason would be because the open fibres  of the muslin or lace do not interfere in the least  with the requisite change of air for respiration  Again if after corking up the bottle for a short  time we were to shake out all the caterpillars  from it and then put into it a little water in  which quicklime has been slakedsold by chemists  under the name of limewaterwe should find  it become quite white and milklike This would  be because as the physiological chemist well  knows the function of breathing causes carbonic  acid gas to be poured out of the body no matter  whether it is the body of an insect or an elephant  and this gas has the property of turning limewater  of the colour mentioned Hence we have a second  and convincing proof that larvae breathewe  need scarcely remind the reader that caterpillars  are larvaeand more than this that the function  of breathing in them resembles so far as the dis¬  charge of this peculiar gas is concerned the same  function whether carried on in the human body or  in that of the most mighty and majestic of the  beasts of the field  The great chemist Scheele has experimented  somewhat in the manner we have recommended  upon the breathing of larvae He found that when  caterpillars and maggots to use the customary  terms for these varieties of larvae were confined  in vessels containing only about eleven cubic  inches of atmospheric air and so stopped as to  preclude the ingress of any fresh air whatever  although furnished with an abundant supply of  food they soon died When he put them into a  still smaller vessel they died the sooner In fact  precisely in proportion to the purity or to the  amount of the air contained in the space in which  he confined them were their lives prolonged or  shortened He found on examining the air that  it contained as above stated carbonic acid gas  We may therefore consider the question as  settledthat larvae do breathe Strange it may  appear to some but neither in the larva nor in any  other form of its existence do insects breathe by  the mouth How then it may be asked We  shall now describe their breathing apparatus very  briefly Along each side of the body runs a delicate tube for the conveyance of air called a  trachea or when both are spoken of the tracliece  these channels run underneath the muscles and  skin and open to the air by little branch tubes  the mouths of which are called spiracles Besides  these branch tubes which open to the air the  large tubes send off a great number of smaller  ones which extend  to all parts of the  penetrating  even to the legs and  wings In some insects the spiracles  or breathing holes  ° A Spiracle open The same shut  are defended by a  pair of flaps which swing to and fro so as to  let in the air and close upon it after each  inspiration By this simple means the breathing  of insects is carried on the air enters the tubes  passes along them and is then conveyed to every  part of the body after which having fulfilled its  duties it escapes again In man and the higher ani¬  mals there is a separate place for the air in the  body which we call the lungs and here the blood  is conveyed to the air in order to be purified  But as we have just seen in insects it is very  different for in them the air is conveyed by in¬  numerable minute pipes to every portion of the  frame Such is the breathing mechanism common  in larvae which live in the air  It will be readily imagined that those larva  which dwell in the water must be furnished somewhat differently in order to enable them to  breathe And here as we shall now find there  are some very curious arrangements in order to  effect this object They may be considered under  two divisions First contrivances for breathing  air while the larva is immersed in the water  and second apparatus for extracting the dissolved  oxygen gas necessary for breathing from the  water  Let us select a few of the most singular in¬  stances under the first of these divisions No  better example Avrite the entertaining authors of  the Introduction to Entomology ee can be selected  than the gnat You must have occasionally observed in tubs of rainwater numerous little wrig¬  gling wormlike animals which frequently ascend  to the surface there remain awhile and then bending their head under the body rapidly sink again  to the bottom These are the larva of some  species of the genus just named and if you take  one out of the water and examine it you will  perceive that it is furnished near the end of the  body with a singular organ which varies in length  according to the species and forms an angle with  the last segment but one The mouth of this  organ is funnelshaped and terminates in five  points like a star and by this it is usually suspended at the surface of the water  and preserves its communication with  the atmosphere In its interior is a  tube which is connected with the  trachece and terminates in several  openings visible under a microscope  at the mouth of the organ The  points or rays of this mouth are used  to close it when the animal is dis¬  posed to sink in the water and thus Breathing apparatmoj   an aquatic Larva  cut on its communication with the  atmosphere When the animal is immersed a  globule of air remains attached to the end of the  tube so that it is in fact of less specific gravity  than water and it is not without some effort  that it descends to the bottom but when it  wishes to rise again it has only to unclose the  tube and it rises Avithout an effort to the surface  and remains suspended for any length of time  The extremity of the larva is clothed with bunches  of hairs which are furnished with some repellent  material which prevents their becoming wet It  is this repellent quality that probably causes a  dimple or depression of the surface which if you  look narrowly you will discover round the mouth  of the tube  In summer time the reader can scarcely fail of  the gratification of watching these most curious  creatures for they abound in ditches pools and  the stagnant waters of artificial fountains They  form a very curious object under the microscope  and particularly in the gas microscope or solar microscope where the image of the larvae is thrown  as in the case of the magiclantern upon a white  sheet or wall Their curious writhings to and  fro the energy they display in lashing about  their tails so as to throw the few drops of water  in which they are imprisoned into mimic whirl¬  pools their occasional dartings down to the bot¬  tom and subsequent gentle rise up to the surface  together with the terror into which countless minor  occupants of the same watery prison with them¬  selves are thrown when one of these comparative  giants plunges into the midst of them form a  spectacle as unique as it is interesting and divert¬  ing A sharp eye and a phial and cork are the  alone requisites for finding out these singular  beings on most fine days in summer But a little  while ago the writer was amused to find on a  sunny day in June the water of a small fountain  playing before his study window thickly populated  with these active larvie and it became an amusement which seldom wearied to watch their fantastic evolutions and to trace their changes from  the larva through the ulterior stage up to the perfect insect To this however we shall probably  have occasion to revert before the conclusion of  this work  Another instance of a curious contrivance for  assisting the breathing of a larva whose body is  wholly immersed in water may also be found  near home Most probably the majority of our  readers have seen or at any rate are well acquainted with the apparatus by which the diver  descends and works under water Lest some  should not we may mention that it consists of a  watertight dress which covers the diver from  head to foot while his head is enclosed in a  helmet or hood furnished with a pipe or hose  which is long enough to reach to the surface of  the water and is there generally connected with  an airpump which forces clown fresh air and so  enables the man to breathe almost as comfortably  as if he were walking on land instead of at the  bottom of the sea Let it be conceived now that  there were no airpump at the top of the hose  but simply a buoy of cork to keep it floating and  that the diver had the power of shortening or  lengthening the hose at his pleasure we should  then have a tolerably fair representation of the  contrivance with which Infinite Wisdom has sup¬  plied the humble creatures of whom we are about  to speak  By carefully examining the water running from  manure heaps or water which has become putrid  and is much loaded with mud and ooze the reader  will pretty generally be successful in discovering  a number of the larvae of a twowinged fly of  the shape represented in the cut When dis¬  covered the singularity of their structure will  amply repay him for the trifling unpleasantness  attending the search after them After washing  them in a little fair water and putting them into  a tall aleglass or German beerglass which must  be three parts filled with water they will be in  the best condition for our examination When  Reaumur first beheld them he gave them the  name of Vers a queue de rat that is larvae with a  rats tail and when the reader  looks at them as shown in the  representation annexed he will  be inclined to think with us  that a more appropriate title  could not have been found  On watching them they will  be seen to wriggle about until  are comfortably settled  darting from place to place as  if uneasy in their new position  and in the pure element By  andby however they become  reconciled to their lot and  lie perfectly quiet at the bottom of the glass in  the position represented From the tail of each  will now be seen to rise a beautifully delicate and  minute tube which comes up to the surface of  the water and here whatever be the movements  of the larva below it remains floating and free  Just as the diver may while his companions  above are pouring down torrents of fresh air  move about and perform various duties under  water so the larva may move from one position  to another and assume almost any variety of attitude but its little airpipe still retains its perpendicular direction and does not quit the surface  of the fluid  A singular experiment may now be tried with  them Let a little water be poured into the glass  by means of a funnel the end of which dips under  the water so as not to give them unnecessary disturbance and by this means the level of the water  in the glass becomes insensibly raised half an inch  or so In a few seconds it will be found that these  little tails have all lengthened themselves and are  again at the surface of the water even at its higher  level More water may be poured in until perhaps the level is raised three or four inches and  still the same thing takes place the larvae still prolong their curious tails until it seems as if they  would stretch to an indefinite length for they are  already eight or ten times longer than the body  But as we might jestingly saythe longest tail  comes to an end at last for on continuing to pour  more water in the larvae stretch their tails to the  utmost and then finding the level of the water  still above their reach they become uneasy and  REMARKABLE ORGAN  169  all quit the bottom of the glass and attach them¬  selves to its sides  Let us now examine more minutely this very  singular apparatus By a  good lens we may readily  do this as the organ is very  transparent permitting its internal structure to be beautifully seen Placing the creature in a convenient position  for our examination and in  a good light it will be presently seen that the tail is  composed in reality of two  tubes of which one slides up  and down within the other  just like the tubes of a telescope see cut By this means  the larva is provided with an  instrument capable of being  made to reach to a  great  length and yet also possessing the capability of being packed up again  in a very small compass The proper breathing  tube is the small inner one at its extremity is a  pair of spiracles or breathing pores and surround¬  ing these are placed five minute bristles which  are supposed to act somewhat as a buoy and to  retain the tail in its position Where  the tail joins on to the body of the  larva two tubes thrown into folds are  placed which are connected with the  breathing tubes of the tail at one end  and with the breathing pipes which run  along the body of the larva at the other  When the tail is pushed out to its farthest these zigzag tubes are stretched  quite straight when it is drawn in  End of the Tau again they are thrown into folds Both  these appearances are shown in the plate It has  been supposed that the larva causes the tube  to be pushed out by forcing air into it and thus  causing the zigzag tubes to straighten themselves  Perhaps the tail is drawn in by the same tubes  contracting again and thus folding together and  dragging back the tube to which they are connected  We need scarcely stop to mention how useful is  this admirable contrivance to the insect Having  to seek for their food at the bottom of ditches  drains or puddles they are necessarily exposed to  the risk of suffocation unless fresh air can be conveyed to them and it is difficult for us to imagine  how any apparatus could have been contrived  which would have adapted itself to all the varying  depths of water in which the insect must be constantly living as it changes from place to place  He must have been a clever engineer who could  have successfully met this difficulty None of our  present diving apparatus does so The organ we  have been considering the creation of an Infinite  Mind small and despicable as it may seem in our  eyes fulfils perfectly every function for which it  was formed It admits of free movement from  place to place it admits moreover of free change  from one level to another in the fluid by which the  larva is surrounded and it is at the entire disposal  of the insect which can without the smallest inconvenience accommodate it to the various circumstances in which it may be placed  Possibly the same phial in which was brought  home the lastnamed larvce with the rats tail  will furnish us with an equally elegant instance  of larvarespiration under water in the case of the  larva of a fly called the chameleon fly This  little creature if it can be found and though not  as common as the last it may yet be detected in  summer by the edge of ponds c has truly elegant habits The great Swammerdam who first  described it was lost in admiration at it The  extremity of its body is furnished with a coronet  of about thirty elegantly feathered  hairs These are under the control  of the insect and are capable of  being folded up so as to enclose a  minute bubble of air When the  larva is weary of remaining at the  top of the water and wishes to dive  to the still and cool depths below it  causes these hairs so to fold up and  close upon each other as to include  the airbubble so that it cannot  escape Thus furnished with a  ward and thus breathes under water until the  purity of the captive airbubble is impaired when  it returns to the surface to repeat the same  operations The appearance of the little bubble  shining with a brilliant silvery lustre under the  water is very pleasing and accounts for the  enthusiastic expressions used by Swammerdam  in speaking of the visible manifestation of the skill  of God in this insect The fact of an insect  coming to the surface for air and stealing away a  portion then diving down again into the waters is  not uncommon in insect history although few are  possessed of so elegant a contrivance for effecting  it as the larva in question  We must pass on to mention an instance or  two of larvre which from the peculiarity of their  respiration come under the second of our divisions  that is they live in the water and do not breathe  air but obtain the gas necessary for their respiration from the water which holds it in a state of  solution We shall first speak of the larva of the  common Mayfly the perfect insect of which is so  well known to and highly prized by anglers  under the various names of duns and drakes  than which in some streams no insect that flies is  a better bait to the unwary fish Should the  reader wish to examine them for himself they  may be found in May or June hiding themselves  during the day in the mud or underneath stones  or in little holes in the banks or taking a subaqueous tour upon the bed of the brook while the  clear and purling waters roll smoothly on above  them Their little underwater cells are shown  in the cuts together  with the larva  Their organs for  breathing the water  if the expression  which is in some  measure correct may  be admitted are  very like the gills  of a fish But instead of forming a part of the  structure of the mouth and head as those of  the fish in the larva  they are placed  along its body and  are arranged in  pairs A delicate  little airtube enters into each of  these gills and  there branches out  into a great many  directions this tube  the large trachea or breathing vessel of the insect  running along its body The air entering these  gills and thus being exposed to a large surface of  water containing dissolved gas loses its impurities  and absorbs the pure gas from the water whence  it is then conveyed to the various parts of the  body In many species of these larvse the whole  series of gills are moved to and fro incessantly and  so quickly as to be scarcely perceptible to the eye  Some of them use them as oars moving with inconceivable rapidity and being capable of darting  both backwards and forwards with great quickness They have also the power of leaping or  springing in the water to a considerable distance  and feed on minute aquatic larvie and on vegetable matters  The only other instance of this kind that Ave  shall quote will be that of the terrible larva of  the dragonfly whose deeds of insect murder came  before us on a former occasion The apparatus  provided for them is very singular and has been  described with his usual accuracy by the talented  Reaumur It exists in the tail of the insect and  may be readily watched in action by adopting the  following expedientPour into a small glass in  which the larva has been put and which is half  full of water a few drops of a solution of carmine  by means of a little tube introduced into the  water and made to drop its contents near the  tail of the creature Immediately it will be seen  that the coloured liquid is rapidly sucked in by  the tail of the insect and then after the expiration  of a little time is forced back again in a tiny jet  with considerable violence to a distance of several  inches Reaumur tells us that if we hold the  insect between the finger and thumb gently and let  fall a drop of water on its tail we shall presently  see it eagerly sucked in the body of the insect  becoming sensibly larger and byandby it is  thrown out again Sometimes it raises its tail  above the surface of the water and whether for  sport or not it is hard to say squirts the water in  a mimic jet to some distance  The apparatus has been described as resembling  the piston or plunger of a forcepump which  moves to and fro within a cavity inside the insects  body and by that means draws in and forces out  the water The tail is defended by a sort of  coronet composed of five hard bristlelike pieces  which are under the control of the creature and  may be opened and closed at pleasure The  larva appears capable of inflicting a somewhat  painful pinch by this contrivance so that what  with its wonderful mask with its powerful squirt  and with its tail thus armed it would be difficult  to select another insect better prepared for battle  with creatures of every aquatic tribe than it  The action of the pumping apparatus sends it  rapidly forward through the water somewhat like  a paddlewheel or at least upon the same principle  as that contrivance namely the resistance offered  by the water to the stroke of this apparatus  CHAPTER Y  MEANS OF DEFENCE OF THE LARVA  There is perhaps no period in the life of an insect when it is so much in danger of the attacks  of foes as when it is in the larva state Possessed  at the best with but very feeble powers of locomotion in comparison with those of winged insects it is continually exposed to destruction on  all sides from which it has not the power to escape  Not only do insects of various species particularly  select the larva for the object of their attacks but  birds and other creatures are also in the lists  against them Thus imperilled what chance has  the larva against foes so numerous and in a contest so unequal It lias been calculated that a  pair of sparrows for their ow T n consumption and  for that of their tender brood destroy at least  three thousand caterpillars in a week and we  well know what multitudes of larvas fall into the  clutches of the cawing rooks which follow the tail  of the plough The winged insects are tolerably  secure although many even of their ranks fall  victims to the swiftwinged swallow and sandmartin and to the rapid leap of the artful trout But  the poor crawling larvae are neither strong enough  to fight nor swift enough to flee and fall by thousands into the unsparing hands of their various  enemies  Yet the Creator who has wisely appointed a  large portion of their numbers for food to many  creatures has also taken many precautions to prevent their being entirely annihilated as might  otherwise have been the case These are well deserving a brief notice previous to our passing on  to the last stage in the history of the larva From  what has been already said about the coats of various larvae it may be imagined that that must be  a stouthearted enemy which could venture to  attack some of them The spines and hard excrescences with which they are furnished must  undoubtedly prove far from agreeable to the touch  of a foe and there can be no question that this  sort of armour is of itself a good defence to many  larvae Others form artificial coverings which are  equally useful by concealing them from the notice  of their enemies Thus as we have before remarked some dwell in tubes of leaves hid from  every eye others encase themselves in a shield of  cemented gravel or shells like those represented  in the cut presenting a most grotesque appearance  others hide themselves  in variouslyformed cells  Some immediately on  Larva Case of Shells beinsf touched roll them  selves up like hedgehogs into a ball which looks  like a little globe of hairs and is so slippery  that it cannot be retained between the fingers  others again when they are touched instantly  drop down and from their colour resembling precisely that of the herbage into which they have  fallen it becomes next to fruitless to search for  them  A very singular larva which both for offence  and defence adopts a most extraordinary procedure must be mentioned by itself This larva  is not unfrequently to be found in our houses and  is said to feed upon our disgusting and annoying  invadersthe bugs but it so completely contrives to conceal its real character that not once  in a hundred times would it probably be recognised as an insect at all It collects together a  number of particles of sand or fragments of  wool or silk or earth and with singular skill contrives to form a sort of coat out of these in which  it envelopes itself Thus attired as may be imagined it is not easy to discover what the object  really is and it thus undoubtedly escapes the  undesirable notice of any of its enemies But more  than this like those North American Indians  who hunt by concealing themselves in the skins  of wolves and so attract less attention from the  herd than they would do if they were to expose  themselves in their natural aspect to view this  crafty larva steals upon its prey in much the same  manner although it can run with sufficient swift¬  ness when necessary It creeps forward with the  greatest stealth moving only one leg at a time  and thus quite insensibly approaches its victim  who is not at all alarmed at what merely appears  to be a lump of dust Soon however it is convinced of its fatal mistake and discovers the  terrible fact that it is in the embrace of an unsparing devourer  Other larvre escape notice in a singular manner  by their close resemblance to little pieces of stick  Thus we are told by Messrs Kirby and Spence  that there is a certain tribe of caterpillars called  surveyors Geometrce that will sometimes support  themselves for whole hours by means of their  posterior legs solely upon their hinder extremity  forming an angle of various degrees with the  branch on which they are standing and looking like one of its twigs The body is kept  stiff and immovable with the separations of the  segments scarcely visible it terminates in a knob  the legs being applied close so as to resemble a  bud at the end of a twig besides which it often  exhibits intermediate tubercles which increase the  resemblance Its colour too is usually obscure  and similar to that of the bark of a tree so that  doubtless the sparrows and other birds are frequently deceived by this manoeuvre and thus  balked of their prey Bbsels gardener mistaking  one of these caterpillars for a dead twig started  back in great alarm when upon attempting to  break it off he found it was a living animal  Some however are actually armed so as to  offer an active resistance to the onslaught of any  enemy Mr Abbot has described a terrible  caterpillar well known in certain districts in  America under the strange title of the Hickory¬  horned Devil This creature is furnished with  seven or eight strong hornlike spines upwards of  half an inch in length which project from its head  and anterior segments When threatened by  danger the caterpillar does not attempt to fly  but lifts up its head menacingly and shakes it  about in a very fierce manner The negroes  in particular are so terrified at its aspect that  they dread it as much as the rattlesnake But  in reality it is harmless and Mr Abbot in  order to convince the ignorant people that such  was the case took hold of it in their presence  without receiving any injury This however  did not convince them and they made answer that  although it did not sting him it would undoubtedly sting them  The weapon of another is thus pleasantly de¬  scribed by De Geer In the month of July  I found a caterpillar resting upon a small twig  which I cut off in order to enable me to ex¬  amine it more attentively As I was scrutinizing  its appearance I happened accidentally to touch  its body Instantly there shot out from a spot near  the head two streams of clear fluid which struck  me on the face and partly entered one of my eyes  causing a very acute but fortunately not a very  enduring pain My surprise at this salute prevented my taking particular notice of the place  from whence the jets proceeded It appears probable that this caterpillar has been thus endowed  with this squirting apparatus to enable it to defend  itself against its enemies or at least to assist in  frightening or perhaps in hunting its prey For  myself I confess after the reception I had met  with I felt some degree of fear at too nearly approaching it  On examining them carefully at another opportunity this entomologist found that these cater  pillars were provided with a squirting apparatus  situated in a cleft in the neck When the creature is irritated  it thrusts out a  curious organ divided into four  branches and  drilled with holes  like the rose of  a watering pot  FrOm this organ Squirting Larva The Cleft and squirting Organ are  shoot the jets of shown separately  liquid spoken of After the discharge they are  drawn in again and covered over by the closing  up of the cleft Strange to say when taken in¬  doors the caterpillar lost the power of squirting  altogether It appeared as if it could only do so  in the open air where a number of insect enemies  were arrayed against it This caterpillar is commonly known as that of the Pussmoth and has  sometimes caused the most strange and foolish  country tales by its striking appearance It has  been described as a horrible monster having a  head like a lion jaws like a shark a horn like a  unicorn and two tremendous stings in its tail  Certainly its appearance is not the most engaging  in the world as may be conceived from the representation of it in the cut and what adds to its  singularity is that it possesses the power of lashing  its sides with its tail so as to drive away flies If  the reader should be fortunate enough to find one  he may have some amusement in examining all the  curious apparatus with which this rather forbidding looking insect is supplied  The winter draws near and sends its foretokening cold breathings to warn every creature vegetable and animal that the dark season is arriving  when food is no longer to be obtained What is  to become of the larva Can it endure the penetrating tooth of frost or the overwhelming shower  of rain Or can it endure to be from week to  week from month to month without a mouthful of  food From the facts already stated with reference to the age of larva it is very certain  that many larvae have to bear these trials and  some not merely during one but during several  winters We must therefore inquire how they  have been defended or strengthened so as to  enable them so to do  The alteration in the coats of animals during  winter or rather just previous to it and the  fact that animals destined to inhabit the arctic  regions are enveloped in coats of the shaggiest  hair are well known to every person There can  be no doubt that in many instances in the insect  world where a larva has to be exposed to the  frosts of winter the same provision of a hairy  covering which has been given to them by the  Creator is intended to meet the same end and  to preserve their soft and tender bodies from the  destructive influence of extreme cold The following striking observation of a talented entomologist who has not thought it beneath him to  write a most interesting book only on the family  of ants M Huber shows very clearly that such  is in fact the intention of providing the larva with  a covering of this kind He noticed that the larvae  of some species of ants destined to pass through  the winter were furnished with this kind of warm  clothing while those which were not so destined  had smooth coats that is even in the same  species thus proving to us beyond a doubt  that as the winter approached the warm coat  was put on by the larva The engraving on  the last page represents some extraordinary specimens of hairiness in caterpillars from Brazil now  in the British Museum  A large number of larvae become torpid during  winterthey are not deadthey are not sensibly  alivethey are plunged in that long halfdeath  which affects not only them but also many large  animals who retire in winter lie down to sleep for  weeks and awake to find the cold departing and  the springtime nigh at hand But the frost some¬  times proves too severe for them and the poor in¬  sects become sometimes congealed into solid lumps  of ice Alas we shall exclaim then there is an  end to their life when that takes place and  undoubtedly the severity of such a degree of  cold destroys large numbers yet strange to say  some larvae actually revive even after they have  been thus frozen into hard inanimate lumps One  observer states that he has found them in this  condition and so entirely congealed that they  chinked like small stones when dropped into a  glass tumbler yet they revived after careful  management In an experiment made during  Sir John Rosss voyage to the arctic regions upon  the larvae of a moth they were four successive  times exposed to the intense cold of 40° below  zero and four times they revived again on being  brought into the warm atmosphere of the cabin  Experiments have also been made by other persons  with a like result It may therefore be considered certain that some larvas will bear to be frozen  into solid masses so that they will snap asunder  like an icicle and yet return to life again and  even go through all their stages of development  into the perfect insect How remarkable a fact  this is when we remember the deadly effect of  frost upon man and the higher animals  Many larvae however form nests of various  kinds in which they comfortably spend the dreary  days and nights of this stern season 44 With this  view write the excellent observers Kirby and  Spence 44 the larva of Cossus ligniperda forms a  covering of pieces of wood lined with fine silk  those of some other moths excavate under a stone  a cavity exactly the size of their bodies to which  they give all round a coating of silk and the larvae  of Pieris Cratcegi enclose themselves in autumn in  cases of the same material and thus pass the cold  season in small societies of from two to twelve  under a common covering formed of leaves Bonnet mentions a trait of the cleanliness of these insects which is almost ludicrous He observed in  one of these nests a sort of sack containing nothing  but grains of excrement and a friend assured him  that he had seen one of these caterpillars partly  protrude itself out of the case the hind feet first  to eject a similar grain so that it would seem the  society have on their establishment a scavenger  whose business it is to sweep the streets and  convey the rejected matters to one grand repository This however singular is rendered not  improbable from the fact that beavers dig in  their habitations holes solely destined for a like  purpose as do also badgers  A singular variety of larvanest is mentioned  by a Mexican traveller He says ct After having  ascended for about an hour we came to the region  of oaks and other majestically tall trees the names  of which I could not learn Suspended from their  stately branches were innumerable nests enclosed  apparently in white paper bags in the manner of  bunches of grapes in England to preserve them  from birds and flies I had the curiosity to  examine one of them which I found to contain  numberless caterpillars The texture is so strong  that it is not easily torn and the interior contained a quantity of green leaves to support the  numerous progeny within  The larvae of some Australian insects form the  most curious nests we have ever beheld A  representation taken from specimens in the entomological collection at the British Museum will  show what extraordinary structures these are  They appear like minute bundles of faggots and  have been formed by the insect cutting short pieces  of twigs all nearly of the same size and then  cementing them together in the manner represented Some of these are of a large size as  large as a moderatesized pear others are smaller  and these present the most beautifully regular appearance consisting of a number of very small  Australian Larvacases  rods bound together in a cylindrical form like  the fasces of the Roman soldiery  In this manner larvce pass through the winter  Without a doubt many perish but there remain  infinite numbers at the end of this season which  from the depths of their cells become sensible  to the influence of spring so soon as the first  footsteps of that season are felt upon the earth  The larva wakens to active life once more and  with an appetite rendered all the keener by its  fast of four or five months it leaves its dormitory  and begins to consume whatever suitable food may  lie in its way and so it continues until the time  of its change approaches  CHAPTER VI  PREPARATION FOR A CHANGE  The last stage of the larvas history hastens on  Its career of activity and voracity is nearly ended  and the insects days in this form are well nigh  spent Hitherto it has been an earthly earth  loving being without either the desire or the power  to raise itself into the airy element in which multitudes of its species are disporting the day long If  we may so speak its highest desires have only been  confined to the quality and quantity of its food  possessing these it was content But now its  hours of feasting are come to a close and it has to  make ready for a great and momentous change  The crawling and perhaps repulsive creature  which we turn from without regret has a high des¬  tiny to accomplish when the period of its sojourn  in its vile body is fully accomplished and then  that form which now creeps among the dust of the  world shall mount up as on eagles wings and be  carried whither it will through the pure regions of  the sky  The age to which the larva generally attains  before this change takes place is exceedingly variable To some it is permitted to reach the  venerable age of four or five years others three  and many not nearly so much The dung and  fungusfeeding insects as if hastened forward by  the warmth of their position are at the end of  their larva life in a week others live a fortnight  in this state and others several months We  are told of a curious anecdote of a beetle which  had existed in a desk set up in an office in Lon¬  don for upwards of twenty years half of which  period according to Messrs Kirby and Spence it  must have lived as a larva But this is quite an  exception to the general rule  For some days before the larva loses its long  distinguishing characteristicits appetite and  now forsakes the plants upon which it formerly  fed or if it does not forsake them no longer  consumes any part of them It becomes apparently in some degree sensible that it is approach¬  ing the most dangerous period of the history of  the insectfine state of sleep or torpor in which  it is to exist as a pupaof which we shall speak  more particularly in our next chapter Before  although a weak and comparatively a defenceless  creature it was still able to exercise a vigilant  watch against its enemies and thus to avoid them  or to prepare for their reception but now its eyes  are to be closed in a deathlike slumber its body  to hang a tempting bait to any wandering foe or  hungry bird and it can in no way resist the attacks of the feeblest adversary  As if fully aware of this the wonderful instinct  of the larva meets the difficulty by teaching  it to select the best place for its concealment  from a dangerous notice With this view it  sets out in search of a hidingplace and rests  not until it has obtained a city of refuge which  may prove to it a defence against the enemy  It may be some little recess covered by an  irregular stone and sheltered round the sides  by moss and the upspringing grass or perhaps  a little hole in the earth has received the poor  fugitive from future harm and in order to conceal  itself more completely it has drawn over the  mouth of the cave a covering of leaves Here  safe from observation the larva bids a farewellto  speak as the poets speakto the busy staring  world for awhile and loses all recollection of its  past history in the night of torpidity upon which  it has now entered The larvie of the ladybird and  other insects glue themselves fast to the under side  of a twig or leaf and here pass the days of their  sleep in safety Many of the larvae of insects  whose life up to this period has been passed be¬  neath the surface of some glassy pool now quit  the pure element and seek the shore on which  they are to pass the remaining portion of their  existence  But there are two other ways in which larvie  prepare for the state of pupa which are so curious and prevail to such a large extent among  insects that we may be excused for following the  example of all authors upon insect history and  treating our readers to the interesting facts which  have been recorded by various observers upon  this subject One of these is the plan of hanging  themselves up in the air like sailors in their hammocks and in other positions this plan is commonly called the suspension of the larva The other  is the formation of beautiful cases of various kinds  which are called cocoons in which they wrap  themselves up close during the period to be de¬  voted to the pupa state Let us speak of these  each separately and first of the case or cocoon  as a place of concealment for the larva It is  right however to premise that while the greater  number of insects are in a torpid or halftorpid  state while in the pupa form all are not so as  will be noticed in the next chapter and those  which are not do not of course require the protection of a cocoon or the contrivance of a silken  hammock  The material of which the case or cocoon is  composed is a beautiful silken fibre which is furnished by a spinning apparatus placed either at  the extremity of the body or more frequently at  the mouth of the insect whence it proceeds in a  filament of the utmost delicacy and transparency  but at the same time of considerable tenacity  By its means alone cocoons of a number of  different kinds some of extraordinary beauty and  ingenuity are constructed but in other cases  the insect has recourse to various materials to  assist in giving strength to the walls of its cell  The best example and the most familiar one we  can select of a purely silken cocoon is that of  those  spinning worms  That in their green shops weave the smoothhaired silk  This beautiful and valuable cocoon when ex¬  amined externally appears to be formed in two  different ways for the outer covering is loose and  open while the inner one is compact and close  and so in truth it is although both coverings are  formed of a single thread The outer has been  Cocoon of Silkworm  called the scaffolding by means of which the inner  and more solid covering is constructed The larva  stationing itself between two leaves or in any  other suitable spot fastens its thread to one of  the adjoining surfaces and then proceeds to draw  out the fibre and fasten it in various positions  until it has woven around itself an envelope as it  were of loose gauze After this has been done  it begins to form the closer and more compact  structure of the inner envelope laying on the silk  backwards and forwards in a series of zigzags  until it has laid on several layers and thus completely shut itself in The loose outer portion  forms what ladies so well know under the title  of flossilk the inner fibres are the most continuous admitting of being wound off without  breaking and they form the ordinary silk of  commerce  M Lyonnet has given a most interesting account  of the proceedings of another larva which fnr surpasses the silkworm in the ingenuity of its manner of forming the cocoon This larva is very  small in fact not more than the sixth of an inch  in length and is found on the under side of oak  leaves M Lyonnet observes that beyond all  the larvae he had ever watched he considered this  creature the most inconceivably ingenious work¬man Its little cocoon is of a white colour and of  a long oval form having its upper surface ornamented with seven upright ridges The first  thing the creature begins by doing is to erect in  EXTRAORDINARY PRECAUTION OF A LARVA 201  the most curious manner a series of little upright  palisades of silk at a certain distance from each  other all round its body so as to form a sort of  oval fence and probably the larva intends them to  serve as a sort of hedge to keep off intruders  while it is busy at work After spinning half  its case it turns  round and begins at the opposite end and thus  forms the other  half it then unites The Larva surrounded by its Palisade  it in the middle and by so doing incloses itself  in a very pretty cage of silken network which it  subsequently strengthens by adding a firm layer  on the inside The time taken in the construction  of this ingenious cocoon is not more than halfan  hour It is quite impossible to understand how  the little being contrives to form the upright  ridges on the surface of its cocoon and as the  larva is so minute it is almost hopeless to expect  to discover it Attempts have been made to un¬  ravel the difficulty but not with complete success  When looking at some magnificent works of man  we are tempted to become inflated with pride  let the remembrance of what this tiny insect can  do keep us humble and direct our admiration  rather to Him who is the Author of all wisdom  the Giver of every good and perfect gift  Upon the leaves of pear trees we may some¬  times find a pretty cocoon of very slight and  elegant texture formed of silk as shown in the  cut  A very singular cocoon  is spun by the larva of  a common moth some¬  what of the outline of a  balloon in form This  cocoon is spun in a very  slight manner and thus  offers a striking contrast  to those of many other  insects in fact it is so  slight and the meshes are  so open that the insect  can be readily seen within  suspended in a hammock  Cocoon on a Pearleaf  of silk and thus presenting a very curious appearance In another the inclosed insect looks just  like a poor prisoner within a grating  In order to give a sufficient degree of strength to  their cocoons some larvae adopt the plan of form¬  ing them partly of silken fibre and partly of other  materials Reaumur being on an entomological  excursion in the forest of Vincennes on a fine day  in the month of May fell in with a most curious  cocoon formed by a larva which feeds upon the  oaktree At first he could scarcely conceive  what the object he saw before him was but on  removing the branch it proved to be a very singular cocoon Detaching a small branch on which  was a larva just commencing its cocoon Reaumur  finding the evening draw on set out on his return  home The larva did not seem to discover the  fact of its being carried away a prisoner and as the  entomologist carried the branch with gentleness  it proceeded with its task as comfortably as if  stationed on the tree it was now leaving behind  Reaumur beguiled the tedium of the way by  carefully watching its mode of proceeding in the  formation of its cocoon He thus noticed the  larva cutting very delicate layers of the fine upper  skin or epidermis of the bark of the twig which it  fastened together by silken cords and then formed  into two winglike pieces fastened on each side of  the twig in the manner represented in the cut  something like the feathers of an arrow in appearance And now this  being done the difficulty was to draw the  two sides together and  so to convert them into  a covering for its body  The manner in which  this was done will  hardly perhaps be  imagined It will be  best understood if the  reader will cut out two  pieces of paper of the  shape of these two side  Cases formed of Epidermis of Bark portions fasten them  on with a little glue by one of their edges to a  piece of twig and then by a fine needle and thread  draw them together by stitching from side to side  all the way up The larva does something very  like this for it fixes silk cords to each of the outer  edges and then pulls and hauls with all its might  until it has forcibly bent over the layers until they  meet and then it ties the edges together by short  cords so as to produce a seam so beautifully close  even and fine as would put the finedrawing  of the most superlative tailor to shame in fact  the join is frequently quite imperceptible Having  done this it lines the inside with beautiful tapestry  of silk By the time Reaumur and his friends had  got to the end of their walk which occupied an  hour and a little more the larva had after vast  labour joined together its seams and far advanced  toward the completion of its task  Reaumur made also some most interesting observations upon a larva which constructs its cocoon  of a sort of silken mesh the interstices of which  are filled with grains of  earth Having broken  off the top of a cocoon  he witnessed the singular spectacle of the  larva proceeding to  mend it again With¬  out leaving its cell the  patient labourer put its  head out of the opening  in the attitude represented in the cut and after looking about for a  little time picked up one by one a number of  grains of earth which it stored up in its case  After this it filled up the sides of the opening  with a network of silk working the grains of  earth into it as it proceeded For three hours the  larva worked incessantly at its task and at the  end of that time had materially reduced the size  of the opening Reaumur was now curious to  observe how the opening still left would be filled  up as the insect could no longer put its head out  and he expected to see it filled up with a mesh of  silk But he had not given the larva due credit  for ingenuity in making this supposition It filled  up the opening first with a mesh of silk but be¬  tween the meshes in a most curious manner it  thrust out some little grains of earth which it had  previously stored up until they actually appeared  on the outside and any one would have sup¬  posed they had been laid on from without It  finally ended its labours by coating the inside of  the opening also with a layer of earth Reaumur  afterwards cut the cocoon in half with a knife  and by that means was enabled to see how successfully the larva had repaired the injury  We must now speak briefly of the Suspension  of the Larva ancl it may be mentioned that the  insects whose larvas perform this manoeuvre are  almost exclusively the butterfly tribe There are  various ways of effecting this object The spinning apparatus by which the cords are to be formed  to sustain the body of the insect in the air is  situated in the mouth of the larva and it may well  be imagined that the insect which is about to hang  itself up by the tail has no easy task to perform in  having to fasten its cords to the tail and then to  the branch above it If a spider wished to hang  itself up by the tail it would be a very easy thing  so to do for the spinning apparatus is placed there  and it has only to let itself fall from a branch  after first glueing the end of the cord to it but a  larva is differently circumstanced and it requires  no slight display of ingenuity to accomplish its  purpose  Its first process is to select a suitable leaf or  twig upon which it weaves a sort of little mound  of silk of the shape of a button This done it  examines it carefully to ascertain its strength and  satisfied therewith it then proceeds to thrust its  two hind legs in amongst the threads of which  the button is composed and in so doing it causes  the hooklike processes which fringe these legs to  become securely entangled in them It then is  safe as to the issue and now lets its body drop  down fearless of the most violent rockings to  which even a tempest might expose it  Another way of suspending themselves is almost  equally singular with this It may be witnessed  by the reader if he will take the pains to collect  the larva of the common white butterfly found in  abundance upon our cabbage rows and by properly attending to feeding and watching them  this curious proceeding may generally be observed  in a few at least of the number supposing that  the others may have hung themselves up without  being seen in the very act If we were to set a  mountebank to the task this larva has to perform  it may well be doubted whether with the richest  reward before him he could manage to effect it  First he would have to tie both his feet fast to a  branch so that he would swing head downwards  then in order to hang himself in the horizontal  posture he must bend his body up fasten a cord  round the branch in a proper place so as to form  a loop and then put his head and body into it so  that it would support him comfortably just under  the arms Probably the most supplejointed gentleman would find himself discomfited in the  attempt The caterpillar in question however  does all this and more for it has to spin the ropes  with which it is to be suspended Fixing its  hinder part in the manner just described to the  little button of silk which it first forms it then  spins the girth in  which it intends to  trust its safety by  the apparatus of  the mouth Some Horizontal Suspension  times larvas tie themselves in an upright position  as martyrs to a post but the most common  method is the horizontal one  giving the insect the resemblance of a sailor swinging  in his hammock  We must ask attention  before we close our chapter  to one more account of the  proceedings of a larva and  this too is in a common insect   perhaps the housewife  would say a little too common  the meatfly This larva when its days in that  condition are at their close quits its long greedily  devoured and disgusting food and penetrates into  the earth there it contracts its body in a singular manner and its skin becomes thickened and  hard so as to form a sort of parchmentlike case  inside which its jaws are cast off instead of out¬  side as is commonly the rule Were such an  extraordinary transformation as this to happen  to one of the larger animals it would be held forth  as altogether miraculous writes Mr Rennie  Were a lion or an elephant for example to coil  itself up into a ball compressing its skin into  twice the thickness and half the extent while it  remained uniform in shape and without joinings  or openings and at the same time were it entirely to separate its whole body from this skin  lie within it as a kernel does in a nut or a chick  in an egg throwing off its now useless tusks into  a corner and then after a space should it ac¬  quire wings break through its envelope and take  its flight through the air there would be no  bounds to our admiration Yet the very same  circumstances in miniature take place every day  during summer almost under the eye of every  individual in the case of a blowfly without  attracting the attention of one person in a million  So much more are we attracted by great things  than by small  The work of preparation finished the insect  securely buried in its cell or warmly surrounded  by its cocoon or hanging up to the branch of a  tree or in any other way concealed from view or  protected from injury little more remains to be  added to the larva history Its last action after  settling itself in a comfortable position is to cast  off its skin which is generally in the case of those  larvse which inhabit cells or cocoons left inside the  recess sometimes it is cast out The period at  which the insect ceases to belong to the larva  stage and passes into the next varies and will  receive notice in the following chapter  When in the vengeance of God upon the guilty  land of Egypt it pleased Him to send the plague  of insects the exclamation of the magicians was   This is the finger of God Such in an admiring  sense may be ours also as we look back upon what  we perceive God to have done for this humble  portion of His creation in the few past pages  What provision what wonderful forethought and  wisdom has not been exercised upon beings which  man despises or even abhors and which fall  daily by thousands under foot crushed and forgotten except by a few Let us search the green  lanes and hedgerows more assiduouslylet us  poke even into the dirtiest cornerslet us examine  well the leaves and branches in our gardens the  depths of the purling brook the cavities of the  aged trunks and the cracks in the deepfurrowed  barklet us look narrowly upon the cabbages and  nettles as well as upon the rosebush and myrtle  let no place in a word be beneath our scrutiny no  object beneath our notice let us do this and we  shall not need to sigh after foreign scenes or the  majestic wonders of nature for we shall have a  microcosm a world of wonders in a table drawer  and an exhaustless theme of admiration in the  contents of a tumbler of water  PART III THE PUPA  CHAPTER I  THE TRANSFORMATION  Hanging to the slender branch of yonder rose  tree swinging to and fro with the gentle air which  blows in scented waves through the flowergarden  is a little object to which we wish to direct attention Had not notice been thus directed to it in  all probability we should have passed it by if we  observed it at all only considering it to be a  broken twig or withered leaf suspended by a cob¬  web We may examine it minutely but all is  quiet and motionless in the little mass and it is  impossible to detect the least sign of life A casual  eye would rest upon it without interest and would  turn away from it uninstructed as to its nature and  properties In colour it has nothing to attractif  is of a dirty white or brown and in shape it is  though curious so small and so uninviting that  few would take the trouble to pay much attention  to it Day by day it swings from its silken cord  and is to all appearance an object without interest  to all around it  Yet this slumbering unattractive mass contains  a living being Though the aspect of death has  passed upon it and though we may perhaps be un¬  able to detect the symptoms of movement in its  parts it is yet alive and the lapse of a little time  will convert the slumbering being thus singularly  hung up to be the sport of the wind and rain into  a creature more extraordinarily active than per¬  haps any other in the animal creation While  it sleeps great changes are taking place it is  receiving new organs it is being matured developed perfected fitted for a nobler existence and  for a higher range of duties than it has yet  known Such is the pupa  From these remarks it will be sufficiently  evident that this chapter of our insect history has  to speak of a period when there are but few traces  of active existence in the insect and it might  therefore be supposed there remained little to be  said upon a period of the insects life which is only  comparable to a prolonged sleep But entomological science is too rich in interesting matters  upon every subject to admit this conclusion and  we shall find that there is much to be narrated  which equally with what has formerly been  written is calculated to raise our admiration to  the Great and Beneficent Author of all Nature  If we turn to a Latin Dictionary and hunt out  the word which stands at the head of this chapter  Pupa we shall find several definitions of it given  for example a little girl a doll and a baby What  have either of these to do with an insect some  will exclaim and they may feel disposed to con¬  sider the great Linnaeus who gave the insect  tribes while in this stage this title to have been  not over happy in his selection of terms But  those who thus exclaim have perhaps only seen  babies as they are clothed in England possessing  the power and comfort of free movement and  having their arms and legs at liberty Between  the aspect of these little creatures and our insects  no one can trace any resemblance But it is very  different on the continent there out of the  strange notion that it will keep the poor little  beings limbs straight it is the custom to wrap  babies up in swaddling clothes until they can  neither stir hand nor foot and they are  made to resemble Egyptian mummies  as nearly as possible Babies wrapped  up in this cruel and barbarous manner  form objects of so peculiar an appearance that it is quite ludicrous to trace  the resemblance between them and the  pupce of insects and therefore Linnaeus  as it appears could scarcely have selected a better  epithet for the insect than its present title of pupa  as it too has the aspect of being wrapped up in  swaddling bands  But as we formerly mentioned with regard to  larvae all insects in the pupa state are not called  popularly by their scientific and correct name  Those that are closely wrapped up and are in fact  complete mummy insects are called sometimes by  the term Chrysalis or Aurelia because they are  sometimes of a golden lustre the one being derived  from the Latin the other from the Greek term  for i gold and this even when they are not gilded  in this manner Again when as we shall presently have to notice the insect in the pupa state  is still capable of eating or moving or when it does  not lose its legs its popular name is a Nymph As  in the preceding chapter so in this we shall not  regard these terms as they only create a great  amount of confusion but shall adopt the true  term pupa throughout whether the insect spoken  of falls within the one or other of these popular  divisions or not  We traced the larva in the last chapter up to  that period in its history when it enters its cell  or otherwise retires to concealment previous to  its becoming transformed into the pupa Here  immured in darkness and alone it is left to undergo that mysterious struggle of the vital powers  which is to end in producing a new and more  perfect creature out of one which however perfectly adapted to its condition is very far inferior  as regards the completion of its organization to  that which it is destined to become and here we  may appropriately pause to take up the history  of the curious larva so recently described at p 207  as performing the feat of hanging itself up by the  tail from cords spun by its mouth since it exhibits  to us in a striking point of view the shaking off of  the old form of larva and the putting on of the  new one of pupa In addition to this it is per¬  haps one of the most astonishing instances of  animal agility with which we are acquainted  In order to make its manoeuvres and the difficulty of them the more easily comprehended let  us to follow Messrs Kirby and Spence in the  same matter put a case of a somewhat similar  kind before the readers by way of supposition  Country fellows at wakes and fairs frequently  for the diversion of the company there assembled  or for a prize of some value in their estimation  perhaps a fat pig or a leg of muttonrun races  in sacks which are tied close about their necks  and of course tumble about a good deal and dis¬  play anything but a graceful mode of progression   Now say these authors take one of the  most active and adroit of these bind him band  and foot suspend him by the bottom of his sack  with his head downwards to the branch of a lofty  tree make an opening in one side of the sack  and set him to extricate himself from it to detach  it from its hold and suspend himself by his feet  in its place Though endowed with the suppleness  of an Indian juggler and promised his sack full of  gold for a reward you would set him an absolute  impossibility yet this is what our caterpillars instructed by a Beneficent Creator easily perform  Let us proceed to show in what manner the  caterpillar performs this wondrous feat After  suspending itself in the way already described  a little time generally elapses during which the  insect by turns contracts itself and then dilates  again At length its skin splits near its head and  a portion of the pupa appears which acts like a  wedge and being thrust partly through the slit  causes it to tear still higher and higher towards  the tail The insect continues its painful labours  swelling and contracting alternately so as to push  the torn skin higher and higher up as one would  roll off a stocking until at length the old skin is  folded into several rolls and is quite at the tail  But the task is as yet only half accomplished the  most arduous and difficult part remains to be done  The pupa is shorter than the larva and consequently hangs out of reach of the silken button  in which the latter was firmly fixed by its hind  legs It seems now as if the poor insect must fall  for there appears no way for it to get up to the  silk anchorage and the folds of the pushedup  old skin are all that retain it in its position which  as may be imagined is far from a secure kind of  fastening How is it to disengage itself from its  ease and be suspended in the air while it climbs up  to take its place Without arms or legs to support  itself the anxious spectator expects to see it fall  to the earth His fears however are groundless  the supple segments of the pupas abdomen serve  in the place of arms Between two of these as  with a pair of pincers it seizes on a portion of  the skin and bending its body once more entirely  extricates its tail from it It is now wholly out  of the skin against one side of which it is sup¬  ported but yet at some distance from the leaf  the next step it must take is to climb up to the  required height For this purpose it repeats the  same ingenious manoeuvre making its cast skin  serve as a sort of ladder it successively with its  different segments seizes a higher and a higher  portion until in the end it reaches the summit  where with its tail it feels for the silken threads  that are to support it The tail is provided  with a number of minute hooks which catch in  the meshes of the silken button and the pupa  thrusting it into the meshes of this button feels  quite secure as to the result and drops safely into  the perpendicular position dangling in the air as  gaily as did the larva before it But its old skin  This Cut shows the entire change from the first rupture of the skin to the casting  away of the old skin  still clings to it and seems greatly to annoy it by its  presence remembered that the legs of this skin are still  firmly attached to the silk in consequence of their  hooklike form it will be evident that this also is  a task of some arduousness In order to get rid  of it it jerks itself about in various directions  and spins round very rapidlydoubtless the reader  has often seen the insect in this act and has wondered what was its object in whirling round after  this mannerby this means at length the castskin  appears loosed from its hold and drops off The  whole proceeding from first to last is represented  in our ensravino The little hooks of the tail of  the pupa are represented in the adjoining  cut much enlarged  Well does Reaumur exclaim These manoeuvres of withdrawing its tail from the old  skin of climbing up the old skin and of hooking  its tail in the silken buttonand as we might  add of whirling itself and in other ways agitating  itself to get rid of its old skin are manoeuvres  so delicate and perilous that we cannot help won¬dering how an insect which only executes them  once in its life should execute them so well and  we are led to the inevitable conclusion that it  has been thus taught by a Great and Allwise  Master  The manner in which other larva cast their  skins and become pupa when they enter their cell  cannot be described as they perform this act in  all the privacy and darkness of their solitary  habitations but in all probability it differs in no  respect from the manner in which the same creatures cast their skins when they moult excepting  that the new being which emerges from the cast  skin is no longer a larva but a pupa  The time occupied by the creature in its process  of change differs in different species In some it  is short in others it is long Generally it does  not exceed a few days We are told however of  the larva of some insects which are six months  before they become pupa The Baron de Geer  tells us with surprise of the larva of a moth  which he had watched It became a larva and  spun its cocoon in the month of August 1746  and was attentively kept during the winter The  spring came but the larva still remained a larva  and did not show any signs of changing its form  and winter came again finding it still a larva the  second winter passed and it was not until April  1748 that is more than eighteen months after  it first became a larva and entered its cocoon that  it underwent the change and became a pupa some  time afterwards it became a perfect insect  CHAPTER II  WHAT IS A PUPA  But it may now be asked What is a pupa and  what are the differences between it and a larva  and between it and the perfect insect It is very  necessary that this should be clearly understood  and to that end we shall endeavour to render our  explanation as simple as possible But it will be  far better than the best description if the reader  will be persuaded to watch these changes through¬  out himself The butterfly tribe furnish the very  best illustrations in the world and by merely  collecting a few caterpillars from the wayside or  from the kitchengarden a source of amusement  will be opened which will a thousandfold repay  the trouble and time consumed in the occupation  Of all other ways personal observation when it  is so readily to be effected as in the case of these  insects is the best and most impressive method of  becoming acquainted with the Life of an Insect  Such knowledge is far more entertaining than  bookknowledge and is much more agreeable to  acquire and more easy to retain  We must guard our definition of what a pupa  is by reminding the reader that some insects with  which he is very familiar do not pass through this  change in the same manner that the majority of  insects do that is in a state of torpor or sleep  If he were to rear up a spider from the egg and  were to watch for the time when it would become  a still lifelesslooking object like that which we  have called a pupa he would assuredly be disappointed and he might accuse this little work of  leading him into error because it declares that all  insects must pass through the pupa state before  they become perfect in their form and number of  their parts Yet that very spider has passed  through both the larva and the pupa state under  the observers eye without his being able to recognise the fact simply because in both these states  it is very like the perfect insect and can walk  about and eat just as usual In fact it is more  than probable that spiders of the same kind in  these different conditions could scarcely be recogmsec so as to say that they were pupae or perfect  insects even by tolerable entomologists and it is  very likely that mistakes of this kind have often  occurred We learn therefore from this statement that some pupae are active and move about  just as they did before although they are in the  pupa state  In a great number of cases then a pupa is a  state in an insects life when it rests from active  exertion and from taking food and when under¬  neath the dry and withered skin a series of great  changes are taking place which are preparing it for  its future life in the perfect state Thus it differs  from the larva state in not eating and moving and  in the important particularthat it is receiving  new parts and organs which are added to it under  the skin It also differs from the perfect insect in  the same respects as in the first place from the  larva and also in the important circumstance that  the perfect insect the moment it enters that state  has no more organs added to itit is in fact  perfect while the pupa is imperfect Let us place  these differences in a tabular form  The Larva  The Pupa  The Perfect Insect  Moves about and eats  Does not move about  Moves about and eats  Has no new organs  nor eat  Has no new organs  added to it beyond  Has several new organs  added to it beyond  those acquired in the  added to it to prepare  those obtained in the  egg  it for the perfect state  pupa state  Let ns repeat our caution that this definition is  only applicable to inactive pupae In the active  pupae the same development of new organs takes  place but it does not interfere with the usual  actions of life We must also add that some of  the pupae which we must call inactive never¬  the less are not wholly without motion but are  capable of manifesting that life is in them death¬  like though they appear by slightly moving the  lower part of the body All inactive pupae how¬  ever are without the power of moving about  At the risk of being thought tedious it has  been indispensably necessary to be thus precise  upon this point a little careful study of these two  or three pages will fix the distinctive characters of  the pupa firmly in the readers memory and will  enable him to find the account given of its history  clear easy and interesting  Having thus defined what the pupa state is let  us take up one of these withered objects and by  a little gentle treatment with the assistance of a  delicate scissors a sharp pointed penknife of very  keen edge and two or three pins we shall succeed  in unrolling the insect mummy In order to obtain  the best sight of what the pupa case contains it  will be advisable to select as large a pupa as can  be procured Those of the butterfly tribe are  well suited for this purpose If we are pretty  fortunate in our dissections we shall succeed in  discovering that within the membranelike skin  there is exhibited a beautiful spectacle of order  and neatness The legs and wings and other  external appendages are folded down close to the  body of the insect The feet are often crossed  smoothly over the breast and the wings are  flattened against the side of the body the antennas  are also neatly arranged parallel with the legs  and altogether the insect presents a very singular  appearance from the fact of all its organs being  thus smoothed down compressed into the smallest  as in the specimen figured  The appearance of the  folded limbs is indistinctly exhibited in the  companion pupa All the  parts of the perfect insect  can be distinctly traced  if the pupa is sufficiently  matured  Pupce  By gently using a fine needle the wings antennae and legs can be separated from the side of  the body and made to exhibit somewhat of their  natural appearance but as yet every part is  widely different from the corresponding parts in  the perfect being The legs are shapeless the antennas are imperfect and the wingsthose glorious  organs of the complete conditionare as yet  devoid of their splendid tints being of a greyish  colour and exhibiting little resemblance to the elegant form afterwards to distinguish them  Strange to say every organ in this pupa is  enclosed in a sheath of membrane The head of  the insect is covered by a case the delicate  antennae however long or fine have their cases or  sheaths even the eyes are provided with them  They exist also upon the trunk wings and legs  and tongue or proboscis These cases must not  be mistaken for the general outer case which  covers the whole insect they are separate from  that and cover the organs in question closely  after the manner of a glove  If we were to open a pupa within a few hours  after it had assumed this state we should find its interior filled with a milky fluid in the midst of which  its future limbs and organs are seen very distinctly  but are as yet in a most fragile or even half fluid  state At a little later period this fluid disappears  and hardens into a sort of glue which partly fastens  down the tender limbs into their proper position  until the appointed time comes for the insect to  burst from its sleep and live and from which the  case which covers them is formed From the ac¬  count thus given of the contents of the pupacase  it will be apparent that the pupa possesses when  perfect all the organs of the complete insect head  eyes antennas wings legs c and is in fact only  different from it in that it is still inactive to a great  extent and still a prisoner within its cell of membrane In a little while the bonds which keep it  in the tomb will be broken and the slumberer shall  rise a glorious creature to the enjoyment of all the  happiness of a new condition of existence  Perhaps few things would cause a person ignorant of insect life more amazement than if we  were to hold before his eyes some of the varieties  of pupoB in one hand and the perfect insect in the  other and were then seriously to assure him  that both were the same  creatures in reality Can  it be possible he might  exclaim i This dry brown  little mass with these singular knobs and this elegant  and delicate figurethese the  same being Nor when we  look at the various figures of  pup® should we be much  surprised at his exclamation  in one of the cases at the British Museum is a  very large pupa which we have had engraved  and which is here presented to the reader In  this curious creature the folding up of the limbs  insect with its gaudy wings  is very obvious and some idea of its strange  aspect may be formed from the representation of  it here given The pupae of several moths are  very singular in shape In some there is a sort  of little hook which sticks out from the head  and seems as if it were intended to hang up the  creature by In others there is a kind of nose  attached to the head giving it a droll appearance  The cause of these protuberances is the long  tongue of these moths which as it is much longer  than their bodies could not of course be contained  in the pupa case unless it was folded up it is  therefore neatly folded up and packed into these  receptacles where it is stowed away until by the  insect awakening to active life this singular instrument becomes necessary to them when it is with¬  drawn The older naturalists who loved to find  out mimicries of all kinds in nature used to be  fond of painting pupae with human faces on  account of the frequent resemblance to a Roman  nose which is found among them Goedart a  celebrated naturalist has drawn several which we  are sure will excite the merriment of our readers  and we have therefore shown these remarkable  creatures as represented by him in the adjoining cut  One is a respectablelooking old gentlemans face  with his hair brushed up very primly off his fore¬  head Another resembles a mermaid for it has  the head of a lady and something like a cap but its  tail is more like that of a fish The others are  quite caricatures It is the introduction of a  dot to represent the eye which gives the resemblance to the face in these figures without it they  are by no means strikingly like the face Madame  Merian has favoured us also with some very curious  drawings of pupae of the insects of Surinam which  appear more natural than those of the last author  and present a very fantastic aspect by reason of  the curious projections which stick out from their  heads A few of these are represented below  Curious Pupa From Madame Merians work on the Insects of Surinam  As in the case of the larva so with the pupa if  it is found in a dark situation it will probably be  destitute of colour or at any rate it will only be  of a yellowish white such pupae when taken out  of their natural hidingplace and exposed to the  sunlight become of a dark colour Indeed the  majority of pupae are without any of the gay  colouring which distinguishes the previous condition of the insect It seems as if it had been  thought unnecessary to deck in gorgeous raiment  the cerements of what we might call the tomb  of the insect But there are some beautiful exceptions to this rule The pupae of most butterflies  which are suspended in open day are of a green  or yellowish brown colour Some however are  painted in fairer colours and a still greater number  are speckled with glittering spots of golden hue  and shine as though gilded with the purest leaves  of that precious metal and burnished Hence as  before explained the Latin and Greek terms of  aurelia and chrysalis for the pupae of these insects  The gilding makes them very attractive objects  being applied now in streaks now in spots and  occasionallyand this in the very common pupa  of the butterfly whose caterpillar or larva feeds on  the nettlethey are entirely covered with this  splendid coat The shade of gilding ranges in the  depth of its tone from a very pale yellow to the  full lustre of virgin gold No wonder that those  who mistook the object of chemistry in trying to  turn all things into gold were attracted by these  glittering things and actually believed these spots  to be of real gold and hence imagined that they  had found out an argument in nature for the trans¬  mutation of common metals into that coveted one  But a little experiment which it is in the power  of any one to perform would soon have undeceived  them and taught them the truth of the proverb  All is not gold that glitters By infusing a portion  of saffron in hot water and straining it off after a  little time and adding to the rich yellow liquor  thus obtained a few lumps of pure gum Arabic  a sort of gilding varnish will be obtained which  if applied to a bright shilling will give it very  much of a golden appearance owing to the shining  of the metal showing through a transparent film  of a golden colour The gilded look of the pupa  was found by Reaumur to be produced in the  same way by the shining white membrane of the  inner skin showing through the outer skin which  is of a transparent yellow  In the Transactions of the Linmean Society for  1833 the Rev L Guilding describes a very  curious pupa the case of which resembles pearl  These little bodies are found in abundance in  the island of Antigua and are often sent home  to Europe under the name of groundpearl  as distinguished from the ordinary fisherypearl  They are devoured by turkeys and fowls until  the birds are nearly choked with them when  the remedy is to pour vinegar down the throat  Ground Pearl The Insect and its Case magnified  which dissolves the pearls and sets the poor bird  at ease They are strung into necklaces and  purses by the ladies of the Bahamas They long  caused much perplexity to naturalists but they  were ultimately found to be really only the pupae  of a little insect which appears to infest the ants  those voracious creatures and thus to keep down  their numbers A representation of the ground  pearl and the insect within is annexed  CHAPTER III  RESPIRATION OF THE PUPA  Having glanced at these particulars in the  history of the pupa we come to the important  question Does the pupa in this torpid con¬  dition still breathe as the larva did or not  On a careful examination we might detect with  the help of a magnifying glass the same breathing  holes or spiracles spoken of on page 161 as appertaining to the larva and were we sufficiently  skilful to dissect the pupa we should find much  the same arrangement of airtubes within the  body In the absence of all other means of ascertaining the fact we should be warranted in concluding from the presence of these organs alone  that the pupa has the faculty of breathing no less  than the larva M Reaumur has given a beautiful  description of the breathingholes or spiracles of  the pupa and has represented them in an engraving  of which a copy is furnished at page 161 lie  found that they are protected by little valve  like contrivances just as our mouths are protected  by our lips and these can be opened or closed at  pleasure by the creature so that if plunged into  water that fluid cannot enter the insects body for  all its little doorsand there are no fewer than  eighteen of themare fast shut Singular to say  however if plunged into oil the oil has the power  of entering them and the pupie may be thus  drowned  It is very easy to put the fact of the breathing  of the pupa inanimate as it appears to a certain  test By taking a wineglass half full of water  and putting it under an airpump and then exhausting the air we shall be able to extract the  air which exists dissolved in the water or some  water that has been boiled and allowed to cool  will do as well If we now put a pupa into this  water and again exhaust the air from the receiver  we shall notice at the second stroke of the piston  a number of little jets of air come from the insects  body at the places where the spiracles are situated  thus clearly proving that the creature breathes air  by this apparatus The fact may be tested also  in another wayand both this and the preceding  experiment are due to the ingenious Reaumur  He took the pupa of a butterfly and suspending  it by a thread immersed it half way down in oil  on taking it out after some time it was still alive  and apparently uninjured the reason being that  the entire number of its breathingholes were not  covered He took another of the same species  and plunged it entirely under the oil and taking  it out after a time it was found to be quite dead  in fact it had been suffocated by the air being shut  out from its breathing apparatus and that as  effectually as if it had been one of ourselves lying  at the bottom of the sea We may say therefore  with perfect accuracy that though the pupa this  seemingly unliving object neither moves nor  eats nor in any other way gives us a sign that it  is alive except in a few cases and that in its  advanced stages we can nevertheless prove it to  be living as it can be shown that it has the power  of breathing and if it breathes it lives  We may take the liberty of appropriately appending to this statement a most interesting and  delightfullytold anecdote from the pages of the  Baron de Geer of an insect whose larva lives in  the water blit whose pupa is an airbreathing  creature and consequently would perish if the  change from larva to pupa were to take place  under water without some especial contrivance  to furnish it in the pupa form with a supply of air  Yet how can this be when the insect is under  water the whole time up to its becoming a perfect  moth We shall hear   At the commencement of spring as soon as  the frost and ice had disappeared I sauntered out  one day to procure some fresh plants from the  bottom of a stream in order to feed some of my  caterpillars with them Between the leaves of  these aquatic plants I presently found a large  number of aquatic larvae which had there safely  passed through the rigorous season just gone by  I took a number of them and put them in some  boxes where they eat the leaves with which I fed  them There they grew larger from day to day  although by slow degrees I tended them until  June in the same year without perceiving any  other change in their appearance than that they  had grown to a considerable size But at the  commencement of this month I noticed that they  became very uneasy they forsook their leaves  and wandered about the sides of the boxes which  contained water Sometimes they would creep  out of the water and again would go into it They  seemed as if they were in search of something  which they had lost It was now evident that  their object was to find some convenient place in  which to undergo their transformation into pupae  but they did not like the boxes in which they  were confined and several even died I began to  despair of seeing their metamorphosis which gave  me much regret as I had a great desire to become  acquainted with their whole history In order  to satisfy myself I went on the 26 th of June  to the spot from whence I had taken them in  order to discover perchance some larvas about to  become pupae and to ascertain the places they  selected in which to undergo their change I had  the gratification of being completely successful  and of discovering not only the larvae but even  several of them which had shut themselves up in  silken cocoons and had not yet undergone their  transformation  cf The month of June appears therefore to be  the period when these larvre prepare for their  change of form They do not leave the water to  accomplish it the change taking place under  water They attach themselves to the leaves of  some of the younger aquatic plants which are at  a suitable depth from the surface of the water  By means of several silken cords the insect fastens  together two and sometimes even three leaves  between which it spins an oval cocoon composed  of very white silk This cocoon is of a double  structure the true inner cocoon which is very  white is placed within an outer envelope of silk  of a greyish or brownish colour The envelope  extends considerably beyond the sides of the true  The Cut represents two leaves between which the Worm lies the Cocoon itself and the Larva  cocoon which lies loosely in it and towards one  end there is a wide opening in it the inner cocoon  being perfectly closed in on every side The cut  on the next page represents the perfect insect and  the pupa thus carefully provided for  In this inner cocoon there is not so much as a  single drop of water The pupa could not exist  in it if it were not  full of air and the  difficulty is how to  fill a little cell with  air which is already  buried many inches  under and on every  Pupa and perfect Insect  side surrounded by water De Geer states that he  did not find a particle of water in all the cocoons  which he opened In order to ascertain whether or  not it was really necessary for the pupa to be thus  carefully housed in a silken ball full of air beneath  the water he took out several pupae and put them  into some water in a saucer At first they swam  but presently they sank to the bottom They  lived for several days but ultimately every one  died showing plainly that the aircell was absolutely necessary to their existence  Yet although these pupae were airbreathing  creatures strange to say De Geer found that if  taken from their little cells out of the water they  shrivelled up and died He put several in a dry  box and invariably found that in a short time they  were dead He imagined with great probability  that the cause of their death was the evaporation  of their fluids which of course does not take place  when they are enshrouded in their cocoons and  surrounded on all sides with water He made  one more experiment with them which was as  follows He took several out of their cocoons and  placed them in water in such a manner that one  of their sides was in the air while the other was in  the water he kept them for a considerable time  in this position and he had the pleasure at its  expiration of seeing them become perfect insects  just as if they had never left their cocoons The  necessity of both air and water to their wellbeing  was thus clearly proved  How can we sufficiently admire the ingenuity  and skill displayed by this insect in the execution  of its difficult task When a human engineer  wishes to build under the water he must have  recourse to the most cumbrous and powerful  mechanism to enable him to effect his object  Piles must be driven into the bed of the river so  closely as scarcely to allow any water to come  through a steamengine must be fixed close by  to pump out all the water from the space thus  enclosed and a number of men must labour hard  to stop up the chinks where the water comes  pouring in Thus men and machines of great  power and in sufficient number are requisite to  enable the most expert engineer to form a cavity  at the bottom of the rivers bed What if we were  to give him as a problem to build a cell which  should be perfectly watertight and filled with air  without allowing him to employ any of these  means and to insist that it should all be done with¬  out his coming up to the surface of the water at all  for anything He would probably tell us it was  impossible Not so the insect it though on all  sides surrounded with water actually spins a web  in the waves and fastens it by cables of sufficient  strength to adjoining plants and afterwards forms  a watertight cell in which it shuts itself safely up  secure against the invasion of enemies or the intrusion of a drop from the element in which its  cell floats and is moored  All pupae of aquatic habits do not however  possess this remarkable faculty of surrounding  themselves with air even in the midst of the water  and these would certainly perish unless means  existed for them also to inhale the vital air These  means are found in the endowment of them with  the power of swimming Surely our readers must  often have seen the wriggling movements of certain little blackish objects which are to be found  in every stagnant puddle in the summer Many  of these are the pupae of various species of gnats  and when we watch them come darting upwards  by a succession of flaps with their tail until they  reach the surface where they remain for a short  time we see the means by which although they  live immersed in water they are enabled to breathe  the air For if we scrutinized them a little narrowly we might detect on each side of their  largest extremity or head a pair of minute tubes  which open into the air at the surface of the water  It may sink beneath the water for a time without  inconvenience and it is soon found plunging  upwards anxiously seeking to thrust its tubes into  the air In the larva state the gnat breathes by  its tail in the pupa state by its head l The pupae  of some aquatic insects breathe like the larvae  of the same insects by organs like gills That of  the ephemera shown on the last page is an  instance  The curious apparatus of a telescopelike air  tube of the rattailed insects described in a former  page will not be forgotten by the reader It may  interest him to learn that there is another little  creature which in the pupa state is furnished with  a somewhat similar apparatus These pupae have  not the same power of swimming with the last  and therefore require a special provision to meet  the necessities of their case They are plunged  some way down in the water and air is conveyed  to them by a hollow taillike tube which is always  found to open on the surface of the water It is  a curious thing to contemplate these little creatures so beautifully provided for in this manner  Secure of all they need in the supplies of air furnished to them by their tube they rest peacefully  in the waters unmoved by any of the accidents  which occur to surrounding creatures and patiently awaiting the hour which is to behold them  rise from their watery bier never more to return  Let us so likewise rest in assurance of our Heavenly Fathers love and care for us knowing that  every want will be supplied to his children by  Him who lias said I will never leave thee nor  forsake thee  CHAPTER IV  VARIETIES AND AGE OF THE PUPA  Although we are anxious not to attach too  much importance to mere names in this little  work and rather to keep the readers attention  fixed upon the really essential truths of the Life of  an Insect it is expedient that we should mention  that while all pupaa may be divided into the two  classes active and inactive yet there are several  very striking variations in them which are more  remarkable than those of larvae These it is  proper here to mention in order that the reader  may be spared the perplexity which would other¬  wise ensue were he to imagine that all inactive  or all active pupae were pretty much alike Let  it never however be forgotten that it is no matter  what the variation in form may be nor does it  matter whether the insect is active or inactive  while in this state of passage from the larva to  the perfect form it is always neither more nor  less than a pupa Through this stage all perfect in ¬  sects pass although they may put on various forms  and aspects while they are in it and may possess  various and perhaps very opposite faculties  during its continuance If this important fact is  borne in mind there will be no risk of being mis¬  led by the confusion of sounds and names which  some have been pleased to encumber insect history  with  In order to form a clear conception of these  variations reference may be made to the en¬  graving on the next page in which we have caused  to be represented the five different kinds of pupae  as they were named and classified by Linnaeus  This plate will sufficiently manifest the necessity  of an explanation upon the subject of the variations of pupae for few persons in examining it  would form the remotest idea that all the insects  there represented are really and truly in the pupa  state Some look so like the perfect insect that  it would be almost impossible for any one only  slightly acquainted with insect history to believe  them to be in what is in reality a transition stage  from the larva to the perfect form  I The insect No 1 is a pupa called the Complete because it is active and has many of the parts  of the perfect insect The pupa of the spider is  an instance  II The insect No 2 is a pupa called the  Halfcomplete or  semi complete  It is also active  resembles the  perfect insect  but has only the  rudiments of  wings The  grasshopper is  an instance of  this kind of pupa  III The insect No 3 is a pupa called the  Incomplete It is inactive but possesses rudiments  of legs and wings The common wasp is represented as an example of this kind  IV The insect No 4 is a pupa called the  Obtected This pupa has its upper portion en¬  cased in the peculiar manner represented the  chest and lower portion being distinct The but¬  terfly pupa belongs to this division  V The insect No 5 is a pupa called the  Coarctate In this case the pupa is enclosed within  its larva skin which forms a globular or oval case  the pupa lying loosely in it as if it had shrunk to  a smaller size The pupa of the blowfly is an  example  Such are the five variations of pupae as they  Avere recognised by Linnaeus the Complete  Halfcomplete Incomplete Obtected and Coarctate  They are sufficiently minute for ordinary purposes  and it will possibly save the reader some confusion  of ideas to endeavour to fix them in the memory  so that when looking at an insect whose pupa state  may not be so very characteristic as that of the  blowfly or butterfly he may still be able to say  with confidence that although it is unlike these it  is nevertheless a pupa On all subjects nothing  is of so much importance as clearness of ideas  It is better to know only a feAV things and to  understand them clearly than to have a confused  and indistinct knowledge of a great number It  lias been therefore simply and entirely with a  view to obviate this state of things in the mind  that these definitions of the different kinds of  pupa which may have appeared not altogether  interesting have been given  Having fulfilled this duty we may now proceed  to the more agreeable task of ascertaining some  interesting facts relative to the insects life and  age in the pupa state We have already seen that  the insect in the larva state often arrives at a  very respectable old age indeed in this state  insects live longer than either in the pupa or  perfect states But pupae also attain to a very  fair number of days sometimes living as long as  two years in that state Often however they are  not more than a few days in this condition and  the insect after a short repose springs forth a  new and active being But it has been found that  insects live a longer or shorter period in the pupa  state according as the temperature of the air is  cold or hot Thus for example when the larva  of a moth has become a pupa in the early part of  summer the pupa state will generally not last  beyond a fortnight But if on the other hand  the larva becomes a pupa late in the autumn the  pupa state will last until June in the next year  thus manifestly teaching us that according as the  weather is mild and genial the pupa state will be  shortened or according as it is cold and rigorous  it will be increased in duration The ingenious  Reaumur determined to put these singular facts  to an experimental test and as his results are in  the highest degree interesting and important we  shall proceed to submit an abstract of them to  the readers notice  In casting about for the means of exposing the  pupae he was about to experiment on to a warm  and equable temperature Reaumur determined to  conduct his first experiments in the Royal Conservatories which were always carefully heated  and in which as he with French naivete expresses  it e summer reigned in the depths of winter In  the month of January he carried thither a number  of boxes containing pupae of different species The  result was precisely what he had expectedin  the midst of a severe winter a number of butter¬  flies appeared in his boxes many of which would  not naturally have made their appearance until  the months of May August or even September  thus shortening the pupa state from four seven or  eight months to a fortnight or to five or to six  weeks in different instances Five or six days  seemed to be equal to a month of the natural  temperature The butterflies thus developed were  in no respect different from those which are  brought into activity at the natural period  They were as active and perfect as if their time  and place of birth had been the green fields  instead of amidst the strange vegetation of these  splendid Conservatories Several of the mother  insects deposited their eggs accomplishing the last  act of their existence as if summer had come and  died while the frosts and snow held all external  nature yet in bondage Not only therefore was  the duration of the pupa state in these insects  shortened but their whole life was thus abridged  by several months  In November of the same year Reaumur re¬  commenced his experiments and again exposed a  number of pupae to the genial influence of these  hothouses The result was the same In the  first week in December butterflies appeared which  would not in natural circumstances have been  developed earlier than the May of the next year  There were some pupae in particular whose development lie watched with great interest These  pupae belonged to a beautiful species of moth  which has two broods in a year that is it lays  eggs in May which become butterflies in July  and then again lays eggs which become pupae in  August or September but do not become butterflies until the following June He was curious  to see whether this second brood instead of  waiting for several months would like the first  disclose its butterflies in a considerably shorter  time now that it was exposed to the warmth of  the Conservatory Such actually proved to be the  case and thus two generations of these butter¬  flies were obtained in one year Alluding to the  depredations of caterpillars he quaintly remarks  cc This certainly is not a secret which appears very  profitable at present but who can tell whether  that which is useless to us today may not possibly become of value tomorrow Could we  discover some new species of larvae which would  supply us with as good a silk as that of the silk¬  worm and might be more easy to rear but which  only produced one generation in each year and if  it lived upon leaves which could be found all the  year through we might avail ourselves of this  means of increasing the number of its broods  This remark deserves much consideration  He was now anxious to try whether by apply¬  ing a more equable method of warming he could  succeed in hatching pupa as he had done in the  hothouse The idea occurred to him of endeavouring to hatch them under a lien He concluded  that the warmth of the mothers breast would quite  as easily hatch the insects as it does the eggs  But there was this obstacle in the way How  could he prevent the fragile and tender bodies of  the insect pupae from being crushed and killed by  the weight of the hens body and as we would  also suggest How could he ensure that the bird  would not actually have eaten up the objects of  his care Aware of the fact that when a hen is  in the humour to sit she will often allow smooth  stones to be placed among her own eggs he  anticipated no difficulty on that score and he  hit upon the following ingenious experiment  He procured some hollow glass balls which he had  caused to be made as nearly as possible similar in  size and shape to the eggs themselves Into these  by an opening at one end he introduced seven or  eight pupae and stopped the mouth up with a  cork but so as to allow a free communication with  the external air by paring off a piece from the  side of the cork  Thus prepared he put the glass egg together  with the others in the nest The hen was a little  more sensible than Reaumur had given her credit  for and though she did not thrust the egg out of  her nest she removed it to the outside where she  was so obliging as to permit it to remain and as  it was here just as warm as if it had been in the  centre of the eggs Reaumur did not attempt to  interfere with her arrangements A great deal of  moisture arose from the bodies of the pupae and  condensed like dew on the sides of the glass but  after a day or two this disappeared The reader  may now be anxious to learn the result of this  experiment It was equally successful indeed  it was more so than the preceding for in the  afternoon of the tenth day a pretty little butterfly  was seen within his glass egg being the first that  had appeared of the eight pupae and the first  ever hatched under the bosom of a hen The  remaining pupae all but two appeared soon after  these two died Perhaps the warmth of their  glassy cell was too violent for them for it was  found by the thermometer to be two or three  degrees above blood heat The whole six pupa  were born in less than six days while others of the  same species in a box in a windowseat were not  developed until twelve days later As the heat  thus obtained seemed too violent for pupa to be  artificially reared with success Reaumur suggests  that many variations might be made in the expe¬  riments which would have the effect of moderating  its amount These experiments decided in the  most satisfactory manner the quickening influence  of increased warmth upon the pupa of insects  Reaumur now became anxious to try the effects  of the opposite state of temperature and to  ascertain whether exposure to cold would exer¬  cise any effect upon the pupse It was reason¬  able to imagine that as warmth had hastened  forward their development cold would retard it  Reaumur determined to try what would be the  result of putting his pupa in their boxes in a  cellar and taking proper care to preserve them  from the damps of such a situation He put them  there about the end of January In ordinary  circumstances these pupse would have become  butterflies in the month of July in the same year  July came and we can conceive the curiosity with  which the ingenious experimenter went down as he  tells us to his cellars to see if any change had taken  place in the pupae July passed away August  also passed by yet the pupae still slumbered on in  their original form Reaumur left Paris in Sep¬  tember and did not return until the November  following He immediately went in quest of his  pupacharge and found them still unaltered  Were they dead Placing one in his hand it  soon began to exhibit such symptoms of motion  as plainly showed that it was alive Winter  closed over them still in the pupa form The  spring of the next year dawned upon them but  they were insensible to its influences £C And even  now cries Reaumur in the month of August just  two years from the time they left the larva form  and became pupae they are in perfect health in  excellent condition and would all become butter¬  flies very soon if I were only to expose them to  a warm summers influence   These extraordinary facts observe Messrs  Kirby and Spence lead us to a very singular  and unexpected conclusionthat we have the  power of lengthening or shortening the life of many  insects at pleasurethat we can cause one individual to live more than twice as Ion2 as another of  the same species and vice versa Had Paracelsus  made this discovery it would have led him to  pursue his researches after the elixir of immortality with redoubled confidence and would have  supplied him with an argument for the possibility  of prolonging the life of man beyond its usual  term which his sceptical opponents would have  found some difficulty in rebutting Even the  logical Reaumur seems inclined to infer from it  that this object of the alchemists was not so  chimerical as we are wont to conclude He con¬  fesses however that if it were to be attained only  by the same process as effects the extension of an  insects lifeby prolonging its state of torpor  and insensibilityfew would choose to enjoy it on  such conditions The man of pleasure might perhaps not object to a sleep of a hundred years in  the hope of finding something new under the sun  when he awakened and an ardent astronomer  would probably commit himself with scientific  joy to a repose as long and as sound as that of the  Seven Sleepers for the chance of viewing his  predicted return of a comet on stepping out of  his cave But ordinary mortals would consign  themselves to the perils of so long a night with  reluctance apprehending a fate no better than  that which befel the magician who ordered  himself to be cut in small pieces and put in  pickle with the expectation of becoming young  again  But this is in every respect erroneous as a deduction from these experiments on insects It must not  be forgotten that these experiments were made at  a time of the insects life when it is naturally  torpid and not upon the perfect insect Had  Beaumur attempted to prolong the life of a butterfly he would have failed completely that is if  he had adopted the same means so that all which  Ave can infer from these results is simply this that  we can only prolong or shorten the pupa state  Avhich is a state of torpidity a kind of halfway  between life and death The human frame knows  no such state after birth as can be properly compared to the inactive pupa state of insects and  consequently all reasoning founded on what may  take place in such a state under the particular  circumstances described is without foundation  Besides all this God has himself fixed a limit to  human life and we are expressly assured by his  word of truth that it is appointed unto man  once to die and though by reason of strength we  may reach far into a long life yet the hour comes  at last and the green earth closes over the only  mortal portion of a man Undoubtedly had  Reaumur prolonged his experiments he would  have found that death or the transformation of  the pupa would ultimately have taken place  As yet we are not aware that any practical  results on a large scale have followed from  Reaumurs interesting experiments It has been  already remarked that in countries where the silk¬  worm is reared it is the custom to hasten the  hatching of the eggs by women carrying little  packets of them about their person But this is  only to bring forward the development of the  larva state Perhaps the time anticipated by  Reaumur may arrive when insects may be hatched  under hens or in hatching machines so as to  obtain two instead of one brood of eggs and  larva in a season Reaumur suggests that the  great and wealthy who have good hothouses  might give all the appearance of summer to them  by introducing pupa in winter which would soon  be hatched and butterflies or other insects might  be seen flying about in December or January  from flower to flower But he forgot that gardeners generally are rather averse to the presence  of insects at all and particularly to the alldevouring larva of many species of butterflies which  would soon commit sad havoc among their choicest  plants We may recommend such experiments  to the reader as highly interesting and easy  of performance in a common sittingroom where  a fire is kept in winter with no other apparatus  than a tinbox or a glass jar of very moderate  size even a pillbox would answer every purpose  Some curious experiments on pupa of another  kind were also performed by Reaumur He varnished them over with various varnishes and  found that the pupa thus varnished were developed several weeks later than others of the  same species unvarnished He tried similar experiments upon eggs and found that the eggs of a  hen would keep fresh for a very long period if  they were entirely coated with some kind of  varnish This proved a most useful experiment  for it is now common all over the Continent to  preserve eggs by covering them either with oil or  butter  We may learn in reflecting upon the facts  brought to light by this ingenious entomologist  with what admirable care and skill the Great  Creator has arranged the period to be occupied  by the insect in the pupa state It has been  wisely ordained by these arrangements that the  insect shall not be developed until the season when  its proper food is to be found or when a proper  position for placing its eggs is to be discovered  The gay flutterer so tender in its frame must  not be born amid the snows of winter or in the  ungenial days of early spring its pupa therefore requires the warm influences of July and  August before it will undergo its change If it  were born earlier than that time it would unquestionably perish and the insect would become  extinct if later the same result would take  place for it would fall into the killing power of  the early winter evenings As it is all is well  The insect and the day are made for one another  for it the flower blossoms and the warm air  breathes and all nature is spread out in warmth  and happiness Its career run through it de¬  parts from the scene it has enlivened leaving  behind just at the proper time and in the proper  place the eggs which are to become quickened  live and die like itself all in their appointed  time We thus perceive that it is chiefly the  increasing temperature of the air which fixes the  time of the insects duration as a pupa and sets in  movement all the great chain of the events of external nature In what way an increase of warmth  thus acts we are still unable to say perhaps indeed  we may never be able to tell Neither can we un¬  derstand how it should be that the principle of life  should be ready at a moments notice to complete  its work in the perfection of the insect and yet  held in abeyance by a few degrees of a lower or  quickened into activity by a few degrees higher  temperature We know that this has been Gods  doing and marvellous it is in our eyes but  the wisest of men feels himself ignorant if asked  the question how it is thus arranged Truly  none but a God infinite in wisdom as well as  love would take such thought for so humble a  creature as a poor insect but let us not forget  that   each crawling insect holds a rank  Important in the plan of Him who framed  This scale of beingsholds a rank which lost  Would break the chain and leave behind a gap  Which Natures self would rue  The duration of the insect in the pupa state  though variable is without doubt limited and  sometimes it is fixed to an hour quite irrespective  of all external circumstances The most remarkable example of this kind occurs in the case of the  insects whose larva we have already mentioned  the Ephemera These insects appear with the  greatest regularity issuing from the waters of  the Seine or Marne in France between the  10th and 15th of August The fishermen call  them manna and when their season is come they  say the manna begins to appear or the manna  fell abundantly last night alluding by this expression either to the astonishing quantity of food  which the insects afford to the fish or to the large  quantity of fish which they then take The  fishermen expect them with the greatest confidence  during these few days nor are they ever dis  appointed Millions upon millions suddenly rise  into the air between eight and ten oclock in the  evening and this generally for three successive  nights Whatever be the temperature of the  atmosphere whether it be cold or hot these flies  invariably appear at the same hour in the evening  that is between a quarter and halfpast eight  towards nine they begin to fill the air in the  following half hour they are in the greatest numbers and at ten there are scarcely any to be seen  So that in less than two hoursand these always  the samethis infinite host of insects leave their  pupa state become perfect insects perform their  appointed work and vanish The same phenomenon of regularity of limit to the pupa state occurs  also in other insects though perhaps less strikingly Some insects constantly leave the pupa at  break of day others in the full tide of noon¬  day and others when the shadows of declining  day come over the landscape These however  are certainly exceptions to the general rule  which appears to lay down no precise period  of the day or month when this state is ended  and the perfect state is entered upon but a  limit nevertheless exists mainly dependent for  its appointment upon the external influences of  warmth and air  This limit attained we are brought to the next  point in the history of the insect pupa The beautiful organization of the perfect insect has been  going on under the dry and repulsive exterior Its  delicate limbs exquisitely wrought wings and the  other most wonderful organs with which the  perfect insect is furnished are now completed  Nothing remains but to cast off the slouch of its  pupa case and it will then be set free to range  whither it will in the great atmosphere into which  it will emerge If the reader has been watching  these insect changes with the natural object before  him he will immediately confirm our statement  when we mention that it is often possible to tell  when the pupa case is about to disclose its occupant The general form of the limbs is often  very clearly to be seen and the movements of the  included insect become much more sensible and  conspicuous If the beautiful gilded pupa called  as we have before said Chrysalides or Aurelia have  been thus nursed with a view to observe their  change it will be noticed that they lose entirely  that golden lustre which made them at first such  attractive objects These signs infallibly fore¬  token the approaching transformation  CHAPTER V  THE GREAT CHANGE  We must now spend a short time in narrating  the particular circumstances which attend this  interesting eventthe extrication of the insect  from its pupa case We shall in the first place  speak of such pupee as are not aquatic and after¬  wards of the singular ones which are so In the  case of the butterfly which as we have recommended repeatedly its being nursed and bred it  will be expedient to mention first the extrication  of the insect is comparatively with some others  a very simple operation The insect within is  seen to struggle for a time twisting its body in  various ways until at length a longitudinal slit  appears down the middle of its thorax The slit  extends gradually along the head and down the  parts which compose the breast until the insect  emerges from the outer case The inner membranes are now to be removed and this after a  little time is fairly accomplished and the butterfly  emerges and leaving the pupa skin behind it  byandby plunges for the first time upon the  soft waves of the summer air This is one of the  simplest of these methods of extrication  A very natural difficulty will arise in the mind  as to what possible means of escape can be  granted to such insects as live in the pupa state  in the interior of old trunks of trees or even in  little caves of the earth These cases have all  been satisfactorily provided for puzzling as they  may seem Take for instance the pupa of the  great goatmoth the Cossus ligniperda of which  ive a representation  This creature lies  id in a deep excavation formerly made by  itself when in the larva form inside the trunk of a  willow How is it to get back to the hole at  which it entered Without legs without any  other apparatus by which it might drag itself for¬  ward one would say it is in a hopeless case it  must lie there and perish for there appears no  way of extricating it from its den But not so  Helpless as it appears it will certainly make its  way out ancl taste the sweets of liberty and be  wafted along the fields of air But how Let  us suppose a man in such a condition let his  feet be bandaged together so that they cannot  move let a straitjacket be put upon his body  and secure his arms and hands after this let a  leathern bag be put over his head and tied down  round his middle then put him in a cellar and  bid him work his way out and up the stairs until  he reached the front door where he must undo  his bandages and slip himself out of his strait  jacket and hood after which he may go wherever  lie likes What a feeling of despair would fill the  poor prisoners mind promised his release on condition that he should accomplish it in that way  To him it would be a task altogether impossible  even though his life were offered as the reward of  his success It is not less a question of life and  death to the insect than it might be to him yet its  extrication is accomplished not only in a very  simple but in a very easy manner  If the reader will carefully examine the representation of the insect given in the last page he  will notice that the pupa case is provided with  certain sharp points which are all directed towards  the tail of the insect these sharp points are called  by entomologists adminicula They are of infinite  consequence to the insect Who has not himself  performed or been the subject of the trick of  causing a grain of barley to creep up the sleeve  The manner in which it is gradually pushed up is  strikingly similar to that in which the pupa of the  cossus is forced upwards and out of its wooden  gallery It will be readily supposed that in con¬  sequence of the peculiar direction assumed by the  toothlike processes in question it will be very  difficult to push the pupa backwards as the points  would catch in any obstacle and arrest its progress  in that direction but they offer no resistance to  its moving in a forward direction The manner  in which the insect proceeds then is as follows  Being capable of slightly shortening and lengthen¬  ing the lower part of its body which is the part  thus provided with hooks it begins to push back¬  wards but the hooks catch in the sides of the wood  and thus prevent it from moving back and it is  consequently actually driven forwards and so it  continues to thrust itself gradually forwards in this  simple manner just as a boy with his hands tied  might thrust himself forwards as he lay on the  ground by pushing against any object with his  feet In this way the patient creature moves we  may be sure by very slow degrees but that matters  little it moves until it has at length reached the  opening of its gallery outside the tree where it  may often be seen sticking out half way Here  by a remarkable instinct it ceases to move forwards for it would otherwise tumble down and  probably destroy itself At length after violent  struggles its swathing bands are all either torn  asunder or slidden off and the insect wings its  way in unrestrained freedom far from the scene of  its triumphs of patience and hope The pupa of  the father longlegs makes its way up from the  subterranean chamber in which it has so long been  sheltered fed and protected and reaches at length  the surface of the ground where it becomes the  perfect insect  But other pupas although not perhaps quite so  arduously placed as in the last instance nevertheless present us with an extremely difficult puzzle  as to how the included insect is to be extricated  from its swathing bands The common fleshfly  or blowfly for instance in the pupa state is shut  up in a membranous case out of which there seems  no escape but there is a way and the manner in  which the insect gets out of its prison is a remark¬  ably curious one well repaying the trouble of a  little close observation At the larger end under  which the head of the fly lies and from which it  always issues there is commonly a sort of lid which  can be pushed off like the lid of a box and the insect  can then walk out at pleasure But in the case of  the pupa of the blowfly this lid is not very easily  removed and the fly therefore is furnished with  a most ingenious method of thrusting it off On  opening the larger end of such a pupa if the fly  within is ready to come out a most curious phenomenon will be seen The insect moves towards  the lid and there begins to blow out its head in  the most extraordinary manner swelling it to  twice its natural size a moment after it will  resume its natural size  then again it will puff it  out making its two eyes  to start asunder and its  head to assume several dif   Mn f Hea ftheFly ferent ghapeg in succeg  sion Two representations are annexed of the  striking figure of the insects head when it thus  causes it to swell out After repeating this action  several times the fly emerges from the pupa  The cause of this remarkable dilatation is the fill¬  ing of a membrane situated at the middle part of  the head with air by which it is blown out into a  sort of bladder as large as the head itself This  acts as a kind of lever and eventually pushes up  the lid of the pupa case allowing the insect to  make its exit unmolested This part generally  disappears afterwards and the head  becomes alike firm and unyielding in  all its parts but it may in at least  its rudiments be seen even in the  head of the adult fly by slightly  pressing its head between the fingers  when it appears as at x in the cut  Head of a Fly magnified It shows oppo¬  site the letter x the  remains of the membranous bag  More singular still are the circumstances which  mark the exit of the insect from the pupa case in  other instances and yet more strikingly than those  narrated do they exhibit to us the amazing exercise  of the Divine attributes of wisdom and forethought  in the case of these humble beings The larva of  a species of moth which dwells in a wooden cell  scooped out of the poplar tree to which there is  no cloor by which it can escape readily gnaws  away the wood until it leaves only an extremely  delicate layer between it and the outside of the  tree which is as thin as writing paper This done  it enters into the pupa state Its time in that  condition being accomplished it moves itself by  the same contrivance as the cossus and actually  pushes through the thin layer and appears on the  outside of the tree thus making its escape from  prison by pushing down a part of its prison  wall  An instance described by the naturalist Bonnet  is yet more ingenious in the arrangements by  which the insect escapes While in the larva form  it takes up its abode inside the leaf of an ash  curiously rolled up into a cone and then after a  time it becomes a pupa forming a silken cocoon of  a very slight texture and therefore easily ruptured by the insect which it suspends like a ham¬  mock in the midst of its habitation It is the  closely joined sides of its leafy dwelling that form  a barrier which were it not for the precaution of  the larva would be impenetrable to so small and  weak an animal But like the lastmentioned  this larva seems to be aware of the feebleness of  its next condition and gnaws in the leaf a round  opening taking care not to cut through the  exterior thin layer of tissue or epidermis This  door is to serve the insect for its exit in due time  But in proportion to its bulk its green chamber is  of considerable size How then shall the insect  know the exact place where its portal is situated  How without a clue shall it discover in its dark  abode the precise circle which requires only a  push to throw open its gate Even this is fore¬  seen and provided for Out of all other positions in which the little hammock of which we  spoke might have been hung and they are  numerous the larva has been directed so to place  it that the silken cord which suspends the head is  fastened close to the side of the door which it has  previously constructed and the insect when it  emerges from the pupa guided by this thread  like Theseus makes its way out of an apartment which but for this contrivance might have  been to it a labyrinth as inextricable as that  of Minos Other insects adopt the same precaution of gnawing a doorway for the escape of  the perfect insect only leaving a sufficient thickness of outside tissue to protect the helpless  pupa within from the invasion of enemies from  without  Upon the pear or willow tree may sometimes  be found an illustration of escape from the pupa  altogether well deserving our notice In such  situations the brown flaskshaped cocoon of the  emperor moth may occasionally be discovered In  structure it is composed of a solid tissue of layers  of silk almost of the texture of parchment but  at the narrow end or that which may be compared  to the neck of the flask it is composed of a series  of loosely attached longitudinal threads converging like so many bristles to a blunt point in the  middle of which is a circular opening through  which the moth makes its escape the threads  readily yielding to pressure from  within and acting somewhat on the  principle of the wires of the opening  to a rattrap or the willow cricks of  an eeltrap The silk of its cocoon  is of so strong a texture and so  closely gummed that had both ends  been similarly closed the egress of  the insect would have been impracticable But  it may be thought such a cocoon is exposed  to the attacks of a number of insect enemies who  might easily find entrance to it at the opening  thus left at one of its ends This source of peril  has been foreseen Within the exterior funnel  shaped end at some little distance down the  insect has constructed a second funnel com¬  posed of a similar circle of needlepointed threads  which proceeding from the sides of the cocoon  converge to a point and form a cone through  which not the smallest aperture is left From  the arched structure of this singular dome and  from the fact just mentioned that no visible opening  can be discerned in it from without it is rendered  quite impenetrable to the most violent attacks of  besiegers while it yields to the slightest pressure  from within and allows the insect to emerge  from its cocoon with the utmost facility When  it has passed through it the elastic threads resume  their former position and the empty cocoon presents just the same appearance that it did before  A celebrated naturalist Ebsel was sorely perplexed at this the first time he had the gratification of watching the insect escape He states that  he could scarcely help thinking that there was  something supernatura of these fine emperor moths in a box in which he  had put a cocoon of this kind but in which he  could not discover the slightest appearance of any  insect having escaped from it until he slit it longitudinally and then found it to be empty  Mr Rennie mentions an instance perhaps not  so ingenious but equally curious with this history  of the proceedings of the emperor moth in a little  insect also a moth which also dwells upon the  willow It spins an elastic shroud for its pupa of  the singular shape of a boat with the keel upper¬  most Its first step is to spin two walls of whitish  silk of the required form and when these are  completed it draws them forcibly together with  elastic threads so placed as to retain them closely  shut The passage of the moth out of this cocoon  might have struck Rdsel with still greater surprise  than he had felt at witnessing that of the emperor  moth for in that cocoon there was at least no  apparent difficulty to prevent the egress of the  insect as the opening existed in it at one end  whereas in this there is no opening at all The  insect escapes at the joining of the sides the  threads giving way in a particular spot and the  sides though originally requiring force to draw  them together into the requisite form become so  elastic as to close again when the moth has passed  between them and made its escape The cocoon  preserves precisely the same form after the insect  has quitted it as before and it is impossible by  the naked eye to detect the place of its exit  As a general rule insects make their escape from  the pupa case head foremost but there occurs a  very singular exception in the case of some of the  gall insects The males of these insects contrive  to make their escape out of the pupa case formed  of the dried skin tail foremost and as they thus  back out of their dwelling their wings are necessarily turned backwards over their heads but a  little exercise soon puts the ruffled insect in  proper plume again and the wings resume their  customary position  Some curiosity may be felt to know in what  way the silkworm moth escapes from the double  prison the pupa case and the cocoon in  which she is concealed How is the moth to  make its way through the dense mass of fibres  all glued together which walls her in on every  side Her delicate wings and body would never  endure anything like the severity of the struggle  necessary to enable her to force her way through  this to her solid and resisting mass Though  much attention has been paid to the transformations of this particular insect it is somewhat  curious that it is still a matter on which opinions  are divided as to how the insect succeeds in  making its egress Some suppose that the eyes  which are the only hard organs of the head are  the instruments by which the threads are divided  their numerous minute facets serving the purpose  of a file Others hold the belief that the insect  pours out a fluid which acts upon the gum and  silken fibres of one end of the cocoon and so  softens them that they easily give way to the  slightest pressure from within Perhaps the two  opinions observe Messrs Kirby and Spence may  be reconciled by supposing the silkworm first  to moisten and then to break the threads of the  cocoon In those that are of a slighter texture  a mere push against the moistened end is probably  sufficient and hence we find in so many newly  disclosed moths the hair in that part wet and  closely pressed down  It has been supposed in cases where the  cocoon is a hard almost wooden cell that the  feeble insect prisoner within is provided with  a peculiar chemical fluid of greater powers of  solution than are requisite in the last instance  The cocoon of the pussmoth in particular is  so hard and dense as to resist even the point  of a penknife and the insect it holds confined  within it is a weak creature totally unprovided  with any apparatus fit for penetrating walls so  hard and dense as these What is it to do   Here observe the writers last quoted the  eyes are clearly incompetent nor could any  ordinary fluid assist their operations for the gum  which unites the Avoody particles of the cocoon  is indissoluble in aqueous menstrua What an  aqueous solvent cannot effect an acid is competent  to and with a bag of such acid our moth is fur¬  nished The contents of this she pours out as  soon as she has forced her head through the skin  of the pupa and upon the opposite end of the  cocoon The acid instantly acts upon the gum  loosens the cohesion of the grains of wood and  a very gentle effort suffices to break down Avliat  Avas a minute ago a strong barrier How admirable and effectual a provision But there  is yet another marvel connected Avitli it Ask  a chemist of what materials a vessel ought to be  to contain so potent an acid he will replyOf  glass Yet our moth has no glass recipient her  bottle is a membranous bag but of so wonderful  a fabric as not to be acted upon by a menstruum  which a gum apparently of a resinous nature  is unable to resist This fact can only be ex¬  plained by the analogous insensibility of the  stomach to the gastric juice which can dissolve  bone and it is equally worthy of admiration In  both cases the vitality of the membranous or fleshy  receptacle secures it from the action of the in¬  cluded fluid but how who shall explain  The naturalist Huber the patient historian  of the ants gives us a very interesting account of  the proceedings of these wonderful insects in  actually assisting the young out of their silken  cases These pupae are enclosed in a tissue  of silk of so compact a texture and formed of  so strong a silk as to render it impossible for  the prisoner within to rupture the fibres and get  out of prison The worker ants therefore are  instructed by a heavenly Ruler and Guide to  give help to the prisoners and to secure their  egress But how do these indefatigable attend¬  ants ascertain precisely the moment when their  aid is required The insect within has no power  of voice to cry out for help nor those without  in all probability the faculty of hearing if it  could do so It seems probable that they are  acquainted with it from some slight movements  which take place within which they ascertain  by means of their antenna Whatever it be  the attendants never interfere at a wrong time  Their manner of proceeding is beautifully described  in the following words of this author u Several  males and females lay in their envelopes in one of  the largest cavities of my glazed anthill The  labourerants assembled together and appeared to  be in continual motion around them I noticed  three or four mounted upon one of these cocoons  endeavouring to open it with their teeth at that  extremity answering to the head of the pupa  They began to thin it by tearing away some  threads of silk where they wished to pierce it and  at length by dint of pinching and biting this tissue  so extremely difficult to break they formed in it a  vast number of apertures They afterwards at¬  tempted to enlarge these openings by tearing or  drawing away the silk but these efforts proving  ineffectual they passed one of their mandibles  into the cocoon through the apertures they had  formed and by cutting each a thread one after  the other with great patience at length effected a  passage of a line in diameter in the superior part  of the web They now uncovered the head and  feet of the prisoner to which they were desirous  of giving liberty but before they could effect its  release it was absolutely necessary to enlarge the  opening For this purpose these guardians cut  out a portion in the longitudinal direction of the  cocoon with their teeth alone employing these  instruments as we are in the habit of employing  a pair of scissors To expedite the work some  raised up a little slip cut out in the length of the  cocoon whilst others drew the insect gently from its  imprisonment When the ant was extricated from  its enveloping membrane it was not like other  insects capable of enjoying its freedom and  taking flight it could neither fly nor walk nor  without difficulty stand for the body was still  confined by another membrane from which it could  not by its own exertions disengage itself   In this fresh embarrassment the labourerants  did not forsake it they removed the satinlike  pellicle which embraced every part of the body  drew the antenme gently from their investment then disengaged the feet and the wings  and lastly the body with the abdomen and its  peduncle The insect was now in a condition to  walk and receive nourishment for which it appeared there was urgent need the first attention  therefore paid it by the guardians was that of  giving it the food I had placed within their reach  It is droll to add and it may be some of our  readers may feel somewhat abashed at the fact  that these labourerants are extremely particular  in the observance of great order and regularity  in their chambers and they therefore carefully  sweep up all the castoff coverings which are  collected together and deposited in one of the  most distant lodges of their habitation Could  man with all the powers of reason and the faculties of an immortal being have evinced a more  striking instance of careful gentle and patient  assistance in the hour of need than we see manifested in the case of these insects Alas how  often does man need to come to them to learn not  only a lesson of wisdom and order but of the tenderest sympathy and affection How often lies  a poor fellowcreature in the bondage of hopeless  poverty or in the embarrassment of inextricable  difficulties How seldom does his emergency meet  with that resolute and thoroimhminded earnest  ness of brotherly love which will patiently give  him help and pity until his troubles are surmounted and his steps set free  It is time that we spoke somewhat upon the extrication of insects from their pupa cases even when  under water Here arises a great difficultythe  wings of the insects thus placed if wet with water  would be unfitted for flight and would probably  frequently lead to the death of the insect by  drowning Yet it is to leave its subaqueous  abode mount up through the waves overhead and  finally emerge without a drop of water clinging to  its body and from the glassy surface of the water  it is to take its flight into the air Some will be  tempted to exclaimThis is a clear impossibility Far from it The little worm so well  known to anglers as the caddisworm performs  this feat with the greatest ease and in the follow¬  ing manner  It has been mentioned that the larva known  under this name constructs for itself a case of  The Pupacase Larva and Fly of Caddisworm  various materials in which it dwells at the bottom  of the waters where the hand of the young angler  knows well to find them This case is heavier  than water and consequently cannot float and so  carry the insect to the surface As the insect  enters the pupa state it weaves at the entrance of  its singular habitation a grating of silk which  strange to say is not only not softened and melted  away by the water but hardens under it until it  is as hard as gum This little grating is of a circular form and fits exactly into the opening  and is perforated with holes so as to look something like the gratings which cover  our coalcellar mouths in the pavement of cities These holes are for  the purpose of letting in fresh water  for the respiration of the insect  Out of this under water cell the  insect must make its escape To enable it so  to do the pupa is furnished with two strong  curved jaws which are of no other use than to  assist it in making an opening in one of the  silken doors of its case as they are cast off immediately afterwards and there remains not a  vestige of them in the perfect insect This opening made the pupa forces its way out at that  end But what then How is it to reach the surface even now Its legs as will be seen by looking  at the cut are furnished with a number of hairlike  processes which assist it  in swimming it therefore  still enclosed in the waterproof coatthe pupa skin  strikes upwards to the  surface and reaching it  its skin splits its impervious raiment is cast aside  and the insect springs from Hairs  the surface into the air without the minutest  drop of water to impede her flight or injure the  delicate tissue of her wings  We may take another common insect for an  illustration of this mode of escape from the pupa  of an equally interesting kind If the reader will  on some fine summer day resort to any place of  standing water by the roadside he may probably  succeed in discovering the emergence of a number  of piats and a very amusing occupation it is to  stand by and watch the insectthis moment an  occupant of the waters and the next darting in  the air a new and airbreathing form of existence  About ten days after the gnat has become pupa it  prepares for leaving that state and becoming a  perfect insect by raising itself to the surface of the  water stretching out its body there the thorax  or in simpler language the front enlarged part  being raised above it Immediately the eye of the  observer detects the fact that some change is taking  place in the insect the enlarged portion cracks  and splits and through this opening the head of  the gnat makes its appearance then the trunk of  the insect rises in a curious manner through the  breach and more and more of its body rises pre¬  serving all the time a perpendicular position so  that it looks just as if it were rising out of the  water and not out of the horizontal pupa case  floating on the surface The upright body of the  gnat now resembles a mast in a boat only that it  is continually being raised higher and higher by  the gradual emergence of the insect Its wings  and legs are all folded closely down its sides  as is shown in the cut and it has therefore no  power at all to prevent its being overset by a  breeze and drowned in the little waves below  the lower portion of its body alone retains it in  this position being as yet contained within the  pupa case No shipbuilder dare venture to  put a mast of such proportions into any of his  vessels for fear of their being topheavy and  hence liable to heel over in a gale of wind And  undoubtedly many gnats particularly in windy  weather are shipwrecked as soon as they emerge  This is in fact a moment of pecidiar danger to the  little insectmariner and a breath of untoward air  will frequently drive it about like a ship in a  tempestuous ocean and if it is once laid on its side  all is over with the gnat no patent apparatus can  save it and we have the mournful testimony of  Reaumur that in stormy weather he has seen  a vast number of such shipwrecks in the mimic  ocean of a pool of water Generally speaking  the peril is only momentary and the insect emerges  in safety Having thus raised itself to the perpendicular position the gnat withdraws its two fore¬  legs from the pupa case and stretches them out  then it draws out its two next and now feeling  safe it quits the perpendicular position and bends  toward the water plants its feet on its glistening  surface which is to it as safe as the land since it  has the faculty of walking on the waves It is  now in perfect safety its wings expand and  become dry and presently the insect will for the  first time make use of them by flying to some  adjoining twig  But we need not in many cases leave our homes  to see an escape from the pupa in every respect  as singular as the last and in many precisely  identical Before the writers studywindow was  an artificial fountain in which as the water was  not constantly allowed to play aquatic insects of  various kinds had permission to establish them¬  selves Nor were they long in availing themselves  of this liberty A week or two of genial summer  weather was sufficient to people the water with  various inhabitants among them was a little  creature which will be recognised by every reader  when we mention its title the bloodworm It  is in reality not a worm at all although resembling  worm in shape and in its serpentlike movements  This little creature was  for a time particularly  active and in a tumbler  of water taken from the  fountain might be seen  perhaps a dozen of them  twisting about in a very  singular manner By andbv a change came  over them and it turned out that the worm¬  like creatures had become pupae of a blackish  colour thus at once deciding their insect character They belong in fact to the insect  called the Chironomus plumosus These black  pupae were scarcely less active than the red blood¬  worms or larvte of the same insect The r flapped  about their tails with great vehemence and thus  although their bodies naturally sink in the water  they were able to swim from the bottom to the  surface or from side to side Observing that they  had finished their appointed period in the pupa  form we became anxious to watch their change  into the perfect insect Neglecting however to  notice them at the proper periodthe afternoon of  a warm sunny day we were astonished the next  morning to find a surprising number of pupa skins  lying empty of their tenants on the surface as  though some of the water fairies enumerated in  fable had been dancing on the waves all night and  left their little black shoes behind them in their  haste to flee from the light of the smiling morning  We determined to be better prepared for the observation on that day and as the afternoon came we  had the gratification of seeing a large number of  these insects rise from the water all in the following mannerThey rose up from the bottom and  reached the surface by the peculiar movement of  their tails just described there the thorax was  thrust above the water and immediately the insect burst its cerements elevated itself by a wave¬  like motion from the rest of the pupa case which filled with air and now glistened like silver it  then planted its forelegs on the water withdrew  the rest of its body from the case unfolded its  wings and in a few moments was sailing in the  thin air On one stormy day the surface of our  fountain was bestrewn with the dead and dying  bodies of these insects drowned in the waves  De Geer speaking of the pupae of a moth  states that he was not fortunate enough to wit¬  ness the manner in which they quit their watery  abode But he seems to think that they quit  the pupa case then mount to the surface of  the water or up some aquatic plant in order  to reach a dry spot where they remain their  wings being developed afterwards and that  thus the risk of their being wetted is avoided  Their bodies being lighter than the water lie  conceives accounts for their being able to rise to  its surface Too much weight however must not  be attached to this observation as it is not accompanied with satisfactory ocular evidence of the fact  The pupa of the dragonfly furnishes us with  a very interesting example of escape and it well  deserves the readers attention if he be so placed  as to have the opportunity of observing it Per¬  haps indeed few insects afford us such a singular  series of interesting facts as are to be found in the  escape of this one from its pupa The best method  of observing their change is to procure as many of  the larvse as possible to put them in a basin of  water at the bottom of which are a quantity of  dead leaves and to allow  several sticks to be in  the water touching the  bottom of the basin and  reaching above the level  of the water as shown in  the cut Then we must  watch carefully to notice  any of the larvae which having become pupa creep  towards the edge of the water These are such  as will in all probability be the first to undergo  the change for they come to that position in  order that they may get dry before proceeding  further If these are now closely observed they  will be seen after the lapse of a little time to  leave their position and to begin creeping about  in search of a suitable spot where they may  undergo their metamorphosis Most probably  they will select for this purpose the sticks we  have introduced into the basin and after running  up and down them will fix upon a particular  spot where they place themselves securely the  head invariably uppermost From what will be  subsequently mentioned it is necessary that the  insect should fasten itself so  firmly to the branch that not  even a violent effort would  disturb its position This is se¬  cured by the insect thrusting  the sharp claws with which its  feet are armed into the stem on  which it rests The points of  these claws are so fine and hard  as even to penetrate wood with  t Pupa of Dragonfly showing the  facility I hey are shown in shap poinU at the end of us feet  the cut and even after the dragonfly has escaped  out of the pupa ease they may be easily made to  fasten upon a piece of a branch by simply pressing  the feet against it very lightly In order to  watch the changes of this insect Reaumur once  whilst staying in the country collected a large  number of the pupse and placed them on a piece  of cottonprint tapestry where they soon felt at  home and fixed themselves in preparation for  their change without moving far from the spot  where they had been placed At few periods of  the day could a visit be paid to the room where  this tapestry was hung without seeing a spectacle  at once diverting and extraordinary Previous to  its changes the pupa becomes more transparent  and the large and beautiful eyes of the insect it  encloses grow increasingly brilliant These signs  always indicate that the transformation is nigh at  hand  It comes to pass in the following mannerSome  movements of a struggling kind take place inside  the pupa case and at length the case splits at the  upper part near the head through this rent the body  of the dragonfly appears and tears it open acting like  a wedge until the slit extends along the head across  to the two eyes The latter transverse slit is produced by a contrivance similar to that mentioned in  the case of the blowfly a sort of air bladder which  the insect distends at its pleasure and thus causes  the skin covering its head and eyes to split open  The head and body of the insect rise and make  their appearance through the slit and the head is  now so much larger than it appeared while in the  pupa case that it seems almost impossible that it  could ever have been contained within it The  insect continues to rise perpendicularly out of the  case and the legs make their exit leaving the leg  cases of the pupa undisturbed in their attachment  to the support on which it rests In order to  facilitate the disengagement of the rest of its body  the insect now bends itself in a curved form  backwards being only kept from filling by the  last rings or segments of its body being still  embraced by the sheath of the pupa case When  it has extricated itself thus far it begins to move  about its legs in different directions for several  minutes as if to get them into use but after this  it ceases all movement whatever Not a quiver  can be seen in its limbs and the young observer  would be inclined to concludeas a great entomologist once did the first time he witnessed the  changes of this insectthat it was in reality dead  and that it was a waste of time to watch it any  longer This state of profound inaction may endure  for a quarter or even half an hour it appears to  be intended in order to give time to the insect to  recruit its strength for a fresh and more violent  series of efforts and to admit of its parts becoming  hardened and dry Suddenly as we are perhaps  carelessly looking on the inanimate object it performs a feat of the most surprising because unexpected agility Its body which was previously much bent backwards is now swung  forwards and bent into a curve it then swings  back and then forwards again and so quickly  that it almost seems to leap It then rests its  legs upon the front part of the pupa case and  pulls the rest of its body out of the case by  degrees and then creeps forward leaving the pupa  case behind still immovably fixed upon the  plant   Behold says Reaumur the dragonfly new  born but very different from those which traverse  the air or rest upon the plants around It is  quite in disguise The body though longer than  the pupa case out of which it was drawn has not  got all its natural length The wings which are  the large and useful organs of these flies have as  yet very little more volume than they had when  enclosed in the short and straitened pupa case  They are merely furrowed plates or laminae of  some thickness and arranged one over the other  as if packed together One can scarcely conceive  how each of these wings can acquire its proper  dimensionshow it is to enlarge and lengthen  sufficiently They are folded into plaits like a  fan or like the leaf of a tree just about to be  developed hence they naturally appear very narrow and the cause of their appearing so short is  that each of their longitudinal portions is folded up  like the paper lanterns more frequently used by  nuns than by other persons  The remaining portion of the dragonflys history will be found in the next chapter  Some curious instances are given by various  authors of the escape of more than one insect  from the same pupa Thus we are told that a  male and female emperor moth were once pro¬  duced from one larva and therefore one pupa of  extraordinary size Messrs Kirby and Spence  tell ns of n German entomologist who says that  two specimens of the pinelappet moth were once  produced from one pupa which was of the re¬  markable size of two inches in length and one in  thickness But these are very rare instances the  common and almost universal rule being that one  pupa only contains one insect  Nothing now remains for us to add to the  insects history in the pupa state Alreadyfor  it is Spring far advancedthe air is becoming  peopled with insect tribes   The insect youth are on the wing  Eager to taste the honied spring  And float amid the liquid noon  A thousand times ten thousand nay thousands of  thousands are already in the air and the low  hum of their wings may be heard if we stand  breathless and listen in the midst of some sequestered spot far from the roar and bustle and  strife of town life But the great lifeseason of  the insect world is yet to come and though May  whispers it is nigh June July and August  must bring it to us and with it a teeming multitude of insect flutterers more numerous than the  stars of heaven or the sandgrains of the seashore  PART IVTHE IMAGO  CHAPTEK I  THE NEWBORN PERFECT INSECT   Oh start not on thy closing eyes  Another day shall still unfold  A sun of milder radiance rise  A happier age of joys untold  Shall the poor worm that shocks thy sight  The humblest form in natures train  Thus rise in newborn lustre bright  And yet the emblem teach in vain 1  Beautiful as these lines are and poetical as is  the idea they develop they are incorrect The  perfect insect springing from the pupa is not  an emblem of mans glorious resurrection from  this body of sin and death why we shall immediately discuss In the oftentimes beautiful mythology of Greece the name for the butterfly was   x l rv X h ia T is the soul Just as the insect bursts  with brilliant wings from the dull and grovelling form of the pupa flutters in the blaze of day  roams on untiring wings through the genial air  and enjoys the use of faculties so new and strange  to it when contrasted with those of the pupa  stateso was it imagined that the souls arising  from amid the corruption of this vile body would  prove a deliverance from the bondage of mortality  and the countless infirmities to which it is heir  And surely there was much poetry in the conception but we who must not leave the path of  true insect history for any poetical fancies have  now to remind the reader that the simile is in  many respects inaccurate and in so doing we shall  merely bring to his recollection what was said as  to the contents of the pupacase at p 231 From  this it appears that the pupa state far from being  a state of death is one in which new parts are  added to the insect in which the insect is actually  not only alive but in some instances capable of  moving about as well as before or after and lastly  in which the various organs of the perfect insect  all exist previous to the disclosure of the latter  Tlius if we were to slit open a pupacase just  before the insect bursts from it we should find  that although kept in bondage by the case the  insect was in all respects the same as if we had  allowed it to break out of its prison in the ordinary manner In a word the perfect insect is  after all only the same being which we saw in the  egg larva and pupa states now having cast off  its last skin and become an adult being  When a man or an animal dies the particles of  the body are separated from each other their union  is destroyed and they themselves are dissipated in  various ways The flesh returns to dust the spirit  to God who gave it How different this change  from that which the insect undergoes and how  inappropriate in strictness as   Emblems of our own great resurrection  Emblems of the bright and better land  as emblems of the mysterious union of the immortal soul and its immortal incorruptible body The  fable of the Phoenix was more expressive of the  real nature of this great change for there the  body of the creature was reduced to death first  and the newborn being sprang from its ashes As  we are anxious to convey only the most clear and  accurate idea to the readers mind of the various  stages of insect life through which we are con  ducting him it appeared expedient to notice the  mistake taught in these pleasing lines only to  avoid the error of its being supposed that they  give us an accurate idea of the true nature of the  change from pupa to imago  The term Imago is a Latin word and like those  of larva and pupa was given to insects in this  condition by the naturalist Linnaeus It signifies  properly an image copy or representation of any  object In applying it to insects in their last  stage Linnaeus intended that we should under¬  stand by it that the insect had now reached its  stage of perfection and had become in all respects  exactly like that is the image of its parent And  though a better term might probably be found  yet as no person is likely to fall into any serious  mistake merely because we call an insect in its  last state an imago it is as well to retain it  better indeed than by inventing another to create  nothing but confusion and disorder in the minds  of young entomologists In this chapter there¬  forethe last chapter of the Life of an Insect the  word imago may be considered as synonymous or  having the same meaning with that of e perfect  insect it is an insects last stage of existence  It would be a great mistake to suppose that the  insect so soon as it leaves the pupacase is in that  instant in every respect similar to what is known  to us as the perfect insect When for example  a butterfly has just succeeded in extricating itself  from its pupacase if we were to take it up in the  expectation of finding it all at once decked with  the glories of its wings and elegant in its form  we should be disappointed Owing to the cramped  position which its limbs and wings and other  organs have so long been made to occupy its  appearance when it emerges from the pupa is  necessarily different from that which it wears  after all its limbs have been in free exercise and  the flutter of its wings has been heard over hill  and dale throwing the gentle air into an irregular  line of tumult  Now that summer has come abundant opportunities for watching insects in all their stages  may be had and by careful searching of the  garden field and woodland a number of pupie  may be discovered on the very eve of disclosing  the imago or perfect insect Let us suppose  that the reader has not looked in vain but has  brought home in a tin box several of these  singular objects about which so much has been  said The pupa ready to burst open and let loose  the struggling captive within is before him the  skin splits the body of the insect appears withdraws  itself from the pupacase and inner membranes  and the imago appears before him But O how  different from the splendidly adorned insect which  we know it is still to become Its tender body is  weak soft and languid and bedewed with moisture  Its wings instead of being of their usual size and  variegated with such glowing and admirably con¬  trasted colours as only a Divine hand could create  are in the largest sized butterflies scarcely bigger  than the nail of the little finger instead of being  uplifted in full strength and beauty they hang  drooping down over the sides of the trunk and  their colours are all dull and muddy and without  any of those distinct spots and beautifully defined  marks streaks and bands which we observe with  so much admiration in the wiims of these insects  Altogether we might take it rather for a mutilated  and imperfect insect instead of what in spite of  its unattractive appearance it really isa perfect  insect and in a short time to become a splendid  one  We have only to wait patiently for the lapse  of a little time and our desires will be fully  gratified in beholding all these symptoms of  weakness and imperfection disappear The imago  attaching itself either to the castoff pupacase  or to some other convenient support first stretches  out one organ and then another its body loses  the coating of moisture which bedewed it its  various parts become firm and hardened and its  colours come forth in all their beauty All the  parts which had been forced into a constrained  position now relieved assume that which is  natural to them in the perfect insect and the  wings no longer have a questionable appearance  but become expanded into those light and ex¬  quisite structures which form the peculiar beauty  and characteristic of many insects displaying  themselves almost magically in the form it may  be of the thin transparent membrane of the fly  or as the painted tissue of the moth or butterfly  extending frequently to five or six times their  previous dimensions  Here let us take up as an illustration of these  beautiful and interesting phenomena the concluding portion of the history of the dragonfly commenced at p 302 The expansion of the wings  of this elegant creature after it has left the  pupacase and fixed itself generally on the stem  of some pond plant goes on so rapidly that we  can actually see them becoming larger each  moment as we look upon them If we were to  attempt to trace their outline on paper before the  next stroke could be added their form would be  different During the whole time that the development of the wings goes on the insect continues perfectly still and immovable Its wings  are not stirred in the least and the insect seems  to avoid all risk of having these delicate organs  touched by any surrounding object Its wings  which are byandby to possess almost the stiffness  of a thin layer of the mineral talc are at present  softer and more flexible than wet writing paper  and if they were to receive any injury while in  this condition that injury could never be repaired  hence the insect requires to be in a perfectly quiet  condition The dragonfly seems to be fully aware  of this and in order to prevent the wings as they  increase in size from drooping down towards and  coming in contact with its body it curves it in the  manner represented so as to allow for the expansion  and elongation of the wings At length generally  in a quarter of an hours time their development is  fully completed but they are not yet sufficiently  firm and resisting to use in flying If left to  itself the insect generally waits three or even  four hours before it puts them into inactivity  In addition to the expansion and elongation of  its wings its body also elongates until it has  acquired its full dimensions In vain should we  look at first for the splendid colours in which these  insects are decked all the tints are blotted and  unpleasing Those charming species which are  spotted with beautiful blue and yellow tints intersprinkled with black are when they are but  just emerged from the pupa of a whitish yellow  spotted with brown the yellow marks however  are seen to change to a beautiful deep orange the  brown to black and some of the yellow marks to  blue  The following interesting description of the  same changes as they take place in the butterfly  is from the valuable work of Messrs Kirby and  Spence The pupa of a very interesting and  beautiful butterfly the only one of its description  that Britain has yet been ascertained to produce  I mean Papilio Machaon being brought to me  by a friend early in May this year on the sixteenth of that month I had the pleasure of seeing  it leave its pupacase With great care I placed  it upon my arm where it kept pacing about for  the space of more than an hour when all its parts  appearing consolidated and developed and the  animal perfect in beauty I secured it though not  without great reluctance for my cabinet it being  the only living specimen of this line fly I had ever  seen To observe how gradual and yet how  rapid was the development of the parts and organs  and particularly of the wings and the perfect  coming forth of the colours and spots as the sun  gave vigour to it was a most interesting spectacle  At first it was unable to elevate or even to move  its wings but in proportion as the aerial or other  fluid was forced by the motions of its trunk into  their nervures their numerous corrugations and  folds gradually yielded to the action till they  had gained their greatest extent and the film  between all the nervures became tense The  ocelli and spots and bars which appeared at  first as but germs or rudiments of what they were  to be grew with the growing wing and shone  forth upon its complete expansion in full magnitude and beauty  If we were expert anatomists and were armed  with a good microscope the study of the wing of  a dragonfly would prove one of great interest to  us These beautiful organs however must be  examined when they are as yet but a little expanded as in their completely developed state  we should certainly Tail in detecting their real  structure Thin and gauzelike as they seem  they are in reality double consisting of an upper  and a lower surface between which are several  parts which are necessary to preserve the shape  and carry on the functions of the wings The  two surfaces of the wing enclose what are called  the nervures resembling in some respects the  veins of a leaf These are really fine hollow  tubes of some firmness which ramify in large  numbers between the two membranes of the  wing and thus give strength and stability of  figure to them Along these tubes or nervures  branches of the airvessels or trachea and of  the bloodvessels run  From these necessary details let us turn to  make the difficult but important inquiryHow  are the wings expanded by what means do they  from being thick soft and moist become thin  hard and dry It is to be regretted that this  inquiry cannot be answered with that satisfactory  certainty which it deserves It is very difficult to  catch the insects in which the expansion of the  wings is best observed at the right moment and  even then it is extremely difficult to say whether  one cause more than another may contribute to  this phenomenon The following explanation of  it is given by Messrs Kirby and Spence whose  general accuracy on such subjects is well known  e As soon as the insect is disclosed a fluid enters  the tubes or nervures and being impelled into  their minutest ramifications necessarily expands  their folds for the nervures themselves are folded  and as they gradually extend in length with them  the moist membranes attached to them are also  unfolded and extended In proportion as this  takes place the expanding membranes approach  each other and at last being dried by the action  of the atmosphere become one To promote this  motion of the fluid seems the object of the agitations which in many instances the animal from  time to time gives to its unexpanded wings That  a kind of circulation or rather an injection of an  aqueous fluid into these organs actually takes place  may he ascertained by a very simple experiment  If you clip the wings of a butterfly during the  process of expansion you will see that the  nervures are not only hollow but that however  dry and empty they may subsequently be found  they at that time actually contain such a fluid  Swammerdam who appears to have been the first  physiologist that paid attention to this subject  was of opinion that an aeriform as well as an  aquiform fluid contributes to produce the effect  we are considering He had observed that if a  small portion be cut off from the wing of a bee  a fluid of the latter kind exuded from its vessels in  the form of pellucid globules becoming insensibly  drops which he concluded proved the action of the  latter and he noticed also that the wings were  furnished with trachea which were at that time  distended by the injected air whence he justly  surmised that the action of the air was also of  great importance to produce the expansion of the  wing But Swammerdam appears only twice  to have seen the expansion of the dragonfly in  which this phenomenon is best observed Herold  an eminent naturalist also attributes the expansion of the wing to the flow of an aqueous fluid into  the nervures M Chabrier a French entomologist having observed a fluid in the interior of  the nervures of the wings of insects thinks it  probable that they can introduce it into them and  withdraw it at their pleasure so as to facilitate their  unfolding When we call to mind the force with  which the blowfly or fleshfly and the dragonfly are able to expand their heads by forcing air  into them we need scarcely ask for any other  explanation than simply that the tracheae are  distended with air and by that means the soft  and yielding wings are made to assume their distended state  It has been mentioned that in the case of the  dragonfly the completion of the unfolding of its  wings occupies about a quarter of an hour but that  sometimes it is even half an hour The ordinary  period is from five to ten or fifteen minutes in most  insects but it is sometimes prolonged to an hour  or to several hours Again in others as we have  already seen in the history of the emergence of the  gnat and other insects from their aquatic state in  the pupa it is completed in a few seconds and the  insect only rests for this brief period on the surface  of the water previous to taking flight from its  apparently somewhat dangerous position  Some observations of Mr Rennie show in a singular manner the fact before mentioned that if  the wings while yet wet and soft are in any way  pressed upon or otherwise injured they will never  assume their proper appearance The thread by  which a chrysalis is suspended may sometimes  snap asunder when this happens and the chrysalis is allowed to remain it will not usually produce an insect complete in all its parts for the  side upon which it lies being pressed against an  unyielding substance by its own weight instead of  hanging lightly suspended by a silken cord is pre¬  vented from becoming duly expanded and when  the insect is excluded it is found to be deformed  A colony of the browntail moth which we reared  during the summer of 1829 spun in the corner of  a nursebox a common web of several chambers  for containing the pupte One of these chambers  being accidentally torn a pupa fell upon the earth  in the bottom of the box and in due time a female  moth was produced from it but she never succeeded  in expanding her wings which remained till her  death shrunk rumpled and totally useless for the  purpose of flying though in every other respect  she was full grown and deposited in the box a  group of fertile eggs covered with down from her  tail as neatly as was done by her sisters of the  same brood In the summer of 1825 the chrysalis  of a small tortoiseshell butterfly Vanessa urticce  lost its hold of its silken suspensory and fell upon  the pasteboard bottom of a nursebox resting in  a sort of angular position so that the case of the  upper wing on the left side pressed upon the box  with the whole weight of the chrysalis above it  When the butterfly made its appearance it expanded its wings as usual but the wing upon  which it had rested was not half the size of the  one on the right side which had lain uppermost  Another of the same brood had from some cause  not grown so large in the caterpillar state as the rest  It was transformed notwithstanding into a chrysalis which appeared healthy and wellformed but  when the butterfly appeared though it did not  differ from the usual appearance its wings never  expanded a single hairs breadth and remained  always in the same state as when it issued from  the chrysalis  After the insect has once withdrawn itself from  the pupacase it generally retains the same appearance and raiment as long as it lives not casting its  akin like the larva but having put on its permanent  clothing immediately upon its leaving the pupa  case But hi the case of an aquatic insect the  Ephemera of which we have before spoken a re¬  markable exception to this rule has been noticed  When these insects leave the pupacase any one on  looking at them would say that they had completed  their changes they appear to be furnished with  every part necessary to them and not to have any  which is redundant yet they are destined to go  through a change equivalent to that which has just  taken place if indeed it is not more apparently  difficult than it and that isthey have to cast off  their skin That they should be able to withdraw  from thence their head their legs their body and  their long tails would be no great difficulty for us  to comprehend because numbers of insects at their  escape from the pupacase do more than this but  in their case we are presented with a more perplexing enigma In the transformation of other  insects as we have already seen and indeed in  that of the insects before us the wings are at first  very soft and pliable and therefore can be easily  withdrawn from the cases in which they were contained But in the Ephemera the wings after it  has left the pupacase are fully developed and  expanded and seem to have acquired all their consistence and to have become hard and inflexible  Moreover its wings are so thin that we can  scarcely believe that they are in reality double  that is that they are covered by an outside sheath  and it seems incomprehensible how if such is the  fact the wings can be withdrawn from this case  or sheath when the only opening that can be dis¬  covered for that purpose is a very minute hole  near the spot where the wings take origin from  the body of the insect Let us now see how all  these difficulties are overcome and how the insect  withdraws itself from this as we might almost call  it second pupacase  The Ephemene when they leave the water  rise high into the air and wing their way perhaps far from the place of their birth They  may often be found wheeling over green fields  or wandering among the forest shades far from  the bubbling stream in whose waters so large a  portion of their existence was spent but more  frequently they are to be found somewhere in the  neighbourhood of the stream enjoying an aerial  dance The feet of the insect are armed with hooks  of great minuteness and by their means the insect  attaches itself to a suitable object sometimes to a  wall sometimes to a twig or to the trunk of a tree  it does not much matter where Without at first  making the least movement the insect patiently  abides the time when it must withdraw itself from  its useless upper garment and sometimes it has  to wait a whole day in this position The time  arrived the skin splits and the body of the  insect rises gradually out of it but the difficulty  is about the wings Nevertheless as we watch  the insect we shall find that it gradually draws  them out of their delicate cases and at length  emerges as perfect in beauty and form as before The manner in which this is effected  is as followsalthough the outer case of the  wings is hard and rigid yet the wings which  it covers over are preserved in a soft and moist  condition In proportion therefore as the insect  disengages itself from the anterior part of the skin  the inner or real wings become contracted by a  number of plaits into a form nearly cylindrical  which readily admits of their being pulled through  the openings lately mentioned and as soon as the  insect is released from its envelope these plaits  unfold and the wings return to their former shape  and dimensions So exactly does this thin skin  thus cast off fit all the parts of the insects body  INSECTS WITHOUT WINGS  329  that it may often be mistaken for the insect itself  when it is found clinging to the place where it has  gone through its changes  Before we leave the subject of the  wings it must be mentioned that  there are some insects which have  none The cut represents a beetle  of this class Wingless Beetle  If the reader will now take a peep into one of  the nurseboxes in which he may have been rearing  butterflies from the pupa presuming that several  of them have ere this burst from their cases and  are fluttering about anxious for liberty he will  generally detect upon the bottom or sides of the  box one or two marks of a somewhat reddish  colour sometimes indeed they are very red These  spots are produced by the insect which on its  emergence from the pupa generally deposits a  drop of fluid from its intestines Almost all  insects perforin the same action at this period  but we may well remark with Reaumur it could  scarcely have been supposed that the excrements  of a butterfly should ever have filled the minds of  a whole population with terror Such has however been the case and may perhaps yet be in  districts where ignorance and superstition close  the minds of the inhabitants against the truths of  entomology Historians says Reaumur tell  us of showers of blood as having been the cause of  terror to nations and considered as prophetic of  fearful events of the destruction of cities and  revolutions of kingdoms At the beginning of  the month of July in the year 1608 one of these  showers of blood was said to have fallen in the  suburbs of Aix and for some miles around  It turned out that the supposed drops of blood  were in reality drops deposited by the butterflies It is not improbable that other showers  of blood recorded by historians and taking  place about the same period of the year might  be accounted for in the same natural and simple  manner Gregory of Tours relates that in the  time of Childebert a shower of blood fell in  different places in Paris and particularly in a  certain house situated in the territory of Senlis  Another was said to have fallen toward the end of  June in the reign of King Robert In the year  1533 we are told by another author a prodigious  multitude of butterflies appeared throughout a  great portion of Germany sprinkling plants  leaves buildings clothes and men with bloody  drops as if it had rained blood  In the Gentlemans Magazine for the year 1764  we read that a kind of rain of a red colour  resembling blood fell in many parts of the Duchy  of Cleves and caused great consternation Something of the like kind fell also at Rhenen in the  province of Utrecht A gentleman is reported  to have sent a bottle full of it to Dr Schutte to  know if it contained anything pernicious to health  Dr Schutte wrote a learned dissertation upon it  and gave it as his opinion that it was caused by the  particles which had been raised into the atmosphere by a strong wind and that it was in no  way hurtful to mankind or beasts Probably  butterflies were the real shedders of this blood¬like shower as in the previous cases Our next remark about the imago state of insects will perhaps create some surpriseInsects  in this state with some apparent exceptions do  not grow larger When they leave the pupa state  and have all their parts fully developed they do  not subsequently increase in size We are often  told by ignorant people that the little houseflies  which we watch dancing in our chambers or  scrambling up our windows are only young flies  of the same kind as fleshflies and that byandby  they will grow into a large ff Bluebottle This is  a sad mistake Let the reader try Let a fly be  put under a glass and fed with a little sugar or  honey in vain will he daily examine it in the  expectation of beholding it increase in sizeit will  live and die nearly the same little being unaltered  to the last If such persons only knew somewhat  of the life of an insect such an absurd and unfortunately very prevalent mistake would not be committed We might as reasonably call a trout a  young salmon If we were to examine any number  of flies of the housefly kind Jslusca domestica and  carefully measure them or weigh them we should  find them all almost exactly of the same size  which of course would not be the case if they  really grew larger as they grew older  But there are some insects which after they  leave their pupa increase within a very short time  to a size which could scarcely be believed In  particular the newborn insects of a tribe of flies  which produce the aphislion larva before spoken  of are distinguished by this peculiarity We  behold a very little insect emerge from the pupa  case and in a quarter of an hour we are astonished  to find it has grown to a great fly This sudden  increase appears the more marvellous because  during this period the insect takes no nourishment The wings of this insect when it is just  born are not more than onetenth the size they  acquire in that short space of time The insect  is to all appearance firm and plump and offers  a ridiculous contrast to the tiny pupacase out  of which it has emerged It appears probable  that this sudden enlargement is to be accounted  for by the insect filling itself with air and thus  causing the various parts so closely packed together and fitted into one another in the pupa  to be expanded The experiment which puts  this idea to the test is a very simple one we  need only prick the body of the insect with a fine  needle and we shall hear a slight sound produced  by the escape of the air and in a few seconds  the body of the creature shrinks to its former  dimensions It appears indeed that the body  of the insect is actually larger at this time than  at a subsequent period of its life when it becomes  more flattened and shorter Another beautiful  insect one of the lacewinged flies exhibits the  same singular phenomenon Its pupacase is not  larger than a small pea yet the body of the insect  is nearly halfaninch long and covers when its  wings and antennas are expanded a surface of  an inch square It appears in fact almost incredible that it could ever have been contained  within so small a compass  The cases just related may appear to be really  exceptions to the rule just laid down as to the  nonincrease of insects when once emerged from  the pupa but upon a little consideration it will  be found that the exceptions are more apparent  than real The increase in size is not really  a process of growth but is simply owing to the  expansion of the body of the insect to its due  size only taking place in a sudden manner  by breathing a certain amount of air The  dragonfly gives us another instance of a similar  enlargement soon after leaving the pupacase  CHAPTER II  THE STRUCTURE AND ORGANS OF THE IMAGO  We must now ask the readers attention to  a very important part of the history of the  insectthe knowledge of its various parts and  their uses in the insect economy Men of science  would call this the anatomy and physiology of  insects and if there is a desire felt to know and  retain the proper terms employed by those versed  in this science when they treat of these subjects  it will be well to bear these names in mind We  may however  convey some notion of the nature  of the studies  called by these  names by the following illustration Let us take  yonder butterfly  as our example and arresting it in its zigzag career  over flowers and fields let us carefully bring  it indoors and there look closely at its various  parts and appendages There we find two long  delicate threadlike organs springing from the  head then we come to the head with its different  organs farther back is a separate portion distinct  from the head and distinct also from the remainder of the body of the insect at the side of it  are the wings below are the legs last of all we  bring under our notice the remaining division of  the insects body the abdomen Now if Anatomy  stood at our right hand while we took notice  of each part she would point out all the peculiarities of its structure and would tell us of how many  other parts it was made up and how all were beautifully and wonderfully put together by the skill of  the Great Creator Further than this she would  very probably strongly insist upon our remembering each part by a particular name and as  we may add since she is particularly fond of and  learned in Latin and Greek we may rest quite  assured each name she communicated to us would  be in one or other of these classical languages  for example instead of saying the butterfly was  one of the scalewinged insects which would  be far too homely for her she would declare that  it belonged to the Lepidoptera which is the same  thing in Greek and its head she would inform  us was the caput which is the Latin for that  word This done her strict duties would be exactly fulfilled and she would summon her sister  science Physiology to give us further information about the butterfly Physiology who we  may remark is a far less sternlooking personage  than her austere relative and appears with a  countenance which expresses that she has much  to tell us which will greatly interest us would  next take up the panting insect She would tell  us to consider attentively the head of the little  creature while we listened to her elegant account  of the purposes it was intended to subserve She  would dilate with eloquence upon the exquisite  machinery which was compacted into so small  a compass as its mouth and she would render  us almost breathless with amazement as with  rising animation she revealed to us the astonishing  optical wonders of an insects eye telling us per¬  haps that an insect may probably see like the  fabled Argus behind and before and on every  side at the same time Then she would tell  us in order the nature and uses of each part  and in a word give us a minute but delightful  account of everything that is known about the  Life of an Insect  From this it will be manifest that we have  hitherto chiefly listened to the voice of Physiology in this little book although the leading  particulars of the Anatomy of the insect in  its various stages have also been brought before  us We must now address ourselves for some  little time to learn from the combined sciences  of Anatomy and Physiology the structure and  uses of the different organs and their principal  parts in the insect in the imago or perfect state  In order to follow the account we shall have  to give the reader it will be convenient to take  some common insect such as a ivasp and fix in  the memory the names of the various parts we  shall have to distinguish in thus treating of the  imago insect A dragonfly is a good example also  We shall first mention the sfeneral arrangement  of the insects structure and subsequently take  up each part separately  It must first be mentioned that insects possess  no internal bony skeleton like that possessed by  ourselves and many other animals If we were  to cut open the dead body of a fly we should look  in vain for anything like the backbone or the  bones of the legs But it must not therefore  be thought that insects have no skeleton at all  Their skeleton is the thick hard horny substance  which forms their external covering In the wasp  for instance it will be easily perceived on pressing  the head or the trunk of the insect between the  fingers that there is a very firm solid coating  protecting the tender and delicate organs within  It is a very singular fact that the wisdom of the  Creator has so ordered this outside coating that  where it is most necessary to be strong as for  example when an insect has to burrow through  the ground or is in danger of being often crushed  there its thickness is greatest and again where  as in the case of those insects which live chiefly in  the air this thickening is less necessary because  there is less risk of injury to its body there the  external covering is thinner and softer So extra¬  ordinarily is one insect strengthened in its external  coats that it is scarcely possible to crush it by the  hardest squeezing between the thumb and fingers  It has on this account been compared to a once  famous London character called Leathercoated  Jack who used to suffer carriages to be driven  over his body without receiving any harm  In looking at an insect we perceive that it  is naturally divisible into three principal parts  first there is the head or caput next the trunk  or thorax and thirdly the hinder portion of the  body or abdomen If we turn to a Latin dictionary and hunt out the word insecta which  is the Latin term for ee insect we shall find that it  is derived from a verb which signifies to be cut  in or notched From this we see that the very  word insect has arisen from perceiving what we  are now alluding to the natural notching of the  body of these creatures into certain portions We  mentioned however at page 89 that the insect  in the larva form had a body which was in  almost every instance divided into thirteen segments or parts It may be asked Are these all  lost in the perfect insect or are they still to  be traced in it They are still to be traced in it  The head is one three form the trunk or thorax  and the remaining number constitute the abdomen but in order to save disappointment it  must be added that it is rare to find the full  number of segments or distinct parts in the  abdomen we seldom in fact find more than seven  or eight the remaining two or one being generally  hidden It is interesting however to trace in the  perfect insect these indications of its previous  larval condition especially when we remember the  strange appearance it underwent while a pupa  Now the various parts in the head division  are to speak generally the head proper the  mouth the eyes and the antennce Entomologists  describe a large number of other parts which  would also be mentioned here if this little  treatise were intended to give a minute account  of the insects anatomy and those features which  are of most prominence and importance will be  mentioned in addition when we come to speak  particularly of these several chief organs  The middle portion of the insect or thorax is  divided into three partsa front middle and  hinder part or in the language of entomology  a prothorax a mesothorax and a metathorax  Attached to the thorax are the icings and the legs  The remaining portion or abdomen is furnished  with organs and appendages not requiring special  mention in this place  Let us consider briefly the organs which are  seated in these divisions and beginning with the  head let us glean a few particulars upon that  most interesting topicthe eyes of insects We  might well fill a volume with this subject alone  for truly it is almost inexhaustible In the other  sections of the animal kingdom the eyes though  organs of the highest importance are nevertheless simple and little varied in their number and  arrangement But in insects whether we consider  their number their structure their arrangement  or their size we are lost in amazement at finding  these organs assume an importance in the insects  economy of which we have  no parallel elsewhere Look  for example at the accompanying representation of  the eyes of a bee and then  let us ask whether in all the  world beside we can find a  creature whose two eyes are  larger than all the rest of its head put together  What should we think of a quadruped as large as  a bull whose eyes occupied great part of its head  its forehead and the greater portion of its face  What astonishing powers of sight it would possess  The first tiling we learn about them is that  some insects possess what are called simple eyes  and compound eyes The accompanying cut re¬  presents in part the head of a flea  and is annexed in order to give a  specimen of a simple eye The  little circle represents the position  of the simple eye All the organs connected with  the head are supposed to be cut off The head of  the bee on the preceding page furnishes us with  an excellent illustration of a compound eye All  perfect insects are provided with compound eyes  and a large number with simple eyes too but  no imago or perfect insect has simple eyes alone  We see therefore that the simple eyes are only  additional or supplementary organs to the compound eyes which are the chief organs of sight  in these creatures These simple eyes are minute lenses generally placed upon the crown of  the head or the forehead in the bee this is  their position and by means of a pocketglass  they can be readily seen in this insect by  looking at its head from above They will be  found arranged in a triangular form Sometimes  an insect is furnished with as many as sixteen  of these simple eyes the spicier is among others  thus endowed But more commonly they are  only three in number Sometimes they are not  imbedded in the substance of the head as might  be supposed but are actually placed upon the end  of a little stalk presenting an appearance as singular as if at the end of a  bulls horn the animal were to possess an  eye in addition to his two others Swammerdam and Reaumur performed some  Eye 071 a siaik singular experiments upon these eyes in  the bee Reaumur varnished the back of the head  where these eyes are situated in more than twenty  bees so as of course entirely to blind these eyes  but leaving the large compound eye untouched  The bees were then set at liberty within a few  paces from the hive but not one of them knew  where to find it again nor indeed did they appear  to make any search for it They flew at random  to the adjacent plants but never to a distance  and though they seemed to have no difficulty in  flying they did not attempt to fly up into the  air  The compound eyes of insects are perhaps among  the most wonderful works of the Creators hands  In those gigantic creatures whose fossilized bones  are all now remaining to tell us of their history  the mastodon and megatherium and in such vast  creatures as the elephant and the whale we behold  the great power skill and wisdom of God but  here in a little object which we may cover with  a pins head or with a large grain of sand is a  more wonderful instance of His infinite and amazing power than all these The eye of a dragonfly  is a good instance of a compound eye and of all  the beautiful radiant gemlike objects that can  be selected for inspection through the microscope  this is the most exquisite Professor Muller the  great German physiologist has with wonderful  patience and care dissected the eye of this insect  and has given a most beautiful account of its  structure On examining the eye of this insect  even with a good pocket magnifying glass such  as those commonly sold by opticians for a few  shillings it will be found to present  the appearance of a beautiful net¬  work or very fine grating as is  shown in the cut When a greater magnifying  power is employed it will be seen that each space  in this network is a sixsided or hexagonal figure  Now each of these little spaces is filled by a beautiful minute lens of the same shape set in it  On making a perpendicular cut into the eye it has  been found to consist of various layers the outer  layer is a hard clear membrane composed of a  multitude of six sided facets  each forming a more or less  distinct coneshaped cylinder  which runs towards the centre  of the eye as seen in the cut  Under this is a layer of coloured  matter sometimes of a violet  or green or even reddish hue  which is pierced with as many holes as there  are facets Beneath this there is a varnish of a  black colour within which is a second layer of  coloured matter and in the space  between this last and the first coloured layer the delicate fibres of  the nerve of sight or optic nerve  run These fibres then converge  together at the back of the eye  Magnified seMon of part a single large nerve which is  connected with the insects brain and conveys  the impression of sight to that organ  Perhaps this account may be followed with some  difficulty let us therefore take a single facet and  trace it to its termination Each facet being in  fact a distinct eye we shall be able in so doing  to get a clear comprehension of the whole organ  which is after all only made up of a large number  of these distinct eyes Separating then one facet  from the rest we find this single eye to consist of  several portions 1 the sixsided facet 2 the  coneshaped cylinder clear and transparent 3 a  delicate fibre of nerve connected with the bottom  of this cone and 4 the large nerve itself The  diagram on the next page will make this perfectly  intelligible  But it may be asked What of the colouring  matter It exists in three places 1 The first  layer surrounds the cones 2 and separates them  from one another and from the nerve below  in part 2 The second layer surrounds the  nerve fibres 3 And 3 the last layer is at the  junction of the nerve fibre 3 with the nerve  itself 4  This apparently complicated mechanism well  deserves the readers attention nor should the  subject be quitted until it is clearly understood  We are unable to enter into further particulars  upon the structure and functions of this beautiful  apparatus but it must be added that  the following is the manner in which   the ray of light becomes perceived by  the insect It first passes through the  facet a next enters the cone b then  strikes upon the nerve c which conveys the impression taking the large  nerve d to the brain The colouring layers are intended to prevent any rays  of light from passing to other parts of the insects eye and so confusing the  impressions made upon its senses by  magnified external objects  The number of these facets or if we choose to  call them so distinct eyes varies in different  insects In some there are comparatively few in  others an amazing multitude The following list  of their number is given by Muller as observed  by various entomologists  In the Ant there are 50   Convolvulus Sphinx 1300   Common Housefly 4000   Silkworm Moth6236   Goat Moth11300  In the Dragonfly12544   Butterfly17355   Mordella 25088  According to the calculations of another author  there cannot be fewer than 34650 in the com¬  pound eye of a butterfly Amazing thought each  of this immense host is considered to be a separate  eye receives separate impressions of light and has  a separate structure and organization both perfect  in their kind  It is not difficult to remove the compound eye  of an insect and in so doing it will be found that  each lens is as clear as crystal The ingenious  Reaumur actually succeeded in removing one  and adjusting it to a lens and he found that  he could see through the insects eye very distinctly only he says the surrounding objects  appeared to be greatly multiplied There is a  common optical toy which is ground into a number  of facets which communicates this appearance to  objects when seen through it and thus furnishes  us with a good illustration of the endless confusion  of images which would have perplexed the insect  had not the various beautiful contrivances of which  we have spoken been adjusted to prevent it  But we must guard against a very natural mis¬  take which might arise upon the subject of the  eyes of insects from supposing them in any degree  comparable to those of higher animals as regards  their motions When man or an animal wishes  to look at any object they do so by causing  several muscles to be brought into action which  move the eyes round so as to receive the rays of  light from the particular point where this object  is placed and so admirably arranged is the  mechanism by which these movements are effected  that they are as well provided for all the purposes  of sight with two eyes as with twenty In insects  no such apparatus exists the eyes are quite immovable they are in fact set in the head like a  gem in a ladys ring and are altogether removed  from the control of the insect In order to obviate  the annoyance and inconvenience which would  result from this arrangement their eyes are  formed on the wonderful principles already mentioned and instead of insects being furnished with  two eyes they are provided with many thousands  They are thus enabled to enjoy not only the same  extent and range of vision with ourselves but even  a much larger  Insects are also furnished with a contrivance by  which they can see objects at a little distance and  objects at a great distanceit may be at the same  time which is more than can be strictly said of  ourselves In men and animals there is a very  exquisite apparatus arranged within the eye by  means of which it can accommodate itself to  objects close at hand or again to others at the  greatest distance We can see at one moment a  pin at our feet and at the next the summit of a  hill some thirty or forty miles off Now the laws  of light are such that to effect this properly we  must have some apparatus in the eye to arrange  its focal capacity so as to receive and concentrate  the lines of light proceeding from such different  points as the distance of a few inches and that  of many miles What this apparatus may be is  not as yet very satisfactorily determined But in  insects the same result is obtained by a very  curious provision Some of their eyes are short¬  sighted and some longsighted The simple eyes  are supposed by Professor Muller to be the  shortsighted eyes and the compound eyes the  lonosighted ones  The number of compound eyes in insects does  not often exceed two these being made up it will  not be forgotten by multitudes of single eyes  But in a few whose habits require that they  should be endowed with extraordinary means of  vision there are as many as four If the reader  would betake him to the brookside and creep  noiselessly along its margin some summer after¬  noon until he comes to a quiet glassy pool where  the water seems to have forgotten itself and fallen  asleep so still so silent and so smooth does it lie  reflecting all the lustre of the deepblue sky over¬  head he will surprise a dancing party of insects  busy waltzing at a wonderful rate now skimming  hither now shooting across the glassy pavement  on which they sport now joining together and  wheeling round and round and again as the king¬  fisher comes fluttering down the river as thousji  on some errand of immense importance breaking  up their party and flying into a thousand holes  and corners to wait until all is quiet Let him  exercise his activity and patience and catch one  of these giddy insects which are known to ento¬  mologists by the name of the Gyrinus Natator  and he will have a good example of an insect  provided with four compound eyes so that it can  see not only before and behind but upward into  the sky and downward into the clear cool waters  on whose surface its happy life is spent Some  insects like Cyclops of old are furnished only  with one eye and some it is said are quite blind  creatures that never feel the blessed influences  of the pleasant sunlight Like the simple eyes  the compound eyes are sometimes fixed on the end  of a little footstalk so as to give the insect some¬  what the appearance of being furnished with a  pair of opera glasses or short telescopes  In order to ascertain by what means the bee  found its way to the hive whether by seeing it  through its compound eyes or otherwise Reaumur  performed an interesting experiment similar in  character to the one before mentioned He  covered with a red varnish which was quite  opaque the compound eyes of a number of bees  taken from the same hive He then shut them up  in a box with several other bees from the same  hive which he left untouched The box was only  a few paces distant from the hive from which the  bees were taken He then opened the lid of the box  and those which had not been blinded instantly  flew out of it and entered their habitation Those  whose eyes had been varnished appeared not to  care to leave the box at all and seemed very un¬  willing to make any attempt to fly some of them  indeed flew about from one side to another but  did not go far Reaumur then threw several of  them up into the air and they immediately began  to soar higher and higher until at length they  went out of sight altogether Reaumur compares  the poor insects manoeuvres to those of a crow  whose head and eyes mischievous boys have  covered with a paper bonnet the bird flies upward  until its strength is exhausted when it drops again  to the earth Not only did those bees which he  threw up into the air thus soar until they were  lost to view but all the most active of those which  were left in the box did so likewise and Reaumur  saw them no more Not one could find its way  to the hive From this experiment and from the  preceding one it is evident that both the com¬  pound and the simple eyes are necessary to enable  the insect to see perfectly for when either was  varnished over the bees could not find their way  to their home again Reaumur imagines that the  cause of the wheeling flight of bees sometimes  observed now in this direction now in the opposite may arise from their eyes becoming perhaps  in part obscured by the pollen or yellow powder  of the flowers into which they plunge the bee  thereby becoming partly blindfolded These  experiments are so interesting that they deserve  repeating and it might be tried whether the result  would be different if only one eye were blinded  Other variations of the experiments will also  suggest themselves  Although not organs of sufficient size to give  their colouring the requisite distinctness and  amount of surface which would render it very  conspicuous in our estimation the eyes of insects  are often exquisitely beautiful and vie almost with  precious stones in lustre Their most common  colour is black or brown but the eyes of many  flies glow with fiery colours some banded with  green and purple some variously figured black  and red Some again glitter like burnished gold  shaded with the softest green and some blaze  with a play of colours like the diamond set in jet  The eye of the dragonfly in particular is a lustrous crystalline object of extreme beauty  We have dwelt as long as our limits will permit  on this wonderful apparatus of vision in insects  let us now turn our thoughts for a little space to  a pair of organs which are perhaps of all others  the most characteristic of the insect tribes these  are the Antenna We need scarcely explain  what these are or point them out to the reader  since they are so familiar to most persons but  under the erroneous or at any rate the questionable expressionthe feelers We have an excellent specimen of antenna in those of the  butterflies in which insects they are very long  and elegant organs They are attached to the  head by means of a beautiful joint called a ball  and socket the same as is often adapted to  garden watering enginepipes so as to enable them  to be moved about in all directions They are  never found absent in the perfect insect and are  manifestly organs of considerable importance in  the insect economy As to their structurewhen  examined under a microscope antennae are found  to be composed of a variable number of small  round pieces covered with a horny or leathery  skin but within being softer and hollow so as to  form a series of tubes placed end to end all connected together in such a manner as to admit of  free movement between each joint so that the  insect can bend them into any shape it may find  expedient for its purposes But it must not be  supposed that all antenna are similar in form  or there would be a risk of their being continually mistaken by the reader for some other  organ The cut on the next page will at a glance  exhibit the astonishing variety of form assumed  by these organs The common cockchafer is possessed of antennas as strikingly different in form  from those of the butterfly as if they were really  distinct organs intended and adapted to serve different purposes Some are long and threadlike some  resemble a necklace of pearls some are notched  like a saw some have a resemblance to a fan some  are like a club some resemble a fork and some a  feather in short their variety of form is almost  endless and they differ as much in length and in  thickness for while the antenna of some insects  are as long as or even longer than their bodies  those of others are  very short and little prominent and  while some are as  thin and fine as the  finest hair others  are nearly as thick  as the true body of  the insect Let us  now ask what is the  use of these singular  organs of the insect  From a hint which has before been dropped it  is probable that the answer to this question will  be readily anticipated Various facts appear to  show that they may be the insects ears Can  it be that such is their function some may exclaim calling to mind that ears in other creatures  are so different in appearance and structure from  these organs There have been many opinions on  the subject and some have maintained views completely opposed to this idea But the greater  number of entomologists seem to consider this as  their most probable function If they are not  ears we are not able to point to any other organs  in the head which are From a number of facts  it is certain that insects can hear from which it  is equally certain that they must possess special  organs We may therefore until the contrary is  shown with respect to them fairly be allowed to  consider the antennae as these organs The opinions  of Messrs Kirby and Spence on this point are conveyed in the following words They conceive  that antennse by a peculiar structure may collect  notices from the atmosphere receive touches or  vibrations and communicate them to the sensorium  or brain which though not precisely to be called  hearing may answer the same purpose The latti  celebrated DrW F Erichson of Berlin by means  of the microscope has discovered in all insects  and especially in those most remarkable for their  powers of smelling that these organs are furnished with a number of fine pores clothed with  membrane which he regards as organs of smell Every one has heard of M Pelisson the prioner at the Bastile and his spider companions  of the cell This gentleman had by patient  training engaged the attention of a spider which  used every day to come and listen to a solo on his  violin after which it would make its retreat again  to its home Now it is clear that this little insect  not only heard but even enjoyed the notes of his  instrument which would have been impossible  had it possessed no ears Then again every one  must have noticed the start which a fly will make  if some sharp noise be made near it and how  actively it will move its legs and seem to be put  all on the qui mve A little everyday observation will furnish us with many similar instances   A little moth writes one of the lastmentioned  authors was reposing on my window I made  a quiet not loud but distinct noise the antenna  nearest to me immediately moved towards me  I repeated the noise at least a dozen times and  it was followed every time by the same motion  of that organ till at length the insect being  alarmed became more agitated and violent in its  motions In this instance it could not be touch  since the antenna was not applied to a surface  but directed towards the quarter from which the  sound came as if to listen Can we question that  the merry grasshopper chirping all day in the  field is heard by its mate or that the cricket  on the hearth sings for its fellows or only to  please our ears or does the tap of the deathtick  beetle formerly commemorated draw forth no  answering tap from its companion on the other side  of the post All these instances and countless  more that might be mentioned indicate beyond  a question that insects have the faculty of hearing  and render it extremely probable that the antenna  are the organs by which this function is performed  But it is probable that they serve another and  not less important purpose The country folk  who are generally very weatherwise and whose  sayings always deserve a great deal of attention because they are very commonly founded  both upon observation of facts and experience  will always assure us that the high flight of  swallows in their search after insects is a certain  token of fair weather their low flight of approaching wet Why is this Can insects  foretell the state of the weather and if so by  what means That insects have a meteorometrical power of foretelling the state of the weather  appears beyond a doubt To select a few in  stances Bees our exemplars in so many points  might be consulted with advantage and would  often give us better information as to whether  an overcoat or an umbrella would be probably  required than the not always trustworthy barometer When engaged in their daily labours  if a change of weather to rain is at hand although  the sun may yet shine and the sky remain clear  and calm they foresee it and return suddenly  to their hives Hence in weather of an unsettled  description they never undertake journeys far  from home but make short excursions to and from  their hives beins never absent lonr at a time  and if we find a bee wandering far from its hive  it may be taken on the other hand as a pretty  sure prognostic that topcoat and umbrella may  be left at home for that day at least Ants  as we have already noticed possess the same  faculty of weatherwisdom never allowing their  larvae to be caught in a shower The abundance  of insects in our houses in wet weather is a familiar  observation we are assured that in hot countries  their excessive numbers during the rainy season  make these little creatures almost as terrible  as a plague to all who are withinclimbing up  the walls scrambling into the dishes drowning  themselves in the souptureens or putting out  the lights with their bodies In hot and sultry  weather when a black cloud or two in the far  horizon give token of a coming storm insects  abound in the air but as the heavens grow black  they disappear and before a drop of rain has  actually fallen we may look in vain for them  That the antennas are the organs by which this  knowledge of coming events with regard to the  weather is obtained by the insects appears probable They may perhaps perceive by their  delicate surfaces changes in the electrical condition of the air which are quite insensible to  ourselves and as all change of weather is pre¬  ceded and accompanied by changes of electrical  balance of one kind or another in the air they  may be thus forewarned of the coming danger  The following is the manoeuvre of a large number  of insects of the beetle tribe When they are  about to move from any station where they have  been at rest the first thing they usually do  before they move a step is to bring forward and  expand their antennae which have previously been  folded up out of the way They open them as  widely as possible so as to expose them to all  the influences of the air and then if they be  satisfied they unfold their wings and take their  flight We might compare this proceeding with  that of one of ourselves looking lip at the direction of the wind or tapping the weatherglass in  the hall previous to setting out for the day Too  much stress however it must be added is not to  be laid upon this point for while it is unquestionable that insects have knowledge of the weather  it is of course very difficult to ascertain with  certainty whether it is by means of their antenme  or by the general feeling of their bodies analogous perhaps to what rheumatic persons feel  when the wind goes round to the northeast  There is a still more singular use of the antennae  which deserves to be mentioned These organs appear to be the principal instruments of speech if we  may use such a term or at any rate of the communication of intelligence When the soldier ants  go out upon their expeditions and have left the  nest previously to setting off they touch each  other with their antennas and forehead on the  trunk and this is their signal for marching for as  soon as ever a soldier feels this tap he immediately  puts himself in motion When also they have  any discovery to communicate they strike with  them those that they meet in a particularly impressive manner and if a hungry ant wants to be  fed it touches with its two antennas moving them  very rapidly those of the individual from which it  expects its meal They appear to salute one another  by gently tapping each others antennae as we  should shake hands on meeting an old friend  M Huber has related an account of some  interesting experiments of his on a hive of bees  which strikingly proves that the antennas are  really organs for the transmission of intelligence  He wished to ascertain whether when they had  lost a queen they discovered the sad event by  their smell their touch or any unknown cause for  such a loss in the course of a single hour is made  known in some way or other to the whole hive  In order to ascertain this he first divided a hive  by a grate which kept the two portions a few  parts of an inch separated from each other so  that the bees could not come at each other  although any scent could easily have passed In  that part in which there was no queen the bees  were soon in great agitation and as they did not  discover where she was confined in a short time  they began to construct royal cells after which  they grew more calm Mr Huber next separated  them by a partition through which they could  pass their antennas but not their heads In this  case the bees all remained tranquil neither intermitting the care of the brood nor abandoning  their other employments nor did they begin any  royal cell The means they adopted to assure  themselves that their queen was safe and to communicate with her was to pass their antennas  through the openings of the grate A most  curious spectacle thus presented itself an infinite  number of those organs misdit be seen at once as it  were inquiring in all directions and the queen was  observed answering these anxious inquiries of her  dutiful subjects in the most marked manner for  she was always fastened by her feet to the grate  crossing her antennas with those of the inquirers  While we have been anxious to show that the  function of feeling is not the important and  principal office of these singular organs it would  be far from correct to state that the antennae are  not occasionally employed to use the popular term  as feelers All who have paid any attention  to the motions of insects must lmve seen the  antennae actually employed as it were in exploring  the number or nature of objects immediately  around From these and the preceding remarks  it becomes manifest that next to the organs  of sight the antennae are most important and  useful appendages to the body of the insect  When we consider the various purposes they  serve we become much perplexed to understand  how it is possible for one organ to fulfil such  varied duties nor can it be explained We are  unable to conceive of the senses of insects except  by comparing them with our own and in our  case there are no organs which can receive  and at the same time communicate intelligence  Our ears eyes nose and the other organs of the  senses have only one function severally assigned  to them and had they more there would probably be no little confusion in our perceptions of  external things Such confusion does not probably  exist in the insect but it is very possible that its  perceptions are somewhat different from ours  Before we leave the region of the head we have  the important task to fulfil of describing the  mouth of the insect this part is more complicated  than the organs we have as yet seen and requires  therefore a considerable degree of our careful  attention to enable us to do justice to it and to  carry in the mind a clear view of this interesting  portion of an insects structure If writes Mr  Westwood a beetle and a butterfly a house¬  fly or an aphis be examined whilst feeding a  totally different apparatus will be found in each  although perfectly adapted for the mode of feed¬  ing The beetle is employed in gnawing and  tearing in pieces hard or fleshy substances its  instruments of manducation are therefore horny  and robust The butterfly on the contrary has to  seek its food at the bottom of the tubes of flowers  and here in the glowing beams of the sun it revels  in its existence and sips the most delicious nectar  It is necessary for this purpose that it should be  provided with a long and slender instrument but  from the very structure of this apparatus it is  essential for its defence that so soon as the insect  has ceased feeding the instrument should be  lodged in a place of safety It is therefore rolled  up in a beautiful spiral direction and laid to rest  between a pair of hairy appendages which will  defend it from injury If we observe a common  fly sipping up a drop of spilt wine or revelling  upon a morsel of sugar it will be found that its  mouth is totally unlike either of the former it  is short thick and fleshy and acts as a sucker  the nutriment ascending through the canal which  runs upward into the throat The aphides and  all their brethren have a mouth differently constructed being a long and slender pointed canal  of a fleshy or leathery substance but furnished  internally with several slender bristles which the  insect employs as lancets to wound its prey In  the flea again the structure is quite different  To the variations in  the mouth of each of  these insects it has been  thought good to attach a  distinct name When for  example we speak of a 0 the HoneyBee  bees proboscis we speak actually of its mouth  The mouth of the butterfly is called  by most entomologists antlia that  of the aphis a promuscis that of  the flea a rostrulumc But the reader  must not allow himself to be confused by these  terms they all are but names for modifications of  the same partthe mouth When the butterfly  plunges its long tube into the flowerwhen the fly  intoxicates itself with a drop of syrup using its  proboscis to pump it upand when the flea thrusts  its rostrulum into our flesh and quaffs our life¬  blood as though it were nectarlet us not forget  the mouth is the organ employed in each of these  cases varied and altered in form though it certainly be  In all cases the various parts of the mouth may  be reduced to six the names of which deserve  remembering and this will be rendered easier by  the accompanying diagram in which they are  all separated and lettered so as to distinguish  each part these six parts consist of four side  pieces and two other organs one above the other  below The name of the upper organ is the upper  Up or in Latin labrum that of the opposite  lower one is the lower lip or labium The upper  pair of sidepieces are called the mandibles or  upper jaws the pair below are the lower jaws  or maxillce  Let us now briefly mention the use of these  various parts of the insects mouth beginning  with the upper lip a or labrum Unlike that  organ in ourselves the insects upper lip is gene¬  rally in such insects as bite their food a plate of  horny substance which serves the purpose of  an upper covering to the rest of the mouth Like  our own upper lips however that is to say like  those of men at least it is fringed with a sort of  moustache in most cases  The mandibles b or upper jaws in the biting  insects are instruments for cutting the food  in pieces When we bite our food the movement of our jaw is upwards and downwards but  in the insect it is like that of a pair of scissors or  from side to side These jaws are sometimes  frightfullooking instruments resembling in the  stagbeetle horns and their power is proportionally great Although their general use is to masticate or crush the food for the insect this apparatus  is often employed as a formidable weapon of  defence or offence and very frequently in the  excavation of a nest or retreat for the insect  They are sometimes so constructed as to look as  if they were furnished with several teeth  The maxilla or lower jaws are less firm and  strong than the preceding but they are more  complicated in their structure and have attached  to their sides remarkably delicate little processes  like the antennas which are called the palpi or  less properly feelers The lower jaws are much  varied in structure in different insects as may  well be imagined when it is mentioned that the  long and beautiful spiral tube of the butterfly  by which it drains the juices of the flower is in  reality composed of the maxillae or lower jaws  In ordinary cases the principal use of the lower  jaws appears to be to hold the food while the upper  jaws bruise and crush it but their use of course  varies with their structure and modifications  The last part of the mouth is the labium or lower  lip This also is a very complicated organ gene¬  rally serving to close the mouth from beneath like  the upper from above It boasts like the same  organ in higher animals of a chin below it called  the mentum and on each side of it are a pair of  feelers or palpi like those of the maxilla In the  centre a little tonguelike projection is visible in  the figure which is sometimes called the tongue  but perhaps not correctly if by that term is meant  the apparatus for tasting The lower lip is as  much varied as the maxilla  It would be impossible without going too far  into minute technical details to explain to the  reader how all these various parts of the mouth  are so modified and altered as to assume the very  different appearances presented to us in the insects  already mentioned This pleasure must be re¬  served for the time when well acquainted with the  generalities of insect history which alone form  the scope and subject of this little work he feels  anxious to study entomology as a science and he  will find a number of excellent books which will  then well repay his attentive perusal and satisfactorily answer all his inquiries on this and other  difficult topics connected with this science  It cannot fail to be noticed that in this description of the insects mouth no mention has been  made of its organs of taste Its eye and probably  ears and means of touch have all come before us  but where it will be asked is its tongue The  little organ mentioned as a part of the insects  lower lip although strikingly resembling a tongue  in some instances is in others very different from  it and appears in such cases to be quite unfitted  to act as the organ of taste We must therefore  suppose that other parts of the lower lip or mouth  have the same faculty in addition to the socalled  tongue It is very certain that insects have the  faculty of tasting and also of discriminating between their food as few will be disposed to  question who will place a plate of salt and a plate  filled with moist sugar in a sunny window on a  fine day it will soon become evident which will  be favoured with the attention of the flies  Neither has any mention been made of a nose  A common fleshfly however will soon satisfy  us that it is not devoid of some organ or other  which answers this purpose If we cover a piece  of meat under a cloth or put it into a wire  safe where it is certain that the fly cannot see  it it will scent it out as readily or even more  so than a cat or a dog would Sometimes this  insects nose proves a treacherous guide for  a plant has been described called the carrion  flower which diffuses an odour like that of putrid  meat which attracts the fly and induces it to  deposit its eggs thereon under the idea that its  future young will thus be hatched upon a certain  source of food but in vain for they perish almost  as soon as born finding nothing in the plant  whereon to existf But as to the precise seat of the   If we refuse to adopt Dr Ericlisons view of the use of the  antennas  f This plant is a native of South Africa and a fine specimen  of it exists in the conservatories at Kew Its botanical name is  Stapelia  organ of this sense opinions are greatly at variance Some believe it to exist in the spiracles  some in the mouth and some in a special organ  which they call the nose but which does not seem  in reality to fulfil that office at any rate in the  generality of cases M Huber showed the existence of this faculty to lie somewhere about the  mouth by some interesting experiments upon  bees He presented successively to all parts of a  bees body a camelhair pencil dipped in oil of  turpentine to which most insects are extremely  averse but the bee took no notice of it He then  took a very fine hair pencil while the bee had  extended its proboscis and presented it to its eyes  and antennae without effect but when he pointed  it near the cavity of the mouth above the insertion of the proboscis the creature started back in  an instant quitted its food clapped its wings and  walked about in great agitation and would have  taken flight if the pencil had not been removed  On this it began to eat again but on the experiment being repeated it showed signs of similar  discomposure oil of marjoram produced the same  effect and more promptly and entirely He then  seized several bees forced them to unfold their  probosces and stopped their mouths with paste  When this was sufficiently dry to prevent their  getting rid of it lie restored them to their liberty  they appeared by no means incommoded at being  thus gagged but moved about and breathed  as readily as their companions Huber then  tempted them with honey and presented to them  near the mouth oil of turpentine and other odours  that they usually have an aversion to but all  produced no sensible effect upon them and they  even walked upon pencils saturated with them  Leaving now the head of the insect it is necessary for us to make some mention of the parts  attached to the thorax or trunk In the head  division we have seen that the various organs of  the senses are situated we shall now find that in  the thorax division are placed the organs by  which the insect is either wafted in rapid evolutions to the highest air or runs with incredible  rapidity along the surface of the earth We  have already described on a previous page the  general structure of an insects wing It remains  therefore for us here to advert to a few other facts  in connexion with these elegant appendages  The natural number of wings in the insect  world is four arranged in two pairs But this  number is obscured by the modifications to which  in many instances one or other of the pairs  becomes subject and we should if this were not  remembered become somewhat confused at taking 1  up the first insect that came in our way which  would probably be the common fly and finding  that we could only  recognise two  large wings in¬  stead of four In  this tribe of insects  the hinder pair of  wings is reduced  to a pair of slender  knobbed filaments  The House Fly Natural size and magnified  Some insects are without wings at all The ant the  bee the dragonfly the housefly and many other  insects are furnished with wings of gauzelike transparency and structure often crossed in a curious  manner by the nervures of which we before had  occasion to speak These wings are called membranaceous In the moth and butterfly tribes the  wings are covered with what appears to be a delicate beautiful powder but is in reality a multitude of exquisite scales of the singular forms  represented The engraving shows the shape  of the scales on the wings of these insects on  examination with a  good lens it appears that the long  and hairlike scales  are planted at the  margin of the wings  and contribute to  give to the edges  that beautiful feathery look which is so much  admired while the short scales were placed principally on the middle portion of the wings their  numbers are almost infinite If a butterfly is  allowed to flutter awhile in a box it will cover  every portion of its surface with them and yet  on being permitted to fly out we may scarcely  perceive that it has lost any of its fairy plumes  Whether Leuwenhoek actually took the trouble  to count so many or arrived at the result from  calculation after counting those on a given space  we do not know but he declares that he found  more than four hundred thousand on the wings  of the silkworm moth and in those of larger  moths and butterflies the number must greatly  exceed this They are generally arranged like  the tiles on a houseroof and if they are scraped  off the minute dots where each was attached  becomes distinctly visible The term used to indicate the tribe of insects to which the moth and  butterfly appertain is as has been before remarked Lepidoptera or scalewinged from this  very fact Some membranaceous wings are clothed  If we take up a beetle  and look for its wings for  the first time we shall  probably fail in detecting  them that is of course if  the insect has not been ob¬  served in the act of flying  On examining the body  we see indeed a pair of  shining horny plates on  its back but surely these are not wings Presently the insect having mounted to the top of  our finger prepares for flight its two hard cases  fly up and behold from beneath them appears  a pair of the most beautiful gauzelike wings  which it quickly unfolds puts into motion and  then flies away The two thick and horny covers  for these delicate organs are called elytra or   wingcases They are really the first pair  of wings much thickened and their use is to  protect the delicate membranous wings of the  hinder pair beneath them When the insect  Hies they open like a boxlid and are carried out  of the way of the other wings when the insect  rests it carefully folds up its other wings and then  these close over them and preserve them from all  injury As the insects in which they are found  frequent places of danger burrow underground  or take up their abode under stones it is manifest  how admirable a contrivance this is for such purposes and how efficiently the fragile wings will  be covered and protected by such shields The  first pair of wings is sometimes thickened to the  consistence of parchment as a cover to the other  wings and they are then called tegmina or   winocovers  There are two other circumstances in connexion  with this part of our subject which deserve  noticing If the reader will take into his hand  a large blowfly and carefully examine its body  with a lens near the spot where the wings are connected to it he will succeed in discovering two  organs of a curious kind One of these is a small  membranous piece connected with the trunkend  of the wings and is generally called the icinglet  or alula The other looks like a little drum¬  stick hanging down and is called the balancer or  poiser or in Latin the halter or bridle It is not  clear of what use either of these organs is Since  the winglets are the largest in the heaviest bodies  and are altogether wanting in the lightest it  appears probable that one of their principal uses  is to assist the wings during flight If one might  hazard the conjecture perhaps they act like the  parachute of a balloon As to the socalled  balancers it has been considered that they serve to  poise the insect while flying Dr Derham considered that they kept the body steady during flight  and he states that if either a poiser or a winglet is  cut off it will fly awkwardly and unsteadily as if  it had lost some very necessary part Another  observer states that he cut off the winglets of a fly  leaving both its wings and poisers but it could  no longer fly He also cut off in another fly the  poisers alone and the same result took place On  cutting off both the poisers of a cranefly he says  it was unable either to fly or walk Mr West  wood says he has seen the poisers beat rapidly  upon the winglets like drumsticks on a drum and  it has been supposed that this action is the cause  of the hum made by the insect in flying This is  doubtful because it has been found that after the  winglets are cut away the humming sound is still  produced and some humming insects have no  winglets  So much importance did Linnaeus the great  father of natural history attach to the character  of the wings in insects that he arranged the  various families of insects under several heads  expressive of the leading character of their wings  The orders into which he thus divided insects are  seven in number 1 Coleoptera or casewinged  2 Hemiptera or halfwinged 3 Lepidopterct  or scalewinged 4  Nenroptera or nerve¬  winged 5 Hipnenop  tera or membrane  winged 6 Diptera  twowinged and 7  Aptera or wing  less the Greek word  pteron signifying a  wing furnishes the  termination to each  of these titles the  prefix is also derived  from the Greek and  its import may be de¬  rived from the trans  lation attached to each This s 7 stem has been  extended by modern entomologists who have sub¬  divided the 2d 5th and 7th orders into additional  ones  In the opposite cut the insects represented illus¬  trate each of the Linnean orders They are  1 a Beetle 2 an Aphis 3 a Butterfly 4 a Bee  5 a Dragonfly 6 a Housefly and 7 a Spider  As these organs exhibit to us in the most  conspicuous manner the exquisite beauties where¬  with it has pleased God the Almighty Creator  to adorn the insect world we may be allowed to  make some reference to the colours of the wings  before proceeding to speak of those organs by  which the insect moves on earth Some of the  beetle tribe are like tiny masses of burnished  metal gleaming with colours of the most exquisite  description A vast number of locusts are re¬  markable for the splendour of their wings Many  dragonflies are adorned with wings vying with  those of the butterfly in loveliness The wings of  many flies are exquisitely painted with the most  brilliant metallic hues green and gold and even  those of a housefly are often very beautiful by  their having the property of iridescence or reflecting the prismatic colours of light But insects of  every tribe however splendid in attire fade before the glories of the butterfly tribe Linnaeus  speaking of the splendid colours of these insects  and particularly of the gorgeous tints which  appear on the upper surface of the wings of a  butterfly called the MorphoMenelaus and another  justly observes that there is scarcely anything in  nature that for brightness and splendour can be  paralleled with this colour It is a kind of rich  ultramarine that vies with the deepest and purest  azure of the sky and what must cause a striking  contrast in flight the prone surface of the wings  is as dull and dark as the opposite is brilliant so  that one can conceive this insect to ajipear like a  planet in full radiance and under eclipse as its  wings open and shut in the blaze of a tropical sun  The scales on the wings of some species shine  with such extraordinary intenseness and brilliancy  that it is impossible to look at them in a bright  light as they completely dazzle the beholder  Messrs Kirby and Spence say they know no  insect upon which the sight rests with such untired pleasure as upon the lovely butterfly that  bears the name of the unhappy Trojan king  Papilio Priamus the contrast of the rich green  and black of the velvet of its wings with each  other and with the black of its abdomen is  beyond expression regal and magnificent What  adds to the beauty of the wings of this tribe  of insects is the appearance of the beautiful spots  like eyes which are so familiar to us and which  are almost without a parallel except in the animal  world This ornament gives to the wings of a  butterfly an indescribable life and beauty and  constrains us as we contemplate it to acknowledge  that c Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed  like one of these 7 The astonishing variety of  combination in the colours communicates an inexpressible charm to these insect glories here is a  lustrous blue a glowing orange a delicate lemon  an exquisite pink a fiery copper or a spotless  white None but a Divine hand could have produced such effects as are exhibited in these most  gorgeously painted organs No work of man will  endure comparison with them The most elaborately finished miniature upon which the artist  may in the features and dress of the person have  expended all the resources of his art in the production of harmonious and pleasing tones of colour  appears but as a muddy lustreless patch when  placed side by side with one of the butterflybeauties  of the tropics or even of our own green fields  We must not however allow the fascination of  these beautiful objects to engross our whole attention and it is now time for us to state some  particulars connected with the legs of the imago  or perfect insect Six is the true number of legs  which belong to the insect in the imago state  They are connected to its body at the thorax and  are formed of a series of minute tubes provided  internally with muscles and nerves They are  commonly divided into four parts a the haunch  b the thigh c the tibia and d e the foot  The front pair of legs or as they are generally  called the forelegs are considered by some authors  to be really the insects arms the last portion of  them being the hand Certainly they are often  as useful to the insect as is this admirable oroan  to ourselves not only are they serviceable in  walking but they also enable the insect to climb  to lay hold of various objects or to catch their  prey to dig in the earth and in many instances to  clean the head and face of the creature an operation in which many of them and particularly hies  and bees among our domestic insects are most  praiseworthily particular having apparently an  aversion to nothing so much as to a dirty face and  unbrushed jacket The other pairs of legs are altered  in various manners in order to fit them for the  different purposes for which they are required by  the insect  The purposes for which the legs are put into  requisition are as will be easily guessed for walk¬  ing or running for jumping for climbing and for  swimming Most surprising in all these respects  is the degree of agility and swiftness with which  it has pleased the Divine Creator to endow these  insectorgans M Delisle once observed a fly  only as large as a grain of sand which ran three  inches in half a second and in that space made the  enormous number of fire hundred and forty steps  If a man were to be able to walk as fast in pro¬  portion to his size supposing his step to measure  two feet he would in the course of a minute  have run upwards of twenty miles a task far surpassing our express railroad engines or the famous  Seven League Boots recorded in the nursery  fable In leaping also insects far excel man  or any other animal whatever The flea can leap  two hundred times its own length so also can  the locust If a man were six feet long and could  leap as high and as far as one of these insects he  might stand near Bow Church in Cheapside leap  up into the air over the top of St Pauls cross  and alight at the bottom of Ludgate Hill which  would be something more wonderful than it has  ever entered into the minds of the writers of fairy  tales to conceive of The insect called the fros  hopper can leap more than two hundred and  fifty times its own length Some spiders can leap  a couple of feet upon their prey The legs of  insects that swim are generally peculiarly fitted  for it either by their being expanded somewhat  like an oar or by having a dense fringe of hairs  upon them The waterbeetles after rising to  the surface of the stream for a supply of fresh air  dive down to their watery home again taking a  clear silvery bubble along with them and in this  action they move with considerable rapidity their swimming legs which are clothed  with hairs The water boatman  swims upon his back by means  of his singularly formed legs  The little whirlgig of which  we have before spoken swims  by means of its legs which are paddleshaped By  means it may be of some peculiar secretion which  repels the water some insects can actually walk  upon its surface and that as readily or more so than  upon land Those who know the pleasures of  shooting with polished skates over clear ice when  it almost seems as if we were moving in the air  and no more condemned to earth can imagine  something of the delight these insects must experience who can glide as swift as thought over the  glassy surface of the brook Sometimes the shape  of the hindlegs is remarkably altered and per  haps the most extraordinary instance of this in  the whole insect world is the foreign insect  which has been called the Kangaroo beetle  The cut represents  faithfully this most  wonderful creature and we could  almost fancy as  we looked at it  that by some accident the front   pair of legs and the head had been twisted round leaving the  hind legs and part of the body turned in the opposite direction It need scarcely be added that  the origin of this insects curious title was derived  from the resemblance borne by its hind legs to  those of the animal whose name it bears In  some insects the legs fold upon each other and are  packed into a very small compass this is particularly the case in a species of woodlouse which  roll themselves up into balls precisely resembling  beads or pills as may be imagined from the following anecdote A servant maid of the great  Swammerdam while walking in the garden one  clay found a large number of round black shining  beads which were streaked with white bands and  presented a very pretty and attractive appearance  Gathering a number of these in her hand she  thought she would convert them into a necklace  or for ought we know into a rosary when to her  great surprise the beads became animated as soon  as ever they felt the point of the needle with  which she was about to thread them and began to  struggle actively to get away not however too  quickly for her for with a violent scream imagining the beads were bewitched she ran into the  house Some of the beetle tribe thus fold up  their legs and roll themselves up so as to resemble  little globular pebbles  The Abdomen is then the only remaining portion of the insect which eve have now to notice  It has no legs attached to it and contains the in¬testines and other portions of the insects internal  anatomy It is formed of a varying number of  rings which are easily distinguishable in the wasp  and many other insects and these rings are connected together by delicate folds of membrane  fitting sometimes into each other like the tubes of  a telescope in other instances fastened together  like so many hoops by their edges In consequence of this mode of structure it is often very  movable and may even be bent into a half curve  in various directions at the pleasure of the insect  The common earwig is particularly gifted with  this movableness of its abdomen and so are many  insects which carry weapons of offence or defence  in their tails These organs or appendages are  deserving of a brief notice although it is probable  that the structure of some of them is already familiar to most readers  The sting of the bee is perhaps as formidable a  weapon as any of those attached to the abdomen  in insects under the microscope the structure of  this apparatus appears in all its beauty It is  found to consist of a sort of sheath or scabbard  which is composed of two pieces and is of extreme  fineness as will be readily made visible by placing  a fine sewing needle by its side when the latter  will more resemble a bar of iron from the smiths  forge or a kitchen poker than anything else while  the former will under the strongest magnifying  power exhibit a smoothness elegance and polish  of the most beautiful description When the bee  thrusts forth its sting it is the sheath which we  generally see and not the more delicate apparatus  which is enclosed within it Inside this scabbard  is a pair of most fine darts which are even more  delicate than the human hair and are therefore  invisible to the eye unassisted by a good lens  These darts are notched like very fine saws at the  end the teeth being so directed as to oppose the  retraction of the instrument if it is thrust into the  human skin the sting being therefore left in the  wound and the wounded person having the com¬  fort of knowingif we should call it a comfort  that the insect will surely die speedily in consequence of its attack upon him An exquisite  adaptation of fine muscles is attached to this  weapon by which it is forcibly driven home  The venom which produces the pain and inflammation is contained in a small muscular bag in  connexion with the sting and when the latter is  thrust out the poison is also forced out and flows  into the wound The sting of the scorpion is a  less complicated but more dangerous weapon  though not often fatal The earwig though un¬  provided with a sting carries a most awfullooking  forceps in its tail which it can put in action with  great force on occasion of danger and since it can  twist its abdomen about with great facility it is  a contrivance of which a tender finger may well  be afraid  Among the wingless insects of Linnaeus is one  which he has called by a name which signifies  that it has got a leg in its tail and this is actually the fact in so far as that these insects  have an organ in their tail which answers all the  purpose of a leg Some of these little creatures  which are black may be often found in spring  strewed in infinite numbers upon the surface of  the water in ditches or pools and may be seen  jumping about on the surface of the water as if  bewitched At their tail is a forklike organ  which is generally bent under the body but  when they spring up they do so by quickly un¬  bending this fork the resistance it meets with  being sufficient to carry it to a certain distance  Another insect is provided with eight pair of  springs in its abdomen by means of which it can  leap to a great distance with most astonishing  agility Here we shall conclude the external  anatomy of the insect in the imago state  CHAPTER III  RESPIRATION OF THE IMAGO  Perfect insects breathe That this is so the  following experiments will satisfactorily prove  A spicier and a fly were put into a glass jar  the mouth of which was closed all but a hole by  which a tube was admitted The tube was then connected with a pipe by which a supply of common  coalgas was poured into the jar and when it was  considered to be full of gas and that all the air  had been displaced the tube was closed and the  insects were left shut up in an atmosphere of gas  In a few seconds both became very uneasy the fly  more particularly so and in a few seconds more the  fly began to agitate itself to buz against the sides of  the glass and to tumble over in the most extraordinary manner the spider ran hurriedly about as  if astonished and not knowing what to make of his  new position but presently he became very quiet  and turning on his back looked as if dead For a  minute or two the fly which was a large active  fleshfly continued its noisy evolutions dashing  itself as if intoxicated on every side of its trans¬  parent prison At length as if exhausted it lay  on its back its limbs paralyzed but the wings still  moving with extreme rapidity and causing it to  spin round in the most singular manner Ultimately it too became perfectly without motion  After the lapse of about ten minutes fresh air  was gradually let into the jar and it became most  amusing to watch the return of both these insects  which had previously been as it were in the very  jaws of death back to life again twitchings of  their limbs and slight convulsive movements  were the first indications of returning activity  and in a few minutes more both insects now  placed in a perfectly pure atmosphere were as  lively as before the experiment and were alloAved  to make their escape into the open air With  other insects the same effects Were produced by  saturating a piece of blotting paper with ether and  dropping it into the jar which was immediately covered over In several other experiments  the newlydiscovered powerful fluid chloroform by  means of which the operations of surgery are  performed without pain was employed and it  was remarkable to notice how quickly the insects  were overpowered with the vapour of this potent  liquid In no instance was death produced by  the gases or vapours employed Wishing to  destroy without pain a beautiful specimen of a  goatmoth it was first stupified with the gas then  transfixed with a pin and again plunged in an  atmosphere of gas all night long but alas for  the unhappy insect the morning dawned and it  was yet alive  In these simple experiments which were repeated  sufficiently often to render the results certain we  have a most interesting proof that insects breathe  The first struggles and apparent intoxication can  be compared to nothing more exactly than to the  same phenomena when they take place in human  beings breathing the vapours of ether or chloroform The subsequent state of insensibility was  precisely similar to that induced in persons who  are put under the influence of these vapours  An amusing instance of the restorative powers  of fresh air occurred in the course of these experiments A bluebottle which was purposely selected of as large a species as could be found was  first intoxicated and rendered insensible by coal  gas and was then as quickly as possible put into a  net of the geometric spider instantly the spider  flew upon his bulky captive but the fresh air began  to take effect on the fly and it commenced struggling in the most furious manner Although the  spider cast out a cloud of web and in the most  energetic manner endeavoured to envelope its prey  the fly seemed likely to be the victor one of its  large and powerful wings got free and flapped violently until the meshes of the web gave way or  was perhaps broken by the weight of the insect  and fly and spider being suspended in the air  spun round so swiftly as to be quite indistinguishable Ultimately the spider conquered and  suspending the huge body of its victim by a rope  in the air returned for a short time to its den  If insects do not breathe then all these results  are quite unintelligible for it would be immaterial to the insect what atmosphere it might happen  to be placed in A number of illustrious authors  have recorded the result of their experiments upon  the effects of other gases on insects Bees and  other insects have been placed under the exhausted  receiver of an airpump and death ensued in a short  space of time It has also been found that when the  bodies of insects are covered with oil or grease so  as to stop up their breathing pores they soon  expire It has been proved by carefully con¬  ducted experiments performed by Mr Ellis M  Sorg and other observers that on placing flies in  a measured quantity of atmospheric air at the end  of a day or two almost the whole amount of the  oxygen of the air had disappeared and the same  amount of carbonic acid had appeared in the chamber in which the insects were confined We need  not however after all that has been said on the  subject of the respiration of insects in their various stages enter into any further proofs that  insects breathe not less perfectly in their imago  condition than in any of the preceding states  in fact they perform this function far more prominently in this their last state than in any of the  foregoing It will also be unnecessary to enter  into a consideration of the minute particulars connected with this subject as several of these have  been previously glanced at The air enters the body of the insect at the  spiracles or breathingpores which are arranged  along the abdomen and situated at the side of the  wings and is received by a large tube on each  side of the body running its whole length or  nearly so as we before mentioned This tube and  those which it gives off as branches are called  trachea or airpipes The tracheae are formed  in the most wonderful manner so as to keep  them always open that the air can readily pass  through them Perhaps some of our readers  have seen the contrivance adopted by sailors in  order to blow air down into the hold and cabins  of the ship for those who have not we may  take the liberty of mentioning that it is a large  tube made of canvass open at the side near the  top so as to catch the wind while the bottom of  it opens into the cabin Now the sailors always  place the mouth of this tube towards the wind  which is forced down the tube into the cabin  either by its own speed or by that of the vessel  in the case of a steamer and so fills the cabin  below continually with fresh air But it will be  asked how do they contrive so to keep the sides  of the bag from flapping together as to prevent  them from closing By imitating a contrivance  which exists in the trachea or airtube of the  insect they place at certain distances inside this  canvass tube a series of wooden hoops which en¬  tirely prevent its collapsing as it otherwise would  do The most minute airtubes of an insect are  furnished not indeed with a series of rings but  with what serves the same purpose a firm but  delicate coil of cartilage like a spiral spring over  which the membranous lining of the tube is  stretched Thus these tubes remain constantly  open and whatever may be the movements of  the insect they retain this position The tracheae  branch out in a most wonderful manner inside the  insects body as thickly as in our bodies and in  those of animals the fine bloodvessels divide until  they form a mesh so close that we cannot prick our¬  selves with a pin without piercing some little tubes  and drawing blood so in those of the insect the  minute airpipes run in every direction and divide  into countless thousands of branches which only  become visible under the highest powers of a good  microscope The large tubes are seen without  difficulty in many insects and a drawing which  may give some idea of the immense mass of air  tubes existing in the body of an insect is annexed  all the rest of the body is supposed to be cut away  and the larger tubes only are shown as it is impossible to represent the smaller ones so as to give  a clear view of their  arrangement they  would cover the drawing like a cloud of the  finest and most delicate lace work In  short in insects there  being no separate lungs  in a particular place  as in the animal frame  the air is necessarily  carried all over the   so as to be supplied even to the most  minute parts thus the  lungs may be said to extend through the whole  body  As the reader has laid his finger on his pulse or  felt his heart beating within him or seen a drop  of blood ooze from his wounded hand have the  questions never occurred to himHave insects  bloodvessels and a beating heart And if so  have they blood like ours Many a wise man of  old even the great Baron Cuvier himself has  supposed that there was no circulation of the  blood in insects But with a magnifying glass  and a caterpillar before us we shall soon be satis¬  fied that this is a great mistake for by carefully  looking along the insects back we shall perceive  in that part a very evident pulsation as though a  fluid were pushed at regular intervals towards the  head The cut represents the  circulation in the vessels of the  larva of an Ephemera But in¬  sects have no heart like that of  man and animals What then  can this beating organ be which  we behold Although it is not  like our heart it is nevertheless  an organ which serves all the  purpose of ours and pumps on  The circulation in an Ephemera The arrows repre tllC blood With great regularity  sent tie direction of the Instead of being a muscular  organ of small size but great thickness like  our heart it is in reality a long tube called the  dorsalvessel running along the abdomen and thorax  of the insect into which the blood is poured by the  veins and out of which it is forced on towards the  head by the regular contractions of its side This  causes the beating movement which we saw in the  caterpillar Perhaps there may be some curiosity  to know whether an insects pulse beats faster or  slower than ours John Hunter counted thirty  four beats in a minute in a silkworm Another  observer counted thirty a minute in a caterpillar  of the pinemoth But in the imago state the pulse  appears to move much quicker and it is easy to  make an insects beat extremely fast by exciting or  provoking it Mr Newport having done so to a  bee counted as many as 142 beats a minute In  a middleaged man the pulse beats about seventy  times in a minute in a child seven years old about  eightyfive times and at the age of fourteen about  eighty times Hence it follows that our pulse beats  about twice as fast as that of an insect in the  larva state in the imago state it is probably as a  general rule at least in winged active insects  higher than ours  CHAPTER IV  FOOD AND DEATH OF THE IMAGO  But we have something to say about the food  of insects Although it has been already laid  down as a general rule that insects in their perfect state do not eat in any degree with the  voracity they exhibit in the larva form it is  nevertheless true that they do both require and  devour food in considerable quantities and of  various kinds Some for example are exclusively  vegetable feeders They attack all the parts of  plants not excepting even the root and the bark  Some with an elegant taste select the yellow  pollen of flowers for their dainty and delicate food  And others more refined still in their appetites  will have nothing but the fresh distilled honey  that lies hid at the bottom of the flowers pump¬  ing it up by the beautiful spirallycoiled tube  which forms a part of their mouth Need we say  these are the butterflies The fly loves a grain of  sugar or a savoury joint of meat and to other  insects to use a quotation of Mr Spences which  prefer the paper of our Atlases or maps   a river and a sea  Are a disli of tea  And a kingdom bread and butter  A large number also are carnivorous creatures  need we mention the spidertribe a name of terror  to myriads of our summer insectfriends The  beautiful cicindeloe called by Linnaeus the tigers  to insects prey upon the whole insect race and  are endowed with powers of offence and destruc¬  tion to a degree sufficient fully to justify this  title In France we are told the butchers  are very glad to have wasps attend their stalls  since they drive away and undoubtedly prey  upon the numerous flies which frequent these  places The larger species of ants are equally  ferocious attacking any small softbodied insect  they may meet with and when killed dragging it  to their nest The beautiful ladybirds which we  look upon with so much tenderness remember¬  ing the ditty   Ladybird ladybird fly away home  Your house is on fire your children will burn  are in the larva state furious destroyers of other  insects and will gobble up aphides by the score in  a very short time The dragonfly too stands  conspicuous among the insect devourers not only  in its larva but in its perfect condition and falls  upon multitudes of insects plucking off their  wings and with savage relish devouring their  bodies We are not however to suppose that the  appetites of carnivorous insects are confined to  insectfood The blow fly lives upon and defiles  by depositing its eggs in our butchers meat The  cockroach will polish a bone as clean as or cleaner  than any dog will and indeed will consume  almost anything that happens to come in its way  Lastly we may not omit to mention that some  insects have to plunge their armed mouths into  our flesh and that of other animals and to slake  their raging thirst in a draught of our lifeblood  among which we will only enumerate the musquito the gnat and the flea We need scarcely  say that insects are provided with proper organs  of digestion  Singular to add some insects in the perfect  state do not eat at all The silkworm moth and  the Ephemera are amongst this number they live  so short a time as not to require food Some in¬  sects also possess a most extraordinary power of  abstaining from food There have been at different  times wonderful tales related of human beings  who in a supposed trance have endured the privation of food for an extremely long timeweeks  and even months And more recently we have  an account of an Indian who suffered himself to be  buried alive built over with bricks and mortar  and a great seal set upon the only opening to his  tomb a guard being also set and after the  expiration of a certain time before agreed upon  the sepulchre was opened and he was taken  outalive All this is extremely wonderful if  we could only feel certain that there was no  deception in the case But it is nothing to what  can be adduced from the insect world The ant  lion has been known to endure a fast of six entire  months and to be as lively as possible at their  termination An author quoted by Messrs  Kirby and Spence kept a spider in a sealed  glass for ten months at the end of which time  though shrunk in size it was as vigorous as  ever And Mr Baker relates that he once kept  a beetle alive for three years without food of any  kind whatever  When we call to memory the intense voracity of  the insect while a larvahow insatiable its appetite how extensive its ravagesand contrast it  with the perfect insect we are struck with astonishment Why is this we ask that in all cases  insects eat less when they are fully developed  than when in their infancy and youth It is as  if a fullgrown healthy man were to eat less than  his little child a year or two old The reason appears to be that in the imago state no further  changes which consume a great deal of material  as may be imagined when we remember the loss  of substance in every cast of the skin are necessary the insect only requires food sufficient to  preserve its life and activity in the state to which  it has come and needs no laying up of stores of  fat for future consumption Fluttering awhile in  glorious apparel through a world of flowers and  sunshine the period of its life runs out and its  only further change isto die and return to its  kindred dust  But before this takes place one last duty devolves upon the insect which unfulfilled would  leave the world at its death with one link in the  chain of creation broken offthis is to make  provision for the continuance of its species We  have already said that insects as a general rule  have been no doubt in wisdom destined to  deposit their eggs not knowing what is to come  forth of them and never enjoying that happiness  which is granted to many other beingsthe happiness of parental love Some most interesting  exceptions to this rule will have also been mentioned in which a mothers love for her young has  been exemplified in a remarkable manner  Yet though denied this pleasure and privilege  the motherinsect exercises as we have before  seen all the care and forethought of the most  affectionate parent in depositing its eggs and in  making such arrangements as will be most conducive to the happiness and wellbeing of its  future progeny We can scarcely say that in  this it shows that it possesses anything like such  a feeling as that of a parent towards its child  It takes the wonderful precautions and performs  the singular actions which have been already  in part recorded in our first chapter in all  probability without being aware of the reasons  why it should do so How can it tell that its  future progeny will eat this food or that food  How can the poor blowfly when it leaves its eggs  on our food be certain that it is appointing a  suitable place for the birthspot of its progeny  Why does it not select the green surface of the  leaf or the warm corner of the window or the  bare earth for this purpose We might say  perhaps in this instance that the insect is only  choosing the place where it obtains its own food  But what shall we say when we find insects such  as the butterfly depositing their eggs upon plants  which they never frequent at any other time and  from which they never obtained a particle of food  themselves Some for instance deposit them on  the nettle although never tasting anything from  this plant themselves while the young which are  to proceed forth from the eggs feed voraciously  upon it  We cannot in any way but one account for  this forethought The poor insect left to itself  would undoubtedly deposit its eggs indifferently  anywhere and the result would be that its  young family if hatched at all would awake  only to find themselves in a desert without  food or hope of reaching any and would soon  perish Need we say how it can be easily  accounted for Surely only because it is God  who has instructed these humble creatures enduing them if not actually with the powers of  foresight at any rate with the instinct which  impels them to proceed in such a manner as if  they were thus endowed By a most wonderful  exercise of wisdom He has taught them to distinguish even between the different species of plants  and rarely indeed do we find that the insect commits a mistake or selects a wrong or fatal birth¬  place for its young  Insect history is full of such instances of the  great Creators wisdom and love Although they  are not rendered conspicuous to every eye they  are not the less real nor the less amazing In  our Life of an Insect many have been the occasions when we have stopped to wonder afresh at  continually new and more striking indications of  His adorable goodness and power as the different  phenomena of insectlife have been paraded before  us Yet this is but a very minute portion of what  really exists of the admirable and beautiful in the  insect world Not one volume not a hundred volumes would suffice to relate the interesting facts  which connect themselves in various ways with the  insects life The main features only have been  developed and these imperfectly Such being  the case what a world of wonders is the great  creation were we to consider it only as peopled  with insects What pen could write their history  what tongue narrate the many marvels of their  existence Ten thousand times ten thousand and  thousand of thousands surround us on every side  accompany us on our excursions and visit us in  our homes fill the air with life and the waters  with creeping things  The history of an insects life impresses upon  us one of the most consoling truths contained in  the word of God We may learn from the tale  of Gods wonders in the vegetable creation we  may find also in the history of birds beasts and  fishes innumerable proofs of His love and care  and goodness to all But these are creatures whose  size in the main renders them conspicuous too  much so as we might say to be overlooked Ah thenwere there no insects one might  doubtingly exclaim God may take thought for  these large creatures while more minute beings  would be beneath His notice And so with me  God may order and arrange the great events in  my life but are not the little ones too small for  Him to regard The life of an insect answers  these doubts It tells us that though a being be  only of the size of a grain of sand or not larger  than the full stop at the end of this sentence God  has supplied it with the most beautiful organs  has endowed it with life and with the most wonderful instincts thus manifesting that in the  words of Scripture His care is over all His  works If God then  i To whom an atom is an ample field  has not thought it beneath Him to take care for  such diminutive shortlived creatures as these  how much more will He care for His own people  reconciled to Him through the blood of Jesus and  sanctified by the Holy Spirit of promise We  are not left however to learn this blessed truth  from the page of creation alone Our Lord has  himself declared to us that the very hairs of our  head are all numbered and has left on record the  promise that if we seek first the kingdom of  God and His righteousness all these things  that is all temporal things shall be added  unto us  K E  THE ENDCONTENTS PART II PAGE Chapter I The Emigrants

quit it for an untried world Has overpopulation rendered the land too strait for them or has dearth of food imperiously required their removal to a more fertile soil These interesting inquiries so strange in their connexion with creatures commonly considered so insignificant as insects it is the purpose of the present chapter to discuss We shall find that wise principles of political economy have been impressed upon the tribes of insects by their Divine Creator and that in the social history of beings far beneath man in created excellence and attributes most astonishing features are to be traced assimilating them in various remarkable points to creatures fully endowed with mind memory and reason In a former part of this work the various stages through which the insect passes up to the perfect being have been successively considered The life of an insect has been watched from the egg to the winged creature whose sporting place is the unbounded field of air The anatomy and physiology of insects have also been discussed and occasional glances have been taken at the singular habits and propensities of insects in the conditions of larva pupa and imago Our present task is yet more pleasing We have to treat of the habits and manners of these interesting beings and it will he our delightful occupation to unfold such singular traits in their character and such wonderful phenomena in their private and public life as must entitle them to our highest admiration or even to our respect We have to exhibit the insect tribes emigrating colonizing building cities ambuscading fortifying duelling fighting the most terrible battles and in almost all respects imitating the proceedings of what we are pleased to call civilized life As we proceed may we be always in remembrance of that Great and Glorious Being who as if to confound human wisdom has endowed these tiny creatures with instincts which enable them to accomplish their purposes with a degree of wisdom ingenuity and perseverance not surpassed by man himself We have first then to consider the singular fact of insect emigration In these times when every week bears away from our shores numbers of our fellow countrymen to a larger country and to better fortunes how strange the thought that for thousands of years the insect world has furnished us an example of its members seeking a similar relief to an overteeming parent country and to the pressure of the times Impelled by an instinct given from above their legions have year after year passed in emigrating bands through our forests and fields Ere the first family of man dispersed on finding their dwelling place too limited for their necessities before the separation of Abram and Lot and of Esau and Jacob because the land could not bear them so great was the number of their families and flocks insects taught of God sent out their colonists and relieved the scarcity of their first birthplace by the dispatch of myriads of emigrants The most frequent causes of insect emigration are either want of room or want of food But at times as we shall have to observe immense crowds of emigrants are seen upon the cause of whose movements very little light has as yet been thrown In ordinary cases when the insect tribe finds that its numbers are becoming too great to he accommodated within the common habitation of the people or when the ordinary supplies of food are insufficient to meet the demand of the overflowing population emigration becomes the remedy and it is generally adopted by them without further delay How the councils for this important step are summoned how each individual becomes impressed with the perhaps painful fact that it must soon bid adieu to its fatherland and to the comfortable dwelling in which it had spent the happy hours of infancy and early maturity how the whole population is in like manner impressed and as with one mind resolves to adopt this measure of relief we may not tell Although they have public meetings at which great excitement is displayed and although the head of every insect seems turned with the emigrating idea so that they forget what they are about and in the anxieties of the future lose their sense of the duties of the present yet we hear not of any insect orator swaying multitudes with the force of his arguments or the eloquence of his speech and all the other means of agitation common among the superiors to insects are of course unknown to them By what means soever it be of the fact itself there is no doubt neither can we doubt that every emigrant little though we can comprehend his sensations is for the time being wholly absorbed with this idea and this alone In our desire to explain what we cannot understand we call this instinct but alas it is only a term under which we satisfy our pride and shelter our real ignorance It is time however that we bring these wonderful little beings upon the scene On a warm evening in the early days of June if we bend our steps in the direction of a range of beehives we may perchance he so fortunate as to hear the foretokens of a bee emigration As if discussing the approaching vastly important epoch in their history as a community and the probable advantages of a different locality on one of these hives were to be seen for a few evenings before one or two little knots of bees In what light we are to regard these little assemblies it is difficult to say and the historians of the bee people omit to state whether they hold these preliminary meetings to take counsel with one another or simply to enjoy the cool evening air as the days are now growing excessively warm There can he little doubt they have some connexion with the approaching expedition for it is at this very time that our steps are now arrested by hearing the note of preparation sounded from within On other nights we should listen in vain for a sound from the silent city of the bees and in the other hives the winged myriads are asleep and silent But from this hive issues a low ceaseless hum and on carefully listening we should distinguish sounds of confused origin sounds of tumult and bustle and we might look every moment for the sudden appearance of the whole population at the gates of the city This sound is the sure forerunner of the emigration movement It is hard to say what it can be Are the bees busy packing up previous to their removal Are they bidding farewell to those who are to be left behind Are they encouraging every one his brother or are they holding some grand council relative to this public expedition It has been said indeed that this sound is a royal speech made by the queen bee to her affectionate subjects If so it is much longer than the harangues of earthly sovereigns are wont to be for it ceases not all through the night and her subjects must be considered excellent listeners for not a moments sleep do they permit to themselves the night through Leaving however the queen in the midst of her discourse if it so be or her subjects in the midst of their packings up leave takings and mutual conversations we must come the next day at noon if we would watch the departure of the emigrants As night wears on the emigrants bustling to and fro with an air of infinite anxiety prepare to take the final step awaiting only the arrival of warm and genial sunlight to depart on their expedition The day dawns yet not an emigrant ajipears and the sunbeams pour in golden richness through the gate of the bee city yet its inhabitants appear resolved not to quit its precincts The murmur and confusion within do not cease and it is very evident that a great ferment is taking place among the population although nothing of it appears outside Noon tide comes and the fervid sunbeams light upon the city of the bees raising its temperature and not diminishing the fume into which the bees have wrought themselves The great moment has at length arrived Suddenly a tumult more violent than before is created in the hive and now along the avenues of the city a scene of the wildest excitement is presented Hither and thither fly the labouring classes of the community rushing to and fro as if bewildered There is a cessation of all business to the remotest extremities of the city and from the monarch her self down to the meanest of her subjects there is not one individual who is not absorbed by the vast concerns of the moment to the entire neglect of all their customary duties A rush is now made by the queen and her subjects to the city gate and instantly there emerges from it so dense a stream of emigrant insects as to defy the powers of enumeration Thronging crowds come hastily out and in company with the queen rise and fill the air Before following them to their new abode it is necessary we should go back and state a httle circumstance which might have been noticed a few days prior to this grand movement of emigration At a little distance from the city of the bees stood two aged trunks which by the influence of time and decay had become hollowed so as to present a convenient shelter from the inclemencies of the weather and these hollow recesses communicated with the external air by a suitable passage Altogether and considering too that the odorous perfume of such flowers as bees love to riot in came wafted thither from a garden plot close by either of these hollow trunks formed a very appropriate spot for the settlement of the emigrant bees oppressed at home with the heat and overcrowded state of their city To both trees it became evident a scientific body of exploration had been sent by the bees The explorers might have been seen at the time of which we speak making the most minute investigation of the interior and exterior of the trunks The soundness of the walls was duly examined and the proportions of the cavity were accurately surveyed Crevices were penetrated and deep deliberations as to the weatherproof character of certain suspicious parts appeared to be entered into The scientific party returned it may he to publish to the expectant emigrants at home their report as to the capabilities of the new territory they had explored Again and again did they return to renew their investigations and to obtain if possible fresh evidence of the suitability of the situation to the requirements of the bee population The choice was at length made and no civil engineer could have found of those presented to their selection a more excellent site for a colony than the exploring bees had determined on The hour of departure arrived the explorers led the way and followed by a winged host of bees sought and took possession in the queens name of the locality they had previously selected Here a new empire was founded and a new city built which in a short time teemed with population and was ultimately compelled to adopt the same method of relief which had led to its first establishment by throwing off a swarm of emigrants In the case of the bee emigration it is only a part of the population which quits the city and the remainder proceed after their departure in the fulfilment of their ordinary duties But we have instances in the Insect world of whole nations of emigrants of insect tribes having no settled country like some of the wanderers of the human race and passing from one spot to another almost indifferently The exact cause of the migrations of such tribes can scarcely be defined The abundance or scarcity of food is however the chief circumstance leading to the occupation of a new or the desertion of an old locality One of the most remarkable examples of this class of insect emigrants is that of the Driver Ants of West Africa a highly interesting account of which has been given by the Rev Thomas S Savage of Cape Palmas in West Africa These remarkable insects have also been called the Visiting Ants and various accounts of their habits have been published from time to time These wandering insects appear to have no fixed habitation Their temporary encampment like the gipsies of our own species is generally in the woods under shelving rocks or in a hollow overarched by the roots of trees They give themselves no trouble in its embellishment and avail themselves of the rude shelter such positions may afford without any attempt to add to the natural advantages accidental to the spot No leisure have they for works of art or appliances of civilised life Their house is a den of robbers and by its confused and unmitigated savageness indicates the nature and occupation of its tenants They have neither cells nor magazines nor the other interior arrangements exhibited in the abodes of other insect nations Dwelling in rocks caves and fissures of the earth they are in a moment ready to arise and emigrate on the first call of necessity or pressure of events Their emigrating expeditions are chiefly made in cloudy days or in the obscurity of the night Like robbers they prefer the hours of darkness and while the rest of creation is asleep the whole population of the Drivers will be up and stirring and ere the morrows sun will have deserted one abode and taken up their residence in another Their mode of emigrating is extremely curious and may well claim our admiration Exposure to the suns rays is highly dangerous to them and is not unfrequently almost instantly fatal In their march they have therefore to guard against their power which they do in a very singular manner It may so happen that spite of their precaution in travelling overnight the morn ing sunbeams break upon the world finding them still in transit In this emergency they will construct covered ways or arches over their path by moulding a portion of earth with a glutinous fluid excreted from their mouth and in the tunnels thus constructed they pass with safety from one region to another If their way however possesses any natural advantages which can be turned to the same account the tunnels are not formed and the emigrant legions will pass under the shelter of dense herbage or sticks unscathed by the fierce luminary which is their most formidable foe In cloudy days they adopt a yet more singular expedient To construct an earthen arch seems scarcely war ranted since the power of the sunbeam is scarcely perceptible Yet even to its enfeebled rays the tender bodies of the pupcB or young of the nation cannot be safely exposed they therefore con struct an arch of the bodies of the largest class Their widely extended jaws long slender limbs and projecting antennae intertwining form a sort of network that seems to answer well their object Whenever an alarm is given the arch is instantly broken and the ants joining others of the same class on the outside of the line who seem to be acting as commanders guides and scouts run about in a furious manner in pursuit of the enemy If the alarm should prove to be without foundation the victory won or danger passed the arch is quickly renewed and the main column marches forward as before in all the order of military discipline Let us now mention an attack upon these formidable emigrants instituted by the narrator of their habits from whose account we have been quoting At one time the drivers literally drove out every member of the female department of the school wdth which Dr Savage was connected at another the male department then the inmates of his own dwelling They then attacked the horse pigs fowls c c nothing in short possessing animal life escaped their assaults They always made their expeditions at night some times sending two or three as an advance guard who might be seen lurking about in a suspicious manner just at nightfall A resolution was at length taken to discover their habitation and to destroy the whole population by a coup de main Beneath a shelving rock of decomposing granite their temporary dwelling place was discovered They had been roused by the noise and efforts of the workmen and had come forth in incalculable numbers for defence literally blackening the surrounding grass and shrubbery Lines of ants going and coming agreeably to the rules of their order were running in opposite directions Their paths were very distinct and well trodden of about an inch in width In other directions were seen covered ways forsaken the object of their formation no longer existing no prey having been discovered or if found being disposed of and other regions lying open for exploration Their numbers could not he computed millions on millions seemed to he there besides thousands that were going and coming with astonishing speed and alacrity A quantity of dried leaves and other combustible matter was collected and ignited on the spot producing a fire of great intensity which continued to burn for a considerable time This was to be the end of the annoyance But vain hope Two days after a tree at a short distance to the height of some feet from the ground together with the adjacent plants and earth was perfectly black with them Thick festoons of insects hung down to the ground upon which numbers were ascending and descending One of these festoons writes Dr Savage I saw in the act of formation it was a good way advanced when first observed ant after ant coming down from above extending their long limbs and opening wide their jaws gradually lengthened out the living chain till it touched the broad leaf of a Canna Coccinea below It now swang to and fro in the wind the terminal ant the meanwhile endeavouring to attach it hj its jaws and legs to the leaf Not succeed ing in so doing another ant of the same class the very largest was seen to ascend the plant and fixing his hind legs with the apex of the abdomen firmly to the leaf under the vibrating column then reaching forth his fore legs and opening wide his jaws closed in with his companion from above and thus completed the most curious ladder in the world They had migrated from the burning city to this spot there being evidently a cavity under the tree It proved to be too small for the population and a large number were now busily engaged in extending its dimensions In a little while their new abode was fully occupied and excursion parties were already out in the thicket for food their course being easily followed by their beaten track and arched way Their new abode was then fired and presently emerging from the flaming trunk their order unbroken by their frightful position surrounded by the crackling flames the heat and the smoke appeared legions of the drivers now compelled to emigrate elsewhere As it was a wet and cloudy day the covered way was not adopted but the larger class arranging themselves on either side in an arch of living bodies formed the substitute Under this arch armed on all sides with sharp claws and fixed hooked open jaws the feebler part passed rapidly forwards in conscious safety The bag gage of the emigrants consisted of the helpless pupae which they carried longitudinally in their mouths and between their legs or of prey which they were too good economists to leave behind Here and there a driver emigrant would be found with a load two or three times larger than him self yet he seemed little incommoded thereby and his pace was not a whit slower than that of his brethren Although their numbers must have been thinned by many thousands by the two conflagrations yet thousands of thousands still remained forming a long line of emigrants extending far from their last unfortunate locality Difficulties which would damp the courage of emigrants of our own species are met and over come by the drivers without hesitation It may happen that a current of water runs exactly across their course and this puts their ingenuity to the test If it is too extensive for them to fetch a compass around they without fear cast themselves into its waters and so form a line or chain of hving floating bodies over which the whole population passes in safety Some times they are compelled to emigrate by the sudden rise of the floods In this emergency they form themselves into a rounded mass de positing the young the pupae and eggs in their centre and then entrusting themselves to the tumultuous waves which float them in safety to a new region What is perhaps the most remarkable feature of these interesting insects is the fact that they appear to be totally blind All these wonderful proceedings are the acts of creatures in which after a most careful exami nation the slightest indication of eyes cannot be discovered We need not visit West Africa for annals of insect emigration when in our own fields a scene not less interesting is to be witnessed by any attentive observer of the habits of the red ant or hill ant Formica rufa Having one day writes M M P Huber deranged the habitation of a colony of fallow ants I perceived that they had changed their domicile I saw at the distance of ten paces from their nest a fresh anthill which communicated with the old by a path struck out in the grass along which the ants were passing and repassing in great numbers I remarked that all those going towards the new establishment were loaded with their companions whilst those moving in a contrary direction were running one after the other these were no doubt returning to the old nest to seek inhabit ants for the new The further observations of Eluber on this emigration are told so agreeably by Messrs Kirby and Spence that we shall transfer their account to our pages The first step is to raise recruits with this view some of the neuters who have explored the spot eagerly accost several fellow citizens of their own order caress them with their antennas lead them by their mandibles and evidently appear to propose the journey to them If they seem disposed to accompany them the recruiting officer for so he may be called prepares to carry off his recruit who suspending himself upon his mandibles hangs coiled up spirally under his neck all this passes in an amicable manner after mutual salutations Sometimes however the recruiter takes the other by surprise and drags him from the anthill with out giving him time to consider or resist When arrived at the proposed habitation the suspended ant uncoils itself and quitting its conductor becomes a recruiter in its turn The pair return to the old nest and each carries off a fresh recruit which being arrived at the spot joins in the undertaking thus the number of recruiters keeps progressively increasing till the path be tween the new and the old city is full of goers and comers each of the former laden with a recruit This extraordinary scene continues several days but when all the neuters are acquainted with the road to the new city the recruiting ceases As soon as a sufficient number of apartments to contain them are prepared the young brood with the males and females are conveyed thither and the whole business is concluded When the new site is at a considerable distance from the old these ingenious emigrants construct little resting places by the wayside in which they deposit the recruits and tenderer part of the population These are however generally con ducted hence after they have recovered the fatigues of the journey to the grand settlement Sometimes however these resting places are chosen as the site of smaller colonies and between the new and old colony several of these smaller permanent settlements may occasionally he seen Like good emigrants however they never lose sight of their parent country nor cease to maintain the closest and most friendly inter course with it It might be imagined that a movement so important as this would make a vast sensation in the parent community but on the contrary no sensation appears to be felt by the parent city although daily its inhabitants are becoming thinned by those active emigration agents the neuters No duty is interrupted and all the affairs of the insect government proceed with their customary punctuality and dispatch The recruiting continues however and finally the seat of government which is of the republican order is absolutely removed to the new colony The causes which appear to lead to this emigration are generally the operation of some local circumstances calculated to make their original residence either dangerous or uncomfortable to them If a community of ants is disturbed by man or by other animals or if by some alterations in the ground on which they dwell they become exposed to the severities of the weather and a more convenient station has been detected by some of their number emigration is generally the result Both ants and bees are insects which live in societies But insects which do not ordinarily live in a society of their fellows will frequently unite together and form one great company for the purpose of emigration to a different soil Mr Knapp informs us that the common glowworm may be sometimes seen emigrating in warm sum mer evenings and he has given a pleasing account of the movement of these insects The evening was warm and dewy and we observed on the bank multitudes of small evanescent sparks in the grass The light displayed was very different from that which glowworms exhibit in the warm summer months Instead of the permanent green glow that illumines all the blades of the surrounding herbage it was a pale transient spot visible for a moment or two and then so speedily hidden that we were obliged in order to capture the creature to employ the light of a candle The number of them and their actions creeping away from our sight contrary to that half lifeless dulness observed in summer suggested the idea that the whole body had availed themselves of this warm moist evening to migrate to their winter station A single spark or so was to be seen some evenings after this but no such large moving parties were discovered again If we conclude that the summer bght of the glowworm is displayed as a signal taper the appearance of this autumnal light can have no such object in view nor can we rationally assign any use of it to the creature itself unless indeed it serve as a point of union in these supposed migrations like the leading call in the flight of night moving birds The activity and numbers of these insects on the above mentioned evening enabled me to observe the frequent presence and disappearance of the light of an individual which did not seem to be the result of will but produced by situation During the time the insect crawled along the ground or upon the fine grass the glow was hidden but on its mounting any little blade or sprig of moss it turned round and presented the luminous caudal spot which on its falling or regaining its level was hidden again Sometimes the little insects called the water boatman Notonecta glauca will migrate in immense numbers and fall from the air as thick as hail In the evening of a pleasant day in September 1846 Sir G Simpson encamped for the night on his route from Red River to the head waters of the Mississippi While supper was preparing he perceived something falling on his hat like drops of rain hut as there were no clouds to be seen he of course presumed it could not really he rain On looking on the ground near the fire he saw distinctly that the falling substance instead of being rain was a small winged insect which although unable to fly had yet life and motion The number rapidly in creased so as to give great annoyance by falling into the frying pan and supper vessels and continued until the ground was covered by the shower On the following morning Sir George ascertained that this extraordinary shower ex tended at least from twenty five to thirty miles in the direction he was travelling No information could be obtained as to its extent in other directions It was observed that soon after the shower the weather changed suddenly from warm to cold It appears therefore probable that the whole of this prodigious flight of emigrant insects must have suddenly encountered the cold current and becoming paralysed were precipitated to the ground They all died soon after falling In no instance did they revive even though brought into a warmer atmosphere The same circumstance on a smaller scale has been noticed in our own country showers of these little insects have been observed falling from the air into pools of water Sometimes they have apparently mistaken the glistening surface of a conservatory for the appearance of water and plunging downwards upon the glass have imitated the sound of a shower of hail Those common little insects which are so often the pest of the greenhouse and the enemies of our rose currant raspberry trees geraniums and other plants the aphides occasionally emigrate in immense numbers The naturalist of Selborne Gilbert Wliite has put on record a memorable shower of these insects About three o clock in the afternoon of a very hot day in August 1785 the people of the village were much surprised by the falling of a multitude of these aphides Those who were walking in the streets at that juncture found themselves covered with them They also settled on the hedges and gardens blackening all the vegetables where they alighted My annuals observes Mr Wliite were discoloured with them and the stalks of a bed of onions were quite coated over for six days after These armies were then no doubt in a state of emigration and shifting their quarters and might have come as far as we know from the great hop plantations of Kent or Sussex the wind being all that day in the easterly quarter The aphides feed largely in the hop plantations and by their numbers not unfrequently ruin the prospects of the hop grower Yet they sometimes wander in immense bodies from these localities and are found by the dwellers on the seacoast They also migrate from one species of plant to another The very insect which destroys the hop plant migrated to it from the sloe tree which is its proper dwelling place It has therefore been recommended with the view of preserving the hop to cut short this fatal emigration by carefully inspecting the sloe trees in the vicinity of hop grounds and destroying the intending emigrants before their change to more luxuriant quarters In winter a species of aphis dwells and feeds upon the furze but when summer comes and when to reward the agriculturists toil the fields stand thick with healthy beanstalks this insect determines to better its quarters and migrates from the less agreeable position in which it has so long continued to the green feast spread before it in the neighbouring fields But the aphis army is not permitted to spread its devastating emigrant hordes without a check This slow and sensual creature which seems only horn to eat and die and is generally gorged so immensely as scarcely to he able to move a step has numberless enemies Among them the most active are the ladybirds which appear to determine on emigrating too wherever the aphides emigrate Some years ago they swarmed in in numerable multitudes upon the coast of the counties of Kent and Sussex having migrated thither apparently in hot pursuit of the aphides from the adjoining hop grounds In August 1847 Brighton was swarmed with lady birds They were crushed by thousands upon the pavement of the Grand Parade and the adjoining streets The houses the fences and even the clothes of all the pedestrians were dotted thickly over with these insect emigrants Between four and six o clock on a Thursday evening a long cloud reaching some few miles across the sea was observed by many hundred spectators from the heights of Ramsgate and Margate bending its course to our southern coast from the direction of Calais and Ostend It presented the appearance of a long column of smoke from a steamer on a calm day About ten o clock in the evening the excitement of the spectators was intensely increased by their be coming literally covered with ladybirds Many of those who had been most exposed on their return to their homes found themselves so completely enveloped with these little insects and that in so much regularity that they had the appearance of being clad in scale armour At an early hour in the morning the whole of the line of coast was found to be covered by them to the great annoyance of all parties Five bushels were swept from Margate Pier and nearly the same from that of Ramsgate Harbour To walk on them might be readily compared to walking on snow on a frosty day The locality whence they first took flight remains unknown Occasionally butterflies associate together and get up a great emigration movement One of the largest of these emigrant flights probably ever seen in this country crossed the channel from France to England in the month of July 1846 Such was the density and extent of the cloud formed by the living mass that it completely obscured the sun from people on board our continental steamers on their passage for many hundreds of yards while the insects strewed the deck in all directions The flight reached England about twelve o clock at noon and dispersed themselves inland and along the coast darkening the air as they went During the sea passage of the butterflies the weather was calm and sunny with scarce a puff of wind stirring but an hour or so after their arrival in England a violent storm ensued from the South West the direction from whence the insects came Prodigious flights of the common cabbage butterfly the passage of which occupied two hours have been seen by various observers A writer in the Royal Military Chronicle states an analogous circumstance which took place in Brazil in March 1803 For many days successively there was an immense flight of white and yellow butterflies probably of the same tribe as the cabbage butterfly They were observed never to settle but proceeded in a direction from northwest to southeast No buildings seemed to stop them from steadily pursuing their course which being to the ocean at only a small distance they must necessarily perish It was singular that at the time of their transit no other kind of butterfly was to be seen though at other times the country abounds in a great variety of these insects Flights of moths are occasionally noticed under circumstances rendering it positively certain that they must be in the act of emigration from one region to another A remarkable instance of this kind is narrated in the Magazine of Natural History vol iii p 404 About seven o clock in the evening of a sultry gloomy day in August the air being peculiarly damp and oppressive a moth of a rare species called the scarce Gothic moth Phalcena typicoides was seen fluttering round the gauze covering of a French lamp In a few minutes another made its appearance and these were in a short time followed by a small number of stragglers About eight o clock heavy drops of rain began to fall and finally a tremendous shower set in accompanied with vivid lightning and loud claps of thunder The windows having been closed a pattering noise was heard at them and it was found to proceed from crowds of similar moths heating against the panes or creeping up and down in a hurried and tumultuous manner On opening the casement a rush of these fluttering intruders took place and collected thickly about the lamp With not more than two or three exceptions the mass consisted of these hitherto scarce moths Soon after ten o clock the assemblage diminished and at length the insects retired altogether and singularly enough from that hour up to the date of the communication which was four years later not a single specimen could be discovered There can he therefore little doubt that this vast flight was performing an act of itinerancy and having been overtaken by the shower was compelled to take refuge in the most convenient place they could find Mr Bennett informs us that a vast congregation of moths takes place periodically in a certain district in Australia forming apparently a mighty army of emigrants Multitudes of these little in sects which are called by the name of Bugong congregate at stated times upon masses of granite on a mountain called from this circumstance Bu gong Mountain The months of November December and January are quite a season of festivity among the poor natives who assemble from every quarter to collect these moths They are stated also to form the principal food of those who inhabit to the south of the Snow mountains In order to collect them the natives make smothered fires under the rocks on which they congregate and thus suffocating them with smoke collect them by bushels and then bake them by placing them on heated ground Thus they separate from them the down and wings and the bodies are then pounded and formed into cakes resembling lumps of fat which are smoked and will thus keep as food for some time Sometimes a inigTation takes place of vast numbers of wasps The blind traveller Lieu tenant Holman relates in the second volume of his travels an interesting anecdote illustrative of this fact Eight miles from Grandie the muleteers suddenly called out marambundas marambundas which indicated the approach of a host of wasps In a moment all the animals whether loaded or otherwise lay down on their backs kicking most violently while the blacks and all persons not already attacked ran away in different directions all being careful by a wide sweep to avoid the swarms of tormentors that came forward like a cloud I never witnessed a panic so sudden and complete and really believe that the bursting of a waterspout could hardly have produced more commotion How ever it must be confessed that the alarm was not without a good reason for so severe is the torture inflicted by these pigmy assailants that the bravest travellers are not ashamed to fly the instant they perceive the terrific host approaching which is of no uncommon occurrence in the Campos The migrations of the locust tribes have long been familiar to us We have heard from child hood of the devastation caused by their migratory hordes Scripture repeatedly alludes to them as the chastising instruments in the hand of the Almighty Maker and Ruler of the world and its nations Egypt Africa Arabia and even Euro3e have trembled at their flight and at various periods lamented over the desolations which marked their progress Weil may the Arabians call them the army of the great God for in numbers and power no army of men ever mustered together can compare with them Their swarms have been seen of the breadth of three miles and such was the length of the host that four hours were occupied in its passage over a single spot A column of locusts five hundred miles long has been seen in India and so compact that it completely hid the sun producing in the grand and solemn language of the divine lying spired poet Joel a day of darkness and of gloominess a day of clouds and thick darkness as the morning spread upon the mountains Well may Southey call these emigrant troops a dark continuous cloud Of congregated myriads numberless The Iushing of whose Avings was as the sound Of a broad river headlong in its course In a letter written by Captain Boys to the secretary of the Entomological Society he alludes to the intense mischief produced by locusts The whole country has suffered severely from the ravages committed by locusts during the greater portion of last year 1844 and the latter end of 1843 The pink underwing species were so numerous in the terrai at the foot of the Himalayas near Bennoriel on the road to Al morah that the branches of shrubs and trees on which they settled were completely hidden by them and twigs a finger thick broken down by their weight alone The ground was one brickdust red I observed these wretches in flights extend ing for miles so thick as absolutely to obscure the sun and cause some difficulty to my palan quinbearers in getting through them as at every step they rose in swarms striking and flying against the mens faces in every direction This was in the middle of October 1843 Their armies have been seen at sea In the Massachusetts Register for 1840 an account is given of an encounter with one of these emigrant hordes four hundred and fifty miles from the nearest land The ship had been overtaken with a violent gale and soon afterwards it was surrounded by large swarms of locusts of a large size In the afternoon of the next day the sky was completely black with them They covered every part of the brig immediately sails rigging and cabin Two days afterwards the weather being moderate the ship sailed through in numerable millions of their dead bodies which lay scattered on the surface of the waters We cannot doubt that this was the method employed by the Divine Creator in the annihilation of this fearful plague of insects How deep our cause for gratitude to Him who orders the movements and appoints the course of these destructive migrations that it has pleased Him even while they have been permitted to desolate neighbouring countries to spare our land from the infliction of this scourge Locusts of the migratory species have been occasionally seen even in England and the alarm has been given that a swarm of the destroyers might be expected But such has never yet been the case an ever watchful and gracious Providence has put a fence round the shores of our island and has not suffered the pest to come nigh our dwelling The migrations of other insects of turnip flies of dragonflies of beetles and even of bugs have been commemorated by various writers But the instances selected in this chapter are sufficient to set the fact before us in that degree of prominence which its singularity and interest demand of the insect historian And from these instances it will sufficiently appear that although insects like men emigrate from place to place desert one region and colonise another sometimes being true emigrants leaving the parent settlement without affecting the state of affairs in the latter and sometimes being only wanderers the whole body migrating from one to another locality yet that the motives which apparently influence the insect tribes are only in a few instances strictly analogous to those which lead to or even necessitate human emigration From what has been detailed in this chapter on the subject of insect emigration it appears that the departure of a society or of a congregated multitude of insects is not in every instance produced by the same cause or causes and that occasionally the causes leading to the movement are involved in the deepest obscurity The most common of all causes are those to which allusion has already been made want of room and scarcity of provision Bees confined and cabined within a city whose extent is fixed and unalterable have no alternative left to them on the increase of their numbers but to throw off a swarm of emigrants and thus relieve the plethora under which the community is labouring Ants on the contrary have every facility for extend ing their city should it so please them They have but to set some of their labouring thousands to the task and it would not fail of execution But as if apprehensive that dangers of some kind or another would arise if the community became too populous they seek a wider dominion in a more favourable region As if however to teach us how little we are really able to enter into the motives which actuate the insects their emigrations appear frequently to be the result of caprice or even of accident Insect historians have been also baffled in their attempts to explain the causes which lead to the emigration of the vast flocks of insects not commonly living in society So little is at present known of the causes concerned in the production as it were suddenly of innumerable myriads of in sects which is occasionally observed the multitudes appearing rather as if they had been created on the instant than as having had to pass through the various tedious stages of insect development that it is almost vain to expect an explanation of their singular emigrations Yet who can carefully consider the fact of the sudden and simultaneous departure of millions of beings from a country which if permitted to remain would deposit inconceivable numbers of eggs to give birth in due time to destructive and voracious larvae without the inward conviction that such an event cannot be the result of accident but forms a part of the wondrous scheme of Divine Providence It appears in truth that emigration is a means employed by the Creator in the removal and subsequent destruction of these creatures the numbers and voracity of whose progeny might render them otherwise as they have often done a terror and a scourge to mighty kingdoms When these swarming emi grants proceed in their expedition they become the prey of numerous enemies Birds the swift foes of the insect tribes sweep off their numbers and insect enemies prey at their ease upon them The very elements appear leagued against them Boisterous winds dash them to the ground or drown them in the waters Finally man him self takes the field against the invaders and in various ways causes the destruction of thousands Nothing in short appears more plain than the inference that in a large number of instances of the class to which these belong emigration is a Divinely appointed means of riddance to a country from a dangerous though insignificant order of beings A precisely parallel instance of emigration and on an equally great scale and apparently with a precisely similar object in view is to be found in the animal world The lemmings a species of rat at certain periods set out in emigrating armies not less numerous than those of insects They march in a direct line for the ocean and after swimming about in it for a little while are all destroyed So with the swarms of butterflies aphides and other insects the prey of their enemies the sport of the tempest and destroyed of man the vast host is dispersed and ultimately so completely annihilated that scarcely a single individual that once formed a member of its ranks can be dis covered CHAPTER 11 THE CITY What well appointed commonwealths where each Adds to the stock of happiness for all Wisdoms own bowers where professors teach Eloquent lessons in their vaulted hall Galleries of art and schools of industry Stores of rich fragrance orchestras of song What marvellous seats of hidden alchemy The foregoing account of the process by which the insect tribes diffuse themselves over their various kingdoms exhibits somewhat of the intelligence and activity displayed in the lives and habits of these minute creatures but if we would get an insight into insect doings calculated to fill us with speechless astonishment they must be watched in their relations to one another and to the community at large as fellow inhabitants of a common abode or city Insects are now to be studied in their life as citizens and the subjects of some sort of government And here it will be evident that insects at large are not included in these remarks The social insects are truly a wonderful part of the creation of God and the order and regularity of their government entitle them at all times much more in a perturbated period like our own to the respect if not even to the instruction of man kind In treating of insects in their capacity as citizens the occupants of a common dwelling or rather town it is necessary to observe that how ever much the facts detailed wear the appearance of extravagance or even of invention they are strictly true they are the result of the prolonged repeated and direct observations of men whose acquaintance with the little beings described has been that of a lifetime Although therefore they may appear almost incredible they are as rigidly matters of fact and discovery as are those of any other science whatsoever Insect history is so full of wonders that can be well substantiated that it can well afford to lose all extraneous ornament In the constitution of insect society as in that of human it is important to remark that there are certain distinct classes into which the individuals comprising the community are divisible There are differences of administration of occupation of character and of quality or rank The most perfect models from which our observations can be taken are the societies of ants and of bees Here we find that the insectcity is ruled upon the most strict principles of political economy and though after all it may be true that the terms of queens of subjects of constitutions and of republics are not to be taken according to their strict letter and present but a poor and imperfect image of human forms of government in the constitution of which the members have the advantage of reason and of the Holy Word of the King of kings yet an analogy sufficiently close may be drawn be tween the humble insects and ourselves to war rant the restricted application of these terms to their societies Let us take a glance at the constitution of affairs among the inhabitants of an Insect City to be found in most country flower gardens In this realm then from time immemorial society has been divided into three classes each distinct from the other Of these the chief person in the empire is the queen monarch who occupies the throne and is regarded with the profoundest veneration by all classes of her subjects Next come the male citizens commonly called drones and next the labouring part of the community otherwise known as neuters These classes form the three essential members of society in this important kingdom The queen in conformity with her exalted station is distinguished from the rest of her subjects by a more stately gait by the shortness of her wings and the greater length of her royal frame Her colours also distinguish her from the vulgar crowd by their peculiar depth and brilliancy A part of her person is of a brilliant black and her hair is a rich copper colour The male part of the population are large burly fellows which make a great noise in the world but are little esteemed and are at stated times massacred without mercy by the other inhabitants as useless persons and as Bee is that selected in the text for the illustration of the constitution of Insect Society they do not carry weapons this is effected without difficulty by the other well armed members of the community The last class by far the most numerous is the labouring class They are the smallest members of the society and in addition to other characteristics they may be known by the peculiar pockets of which like good housewives of old they carry one on each side of the thighs They are provided with a keen envenomed weapon straight hard and glittering which upon undue provocation these re doubtable labourers are rather fond of unsheathing and putting into use In addition to these three prominent divisions of society the historians of this kingdom have occasionally made mention of a fourth class which they have denominated Captains They are ornamented with a peculiar topknot of a light colour which may be likened to the military officers plumes but it does not appear that they have any peculiar class of duties to fulfil and very unlike our captains they do not think it beneath their dignity to work build and perform every description of labour that is performed by the labouring classes generally A celebrated historian of these citizens Francis Huber informs us that at times he has noticed some of them whose complexion was dark or nearly black Al though these unfortunates appear to be in all respects as good members of the community as the rest although like others they toil in the field and flower garden and on the heathery hill and although no difference in the world between them and the labouring classes is to be detected excepting in the matter of their dusky hue yet the black citizens are persecuted and oppressed by the others and are driven ignominiously out of the kingdom In vain the plea Am I not a sister in vain their willingness to share in all the duties of subjects they are expelled to seek in the world without the home which their inflexible parent country has denied them Alas the black part of the insect population are not the only beings who are persecuted because of their complexion Such is the constitution of society in this realm Before however we enter upon the history of the social economy of this kingdom it is right to advert to the various offices discharged by the three classes of society her majesty the labourers and the burly drones The queen is the parent of her subjects not in that metaphorical sense in which this expression is understood in its application to earthly monarchs This queen is really and truly the mother of all the inhabitants of her kingdom The labouring classes perform the whole drudgery of the kingdom rear the young collect and store the provision and are the great architects and executers of all the buildings in Apia The drones are a sad do nothing set they are the hangers on of society and though necessary to the existence of the race they play a very inconspicuous part in the conduct of affairs Living an indolent life of ease revelling in sweets collected from flowers and quaffing the dewdrop on the spray they spend a short sunshiny life and generally perish as ve have said by the hands of their fellows Let us now look a little more narrowly into the affairs of this interesting kingdom As in duty bound let our first respects be paid at the royal court and as is unfortunately rather too much the case with earthly monarchs since the royal proceedings have been watched in the minutest particulars we are able to furnish a very complete sketch of all that goes on within its precincts For this we stand indebted to various famous reporters of the court affairs by name Reaumur Bevan Huber Kirby and Spence and others No place is so wonderful as the royal nursery In order to observe the events which pre sent themselves to our notice here it is necessary that we should consider the kingdom to have been by some accident deprived of its monarch The lamentations ended the workers set about the extraordinary task of making a new queen For this purpose they select one or more larvae of those already snugly ensconced in waxen cradles They determine its destiny and while it sleeps the honour is thrust upon it of being heiress presumptive to the throne The workers cut away the walls of the bedchambers of two other larvae which they destroy to make room for the royal infant They then alter the direction of the royal cell from the longitudinal to the vertical position lengthening it as the young princess grows She is also now fed with a highly delicate and pungent food called royal jelly and it is supplied to her so profusely as more than to satisfy all her requirements The result of all this care lavished upon her in common with one or two other of her royal sisters who are similarly treated is to produce the most remarkable alteration in the nurslings Had they been permitted to remain quietly in their cells they would have become members of the labouring class As it is fostered by the food they receive and mysteriously affected by the altered position and circumstances in which they are placed they become endowed with all the remarkable characteristics which distinguish the royal family from the common people In more common circumstances when the royal family are placed in suitable apartments from their birth the same steps are not necessary but the young princesses are as in the former case fed with the royal food and tended with the most affectionate solicitude The inhabitants deprived of their former monarch in consequence of her having taken her de departure in company with a band of emigrants look forward with great anxiety to the birth of the royal princess and at this time the public mind in the city is agitated by the oft repeated inquiry Is our sovereign born yet Until this auspicious event takes place public affairs can scarcely be said to be established in exactly their regular order All classes of her subjects are awaiting the moment when the joyful intelligence shall fly through the streets and reecho along the hexagonal habitations of the city The queen is born All this time however a royal guard is placed at the door of the apartments of the slumbering princesses The careful sentinels remove a portion of the door through which they can observe the condition of the royal infant The time at length comes and out of the number of the royal bedchambers which are thus guarded it is evident from the behaviour of the sentinels that in one the princess is born And now we might imagine the citizens all anxiety to behold their newborn queen and to liberate her from her apartment Quite the contrary As if in order to give her time to gain strength she is not at once exposed to the vulgar gaze but a little hole is made in her bedchamber door through which she is sup plied with food Her strength matured the sentinels fall back and the queen emerges in majesty finely and delicately formed and is instantly received with joy by her affectionate subjects But from the other royal cells a plaintive note may be distinguished which proceeds from the captive princesses there conffned The newborn sovereign answers back to the hoarse piping of the captive in the shrill tones of bee language PEEP PEEP What may be the precise translation of these words it is difficult to say But it is painfully evident that they portend no good to the unhappy captive For the young queen rushes to the cell in which her rival is confined and would instantly destroy her were she not respectfully restrained much against her royal will by the guard which surrounds her There is now the greatest ferment in the city possible Public excitement reaches its highest pitch and the kingdom almost becomes too hot for its inhabitants 104 Fahrenheit Another princess is born and flies for refuge to a crowd of excited citizens who how ever have little compassion upon her As the law of primogeniture is inflexible in the city the first born is the natural heiress to the throne and all others are necessarily usurpers and must be treated as dangerous to the commonwealth The elder princess therefore furiously attacks the younger and a deadly conflict may now be witnessed in the streets of the city the inhabitants looking on with approbation or even inflaming the royal combatants against each other Their glittering poniards are drawn they rush upon each other there is a deadly struggle wing to wing limb to limb At length the elder princess seizing a favourable opportunity plunges her weapon deep into the panting body of the younger she quivers the deadly venom steals through her frame her limbs relax their hold her wings are spread out in the spasm of approaching dissolution and falling backwards she breathes her last leaving the victorious queen surrounded by the unpitying lookers on the undisputed ruler over the realms This deed of violence accomplished the queen destroys her remaining rivals and is now the acknowledged monarch of all she surveys She is treated too with royal honours Some historians narrate that in her task of depositing eggs she is accompanied by a royal bodyguard but this does not appear to be the case It is however certain that when it pleases her majesty to move among her subjects they regard her with unbounded respect and the true court etiquette of never turning the back upon the sovereign is observed with the utmost punctiliousness for the citizens whenever the Queen Melissa by name comes near them instantly turn round and keep their heads towards her Wherever she moves along the streets of the city they instantly clear the way and form a circle around her occasionally during the royal progress paying her those marks of homage which are customary in their kingdom A pleasant spectacle it surely is to behold the Queen thus proceeding along the streets of the city her gait so measured stately and queen like her mien so right royal and majestic and all her movements so characterized by the grace be fitting her station and all perceived and honoured by crowds of her loving subjects It is a sight worth seeing and as the realm not unfrequently lies within the narrow limits of a flower garden it is a sight which many may see if they will observe It is our pleasing duty now to advert to some of the proceedings of the commoner classes Let us follow a hand of emigrants to their new home and we shall observe how cities are founded and public works executed by this people The labouring classes or workers are divided into two orders to each of which a distinct office is assigned and exactly fulfilled The function of the first of these classes is the collection of the materials for the construction of the city that of the second is the more delicate and difficult task of its manipulation and of its employment in the building The sex of these industrious inhabitants is the female but they are not destined to become parents except when by accident the queen has been lost and a larva which would otherwise have become a labourer is selected to be made into a fertile mother and queen in the manner described The citizens being comfortably settled in their new quarters immediately commence the foundation of their city The collectors are des patched far and wide into the fields and forests for material wherewith to give a sort of varnish to the walls of the wooden cavity in which they have established themselves From the bursting buds of trees they gather a tenacious gummy substance called propolis which they apply to this and other purposes This done the walls must next be raised The collectors having laden themselves with the ambrosial food of the gardens they have visited return to their home quarters and here in a very odd manner they hang themselves up in festoons for a whole day At the close of this period by a curious process of vital chemistry little plates of wax are found formed in four pockets contained in the abdomen The collector now proceeds to make these plates available to the work in hand and going to the top of the cavity where the city walls are to be first founded draws this beautiful material from its pockets and by a combined process of chewing moulding and mixing forms out of it a little mass which is then fixed to the wall of the cavity Similar steps are taken by a number of other collectors and a mass of ductile easily managed substance is now raised which constitutes the foundation of the walls The true architects now engage upon the work This they commence by excavating in the foundation thus laid a small cavity which is by successive labour deepened so as to form the commencement of a chamber Employing those curious organs of sense the antennae to explore the whole of the work thus carried on it is performed with an accuracy neatness and despatch with which no human labour can endure comparison Un directed by a single ray of light or at best by a very dim and profitless glimmering through the open portal of the hollow where they have settled their work bears the scrutiny of the keenest eyes and even of assisted sight The collectors continue bringing in fresh materials elaborating wax and thus keep the architects constantly supplied with material for their task The walls of the chambers are now raised and they assume the peculiar hexagonal character by which they are known The work rapidly proceeds House is joined on to house all constructed with the same skill and accuracy as the earliest ones In a day or two the city has grown to a considerable extent and bids fair to become one of the most prosperous of its kind The houses vary in form and in size The royal nurseries are the largest and may be easily recognised by their being vertically instead of horizon tally placed The builders labour with scarcely an intermission and since nature would be exhausted by this excessive toil were they not well fed during its continuance a portion of this class of the community is charged with the office of supplying them with food which is very faithfully and freely executed there being an infinite degree of mutual respect and affection exhibited by the inhabitants in their behaviour toward each other The crevices are all securely stopped with the resinous gum to which we have before alluded It is also em ployed to secure the stability of the outworks of the city and hardening into a brownish substance insoluble in water it serves a variety of useful ends in the building operations of this community Some of the dwellings constructed with so much care and perseverance and with the most admirable economy of material and space are de voted to one purpose some to another In these the infant male population are nourished and brought up to return but a poor equivalent in the way of labour and usefulness for the attention and affectionate care exercised towards them in their hours of infancy In these the royal princesses are developed in all their fair proportions and in a third class the humble dwellings of the city are born the most laborious useful and probably the most happy members of the society the working citizens In others again are contained rich stores of provision Of these some are sealed up and are not allowed to be opened excepting during the existence of famine or during a bad state of the crops that is of such crops as are of importance to our insect tribe the flowers and their pollen But others are the larders of the city and are liberally kept open for the supply of the daily necessities of such of its inhabitants as are at home and in need The general aspect of this city is highly pleas ing Its buildings are all constructed on the most just principles of mathematical science Its streets are beautiful regular in their arrangement and sufficiently wide to permit two of the inhabitants to walk abreast there begin no vehicles known within its walls To the lovers of architectural fancies it might appear that the general character of the edifices was a little too regular and its streets in this respect widely differ from our own in which no house is like its neighbour But the lover of uniformity of neatness and skilfulness of arrangement has little to desire in their contemplation only that the parallel between human and insect habitations in these respects were a little closer Above all it is necessary to notice that the most extreme attention is paid by the citizens to sanitary measures Their system of warming and ventilation is unique and complete of its kind If the reader will pursue the following directions he will have a practical experience of the perfect efficiency of the plan adopted by a citizen when anxious to become warm or to communicate warmth Let him place himself in a suitable position in a closed room in temperate weather and begin to breathe by a voluntary effort more quickly than natural Let the forced respirations be continued and increased in depth and frequency and presently the temperature of the experimenters body will begin to rise and if not exhausted by his efforts he will be able to put himself into a genial glow from head to foot The citizen does exactly this There is a period in the lifetime of the young when an elevated temperature is necessary to its development As there are no sources of artificial heat in the city no fuel and no stoves or fire places some other resource must be adopted The affectionate and careful being who is watch ing over her young charge places herself near it and begins to breathe exactly in the manner described Respiration in all creatures being in fact a sort of combustion of low in tensity heat is thus abundantly produced and the tender frame of the young as well as that of her guardian and nurse soon glows with invigorating warmth The general temperature of the whole city is maintained says Mr Newport during the period when the citizens are active solely by their respirations and the heat thus created rises at times to a very high degree The ventilation of the city is likewise tho roughly accomplished in a very simple and ingenious manner for an account of which we are indebted to the indefatigable Huber The labourers are the class to whom is also entrusted this important task Ignorant of machinery instructed only in the perfect use of those beautiful appendages the wings with which an all wise God has endowed them and acting in the most complete concord and as if animated by one mind and under the direction of one chief they station themselves in gangs near the en trance of the city and then by fanning at an in tensely rapid rate they produce such a current of air as to preserve the entire atmosphere of the city in the most pure and healthy condition When one set is exhausted its place is occupied by a fresh set Their labours are continued without intermission in warm weather day and night In other respects also these citizens set a notable example to the inhabitants of greater cities than their own They are extremely neat in all their domestic arrangements No excrementitious matter is allowed to pollute the streets of the city their avenues are all kept scrupulously clean and dirt of all kinds is swept out of the town The dwellings so soon as emptied by the development and completion of the young are rigorously cleaned every particle of untouched food or of excrement is swept out the entrance damaged by the escape of the former inhabitants is repaired and neatness and order are thus rapidly restored to it Beyond what may be gathered from the pre ceding observations we can furnish little account of the civil government of this community The queen herself though respected cannot be said to be obeyed She has therefore no Privy Council nor Ministers of State Neither does there appear to be any centralization of the governing power Yet the concord of the actions of the citizens their division of labour their strict discipline and admirable social arrangements are as complete and regular as if all were de fined by a Statute book and enforced by numerous civil dignitaries and officials An intruder queen is imprisoned and hemmed in by a body of police until she dies for her treason Again as we have before hinted at certain periods there is a massacre of the whole population of the Drones who are felt to have become only an incumbrance to the community and the devourers of the spoil gathered by the labours of others Sometimes our industrious citizens are at tacked by a formidable enemy in the person of the deaths head hawkmoth This creature gorges itself with honey and in time greatly impoverishes a hive To resist the entrance of this intruder the bees have recourse to a re markable expedient They proceed to fortify the entrance to their city in the most scientific manner Their fortifications are remarkably ingenious Sometimes they consist simply of a wall thrown up inside the gateway perforated with holes just sufficient to admit the workers at its upper part Sometimes several bulwarks behind etich other are formed so as to resemble the bastions of a fortified town Sometimes a series of intersecting arcades are formed which permit free egress and ingress to the bees but refuse admittance to their bulky foe These fortifications are massive and their substance solid and compact In addition to these fortifications the entrance to the hive is always guarded by sentinels By night when the moon is up when the rest of the hive is asleep when nocturnal insects are roaming over hill and dale the faithful bee sentry keeps watch and patrols before the gate way of the hive the antennm stretched out straight before its body and the insect on the alert to catch the slightest sound All these and various other features of the social economy of these wonderful citizens might lead us to and even seem to warrant the belief that a regular government and laws were publicly recognised by the members of the society That is however more than can justly be said for though such are the results we shall look in vain for an explanation of them in any ideal central governing power or body amongst them selves Perhaps one of the most immense cities of insects on record is one of which the Texas Telegraph paper gives the following ac count In a cavern on the right bank of the Colorado about seven miles from Austin there is an immense hive of wild bees On a warm day a dark stream of bees may be constantly seen winding out from the cavern like a long dark wreath of smoke The stream often appears one or two feet in diameter near the cliff and gradually spreads out like a fan growing thinner and thinner at a distance from the cavern until it disappears The number of bees in this cavern must be incalculably great probably greater than the number in a thousand or ten thousand ordinary hives The oldest settlers say that the hive was there when they first arrived in the country and it is quite probable that it existed in the same state many years previous to the settlement of this country It was estimated that there are many tons of honey and wax in this immense hive and if its contents could be extracted readily they would doubtless be found far more valuable than those of any silver or gold mine that adventurers have been seeking for years in that section In our own country wasps are known as the inhabitants of cities of papier mache made with exquisite delicacy and skill but their habits and economy are not so interesting as the occupants of a common habitation as those of the store gathering bees In the British Museum how ever there is a wasp city found suspended to the branches of a tree on the banks of a river in South America which actually contains a store of wild honey The apertures for egress and ingress to this wasp city are constructed with admirable ingenuity in order to carry off the rain which is conveyed away by a pent like projection over the doorways The nest is constructed of dried rushes underwood and dried excrement of the tapir The jaguar is the most terrible foe to these wasp cities He springs upon their well stored nest dashes it to the ground and then shields himself from the enraged citizens under the dense foliage below Ihe wasps mi grate elsewhere and the jaguar when all are gone comes forth to feed upon the honeyed treasures of their ruined city The scattered frag ments of wasps nests thus destroyed by these animals are frequently met with in the woods Deep in an open space in the midst of a well grown forest where the foot of man has not trodden and where insects birds and beasts are the only animated inhabitants lies another city It is a city of a conical shape so far as the portion of it which is not subterranean is concerned and somewhat resembles the dome of a haystack being roofed over with a collection of sticks straws leaves and various little odds and ends of matters These assist to protect the city over which they lie from rain and other casual ties and are also useful in forming a nonconducting material which preserves the inhabitants of the city from the effects of severe cold To get a glimpse of the interior of this city we must resort to the expedient adopted by the fabulous Asmodeus and we must gently lift the conical roof up Within we shall find the most beautiful order and arrangement reigning over all Halls vaulted chambers and pillared galleries present themselves to the eye in every direction There are spacious buildings the walls constructed of well tempered soil with which on the same principle as our brick layers intermingle hair with their mortar with a view to its better cohesion fragments of straw c are worked up and provided with various adits and avenues communicating with different parts of the city and with the open air outside In the centre of the city especially the visitor will observe a spacious town hall To this the various streets conduct the inhabitants and here they commonly reside in great harmony for the citizens love society and prefer the companionship of their fellow citizens to the retirement of private life The architecture of this city is not marked by the exquisite regularity of the former city the chambers are rough and rugged and are less finished than those and although a certain general character pertains to the erections and excavations for the city is a combination of both yet to the eye of an inhabitant of the other city and to our own they want that regularity and neatness inseparable from the truly beautiful even in insect architecture The population equally with the others is divided into a royal personage males and the labouring class workers or neuters The queen by name Rufa enjoys the dignities of her position almost to a greater extent than queen 3fe lissa Wherever she appears she is treated with infinite respect and affection It is even said that she has a bodyguard of Amazonian warriors and it is certain that in the spacious halls of the city her presence communicates gladness to every inhabitant of the city having the privilege of approaching her majesty Many a pleasant scene may be witnessed in the streets and squares of this city When she takes her royal walks therein attendants press round her make presents of viands to her brush every speck of dirt from her train and such is their joy that it is even said the citizens dance around in playful merriment as she condescends to present herself to their notice And truly queen Rufa is an estimable princess Her disposition strongly contrasts with the vindictive jealous and excitable queen Melissa She is never seen like the latter in a sulky fit nor attempting to destroy her sister princesses in a spasm of furious jealousy On the contrary sometimes two sometimes even three queens reign together in harmony Her character is beautifully shown in the fact that at the very foundation of the city her first act was to strip herself voluntarily of her wings so rendering it impossible for her ever to forsake her subjects or wander from her home In her progress from street to street her kind attendants will some times lead her gently along at others will insist upon the pleasure of carrying her over diffi cult and rough places She with her usual amiability of spirit graciously receives and ac knowledges these little acts of affection and endeavours to give as little inconvenience as possible to her loyal bearers Little wonder then that queen Rufa is beloved honoured and affectionately received by her subjects who even after her death tenderly wait upon the lifeless corpse and with an undiminished affection caress and tend it as in the days when she moved in the streets of the city the joy and pride of its in habitants The life of the male citizens is short and their end is commonly sudden They therefore play but a minor part in the conduct of affairs The labouring class or workers are highly bustling and important personages in this city Though they are females yet upon them devolves all the labour and strange to add all the military ope rations of the states They plan they build they excavate they fortify they take care of the young they collect and they distribute the provisions in a word they do all the multifarious work required to be done in their city It would occupy a volume nay it has already occupied volumes to narrate the whole proceedings of the city We can in this place do little more than simply indicate the functions discharged by the highly useful and important members of this in sect community the labouring citizens The duties of the workers commence with the dawn of day Soon as the early sunbeam lights upon the summit of the city its inhabitants some of whom have been watching for the morn ing are all in a bustle The infant population must be taken out thus early for an airing and then in a quarter of an hour must go back to the nursery for fear of a sunstroke These precious little infants are a sad plague to their patient attendants They require very frequent feeding and as they are like all infants perfectly helpless beings the poor nurses have enough to do to supply the mouths of some eight or nine thousand nurslings They also must be kept very clean and are frequently cleaned from head to foot Notwithstanding all this labour and care the nurses love their little charges with an affection not surpassed by any parent although strange to say they are not their own but are every one the offspring of good queen Rufa In addition to these duties the labourer has to pro vide for her own sustenance She has also to carry the eggs larva9 and pupae backwards and forwards to various parts of the city her movements in this respect being as much directed by the state of the weather as are our own Besides all this this patient and indefatigable labourer has to attend to the repair and reconstruction of the city to provide fresh accommodation for its increasing population and to fortify it in such a way as to render it accessible with difficulty by any enemy As even ing closes in the approaches to the city are all barricaded huge masses of wood twigs are thrown across the various entrances which are also contracted by masses of such other materials as are nearest to hand The whole population then secure in its dome covered city retires to rest for the night A sentinel or two commonly keep guard outside And here let us bid this wondrous city with its sleeping thousands good night Let us here drop the guise under which we have hidden the humble insects bees and ants What is the conclusion at which we are compelled to arrive on a review of their habits and of the marvels of their government None other than this the laws which regulate them are written within them by the finger of that great and adorable Being who chooses to make the most despised creatures the living epistles of His wisdom goodness and power that being known and read of all men they may glorify Him who thus makes weakness strong and insignificance the very exhibition of His glorious creative attributes Their proceedings are explicable in no other way Let us therefore as we behold these insect commonwealths united in their works and admirably organised in their social relationship give to Him whose right it is the praise and glory which in their creation at His hands these insects and all His works were designed to show forth It is interesting to turn from those beautiful instances of insect order and to notice even though in a less perfect degree the management of the cities as we shall continue to call them or in other words of the common abodes of other insects besides the bees and ants The latter insects it will have been remarked occupy a very unimportant part in the affairs of the city or kingdom during their infancy They are de posited in appropriate cradles There they pass through all their changes as larvce then as pupce and it is only when they emerge as perfect beings or in the full developed imago state that they take a prominent part in the business of the common wealth Then instantly that they are born they assume their duties and as it is said by some before the day of their birth has closed before the sun which rose and saw them still slumbering in the pupa case has gone down into his gilded couch again they have tried their young powers over the field and hillside and have returned laden with spoil which they deliver up to the hungry architects of the walls The insects to which we are now about to refer on the contrary exist together as fellow citizens only while in the larva state Their social tie is simply a community of habitation which each individual assists in the construction of and their fellowship is merely the fellowship of fellow lodgers and fellow feeders These insects are among the commonest of entomological objects Upon fruit trees we very frequently see disfiguring the smaller branches thick and strong whitish webs If one of them is taken down and examined its interior will present at that time when it is full of its insect inhabitants a very pleasing spectacle Pleasing it should be said however only to those who have conquered their dislike to insects and will take the pains to give them and their proceedings that share of their attention which they abundantly deserve otherwise the sight of the interior of these beautiful structures will prove but little attractive The web is full of caterpillars Were we to observe them from what we may call the foundation of this silken city we should find the young insects proceeding to build their city in a very pretty and prudent manner This larva population numbers four hundred strong but being as soon as born but in a feeble state they do not attempt things beyond their strength but satisfy themselves with simply erect ing a little temporary tent previous to the construction of their permanent abode This they effect by forming a sort of hammock out of the leaf of the tree on which the careful parent has deposited them in the egg condition This is roofed in with silk and under one or more of these the caterpillars wisely recline patiently waiting until their strength shall have been sufficiently recruited to undertake greater things than these The work now commences in earnest The industrious workmen forgetting for a time their devouring propensities and only seeking to construct a suitable protection for their tender frames spin a thick layer of silk around the bottom of two or three twigs which constitute the tentpoles The limits of their dwelling being thus defined they proceed to carry on their labours until they have entirely enclosed a certain space with a silken roof and walls and floor their city built out of this slight but elegant material has no regular form but par takes of an angular character determined by the position of the twigs upon which it is erected Its interior is not more regular than its exterior but is divided into certain irregular apartments each having a suitable entrance to it left Here like those wild inhabitants of Sarawak about whom Sir James Brooke has told so much that is at once painful and interesting who construct common abodes which are supported upon poles at a great elevation from the ground they retire to rest during the hours of darkness A shower of rain will likewise bring them home and hence on sunshiny days they proceed to feast upon the green and pleasant food with which their city is profusely surrounded Against winter they prudently prepare by thickening their city walls and here shutting themselves up securely abide the severities of frost the inclemencies of the skies and sleeping await the coming of spring to resume their feastings and to pass through their final changes until they rise triumphantly into the air a new and winged form of joyful existence The sociality of these insects ends here When full grown they bid each other farewell and re tire to some secret spot to undergo their change from the larva to the pupa and from the pupa to the imago It is very rare to hnd insects living together in ail their preparatory stages For awhile the inhabitants of one community the occupants of one abode at which they have toiled in company they soon lose their consideration for each other and part to meet no more or to meet it may be only to fight and jostle one another in this contentious world But the charming pages of Reaumur supply us with a delightful account of some silken citizens which spend the whole of these preparatory states in company The insects which do so are called by Reaumur the processionary caterpillars for a reason which will immediately appear They are the larvrn of a kind of moth Lasiocampa processionea These insects in Reaumurs words while in their preparatory states feed together spin together rest together not only during their existence in the larva form but also even in the pupa state separating only when they become winged beings While the inhabitants of this insect community are young they have no fixed establishment but encamp on various parts of the oak trees in which they are found They construct little temporary tents which they abandon when they moult and then form others But when they are two thirds grown they set about the construction of a permanent dwelling which they will not abandon until they leave it finally This silken city they form in company and apparently chiefly carry on their labours during the night By their patient toils they rear its deli cate walls causing them to project from the trunk of the tree on which they live At a distance it looks so like a warty excrescence or a bunch of lichens which it closely resembles in colour that it is not easy to discover its real nature It is of considerable size being some times a foot and a half long half a foot in breadth and rising about four inches from the surface of the trunk Its walls consist of several layers of dense silk applied one above an other At the upper part lies the city portal near the trunk and serving both for the ingress and egress of its industrious inhabitants The entire population varies from 600 to 800 individuals Let us take our stand at the foot of one of these wooden monarchs on which the silken city and its inhabitants are found The day must be fine and warm and the hour near sunset If we carefully watch the city gate we shall presently see a cautious head emerging from it followed by the body of one of the inhabitants The gate is scarcely large enough to permit two abreast to pass through another immediately follows close upon the heels of the first and another and another until a moving cord of insects is seen streaming up the rugged sides of the oak every insect being so closely applied to that before it as to leave no perceptible interval between their bodies They are conducted b a chief which occasionally halts for the more regular formation of the line of march They are then seen again in movement and with all the regularity of a regiment of soldiers Their mode of marching is somewhat as followsThe chief goes first with a regular measured tread next follow in a line one or two or more which keep close behind the first then come a few two abreast these are succeeded by some three abreast these by some of four five or even six abreast or more until the whole marauding army has defiled out of the city When the chief halts all instantly halt when he marches all immediately march too and whatever be the line of his march all follow it to the very last individual of the troops It is a truly ludicrous spectacle to behold the leader thus exactly imitated by some five or six hundred followers and to observe how rigidly every individual follows the line of march however crooked or round about it may prove Having reached at length the foraging ground generally some cluster of green leaves the whole army encamps upon it and begins to feast where we must leave our little citizens to satiate themselves until the mornings light warns them to return home which they do with almost as much regularity as they set out Reaumur says that although the inhabitants of this insect republic observe such excellent military discipline and invariably follow the chief at their head yet that in reality all the individuals of the community are of equal rank and the leadership is very probably a mere matter of accident Their time of change approaching they addi tionally fortify their city and assembling together within its silken sides spin their cocoons in company and bid for a time farewell to each other and the world without The period of their release approaches their last glorious change is accomplished and for ever quitting the beautiful structure which had so long protected them from the heat rain and cold they separate to become the parents of families as numerous and as interesting in their habits as that of which themselves once formed a part The larvae of several other species of moths form for a time similar associations and construct similar habitations Even the strict disciplinarians about whom we have just been speaking find their parallel in others of a different species Bonnet has described the proceedings of the larvae of a moth which march after each other some in straight lines others in curves of various inflection As the bodies of these are of a fiery golden hue they present a very agreeable sight moving in file over the delicate white and silvery webs which they construct as a sort of soft causeway for their feet in the path between the city and the pasturage The silken cities after the final changes of their former inhabitants become the favourite abodes of spiders or of other insects which find their way into them Reaumur in his pleasant way speaking of the silken abodes of the processionary caterpillars after they have deserted them says Those who have felt so much interested in the account I have given of the nests of these insect republics as to be tempted incautiously to examine them would have great cause for complaint were I not to caution them against carelessly meddling with these nests particularly when they are filled with worms or when the insects have quitted them altogether The first time I noticed them I happened to find a large number rather too large a number I separated many from the trees and on examining them covered my hand with their remnants The result of this in caution was that presently Reaumur felt severe stinging and pricking points in his hands and between the fingers His face too began to smart and one of his eyes in a few hours became as much inflamed as if he had been suffering under a violent catarrh so much so that he could scarcely open it He quaintly says It is some consolation for every sufferer to be acquainted at least with the cause of his suffer inofs He therefore endeavoured to detect the o cause of these disagreeable effects and found it to lie in the detached hairs of the silken citizens which were so hard and sharp as to penetrate the skin without difficulty Several of Reaumurs friends experienced the same annoyance and among them four ladies who were merely walking near the naturalist and did not meddle with the objects of his curiosity found their necks covered with inflamed patches of skin which were very painful We may be sure Reaumur meddled with these silken dwellings as little as possible afterwards But wishing to draw one he directed one of his attendants to smear his hands with oil and detach a nest from the tree The man full of confidence in the remedy proposed by his master little though the latter felt of hope as to its success willingly executed the commission and tore down several nests disturbing them much more than there was the slightest occasion for In less than a quarter of an hour says Reaumur both hands were completely covered with red and painful elevations of the skin which did not disappear for three or four days sub sequently Reaumur imagines that these nests powdered would form a good substitute for the ordinary blistering fly and a more speedy one in operation Mr Westwood to return to our more immediate topic has described a singular moth city found in the hollow interior of a false acacia seventy or eighty years old growing in a botanic garden At about a foot high in the hollow trunk a spongy soft mass was found consisting of the remains of the pupae of a species of moth of their cocoons and of several dead moths After close examination it turned out that these were the remains of a former city and its inhabitants which had in fact stormed entered and taken possession of a nest constructed by the humble bee But little trace was now left of the original occupants of the hollow trunk for the invaders had so entirely destroyed their city and substituted their own constructions in its place that it became difficult to discover any remaining monument of the industry of the unfortunate race whose city had been sacked and its inhabitants thrust out The same author has likewise given an interest ing account of a butterfly city found suspended from the branches of trees in Mexico The walls of this city are much more dense than any which have yet been described they resemble very thick parchment in texture and in colour also Yet on examination with microscopic power this beautiful material which is as smooth as paper is found to be in reality composed of fine silken lines interwoven in every direction On cutting into the nest a most singular spectacle presented itself a number of the pupse were seen hanging vertically in the interior of the nest We might imagine an enemy had done this and hung up the wretched captives a mournful spectacle to the rest of this parchment city At an earlier period the cavity would have been found full of active larvm and of the green leaves of the spray on which it hung for their sustenance At the bottom of this parchment town were appearances which strongly favoured the supposition of an enemy having found his way into it and having ut the inhabitants to the sword for it was thickly bestrewed with gory drops Mimic patches of blood red seemed to say the carnage in the grand conflict supposed must have been frightful and the sight of these in addition to the mournful appearance represented of the hanging bodies of the inhabitants seemed to tell only too plainly of the deeds of horror and of blood that must formerly have been enacted in this miserable city But not so no enemy had brought in his inflamed troops within these walls These were the singular drops of red fluid noticed in the first part of this wmrk as commonly found after the change of the insect from the pupa to the imago state The degree of intelligence and the beautiful moral economy exhibited to us in the perfect societies of insects are greatly wanting in all other insect societies The individual members of a community of caterpillars know nothing of the forms of government which are so beautifully displayed in ants and bees and other social tribes They are true republicans Acknowledging no superior among their numbers obedient to a few rude and imperfect laws their community presents but a poor picture of order and happiness SO far as the happiness of social life is concerned But if possessing no such admirable social organization as the others yet their instinct is perfect of its kind and degree and they dwell together peacefully and in harmony and no such scenes of excitement as agitate the other communities disturb the tranquil inhabitants of the cities of silk Thus although comparatively imperfectly endowed they are in reality happy up to their capacities for enjoyment If they have not the intelligence and ingenuity of the others yet neither have they the distracting cares the tumultuous passions and the sanguinary propensities apparently excited by the force of circumstances in the breasts of the ants and bees They unite in common work for the good of the republic which they effect with accuracy and skill and their abode presents us with a picture of unity and contentment on a simple fare from which mankind might sometimes take a useful lesson No more perfect models of insect communities and of the regulation of insect cities are known than those of our humble friends the subjects of Queen Melissa and Queen Rufa We know most about the proceedings of these simply be cause they have been most closely observed of all families in the insect world And what has not patient observation disclosed respecting them What a wonderful order and government is not exhibited to us in these minute and despised creatures history Where shall we find a state the basis of whose public affairs has stood so firm not for centuries but for thousands of years Empires states kingdoms and all forms of government have in turn had their day and many have crumbled into dust But here in a society of bees is a perfect sample of a stable un altering monarchy and we behold in the government an order of affairs coeval in its origin with the very introduction of these insects into our scheme of creation From age to age matters have gone on in these states just as they did in the first hour when the Divine hand appointed them Do we ask why Then let us remember that human governments have been of mans creation and their institutions partake of that perishing nature which characterizes the works of man Upon what blood cemented foundations have not empires and monarchies been raised What vices and passions have not combined to form the creation of the kingdoms of this world Was it to be expected that matters set in motion by an evil impulse and regulated too frequently without the smallest reference to the Divine glory could or can long hold together The time of the existence of every purely human institution is measured and must at length expire But the insect world exhibits to us a durable condition of society be cause constituted by God himself and during the lapse of ages to come when it may be that human society will be again and again organized to be again broken and disrupted the humble subjects of Melissa and Rufa the occupants of the same soil will still have to rejoice in the permanence of their order and in the unaltered and unaltering character of their government and constitution Yet let us not forget that the character of insect governments and their laws of society though perfect of their kind by no means pre sent us with a model for our own organization as a community The poor insect devoid of reason plods on in the same course from year to year from one generation to another Its ingenuities were as complete and exquisite thousands of years ago as now It makes no progress and cannot avail itself of the experience of the past Its pursuits pleasures and occupations were the same yesterday as they are today and shall be until the tomorrows of the world are run out CHAPTER III THE CELL We have read in old times and now and then even in our own day we hear of such an occurrence that men disgusted with the world have repaired to the wilderness and there in a rude abode of their own construction nourished by such food as they can themselves either gather or produce spend the rest of their days in solitude Charming pictures have been drawn by the poets as to the happiness of these recluses Milton has written And may at last my weary age Find out the peaceful hermitage The hairy gown and mossy cell Where I may sit and rightly spell Of every star that heaven doth shew And every herb that sips the dew Yet there can be little doubt this happiness was purely imaginary The poet Cowper knew better the feelings of the human heart and its instinctive longings after sociality when he wrote the beautiful lines so familiar to us I am out of humanities reach I must finish my journey alone Never hear the sweet music of speech I start at the sound of my own Society friendship and love Divinely bestowed upon man 0 had I the wings of a dove How soon would I taste you again Man unlike the insect hermits into whose cells we propose to introduce the reader is a social being and was designed by God to dwell in society and there consequently will he find his true duties and his greatest happiness There too where God has graciously placed him will present themselves to him those opportunities for assisting and making his fellows happy in the fullest sense of that term which will enable him to serve God acceptably in his day and calling The insect anchorets on the contrary were designed by their Creator to be solitary beings Not endowed with social instincts capable of performing every act necessary for their own comfort and safety unassisted and generally hostile rather than otherwise to their companion species they are evidently well adapted to a private life Were they to unite into a society they would act as unnaturally and as injuriously to themselves and others as does man when he voluntarily separates himself from his fellows and under mistaken impressions buries him self in the obscure recesses of the wilderness or in dens and caves of the earth To take a single illustration in proof Some ingenious speculators some time since conceived the idea of rearing spiders artificially and of collecting the material of their webs for the purposes of manufacture and as a sort of substitute for silk But they had forgotten that the spider is in its nature a solitary insect from the moment when the young disperse from the nest The result was that furious conflicts ensued The unwilling members of this community fell upon each other with infuriate passions and the whole speculation failed in consequence although large sums of money had been expended in the undertaking and although experimentally the material produced was of good quality and suitable for the end designed Had the principle we have here insisted on been observed these experiments would never have been undertaken or at least they would have been entered upon with a pro vision for the separation of every individual in sect according to its natural habits Although we have in our present chapter only to deal with individuals and to observe their solitary cells Entomology presents us with a rich store of interesting facts upon even the unpromising subject insect life in the cell The following observations of a naturalist upon the cell of an Indian insect and its occupant pre sent us with a pleasant account of the proceedings of the careful parent in providing a suitable cell for its larva At Sangor Island in the mouth of the Hooghly I have frequently noticed the cells of insects which are built of mud by a species of Cumenes The cells are generally placed under some projection or in an angle where they are very firmly fixed They are of an oval shape sometimes two or three together placed side by side Each cell is somewhat smaller than a pigeons egg and before being closed up is well stored with green caterpillars which I have often amused myself by watching the Emnenes carry into the cells When the cells are sufficiently stored they are filled up so very neatly with mud that it is difficult to discover the entrance One of these nests was found in a keyhole closing the aperture another in a bungalo at Ganga Sangor was beautifully constructed inside an old flute the insect having chosen one of the note holes for the entrance to the nest At Mud Point Sangor I observed several of these nests already built and sealed up others the Eumenes were storing with caterpillars while some were in progress of completion Here securely enclosed the insect feeds and fattens upon the store of food laid up for it and passes from one stage of its development to the next and from that to the last before it quits the tenement of mud which for so large a portion of its life affords a shelter to it Our own fields and hedge banks present us with a number of similar instances to many of which allusion has already been made in the first part of this work But the following sketch of the doings of a Wasp by Mr Westwood fully justifies its extraction into our pages This insect commenced digging a burrow but being disturbed by me she quitted it and proceeded to commence a fresh one close to the former when she had proceeded about the depth of her head I observed that her jaws constituted her chief tools with these she brought up particles of sand and bits of stone creeping backwards to the mouth of the cell when a little mound of sand had been accumulated she set about brush ing it further from the orifice by means of her fore legs and it was droll to see the celerity with which these limbs were moved and the shortness of time required to remove the sand which was thrown with force beyond the body of the insect the head of which was kept near to the opening of the burrow In this manner she proceeded to a depth greater than the length of her own body so that she was entirely hidden from view for several moments at a time reappearing back wards as usual with her mouth laden with sand and stones During the periods whilst thus hid den in the burrow I amused myself with pushing bits of stone larger than usual to the mouth of the hole in order to see her manoeuvres in re moving them this she entirely effected by the assistance of her jaws the legs not being employed in the task even in cases where I placed pieces of stone much larger than her own body which she moved in this manner The largest of three bits of stone was even dragged to a short distance During these operations a considerable buzzing noise was occasionally made Notwithstanding these interruptions she proceeded in her work and at length flew off Thinking she had been frightened away I left the spot but shortly returning I observed her at about a yard distance from her burrow engaged in dragging along a large smooth green caterpillar found I think upon the broom and being that of one of the NoctuidcB and I noticed that it was only by the assistance of her jaws and fore legs that she had secured her prey the latter which served her as arms being clasped round the body of the caterpillar and the four hind legs used in walk ing When about half a yard distance from her burrows she set down her prey and flew off towards the nest to see that all was right and returning again seized the inactive caterpillar as before and ascended the bank in a more direct and easy way than she had previously gone On arriving at the mouth of the cell she again laid down her prey and crept into the hole but instantly reappeared head foremost seized the head of the caterpillar with her jaws and dragged it down These proceedings did not occupy more than a quarter of an hour It will be however more interesting to present examples of habitations constructed by the insect tenants themselves Of these there is an infinite variety Perhaps one of the most singular is the stony dwelling formed apparently by the insect discovered and described by Colonel Sykes under the title of the Copris midas The following extract from the paper communicating the account of its discovery is taken from the Transactions of the Entomological Society of London At Poona in the month of June 1826 some of my palankeenbearers were employed in loosening with pickaxes a friable and decom posing mica and greenstone called mohrum for the purpose of spreading it on my garden walks instead of gravel While thus employed they turned up with their pickaxes from some depth below the surface four hard perf balls At first they considered them stone cannon shot the Poona Cantonment and its immediate neighbour hood having been the site of two great battles but observing that the pickaxe had injured one of the balls and that it was hollow they brought the whole to me I immediately satisfied myself that they were of compact clay well kneaded up with comminuted grass and very minute pebbles forming in fact a well digested mortar They were two inches in diameter and perfectly globular and without hole cicatrice or fissure The injured ball contained an amorphous animal mass which I immediately pronounced to be the pupa of an unknown species of insect at least unknown to me On removing the pupa from the broken ball the crust was found to consist of two coats the interior surface was quite smooth and formed of finer clays much more elaborated than the external coat which was some what rough The diameter of the hollow within the ball was one inch and seventenths the thick ness therefore of the crust was three twentieths of an inch Another of these balls had its chamber one inch and sixtenths and the crust was sixtenths of an inch thick To ascertain the insect proprietor of these curious domiciles I placed two of the balls in a tin box and continued for some months to watch them with attention but my patience being wearied out I abandoned further care of them and put the box away The third ball I gave to a lady who despairing of any change taking place after many months observation broke it but found the pupa inside quite fresh Thirteen months had passed away and I had forgotten the balls when on the night of the 19th of July 1827 being in my study I heard a low scratching sound It was some time before my ear directed me to the tin box containing the balls which stood upon a book case It was clear an insect was endeavouring to liberate itself This object not being effected at one o clock in the morning I retired to rest The scratching continued the whole of the 20th and until I went to bed Previously to retiring for the night to facilitate the exit of the creature I dropped water upon the ball to soften the very hard and compact crust At sunrise on the morn ing of the 21st I found the fine copris at liberty an inch and a half long and ninetenths of an inch wide now exhibited to the Society It must have been thirty four hours at work had been thirteen months in the pupa state in my possession and may have been thrice the time in the same state before it was found by my people The second ball remained unaltered nor were there any indications whatever of approaching developments in the tenant It was allowed to remain in the tin box and looked at after very short intervals of time It was however the 4th of October ere the second specimen of copris now before the Society worked its way out from its prison In what manner these curious insects enclosed themselves in such remarkable cells appears quite a mystery Not the least trace of any place at which the insect got into its stony chamber was exhibited in its walls In fact the appearance of these habitations was more that of some artificial substance manipulated externally into shape than what we should expect to be the work of an insect labouring from within Not the least mysterious part of its history is its duration for so excessively prolonged a period in the cell Rdaumur says that the life of an insect which is always shut up in the interior of a fruit can scarcely present much interesting matter for consideration But he is in error for we shall find that the life of an insect thus secluded from the world and withdrawn from observation of man kind is an epitome of interesting particulars Let us watch then its proceedings and to do this we have need only to select an apple tree infested with that woolly looking insect commonly called American blightToward eventide as the sun begins to set a beautiful little moth may be seen hovering with silver spotted wings over a young apple on the laden branch Resting a moment on the crown of one it deposits an egg deep in the cluster of little leaves at the top In process of time this becomes hatched and gives birth to an active larva This little fellow loses no time but immediately sets to work and gnaws downward into the fruit soon becoming lost to the world by burying itself in its sappy cells which are more easily pierced at this than at any other spot Eating his way through the fruit he avoids the core and so experiences no hindrance to his progress In a fortnights time he has got half way through the apple The perforation made in entering has hitherto served him for the discharge of all excrementitious matters but this becomes increasingly difficult in consequence of his size and the awkwardness of the direction of the passage He therefore resolves to construct another entrance to his luxurious apartment by which this end will become easily accomplished To do so he manifests a singular proof that his proceedings are guided by an instinct given from on high As if aware that a hole made directly downwards Would render the removal of the brown pellets of excrement quite easy he now pierces directly downwards until he has driven his tunnel to the outside of the apple This work accomplished he retires back to his apartment in the centre of the fruit and the little pellets are now rolled or pushed downwards and so fall to the ground leaving however generally a few grains sticking around the entrance And now this insect leads a life of ease and satiety Its apartment by the means last de scribed is rendered at once clean and well venti lated Without a care as to the wants of the morrow without a fear as to the accidents of the present lie spends his days in alternate periods of eating and repose No creature in this great world is more independent than he While the wild beasts suffer hunger and the tame ones suffer death he lives in a world of his own unharmed and amply provided for Yet he is alone and in the dark he has no companion to share his pleasures or the burden of his excavating labours For him the sun shines not no cheering ray can penetrate his cell None of Natures music can reach him He has enough and more than enough but he is a solitary prisoner and has not a link to bind him with the sympathies of the world Toward the close of his existence as a larva he forsakes the juicy food in which he has so long revelled and now with assiduous tooth applies himself to the destruction of the core of the fruit Here for a few days he feasts in luxury But the time draws near when our insect must quit his cell His last act of devouring has touched the seat of life in the fruit in which he dwells The apple in a little while must fall what then will become of our solitary insect hermit Will he perish in the destruction which is overhanging his dwelling a fate which he seems to merit since he has brought it about himself Our insect is far too wise for this Reaumur says I have cut open a hundred apples which had fallen to the ground without discovering more than one or two of these insects in the cavity As if warned of the approaching downfall of its tenement the insect determines to do as sailors tell us rats do in a sinking vessel to make its way out as quickly as possible This he effects by driving a round tunnel through its sides through which he creeps and emerges into the open air His first object then is to seek a hiding place for the bustling tomtits are on his track He conceals himself in some crack in the bark of a tree for the night during which his escape is made Here he remains for a day or two as if to rest himself from the fatigues of his journey Eating a little distance into the bark he there spins a beautiful cocoon of snow white silk in which the change from larva to pupa takes place and from pupa to imago Bursting at length from this delicate case the insect appears in the exquisite form of a delicate moth the most beautiful of its tribe At the close of this narrative the reader will probably agree with us and admit that for once the accurate Reaumur was at fault The insects which construct moveable dwellings present us with a most interesting illustra tion of life in the cell If a little sharp and patient observation is exercised in our daily walks we shall not be long before we detect these minute but remarkable structures They are to be found oftentimes in groups of three or four or more upon old walls covered with the scaly lichen so familiar to us and so closely resembling the latter in their colour and also so small in point of size as readily to escape observation What however we may ask was too minute for the penetrating eyes of the last named great entomologist No recess was unexplored no object connected or likely to have a connexion with his favourite study was passed by as un worthy notice and for a period of twenty years this patient observer took a deep interest in watching the proceedings of the insects we are to describe as they pitched their curious tents on the wall of the Tuileries at Paris He turned the little hermits out of their cells in order to watch how they would act and the following is his account of their proceedings Having robbed them of their houses he put them in a box to gether with some pieces of stone partially covered with lichens The insects did not seem to care for the robbery much but being very lively and active presently set to work to construct new habitations It so happened that Reaumur was prevented from observing the process throughout but he saw several before they were quite com pleted He noticed that the little tenant of this half formed cell was very active in completing its house and did so in the following manner Seizing with its mandibles such little particles of the stone as appeared to it suitable for the object in view it bound each particle into the wall with threads of silk and so added particle to particle until it had completed its dwelling An amusing sight it is to see these little hermits in their mossy cells for such is really the case Reau mur distinctly states that small particles of moss as well as of stone are employed in the construction of the cell Now the head peeps out looks this way and that way and explores the rock for suitable masses for its architecture then is lost to sight in the darkness of its little abode So diligently does the insect work that in twenty four hours the dwelling is completed Its shape is exactly that of a gentleman s nightcap in miniature So minute are these little hermitages that a lady s thimble would cover a dozen or so of them without inconvenience to the caterpillar hermits within But the most ludicrous spectacle of all only it must be watched by the aid of magnifying glasses is to see the insects move about dwell ing and all This great tower of stone for so in comparison to the insect it appears seems every moment as if it would topple over and overwhelm its inhabitant in the ruins It is never perpendicular but leans more than the leaning tower of Pisa and unlike it has not the security of a solid foundation If upon the stone on which they dwell there exist inhabitants more minute than themselves how strange and even awful the appearance of one of these stone turrets moving across the rocky plain and at the bottom the grim head and legs of a frightful giant revealing itself But fortunately for such inhabitants of these stony plains if such there be the entowered monster is a very harmless creature totally devoid of all bloodthirsty propensities and quietly subsisting upon the minute lichens which paint the wall in sober hues and communicate to it the sedate appearance of a green old age At the apex of the towers a little hole is left which serves for the discharge of excrementious matters Mr Rennie narrates the following amusing anecdote of these insects One of the caterpillars which we deprived of its tent attempted to save itself the trouble of building a new one by endeavouring to un house one of its neighbours For this purpose it got upon the outside of the inhabited tent and sliding its head down to the entrance tried to make its way into the interior But the rightful owner did not choose to give up his premises so easily and fixed his tent down so firmly upon the table where we had placed it that the intruder was forced to abandon his attempt The instant however that the other unmoored his tent and began to move about the invader renewed his efforts to eject him persevering in the struggle for several hours but without a chance of success At one time we imagined that he would have accomplished his felonious intentions for he bound down the apex of the tent to the table with cables of silk But he attempted his entrance at the wrong end He ought to have tried the aperture in the apex by enlarging which a little he would undoubtedly have made good his entrance and as the in habitant could not have turned upon him for want of room the castle must have been surrendered This experiment however was not tried and there was no hope for him at the main entrance Allied to these little architects is the following insect whose proceedings are described by Mr Saunders Having frequently noticed cases of an oblong oval shape attached to the walls of rooms in the houses at Calcutta and supposing them to be the abode of the larva of some insect I opened some of them and enclosed others in a bottle In some of the specimens examined a chrysalis was found in others a larva and in others merely exuvia of a chrysalis From those in the bottle there proceeded in time some small moths The cases are generally attached to walls or partitions by silken threads of considerable tenacity and are to be seen sometimes pendent from a beam or the ceil ing They are half an inch long by one fifth of an inch broad in the widest part nearly flat the longitudinal and transverse sections being lens shaped and margined along the sides They are open at both ends although attached to the walls at one end the attachment being so managed as not to stop the entrance The inside is lined with a silky substance the outside covered with small grains resembling sand The larva when full grown is about three tenths of an inch long with the head and first three segments of the body dark brown the remainder white It has six legs placed on the first three segments of the body two on each segment The chrysalis is of a pale yellow brown and about a quarter of an inch in length The moths were lost by an accident and therefore cannot be minutely described They approached in size the clothes moth and the upper surface of the wings were of a silvery brown The larva has the power of turning within its abode and if watched when fixed to a wall may often be seen protruding its head and legs sometimes at one end sometimes at the other as if in search of food I have always found the cases tightly fixed yet the larvae have the power of locomotion One of the larvae with its envelope which I detached from a wall and placed upon a table was very active in moving it about by protruding the head and legs and then laying hold of the table when by a contraction of the body the case was moved forward and as these jerks were rapidly repeated the larva and its abode made considerable progress When the progress of the larva was obstructed it immediately withdrew into its home and turning it self began to retreat at the other end Whilst on the table it fixed its house several times an operation so quickly performed as scarcely to be perceptible I always found the cases nearly of the same size whence we might be induced to suppose that at first the larvae had the instinct to make an abode sufficiently large to suit them selves when fully grown I could never determine the food of the larva nor the manner in which it constructs its interesting habitation particulars which I hope some other observer will supply Some insects however form moveable dwellings of a more singular and elegant kind out of vegetable substances There is a little moth the larva of which constructs a dwelling out of the leaves of the astragalus which has been compared to a petticoat adorned with deep furbelows Perhaps a better comparison would be a fools or jesters cap without the bells These little habitations are formed by the insect by cutting out portions of the leaves on which they pitch their tents and then with singular art uniting them into one structure with the addition of bands of silk and glutinous matter Their appearance in the leaves of this tree to which they appear to be confined is very curious and it might perplex the observer in no little degree if he were unacquainted with the habits and manners of the insects which belong to this tribe the tribe of moths Reaumur gravely remarks Our clothing would look very ridiculous and would be rather inconvenient were it made of little sticks artfully put together yet certain insects construct their coverings of minute portions of the blades of grass which are to them as thick in proportion as rods of wood to us These habitations are perhaps the most singular of all These little cells which differ much in their appearance from each other appear to be all constructed on the same plan There is a central tube of silk around which the fragments which form the roof of the dwelling are placed The insect by means of its mandible cuts a suitable portion out of leaves and then fastens the piece on to the exterior of its dwelling The aspect of some of these cells is very curious Some resemble minute bundles of faggots and others have an irregular odd appearance comparable to nothing else besides The pieces are laid on with consummate skill and by their strength communicate a great degree of solidity and resistance to the structure The insect which constructs a dwelling thatched with the blades of grass arranges the cut pieces in an imbricated manner like the slates of a roof or in fact like the bundles of straw in a thatch While other insects have to chop their pieces up into appropriate lengths and widths constructing them out of leaves See the insect which selects the blades of grass for this purpose has merely to cut them transversely into appropriate lengths hence there is a beautiful regularity presented by its ingenious abode These little insects when we compare their size with the material they employ are heavy laden No Roman soldier groaning under armour shield breastplate helmet sword and spear not even one of our own doughty knights boxed up in plates of steel a moving mass of iron bore a load proportionably weightier than one of our insects Yet they appear little en cumbered by having to take up their homes and walk with them on their back Strength equal to the task has been given them and they wander hither and thither over the green leaf plains and branch causeways on which they are found without an apparent effort Securely protected by the ingenious roof their own skill has erected over them from the inclemencies of the weather and from the dangerous observation of the enemies of insects birds finding also ample food beneath their feet and enjoying the full liberty of roaming about the summer long upon the waving branches of the forest theirs is a happy life and though a lonely one yet doubtless even that has its alleviations Very different from these is the next example of life in the cell to which we propose to introduce the reader We must no longer ramble in forest or field but plunge into the recesses of the kitchen and explore the natural history of the fireplace even while a blazing fire roars within it One would scarcely expect to find an insect living in comfort and happiness separated only by a brick from a fiery furnace Such however is the position voluntarily selected by our familiar friend the cricket concerning whom a great poet has falsely written that it is all the blither for the drought For the warmth had been a more correct expression During the day our cheerful insect retires within his cell and conceals himself from view Let us follow him however at night and drive him to his retreat and we shall see how comfortable a burrow he has made for him self In the space between two bricks where the mortar was unusually loose he commenced his attacks and in a little while by diligence patience and perseverance he excavated a cavity sufficiently large for his retreat Here ignorant of the luxuries of silken couches he dozes the day through living in a mimic torrid zone The night comes and he steals forth to the depredations of which he is only too guilty And now woe betide the scraps left in his way to him scummings of pots crumbs of bread salt or even wet woollen rags form a savoury diet The morning does not catch him abroad for before the sun calls other beings into activity and life he slinks away and awaits the shades of night to recommence his spoils For an equally interesting illustration we may return again from the flaming regions into which we have penetrated and seek the fields in that pleasant time when iir the words of Gilbert White of Selbourne everything is verdurous and joyous Let us seek too in his pleasant pages an account of the insect whose life in the cell we are about to describe In the months of May June or July and in some hot sandy district inclining to the afternoons sun and near some footpath we shall frequently hear the strong sharp and joyful song of our inhabi tant of the cell But we must approach with infinite caution Only let him feel the least tremor of the earth and his music is instantly stopped while he himself has disappeared from view The spade is too boisterous an instrument for our employment if we would disinter this wary and cheerful musician from his cell Gentle means are more successful and we may either do as Pliny recommends us to do insert a straw into its burrow which will quickly bring out the inhabitant or we may adopt the curious proceeding of children in France who tie an ant to a string and introduce it as a sort of bait into the cell Then we behold a strange creature truly Its body black and shining banded with yellow and its head and lobster claw shaped jaws give it a somewhat awful appearance This creature is the field cricket Aclieta campestris The cell in which it takes up its secure abode is often very deep from six to twelve inches and terminates under some overhanging rock by comparison where its oc cupant resides in security all the winter long The insect forms regular beaten tracks to its burrow and woe betide the unlucky creature which falls in its way It commonly sits at the mouth of its den waiting for wayfarers and such as come within its reach have small chance of escape still less of rescue when dragged to its subterranean dungeon keep While undoubtedly carnivorous in their propensities they are also well content when travellers are scarce and hunger presses to eat indiscriminately of the herbs growing a waving forest of green blades around their prison gate Hard by the en trance they form a little platform where they de posit all excrementitious matters Sitting in the entrance of their caverns they chirp all night as well as all day from the middle of the month of May to the middle of July and in hot weather when they are most vigorous they make the hills echo and in the stiller hours of darkness may be heard to a considerable distance In the beginning of the season their notes are more faint and inward but become louder as the summer advances and so die away again by degrees To an inhabitant of a cell whose person is yet more strange and wondrous than the last we must now introduce the reader To this creature we might almost apply with justice the wellknown words Monstrum liorrendum cq and were it only in reality half as terrible a creature as it appears it would rank among the most awe inspiring of insects But it is in reality a very harmless being its food consisting it is true of insects but it has also a taste for vegetables and particularly affects a juicy potato Yet it must be said that when excited by a fast of short duration it has been known to fall furiously upon one of its own species to fight with incredible obstinacy and alas that it should be true after destroying its opponent to fall upon and devour the corpse with great avidity This creature is the mole cricket GryllotaJpa vulgaris Its strength is vast in proportion to its size It is said to be able to lift a weight equal to two or three pounds Its cell which is excavated by its remarkable fore feet resembling hands is generally dug in moist SyWampy grounds and it particularly frequents the grounds near canals thus presenting a striking contrast to its allies which love the warmth and dryness of abode peculiar to the spots they select for their habitats On the removal of the overlying soil a curious scene is presented to the spectator the apartment in which our insect dwells is a good sized vaulted chamber carefully hollowed out in the earth but curiously enough only approachable by a number of winding caverns and passages Plere secure from invaders it takes up its abode Here its young are brought forth educated and sent out into the world Here the parent driven to its citadel by the enraged gardener lamenting over destroyed beds of cabbages and young legumes the roots of which it cuts through often meets with a violent death being either crushed by a convulsion of the surrounding soil or cleft in twain by the descent of a vast glittering instrument of iron but having a handle of woodin other words a spade We are not able to point to any district in our own country in which so curious a celloccupant exists as the next to which we have to refer This insect is a native of Australia and has been called Nycteiohkis from the circumstance of the larva only coming out of its recess at night to feed It might however be also called the trapdoor larva from the peculiarity of its dwelling to which we are about to advert Be ing deposited on the bark of a tree in the egg state it is then developed and becomes a larva This little being immediately enters into the bark and bores a cylindrical tunnel to the very centre of the stem which it increases as it grows in bulk and in which it retreats for protection and repose But the larva has many enemies Its excursions are never made without risk and the empty dwellings have too often to deplore the loss of their occupants which had only re cently quitted them The most formidable of these enemies is the extraordinary insect the walking leaf The larva that misled by their extraordinary resemblance to a leaf should in advertently come in their way is devoured with out pity To guard against these and other foes which in open contest they are totally unable to withstand the larva has recourse to a rare and beautiful contrivance by which its cell is rendered impregnable by any enemy from with out This device is the construction of a pecu liar hinged door to its cell which readily permits the egress of the rightful tenant but resists the entrance of an intruder This door is formed of a strong moveable covering of web spun by the larva and strengthened and solidified by interweaving pieces of leaves and other matters into its substance until it assumes a somewhat convex shape The door thus constructed must then be secured and this is done during the process of its formation by fastening the web securely only to tire upper end of the entrance to the cell the rest of the margin being left free and unattached The door now swings easily forward on being pushed from the inside but from the outside it can only be opened by the clever artificer that designed and hung it as a self acting valve over the entrance of its cell The weight of the trapdoor together with the inclination of the side of the tree on which it is always constructed keeps it constantly closed as effectually as if our insect had attached a door spring to its ingenious contrivance The larva having thus provided for its security proceeds to collect its food After sunset it may be seen cautiously lifting up its cell door and exploring the coast Finding all clear it pushes the door gently forwards and confident that it will of itself close behind it sallies out over the woody wilderness in the midst of which it lives Having at length fallen in with food in the shape of young leaves it cuts down as much as it can carry and slowly retreats with its green burden back to its cell being able to find its way even in the dark without difficulty On reaching the self acting door the larva insinuates its hinder end under the lower part of it and thus gently lifts it up dragging after it the leaf it has brought home by creeping back wards into the cell The burden is then deposited in safety in the cell and the industrious insect sets out on a second foraging expedition Thus the larva proceeds during the whole night But as soon as the early streaks of grey announce the sunrise it is to be seen flying precipitately into its cell and hastily lifting the door is soon hidden from view in the dark and safe retreat it has constructed To prevent the leaves slipping out of the cell as they might do by their own weight the insect frequently ties them down with silken cables to the walls of its cell The insect however is too wise to leave the trap door unsecured during the day No sooner has it made good its retreat and secured its provender than it fastens the door by strong ropes of silk which prevent entirely its being lifted b any enemy but the invincible enemy man 158 THE LIFE OF AN INSECT Sometimes the leaves are much too long to be contained within the cell and then the insect permits the lower ends to hang out communicating thereby a most amusing and singular appearance to the entrance of its cell not unlike that of a straw loft through the partially closed door of which bunches of straw are left dangling out During the day the larva feeds upon the provision his nightly excursions have furnished him with and drags up the out dangling leaves piece by piece until it has entirely devoured them But that which is an admirable safe guard to these insects from the depredations of their insect foes is the very means by which their retreat is marked out by their rational enemies of the human race The aborigines of Australia prize these ingenious mechanics as a most delicious article of diet they are consequently sought for with great assiduity and the labour even of ascending high trees in the search for them is not considered of if re warded with the capture of a few of our poor inhabitants of the cell Mr Lewin mentions another insect the larva of which constructs a cell also of a very ingenious kind Having bored its tunnel in the stem it feeds on the bark and sappy wood directly about the entrance But as this would expose it to the observation of its enemies it manages to conceal its depredations by weaving fragments of wood and bark which it gnaws off in a strong web It thus constructs at once a fortification and a disguise of considerable bulk and thickness round the stem under which like one of our military sappers and miners in a winding cylindrical pas sage the depredator constantly shelters its body while at work alternately gnawing and weaving but retiring into the central chamber to repose After its days in the larva state are completed it weaves a close door of tapestry over the entrance to its central chamber to the dark and silent repose of which it now commits itself while undergoing the final changes of its condition Soon after this tapestry door is formed the ingenious fortifications outside decay and fall off their period of utility being now completed In the decayed stumps of the singular Australian grass trees a little insect is found whose cell also deserves our attention On cutting the stem of such trees as these insects have penetrated a singular spectacle presents itself A number of minute cylindrical tubes or tunnels are seen running in various directions all however distinct from each other These tunnels are of considerable length and are lined with hangings of the most delicately white silk In these tubes a little insect dwells securely feeding on the decaying wood and undergoing its metamorphoses far from the reach of every enemy It is the larva of a species of moth Tinea Curiously enough when the pupa case is burst by the egress of the included insect it is commonly left half emerging from the tunnel On removing the bark of fir trees which have lain for some time in the timber yard we shall disclose another tenant of a cell whose proceedings have a serious claim upon our attention This insect heaving been deposited by its careful parent in a place of security between the bark and the wood no sooner awoke to active life than it commenced its destructive attacks upon the timber which sheltered it Boring its way at first in a serpentine direction it fills the space which it leaves behind with its excrement resembling sawdust and so stops all ingress to enemies from without But when this creature has arrived at its full dimensions it does not confine itself to one direction but works in a kind of labyrinth eating backwards and forwards so as to give the wood under the bark a very irregular surface Its paths are often of considerable width Its attacks are not confined to the solid timber but in its progress it eats away an equal portiofi of the bark When the insect is about to assume the pupa state it bores obliquely down into the solid wood to the depth sometimes of three inches seldom if ever less than two Its holes are nearly semicylindrical expressing exactly the form of the insect One would perhaps wonder how so small and seemingly so weak an animal could have strength to excavate so deep a mine but when we see its maxillae our wonder ceases These are large thick and solid sections of a cone divided longitudinally which in the act of mastication apply to each other the whole of their interior plane surface so that they grind the food of the in sect like a pair of millstones At the place in the bark opposite this hole the perfect insect gnaws its way out of its prison when it makes its appearance retiring in fact by the same passage which the larva had excavated previous to its becoming a pupa The last occupant of a cell to which we shall ask the readers notice is one whose size and power render its doings highly remarkable This insect loves to dwell upon willows poplars and other trees in which it forms its singular habitation After being developed iiT the larva form it pierces into the wood and commences long and extensive galleries therein the floor of which is covered with its excrement consisting of the comminuted fragments of the wood through which it has bored In thus perforating deep and ex tensive tracks through the tree the insect spends its summer time But on the approach of winter it prepares a chamber vaulted rounded and of considerable size This chamber however with a true idea of English comfort the insect takes care to hang all round with a thick warm coating of web composed of silk of a strong kind inter woven with raspings of wood and thus forming an admirable non conductiii lining to the walls of its apartment Here secure from cold and out of sight of all intruders the insect coils itself up and lays itself to its winters repose awaking on the arrival of summer when it emerges from its place of hybernation and recommences its work of destruction The muscular strength of this insect is amazing Its muscles form a spectacle of ingenuity and intricacy of arrangement commanding the admiration of every beholder One of these insects was put by Mr Rennie under a bell glass weighing half a pound and weighted at the top with a thick volume of not fewer than 1500 pages of strong paper yet the insect succeeded in lifting this stupendous weight and escaped from its prison unharmed This may lead us to view with less surprise its excavating feats in the trunks of old trees Surely such a creature deserves the epithet of the In sect Hercules Perhaps one of the most curious facts pre sented to us in the whole range of entomology is the habit of certain insects to wear artificial clothing of their own construction strictly com parable to our own apparel Long before man set his looms in motion before the construction of the first rude machine for making a fabric insects Divinely taught had appropriated to their own use all the materials which we now employ for the formation of our apparel Other creatures are furnished with various protections against the severities of the weather dense coats of hair feathers scales c hut several tender little caterpillars are left with their soft bodies totally unprotected and are thus exposed to all the dangers of starvation But guided by skill given them from on high they compensate for this want by forming very regular habiliments for themselves in which they walk about eat and even sleep It is true as Reaumur states that the fashion of their clothes is not of the most recherchee kind being commonly more like a sack than a coat and in this respect not very dissimilar to some human garments but this arises from the configuration of the creature they are intended to protect which being commonly cylindrical necessitates the adoption of a cylindrical figure for the garment likewise Human tailors commonly take the measure and cut out the clothes without further communication with the person for whom they are intended But our insects on the contrary form the garments upon their own body employing no other model or measure and fitting the garment at the very time of its construction Cut ting down such of the material on which it is placed as is requisite for its foundation it in terweaves the fibres with some of its own silk and so the fabric is commenced Continuing these processes of spinning and interweaving it forms a cylindrical garment in which its body is at length enclosed It lengthens its case or garment by additions at each end working first at one then at the other end at intervals of a minute or so and so quick occasionally is its manner of turning itself round and presenting its head first at one end and then at the other end of its sack that one can scarcely believe that the insect has not in reality two heads This insect which may be found on any old woollen garment that has been laid by for a time is the larva of our too familiar enemy the clothesmoth Tinea pellionella In consequence of its employing the fibres of the material on which it rests in the construction of its clothes and as that may often be of different colours the garment of our insect is likewise often parti coloured and if it is shifted while in the process of constructing its garment from one coloured material to another and that frequently we can vary the insects coat until it has all the appearance of a harlequins dress a thing not of shreds hut of patches infinite But the insect grows and therefore the suit which was amply large enough for it in its early years is by no means large enough to accommodate its increasing bulk and portliness As cleverly as or perhaps more so than any tailor the insect resolves on increasing the size of its garment which has become inconveniently tight The remedy for this is simple the insect slits its garment on the two opposite sides making a cut as clean and smooth as if it had been effected by means of a pair of the sharpest scissors It then fills up the intervals between the edges with pieces of the same material as constituted its original garment Wisely considering if we can say so much of an insect whose proceedings ap pear almost rational that it would be left without a garment if it were to cut its original vesture through from one end to the other it only slits it halfway down first and then having neatly pieced in the fissure it proceeds to cut the remaining half If the insect while thus occupied is removed from a piece of cloth of a dark blue to one of scarlet or some other strongly contrasting colour the size of the new pieces and their shape will be prettily represented by their being of that colour while the rest of the suit is of blue The insect actually however feeds upon the same material as furnishes it with fibres for the construction of its garment The larvae of these insects clothe themselves with various other materials and those of other tribes adopt a somewhat similar measure This single instance may suffice for all and we have this advantage in its selection that the domestic entomology of every dwelling is sure to number among its ranks the destructive larva of the clothes moth These coverings may be looked upon either as garments or as dwellings for one and the same end is accomplished by them namely the concealment and protection of the body of the included insect Reaumur commences the fifth memoir in his third volume with the following just observation One of those circumstances which most forcibly strike the mind of travellers in foreign countries is the variety of garments worn by the inhabitants of the regions through which he journeys The aspect thus presented is truly singular and may even be so to the eyes of the philosopher as well as to the ordinary observer One cannot help wondering that man having in the formation of his raiment only one end to serve namely to protect himself from the severities of the weather or simply to provide himself with a suitable covering should have employed so many different means of accomplishing his purpose How different are the garments of civilized nations compared to those of savages And how singularly do the fashions of the clothes differ even among civilized people and among the various savage inhabitants of the globe The change of la mode and the return of the same fashions which we so constantly witness teach us that the different forms of human garments have not always been chosen for their usefulness or even for their convenience Reaumur might have instanced the hooped dresses of a bygone age which were surely neither chosen for utility nor for comfort Our insects he continues like the rest of the world fashion their garments after different models but unlike man the fashion never changes in the same species Nature rather Natures God has instructed them all and has taught to each the most convenient apparel for its preservation These remarks of this great entomologist which though primarily referring to the clothing of insects have also a direct reference to the habitations they construct are equally applicable to the variety of dwellings selected by the insect tribes The variety of dwellings selected by insects for residence chiefly while in the larva state is very great and the dwellings being always the same for the same tenant we may always safely tell the nature of the insect from the cell it constructs If we judge of the skill of the architect of one of our own habitations by the ingenuity with which he adapts his structure to the situation or by the facility he exhibits in overcoming any difficulties of construction arising from the inappropriateness of the materials furnished to him or from other and accidental causes we may apply the same rule to the insects whose cells so variously formed and exhibiting such ingenuities of adaptation to circumstances have been the subject of our thoughts during the present chapter Gibbon tells us The most perfect hermits are supposed to have passed many days without food many nights without sleep and many years with out speaking and glorious was the man I abuse that name who contrived any cell or seat of a peculiar construction which might expose him in the most inconvenient posture to the inclemency of the seasons How different the happy insect recluse from this He takes care to make his cell as comfortable as the skill and means which a gracious Creator has put in his way admit of By no means does he choose for his residence the most exposed and inclement spots Quite the contrary our insect takes due care to defend himself from the weather by every possible contrivance and never can he be accused of living contrary to common sense The cells lie deep hidden in the forests and fields Hunting there oftentimes shall we find the insect recluse has chosen for his abode just such a scene as Spenser has painted in the following lines A little lowly hermitage it was Down in a dale hard by the forests side Far from resort of people that did pass In travel to and fro Here the happy peaceful hours of its cell life are spent Fed by Him who feeds the birds and clothes the field flowers with their robes and even cares for insects its little day of life runs out and the occupant of the cell either falls into the trancelike pupa state or if it be a perfect insect breathes its last and dies CHAPTER lY THE BATTLEFIELD Read this other part that sings Embattled squadrons and adventurous kings A mighty pomp though made of little things Their arms their arts their manners I disclose And how they war and whence the people rose Virgils Georg b iv We are told in the sure word of Scripture prophecy that there shall a time come when men shall learn war no more and when the weapons they have used in destruction shall be turned to the peaceful purposes of agriculture Contending nations shall own the reign of Him whose right it is and whose government shall be distinguished by peace quietness and assurance for ever Not only so hut the same Divinely inspired word fully declares that a reign of peace awaits even the brute creation The lion and lamb shall feed together and the venomous beasts of the earth shall cease their deadly attacks upon each other or mankind The blessing all encircling is to extend wider still and it is promised that even vegetable creation shall manifest then by its luxuriance and fruitfulness the universal joy of all the earth during that peaceful era Nor can we doubt that then while harmony and peace pervade the rest of the renewed and liberated creation the insect world shall experience its share in the same privileges and it shall be said to the fierce armies whose sanguinary conflicts we are about to describe Be at peace among yourselves As yet neither in human nor in insect society do we behold any foretokenings of the advent of this reign of peace Still burn the angry passions of the heart and still nation rises against nation in our world nor less in that of insects The battles of insects it is true make less noise than do those of contending human armies and many a conflict takes place in field and woodland without the knowledge or recognition of the other inhabitants of those regions But except in the matters of noise and force the battles of insect armies emulate in all respects the fury and the blood shed of their superiors Nor are we able to say 144 THE LIFE OF AN INSECT that insects prone to fight can make out any better casus helUi than more enlightened beings bent on picking a quarrel with their neighbours It is the duty of the historian of every nation even of insect nations to state matters with strict impartiality and it is therefore ours to remark that neither the animating motives of the combatants nor the object of their wars appear at all times to justify their occurrence Alas that wheresoever we look the eye that will closely mark the aspect of creation and the habits of created beings will find those evidences of imperfect happiness which plainly tell us ours is a fallen world If says Huber we wish to behold regular armies war in all its forms we must visit those forests in which the Fallow ants establish their dominion over every insect in their territory We shall there see populous and rival cities regular roads passing from the anthill as so many rays from a centre and frequented by an immense number of combatants wars between hordes of the same species for they are naturally enemies and jealous of the territory winch borders their own capital It is in these forests I have witnessed the inhabitants of two large anthills engaged in spirited combat I cannot pretend to say what occasioned discord between those republics They were composed of ants of the same species alike in their extent and population and were situated about a hundred paces distance from each other Two empires could not possess a greater number of combatants In describing these conflicts we can only com pare them with our own and are therefore compelled to adopt the language suitable to human conflicts for in the words of the last author we cannot invent a particular language for these insects we must therefore make use of the terms employed when speaking of war Let us first speak of the munitions of war Our combatants have no matchlocks cannons or projectile arms of any kind similar to our own but they are furnished with no insufficient substitute in the receptacle of venom situated at the lower part of the abdomen A discharge of this acrid fluid is fatal to many enemies not less so than is the reception of a bullet in some vital part of one of our own soldiers It has been called by chemists formic acid from the Latin name of the ant and may be extracted from the insects by maceration in cold water It is a pungent acrid fluid of very distinct acid properties In addition to this somewhat formidable apparatus the insect soldiers are furnished with a strong pair of trenchant jaws than the wounds inflicted by which no gashes cleft by warriors sword are more fearful We have heard tell of various feats of arms accomplished by our warriors of old with their swords and spears but the historian of insect conflicts can recount such deeds of valour as find few parallels in history Only a few of our mighty men could slice off an enemys head with one stroke of a falchion but there is not a single soldier in the Amazonian ranks of ants who cannot do likewise or even cleave in twain his adversarys body or chop asunder his limbs Altogether the combatants as we may imagine from these statements have no need of powder bullets or cannonballs and still less of such weapons as daggers and sword blades In battle although we cannot quite say with Chaucer that their Bright swordes wenten to and fro So hidously that with the leste stroke It seemed as it wolde felle an oake yet so furiously are their substitutes for swords plied as to leave little to be desired to fill up the measure of the comparison As to courage and ferocity they surpass the most warlike of human nations It matters nought to these redoubtable warriors what may be the size of their foe Their courage is not quelled by an attack from man himself on the contrary the warriors instantly face about when menaced and put themselves into the attitude of fighting If the attack be actually made the valorous insect furiously expands its jaws and ejects from its projectile apparatus a shower of venom upon the enemy Cunning is almost unknown among their military devices like brave and bold soldiers their attacks are open and generally in the face of day The warriors are all females of the labouring class the males and queen never appearing in battle But to the battlefield We shall describe strictly in accordance with truth a great battle fought between the Herculean and the Sanguine armies The Herculean warriors were strong and mighty and of much greater stature than those of the Sanguine army being in fact half as large again But the Sanguine warriors though small were wonderfully valorous and feared not in the least the fury of their bulky opponents The Sanguine citizens were peace fully pursuing their avocations and busy in the discharge of their multifarious daily duties little thought of the probability of a hostile army being already on the march and bent on the annihilation of the entire people of that kingdom The Herculeans occupying a highly advantageous site for their city upon the trunk of a tree and jealous of the thriving colony of the Sanguines at no great distance from their territories although the latter do not appear to have given any special cause of offence sallied forth one afternoon in innumerable hosts to the destruction of their rivals The advancing army poured its swarms of warriors down the side of the tree their polished armour glittering in the sunbeams and their aspect and ferocity well calculated to inspire their enemies with terror and dismay Legion after legion came down and the earth was now covered so thick with the Herculean host that not a blade of grass was visible Alas for the Sanguine citizens as yet ignorant of the approaching destruction Suddenly the wild intelligence flew through the Sanguine kingdom that the enemy was at the gates and that the sentinels were already in the agonies of death As if by magic countless thousands of the Sanguine citizens all ready armed flew to the rescue From the deepest recesses of the city from its halls and galleries from its winding avenues and cells warrior after warrior rushed to the scene of battle Their attitude at first was purely defensive They appear to have felt the immediate necessity of removing their dwelling place to a distance from such undesirable neighbours and their efforts were all directed rather to keep the enemy at bay and in action than to wage a pitched battle While therefore a certain body of the Sanguine warriors contended furiously with the advance legions of the enemy another portion were hard at work in the act and business of decamping from their city These latter full of agitation might be seen snatching up their precious young charges and rushing off with them between their jaws carrying them as tenderly as circumstances admitted of to a place of safety at some distance In this act of transporting their baggage and the young of the community they exhibited their usual prudence and it may he seriously questioned whether human tacticians could have better arranged matters than did they Small detachments of warriors were posted at little distances so as to cover the march of the decamping citizens and their task was rendered no easy one in consequence of the well directed attacks of the Herculean soldiers The transportation effected the Herculean army attacked the assembled Sanguine host and now the tide of battle rose strong and high On came the Herculean warriors proud of their strength and making the blades of grass to tremble at their sound but more fiercely onward rushed the Sanguine host Conscious of the force gained by impetus every Sanguine warrior dashed upon its immense opponent probably somewhat to the surprise of the latter Leaping upon the Herculeans head the agile Sanguine directed its projectile apparatus with such skill as to inundate the chest and mouth of its adversary with the suffocating fluid With equal agility the Sanguine would then leap off its antagonist and rush upon a second foe leaving the first in no very desirable plight But more frequently the valorous Sanguine experienced a very different reception at the hands of its Herculean antagonist The strong Herculean would often seize the little and active fighter and hold it in a suffocating embrace between its feet Then both warriors violently struggled with each other and rolled over and over in the dust and blood of the battlefield And now little hope remained for the poor Sanguine the fight depend ing more upon physical strength than valour Desperate was their fury invincible their obstinacy The Sanguine again and again thrust its sharp weapon into its opponents body but in vain the Herculean seized it suddenly between its jaws the Sanguine all the while clenching hold of its adversarys leg and snapped its body in twain So might overcame right and neither the righteousness of the Sanguines cause nor the in tensity of its valour could avail to turn the scale of battle in its favour as an individual Yet on the other hand neither did the Herculean come off unscathed for wounded and limping it crawled away bearing a painful evidence of its past conflict and of the determined obstinacy of its tiny opponent in the head and jaws of the latter remaining firmly fixed on one of its legs beyond the power of extrication To its latest hour the Herculean carried that trophy about with it not resigning it even in the agonies of death Sometimes the result was different On perceiving the inequality of the contest several Sanguines would rush up to one of their companions and collecting around the infuriated combatants would pierce the body of the Herculean with several deep wounds The Herculean relaxed its gripe yielded to the numbers which surrounded it and either perished the victim of its temerity or was conducted a prisoner to the enemys camp After much carnage after many valuable lives had been lost after great damage done on both sides the battle ended The Herculeans encroached no more and the brave Sanguines went on with their usual employments It seems a pity they had not agreed to do so before they began as in reality no advantage was got by the contending parties which might not have been equally well obtained by an amicable arrangement Such however is the history of too many battles not alone in the insect world On the whole the conduct of the Sanguine ants in the conflict thus described was highly deserving of praise since they were the attacked and the others the invading party The battles of the Sanguine and Fallow ants as regards the skill with which they are conducted and the method in which the military operations are carried forward bear no inconsiderable resemblance to the wars in which we ourselves engage The Sanguine ants when they are attacked by the Fallow ants go and await the enemy in little troops at some distance from the nest They then advance in a body without separating and seize all those of their enemies who venture too far from their camp These skirmishes are highly amusing The two parties place themselves in a sort of ambuscade and suddenly attack each other in turns But these skirmishes become increasingly serious and a great battle is com monly decided upon The Fallow ants resolve to send a large body of troops into the field in order to put a check to the guerilla warfare which is cutting down their best warriors No sooner do the sentinels of the Sanguine detachments recognize the advancing host of the Fallow ants than they inform the inhabitants of their kingdom of the need in which they stand of immediate reinforcement Despatches are sent off in haste to the army at home and great excitement is created Immediately a considerable army leaves the Sanguine city advances in dense masses and the conflict begins The seas and rocks and skies rebound To arms to arms to arms The dimensions of the battlefield were about two paces in length by one in breadth but here Were marshalled in tolerable order two opposing armies each of which was many thousand strong The battle commenced the opposing legions fell upon each other with equal courage and as yet with equal fortunes Quickly each Warriouresse with haughty crest Did forth issue all ready for the fight On th other side her foe appeared soone in sight Both sides being without generals field marshals or other superior officers to direct their movements engaged in an irregular conflict Every warrior singled out his opponent and the battle was thus made up of a number of single combats But it was none the less furious Although neither party had flags or standards nor were assisted in their recognition of their own party by the voice of the trumpet yet rarely was there any confusion of the hosts and very rarely did one infuriated warrior fall upon another of his own side by mis take Whenever a mistake was made the attack ing insect immediately recognizing its error relaxed its murderous gripe and made its apologies by caressing its injured fellow with its antennae All Nature was at peace apparently while this fearful battle was being contested The sun shed its beams joyously upon the herbage flowers and trees and the wind sighed gently over the fields But the contending hosts were all engrossed in their conflict and fought with unmitigated fury in the parting rays of the declining sun The shadows of evening lengthen ed out but ere their close in the full darkness of night the conflict had terminated and each party was seen retiring with their prisoners homeward It might have been expected that here this insect war would have ended but not so The morning came and ere the grey light had brightened into day the contending parties entered the battlefield and the fight was immediately recommenced The sun arose upon the combatants doing battle with even greater fury than before Again ant fell upon ant and a mortal struggle for the mastery ensued Reinforcements arrived perpetually from both cities and thus kept up the ferocity of the contest Detachments of soldiers weary with the prolonged struggle were sent off to the city taking charge of the prisoners taken in fight Showers of venom were discharged from the projectile apparatus of the insect armies and a thin sulphureous vapour rising therefrom covered the battlefield with a pall under which the legions fought with un abated fury Another day closed upon them still fighting though now with reduced numbers Again before dawn the battle was recommenced It now appeared that nothing short of the entire annihilation of both kingdoms was impending There was little prospect of either party being victorious although both were Tugging to be victors breast to breast Yet neither conquerors nor conquered No advantage had been gained by either army and the position of affairs seemed much the same as it was when the fight began hut that a terrible slaughter had thinned the opposing hosts At length the battle ended whether in consequence of the exhaustion of the forces of each party or of a heavy shower of rain cannot be exactly said But at any rate the armies withdrew to their respective citadels and fought no more Alas what a field of battle had they left There lay the bodies of some thousands of brave soldiers that but for this unhappy conflict had been busily engaged in the useful occupations of peace Heaps of mangled limbs lay scattered around Here lay a body without the head Here were a trunkless head and dissevered legs The dead bodies and limbs being covered with venom When all was over no good had been effected not even victory had been gained and the opposing armies separated after a vain but sanguinary attempt to annihilate one another greatly to the loss of their several communities A combat of a somewhat dissimilar character is described by Mr Knapp in the following termsThese systematic creatures appear al ways to travel from and return to their nests in direct lines from which no trifling obstacle will divert them and any interruption on this public highway they resent menacing the intruder with their vengeance A neighbour related to me an instance of this unyielding dis position which he witnessed in one of our lanes Two parties of these black ants were proceeding from different nests upon a foraging expedition when the separate bodies happened to meet each other Neither would give way and a violent contest for the passage ensued After a time the combat ceased and all animosity subsided each party retiring to its nest carrying with it its dead and maimed companions This encounter seemed quite accidental and the disposition to move in a uniform line which their meeting prevented the sole cause of their hostility combat and mutual injury Sometimes these combats do not take place on the earth but in the air In the fields of light The shocking squadrons meet in mortal fight A correspondent of the Entomological Magazine relates the following interesting aerial battle In the summer of 1828 a relative of mine was attracted by the singular actions of some sawyers who were at work at a short distance from the house in which he was staying On reaching them he found they were annoyed by an immense body of ants flying above their heads numbers of which were incessantly falling on them The saw pit was situated between two trees one of which appeared to be the station of an army of black the other of an army of red ants After each army had been flying for a while round the tree of which it had taken possession both as by some mutual signal rushed forward and meeting in mid air commenced a most desperate battle As they fought numbers fell to the ground and always in pairs one black and the other red and when thus engaged as it were hand to hand each pair continued the horrid combat until one or both were completely disabled and unable again to rise At last a truce was sound ed and each party retired to its respective post but alas 1 this was but for a time it was only to recover their strength and recruit their exhausted energies Burning with cruel rage and insatiable revenge each party again rushed into battle again the horrors of war were repeated and prolonged and again they retreated This continued during the whole day and the carnage did not cease till the sun was below the horizon The air was then deserted by the combatants but the earth was strewn with the slain the dying and maimed Not one that bit the dust ever again left the earth to which his own rashness and savageness had brought him The most perfectly organized army in the world of insects is to be found in the tribe of the warlike Termites of the tropics Almost all that we know as to these remarkable creatures is contained in a paper by Mr Smeathman in the Philosophical Transactions for 1781 After a minute account of the constitution of this remarkable insect society and of the astonishing cities it constructs Mr Smeathman states some highly interesting particulars concerning them Unlike other warlike tribes these insects have an army of military entirely distinct from the labouring classes of the community As with ourselves the soldiery do nothing else but fight and the insect soldiers really appear to be unable to fulfil any other duty The work of repairing the city and fortifications and all the other business of the community is fulfilled by the labouring classes The soldiers are not so numerous as the latter but they are strong powerful creatures and are armed with a fearful pair of jaws In disposition they are the most fierce obstinate and implacable creatures in the world The following interesting account of the behaviour of these insects when attacked by an enemy is extracted from Mr Smeathmans paper The first object which strikes one upon opening their hills is the behaviour of their soldiers If you make a breach in a few seconds a soldier will run out and walk about as if to reconnoitre It will sometimes go in as if to give the alarm but most frequently may be followed by two or three others who run straggling after one another and to them succeed a large body who rush out as fast as the breach will permit them and the number increases as long as any one continues battering the build ing It is not easy to describe the rage and fury which they show In their hurry they frequently miss their hold and tumble down the sides of the hill but recover themselves as quickly as possible and being blind bite every thing they run against thus making a crackling noise while some beat repeatedly with their forceps upon the building and make a small vibrating noise something shriller and quicker than the ticking of a watch it can be heard at three or four feet distance They make their hooked jaws meet at every bite and if it should be the leg of a man a spot of blood extending an inch on the stocking follows the wound Nothing can tear them away but they must be taken off piecemeal If on the other hand you cease to batter in half an hour they retire into the nest as if they supposed the wonderful monster that damaged their castle to be beyond their reach The labourers who had fled on the first alarm are now seen hasten ing to repair the breach every one with a bur then of ready tempered mortar in its mouth This they stick on to the breach with such wonderful celerity and order that although thousands nay millions seem employed yet they never embarrass one another While the labourers are thus engaged the soldiers retire save here and there one who saunters about never touching the mortar One in particular places itself close to the part undergoing repair it may be seen turning leisurely on all sides and every now and then at an interval of a minute or two lifting up its head and with its forceps beating upon the building and making a vibrating noise on which a loud hiss apparently from the whole body of labourers issues from with inside the dome and all the subterranean passages that it comes from the labourers is very evident for all these may be seen hastening at every such signal redoubling their pace and working as fast again Attack the nest again and with a loud hiss the labourers disappear and the soldiers rush out so that the experiment yields constantly the same result of labourers at work and soldiers rushing to battle the duties of each being as distinct as night and day Some of the species of Termites are occasion ally to be seen marching in great pomp and with all the order of human troops The labourers form into columns sixteen abreast and commence their expedition marching in a strictly straight line They are here and there accompanied by an escort of soldiers the latter arranging themselves on both sides of the line of march a few soldiers also are found in their midst like policemen in a mob and perhaps placed there for similar purposes Others of the soldiers keep a foot or so from the column acting as videttes appointed to guard against a surprise Others mount the blades of grass as sentinels turning their heads in different directions and every now and then signalling to the marching squadrons below by striking their forceps against a leaf a signal to which the whole army replies by a loud hissing sound and redoubles its pace There is also a heavy rearguard of soldiers which protects the retreat ing columns Millions upon millions must unite to form these dense marching columns The contests of the bees were known to the ancients and have been described in glowing terms but with many inaccuracies by the poet Virgil Reaumur has given the particulars of a great battle which he beheld among these insects The cause of war was the followingA swarm of bees which Reaumur had attempted to reconcile to a glazed hive appeared greatly to dislike the apartments he offered them and several times abandoned them with their queen At length in an evil hour the queen and her subjects determined to invade a populous hive hard by their own and they crept in at its portals Scarcely had they entered when a terrible uproar was raised in the large hive its winged inhabitants becoming furiously enraged at the audacity of the invaders Instantly a general action commenced Unfortunately the hive was not constructed so as to afford a view of the fight but from several skirmishes which took place outside the hive the general idea of the conflict may be formed Two combatants would emerge the one dragging along the other and endeavouring to trample its prisoner under foot If successful in mounting upon the prostrate foe woe to the latter The victorious insect seized its victim between its powerful jaws near to its head and bit it with great force Almost instantly the poor vanquished bee in all probability pierced through with the envenomed weapon of its adversary was either dead or dying The victor immediately left the body of its expiring foe remaining however close by it as if in triumph or to rest from its fatigue While resting as if in satisfaction at its deed of death the victor bee would rub its hind legs against each other Similar scenes were no doubt enacted within the hive from out of which sounded the tumult of battle Every now and then emerging from its portal would be seen a victorious bee carrying in triumph the carcase of a dead foe between its legs The bee would emerge flying and sometimes at a little distance sometimes at a greater would deposit the corpse upon the ground Sometimes however the captive was not quite dead the victor then after flying with it to a little distance presently despatched it It is highly remarkable that the bees are well acquainted with the exact position of the mortal parts of the body of their enemy We ourselves are not able to destroy one of these little insects if we do not actually crush it at once half so speedily as is one of its companions This terrible combat lasted from half past one o clock in the afternoon until five o clock and the massacre all the time continued frightful It is indeed conjectured by Reaumur that all the invaders were destroyed but of this he could not of course satisfactorily assure himself He collected with his own hands two hundred and fifty corpses off the battlefield and might have gathered more if necessary In addition to these many were carried off to a distance and the ground in the vicinity of the invaded bee city was strewn here and there with the dead or dying victims to their own audacity and infringement of the laws of nations Mr Knight has given us an amusing account of two bee battles of which he was spectator under some singular circumstancesPassing through one of my orchards rather late in the evening in the month of August in the year 1801 I observed that several bees passed me in a direct line from the hives in my own garden to those in the garden of a cottager which was about a hundred yards distant from it As it was considerably later in the evening than the time when bees usually cease to labour I concluded that something more than ordinary was going forward Going first to my own garden and then to that of the cottager I found a very considerable degree of hustle and agitation to prevail in one hive in each every bee as it arrived seemed to be stopped and questioned at the mouth of each hive hut I could not discover anything like actual resistance or hostility to take place though I was much inclined to believe the intercourse between the hives to be hostile and predatory The same kind of intercourse continued in a greater or less degree during eight succeeding days and though I watched them very closely nothing occurred to induce me to suppose that their intercourse was not of an amicable kind On the tenth morning however their friendship ended as sudden and violent friendships often do in a quarrel and they fought most furiously and after this there was no more visiting Two years subsequently to this period I observed the same kind of intercourse to take place between two hives of my own bees which were situated about two hundred yards distant from each other they passed from each hive to the other just as they did in the preceding instance and a similar degree of agitation was observable In this instance however their friendship appeared to be of much shorter duration for they fought most desperately on the fifth day and then as in the last mentioned case all further visiting ceased Messrs Kirby and Spence have furnished us with an extract from the Carlisle Patriot News paper which describes a combat of bees almost to the letter in the same manner as Virgil who appears to have written from actual observation describes the same circumstance in the early part of the fourth Georgic The newspaper extract is as follows On Saturday last a combat of a truly novel description was witnessed A hive of bees be longing to a professional gentleman of this city swarmed on Thursday last after which they were hived in the regular way and appeared to be doing well On the Saturday after a swarm of bees from some neighbouring hive appeared to be flying over the garden in which the hive above mentioned was placed when they instantly darted down upon the hive of the new settlers and completely covered it in a little time they began to enter the hive and poured into it in such numbers that it soon became completely filled A loud humming noise was heard and the work of destruction immediately ensued the winged combatants sallied forth from the hive until it became entirely empty and a furious battle commenced in upper air between the besiegers and the besieged These intrepid little warriors were so numerous that they literally darkened the sky overhead like a cloud meanwhile the destructive battle raged with fury on both sides and the ground beneath was covered with the wounded and the slain hundreds of them were lying dead or crawling about disabled from reascending to the scene of action To one party however the palm of victory was at last awarded and they settled upon the branch of an adjoining apple tree from which they were safely placed in the empty hive which had been the object of their valiant contention and where they now continue peacefully and industriously employed in adding to the stores of their commonwealth The beauty of Virgils lines justifies our extracting a few of them into our jage Their close similarity to the above account deserves notice allowing always for poetical embellishments Inflamed with ire and trembling with disdain Scarce can their limbs their mighty souls contain With shouts the cowards courage they excite And martial clangors call them to the fight With hoarse alarms the hollow camp rebounds That imitate the trumpets angry sounds Then to their common standard they repair The nimble horsemen scour the fields of air In form of battle drawn they issue forth And every knight is proud to prove his worth After this glowing description of the sally forth to the fight Virgil informs us of two or three particulars more poetical than true among which is the curious piece of intelligence that the bees sharpen their stings by whetting them on their beaks His account of the actual conflict however is as beautiful as it is correct Headlong they fall from high and wounded wound And heaps of slaughtered soldiers bite the ground Hard hailstones lie not thicker on the plain Nor shaken oaks such showers of acorns ram After describing an imaginary duel between the two monarchs of the contending nations which he erroneously calls kings he quaintly adds the following lines Yet all these dreadful deeds this deadly fray A cast of scattered dust will soon allay And undecided leave the fortune of the day In spite of many inaccuracies there are evidences in this Georgic that the poet was a close observer of nature going wrong only when de pending on the accounts he probably received from others or when suffering himself to be led astray by the exuberance of his poetical fancies Battles sometimes occur between a very different class of opponents to those commonly met by insects on the field of contest and it must be confessed not unfrequently insects are the conquerors One of these attacks of insects upon man has already been described in an ex tract from Lieutenant Holmans travels A similar fact and even a more striking one is recorded by Mungo Park He says We had no sooner unloaded the asses at the creek than some of Isaacos people being in search of honey unfortunately disturbed a large swarm of bees near where we had halted The bees came out in immense numbers and attacked men and beasts at the same time Luckily most of the asses were loose and galloped up the valley but the horses and people were very much stung and obliged to scamper in all directions The fire which had been kindled for cooking being deserted spread and set fire to the bamboos and our baggage had like to have been burnt In fact for half an hour the bees seemed to have completely put an end to our journey In the evening when the bees became less troublesome and we could venture to collect our cattle we found that many of them were very much stung and swelled about the head Three asses were missing one died in the evening and one next morning and we were forced to leave one at Sibi killim in all six besides which our guide lost his horse and many of the people were very much stung about the face and hands On another occasion one ass was lost and a man well nigh killed by these formidable winged warriors We are told that the occasion has once occurred in which man actually called in these aerial combatants to Ins assistance when attacked by his fellow man It was in 1535 during the confusion occasioned by a time of war that a mob of infuriated peasants assembled in Hohnstein and attacked among other places the house of a gentleman who had some hives of bees in his garden After in vain expostulating with them upon the unreasonableness of their attack this gentleman be thouofht him of his faithful allies in the garden and despatched his servants for several of the hives They were thrown into the middle of the angry mob and in an instant some forty or fifty thousand warriors emerged from them and fell upon the multitude Amazed and terrified at the appearance of this new enemy in the field the people fled in all directions and the gentlemans house in a surprisingly short space of time was left totally unmolested Sometimes however man is the attacking party as will appear from the following extract I left Bainder writes Mr Arundel at seven oclock accompanied by all the great Turks armed from head to foot with muskets pistols and yatagans in grand procession to exterminate the locusts I was awoke at a very early hour by the Turkish tambour which was beating a summons for the entire population Turk Christian and Jew to rise en masse and sally out to destroy these destructive insects arrived on the field of action about eight o clock The hedges were darkened by the masses of locusts though not of more advanced growth than a large fly Hundreds of people were to be seen Turks Jews Greeks Armenians grouped in all directions brushing the locusts together in immense heaps with bushes c at the beat of the tambour and then with a thundering hurrah jumping upon the heaps and killing them Other parties took a different mode by sweeping the masses into a small stream where like immense swarms of bees clustered together they sank to the bottom We are told by another author that the locusts proved such formidable enemies on one occasion in Syria that the Bashaw of Tripoli raised a force of four thousand soldiers to wage war with them Some of his men thought it beneath them to contend with insects but they were soon silenced by a peremptory order to hang up all those who refused to take the field against the locusts Locusts have also been contended with at the cannons mouth but their numbers gene rally ensure to the insects the victory The scenes recorded in this chapter of insect history though highly interesting in themselves leave upon the mind a reflection of sadness if not of pain in their contemplation Well may Huber exclaim Is war inseparable from a state of society Looking at the ants and bees as a community where shall we find a more just equalization of labour a more devoted loyalty a more affectionate and friendly intercourse of the individuals of the community with one an other and we have yet to see a fuller exhibition of those social virtues which shine scarcely more highly in superior beings than in these humble insects Yet where at the same time shall we see displayed passions more fierce and revenge more implacable than we behold in the Insect Wars In vain therefore do we seek even among the most highly endowed insects those principles of peace and love which could render their history without a blot and their community an example to mankind They are poor weak irascible creatures at their best estate and while appearing highly well conducted and happy in the city their aspect is fierce and unpleasing and their example evil when we behold them marshalled in the battlefield CHAPTER V INSECT DUELS W E must now descend from generals to particulars and having narrated the combats of insect nations it becomes us in pursuing our account of insect habits to advert to a few cases of the single combats which are even more frequent among insects than the battles of nations We can no more justify the proceedings of insect duellists than those of insect warriors in many of these fierce onslaughts Indeed of the latter it may be said that they are occasionally perfectly justifiable in consequence of the infringement of international laws If amongst ourselves it is considered a great and righteous cause to take up arms in defence of our country we must extend the same justice to insects and are bound to admit that when acting on the defensive and simply with a view to resist the ingress of an enemy and a destroyer their battles have a most just cause and may right always prevail against might Upon other quarrels and causes of war the insect apologist must be silent or may even admit to the full that they do not justify the carnage which accompanies them We fear however little can be truly said in palliation of the mutual combats of insects Their valour is not excited to defend an endangered country but to avenge a fancied insult and when either or both of the combatants perish they die wholly without the consolation of having perished in a good cause Yet this much can be said for insects that unlike the duellists of another race they have only the light of nature for their moral guide and to them it was never said from on High as to ourselves If thine enemy hunger feed him if he thirst give him drink nor yet Be ye tenderhearted forgiving one another even as God for Christs sake hath forgiven you We shall yet find before we close this little volume that though insect history has this blot on its page it contains also many a bright line from which instruction may be gathered by us all The causes which lead to the duels of insects are various Sometimes they are hidden in obscurity and it is impossible to say what inspires the combatants with their mutual fury Frequently however the intrusion of a stranger into their society seems to excite instantly their angry passions and a combat is the immediate result Many insects seem instinctively to dread or hate those of the same tribe with themselves and will fall ferociously upon each other the moment they espy one another out When this is the case one or other is pretty sure to perish and if so to be eaten up altogether A¥e are less surprised at incidents of this kind in the history of solitary insects which were never intended to be placed in company with each other but it is very puzzling to see social insects the members of a common republic and ordinarily the most excellent helpful and faithful friends fight each other to death Reaumur indeed eyeing his humble insect friends with a kind and perhaps partial look apologizes in an ingenious manner for the duels of bees Were we permitted says he to penetrate the policy of the bees we should probably hud to their credit that their quarrels are not often produced by the frivolous causes which excite similar quarrels among ourselves We may not perhaps extend to them the charity we extend to savages who think they are doing an act of kindness to the aged and infirm in shortening their days knowing that they would otherwise be spent in pain and privation but there is at least the probability that it is for the welfare of the community which alone appears to actuate them that bees engage in these single combats the intention of which is to destroy those who can no longer benefit the state If such indeed be their motives the duels appear less unjustifiable but Ileaumurs charity led him it may be too far for bees are well known to be a most irri table race and it seems strange that a work necessary on this supposition to the wellbeing of the community should be undertaken by a single individual on its own responsibility and with the imminent risk of being itself the vanquished instead of the victor It would appear more probable that these hot tempered little insects take some quick offence at one another and resolve to settle the matter in hand by a duel Be this as it may let us seek the precincts of the city of the bees and become the spectators of one of their duels To do this we must select some fine warm day and if we are patient observers we shall not often fail of seeing the spectacle in question Sometimes both combatants sally out of the hive already in the full act of fighting and not un frequently a bee will be seen quietly walking up the outside of the hive or even at rest and its adversary will suddenly pounce upon it and the combat begins So soon as the combatants are mutually engaged they generally fall down to the ground It appears that they could not con tend with each other to much advantage in the air from the difficulty of inflicting a mortal wound and of at the same time sustaining them selves therein On the ground the enraged duellists imitate the action of wrestlers in a mortal struggle Each one takes up that position which it considers to be the most advantageous Sometimes both lie struggling fast held together in the dust plying their wings furiously and spinning round and around but not rising from the earth One of them however succeeds at length in obtaining a more favourable position than the other mounts upon its back and at tempts to bring the hinder part of its body near the head of its prostrate foe so as to thrust its poniard into it So absorbed are they then in combat that they are utterly heedless of the presence and even close scrutiny of the observer Engrossed with the furious determination to conquer or perish each is too much occupied in its defence and attack to regard surrounding objects During this conflict they continually make thrusts with their stings and all their strugglings and all the positions into which they throw themselves appear to have the sole object of discovering some vulnerable part of the adversarys body into which this formidable weapon can be thrust The horny epidermis with which each is clad forms a complete coat of mail through which the darts of the duellists are not easily thrust The most vulnerable parts are near the neck and the extremity of the abdomen and here like two practised swordsmen the combatants chiefly direct their glittering weapons These combats often last a considerable time Reaumur says he was spectator to one which lasted almost an hour one of the duellists at the expiration of that time being left dying on the ground Sometimes both combatants are so weary of the prolonged struggle and apparently despairing of bringing it to an issue that they art and fly away If both have escaped the darts of their adversary both will probably survive and for aught we know to the contrary the quarrel may be so entirely forgotten that the duellists may again exchange friendly intercourse But if either has received a wound from the other in any fleshy part a fatal result is sure to follow However minute the quantity of venom the wounded bee is beyond the reach of cure Some times however the victor itself perishes by leaving its weapon in the body of its dying foe The sting with all its connected parts being thus torn violently away the wound is incurable and both insects pay the penalty of their encounter with their lives The insect relatives of the Father Long legs and even the Father Longlegs itself are sometimes to be met with in the heat of a duel Mr Westwood tells us in walking home at dusk one evening I heard a considerable rustling of insects wings like those of a dragonfly when flying amongst twigs and immediately perceived two specimens of this insect Tipula gigan tea flying across my path I seized them and was surprised to And that they were two individuals of the male sex In like manner I captured two male specimens of a smaller species allied to Tipula oleracea in the evening flying together above my head and fighting apparently with great violence And this reminds me that some years ago I found two male specimens of Trichiosoma lucorum rolling about on the ground having seized each other with their large and powerful jaws Deadly battles between rival queen bees have been recorded but I am not aware that any of these encounters between individuals of the opposite sex incited as we may perhaps justly suppose by jealousy have been recorded Duels have also been recorded between those formidable creatures the stag beetles An observer in the Entomological Magazine having confined two of these creatures under a glass saw the largest of the two turning round and attacking his smaller companion The other intimidated probably by the ferocious aspect of its foe betook himself to his legs and ran round the side of the gdass hotly pursued by the first The larger insect repeatedly pinched the fugitive severely with his strong jaws and actually lifted him off his legs into the air Taking compassion upon the latter the observer withdrew him from the glassy prison and from the assaults of his frightful foe Such is the pertinacity of life in these insects that in a mutilated specimen from which the abdomen had been torn the powerful jaws still could give a severe bite and actually did so to the surprise of the person who picked it up There is a species of beetle common in the southeastern parts of Europe which exhibits the same pugnacity of character This creature digs a comfortable burrow in the ground in which with its partner it dwells securely But now and then an intruder in his travels will happen to look in at the door of this subter ranean mansion the result may be easily antici pated The inmate who is a muscular powerful fellow with very strong jaws curiously shaped rushes out and failing to get a satisfactory account of the intruders object in trespassing on the sanctity of his earthen home immediately challenges him to a fight The other not less bold and perhaps anxious to secure to himself so comfortable an abode as he has just peeped into accepts the challenge and the duel instantly begins We may be sure while this contest is going on there is a great scuffling and tearing up of the ground and the partner of the insect whose citadel has been invaded doubtless sits in her dark cavern awaiting with anxiety the result The battle is carried on with great vio lence and the issue is a long time doubtful but it is at length decided either by the slaugh ter of one or other of the combatants or by the precipitate retreat of the impertinent in truder Alas that we have to call butterflies to ar account for their duelling propensities No one who has cast even a casual glance on the natural objects presented to him in his everyday walks not only in the country which God has made but in the town made by man can have failed to have seen a duel between two of the common white butterflies which give somewhat of a coun try air even to the dismal green patches of vege tatioii ill the centre of our London squares See one fluttering along in its irregular and ap parently objectless course in the full joy of life and of the suininer air presently it will be met by another and a duel is immediately fought The pugnacious insects rise into the air tussling with each other and striking against one another with some force These combats are not however on any occasion mortal Each insect probably gets some ruffling of its plumage from the blows of its antagonist but after they have fought a little time they part and each flies away if indeed as not unfrequently happens both the eager and unheeding combatants have not had their duel cut short by some watchful bird which devours them both in an instant Of all butterflies however the little elegant blue Argus butterfly is the most fierce and formidable duellist This little creature seems scarcely to know what fear is When fully animated observes Mr Knapps it will not suffer any of its tribe to cross its path or approach the flower on which it sits with im punity even the large admiral Vanessa atalanta at these times it will assail and drive away There is another small butterfly Papilio phlcBcis however as handsome and perhaps still more quarrelsome frequenting too the same station and flowers and a constant warfare exists be tween them We shall see these diminutive creatures whenever they come near each other dart into action and continue buffeting one another about till one retires from the contest when the victor returns in triumph to the station he had left Should the enemy again advance the combat is renewed but should a cloud obscure the sun or a breeze chill the air their ardour becomes abated and the contention ceases The Papilio plilceas enjoys a combat even with its own kindred Two of them we seldom disturbed when basking on a knot of asters in September without mutual strife ensuing Being less affected by cold and moisture than the argus they remain with us longer and those contentions are protracted till late in the autumn The argus however pays for its fiery spirit with the loss of its beauty for adds our observer The pugnacious disposition of the argus butterfly soon deprives it of much of its beauty and unless captured soon after its birth we And the margins of its wings torn and jagged the elegant blue plumage rubbed from the wings and the creature become dark and shabby It has been suggested that these encounters are not actually hostile but are simply sportive Let us hope it must be confessed rather against hope since the actions of the little blue butter fly just described appear too manifestly hostile to be mistaken that in many cases it is so We have to record an insect duel the particulars of which are so surprising that were they not attested in the most indubitable manner we might be well justified in refusing credence to them In this duel a weapon not unlike a pistol in its action is actually employed and its dis charge though not attended with fire is ac companied both by an explosion and a cloud of smoke The combatants are the calosoma and the bombardierbeetle Calosoma inquisitor and Bracliinus crepitans Let us bring them on the scene The bombardier which loves to creep about among stones under which a large party of its fellowartillerymen pitch their tent has been espied by its great enemy the calosoma The latter being much more nimble than the bombardier rushes towards it and approaching nearer and nearer discloses those fearful jaws into whose dreaded grasp the poor bombardier seems fated to fall The latter runs away at first as fast as it can flee but the enemy more agile in its movements gains upon it at every step The fugitive perceiving this resolves to stand the brunt of a contest with its adversary Our anxieties for the fate of the bombardier now reach their climax and the case seems almost hopeless Just when the calosoma appears to have but one step more in order to secure its victim suddenly a loud explosion is heard and a curling blue vapour rises into the air The bombardier has shot its enemy full in the face and may be now seen flying with all speed But the calosoma has not been mortally wounded It appears wonderfully perplexed and is for the time so stunned as to be un able to renew the pursuit The effects of the explosion however only proving temporary it recovers itself and the chase is continued Infuriated at its disappointment the pursuer urges its way onward after the fugitive bombardier Again it gains upon the latter again the eventful moment of the capture seems at hand when the bombardier turns round and again discharges his piece in the enemys face The same effects ensue The calosoma stupified and in all probability to some extent injured by the powerfully acrid fumes which cover its face again gives up the chase and again upon recovering renews it with redoubled ardour and swiftness The same extraordinary action is repeated again and again by the bombardier and the little artillery man so expert in the use and timing of the discharge of his weapon often escapes altogether leaving the calosoma in no very desirable plight on the field of battle Sometimes however the result is different and whether by stratagem or by speed the calosoma pounces upon its victim and eats him up together with his weapons This may read almost like fable and it be comes therefore necessary to explain that the Brachhms or bombardierbeetle is provided with a remarkable apparatus at the extremity of its abdomen which secretes a peculiar chemical fluid which can be expelled in certain portions at the option of the insect This fluid immediately on its expulsion seems to undergo decomposition in the air and bursts into a little cloud of smoke It does not appear to have been as yet ascertained what is its exact chemical composition In all probability it is some peculiar organic com pound It is stated by a correspondent of the Entomological Magazine that on putting a bombardier into boiling water it let off one of its explosions and the water for about an inch around it effervesced much in the same way as a seidlitz powder The effect of the vapour upon the human skin resembles that of some of the mineral acids M Dupont having taken a nest consisting of more than a thousand individuals near Tripoli had his hands stained quite black in consequence of their contact with the crepitating fluid It is said to be neither acid nor alkaline and to be soluble both in water and alcohol It retains its explosive properties for some time after the death of the insect and explosions may be produced at pleasure until the secreting organs become rigid by pressing on the abdomen The bombardier is able to discharge its weapon seven or eight times or more Our little artillerymen have also the property by bending the joints of the abdomen of direct ing their discharges at any desired object After a time their ammunition appears exhausted and they require repose to renew their stock A singular account is related by Mr Westwood as having been communicated to him by the celebrated traveller Burchell While resting for the night on the banks of one of the large South American rivers he went out with a lantern to make an astronomical observation accompanied by one of his black servant boys and as they were proceeding their attention was directed to numerous beetles running about upon the shore which when captured proved to be a large species of Brachinus On being seized they immediately began to play off their artillery burning and staining the flesh to such a degree that only a few specimens could be captured with the naked hand leaving a mark which remained for a considerable time Upon observing the whitish vapour by which the explosions were accompanied the Negro exclaimed in his broken English with evident suspicion Ah massa they make smoke In a communication to the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal a similar apparatus to that of the bombardier is described possessed by a family of Coleopterous insects the PaussidcE exclusively the inhabitants of tropical Africa and Asia and parts of Australia On these insects being seized they emit a very acrid fluid accompanied by an explosion which is attended with a very strong scent This explosion produced a distinct sensation of heat and its odour was that of nitric acid The skin of the hand was stained dark brown by the vapour and so deep were the stains as to remain eighteen days in one hand No doubt such a creature proves a formidable antagonist to its enemies Our fields and gardens are not unfrequently the scenes for the single combats of spiders Very frequently a spider when placed in the net of another will fly with its utmost speed as if conscious of the danger of drawing out the lawful owner from his silken den But they fight on the ground when once engaged in the battle with infinite ferocity Being by nature of a sanguinary and cruel disposition their duels as may be imagined are fierce and sanguinary too They bite each other furiously with their strong jaws and the issue of the conflict is some times in the death of both the combatants Some times sad to say these duels are between a male and female spider I saw one day says De Geer a male spider gently approaching its mate who was quietly placed in the middle of her web and taking great care not to come incautiously into her presence or to approach too near retiring several times as if frightened Coming at length a little nearer in an instant the unhappy intruder was seized by the cruel female held fast between her jaws and after being enveloped in its winding sheet of web it was devoured by her I acknowledge says this tenderhearted entomologist that this spectacle filled me with horror and indignation If a spider accidentally falls into the net of another the proprietor of the net instantly pounces upon it and destroys it The attacked insect fighting on the defensive struggles to the utmost to tear itself from the jaws of its enemy and often with success although it frequently dies afterwards of the wounds it has received The intruder if larger and stronger than the spider into whose net it has fallen never pursues the retreating owner nor occupies as its own the deserted web They do not appear to like occupying anothers home feeling probably that they are in a strange place Both parties therefore fly from each other with mutual terror and equal precipitation Sometimes a duel of a sanguinary character will ensue between a spider and a scorpion of all insects perhaps the best matched for ferocity although scarcely equally armed The sting of the latter is a far more formidable weapon than the jaws of the former added to which the scorpion has a powerful pair of claws Frequently a very little scorpion will attack a very large spider Seizing it by one of its claws or by both it after a short struggle thrusts its venomous dart into the spiders body the latter almost immediately dies and the murderous duel list does not leave the field until it has entirely devoured the corpse of its miserable opponent a terrible reprisal for the flymurders committed all its lifetime by the latter In the hot summer days in the month of June the naturalist will often be the witness of a duel between two pretty insects Clytus arcuatus which love to inhabit the chinks in the bark of oak trees whither they fly for concealment on the approach of an intruder They are to be found says Mr Bond in the Entomological Magazine on the trunks of felled oak trees in Hainault Forest in June These insects appear in the full sunbeam as happy as they can be running over the surface of the bark occasionally stopping and by the motion of their thorax producing a little creaking noise of gladness until a male of the same species appears on the scene This excites all their angry passions and a duel is sure to follow I have often watched their combats says Mr Bond they stand at a little distance from each other like bulls then rush together with great violence each aiming at the antenna and legs of its opponent On these occasions there is usually a female standing by coolly looking on It does not appear that these duels end in any more melancholy results than just the loss of parts of the antennse and legs of the combatants The Mantes or praying insects or Soothsayers are famous for their duelling propensities Rbsel the celebrated entomologist being desirous of investigating their habits inclosed the young mantes in a glass vessel evidently greatly to their annoyance the insects using every possible effort to relieve themselves from confinement In running around the prison of glass Rdsel often saw them on meeting with their companions fight one another to the death the victor even at its tender age always devouring the remains of its murdered brother The naturalist ignorant of the ferocity of these creatures imagined they must have been impelled to be guilty of this crime by the cravings of hunger had compassion on them and introduced a few ants into their den thinking that the mantes would be satisfied with them for food and would cease their murderous combats Immediately he perceived his error for the ferocious mantes fled before the ants like sheep before wolves and the ants actually fell upon and destroyed the mantes The ants being re moved some flies were introduced and some Aphides the latter they greedily slew and devoured Nevertheless although they had an abundant supply of nourishment they never ceased to attack kill and eat each other when they met so that nearly the whole of the original stock was lost As if to render the mantis more completely identical in its character as a duellist with those of our own species to whom the epithets applied to the poor insect irascible cruel and cowardly are equally applicable it is furnished with a sword or rather with two The forelegs of this insect are sharp flattened sabre like appendages and are wielded with such effect by the insects in their combats as to inflict severe wounds upon each other their demeanour in a hostile encounter is highly remarkable No sooner do they espy each other than both in sects for a time remain stiff and motionless steadily gazing at each other their necks are stretched out to the full extent the wings trem ble expand and flutter while the whole frame quivers with anger Suddenly they rush upon each other with the utmost fury and hew at one another with their swords like a couple of infuriated hussars The duel continues with much ferocity and great loss on both sides until at length the weakest perishes and its trembling limbs are devoured by its victorious opponent The duelling disposition of these fierce insects is turned to an evil purpose in China Taking a savage pleasure in beholding their combats they collect them and keep them in little bamboo cages for fighting and in the summer months boys are to be seen hawking about the streets their cages of imprisoned warriors They make the poor insects fight by putting them into a basin and irritating them with a straw Little requiring any incentive to duelling the insects almost immedi ately fall upon each other and begin slashing at each other with their forelegs or biting each other with such severity as seldom to quit their hold without bringing away at the same time a limb of their antagonist Great sums of money are sometimes staked upon the issue of these duels by the wealthy and the vulgar gamble in a similar manner for trifling coins A wealthy Chinese will sometimes consider a victorious mantis the destroyer of many of its fellows worth several hundred dollars so says Mr Langdon in the illustrated catalogue of the Chinese Collection M Du Hamel has given a singular account of the duels of the mason bees which deserves to be extracted and to form one of the illus trations of the subject of this chapter The mason bee constructs a pretty and ingenious dwelling of sand and particles of stone cemented together Here she deposits her egg and food for the future larva But while engaged in her duties of collecting the spoils of the flowers for the latter purpose one of her own kind finding a comfortable cell all finished to hand or nearly so takes illegal possession of the same The rightful owner returns home to her surprise and excessive indignation she is denied admittance at her own door by the impudent appearance of the intruder from within who seems as if it would inquire of her what she wanted there Resolved not to be turned out of the abode her own skill has constructed the rightful owner lays down its burden whatever it be and offers battle to the trespasser The latter nothing loth steps out of the cell and both insects fly into the air where the duel begins Their combat is now conducted with some skill and they exhibit various stratagems in trying to get the vantage position over their antagonist They rush at each other with the utmost fury not See Frontispiece to this Chapter unfrequently they clash together head to head like bulls At other times they strike sideways or from above at each others bodies and their blows are sometimes so violent that they fall together to the ground While in the air their evolutions are most singular and their manoeuvres highly curious but when on the ground their whole efforts are exhausted in the attempt to thrust each other with their weapons The issue of this duel is sometimes in the death but more frequently in the discomfiture of one or other of the combatants upon which the victor or survivor takes possession of the nest Hornets notorious for their murderous doings among flies are sometimes engaged in the most desperate duels The hornet observes the author of The Journal of a Naturalist is a very pugnacious animal They will fight desperately with each other at times when they meet in pursuit of prey biting each others body and trying to get their mandibles under the head of their opponents to snip it off I one day con fined under a glass two of these creatures which had been fighting One had evidently the mastery but both had been so injured in the contest that they soon died and it is most probable that they fall victims to each others voracity in the cold damp season that usually terminates the autumn of our year The formidable dragonfly the enemy of almost every insect on the wing from the tiny to the great sometimes engages in mortal conflict with one of its own kind One day last July writes a correspondent in the Magazine of Natural History walking down West End Lane Kilburn I observed a pair of the Eshna varia sporting over the surface of a pond While admiring the elegance of their evolutions and the brightness of their colours shining in the sun another male made its appearance This obtruder upon their mutual happiness sans chemonie began chasing the female but upon this the real mate immediately pursued his rival and a very pleasing sight took place They were now actually in a hostile engagement flying at each other by repeated darts the shining armour of the combatants and their wings rustling like tinsel adding not a little to the scene This lasted for about ten minutes when at length one fell into the water apparently from exhaustion and now was exhibited the sagacity of the conqueror who pounced upon his back as he floated on the surface and remained so for a little while During the whole of this exhibition the female continued to skim about in pursuit of prey and seemingly not taking the least interest in the affray She was soon joined by her companion who had left his victim still struggling on the surface but without the power to rise as he had deprived him of his wings Can this be called instinct What could human reason have dictated to operate more effectually The Ichneumons which though they attack differently are also arch destroyers of insects sometimes as the following extract from a paper of Mr Westwoods will show fight over the body of their victimOn May 13th I bred a male and female both of which ate sugar but in the evening the female began to attack some rolled up caterpillars On May 14th she killed a cater pillar but could not get it to come previously out of the leaf she therefore gnawed a hole through the leaf keeping her ovipositor the organ for the deposition of the insects eggs in the caterpillar and gnawing round it as a guide She then withdrew her ovipositor and began eating the caterpillar when she had eaten as much as was under the hole she used her tail as a fork to bring her dinner within reach One thrust of the ovipositor in the head of a larva generally deprives that part of motion caterpillars above half an inch in length require more killing the ichneumons however killed some an inch long In one instance I observed an ichneumon drive out a caterpillar from the folds of a leaf when another ichneumon thrust at it and drove it to the edge of the glass where after a stab or two it became motionless She then began eating it but the former thinking she deserved part wanted also to eat this however the latter would not allow and drove her away Nothing daunted she returned to the charge and un sheathing her ovipositor seemed determined to maintain her rights whereupon the other recollecting perhaps the fable of the bear and the lion allowed her to have a share They ate together amicably until the caterpillar was too small for two when they fought again one of them seizing it in her mouth whilst the other went in search of more but finding none she jumped suddenly on her companion and upsetting her seized the skin of the caterpillar now not worth contending for They are very pugnacious fighting with their wings and legs and frequently lose a dinner an unhappy caterpillar which makes the best of its way off They however spent a considerable time every day at the sugar Captain J Hutton describes a ferocious spider met with in India to whose habits reference will be made on another occasion as sometimes meeting in deadly combat with one of its own species When two of them are confined in a vessel together both endeavour to make their escape as if conscious of their mutual danger If in their efforts to get away they are brought into contact the one instantly seizes the other and devours him the victim making no struggle whatever But if they meet face to face both enter into a wrestling match for life or death And now comes a scene of trial of prowess not less fierce than those of armed knights in tournament but without the surrounding crowd of spectators The furious insects knowing each the others redoubtable strength and force of arms plant their feet firmly on the ground slightly raise their bodies and hold out the two pairs of palpi in front to ward off the attack In this attitude they advance and retire according as either gains a slight advantage endeavouring to throw each other to one side so as to expose some vulnerable part or form an opening for attack Long time the skirmishing continues and for neither side has fortune yet declared the victory The ground trembles under their strugglings and both combatants appear so well versed in the science of defence and attack and so equally matched in strength and cunning that the issue seems as remote as ever Suddenly his footing perhaps loosened by some inequality of the ground one of the duellists is thrust a little on one side The other instantly perceives his vantage and rushing in seizes upon his adversary behind the thorax A spirit of fatalism now takes possession of the latter In despair he gives up all strugglings feeling perhaps that all is vain now his prostrate carcase pierced with gaping wounds lies in the dust and above it stands his victorious foe whose ruthless jaws cease not to mangle the quivering remains until all are devoured These scenes of conflict and deeds of death are to us at least painful to think on and they exhibit a sad view of the propensities of the animal tribes Yet undoubtedly these very propensities accomplish well that part of the plan of Nature for which they are permitted to develop themselves In the wars of Nature some wise and really good object is kept in view by its Great Author The excessive multiplication of one species might entail misery and death upon a far greater number of creatures than are represented by the slain on the battle field or that of single combat CHAPTER VI INSECT GAMBOLS What other spirit can it be that prompts The gilded summer flies to mix and weave Their sports together in the solar beam Or in the gloom and twilight hum their joy SuRELA we must answer none other than the participation of delight to which even insects are not strangers Ours were a gloomy insect history if only filled with deeds of battle and of death But it is not so Strange as it may sound we shall dis cover even in insects abundant evidences that the great God of creation has not been unmindful of their happiness and that while He has given to every one his appointed task He has graciously combined with it the capacity and opportunity for relaxation and whether to the laborious bee or toiling ant has bestowed out of His love a little cup of happiness to sweeten the labours of its lifetime It must be confessed it is extremely difficult for us to comprehend the precise nature of an insects sensations and we are very apt to interpret their actions and behaviour by a too strict comparison with our own But there are certain points so clearly exhibited in insect manners and so strictly analogous to the proceedings of other creatures and of ourselves that we are fully justified in these cases to call these features of their conduct by the same terms that we apply to those of other animals and of our own When we see a kitten at sport giddily racing hither and thither for no other apparent object than its own amusement or when we see the gambols of a lamb around its mother we are at no loss for words to express our thoughts as to its feelings we have a sort of natural perception that these movements are those of a happy creature delighting in the exercise of its newborn powers We must not then refuse the same language in its application to the behaviour of insects when we see them do likewise and we are bound to acknowledge the existence and the reality of insect gambols If we longer doubt on this subject let us betake ourselves to the brook and make the acquaintance of the merriest and most agile of its insect inhabitants the Gyrinus natator For this purpose a mild sunshiny day in April must be selected for the visit or it may fail of its end Let us hear however the pleasant words of Mr Knapp upon the conduct of this little creature Every schoolboy who has angled for minnows in the brook is well acquainted with this merry swimmer in his shining black jacket Retiring in the autumn and reposing all the winter in the mud at the bottom of the pond it awakens in the spring rises to the surface and commences its summer sports They associate in small parties of ten or a dozen near the bank where some little projection forms a bay or renders the water particularly tranquil and here they will circle round each other without contention each in his sphere and with no apparent object from morning until night with great sprightliness and animation and so lightly do they move on the fluid as to form only some faint and transient circles on its surface Very fond of society we seldom see them alone or if parted by accident they soon rejoin their busy companions One pool commonly affords space for the amusement of several parties yet they do not unite or contend but perform their cheerful circlings in separate family associations If we interfere with their merriment they seem greatly alarmed disperse or dive to the bottom where their fears shortly subside as we soon again see our little merry friends gambolling as before Defended behind by a thick hedge and in front by a ditch full of water the one forming an impenetrable barrier the other an impassable moat Huber found a colony of fallow ants whose proceedings were highly remarkable Safe from the attacks of their foes and preserving an abundance of food these ants were as happy as insects could be the whole colony was remarkable for its harmony and good order The insects of which it was composed were distinguished for their kindness and attention to one another and the whole community en joyed a state of peaceful prosperity and increase rarely united in the history of similar colonies The ants being thus free from those distracting cares which vexed their less fortunate neighbours had leisure and apparently inclination for amusements and those of a very singular kind Upon careful observation of this happy family one sunshiny day a large number having been tempted out by the brightness and serenity of the weather they were found to be passing away their time not in work but in play their chief amusements were gymnastic exercises and hide and seek Two ants would approach one another would gently pat each other on the cheek and then resting themselves upon their hind legs would wrestle with each other They embraced struggled with and overthrew each other with the greatest possible goodwill never using any violence in their actions nor discharging their venom as in their more serious affrays Some one more playful than the rest would overturn three or four individuals one after another and getting finally an overthrow itself would resume a more steady behaviour for a time Taking up a position on each side of a blade of grass some would be found gambolling with each other by dodging to and fro now attacking now retreating now pur suing now flying After a vigorous somerset given to a wrestler one would run away and hide itself in one of the galleries Sometimes they amuse themselves in a still more singular way by riding upon one anothers backs M Bonnet says he found a nest of ants in the head of a teazle enjoying the full sun and amusing themselves with carrying each other on their backs the rider holding with its mandibles the neck of its horse and embracing it most closely with its legs Sometimes also they snatch one another up and after carrying the captive a little way in the air they drop it and run away Among the illustrations of insect gambols presented to us by Entomology we must not forget the dances of insects The beautiful but short lived creatures so familiar to us in summer the Ephemerae come together in troops to enjoy this sportive exercise A charming account of a dance of this kind is related by one of the authors of the Introduction to Entomology In the beginning of September for two successive years I was so fortunate as to witness a spectacle of this kind which afforded me a more sublime gratification than any work or exhibition of art has power to communicate The first was in 1811 taking an evening walk near my house when the sun declining fast towards the horizon shone forth without a cloud the whole atmosphere over and near the stream swarmed with infinite myriads of Ephemerae and little gnats of the genus Chironomus which in the sunbeam appeared as numerous and more lucid than the drops of rain as if the heavens were showering down brilliant gems Afterwards in the following year a little before sunset I was enjoying a stroll with a friend at a greater distance from the river when in a field by the roadside the same pleasing scene was renewed hut in a style of still greater magnificence for from some cause in the atmosphere the insects at a distance looked much larger than they really were The choral dances consisted principally of EphemercB but there were also some of the Chironomi the former however being the most conspicuous attracted our chief attention alternately rising and falling in the full beam they appeared so transparent and glorious that they scarcely resembled any thing material they reminded us of angels and glorified spirits drinking life and joy in the effulgence of the Divine favour The hard of Twickenham from the terms in which his beautiful description of his sylphs is conceived in the Rape of the Lock seems to have witnessed the pleasing scene here described Some to the sun their insect wings unfold Waft in the breeze or sink in clouds of gold Transparent forms too fine for mortal sight Their fluid bodies half dissolved in light Some to the wind their airy garments flew Their glittering textures of the filmy dew Dipt in the richest tincture of the skies Where light disports in ever mingling dyes While every beam new transient colours flings Colours that change wheneer they wave their wings In the Annals of Natural History Mr Patterson has communicated some interesting particulars of an infinite host of insects sporting in the air and observed by himself and others at Belfast Wherever there were trees columns of insects were seen and attracted the notice of even the most incurious They began to appear a little before seven oclock and diminished in numbers as the light decreased so that by half past nine few were visible The insects appeared in columns above the trees the shade of colour varying according to the greater or less density of the mass from that of light vapour to black smoke the columns not only differing in this respect from each other but each column being frequently different in different parts They might have been mistaken for dark smoke wreaths but for their general uniformity of breadth and for a graceful and easy undulation similar to that of the tail of a boys kite when at some height and tolerably steady The individual insects flew about in each column in a confused and whirling multitude without presenting in their mazy dance any of those regular figures which gnats frequently exhibit over pools of water The motion of their wings filled the air with a peculiar and not unmelodious humming noise like the distant sound of the machinery of a spinning mill but more varied The columns rose perpendicularly to the height of from thirty to sixty feet and in some instances to the height of eighty feet They were equally abundant over trees of every kind as ash beech birch poplar c and so numerous were these distinct columns that so many as from two hundred to three hundred were visible at the same time As each column was every instant undergoing a change in density of colour diameter elevation or form the phenomenon was one of exceeding interest especially as connected with the living myriads which in these aerial gambols gave expression of their enjoyment I have been unable observes Mr Patterson to define the precise range in which these singular assemblages of insects appeared About Belfast they were everywhere abundant over trees At the residence of one gentleman about a mile to the north of the town they came forth in myriads and when the noise of their wings first attracted his attention he for a moment supposed it to be the sound produced by letting off the steam from a steam vessel at a distance By a lady on the evening of the 11th and by another on the evening of the 13th it was mistaken for the sound of something boiling and one of them hastened from the hall door into the house to see that her servant was not neglecting some culinary matter then in progress At Colin Glen about four miles west of Belfast they were observed on the lth On the evening of the 11th the person who has the care of the Friars bush burial ground adjoining the Botanic garden thought the dark smoky looking columns which he saw were caused by something being burned in the garden and ascended the highest part of the ground to ascertain if such were the case Another gentleman to whom this beautiful phenomenon was also visible writes as follows upon the appearance as presented to his notice At eight o clock in the evening my attention was arrested by what appeared to be several columns of black smoke rising into the air above the trees to a great height Gike the masts of some tall ammirah Looking upon them as smoke I could not understand why a portion of one should occasionally vibrate or as it were break down until it would touch a neighbouring column to the east of it while another would play a similar part towards a column on the west The whole appearance seemed to indicate an extraordinary state of the atmosphere though I could not perceive the gentlest zephyrs blow ing different ways so near each other and about the same time On approaching nearer how ever the phenomenon was explained and proved to arise from columns of a large species of midge instead of smoke The trees along the west side of Donegal Square Belfast are deciduous and chiefly elms Ulmtfs montana about forty five feet in height forming a continuous row and the summit of almost every tree seemed to be emitting smoke sometimes in two or three distinct columns The insects presented them selves in masses of every form the most remark able of which was the tall mast like column One cloud of them appeared above the middle of the spacious street where numbers of persons were assembled gazing and wondering at the singular spectacle There were as usual several swifts Cypselus apus flying about the square and I particularly remarked that although they occasionally passed near the masses of insects they never once swept through any congregated party of them For some time past the weather has been remarkably fine dry and warm as was this day This interesting spectacle was witnessed on the 9th of June 1842 In Dr Forsters Encyclopaedia of Natural Phenomena part i containing the prognostics of the weather p 68 there is the following account of a remarkable vapour that was seen to ascend from an elm tree at Clapton On Sunday evening August 11 1805 I observed a very unusual exhalation from an elm tree at Clapton in the parish of Hackney the particulars of which are as follow between six and seven o clock in the afternoon while sitting at tea the sk being clear and the weather warm and the wind southeast we observed a column of darkish vapour which appeared to arise from the top of an elm tree at some distance it looked about two or three feet high After it had continued a few seconds it disappeared and after a few seconds more reappeared and continued in this manner on and off for nearly half an hour when it became too dark to distinguish it any longer More particulars may be found in the Gentleman s Magazine for 1805 p 816 Having more than once witnessed a similar appearance observes a writer in the Magazine of Natural History and probably under circumstances more favourable than those under which the observer saw the one in question which he has described with such minute and laudable fidelity I have no hesitation in stating that this was not a vapour but a vast assemblage of gnats which when seen at a distance very much resembles thin smoke or vapour and the disappearance and reappearance were obviously caused by the winds gently wafting them or by their own voluntary dancing on and off the spot where they were enjoying their aerial gambols The first time I witnessed an appearance of this sort was on a still summers evening in July and until I approached the spot I felt sure it was vapour or thin smoke which the stillness of the evening had rendered nearly stationary but a close examination which I was able to make disclosed the fact Kirby and Spence in their Entomology vol i p 113 mention a similar appearance over the Cathedral at Salisbury and so strongly were the inhabitants impressed with the idea that it was smoke that fears were entertained for the safety of that celebrated structure An appearance of this description was in Spensers mind when he wrote the familiar stanza beginning As when a swarme of gnats at eventide Out of the fennes of Allan doe arise Their murmuring small trompets sound en wide Whiles in the aire their clustring army flies That as a cloud doth seeme to dim the skies The remarkable hummings in the air occasionally noticed in fine warm weather in the country is probably often connected with the sporting gambols of insect multitudes On a hot day in September and on an elevated woody hill called Alderley Edge in the vicinity of Manchester the writer observed a phenomenon allied to this A pretty loud rushing musical sound was heard in the air rising and falling in soft cadences the origin of which appeared obscure It was at length discovered to arise from the flight of thousands of insects now darting in swarms into the still air now resting again on the trees hard by White of Selborne mentions an audible humming in the air occurring occasionally on the elevated parts of the Sussex Dowms for which he was unable to account These sounds heard by ignorant and superstitious persons have often given rise to pretty but foolish fables on the music of the wilds The poet Thomson notices this sound with his usual elegance Nor undelightful is the ceaseless hum To him who muses through the woods at noon Or dreamy shepherd as he lies reclined beneath the floating shade Of willows grey The sound is often heard without insects being actually within sight yet it is frequently so loud that any one would suppose that a large swarm of bees was in motion and playing about over his head Nevertheless in the great majority of cases it is undoubtedly produced by insects and as Mr Rennie has observed high overhead where the humming is heard a troop of swallows may be seen actively hawking about In the Brazilian forests the sound of insects produces an extraordinary humming noise Mr Knapp speaks of this pleasant country sound in this wise That purely rural little noticed and indeed local occurrence called by country people hummings in the air is annually heard in one or two fields near my dwelling About the middle of the day perhaps from twelve o clock till two on a few calm sultry days in July we occasionally hear when in particular places the humming of apparently a large swarm of bees It is generally in some spacious open spot that this murmuring first attracts our attention As we move onward the sound becomes fainter and by degrees is no longer audible That this sound proceeds from a collection of bees or some such insects high in the air there can be no doubt yet the musicians are invisible At these times a solitary insect or so may be observed here and there occupied in its usual employ but this straggler takes no part in our aerial orchestra It is very probable how ever particularly when this sound is heard in such circumstances and of such a character as described by the last author that it is rather to be attributed to vibrations produced in the air by the heated surface of the ground than to unseen insects Mr Gosse in an article in the Annals of Natural History on the insects of Jamaica gives us an account of the sports of a little butterflyAbout the end of March this little sombre insect occurs playing about the flowering plants and fruit trees of the pastures especially in the lowlands In Blue fields pasture I have observed it affect the bushes of Cleome pentaphylla whose elegant long stamened blos soma probably attract it though it does not rest much on them but pursues its game of aerial play with its fellows in incessant and unwearied pertinacity Half a dozen or more whirl about each other in the air with a rapidity of contortion that the eye of the observer vainly attempts to follow Often two or three will begin to play around an orange tree and in a few seconds others which we had not seen before coming from no one knows where suddenly join in the gambols and thus the little group increases to eight or ten which after a while separate and disperse as invisibly as they came Their small size and great rapidity of motion doubtless helps to produce this effect They delight in the full beams of the burning sun the hottest part of the day is the season of their greatest activity and even the shadow of a passing cloud will spoil their play Some insects like some amongst ourselves prefer the hours of evening for their amusement and gambol in the silent air of night Among these none is more remarkable than the ghost moth In the warm evening hours of May under some hedge in a mead or in some luxuriant low lying pasture our gamholler may he seen commencing his even ing dance Without a partner it is to be seen flying irregularly to and fro now rising now falling now dancing in this now in that direction in a space not exceeding a few yards in circumference Until twilight deepens into night this unwearied gamholler will be seen dancing apparently purely for his own amusement But in reality not so This procedure writes Mr Knapp is not the meaningless vagary of the hour hut a frolicsome dance the wooing of its mate which lies concealed in the herbage over which it sports Alas sometimes in the midst of its innocent pastime a hungry hat wKirrs past seizes on the wretched flutterer and in a moment its life and sports are together ended The insect has received its ominous title the ghost from its always appearing when the shades of evening fall over the landscape the same hour being in the opinion of the learned in such matters the most appropriate time for the appearance of spectres which strangely enough never are seen when most objects are best seen that is in the full daylight A correspondent of the Entomological Magazine describes a very curious fact about humble bees which fairly deserves a place among our records of Insect Gambols He says that when they get on a sunflower they feast so bountifully upon the honey as to become almost as if intoxicated or stupified They become very cross and sleepy If you touch one he leans on one side and lifts the opposite legs into the air as if he were about to fight and plays divers other antics until at length he sidles staggers rolls and falls to the ground and there lies on his back until the effects of his feasting are at an end It is probable that the honey secreted by the sunflower contains some stimulant or narcotic property which produces these ludicrous effects upon the insect feasting too largely upon it Perhaps as singular an instance as any is an account of the playfulness of a stag beetle given by Mr Waterhouse before the Entomological Society He stated that he had kept alive a male specimen of that insect for several weeks his principal object being to ascertain the use of the great mandibles and other organs From his observations it appears evident that the formidable mandibles are employed in the harm less operation of wounding the bark of trees in order to cause the sap to flow on which the insects feed The specimen in question was kept alive by feeding it with sugar and water it had also a penchant for the juice of rasp berries and other fruits It frequently bit Mr Water houses Anger but without producing any injury During its captivity it became exceedingly tractable and even frolicsome Being well fed and so without care the poor insect would show its playful spirit by tossing about a ball of cotton with its mandibles and holding it up in the air just as a kitten does when provided with a similar plaything We need not leave our sitting room to witness the gambols of insects when we can watch those of the humble housefly This little creature seems to spend a large portion of its existence in nothing but pleasure Having quaffed its All from some sugary treasure left in its way it seeks the upper air of our apartments and there commences its curious dances To that mind which does not despise the objects of nature be cause they are small or familiar there is much amusement derivable from the observation of the dance of a fly How pleased appears this tiny creature with the splendid paper palace so curiously cut and magnificently adorned Our housewives anxious to preserve their furniture from the stains of the excrement of this insect are well aware that it delights in a paper bauble and around it will be seen congregated a majority of the flies contained in the room Amusing it is to behold one after another of these little beings dart down into the air sail about in a course of a figure of eight description now and then meeting a companion and play fully tussling with him and then resuming its mazy movements again When wearied of its pastime it flies back again to its palace where it may be seen pluming itself and preparing again for flight So pleasantly and happily passes the little hour of its existence away and it returns to the void from whence it sprang The subject of this chapter is pleasant doubly pleasant after that of the two preceding ones While we have seen insects fighting each other to the death insects whose hand so to speak was against every insects while war like armies have been paraded before our eyes and their deeds of prowess narrated in our ears it is refreshing to read of insect gambols too Insect life is not all battle tumult and distress God has made them happy creatures and they in their humble manner testify to their delight and to His love and goodness in their pastimes and gambollings Let it make us to wonder and adore as we think of the great Almighty Being who upholds the universe of His creation by the word of His power humbling Himself to care for and to give joy and gladness even to an insect CHAPTER VirLANGUAGE OF INSECTS LANGUAGE OF INSECTS This will appear the most surprising part of all in the history of insects Not a few igno rant of the facts of the case will strenuously deny to our humble friends the power of language and those who may not deny the possibility of the existence of such a faculty will not easily give their due weight to the interesting and remarkable facts which entomologists have collected on this subject But why should We from a foolish prejudice deny to insects the existence of a means of intercommunication Is it that they have no voice and have therefore no language This would he a very shortsighted view of matters Insects do not possess a tongue like ours but are we therefore to believe that they have no taste nor organs adapted to convey the sensations of that faculty Neither have insects ears nor a nose like ours Yet they do undoubtedly possess both the senses of hearing and of smelling Because therefore these little beings are not formed like ourselves we have no just grounds for actually believing them to be totally devoid of senses or of faculties in some humble degree analogous to the exalted powers bestowed by God on man himself This point has been much disputed by naturalists apparently violently unwilling to extend to insects any degree of the powers of conversation possessed without a doubt by many other animals It is necessary however that we should as a precautionary measure guard the reader from the supposition that the language of insects if it exists is any such noble faculty as that possessed by man Its extent is doubtless limited and its expressions are feeble and obscure But they accomplish the end in view and appear to afford to many members of the insect world a useful and indeed in some cases indispensable means of communicating and receiving information In entering upon this subject however the language of Huber may well be adopted If insects have a language I cannot give too many proofs of it if I labour under an error the following facts in whatever manner they may be explained will plead my excuse The organs by which this language is conveyed expressed and received are without question in many instances the antennae upon the varied use of which we have before written in the first part of this work These singular appendages of the head are highly organised and endowed with nerves by which any impressions made upon them are conveyed to the nervous centres of the insect The manner in which these organs are employed is various But it consists to speak generally in gently tapping the antennae on some part of the body of other insects What peculiar sensations are thus excited it is impossible for us to conjecture It is very evident however that a means of communication of intelligence actually exists in these manoeuvres as the creature tapped behaves just as if it had heard important news from the other It is difficult to imagine that insects could live in society performing common works and each occupied in duties which though confined to the individual are part of a general scheme without some such means of informing one an other of the requirements of their community or of the existence of some accidental interference with its affairs When we look at a party of bees about to emigrate and find them neglecting their daily toils and engrossed with the preparations for departure can it be doubted that the intelligence of the proposed undertaking has been communicated from one to the other until the whole of the expedition party is made up It has been already mentioned that the evening before emigrating a distinct noise is heard in the hive called piping Dr Bevan says It is now ascertained beyond a doubt that the sharp clear notes uniformly proceed from a princess that is at liberty and that the notes which are uttered in a hoarse key as uniformly proceed from one that is still imprisoned While there remains some doubt upon the whole subject of piping it is still right to mention that it is considered by some to be a means of communication between the queen and the rest of her bee subjects We need not imagine with many who take this view of the question that the queen really treats her subjects to an harangue or that they comprehend it as such Without in the least pledging ourselves to the correctness of the follow ing observation even though it is one of the generally accurate Hubers it is right to introduce it as an illustration of what some entomologists have considered to he a kind of language between the queen and her subjects Modern students of the habits of bees have not as yet succeeded in verifying Hubers statements Speaking of the appearance of a newborn queen he writes The new queen occupied all our attention When she approached the other royal cells the bees on guard bit her pulled her and chased her away Their irritation seemed to be greatly excited against her and she enjoyed tranquillity only when at a considerable distance from these cells This proceeding was frequently repeated throughout the day She twice emitted a very distinct sound standing while doing so with her thorax against a comb and her wings turned on her back in motion but without being unfolded or further opened Whatever might be the cause of her assuming this attitude the bees were affected by it all hung down their heads and remained motionless The hive presented the same appearance on the following day Twenty three royal cells yet remained assiduously guarded by a great many bees When the queen approached the guards became agitated crowded her on all sides bit and commonly drove her away Sometimes when in these circumstances she emitted her sound assuming the position just described from that moment the bees be came motionless This language if such it be and if such it may be called is not carried on by means of the antennae Although Hubers results have not been substantiated there is nothing improbable in the mere fact that bees are influenced by this sound We need not imagine it with Butler a royal oration intend ed to excite the loyalty and the courage of her subjects but since it appears certain that bees are affected by some sounds there seems no difficulty in the belief that this sound is not without its effect upon them also Be it as it may Hubers observation deserves extracting There is little doubt however that the antennae are the chief organs of communication among the bees The effect of removing a queen from the hive sufficiently manifests this The queen is the very soul of the community and her presence is considered essential to its safety by the bees themselves If a hive is gently fumigated the bees are quickly put into a state of great agitation and their first step is to run about and ascertain if the queen is safe Her presence reassures them and quiets their alarms Sometimes the queen has been removed experimentally The bees do not seem to be immediately aware of it In an experiment of Mr Dunbars a period of eighteen hours elapsed before her loss was discovered Frequently however she is missed long before this After her removal until the bees discover their loss all the works are carried on with their usual earnestness and diligence A few bees find that the queen is gone and hurriedly traverse the hive bearing the sad intelligence with them The news carriers inform every bee they meet of this public calamity and do so by curving the antennae and slightly striking them Those who are thus communicated with immediately become agitated with the tidings and fly spreading trouble and confusion through the streets of the city The disorder increasesing the language of the poets the tocsin of alarm resounds all through the hive and the excitement of the insects becomes wider and wider spread Then are the workers seen neglecting their tasks and running over the combs rushing against each other and impetuously hurrying towards the outlets of the hive A scene full of the wildest excitement prevails within and the tumult is audible some distance from the hive Our Queen lost we can imagine every insect out of the eighteen thousand impressed with this distracting news and for a time the whole colony is threatened with ruin Confusion reigns triumphant arts are stopped the nursery is neglected the young ask food in vain and the whole proceedings of the city are revolutionized under their direful mis fortune Outside a similar state of agitation prevails The air resounds with the humming of a thousand wings Bees fly hither and thither return and depart from the hive evidently at their wits end and perhaps anticipating little short of the entire destruction of the community This excited state of matters continues for some hours seldom longer than four or five order is then gradually restored Each insect seems to have the consolation of feeling that all their hubbub cannot restore the lost monarch to them again and they unite to create a new one Can it be doubted that these insects communicate with each other On what other grounds than that they have a language that is a means of interchanging certain ideas can we account first for their clamour on discovering the loss of their queen and secondly for their mutual cooperation in the processes necessary for the creation of a new monarch When we behold one insect in an excited state run to another which is quietly continuing its daily task touch its antennae and then see the latter become filled with a similar excitement and rushing hither and thither to the neglect of the task it had until then been steadily occupied upon what other conclusion can we draw but that the first insect has told something to the second Communication of an idea or a sensation has taken place and that communication is language language not indeed audible to mortal ears nor to be comprehended by a mortal mind nevertheless language adequate to the necessities of these minute beings and heard and understood by them The following account of an experiment instituted by Huber will exhibit in perhaps an equally satisfactory manner the existence of the power of communication by means of the antennae In this case also the queen is the subject of the conversation I divided says Huber a hive into two portions by means of a grating executing the operation with such expedition and delicacy that the smallest agitation was imperceptible nor was a single bee injured The bars of the grating admitted the free circulation of air but were too close for the reciprocal passage of the bees I did not know which half contained the queen but the tumult and hurrying in one soon assured me she was in the other where quietness and tranquillity prevailed The bees might have heard or smelt their queen had the sense of hearing or smell been the means of communication of the intelligence of her presence they could even have seen her had sight been the sense which rendered her presence evident to them Yet they acted in all respects as if they had for ever lost her even while she remained separated from them only by the distance of a quarter of an inch Now follows an experiment on this subject still more singular A frame was removed from one of Hubers glass hives and replaced by a box of the same dimensions covered within by a grating which allowed the transmission of the antennae but was too small for the heads of the bees Waiting until the queen appeared in the front of a comb in view the frame was opened and her insect majesty was taken from amidst her companions without exciting their alarm She was immediately confined in the glass box destined to receive her but that she might not suffer too much from a situation so different from what she had been accustomed to some bees of the same hive were introduced along with her from which she experienced the wonted attentions Singularly enough the distress commonly following the departure of a queen was not manifested on this occasion Everything remained in order the bees did not forsake their brood during a single moment their labours were uninterrupted nor was any attempt made to form royal cells or to make preparations for the creation of another queen Thus it was evident that all the bees knew that they had no need to replace their sovereign that she was not lost neither when she was subsequently restored to them did they treat her as a stranger but recognised her immediately Every one has heard the tale which some call fable about the Coeur de Lion a lonely prisoner in a dungeon cell and his faithful subject and harper Blondel recognizing his royal master though immured in the prison the tale goes that Blondel sang one stave of a favourite song of the Kings to which he replied in the next But we have already seen that it is not by the sense of hearing that the bee can recognize her royal mistress in prison Truly a beautiful and a curious spectacle was to be witnessed at the prison grating The queen stood close to it with her antennae passed through the bars Outside her prison were multitudes of her affectionate subjects all engaged in inquiring after her safety thrusting their antennas through in every direction while she on her part had enough to do in quieting her subjects by conversing with them by means of the same organs and assuring them of her perfect safety and health There remained this exem plary monarch holding a levee all day long replying to the interrogations of every fresh comer with the most unwearied condescension Several of the more patriotic and loyal in sects resolved to effect the escape of their royal mistress from prison and attempted but in vain to pull her through to themselves seizing her legs and doing their utmost to drag her through the too narrow grating Finding this an unsuccessful attempt they contented themselves with paying her every mark of attention that respect and affection could dictate and diligently fed the captive monarch during the whole term of her imprisonment It appears fully certain that bees have a kind of watchword or signal by which they can communicate with each other in going from and returning to their hives If a strange bee attempts to enter it is as it were challenged by the sentry on duty at the entrance and if unable to give the proper pass is said to be instantly killed It sometimes happens however that several hives have the same pass and then their several members rob each other with impunity In these cases it is said that the bees alter their signs and the enemy is then detected and instantly executed In what these signs consist is not known Wasps are also in pos session of a means of communicating with each other They apprise their comrades of the place whence they fetch the materials of their nests so that one set will always be found carrying one material another always another Bees have been noticed to visit one another s dwellings without any hostile or predatory intention and in these visits it is highly probable that a sort of insect conversation takes place At any rate it appears impossible to explain the intercourse on any other grounds than that of friendship A very remarkable instance of visiting occurred to Mr Golding in March 1832 His boxes though at some distance from each other were marked No 4 and 5 and both families were vigorous the former possessing an old queen the latter a young one No 4 appeared to commence the visiting which in its progress became reciprocal and was amicable throughout No 5 was shut up the first night and continued so for about a week during which time the bees of No 4 gradually discontinued their attempts to gain admission and did not renew them for another week The weather during this period proved cold but on the 4th of April a day or two previous to the setting in of fine weather the visiting recommenced was quite reciprocal and was so rapid as to communicate considerable heat to the glass windows of both boxes At No 5 there was a great throng of visitors Yet the bees did not let their mutual attentions lead them to neglect the duties of their respective hives On the contrary both hives increased rapidly in weight Gradually however the insect friendship abated of its ardour and at the end of a week they visited together no more It is well that we can add they did not as in a case before narrated terminate their acquaintance by a furious battle Viewing the antennae as the organs most importantly concerned in the language of bees it is curious to remark the effect produced by cutting these organs off Huber cut off both the antennas of a queen bee and the result was most extraordinary The poor insect seemed affected with delirium She ran hither and thither about the hive dropping her eggs at random and evidently in a state of deep agitation She was unable to direct her proboscis aright in order to be fed with honey and when she did so it was plainly only by chance She made several ineffectual attempts to quit the hive Yet the bees her subjects did not remit any of their attentions to her but they were received on her part with great indifference Another queen was mutilated and introduced into the hive Under other circumstances the first would have pounced upon her rival and a combat unto death would have followed Now it was quite different The mutilated queens met without even recognising one another and without the smallest indication of resentment The bees did not apparently know which was the right queen since she had lost the means of communication with them so both were treated alike and with the customary honours But on another queen with both her antennas un mutilated being introduced the bees seemed immediately to perceive that she was not their own monarch and they accordingly seized her bit her and kept her so close a prisoner that she became almost suffocated The antennae of a number of workers and male bees were then amputated The bees refused to ascend the combs no longer shared in the common operations and generally remained below where a little light was admitted from the entrance which seemed to be their sole attraction It appeared as if they felt that they could now no longer occupy their post in the daily business of the hive and the insects seemed in a sort of halfwitted condition Mutilation of only one of the antennae produced no such effects the bees going on with their labours as usual These facts are interesting and important But it is extremely difficult to assign any single function to organs of such complicated uses as the antennae That they are organs of exploration and of receiving impressions from the world without of various kinds can scarcely be questioned and that they are also a means of intercommunication among certain insects appears to be highly probable if not actually proved by the facts already detailed M P Huber considers that an antennal language is in use among the ants also He says The antenae the organs of touch and possibly of some sense unknown to ourselves are the principal organs of language among the ants Their position in front of the head their flexibility their structure which consists of a series of joints endowed with extreme sensibility their intimate connexion with instinct ail combine to convince me that the antennae 5lay a most important part in the history of the ants We have seen these insects frequently use them on the field of battle to intimate approaching danger and to distinguish their own from the enemy s troops In the interior of the ant hill they serve to warn their companions of the presence of the sunbeam in their excursions they serve to indicate the route and in their recruiting to determine the time of their departure Their most singular use is however to apprise their companions of their hunger and in this respect no tongue could be more eloquent The poor hungry insect who has been stopping at home hard at work anxiously awaits the return of the commissary ants who have been out provision hunting One of the latter has just returned and is met by one of its companions in the following pretty manner The hungry ant begins by striking with both its antenae very rapidly the antenae of the forager ant Both insects draw closer to one another their mouths wide open and the forager gently transfers a portion of the food it has collected into the others mouth During this operation the ant which is being so kindly fed incessantly caresses its companion by quickly tapping it with its forefeet on the head as we might pat the head of a good child all the time moving its antennae with every manifestation of delight The forager appears also able to inform her companions that she has returned home with a load of provisions and invites them by means of her antennae to come and partake thereof Says Huber This language is so clear to our insects that they appear instantly to comprehend its import Even the young larvae as soon as they feel the gentle tap of the antennae present their mouths to receive the food so kindly offered to them The antennal language would doubtless require profound study if we wish to be acquainted with all the impressions communicable by its means It is like all the other signs I have observed among these insects based not upon any visible gestures but upon the touch of certain parts otherwise it were of little service in the interior of the anthill where the light of day never penetrates In consequence of this peculiarity a single insect cannot make itself understood by more than one of its companions at a time but the impression is communicated from one to the other with wonderful rapidity M Huber was disposed to believe that the ants could make themselves understood even by other insects In illustration he narrates the follow ing fact Watching a single brown ant on a branch of a thistle he saw it at first pass without stopping some aphides which it did not disturb but shortly after stationed itself near one of the smallest and appeared to caress it by touching its tail alternately with its antennae with an extremely rapid movement like the play of the fingers in a shake upon the pianoforte He saw with much surprise the fiuid honeydew escape from the body of the aphis and the ant take it into its mouth Its antennae were then directed to a much larger aphis than the first which on being caressed after the same manner discharged the nourishing fiuid in greater quantity and this the ant immediately swallowed In the same manner it proceeded to a third fourth and fifth after which it retiymed to its nest Huber concludes from this that the aphides understand the antennal language of the ants But this idea is probably incorrect and has its place more in the imagination than in fact since if we touch an aphis gently with a camels hair pencil it ejects the honeydew as readily as if in reply to the solicitations of an ant The very idea also of an insect of a totally distinct kind comprehending the means of intercommunication possessed by the ants is highly improbable The supposition is more violent than that of an Esquimaux and a New Zealander conversing together and comprehending one another But the general question of the existence of a language among the ants is not affected by this error Let us limit our signification of the word language to the following definition the means by which the insects express their desires their wants or even their ideas if we may give so exalt ed a title to the impulses of instinct and it will not be difficult to furnish illustrations in proof If the ants had no means of communicating their mutual impressions it would be possible to irritate those which are running about over the outside of their dwelling without alarming those which are in the interior of the anthill This is far from being the case as any of our readers may for himself behold if he will make the experiment The effect of attacking these valorous insects is very curious the greater portion of those on the outside refuse to fly and do battle with incredible ferocity Casting themselves upon their hind legs they stand upright take aim with their exploding apparatus and discharge a shower of venom at the two legged and gigantic foe their jaws all the while wide expanded and their aspect sufficiently terrible to strike some quail of terror into the heart of a strong manone blow of whose hand would crush hundreds of them But watch while these gallant defenders of their homes are thus engaged fighting the foe a party is seen precipitately retreating and plunging with impetuous haste into the subterranean city Their errand is to give the alarm the city is attacked the walls are being scaled the enemy is at the gates a heroic few are fighting unto death unassisted The city is moved To arms cry the citizens and in an incredibly short space are seen pouring tumultuously out of the gates legions of insect warriors so fierce so angry so heated that it is evident they have been fully informed of ail that has taken place outside and on learning it have rushed to the rescue or to a triumphant death While this takes place outside others within equally informed of the danger and of its magnitude snatch up the infant insects which in summer time are always placed near the surface of the anthill and fly with their precious burdens to the deepest caves of the city where they are secure from all danger Can any actions more strongly demonstrate the fact that a means of conveying their impressions actually exists among these minute beings What more rational than this could man himself do under similar circumstances gifted though he be with mind speech and reason The manner in which intelligence is thus conveyed has been carefully studied by Huber who gives us the following account of the proceedings of a city of Herculean ants which he attacked When he disturbed several ants which were at some little distance from their companions either by observing them a little too closely or by gently breathing on them he saw them immediately run towards the others gently strike them on the corselet and communicate to them by this means their anger or their alarm They ran from one to the other in a semicircular direction jostling sharply those which did not immediately bestir themselves The alarmed became in turn the alarmists running about in various circular lines and stopping to strike with their heads all whom they met in their career Instantly these signs were repeated in every direction the workers ran about in great agitation over the surface of the tree where their nest was and hundreds from the interior warned of the existing danger probably by a similar sign defiled out of the city and joined themselves to the crowd The same signals however which produced upon the workers the effects described caused a very different impression upon the male and female ants The latter as soon as warned of the peril fled precipitately to the depths of the hollow cavity in the tree But not one re tired until it had received the intelligence from the worker and the signal of flight Sometimes these last did not seem quite to comprehend the signal which greatly excited the alarmists and caused them to strike them repeatedly as if to say no time must be lost begone at once Generally speaking however they were understood instantly and the flight of the insects was immediate A most ludicrous scene narrated by the same author seems to point equally distinctly to the possession of a certain language by these insects The artificial formicary with which he experimented being placed on a stand with four legs was isolated from the floor by the legs being placed in vessels full of water The ants de lighted to come down and quaff the refreshing fluid in the hot summer days One day when several were busy drinking the water which had soaked through the fibres of the wood and which they preferred to the fluid in the vessels Huber did something to disturb the little water drinkers The greater part ran immediately up the leg of the stand to the anthill above a few however remained undisturbed and quaffing away with all their might But one of the more cautious perceiving the peril of its companions undertook the hazardous task of descending the leg to apprise them of their danger Approach ing one frolicsome insect who was thoughtlessly amusing itself in this position of peril the alarmist struck it sharply and so thoroughly frightened the gamboller that he took to his legs and ran up to the nest with great alacrity A second and a third were then warned and each retired in all haste to the nest But a fourth the only one now left stood drinking at the very edge of the water altogether heedless of the proceedings of its companions In vain did the bold alarmist strike it again and again the drinker would not quit its place nor forego the pleasures of the draught though at the peril of its life The alarmist much concerned at this insects shocking foolhardiness took hold of one of its hind legs and gave it a sharp pull The other opening its jaws turned fiercely round as if to say let me alone and then began to drink again But scarcely had it time to taste the seducing fluid when the alarmist out of all patience seized the water intoxicant between its mandibles and carried it struggling and kicking up to the safe asylum of the nest When an ant has lost its way or when the whole community is about to seek some new place of abode there are many singular illustrations of the existence of a kind of language among these beings One which has found a suitable abode will come back to its companions make certain gestures with its antennae and direct them in the route they should adopt to reach the spot Every time they meet each other in these journeys they stop and appear to hold a conversation by means of their antennae after which they seem to be better acquainted with the proper road Dr Franklin related to the Swedish traveller Kalm the following observation of his own with reference to the language of insects Having placed a pot containing treacle in a closet infested with ants these insects found their way into it and were feasting very heartily when he discovered them He then shook them out and sus pended the pot by a string from the ceiling By chance one ant remained which after eating its fill with some difficulty found its way up the string and thence reaching the ceiling escaped by the wall to its nest In less than half an hour a great company of ants sallied out of their hole climbed the ceiling crept along the string into the pot and began to eat again This they continued until the treacle was all consumed one swarm running up the string while another passed down It seems highly probable that the one ant left behind at first had conveyed the tidings of the treasure to its companions and directed their steps to the only way of access to it namely across the ceiling and down the string Among the bees there are certain signs which seem to be almost as well understood as the more tangible means of communication among them and the ants On breathing through a cleft of their habitation offence is immediately taken by the inhabitants and sharp interrupted buzzing sounds are produced The workers on perceiving these sounds immediately put themselves in agitation and direct them selves away from the side at which the air has entered Among the white ants the signal of alarm is a loud hiss often so loud as to imitate that of a serpent and to startle the incautious traveller who has disturbed one of their armies Mention has already been made of the signals employed by the soldiers among these insects The loud tap of the former which seems like a command to expedite the work being responded to by the obedient hiss of the latter and by redoubled activity in their proceedings House crickets have a somewhat similar signal If sur prised by a candle when running about in a room at night they give two or three shrill notes which seem to warn their companions that they may escape to their crannies and lurking holes and so avoid the danger The following anecdote related by Messrs Kirby and Spence strikingly manifests the existence of a sort of communication of ideas even among a species of beetle A German artist a man of strict veracity states that in his journey through Italy he was an eyewitness to the following occurrence He observed a species of Scarabasus busily engaged in making for the reception of its egg a pellet of dung which when finished it rolled to the summit of a small hillock and repeatedly suffered to fall down its side apparently for the purpose of consolidating it by the earth which each time adhered to it During this process the pellet unluckily fell into an adjoining hole out of which all the efforts of the beetle to extricate it were in vain After several ineffectual trials the insect repaired to an adjoining heap of dung and soon returned with three of his companions All four now applied their united strength to the pellet and at length succeeded in pushing it out which being done the three assistant beetles left the spot and returned to their own quarters Here we may conclude our illustrations of this interesting subject In every natural science truth unmixed with fable and unexaggerated by the imagination ought to be a chief object of our search We feel this especially necessary to be borne in mind when considering such a subject as that of the present chapter If the distinguished naturalist Fabricius could feel that nothing in natural history was more difficult and abstruse than an accurate description of the senses of animals how much more abstruse is the investigation of their language or means of intercommunication if they possess any We are told by Gbedart that in every humblebees nest there is a trumpeter who early in the morning mounts to its summit vibrates his wings and sounds his trumpet for a quarter of an hour so rousing up the inhabitants to their daily task Here is a mere fable unworthy a real student of nature Again we are informed by Butler that the young queen and the old queen of a hive hold a touching conversation mingled with ear nest entreaties lamentations and groans on the part of the former This is an example of truth exaggerated by a too vivid imagination Let us in our thoughts on the language of insects avoid both errors and be content with the delightful solid truths offered to us by Modern Entomology From all that has been said it appears certain that among several insects a sort of language really exists that is they can tell tidings to one another which according to their nature produce different effects upon the auditors The organs by which these communications are made are among bees and ants more generally the antennae than other parts of the body But both among these and other insects other signals which are equivalent to an obscure and imperfect sort of language also exist producing impressions upon their senses which influence and determine their conduct On the whole the language of insects is limited to a very few ideas enough however to secure their wellbeing enough to manifest the wisdom love and power of God who made them M Huber sensibly observes There is no thing repugnant to our conceiving the subsistence of a language among beings whose instinct is so enlarged as that of bees whose conduct is compounded of a thousand proceedings and which combined in great numbers cannot share their respective labours or aid each other suit ably without the means of mutual communication The like observation applies to all insects dwelling in society as well as those larger animals regulated by the same conditions CHAPTER VIIIAN INSECT CONCERT THE CICADA EIELDCRICKET AND GRASSHOPPER ARE THE INSECT MCSICTANS Drunk with the dewdrop perched on twig so lofty Noisy Cicada oer the wild waste sounding Sawlike the feet which to thy side thou pressest Drawing sweet music Music may perhaps be too fine a term to apply to the sounds made by insects Their powers of song if we may so speak are feeble and their notes monotonous and perhaps to many ears little melodious At the best insect music is not comparable to that of the feeblest songsters among the birds Yet it is pleasant of its kind and when Far from all resort of mirth Save the Cricket on the hearth we must acknowledge that the sharp unitoned minstrelsy of this little being is far from un pleasing to the ear or to the heart In birds and in man music is connected with the organs of the voice and is produced by the rapid vibration of certain structures in the air expelled from the lungs But the case is different in insects Not being furnished with organs like our lungs or an air passage like our windpipe their music cannot be produced by the same or similar mechanism to our own They have no voice properly speaking they have not therefore in strict propriety the power of song Instead of a voice those insects which are capable of producing sound are sup plied with musical instruments In place there fore of calling these insects songsters they are more correctly designated musicians and their song is in reality a musical performance It is proposed by M Goureau in an elaborate article in the Annates de la Societe Entomologique de France to call the sounds produced by insects by the term stridulation Let us however confine ourselves to the simpler and more intelligible expression insect music explaining as we proceed the various instruments with which insects are furnished and among which we shall find types of the violin the drum the timbrel c Let us begin with our domestic and field musicians the crickets This little creature commences his minstrelsy when the shades of evening close in when the fire burns brighter and all is made snug for the night If we would best enjoy this musicians performance let us put out the lights leaving only the glowing embers to Teach light to counterfeit a gloom then out comes the musician out comes his partner and a troop of insects run along the floors while the performers strike up in their lustiest tones The learned Scaliger we are told so delighted in the crickets music that he was accustomed to keep them in a box in his study where their performance cheered and enlivened the tedious hours of his application Messrs Kirby and Spence tell us quoting from an old author that these little musicians are kept in a sort of iron oven and sold in Africa at a high price to procure sleep Our little minstrels thus taking the place of those human performers whose duty it used to be to lull royal and noble personages to composure or to sleep Sometimes however our musicians are more noisy than agreeable and a war of ex termination is threatened against them by the occupants of our kitchens This however in consequence of a popular superstition that some evil will befall the destroyer of our minstrels does not often happen Occasionally sad to relate these mirthful creatures are wilfully poisoned with a red compound well known to most of our cooks It is only in the adult state that crickets are musical they are mute in the larva and pupa states It is only the male insect which can produce music the female being silent and it is generally for the amusement and attraction of his partner that our musician strikes up and commences his performance The field cricket generally places himself at the entrance of his habitation and there begins to sing His partner attracted by his performance approaches and on meeting he generally lowers his tone to a sweeter and softer sound interrupted by a short sharp sound no doubt intended as a greeting The insects then take several little turns about the habitation from which they do not go far Ludicrous is it to behold this pair the musician elate and proud of gait preceding his mate and walking with short steps a little before her When this insect sings it begins by stretching out its legs placing his breast upon the ground at the same time slightly elevating the abdomen in this attitude he raises the wing covers and rubs them briskly against each other The sound produced is louder and stronger in proportion to the rapidity of the motion and the degree of pressure The musical instruments of the crickets closely resemble each other in all the species of these insects It consists simply in the peculiarly formed wing covers or elytra On examining one of these it is found to consist of a thin dry transparent membrane divided into numerous compartments by the nervures which intersect it M Goureau gives a minute description of this apparatus too technical and complicated for these pages The arrangement however of the nervures of these wing covers is such that when the one is crossed over the other they rub against each other and so produce a vibration sufficiently rapid to create a musical sound The musical instrument of the cricket is compared by M Goureau to a tabor divided into a great number of compartments by cords fastened to the skin which is crossed by a large knotted cord the manner of playing on which is supposed to be by passing over this cord a plate of some sonorous metal By raising the wing covers and rubbing them against each other by means of a pin the sound may be artificially produced on a living insect or even on a dead one provided its joints retain their pliability The sounds thus produced are not so loud as those which are made by the insect when alive and at liberty but are sufficiently so to enable any one to recognise them As a satisfactory proof that such is really the mechanism by which our shrilling friends produce their evening concert if one of the wing covers be cut off the insect becomes silent It may be seen trying to sound its tabor but no longer able to draw forth its music Whilst it may appear to some that there is little pleasing to the ear in the shrill minstrelsy of the crickets either by the fireside or in the field Yet to many few sounds are more delightful in a balmy summers day than the vigorous music of the cricket of the field when the herbage and the hillside are vocal with their songs Then our minstrels form a not unimportant part of the scenes which delight the eye and please the ear and we can adopt the language of the poet as our own feeling the truth that Sounds inharmonious in themselves and harsh Y et heard in scenes where peace for ever reigns And only there please highly for their sake The grasshopper is the next minstrel to whom we shall call attention The male insects alone are capable of producing music which they do for the satisfaction of their mates Three or four sometimes collect together and a grass hopper concert is then performed upon the leaves of a shrub Impassioned musicians are the grasshoppers Intense is the delight they appear to take in their performance and wonderful the emulation with which each endeavours to outdo the others In these concerts it has been observed that the musical instruments are not always quite in tune The grasshoppers do not seem to be endowed with as much taste and ear for music as they are with love for the art In their mutual performances some will be heard in a very high clear treble tone per forming with all their might whilst others with equal vigour draw forth only dull harsh bass notes out of their instruments little in accord with the first It is generally supposed that the latter are old minstrels who have worn out their instruments by frequent use the former being young performers upon new instruments Upon close scrutiny of our performer and on detaching his wing covers we shall see the instrument on which he plays On looking at the right wing cover from above observes M Ooureau we see an oblong transparent space which is of a hard consistence and sonorous to which the name of drum may be given It is surrounded by a border which is thickest at the interior margin to which I have given the name of treble string On the top of the left wing cover viewed from below a dilatation is seen analogous to that of the right but not so transparent What is most remark able about it is a thick nervure striated like a file which crosses it in a nearly parallel direction to its upper border which I have named the bow By the mutual action of these parts against one another the music is produced When the sounds are dull and harsh it is supposed the teeth of the bow have become worn by frequent use The saddled grasshopper Ephippiger is a very noisy musician Both male and female insects are performers and their music has been com pared to that produced by passing the nail up and down a fine toothed comb stopping a short time between each turn The male insect how ever is the louder minstrel of the two To an insect violinist in the shape of the locust we have now to introduce the reader All species of these insects are not equally good performers nor are possessed of equally perfect instruments Their song is sharp and monotonous composed of innumerable couplets of eight or ten seconds in length separated by an interval of two or three seconds Seated upon a leaf or shrub our musician strikes up and for some time performs with great assiduity If he then finds that in spite of his tunefulness no female insect has come out to hear him he flies off and settling on another plant begin § again If however he sees his companion approach his performance becomes still more vigorous but upon her drawing nearer still its tone is altered to a softer and tenderer note The musician while performing stands on his four front legs and doubles the hind legs up against the thighs he then rubs his thighs rapidly against the wingcovers If a firstrate per former he will be seen rapidly moving his limbs in this manner and for a long time Sometimes the insects may be seen performing without producing any sensible tones but in all probability our ears are unable to distinguish these finer notes which may fall with softened sweetness it may be upon the senses of the insects themselves The instrument itself is analogous to a violin In the wing covers are several arrangements of nervures over two transparent spaces which pro duce a structure comparable to that of a violin These nervures resemble the strings and a pin cannot be passed over them without causing them to vibrate The thigh of the hind leg of the insect is so formed as to represent in some degree the bow with which the violin is played When the locust performs he passes his thighs against the wingcovers pressing them at the same time and in so doing the thigh acts upon the wing cover as the bow upon the strings of a violin and music is produced The sounds are livelier and louder in proportion as the movements are more rapid and the pressure more considerable Our next musician the Cicada has been immortalised in the songs of the Grecian poets Supposed say Messrs Kirby and Spence to be perfectly harmless and to live only upon the dew they were addressed by the most endearing epithets and were regarded as all but divine The verses of Anacreon are so beautiful and have been so well rendered by that pleasant writer Rusticus of God aiming that we shall transcribe them Happy Cicada perched on lofty branches Deep in the forest cheerful as a monarch Tasting the dewdrops making all the mountains Echo thy chirping Thine is each treasure that the earth produces Thine is the freshness of each field and forest Thine are the fruits and thine are all the flowers Balmy Spring scatters Husbandmen proudly do at upon thy friendship Knowing thee guiltless of a thought to harm them Thee mortals honour sweet and tuneful songster Prophet of summer Thee all the Muses hail a kindred being Thee great Apollo owns a dear companion Oh it was he who gave that note of gladness Wearisome never Songskilful earthborn mirth and music loving Fairylike being free from age and suffering Passionless and pure from this earths defilement Almost a spirit These are very pretty lines but Virgil calls the cicadas querulous and declares that they burst the very shrubs with their din which is not quite so complimentary Whether the Grecian species of these insects were really capable of producing pleasant sounds or no it is not easy to say It appears most probable that the insect was looked upon rather as an emblem of the science of music than as being itself so very melodious in its note Or perhaps sounds which to us are unpleasing might have had a charm for Grecian ears to which ours are strangers In other countries the cicadas are less favourably received in their minstrel capacity and if we contrast the matter of fact account given in Dr Shaws Travels in Pennsylvania with the poetical description of our musician given above the result is quite ludicrous In the hotter months of summer says this writer especially from midday to the middle of the afternoon the cicada is perpetually stunning our ears with its most excessively shrill and un grateful noise It is in this respect the most troublesome and impertinent of insects perching upon a twig and squalling sometimes two or three hours without ceasing thereby too often disturbing the studies or short repose that is frequently indulged in these hot climates at these hours Messrs Kirby and Spence state that they were informed by Captain Hancock that the Brazilian cicadas sing so loud as to be heard at the distance of a mile This is almost as if a man of ordinary stature supposing his powers of voice increased in the ratio of his size could be heard half over the world We are fortunate if such be the case that these tremendous performers have never yet made their appearance in Britain It is stated how ever that a species of cicada has been found in the New Forest in Hampshire Mr Bennett in his Wanderings in Australia gives us the following account of the cicada in that country As the summer season was now fully set in the previous silence of the woods was broken by the incessant shrill chirping noises which resounded over them occasioned by the male cicada The musical organs or drums are only found in the males The aborigines call these insects galang galang and formerly used them as food first stripping off their wings They ate them in the raw state that is as the native blacks told me When no white feller here no black feller get bread or yam meaning probably that before the colonization of the country its native inhabit ants were without bread or yams and were compelled to subsist upon our minstrels My notice was particularly directed by the natives to the drums in the male insects as the means by which they produced their thrilling sounds at the same time adding in their peculiar En glish Old woman galang galang no got no make a noise implying that the females do not possess these musical instruments There are several species of this genus known in Australia During rain these insects are silent but recommence their clamour on the appearance of fine weather The fact of the female cicada being mute was also known to the Greeks who have on record the following couplet on the subject Happy the Cicadas lives Since they all have voiceless wives Happy we too for surely if both male and female insects were as clamorous as they have been described some parts of our world would be uninhabitable for their din Dr Hancock in a communication to the Entomological Society states that The insect whose song is most frequently heard in Guiana is the Cicada clarisona the Aria Aria of the Indians and Razor grinder of the colonists In the cool shades of the forests it may be heard at almost every hour of the day but in George town its song commences as the sun disappears below the horizon At Georgetown this insect was never heard in 1804 when Dr Hancock first visited the place but now it is very com mon probably in consequence of the shelter afforded by the growth of many trees and shrubs in the gardens which have since been formed there The sound emitted by it is a long continuous shrill tone which might be compared almost to that of a clarionet and is little interrupted except occasionally by some vibrating undulations Now for a description of its instrument Reaumur has given a most elaborate account of the insect and its musical organ which is quoted in the classical work of Messrs Kirby and Spence from whose pages we shall extract a part of it If you look at the underside of the body of a male the first thing that will strike you is a pair of large plates of an irregular form in some semi oval in others triangular in others again a segment of a circle of greater or less diameter covering the anterior part of the belly and fixed to the trunk between the abdomen and the hind legs These are the drum covers or opercula from beneath which the sound issues When an operculum is removed beneath it you will find on the exterior side a hollow cavity with a mouth somewhat linear which seems to open into the interior of the abdomen Next to this in the inner side is another large cavity of an irregular shape the bottom of which is divided into three portions Of these the posterior is lined obliquely with a beautiful membrane which is very tense and reflects all the colours of the rainbow This is called the mirror and is supposed to modulate the sound But even all this apparatus is insufficient to produce the sound of these animals one still more important and curious yet remains to be described This organ can only be discovered by dissection a portion of the first and second segments being removed from that side of the back of the abdomen which answers to the drums two bundles of muscles meeting each other in an acute angle attached to a place opposite the first ventral segment of the abdomen will appear These bundles consist of a prodigious number of muscular fibres applied to each other but easily separable Whilst Reaumur was examining one of these pulling it from its place with a pin he let it go again and immediately though the animal had been long dead the usual sound was emitted On each side of the drum cavities when the opercula are removed another cavity opening into the abdomen is observable This apparatus constitutes the true musical instrument of the cicada all the other parts are subsidiary to it and in various ways arrest and modify the sound In the cavity last described you will discover a semiopaque and nearly semicircular concave convex membrane with transverse folds this is the drum Each bundle of muscles before mentioned is attached by little tendons to the under surface of this membrane and by its play will consequently draw in or let out the drum In so doing a sound is produced which passing under the drum covers before it can be heard in the air is modified by them If in a childs drum we fasten by means of sealing wax a string to the outer surface and another to the inner surface of the parchment at one of the ends and sharply pull either of these ends we shall get a good idea of the drum of the cicada Well may we say what adorable wisdom what consummate art and skill are displayed in the admirable contrivance and complex structure of this wonderful this unparalleled apparatus M Goureau seems disposed to believe that the emission of air from the body of the insect performs an important part in its song Upon its manner of performance he has the following observations When the insect sings in a box no motion is observable in the wings nor in any other part of the body when I held it between the fingers in such a way as left the abdomen free its voice was as strong as usual But if I held its body and pressed the drum covers against the abdomen it was dull faint and stifled If on the contrary I raised the abdomen so as to leave the cavities which are generally covered by the drum covers open the voice became unusually loud and strong This led me to conclude that the drum covers perform the office of keys and serve to modify sounds but these keys instead of being move able as in wind instruments are fixed the abdomen is moveable This will explain why the Cicada when at liberty is constantly moving its abdomen during the time it is singing alternately elevating and depressing it By this means it obtains a variety of sounds from the musical instrument and produces modulations which though we are not sensible of them are assuredly perceptible to the insect himself or to the female whom it is his object to please When savage nations go out to war with one another so soon as each party perceives the advancing hosts of their enemies they endeavour to intimidate each other by the most terrible war cries The din of their musical instru ments rising with the yells of the warriors and the clattering of the weapons of war is expected to strike terror and dismay into the heart of the foes Perhaps when one side boasts of two or three warriors whose bowlings are unusually awful such a result may occasionally be really produced But we have to speak of an insect gifted with a musical instrument by which it can successfully intimidate its insect enemies and more than once has terrified men and women This insect is the deaths head hawkmoth Ache rontia atropos The sound emitted by this insect is peculiarly plaintive We are told that a certain divine who was also an entomologist having had one of these insects brought to him when he was unwell was so moved by its plaintive minstrelsy that instead of devoting it to destruction and to impalement for his cabinet he gave the creature its life and liberty When taken captive or threatened with danger the insect invariably begins performing upon its lugubrious instrument and continues to do so until silenced by death or set at liberty again The instrument of this insect has been long disputed about The accurate Reaumur fell into a great error and supposed its music was produced by the friction of its proboscis against the palpi Others have not been more fortunate in their attempts to solve the problem The author we have frequently quoted in the pre sent chapter appears to have discovered the true source of its melancholy music From his researches it appears that in the abdomen of the insect there is seated an apparatus not unlike that of the cicadae He discovered a muscle connected with a hollow drum like cavity the action of which rendered it as in the former insects concave or convex alternately In so doing the sound was produced In all the instances of insect minstrelsy hither to alluded to the principles on which their instruments are constructed are very simple and are referable to two heads 1 The instrument is a thin transparent membrane caused to vibrate by an apparatus resembling the bow of a violin or 2 It consists of a thin sonorous membrane acted on by a muscle which throws it into alternately convex and concave forms causing it to vibrate in so doing From this it is evident that the Grecian poet who wrote the pretty lines at the head of this chapter was ignorant of the mechanism by which the cicada produced its music The insect is there represented as pressing its sawlike feet to its sides and so drawing sweet music that is as a violinist whereas it will be plain from all that has been written that the cicada is more properly speaking a drummer only that it has its drum muffled and so complicated as to constitute a very remarkable instrument Madame Merian who however was a little too credulous and has related much that is incorrect and absurd states that in the forest of Surinam she was informed by the natives that an insect abounded which produced music like that of a lyre It was called by them the lyre player The subject of the music of insects need not be pursued farther Enough has been said to justify the claims of insects to the powers of minstrelsy although their music is not of the most refined character Humble though their note and ofttimes harsh their tone we cannot doubt that they therein show forth the praise of their great Creator not to a less degree than the most gifted warblers among the feathered tribes CHAPTER IX INSTINCT OF INSECTS There is not a more difficult and perplexing subject in all natural history than that of In stinct Men of science have perplexed them selves and their readers in no ordinary degree in their attempts to make the matter clear and we remain still unenlightened upon the great question at issue the nature of instinct and its relation to reason It appears that much dispute might have been saved had naturalists been content with the possession of facts manifestly outlying their power of explanation and with out creating confusion by attempting to account for them had they simply been satisfied with the knowledge of the habits and actions of insects thus revealed to them We are at a loss oftentimes to account for the actions of our fellow creatures or to define the impulses which could have actuated them How much more ignorant must we be of the causes and impulses which deter mine the manoeuvres of an insect between whose sensations and our own there can exist little if any analogy We shall learn from the facts to be detailed that God in his abundant good ness and wisdom has given to insects a light to guide their plans for their mutual welfare and to assist them in combating unexpected difficulties in so doing This light is sufficient of its kind and being so why need we vainly perplex ourselves by unsatisfactory and profit less disputations Let us rest content with the following view of the case It is needful for many insects to have the faculty of adapting themselves to circumstances which may befall them in the performance of their ordinary occupations It is needful also that they should possess a certain degree of knowledge of skill and of memory these faculties may be comprised under the general term instinct We may now there fore proceed to the more pleasant and interesting duty of exhibiting some illustrations of the intel liofence of these minute creatures LieutCol Sykes describes the actions of some ants which annoyed him in India which appear strikingly to set before us the instinct of these little beings He says The magnitude of these ants their voracity and remarkable tact in discovering saccharine matters render them repulsive troublesome and costly insects in a house I have had the greater part of a tub of sugar candy left in my storeroom at Poona and weighing nearly half a hundred weight consumed by them during a few months absence from home And my friends here related to me instances of similar depredations carried to the extent of the consumption of a whole tub of sugar candy However incredible the fact may appear I will not omit to notice an instance of their instinct literally bordering upon human intelligence It was the practice in my family to leave the dessert consisting of fruit cakes and particularly China preserved fruits constantly standing upon a sideboard in an enclosed verandah off the dining hall A cloth was thrown over it and to prevent the access of insects the legs of the table were placed upon low pedestals in little stone pans filled with water When I first took possession of the house the inhabited part was not infested with this species of ant but the attraction of the sideboard soon occasioned their introduction The channel of water surrounding the pedestals did not prove a sufficient barrier The pans were shallow and the channel not wider than two lengths of medium sized ants When the water was low they waded across and when the pans were full they boldly pushed over and succeeded in catching hold of the opposite bank with their forelegs ere they sunk and once over they soon reached their rich repast by the legs of the table and in the morning I found hundreds congregated in the China sweets They were put to death but each succeeding day presented similar hordes of equally bold and successful adventurers I now had the legs of the table surrounded daily with a belt of turpentine just above the level of the water and this proved effectual either from its nauseous and deleterious scent or from its clamminess holding them by the feet For some days the sweets were unmolested but eventually the ants found their way back to them although not in such numbers as before and I did not readily discover by what means The edge of the table was about an inch distant from the wall and with greater facilities of access they did not risk the danger of passing the gulf between the table and the wall But reduced to extremities by my precautions the largest ants now essayed to pass it holding on the wall by the hind legs while the front legs were stretched out to touch the edge of the table and the contact enabled very many to cross The table was now removed from the wall beyond the maximum stretch of the largest ants and I flattered myself that I had triumphed over their perseverance and ingenuity But to my infinite surprise in a few days the sweets teemed as usual with the intruders and I was puzzled in no small degree to account for their reappearance Accidentally passing the table I observed an ant upon the wall about a foot above the level of the sweets it fell and instead of passing between the wall and the table and alighting upon the ground the insect fell upon the table Can it be possible I said to myself that this fall is designed I stood to observe with the most intense curiosity Another ant ascended and dropped with similar success another and another followed and there was no longer doubt that instinct if instinct I must call it had made them a match for reason But what is this instinct or impulse of nature which enables an animal to do that which in those things that man can do result from a chain of reasoning and in things which men cannot do is not to he explained by any efforts of the intellectual faculties by which the captive and expatriated pigeon on its release flies directly and unhesitatingly through the pathless air to its distant home by which the far removed dog returns to his master by previously untravelled and unknown routes by which the bedbug it is said if cut off from access to the bed by the feet or draperies ascends to the ceiling and falls upon the canopy and by which this ant was enabled to defeat all my precautions The insects which live in communities like the ants and bees must be expected to furnish us with the most striking displays of insect intelligence They appear in fact to have been peculiarly gifted by the Divine Author of Nature with faculties of a superior order to those possessed by insects that dwell alone and they are consequently able to seek for food under peculiar emergencies when other insects would be at a loss what to do and would remain in active or in despair The Rev W Cotton relates the following anecdotes of the conduct of some bees which came under his notice He says I have a hive called the Observatory hive because in it I can observe or watch all the bees doas Huber would say mark all their manoeuvres It is made of two plates of glass placed in a frame just one inch and fiveeighths in the clear this gives them room to build one comb and no more so I can see every bee at work and not even the queen herself can long hide from me I put a swarm in and they built a comb which by a sudden jerk was broken off from the top I knew the bees were not strong enough to lift it up into its place so I was curious to see what they would do and I watched them narrowly They first held the broken comb in its place just as Huber saw their first cousins the humblebees do they next made wax and fixed the broken comb firmly in its place They then went on to saw off with their sharp and strong jaws just enough of the comb which pressed against the glass to let themselves pass One poor bee had got pressed between the plate of glass and the comb They very kindly began to saw away the comb in that place which set the poor bee soonest at liberty They might have begun cinywhere else but instinctive kindness led them to begin where they did This they did more evenly than I could have done for them the size of their bodies being the rule by which they worked A razor could not have cut sharper Last of all they lengthened the cells on the other side so that the whole comb was the same thickness as before though made of long cells on one side and short on the other Another time I saw a bee in the same hxj for he had slipped down with his feet to the glass and his back toward the comb so that he could not get a firm hold to exert that power which was needful to set him free Another bee saw his hard case and went straightway to succour him laid hold of his hind legs wdth his jaws tenderly no doubt but I am sorry to say he did not stand by him till he got free The same writer put the ingenuity of the bees to the test in another way He had a strong stock of bees in a straw hive on the top of which he put a large glass which they soon filled with comb as the light was quite kept out this glass had a flat wooden top with holes upon which bell glasses were placed Taking a single flower of stock and lifting ofl one of these glasses Mr Cotton dropped the flower in amongst the bees This created a great tumult among the inhabitants of the hive who determined to eject the intruding flower They seized it with their powerful mandibles carried it up into the bell glass which had been restored to its place and worked it round and round trying in vain to discover the aperture by which so unwelcome an object had been dropped into their midst The bell glass entirely covering the top of the hive they were of course unable to find out the place and the flower in their bustle dropped down again Again with incredible efforts they carried it though twenty times the weight of a bee to the bell glass And again it fell They did this many times with great perseverance until Mr Cotton com passionating their efforts lifted the glass when they flew away with it and returned to the hive by the proper entrance In this case the bees seem to have been aware that by carrying the flower to the entrance of the hive they would have created great confusion and turmoil among its inhabitants and they therefore made the attempt to carry it away by the same way that it came During this Herculean undertaking one bee which had a strong grip of the flower dragged it up the side of the glass whilst six others were hanging on to it which is as if one man were to drag up a perpendicular glassy precipice an omni bus with its two horses and six passengers inside Dr Bevan relates a very striking illustration of the power of instinct in bees which occurred under the observation of Mr Walond Inspecting his bee boxes at the end of October 1817 he perceived that a centre comb burthened with honey had separated from its attachments and was leaning against another comb so as to pre vent the passage of the bees between them This accident excited great activity in the colony but its nature could not be ascertained at the time At the end of a week the weather being cold and the bees clustered together Mr Walond observed through the window of the box that the bees had constructed two horizontal pillars between the combs alluded to and had removed so much of the honey and wax from the top of each as to allow the passage of a bee In about ten days more there was an uninterrupted thoroughfare the detached comb at its upper part had been secured by a strong barrier and fastened to the window with the spare wax This being accomplished the bees removed the horizontal pillars first constructed as being of no further use What an amount of engineering skill and perseverance was exhibited in this undertaking The conduct of bees in glazed hives is often highly remarkable and exhibits their power of adapting their operations to the circumstances in which they may be placed very strikingly since the material of which in great part their house is constructed namely glass being an artificial production would never be presented to them in a state of nature Dr Evans tells a singular story of some bees thus placed Having frequently observed he writes on the inside of my glass hives prior to the formation of cells a number of gluey spots ranged at regular distances I supposed them at first to he intended as a kind of landmark pointing out the divisions of the future streets On reexamination however I found them evidently used as so many footstools on the slippery glass each bee resting on one of these with its middle pair of legs while the fore claws were hooked with the hind ones of the next above thus forming a living ladder by which the workers were enabled to reach the top and pursue their favourite plan of commencing their combs there Huber put the ingenuity of bees to remarkable trials in his experiments on the modifications of their architecture in glazed hives He tried to confound the industrious architects by placing them in a hive the top and bottom of which were made of glass upon which the bees are unable to lay the foundation of their cells in consequence of its slipperiness The sides of their dwelling were however of wood But the bees were not at a loss how to proceed even under these trying circumstances They sent a body of architects up to the upper angle where the glass and wood met and there the insects began to build constructing their combs perpendicular to one of the sides and as regularly as those which they usually build under a horizontal surface Huber put the bees to a still greater trial As the now testified their inclination to carry their combs in the shortest way to the opposite side of the hive for they preferred uniting them to wood or a surface rougher than glass he covered it with a pane Whenever this smooth and slippery material was interposed between them and the wood they departed from the straight line hitherto followed and bent the structure of their comb at a right angle to what was already made so that the prolongation of the extremity might reach another side of the hive which had been left free Varying this experiment in several ways the bees still constantly changed their combs whenever the smooth surface of the glass was presented too closely and they always sought the wooden sides Huber thus compelled the poor insects to curve their combs in the strangest shapes by placing a pane of glass at a certain distance from their edges These results indicate a degree of instinct truly wonderful The bees seem aware of the un suitableness of glass for their dwellings to form the foundation of their cells upon yet in a wild state no such material hinders their proceedings and we can only wonder without being able to explain how they are able to act in emergencies like these to which in a state of nature they would never have been exposed Nor can we the less wonder at their together altering their structures as if animated by one common mind or directed by a single individual How can every one of the insect architects each bearing its own part become acquainted with the plans of its companions who are hard at work at some distance from itself In this the insects display an intelligence superior to man for our labourers require a ruler and guide and all their proceedings are planned and fixed by a single person who directs and overlooks the whole Two remarkable anecdotes of the instinct of bees have been narrated by different authors which deserve remembering The first occurred to M Reaumur A snail having crept into one of his hives early in the morning crawled about for some time and then fastened itself and its house by its slimy adhesiveness to one of the glass panes where but for the bees it would probably have remained till either a moist air or its own spume had loosened the adhesion The bees having discovered the snail immediately surrounded it and formed a border of the sticky glutinous material called propolis to which allusion has been before made round the verge of its shell This they continued to raise until the edge of the shell was at last so securely fixed to the glass as to become immoveable either by the moisture of the air from without or by the snails secretion from within The unhappy snail was thus kept a close prisoner within his own domicile and without the smallest hope of being ever able to get out again The bees had in fact treated him like some of the unfortunate criminals of whom history has narrated that cruel men have caused them to be immured alive The second is still more singular It is re lated by Maraldi and is quoted by Dr Bevan in his hook on the bees A houseless snail or slug had entered one of Maraldis hives The bees astonished at the boldness of the intruder crowded around it and instantly a hundred envenomed weapons were thrust into its defenceless body The wretched slug pierced with wounds quickly expired and now the bees were in as great an emergency as ever Their united efforts were unequal to the dislodgment of the carcass of the slug and if permitted to remain it would by its putrefaction empoison the whole atmosphere of the hive and endanger the lives of the citizens As if aware that such would really be the case they quickly covered it over with an impervious coating of propolis until the animal was so thickly enveloped in this glutinous varnish and so tightly glued down to the hiv board that the gases of putrefactive origin could not escape and in all probability putre faction itself would be long before it could commence in consequence of the exclusion of atmospheric air It were difficult to select instances of insect instinct more striking than these We need not multiply examples of instinct by reference to the proceedings of the bees or even to those of the ants which are little less surprising but which will have been amply illustrated in the preceding chapters Let us therefore take some individual examples of instinct which we shall find to fall little short of the ingenuity of some of the actions of our friends the bees and ants Messrs Kirby and Spence state that a dung beetle which has the instinct to envelope its eggs in a pellet of manure which it rolls for this purpose until it is sufficiently round to please the insect when it can meet with the excrement of sheep abandons its rolling propensities as unnecessary and in the pellets ready formed deposits the germ of its future young In this case the beetle evidently perceives that the work is done to hand and makes no attempt to perform an operation which under other circumstances it proceeds to do without hesitation The preliminary operation of the larvae of many butterflies in spinning a sort of silken mesh or web which is fastened to the wall in order to attach themselves to while undergoing the change from larva to pupa and subsequently has been described in the first part of this work Mr Spence however states that the larva of a common cabbage butterfly in a box covered with a piece of muslin did not spin this preparatory web The insect seemed to be aware that the muslin would do equally well for its attachment and it accordingly fixed itself to this material and so underwent its regular changes Dr Darwin informs us that walking one day in his garden he perceived a wasp upon the gravel walk with a large fly nearly as big as itself which it had caught Kneeling down he distinctly saw it cut off the head and abdomen and then taking up with its feet the trunk or middle portion of the body to which the wings remained attached fly away But a breeze of wind acting upon the wings of the fly turned the wasp round with its burden and impeded its progress Upon this it alighted again upon the gravel walk deliberately sawed off first one wing and then the other and having thus removed the cause of its embarrassment flew off with its booty From this fact he was led to believe that the insect really reasoned about the difficulty with which it met and adopted the wisest course to remove it But from some observations of Mr New ports it appears that this is only its usual habit upon every similar occasion In September 1884 Mr N had an opportunity of ob serving the predaceous habits of the wasps in a large garden in which there was a numerous colony The common white butterflies were exceedingly abundant and the wasps were flying about very actively On a sudden a specimen of one of these butterflies toward which he was looking was precipitated to the ground from the thistle blossom upon which it had been very quietly seated and upon going up to it immediately he found a wasp very busily employed in cutting off its wings and head and afterwards its legs When it had done this it took up the dismembered body and poising it between its own legs flew away with it to a neighbouring tree where upon following it it was found mangling the body of its prey as if to destroy the little remaining vitality While doing this the wasp had suspended himself upon a leaf by the claw of one leg which supported its whole weight while its other limbs were employed in holding and turning the mangled body of the butterfly When it had done this sufficiently the wasp rolled up the body between its second and third pairs of legs and poising itself upon its wings flew away towards its nest During the same morning several similar opportunities of observing the conduct of the wasps presented them selves and their mode of capturing and sub sequent treatment of the prey were always the same From these facts adds Mr Newport I am induced to believe that Dr Darwins opinion respecting the existence of a reasoning power in insects as deduced from the fact he observed was too hastily formed and that in stead of its proving this it shows us that insects have an unerring instinct very similar to but perfectly distinct from reason and that this instinct prompts them always to act in the same manner Insects frequently exhibit much intelligence in disposing of their prey after they have destroyed it The memorable battle between the warrior wasp and the kakerlac described in the first part of this work may be recalled It was there mentioned that when the victorious warrior had dragged the huge carcase of its conquered foe to the entrance of its dwelling the body of the latter was too large to go in at the wasps street door In this emergency the wasp rushing out cut off the limbs of its victim and after so doing was enabled to drag it into its cave The following account of the proceedings of a minute larva of herculean strength and indomitable courage will exhibit the same ingenuity manifested in a different way Walking one evening writes a correspondent of the Zoologist in my garden my attention was arrested by an earthworm upon the surface of the soil turning itself from side to side in a strange un wonted manner I immediately saw that some thing was wrong with the poor animal and that it was in fact in the agony of death but from what cause I did not at first discover Prsently a little black larva about half an inch long which had been couched quietly near the worm ran to it and bit it near the head This had the effect of increasing the agonized writhing of the worm The same thing was repeated several times until the motions of the dying animal became less violent The aggressor then commenced a survey of the surrounding ground prying into every little hole within a circle of nine or ten inches radius sometimes disappearing entirely underneath the surface for a few moments At length it appeared to have found one every way suitable to its purposes situated a short distance from its victim The larva then commenced dragging the worm head foremost towards the hole But a small lump of earth lay between these and to have dragged the worm round this would have materially increased the resistance It overcame the difficulty by laying fast hold of the mandibles some little distance from the head and lifting it over the obstacle The body being now nearly in a straight line with the hole it again seized hold of the head and dragged it by little and little until it came to the mouth of the hole which was an old worm hurrow it then commenced pulling it in until all hut about half an inch of the worm had disappeared which was in about a quarter of an hour from my first seeing them When it had got to this point of the operation I dug up both the destroyer and his victim and carried them forthwith to an accu rate balance where they were weighed and the worm was found to weigh eighteen grains the larva not quite one There are in this fact two things worthy of notice the surprising muscular strength of the courageous larva which was as if one man were to drag eighteen or twenty others all tied together for the distance of a hundred yards over broken ground and the ingenuity it displayed in lifting the body over the obstacle and in the selection of a sub terranean cavern sufficiently large to accommo date the carcase of its victim Sir Joseph Banks relates a singular instance of a sort of change of instinct in a spider which happened to have been mutilated As he was writing at Spring Grove a spider of the web spinning species of more than the middle size passed over some papers on the table holding a fly in its mouth Much surprised to see a spider of this description walking about with its prey and struck with somewhat unusual in the gait of the animal he caught it and placed it in a glass for examination On so doing he perceived that it had lost five of its legs which accounted for the inability of the creature to spin a web The curious circum stance of its having changed its usual habits SINGULAR HABIT OF A SPIDER 311 and having become a hunting spider instead of a spinning one as well as a wish to learn whether its legs would be reproduced induced liim to preserve the creature and to observe its conduct Soon after its confinement during which it was regularly fed with flies the cripple attempted to form a web on the side of the vessel but performed the task very slowly and cumsily In about a fortnight it had completed a very small web on which it generally sat In tine its lost limbs were reproduced but were shorter than the others and the creature was then able to form a tolerable web in which it seated itself resuming its old habits Reviewing these indications of the intelligence skill and adaptation to circumstances displayed by insects we cannot fail to be struck with the closeness of their resemblance to those actions which in man flow from the impulse of reason and power of thought There is this great difference between the actions of man and those of these wise little creatures that those of man are directed by a faculty linked with his immortal being and that in man this faculty or reason grows graduiilly more and more perfect according to the culture bestowed upon it The insect is the creature of a day its allotted period spent it returns to nothingness and in the insect its knowledge intelligence or instinct its skill and every faculty with which the great and glorious Maker of the world has endowed it are generally perfect et once It learns little or nothing from experience and in old age is no wiser than in youth Let us however leave these difficult and abstruse subjects for the more enchanting paths of real insect history CHAPTER X INSECT RAPINE In endeavouring to present a faithful account of the habits and manners of insects their food and means of procuring it must not be omitted The battlefield the scene of single combat do not present us with a view of insects in their expeditions for food and though we have again to return to scenes of bloodshed and of mortal strife the particulars connected therewith amply justify us in so doing and the reader will doubtless find matter of wonder and interest in our relations concerning insect rapine In the first part of our Life of an Insect and in the details of larva voracity there entered into sufficient account has been given of the vegetable food of insects Our present chapter will there fore be confined to those subjects coming strictly under the title insect rapine It may be learned with surprise by some of our fox hunters that there are insects which hunt too One of the most common of these may be observed by any one who in summer will hunt for on walls and windowsills or in old gardens This is the hunting spider During the summer of last year one of these little creatures an active brown and white spotted fellow with an awful looking pair of jaws lay a captive in a glass jar on the writers table Never was such an agile hunter as he A housefly was introduced into the jar instantly our hunter was on the alert Lifting up his head to take a good observation of his victim which was unconsciously crawl ing up the glassy prison wall he prepared him self for the pursuit The fly stopped The wary hunter crept slowly up the side of the jar every now and then stopping to observe whether his approach was perceived or not Moving stealthily upwards he reached a height superior to that occupied by the poor fly but at some distance from it He then crept round the side until he had gained a position exactly over the flys head and above it at the length of about two inches and a half All this time the fly was busy cleaning itself with great dili gence evidently in total ignorance of the proximity of so formidable and crafty a foe The spider began to move slowly downwards to its victim It was really a curious spectacle now to watch its approach Raising one leg at a time it crept downwards like an animal of the feline tribe until at a distance from the fly which it judged to be within its power of leap ing Taking the precaution to attach itself by a thread to the side of the jar it prepared itself to spring upon the heedless insect below Swift as an arrow from the bow the spider leapt towards the fly the latter had just sprang into the air and the hunter caught it in his cruel grasp while on the wing Now he ex perienced the value of his precaution in securing himself by the rope The fly struggled violently in his embrace and both insects whirled about in the air But there was no escape from those relentless jaws and the strugglings of the captive became gradually feebler and more feeble until they finally ceased the victor climbing up his rope end at his leisure and sucking the life juices of his prey This spider did not hesitate to attack large flies Sometimes it missed its aim and then slank away as if ashamed It was afraid of a bluebottle fly and ran away in trepidation before it In the pages of an old WTiter William Bar tram on the natural history of the Floridas an account is given of a hunting spider in terms more vivid than we can pretend to As I was gathering says our author specimens of flowers from the shrubs I was greatly surprised by the sudden appearance of a remarkably large spider on a leaf At sight of me he boldly faced about and raised himself up as if ready to spring upon me His body was about the size of a pigeons egg of a buff colour and together with his legs was covered with short silky hair on the top of his abdomen was a round red spot encircled with black After I had recovered from the surprise and seeing that the wary hunter had retired under cover I drew near again and presently discovered that I had disturbed him on a predatory expedition against the insect tribes I was therefore determined to watch his proceedings I soon ob served that the object of his wishes was a large fat humblebee that was visiting the flowers and piercing the nectariferous tubes The cunning intrepid hunter concealed bis approaches with the circumspection and perseverance of a Siminole when bunting a deer advancing with slow steps obliquely and under cover of dense foliage and behind the limbs and when the bee was engaged in probing the flowers he would leap nearer and again retire instantly out of sight under a leaf or behind a branch at the same time keeping a sharp eye on me When he had gotten within two feet of his prey and the bee was intent in sipping the delicious nectar of the flower with his back next the spider he instantly sprang upon him grasping him over the back and shoulders and botli disappeared I expected the bee had carried off the spider but I soon saw them both together suspended by a strong elastic thread which the spider had fixed to the bough from which he leaped to the bee The rapidity of the bees wing as he endeavoured to extricate himself made them both together look like a moving vapour until the bee became wearied with whirling In a quarter of an hour he was completely exhausted by his struggles and the wounds of the butcher became motionless and expired in the arms of the devouring spider who ascending the rope with his game retired to feast on it under cover of the leaves The spiders present us with perfect types of the hunting propensities in other animals Cunning fierce and strong woe to the luckless insect that falls in their way Sometimes they conceal themselves in a flowery cave all hid with enshrouding leaves or surrounding petals Here the wary insect lies concealed awaiting the passing by of some heedless traveller A giddy fly comes seeking honey in the neighbouring flower and in an instant finds itself locked in the deadly gripe of the secreted murderer who pounces upon his victim with the swiftness of thought and the utmost precision of aim Others still more artful actually pretend to be dead and lie prostrate with moveless limb until the prey draws sufficiently near to be seized when they start up and the victims fate becomes sealed The Rev Mr Sheppard say Messrs Kirby and Spence has often noticed in the fen ditches of Norfolk a very large spider which actually forms a raft for the purpose of obtaining its prey with more facility Keeping its station upon a ball of weeds about three inches in diameter probably held together by silken cords it is wafted along the surface of the water upon this floating island which it quits the moment it sees a drowning insect not as we might conceive for the sake of applying to it the process of the Humane Society but of hastening its exit by a more speedy engine of destruction The booty thus seized the pirate devours at leisure upon its raft under which it retires when alarmed by any danger Other spiders hunt along the edges of the pools and now and then they chase their prey upon the glassy surface of the water itself We need not allude to the wellknown stratagem of the web of itself one of the most beautiful of structures and ingenious in stratagem Long since Madame Merian in her work on the insects of Surinam gave an account of a gigantic spider which destroyed and devoured small birds Much doubt upon this relation existed for a length of time Madame Merians statements were so often incorrect that the account was looked upon as entirely fabulous She gave an engraving of a monstrous spider in the very act of murdering a bird which was smaller than itself It appears however that the statement was not altogether incorrect as to the murderous propensities of a species of great spiders In the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal an interesting communication on this subject is given by Captain Thomas Hutton The spider he calls by the appropriate name Galeodes vorax He says its usual size is about from to inches in length and the body is equal to a thrushs egg The head is armed with two strong and formidable double jaws the ends sharppointed and extremely hard and horny In seizing its prey one pair of jaws keeps hold while the other is advanced to cut and they thus alternately advance and hold till the victim is sawed in two My first observations on this species writes Captain Hutton were made in 183 at Mirza pore where it is very abundant and of a large size During the rainy season it was my constant habit on a fine evening to spread a sheet upon the ground near my house upon which was placed a lantern to attract insects The spiders seemed to value this device as much as our entomologist Two or three of these ravenous creatures would make their appearance at the edge of the sheet but at a respectful distance from each other and no sooner did a moth or a beetle or a cricket alight upon the sheet than it was instantly snapped up and devoured by one or other of them There seemed indeed to be no end to the appetite of these creatures for they continued to seize and devour everything indiscriminately that came within their reach even to large and hardwinged beetles cutting them to pieces with their powerful jaws with the greatest ease Many were the deadly fights observes our author I witnessed among these marauders as they trespassed on each others beats to get possession of some newly alighted prey and often was I obliged to kill them in order that I too might in turn obtain some of the booty These voracious monsters like many predacious animals roam about at night in search of food living in the clay beneath stones and in holes in the ground Captain Hutton kept one of these fierce creatures in a vessel the bottom of which was well supplied with earth It soon began to dig a hole and in a very short time succeeded in making itself a subterranean retreat in which it usually resided seldom coming forth beyond the mouth of its den It proceeded to dig out the earth at first with its strong jaws cutting it away in a circle and having thus loosened the soil it gathered it together into a heap with its anterior palpi and threw it out behind as a dog does in scratch ing a hole It turned out that this specimen was a female and in due time it was surrounded by about fifty young ones It was deeply interesting to watch the insect parent at this season From the general bad and ferocious character of the creature we might have expected that she would at the first craving of appetite have fallen upon her helpless young ones But the allwise and benevolent Creator has endowed even this fierce and sanguinary creature with that most powerful feeling maternal love and the very tiger of the insect world became at this time subdued into the anxious and tender mother Placing herself in the front of the aperture of the cave she kept watch over her infant family and like a careful sentinel suffered no living creature to enter her cave without first examining it with the utmost caution Straws were thrust in on the supposition that she might be aroused to anger and turn upon her young and devour them But all in vain though she bit at the straws in evident anger not once did she injure her own offspring which were fondly crawling over her Some beetles and flies were thrown in and instantly were swallowed up Two or three of her owti young ones were then thrown before her with a beetle or two thinking to deceive her and make her in the blindness of her fury commit infanticide But she was not to be thus deceived The unfortunate beetles were instantly seized and devoured But the mother knew her own offspring and drew them into her den without the slightest injury Yet this same tender parent when her family was all dispersed resumed her ferocity of dis position and voraciousness of appetite A lizard three inches long exclusive of its tail was entirely devoured The spider leapt upon it seized it immediately behind the shoulder and never quitted its hold till the whole was consumed The poor animal struggled violently at first rolling over and over in agony but the spider kept firm hold and gradually sawed away with its double jaws into the very entrails of its victim After this meal the voracious destroyer remained gorged and swollen for a fortnight A young sparrow about half grown was placed under a bell glass with the spider The moment the luckless bird moved the spider seized him by the thigh which he speedily sawed off in spite of the sparrows fluttering and then as the poor bird continued to struggle in pain the savage spider seized him by the throat and soon put an end to his sufferings by cutting off his head It did not however devour the bird nor any part of it but seemed satisfied with having killed it Two young musk rats were confined with one of these large spiders and were both killed by it M Moreau de Jonnes relates of a large spider common in the Island of Martinique that it chases far and wide in search of its prey and conceals itself beneath leaves for the purpose of surprising it and will climb the branches of trees to devour the young of the humming bird This spider is said to throw itself upon its prey to cling to the body by means of the double hooks with which the ends of its feet are furnished and it then strives to reach the head that it may insert its fangs between the skull and front bone of the neck Its obstinacy and ferocity in fighting and hunting cease only with its life Mr Macleay states that he found in some woods near Sydney in Australia a young bird suspended in the web of an enormous spider It was already half eaten he observes and the spider was in the act of sucking its juices And in Percivals account of Ceylon it is recorded that there is in that island an immense spider the legs of which are not less than four inches long its body being covered with thick black hair The webs this spider is said to construct are strong enough to entangle and hold even small birds which are said to form its usual prey The driver ants of whom mention was made at an earlier part of this volume are a nation of insects which live by rapine and for such a mode of existence are well calculated by the ferocity of their character and the formidable nature of their attacks The author from whom the former account of their proceedings when emigrating was taken gives us the following description of them The head of one of the largest class when dissevered from the body grasped the finger of an attendant so furiously as to cause an immediate flow of blood It was kept in a glass tumbler from 3 p m till the next morning at eight o clock when the finger was again applied and apparently as severe a wound as before inflicted Another individual of the same class was decapitated at 7 a m and at half past nine the next morning 26j hours from the time of decapitation a piece of news paper was held between the jaws which it grasped and retained with considerable force Dr Savage then applied the small finger of his right hand which it bit severely indeed so powerful was the grasp that the point of the mandibles met beneath the cuticle It then partly withdrew one mandible and pointing it more perpendicularly penetrated deeper then the other and thus at every alternate stroke giving to the mandible a direction more vertical wounding and cutting wider and deeper precisely in the manner of the insect in possession of all its parts and powers The sensation at each thrust was like that of a pin and equally painful and when the mandibles were withdrawn the blood flowed as freely This head continued to give signs of life for more than thirty six hours after decapitation The body to which it be longed lived still longer more than forty eight hours No insect can be more ferocious and determined upon victory They fiercely attack anything that comes in their way conquer or die is their motto When a live coal of fire has been held before them though so obnoxious to heat they rushed at it with indescribable ferocity releasing their hold only in death Woe to the luckless being opposed to warriors so redoubtable and obstinate as these In order to see what they would do with it a dead fowl was placed near their dwelling and they were roused several times by knocking on the covering of their habitation This brought them forth in large numbers when they ran about in different directions in search of the intruder coming very near to their favourite food but not one falling in contact with it The bird was now brought within two then one foot of their nest both times with the same success At last one or two as if by accident found it out and laid hold of the feathers in a great rage then retired within their habitation The ob server waited a long time to see if any intelligence would be conveyed of the proximity of their favourite prey but no evidence of the fact appeared They were then roused again and some of the largest of the second class were put upon the bird They jumped about in great perturbation and rage pulled vigorously at the feathers then biting into the flesh at last dis appeared without further effort No intelligence being as yet conveyed that food was at hand they were brought forth in still greater numbers and the fowl being thrust down amongst them was held there till it was well covered and then withdrawn to a distance of about two feet to observe their proceedings As the fowl was drawn back many ants were left on the intervening ground and thus free communication was soon established between it and their domicile A few of the largest class which are always the first to come forth for defence were seen running to and fro forming a line which when completed was seen to be composed mostly of individuals of classes numbers two and three number one evidently taking management of the others The first step in their operations was to clear the path of all moveable obstructions This was done chiefly by the third class some of number two and occasionally number one coming in when large obstacles were to be removed It was intensely interesting to see these little creatures gaining victory by one process after another over comparatively mountainous obstacles in their way greater difficulties only rousing them to greater effort Here would be seen one dragging along a stick four times its length there another pushing then grasp ing and pulling along a stone many times its weight and when more power was requisite others coming in to his aid all knowing that a work was to be performed and each doing promptly his part Thus were stones sticks leaves and grass successively withdrawn from within their line and deposited at a distance from the scene of their labours A regular distinct footpath was soon made visible and in readiness for the quick transportation of their prey In the meantime the largest with an equal number of the second size were busily engaged upon the head of the fowl depriving it of its feathers This promised to be a slow and tedious operation but the gradual increase of feathers and the denuded skin were sure indications of their success The feathers were pulled out sometimes one two and three ants would be seen tugging most lustily at one but the largest feathers appeared to be extracted by lacerating the flesh at their root though this point could not be fully decided Those that fell in the way were borne off by the smaller ants others were made to answer as a covering to their pathway being held together by the largest size or soldiers The operation of pick ing began at the beak and was gradually ex tended backward The neck being half stripped they then began the work of laceration at the eyes and ears It was some time before any visible impression was made but at last though by no means so expeditiously as might have been expected deep cavities appeared and muscles membranes and tendons were reduced and borne off to their habitation The juices and a portion of the muscular fibre appear to be consumed on the spot at such times though the largest portion is carried to their domicile At first there was considerable confusion in the lines They seemed to be incapable of keep ing the right path and even missed the various entrances to their domicile Individuals of the largest class were seen to arrange themselves on either side between wTom the lines of works passed and repassed with a good degree of order These were acting evidently the part of guides rather than guards though at times they acted in the latter capacity also They would place their abdomen horizontally on the ground and laying hold of fixed points with their hind feet which together thus acted as a fulcrum elevate the anterior portion of their bodies to the highest point open wide their jaws and stretch forth their antennas which for the most part were fixed as if in the act of listening and watching for approaching danger They would occasionally drop their bodies to the ground again run off to one side and fiercely work their jaws and antennae as if having detected some strange sounds in the distance Discerning nothing they would quickly return to their posts and resume their positions thus acting as scouts Ultimately the fowl was stolen by some of Dr Savages covetous perhaps hungry parishioners who excused the act of aggression by saying that the Drivers were their most grievous enemies often depriving them of the two things they most loved poultry and sleep and that he was entertaining them with undue hospitality others more jokingly said that he was making them his Fetish and offering to them sacrifices of birds and fowls We may feel truly thankful that such robbers and devourers are unknown in our own favoured land What a life of cruelty and rapine is that of the murderous hut cowardly Mantis Espying an unhappy fly this murderer which sits with its body half raised forming its two fore feet as if it were praying whence its name the pray ing insect fixes its bright green eye upon it following its minutest movements Slowly approaching it stretches itself as near as possible to the fly and suddenly its long feet are thrown upon the victim swift as lightning The poor insect held in the deadly embrace of the mantis is now mangled and devoured limb by limb The mantis will even attack lizards An ob server in North Carolina states in a letter to Dr Erichson that several active newts were placed before one of these insects One newt after the other was seized and to a greater or less extent devoured In vain did they endeavour by rapid contortions of the body and blows with the tail to elude the grasp of the mantis which with the head depressed and the hinder part of the body tilted upwards kept a firm hold of its victim and ate until it could eat no more Whenever a mantis seizes another insect or small animal the anterior extremities are brought down to below the level of the head so as to avoid having to sustain the weight of the prey The hornet amongst ourselves though less cunning is not less ferocious than the mantis as may be conceived from the account given us by Mr KnappThis year 1826 the hornet Vespa crahro abounded with us in un usual numbers and afforded constant evidence of its power and voracity that could not have been exceeded by any ravenous beast In our gardens the imperious murmur of four or five of them at a time might be frequently heard about our fruittrees They would occasionally extract the sweet liquor from the gage or other rich plums but the prime object of their visit was to seize the wasps that frequented the same places This they not only did when the creature was feeding on the fruit but would hawk after them when on the wing capture them with a facility to which their heavy flight seemed unequal bear them to some neighbouring plant and there feed on the insect which seemed perfectly overpowered by the might of the hornet The first operation was to snip off the head then to cut away the lower part of the waist and when near we could hear them shearing away the outer coat from the body and crushing it with their strong mandibles sometimes devouring it but generally only suck ing the juices it contained Their avidity for this sort of food is very manifest when the grape ripens on the well being commonly the only remaining fruit the wasp abounds there the hornets flock to the prey and we may see them in constant progres bearing their victims from the bunches The quiet regions of the brook and pool dis play scenes of insect rapine and violence not less than the smiling and apparently peaceful fields and gardens or the still forest and woodland Of these we shall only select one and that the account given us by the same author of the proceedings of the ferocious water beetle Another of the ravenous creatures that infest our pools is the great waterb eetle Ditiscus rnargi nalis and perhaps it is the most ferocious of any of them being adapted by every provision for a life of rapine endued with great muscular power armed with a thick and horny case over its body and having its eyes large to observe all the creatures about it and powerful mandibles to seize and reduce them to fragments It riots the Polyphemus of the pool and having thinned its herd in one place is supplied with wings to effect a removal to a fold better furnished It even eats the young of the frog and its bite is so powerful as to he painfully felt by the hand that holds it a captive though defended by a glove In the larva state it is almost equally destructive it swims admirably its hinder legs are long and brawny besides being aided by a fringe of hairs so that they are powerful oars to propel its body with celerity and ease Nor must we omit a peculiarity attending the constitution of this beetle which marks it as a creature especially endowed for the station in which it is placed Multitudes of insects exist in the larva state for a certain space of time in water and having accomplished a given period in this state perfect ing their forms they take wing and become aerial creatures after which a return to the element whence they sprang would be death to them But this beetle when it has passed from the larva state and obtained its wings still lives in that water which nourished it to this stage of perfection without any inconvenience as long as it suits its inclination when weary of this place or its food becoming scarce it wings its way to another pool into which it immediately plunges and recommences its life of rapine How varied are the means and stratagems by which the carnivorous insects are supplied with food What a picture of nature at war is presented to us in this chapter where we have seen one occupant of our fair creation derive its food and maintain its existence by waging a perpetual warfare upon others Well may earth be called the deathful earth Although all these scenes of rapine and bloodshed are well ordered and form a part of the great plan of creation as it now is the mind seeking after peace longs for the time when the reign of peace promised in the Word of God shall be established over our groaning and bleeding world and when Jesus the Prince of Peace shall reign King of kings with them that love and believe in Him over a renewed and liberated creation CHAPTER XI INSECT MISCELLANIES Much yet remains to be said about insects The more we study the lives of these interesting beings the more we become filled with wonder at their proceedings and the more time and space seem to he required to set forth their history in all its striking details Time and space would fail ere all that could be recounted of them their characters and their doings de serving our notice could be told Let us therefore occupy the space that is yet left to us with a miscellaneous collection of interesting particulars about insects previously to our taking the reader to the closing scene In so doing let us say a few words upon insect affection Our intelligent little friends the ants and bees supply us with the most striking evidences that these humble beings appear fully sensible to a degree of that tender feeling which in ourselves we call affection and may therefore apply it to them In the Annals of Natural History a correspondent relates the following anecdote of some ants In a colony of black ants the queen from some cause or other died and her royal body lay stiff and cold in one of the passages of the formicary but not deserted in her death Some insects constantly attended her remains occasionally tenderly touching the inanimate body of their monarch with their antennae and with their heads slightly thrusting her as if to bid her awake But there was no answering movement in her lifeless limbs and to their sur prise the body still remained stiffened and immovable A little water was dropped upon these faithful watchers Generally a drop of this fluid causes ants to disperse and run away but in this instance although it threw them into some confusion they refused to forsake their queen and remained still on guard The affection of bees towards their queen is strikingly depicted in a circumstance which fell under the observation of Dr Evans to which allusion will be made in the next chapter These insects also regard one another with a sort of affection and are on many ocsasions helpful to each other when a time of accident or peril arrives Nor less so are the ants In both of these social insects the feeling of affection for the young is particularly mani fested Where shall we find such nurses as the ants who as we have before said wash their little charges though not their own off spring keep them as wdiite and clean as possible carry them out into the sunshine bury them in the warmest covers from the frost feed them in their helpless hours and think no trouble too great no task too arduous to un dertake for their welfare The wasps in the period of their infancy are the subjects of equally affectionate cares on the part of a tender mother When they are hatched it is most amusing to see the bustling parent running from cell to cell popping her head now into this now into that little bedroom to see that all her numerous children are safe thriving and supplied with food which she unweariedly carries to them Even if the nest is broken to pieces the mothers of the colony will not abandon their helpless young ones lying dead and dying on the cold ground Huber tells us of some humblebees whose affection to their young and consideration for each other might serve as a pattern to higher beings than them selves They had been placed under a bell glass with a piece of comb containing young of such a shape as to stand very totteringly Their affection for their imprisoned young led them to mount the comb for the sake of impart ing warmth to the inclosed little ones but in so doing it tottered so violently as to render the scheme almost impracticable Perceiving this two or three mounted on it stretched themselves over the edge and with their heads downwards fixed their fore feet upon the table so propping it firmly up In this constrained and painful posture fresh bees relieving their comrades when weary did these affectionate little insects support the comb for nearly three days At the end of this period they had prepared a sufficiency of wax with which they built pillars that kept it in a firm position But if insects are capable of a sort of affec tion so are they also of the passion of anger Virgil has spoken much of the irascibility of bees When a bee is angry her tone of buzzing alters and becomes shrill and piercing and then let the offender beware of the weapon with which our insect is armed Humblebees when disturbed and put out of their way show their irascibility in a very odd manner The insect when threatened assumes almost the attitude of a pugilist It lifts up two or three of its legs turns upon its back and thrusts out its glittering weapon accompanied with a drop of venom Sometimes the poison is actually spurted forth in its anger The hivebee is accurately described by Shakspeare to threat before she stings the threat being the scolding querulous and halfangry tone with which she salutes the offender Mr Knight says of the bee that she is angry only when near home her feelings of patriotism being then perhaps most alive Another circumstance well deserving notice about insects generally is the scrupulous cleanli ness of their habits Frequently insects which drink the honey all the day from every opening flower get themselves covered all over with the yellow pollen dust which sticks to their little hairy bodies and gives them the most ludicrous appearance Oftentimes the flies which frequent the golden sunflower in feasting upon the honey locked in its yellow recesses get themselves covered all over with this yellow powder and are as dusty as millers It is now most amusing to see their operations The hind legs are employed to clean the wings and abdomen and the forelegs the head and thorax The pollen is brushed off the head eyes and face and then rolled up into pellets by the forelegs and thrown away with a kind of jerk The common bluebottle fly may be seen going through the same proceeding while resting on some sunshiny wall How carefully he brushes himself from head to foot sweeping over his body in all directions until not a particle of dust is left behind The common housefly may also be frequently observed pluming itself with similar carefulness This insect has an important task to fulfil in cleaning the minute brushlike ex tremities of its feet It is supposed by Mr Blackwall that the tiny hairs which form these brushes or pulvilliy secrete a sort of glutinous fluid which enables the insect to walk upon the ceiling or up a windowpane The action of rubbing its feet together much as we do our hands in washing is supposed by Mr Spence to be intended to keep these little brushes clean and free from any particles which might prevent their sticking to the wall Mr Spence says in an article read before the Entomological Society I have repeatedly seen flies after rubbing together their two fore tarsi and pulvilli put down on the surface on which they were standing first one of the pulvilli and then the other and pull at each as if trying if they would adhere properly Bees are particular to a degree as to the cleanliness of their habitation on no account suffering excrementitious matter to remain on the floor of the hive It is interesting after all we have seen of the activity of the insect world to inquire as to its periods of repose During winter when the earth is a barren desert to the insect world generally insects spend the long months of that season in one or other of their conditions in a state of torpor called hybernation Spring awakens these slumberers and their long motion less forms are seen disporting in the genial air of April and May But insects sleep at shorter intervals also and this is called their diurnal sleep Their sleep however is not always at night Many insects appear only during the hours of darkness When the air is still the evening warm and the moonshine flies from tree to tree gleams on the river and bathes the meadow with its chastened light then is the sporting time for numbers of beautiful insects belonging to the tribe of moths The flowers in garden field and woodland are surrounded by pale noiseless flutterers and while all nature beside seems asleep these beautiful creatures come out like fairies to dance in the light of the moon This tendency to come out only in the evening imitated alas by many who turn night into day and waste the hours indicated by nature for repose in the flutter of the assembly room is taken advantage of by the wary collector to entrap the evening sporters Others again busy all day long take their rest at night Of these are the hardworking bees which as regularly as evening shades close on them muster in silence for the purpose of repose Huber seems to think that even in the middle of the day bees now and then wearied by over exertion take a short nap In so doing they insert half their bodies into an empty cell and remain there without motion for half an hour or longer The inspired writer has said Every kind of beasts and of birds and of serpents and of things in the sea is tamed and hath been tamed of mankind Although insects are not ex pressed in this statement they are not excepted and it is a curious fact in their history that these minute creatures have really been tamed by man The anecdote of the stag beetle related in a former page is a case in point but there exist yet more remarkable illustrations Mr Lukis in an article in Loudons Magazine of Natural History gives a singular account of some familiarities which he effected with some butterflies in his garden The butter flies were busily engaged in feeding on a green gage and appeared unusually tame On the approach of the finger they did not fly away but gently flapped it with their wings They even submitted to being stroked with a feather These familiar feats were repeated many times One of the insects would walk over the face insert its proboscis between the lips fly away and return again to the face or clothes Several insects of different species became also tame by a little management Mr Couch has related the same observations with regard to a species of butterfly which was so tame as to feed on fruit held in the hand and to allow themselves to be taken up between the Angers The most remarkable and even ludicrous in stance of the kind is the taming of fleas These little insects subdued by the patience of their keeper in an extraordinary degree long formed one of the public exhibitions in the metropolis In the room where they were shown was a table covered with green cloth on which several tiny tables were arranged six or seven inches square and covered with white paper Upon these the fleas went through their feats The little insects were exhibited all harnessed with silk harness dragging along a coach the coachman was a flea and brandished a whip and the guard also was a flea who every now and then put a mimic silver trumpet to his mouth Others were shown 348 THE LIFE OF AN INSECT with paper figures of several martial heroes on their backs Other fleas were taught to ride a tournament at each other Another danced with a blue petticoat and drew up a golden bucket full of water from a tiny well Others danced to music some imitated the musicians Altogether the insects performed a variety of tricks which served to indicate their subjection to the ingenuity and perseverance of their proprietor The manner in which these little beings were educated we are unable to describe A celebrated French prisoner M Pelisson having been confined in the Bastile beguiled the hours of his imprisonment by endeavouring to tame the humble creatures which were his only companions in solitude Being fond of music he used to solace himself frequently with per forming airs of various kinds at which the spiders of his apartments testified their pleasure and interest by always coming forth and retiring again when the tones of his instrument were silenced A manufacturer in Paris is said to have tamed eight hundred spiders which he kept in an apartment devoted to their use Here he was accustomed to visit them taking in his hand a dish of flies As soon as the spiders saw him appear they all used to descend to partake of the repast he had furnished for them These instances are sufficient to show that the dominion of man extends even over the world of insects and that by patience and ingenuity he is occasionally able to subdue them to his will Perhaps the most remarkable instances of the adaptation by man of the industrial habits of the lower creatures to accomplish his own purposes is the one we are about to relate In 1827 M Habenstreet of Munich communicated through M Le Normand to tlie National In stitute of France the result of some singular experiments of his upon caterpillars These caterpillars were the larvae of a butterfly In a natural state they construct a silken city similar to that described at an earlier part of this work The texture of this material is extremely fine and thin yet sufficiently close to be almost impervious to air M Habenstreet taking ad vantage of the spinning instinct of these larvae made them work upon a paper model to which he gave the form and dimensions which suited him In order to give the tissue a regular form it was often necessary to fix limits beyond which the little weavers were not to go This was ingeniously effected by touching certain parts of the model with oil the larvae refusing to work on all surfaces so treated By various little contrivances M Habenstreet succeeded in making these insects weave for him various articles which almost presented the regularity of the same articles made by human hands It was found by him that one or two insects could produce about one square inch of cloth By causing the insects to go more than once over the same surface this ingenious gentleman succeeded in making the cloth either finer or more dense The fabric itself bore no resemblance to silken stuff the filaments of which are inter laced being much more compact and homogeneous It was as fine as the lightest gauze M Habenstreet succeeded in making his in sect operatives weave square shawls a yard and a quarter in size Some were two yards and a half long by one and a quarter broad He also procured an airtight balloon made by them which was four feet high and two in horizontal diameter A professor of Chemistry in the university of Stockholm actually beheld the insects at work and saw this balloon It only weighed five grains nevertheless it was described as being airtight The mere heat of the hand was sufficient to inflate it in an instant and the flame of a single match held for some seconds beneath it caused it to rise to a considerable height in the air where it remained for half an hour A shawl of a yard and a quarter square was blown into the air by a slight puff and it then resembled a light vapour gently agitated by the wind M Habenstreet offered jocosely to present this shawl to this gentleman on condition that the latter would cause it to fall from the air on his head But to his mortification he found this altogether impossible for as the shawl approached his body the heat of the body produced sufficient agitation in the air to keep the tantalizing fabric suspended above his head It appears that M Habenstreet must have got his insects to work for very low wages for this exquisite shawl could be purchased for about 7s 6d The crowning work however of these ingenious insects was the fabrication of a complete dress without the sleeves in which there was no seam This exquisite work of insect art was presented to the Queen of Bavaria who to show her gratitude to her zoological sempstresses and to exhibit so rare a curiosity to the admiration of her suite used to wear this beautiful robe over her dress on court days At the sitting of the French academy of science in August 1840 M Lavasseur forwarded a piece of a very fine tissue a kind of cloth made by caterpillars which was found in Moravia In the Naturalist for 1838 occurs the following passage also relative to our subject A most extraordinary species of manufacture has been contrived by an officer of engineers residing at Munich It consists of lace veils with open patterns in them made entirely by caterpillars The following is the mode of proceeding adoptedHaving made a paste of the leaves of the plant on which the species of caterpillar he employs feeds he spreads it thinly over a stone or other flat substance of the required size He then with a camelhair pencil dipped in olive oil draws the pattern he wishes the insects to leave open This stone is placed in an inclined position and a consider able number of caterpillars are placed at the bottom A peculiar species is chosen which spins a strong web The animals commence at the bottom eating and spinning their way up to the top carefully avoiding every part touched by the oil but devouring every other part of the paste The extreme lightness of these veils combined with some strength is truly surprising One of them measuring 26J by 17 inches weighed only one grain and a half a degree of lightness which will appear more extraordinary when contrasted with other fabrics One square yard of the substance of which one of these veils is made weighs 4 grains whilst one square yard of silk gauze weighs 137 grains and one square yard of the finest net weighs grains That such a manufacture can be carried on profitably is more than questionable but if any of our readers are disposed to try it they would succeed with a little tact if they employed the tapestry making caterpillars to whose operations we have before alluded The evolution of light is a remarkable attribute of some insects and none who love to stroll by the country wayside when the sun has gone down on some hue and genial summer evening can fail to have noticed the sparklings of the glow worm in the short grass on the bank side We are told by Waller that The man who first upon the ground A glowworm spied supposing he had found A moving diamond a breathing stone For life it had and like these jewels shone He held it dear till by the springing day Informed he threw the worthless worm away which was scarcely fair to those pretty but humble creatures The lamp of the glowworm is seated not where the poet placed it who wrote of lighting tapers at the fiery glow worms eye but at the extremity of the underside of the abdomen of the female It appears to consist of phosphorescent matter secreted by some peculiar structure placed at the seat of the light It is generally stated that although the male insect is slightly luminous as well as the female and the luminosity exists in the larva and pupa as well as in the imago state the object of this light is in reality to attract the insects together To captivate her favourite fly And tempt the rover through the dark It is remarkable that the insect has the property of extinguishing the light at pleasure Burmeister says This they appear to do in moments of danger at least I have often ob served that those which I have caught with my hat during flight immediately ceased shining and so frequently deceived me by my fancying that I had missed the creature but I afterwards discovered it in my hat when it again shone In the presence however of some foreign luminous insect the glowworm must pale his ineffectual fire Mr Edwards in his voyage up the Amazon river says that as night draws on Huge moths those fairest of the insect wwld have taken the place of butterflies and myriads of fireflies never weary in their torch like dance Ear dowm the road comes on a blaze steady streaming like a meteor It whizzes past and for an instant the space is illumined and dewy jewels from the leaves throw back the radiance It is the lantern fly seeking what he himself knows best by the fiery guide upon his head In the West Indies the evenings are rendered splendid in the extreme by the appearance of innumerable fireflies As twilight dies away all nature is illumined with these stars of the earth and diamonds of the night At one step says the Rev Lansdown Guilding you see some gigantic tree peopled by these magic rovers glowing with all the green the gold and emerald lustre of precious stones At another step some long lane in the darkness of the night seems to have been consumed hy fire and to he throwing up its last expiring sparks The insects as they present their backs conceal their floating lan tern for a moment and render the resemblance perfect Presently with a steady and bold sweeping course the luminous Elater crosses your path A meteor swift and bright And the wide space around on high Gleams with his emerald light It forms a strong contrast to the tantalizing phosphoric fires of the lesser stars and resembles a wax taper borne rapidly through the bloom by some invisible hand while the ear is assailed by countless tribes of sonorous insects and frogs raising their nightly cries How glorious is such a scene From the innumerable host of insects which light up the earth and from their proximity to the eye of the spectator they have all the brilliance of real stars Above our heads is the broad firmament of stationary lights below is a second firmament of luminous points moving with all the eccentric courses of comets and meteoric balls and with all the glory that tracks the shooting stars The sportings of these beautifully adorned insects in the still and dark evenings in Jamaica are highly picturesque Frequently one insect will be seen streaming down a valley a moving point of greenish brilliance After him follows another and another until a line of waning light lights up the dark ravine and is presently lost in the distance Again another torchbearer leads the van and is followed by another column of sparklers flowing down like a floating line of jewels and again lost in the distant darkness In Hayti we are told by Oviedo that a luminous insect exists called Cocuyo which emits sufficient light to see to write or read by and if one puts together four or five of these cocuyos tying them together they serve well as a tolerable lantern in the fields When war was carrying on in Hayti the Christians and the Indians made one of these lights in order not to lose one another The Indians strung them into neck laces and were afar off conspicuous by their glittering collars Thus he quaintly remarks both in the fields and houses people by means of the light of the cocuyos do whatsoever they need to do without the breeze or wind or rain being able to put out their light It was customary to keep these insects in confine ment for domestic purposes and feasts were made at which the only lights employed were those of these creatures The Indians used to make a sort of paste of the bodies of these insects and smear it over their faces to the terror of their companions In Koempfers History of Japan we are told that luminous insects sometimes settle on trees like a fiery cloud with this surprising circumstance that a whole swarm of these insects having taken possession of the tree and spread themselves over its branches sometimes hide their light all at once and a moment after make it appear again with the utmost regularity and exactness How splendid a spectacle a tree thus adorned in the darkness of a tropical night The finest of all the fireflies is one of incom parable beauty and is kept by ladies among their curiosities This insect is described as about the length of a finger with four wings two of which are transparent and hid under a pair of others which are shining as it were polished and most curiously adorned with blue and golden lines and spots The Javanese say that all other nightflies fall in love with it and that to get rid of them it maliciously or for a trial of their constancy bids them to go and fetch fire The blind lovers scruple not to obey her commands and flying to the next fire or candle are inevitably burnt to death In the present day the poor inhabitants of Cuba ingeniously avoid the expense of wax or oil by perforating a calabash with holes and inclosing within it several of these insects When they want to trim their insect lamps they give it a gentle shake when the brilliant beams of the insect light are re doubled in power They also tie them to their toes Ladies have worn these beautiful insects in their hair and upon their dress In India they are often enclosed in little gauze nets and form a brilliant part of the headdress in evening time In Italy they are also thus worn In China an Imperial edict was from some cause or other issued to prevent young ladies adorning them selves with these brilliant beings Light insects have sometimes played a not un important part in the history of nations We are told by Mouffet that when Sir Thomas Caven dish and Sir Robert Dudley first landed in the West Indies and saw in the evening an infinite number of moving lights in the woods which were merely insects they supposed that the Spaniards were advancing upon them and made a precipitate retreat to their vessels It is also related that when the troops of Cortez contended with those sent by Velasquez to compel the former to return they attacked them by night and the soldiers of the latter were smitten with dismay at the apparently immense force brought by Cortez against them The fact being that a multitude of luminous insects were descried by them and mistaken for the lighted matches of troops of musqueteers The nocturnal splendour of luminous insects in tropical countries has nowhere been so beautifully described as in the following glowing lines of Southeys who elsewhere describes the lamp by which Madoc beholds the features of his lovely guide as a Cage or net It rather might be called so fine the twigs Which knit it where confined two fireflies gave Their lustre The night scene is as follows Soon did night display More wonders than it veiled innumerous tribes From the wood cover swarmed and darkness made Their beauties visible One while they streamed A bright blue radiance upon flowers that closed Their gorgeous colours from the eye of day Now motionless and dark eluded search Self shrouded and anon staining the sky Shone like a shower of fire In this account of the luminous properties of insects all reference to species has been avoided principally because there is much dis pute among entomologists upon the subject The majority of the foreign light bearers belong to the family of the Elateridoe our own glow worm belongs to the family of Lampyridce The evolution of electricity is a still more singular property possessed hy some rare insects At a meeting of the Entomological Society in May 1822 Mr Yarrell exhibited a large and hairy caterpillar possessed of this remarkable faculty This insect was seen crawling on the ground by Capt Blakeney RN in South America and upon picking it up he experienced a sensation similar to a violent electric shock Such in fact was the force of this discharge that it completely paralyzed his arm for some time and his life was for a period endangered by the accident No mention was made of the possession of any elec trical organ in this insect by which so powerful a charge of the electric principle could be de veloped With these digressive notices of various facts about insects generally we must close our chap ter on Insect Miscellanies wdiich we may be allowed to add has borrowed nothing but the name from the pleasant volume written by Mr Rennie under a similar title We have now to introduce the reader to the last part of the Life of an Insectits diseases and death CHAPTER XII INSECT DISEASES AND DEATH Upon the fool upon the wise Sickness and health enter common May none eschew that fortune Gower Insects are no exceptions to this truth Disease and death are common to all the inhahitants of a sinsick world Man and the brute creation lie alike under the curse for disease and death came hj sin and no human power can stay their progress or remove the penalty The soul purified by the Redeemers blood and sanctified by his Spirit is indeed freed from the bondage and consequences of sin hut the body must still bear the consequences of our first parents fall and of that sin which entering into the world caused all our woes In the restitution of all things to a happier state so abundantly promised in the word of God when Christ the sun of righteousness and the Mighty Regenerator of a fallen world shall arise with healing in his wings the inhabitants of the land shall no longer say I am sick Disease dark brooder over this fair creation shall flap its heavy wings and flee away There shall he no more sickness nor any more death Be it ours to seek a participation in those promised blessings and to seek it in that way along which the gospel sheds its pure and sacred light Few spectacles are more painful than to behold the brute creation unendowed with the faculty of speech as they to our comprehensions are with ering under the strong hand of agonizing sick ness And in consequence of their inability to communicate with us beyond by dumb show and of ours to do so wuth them or to ascer tain the nature of their disease in many cases excepting by its analogies with disease in our own frames we probably know hut a few of the maladies under which they suffer Many a pang of agony must he endured of which we are unconscious the more unmistakable evidences of corporal suffering being alone made manifest to our perceptions It is true the sensibility of many creatures is low and they can bear much more than ourselves in consequence of the lower development of their nervous systems without experiencing severe pain This is particularly the case with insects whose nervous organization is not to be com pared with that of man and consequently whose endurance of suffering and perceptions of pain are much duller and more obtuse than our own The poet was therefore clearly wrong when he wrote that The poor beetle that we tread upon In corporal sufferance finds a pang as great As when a giant dies if by these words he intended to convey the idea that the sensations of the one and of the other creature are equally acute This how ever does not actually appear to have been his meaning his intention having been rather to show that the pang of death is most in appre hension the actual suffering being trivial Yet we must avoid the opposite extreme into which some entomologists have fallen of con sidering that insects cannot feel at all Their sensa tions are far less acute doubtless than ours but can we believe that God has created this beautiful division of the animal kingdom so highly endowed with intelligence and skill and has left them without the power of perceiving pleasure or pain It is altogether irrational The bluntness of the perceptive powders in insects may be judged of when we are told that insects even after having been impaled with a pin will devour their prey as greedily as if at liberty and seem to suffer little inconvenience from the loss of half their bodies But this by no means proves their total want of feeling Let us how ever inform the reader of some of the insect maladies A very singular disease to which ants are subject is giddiness of the head or in scientific language vertigo This was noticed by Huber Ants have also their maladies he writes I have noticed one extremely singular the indivi duals attacked by it lose their power of guiding themselves in a straight line They can walk only by turning round in a circle of small dia meter and always in the same direction A female shut up in one of my glasses was seized on a sudden witli this distemper She de scribed a circle of an inch in diameter and made about a thousand turns an hour or not quite seventeen in a minute She continued constantly turning round for seven days and wlien I visited her in the night she was still in motion I gave her honey and I think she ate some of it I also found three workers which turned round in this manner one of them had how ever the faculty of walking occasionally in a straight line I took this ant into my hand it still continued to turn round would now and then stop to taste a little honey and then resume its circular movements In some of the experiments made by physiologists on the brain a remarkable consequence of cutting certain por tions away was their tendency to sin round Towards the end of May and June bees are often attacked with the same complaint The sick insects fly it is said in a dizzy manner and start and fall down while pursuing their usual avocations To these symptoms succeed lassitude and death No physician of the bees has hitherto found a remedy for this sad complaint Bees are however subject to a worse complaint a sort of dysentery which causes them to forget their usual habits of neatness Dr Bevan tells us that sometimes their antennm become tumefied and diseased and the bees becoming languid and feeble die if they have not timely assistance Occasionally pestilence invades the beehive The young larvm die and their putrefying bodies fill the bees atmosjhere with poisonous exhalations The bees suffer severely from this state of things and the hive becomes rapidly thinned or perishes altogether if the combs infected with the disease are not cut out and the beedwelling fumigated and cleansed The pharmacopoeia for the bees is very short and simple and the practice of medicine among them in the hands of beekeepers is rude and imperfect Sanitary measures are of the first consequence and often are the only means neces sary to employ in the removal of disease Cleanliness and plenty of suitable food are strongly insisted on But the beephysician finds it useful now and then to give cordials to his little insect patients and he accordingly treats them to sugared ale and now and then a little drop of wine In the larva state insects are subject to several internal maladies The cultivators of the silk worm distinguish seven or eight different diseases to which this useful insect is subject during its passage from the larva into the pupa condition The causes of these diseases are various Sometimes the eggs appear to he in fault sometimes the treatment of the insects with regard to food ventilation c and sometimes the food itself exerts an injurious influence upon them Insects are not unfrequently the subjects of disease induced by the presence of parasites either in the interior or on the exterior of their bodies A poor languid caterpillar crawl ing feebly up a paling was taken into the writers study and placed in a glass jar After living for a few days it fixed itself against the side of the glass and appeared as if it were about to undergo its metamorphosis from the larva into the pupa On examination in a short time afterwards a remarkable spectacle appeared The body of the unhappy insect was burst open and surrounding it were ten or twelve bright yellow cocoons evidently the residences of a similar number of parasites who had long infested and at length destroyed the poor insect The observation of this fact caused great perplexity to the older naturalists who could not imagine how a caterpillar which ought to have turned ultimately into a butterfly should become as it were the parent of a number of Ichneumons These busy destroyers alight upon the unsuspecting insect plunge their ovipositor into its tender body there deposit their eggs which are in due time hatched and destroy the insect in which they reside and then spin their golden cocoons which ultimately give birth to winged insects dispersing themselves on a similar errand of death to every caterpilJar they meet with of a particular species The clothesmoth caterpillar fretting our garments has a similar destroyer The benefits thus conferred by these insects in the destruction of the destroyers of our food and raiment are altogether incalculable Parasites frequently attach themselves to the exterior surface of insects to their destruction or to their excessive annoyance It is said that the humblebee when attacked with parasites will go to an anthill disturb the busy citizens and provoke them to fall upon it when they seize the parasites and carry them off thus ridding the insect of its annoyers A more remarkable class of parasites are those which are of vegetable origin The common dungfly may occasionally be noticed resting upon the stalk of a plant in the attitude of life but on close examination it is found to be stiff and quite dead and its body here and there covered with a white dust resembling mould So precisely is their attitude that of the living insect which appears as if resting that it frequently escapes observation Sometimes this fly is found fast glued by its proboscis to leaves of plants every other part of the insect being free This has been explained by the fact that flies in an apparently dying state have been seen on the leaves of plants emitting and again absorbing a drop of fluid at the end of the proboscis Pos sibly the drying up of this fluid might glue the insect to the leaf But more generally flies are seen affixed to the surfaces on which they are found by the whitish mould with which they are infested When this disease proceeds to its highest point scarcely a trace of the insect is distinguishable and there remains only a whitish mass of downy material Frequently we may observe tlie same fact without quitting the sitting room Upon a neglected window pane a dead fly often may be seen on the glass around which a whitish cloud like a very fine cobweb exists It was long considered that this disease for such in reality it is was a mere jlethora or overfulness of the flys body The insects were thought to have eaten until their bodies were rent asunder But it is now clearly ascertained that the disease is of a vegetable character that it is in fact a species of fungus which vegetates on the flys body and increasing with great rapidity destroys the power of life in the insect This subject is highly interesting and has been extensively investigated by various writers upon the Fungi It surely must be considered as a most extraordinary circumstance that vege table life which is generally subject to animal vitality should in this case get the mastery and that the animal should become food for it instead of the plant for the animal It appears that the minute fungus which has been called Sporendo mena musct attacks the insect while yet alive rapidly extends its subtle threads each of which drains away the life juices of the insect until finally the animal powers give up the unequal resistance and the insect dies overcome hy the exhaustion of an inanimate invader These funsri have been found in the aircells of the lungs and appear to enter far more largely into the structures of animals under certain circumstances than could have been anticipated In all probability where the insect is fatally attacked with fungi or moulds for the latter are only a different kind of these vegetable organizations it must have been somewhat out of health before the powers of life being thus reduced and rendered less capable of resisting the invasion of disease Travellers inform us that in the West Indies insects resembling wasps are not unfrequently captured the bodies of which are infested with a fungous plant The insects are stated to be capable of flying about although burthened with this parasite and are often called the Vegetable wasps vegetating would however be a more correct term Certainly the poor insects present us with an extraordinary spectacle a combina tion of a living animal and a living vegetable in one body The plant however is victorious The insects become exhausted by its growth Their bodies up to their eyes and down to the extremities of their feet become literally filled with the fungus and the insect dies so entirely metamorphosed into a vegetable as to all its internal organs that in a less enlightened age naturalists might well have been excused had they considered that the insect had been by some miracle of nature converted into a plant The breeders of silkworms have a similar complaint to make against the vegetable world Their unhappy insect charges are sometimes carried off to an alarming extent by a malady which commences with the appearance of black jioints scattered over different parts of the body or livid and blackish spots in the vicinity of the breathing apertures or spiracles These become of a reddish or yellow tint and the insect dies The name of this disease is La Muscadine After death the body of the larva becomes so stiff and rigid as to be readily snapped asunder Then they throw out from their surface a sort of white efflorescence which is in fact the growth of the minute fungus or Botrytis which has destroyed them Any healthy insects may be inoculated with the same disease by taking a few of the minute spores of the fungus from the dead insect and inserting the needle laden with them a little under the skin It soon sickens languishes and dies In a New Zealand caterpillar infested with fungous disease the plant sometimes protrudes from the extremity of the insect in a long de licate process longer in fact than the insect itself Mr Westwood examined the interior of an insect thus diseased and states that it was filled with a hard dry whitish matter like the kernel of a nut Dr Buckland considered that the substance found in the interior of this cater pillar was vegetable as it burnt with somewhat of the odour of hay without any smell of animal matter There is not a doubt in fact as to its belonging to the family of the fungi In a large larva from South America shown at a meeting of the Entomological Society from the thorax a long slender and fantastically curved vegetable production protruded nearly equalling the length of the body of the insect In addition to bodily diseases of various kinds as causes of death besides falling a prey to in numerable devourers and being destroyed by a variety of accidents insects are sometimes killed by poison We need not here advert to the dangerous draught prepared for poor flies by the sugar dealers and confectioners or tell how the saucers are filled with an infusion of quassia and how the latter becomes not only a bitter but a fatal draught to the thirsty insects Some times insects of course involuntarily poison themselves In the Gardeners Magazine an observer states that he has observed the pavement under a blooming plant of Periploca Grceca to be literally covered with dead flies of the same species as the housefly vast numbers of them at the same time swarming and settling on the dowsers of the deadly vegetable Bees are sup posed sometimes to injure themselves by sucking the honey from the recesses of some empoisoned flower Sometimes the honey they collect as in the celebrated instance narrated by Xenophon where a whole army was half poisoned is in jurious to the human constitution A strange instance of insects poisoning them selves is narrated to have taken place in the plague of ants which in the year 1519 desolated the Antilles Among numerous attempts made to destroy the innumerable millions of these insects which overwhelmed the islands we are in formed that the Franciscans of La Vega placed a lump of corrosive sublimate weighing three or four pounds on the flat roof of the monastery All the ants in the building at once ran to it and biting it fell down dead and as though mes sengers had been sent to invite all within half a league to the banquet the roads were filled with them They scaled the walls and tasting the poison fell dead like their companions until the roof was blackened with them This continued as lonof as the sublimate lasted Then the friars says Mr Doubleday having found that they gained nothing by this experi ment save the bringing fresh swarms of ants did not care to renew it Let us now bring the reader to the insect grave yard Most strange is the fact that there is a spe cies of beetle represented in the frontispiece to this Chapter which has the extraordinary propen sity of burying every dead animal when practicable M Gleditsch has given a delightful account of se veral experiments made by him on these singular insects In fifty days four of these insectsex tons had interred twelve carcases vi four frogs three small birds two fishes one mole and two grasshoppers besides the entrails of a fish and two morsels of the lungs of an ox The beetles deposit their eggs in the bodies and then with most extraordinary patience perseverance and ingenuity proceed to inter them in the earth One of the most recent and lively accounts of these insects is given by Rusticus and we shall transfer his narrative of the circumstances he witnessed from the pages of the Entomological Magazine to our own The common objects of search are dead mice rats birds frogs and moles of these a bird is most commonly obtained In the neighbour hood of towns every kind of garbage that is thrown out attracts these beetles as soon as it begins to smell and it is not unusual to see them settling in our streets enticed by the grateful odours of such substances The bury ing beetles hunt in couples male and female and when six or eight are found in a large ani mal they are almost sure to be males and females in equal numbers They appear to hunt by the nose only their movements being mostly made in the night when the faculty of sight is of but little service Now to a bullfinch which lay dead on the ground and had been visited by the male beetle the beetle soon returned with his bride Neither seemed at first to discover the exact spot at last the male espied it and great comfort he expressed wheeling in circles about eighteen inches above it in the manner of an eagle only some miles nearer the earth the female settled on it at once without this testimonial of satis faction The male at last settled also and the bird underwent the scrutiny of four at least of the sensestouch smell sight and tastefor the heads of both were continually diving among the feathers of the bird and a savoury and ample meal was made before the great work of burying was begun After the beetles had ap peased the calls of hunger the bird was aban doned for a while both of them examining with great care the earth all round to see whether it was a decent place for the funeral Being satisfied as to the decorum of the position the operation of burying was commenced by the male the female mounting the bird and for a time sitting quietly upon it then hiding herself among the feathers and allowing herself to be buried with it The male began by dig ging a furrow all round the bird at a distance of about half an inch turning the earth outside his head was the only tool used in this opera tion it was held sloping outwards and seemed prodigiously jowerful After the first furrow was completed another was made within it and the earth was thrown into the first furrow then he made a third furrow but this was under the bird so that I could only see a bit of him now and then and I could only judge for a long time of what was going on by the heaving of earth which formed a little rampart round the bird As the rampart rose the bird sank After three hours incessant labour the beetle emerged crawl ed on the bird and took a survey of his work Here he remained about an hour still as death he did not stir hand or foot he then dismounted dived again into the grave and kept on pulling the bird down by the feathers for half an hour its own weight seemed to sink it but very little The earth then began heaving and rising all round it was for all the world like a little earth quake the feathers of the bird were again pulled and asain the bird descended At last after about three hours more labour he came up mounted on the bird took a survey and then dropped down to rest as though dead or suddenly fallen fast asleep When sufficiently rested he roused himself trod the bird firmly into its grave pulled it by the feathers this way and that way and having settled it to his mind began to shovel in the earth this he did in a very short time by means of his broad head He went behind the rampart of earth and pushed it into the grave with amazing strength and dexterity his head being bent downward at first and then the nose chucked up with a kind of jerk which sent the earth forwards After the grave was thus filled up and the earth trodden in it underwent another keen scrutiny all round the bird being completely hidden he then made a hole in the still loose earth and having buried the bird and his own bride next buried himself Having eaten as much of the savoury food as they please they make their way out and fly away In a short time the eggs are hatched the larva3 feed upon the putrid remains un dergo their changes and become as busy sextons as their parents were This burying instinct is doubtless given to these creatures with a view to the removal of noxious matter from the sur face and the office of our sextons is one of no slight importance in the varied economy of crea tion Let us go hence and take our last illus tration of the Life of an Insect from the dying bed of an insect sovereign A queen in a thinly peopled hive lay on a honeycomb apparently dying Around her dying couch were six affectionate workers intently watching every movement of their expiring mis tress Now they would gaze earnestly on her and gently quivering their wings would endea vour to revive the lamp of lifenow their sharp weapons would be thrust out as if to repel all intruders and to secure to their monarch a peace ful dying moment On presenting them with honey although it was eagerly devoured by the careless mob outside these affectionate watchers refused to taste the proffered banquet so entirely were they absorbed in their last mournful duty The queen breathed her last Yet around her lifeless corpse this faithfu baud of attendants still remained A day passed by but they re linquished not their charge and another and another and still they kept watch hungry and exhausted yet refusing sustenance and abiding still by the side of what was once the pride and glory of their hivenow a lifeless insect frame Four days went by and every individual of this little company had perished at its post death had kindly extinguished both their affec tion and their grief It is not less true of insects than of man that A little rule a little sway A sunbeam in a winters day Is all the proud and mighty have Between the cradle and the grave Looking at our world merely with the eye of the naturalist we see it is in the words of Bishop Hall a goodly place filled with all grateful objects to our senses full of variety and pleasant ness and the soul fastening on them is ready with Peter in the mount to conclude That it is good to be here But as we look on Nature we hear voices on every side telling us that together with ourselves all things possessed of life must die and return to dust The monarch of old had felt no need of one to be ever calling to himthou art mortal had he looked and thought on things around him The flowers fade and die the brute creation close their al lotted periods and become earth again and insects after a life of sunshine spent in revelling on the wing through fields of air languish with disease or the victims of accident go to the com mon restingplace of all things Man with slower steps follows after the mourners go about the streets Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it THE ENDWINGS AND STINGS  i TAIB FOB IHE YOBKO  T NELSON AND SONS LONDON EDINBURGHi  WINGS AND STINGS  CHAPTER I   Hau you not better go on a little faster with  your work Polly f said Minnie Wingfield  glancing np for a minute from her own over  which her little fingers had been busily moying  and from which she now for the first time raised  her eyes   I wish that there were no such thing as  work r exclaimed Polly from her favourite seat  by the schoolroom window through which she  had been watching the bees thronging in and out  of their hive some flying away to seek honied  treasure some returning laden with it to their  homa   I think that work makes one enjoy play  more replied Minnie her soft voice scarcely  heard amidst the confusion of sounds which  filled the schoolroom for there was a spellings  class answering questions at the moment and  the hum of voices from the boys echoolroom  which adjoined that of the girls added not a  little to the noise  The house might itself be regarded as a hive  its rosycheeked scholars as a little swarm of bees  and knowledge as the honey of which they were  in search drawn not from flowers but from the  leaves of certain dogseared books which had  few charms for the eyes of Polly Bright   I never have any play T said the little girl  peevishly As soon as school is over and I  should like a little fim there is Johnny to be  looked after and the baby to be carried I hate  the care of children mother knows that I do  and I think that baby is always crying on pur  pose to tease me 1   Yet it must be pleasant to think that you  are helping your mother and doing your duty  Polly uttered a little grunting sound which  did not seem like consent and ran her needle two  or three times into her seam always drawing it  back instead of pushing it through which every  one knows is not the way to get on with work   Why even these little bees Minnie con  tinued have a sort of duty of their own and  how steadily they set about itl   Pretty easy duty playing amongst flowers  and feasting upon honey l  « Oh but   Minnie Wingfield no talking allowed in  school cried the teacher from the top of the  room turning towards the comer near the win  dow Polly Bright you are always the last  in your class  This time the lazy fingers did draw the needle  through but a cross illtempered look was on the  face of the little girl while her companion Min  nie colouring at the reproof only worked faster  than before  We will leave them seated on their bench with  their sewing in their hands and passing through  the little window as only authors and their  readers can do cross the narrow garden with its  small rows of cabbages and onions bordered by a  line of stunted gooseberry bushes and mixing  with the busy inhabitants of the hive glide  through the tiny opening around which they  cluster and enter the palace of the bees Now  I have a suspicion that though my young readers  may be well acquainted with honeycomb and  honey and have even had hives on a bench in  their own gardens they never in their lives have  been inside one and are totally ignorant of the  language of bees For your benefit therefore I  intend to translate a Httle of the buzzing chit  chat of the winged nation and begging you to  consider yourself as little as possible conduct you  at once to the palace of Queen Farina  A very curiouB and beautiful palace it is the  OryBtal Palace itself is not more perfect in its  waj Look at the long lines of cells framed  with the nicest care row above row built of  pure white wax varnished with gum and filled  with provisions for the winter 1 Yonder are the  nurseries for the in£uit bees these larger apart  ments are for the rojal race that laigest of  all is the statechamber of the queen How  straight are the passages just wide enough to let  two travellers pass without jostling And as  for the inhabitants of this singular palace or  rather I should say this populous city though  for a moment you may think them all hurrying  and bustling about in utter confusion I assure  you that they are governed by the strictest  order each knows her own business her own  proper place I am afraid that before you are  well acquainted with your small companions you  may find some difficulty in knowing one£rom  another as each bee looks as much like her neigh  bour as a pin does to a pin I am not speaking  of course of her majesty the queen distinguished  as she is from all her subjects by the dignified  length of her figure and the shortness of her  wings but you certainly would not discover  imless I told you that the little creature hanging  from the upper comb is considered a beauty in  Beeland You must at once fancy your eyes  powerful mioroBOopefl till a daisy is enlarged to  the size of a table and the thread of a spider to  a pieoe of stout whipcord for not till then can  you find out the smallest reason why Sipsyrup  should be vain of her beauty Yet why should  she not pride herself on her slender shape or her  fine down vanity may seem absurd in a bee  but surely it is yet more so in any reasonable  creature to whom sense has been given to know  the trifling worth of mere outside looks and I  fear that I may have amongst my young readers  some no wiser than little Sipsyrup  She is not buzzing eagly about like her com  panions who are now working in various parties  some raising the white walls of the cells some  carryiQg away small cuttings of wax not to be  thrown away but used in some other place for  bees are very careful and thrifty some putting  a fine brown polish on the combs made of a gum  gathered from the buds of the wild poplar  some bringing in provisions for the little work  men who are too busy to go in search of it  themselves Ko Sipsyrup seems in her hive as  little satisfied as Polly in her sohoolioom as  she hangs quivering her wings with an im  patient movement veiy unworthy of a sensible  bee   A fine morning this buzzed an industrious  young insect making beebread with all her  might I may here remark that the subject of  the weather is much studied in hives and that  their inhabitants show a knowledge of it that  might put to shame some of the learned amongst  us I am not aware that they ever make use of  barometers but it is said that they manage sel  dom to be caught in a shower and take care to  keep at home when there is thunder   A fine morning indeed replied Sipsyrup   Yes the sunshine looks tempting enough to be  sure no doubt the flowers are all full of honey  and the hills covered with thyme but of what  use is this to a poor nursebee like me scarcely  allowed to snatch a hasty sip for myself but  obliged to look after these wretched little larvsa  that is the name given to young babybees  and carry home tasteless pollen to make bread  for them when I might be enjoying myself in  the sunshine   We once were larvae ourBelves meekly ob  served Silverwing   Yes and not very long ago replied Sip  syrup rather pertly glancing at the whitish  down that showed her own youth for it was  but three days since she had quitted her own  nimsery which may account for her being so  silly a young bee   And but for the kindness of those who sup  plied our wants when we were poor helpless  little creatures we should never have lived to  have wings continued her companion   Dont remind me of that time buzzed Sip  Bjrup who could not bear to think of herself as  a tiny feeble worm Anything more weary  and tiresome than the life that I led shut up all  alone in that horrid cell spinning my own cover  let from morning till night I am sure that I  cannot imagine Ah speaking of that spinning  if you had only seen what I did yesterday T   What was thatT inquired Silverwing   As I flew past a sunny bank facing the  south I noticed a small hole at the entrance of  which I saw one of our cousins the poppybees  Her dress you must know is different from ours  Sipsyrup always thought something of dress  it is black studded on the head and back with  reddish grey hairs and her rings are edged with  grey Wishing to notice a little more closely  her curious attire I stopped and wished her  good day Yery politely she invited me into her  parlour and I entered the hole in the bank   A dull gloomy place to live in I should  fear   DuU gloomy exclaimed Sipsyrup quiver  ing her feelers at the recollection why the cell  of our queen is a dungeon compared to it The  hole grew wider as we went farther in till it  appeared quite roomy and large and all round it  was hung with the most splendid coverings  formed of the leaves of the poppy of a dazzling  scarlet delightful to behold Since I saw it I  have been scarcely able to bear the look of this  old hive with its thousands of cells one just  like another and all of the same white hue T   Had the poppybee a queen inquired Sil  verwing   No she is queen and worker and everything  herself she has no one to command her no one  to obey no waspish companion like Stickasting  there   Whats that who buzzes about meT cried  a large thick bee hurrying towards them with  an angry hum Stickasting had been the plague  of the hive ever since she had had wings she  was especially the torment of the unfortunate  drones who not having been gifted with stings  like the workers had no means of defence to  protect them from their bullying foe When a  larva her impatient disposition was not known  she had spun her silken web like any peaceable  insect then lain quiet and asleep as a pupa or  nymph But no sooner did the young bee awake  to life than using her new powers with hearty  good will she ate her way through the web at  such a quick rate that the old bees who looked  in pronounced at once that she was likely to be  a most active worker Nor were they disap  pointed as fajr as work was conoemed no one  was ready to fly 8ter or farther no one worked  harder at building the cells but it was soon  discovered that her activity and quickness were  not the only qualities for which she was remark  able If ever bee had a bad temper that bee  was Stickasting quarrelling bulljdng attacking  fightings she was as bad as a wasp in the hive  No one would ever have trusted larvsd to her  care Sipsyrup might neglect or complain of her  charge but Stickasting would have been posi  tively cruel Her companionship was shunned  as must be expected by all of her character  whether they be boys or bees and she seldom  exchanged a hum except of defiance with any  creature in the hive  Sipsyrup the moment that ahe perceived  Stickasting coming towards her fiew off in  alarm leaving poor Silverwing to bear the brunt  of the attack   Who buzzes about me repeated Stickasting  fieroely flying vy dose up to the little nurse  DeOi   Indeed I never named you replied Silver  wing timidly shrinking back as close as she could  to the comb   If you were not talking against me yourselt  you were listening to and encouraging one who  did Who dare say that I am waspish con  tinned Stiokasthig quivering her wings with  anger till they were almost invisible It is this  gossip and slander that make the hive too hot  to hold us I once thought better of you Silver  wing as a quiet goodnatured sort of a bee but  I now see that you are just like the rest and as  silly as you are ugly  This was a very provoking speech it was  intended to be so but Silverwing was not a  creature ready to take offence whatever she felt  she returned no answer an example which I  would strongly recommend to all in her position  whether standing on six feet or on two  But Stickasting was resolved to pick a quarrel  if possible especially with one whom she con  sidered less strong than herself for she was not  one of those generous beings who scorn to take  advantage of the weakness of another Sticka  sting much resembled the class of rude coarse  minded boys who find a pleasure in teasing chil  dren and annoying little girls and like to show  their power over those who dare not oppose it   I owe you a grudge Silverwing for your  conduct to me yesterday When I was toiling  and working at the cells like a slave not having  time to go out for refreshment I saw you fly  past me two or three times and not a drop of  honey did you offer me   I was carrying pollen for my little larv  gently replied Silverwing it is not m j office  to supply the builders thougli I am sure that I  should do 80 with pleasure but the babybees  are placed under my charge and you know what  care they need till they begin to spin   YeSy idle hungry troublesome creatures that  they are Have they not set about their spin  TiiTi g yet m make them stir themselyes  and Stickasting made a movement towards the  nurserycells   The larv» do not like to be disturbed f cried  Silverwing anxious for her charges and pladng  herself between them and the intruder   Like I daresay not but who cares what  they like Get out of the way 111 prick them  up a little r   Tou shall not come near them himmied  the little nurse resolutely keeping her place   I say that I shall who shall hinder me  Gret out of my way or Ill let you feel my sting  Silverwing trembled but she did not stir ftir  she was a faithful little bee As the hen is ready  to defend her chickens from the hawk and een  the timid wren will fight for her brood so this  feeble insect would have given up her life rather  than have forsaken the little ones confided to  her care  But she was not left alone to struggle with  her assailaot two of her winged companions  oame to the rescue and Stickasting who had no  wish to encoTinter such odds and was fonder  perhaps of bullying than of fightings no sooner  saw Waxywill and Honeyball on the wing than  with an angry hum she hurried out of the hive  CHAPTER II  SOME AOOOUNT OF A WAXEBFALL  I WISH that all little nurses were as trustworthy  as Silyerwing or as kind and patient with their  charges While Polly Bright has sat in her  motherB cottage trimming her bonnet till it  looks as absurd as pink ribbons can make it the  poor baby has been crying unheeded in his cne  except that now and then when vexed more  than usual by the noise with an almost angry  look she pauses for a moment to rock the cradle  with her foot She does not notice that little  Johnny has been clambering up by the pail  which her mother has set aside for her washing  till the sudden sound of a fall and a splash and  a childs frightened cry startle her and she sees  little streams running all oyer the stone floor  and Johnny flat on his face in the middle of a  loud roar and a pool of water  Up she JTimps not in the best of tempers poor  Johnny is dragged up by one arm and receives  one or two slaps on the back which only makes  him cry louder than before he stands a picture  of childish misery with dripping dress and open  mouth the tears rolling down his rosy cheeks  helpless and frightened as his careless sister  shakes and scolds him and shakes him again for  what was the effect of her own negligence  Happily for the little boy Minnie Wingfield is  a near neighbour and comes running at the  sound of his distress   Why what is the matter my dear little  man T are her first words as she enters the cot  tage   Look here did you ever see anything like it  His dress clean on today I cannot turn my  back for a moment but he must be at the pail  naughty tiresome mischievous boy and poor  Johnny received another shake A pretty  state the cottage ia in and there Oh my  bonnet my bonnet 1 exclaimed Polly as she saw  that in her hurry and anger she had thrown it  down and that pink ribbons and all it lay on  the floor right across one of the little streams of  water   Never mind the bonnet the poor child may  be hurt and Oh take care the baby will be  wetted and without waiting for Pollys tardy  aid Minnie pushed the cradle beyond reach of  danger  While Polly was yet bemoaning her bonnet  and trying to straighten out its damaged ribbons  Minnie had found out something dry for the  shivering little boy had rubbed him and com  forted him and taken him upon her knee then  asking him to help her to quiet poor baby had  hushed the sickly infant in her arms Was  there no pleasure to her kind heart when its  wailing gradually ceased and the babe fell into  a sweet sleep or when Johnny put his plump  arms tight round her neck and pressed his little  lips to her cheek  There are some called to do great deeds for  mankind some who bestow thousands in charity  some who visit hospitals and prisons and live  and die the benefactors of their race But let  not those who have not power to perform any  thing greaiy imagine that because they can do  little they need therefore do nothing to in  crease the sum of happiness upon earth There  is a terrible amount of suffering caused by neglect  of or unkindness to little children Their lives  often how short are embittered by harshness  their tempers spoiled sometimes their health  injured and can those to whose care the helpless  little ones were confided imagine that there is no  sin in the petulant word the angry blow or that  many will not have one daj to answer for all the  sorrow which they have caused to their Lords  feeble lambs to those whose springtime of life  should be happy  Would my readers like to know a little more  of Minnie Wingfield whose look was so kind  whose words were so gentle that her presence  was like sunshine wherever she went She lived  in a little white cottage with a porch round  which twined roses and honeysuckla There was  a little narrow seat just under this porch where  Minnie loved to sit in the summer evenings with  her work or her book when her work was done  listening to the blackbird that sang in the apple  tree and the humming of the bees amidst the  blossoms Little Minnie led iw retired life but  by no means a useless one K her mothers cot  tage was the picture of neatness it was Minnie  who kept it so clean Her brothers mended  stockings his nicely washed shirts all did credit  to her neat fingers Yet she could find time to  bestow on the garden to trim the borders to watei  the plants to tie up the flowers in which her sick  mother delighted Nor did Minnie neglect the  daily school She was not clever but patient and  ever anxious to please her teacher regarded her  as one of her best scholars and pointed her out  as an example to the rest But Minnies great  enjoyment was in the Simdayschool there she  learned the lessons which made duty sweet to  her and helped her on the right way through the  week The small Bible which had been given to  her by her father with all his yourite verses  marked was a precious companion to Minnie  not studied as a taskbook or carelessly read as a  matter of custom but valued as a treasiu and  consulted as a friend and made the rule and guide  of daily life  And was not Minnie happy In one sense  she certainly was so but still she had her share  of this worlds trials The kind father whom she  had fondly loved had died the year before and  besides the loss of so dear a friend his death had  brought poverty upon his family It was a hard  struggle to make up the rent of the little cottage  which Mrs Wingfield could not bear to quit for  did not everything there remind her of her dear  husband had he not himself made the porch  and planted the flowers that adorned it Often  on a cold winters day the little fire would die  out for want of fuel and Minnie rise stiQ hun  giy from the simple meal which she had spared  that there might be enough for her parent and  her brother  Mrs Wingfields state of health was another  source of sorrow She was constantly ailing and  never felt well and though saved every trouble  by her attentive child and watched as tenderly  as a lady oould have been the aufferings of the  poor woman made her peevish and fretful and  sometimes even harsh to h gentle daughter  Tom her brother was also no small trial to  Minnia Unlike her he had little thought for  anything beyond self he neither considered tlie  eomfort nor the feelings of others if Minnie was  like sunshine in the cottage of her mother Tom  too often resembled a bleak east wind and though  Mrs Wingfield and her daughter never admitted  such a thought their home was happiest when  Tom was not in it  But it is time to return to our hive  CHAPTEB III  A FLATTKBINQ INVITATION  Waxtwxll and Honeyball had both come to the  assistance of Silverwing and she buzzed her  thanks in a grateful way to both though diES  ent motives had brought them to her aid for  they were very different bees in their dispositions  Honeyball was a goodhumoured easy kind of  creature Very ready to do a kindness if it cost  her little trouble but lazy as any drone in  the hive Honeyball would have liked to live  all day in the bell of a foxglove with nothing  to disturb her in her idle feast It was said in  the hive that more than once she had been known  to sip so much that at last she had been unable  to rise and for hours had lain helpless on the  ground Sipsyrup who like other vain silly  creatures was very fond of talking about other  peoples concerns had even whispered that  Honeyball had been seen busy at one of the pro  visioncells stored for the winters use which it  is treason in a bee to touch but as those who  talk much generally talk a little nonsense we  may hope that there was no real ground for the  story  Waxywill was one of whom such a report  would never have been believed there was not a  more honourable or temperate worker in the hive  Tet Stickasting herself was scarcely less liked  so peevish and perverse was the temper of this  bea If desired to do anything it was sure to be  the very thing which she did not fancy Were  oeUs to be built she could not bear moping in  doors if asked to bring honey she always  foimd out that her wings were tired She could  not bear submission to the laws of the hive and  once actually shook her wings at the queen  When she flew to help Silverwing it was less out  of kindness to her than the love of opposing  Stickasting and yet Waxywill was not an  imgeneroTis bee she had more sense too than  insects generally posseas she would have been  respected and even loved in the hive had not her  stubborn wilful temper spoilt alL  We will now follow Sipsyrup in her hasty  flight as leaving both her friend and her charges  behind she made her retreat from Stickasting  How delightful she found the fine fresh air after  the heated hive Now up now down she pur  sued her varying course sometimes humming for  a moment around some fragrant flower then  even before she had tasted its contents deserting  it for one yet more tempting Deeply she  plunged her long tongue into its cup her curious  pliable tongue so carefully guarded by Nature in  a nicely fitting sheath Sheath your tongue P  was an expression which the gossipping little bee  had heard more often than she liked especially  from the mouth of Waarywill It might be an  expressive proverb in other places than Beeland  for there are tongues whose words are more cut  ting than swords that much need the sheath of  discretion  The movements of the lively insect were  watched with much interest by Spinaway the  spider from her quiet home in a rosebush Sip  syrup disdaining the narrow garden of the  school had winged her way over the wall and  turning into a narrow green lane that was near  was now sporting with the blossoms by Mrs  Wingfields porch Spinaway was a clever art  ful spider somewhat ambitious too in her way  She had made her web remarkably firm and  strong and expected to be rewazded by nobler  game than the little aphis or bony knat she  had once succeeded in capturing a bluebotUe fly  and this perhaps it was that raised her hopes so  high that she did not despair of having a bee in  her larder  « Good mommft said Spinaway in a soft  coaxing tone as Sip63rrap came fluttering near  her You seem to have travelled some distance  my fHend and if you should like to rest yourself  here I am sure that you would be heartily wel  come  Sipsyrup was a young inexpeiienoed bee but  she did not much fancy the looks of the spider  with her hunchback and long hairy legs She  politely therefore declined the invitation and  continued her feast in a flower   I am roaUy glad to see a friend in a nice  quiet way continued the persevering spider   I And it very dull to sit here all the day I  would give anything to have wings like a bea  Sipsyrup who loved gossip advanced a little  nearer taking care to keep clear of the Weh   I do long to hear a little news of the world  to know what passes in your wonderful hive 1  am ourions to learn about jour queeu your  manner and style of dress is such that I am  sure that you must have been much about the  court  Settling upon a leaf still at a safe distance  Sipsyrup indulged her taste for chitchat glad to  have so attentive a listener Spinaway soon  heard aU the gossip of the hive how the present  queen had killed in single combat the queen of  another swarm whilst the bees of both nations  watched the fight and how the hostile band  when they saw their queen dead had submitted  to the conqueror at once How a slug had last  morning £rept into the hive and irightened her  out of her wits but had been put to death by  fierce Stickasting before it had crawled more  than an iQch Sipsyrup then related and  really for once her conversation was very amu  sing all the difficulties and perplexity of the  people of the hive as to how to get rid of the  body of the intruder She herself had been  aaid to venture near the monster but Silver  wing and the resl had striven with aU their  might to remove the dead slug from their hive   And did they succeed T said Spinaway much  interested   Oh I it was quite impossible to drag out the  slug We were in such distress sudi a thing  in the hive our hive always kept so neat and  28 A FLATTERING IKYITATION  dean that not a scrap of wax is left lying  about r   Wliat did yon dot said the spider it  really was a distressing affidr T   Waxy will thought of a plan for preventing  annoyance She proposed that we should coyer  the slug all over with wax so that it should  rather appear like a piece of the comb than a  dead creature left in the hive   A capital plan cried Spinaway and was  the thing done   Yes it was and before the day was over   So there Mrs Slug remains in a white wrap  ping laughed the spider a warning to those  who go where they are not wanted You were  I daresay one of the foremost in the work   Not I I would not have touched the ugly  creature with one of my feelers   I beg your pardon T said the spider   indeed I might have judged by your appearance  that nothing but the most refined and elegant  business would ever be given to you I You look  as though you had never touched anything  rougher than a rose T  Tina speech put Sipsyrup in high goodhumour  she began to think that she had judged the spider  harshly and that she really was an agreeable  creature in spite of her ugly hunch   If you speak of delicate work observed the  bee very politely I never saw anything bo fine  as your web   It is tolerably well finished said the spider  with a bow would you honour me by a closer  inspection r   Oh thank you Im not curious in these  matters replied Sipsyrup still feeling a little  doubtful of her new friend   You have doubtless remarked said Spin  away that each thread is composed of about  five thousand others all joined together   No really I had no idea of that how  wonderfully fine they must be   I am surprised that you did not see it at  least if the powers of your eyes equal their  beauty I never beheld anything like them  before their violet colour their beautiful shape  cut as it were into hundreds of divisions like  fine honeycomb cells and studded all over with  most delicate hair I would give my eight eyes  for your two   Two cried Sipsyrup mightily pleased I  have three more on the back of my head   I would give anything to see them if they  are but equal to the facetted onesno creature  in the world could boast of such a set Might I  beg would you favour me  Silly Sipsyrup foolish bee not the first how  ever nor I fear the last to be caught by sugary  words Blended by vanity forward she flew  touched the sticky clammy web entangled her  feet straggled to get free in vain in vain  quivered her wings in terrified efforts shook  the web with all her might but could not  escape Her artful foe looked eagerly on afraid  to approach until the poor bee should have  exhausted herself by her struggles Ah better  for Sipsyrup had she kept in her hive had she  spent all the day in making beebiead to feed  the little larvse in their cells  CHAPTER IV  HOME LESSONS AND HOME TRIALS  Buzz buzz buzz Theres a bee in a webP  cried Tom looking up from the bowl of porridge  which he was eating in the rosecovered porch   Poor thing said Minnie rising from her  seat   A precious fright it must be in what a  noise it makes cried her brother   It is not much entangled I think that I  could set it free and Minnie ran up to the  web   And be stung for your pains nonsense  leave it alona It is good fun to watch it in its  struggles   It never can be good fun to see any creature  in miseiy replied Minnie and with the help of  a little twig in a very short time poor SipEfyrup  was released from the web   Poor little bee said Minnie it has hurt  its wing and some of the web is still clinging to  its legs I am afraid that it cannot fly   I hope that it will sting you laughed Tom   Are you going to nurse and pet it here and  get up an hospital for sick bees   I think that it must belong to our school  mistresss hive I will carry it there and put it  by the opening and let its companions take care  of it and notwithstanding Toms scornful laugh  Minnie bore off the bee on her flnger   You are the most absurd girl that I ever  knew said he on her return What does it  matter to you what becomes of one bee I  should not mind smothering a whole hive   Ah Tom said his sister when there is so  much pain in the world I do not think that one  would willingly add ever so little to it And I  have a particular feeling about animals You  know that they were placed under man and  given to man and they were all so happy until   until man sinned now innocent as they are  they share his punishment of pain and of death  and it seems hard that we should make that  punishment more bitter   Then my tenderhearted sister would never  taste mutton I suppose   No the sheep are given to us for food but I  would make them aa happy as I could while they  lived Ohl Tom we are commanded in the  Bible to be tenderhearted and merciful  and surely to be cruel is a grievous sin   I wonder that you did not crush the spider  that would have eaten up your bee   Why should 11 she did nothing wroilg  It is Nature that has taught her to live on such  food I would be merciful to spidery as well as  to bees   You carried off her dinner she would not  thank you for that   Perhaps I did foolishly said Minnie with a  smile but I cannot see a creature suffering  and not try to help it   I wish that you saw the greengrocers horse  with his bones all starting through his skin and  the marks of the blows on his head What  would you say to the master of that horse   Oh I wish that he would remember that  one verse from the Bible Blessed are the mer  ciful for they shall obtain mercy Without  mercy what would become of the best without  mercy we all should be ruined for ever and if  ordy the merciful can obtain mercy Oh t what  will become of the cruel   Pshaw cried Tom not able to dispute the  truth of Minnies words but not choosing to lis  ten to them for he had too many recollections of  birdnesting cockchaferspinning and wonying  of cats to make the subject agreeable Some  find it easier to silence an opponent with a   pshaw than by reason or strength of argu  ment and this was Toms usual way He did  not wish to continue the conversation and per  haps with a Tiew to change its subject said in  a sudden abrupt tone as he stirred his porridge  with his pewter spoon   Youve not put a morsel of sugar in my  bowl   Yes indeed I put some replied Minnie   But you know that I like plenty I have  told you so a thousand times   But dear Tom I have not plenty to give  you we have nearly come to the end of our  little store and you know continued she  lowering her voice that we cannot buy more  until we are paid for these shirts  The little giri did not add that for the last  three days she had not tasted any sugar herself   Nonsense cried Tom staiiiing up from his  seat and hastily entering the cottage He took  down from the shelf a large broken cup which  was used to contain the store of sugar Mrs  Wingfield was lying asleep in the back room  being laid np with a worse headache than usual  Fearing lest her mother should be roused from  her sleep Minnie followed her brother her finger  on her lip a look of anxious warning on her face  But both look and gesture were lost upon Tom  who was thinking of nothing but himself   Heres plenty for today he said in a care  less tone emptying half the supply into his  bowl   But Torn our poor mother she is ill you  know  « Well Tve not taken it all   But we cannot afford   Dont torment me cried Tom angrily  helping himself to more   Oh dear Tom said the little girl laying  her hand upon his arm   111 not stand this nonsense exclaimed the  boy fiercely and turning suddenly round he flung  the rest of the sugar into the dusty road   There that serves you right that will teach  you another time to mind your own business and  leave me alone and noisily setting down the  empty cup the boy sauntered out of the cottage  Something seemed to rise in Minnies throat   her heart was swelling her cheek was flushed  with mingled sorrow and indignation Oh how  much patience and meekness we require to meet  the daily little trials of life  Minnie was roused by her motheis feeble fret  fill voice I wish that you and Tom had a  little more feeling for me You have awoke me  with your noise 1   I am sorry that you have been disturbed  dear mother 111 try and not let it happen again  Do you fed better nowl   No one feels better for awaking with a start  returned Mrs Wingfield peevishly I should  not have expected such thoughtlessness from  you  Minnies eyes were so brimful of tears that  she dared not VaxA them lest the drops should  run over on her cheek She knew that her mother  would not like to see her cry so turning quietly  away she went to the small fire to make a little  tea for the invalid  There was nothing that Mrs Wingfield en  joyed like a cup of warm tea and when Minnie  brought one to the side of her bed with a nice  little piece of diy toast beside it even the sick  womans worn face looked almost cheerful As  soon however as she had tasted the tea she set  down the cup with a displeased air   Youve forgotten the sugar child   Not forgotten mother but but I have  none   More shame to you cried Mrs Wingfield  her pale ce flushing with anger I am sure  that a good deal was left this morning you  might have thought of your poor sick mother  she has few enough comforts I am sure  Poor Minnie she left the room with a very  heavy heart she felt for some minutes as if  nothing could cheer her Angry with her bro  ther grieved at her mother s undeserved reproach  as she again sat down to work in the little  porch her tears fell fast over her seam Pre  sently Conscience that inward monitor to whose  advice the little girl was accustomed to listen  began to make itself heard This is foolish  this is wrong dry up yocir tears they can but  give pain to your sick mother You must  patiently bear with the fretfulness of iUness and  not add to its burden by showing that you feel  it You know that you have not acted selfishly  you need not regret your own conduct in the  affair is not that the greatest of comforts  But I know very well still Conscience whis  pered in her heart that you never will feel  quite peaceful and happy till no anger remains  towards your brother A little sin disturbs  peace more than a great deal of sorrow ask for  aid to put away this sin  Minnie listened to the quiet voice of Con  Bcienoe and gradually her tears stopped and her  flushed cheek became cool She made a hundred  Rxcuses in her mind for poor Tom He had  been always much indulged he would be sorry  for what he had done how much better he was  than other boys that she knew who drank or  swore or stole And for herself what a sin it  was to have felt so miserable How many bless  ings were given her to enjoy She had health  and sight and fingers able to do work and  neither she nor her mother had difficulty in  procuring it the ladies around were so kind  Then there was the church and the school and  the best of books and the world was so beau  tiful with its bright sun and sweet flowers  there was so much to enjoy so much to be  thankful for And Minnie raised her eyes to  the blue sky above all dotted over with rosy  clouds for it was the hour of sunset and she  thought of the bright happy place to which her  dear father had gone and how she might hope  to join him there and never know sorrow again  What wonder with such sweet thoughts for her  companions if Minnie s face again grew bright  and she worked away in her little porch with a  feeling of peace and grateful love in her breast  which a monarch might have envied I  CHAPTER V  OONYEBSATION IN THE HIVE  Poor Sipsyrup 1 how sadly she stood at the  entrance of the hive where her gentle preserver  had left her The fine down of which she had  been so vain was aU rubbed and injured by her  struggles in the web one of her elegant wings was  torn she felt that all her beauty was gone She  had hardly courage to enter the hive and was  ashamed to be seen by the busy bees flocking in  and out of the door I am not sure that insects  can sigh or I am certain that she must have  sighed very deeply The first thing that gave  her the least feeling of comfort was the sound of  Silverwings friendly hum the poor wounded  insect exerted her feeble strength and crept  timidly into the hive   Sipsyrup can it be cried Honeyball  rousing herself from a nap as the bee brushed  past her   Sipsyrup looking as though she had been in  the wars exclaimed WaxywiU who in the  pride of her heart had always looked with con  tempt on her vain silly companion   My poor Sipsyrup cried Silverwing hasten  ing towards her Their feelers met that is the  way of ernbracinnr in Beeland the kind bee said  little but by every Mendly act in her power  shewed her pity and anxiety to give comfort  What pleased Sipsfyrup most was the absence  of Stickasting who had not returned to the hive  which she had left an hour before in a passion  After resting for a little on a halffinished cell  while Silverwing with her slender tongue gently  smothed her ruffled down and brought a drop of  honey to refresh her Sipsyrup felt well enough  to relate her sad story to which a little group of  surrounding bees listened with no small interest  Sipsyrup left altogether out of her account the  fine compliments paid her by Spinawpy she  could not bear tiiat her Yanity shoidd be known  but she gained little by hiding the truth as this  only made her folly appear more imacoount  able   I cannot understand said Waxywill how  any bee in her senses could fly into a web with  her eyes open r   When there was not even a drop of honey  to be gained by it hummed Honey ball  Sipsyrup hastened to the end of her story and  related how she jhad been sayed from the spider  by the timely help of a kind little girL   May she live upon eglantine all her life  exclaimed Silverwing with enthusiaBm and  have her home quite overflowing with honey  and pollen   This is the strangest part of your adven  tuxe said Honeyball this is the very first  time in my life that I eyer heard of kindness  shown to an insect by a human being   I thought that bees were sometimes fed by  them in winter suggested SHverwing   Fed with sugar and water 1 fit food for a  bee cried Honeyball roused to indignation  upon the only subject that stirred her up to  anything like excitement And have you  never heard how whole swarms have been bar  barously murdered smothered in the hive which  they had filled with so much labour that greedy  man might feast upon their spoils f   If you talk of greediness HoneybaJl drily  observed Waxywill I should say keep your  tongue in a sheath   I am glad that it is not the custom for men  to eat bees as well as their honey laughed  Silverwing   Oh they are barbarous to everything  whether they eat it or not exclaimed Waxywill  with an angry buTz Have I not seen a poor  butterfly basking in the sun glittering in her  vest of purple and gold Ah Sipsyrup in your  very best day you were no better than a black  beetle compared to her  An hour before Sipsyrup would have felt  ready to sting Waxywill for such an insolent  speech but the pride of the poor bee was  humbled and when Waxywill observed her  Bilenoeand noticed her drooping looks she  felt secretly ashamed of her provoking words  She continued Have I not seen the butterfly  I say dancing through the air as though life  was all sunshine and joy I have seen a boy  look on her not to admire not to feel pleasure  in beholding her beauty but eager to lay that  beauty in th dust and seize on his little victim  1 have Watched him creeping softly his hat in  his hand as anxious about his prize as if to  destroy a poor insects happiness was the way to  seciire his own Now the unconscious butterfly  rose high above the reach of her pursuer then  sank again to earth to rest upon a flower whose  tints were less bright than its wings Down  came the hat there was a shout from the boy  the butterfly was prisoner at last If he had  caught it to eat it as the spider caught Sipsyrup  I cQuld have forgiven him for men as well as  bees must have food and I suspect that they do  not live entirely upon honey but it made me  wish for a hundred stings when I saw the  wretched insect lying on the ground fluttering  in the agonies of death the boy had barbarously  torn off its bright beautiful wings and had not  even the mercy to put it out of pain by setting  his foot upon it   It had never injured him murmured  Silverwing   It had never injured any one it desired  nothing but to be allowed to spend its short life  in peace   How would the boy have liked to hare had  his wings torn off said Honeyball for the  amusement of some creature stronger than him  self   Men and boys are worse than hornets f  muttered Waxywill   But we have found one of humankind  hummed Silverwing cheerfully who could be  merciful even to a bee Perhaps in the world  there may be others like her too noble too  generous to use their strength to torture and  destroy what cannot resist them  Waxywill and Honeyball now took their  departure I fear rather for their own pleasure  than for the benefit of the hive as Waxywill  was not in a humour to work and Honeyball  was always in a humour to idle As soon as  they had flown out of reach of hearing poor Sip  syrup said in a very dull tone I wonder what  is to become of me now poor unhappy insect  that I am I fear that I shall never be able to  fly and to live on here in this wretched way is  almost worse than to be eaten by a spider I   Oh you shoidd not say so replied gentle  Silverwing you can still crawl about and you  are safe in your own home   Safe I am miserable With what pleasure  I had thought of joining the first swarm that  should fly off I am tired of the hive this noisy  bustling hive I have lost everything that I cared  for everything that made life pleasant my  beauty my strength my power of flying I have  nothing left   But your duties added Silverwing make  them your pleasures I My dear friend if you  no more can be pretty you may still be useful  if you no more can be admired you can still  be loved You may not be able to go far or to  see much but there are better joys to be found  in your own home  Before the night closed both the little nurse  bees were busy feeding the larvse  CHAPTER V  A BTINOINQ BEPBOOF  The Sunset was still casting a red glow over the  earth throwing the long shadows of the trees on  the ground and lighting up the cottage windows  as Polly Bright stood at the door of her cottage  watching for her mothers return  Mrs Bright was a hardworkmg woman who  during the absence of her husband a soldier in  the Crimea earned many an hoiest shilling as  char woman in the house of the Squire on the  hill She generally managed to let Polly have  the advantage of attending the school in the  morning though herself unable to read she  liked the idea of her daughter being a scholar  and as plain work was also taught in the school  she thought that what Polly acquired there might  make her not only more learned but more use  ful But it was only for attendance in the  morning that the char womans child could be  spared from her home During her mothers  frequent absence all the charge of the cottage  and care of the children belonged of course to  Polly Bright  I cannot say that the little parlour could com  pare in neatness with that of Mrs Wingfield  There was a chest of drawers in one of the cor  ners and on it was heaped a strange medley of  things Teapot and broken jug old shawl and  a babys rattle nutmegscraper bellows saucepan  and books were piled in sad confusion Nor  would I have advised you to have attempted to  open one of the drawers They were sometdmes  too full to be opened at all and stuck tight against  every effort as if aware that they were not fit to  be seen Polly was too fond of adorning herself  to care for adonung her cottage Bhe was not  aware how r better it looks to be simple neat  and dean and dressed according to our station  than to be decked oiit with gaudy finery and try  to ape the appearance of those whom Providence  has placed above us  You will remember that we visited this cot  tage in the third chapter and there is little  change in the appearance of things there now  The damp on the floor occasioned by Johnnys  accident has dried up and so have the tears of  the little boy who seated upon a stool near his  sisters feet is cramming his mouth with bread  and butter with an air of great content But  the thin sickly baby is stiQ in his cradle still  uttering his feeble unheeded wail for the poor  little creature is teething hard and has no other  way of expressing his pain Polly never notices  his heated lips and swelled gums she is more  occupied with herself tliis evening than usual  for Mrs Jjarkins the farmers wife has invited  her to tea and as soon as her mother returns to  take her place she will be off to amuse herself  at Greenhill Oh yes you might be certain  that some gay meeting was expected Look at  the necklace of false coral round her neck the  halfsoiled lace which she has sewn round her  frock and her hair all in papers at this hour of  the day you would laugh were yqu to see her  but to me the fidght of her folly is really too sad  for laughing Of what is she thinking as she  quickly untwists the papers and curls her long  hair round her fingers Her thoughts are  divided between impatience at her mothers  delay fears of herself being late for the party  and wishes that the pedlar would only happen  to call at her cottage  She had heard that day from one of her  schoolfellows that a man had been going about  the neighbourhood with a pack so ftdl of beauti  ful things that such a collection had never  before been seen in the village Polly had been  particularly tempted by the description of some  brooches made of false diamonds and exactly  like real ones as the girl who had never seen a  jewel in her life very positively affirmed One  of these fine brooches was to be had for six  pence how eager was Polly to be its possessor  She coimted over her little treasure of pence  and found that she had sufficient for the pur  chase  But how was she to find the pedlar Had  Polly not been tied to the cottage by what she  called these tiresome children she would long  ago have gone in search of him She could  hardly expect him to pass down her little lane  but she was near enough to the high road to see  if any one passed along it in going through the  Tillage At one time she liad set little Johnny  to watch and more than once her hopes had  been raised as the little feUow shouted aloud   Theres the man But Polly came running  first to see a drover th pigs then the baker  with his little cart going his rounds she had a  disappointment poor Johnny a slap and he was  sent crying into the cottage I This was rather  hard upon him poor little feUow How could  a child not three years old be expected to  know the difference between a pedlar and a  baker  But all was quiet again in the cottage Johnny  occupied with his supper and Polly with her  curlpapers when in through the open door who  should make her entrance but Stickasting She  came in as usual in no amiable mood quite  ready to take offence on the very shortest  notice She first settled on the little babys  arm but the infimt lay perfectly still halfcom  forted in his troubles by sucking his thumb  the most passionate bee in the world could find  no excuse for being angry with him Stick  asting rested for a few moments on the thin  tiny arm then rose and approached Polly  Bright  Every sensible person knows that when a bee  or a wasp hovers near the safest way is to keep  quiet and take no notice but Polly was not a  very sensible person and being not very cou  rageous neither was quite frightened when the  insect touched her face If Stickasting had mis  taken it for a flower she would very soon have  found out her blunder and left the little girl in  peace but starting back with a cry Polly  struck the bee and Stickasting roused to fury  quickly returned the blowl Mad with passion  the insect struck her sting so deep that it was  impossible to withdraw it again and she left  it behind which occasions certain death to a  bee  Stickasting felt at once that she had thrown  away her life in a wild desire for revenge that  her destruction was caused by her own violent  act she crawled feebly a few inches from the  spot where she fell and expired a victim to  her temper  Loud was the scream which Polly Bright  uttered on being stung so loud that it brought  from the opposite cottage both Minnie Wiog  field and her brother On finding out the cause  of PoUys distress Minnie hastily ran back for  the bluebag or a little honey to relieve the  pain of her schoolfellow But Tom who had  very little pity in his nature stood shaking with  laughter at the adventure   Stung by a beel stung on the very tip of  the nose what a beauty you will look at Green  hill tonight ha ha ha if 70a oould only see  how funny you look your hair half in curlpapers  and half hanging down and your eyes as red  with crying as the coral iound your neck You  are for all the world like dlly Sally t   It does not show much does itf said poor  Folly anxiously as Minnie returned with the  bluebag   It is swelling cried Tom swelling higher  and higher twill be just like the turkeycocks  comb   Then I cant go tonight I wiU not go  exclaimed Polly sitting down and bursting into  tears  Tom laughed louder Minnie in vain tried to  comfort all Pollys happiness was for the time  overthrown by a bee It rested but on trifles  and a trifle was enough to make her wretched  for the rest of that day  CHAPTER VII  A WONDERFUL BORE  The sun set the rooks in the squires park had  gone to roost the bats flew round the ivycovered  tower of the village church The hive was  becoming quiet and still the bees hanging in  dusters prepared to go to sleep but Stickastmg  had never returned 1 Silverwing listened in vain  for the Wellknown sound of her angry hum and  wondered what could have delayed her com  panion But never again was the poor bee to  Hy back to the hive never again to labour at the  waxen cells aitid alas how little was her  presence missed still less was it regretted  The next morning was warm bright and  sunny the bees were early on the wing The  larvae were beginning to spin their webs and  therefore no longer required food so Silverwing  was free to range over the fields and gather  honey for the hive So tempting was the day  that even Honeyball shook her lazy wings and  crept to the door there stood for a few  moments jostled by her more active fellowser  vants and finally flew off in quest of food  How delightful was the air how fragrant  the breeze 1 The buttercups spread their carpet  of gold and the daisies their mantle of silver  over the meadows all glittering with the drops  of bright dew Honeyball soon found a flower  to her taste and never thought of quitting it till  she had exhausted all its honied store She had  a dim idea that it was her duty to help to fill  the cells but poor Honeyball was too apt to  prefer pleasure to duty   I should like to have nothing to do she  murnmred litiJe thinking that a listener was  near   like to have nothing to do Is it from a  hivebee that I hear such words from one  whose labour is itself all play Honeyball  turned to view the speaker and beheld on a sign  post near her the most beautifrd bee that shehad  ever seen Her body was larger than that of a  hivebee and her wings were of a lovely violet  colour like the softest tint of the rainbow  Honeyball felt a little confused by the address  and a little ashamed of her own speech but as  all bees consider each other as cousins felt it  best to put on a frank easy air   Why certainly flying about upon a morn  ing like this and making elegarU extracts frtm  flowers is pleasant enough for a time But may  I ask ladybee contined Honeyball if you  think as lightly of working iq wax   Working in wax half contemptuously  replied Violetta a soffc thing which you can  bend and twist any way and knead into any  shape that you choose Come and look at my  home here and then ask yourself if you have  any reason to complain of your work   Naturalists doubt whether the ioletbee is a native  of Britain It ia known that one species of carpenter  bees ia to be found in England ibut the one descnbed  above probably belongs to foreign lands  Honeyball looked forward with her two  honeycombed eyes and upwards and backwards  with her three others but not the shadow of a  hire could she perceive anywhere May I  venture to ask where you live said she at  last   This way cried Violetta waving her feeler  and pointing to a little round hole in the post  which Honeyball had not noticed before It  looked gloomy and dark and strange to the  bee but Violetta who took some pride in her  mansion requested Honeyball to step in   You cannot doubt my honour said she  observing that the hiveworker hesitated or be  suspicious of a cousin Honeyball assured her  that she had never dreamed of such a thing and  entered the hole in the post  For about an inch the way sloped gently  downwards then suddenly became straight as a  weU so dark and so deep that Honeyball would  have never attempted to reach the bottom had  she not feared to offend her new acquintance  She had some hopes that this perpendicular pas  sage might only be a long entrance leading to  some cheerful hive but after having explored  to the very end and having found nothing but  wood to reward her search she crept again up  the steep narrow way and with joy found her  self once more in the sunshine   What do you tliink of it said Yioletta  rather proudly   I I do not think that your hive would  hold many bees Is it perfectly finifdied may I  inquire i   No I have yet to divide it into chambers  for my children each chamber filled with a  mixture of pollen and honey and divided from  the next by a ceiling of sawdust But the boring  was finished today   Tou do not mean to say exclaimed Honey  ball in surprise that that long gallery was ever  bored by bees   Kot by heeSf replied Yioletta with a dignified  bow but by one bee I bored it all myself  The indolent Honeyball could not conceal her  amazement Is it possible that you sawed it  all outwith your teeth 1   Every inch of the depth Yioletta replied   And that you can gather honey and pollen  enough to fill itl   I must provide for my children or they  woxdd starve   And you can make ceilings of such a thing  as sawdust to divide your home into cells V   This is perhaps the hardest part of my task  but nevertheless this must be done   Where will you find sawdust for this car  penters work   See jonder little heap I have gathered it  together those are my cattmgs from my tunnel  in the wood   You are without doubt a most wonderftii  bee And you really labour all alone T   All alone replied Violetta  Honeyball thought of her own cheerful hive  with its thousands of workers and divisions of  labour and waxen cells dropping with golden  honey she scarcely could believe her own five  eyes when she saw what one persevering insect  could do Her surprise and her praise pleased  the violetbee who took pride in shewing every  part of her work describing her difficulties and  explaining her manner of working   One thing strikes me said Honeyball  glancing down the tunnel I should not much  like to have the place of your eldest larva im  prisoned down there in the lowest cell unable  to stir till all her sisters have eaten their way  into daylight  Violetta gave what in Beeland is considered  a smile I have thought of that difficulty  and of a remedy too I am about to bore a  little hole at the end of my tunnel to give the  young bee a way of escape from its prison And  now added Violetta I will detain you no  longer so much remains to be done and time is  so precious You probably have something to  collect for your live I am too much your friend  to wish you to be idle  Honeyball thanked her new acquaintance and  flew away somewhat the wiser for her visit  but feeling that not for ten pairs of purple wings  would she change places with the carpenterbee  CHAPTER VIII  A CHA8B AND ITS CONSEQTTENCES   Theres the pedlar Oh dear and just as  mother has gone out cried Polly who on  beginning her afternoon business of nurse to the  little children saw or thought that she saw at  the end of her lane a man with a pack travelling  along the high road There he is Oh if I  could only stop him or if any one would look  after the baby whilst I am gone Minnie Wing  field Ah 1 how stupid I am to forget that she  is now at the afternoon school I think that  baby would keep very quiet for five minutes he  cannot roll out of his cradle but Johnny hed  be tumbling down or setting the cottage on fire  I cannot leave him for a minute by himself   Johnny said she suddenly I want to catch  the pedlar and see his pretty things will you  come with me like a good little boyi  Johnny scrambled to his feet in a moment to  the full as eager as herself Polly held his fkt  little hand tight within her own and began run  ning as hst as she could drag him along But  the poor childs round heavy figure and short  steps were altogether unsuited for anything like  a race Polly felt him as a dead weight hanging  to her arm in vain she pulled dragged and  jerked now began to encourage and now to  scold poor Johnny became tired irightened and  out of breath and at last fairly tumbled upon  his face   Get up Tm in such a hurry no answer  but a roar Stupid child hell be gone I  Johnny bellowed louder than before There  m leave you on the road you great tiresome  boy I you have half pulled out my arm with  dragging you on Ill leave you there and silly  Sally may get ou  Then without heeding the poor little childs  cries and entreaties that she would stop as he  lay on the ground half suffocated with sobs  Polly Bright thinking only of the prize which  her vanity made her so much desire hastened  after the pedlar  Silly Sally who has been twice mentioned in  my tale was a poor idiot woman who lived with  some kind neighbours on a common about two  miles from the village She was perfectly harmlesu  and therefore allowed to go about with freedom  wherever she chose but the terrible misfortune  alas exposed her to the scorn and sometimes  even persecution of wicked children who made  the worst use of the senses left them hj torment  ing one already so much afflicted Poor Sally  used to wander about the lanes uttering her  unmeaning sound Perhaps even she had some  pleasure in life when the sun shone brightly and  the flowers were out for she would gather the  wild rose from thie bank or the scarlet poppies  from the field and weave them into garlands for  her head iNothing pleased her more than when  she found a long feather to add to her gaudy  wreath if the poor witless creature had delight  in making herself gay Polly at least had no  right to laugh at her  Timid and easily frightened the idiot felt a  nervous terror for schoolboys for which they  had given her but too much cause She had  been hooted at even pelted with mud pursued  with laughter like a hunted beast twice had  Minnie to interfere with her brother pleading  even with tears for one so helpless and unhappy  If there be anything more brutal and hateful  than cruelty to a harmless animal it is heartless  barbarity to a defenceless idiot to one who  bears our image is descended from our race and  whose only crime is the being most unfortunate  Deal gently dear children with the poor sense  less idiot we trust that there is a plaee in  heaven even for him the powers denied him in  this world may be granted in the next and in a  brighter realm although never here below he  may be found at his Lords feet clothed cmd in  his right mind  On hastened the little girl breathless and  panting At the place where the roads joined  she looked anxiously up the highway to see if  she had not been mistaken in her distant view of  the traveller No there was the pedlar pack  and all and no mistake but walking more briskly  than might have been expected from his burden  and the warmth of the afternoon his pack must  have been much lightened since he first set out  vith it  Polly called out but he either did not hear  or did not attend the wind was blowing the  dust in her face she was tired with her vain  attempts to drag poor Johnny her shoes were  down at heel and hindered her running for it by  no means follows that those who wish to be fine  care to be tidy also But the brooch of false  diamonds the coveted brooch the thought of   that urged her on to still greater efforts even  the remembrance of her swelled nose was lost in  the hope of possessing such a beautiful orna  ment 1 Polly as she shuffled hastily along saw  more than one person meet the pedlar if thev  would but stop him if only for one minute to  give her time to get up with him at last No  one stopped him how fast he seemed to walk  Follys face was flushed and heated her hair  hung about her ears would that we were as  eager and perseyering in the pursuit of what  really is precious as the girl was in that of a  worthless toy  At last her gaapedout Stop reached the  ear of the pedlar he paused and turned round  and in a few minutes more his pack was opened  to the adminng eyes of Polly Ah how she  coveted this thing and that how she wished that  her six pennies were shillings instead Acheny  ooloured neckerchief a pink silk lace a large  steel pin and a jewelled ring how they took her  ncy and made her feel how difficult it is to  decide when surrounded by many things alike  tempting  But at last the wonderful brooch of false  diamonds was produced there was only one left  in the pedlars stock how fortimate did Polly  think it that it also had not been sold necker  chief lace pin or ring as nothing compared to  this She tried it on had some doubts of the  strength of the pin tried in vain to obtain a  lessening of the price it ended in the girls  placing all her pence in the hand of the pedlai  and cairying home h prize with delight She  had had her insh her yanity was gratified the  brooch was her own but to possess is not always  to enjoy  Polly returned to her cottage with much  slower steps she was heated and tired and  perhaps a little conscious that she had not been  faithful to her trust As she came near her  home she quickened her pace for to her surprise  she heard Yoices within and Yoices whose tones  told of anxiety and fear These were the words  which struck her ear and made her pause ere  she yentured to enter   What a mercy it is that I returned for the  basket that I had forgotten if I had not what  would have become of my poor babe r exclaimed  Mrs Bright in much agitation   I cant understand how it happened replied  another voice which Polly knew to be that of  Mrs Wingfield   You may well say that said the mother  Polly could hear that she was rocking her chair  backwards and forwards as she sometimes did  when hushing the sick child to sleep I left  Polly in charge of the children I came back to  find her gone and my poor poor baby in a fit  Polly turned cold and trembled so that she  could hardly stand   Is there no one who could go for a doctor 1  continaed the agitated moth another fit  may come on I would give the world to see  him   I am so feeble replied Mrs Wingfield that  I am aaid   Take the baby then and Til go myself not  a moment is to be lost   No no theres my boy Tom cried Mrs  Wingfield as she saw her son ran hastily into  her little cottage which was just opposite to  Mrs Brights   Oh send him in mercy send him cried  the mother and her neighbour instantly crossed  over to fulfil her wishes passLug Polly as she  did so and looking at her with mingled surprise  and scorn though in too much haste to address  her   My boy my own darling murmured the  anxious mother pressing her sick child to her  bosom what will your father say when he  hears of this Except her low sad voice the  cottage was so still that the very silence was  terrible to Polly it would have been a relief to  have heard the feeble fretful wail which had  made her feel impatient so often I  With pale anxious face and noiseless step  dreading to meet her mothers eye the imhappy  girl stole into the cottage There sat Mrs  Bright her bonnet thrown back from her head  her hair hanging loose her gaze fixed upon the  child in her arms whilst the poor little babe  with livid waxen features and halfclosed eyes  lay so quiet and looked so terribly ill that but  for his hard Kreathing his sister would have  feared that his life had indeed passed away  Mrs Bright raised her head as Polly entered  and regarded her with a look whose expression  of deep grief was even more terrible than anger  She asked no question perhaps the misery in  which she saw the poor girl made her unwilling  to add to her suffering by reproach or perhaps  and this was Pollys own bitter thought she  considered her unworthy of a word Whatever  was the cause no conversation passed between  them except a few short directions from the  mother about things connected with the comfort  of the baby as poor Polly with an almost burst  ing heart tried to do anything and everything  for him  In the meantime Tom had gone for the doctor  though with an unwillingness and desire to delay  which had made his mother both surprised and  indignant   He should go by the fields he said though  he well knew that to be the longest way and he  would have done so had not Mrs Wingfield  roused herself to such anger that even her rude  nd undutiful son did not dare to disobey her  The doctor came in about an hoar Tom hav  ing happily found him at home and with an  anxiety which those who have attended beloved  ones in the hour of sickness only can tell Mrs  Bright and Polly listened for his opinion of the  case ThS doctor examined the child and asked  questions concerning his illness How long had  the fit lasted There was a most painful pause  Mrs Bright looked at her daughtej Polly could  not utter a word it was not till the question  was repeated that the distressing reply No one  knows was given   Was the child long ailing T   How wa he when you left himf said Mrs  Bright to the miserable Polly   Yery well thats to say I dont exactly  he was I think   There has been gross negligence here said  the doctor sternly gross negligence he re  peated and it may cost the child his life  Polly could only clasp her hands in anguish  but the mother exclaimed Oh sir is there no  hope for my boy I   While there is life there is hope replied the  doctor in a more kindly tone he must be bled  at once Have you a basin here he added  taking a small instrumentcase from his pocket  PoUy was at all times timid and nervous and  quite unaccustomed to selfcommand and now  when she would have given worlds to have been  useful her hand shook so violently her feelings  BO overcame her that there was no chance of her  doing anything but harm   Give the basin to me dear said a gentle  voice behind her Minnie Wingfiela had just  entered the cottage You look so ill you must  not be present go up stairs Polly I will help  your mother   Oh what shall I doT cried the miserable  girl wringing her hands   Go and pray whispered Minnie as she  glided from her side and Polly trembling and  weeping slowly went up the narrow wooden  staircase and entering her little chamber sank  down upon her knees   Oh spare him only spare him my darling  little brother r she could at first utter no other  words She had never loved the baby as she did  now when she feared that she might be about to  lose him and bitterly she lamented her own  impatient temper that had madiB her weary of the  duty of tending him Oh that we would so act  towards our relations that if death should  remove any one from our home oitr grief should  not be embittered by the thought I was no  comfort or blessing to him while he was here and  now the opportunity of being so is gone for  ever  A CHABE AND ITS OONiiQUENCEa Go  But the most tenible thought to Polly was  that the babys dauger might be partly owing to  her neglect should he die should the little  darling be taken away could her mother ever  forgive her As Polly sobbed in an agony of  grief something fell from her bosom upon the  floor she started at the sight of her forgotten  brooch that whioh she had coveted so much  that which had cost her so dear Snatching it  up and springing to her feet with a sudden  impidse she ran to the window and flung it far  out into the lane Then once more falling on  her knees again she prayed but more calmly and  she implored not only that the baby might live  but that her own weak vain heart might be  cleansed that she might henceforth live not only  for herself but do her duty as a faithful servant  of God She rose somewhat comforted and  creeping downstairs listened ere sHe ventured to  enter the little parlour   I hope that he may do well now I shall send  something for him tonight keep him quiet  I shall call here tomorrow These were the  doctors parting words and they were a great  relief to Polly She came in softly and bent  down by the baby now laid again in his little  cradle and looking white as the sheet that was  over him she would have kissed his thin pale  face but she feared to disturb the poor child  Her heart waa full of mingled sorrow and love she  felt as though she could never bear to leave him  again   Thank you JMinnie my girl said Mrs  Bright earnestly you have been a real comfort  to me in my time of need Your mother is a  happy woman to have such a child   Can I do anything else for you nowl said  Minnie if you would allow me to sit up  instead of you tonight r   No no I could not cl6se an eye But I  should be glad if you would bring Johnny home  my dear it is near his bedtime and I do not  think that he will disturb the baby   I will bring him with pleasure where is  her said Minnie   Where is hef repeated Mrs Bright is he  not at your home   No he has not been there all day Polly  started as if she had been stabbed   Then where is he cried Mrs Bright looking  anxiously round is he upstairs Polly The  miserable girl shook her head Her fears for the  baby had made her quite forget her little brother  and it now flashed across her mind that she had  not passed him in the lane when she had retraced  her steps to the cottage Where could he have  gone where could he be now  Mrs Bright had endured much but her cup  A CHASE AND ITS CX17SBQUENC£S 67  seemed now to overflow she walked close up to  Polly laid a heavy grasp upon her shoulder and  said in a tone which the girl remembered to her  dying day When was your brother last with  your   About two hours ago just before you  returned home faltered Polly   And where did you leave him V   In the lane near the highroad   Go and find him said the mother between  her clenched teeth or never let me set eyes on  you again  Polly rushed out of the cottage and began her  anxious search up and down the lane by the  hedge in the ditch along the road asking every  person that she met and from every one receiving  the same disheartening answer Ko one had  seen the boy no one could think what had  lecome of him he was too young to have wan  dered far had he run towards the road he must  liave been met by Polly if the other way he  must have been seen by his mother he could  not have got over the hedge there was no possi  bility of his having lost his way Many neigh  bours joined in the search many pitied the  unhappy mother but she was less to be pitied  than Polly  CHAPTER IX  PBISONS AND PBISONBBS  We will DOW retiim to our little friend Honey  ball whom we left flying from the cnrious dwell  ing of the carpenterbee We will follow her as  she lazily proceeded along the lane in which were  situated the cottages of Mrs Wingfield and Mrs  Bright the sweet flowers in the garden of the  former rendering it a favourite resort for bees  This was not long after noon and therefore a  few hours before all the troubles related in the  last chapter had occurred while Polly and her  two little charges were yet safe in their own  comfortable cottage  Honeyball looked at Spinaway busily mending  her net torn by the adventure of Sipsyrup and  laughed as she thought of the folly of her com  panion Honeyball was not vain enough to be  enticed by sugared words her dangers arose from  quite another source her greediness and great  selfindulgence Her eye was now attracted by  a little bottle hung up by the porch not far  from the rosebush it had been placed there by  Tom to catch wasps perhaps he had hoped to  entrap some others of the winged tribes for he  had just taken a fancy to make a collection of  insects and woe unto any small creature that  xniglit UR into bis merqiless hands  Honeyball alighted on the bottle then flut  tered to the top allured hj the sugary scent  The brim was sticky she unsheathed her long  lright tongue tasted approved and then sipped  again At this moment she heard a buzz near  her and looking up with her bac eyes perceived  her friend Silviwing   Do come from that huge bright hard cell  cried the bee I am sure that it never was  formed by any of our tribe and I do not believe  that it holds honey   It holds something very good and in such  abundance too replied Honeyball a thousand  honeysuckles would not contain so much   There is danger I am certain that there is  danger I cried Silver wing what if it should  have been placed there on purpose to catch usi   You think me as foolish as Sipsyrup  « Ko not foolish but   Too fond of good living and too lazy to like  trouble in procuring it Well I daresay that  you are right Silverwing I believe that as you  say there may be danger   Then why not corae away 2 persisted the bee   Because the taste is so good said her com  panion bending over the rim the next moment  she was struggling in the syrup  Ah Honejball weak foolish insect In  Tain do you struggle ii vain do you buzz in  vain your grieved friend flutters against the  glass you have sacrificed yourself for a little  indulgence like thousands who look at the tempir  ing glass know their danger yet will not abstain  As Silverwing on the outside of the bottle  was uttering her hum of pity and rogret sud  denly a handkerchief was thrown over her and  the loud rough voice of Tom was heard   Bather a paltiy beginning to my collection  a wretched hivebee But I have caught it so  cleverly without its being crushed or spoiled by  the syrup and I will keep it till I get that stuff  which Ben told me of which kills insects without  hurting their beauty 1  Poor unhappy Silverwing she was indeed in  a terrible position she had not even power to  use her sting in selfdefence for to plunge it into  the handkerchief would have been useless indeed  and she felt all that a bee might be expected to  feel in the power of its most cruel foe Tom  carried her into the cottage and carefolly un  clofiing the handkerchief after he had moimted  upon a chair to reach the shelf easily he shook  his poor prisoner into his own mug and tied  some paper firmly over the top  Silverwing flew round and round buzzing in  terror she only hurt her wings against the  sides Then she crawled over the paper which  formed thcr ceiling of her prison but no hole for  escape could she find It was clear that she was  now shut out from all hope condemned perhaps  to some lingering death while her companions  were flying about busy and happy she was to  pine a lonely prisoner here At first her feel  ings were those of despair then quietly though  sadly she made up her mind to submit to her  cruel fate She no longer fluttered about rest  lessly but settling at the bottom of the mug in  patience awaited the return of her tormentor  Hours passed before Tom came back there  had been other voices in the cottage but no one  had touched the place of Silverwing s imprison  ment Mrs Wingfield had been called out hastily  by her neighbour Mrs Bright on the discovery  of the illness of the baby and as Minnie had  not then returned from school the cottage was  left quite empty Presently there was a rapid  step then the sound of some one jumping up on  the chair Silverwing felt the mug moved then  the paper raised she was ready to make a last  eflbrt to escape through the opening but her  little tyrant took good care to give no time for  that he only shook in another victim and then  shut down the paper quickly and placed a book  on the top  Silverwing paid no attention to what w  passing in tke cottage round ber tbough I may  OB well remind the reader of what passed in the  labt chapter how Tom had scarcely got down  from the chair before bis mother came in and  ordered him to go off in haste for the doctor as  Mrs Brights baby was very ill indeed how  Tom hesitated and said that be would go by the  fields and then was sent off direct by bis mother  in much displeasure To all this as I said Sil  verwihg paid no attention ber little world was  contained ih the mug and all ber interest was  arouaed by her fellowprisoner Poor Violetta  with bei fine purple wings was the prey of the  collector of insects He had not caired to explore  ber curious home to learn her customs and ways  or admire ber instinct be only wished to have  the dead body of an insect that he thought curi  ous and had no scruple about destroying it to  gratify this wish  Violetta was not so patient as poor Silverwing  had been She dashed herself against the mug  in passionate distress she would listen to no  words of comfort Then she vainly tried to  exercise her wonderful powers of gnawing from  a wooden box she perhaps might have W»rked  ber way to freedom but the bard slippery  crockery resisted her utmost efforts her poor  little teeth could not even make an impression i  Exhausted at last she remained quite still and  JBilverwing forgetful of ker own distress began  to attempt to soothe her oompanion  Thus they remained till the evening without  food almost without hope Mrs Wingfield had  gone to Attempt to comfort her neighbour nearly  wild at the loss of her Johnny and now Minnie  and Tom both entered the cottage together  Their conversation had no interest for the bees  in their mug but as it is possible that it may  have some for my reader I shall proceed to give  some account of it in the following apter  CHAPTEE X  A GONFBSSION   Oh Tom said Minnie is not thm a terrible  mififortune that has happened to poor Mrs«  Bright r  Tom gave a rt of grunt of assent   And the baby so ill Motr doubts that  he will live over the night I am glad that you  found the doctor so soon But what can have  become of dear little Johnny i The Barnes and  the Smiths have been all on the search they  Hay that if the wind had not been blowing the  dust so much along the lane the little fdlow  might have been tracked by his footsteps Nr  one can imagine where he can have gone he ia  o very young so unable to wander far Poor  Polly I am so sorry for her   I wish that you would not be talking for  ever about Johnny 1 exclaimed Tom in a petu  lant tone   How can one think or talk of anything  elser replied Minnie sadly I did so love that  noble boy 1   Have done with it cried her brother more  angrily than before  Minnie looked at him with pain and then  said in a low tone I thought that you had  even joined in the search   I have joined I would give anything to  find him T exclaimed Tom striking his hand on  the table as he spoke with such passionate energy  that he almost startled his sister   Did you see nothing of the dear child said  Minnie as a thought suddenly occurred to her   when you came to our cottage just before you  went for the doctor you know V   Didnt I tell you that I wanted to hear no  more about the matter cried Tom his whole  face becoming the colour of crimson  Minnies eyes were fixed upon him steadily  earnestly rude bold boy as he was he shrank  from her piercing gaze Going nearer to her  brother and speaking very distinctly but in a  voice hardly above a whisper she said I be  Keve that you know more about Johnny than  you will teU   Believe what you like and let me alone   Tom I implore you hide nothing from us  Oh think of the misery of the poor broken  hearted mother and she laid her hand upon  his arm   Speak another word and 111 strike you  eried Tom roughly shaking her off   Strike me if you will but I Tmist speak  Where did you see that child last f   You can get nothing out of me growled  Tom   Then I must call those who can said Minnie  firmly turning round as if to quit the cottage   This is a matter of life or death She looked  pale but very determined   Whom are you going to call said Tom his  manner betraying some fear   My mother if necessary the clergyman  or the magistrate Tom caught her by the  arm as he exclaimed Stop Minnie oh stop  you shall hear all and judge I dont know  where the boy is I would give my right hand  that I did it is true that I saw him last and  I have searched aU the place again and again  You would not betray me you would not  Minnie you might ruin me but could not  help Jobimy Sit dowa here and liien to me  quietly and you shall know everything that hafi  happened  Minnie sat down beside him her heart beat  ing jBnAt He gave her a short but true acoount of  what had passed omitting however some little  particulars whioh we shall relate more at length  You will remember that we left poor Johnny  crying in the lane vainly trying to call bade his  sister as she hurried in purstut of the pedlar  When the child found his terrors unheeded his  loud roar gradually sank into a low broken sob  he scrambled to his feet rubbed his plump dusty  hand across his eyes to brush away the tears  and began to think of trotting back to the  oottage  Just as the little fellow was commencing his  journey he heard a voice call him £rpm the  other side of the hedge which bordered the nar  row lane At first iicying that it might be  silly Sally with whom he had been threatened  Johnny was inclined to run the faster for the  call but he soon knew Tom when he saw him  clambering over and holding something in his  hand   Heres something for you my jolly little  man cried Tom who amused himself some  times by playing with but more ten by teasing  his little rosycheeked neighbour  What goti asked the cMid as Tom jumped  down beside him Johmij was always sparing  of his words   A nest of little birds that was swinging on  a bough I knocked off the nest and down caane  the birds   All dead f said Johnny sadly   Why yes you see they had some way to  £dl the little things broke their necks so there  was an end of them   Poor ittle birds knocked off tree said  the pitying child Tom was provoked at seeing  the pity   What a siUy little goose you are Johnny  It was fine fiin to set nest and all aflying and  finish the whole family at once  But whatever might be the opinion of Tom  the plump little cottager kept to his own and  only more sadly repeated the words Poor ittle  birds knocked off tree   Oh I if youVe such a fancy for swinging on  a tree weUl have you up directly and make an   ittle bird of you I and laughing at the strug  gles and entreaties of the child Tom suddenly  lifted him over the hedge and followed him into  the field fiinging the wretched dead birds into a  ditch  In Tain Johnny kicked and pushed and roared  Tom was a remarkably tall and strong boy and  catching the poor child up in his arms he tan  with him across the field 1 There was another  hedge at the opposite side which Tom passed as  easily as he had done the first and they now  found themselves at the edge of a wood thickly  filled with trees of YArious sizes  It wad a delight to Tom to cause terror and  alarm no feeling of pity with him ever cut  short a joke In a few moments poor Johnny  was perched upon a branch clinging and roaring  with all his might   There ittle bird I hope that you like  your bough shall I shake it an ittle just to  give you a nice swing Hold tight mind you  dont fall or youll break your fiit neck as the  iitle birds did Then he began to sing   Hushaby baby on the treetop  When the wind blows the cradle will rook  When the bough breaks the cradle wiU U  Down comes poor baby cradle and all  How long Tom might have gone on torment  ing the child no one can tell if suddenly he had  not been struck by the appearance of a curious  bee which had sJighted for a moment upon a  wildflower near   Oh what a splendid bee f he cried leaving  hold of the branch to which Johnny still clung   Sit you there till I catch it isnt it a beauty   I never saw such fine purple wings I  My reader has probably guessed that it was  poor Violetta whose fatal beauty had attracted  his eye Johnny and his terrors all were for  gotten while Tom rushed forward in eager  pursuit the frightened child stopping his cry  ing to watch the chase which ended in Toms  securing his prize in his handkerchief  Impatient to carry it at once to a safe place  aaid of its either escaping or being crushed in  his hold Tom whose cottage was so near that  he could reach it in a few minutes sprang over  the hedge and ran fast across the field Thus  Johnny was left in a position of some peril not  knowing how long the boys absence might be  he shouted as loudly and as vainly after Tom as  he befoie had done after his sister   And did you not return soon cried Min  nie as Tom reached this part of his story   How could II Mother sent me off directly  for the doctor   Oh why why did you not tell her   Yeiy likely indeed that I should tell her  that I had left little Johnny sticking in a tree  I could only hope that he would stick there  until I could get back I returned at full speed  from the doctors I can assure you but when I  reached the wood not a trace of the little fellow  could I find   Oh Tom exclaimed Minnie with a look  of horror such a terrible thought has strack  me   I daresay that it has struck me before  gloomily replied her brother  « Was it Oh was it fer from the wellT   If hes there said Tom in a hollow voice   hes dead long before now   Did you seareh there 1   I looked down and saw nothing   Looked down Oh Tom this is worse than  mockery If the waters were above him it is  so deep so dark   What is to be done exclaimed the boy   Some one must go down in the bucket  Oh there is not a moment to be lost Minnie  would have rushed from the cottage but her  brother held her fast   There is no use in rousing the village now  he cried do you mean to ruin to destroy  me Minnie if you betray me if it is found  that the child is drowned people will say that   that and his look of terror told a great deal  more lian his words   But you never threw him in it was only  foolish play   Who can prove that Oh Minnie would  you bring me to a jail or perhaps to worse f   Then let us go ourselv exclaimed the  little girl divided between anxiety for her  bityther and fears for the lost child I must  either go or send and if there is danger to  you   We will go do anythiiig only in pity be  silent Minnie Minnie you cannot tell how  miserable I am 1  Without pausing another moment both ran  out of the cottage only fearful lest they should  be seen and detained Tom helped Minnie over  the low hedge but she hardly needed help so  eager was she to reach the weU The rosetint  of sunset had now given place to evenings grey   the dew was falling dark clouds gathered over  the sky but heeding nothing pausing for no  thing the Wingfields pressed on and were soon  standing by the sid of the welL  CHAPTER XI  A SUDDEN FALL   What has become of these two children of  mine said Mrs Wincfield fretfully as on her  return from her neigh Ws she fod the cot  tae empty Tm sure such a day of bustle as  I have had scarce out of one trouble before I  am into another WeU poor Mrs Bright is  still worse off that is one thing I am glad  that the baby has at last dropped asleep  It grew darker and darker Mrs Wingfield  became uneasy She stirred the fire filled the  kettle then with a long weary sigh sat down to  rest she missed Minnie and her quiet atten  tions   I suppose that they are still out searching  for little Johnny I fear that there will be rain   I wish that they were back Mrs Wingfield  fancied that she heard a low knock at the door   Come in she said but no one entered  Mrs Wingfield drew her chair nearer to the fire  leaned her head upon her hand and wished that  Tom and Minnie would not stay out so late  Again the same low knock she called out  louder Come in and the faint light which  came through the doorway was darkened by a  figure which seemed to linger as if in tear on  the threshold Then the voice of poor Polly was  heard Oh Mrs Wingfield can you tell me  how baby is   What Polly is that you Come in my  poor child all cold and wet with the dew  Why dont you go home   I dare not said Polly bursting into tears   mother forbade m till Johnny is found Oh  tell me how baby is is he better will he liveT  she could hardly speak through her sobs   Yes he is better that is to say he is  asleep   Not deadr exclaimed Polly alarmed at  the word  Dead no child why how you tremble  Come to the fire 111 get you a little tea and  toast   I could not eat it would choke me Oh  that I had never lefib the children that I had  done my duty as Minnie would have done She  she has been a comfort in her home but I   Come come said Mrs Wingfield in a  soothing tone dont go breaking your heart in  this way all may come right at last Would not  you like to see the baby   Oh if I might only sit up with him all  night But I may not return without Johnny   Your mother never meant that come 111  take you to her myself when she sees how you  feel all this I am sure that she will forgive  you   Mrs Wingfield was a kindhearted woman  and taking Pollys trembling hand within her  own she crossed over the lane to Mrs Brights  Polly shrank back as they reached the door   Oh say do you bring me news of my  child cried the poor anxious woman from  within   Not of Johnny yet still of your child Therp  is one here who is aaid to oome in poor things  she has almost cried herself to death   Polly 1 murmnred the mother and stretched  out her arms in another moment the poor girl  was gobbing upon her bosom  Amidst the troubles of our human Mends we  must not quite forget those of our little winged  ones The frightened hungry bees confined in  their small prison passed the long hours in most  uncomfortable plight   What a bitter thing it is cried Violetta  sinking exhausted after a last effort to gnaw  through the unyielding crockery to think of  aU the joy and happiness left in the world from  which we are shut out for ever Tomorrow the  ark will be rising on high the butterfly flitting  over the daisied meadow your comrades feast  ing in the dewy flowers all Nature one hum of  lifel   I am glad that they can enjoy still there is  some comfort in that said Silverwing   That is a feeling which I cannot under  stand observed Yioletta It is strange that  the very same thought should give pain to me  and pleasure to you 1  Yioletta had had no great experience of life  or she would have known that such is often the  case Living by herself as a solitaxy insect she  had never heard one of the mottoes cf Beeland  Ffom the Mosaom of a cormradea success one  draws the poison of etwy wnother the howsy of  ddight  The village churchclock had struck tiie hour  of nine it was seldom that its sound could be  heard in ie cottage of Mrs Wingfield but now  the place was so still that the breeze bore it dis  tinctly to her listening ear Weary she lay oti  her bed unwilling to sleep till her children  should return The rain was beginning to fall  without the heavy douds bending towards  earthy made the nht much darker than is usual  in summ Presently a sound was heard at  the door   Minnie is that youT cried the mother   It is Polly answered a moumfiil voice as  the little girl entered the cottage   Is the baby worse J asked Mrs Wing  field   1 hope not but mother is in such a state  about Johnny if it were not for baby she  would be wandering all night in the rain I  come to ask if you could kindly give her a little  hartshorn I know that that is what you take  when you are poorly   You are heartily welcome to what I have  replied the cottager I daresay that you can  find it yourself I need not rise Snuff the  long wick of the candle and there dont put it  in the draught mind you dont snuff it out  why how your poor fingers tremble T  How changed was Polly since the mopmings  sun had risen Her cheeks pale and hazard  her eyes swollen with weeping her dress hang  ing damp around her chill form who would  have guessed that she ever could have been the  gayest girl in the village   You will find the bottle on the shelf you  can reach it with a chair continued Mrs Wing  field raising herself on one arm to wtoh the  proceedings of the girL There do you not see  just behind that mug Why what hare you  done she cried in a tone of impatience as  something came crashing upon the floor  What had she done indeed She had thrown  down Toms mug and set two little prisoners  free Yes they were firee free as the air which  they now joyously beat with their little wings  Uttering a loud hum of delight they flew round  the cottage darted to the door then drew back  afraid of the damp and at last both settled  sociably under the table to enjoy together a  nice crumb of sugar that Tom had dropped on  the floor  Oh if liberty be so sweet so precious to all  who would deprive even an insect of its birth  right Let them spread the ee wing uncon  fined and happy and let us find our pleasure  raiher in seeing them in the position for which  Providence formed and designed them than in  keeping them as captives the slaves to our will  deprived of their lifes dearest blessing  CHAPTER XII  AN UNPLEASANT JOTJRNET  MiKNiE and her brother stood at the brink of  the well and gazed with straining eyes into its  depths   Which of ns should go downl said Minnie   You need not have asked such a question  you know that you are not strong enough to  draw me up and I doubt added Tom passing  his hand along the rope I doubt that this is  strong enough to bear me  I Minnie drew one step backwards if it  should break with me she murmured   You should have thought of that before  was Toms only reply  Tom at all risks I must go I could not  sleep tonight with this horrible doubt on my  mind and you will not let me call others to  help I trust that the Almighty will take care  of mej for my only hope is in Him Help me  to get into the bucket and oh be very careful  dear Tom jou do not know how much fright  ened I am   Hold the rope firmly said her brother   and heie take this long stick to feel about in  the water when you are down Tom was ex  tremely anxious to have his own mind relieved  or heartless as he was he could hardly have  consented to let his young sister run this risk  ut there was nothing that the selfish boy  dreaded so much as that his share in Johnnys  wanderings should be known if his fearful suspi  cion were true and the poor child had indeed  perished through his folly  Minnie shook with terror as the bucket began  to descend every moment she fimcied the rope  giving way and that she should be plunged into  the water below The strange damp smell the  dim light the peculiar sound of her own voice in  that hollow confined place all added to her feel  ing of fear   Stop Tom she cried as the bucket touched  the water Tom looked down and could perceive  some one below but all indistinct and dim he  could not have recognised that it was his sister  Can you find anything 1 he whispered  kneeling down after fixing the wheel and lean  S over with his hands resting on the brink  He heard a little splashing in the water and  waited for the answer of Minnie with great  anxiety Can you find anything there 1 he  repeated  No Oh the relief brought by that one  little word   Have you searched welll said Tom have  you searched to ihe bottom   Quite to the bottom there is nothing but  water Seaven be praised said the hollow voice  from below Now draw me up again but  softly very softly Oh how thankful I shall be  if I ever reach the top f  There was not another word spoken by ther  brother or sister while Tom with painful exer  tion turned the handle of the wheel and first  Minnies clinging hands and then her frightened  face appeared above the level of the well  Tom helped her to the side which she could  not have reached by herself and then falling on  her knees the poor little girl returned her fervent  thanks to Heaven at once for Johnnys deliver  ance from the well and her own   Now let us return said Tom there is no  use in remaining here it is growing quite dark  and beginning to rain we can continue our  search in the morning   But if poor little Johnny should be some  where in this wood only think what he would  suffer left out all night it would kill him with  fright if not with the weather 1 Bememb  Tom that no one else is likely to have looked  for him here a place which he could never haVe  reached by himself  Tom muttered something between his teeth  which perhaps it was as well that Minnie did  not hear but he certainly looked around him  more carefully  Minnie had wandered a few steps from her  brother and was slowly walking round the green  sward surrounding the well a clear space whieh  was almost enclosed by the wood only open on  the side by which they had approached it and  from which two dark narrow paths scarce wide  enough to permit two persons to pass each other  led into the depths o£ the forest On a sudden  she stopped stooped down then eagerly cried  out Oh look what I have here he must be  near he must be near Tom hastened to the  spot and beheld in Minnies hand a little dusty  shoe with its strap and round black button  which both felt certain had belonged to the lost  child   Well he could not walk fax withdut his  shoe observed Tom I daresay that he is  near enough to hear me HaUoo Johnny T he  shouted halloo there was no reply but the echo   He must have gone down one of those little  paths said Minnie we had better search one  of them at once   Better search both of them as thore are two  of ua said Tom if we took but on«b we should  be sure to choose the wrong one  Poor Minnie gave a woful look at the dark  walks however tempting they might have looked  when nuts were on the boughs and the sun  beams struggled through their green shade to  the eye of the little girl they looked anything  but tempting now when approaching night was  wrapping them in deepest gloouL   Why you are not afraid cried Tom with  his rude coarse laugh for now that he was  relieved from his fear that the child was actually  dead the thought of what he might be suffering  weighed little upon his mind   If it is right for me to go alone I will go  faltered Minnie whether I am afraid or not  Tom laughed again but he had Httle cause to  laugh at words that expressed more true courage  than all the idle vaunts that he had ever uttered  He might have remembered that his sister had  just ventured upon what an older and wiser  companion than hiipself would never have suf  fered her to have attempted But having no  fear of a night walk in a lonely wood himself he  now as was ever the case with him had no oon  siderataon for the feelings of another  The brother and sister parted in the darkness  and rain Minnie trembling half with fear  half witli cold weixt eaatiouslj alcmg the gloomy  way Erery few steps she paused and softly  called Johnny T but her listening ear caught  no sound but the pattering of the rain Many  many times she stopped and almost resolved to  go back when the thought of her little rosy  cheeked friend out in the darkness and rain  frightened cold and wet encouraged her to  pursue her journey For more than an hour the  young girl wandered on when at last the wood  came to an end and she found herself alone on a  dark wide heath dotted over here and there by  furze bushes   Johnny once more ahe cried almost in  despair a sickening feeling of disappointment  coming oyer her heart Weary and sad she  could have sat down and cried She saw a little  on her left hand one lonely light which ap  peared to proceed from some cottage Here at  least she might beg for shelter and towards it  she slowly walked The light shone steady and  bright from a little window and before she  ventured to knodk at the door Minnie Wingfield  cautiously peeped in  An aged man sat with his back to the window  and a laige book open on the table before him  the very sight of which gave hope and confidence  to Minnie TTi« wife in her armchair was  listening opposite a mild calm expression on  her venenble fiioe and in the comer orouched  poor silly Saliyy ker brow no longer bound with  her cbaplet of wild flowers she had wreathed it  round the lost Johnny whom with a delight  which repaid all her fears Minnie beheld nluoi  bering in the arms of the idiot  It was this poor helpless creature who had  found the little boy clinging in terror to the  bough There was still a womans instinct left  in her breaat an instinct of tenderness towards a  child Terrified at first to behold the dreaded  Satty it was only the necessity of his case that  made poor Johnny suffer her to touch him but  kindness soon finds its way to the heart she  fondled him stroked his curly locks decked him  out with her Betvourite flowers and then carried  him away through the still greenwood to her  own little home on the common pleeaed as a  child that has found a new toy Strange that  the life whidi had been endangered by the  thoughtlessness of a eoinpanion should be guarded  by the tenderness of one bereft of reason  Minnie Wingfield soon dtered the cottage  and was received with Christian hoEitality  She was placed by the fire her dress dried and  food placed before her and her mind was re  lieved by hearing that a messenger had been  sent to her village to bear tiding» to Mrs Bright  that her Johnny was safe and under shelter  What a joyful end to all Minnies anxieties  how sweet the reward of all the painftd efforts  that she had made i  CHAPTER XIII  WUrOS AND STINGS  It is now time that I should draw my tale to a  dose but as my reader may like to know what  became of the little people with wings and  without wings that we have followed through  this story I shaU gire a few more pages to an  account of their fate  The first sunbeam which shone the next morn  ing upon the hive glittered on Silverwing as  with joyous speed she hastened back to her  home She continued there her busy and her  happy life finding sweetness everywhere honey  in each flower and cheering the less joyous  existence of Sipeyrup whose wing never quite  recovered its power As the injured bee was  unable to fly out with the next swamii her  friend remained behind to bear her company  they passed the summer days in active employ  and the winter in plenty and reposel  I have a less pleasing aoooimt to give of  Waxywill who was certainly a most wayward  bee She chose to go out honeynsieeking one day  when required for work in the hive she re  solved contrary to orders to visit the dwelling  of a humblebee and because she knew that her  cousins of that race live underground against  the warnings of her companions she entered a  little hole in a bank and found herself in the  midst of a nest of wasps Her melancholy fate  may easily be imagined she died beneath the  Btings of her enemies  But perhaps you are more desirous to hear  what befel our heroes and heroines of the human  race  Let my reader then fancy himself again be  neath the little porch which adorns the front f  Mrs Wingfields cottage It is now later in the  year the finest flowers in the garden have faded  one or two sunflowers and a few dahlias look  gay still j but the fresh feel of the morning air  the white tinge on the grass and the heavy dew  which has strung Spinaways web with number  less tiny beads show tjiat the autumn is now  advanced Beneath the porch sits Minnie busy  as usual with her work before the hour for going  to school Tom is near her engaged in stringing  iiogether little eggshells collected in the spring  pretty enough in themselves but won at the  expense of much misery to the poor birds whone  nests he had robbed  Who approftdies from the opposite side of the  lane bearing a baby carefully wrapped up in her  anus You will soaroelj recognise poor Polly  once so fond of finexy and folly How much  nicer she looks in her present quiet dress with  her gentle subdued look and kindly air  Then the baby did live Tes he did live a  poor sickly delicate child But oh the tender  ness with which he has been watched by Polly  who now seems to think that she can never do  enough for her brothers She appears to have  tlirown away her vanity with her diamond  brooch or rather she has thoroughly learned  the painful lesson taught through that terrible  evening and night The resolutions that she  then made she has not forgotten the prayers  which she then uttered were from the heart  and there is not in the whole village to be found  a more sober modest quietlydressed girl always  placing her duties before her pleasures than the  once vain selfish Polly Bright  She now drew near carrying the baby with  little Johnny trotting after her his cheeks just  as rosy and his figure as round as before his  adventure in the woods It had left on his  mind a great affection for Minnie who had al  ways been a favourite with the child and he  now ran up to his friend with an apple in his  hand as round and as rosy as himself   Minnie Wings said the little boy holding it  up to her lips Minnie Wings you take bit  Minnie smilingly accepted the proffered kind  ness of the child after stooping down to kiss his  rosy face   Oome here you little rogue said Tom in a  tone halfsurly and halfgood humoured tell  me why you call her Minnie Wings instead of  Wingfieldr   Cause said Johnny with dimpling cheeks   she fly to help me   So did I observed Tom so I suppose that  I am Wings too  Johnny fixed his round eyes full upon his  neighbour and slowly retreating backwards as if  rather afraid replied No you Tommy Stiugs  Tommy would have been angry at the speech  if he could have helped laughing at it but the  manner and look of the child halfresolute half  frightened were so irresistibly comic that Tom  my 3tings put the best face upon the matter  and appeared goodhumoured for once in his life  He was certainly in a mood more amiable than  usual having that morning been engaged to go  as an errand boy in a neighbouring town where  under the eye of a strict master we may hope  that his conduct may improve and that he may  cease to deserve the title bestowed upon him by  little Johnny   I have oome to give you good news dear  Minnie said Pollj after joining in the laugh  which her little brother had occasioned j we  have had a letter from the Crimea and my dear  father is welL   I am so glad of thatT cried Minnie who  was ever ready to rejoice with the rejoicing   And jou looked so bright when I first saw  you said Polly that I suspect that you have  some good news of your own to give me in  return   You are quite right I have famous news  dear Folly The squires lady was here late last  evening you know how kind she is She wants  to place her babys fosterbrother in some cottage  near her and to my joy has fixed upon ours   And will she pay wellT   Oh more than we could have ventured to  hope We really shall now be quite comfort   able I My mother is so much pleased I do not  think that I have seen her so well or so cheerful  ever since our great troubles last year How  good Gkd has been to us added the little girl  her eyes glistening with bright tears of gratitude  and pleasure He has always raised up friends  for us in our need   Yes Minnie and you who are a Mend to all  who require one are never likely to be in want  of a friend   I shall so enjoy having a dear little child to  look after I am sure that it will be a pleasure  rather than a trouble   It is easy to guess said Polly with a good  natured smiley why the lady chose your cottage  for the home of the baby  Johnny after two or three vain attempts had  succeeded in clambering up the bench on which  Minnie was seated She now felt his little arms  pressed round her neck as he drew her down to  wards him to whisper close in her ear Every  body happy with my Minnie Wings I  And now nothing remains but that A L O E  should bid her young readers farewelL If they  have liked her little book let them remember  that her story is but as the comb which may  be pleasant to the eye but that its moral is  the honey which is treasured within However  young however weak dear children you may be  know that the youngest the weakest have some  power here to give either pleasure or pain A  generous spirit shrinks from inflicting suffering  on the smallest insect or the feeblest worm and  I trust that no reader of my little tale will hesi  tate which part to take for his own or leave it  doubtful whether he ought to be classed under  the title of Wings or StingsÆSOP,

THE DOG AND THE WOLF.


A wolf there was, whose scanty fare
Had made his person lean and spare;
A dog there was, so amply fed,
His sides were plump and sleek; 'tis said
The wolf once met this prosp'rous cur,
And thus began: "Your servant, sir;
I'm pleased to see you look so well,
Though how it is I cannot tell;
I have not broke my fast to-day;
Nor have I, I'm concern'd to say,
One bone in store or expectation,
And that I call a great vexation."

"Indeed it is," the dog replied:
"I know no ill so great beside;
But if you do not like to be
So poorly fed, come live with me."
"Agreed," rejoined the wolf, "I'll go:
But pray, what work am I to do?"
"Oh, guard the house, and do not fail
To bark at thieves, and wag your tail."

So off they jogg'd, and soon arrived
At where the friendly mastiff lived.
"Well," said the wolf, "I can't deny
You have a better house than I."
"Not so," the other then replied,
"If you with me will hence abide."
"Oh," said the wolf, "how kind you are!
But what d'ye call _that_, hanging there?
Is it an iron chain, or what?"
"Friend," said the dog, "I quite forgot
To mention that; sometimes, you see,
They hook that little chain to _me_;
But it is only meant to keep
Us dogs from walking in our sleep,
And should you wear it, you would find,
It's nothing that you need to mind."

"I'll take your word," the wolf replied.
"It's truth by me shall ne'er be tried;
I'll have my liberty again,
And you your collar and your chain."


MORAL.

Our neighbors sometimes seem to be
A vast deal better off than we;
Yet seldom 'tis they really are,
Since _they_ have troubles too to bear,
Which, if the truth were really known,
Are quite as grievous as our own.

THE HERDSMAN.


A herdsman, who lived at a time and a place
Which, should you not know, is but little disgrace,
Discover'd one morning, on counting his stock,
That a sheep had been stolen that night from the flock.

"Oh, I wish I had caught ye, _whoever ye be_
I'd have soon let you know, I'd have soon let ye see,
What he had to expect," said the herdsman, "I trow;
But I've thought of a scheme that will trouble you now."

So what did he do, sir, but put up a board,
Describing the thief, and proposed a reward
Of a lamb, to the man who would give information
Concerning the thief, and his true designation.

The project succeeded; for soon there applied
A certain near neighbor, with others beside.
"But tell me the thief," said the herdsman, "at least;"
"Come hither," said they, "and we'll show you the beast!"

"The _beast_!" said the rustic, who thought he should die on
The spot, when he found that the thief was a lion!
"Ill luck to my hurry, what now shall I do?
I promised a lamb to detect you 'tis true;
But now I'd consent _all_ my substance to pay,
If I could but with safety get out of your way."


MORAL.

Silly people ask things that would ruin, if sent;
They demand them in haste, and at leisure repent.

THE BOYS AND THE FROGS.


Some boys, beside a pond or lake,
Were playing once at _duck and drake?_
When, doubtless to their heart's content,
Volleys of stones were quickly sent.

But there were some (there will be such)
Who did not seem amused so much;
These were the frogs, to whom the game,
In point of sport was not the same.

For scarce a stone arrived, 'tis said,
But gave some frog a broken head;
And scores in less than half an hour,
Perished beneath the dreadful shower.

At last, said one, "You silly folks, I say,
Do fling your stones another way;
Though _sport_ to _you_, to throw them thus,
Remember, pray, 'tis _death_ to us!"


MORAL.

From hence this moral may be learn'd:
Let play _be play_ to _all concern'd_.

THE COCK AND THE JEWEL.


A cock there was: a sage was he
  (If Esop we may trust,)
Who wish'd to make a meal, you see,
  As other sages must.

With this intent, as heretofore,
  When on the hunt for grain;
Our hero scratch'd the litter o'er
  With all his might and main.

But scarce a minute had he scratch'd,
  When, to his great surprise,
A gem, with golden chain attach'd,
  He saw with both his eyes.

"Alack!" quoth he, "what have we here?
  A diamond, I protest!
Which lords and ladies buy so dear,
  And hold in such request.

"But one good barley-corn to me
  Has more intrinsic worth
Than all the pearls now in the sea,
  Or gold now in the earth."


MORAL.

The moral here, in Esop's mind,
  Was this, there's not a doubt:
Things have _most_ value, which we find
  We _cannot_ do without.

THE MAN AND THE LION.


A man and a lion once had a dispute,
Which was reckon'd the greatest, the man or the brute;
The lion discoursed on his side at some length,
And greatly enlarged on his courage and strength.

The man, one would think, had enough to reply
On _his_ side the question, which none could deny;
But like many others who make a pretence,
He talk'd perfect nonsense, and thought it good sense.

"So," says he, "don't be prating,--look yonder, I pray,
At that sculpture of marble, now what will you say?
The lion is vanquished; but as for the man
He is striding upon him; deny it who can."

"But pray," said the lion, "who sculptured that stone?"
"One of _us_," said the man, "I must candidly own."
"But when _we_ are sculptors," the other replied,
"You will then on the man see the _lion_ astride."


MORAL.

The man might have added, if he had been wise,
"But a beast _cannot_ sculpture a stone, _if he tries_."
_That_ sufficiently shows where the difference lies.

THE FOX AND THE CRANE.


"I certainly think," said a fox to a crane,
"That face, ma'am of yours is remarkably plain;
That beak that you wear is so frightful a feature,
It makes you appear a most singular creature."
The crane, much offended at what she had heard,
March'd off at full speed, without saying a word:
"Oh dear!" said the fox, "Mrs. Crane, I protest
You misunderstand me, 'twas only a jest."
"Come, don't be affronted--stay with me and dine;
You know very well 'tis this temper of mine
To say such odd things to my intimate friends;
But you know that poor Reynard no mischief intends."
So the crane thought it best not to break with him quite,
But to view his remarks in a good-natured light.
So she put on as pleasant a face as she could
When he ask'd her to dine, and replied that she would.
But alas! she perceived that his jokes were not over,
When Reynard removed from the victuals its cover
'Twas neither game, butcher's meat, chicken, not fish;
But plain gravy-soup, in a broad shallow dish.
Now this the fox lapp'd with his tongue very quick,
While the crane could scarce dip in the point of her beak;
"You make a poor dinner," said he to his guest;
"Oh, dear! by no means," said the bird, "I protest."
But the crane ask'd the fox on a subsequent day,
When nothing, it seems, for their dinner had they
But some minced meat served up in a narrow-neck'd jar;
Too long, and narrow, for Reynard by far.
"You make a poor dinner, I fear," said the bird;
"Why, I think," said the fox, "'twould be very absurd
To deny what you say, yet I cannot complain,
But confess, though a fox, that I'm matched by a crane."


MORAL.

Cunning folks who play tricks which good manners condemn,
Often find their own tricks play'd again upon them.

THE TRAVELLER AND THE SATYR.


A luckless wight, in winter slow,
Travelling once a forest through
Cold and hungry, tired and wet,
Began in words like these to fret:
"Oh, what a sharp inclement day!
And what a dismal, dreary way!
No friendly cot, no cheering fields,
No food this howling forest yields;
I've nought in store or expectation!
There's nought before me but starvation."

"Not quite so bad," a voice replied;
Quickly the traveller turned aside,
And saw the satyr of the wood,
Who close beside his dwelling stood.
"Here is my cave hard by," said he,
"Walk in, you're welcome, pray be free."

The traveller did not hesitate,
Hoping for something good to eat,
But follow'd to his heart's content,
Blowing his finger as he went.

"Pray," said the satyr, "may I know
For what you blow your fingers so?"

"What! need you," said the man, "be told?--
To _warm_ my fingers, 'numb'd with cold."

"Indeed!" was all his host replied,
Intent some pottage to provide,
Which heated well, with spice infused,
Was to his shivering guest produced:

So hot it was, as Esop sung,
It made our traveller scald his tongue;
And wishing not again to do it,
Our hero could not wait, but blew it.

"What?" said his host, in accent rough,
"Is not your pottage hot enough?"
"Yes," said the man, "full well I know it,
'Tis far too hot, that's why I blow it."
"You artful villain! do you so?"
His host replied, with angry brow;
"My cave shall not a moment hold
A man that blows both hot and cold!
By none but rogues can that be done,
You double-dealing wretch, begone!"


MORAL.

The traveller scarce deserved such wrath,
For warming fingers--cooling broth.
No statutes old or new forbid it,
Although with the same mouth he did it:
Yet this beware of old and young,
What Esop meant--a _double tongue_;
Which flatters now with civil clack,
And slanders soon behind one's back.




[Illustration]

THE TRAVELLERS AND THE PURSE.


Two friends once were walking in sociable chat,
  When a purse one espied on the ground;
"Oh, see!" said he, (thank my fortune for that,)
  "What a large sum of money I've found!"

"Nay, do not say _I_" said his friend, "for you know
  'Tis but friendship to share it with me;"
"I share it with you," said the other. "How so?
  He who _found_ it the owner should be."

"Be it so," said his friend, "but what sound do I hear?
  'Stop thief!' one is calling to you;
He comes with a constable close in the rear!"
  Said the other, "Oh, what shall we do?"

"Nay, do not say _we_," said his friend, "for you know
  You claimed the sole right to the prize!
And since all the _money_ was taken by you,
  With you the _dishonesty_ lies."


MORAL.

When people are selfish, dishonest, and mean,
Their nature, in dealing, will quickly be seen.




[Illustration]

THE MOUTH AND THE LIMBS.

In days of yore, they say, 'twas then
  When all things spoke their mind;
The arms and legs of certain men,
  To treason felt inclined.

These arms and legs together met,
  As snugly as they could,
With knees and elbows, hands and feet,
  In discontented mood.

Said they, "'Tis neither right nor fair,
  Nor is there any need,
To labor with such toil and care,
  The greedy mouth to feed."

"This we're resolved no more to do,
  Though we so long have done it;"
"Ah!" said the knees and elbows too,
  "And we are bent upon it."

"I," said the tongue, "may surely speak,
  Since I his inmate am;
And for his vices while you seek,
  His virtues I'll proclaim.

"You say the mouth embezzles all,
  The fruit of your exertion;
But I on this assembly call
  To prove the base assertion.

"The food which you with labor gain,
  He too with labor chews;
Nor does he long the food retain,
  But gives it for your use.

"But he his office has resign'd
  To whom you may prefer;
He begs you therefore now to find
  Some other treasurer."

"Well, be it so," they all replied;
  "His wish shall be obeyed;
We think the hands may now be tried
  As treasurers in his stead."

The hands with joy to this agreed,
  And all to them was paid;
But they the treasure kept indeed,
  And no disbursements made.

Once more the clam'rous members met,
  A lean and hungry throng;
When all allowed, from head to feet,
  That what they'd done was wrong.

To take his office once again,
  The mouth they all implored;
Who soon accepted it, and then
  Health was again restored.


MORAL.

This tale for state affairs is meant,
  Which we need not discuss;
At present we will be content,
  To find a moral thus:

The mouth has claims of large amount,
  From arms, legs, feet, and hands;
But let them not, on that account,
 Pay _more_ than it demands.

THE HARE AND THE TORTOISE.


Said a hare to a tortoise, "Good sir, what a while
  You have been only crossing the way;
Why I really believe that to go half a mile,
  You must travel two nights and a day."

"I am very contented," the creature replied,
  "Though I walk but a tortoise's pace,
But if you think proper the point to decide,
  We will run half a mile in a race."

"Very good," said the hare; said the tortoise, "Proceed,
  And the fox shall decide who has won,"
Then the hare started off with incredible speed;
  But the tortoise walk'd leisurely on.

"Come tortoise, friend tortoise, walk on," said the hare,
  "Well, I shall stay here for my dinner;
Why, 'twill take you a month, at that rate, to get there,
  Then how can you hope to be winner?"

But the tortoise could hear not a word that she said
  For he was far distant behind;
So the hare felt secured while at leisure she fed,
  And took a sound nap when she dined.

So at last this slow walker came up with the hare,
  And there fast asleep did he spy her;
And he cunningly crept with such caution and care,
  That she woke not, although he pass'd by her.

"Well now," thought the hare, when she open'd her eyes,
  "For the race,--and I soon shall have done it;"
But who can describe her chagrin and surprise,
  When she found that the _tortoise_ had won it!


MORAL.

Thus plain plodding people, we often shall find,
Will leave hasty confident people behind.

THE MILKMAID.


A milkmaid, who poized a full pail on her head,
Thus mused on her prospects in life, it is said:
"Let's see--I should think that this milk will procure
One hundred good eggs, or fourscore to be sure.

"Well then--stop a bit,--it must not be forgotten,
Some of these may be broken, and some may be rotten;
But if twenty for accidents should be detach'd,
It will leave me just sixty sound eggs to hatch'd.

"Well, sixty sound eggs--no; sound chickens, I mean;
Of these some may die--we'll suppose seventeen--
Seventeen!--not so many--say ten at the most,
Which will leave fifty chickens to boil or to roast.

"But then there's their barley; how much will they need?
Why they take but one grain at a time when they feed,
So that's a mere trifle; now then let us see,
At a fair market price, how much money there'll be?

"Six shillings a pair--five--four--three-and-six,
To prevent all mistakes, that low price I will fix;
Now what will that make? fifty chickens, I said,
Fifty times three-and-sixpence--_I'll ask brother Ned_.

"Oh! but stop--three-and-sixpence a _pair_ I must sell 'em;
Well, a pair is a couple--now then let us tell 'em;
A couple in fifty will go--(my poor brain!)
Why just a score times, and five pair will remain.

"Twenty-five pair of fowls--now how shameful it is,
That I can't reckon up as much money as this!
Well, there's no use in trying; so let's give a guess;
I will say twenty pounds, and _it can't be no less_.

"Twenty pounds, I am certain, will buy me a cow,
Thirty geese, and two turkeys--eight pigs and a sow;
Now if these turn out well, at the end of the year,
I shall fill both my pockets with guineas 'tis clear.

"Then I'll bid that old tumble-down hovel good-bye;
My mother she'll scold, and my sisters they'll cry:
But I won't care a crow's egg for all they can say;
I sha'n't go to stop with such beggars as they!"

But forgetting her burden, when this she had said,
The maid superciliously toss'd up her head
When alas! for her prospects--the milk pail descended!
And so all her schemes for the future were ended.


MORAL.

This moral, I think, may be safely attach'd:
Reckon not on your chickens before they are hatch'd.

THE LARK AND HER YOUNG ONES.


A lark who had her nest conceal'd,
Says Esop, in a barley field;
Began, as harvest time drew near,
The reaping of the corn to fear;
Afraid they would her nest descry,
Before her tender brood could fly.
She charged them therefore every day,
Before for food she flew away,
To watch the farmer in her stead,
And listen well to all he said.

It chanced one day, she scarce was gone,
Ere the farmer came and his son.
The farmer well his field survey'd,
And sundry observations made;
At last, "I'll tell you what," said he,
"This corn is fit to cut, I see;
But we our neighbor's help must borrow,
So tell them we begin to-morrow."

Just after this the lark returned,
When from her brood this news she learned.
"Ah! dearest mother," then, said they,
"Pray, let us all begone to-day."

"My dears," said she, "you need not fret,
I shall not be uneasy yet;
For if he waits for neighbor's aid,
The business long will be delay'd."

At dawn she left her nest once more,
And charged her young ones as before.

At five the farmer came again,
And waited for his friends in vain,
"Well," said the man, "I fancy, son,
These _friends_ we can't depend upon;
To-morrow early, mind you go,
And let our own _relations_ know."

Again the lark approach'd her nest,
When round her all her young ones press'd,
And told their mother, word for word,
The fresh intelligence they heard.

"Ah, children, be at ease," said she
"We're safe another day, I see;
For these _relations_, you will find,
Just like his _friends_, will stay behind."

At dawn again the lark withdrew,
And did again her charge renew.

Once more the farmer early came,
And found the case was just the same.
The day advanced, the sun was high;
But not a single help drew nigh.
Then said the farmer, "Hark ye, son--
I see this job will not be done,
While thus we wait for friends and neighbors;
So you and I'll commence our labors:
To-morrow early, we'll begin
_Ourselves_, and get our harvest in."

"Now," said the lark, when this she heard,
"Our movement must not be deferr'd;
For if the farmer and his son
Themselves begin, 'twill soon be done."

The morrow proved the lark was right;
For all was cut and housed by night.


MORAL.

Hence, while we wait for other's aid,
Our business needs must be delay'd;
Which might be done with half the labor
'Twould take to go and call a neighbor.

THE PHILOSOPHER AND THE
ACORN.


A philosopher, proud of his wit and his reason,
Sat him under an oak in a hot summer season.
On the oak grew an acorn or two, it is said:
On the ground grew a pumpkin as big as his head.

Thought the sage, "What's the reason this oak is so strong
A few acorns to bear that are scarce an inch long;
While this poor feeble plant has a weight to sustain,
Which had much better hang on the tree, it is plain?"

But just at the time the philosopher spoke
An acorn dropp'd down on his head from the oak;
Then, said he, who just now thought _his_ plan was so clever,
"I am glad that _this_ was not a pumpkin, however."


MORAL.

The sage would no doubt have looked grievously dull,
Had a pumpkin descended with force on his scull.
Of his folly then let us in future beware,
And believe that _such_ matters _are best as they are_:
Leave the manners and customs of oak trees alone,
Of acorns, and pumpkins--and look to our own.

THE WOLF AND THE CRANE.


A wolf, once forgetting the size of his swallow,
  Tried to pass a large marrow-bone through it.
"Oh dear," said the beast, thinking death was to follow,
  "How careless and stupid to do it!"

His mouth was propp'd open by means of the bone,
  And his breathing was greatly impeded,
But a crane coming up, he contrived to make known
  What kind of assistance he needed.

"How d'ye do?" said the bird; said the beast, "Very ill,
  For a bone has gone down the wrong way;
But if you can extract it by means of your bill,
  The service I'll amply repay."

Thought the crane, "I'm no surgeon: yet all must agree,
  That my bill will make excellent _forceps_;
And as for the money, I do not now see
  Why I need refuse taking his worship's."

Said the bird, "It's agreed;" said his patient, "Proceed,
  And take the bone hence, I beseech;"
Which, after awhile, and with infinite toil,
  The crane at last managed to reach.

"Thank my stars!" said the beast, from his terrors released,
  "Thank you _too_, sir," said he to the bird;
"Alas!" said the crane, "is this all I'm to gain,
  I was waiting the promised reward."

Said the wolf, "You forget, I've contracted no debt,
  Since the service was _rendered by me_;
Your head I releas'd from the jaws of a beast,
  And now you're demanding a fee!"


MORAL.

Give your help to a wolf, should he beg for your aid,
But you must not expect when you've done to be paid.

THE DOG AND THE SHADOW.


A dog growing thinner, for want of a dinner,
  Once purloined him a joint from a tray,
"How happy I am, with this shoulder of lamb,"
  Thought the cur as he trotted away.

But the way that he took, lay just over a brook,
  Which he found it was needful to cross;
So without more ado, he plunged in to go through,
  Not dreaming of danger or loss.

But what should appear, in this rivulet clear,
  As he thought upon coolest reflection,
But a cur like himself, who with ill-gotten pelf,
  Had run off in that very direction.

Thought the dog, _a propos_! but that instant let go
  (As he snatched at this same water-spaniel)
The piece he possess'd:--so with hunger distress'd
  He slowly walk'd home to his kennel.


MORAL.

Hence, when we are needy, don't let us be greedy,
  (Excuse me this line of digression,)
Lest in snatching at all, like the dog, we let fall
  The good that we have in possession.




[Illustration]

THE TRAVELLERS AND THE BEAR.


Two trav'llers one morning set out from their home,
It might be from Sparta, from Athens, or Rome;
It matters not which, but agreed, it is said,
Should danger arise, to lend each other aid.

But scarce was this done, when forth rushing amain,
Sprung a bear from a wood tow'rds these travellers twain;
Then one of our heroes, with courage immense,
Climb'd into a tree, and there found his defence.

The other fell flat to the earth with dread,
When the bear came and smelt him, and thought he was dead;
So not liking the carcase, away trotted he,
When straight our brave hero descended the tree.

Then, said he, "I can't think what the bear could propose,
When so close to your ear, he presented his nose."
"Why this," said the other, "he told me to do,
To beware for the future of cowards like you."


MORAL.

Those people who run from their friends in distress,
Will be left when _themselves_ are in trouble, I guess.




[Illustration]

THE FROGS AND THE BULL.


A Bull once treading near a bog,
Displaced the entrails of a frog,
  Who near his foot did trust them;
In fact, so great was the contusion,
And made of his inwards such confusion,
  No art could re-adjust them.

It chanced that some who saw his fate,
Did to a friend the deed relate,
  With croakings, groans, and hisses;
"The beast," said they, "in size excell'd
All other beasts," their neighbors swell'd,
  And ask'd, "as large as this is!"

"Oh, larger far than that," said they,
"Do not attempt it, madam, pray;"
  But still the frog distended,
And said, "I'll burst, but I'll exceed,"
She tried, and burst herself indeed!
  And so the matter ended.


MORAL.

Should you with pride inflate and swell,
As did the frog: then who can tell!
Your sides may crack, as has been shown,
And we with laughing crack our own.

THE COUNCIL OF MICE.


Some mice who saw fit, once a quarter to meet,
  To arrange the concerns of their city;
Thought it needful to choose, as is common with us,
  First a chairman, and then a committee.

When the chairman was seated, the object he stated
  For which at that meeting they sat:
Which was, it should seem, the concerting a scheme
  To defeat the designs of the cat.

Dr. Nibblecheese rose, and said, "I would propose,
  To this cat we fasten a bell;
He who likes what I've said, now will hold up his head;
  He who does not, may hold up his tail."

So out of respect, they their noses erect,
  Except one who the order reversed;
_Ayes_, all then but one, but yet nought could be done,
  Until he had his reasons rehearsed.

"I shall not," said this mouse, "waste the time of the house,
  In long arguments; since, as I view it,
The scheme would succeed without doubt, if indeed
  We could find any mouse who would _do it_."

"Hear! hear!" was the cry, and "no bells we will try,
  Unless you will fasten them on;"
So quite broken-hearted the members departed,
  For the bill was rejected _nem. con._


MORAL.

Then be not too hasty in giving advice,
Lest your schemes should remind of the council of mice;
You had better delay your opinion a year,
Than put forth a ridiculous one, it is clear.

THE WOLF AND THE LAMB.


A wolf and lamb once chanced to meet,
Beside a stream, whose waters sweet
Brought various kinds of beasts together,
When dry and sultry was the weather;
Now though the wolf came there to _drink_,
Of _eating_, he began to think,
As soon as near the lamb he came,
And straight resolved to kill the same;
Yet thought it better to begin,
With threat'ning words and angry mien.

"And so," said he, to him below,
"How dare you stir the water so?
Making the cool refreshing flood,
As brown as beer, and thick as mud."

"Sir," said the lamb, "that cannot be,
The water flows _from you to me_;
So, 'tis impossible, I think,
That what I do can spoil your drink."

"I say it does, you saucy puss:
How dare you contradict me thus;
But more than this, you idle clack,
You rail'd at me behind my back
Two years ago, I have been told;"
"How so? I'm not a twelvemonth old,"
The lamb replied; "So I suspect
Your honor is not quite correct."

"If not, your mother it must be,
And that comes all the same to me,"
Rejoined the wolf--who waited not
But kill'd and ate him on the spot.


MORAL.

Some, like the wolf, adopt the plan,
To make a quarrel _if they can_;
But none with you can hold dispute,
If you're _determined_ to be mute;
For sure this proverb must be true,
That ev'ry _quarrel_ must have _two_.

THE BEASTS IN PARTNERSHIP.


This _firm_ once existed, I'd have you to know,
Messrs. Lion, Wolf, Tiger, Fox, Leopard, and Co.;
These in business were join'd, and of course 'twas implied,
They their stocks should unite, and the profits divide.

Now the fable relates, it so happened one day,
That their efforts combined, made a bullock their prey:
But agreed that the Lion should make the division,
And patiently waited the monarch's decision.

"My friends," said the Lion, "I've parted, you see,
The whole into six, which is right, you'll agree;
One part I may claim, as my share in the trade."
"Oh, take it and welcome," they all of them said.

"I claim too the second; since no one denies
'Twas my courage and conduct that gained you the prize:
And for the third; that you know is a fine
To the Lord of the manor, and therefore is mine."

"Hey day!" said the fox; "Stop a bit," said the lion,
"I have not quite done," said he, fixing his eye on
The other three parts; "you are fully aware,
That, as _tribute_, one other part comes to my share.

"And I think 'twould be prudent, the next to put by
Somewhere safe in _my_ den for a future supply,
And the other, you know, will but barely suffice,
To pay those expenses which always arise."

"If this be the case," said the fox, "I discern
That the business to _us_ is a losing concern;
If so to withdraw, I should think would be best;"
"Oh, yes! let us break up the firm," said the rest;

And so:--for you may not have heard of it yet,--
It was quickly dissolved, though not in _the gazette_.


MORAL.

Some folks in their dealings, like him in the fable,
Will take others' shares, if they think they are able;
But let them not wonder who act in this way,
If they find none will join them in business or play.

THE LION AND THE MOUSE.


A lion, with the heat oppress'd,
One day composed himself to rest;
But whilst he dozed, as he intended,
A mouse his royal back ascended;
Nor thought of harm as Esop tells,
Mistaking him for something else,
And travelled over him, and round him,
And might have left him as he found him,
Had he not, tremble when you hear,
Tried to explore the monarch's ear!
Who straightway woke with wrath immense,
And shook his head to cast him thence.
"You rascal, what are you about,"
Said he, when he had turned him out.
"I'll teach you soon," the lion said,
"To make a mouse-hole in my head!"
So saying, he prepared his foot,
To crush the trembling tiny brute;
But he, the mouse, with tearful eye,
Implored the lion's clemency,
Who thought it best at least to give
His little pris'ner a reprieve.
'Twas nearly twelve months after this,
The lion chanced his way to miss;
When pressing forward: heedless yet,
He got entangled in a net.
With dreadful rage he stamp'd and tore,
And straight commenced a lordly roar;
When the poor mouse who heard the noise,
Attended, for she knew his voice.
Then what the lion's utmost strength
Could not effect, she did at length:
With patient labor she applied
Her teeth, the net-work to divide;
And so at last forth issued he,
A _lion_, by a mouse set free.


MORAL.

Few are so small or weak, I guess,
But may assist us in distress;
Nor shall we ever, if we're wise,
The meanest, or the least, despise.

THE JEALOUS ASS.


"There lived," says friend Esop, "some ages ago,
An ass who had feelings acute, you must know;
This ass to be jealous, felt strongly inclined,
And for reasons which follow, felt hurt in his mind."

It seems that his master, as I understand,
Had a favorite dog which he fed from his hand.
Nay, the dog was permitted to jump on his knee:
An honor that vex'd our poor donkey to see.

"Now," thought he, "what's the reason, I cannot see any,
That I have no favors, while he has so many?
If all this is got by just wagging his tail,
Why _I_ have got one, which I'll wag without fail."

So the donkey resolved to try what he could do
And, determined unusual attentions to show,
When his master was dining, came into the room.
"Good sir!" said his friends, "why your donkey is come!"

"Indeed!" said their host, great astonishment showing,
When he saw the ass come, while his tail was a-going;
But who can describe his dismay or fear,
When the donkey rear'd up, and bray'd loud in his ear!

"You rascal get down,--John, Edward, or Dick!
Where are you? make haste, and come here with a stick."
The man roared--the guests laugh'd--the dog bark'd--the bell rung:
Coals, poker, and tongs, at the donkey were flung,

Till the blows and the kicks, with combined demonstration,
Convinced him that this was a bad speculation;
So, mortified deeply, his footsteps retrod he,
Hurt much in his mind, but still more in his body.


MORAL.

So some silly children, as stupid as may be,
Will cry for indulgences fit for a baby.
Had they enter'd the room while the donkey withdrew,
They'd have seen their own folly and punishment too:
Let them think of this fable, and what came to pass;
Nor forget, he who play'd this fine game was _an ass_.

THE TOWN AND COUNTRY MICE.


A plain, but honest, country mouse,
Residing in a miller's house;
Once, on a time, invited down
An old acquaintance of the town:
And soon he brought his dainties out;
The best he had there's not a doubt.
A dish of oatmeal and green peas,
With half a candle, and some cheese;
Some beans, and if I'm not mistaken,
A charming piece of Yorkshire bacon.
And then to show he was expert
In such affairs, a fine dessert
Was next produced, all which he press'd,
With rustic freedom, on his guest.

But he, the city epicure,
This homely fare could not endure
Indeed he scarcely broke his fast
By what he took, but said, at last,
"Old crony, now, I'll tell you what:
I don't admire this lonely spot;
This dreadful, dismal, dirty hole,
Seems more adapted for a mole
Than 'tis for you; Oh! could you see
_My_ residence, how charm'd you'd be.
Instead of bringing up your brood
In wind, and wet, and solitude,
Come bring them all at once to town,
We'll make a courtier of a clown.
I think that, for your children's sake,
'Tis proper my advice to take."
"Well," said his host, "I can but try,
And so poor quiet hole good bye!"

Then off they jogg'd for many a mile,
Talking of splendid things the while;
At last, in town, they all arrived--
Found where the city mouse had lived--
Entered at midnight through a crack,
And rested from their tedious track.

"Now," said the city mouse, "I'll show
What kind of fare I've brought you to:"
On which he led the rustic mice
Into a larder, snug and nice,
Where ev'ry thing a mouse could relish,
Did ev'ry shelf and nook embellish.

"Now is not this to be preferr'd
To your green peas?" "Upon my word,
It is," the country mouse replied,
"All this must needs the point decide."

Scarce had they spoke these words, when, lo!
A tribe of servants hasten'd through,
And also two gigantic cats,
Who spied our country mouse and brats.
Then, by a timely exit, she
Just saved herself and family.

"Oh, ask me not," said she in haste,
"Your tempting dainties more to taste;
I much prefer my homely peas,
To splendid dangers such as these."


MORAL.

Then let not those begin to grumble,
Whose lot is safe, though poor and humble;
Nor envy him who better fares,
But for each good, has twenty cares.

THE FOX AND THE CROW.


Crows feed upon worms: yet an author affirms
  Cheshire cheese they will get if they're able;
"For," said he, "I well know, one unprincipled crow
  Once purloined a large piece from my table."

Then away darted she, to the shade of a tree,
  To deposit the booty within her;
But it never occurr'd to the mind of the bird,
  That a _fox_ was to have it for dinner.

"How many a slip, 'twixt the cup and the lip!"
  (Excuse me, I pray, the digression,)
Said a fox to himself, "I can share in the pelf,
  If I act with my usual discretion."

So said he, "Is it you? pray, ma'am, how do you do,
  I have long wish'd to pay you a visit;
For a twelvemonth has pass'd, since I heard of you last
  Which is not very neighborly, is it?

"But, dear madam," said he, "you are dining, I see;
  On that subject I'd ask your advice;
Pray, ma'am, now can you tell, where provisions they sell,
  That are not an extravagant price?

"Bread and meat are so dear, and have been for a year,
  That poor people can scarcely endure it,
And then _cheese is so high_, that such beggars as I,
  _Till it falls_, cannot hope to procure it."

But the ill-behaved bird did not utter a word,
  Still intent on retaining her plunder;
Thought the fox, "It should seem, this is not a good scheme,
  What else can I think of, I wonder?"

So said Reynard once more, "I ne'er knew it before,
  But your feathers are whiter than snow is!"
But thought he, when he'd said it, "she'll ne'er give it credit,
  For what bird is so black as a crow is."
"But I'm told that your voice is a horrible noise,
  Which they say of all sounds is the oddest;
But then this is absurd, for it never is heard,
  Since you are so excessively modest."

If _that's_ all thought the crow, "I will soon let you know
  That all doubt on that score may be ended;"
Then most laughingly piped, the poor silly biped,
  When quickly her dinner descended!


MORAL.

If this _biped_ had not been so vain and conceited,
She would not by the fox quite so soon have been cheated;
But perhaps the term _biped_ to some may be new:
'Tis a two-legged creature--perchance it is _you_.

THE LION AND THE ECHO.


A lion, bravest of the wood,
Whose title undisputed stood,
As o'er the wide domains he prowl'd,
And in pursuit of booty growl'd,
An Echo from a distant cave
Regrowl'd, articulately grave:
His majesty, surprised, began
To think at first it was a man;
But on reflection sage, he found
It was too like a lion's sound.
"Whose voice is that which growls at mine?"
His highness ask'd. Says Echo, "Mine!"
"Thine!" says the Lion: "Who art thou?"
Echo as stern cried, "Who art thou?"
"Know I'm a lion, hear and tremble!"
Replied the king. Cried Echo, "Tremble!"
"Come forth," says Lion; "show thyself."
Laconic Echo answered, "Elf."
"Elf, durst thou call me, vile pretender?"
Echo as loud replies, "Pretender!"
At this, as jealous of his reign,
He growl'd in rage; she growl'd again.
Incensed the more, he chafed and foam'd,
And round the spacious forest roam'd
To find the rival of his throne,
Who durst with him dispute the crown.

A fox, who listen'd all the while,
Address'd the monarch with a smile:
"My liege, most humbly I make bold,
Though truth may not be always told,
That this same phantom which you hear,
That so alarms your royal ear,
Is not a rival of your throne:
The voice and fears are all your own."
Imaginary terrors scare
A timorous soul with real fear;
Nay, even the wise and brave are cow'd
By apprehensions from the crowd:
A frog a lion may disharm,
And yet how causeless the alarm!

THE PAPER KITE.


Once on a time, a paper kite
Was mounted to a wondrous height;
Where, giddy with its elevation,
It thus express'd self-admiration:
"See how yon crowds of gazing people
Admire my flight above the steeple;
How would they wonder, if they knew
All that a kite, like me, could do?
Were I but free, I'd take a flight,
And pierce the clouds beyond their sight.
But, ah! like a poor prisoner bound,
My string confines me near the ground.
I'd brave the eagle's towering wing,
Might I but fly without a string."
It tugg'd and pull'd, while thus it spoke,
To break the string--at last it broke!
Deprived at once of all its stay,
In vain it tried to soar away:
Unable its own weight to bear,
It flutter'd downward through the air;
Unable its own course to guide,
The winds soon plunged it in the tide.
Oh! foolish kite, thou hadst no wing,
How could'st thou fly without a string?
My heart replied, "Oh, Lord, I see
How much the kite resembles me!
Forgetful that by thee I stand,
Impatient of thy ruling hand;
How oft I've wish'd to break the lines
Thy wisdom for my lot assigns!
How oft indulged a vain desire
For something more or something higher!
And but for grace and love divine,
A fall thus dreadful had been mine."

THE RATS AND THE CHEESE.


If bees a government maintain,
Why may not rats of stronger brain
And greater power, as well bethought
By Machiavelian axioms taught?
And so they are, for thus of late
It happened in the rats' free state.
Their prince (his subjects more to please)
Had got a mighty Cheshire cheese,
In which his ministers of state
Might live in plenty and grow great.
A powerful party straight combined,
And their united forces join'd,
To bring their measures into play,
For none so loyal were as they;
And none such patriots, to support
As well the country as the court.
No sooner were those Dons admitted
But (all those wondrous virtues quitted)
They all the speediest means devise
To raise themselves and families.
Another party well observing
These pamper'd were, while they were starving,
Their ministry brought in disgrace,
Expelled them and supplied their place;
These on just principles were known
The true supporters of the throne,
And for the subjects liberty
They'd (marry would they) freely die;
But being well fix'd in their station,
Regardless of their prince and nation,
Just like the others, all their skill
Was how they might their paunches fill.
On this a rat, not quite so blind
In state intrigues as human kind,
But of more honor, thus replied:
"Confound ye all on either side;
All your contentions are but these,
Whose arts shall best secure the cheese."

AURELIA AND THE SPIDER.


The muslin torn, from tears of grief
In vain Aurelia sought relief;
In sighs and plaints she pass'd the day;
The tatter'd frock neglected lay:
While busied at the weaving trade,
A spider heard the sighing maid
And kindly stopping in a trice,
Thus offer'd (gratis) her advice:
"Turn, little girl! behold in me
A stimulus to industry
Compare your woes, my dear, with mine,
Then tell me who should most repine:
This morning, ere you left your room,
The chambermaid's remorseless broom
In one sad moment that destroy'd,
To build which thousands were employ'd!
The shock was great; but as my life
I saved in the relentless strife,
I knew lamenting was in vain,
So patient went to work again.
By constant work, a day or more,
My little mansion did restore:
And if each tear which you have shed
Had been a needle-full of thread,
If every sigh of sad despair
Had been a stitch of proper care,
Closed would have been the luckless rent,
Nor thus the day have been misspent."

THE REDBREAST AND THE
SPARROW.


Perch'd on a tree, hard by a rural cot,
A redbreast singing cheer'd the humble spot;
A sparrow on the thatch in critic spleen
Thus took occasion to reprove the strain:
"Dost thou," cried he, "thou dull dejected thing,
Presume to emulate the birds of spring?
Can thy weak warbling dare approach the thrush
Or blackbird's accents in the hawthorn bush?
Or with the lark dost thou poor mimic, vie,
Or nightingale's unequal'd melody?
These other birds possessing twice thy fire
Have been content in silence to admire."
"With candor judge," the minstrel bird replied,
"Nor deem my efforts arrogance or pride;
Think not ambition makes me act this part,
I only sing because I love the art:
I envy not, indeed, but much revere
Those birds whose fame the test of skill will bear;
I feel no hope arising to surpass,
Nor with their charming songs my own to class;
Far other aims incite my humble strain.
Then surely I your pardon may obtain,
While I attempt the rural vale to move
By imitating of the lays I love."

THE POET AND THE COBWEBS.


A bard, whose pen had brought him more
Of fame than of the precious ore,
In Grub Street garret oft reposed
With eyes contemplative half-closed.
Cobwebs around in antique glory,
Chief of his household inventory,
Suggested to his roving brains
Amazing multitude of scenes.

"This batch," said he, "of murder-spinners
Who toil their brains out for their dinners,
Though base, too long unsung has lain
By kindred brethren of Duck Lane,
Unknowing that its little plan
Holds all the cyclopedia of man.

"This one, whose radiant thread
Is every where from centre spread,
Like orbs in planetary skies,
Enclosed with rounds of various size,
This curious frame I aptly call
A cobweb mathematical.

"In secret holes, that dirty line,
Where never sun presumes to shine,
With straws, and filth, and time beset,
Where all is fish that comes to net,
That musty film, the Muse supposes
Figures the web of Virtuosos.

"You, where the gaudy insect sings,
Are cobwebs of the court of kings,
Where gilded threads conceal the gin.
And broider'd knaves are caught therein.

"That holly, fix'd 'mid mildew'd panes,
Of cheerless Christmas the remains
(I only dream and sing its cheer,
My Muse keeps Lent throughout the year)
That holly, labor'd o'er and o'er,
Is cobwebs of the lawyer's lore,
Where frisky flies, on gambols borne,
Find out the snare, when lost, undone.

"These dangling webs, with dirt and age,
Display their tatter'd equipage,
So like the antiquarian crew,
That those in every thread I view.

"Here death disseminated lies,
In shrunk anatomies of flies;
And amputated limbs declare
What vermin lie in ambush there:
A baited lure with drugg'd perdition,
A cobweb, not misnamed physician.

"Those plaited webs, long pendent there,
Of sable bards a subtle snare,
Of all-collective disposition,
Which holds like gout of inquisition,
May well denominated be,
The trap-webs of divinity."

But whilst our bard described the scene,
A bee stole through a broken pane;
Fraught with the sweets of every flower,
In taking his adventurous tour,
Is there entrapp'd. Exert thy sting,
Bold bee, and liberate thy wing!
The poet kindly dropp'd his pen,
And freed the captive from its den;
Then musing o'er his empty table,
Forgot the moral of his fable.

THE EPICURE AND THE PHYSICIAN.


Two hundred years ago, or more,
An heir possess'd a miser's store;
Rejoiced to find his father dead,
Till then on thrifty viands fed;
Unnumber'd dishes crown'd his board,
With each unwholesome trifle stored.
He ate--and long'd to eat again,
But sigh'd for appetite in vain:
His food, though dress'd a thousand ways,
Had lost its late accustom'd praise;
He relish'd nothing--sickly grew--
Yet long'd to taste of something new.
It chanced in this disastrous case,
One morn betimes he join'd the chase:
Swift o'er the plain the hunters fly,
Each echoing out a joyous cry;
A forest next before them lay;
He, left behind, mistook his way,
And long alone bewildered rode,
He found a peasant's poor abode;
But fasting kept, from six to four,
Felt hunger, long unfelt before;
The friendly swain this want supplied,
And Joan some eggs and bacon fried.
Not dainty now, the squire in haste
Fell to, and praised their savory taste;
Nay, said his meal had such a _gout_
He ne'er in tarts and olios knew.
Rejoiced to think he'd found a dish,
That crown'd his long unanswer'd wish,
With gold his thankful host he paid,
Who guides him back from whence he stray'd;
But ere they part, so well he dined,
His rustic host the squire enjoin'd
To send him home next day a stock
Of those same eggs and charming hock.
He hoped this dish of savory meat
Would prove that still 'twas bliss to eat;
But, ah! he found, like all the rest,
These eggs were tasteless things at best;
The bacon not a dog would touch,
So rank--he never tasted such!
He sent express to fetch the clown,
And thus address'd him with a frown:
"These eggs, this bacon, that you sent,
For Christian food were never meant;
As soon I'll think the moon's a cheese,
As those you dress'd the same with these.
Little I thought"--"Sir," says the peasant,
"I'm glad your worship is so pleasant:
You joke, I'm sure: for I can swear,
The same the fowls that laid them are!
And know as well that all the bacon
From one the self-same flitch was taken:
The air, indeed, about our green
Is known to make the stomach keen."
"Is that the case?" the squire replied;
"That air shall be directly tried."
He gave command--a house he hired,
And down he goes with hope inspired,
And takes his cooks--a favorite train;
But still they ply their art in vain.
Perhaps 'twas riding did the feat:
He rides,--but still he cannot eat.
At last a friend, to physic bred,
Perceived his case, and thus he said:
"Be ruled by me, you soon shall eat,
With hearty gust, the plainest meat;
A pint of milk each rising morn,
Procure from cow of sable horn;
Shake in three drops of morning dew
From twig of ever-verdant yew;
It must by your own hand be done,
Your face turn'd westward from the sun.
With this, ere half an hour is past,
Well crumb'd with biscuit, break your fast;
Which done, from food (or all is vain)
For twice three hours and one abstain--
Then dine on one substantial dish,
If plainly dress'd, of flesh or fish."
Grave look'd the doctor as he spake--
The squire concludes th' advice to take,
And, cheated into temperance, found
The bliss his former luxury drown'd.

THE FROGS DESIRING A KING.


Athens in freedom flourish'd long,
'Till licence seized the giddy throng.
Just laws grown weary to obey,
They sunk to tyranny a prey.
Pisistratus, though mild he sway'd,
Their turbulence had not allay'd.
Whilst they were cursing in despair,
The yoke they had not learn'd to bear,
Esop, their danger to describe,
Rehears'd this fable to the tribe:

"Some frogs, like you, of freedom tired,
From Jupiter a king desir'd:
One that should execute the law,
And keep the dissolute in awe.
Jove laugh'd, and threw them down a log,
That thundering fell and shook the bog.
Amongst the reeds the tremblers fled:
Till one more bold advanc'd his head,
And saw the monarch of the flood
Lying half smothered in the mud.
He calls the croaking race around:
"A wooden king!" the banks resound.
Fear once remov'd they swim about him,
And gibe and jeer and mock and flout him;
And messengers to Jove depute,
Effectively to grant their suit.
A hungry stork he sent them then,
Who soon had swallow'd half the fen.
Their woes scarce daring to reveal,
To Mercury by night they steal,
And beg him to entreat of Jove
The direful tyrant to remove.
'No,' says the God, 'they chose their lot,
And must abide what they have got:'
So you, my friends, had best go home
In peace, lest something worse should come."

THE HARE AND THE BRAMBLE.


A hare, closely pursued, thought it prudent and meet
To a bramble for refuge awhile to retreat;
He enter'd the covert, but entering, found
That briers and thorns did on all sides abound;
And that, though he was safe, yet he never could stir,
But his sides they would wound, or would tear off his fur:
He shrugg'd up his shoulders, but would not complain:
"To repine at small evils," quoth puss, "is in vain:
That no bliss can be perfect, I very well knew--
But from the same source good and evil doth flow--
And full sorely my skin though these briers may rend,
Yet they keep off the dogs, and my life will defend:
For the sake of the good, then, let evil be borne--
For each sweet has its bitter, each bramble its thorn."

THE HORSE AND THE STAG.


Within a certain pasture,
  There lived some creatures wild.
The sky was blue, the grass was green,
  The air was very mild.

Now though this field was large and fine,
  They could not live in love:
But for the grass in one large spot
  A horse and stag once strove.

The stag was strongest in the strife,
  And so the battle won;
And from the field the horse was sent
  And with chagrin was stung.

So to the man the horse applied,
  For help, the stag to beat,
And so effectual was his help,
  The stag had to retreat.

But when to go away he tried,
  The man held to him fast:
"Now that you are of use," he cried,
  "You'll serve me to the last."

THE CAT AND THE OLD MOUSE.


The mice o'errun a certain house--
In every spot was found a mouse.
So for a cat the mistress went,
And to the kitchen puss was sent.

With diligence were many caught,
And eaten up. The mice were taught
That they some cunning must devise
To keep the prey from pussy's eyes.

So on a certain shelf so high,
To reach which puss in vain might try,
There all the mice together got,
And they resolved to leave it not.

So pussy found that to eat them,
She must resort to stratagem.
And holding fast by means of pegs,
She hung suspended by the legs.

And downward she then hung her head,
And looked as though she were quite dead--
And thus she sought to cheat the mice,
And from their dwellings them entice.

A cunning mouse, well "up to trap,"
On pussy her two eyes did clap.
"Aha!" she cried, "puss are you there?
Within your reach, I would not dare--
Not e'en though it were proved by law,
That your whole skin were stuffed with straw."

THE FOX AND THE VIZOR MASK.


A fox while walking out one day,
Into a toy shop chanced to stray;
Among the toys that stood arrayed,
A vizor mask was there displayed,
With rosy cheeks, complexion fair,
And ruby lips and auburn hair,
And eyes of blue, and Grecian nose;
And many beauties to disclose,
It seemed made. The fox, with sighs,
Gazed on. "Ah, ah!" he cries,
"Look at this head it naught contains,
It has rare beauty, but no brains."


MORAL.

The accomplished beau, in air and mien how blest.
His hat well fashioned, and his hair well dress'd--
But still undress'd within: to give him brains
Exceeds his hatter's or his barber's pains.

THE GOOSE THAT LAID GOLDEN
EGGS.


A man once had a goose I'm told,
Which had laid each day an egg of gold.
Now if this treasure were well spent,
It might make any one content.
But no! this man desired more;
And though of eggs he had rich store;
He thought one day the goose he'd kill,
And then at once his pockets fill.
So chasing goosey round and round,
She soon was caught and firmly bound
He opened her from neck to tail
And then his folly did bewail.
For not a single egg was there,
And thus he lost this treasure rare.

[Illustration]

THE FOX AND THE GRAPES.


A fox once took it in his pate,
To go beyond a garden gate,
To see if there grew on the trees,
Some food his hunger to appease.
So in he went and there he spied
Some grapes. To reach them hard he tried.
Now they were large and luscious too,
Quite purple, and beautiful to view.
So up he jumps with many a bound,
Until exhausted to the ground,
He falls. The grapes hang o'er his head,
In clusters large, "Well! well!" he said,
"You are but green, and hard as stone,
And all my time away is thrown.
I'll leave you to your solitude,
You are not fit to make me food."

THE MOUSE AND THE WEASEL.


A very thin and hungry mouse,
  Into a granary stole,
Where stood a basket full of grain,
  In which was a small hole.

After much squeezing he got in,
  And there he ate his fill;
But when he tried to issue out,
  The hole seemed smaller still.

A weasel who stood looking on,
  Cried out in sneering tone,
"You can't come out, my little dear,
  Until you've smaller grown.

"You were half-starved when you crept in,
  And now you are quite stout;
So cease to eat until you can,
  As you got in, get out."

THE MISER AND HIS TREASURE.


  In a retired spot,
  A miser had got
A very large treasure in store.
  And it was his delight,
  Each morn and each night,
To count it and add to it more.

  He had made the hole deep,
  And he thought none would peep,
To find out his secret retreat.
  But a servant so sly,
  His master did spy,
And thought that his cunning he'd beat.

  So one dark winter night,
  He took out his light,
And to the field hastened away;
  And he laughed in his sleeve,
  To think how 'twould grieve
His master to miss it next day.

  And indeed the distress
  Of his lord you may guess,
For words can't describe it, I'm sure.
  He tore out his hair,
  Clasp'd his hands in despair
And cried he was ruined and poor.

  A man passing by,
  His grief chanced to spy;
And told him, "'tis useless to mourn.
  You can look at the hole,
  To solace your soul,
Although all the money is gone."

THE JACKDAW AND THE PEACOCKS.


Thus Esop has the folly shown,
To build on merits not your own.

A jackdaw, empty, pert and vain,
Who held his equals in disdain,
One day some beauteous feathers found,
Left by a peacock on the ground.
When in the gaudy plumage dress'd,
The shallow thing his fortune bless'd;
With stately gesture strode along,
And boldly join'd the peacock throng;
Who, his impertinence to pay,
First stripp'd him, and then chas'd away.
The crest-fall'n coxcomb homeward sneaks,
And his forsaken comrades seeks;
Where'er he comes, with scorn they leave him,
And not a jackdaw will receive him.
Says one he had disdain'd, at last,
"Such as thou art, thou mightst have pass'd,
And hadst not now been cast behind,
The scorn and scandal of thy kind."

THE SPARROW AND THE HARE.


Who dares another's ills deride,
Had best against his own provide.
An eagle pouncing on a hare,
With piercing cries puss rends the air;
When a pert sparrow from a tree,
Insulted thus her misery:
"Ho, ho! poor puss, thy boasted speed
Has failed thee, then, in time of need!"
Scarce had she spoke, when, like an arrow,
A vulture darted on the sparrow.
Ere the poor hare resign'd her breath,
"This sight," she cried, "consoles in death
--That thou, who hast my woes derided,
My last of miseries hast divided!"

THE ASS AND THE LION.


Vain boasters credit may surprise,
Till known; who knows them will despise.

A lion once a hunting took
An ass, and hid him in a nook.
To drive the forest made him bray,
That he might seize the passing prey.
Long-ears set up such horrid cries,
That every creature trembling flies;
The lion, practised in his trade,
Had soon abundant carnage made;
Satiate with spoil, the ass he calls,
And bid him cease his hideous brawls.
The king he found with slaughter weary,
Surrounded by his noble quarry,
And, puffed with self-importance, said:
"Sir, to some purpose I have bray'd!"
"No ass more famously could do,"
The lion says, "but thee I knew,
Or I might have been frightened too."

THE STAG AND THE FOUNTAIN.


That good from bad men rarely know,
This apologue may serve to show:

A stag upon a fountain's side,
Beheld his branching horns with pride;
While of his spindle-shanks asham'd,
Their disproportioned form he blam'd.
Sudden he hears the hunter's cries,
And to the forest nimbly flies.
The woods receive their well-known guest.
His tangled horns, his feet arrest;
The hounds approach, and seize their prey;
Who, dying, thus was heard to say:
"Wretch that I am! too late I learn,
How little we the truth discern!
What would have saved me, I despis'd,
And what has been my ruin, priz'd!"

THE EAGLE, THE CAT, AND THE
SOW.


Her nest on high an eagle made
Lower a cat her kittens laid;
And at the bottom of the tree
A sow dispos'd her progeny.
Vile puss to gain her wicked ends,
Much love for both of them pretends.
First to the eagle's aerie mounts,
And thus to her false alarms recounts:
"Madam, in truth our dangerous state,
'Tis with reluctance I relate;
But things are really gone so far,
Conceal them I no longer dare.
Night after night the treacherous sow
Our tree has undermined below;
Ere long it cannot choose but fall,
And then she hopes to eat us all."
Successful when she saw her lies,
Down to the bristly sow she hies;
"My worthy neighbor!" crying out,
"I pray you, mind what you're about,
For to a certainty I know,
The eagle waits but till you go,
(The thing with great concern I say,)
To make your little ones her prey."
Suspicious dread when thus inspir'd,
Puss to her hole all day retir'd;
Stealing at night on silent paw,
To stuff her own and kittens' maw.
To stir nor sow nor eagle dare.
What more? fell hunger ends their care;
And long the mischief-making beast
With her base brood on carrion feast.

Learn hence, ye simples, ere too late,
What ills the double-tongued create.

THE EAGLE, THE RAVEN AND
THE TORTOISE.


Who in their foe united find
Force, art, and a remorseless mind,
Whate'er their strength and prowess be,
To perish stand in jeopardy.

An eagle once a tortoise held,
Safe in his horny house concealed,
Which he in vain essayed to break
With all the fury of his beak.
As with his prey he wing'd the air,
A wily raven ventur'd near:
"Your prize is excellent," says she,
"And if you'll give a share to me,
I know, for all his iron hide,
How we the dainty may divide."
The bargain made, "On yonder wall,
Down," says the raven, "let him fall."
He listen'd to the hoary sinner;
And they on turtle made their dinner.

Thus fraud and force their purpose gain,
And nature fortifies in vain.

THE FLY AND THE HORSE.


A fly upon a coach-box seated,
With arrogance the horses rated.
"Advance!" cries out the paltry thing,
"Unless you mean to feel my sting."
"Not thee we heed," a horse replied,
"But him whose skilful hand can guide
The rein and whip. We better know
Than thee when we should stop or go."

Thus men without or sense or weight,
Think themselves born to rule the state.

ESOP AT PLAY.


When an Athenian Esop saw,
Playing with school-boys once at taw,
The man with laughter shook his sides;
Esop the laughter thus derides:
"Of this slack bow before you laid,
The meaning, sprightly sir," he said,
"Explain!" (A crowd had gather'd round.)
Surpris'd, the man no answer found:
He puzzled long, but all his wit
Could on no explanation hit.
The laugh on Esop's side; says he,
"Why you this bow unbended see,
It is because it needs must break,
If always bent; so we must take
Due relaxation, that the mind
Its vigor may when wanted find."

He who in harmless sport employs
A vacant hour, is not unwise.

[Illustration]

THE OLD PILOT AND THE SAILORS.


To one complaining of his fate,
Esop this fable did relate.

A ship by raging tempests toss'd,
The seamen, giving all for lost,
'Twas who should weep and pray the most.
Grown calm at once the sky and sea,
They shout in joyful extacy.
The pilot, from experience wise,
The giddy crew did thus advise:
"Nor much rejoice, nor over grieve,
But decently what comes receive;
Since good and ill succeed so near,
Meet ill with hope and good with fear."

THE CRAB AND HER DAUGHTER.


Not what they hear, but what they see,
Will children and domestics be.

A crab one day her daughter chid;
"You never do as you are bid,
Have I not told you o'er and o'er,
That awkward gait to use no more?
Learn, ninny, once for all to know,
Folks forward and not backward go."
"Mamma," says Miss, "how strange you talk!
Have I not learn'd from you to walk?
Were I to move the other way,
How could I follow you I pray?"

THE SUN AND THE WIND.


Phebus and Boreas from on high
Upon the road a traveller spy,
Wearing a cloak for fear of rain.
Says Boreas, "his precaution's vain
'Gainst me, I'll show you for a joke
How soon I'll make him quit his cloak."
"Come on," says Phebus, "let us see
Who best succeeds, or you or me."
The wind to blow so fierce began,
He almost had upset his man;
But still his cloak, for all his roar,
Was wrapp'd more closely than before.
When Boreas what he could had done,
"Now for my trial," says the Sun,
And with his beams so warm'd the air,
The man his mantle could not bear,
But open'd first, then threw aside.

Learn hence, unbending sons of pride
Persuasive manners will prevail,
When menaces and bluster fail.

THE TWO POTS.


Forc'd on a stream to make their way,
To pot of brass says pot of clay:
"Since brass is stout and clay is frail,
Pray let us at a distance sail.
Not your intention that I fear
Sir Brass," adds humble Earthenware,
"While the winds leave you to yourself;
But woe betide my ribs of delf,
If it should dash our sides together;
For mine would be the damage, whether
Their force should you or I impel;
To pray proceed, and fare you well."

Learn hence, ye folks of low estate,
To keep due distance from the great.

HERCULES AND THE CARTER.


His cart bemired, a carter pray'd
To Hercules to come and aid.
"Up!" says the God, "thou lazy dog.
And lift the axle from the bog;
Think'st thou Gods nothing have to do
But listen to such knaves as you?"

THE ANT AND THE GRASSHOPPER.


From a wise emmet, well sustain'd
On what her industry had gain'd,
A grasshopper some aid desir'd.
"What was his trade?" the ant inquir'd.
"I've none," the grasshopper replied;
"I range the country far and wide,
Singing all day from door to door,
And have no time to form a store."
Shutting her granaries, says the ant,
"No wonder, friend, you are in want;
He who all summer sings, may chance
In winter to be forc'd to dance."

To spend his time in idle song,
The thoughtless grasshopper was wrong;
And not to give a small supply,
The emmet mean and niggardly.

[Illustration]

THE CROW AND THE PITCHER.


Patience and ingenuity
The want of natural means supply.

A thirsty crow some water found,
But in a vessel so profound,
That with her neck at utmost stretch,
A single drop she could not reach.
Then stones she in the pitcher places,
Which to the top the water raises;
And by this innocent device
Her thirst at leisure satisfies.




[Illustration]

THE ANGLER AND THE LITTLE
FISH.


An angler a small salmon caught,
Who with much earnestness besought
That he would let her go: says she,
"What can you do with such as me!
Next year when grown a little bigger,
I in your bag might make a figure."
The prudent man replied, "No, no;
Into my pouch, though small, you go.
A bird in hand is better far,
Than two that in the bushes are."




[Illustration]

THE FROG AND THE FOX.


Let us our own defects amend,
Ere to guide others we pretend.

A sallow, wrinkl'd, spotted frog,
To turn physician left the bog.
"He every malady could cure,"
He said, "that animals endure."
"First on yourself your science show,"
Says Reynard: "that the world may know
Your skill and knowledge, pray begin
Of those foul spots to clear your skin:
For while you look so sick and pale,
To vend your drugs you'll ne'er prevail."

THE APE AND HER YOUNG ONES.


An ape had cubs; one much she lov'd,
The other small affection prov'd.
Alarm'd, she hears the hunter's cries;
And catching up her darling flies:
Through fear she stumbled o'er some stones
And broke the little favorite's bones;
The other to her back who clung
Uninjured went with her along.

Mothers, beware! the fondl'd child
By too much tenderness is spoil'd;
While those who hardships have endur'd,
To suffer life are best inur'd.

THE FIR TREE AND THE THORN.


The lowly and contented state
Is farthest from the wounds of fate.

A fir tree upon a humble thorn
From his high top look'd down with scorn.
"For loftiest fanes we grow," she said,
"Of us the tallest masts are made,
While thou, poor bramble, canst produce
Nothing of ornament or use."
"Great tree," the modest thorn replied,
"When the sharp axe shall pierce your side,
In vain you then may wish to be
Unsought-for, and unknown like me."

THE ASS IN THE LION'S SKIN.


Fools may on other fools impose;
The sage their real value knows.

An ass once found a lion's skin,
And rolling up himself therein,
From every fold that he came nigh,
Made flocks, and herds, and shepherds fly.
Ranging the country round, at last
He meets his master where he pass'd,
Who long-ears instantly descries
Through his magnificent disguise:
Laying his cudgel on his side,
"Get home, thou stupid fool," he cried:
"With others for a lion pass;
I know thee for an arrant ass."

THE DOG IN THE MANGER.


A mastiff in a stable lay,
Couch'd on a manger full of hay.
When any thing drew near to eat,
He quickly forced it to retreat.
An ox then cried, "detested creature,
How vile is thy malignant nature,
Which will not others let enjoy
That which thou never canst employ!"




[Illustration]

THE STAG AND THE VINE.


A stag pursued with horn and hound
In a thick vineyard shelter found.
Soon as he thought the danger past,
He on the vine began to feast.
The huntsman hears the rustling noise,
And through half-eaten leaves descries
His branching horns, the pack recalls,
And merited the creature falls
To his ingratitude a prey.

Those their protectors who betray,
Unpitying, all the world will see
Consign'd to death and infamy.




[Illustration]

THE MISCHIEVOUS DOG.


Titles and ribands, bought with shame,
Folly and vice but more proclaim.
A man who own'd a vicious dog,
Upon his collar fix'd a log,
Which the vain cur supposed to be
A note of worth and dignity.
A mastiff saw his foolish pride;
"Puppy," indignantly he cried,
"That thing is put about your neck
Your mischievous designs to check;
And to who see you to declare,
Of what a currish race you are."




[Illustration]

THE SICK MAN AND THE PHYSICIAN.


Woe to the land where those who guide,
To please the people's foolish pride,
Persuade them there is nought to dread,
When ruin threatens o'er their head.

A patient, ask'd to tell his pains,
Of thirst and shivering cold complains.
"'Tis very good," the doctor said;
"He has but to remain in bed,
And take the med'cines I shall send,
The thing will soon be at an end."
When next the question was repeated,
The man complain'd he much was heated;
"This," cried the leech, "is better still!"
And thus to each increasing ill,
"That it was going well," he cried,
Till the poor martyr sunk and died.

THE FARMER AND HIS SONS.


Work, work, my boys, with hand and mind!
Your labors you will fruitful find.

A husbandman, about to die,
Call'd on his children to come nigh:
"I leave," he says, "a small estate,
But wherewithal to make it great:
For know, a treasure it contains,
If you to search will take the pains."
He died. The sons dug all the ground,
And there no hidden treasure found;
But so productive was the soil,
The crop by far o'erpaid the toil.
Says one, when they the corn had sold,
"This treasure 'twas our sire foretold!"

THE SWALLOW AND THE BIRDS.


Those who of guides stand most in need,
Are least inclin'd advice to heed.

A travell'd swallow, learn'd and wise,
To all his feather'd neighbors cries:
"See you yon laborers there below;
What is it, think ye, that they sow?
'Tis hemp, my friends; of which are made
The nets that for us all are laid;
The moment yonder men are gone,
Then pick the seeds up one by one."
The gay inhabitants of air
For his precaution little care.
The seedling sprung; again the swallow
Urges his good advice to follow;
Again his counsel they deride.
The plants full grown, and cut, and dried,
Beaten and spun, the nets were made,
And the unwary birds betray'd,
Regretting, in their hapless fate,
Their incredulity too late.

Learn hence the danger to foresee,
Nor wait for their maturity.

THE BOASTING TRAVELLER.


A fellow who abroad had been,
Told marvels he had done and seen:
"When resident at Rhodes," he said,
"A leap of twenty yards he made
Over a barrier ten feet high;
A dozen witnesses were by."
"Come on," says one, at the same table,
"Yon ditch and fence to o'erleap you're able.
They're not, by much, so high or wide;
Here let the experiment be tried.
Suppose yourself at Rhodes, and we
Your faithful witnesses will be."
The man replied, "that he to-day
Was not quite well," and stole away.

Who boast of what they cannot do
Both knavery and folly show.

THE OLD WOMAN AND HER MAIDS.


Better known evils to endure,
Than seek by wrong a doubtful cure.

A thrifty dame her maids awoke
At the first crowing of the cock.
They of such early rising tir'd,
To kill the harmless cock conspir'd.
The dame, to hear him crow in wait,
Next morning lay in bed till eight.
But when she knew the trick they had play'd,
She caused a larum to be made,
And rung it daily in their ears
Two hours before the dawn appears.

INDUSTRY AND SLOTH.


Insidious sloth her object gains,
If but a hearing she obtains.

A youth ask'd why so long in bed?
"I listen to a cause," he said;
"As soon as I unclose my eyes.
First industry excites to rise."
"Up, up," she says, "to meet the sun,
Your task of yesterday's undone!"
"Lie still," cries sloth, "it is not warm,
An hour's more sleep can do no harm;
You will have time your work to do,
And leisure for amusement too."

THE SHEPHERD TURNED MERCHANT.


Fair weather sailors, keep at home,
For be assur'd the storm will come.

A shepherd of an inland breed
Brought to the coast his flocks to feed;
The beauty of a summer sea,
A merchant tempted him to be.
He sold his sheep, and with the sale
Purchas'd of dates an ample bale.
He sail'd; a furious tempest rose;
Into the sea his dates he throws;
And swimming from the bark to land,
Arrives half dead upon the strand.
To one, soon afterwards who stood
Pleas'd with the calmness of the flood,
"Aye, aye," the simple shepherd said
"With dates again it would be fed."

[Illustration]




[Illustration]

THE SPENDTHRIFT AND THE
SWALLOW.


A fool who all had thrown away,
When wandering pennyless one day,
Perceived a swallow. "Ho," says he,
"Summer is come at last I see!"
And to a Jew his mantle sold.
Next day it was severely cold:
Starv'd as he walk'd, the bird he found
Frozen to death upon the ground.
"Ah! what a fool was I," he cried,
"When on one swallow I relied!"

Those who too readily believe,
For their credulity may grieve.




[Illustration]

THE EAGLE AND THE CROW.


The wise well know their force to weigh,
Nor what they cannot do, essay.

A carrion crow an eagle saw
Seize on a lamb with beak and claw.
Conceiving he could better do,
He pounces on a well fed ewe;
But he and not the sheep was caught;
For when to fly with it he sought,
His feet entangled in the wool,
The shepherd seiz'd the helpless fool.

[Illustration]

THE WOLF AND THE SHEPHERD'S
BOY.


In wantonness a shepherd's boy
Alarm'd the neighbor's with his cry;
"The wolf! the wolf!" And when they came,
Of their lost labor made his game.
At last the wolf when there indeed,
His real cries they did not heed;
He and his flock a prey were made,
And for his lies he dearly paid.

Those who are known to have deceiv'd,
When they speak truth, are not believ'd.

[Illustration]




[Illustration]

THE FOX WITHOUT A TAIL.


Fashions and modes we often see,
Made to conceal deformity:
Those to whom nature has been kind,
Should leave such fopperies behind.

A fox who in a trap was taken,
Resign'd his brush to save his bacon.
Ashamed that all the world should know
His cunning had been cheated so,
To an assembly of the nation
He made the following oration:
"I oft have thought the tails we wear
A troublesome appendage are;
Where's their utility, I pray?
They serve but to obstruct our way.
Nor ornamental do I find,
To drag this ponderous length behind.
For my part, without more debate,
I move our tails we amputate."
"Please, sir, to show yourself behind,"
(Says one to smoke the jest inclin'd,
And who discovered what it was)
"We there perhaps shall see the cause,
Ere we your prudent counsel take,
Why you this curious motion make?"
His bare posteriors when they found,
Loud laughter shook the benches round;
Nor could the fox without a tail
To introduce the mode prevail.




[Illustration]

THE MEN AND THE OYSTER.


Any partition better make,
Than _all_ the hungry law should take.

By the sea side two travellers found
A fine large oyster on the ground;
His claim each obstinately lays:
"I saw it first," one eager says;
"I pick'd it up," the other cries;
"Mine"--"Mine is certainly the prize."
They talk'd as usual, loud and long;
And more they reason'd, more were wrong;
Till they a neighboring lawyer see
Passing, and mutually agree
To take him for their referee.
With legal dignity of face,
He heard them both relate the case;
"Your claims are good," then gravely said,
"And a brave lawsuit would have made
Which to prefer I cannot tell,
So each of you must take a shell;
And, as the oyster is but one,
That I myself will swallow down;
To stink it otherwise had lain,
And all your cash been spent in vain;
You're cheaply off; go home content;
And faith the fish was excellent."




[Illustration]

THE SHEPHERD AND HIS DOG.


A dog his master so deceiv'd,
He was the best of curs believ'd.
The flock was trusted to his care,
Whene'er the shepherd was not there.
And in the house, a favored guest,
He always fed upon the best.
The treacherous guard his charge betray'd
And on the sheep in secret prey'd.
The master, when the crime was prov'd,
With double indignation mov'd,
About his neck the halter tied
Himself: the dog for mercy cried;
"You let the wolf escape," he said,
"Who much more slaughter oft has made."
"Wretch!" says the man, "the wolf declares
Hostility, and boldly dares;
He has no confidence abused:
But, coward, thou my trust hast used:
Against myself! and on this tree
Without delay shalt hanged be."

THE COUNTRYMAN AND THE
JUSTICE.


The law still lends the readiest aid,
When well her ministers are paid.

A countryman, by power oppress'd,
Seeking to have his wrongs redress'd,
Oft to the justice went in vain;
Admittance he could ne'er obtain,
But still was bid again to come;
"Unwell"--"engag'd"--or "not home!"
The wily rustic took a kid
One day, and in a basket hid;
And when he to the house drew near,
Began to pinch him by the ear,
So that the porter, from the hall,
Might hear the little fatling squall;
The man his master's mind who knew,
Open'd the door and let him through.
The shepherd, laughing as he pass'd,
Says to his kid, "Thy cries at last
An audience for my wrongs obtain;
Thy flesh, perhaps, redress will gain."

THE COCK AND THE FOX.


The world applauds the lucky hit,
When it beholds the biter bit.

A treach'rous fox invited down
A cock, who on a tree had flown.
"Do you not know, my friend," says he,
"Bird, beast, fish, reptile, man agree,
To live henceforth in amity?
Come down and celebrate the day."
"Troth," quoth the cock, "you truly say;
For hounds I see come o'er the dell,
With open mouths, the news to tell."
"Adieu," says Ren. "'Tis best to go;
Those dogs the treaty may not know."

THE BLIND MAN AND THE LAME.


Who kind assistance give and take,
Life's arduous journey best will make.

Two men, one blind, the other lame,
To pass a ford together came.
The stream was rapid, and the way
Obliquely thwart the current lay;
To his companion says the blind,
"Yon winding road I ne'er shall find."
"Nor my poor limbs," the lame replied,
"The current's rapid force abide."
"Come," says the blind, "my loins are strong,
I'll bear you on my back along,
While you to guide me give the word;"
And thus they safely cross'd the ford.

THE MAN AND THE SERPENT.


There's in the world a cursed race,
Of nature so perverse and base,
If from the gallows you should save,
A dangerous enemy you have.

A countryman a serpent found,
Stiffen'd with frost upon the ground,
And took her home; but when the fire
Began new vigor to inspire,
Swelling her neck with angry eyes,
She fills the cot with hissing cries.
The rustic then his axe did take,
"Is this then the return you make?
Is this your gratitude?" he said,
And knock'd the reptile on the head.

THE TWO STREAMS.


Those who display much dash and din,
Have seldom any thing within.

A weary traveller, one day,
Cross'd o'er a river in his way;
Alarm'd to see the foaming tide
Dashing o'er rocks from side to side,
Nevertheless, his course to keep,
He ventur'd in with trembling step;
And found the water neither deep,
Nor footing bad; and got well o'er.
When he had travell'd some leagues more,
He to another river came,
That smoothly flowed, a silent stream:
This he thought easily to pass;
But ere he in the middle was,
He plunged into a gulf profound,
And for his feet no bottom found;
But, forced to swim with all his might,
Got to the shore in piteous plight.

THE SOT AND HIS WIFE.


Inveterate sin is seldom cur'd.

A wife had long a sot endur'd,
Who all his time in taverns spent,
While his affairs in ruin went.
Once as insensible he lay,
She dress'd him in a corpse's array,
And with the undertaker's aid,
Into a burying vault convey'd.
The fumes dispersed, the man awakes;
All for reality he takes.
When by the glimmering of a lamp
He saw his mansion drear and damp,
Reflecting how his life had pass'd,
A forced repentance came at last.
The wife, with suited voice and dress,
Presented an infernal mess:
"Good Trap, pray take away your meat;
I have no appetite to eat,"
He cried, "but faith I'm devilish dry:
Can't you a bowl of wine supply?"
The woman, seeing all was vain,
Restor'd him to his casks again:
Consol'd with certainty, that he
Ere long a real corpse must be.

THE FARMER AND HIS QUARRELSOME
SONS.


Three sons an honest farmer had;
And it so happen'd, ne'er a lad
Could with the other two agree;
All quarrelling perpetually.
Their time in idle contest spent,
Garden and farm to ruin went;
And the good farmer and his wife
Led but a miserable life.
One day as this unhappy sire
Sat musing by his evening fire,
He saw some twigs in bundles stand,
Tied for the basket-maker's hand.
Taking up one: "My boys," says he,
"Which is the strongest, let me see;
He who this bundle breaks in twain,
The preference, and this prize shall gain,"
(Showing a pair of Sunday shoes.)
The rivals every effort use
In vain. Their utmost force when tried,
The father took the twigs untied,
And giving to them one by one,
The work immediately was done.
"Yon twigs," he says, "that broken lie,
This useful lesson may supply:
That those in amity who live,
And succor to each other give,
Double their forces to resist
Oppression, and their work assist."

THE FIG TREE AND THE FLOWERING
SHRUB.


Flowers which many leaves display,
In fruitless beauty fade away.

Cries one of these, with saucy sneer,
To a plain fig-tree growing near,
"How comes it, honest friend, that thou
Dost in the spring no blossoms show?"
Says he, "I keep them out of view,
For fear I should resemble you,
And in the autumn nought produce
Of permanence and solid use."

Who soon and much essay to shine,
May dread a premature decline.

THE FARMER AND THE LANDLORD.


A farmer of an honest fame,
One morning to his landlord came:
"Alas, my lord," he weeping said,
"Gored by my bull, your ox is dead.
What must be done?" "The case is plain,"
Replies the lord; "the creature slain,
The owner of the bull must pay;
Let it be done without delay."
"Heav'n give your worship long to live!
I hope you will a good one give,
For mine was good!" "How! your's, my friend?
Let me your story comprehend:
Your bull, you say, my ox has gored?"
"Forgive me the mistake, my lord,
In my confusion I have made;
Mine was the ox that must be paid;
But 'tis all one--what's just for me
The same must for your worship be:
I'll tell the steward what you say."
"Not yet--we'll think of it to-day.
Further inquiry must be had;
Perhaps your fences were but bad;
Perhaps--but come again to-morrow."
The honest laborer saw with sorrow,
That justice wears a different face,
When for themselves men put the case.

THE SCHOOL-BOY AND THE
MONITOR.


At play on Thames's verdant side
A school boy fell into the tide,
Where providentially there stood
A willow, bending o'er the flood.
Buoy'd on its branch, he floating lay,
The monitor pass'd by that way.
The lad entreats his life to save:
The Don replies with aspect grave,
"Sirrah, what business had you there?
How vain is all our watchful care!
You never heed a word we say;
Your disobedience you shall pay!"
"First," says the boy, "pray stretch your hand:
I'll hear you when I come to land."

This is for those, with vain parade
Who give advice, instead of aid.




[Illustration]

THE MILLER AND HIS ASS.


A rustic bringing to the fair
An ass, that he might show him there,
Sleek and well looking let him trot;
He followed with his son on foot.
The first they met upon the road,
At our pedestrians laugh'd loud,
"Look at those two legged asses," cried,
"Who trudge on foot when they might ride!"
The father with the hint complies:
Makes the boy mount. Now other cries
Assail their ears; by graybeards blam'd;
"Sirrah, you ought to be asham'd
To ride and let your father walk!"
Again he listened to their talk.
The sire got up, the youth got down;
When passing through a country town,
At every door the mothers said,
"A murrain light on thy old head!
Hast thou no bowels for thy kind?
At least take up the lad behind."
This done they next were thus address'd:
"Two lubbers on a little beast?
They fitter are to carry him!"
Complying with this senseless whim,
Upon a pole his feet in air,
The ass they on their shoulders bear.
Now laughing shouts spread far and wide.
The ass's ligatures untied,
"Proceed, my son," then said the man:
"To please the world, do all we can,
Since 'tis impossible, you see,
To please ourselves content we'll be."

THE DREAMER AND HIS SON.


Mortals bring down upon their head
The very miseries most they dread.

The only son of a rich knight
In hunting daily took delight.
The father living in alarm,
Lest he should come to any harm,
Dream'd that he saw him on the ground,
Rent with the lion's fatal wound.
The youth, allow'd to hunt no more,
Impatiently confinement bore.
Remarking, one unlucky day,
In the fine chamber where he lay,
A lion painted on the wall,
"Thou art," he cried, "the cause of all."
With idle rage the wall he struck,
And in his hand an iron stuck,
Which piercing bones and sinews through,
Fester'd and then a gangrene grew.
And thus the father's ill-tim'd care
Deprived him of his son and heir.

THE OLD MAN AND DEATH.


Though life be welcome to the wise,
Death cannot take him by surprise;
Aware that every day and hour
He holds but at the tyrant's power,
That beauty, talents, worth, are vain.
A moment's respite to obtain.
Nothing more known, and yet how rare
It is with courage to prepare
For this inevitable day!
All hope a little more delay.

One who had suffer'd many a year,
And to a century drew near,
At last complain'd, that unawares
Death came, unsettled his affairs:
"My will is not completely made;
A little time," he trembling said,
"A little longer let me live;
Some warning 'tis but fair to give!
My grandson is expected home;
At least pray, let the doctor come."
"Poor helpless driveller!" Death replied,
"Ten years ago thou should'st have died!
Thy friends, thy foes, thyself outliv'd:
Almost an age thou hast surviv'd:
Some who their day had scarce begun.
Others beneath their noon-tide sun--
Time's deepest lines engrave thy brow,
And dost thou hesitate to go?
Idiot, what warning would'st thou have?
One foot already in the grave:
Sight, hearing, feeling, day by day,
Sunk gradual in a long decay.
I blame myself for my neglect;
Thou'st not a moment to expect!"

When failing nature warns, the sage
Sees death a refuge from old age;
And rising from life's lengthened feast,
Willing retires, a sated guest.

THE PAINTER.


When candid critics deign to blame
Their index points the road to fame,
But when dull fools your works admire,
Throw them at once into the fire.

In Rome there dwelt, in days of yore,
A painter deep in graphic lore.
His touch was firm, his outline true,
And every rule full well he knew.
A Mars he painted, meant to show
How far his learned skill could go.
The work complete, he call'd a friend,
On whose good taste he could depend.
The friend was honest, spoke his thought,
And fairly pointed out the fault,
"That overwork'd in every part,
It show'd too much laborious art."
The painter argued for his rules,
And cited maxims from the schools;
Still the judicious critic held
The labor should be more conceal'd.
While they disputed on his stricture,
A coxcomb came to see the picture:
Entering, he cries, "Good heavens, how fine!
The piece, I swear, is quite divine!
The sword, the knot, the belt, the leather,
The steel, the gold, the silk, the feather,
Are perfect nature, all together!"
The painter, reddening with despite,
Whispers, "My friend, by Jove, you're right.
'Tis not enough our art to know,
Till less of it we learn to show;
My picture must be done again
I see, to please discerning men."

THE COBBLER AND THE NABOB.


A cobbler, who had fix'd his stall
Against a nabob's palace wall,
Work'd merrily as others play,
And sung and whistled all the day.
A prey to many an anxious care,
Less merry was the lord, by far;
And often in the night he thought
It hard, sleep was not to be bought:
And if tow'rds morn he got a doze,
The cobbler troubled his repose.
One day he bid the man attend--
And, "Well," says he, "my honest friend,
How is it that so well you thrive?
You seem the happiest man alive.
Pray, what may be the profit clear,
That you can earn within the year?"
"What in a twelvemonth I can earn,
My lord, was never my concern;
'Tis quite enough," the cobbler said,
"If I can gain my daily bread."
"Take then this note"--'twas twenty pound;
"But sing not with so shrill a sound,
Good man," the generous nabob cries,
"When early to your work you rise;
For then I want to close my eyes."
Delighted to his stall he went:
But now he first felt discontent;
All day he neither work'd nor ate,
For thinking of his happy fate.
At night, when he retir'd to bed,
He plac'd the note beneath his head.
But could not sleep a single wink,
What he should do with it, to think;
And every little noise he heard,
That folks were come to rob him, fear'd.
Living in constant dread to all,
Who did but look towards his stall,
So lean and sallow he was grown,
The man was hardly to be known.
At last he begg'd the lord to see:
"Take back your present, sir," said he,
"Riches, I find, are not for me.
To-morrow I my song renew;
Not less my gratitude to you:
And care henceforward I will take,
My chaunts your slumber do not break."

THE HORSE AND HIS RIDER.


A man a palfrey long possess'd,
A quiet, serviceable beast;
Spavin'd, indeed, and somewhat blind,
But still his way he well could find;
And if he stumbled now and then,
Was soon upon his feet again.
In short, for many a year, the pack
Had borne him safely on his back.
Till riding out one fatal day,
He overheard some coxcombs say,
"For such a man, 'tis quite a shame,
To mount a horse old, blind, and lame."
"Aye," replied one, "I know a steed
Would nobly carry him indeed;
Young, vigorous, beautiful, and sound;
His like is nowhere to be found."
In evil hour an ear he lent,
To view this boasted courser went:
Unwary on his back he got,
And tried to put him on a trot;
He rear'd and plung'd, and leap'd about,
Till from his seat he shook him out,
Then kicking, pitch'd him o'er his head,
And laid him on the pavement dead.
The vicious creature left at large,
On all his fury would discharge;
This from behind his heels surprise,
Trod under foot, that sprawling lies:
Another, who would seize the reins,
Is bit and mangled for his pains.
But want of nourishment and rest
Will tame at last the fiercest beast;
And rage itself suspends its course,
Exhausted by its proper force.
Light'ning no more his eyes inspire,
No more his nostrils snorted fire;
At bay he stood, fatigu'd and lank,
With flagging ears, and beating flank.
An active jockey, stout and able,
Contracts to bring him to the stable;
Soothes, and his neck begins to pat,
And the corn rattles in his hat;
By hunger drawn, repell'd by fear,
The courser neighs, retires, comes near;
Lur'd with the smell, begins to eat.
The jockey vaulted in the seat:
With vigorous hand the bridle plied,
And stuck the rowels in his side.
Some bounds and curvets still he made,
But soon submissively obey'd.
The horseman who such skill had shown,
Resolv'd to keep him for his own:
Aware that constant work alone
Can keep this wicked spirit down
He night and day is on his back,
To lead him to some new attack,
No road is safe, nor far nor near,
This highwayman is every where.

THE GOOD MINISTER.


An honest minister disgrac'd,
(Such are not easily replac'd,)
Found the sweet leisure in his fields,
To virtuous minds retirement yields.
The king, who had his foes believ'd,
The loss of him ere long perceiv'd.
To bring him back again intent,
To his retreat alone he went:
"My friend, you must return with me,"
He said, "your value now I see."
"Forgive me," the Recluse replied;
"Here I determine to abide.
By sad experience well I know,
Were I to court again to go,
And all my best endeavors do,
To serve my country, sir, and you,
Art and intrigue so much prevail,
Again I certainly should fail;
Against your will and approbation,
And the good wishes of the nation,
You'd find yourself compell'd to yield,
And I once more must quit the field."

The honest man, who will not bend
To circumstance, or condescend
To pay his court to knave or fool,
Will never long a nation rule.

THE SWAN AND THE COOK.


A man once had a swan and goose
  Among his birds and beasts.
The one was destined for a pet,
  The other for a feast.
Sometimes you saw them sailing
  Gracefully on the current, side by side,
Sometimes they played a game of tag,
  Or plunged into the tide.
One day the master ordered
  The cook to kill the goose,
And roast it for his dinner;
  It was fat and fit for use.
But the cook had taken a drop too much,
  And it had gone to his head;
So when he went out for the goose
  He took the swan instead.
He seized the swan fast by the throat,
  And would have kill'd it soon:
But the bird saw he was to die,
  And he his throat did tune,
And warbled out his farewell lay.
  The cook straight dropped his knife
In great surprise, "what! what!" cried he,
  "Shall I take the life
Of a musical bird like this?
  No, no! it must not be.
So to the garden he shall go back
  And ne'er be kill'd by me."

THE LYNX AND THE MOLE.


A lynx once met by chance a mole,
Just emerging from his hole.
The lynx with penetrating eye
The beauties of the place did spy,
And asked the mole to take a share
In the fine prospect, rich and rare.
"I've seldom found so good a place.
From this small hill you see a space
Extended far beneath your view,
I like it much; pray do not you?
See now the sun begins to rise,
And with crimson tints the skies.
It spreads all round its genial heat,
And nature now enjoys a treat."
"Well, well!" the mole aloud did cry
"You may see this and more, but I
Can only now before me see,
A very heavy mist." "Truly,
Now," said the lynx, "I clearly see
The difference 'twixt you and me.
My eyes see with perception bright
While your's are always dark as night.
Go to your hold beneath the ground,
While I will range the forest round."

THE OLD CAT AND THE YOUNG
MOUSE.


A young mouse of little experience,
Thought to soften an old cat,
And besought her clemency,
By asking for his life at her expense.
Said he, "A mouse, or e'en a rat,
Is not a great charge on the house;
And I shall not starve out the host.
Besides I seldom quit my post,
And when I do a grain of corn
Has served me since I first was born.
Now I am thin, pray let me be,
I'll serve your children yet, you'll see."
Thus to the cat spoke the poor mouse.
The other answered, "You mistake,
When unto me this tone you take;
You might as well talk to the deaf,
As to so old a cat as I,
And through your tricks I spy,
Die! you can go and chatter to the fates,
My children will be fed on better cates."


MORAL.

Youth is sanguine, and hopes for all:
Old age is pitiless; so says our moral.

THE TWO FRIENDS.


Two real friends lived in Monomotapa,
All that belonged to one was for the other,
And each was unto each a brother.
The people of that country, thus,
Make better friends than among us.
One night when fast asleep,
  They each were sound reposing,
The eldest darted from his couch,
  And stopped the other's dozing.
He runs to see his friend,
Awakes the slaves, and in the end,
Even his friend is quite alarmed,
And goes to seek the other,
With sword and purse. "My brother,
What can the matter be?
Here I am armed, you see,
Ready with sword to fight for you,
And here is money ready too,
If you have lost in play.
You're even welcome to my handsome slave,
With jet black hair, and eyes so grave."
"No!" said the other, "I need naught,
But ere I slept to-night, I thought,
Being in a trance, that you were sad,
And as the thought nigh drove me mad,
I hurried to your tent,
And found you sleeping quite content."


MORAL.

Which of the two best loved the other?
Here is a thing to ponder on.
A true friend is a precious thing,
And all to aid you he will bring,
But with excess of love the other
In dreams was thinking of his brother.

THE SICK STAG.


In a land where stags are many,
One fell sick, and not any
Of all his friends, delayed to come,
To offer aid and consolation,
In his sorrowful situation.
Said he, "My friends, pray let me die
In the right way, nor shed such tears."
Not at all, the consolers,
With many a tear, and many a sigh,
Had come resolved by him to lie;
And when they left they helped themselves
Upon his lands, the greedy elves!
And drank from out his brook,
And every one of them such suppers took,
That when the stag revived,
He found his meals reduced;
So that while his friends had thrived,
He had to fast or die of hunger.

THE FOREST AND THE WOODMAN.


A woodman had broken or misplaced
The wooden handle of his axe,
This loss could not be well replaced.
So master woodman humbly prayed
From all the trees a single branch,
And promised to go elsewhere when he made
Again his livelihood,
And he would touch nor oak nor pine.
The trees which were all very good
Furnished for him new arms,
And soon commenced all their alarms,
And their regret. The axe was mended.
And his repentance all was ended.
The miserable wretch but used it,
E'en as he had before abused it,
By felling down the forest trees,
Which groaned in spirit, and which died,
By arms they had themselves supplied.


MORAL.

This is the way the world goes on,
We use our benefits against our benefactors:
I am tired of speaking thereupon,
Till we obtain our wants, we are good actors.

THE ELEPHANT AND THE MONKEY
OF JUPITER.


Formerly the elephant and the rhinoceros
Disputing on the light of empire
Resolved to end the combat thus--
By fighting to their heart's desire.
The day was fixed, when it was heard,
That the monkey of Sire Jupiter
Had been seen in the air,
Poised on a cloud like any bird.
The elephant was quite convinced
That to arrange the new election,
An interest the god evinced,
And felt for him a great affection,
He went to see the monkey's highness,
Expecting him to speak about the fight,
But not a word said monkey.
At this sight,
The elephant perceived that he must speak himself,
And so began: "Sire Jupiter," said he,
"Between rhinoceros and me will see
A royal combat of legation;
A tournament for all the nation.
I suppose you have already heard
This news!" Said monkey, "Not a word."
The elephant ashamed, and quite surprised,
Looked on the monkey with astonished eyes.
Said monkey, "In celestial place,
A fly or leopard are of equal race."
"Was it not then because of us,"
Said elephant, "that you descended?"
"Nay," said the monkey, quite offended.
"I left the heavens to share a grain of corn
Among some ants, nor knew that you were born.
We have the care of mortal things;
But all are equals in our eyes,
And at your talk I feel surprise."

THE WOODCUTTER AND DEATH.


A woodman was toiling, all covered with dust,
But reach home with his faggot ere night he must,
Panting and weary he walks quite slow,
How to get home he does not know.
At last quite exhausted with toil and trouble,
With the weight of the burden and his years, bent double.
He puts down his faggot, and thinks of his pains,
What is his work, and what are his gains,
How since he came into this weary world,
By the wheels of blind fortune around he's been twirled.
Was he not poor, a wood cutter, at best,
Oft without bread, always without rest.
He thinks of his wife, his children, his taxes,
At last quite warm with the subject he waxes.
He calls on death; who comes without delay,
The woodman, in terror, knows not what to say.
Death asks what to do the man wishes he should.
"Oh, help me," he said, "with this faggot of wood.
My poor bones ache, and my limbs they crack.
So help me to put it upon my back."

THE RAT AND THE OYSTER.


A rat who lived in the field,
  A rat of little wit,
Once grew tired of his father's house,
  And quietly left it.
He left the field, the grain and wheat,
  Set out to travel, left his hole,
And just as soon as he was out,
  "How large and spacious on the whole
Is this great country spread about.
Here are the Apeninnes, and there Caucasus."
The smallest mole hill is a mountain.
At the end of some days our traveller arrives
At a certain canton where every oyster thrives,
And our famed traveller turned very pale,
Thinking he saw great vessels setting sail
"Mercy," said he, "My father was a dunce,
He did not dare to travel even once,
While I have seen already,
The maritime empire,
And travelled to my heart's desire."
From a certain learn'd man,
The rat had heard of such things,
And thinks he has seen all he can.
Among the many oysters closed,
There was one open, which reposed,
Mouth gaping, in the sun,
The learned, travelled man,
The rat, approached, thinking to make
An excellent repast, and began to take
A bite at the fine oyster, plump and fat,
Whereupon closing on our rat,
The oyster caught him tight
And held him with all its might.


MORAL.

This fable goes to show,
That those mistake,
Who think that all they know:
When knowing nothing of the world,
Their giddy brain is quickly whirled.
And hence this moral let us make,
That he is caught, who thinks to take.

THE PHYSICIANS.


Dr. So-much-the-worse went out to see
A patient sick as one could be.
His brother So-much-the-better,
Having received an urgent letter,
Came also the sick man to visit.
So-much-the-worse declared he'd die,
So-much-the-better asked him why.
And while their plans they thus discourse,
The sick man died, _so much the worse_!
So-much-the-better now declared,
That if the sick man had not despaired,
He would have lived. So-much-the-worse
Said, "I was right, agree with me,
Our patient's dead, as you can see."

There's wisdom in the saying, by my troth,
Too many cooks will spoil the broth.

THE MOUNTAIN IN LABOR.


A mountain thought to be in labor,
Made such a horrid noise,
That round it each stranger came and neighbor,
Thinking the end of all this noise would be
A city, quite as large as three.
Having drawn all the province round,
The mountain from a little mound,
Let out a mouse.


MORAL.

When I think upon this fable,
Of which the narration is false,
And the sense true;
It puts me much in mind
Of authors not a few,
Who boast that they are able
To write on any subject as they please,
And after all--do nothing.

THE CAT METAMORPHOSED INTO
A WOMAN.


A man was passionately fond of his cat,
He thought she was pretty, and sleek, and all that;
And she purred in the softest tone,
He wished to make her his own.
This man by prayers, by tears,
  By sorcery and charms,
Changed pussy to a woman fair,
  And took her in his arms.
But in the wainscot soon a rat
  Made itself manifest,
And very soon the pussy cat,
  Could still no longer rest.
Her foolish husband who believed
  That nothing had of cat remained,
And as his wife had her received--
  Was, now, I warrant, somewhat pained.
Next time the vermin came,
Pussy was surer of her game--
  For having changed her face,
The mice not frightened,
  Did not change their pace--
And the astonished spouse
  Was very glad--
To change her back--
  And was no more cat-mad.


MORAL.

What in the bone is born,
  Will in the flesh remain,
Both night and morn,
  And ne'er come out again.

THE FROG AND THE RAT.


He who another thinks to injure,
May in the end destroy himself.

A rat who fed exceeding well,
Was by a frog invited out to dine;
"The voyage," said froggy, "will be quickly made,
If you will tie your foot to mine."
Frog vaunted the delight of bathing,
Praised the varieties they'd met upon the way,
And when the rat consented to be tied,
Attempted to bear him away.
The rat half drowned resisted all he could.
The frog, imaged the dinner he would make;
Suddenly, flying from a neighboring wood,
A hawk appeared, and quickly did he take
Both of the combatants up in his bill,
Before they e'en had time to make their will;
And quite delighted did the greedy sinner
Make off of fish and flesh a hearty dinner.
For in the hawk's dominions, fast days
Are never kept.
Now if the frog had acted as he ought,
And had not tried to dine off the poor rat,
They would not both have perished,
To make fat,
A pampered hawk;
And master rat,
Had he not been so curious about
Aquatic government,
Had from the scrape got safely out.


MORAL.

A scheme or a conspiracy,
Be it all plotted well
As safe, 'twould seem as it could be,
And sure of all success,
May, none the less,
Entirely fail,
And grand conspirators,
And all bewail,
The day that set them scheming.

THE LION AND THE FLY.


A lion by a gad-fly worried,
Half maddened by his sting,
Exclaimed, "Be off, vile fly--
Mean, pitiful, base thing!"
After the fly had ended his repast,
Fully exhausted feels the beast at last,
And roared so that he shook the earth,
While the victorious fly
Met in the spider's web his destiny.


MORAL.

Two morals draw I from this tale:
  First, We should fear the smallest enemy;
And second, We may escape great perils,
  And from a trifling cause may die.

THE TWO MULES.


Two mules went travelling on their way,
  One with a sack of corn;
The other with gold and bells so gay,
  Most gaily tripped along.
Proud of so rich a load,
  He kept the bells a ringing--
And was so proud, had he known how
  He would have commenced singing.
Soon some robbers rude appeared,
  Who stopped this mule upon his road,
And very soon they had him cleared
  Of all his weight of precious gold.
Falling beneath their blows, "I die,"
  The expiring trotter cried,
"Had you been," said the other,
  "Low as I, you would not thus have died."

Be moderate when you are high,
Nor glory o'er the passers by.

JUPITER AND THE FARMER.


Jupiter had a farm to let,
Mercury advertised it, and people came,
Made offers, listened, all the same,
Made some objection.
One declared the land
Was rough and dry,
And full of sand.
One had this reason, one had that,
Until at last a man appeared,
Who said he'd try to farm it, agreed that
He might have any weather that he chose.

Behold! as soon as he but yawns, it blows
Or rains, or is quite clear.
His neighbors, even the most near,
Are not affected by these changes.
In usual route, their weather ranges;
They have good crops,
But he had none.
At last when tired, he began
Complaining unto Jupiter.
The next year the same thing,
Changes of weather he can bring--
And the neighbors no more
Than the Americans,
Are troubled by the farming
Of his lands.
At last tired out, with all his strife in vain,
He yields his power to the God of rain;
Acknowledging, that all along
The god did right,
And he did wrong.


MORAL.

Let us conclude that Providence
For man ordains much better than we can.

THE COCK, THE CAT, AND THE
LITTLE MOUSE.


A young mouse, who had nothing seen,
Was nearly caught; You shall hear how
He told his mother the adventure--
He said, "Pray, listen, now:
I started out to frolic at a venture,
When two fine animals appeared
Before my eyes,
And filled me with surprise.
One was soft, benign, and sweet,
The other, turbulent, and full of inquietude,
Had a loud voice, piercing and rude,
And on his head a piece of flesh.
A sort of arm raised him up in the air,
As though to fly out of a mesh--
His tail was spread out like a fan."
Now it was a cock of which our little mouse,
Made to his mother this fine picture,
Describing him like an enthusiast.
"He beat," said he, "his flanks,
With his two arms,
Making such a noise and such a din,
That, frightened half to death,
I hurried in.
Although I pique myself upon my courage
And heartily I cursed him in my heart,
For but for him, I'd taken part,
In conversation with the gentle creature,
Who my advances would encourage.
She is velvety, like us, with a long tail,
A modest look, and sparkling eyes,
And is much like a rat. She spies
The objects round her. I turned pale
On hearing the other creature's din,
Or else I should have asked her in."
"My child," said the mother, "this last was a cat,
An enemy of every mouse and rat.
The other a cock, whom do not fear,
Perhaps we may dine on him here."

Take care, whatever they may seem,
Of judging people by their mien.

THE MONKEY.


The animals, on the death of the lion,
  During his life, prince of the country,
Resolved to elect a king to try on
  The regal crown, and chose a monkey.
Because after the animals had all
Tried on the regal crown, or let it fall,
Because their heads were all too big,
Or too small, too horned, or too thick,
The monkey slipped through it;
And with it cut up many a trick,
Which they all thought refined,
And chose him with one mind.
Only the fox regretted the election,
And swore to reign in his defection.
He came and made his compliment;
"Sire," said he, "I know a treasure meant
For your high majesty. I will show
The spot where it lies hid."
The monkey went at Reynard's bid--
And was caught in a trap.
The fox exclaimed,
"How do you think to govern us,
When, after all, with all your fuss,
You cannot well, do what you may,
Keep e'en yourself out of harm's way."
The animals agreed,
That royal power suits very few indeed.

THE HORSE AND THE ASS.


An ass accompanied by a horse uncourteous,
Who only had his harness on his back;
And the poor jackass staggered
'Neath the load of vegetable and a pack;
He begged the horse to help him,
If he could--
But not a single bit,
The other would.
"I ask," said the poor beast,
"A little pity--
Help me at least,
To reach the city."
The horse refused,
And got his due,
For the ass died.
The farmer's man
Stripped off the skin of honest Ben,
And made the horse, whom they espied,
Drag on the skin and the cart beside.


MORAL.

'Tis wise to lend our aid
  To others in distress,
We often thus are made
  The means of happiness.
The churlish, unkind man
  His neighbor's death may cause,
And have to help his family,
  Through taxes and the laws.

THE ASTROLOGER WHO FELL
INTO A WELL.


An astrologer, of high ambition,
While star-gazing fell down
Into a well. "Sage gentleman,"
Remarked the people of the town,
"How did you think to read the stars, old man,
When you cannot preserve your own position."
This adventure in itself, without going further,
Might serve as a lesson, to most of mankind,
For of us mortals, a certain part inclines,
To the belief, that, with the help of mind,
The book of Destiny may easily be read,
But this book, by Homer and his disciples sung,
What is it called but _Chance_, by ancients,
And by us Christians named Providence instead.
Now in Chance there can no science be,
Or why should it be called by them _Chance_--
And things uncertain, who knows in advance?
If all depends upon the fixed decree,
Of Him who does all things, and nothing does unwisely.
How should we read his will,
And know that which from us he would conceal?
Wherefore watch the stars so nicely,
To know how to avoid inevitable woe;
Or how, in future times, our fate will go;
To make us, in the midst of pleasure, sad,
Or with predicted evil, drive us mad,
Convert all blessings into curses dire?
Is this the knowledge to which we aspire,
Is it an error or a crime thus to believe
That future destiny can thus be known?
In place of star-gazing above our head,
Let us confide ourselves to the Great One.
The firmament exists, the stars go on their way,
And the sun shines upon us every day;
And every day, the day is lost in night,
Without our knowing aught else from the sight.
That the seasons come, the crops are ripe,
And in what wood we should look out for snipe,
And some few other things, but for the change
Of day to night, by which the world doth range,
It has not aught to do with Destiny.
Quacks, and ye compilers of horoscopes,
Quit all the courts of princes in Europe,
And take with you all mischief makers

You deserve belief no more than they do.


MORAL.

This astrologer in the well,
Resembles all of his false art,
Who while they are in danger, dream
That in the stars, they read the happiest theme.

THE ANIMALS SICK WITH THE
PLAGUE.


A scourge which spread terror,
Invented by heaven to punish earth--
The plague (if to name it be no error)
Was making every animal
To curse his birth.
In one day it might have enriched Acheron,
And upon beasts made busy war.
Amongst them all there was not one,
But, sick and ailing, was complaining sore;
All did not die, but each was ill--
Not one strove now to eat his fill,
No meat excited them to taste,
Nor did the wolves again lay waste,
The innocent prey.
Even the doves fled from each other,
And cooed no more the live-long day.
The lion held war counsel--"My brother,"
Said he, addressing each in turn,
"I think that heaven hath allowed
This punishment on us to fall
For the sins we have disavowed.
Now I for one will confess all,
And let him who is most to blame,
Be slaughtered in the others' name.
Perhaps he may obtain a common cure,
For history tells us that in like cases,
The guilty die in others' places;
Let us not then be false to Nature,
Let us confess our faults--in fine
I will the first acknowledge mine;
And I avow, that oft I keep
A serious tax on harmless sheep.
What had they done,
In naught offended--
Yet I their quiet lives have ended.
Sometimes, with sorrow be it heard,
I e'en have eaten the shepherd,
And I acknowledge all--
And I will die like a quiet bird--
If my death keep you from your fall.
It must be hoped now in all justice,
That he who is most guilty perish."
"Sire," said the fox, "you are too good a king
To die for any trivial thing;
Your simples are too nice.
Eat sheep, and why not?
Is it a sin? is it a vice?
No, sire, you did them honor;
And as for shepherds, I desire,
That over us their false empire
Should cease, and we have all we want
Of sheep and fleece."
So said the fox, flatterers applaud,
The tiger, bear, and other powers they laud,
Even for their most violent offence.
All quarrelsome people,
Down to the mastiffs,
Were little saints.
But when the donkey's turn came on,
They heard him with many ifs.
He said, "I now remember
That by a monk's garden passing,
(It was late in December,
And my strength soon faints,)
I ate a leaf of some dry plant,
And e'en now I with terror pant."
They seized upon him and devoured,
And said he was the cause
Of heaven's anger being lowered.

With interested judges, _right_
Is always on the side of _might_.

THE CANDLE.


It was in the home of the Olympian gods,
That bees first lodged, 'tis said,
On Mount Hymettus; and thitherwards
Came zephyrs with light tread.
When from the hives, the honey,
Had all been taken out,
As there remained naught but wax,
Some candles were, for money,
Carefully made and sold in packs.
One of these candles on a certain day
Seeing that clay by fire was turned to brick,
Thought he could harden his body the same;
And getting near the fire to try the trick,
This new Empedocles to flame condemned
Soon found of his philosophy the end.

THE HOG, THE GOAT, AND THE
SHEEP.


A goat, a sheep, and a fat hog,
On the same cart were bound for the fair.
They lay as quietly as any log,
But were not seeking their amusement there.
They were to be sold, so says the story.
The carter, who his business knows,
Don't take them into town to see the _shows_.
Dame porker was inclined to squeal,
As though the butcher's knife she 'gan to feel.
Her grunts, and squeals, and cries
Were loud enough to deafen one,
The other animals more wise,
And better tempered, with surprise
Exclaimed, "have done!"
The carter to the porker turned,
"Where have you manners learned,
Why stun us all? Do you not see
That you're the noisiest of the three?
That sheep says not a word,
Nor can the young goat's voice be heard."
"But," said the hog, "they both are fools.
If like me they knew their fate,
They'd halloo out at greater rate,
The goat will only lose her milk,
The sheep his wool, but here, poor me,
I'm to be eaten, and know my destiny."
The porker was quite right,
But hallooing with all her might,
Was all too late,
And could not alter her sad fate.

THE DELICATE HERON.


By the bank of a river,
  A heron walked out,
And in it were sporting,
  Pike, mackerel and trout.

Now these fish with great ease,
  Our bird might have caught,
But I'll wait till I'm hungry
  The silly bird thought.

At last came his appetite,
  "Now I'll eat," the bird cries,
And some tench from the bottom,
  Just then he saw rise.

"But these are not good enough
  At this time of day,"
And he waited for better
  Till all swam away.

At eve almost starved
  When all other means fail,
He was right glad to sup
  On a poor little snail.

THE BLACKAMOOR AND HER
MISTRESS.


A foolish young lady,
  Took one of her maids,
Who chanced to be black
  As the ace of spades,
And said she'd have her washed white,
  By the other maids;
She was put in a tub,
  And with water and towels
Her skin they did rub,
  Through a long summer day till the night;
But the more they did rub her,
  The blacker she got;
And while they did scrub her,
  She mourned her hard lot.
So the maids threw away
  All their labor and care,
And the mistress gave up
  Her fine scheme in despair.

THE BEAR AND THE GARDENER.


A bear and gardener,
  Who mutually tired
Of solitary life,
  And were inspired,
With a warm friendship for each other,
Promised to be to one another,
Excellent friends, and so they were.
As for the death of the poor man
I'll tell you how it happened,
If I can.
The bear watching the gardener in his sleep--
Beholding on his head a fly,
And thinking it bad company,
Took up a stone and dropped it down,
Upon the fly 'tis true,
But broke the gardener's crown.

A most malignant enemy

THE VULTURES AND THE
PIGEONS.


The wing'd inhabitants of air
Waged on a time a direful war.
Not those, in budding groves who sing,
To usher in the amorous spring;
Nor those, with Venus' car who fly
Through the light clouds and yielding sky
But the rapacious vulture brood,
With crooked beak that thirsts for blood,
And iron fangs. Their war, 'tis said,
For a dog's carrion corse was made.
Shrill shrieks resound from shore to shore;
The earth beneath is sanguin'd o'er;
Versed in the science to destroy,
Address and valor they employ.
'Twould take a hundred tongues to tell,
The heroes from the air who fell.
The dovecote race, a gentle nation,
Made offers of their mediation.
Prudent ambassadors are sent;
The vultures with the terms content,
Agree their guarantee to take,
And armistice and treaty make.
This kind desire to interfere,
Cost the poor peace-makers full dear.
To rapine bred, the ruthless crew,
Nor gratitude nor faith who knew,
On the defenceless pigeons fall,
And shortly had devoured them all.


MORAL.

When tyrants from their quarrels cease,
Some weaker neighbor pays their peace.
His safety in their warfare lies;
Their feuds, not he should compromise.
When Joseph, Frederick, and Kate,
Tired of unprofitable hate,
Their animosities would heel,
They swallowed Poland at a meal.

THE BEAR AND THE BEES.


A bear once rambled from his home,
Chanced through a garden trim to roam,
Where, 'neath the shelter of the trees,
The farmer had his hives of bees.
Bruin loved honey. "Now," said he,
"I'll rob your store-house, Master Bee.
You'll buz, and hum about my ears,
But noise a brave bear never fears."
So saying, bear o'erturns a hive,
And straight the air is all alive,
With angry enemies, who sting
As well as buz; and make bear sing,
A lively tune of growls and roars,
And cover him with smarting sores.

STORIES OF THE OCEAN.




VOLNEY BECKNER.


The white sharks are the dread of sailors in all hot climates, for they
constantly attend vessels in expectation of anything which may be thrown
overboard. A shark will thus sometimes traverse the ocean in company
with a ship for several hundred leagues. Woe to the poor mariner who
may chance to fall overboard while this sea-monster is present.

Some species of sharks grow to an enormous size, often weighing from one
to four thousand pounds each. The skin of the shark is rough, and is
used for polishing wood, ivory, &c.; that of one species is manufactured
into an article called _agreen_: spectacle-cases are made of it. The
white shark is the sailor's worst enemy: he has five rows of
wedge-shaped teeth, which are notched like a saw: when the animal is at
rest they are flat in his mouth, but when about to seize his prey they
are erected by a set of muscles which join them to the jaw. His mouth is
so situated under the head that he is obliged to turn himself on one
side before he can grasp any thing with those enormous jaws.

I will now give you an account of the death of a very brave little boy,
who was killed by a shark. He was an Irish boy; his name was Volney
Beckner, the son of a poor fisherman. His father, having always intended
Volney for a seafaring life, took great pains to teach him such things
as it is useful for a sailor to know, and tried to make him brave and
hardy; he taught him to swim when a mere baby.

[Illustration: VOLNEY BECKNER'S FIRST VOYAGE.]

Volney was only nine years old when he first went to sea in a merchant
ship; the same vessel in which his father sometimes sailed. Here he
worked hard and fared hard, but this gave him no uneasiness; his frame
was robust, he never took cold, he knew not what fear was.

[Illustration: VOLNEY BECKNER AT SEA.]

In the most boisterous weather, when the rain fell in torrents, and the
wind howled around the ship, the little Irish boy would fearlessly and
cheerfully climb the stays and sailyards, mount the topmast, or perform
any other duty required of him. At twelve years old the captain promoted
the clever, good tempered, and trustworthy boy; spoke well of him before
the whole crew, and doubled his pay.

Volney was very sensible to his praises. His messmates loved him for his
generous nature, and because he had often shown himself ready to brave
danger in order to assist them; but an occasion soon arrived in which he
had an opportunity of performing one of the most truly heroic deeds on
record.

The vessel in which Volney and his father sailed was bound to Port au
Prince, in St. Domingo. A little girl, the daughter of one of the
passengers, having slipped away from her nurse, ran on deck to amuse
herself. While gazing on the expanse of water, the heaving of the vessel
made her dizzy, and she fell overboard.

Volney's father saw the accident, darted after her, and quickly caught
her by the dress; but while with one hand he swam to reach the ship, and
with the other held the child, he saw a shark advancing towards them. He
called aloud for help; there was no time to lose, yet none dared to
afford him any. No one, did I say? Yes, little Volney, prompted by
filial love, ventured on a deed which strong men dared not attempt.

Armed with a broad, sharp sabre, he threw himself into the sea, then
diving like a fish under the shark, he stabbed the weapon into his body
up to the hilt. Thus wounded the shark quitted his prey, and turned on
the boy, who again and again attacked him with the sabre, but the
struggle was too unequal; ropes were quickly thrown from the deck to the
father and son; each succeeded in grasping one, and loud rose the cry of
joy, "They are saved!" Not so! The shark, enraged at seeing that he was
about to be altogether disappointed of his prey, made one desperate
spring, and tore asunder the body of the noble-hearted little boy, while
his father and the fainting child in his arms were saved.


[Illustration: THE POULTRY BASKET--A LIFE-PRESERVER.]




THE POULTRY BASKET--A LIFE-PRESERVER.


I will tell you an old story of an incident which occurred many years
ago, but perhaps it may be new to you, and please you as much as it did
me when I was a little girl, and used to sit on my grandpapa's knee, and
listen to this tale among many others.

The hero of my story was a countryman; you may, if you please, fancy his
neat white cottage on the hill-side, with its rustic porch, all
overgrown with jasmine, roses, and clematis; the pretty garden and
orchard belonging to it, with the snug poultry yard, the shed for the
cow, and the stack of food for winter's use on one side.

[Illustration: THE POULTRY YARD.]

You may fancy the pleasure of the little children who lived at this
cottage in going with their mother morning and evening to feed the
poultry; the noise and bustle among the feathered tribe at this time;
how some rudely push before and peck the others in their anxiety to
obtain the first grains that fall from the basket, and how the little
children take care that the most greedy shall not get it all; their joy
at seeing the young broods of tiny chicks covered with downy feathers,
and the anxiety of the hens each to protect her own from danger, and
teach them to scratch and pick up food for themselves; while they never
forget to admire and praise the beauty of the fine old cock, as he
struts about with an air of magnificence, like the very king of the
guard.

  "High was his comb, and coral red withal,
  In dents embattled like a castle wall;
  His bill was raven-black and shone like jet,
  Blue were his legs, and orient were his feet;
  White were his nails, like silver to behold!
  His body glittering like burnished gold."

If you had been there, you would have wished to visit the little
orchard; to see the gentle cow, and the geese feeding on the common
beyond; to watch the young ducklings, dipping and ducking and enjoying
their watering sport in the pond.

If it be spring, the children would delight in gathering the
sweet-scented meadow flowers--the water ranunculus, with its golden
cups, the modest daisy, the pink cuckoo-flower, and the yellow cowslips;
while overhead the bees kept up a constant humming; they have found
their way from the straw hives in the garden and are diving into the
delicious blossoms of the apple and cherry trees, robbing many a one of
its sweets.

[Illustration: THE BEE HIVE.]

But now to my history of what did really happen to a countryman, who
very likely lived in such a pretty cottage as I have described.

He had more poultry in his yard than he needed for his own use; some of
them had been fatted for sale; and wishing to turn them into money, he
left his home, which was near Bristol, with a basket full of them on his
arm. Having reached the river, he went on board the ferry boat,
intending to go across to a place called Bristol Hot-Wells. Many gentle
folks visit this spot for the sake of drinking the waters of the wells,
which are thought to be very beneficial in some complaints; and no doubt
our countryman hoped that among them his poultry would fetch a good
price.

The ferry boat was nearly half way over the river, when, by some
accident, the poor man lost his footing and fell into the stream; he
could not swim, and the current carried him more than a hundred yards
from the boat; but he kept fast hold of his poultry basket, which being
buoyant, supported him until he was perceived, and rescued by some men
in a fishing-smack.

I hope he reached the Hot-Wells in safety after all, and sold his
poultry for as much as he expected; and, what is still better, that his
heart was filled with gratitude to God for his preservation from danger
so imminent.

[Illustration: THE LIFE BOAT.]




THE LIFE BOAT.


Oh what a stirring scene is this! see how the brave fellows are pulling
with their oars, and endeavoring with all their might to reach the ship
in distress before it is too late! Well, I suppose you are curious to
know how an open boat like this can float in such an angry, boiling sea.
I will tell you how it is accomplished; the sides of the boat are lined
with hollow boxes of copper, which being perfectly air-tight, render her
buoyant, even when full of water, or loaded to the very water's edge.

The originator of this simple and beautiful contrivance was a London
coach maker, named Lionel Lukin, a man whose benevolent feelings flowed
towards all his fellow men, but more especially towards that portion of
them who brave the dangers of the sea. After devoting sixty years of his
life to the pursuits of his business, he retired to Hythe in Kent, where
he finished a well-spent life in peace and tranquility, dying in
February, 1834. His body was interred in the churchyard of Hythe, which
is situated on rising ground, commanding a fine view of the ocean; a fit
resting place for the remains of one whose talents had been successfully
directed to the means of rescuing from shipwreck and a watery grave many
hundreds, or perhaps we may say many thousands, of poor seamen. He
obtained a patent for his first boat in 1785.

The two sailors in the picture below are Greenwich pensioners,
supported, you know, at Greenwich Hospital, which was founded by Charles
II. for superannuated or wounded sailors. They are smoking their pipes,
and discussing the merits of the Life Boat.

[Illustration: THE WHALE.]




WHALE FISHING.


The whale is the largest of all known animals. There are three kinds of
whale; the Greenland, called by the sailors the right whale, as being
most highly prized by them; the great northern rorqual, called by
fishers the razor-back or finner, and the cachalot or spermaciti whale.
The common whale measures from sixty to seventy feet in length: the
mouth, when open, is large enough to admit a ship's jolly boat, with all
her men in it. It contains no teeth; and enormous as the creature is,
the opening to the throat is very narrow, not more than an inch and a
half across in the largest whale.

[Illustration: WHALE FISHING]

Instead of teeth the mouth of the whale is furnished with a curious
framework of a substance called _baleen_; you will know it by the name
of whalebone; it is arranged in rows, and projects beyond the lips in a
hanging fringe; the food of the whale consists of shrimps, small fishes,
sea-snails, and innumerable minute creatures, called medusae, which are
found in those seas where the whales feed in such vast quantities that
they make the water of a deep green or olive color.

When feeding the whale swims with open mouth under the water, and all
the objects which lie in the way of that great moving cavern are caught
by the baleen, and never seen again. Along with their food they swallow
a vast quantity of water, which passes back again through the nostrils,
and is collected into a bag placed at the external orifice of the cavity
of the nose, whence it is expelled by the pressure of powerful muscles
through a very narrow opening pierced in the top of the head.

[Illustration: THE CACHALOT]

In this way it spouts the water in beautiful jets from twenty to thirty
feet in height. The voice of the whale is like a low murmuring: it has a
smooth skin all over its body, under which lies that thick lard which
yields the oil for which they are so much sought. The Greenland whale
has but two side-fins; its tail is in the shape of a crescent; it is an
instrument of immense power; it has been sometimes known with one stroke
to hurl large boats high into the air, breaking them into a thousand
fragments. The whale shows great affection for her young, which is
called the calf; the fishermen well know this, and turn it to their own
account; they try to strike the young with the harpoon, which is a
strong, barbed instrument, and if they do this they are almost sure of
securing the mother also, as nothing will induce her to leave it.

Mr. Scorseby, who was for a long time engaged in the whale fishery, has
written a book containing a very interesting account of them. He
mentions a case in which a young whale was struck beside its dam. She
instantly seized and darted off with it, but not until the line had been
fixed to its body. In spite of all that could be done to her, she
remained near her dying little one, till she was struck again and again,
and thus both perished. Sometimes, however, on an occasion like this,
the old whale becomes furious, and then the danger to the men is very
great, as they attack the whale in boats, several of which belong to
each ship.

A number of these boats once made towards a whale, which, with her calf
was playing round a group of rocks. The old whale perceiving the
approaching danger, did all she could to warn her little one of it, till
the sight became quite affecting. She led it away from the boats, swam
round it, embraced it with her fins, and sometimes rolled over with it
in the waves.

The men in the boats now rowed a-head of the whales, and drove them back
among the rocks, at which the mother evinced great uneasiness and
anxiety; she swam round and round the young one in lessening circles;
but all her care was unheeded, and the inexperienced calf soon met its
fate. It was struck and killed, and a harpoon fixed in the mother, when,
roused to reckless fury, she flew on one of the boats, and made her tail
descend with such tremendous force on the very centre of it, as to cut
it in two, and kill two of the men, the rest swimming in all directions
for their lives.

[Illustration: A SHIP TOWED TO LAND BY BULLOCKS.]




SHIP TOWED TO LAND BY BULLOCKS


Swimming is a manly exercise, and one in which, under proper care, every
little boy ought to be instructed. In the first place it is a very
healthy and invigorating practice frequently to immerse the body in
water: and when we recollect how often the knowledge of this art has
been blessed by the Supreme Disposer of events as a means of saving his
rational creatures from sudden death, it seems that to neglect this
object is almost to refuse to avail ourselves of one of the means of
safety, which a kind Providence has placed within our reach.

Only imagine yourself to be, as many before you have been, in a
situation of pressing danger on the sea, and yet at no great distance
from the land, so that you might hope to reach it by swimming, but to
remain on board the vessel appeared certain death, how thankful you
would then feel to your friends if they had put this means of escape
into your power! Or if you were to see some unfortunate fellow-creature
struggling in the water, and about to disappear from your sight, how
willingly, if conscious of your own power to support yourself, would you
plunge into the water to his rescue! and how would your heart glow with
delight if your efforts to save him should prove successful!

Here is a picture representing the very remarkable preservation of the
crew of a vessel on the coast of Newfoundland. In this instance man
availed himself of the instinct which ever prompts the brute creation to
self-preservation. The ship was freighted with live cattle; in a
dreadful storm she was dismasted, and became a mere wreck. The crew
being unable to manage her, it occurred to the captain, whose name was
Drummond, as a last resort, to attach some ropes to the horns of some of
the bullocks, and turn them into the sea. This was done, the bullocks
swam towards land and towed the ship to the shore. Thus the lives of the
crew were saved.




THE SINKING OF THE ROYAL GEORGE.


The Royal George was an old ship; she had seen much service. Her build
was rather short and high, but she sailed well, and carried the tallest
masts and squarest canvas of any of England's gun-ships. She had just
returned from Spithead, where there were twenty or thirty ships of war,
called a fleet, lying under command of Lord Howe. It was on the 29th of
August, 1782. She was lying off Portsmouth; her decks had been washed
the day before, and the carpenter discovered that the pipes which
admitted water to cleanse the ship was worn out, and must be replaced.
This pipe being three feet under the water, it was needful to heel, or
lay the ship a little on one side. To do this, the heavy guns on the
larboard side were run out of the port-holes (those window-like openings
which you see in the side of the vessel) as far as they would go, and
the guns on the starboard side were drawn up and secured in the middle
of the deck; this brought the sills of the port-holes on the lowest side
nearly even with the water.

[Illustration: SINKING OF THE ROYAL GEORGE.]

Just as the crew had finished breakfast, a vessel called the Lark came
on the low side of the ship to unship a cargo of rum; the casks were put
on board on that side, and this additional weight, together with that of
the men employed in unloading, caused the ship to heel still more on one
side; every wave of the sea now washed in at her port-holes, and thus
she had soon so great a weight of water in her hold, that slowly and
almost imperceptibly she sank still further down on her side. Twice, the
carpenter, seeing the danger, went on board to ask the officer on duty
to order the ship to be righted; and if he had not been a proud and
angry man, who would not acknowledge himself to be in the wrong, all
might yet have been well.

The plumbers had almost finished their work, when a sudden breeze blew
on the raised side of the ship, forced her still further down, and the
water began to pour into her lower port-holes. Instantly the danger
became apparent; the men were ordered to right the ship: they ran to
move the guns for this purpose, but it was _too late_.

In a minute or two more, she fell quite over on her side, with her masts
nearly flat on the water, and the Royal George sank to the bottom,
before one signal of distress could be given! By this dreadful accident,
about nine hundred persons lost their lives; about two hundred and
thirty were saved, some by running up the rigging, and being with others
picked up by the boats which put off immediately from other vessels to
their assistance. There were many visitors, women and little children on
board at the time of the accident.




BLOWING UP OF THE ROYAL GEORGE.


At the time when the dreadful event which I have just related to you
occurred, the Lark sloop, which brought the cargo of rum, was lying
alongside of the Royal George; in going down, the main-yard of the Royal
George caught the boom of the Lark, and they sank together, but this
made the position of the Royal George much more upright in the water
than it would otherwise have been. There she lay at the bottom of the
sea, just as you have seen small vessels when left by the tide on a
bank. Cowper, when he heard the sad tale, thus wrote

  "Her timbers yet are sound,
    And she may float again,
  Full charged with England's thunder,
    And plough the distant main.

  "But Kempenfelt is gone,
    His victories are o'er,
  And he, and his eight hundred
    Shall plough the wave no more."

Admiral Kempenfelt was writing in his cabin when the ship sank; his
first captain tried to inform him of their situation, but the heeling of
the ship so jammed the cabin doors that he could not open them: thus the
admiral perished with the rest. It seems Cowper thought the Royal George
might be recovered; other people were of the same opinion.

[Illustration: BLOWING UP OF THE ROYAL GEORGE.]

In September of the year in which the vessel sank, a gentleman, named
Tracey, living in the neighborhood, by means of diving-machines,
ascertained the position and state of the ship, and made proposals to
government to adopt means of raising her and getting her again afloat.
After a great many vexatious delays and interruptions on the part of
those who were to have supplied him with assistance, he succeeded in
getting up the Lark sloop. His efforts to raise the Royal George were so
far successful, that at every time of high tide she was lifted from her
bed; and on the 9th of October she was hove at least thirty or forty
feet to westward; but the days were getting short, the boisterous winds
of winter were setting in, the lighters to which Tracey's apparatus was
attached were too old and rotten to bear the strain, and he was forced
to abandon the attempt.

The sunken ship remained, a constant impediment to other vessels wishing
to cast anchor near the spot, for nearly fifty years, when Colonel
Pasley, by means of gunpowder, completely demolished the wreck: the
loose pieces of timber floated to the surface; heavier pieces--the
ship's guns, cables, anchors, the fire-hearth, cooking utensils, and
many smaller articles were recovered by the divers. These men went down
in Indian-rubber dresses, which were air and water-tight; they were
furnished with helmets, in each side of which were glass windows, to
admit light, and supplied with air by means of pipes, communicating with
an air-pump above. By these means they could remain under water more
than an hour at a time. I do not think you are old enough to understand
the nature of Colonel Pasley's operations. Large hollow vessels, called
cylinders, were filled with gunpowder, and attached by the divers to the
wreck, these were connected by conducting wires with a battery on board
a lighter above, at a sufficient distance to be out of reach of danger
when the explosion took place. Colonel Pasley then gave the word to fire
the end of the rod; instantly a report was heard, and those who
witnessed the explosions, say that the effect was very beautiful. On
one occasion, the water rose in a splendid column above fifty feet high,
the spray sparkling like diamonds in the sun; then the large fragments
of the wreck came floating to the surface; soon after the mud from the
bottom, blackening the circle of water, and spreading to a great
distance around; and with it rose to the surface great numbers of fish,
who, poor things, had found a hiding-place in the wreck, but were
dislodged and killed by the terrible gunpowder.

LOSS OF THE MELVILLE CASTLE.


Many and great are the dangers to which those who lead a seafaring life
are exposed. The lightning's flash may strike a ship when far away from
port, upon the trackless deep, or the sudden bursting of a particular
kind of cloud, called a waterspout, may overwhelm her, and none be left
to tell her fate. But of all the perils to which a ship is liable, I
think that of her striking on a sand-bank, or on sunken rocks is the
greatest. There must be men and women now living on the Kentish coast,
in whose memory the disastrous wreck of the Melville Castle, with all
its attendant horrors, is yet fresh. It is a sorrowful tale, doubly so,
inasmuch as acts of imprudence, and still worse, of obstinacy, may be
said to have occasioned the loss of four hundred and fifty lives.

In the first place, the Melville Castle, or as I suppose we should call
her the Vryheid, was in a very decayed state; she had been long in the
East India Company's service, and was by them sold to some Dutch
merchants, who had her upper works tolerably repaired, new sheathed and
coppered her, and resold her to the Dutch government, who were then in
want of a vessel to carry out troops and stores to Batavia.

The Melville Castle was accordingly equipped for the voyage, painted
throughout, and her name changed to the Vryheid. On the the morning of
November, 1802, she set sail from the Texel, a port on the coast of
Holland, with a fair wind, which lasted till early on the following day,
when a heavy gale came on in an adverse direction.

The captain immediately had the top-gallant masts and yards struck to
make her ride more easily; but as the day advanced, the violence of the
wind increased, and vain seemed every effort of the crew to manage the
ship. There were many mothers and little children on board, whose state
was truly pitiable. The ship was scourged onward by the resistless
blast, which continued to increase until it blew a perfect hurricane.

About three in the afternoon, the mainmast fell overboard, sweeping
several of the crew into the sea, and severely injuring four or five
more. By this time they were near enough to the Kentish coast to discern
objects on land, but the waves which rolled mountains high prevented the
possibility of any help approaching. By great exertion the ship was
brought to anchor in Hythe Bay, and for a few moments hope cheered the
bosoms of those on board; it was _but_ a few, for almost immediately
she was found to have sprung a leak; and while all hands were busy at
the pumps, the storm came on with increased fury.

In this dismal plight they continued till about six o'clock the
following morning, when the ship parted from one of her largest anchors,
and drifted on towards Dymchurch-wall, about three miles to the west of
Hythe. This wall is formed by immense piles, and cross pieces of timber,
supported by wooden jetties, which stretch far into the sea. It was
built to prevent the water from overflowing a rich, level district,
called Romney Marsh.

The crew continued to fire guns and hoist signals of distress. At
daybreak a pilot boat put off from Dover, and nearing the Melville
Castle, advised the captain to put back to Deal or Hythe, and wait for
calmer weather, or, said the boatman, "all hands will assuredly be
lost." But the captain would not act on his recommendation; he thought
the pilot boat exaggerated the danger, hoped the wind would abate as
the day opened, and that he should avoid the demands of the Dover pilot
or the Down fees by not casting anchor there. Another help the captain
rejected, and bitterly did he lament it when it was too late.

No sooner had the pilot boat departed, than the commodore at Deal
despatched two boats to endeavor to board the ship. The captain
obstinately refused to take any notice of them, and ordered the crew to
let the vessel drive before the wind. This they did, till the ship ran
so close in shore, that the captain himself saw the imminent danger, and
twice attempted to put her about, but in vain. On the first of the
projecting jetties of Dymchurch-wall the vessel struck. I would not if I
could grieve your young heart with a detail of all the horrors that
ensued; the devoted ship continued to beat on the piles, the sea
breaking over her with such violence, that the pumps could no longer be
worked.

The foremast soon went over the ship's side, carrying twelve seamen
with it, who were swallowed up by the billows. The rudder was unshipped,
the tiller tore up the gundeck, and the water rushed in at the
port-holes. At this fearful moment most of the passengers and crew
joined in solemn prayer to the Almighty. Morning came, but it was only
to witness the demolition of the wreck.

Many were the efforts made by the sufferers, some in the jolly boat,
some on a raft, others by lashing themselves to pieces of timber,
hogsheads, and even hencoops, to reach the shore; but out of four
hundred and seventy-two persons who a few days before had left the coast
of Holland, not more than eighteen escaped the raging billows. The
miserable remnant received generous attention from the inhabitants of
the place, who did all in their power to aid their recovery.

[Illustration: BURNING OF THE KENT EAST INDIAMAN.]




BURNING OF THE KENT EAST INDIAMAN.


This picture represents the burning of the Kent East Indiaman, in the
Bay of Biscay. She had on board in all six hundred and forty-one persons
at the time of the accident. The fire broke out in the hold during a
storm. An officer on duty, finding that a spirit cask had broken loose,
was taking measures to secure it, when a lurch of the ship caused him to
drop his lantern, and in his eagerness to save it, he let go the cask,
which suddenly stove in, and the spirits communicated with the flame,
the whole place was instantly in a blaze. Hopes of subduing the fire at
first were strong, but soon heavy volumes of smoke and a pitchy smell
told that it had reached the cable-room.

In these awful circumstances, the captain ordered the lower decks to be
scuttled, to admit water. This was done; several poor seamen being
suffocated by the smoke in executing the order; but now a new danger
threatened, the sea rushed in so furiously, that the ship was becoming
water-logged, and all feared her going down. Between six and seven
hundred human beings, were by by this time crowded on the deck. Many on
their knees earnestly implored the mercy of an all-powerful God! while
some old stout-hearted sailors quietly seated themselves directly over
the powder magazine, expecting an explosion every moment, and thinking
thus to put a speedier end to their torture.

In this time of despair, it occurred to the fourth mate to send a man to
the foremast, hoping, but scarce daring to think it probable, that some
friendly sail might be in sight. The man at the fore-top looked around
him; it was a moment of intense anxiety; then waving his hat, he cried
out, "A sail, on the lee-bow!"

Those on deck received the news with heart-felt gratitude, and answered
with three cheers. Signals of distress were instantly hoisted, and
endeavors used to make towards the stranger, while the minute guns were
fired continuously. She proved to be the brig Cambria, Captain Cook,
master, bound to Vera Cruz, having twenty Cornish miners, and some
agents of the Mining Company on board. For about one quarter of an hour,
the crew of the Kent doubted whether the brig perceived their signals:
but after a period of dreadful suspense, they saw the British colors
hoisted, and the brig making towards them.

On this, the crew of the Kent got their boats in readiness; the first
was filled with women, passengers, and officers' wives, and was lowered
into a sea so tempestuous as to leave small hope of their reaching the
brig; they did, however, after being nearly swamped through some
entanglement of the ropes, get clear of the Kent, and were safely taken
on board the Cambria, which prudently lay at some distance off.

After the first trip, it was found impossible for the boats to come
close alongside of the Kent, and the poor women and children suffered
dreadfully, in being lowered over the stern into them by means of ropes.
Amid this gloomy scene, many beautiful examples occurred of filial and
parental affection, and of disinterested friendship; and many sorrowful
instances of individual loss and suffering. At length, when all had been
removed from the burning vessel, but a few, who were so overcome by
fear as to refuse to make the attempt to reach the brig, the captain
quitted his ill-fated ship.

The flames which had spread along her upper deck, now mounted rapidly to
the mast and rigging, forming one general conflagration and lighting up
the heavens to an immense distance round. One by one her stately masts
fell over her sides. By half-past one in the morning the fire reached
the powder magazine; the looked-for explosion took place, and the
burning fragments of the vessel were blown high into the air, like so
many rockets.

The Cambria, with her crowd of sufferers, made all speed to the nearest
port, and reached Portsmouth in safety, shortly after midnight, on the
3d of March, 1825, the accident having taken place on the 28th of
February. Wonderful to tell, fourteen of the poor creatures, left on the
Kent, were rescued by another ship, the Caroline, on her passage from
Alexandria to Liverpool.




THE PELICAN.


The life of a pelican seems to be a very lazy, if not a very pleasant
one. Man, ever on the watch to turn the habits of animals to his own
account, observing how good a fisherman the pelican is, often catches
and tames him, and makes him fish for _him_. I have heard of a bird of
this kind in America, which was so well trained, that it would at
command go off in the morning, and return at night with its pouch full,
and stretched to the utmost; part of its treasure it disgorged for its
master, the rest was given to the bird for its trouble. It is hardly
credible what these extraordinary pouches will hold; it is said, that
among other things, a man's leg with the boots on was once found in one
of them.

Pelicans live in flocks; they and the cormorants sometimes help one
another to get a living. The cormorant is a species of pelican, of a
dusky color: it is sometimes called the sea crow. The cormorants are the
best divers, so the pelicans arrange themselves in a large circle at
some great distance from the land, and flap their great wings on the
surface of the water, while the cormorants dive beneath. Away swim the
poor frightened fish towards the shore; the pelicans draw into a
narrower circle, and the fish at last are brought into so small a
compass, that their pursuers find no difficulty in obtaining a plentiful
meal.

[Illustration: THE SEA TURTLE.]




CATCHING TURTLE.


There are two kinds of turtle; the one is called the green turtle, and
is much valued as a delicious article of food; the other the hawk's bill
turtle supplies the tortoise shell of commerce, which is prepared and
moulded into various forms by heat. The flesh of the hawk's bill turtle
is considered very unwholesome.

[Illustration: CATCHING TURTLE.]

The turtles in the picture are of the edible kind; they are found on the
shores of nearly all the countries within the tropics.

There is a little rocky island in the south Atlantic Ocean, called the
Island of Ascension, where they are found in vast numbers, and this
barren spot is often visited by Indiamen for the purpose of obtaining
some of them. The turtles feed on the sea weed and other marine plants
which grow on the shoals and sand banks, and with their powerful jaws,
they crush the small sea shells which are found among the weeds. This
kind of food is always to be had in great abundance, so that the turtles
have no occasion to quarrel among themselves, for that which is afforded
in such plenty for all; indeed they seem to be a very quiet and
inoffensive race, herding peaceably together on their extensive
feeding-grounds, and when satisfied retiring to the fresh water at the
mouth of the rivers, where they remain holding their heads above water,
as if to breathe the fresh air, till the shadow of any of their numerous
enemies alarms them, when they instantly dive to the bottom for
security.

In the month of April, the females leave the water after sunset, in
order to deposit their eggs in the sand. By means of their fore-fins
they dig a hole above high water mark, about one foot wide and two deep,
into which they drop above a hundred eggs; they then cover them lightly
over with a layer of sand, sufficient to hide them, and yet thin enough
to admit the warmth of the sun's rays for hatching them. The instinct
which leads the female turtle to the shore to lay her eggs, renders her
a prey to man. The fishers wait for them on shore, especially on a
moonlight night, and following them in one of their journeys, either
coming or returning, they turn them quickly over on their backs, before
they have time to defend themselves, or to blind their assailants by
throwing up the sand with their fins.

When very large, for I should tell you that the usual weight of the
turtle is from four to six hundred pounds, it requires the efforts of
several men to turn them over, and for this purpose they often employ
levers: the back shell of the turtle is so flat that when once over it
is impossible for them to right themselves, so there the poor creatures
lie in this helpless condition, till they are either taken away in the
manner you see in the picture, or deposited by their captors in a crawl,
which is a kind of enclosure surrounded by stakes, and so situated as to
admit the influx of the sea.

The inhabitants of the Bahama Isles, catch many turtles at a
considerable distance from the shore; they strike them with a spear, the
head of which slips off when it has entered the body of the turtle, but
it is fastened by a string to the pole, and by means of this apparatus
they are able to secure them, and either take them into the boat or haul
them on shore. The length of the green turtle frequently exceeds six
feet. A boy ten years old, a son of Captain Roche, once made use of a
very large shell as a boat, and ventured in it from the shore to his
father's ship which lay about a quarter of a mile off. It was in the
bay of Campeachy, off Port Royal, where the rightful occupant of this
shell was caught.

[Illustration: WRECK OF THE STEAMBOAT.]




THE WRECK OF THE STEAMBOAT.


The following narrative teaches a lesson of courage and devotion such as
are seldom read. In one of the light-houses of the desolate Farne Isles,
amid the ocean, with no prospect before it but the wide expanse of sea,
and now and then a distant sail appearing, her cradle hymn the ceaseless
sound of the everlasting deep, there lived a little child whose name
was Grace Darling. Her father was the keeper of the light-house; and
here Grace lived and grew up to the age of twenty-two, her mother's
constant helpmate in all domestic duties. She had a fair and healthy
countenance, which wore a kind and cheerful smile, proceeding from a
heart at peace with others, and happy in the consciousness of
endeavoring to do its duty.

It was at early dawn, one September morning, in the year 1838, that the
family at the Longstone light-house looked out through a dense fog which
hung over the waters. All night the sea had run extremely high, with a
heavy gale from the north, and at this moment the storm continued
unabated. Mr. and Mrs. Darling and Grace were at this time the only
persons in the light-house; through the dim mist they perceived the
wreck of a large steam vessel on the rocks, and by the aid of their
telescope the could even make out the forms of some persons clinging to
her.

It was the Forfarshire steamboat on her passage from Hull to Dundee.
She left the former place with sixty-three persons on board. She had
entered Berwick Bay about eight o'clock the previous evening, in a heavy
gale and in a leaky condition; the motion of the vessel soon increased
the leak to such a degree that the fires could not be kept burning.
About ten o'clock she bore up off St. Abb's Head, the storm still
raging. Soon after the engineer reported that the engines would not
work; the vessel became unmanageable; it was raining heavily, and the
fog was so dense that it was impossible to make out their situation. At
length the appearance of breakers close to leeward, and the Farne lights
just becoming visible, showed to all on board their imminent danger.

The captain vainly tried to run the vessel between the islands and the
main land, she would no longer answer the helm, and was driven to and
fro by a furious sea. Between three and four o'clock in the morning she
struck with her bows foremost on a jagged rock, which pierced her
timbers. Soon after the first shock a mighty wave lifted the vessel
from the rock, and let her fall again with such violence as fairly to
break her in two pieces; the after part, containing the cabin with many
passengers, all of whom perished, was instantly carried away through a
tremendous current, while the fore part was fixed on the rock. The
survivors, only nine in number, five of the crew and four passengers,
remained in this dreadful situation till daybreak, when they were
descried by the family at the light-house. But who could dare to cross
the raging abyss which lay between them?

Grace, full of pity and anxiety for the wretched people on the wreck,
forgot all toil and danger, and urged her father to launch the boat; she
took one oar and her father the other; but Grace had never assisted in
the boat before, and it was only by extreme exertion and the most
determined courage that they succeeded in bringing the boat up to the
rock, and rescuing nine of their fellow creatures from a watery grave,
and with the help of the crew in returning, landed all safe at the
light-house.

Happy Grace Darling! she needed no other reward than the joy of her own
heart and the warm thanks of those she had helped to deliver; but the
news of the heroic deed soon spread, and wondering and admiring
strangers came from far and near to see Grace and that lonely
light-house. Nay more, they showered gifts upon her, and a public
subscription was raised with a view of rewarding her bravery, to the
amount of seven hundred pounds. She continued to live with her parents
on their barren isles, finding happiness in her simple duties and in
administering to their comfort, until her death, which took place little
more than three years after the wreck of the Forfarshire steamer.




WATERSPOUTS.

These wonderful appearances are caused by the action of currents of wind
meeting in the atmosphere from different quarters. They are sometimes
seen on land, but much more frequently at sea, where they are very
dangerous visitors. I will try to give you some idea of what they are,
and perhaps the picture may help you a little. I dare say you have often
noticed little eddies of wind whirling up dust and leaves, or any light
substances which happened to be in the way; when these occur on a larger
scale they are called whirlwinds.

[Illustration: WATERSPOUTS.]

Now if a cloud happens to be exactly in the point where two such furious
currents of wind meet, it is turned round and round by them with great
speed and is condensed into the form of a cone; this whirling motion
drives from the centre of the cloud all the particles contained in it,
producing what is called a vacuum, or empty space, into which the water
or any thing else lying beneath it has an irresistible tendency to rush.
Underneath the dense impending cloud, the sea becomes violently
agitated, and the waves dart rapidly towards the centre of the troubled
mass of water: on reaching it they disperse in vapor, and rise, whirling
in a spiral direction towards the cloud. The descending and ascending
columns unite, the whole presenting the appearance of a hollow cylinder,
or tube of glass, empty within. This, Maltebrun tells us, and he further
adds, "it glides over the sea without any wind being felt; indeed
several have been seen at once, pursuing different directions. When the
cloud and the marine base of the waterspout move with equal velocity,
the lower cone is often seen to incline sideways, or even to bend, and
finally to burst in pieces. A noise is then heard like the noise of a
cataract falling in a deep valley. Lightning frequently issues from the
very bosom of the waterspout, particularly when it breaks; but no
thunder is ever heard."

Sailors, to prevent the danger which would arise from coming in contact
with one of these tremendous columns, discharge a cannon into it: the
ball passing through it breaks the watery cylinder, and causes it to
burst, just as a touch causes your beautiful soap-bubbles to vanish, and
turn to water again. These waterspouts, at sea, generally occur between
the tropics, and I believe frequently after a calm, such as the poet
has described in the following lines:

  "Down dropt the breeze, the sails dropt down,
    'Twas sad as sad could be,
  And we did speak only to break
    The silence of the sea!

  "All in a hot and copper sky,
    The bloody sun at noon,
  Right up above the mast did stand.
    No bigger than the moon.

  "Day after day, day after day,
    We stuck, nor breath, nor motion;
  As idle as a painted ship
    Upon a painted ocean.

  "Water, water, every where,
    And all the boards did shrink;
  Water, water, every where
    And not a drop to drink!"

Happily "dead calms" do not generally last so long as to lead to any
serious result. Sailors have a superstitious and foolish belief that
whistling in a calm will bring up a breeze, and they do this in a
drawling, beseeching tone, on some prominent part of the vessel. Poor
fellows! what a pity that their thoughts should not more frequently be
directed to Him "who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand,
and meted out heaven with a span," and whose works and wonders in the
deep "they that go down to the sea in ships" have such abundant
opportunity for observing.




HEAVING THE LEAD.


Here we have a sailor in the act of heaving the lead, or taking
soundings, which is a thing extremely necessary to be done when a ship
is approaching the shore, as there is great danger of her running on a
sand-bank or striking on a sunken rock. I will now tell you how it is
managed. A sailor gets over the ship's side, as you see in the
engraving, and takes his station in what are called "the chains;" he
holds in his hand a coil of rope, with the length in fathoms marked upon
it; this rope has a mass of lead attached to the end of it. At the
bottom of the lead, is a hollow place, into which a piece of tallow
candle is stuck, which brings up distinguishing marks from the bottom of
the sea, such as small shells, sand, or mud, adhering to it. If the
tallow be only indented it is supposed to have fallen on bare rocks. A
correct account of the soundings is entered in the logbook; this book
contains a description of the ship's course, the direction of the wind,
and other circumstances, during every hour of each day and night. Having
arranged the rope so as to allow it to fall freely when cast, the sailor
throws the lead forward into the water, giving rope sufficient to allow
it to touch the bottom; then with a sudden jerk, such as long practice
alone can enable him to give, he raises the weight, and after examining
the mark on the rope made by the water, calls out lustily, so that all
forward can hear, "By the mark seven," or "By the deep nine," according
to the case, or whatever the number of fathoms may be. The lead-line is
marked into lengths of six feet, called fathoms, by knots, or pieces of
leather, or old sail-cloth. In narrow or intricate channels, it is
sometimes needful to place a man in the chains on each side of the ship,
as the depth will vary a fathom or more even in the breadth of the
vessel, and it is of great consequence that the leadsmen give the depth
correctly, as a wrong report might cause the ship to run aground. The
time that the leadsman is employed in taking soundings is often a period
of deep anxiety to the crew and passengers, especially if the vessel be
near an unknown coast. When the decrease in the number of fathoms is
sudden, the captain knows that danger is near, and quickly gives orders
to alter the ship's course: the sailors instantly obey his directions;
but sometimes not all their activity and energy can save the vessel; she
strikes and becomes a wreck.

Turn to the 27th chapter of the Acts of the Apostles in your Bible, and
you will there read the deeply interesting account of Paul's shipwreck
on the island Melita. Life has often been compared to a voyage--and
aptly so.

You will find that you, like the mariner, are exposed to many dangers,
and that you are never for one moment safe in trusting to your own skill
to guide your little bark. In watchfulness and prayer, look to your
Heavenly Pilot for directions under every circumstance, often examining
your own heart, as the seaman heaves the lead in danger. Then will you
be safely guided through storms and calms, amid rocks and shoals, and
reach at last the blessed haven of eternal rest and peace.




THE BALLOON AT SEA.


A balloon is a hollow globe, made of silk, rendered air-tight by a
coating of gum and resin, and enclosed within a strong network. When
filled with gas it is so much lighter than the air which surrounds us,
that it will rise with heavier bodies suspended to it. In a sort of car
or boat attached, men, who are called "aeronauts," have performed
journeys through the air.

The balloon was invented by a Frenchman named Montgolfier. Great
expectations were at first entertained of this art of sailing through
the air, but as yet it has not proved of much practical use. Many
disasters have at different times befallen balloon voyagers.

Many years ago, Major Mooney ascended in his balloon from Norwich,
expecting from the direction of the wind that he might descend near
Ipswich; but when he had risen about one mile from the earth, a violent
current carried him and his balloon towards Yarmouth. The balloon fell
on the sea, about nine miles from land. The Major supported himself for
some time in the water, by holding firmly to the balloon, and was at
last rescued from his dangerous situation by the crew of a cutter which
was cruising on the coast.

This was a disastrous voyage, but I think it will interest you to hear
of a more successful one, performed by three gentlemen, one of whom,
Mr. Green, has introduced some great improvements in the art of filling
and guiding balloons. These gentlemen left the earth in the car of a
very large balloon, at half-past one o'clock, on Monday, the 7th of
November, 1836, intending to proceed to some point on the continent of
Europe not very distant from Paris. They were provided with provisions
for a fortnight; these, with sand-bags for ballast, cordage, and all
needful apparatus for such a journey were placed in the bottom of the
car, while all around hung cloaks, carpet bags, barrels of wood and
copper, barometers, telescopes, lamps, spirit-flasks, coffee-warmers,
&c, for you know it would be impossible for them afterwards to supply
any thing which might have been forgotten.

Thus duly furnished, the balloon was rapidly borne away by a moderate
breeze over the fertile fields of Kent to Dover. It was forty-eight
minutes past four when the first sound of the waves on the sea-beach
broke on the voyagers' ears: the sun was sinking below the horizon, and
as the balloon was rapidly borne into the region of mist which hung over
the ocean, we must suppose something of dread and uncertainty attended
the adventurer's minds. Scarcely, however, had they completed some
arrangements, intended to render the balloon more buoyant in the heavy
atmosphere, than again the sound of waves surprised them, and below were
seen glittering the well-known lights of Calais and the neighboring
shores. Passing over Calais the aeronauts lowered a blue-light to give
notice of their presence, but could not tell whether the inhabitants
perceived it. By this time night had completely closed in, and still the
silken ball pursued its course. So long as lights were burning in the
towns and villages which it passed in rapid succession, the solitary
voyagers looked down on the scene with delight; sometimes they could
even catch the hum of the yet busy multitude, or the bark of a
watch-dog; but midnight came, and the world was hushed in sleep.

As soon as the people were again stirring below, the guide-rope was
hauled into the balloon, and the grappling-iron lowered; and after
sundry difficulties from the danger of getting entangled in a wood, and
grievously affrighting two ladies, who stood awhile petrified with
amazement at the unusual apparition, the voyagers succeeded in alighting
in a grassy valley, about six miles from the town of Weilburg, in the
Duchy of Nassau. Here every attention and accommodation was afforded
them, and thus ended this remarkable journey, an extent of about five
hundred British miles having been passed over in the space of eighteen
hours.




AN ADVENTURE OF PAUL JONES.


John Paul Jones was a famous naval commander in the service of the
United States, during the revolutionary war. He was a native of
Scotland, but having come to Virginia and settled before the war broke
out, he joined the patriots as soon as hostilities commenced, and
rendered the most important services through the whole of the long and
arduous contest, by which our independence was acquired.

The following account of one of his adventures is given by his
biographer.

Eager to retaliate upon Britain for some predatory exploits of her
sailors on the American coast, and exasperated by the resolution which
the English government had taken, to treat all the supporters of
independence as traitors and rebels, Captain Paul Jones entered the
Irish Channel, and approaching his native shores, not as a friend, but
as a determined enemy. On the night of the 22d of April, 1778, he came
to anchor in the Solway Firth, almost within sight of the trees which
sheltered the house in which he first drew the breath of life.

Early next morning, he rowed for the English coast, at the head of
thirty-one volunteers, in two boats, with the intention of destroying
the shipping, about two hundred sail, which lay in the harbor of
Whitehaven.

In this daring attempt he would probably have succeeded without
difficulty, had not the strength of the opposing tide retarded his
progress so much, that day began to dawn before he could gain the shore.
He despatched the smaller of the two boats to the north of the port to
set fire to the vessels, whilst he led the remainder of the party to the
more hazardous duty of securing the fort, which was situated on a hill
to the south. It was a cold morning, and the sentinels little aware that
an enemy was so near, had retired into the guard-room for warmth,
affording Jones an opportunity to take them by surprise, of which he did
not fail to avail himself. Climbing over the shoulders of the tallest of
his men, he crept silently through one of the embrasures and was
instantly followed by the rest. Their first care was to make fast the
door of the guard-room, and their next to spike the cannon, thirty-six
in number. Having effected this without bloodshed, they proceeded to
join the detachment which had been sent to the north; and finding that a
false alarm had deterred them from executing their orders, Jones
instantly proceeded to set fire to the vessels within his reach. By this
time, however, the inhabitants were roused, and the invaders were
obliged to retreat, leaving three ships in flames, of which one alone
was destroyed.

On the same day with this adventure, another memorable occurrence took
place, which contributed, for a time, to add greatly to the odium which
the first had brought on his name in Britain, but which, in the end,
enabled him to prove that he was possessed of the most heroic qualities.
In cruising off the coast of Galloway, it occurred to him, that, if he
could get into his power a man of high rank and influence in the state,
he should able, by retaining him as a hostage, to ensure to the American
prisoners of war more lenient treatment than was threatened by the
British government. Knowing that the Earl of Selkirk possessed a seat at
St. Mary's Isle, a beautiful peninsula at the mouth of the Dee, and
being ill-informed with regard to the political connections of that
nobleman, he destined him for the subject of his experiment. With that
view, he landed on the Isle, about noon, with two officers and a few
men; but, before they had proceeded far, he learned that his lordship
was from home. Finding his object frustrated, he now wished to return;
but his crew were not so easily satisfied. Their object was plunder; and
as they consisted of men in a very imperfect state of discipline, and
with whom it would have been dangerous to contend, he allowed them to
proceed. He exacted from them, however, a promise that they should be
guilty of no violence; that the men should not enter the house, and that
the officers, after having made their demands, should accept what might
be put into their hands without scrutiny. These conditions were
punctually obeyed. The greater part of the Selkirk plate was carried off
in triumph by the crew, and Paul Jones was, for a time, stigmatized as a
freebooter; but he nobly vindicated his character, by taking the
earliest opportunity of purchasing the whole of it, out of his own
private funds, and remitting it safe to its original owner, without
accepting the smallest remuneration. National prejudice has
misrepresented this transaction; and in order to excite the popular
indignation against Jones, it has been common to state, that this
attempt on the person, and as it was supposed the property, of Lord
Selkirk, was aggravated by ingratitude, his father having eaten of that
nobleman's bread. Nothing can be more false. Neither Mr. Paul, nor any
of his kindred, ever was in the earl's employ, or had ever the most
distant connection with his lordship or his family; and in a
correspondence which took place between our hero and Lady Selkirk,
relative to the restitution of the plate, a most honorable testimony was
gratefully paid by the latter to the captain's character.

[Illustration; NELSON SAVED BY HIS COXSWAIN.]




ADMIRAL NELSON.


Nelson lost the sight of one eye at the siege of Calvi, by a shot
driving the sand and gravel into it, and he lost his arm by a shot in an
expedition against Teneriffe; but the most dangerous of his exploits
were, boarding the battery at San Bartolomeo, boarding the San Joseph,
the boat action in the Bay of Cadiz, and the famous battles of the Nile
and Trafalgar. Of these, perhaps, the boat action during the blockade of
Cadiz was the most severe. While making an attempt against the Spanish
gunboats, he was attacked by D. Miguel Tregayen, in an armed launch,
carrying twenty-six men; fearful odds against his ten bargemen, captain,
and coxswain. Eighteen Spaniards were killed, the rest wounded, and the
launch captured.

[Illustration: ADMIRAL NELSON.]

The Spaniards were more than two to one, and yet he beat them; but it
was a hard and desperate struggle, hand to hand and blade to blade.
Twice did John Sykes, the coxswain, save Nelson's life, by parrying off
blows that would have destroyed him, and once did he interpose his head
to receive the blow of a Spanish sabre; but he would willingly have died
for his admiral.

Poor Sykes was wounded badly, but not killed.

When Nelson's health was established after the loss of his arm, he sent
to the minister of St. George's, Hanover Square, the following desire to
offer up his thanksgiving:--"An officer desires to return thanks to
Almighty God for his perfect recovery from a severe wound, and also for
the many mercies bestowed on him." Thus showing that he was humble
enough to be thankful to God, and continued so in the midst of all his
successes.

The following is an instance of his coolness in the hour of danger. The
late Lieutenant-General the Hon. Sir William Stewart, as
lieutenant-colonel of the rifle-brigade, embarked to do duty in the
fleet which was led by Sir Hyde Parker and Nelson, to the attack of
Copenhagen in 1801. "I was," says he, "with Lord Nelson when he wrote
the note to the Crown Prince of Denmark, proposing terms of arrangement.
A cannon ball struck off the head of the boy who was crossing the cabin
with the light to seal it. "Bring another candle," said his lordship. I
observed, that I thought it might very well be sent as it was, for it
would not be expected that the usual forms could be observed at such a
moment. "That is the very thing I should wish to avoid, Colonel,"
replied he, "for if the least appearance of precipitation were
perceptible in the manner of sending this note, it might spoil all."
Another candle being now brought, his lordship sealed the letter,
carefully enclosed in an envelope, with a seal bearing his coat of arms
and coronet, and delivered it to the officer in waiting to receive it.
It is said that the moment was a critical one, and that Lord Nelson's
note decided the event."

A seaman of the name of Hewson, who had served under Nelson, was working
as a caster in a manufactory at Birmingham when Nelson visited that
place. Among other manufactories, the admiral paid a visit to that where
Hewson was at work as a brass-founder; and though no employment
disfigures a workman more with smoke and dust than the process of
casting, the quick eye of Nelson recognized in the caster an old
associate. "What, Hewson, my lad," said he, "are you here?" Hewson laid
hold of the hair that hung over his forehead, and making an awkward bow,
replied, "Yes, your honor." "Why, how comes this about! You and I are
old acquaintances; you were with me in the Captain when I boarded the
San Joseph, were you not?" Hewson again laid hold of of his hair, and
bowing, replied, "Yes, your honor." "I remember you well," said Nelson;
"you were one of the cleverest fellows about the vessel! If any thing
was to be done, Hewson was the lad to do. Why, what do you here, working
like a negro? Take this," throwing him money, "and wash the dust down
your throat."

Hewson withdrew to a neighboring alehouse, boasting of the character the
admiral had given him. Month after month passed away, but Hewson
returned not--his shop-tools were abandoned, and no one could account
for his absence. At length a stripling, in a sailor's jacket, entered
the manufactory and said, "he was come to settle his father's affairs."
This was no other than Hewson's son, from whose account it appeared,
that when Hewson, somewhat elevated with liquor, but more with the
praise the admiral had bestowed on him, quitted Birmingham, he walked
his way down to Portsmouth, entered once more on board Lord Nelson's
ship, and fell with him in the battle of Trafalgar.

At the battle of Trafalgar, Collingwood, in the Royal Sovereign, led the
lee-line of fourteen ships, Nelson, in the Victory, was at the head of
the weather-line, consisting of fourteen ships. Besides these there were
four frigates.

The ships of France and Spain, opposed to the British, were in number
thirty-three, with seven large frigates. The odds were great against the
English, but the superior tactics, and well-known bravery of Nelson,
clothed him with power, that more than made up the difference. When
every thing was prepared for the engagement, Nelson retired into his
cabin alone, and wrote down the following prayer.

"May the great God, whom I worship grant to my country, and for the
benefit of Europe in general, a great and glorious victory, and may no
misconduct in any one tarnish it, and may humanity after victory, be the
predominant feature in the British fleet! For myself, individually, I
commit my life to Him that made me; and may his blessing alight on my
endeavors for serving my country faithfully! To him I resign myself, and
the just cause which is entrusted to me to defend. Amen! Amen! Amen!"

He wore on the day of the battle his admiral's frock coat, and on his
left breast, over his heart, four stars of the orders of honor, which
had been conferred upon him. Those around thought it was dangerous to
wear his stars, lest he should be too plainly seen by the enemy, but
they were afraid to tell him so, because he had said, "In honor I gained
them, and in honor I will die with them."

The effect produced by the signal given by Lord Nelson, "England expects
every man to do his duty!" was wonderful; it ran from ship to ship,
from man to man, from heart to heart, like a train of gunpowder.
Officers and men seemed animated with one spirit, and that was a
determination to win the day, or at least never to surrender to the
enemy.

The captains commanded on their quarterdecks; the boatswains in the
forecastle; the gunners attended to the magazines, and the carpenters
with their plug-shots, put themselves in readiness with high-wrought
energy, nor were the seamen and marines a whit behind hand in entering
on their several duties. The guns, the tackle, the round, grape, and
canister-shot, the powder-boys, the captains of guns, with their
priming-boxes, and the officers with their drawn swords, cut an imposing
appearance; and the cock-pit would have made a rudy face turn pale.

The wounded are all taken down into the cock-pit. It will hardly bear
thinking about. But in the cockpit were laid out ready for use, wine,
water, and surgeon's instruments, with napkins, basins, sponges, and
bandages.

The combined fleets of France and Spain, at Trafalgar, under
Villenueve, the French admiral, a brave and skilful man, were in the
form of a crescent, and the two British lines ran down upon them
parallel to each other. As soon as the British van was within gunshot
the enemy opened their fire. The Royal Sovereign soon rounded to under
the stern of the Santa Anna, and Admiral Nelson's ship, the Victory,
laid herself on board the Redoubtable. From that moment the roaring of
guns, the crash against the sides of the ships, clouds of smoke,
splintered yards, and falling masts, were the order of the day.

The death warrant of the navy of France was signed and sealed by the
fight of Trafalgar. In the heat of the action, a ball, fired from the
mizzen-top of the Redoubtable, struck Admiral Nelson on the left
shoulder, when he instantly fell. "They have done for me, at last,
Hardy," said he, to his captain.

Though mortally wounded, he gave some necessary direction concerning the
ship, and when carried below inquired earnestly how the battle went on.
When he knew that the victory had been gained--for twenty ships in all
struck to the British admiral--he expressed himself satisfied. "Now I am
satisfied," said he; "thank God, I have done my duty!" Many times he
repeated this expression, and "Thank God I have done my duty;" and "Kiss
me, Hardy," were among the last words that were uttered by his lips.
Thus, with a heart full of patriotism, died the bravest commander, the
most vigilant seaman, and the most ardent friend of his country, that
every led on a British fleet to victory.

[Illustration: DEATH OF NELSON.]

Even amid the exultation of victory, a grateful country mourned his
loss. A bountiful provision was made for his family; a public funeral
was awarded to his remains, and monuments in the principal cities of his
native land were erected to his memory. A sorrowing nation lamented over
his bier, and Britania, indeed, felt that old England's defender was
numbered with the dead.

[Illustration: BALBOA DISCOVERING THE PACIFIC OCEAN.]




DISCOVERY OF THE PACIFIC OCEAN.


Vasco Nunes de Balboa, a Spaniard, as you see by his name, was born in
1475. He was one of the adventurers who pursued the path which Columbus
had pointed out. He led a party of Spaniards, who going out from Darien
founded a colony in the neighboring regions. Some gold being found the
Spaniards got into a violent quarrel.

[Illustration: THE INDIAN CHIEF DISGUSTED AT THE SPANIARDS.]

One of the Indian chiefs being present, was so disgusted at this, that
he struck the scales with which they were weighing it so hard with his
fist, that the gold was scattered all about.

"Why," said he, "do you quarrel for such a trifle? If you really value
gold so highly, as to leave your own homes, and come and seize the lands
and dwellings of others for the sake of it, I can tell you of a land
where you may find it in plenty. Beyond those lofty mountains," said he,
pointing to the south-west, "lies a mighty sea, which people sail on
with vessels almost as big as yours. All the streams that flow from the
other side of these mountains abound in gold, and all the utensils of
the people are made of gold."

This was enough for Balboa. He inquired of the Indian the best way of
getting across the mountains, to find this land of gold. The Indian
kindly told him every thing he knew, but at the same time warned him not
to go over there, for the Indians were many and were fierce, and would
eat human flesh. But Balboa was not to be discouraged. He collected a
band of one hundred and ninety bold and hardy men, armed with swords,
targets, and cross-bows, and some blood-hounds, (for, strange to tell,
the Spaniards had trained fierce dogs to hunt the Indians, and even the
mild Bilboa was not ashamed to use them,) and so he set out on his
expedition to the west.

Embarking with his men, September 1st, 1513, at the village of Darien,
in a brigantine and nine large canoes, he sailed along the coast to the
north-west, to Coyba, where the young Indian chief lived, and where the
Isthmus of Darien is narrowest. He had taken a few friendly Indians with
him, as guides; and the young chief furnished him with a few more on his
arrival. Then leaving half his own men at Coyba, to guard the brigantine
and canoes, he began his march for the mountains, and through the
terrible wilderness.

It was the 6th of September. The heat was excessive, and the journey
toilsome and difficult. They had to climb rocky precipices, struggle
through close and tangled forests, and cross marshes, which the great
rains had rendered almost impassable. September 8th, they passed an
Indian village at the foot of the mountains, but the inhabitants did not
molest them; on the contrary they fled into the forests.

Here some of the men became exhausted, from the great heat and
travelling in the marshes. These were sent back, by slow marches, in the
care of guides, to Coyba. On the 20th of September they again set
forward.

The wilderness was so craggy, and the forest trees and underwood so
matted together, that in four days they only advanced about thirty
miles, and they now began to suffer from hunger. They also met with many
rapid foaming streams, to cross some of which they had to stop and build
rafts.

Now it was that they met with a numerous tribe of Indians, who, armed
with bows and arrows, and clubs of palm wood, almost as hard as iron,
gave them battle. But the Spaniards, although comparatively few in
numbers, with their fire-arms and bloodhounds and the aid of the
friendly Indians who were with them, soon put them to flight, and took
possession of their village. Balboa's men robbed the village of all its
gold and silver, and of every thing valuable in it; and even he himself,
whose heart the love of gold had begun already to harden, shared with
his men the plunder.

It was a dear bought victory, however; for though the Indians had lost
six hundred of their number in the contest, they could easily recruit
their forces. But Balboa, whose band was now reduced, by sickness and
the contest, from ninety-five men to sixty-seven, had no means of adding
to their strength, but was forced to proceed with what forces he had.

Early the next morning after the battle, they set out on their journey
up the mountain. About ten o'clock they came out of the tangled forest,
and reached an open space, where they enjoyed the cool breezes of the
mountains. They now began to take a little courage. Their joy was
heightened still more, when they heard one of the Indian guides exclaim,
"The sea! the sea!"

Balboa commanded his men to stop; and resolving to be the first European
who should behold this new sea, he forbade his men to stir from their
places till he called them. Then ascending to the summit of the height,
which the Indian had mounted, he beheld the sea glittering in the
morning sun.

Calling now upon his little troop to ascend the height, and view the
noble prospect along with him, "behold," said he, "the rich reward of
our toil. This is a sight upon which no Spaniard's eye ever before
rested." And in their great joy the leader and his men embraced each
other.

Balboa then took possession of the sea and coast, and the surrounding
country, in the name of the King of Spain; and having cut down a tree,
and made it into the form of a cross--for they were Catholics--he set it
up on the very spot where he first beheld the grand Pacific Ocean. He
also made a high mound, by heaping up large stones, upon which he carved
the king's name. This was on September 26th, 1513.

Not content with seeing the ocean, Balboa determined to visit it.
Arriving, after much toil, at one of the bays on the coast, he called it
St. Michael's Bay. Coming to a beach a mile or two long, "If this is a
sea," said he, "it will soon be covered with water; let us wait and see
if there be a tide." So he seated himself under a tree, and the water
soon began to flow. He tasted it and found it salt; and then waded up to
his knees in it, and took possession of it in the name of his king.

[Illustration: DEATH OF BALBOA.]

Balboa's heart was now so lifted up by success, and his whole nature so
changed, that he was ready to fight and destroy every Indian tribe that
opposed his progress. But he had not always the best of it. On one
occasion he was lost, with one or two followers, and having been seized
by some natives, carried immediately before their cazique, or chief. He
was seated on a raised seat, covered with a panther's skin, and bore a
single feather of the vulture upon his head. Beside him stood his
slaves, to fan him, and screen his head from the sun, and around him
warriors, with the sculls of their enemies fixed upon their spears:
which made the whole scene very horrible.

Balboa humbled himself before the chief; and taking off his coat,
profusely decorated, offered it as a peace offering. The cazique would
not accept it, but said, "You are poor and desolate--I am rich and
powerful. I will not hurt you, though you are my enemy." He then ordered
him safe conduct through the forests; and Balboa regained his own
people, the Spaniards, in safety. This escape softened Balboa's heart,
and he never afterwards treated the Indians with the same severity.

After many victories, and many other singular escapes, he returned back
to Coyba. But the sufferings of his men, in returning, were extreme, for
want both of water and provisions. The streams were most of them dried
up, and provisions could not be found. Gold they indeed had, almost as
much as they could carry, and the Indians kept bringing them more; but
this they could not eat or drink, and it would not buy what was not to
be bought.

He arrived at Darien after about two months' absence, having lost nearly
all his men, by war and sickness. His discovery made a great noise, and
procured him much honor, but he did not live to enjoy it.

A new governor was appointed in his place, who, having a mortal hatred
to Balboa, threw him into prison, and, after a mock trial, had him
beheaded, in 1517, in his 48th year.

[Illustration: ADMIRAL KEPPEL.]




ADMIRAL KEPPEL AND THE DEY OF ALGIERS.


When Admiral Keppel was sent to the Dey of Algiers, to demand
restitution of two ships which the pirates had taken, he sailed with his
squadron into the Bay of Algiers, and cast anchor in front of the Dey's
palace. He then landed, and, attended only by his captain and barge's
crew, demanded an immediate audience of the Dey. This being granted, he
claimed full satisfaction for the injuries done to the subjects of his
Britannic Majesty. Surprised and enraged at the boldness of the
admiral's remonstrance, the Dey exclaimed, "that he wondered at the
English King's insolence in sending him a foolish, beardless boy." A
well-timed reply from the admiral made the Dey forget the laws of all
nations in respect to ambassadors, and he ordered his mutes to attend
with the bow-string, at the same time telling the admiral he should pay
for his audacity with his life. Unmoved by this menace, the admiral took
the Dey to the window facing the bay, and showed him the English fleet
riding at anchor, and told him that if he dared put him to death there
were men enough in that fleet to make him a glorious funeral-pile. The
Dey was wise enough to take the hint. The admiral obtained ample
restitution, and came off in safety.

[Illustration: LOSS OF THE CATARAQUE.]




LOSS OF THE CATARAQUE.


The Cataraque, Captain C.W. Findlay, sailed from Liverpool, on the 20th
of April, 1849, with three hundred and sixty emigrants, and a crew
including two doctors, (brothers,) of forty-six souls. The emigrants
were principally from Bedfordshire, Staffordshire, Yorkshire, and
Northamptonshire. About one hundred and twenty of the passengers were
married, with families, and in all seventy-three children.

On the 3d of August, at seven o'clock in the evening, the ship was hove
to, and continued lying to until three A.M. of the 4th. At half past
four, being quite dark, and raining hard, blowing a fearful gale, the
ship struck on a reef, situated on the west coast of King's Island, at
the entrance of Bass's Straights.

Immediately after the ship struck, she was sounded, and it was
ascertained that there was four feet of water in the hold. An awful
scene of confusion and misery ensued. All the passengers attempted to
rush upon deck, and many succeeded in doing so, until the heaving of the
vessel knocked down the ladders, when the shrieks from below, calling on
those on deck to assist them were terrific. The crew were on deck the
moment the ship struck, and were instantly employed in handing up the
passengers. Up to the time the vessel began breaking up, the crew
succeeded in getting upwards of three hundred passengers on deck. But a
terrible fate awaited the greater part of them.

The day dawned. The stern of the vessel was found to be washed in, and
numerous dead bodies were found floating round the ship; some clinging
to the rocks which they had grasped in despair. About two hundred of the
passengers and crew held on to the vessel, although the raging sea was
breaking over her, and every wave washed some of them to a watery grave.
In this manner, kindred were separated, while those who remained could
only expect the same fate to reach them. Things continued in this
condition until four in the afternoon, when the vessel parted amidships,
at the fore part of the main rigging, and immediately between seventy
and a hundred persons were thrown into the waves. Thus the insatiable
ocean swallowed its prey piece-meal. About five, the wreck parted by the
fore-rigging, and so many persons were thrown into the sea, that only
seventy were left on the forecastle, they being lashed to the wreck.
Even these were gradually diminished in number, some giving out from
exhaustion, and others anticipating fate, by drowning themselves.

When day dawned, on the following morning, only about thirty persons
were left alive, and these were almost exhausted. The sea was making a
clean breach into the forecastle, the deck of which was rapidly breaking
up. Parents and children, husbands and wives, were seen floating around
the vessel, many in an embrace, which even the ocean's power could not
sunder. The few who remained alive could only look up to heaven for a
hope of safety. Soon after daylight, the vessel totally disappeared, and
out of four hundred and twenty-three persons who had been on board the
vessel, only nine were saved by being washed on shore, and these were
nearly exhausted.

[Illustration: LOSS OF THE FRANCIS SPAIGHT.]




LOSS OF THE FRANCIS SPAIGHT.


On the morning of the 7th of January, 1848, the barque Francis Spaight,
lying in Table Bay, at the Cape of Good Hope, parted her anchor, and in
attempting to beat out, grounded, broadside on the beach. The gale at
the time she struck was furious, and the surf tremendous, making a clean
breach over the vessel, carrying away the bulwark, long boat, main
hatch, and part of the deck, with one of the crew.

The shore was thronged with the inhabitants of Cape Town, anxious for
the fate of the vessel. An attempt was made to send a rope from the land
to the wreck, but the rope broke. Rockets were fired with lines
attached, and one was thrown across the foremast stay, where none of the
men could reach it, on account of the fearful rolling of the sea. After
some extraordinary delay, a whale boat was brought from the town, and
manned by six daring fellows, who dashed through the surf, and were soon
alongside the vessel.

All except the carpenter, fifteen in number, got into the boat, and
pushed off. At this moment a terrific sea upset the boat, and twenty-one
persons were struggling in the surf for life. The people on the beach
were horror-stricken; and men on horseback were seen plunging into the
sea, risking their lives to save their fellow-creatures; but eighteen
sunk to rise no more. The masts of the vessel fell with a tremendous
crash, but the carpenter still clung to the wreck. At length a
surf-boat, towed by a smaller one, proceeded towards the wreck. One of
these boats was capsized, and two lives lost. But the carpenter was
rescued. This man, (James Robertson,) and John McLeod, seaman, were all
of the crew that reached the shore. The inhabitants of Cape Town were
all anxiety in regard to the fate of the vessel; and those daring heroes
who sacrificed themselves for the sake of their fellow men were worthy
of a monument as lofty as those erected to the bravest warriors.

The place where the Francis Spaight went ashore had been, a short time
previous, the scene of a far more terrible disaster. This was the wreck
of the ship Waterloo, by which two hundred persons were lost, in spite
of the most extraordinary and heroic exertions on the part of the
inhabitants of Cape Town.

The bay is very much exposed to storms, and its shores are particulary
dangerous, on account of their shelving character. The Francis Spaight
had just put into the bay for the purpose of obtaining a supply of
provisions, and it was intended that she should sail the next day. But
the Ruler of the elements intended it otherwise. Her cargo was nearly a
total loss.




LOSS OF THE GOLDEN RULE.


The ship Golden Rule, Captain Austin, sailed from Wiscasset, with a
cargo of timber, September, 8, 1807.

On the 29th, she experienced a severe gale from the south-east; and at
eight o'clock, A.M., they discovered that she had sprung a leak, and
had four feet of water in her hold; at nine it had increased to eight
feet, notwithstanding they had two pumps going, and were throwing her
deck load overboard, which they were enabled to do very slowly, from the
sea driving the planks about the deck, and wounding the crew.

About ten o'clock, the water had risen to twelve feet, and the gale had
also evidently increased; the crew and all on board were quite
exhausted; and on going into the cabin they found she was welling fast.
The main and mizzen masts were now cut away, to prevent her upsetting,
and she was quite clear of her deck load. At eleven o'clock she was full
up to her main deck, and all her bulk heads were knocked away.

It now occurred to some of the crew, to endeavor to save some bread; and
Mr. Boyd, the first mate, with great resolution, went into the cabin and
gave out some bread, and two bottles of rum; but so rapidly did she
fill, from the timber of her cargo shifting, that he was forced to break
through the sky-light to save himself. Their small stock of provisions
was now put into the binnacle, as a secure place. It had been there but
a few minutes, when a tremendous sea struck them, and carried away the
binnacle.

They had now little hope left--the wheel was broken, and they proceeded
to secure themselves as well as they could, some in the fore-top, and
the rest were lashing themselves to the taffrail; before they could
accomplish the latter plan, another sea, if possible, more heavy than
the former, hurried them all from their places, and washed two of the
men overboard; they were seen swimming for the ship, a short time, when
a wave hurried them from the sight of their lamenting comrades.

They now endeavored to keep the ship before the wind, which they were
partially enabled to do through the night. The next day another man died
from cold and hunger.

The deck was now blown up, and her side stove in, all hands had given
themselves up, when, on the 30th at noon, they were roused by the cry
of "a sail!" and they had the satisfaction to see her bear down for
them. She was the brig George, of Portland; and Captain Wildridge sent
his long-boat to take them from the wreck.




DANGERS OF WHALING SHIPS AMONG ICE BERGS.


The masses of ice by which the ocean is traversed assume a vast variety
of shapes, but may be comprehended in two general classes. The first
consists of sheets of ice, analogous to those which annually cover the
the lakes and rivers of northern lands. They present a surface which is
generally level, but here and there diversified by projections, called
_hummocks_, which arise from the ice having been thrown up by some
pressure or force to which it has been subject. Sheets of ice, which are
so large that their whole extent of surface cannot be seen from the
masthead of a vessel, are called _fields_. They have sometimes an area
of more than a hundred square miles, and rise above the level of the sea
from two to eight feet. When a piece of ice, though of a considerable
size, can be distinguished in its extent, it is termed a _floe_. A
number of sheets, large or small, joining each other, and stretching out
in any particular direction, constitute a _stream_. Captain Cook found a
stream extending across Behring's Straits, connecting eastern Asia with
the western extremity of North America. Owing to the vast extent of some
fields of ice, they would undoubtedly be conducted to a lower latitude
in the Atlantic before their dissolution, under the influence of a
warmer climate, but for the intervention of other causes. It frequently
happens that two masses are propelled against each other, and are both
shivered into fragments by the violence of the concussion. The ordinary
swell of the ocean also acts with tremendous power upon a large tract,
especially when it has been so thawed as to have become thin, and breaks
it up into a thousand smaller pieces in a very short period. The danger
of being entrapped between two ice-fields coming into contact with each
other is one of the perils which the navigator has frequently to
encounter in the northern seas; and fatal to his vessel and his life has
the occurrence often been, while in a vast number of instances escape
has seemed almost miraculous.

"At half-past six," says Captain Ross, relating to his first voyage of
discovery, in the Isabella, to the arctic regions, with Captain Parry,
in the Alexander, "the ice began to move, and, the wind increasing to a
gale, the only chance left for us was to endeavor to force the ship
through it to the north, where it partially opened; but the channel was
so much obstructed by heavy fragments, that our utmost efforts were
ineffectual; the ice closed in upon us, and at noon we felt its pressure
most severely. A large floe, which lay on one side of the Isabella,
appeared to be fixed; while, on the other side, another of considerable
bulk was passing along with a rapid motion, assuming a somewhat circular
direction, in consequence of one side having struck on the fixed field.
The pressure continuing to increase, it became doubtful whether the ship
would be able to sustain it; every support threatened to give way, the
beams in the hold began to bend, and the iron tanks settled together.

"At this critical moment, when it seemed impossible for us to bear the
accumulating pressure much longer, the hull rose several feet; while the
ice, which was more than six feet thick, broke against the sides,
curling back on itself. The great stress now fell upon our bow; and,
after being again lifted up, we were carried with great violence towards
the Alexander which had hitherto been, in a great measure, defended by
the Isabella. Every effort to avoid their getting foul of each other
failed; the ice-anchors and cables broke one after another; and the
sterns of the two ships came so violently into contact, as to crush to
pieces a boat that could not be removed in time. The collision was
tremendous, the anchors and chain-plates being broken, and nothing less
than the loss of the masts expected; but at this eventful instant, by
the interposition of Providence, the force of the ice seemed exhausted;
the two fields suddenly receded, and we passed the Alexander with
comparatively little damage. A clear channel soon after opened, and we
ran into a pool, thus escaping the immediate danger; but the fall of
snow being very heavy, our situation still remained doubtful, nor could
we conjecture whether we were yet in a place of safety. Neither the
masters, the mates, nor those men who had been all their lives in the
Greenland service, had ever experienced such imminent peril; and they
declared, that a common whaler must have been crushed to atoms."

Captain Scoresby relates a similar narrow escape from destruction owing
to the same cause. "In the year 1804," he observes, "I had an
opportunity of witnessing the effects produced by the lesser masses in
motion. Passing between two fields of ice newly formed, about a foot in
thickness, they were observed rapidly to approach each other, and,
before our ship could pass the strait, they met with a velocity of three
or four miles per hour. The one overlaid the other, and presently
covered many acres of surface. The ship proving an obstacle to the
course of the ice, it squeezed up on both sides, shaking her in a
dreadful manner, and producing a loud grinding or lengthened acute
trembling noise, according as the degree of pressure was diminished or
increased, until it had risen as high as the deck. After about two hours
the motion ceased, and soon afterwards the two sheets of ice receded
from each other nearly as rapidly as they had before advanced. The ship
in this case did not receive any injury; but, had the ice only been half
a foot thicker, she might have been wrecked." Other navigators have not
been so fortunate; and the annual loss of whaling vessels in the polar
seas is considerable, the Dutch having had as many as seventy-three sail
of ships wrecked in one season. Between the years 1669 and 1778, both
inclusive, or a period of one hundred and seven years, they sent to the
Greenland fishery fourteen thousand one hundred and sixty-seven ships,
of which five hundred and sixty-one, or about four in the hundred, were
lost.

Every one will remember the intense and mournful interest occasioned by
the loss of the President steamer which left New York in the year 1841
to cross the Atlantic, but perished in the passage, without leaving a
survivor to tell the story of her fate. It has been deemed highly
probable that this vessel got entangled in the ice, and was destroyed by
collision with its masses; for during that year, in the month of April,
the Great Western steamer encountered a field extending upwards of a
hundred miles in one direction, surrounded with an immense number of
floes and bergs, and had great difficulty in effecting its passage by
this floating continent in safety.

Another form under which the ice appears in the ocean is that of bergs,
which differ from the ice-fields in shape and origin. They are masses
projecting to a great height above the surface of the water, and have
the appearance of chalk or marble cliffs and mountains upon the deep.
They have been seen with an elevation of two hundred feet--a
circumference of two miles: and it has been shown by experiments on the
buoyancy of ice floating in sea water, that the proportion above the
surface is only about one-seventh of the thickness of the whole mass.
During the first expedition of Ross, he found an ice berg in Baffin's
Bay, at a distance of seven leagues from the land, which was measured by
a party under Lieutenant Parry. Considerable difficulty was experienced
in the attempt to land, as, in rowing round the berg, they found it
perpendicular in every place but one. When they had ascended to the
top, which was perfectly flat, they discovered a white bear in quiet
possession of the mass, who plunged into the sea without hesitation, and
effected his escape. The party found the ice berg to be four thousand
one hundred and sixty-nine yards long, three thousand eight hundred and
sixty-nine yards broad, and fifty-one feet high, being aground in
sixty-one fathoms. Its appearance was like that of the back of the Isle
of Wight, and the cliffs resembled those of the chalk range to the west
of Dover. The weight of this mass was calculated to amount to one
billion two hundred and ninety two millions three hundred and ninety
seven thousand six hundred and seventy-three tons.

[Illustration: A WHITE BEAR.]

An ice berg examined by Captain Graah, on the east coast of Greenland,
rose one hundred and twenty feet out of the water, had a circumference
of four thousand feet at the base, and its solid contents were estimated
to be upwards of nine hundred millions of cubic feet. When viewed at a
distance, nothing can be more interesting than the appearance of a
considerable number of these formations, exhibiting an infinite variety
of shape, and requiring no stretch of imagination to convert them into a
series of floating towers, castles, churches, obelisks, and pyramids, or
a snowy range of Alpine heights. No pencil, an observer has remarked,
has ever given any thing like the true effect of an ice berg. In a
picture they are huge, uncouth masses, stuck in the sea; while their
chief beauty and grandeur--their slow stately motion, the whirling of
the snow about their summits, and the fearful crackling of their
parts--they cannot give. The ice of the bergs is compact and solid, or
of a fine green tint verging to blue; and large pieces may be frequently
obtained, equal to the most beautiful crystal in transparency. It is
stated by Scoresby, that with a portion of this ice, of by no means
regular convexity, used as a burning lens, he has frequently burnt wood,
fired gunpowder, melted lead, and lit the sailors' pipes, to their no
small astonishment, the ice itself remaining in the mean while perfectly
fixed and pellucid.




MASSACRE OF THE CREW OF THE ATAHUALPA.


The Atahualpa, of Boston, left that port in August, 1803, bound to the
north-west coast of America, for the purpose of trading with the
natives. She arrived on the coast in the month of January, 1804; and,
after visiting the several islands, and purchasing skins, on the 5th of
June, 1805, weighed anchor from Chockokee, on the north-west coast, and
made sail. On the 8th, arrived at Millbank sound, and came to an anchor
within musket-shot of the village. Soon after her arrival, the chief of
the Indians, by the name of Keite, came off to the ship, with some of
his tribe, and informed the captain that the Caroline, Captain Sturgess,
had sailed from thence ten days before.

On the 11th, the chief came off again, with his tribe, and another tribe
that was there, and traded very briskly till towards night, when
becoming very insolent, they were all turned out of the ship.

On the 13th, Keite and his tribe came on board in the morning, and
seemed much more desirous to trade than before, which Captain Porter was
very glad to see. The chief mate and two of the ship's company, were
then engaged in ripping the main-sail in pieces, on the quarter-deck;
the second mate with two hands was repairing the top-sail; two on the
starboard side of the main-deck, spinning spun yarn; two more on the
forecastle, making sinnet; two more on the larboard side of the
main-deck, running shot in the armorer's forge; the cooper was making
tubs; the cook, and captain's steward in the galley, at their duty; and
all hands, as usual, employed on the ship's duty; the armorer was in the
steerage, and the boatswain in the cabin; Captain Porter, Mr. Ratstraw,
his clerk, and Mr. Lyman Plummer, (nephew of Theodore Lyman, Esq. of
Boston, ship owner,) were standing on the larboard side of the
quarter-deck, abreast of the cabin hatchway.

The chief, Keite, stood leaning on the rail, and called Captain Porter
to look at the skins that were in the canoe, alongside the ship; the
captain accordingly went to look over the side, when the chief, with
some more Indians, laid hold of him, and gave a shout. Immediately all
the Indians alongside of the canoe, and those on board, armed with
daggers, pistols, pikes, and other weapons, seized every man on deck,
who were totally unprepared for so sudden an attack. A most dreadful and
sanguinary contest immediately took place; when, after a short but
bloody engagement of about five minutes, the deck was immediately
cleared of them.

There were about two hundred Indians, it is supposed, on board at this
time; they first daggered Captain Porter several times in the back, put
him in a canoe alongside, and carried him on shore; and, as we were
afterwards informed by Captain Smith, of the ship Mary, of Boston, who
was informed by the New Hecta tribe, was by them tied to a tree, in
which unhappy and miserable situation he languished fifteen days,
refusing every species of nourishment offered him by these savages,
occasioned by his grief at this unfortunate accident.

Previous to this fatal business, there were twenty-three hands on board;
ten of whom were barbarously killed, and nine wounded. Among the killed
were, Captain Oliver Porter, Mr. John Hill, chief mate; Daniel Gooding,
second mate; John D. Katstraw, captain's clerk; Mr. Lyman Plummer, Peter
Shooner, Luther Lapham, Samuel Lapham, seamen; Isaac Lammes, cooper; and
John Williams, cook. Mr. Lyman Plummer survived about two hours after
he was wounded. The cook, who was most shockingly cut and mangled,
languished till about six o'clock the next morning.

Among the wounded were, Ebenezer Baker, seaman, most dangerously, with
daggers, he having two stabs in his left thigh, one in his groin, one in
his back, one in his breast, and one in his neck; Henry Thompson,
seaman, very dangerously, with daggers, having one wound on the right
side, one on the left shoulder, another on the left arm, and two or
three smaller ones on the same arm, one on the right temple, and another
on the left cheek; Ebenezer Williams, seaman, had three wounds in his
thigh, with daggers,--two on his back, and one on the right shoulder
with a boarding-pike; Luke Bates, seamen, one wound on the right
shoulder with a boarding-pike; Joseph Robinson, carpenter, wounded on
the left breast; Thomas Edwards, steward, stabbed on the left shoulder;
W. Walker had two stabs, with daggers, in his back.

After the deck was cleared of these sanguinary savages, several guns
were fired at the village, the sails were loosened, stream-cable cut,
and the ship put to sea. The same night they got under weigh, seven
large war-canoes hove in sight, with about thirty Indians in each. In
this deplorable condition, with only four or five hands on board capable
of duty, the Atahualpa shaped her course for New Heita; but the wind
chopping round, put about, and stood to the westward.

On the 17th, it was thought time to bury the dead, when, after having
sewed them up, and got them ready for interment, prayers were read. They
were then buried in Queen Charlotte's Sound.

It cannot be ascertained with any degree of accuracy, how many of the
Indians were killed in this dreadful contest. It is supposed, however,
that the number must have exceeded forty; for a large canoe being under
the ship's bow, with about twenty Indians in her, who were cutting a
cable, a swivel and several muskets were fired into her, and but one of
the Indians reached the shore in safety.

During the conflict with the savages, there were two barrels of powder
unheaded, and a loaded pistol prepared and given to a person who stood
ready, should they get into the cabin, and secure to themselves the
ship, to fire into it, and blow the whole up, preferring to die in that
manner rather than fall into the hands of such merciless wretches.

[Illustration: SHIPWRECK OF THE BLENDENHALL.]




SHIPWRECK OF THE BLENDENHALL.


In the year 1821, the Blendenhall, free trader, bound from England for
Bombay, partly laden with broad-cloths, was proceeding on her voyage
with every prospect of a successful issue. While thus pursuing her way
through the Atlantic, she was unfortunately driven from her course, by
adverse winds and currents, more to the southward and westward than was
required, and it became desirable to reach the island of Tristan
d'Acunha, in order to ascertain and rectify the reckoning. This island,
which is called after the Portuguese admiral who first discovered it, is
one of a group of three, the others being the Inaccessible and
Nightingale Islands, situated many hundreds of miles from any land, and
in a south-westerly direction from the Cape of Good Hope. The shores are
rugged and precipitous in the extreme, and form, perhaps, the most
dangerous coast upon which any vessel could be driven.

It was while steering to reach this group of islands, that, one morning,
a passenger on board the Blendenhall, who chanced to be upon deck
earlier than usual, observed great quantities of sea-weed occasionally
floating alongside. This excited some alarm, and a man was immediately
sent aloft to keep a good look-out. The weather was then extremely hazy,
though moderate; the weeds continued; all were on the alert; they
shortened sail, and the boatswain piped for breakfast. In less than ten
minutes, "breakers ahead!" startled every soul, and in a moment all were
on deck. "Breakers starboard! breakers larboard! breakers all around,"
was the ominous cry a moment afterwards, and all was confusion. The
words were scarcely uttered, when, and before the helm was up, the
ill-fated ship struck, and after a few tremendous shocks against the
sunken reef, she parted about mid-ship. Ropes and stays were cut
away--all rushed forward, as if instinctively, and had barely reached
the forecastle, when the stern and quarter-deck broke asunder with a
violent crash, and sunk to rise no more. Two of the seamen miserably
perished--the rest, including officers, passengers and crew, held on
about the head and bows--the struggle was for life!

At this moment, the Inaccessible Island, which till then had been veiled
in thick clouds and mist, appeared frowning above the haze. The wreck
was more than two miles from the frightful shore. The base of the
island was still buried in impenetrable gloom. In this perilous
extremity, one was for cutting away the anchor, which had been got up to
the cat-head in time of need; another was for cutting down the foremast
(the foretop-mast being already by the board.) The fog totally
disappeared, and the black rocky island stood in all its rugged
deformity before their eyes. Suddenly the sun broke out in full
splendor, as if to expose more clearly to the view of the sufferers
their dreadful predicament. Despair was in every bosom--death, arrayed
in all its terrors, seemed to hover over the wreck. But exertion was
required, and every thing that human energy could devise was effected.
The wreck, on which all eagerly clung, was fortunately drifted by the
tide and wind between ledges of sunken rocks and thundering breakers,
until, after the lapse of several hours, it entered the only spot on the
island where a landing was possibly practicable, for all the other parts
of the coast consisted of perpendicular cliffs of granite, rising from
amidst the deafening surf to the height of twenty, forty, and sixty
feet. As the shore was neared, a raft was prepared, and on this a few
paddled for the cove. At last the wreck drove right in: ropes were
instantly thrown out, and the crew and passengers, (except two who had
been crushed in the wreck,) including three ladies and a female
attendant, were snatched from the watery grave, which a few short hours
before had appeared inevitable, and safely landed on the beach. Evening
had now set in, and every effort was made to secure whatever could be
saved from the wreck. Bales of cloth, cases of wine, a few boxes of
cheese, some hams, the carcass of a milch cow that had been washed on
shore, buckets, tubs, butts, a seaman's chest, (containing a tinder-box
and needles and thread,) with a number of elegant mahogany turned
bed-posts, and part of an investment for the India market, were got on
shore. The rain poured down in torrents--all hands were busily at work
to procure shelter from the weather; and with the bed-posts and
broad-cloths, and part of the foresail, as many tents were soon pitched
as there were individuals on the island.

Drenched with the sea and with the rain, hungry, cold, and comfortless,
thousands of miles from their native land, almost beyond expectation of
human succor, hope nearly annihilated,--the shipwrecked voyagers retired
to their tents. In the morning the wreck had gone to pieces; and planks,
and spars, and whatever had floated in, were eagerly dragged on shore.
No sooner was the unfortunate ship broken up, than deeming themselves
freed from the bonds of authority, many began to secure whatever came to
land: and the captain, officers, passengers, and crew, were now reduced
to the same level, and obliged to take their turn to fetch water, and
explore the island for food. The work of exploring was soon over--there
was not a bird, nor a quadruped, nor a single tree to be seen. All was
barren and desolate. The low parts were scattered over with stones and
sand, and a few stunted weeds, rocks, ferns, and other plants. The top
of the mountain was found to consist of a fragment of original
table-land, very marshy, and full of deep sloughs, intersected with
small rills of water, pure and pellucid as crystal, and a profusion of
wild parsley and celery. The prospect was one dreary scene of
destitution, without a single ray of hope to relieve the misery of the
desponding crew. After some days, the dead cow, hams, and cheese, were
consumed; and from one end of the island to the other, not a morsel of
food could be seen. Even the celery began to fail. A few bottles of
wine, which, for security had been secreted under ground, only remained.
Famine now began to threaten. Every stone near the sea was examined for
shell-fish, but in vain.

In this dreadful extremity, and while the half-famished seamen were at
night squatting in sullen dejection round their fires, a large lot of
sea-birds, allured by the flames, rushed into the midst of them, and
were greedily laid hold of as fast as they could be seized. For several
nights in succession, similar flocks came in; and by multiplying their
fires a considerable supply was secured. These visits, however, ceased
at length, and the wretched party were exposed again to the most severe
privation. When their stock of wild fowl had been exhausted for more
than two days, each began to fear they were now approaching that sad
point of necessity, when, between death and casting lots who should be
sacrificed to serve for food for the rest, no alternative remained.
While horror at the bare contemplation of an extremity so repulsive
occupied the thoughts of all, the horizon was observed to be suddenly
obscured, and presently clouds of penguin alighted on the island. The
low grounds were actually covered; and before the evening was dark, the
sand could not be seen for the number of eggs, which, like a sheet of
snow, lay on the surface of the earth. The penguins continued on the
island four or five days, when, as if by signal, the whole took their
flight, and were never seen again. A few were killed, but the flesh was
so extremely rank and nauseous that it could not be eaten. The eggs
were collected and dressed in all manner of ways, and supplied abundance
of food for upwards of three weeks. At the expiration of that period,
famine once more seemed inevitable; the third morning began to dawn upon
the unfortunate company after their stock of eggs were exhausted; they
had now been without food for more than forty hours, and were fainting
and dejected; when, as though this desolate rock were really a land of
miracles, a man came running up to the encampment with the unexpected
and joyful tidings that "millions of sea-cows had come on shore." The
crew climbed over the ledge of rocks that flanked their tents, and the
sight of a shoal of manatees immediately beneath them gladdened their
hearts. These came in with the flood, and were left in the puddles
between the broken rocks of the cove. This supply continued for two or
three weeks. The flesh was mere blubber, and quite unfit for food, for
not a man could retain it on his stomach; but the liver was excellent,
and on this they subsisted. In the meantime, the carpenter with his
gang had constructed a boat, and four of the men had adventured in her
for Tristan d'Acunha, in hopes of ultimately extricating their
fellow-sufferers from their perilous situation. Unfortunately the boat
was lost--whether carried away by the violence of the currents that set
in between the islands, or dashed to pieces against the breakers, was
never known, for no vestige of the boat or crew was ever seen. Before
the manatees, however, began to quit the shore, a second boat was
launched; and in this an officer and some seamen made a second attempt,
and happily succeeded in effecting a landing, after much labor, on the
island, where they were received with much cordiality and humanity by
Governor Glass--a personage whom it will be necessary to describe.

Tristan d'Acunha is believed to have been uninhabited until 1811, when
three Americans took up their residence upon it, for the purpose of
cultivating vegetables, and selling the produce, particularly potatoes,
to vessels which might touch there on their way to India, the Cape, or
other parts in the southern ocean. These Americans remained its only
inhabitants till 1816, when, on Bonaparte being sent to St. Helena, the
British government deemed it expedient to garrison the island, and sent
the Falmouth man-of-war with a colony of forty persons, which arrived in
the month of August. At this time the chief of the American settlers was
dead, and two only survived; but what finally became of these we are not
informed. The British garrison was soon given up, the colony abandoned,
and all returned to the Cape of Good Hope, except a person named Glass,
a Scotchman, who had been corporal of artillery, and his wife, a Cape
Creole. One or two other families afterwards joined them, and thus the
foundation of a nation on a small scale was formed; Mr. Glass, with the
title and character of governor, like a second Robinson Crusoe, being
the undisputed chief and lawgiver of the whole. On being visited in
1825, by Mr. Augustus Earle, the little colony was found to be on the
increase, a considerable number of children having been born since the
period of settlement. The different families inhabited a small village,
consisting of cottages covered with thatch made of the long grass of the
island, and exhibiting an air of comfort, cleanliness, and plenty, truly
English.

It was to this island that the boat's crew of the Blendenhall had bent
their course, and its principal inhabitant, Governor Glass, showed them
every mark of attention, not only on the score of humanity, but because
they were fellow-subjects of the same power--for, be it known, Glass did
not lay claim to independent monarchy, but always prayed publicly for
King George as his lawful sovereign. On learning the situation of the
crew, on Inaccessible Island, he instantly launched his boat, and unawed
by considerations of personal danger, hastened, at the risk of his life,
to deliver his shipwrecked countrymen from the calamities they had so
long endured. He made repeated trips, surmounted all difficulties, and
fortunately succeeded in safely landing them on his own island, after
they had been exposed for nearly three months to the horrors of a
situation almost unparalleled in the recorded sufferings of seafaring
men.

After being hospitably treated by Glass and his company for three
months, the survivors obtained a passage to the Cape, all except a young
sailor named White, who had formed an attachment to one of the servant
girls on board, and who, in all the miseries which had been endured, had
been her constant protector and companion; whilst gratitude on her part
prevented her wishing to leave him. Both chose to remain, and were
forthwith adopted as free citizens of the little community.




SHIPWRECK OF THE MEDUSA.


On the 17th of June, 1816, the Medusa, French frigate, commanded by
Captain Chaumareys, and accompanied by three smaller vessels, sailed
from the island of Aix, for the coast of Africa, in order to take
possession of some colonies. The first accident she encountered was off
Cape Finisterre, when one of the crew fell into the sea; and from the
apathy of his companions, their want of promptitude in manoeuvring, with
the want of every precaution, he was left to perish. On the tenth day of
sailing, there appeared an error of thirty leagues in the reckoning. On
the 1st of July, they entered the tropics; and there, with a childish
disregard to danger, and knowing that she was surrounded by all the
unseen perils of the ocean, her crew performed the ceremony usual to the
occasion, while the vessel was running headlong on destruction. The
captain, presided over the disgraceful scene of merriment, leaving the
ship to the command of a Mons. Richefort, who had passed the ten
preceding years of his life in an English prison--a few persons on board
remonstrated in vain; though it was ascertained that they were on the
banks of Arguise, she continued her course, and heaved the lead, without
slackening the sail. Every thing denoted shallow water, but M. Richefort
persisted in saying that they were in one hundred fathoms. At that very
moment only six fathoms were found; and the vessel struck three times,
being in about sixteen feet water, and the tide full flood. At ebb-tide,
there remained but twelve feet water; and after some bungling
manoeuvres, all hope of getting the ship off was abandoned.

When the frigate struck, she had on board six boats, of various
capacities, all of which could not contain the crew and passengers; and
a raft was constructed. A dreadful scene ensued. All scrambled out of
the wreck without order or precaution. The first who reached the boats
refused to admit any of their fellow-sufferers into them, though there
was ample room for more. Some, apprehending that a plot had been formed
to abandon them in the vessel, flew to arms. No one assisted his
companions; and Captain Chaumareys stole out of a port-hole into his own
boat, leaving a great part of the crew to shift for themselves. At
length they put off to sea, intending to steer for the sandy coast of
the desert, there to land, and thence to proceed with a caravan to the
island of St. Louis.

The raft had been constructed without foresight or intelligence. It was
about sixty-five feet long and twenty-five broad, but the only part
which could be depended upon was the middle; and that was so small, that
fifteen persons could not lie down upon it. Those who stood on the floor
were in constant danger of slipping through between the planks; the sea
flowed in on all its sides. When one hundred and fifty passengers who
were destined to be its burden, were on board, they stood like a solid
parallelogram, without a possibility of moving; and they were up to
their waists in water. The original plan was, that as much provision as
possible should be put upon this raft; that it should be taken in tow by
the six boats; and that, at stated intervals, the crews should come on
board to receive their rations. As they left the ship, M. Correard asked
whether the charts, instruments, and sea-stores were on board; and was
told by an officer, that nothing was wanting. "And who is to command
us?" "I am to command you," answered he, "and will be with you in a
moment." The officer with these words, the last in his mouth, went on
board one of the boats, and returned no more.

The desperate squadron had only proceeded three leagues, when a faulty,
if not treacherous manoeuvre, broke the tow-line which fastened the
captain's boat to the raft; and this became the signal to all to let
loose their cables. The weather was calm. The coast was known to be but
twelve or fifteen leagues distant; and the land was in fact discovered
by the boats on the very evening on which they abandoned the raft. They
were not therefore driven to this measure by any new perils; and the cry
of "_Nous les abandonons!_" which resounded throughout the line, was the
yell of a spontaneous and instinctive impulse of cowardice, perfidy, and
cruelty; and the impulse was as unanimous as it was diabolical. The raft
was left to the mercy of the waves; one after another, the boats
disappeared, and despair became general. Not one of the promised
articles, no provisions, except a very few casks of wine, and some
spoiled biscuit, sufficient for one single meal was found. A small
pocket compass, which chance had discovered, their last guide in a
trackless ocean, fell between the beams into the sea. As the crew had
taken no nourishment since morning, some wine and biscuit were
distributed; and this day, the first of thirteen on the raft, was the
last on which they tasted any solid food--except such as human nature
shudders at. The only thing which kept them alive was the hope of
revenge on those who had treacherously betrayed them.

The first night was stormy; and the waves, which had free access,
committed dreadful ravages, and threatened worse. When day appeared,
twelve miserable wretches were found crushed to death between the
openings of the raft, and several more were missing; but the number
could not be ascertained, as several soldiers had taken the billets of
the dead, in order to obtain two, or even three rations. The second
night was still more dreadful, and many were washed off; although the
crew had so crowded together, that some were smothered by the mere
pressure. To soothe their last moments, the soldiers drank immoderately;
and one, who affected to rest himself upon the side, but was
treacherously cutting the ropes, was thrown into the sea. Another whom
M. Correard had snatched from the waves, turned traitor a second time,
as soon as he had recovered his senses; but he too was killed. At length
the revolted, who were chiefly soldiers, threw themselves upon their
knees, and abjectly implored mercy. At midnight, however, they rebelled
again. Those who had no arms, fought with their teeth, and thus many
severe wounds were inflicted. One was most wantonly and dreadfully
bitten above the heel, while his companions were beating him upon the
head with their carbines, before throwing him into the sea. The raft was
strewed with dead bodies, after innumerable instances of treachery and
cruelty; and from sixty to sixty-five perished that night. The force and
courage of the strongest began to yield to their misfortunes; and even
the most resolute labored under mental derangement. In the conflict, the
revolted had thrown two casks of wine, and all the remaining water, into
the sea; and it became necessary to diminish each man's share.

A day of comparative tranquility succeeded. The survivors erected their
mast again, which had been wantonly cut down in the battle of the night;
and endeavored to catch some fish, but in vain. They were reduced to
feed on the dead bodies of their companions. A third night followed,
broken by the plaintive cries of wretches, exposed to every kind of
suffering, ten or twelve of whom died of want, and awfully foretold the
fate of the remainder. The following day was fine. Some flying fish were
caught in the raft; which, mixed up with human flesh, afforded one
scanty meal.

A new insurrection to destroy the raft, broke out on the fourth night;
this too, was marked by perfidy, and ended in blood. Most of the rebels
were thrown into the sea. The fifth morning mustered but thirty men
alive; and these sick and wounded, with the skin of their lower
extremities corroded by the salt water. Two soldiers were detected
drinking the wine of the only remaining cask; they were instantly thrown
into the sea. One boy died, and there remained only twenty-seven; of
whom fifteen only seemed likely to live. A council of war, preceded by
the most horrid despair, was held; as the weak consumed a part of the
common store, they determined to throw them into the sea. This sentence
was put into immediate execution! and all the arms on board, which now
filled their minds with horror, were, with the exception of a single
sabre, committed to the deep.

Distress and misery increased with an accelerated ratio; and even after
the desperate measure of destroying their companions, and eating the
most nauseous aliments, the surviving fifteen could not hope for more
than a few days' existence. A butterfly lighted on their sail the ninth
day, and though it was held to be a messenger of good, yet many a
greedy eye was cast upon it. Some sea-fowl also appeared; but it was
impossible to catch them. The misery of the survivors increased with a
rapidity which cannot be described; they even stole from each other
little goblets of urine which had been set to cool in the sea water, and
were now considered a luxury. The most trifling article of food, a
lemon, a small bottle of spirituous dentrifice, a little garlic, became
causes of contention; and every daily distribution of wine awakened a
spirit of selfishness and ferocity, which common sufferings and common
interest could not subdue into more social feelings.

Three days more passed over in expressible anguish, when they
constructed a smaller and more manageable raft, in the hope of directing
it to the shore; but on trial it was found insufficient. On the
seventeenth day, a brig was seen; which, after exciting the vicissitudes
of hope and fear, proved to be the Argus, sent out in quest of the
Medusa. The inhabitants of the raft were all received on board, and were
again very nearly perishing, by a fire which broke out in the night.
The six boats which had so cruelly cast them adrift, reached the coast
of Africa in safety; and after many dangers among the Moors, the
survivors arrived at St. Louis.

After this, a vessel was despatched to the wreck of the Medusa, to carry
away the money and provisions; after beating about for eight days, she
was forced to return. She again put to sea, but after being away five
days, again came back. Ten days more were lost in repairing her; and she
did not reach the spot till fifty-two days after the vessel had been
lost; and dreadful to relate, three miserable sufferers were found on
board. Sixty men had been abandoned there by their magnanimous
countrymen. All these had been carried off except seventeen, some of
whom were drunk, and others refused to leave the vessel. They remained
at peace as long as their provisions lasted. Twelve embarked on board a
raft, for Sahara, and were never more heard of. Another put to sea on a
hen-coop, and sunk immediately. Four remained behind, one of whom,
exhausted with hunger and fatigue, perished. The other three lived in
separate corners of the wreck, and never met but to run at each other
with drawn _knives_. They were put on board the vessel, with all that
could be saved from the wreck of the Medusa.

The vessel was no sooner seen returning to St. Louis, than every heart
beat high with joy, in the hope of recovering some property. The men and
officers of the Medusa jumped on board, and asked if any thing had been
saved. "Yes," was the reply, "but it is all ours now;" and the naked
Frenchmen, whose calamities had found pity from the Moors of the desert,
were now deliberately plundered by their own countrymen.

A fair was held in the town, which lasted eight days. The clothes,
furniture, and necessary articles of life, belonging to the men and
officers of the Medusa, were publicly sold before their faces. Such of
the French as were able, proceeded to the camp at Daceard, and the sick
remained at St. Louis. The French governor had promised them clothes
and provisions, but sent none; and during five months, they owed their
existence to strangers--to the British.




SINGULAR LOSS OF THE SHIP ESSEX, SUNK BY A WHALE.


The ship Essex, Captain George Pollard, sailed from Nantucket, on the
12th of August, 1819, on a whaling voyage to the Pacific Ocean. Her crew
consisted of twenty-one men, fourteen of whom were whites, mostly
belonging to Nantucket, the remainder were blacks. On the 20th of
November, 1820, in latitude 0° 40' S. longitude 119° W. a school of
whales was discovered, and in pursuing them the mate's boat was stove,
which obliged him to return to the ship, when they commenced repairing
the damage. The captain and second mate were left with their boats
pursuing the whales. During this interval the mate discovered a large
spermaceti whale, near the ship, but, not suspecting the approach of any
danger, it gave them no alarm, until they saw the whale coming with full
speed towards them. In a moment they were astonished by a tremendous
crash. The whale had struck the ship a little forward of the fore
chains. It was some minutes before the crew recovered from their
astonishment, so far as to examine whether any damage had been
sustained. They then tried their pumps, and found that the ship was
sinking. A signal was immediately set for the boats. The whale now
appeared again making for the ship, and coming with great velocity, with
the water foaming around him, he struck the ship a second blow, which
nearly stove in her bows. There was now no hope of saving the ship, and
the only course to be pursued was, to prepare to leave her with all
possible haste. They collected a few things, hove them into the boat and
shoved off. The ship immediately fell upon one side and sunk to the
water's edge. When the captain's and second mate's boat arrived, such
was the consternation, that for some time not a word was spoken. The
danger of their situation at length aroused them, as from a terrific
dream, to a no less terrific reality. They remained by the wreck two or
three days, in which time they cut away the masts, which caused her to
right a little. Holes were then cut in the deck, by which means they
obtained about six hundred pounds of bread, and as much water as they
could take, besides other articles likely to be of use to them. On the
22d of November, they left the ship, with as gloomy a prospect before
them as can well be imagined. The nearest land was about one thousand
miles to the windward of them; they were in open boats, weak and leaky,
with a very small pittance of bread and water for support of so many
men, during the time they must necessarily be at sea. Sails had been
prepared for the boats, before leaving the ship, which proved of
material benefit. Steering southerly by the wind, they hoped to fall in
with some ship, but in this they were disappointed. After being in the
boat twenty-eight days, experiencing many sufferings by gales of wind,
want of water, and scanty provisions, they arrived at Duncie's Island,
latitude 24° 40' S., longitude 124° 40' W., where they were disappointed
in not finding a sufficiency of any kind of food for so large a company
to subsist on. Their boats being very weak and leaky, they were hauled
on shore and repaired. They found a gentle spring of fresh water,
flowing out of a rock, at about half ebb of the tide, from which they
filled their kegs. Three of the men chose to stay on the island, and
take their chance for some vessel to take them off.

On the 27th of December, they left this island, and steered for Easter
Island; but passed it far to the leeward. They then directed their
course for Juan Fernandez, which was about twenty-five hundred miles
east by south-east from them. On the 10th of January, 1821, Matthew P.
Joy, the second mate, died, and his body was launched into the deep. His
constitution was slender, and it was supposed that his sufferings,
though great, were not the immediate cause of his death. On the 12th,
the mate's boat separated from the other two, and did not fall in with
them afterwards. The situation of the mate and his crew, became daily
more and more distressing. The weather was mostly calm, the sun hot and
scorching. They were growing weaker and weaker by want of food, and yet,
such was their distance from land, that they were obliged to lessen
their allowance nearly one half. On the 20th, a black man died.

On the 28th, they found, on calculation, that their allowance, only one
and a half ounce of bread per day to a man, would be exhausted in
fourteen days; and that this allowance was not sufficient to sustain
life. They therefore determined to extend the indulgence, and take the
consequence, whether to live or die. On the 8th of February, another of
the crew died. From this time to the 17th, their sufferings were
extreme. At seven o'clock, A.M. of that day, they were aroused from a
lethargy by the cheering cry of the steersman, "there's a sail!" The
boat was soon descried by the vessel, the brig Indian, Captain Grozier,
of London, which took them on board, latitude 33° 45' S., longitude 81°
3' W. They were treated by Captain Grozier with all the care and
tenderness which their weak condition required. On the same day they
made Massafuero, and on the 25th, arrived at Valparaiso.

Captain Pollard and Charles Ramsdell, the only survivors in the
captain's boat, were taken up on the 23d of February, 1821, by the ship
Dauphin, of Nantucket, Captain Zimri Coffin, in latitude 37° S. off St.
Mary's. The captain relates, that, after the mate's boat was separated
from the others, they made what progress their weak condition would
permit, towards the island of Juan Fernandez, but contrary winds and
calm weather, together with the extreme debility of the crew, prevented
their making much progress.

On the 29th of January, the second mate's boat separated from the
captain's, in the night, at which time their provisions were totally
exhausted, since which they have not been heard from.

We shall not attempt a sketch of the sufferings of the crews of these
boats. Imagination may picture the horrors of their situation, and the
extremes to which they were driven to sustain life, but no power of the
imagination can heighten the dreadful reality.

The following is an account of the whole crew.

In the captain's boat but two survived, Captain Pollard and Charles
Ramsdell. In the mate's boat three survived, Owen Chase, the mate,
Benjamin Lawrence, and Thomas Nickerson. Left on Duncie's Island, and
afterwards taken off, Seth Weeks, William Wright, and Thomas Chapple.
One left the ship before the accident. In the second mate's boat, when
separated from the captain's, three. Dead, nine, which added to the
second mate's crew, doubtless lost, makes total deaths twelve.




LOSS OF THE WELLINGTON.


We sailed from the Cove of Cork for St. Andrews, on the 6th of October,
1833. During a passage of sixty days, all of which time we struggled
against adverse winds, nothing material occurred, save the shifting of
our ballast, (limestone,) which caused some alarm; but the promptitude
and alacrity of the crew soon set it all right. On reaching the
ballast-ground, we discharged our ballast; and after we had repaired the
rigging, we took in a cargo of deals. Here four of the men left us, and
we had to wait for others to supply their place.

On the 23d of December we sailed on our return to Cork; mustering in all
seventeen persons, including one male and one female passenger. With a
fine stiff breeze down the bay, we soon lost sight of land, and nothing
of note occurred till the 30th, when the wind got up from the
north-west, and soon blew so heavy a gale, that we were obliged to take
in every thing but a close-reefed main-topsail, under which we scudded
till the 5th of January. All this time it blew a hurricane, principally
from the north-west, but occasionally, after a short lull, flying round
to the south-west, with a fury that nothing could resist. The sea
threatened to overwhelm our little craft. It was several times proposed
to lay her to; but the fatal opinion prevailed that she did better in
scudding. On the night of the 6th, a tremendous sea struck her on the
stern, stove in all the dead-lights, and washed them into the cabin,
lifted the taffrail a foot or more out of its place, carried away the
afterpart of the larboard bulwark, shattered the whole of the
stern-frame, and washed one of the steersmen away from the wheel. The
carpenter and crew with much labor secured the stern as well as they
could for the night, and next morning the wind moderated a little, new
dead-lights were put in, and the damages further repaired.

Every stitch of canvas, but the main-topsail, jib, and trysail, were
split into ribbons, so that we became anxious to know how we should
reach port when the gale subsided. But we were soon spared further care
on that head. As the day closed in, the tempest resumed its fury, and by
the following morning, (the 8th,) raged with such appalling violence,
that we laid her too. From her straining, the brig had now began to make
so much water, as to require all hands in succession at the pumps till
the following morning at two, when the larboard watch went below, the
watch on deck, by constant exertion, sufficing to keep her free.

At seven on the morning of the 9th, a tremendous sea broke over the
starboard bow, overwhelming all, and sweeping caboose, boats, planks,
casks, every thing before it, to the afterpart of the deck; even the
starboard anchor was lifted on to the forecastle; and and the cook, who
was in the galley, washed with all his culinary apparatus into the
lee-scuppers, where he remained some time in a very perilous situation,
jammed in amongst the loose spars and other portions of the wreck, until
extricated by the watch on deck, who, being aft at the moment of the
occurrence, escaped unhurt. Before we could recover from this shock, the
watch below rushed on deck, with the appalling intelligence, that the
water had found its way below, and was pouring in like a torrent We
found that the coppers, forced along the deck with irresistible
violence, had, by striking a stanchen fixed firmly in the deck, split
the covering fore and aft, and let in the water. The captain thought it
time to prepare for the worst. As the ship, from her buoyant cargo,
could not sink, he ordered the crew to store the top with provisions.
And as all exerted themselves with the energy of despair, two barrels of
beef, some hams, pork, butter, cheese, and a large jar of brandy, were
handed in a trice up from below, but not before the water had nearly
filled the cabin, and forced those employed there to cease their
operations, and with the two unfortunate passengers to fly to the deck.
Fortunately for the latter, they knew not the full horror of our
situation. The poor lady, whose name I have forgotten, young and
delicate, already suffering from confinement below and sea sickness,
pale and shivering, but patient and resigned, had but a short time taken
her seat beside her fellow passenger on some planks near the taffrail,
on which lay extended the unfortunate cook, unable to move from his
bruises, when the vessel, a heavy lurch having shifted her cargo, was
laid on her beam-ends, and the water rushing in, carried every thing
off the deck--provisions, stores, planks, all went adrift--and with the
latter, the poor lady, who, with the cook, floated away on them, without
the possibility of our saving either of them. But such was the
indescribable horror of those who were left, that had we been able to
reason or reflect we might have envied our departed shipmates.

A few minutes before we went over, two of the crew, invalids, having
gone to the maintop, one of them was forced into the belly of the main
top-sail, and there found a watery grave. The rest of the crew, and the
male passenger, got upon her side. In this hopeless situation, secured,
and clinging to the channels and rigging, the sea every instant dashing
over us, and threatening destruction, we remained some hours. Then the
vessel once more righted, and we crawled on board. The deck having blown
up, and the stern gone the same way, we had now the prospect of
perishing with cold and hunger. For our ultimate preservation I conceive
we were mainly indebted to the carpenter's having providentially
retained his axe. With it, the foremast was cut away. While doing this,
we found a piece of pork about four pounds weight; and even the
possession of this morsel raised our drooping spirits. It would at least
prolong existence a few hours, and in that interval, the gale might
abate, some friendly sail heave in sight, and the elements relent. Such
were our reflections. Oh, how our eye-balls strained, as, emerging from
the trough of the sea on the crest of a liquid mountain, we gazed on the
misty horizon, until, from time to time, we fancied, nay, felt assured,
we saw the object of our search, but the evening closed in, and with it
hope almost expired. That day, not a morsel passed our lips. The pork,
our only supply, given in charge to the captain, it was thought prudent
to husband as long as possible.

Meanwhile, with a top-gallant studding-sail remaining in the top, which
was stretched over the mast-head, we contrived to procure a partial
shelter from the inclemency of the weather. Under this, drenched as we
were and shivering with cold, some of us crouched for the night; but
others of the crew remained all that night in the rigging. In the
morning we all--fourteen in number--mustered on deck, and received from
the mate a small piece of pork, about two ounces, the remainder being
put away, and reserved for the next day. This, and some water, the only
article of which--a cask had been discovered forward, well stowed away
among the planks--we had abundance, constituted our only meal that day.
Somewhat refreshed, we all went to work, and as the studding-sail
afforded but a scanty shelter, we fitted the trysail for this purpose;
on opening which we found the cat drowned, and much as our stomachs
might have revolted against such food on ordinary occasions, yet poor
puss was instantly skinned and her carcass hung up in the maintop.

This night we were somewhat better lodged, and the following day, having
received our scanty ration of pork, now nearly consumed, we got three
swiftsures round the hull of the vessel, to prevent her from going to
pieces. Foraging daily for food, we sought incessantly in every
crevice, hole, and corner, but in vain. We were now approaching that
state of suffering beyond which nature cannot carry us. With some,
indeed, they were already past endurance; and one individual, who had
left a wife and family dependent upon him for support in London, unable
any longer to bear up against them, and the almost certain prospect of
starvation, went down out of the top, and we saw him no more. Having
eked out the pork until the fourth day, we commenced on the
cat--fortunately large and in good condition--a mouthful of which, with
some water, furnished our daily allowance.

Sickness and debility had now made such ravages among us all, that
although we had a tolerable stock of water, we found great difficulty in
procuring it. We had hitherto, in rotation, taken our turn to fill a
small beaker at the cask, wedged in among the cargo of deals; but now,
scarcely able to keep our feet along the planks, and still less so to
haul the vessel up to the top, we were in danger of even this resource
being cut off from us. In this manner, incredible as it may seem, we
managed to keep body and soul together till the eleventh day; our only
sustenance, the pork, the cat, water, and the bark of some young birch
trees, which latter, in searching for a keg of tamarinds, which we had
hoped to find, we had latterly come athwart.

On the twelfth morning, at daybreak, the hailing of some one from the
deck electrified us all. Supposing, as we had missed none of our
shipmates from the top, that it must be some boat or vessel, we all
eagerly made a movement to answer our supposed deliverers, and such was
our excitement that it well nigh upset what little reason we had left.
We soon found out our mistake. We saw that one of the party was missing;
and from this individual, whom we had found without shoes, hat, or
jacket, had the voice proceeded.

Despair had now taken such complete hold, that, suspended between life
and death, a torpor had seized us, and, resigned to our fate, we had
scarcely sufficient energy to lift our heads, and exercise the only
faculty on which depended our safety. The delirium of our unfortunate
shipmate had, however, reanimated us, and by this means, through
Providence, he was made instrumental to our deliverance. Not long after,
one of the men suddenly exclaimed, "This is Sunday morning!--The Lord
will deliver us from our distress!--at any rate I will take a look
round." With this he arose, and having looked about him a few minutes,
the cheering cry of "a sail!" announced the fulfilment of this singular
prophecy. "Yes," he repeated in answer to our doubts, "a sail, and
bearing right down upon us!"

We all eagerly got up, and looking in the direction indicated to us, the
welcome certainty, that we were not cheated of our hopes almost turned
our brains. The vessel, which proved to be a Boston brig, bound to
London, ran down across our bows, hove too, sent the boats alongside,
and by ten o'clock we were all safe on board. Singularly enough, our
brig, which had been lying-to with her head to the northward and
westward, since the commencement of our disasters, went about the
evening previous to our quitting her as well as if she had been under
sail,--another providential occurrence, for had she remained with her
head to the northward, we should have seen nothing of our deliverers.
From the latter we experienced all the care and attention our deplorable
condition required; and, with the exception of two of the party, who
were frost-bitten, and who died two days after our quitting the wreck,
we were soon restored to health, and reached St. Catherine's Dock on the
30th of the following month.

[Illustration: VOYAGE OF THE ABERGAVENNY.]




LOSS OF THE ABERGAVENNY.


The Earl of Abergavenny, East Indiaman, left Portsmouth, in the
beginning of February, 1805, with forty passengers, and property to the
value of eighty-nine thousand pounds sterling on board. On the 5th of
February, at ten A.M. when she was about ten leagues to the westward of
Portland, the commodore gave a signal for her to bear up. At this time
the wind was west south-west; she had the main top-mast struck, the fore
and mizzen top-gallant mast on deck, and the jib-boom in. At three a
pilot came on board, when they were about two leagues west from
Portland; the cables were ranged and bitted, and the jib-boom got out.
The wind suddenly died away as she crossed the Shangles, a shoal of rock
and shingle, about two miles from the land; and a strong tide setting
the ship to westward, drifted her into the breakers. A sea taking her on
the larboard quarter brought her to, with her head to the northward,
when she instantly struck the ground, at five in afternoon. All the
reefs were let out, and the top-sails hoisted up, in the hope that the
ship might shoot across the reef; the wind shifting meanwhile to
north-west, she remained there two hours and a half, with four feet of
water in the hold, the tide alternately setting her on, and the surf
driving her back, beating all the while with such violent shocks, that
the men for some time could scarcely stand upon the decks. At length,
however, she was got off the rocks.

The pumps were kept constantly going, and for fifteen minutes after
clearing the rocks, kept the water at four feet; but the leak gaining
upon them, all sails were set, with the view of running for the nearest
port. But the water now rose so fast, than she refused to answer the
helm, and they resolved to run her on the first shore. The captain and
officers still thought that she might be got off without material
damage, and no signal guns of distress were fired for three quarters of
an hour, though sensible of some danger, they kept silent, lest they
should alarm the passengers. Soon however the peril appeared but too
manifest; the carpenter announced that a leak was at the bottom of the
chain-pumps, through which the water gushed so fast, that they could not
stop it. Eleven feet of water were already in the hold, and the crew
were set to bale at the fore scuttle and hatchway. Though they could not
keep the water under, they still hoped to preserve her afloat, till she
could be run upon Weymouth sand. The lashings of the boats were cut;
but they could not get out the long-boat, without bending the mainsail
aback, which would have retarded the vessel so much, as to deprive them
of the chance of running her aground.

At six in the afternoon they gave up all hope of saving the vessel;
other leaks had been sprung, and it became manifest, from the damage she
had sustained that she must speedily go down. The captain and officers
were still cool, and preserved perfect subordination. As night came on,
and their situation became more terrible, several passengers insisted on
being set on shore; and some small sloops being near, one of which sent
off a skiff, two ladies, and three other passengers went away in her.
More would have embarked had they not feared to encounter a tempestuous
sea in so dark a night.

Several boats were heard at a short distance, about nine o'clock, but
they rendered no assistance; being either engaged in plunder, or in
rescuing some of those unfortunate individuals who hazarded themselves
on pieces of wreck, to gain the land. Those on board baled and pumped
without intermission; the cadets and passengers struggling with the
rest. A midshipman was appointed to guard the spirit room. Some of the
more disorderly sailors pressed upon him. "Give us some grog," they
cried, "it will be all one an hour hence." "I know we must die," replied
he, coolly, "but let us die like men;" and armed with a brace of
pistols, he kept his post even while the ship was sinking.

At length the carpenter came up from below, and told those who worked at
the pumps that he could do no more. Some gave themselves up to despair,
others prayed; and some resolved not to perish without a struggle,
committed themselves on pieces of the wreck to the waves. The chief mate
came to the captain, and said, "We have done all we can, sir, the ship
will sink in a moment;" to which the captain replied, "it cannot be
helped--God's will be done." The vessel gradually settled in the trough
of the sea. The cries of the drowning rose above the sound of the
waters, and were heard at a great distance. Some kept running about the
deck as long as it kept above the waves. At eleven, when she went down,
many hastened up the shrouds and masts. The captain was seen clinging to
the ropes; the fourth mate tried to persuade him to exert himself, but
he submitted without resistance to his fate.

The hull struck the ground, while part of the masts and rigging remained
above water. On the last cast of the lead, eleven fathoms had been
found, and about one hundred and eighty men still clung to the rigging.
The night was dark and frosty, the sea incessantly breaking upon them.
Shocking scenes occurred, in the attempts made by some to obtain places
of greater safety. One seaman had ascended to a considerable height, and
endeavored to climb yet higher; another seized hold of his leg; he drew
his clasp-knife, and deliberately cut the miserable wretch's fingers
asunder; he dropped and was killed by the fall. Many perished in the
shrouds. A sergeant had secured his wife there; she lost her hold, and
in her last struggle for life, bit a large piece from her husband's arm,
which was dreadfully lacerated.

About an hour after she went down, the survivors were cheered by hearing
the sound of vessels beating the waves at a distance; they hailed a
sloop-rigged vessel, with two boats astern of her. Their voices must
have been drowned by the waves. By twelve many more had perished. Some
from cold and fatigue could no longer retain their hold; every instant
those who still hung on, were shocked by the splash, which told that
another of their number had yielded to his fate. In a short time, boats
were again heard near them, but they did not, though repeatedly hailed,
come near enough to take any on board; an act of cold and calculating
timidity, which could not be justified by the excuse, that they feared
lest all, eager to be saved, should have jumped down, and borne them to
the bottom.

At length two sloops, which had heard the guns of distress, anchored
close to the wreck, took off the survivors, twenty at a time, from the
shrouds, and in the morning conveyed them to Weymouth; so far from
crowding into the boats, they got off one by one, as called upon by
those who commanded the boats. One still remained; the sixth mate
ascended the mast and found him in a state of insensibility; he bore him
down on his back, and with his burden reached the boat in safety; but
the delivered person died the next day.

When the awful words were heard, "The ship must go down," three of the
cadets went into the cabin, where they stood for a short time, looking
at each other, without saying a word. At length one said, "Let us return
to the deck;" two did so, but the other remained below. He opened his
desk, took out his commission, his introductory letters, and some money,
went on deck, but saw neither of his companions. Then looking forward,
he saw the ship going down head foremost, and the sea rolling in an
immense column along the deck. He tried to ascend the steps leading to
the poop, but was launched among the waves encumbered by boots and a
great coat, and unable to swim. Afterwards, finding himself on the
opposite side, he conceived that when the stern of the ship sunk, he
would be drawn into the vortex. While struggling to keep himself afloat,
he seized something which frequently struck the back of his hand, and
found it to be a rope hanging from the mizzen-shrouds. Trying to ascend
several feet by it, he fell into the sea; but by a sudden lurch from the
ship, he was thrown into the mizzen-shrouds, where he fixed himself as
well as circumstances would allow.




CRUISE OF THE SALDANHA AND TALBOT.

BY ONE OF THE OFFICERS.


At midnight of Saturday, the 30th of November, 1811, with a fair wind
and a smooth sea, we weighed from our station, in company with the
Saldanha frigate, of thirty-eight guns, Captain Packenham, with a crew
of three hundred men, on a cruise, as was intended, of twenty days--the
Saldanha taking a westerly course, while we stood in the opposite
direction.

We had scarcely got out of the lock and cleared the heads, however, when
we plunged at once into all the miseries of a gale of wind blowing from
the west. During the three following days it continued to increase in
violence, when the islands of Coll and Tiree became visible to us. As
the wind had now chopped round more to the north, and continued unabated
in violence, the danger of getting involved among the numerous small
islands and rugged headlands, on the north-west coast of
Inverness-shire, became evident. It was therefore deemed expedient to
wear the ship round, and make a port with all expedition. With this
view, and favored by the wind, a course was shaped for Lochswilly, and
away we scudded under close-reefed foresail and main-topsail, followed
by a tremendous sea, which threatened every moment to overwhelm us, and
accompanied by piercing showers of hail, and a gale which blew with
incredible fury. The same course was steered until next day about noon,
when land was seen on the lee-bow. The weather being thick, some time
elapsed before it could be distinctly made out, and it was then
ascertained to be the island of North Arran, on the coast of Donegal,
westward of Lochswilly. The ship was therefore hauled up some points,
and we yet entertained hopes of reaching an anchorage before nightfall,
when the weather gradually thickened, and the sea, now that we were upon
the wind, broke over us in all directions. Its violence was such, that
in a few minutes several of our ports were stove in, at which the water
poured in in great abundance, until it was actually breast high on the
lee-side of the main deck. Fortunately, but little got below, and the
ship was relieved by taking in the foresail. But a dreadful addition was
now made to the precariousness of our situation, by the cry of "land
a-head!" which was seen from the forecastle, and must have been very
near. Not a moment was now lost in wearing the ship round on the other
tack, and making what little sail could be carried, to weather the land
we had already passed. This soon proved, however, to be a forlorn
prospect, for it was found that we should run our distance by ten
o'clock. All the horrors of shipwreck now stared us in the face,
aggravated tenfold by the darkness of the night, and the tremendous
force of the wind, which now blew a hurricane. Mountains are
insignificant when speaking of the sea that kept pace with it; its
violence was awful beyond description, and it frequently broke over all
the poor little ship, that shivered and groaned, but behaved admirably.

The force of the sea may be guessed from the fact of the sheet-anchor,
nearly a ton and a half in weight, being actually lifted on board, to
say nothing of the forechain-plates' board broken, both gangways torn
away, quarter-galleries stove in, &c. In short, on getting into port,
the vessel was found to be loosened through all her frame, and leaking
at every seam. As far as depended on her good qualities, however, I felt
assured at the time we were safe, for I had seen enough of the Talbot
to be convinced we were in one of the finest sea-boats that ever swam.
But what could all the skill of the ship builder avail in a situation
like ours? With a night full fifteen hours long before us, and knowing
that we were fast driving on the land, anxiety and dread were on every
face, and every mind felt the terrors of uncertainty and suspense. At
length, about twelve o'clock, the dreadful truth was disclosed to us!

Judge of my sensation when I saw the frowning rocks of Arran, scarcely
half a mile distant, on our lee-bow. To our inexpressible relief, and
not less to our surprise, we fairly weathered all, and were
congratulating each other on our escape, when on looking forward I
imagined I saw breakers at no great distance on our lee; and this
suspicion was soon confirmed, when the moon, which shone at intervals,
suddenly broke out from behind a cloud, and presented to us a most
terrific spectacle. At not more than a quarter of a mile's distance on
our lee-beam, appeared a range of tremendous breakers, amongst which it
seemed as if every sea would throw us. Their height, it may be guessed,
was prodigious, when they could be clearly distinguished from the
foaming waters of the surrounded ocean. It was a scene seldom to be
witnessed, and never forgotten! "Lord have mercy on us!" was now on the
lip of everyone--destruction seemed inevitable. Captain Swaine, whose
coolness I have never seen surpassed issued his orders clearly and
collectedly when it was proposed as a last resource to drop the anchors,
cut away the masts, and trust to the chance of riding out the gale. This
scheme was actually determined on, and every thing was in readiness, but
happily was deferred until an experiment was tried aloft In addition to
the close-reefed main-topsail and foresail, the fore-topsail and trysail
were now set, and the result was almost magical. With a few plunges we
cleared not only the reef, but a huge rock upon which I could with ease
have tossed a biscuit, and in a few minutes we were inexpressibly
rejoiced to observe both far astern.

We had now miraculously escaped all but certain destruction a second
time, but much was yet to be feared. We had still to pass Cape Jeller,
and the moments dragged on in gloomy apprehension and anxious suspense.
The ship carried sail most wonderfully, and we continued to go along at
the rate of seven knots, shipping very heavy seas, and laboring
much--all with much solicitude looking out for daylight. The dawn at
length appeared, and to our great joy we saw the land several miles
astern, having passed the Cape and many other hidden dangers during the
darkness.

Matters on the morning of the 5th, assumed a very different aspect from
that which we had experienced for the last two days; the wind gradually
subsided, and with it the sea, and a favorable breeze now springing up,
we were enabled to make a good offing. Fortunately no accident of
consequence occurred, although several of our people were severely
bruised by falls. Poor fellows! they certainly suffered enough; not a
dry stitch, not a dry hammock have they had since we sailed. Happily,
however, their misfortunes are soon forgot in a dry shirt and a can of
grog.

The most melancholy part of the narrative is still to be told. On coming
up to our anchorage, we observed an unusual degree of curiosity and
bustle in the fort; crowds of people were congregated on both sides,
running to and fro, examining us through spy-glasses; in short, an
extraordinary commotion was apparent. The meaning of all this was but
too soon made known to us by a boat coming alongside, from which we
learned that the unfortunate Saldanha had gone to pieces, and every man
perished! Our own destruction had likewise been reckoned inevitable from
the time of the discovery of the unhappy fate of our consort, five days
beforehand; and hence the astonishment at our unexpected return. From
all that could be learned concerning the dreadful catastrophe, I am
inclined to believe that the Saldanha had been driven on the rocks about
the time our doom appeared so certain in another quarter. Her lights
were seen by the signal-tower at nine o'clock of that fearful Wednesday
night, December 4th, after which it is supposed she went ashore on the
rocks at a small bay called Ballymastaker, almost at the entrance of
Lochswilly harbor.

Next morning the beach was strewed with fragments of the wreck, and
upwards of two hundred of the bodies of the unfortunate sufferers were
washed ashore. One man--and one only--out of the three hundred, was
ascertained to have come ashore alive, but almost in a state of
insensibility. Unhappily there was no person present to administer to
his wants judiciously, and upon craving something to drink, about half a
pint of whisky was given him by the people, which almost instantly
killed him! Poor Pakenham's body was recognised amidst the others, and
like these, stripped quite naked by the inhuman wretches, who flocked to
the wreck as to a blessing! It is even suspected that he came on shore
alive, but was stripped and left to perish. Nothing could equal the
audacity of the plunderers, although a party of the Lanark militia was
doing duty around the wreck. But this is an ungracious and revolting
subject, which no one of proper feeling would wish to dwell upon. Still
less am I inclined so describe the heart-rending scene at Buncrana,
where the widows of many of the sufferers are residing. The surgeon's
wife, a native of Halifax, has never spoken since the dreadful tidings
arrived. Consolation is inadmissible, and no one has yet ventured to
offer it.




SHIPWRECK OF THE NAUTILUS.


The ship Nautilus, Captain Palmer, with important despatches for
England, sailed from the Dardanelles, on the 30th of January, 1807.
Passing through the islands which abound in the Greek Archipelago, she
approached the Negropont, where the navigation became both intricate
and dangerous. The wind blew fresh, and the night was dark and squally;
the pilot, a Greek, advised them to lay-to till morning; at daylight she
again went on her course, passing in the evening, Falconera and
Anti-Milo. The pilot, who had never gone farther on this tack, here
relinquished the management of the vessel to the captain, who, anxious
to get on, resolved to proceed during the night, confidently expecting
to clear the Archipelago by morning; he then went below, to take some
rest, after marking out on the chest the course which he meant to steer.

[Illustration: SHIPWRECK OF THE NAUTILUS.]

The night was extremely dark, vivid lightning at times flashed through
the horizon. The wind increased; and though the ship carried but little
sail, she went at the rate of nine miles an hour, borne on by a high
sea, which, with the brightness of the lightning, made the night appear
awful. At half past two in the morning, they saw high land, which they
took for the island of Cerigotto, and went confidently on, supposing
that all danger was over. At half-past four, the man on the look-out,
cried, "breakers a-head!" and instantly the vessel struck with a
tremendous crash; the violence of the shock being such, that those below
were thrown from their beds, and on coming on deck, were compelled to
cling to the cordage. All was confusion and alarm; scarcely had part of
the crew time to hurry on deck, before the ladder gave way, leaving
numbers struggling with the water, which rushed in at the bottom. The
captain and lieutenant endeavored to mitigate the fears of the people;
and afterwards, going down to the cabin, burnt the papers and private
signals. Meantime, every sea dashed the vessel against the rocks; and
they were soon compelled to climb the rigging, where they remained an
hour, the surge continually breaking upon them.

The lightning had ceased, but so dark was the night, that they could not
see a ship's length before them; their only hope rested in the falling
of the main mast, which they trusted would reach a small rock, which lay
very near them. About half an hour before morning, the mast gave way,
providentially falling towards the rock, and by means of it they were
enabled to gain the land. In this hasty struggle to get to the rock,
many accidents occurred; some were drowned, one man had his arm broke,
and many were much hurt. The captain was the last man who left the
vessel, refusing to quit it till all had gained the rock. All the boats
but one had been staved in pieces; the jolly-boat indeed remained, but
they could not haul it in. For a time the hull of the wreck sheltered
them from the violence of the surf; but it soon broke up, and it became
necessary to abandon the small rock on which they stood, and to wade to
another somewhat larger. In their way they encountered many loose spars,
dashing about in the channel; several in crossing were severely hurt by
them. They felt grievously the loss of their shoes, for the sharp rocks
tore their feet dreadfully, and their legs were covered with blood. In
the morning they saw the sea covered with the fragments of the wreck,
and many of their comrades floating about on spars and timbers, to whom
they could not give any assistance.

They saw that they were cast away on a coral rock almost on a level with
the sea, about four hundred yards long, and three hundred broad. They
were at least twelve miles from the nearest islands, which were
afterwards found to be those of Cerigotto and Pera. In case any vessel
should pass by, they hoisted a signal of distress on a long pole. The
weather was very cold, and the day before they were wrecked, the deck
had been covered with ice; with much difficulty they managed to kindle a
fire, by means of a flint and some powder. They erected a small tent,
composed of pieces of canvas and boards, and were thus enabled to dry
their few clothes. The night was dreary and comfortless; but they
consoled themselves with the hope that their fire might be descried in
the dark, and taken for a signal of distress. Next day they were
delighted at the approach of a small whale-boat, manned by ten of their
comrades. When the vessel was wrecked, these men had lowered themselves
into the water, and had reached the island of Pera, but finding no fresh
water, were compelled to depart; and noticing the fire were enabled to
join their shipmates. But the waves ran so high that the boat could not
come to the shore, and some of those on the land endeavored to reach it.
One of the seamen called to Captain Palmer, inviting him to come to
them, but he steadily refused, saying, "No, Smith, save your unfortunate
shipmates; never mind me." After some consultation, they resolved to
take the Greek pilot on board, intending to go to Cerigotto, where, he
assured them, were a few families of fishermen, who might perhaps be
able to afford them some relief.

After the boat departed, the wind increased; in about two hours a
fearful storm came on. The waves mounted up, and extinguished their
fire; they swept over nearly the whole of the rock, compelling them to
flee for refuge to the highest part. Thus did nearly ninety pass a night
of the utmost horror; being compelled, lest they should be washed off,
to fasten a rope round the summit of a rock, and to clasp each other.
Their fatigue had been so great that several of them became delirious,
and lost their hold. They were also in constant terror of the wind
veering more to the north, in which case the waves would have dashed
over their position.

They now began to sink under their hardships, and many had suffered
deplorably. One had been so dashed against the rocks as to be nearly
scalped, exhibiting a dreadful spectacle; he lingered out the night, but
expired next morning. They were ill prepared to sustain famine, and they
were almost hopeless of escape. They dreaded lest the storm should come
on before the boat could have reached the island, for on her safety
their own depended. In the midst of these horrors the daylight broke,
and they saw the bodies of their departed shipmates, some still writhing
in the agonies of death. The sea had broken over them all night, and
some, among whom was the carpenter, had perished from cold.

Soon after, a vessel approached, and their hearts beat high with the
hope of deliverance. All her sails were set, and she came down before
the wind, steering right for the rock. They made repeated signals of
distress, and the vessel hove to, and hoisted out her boat. They hastily
prepared rafts to carry them through the surf, confident that the boat
was provided with supplies to relieve them. The boat came within
pistol-shot, full of men dressed in the European fashion. But what were
their indignation and grief, when the person who steered, after gazing
at them a few minutes, waved his hat, and then rowed off to the ship!
Their misery was increased by seeing the crew of the stranger-vessel
employed in collecting the floating fragments of the wreck. After this
grievous disappointment, their only hopes lay in the return of the boat.
They looked in vain; not a glimpse of her was to be seen. A raging
thirst tormented them; and some, in spite of warning, drank salt water;
raging madness soon followed, and their agonies were terminated by
death. Another awful night was passed by them. To preserve themselves
from the cold, they huddled close together, and covered themselves with
their few remaining rags. They were haunted by the ravings of those who
had drunk the sea-water, whom they tried in vain to pacify.

About twelve o'clock, the crew of the whale-boat hailed them; they cried
out in their agony for water. They could not procure it, for those in
the boat had none but earthen vessels, which could not be conveyed
through the surf. They were assured that they would be taken off by a
fishing vessel next morning; but there seemed to be little chance of
their surviving till then.

In the morning, the sun for the first time shone upon the rock. They
waited hour after hour, but there was no appearance either of the boat
or the vessel. Famine consumed them; but they looked with loathing on
the only means of appeasing it. When, however, the day wore on, after
praying for forgiveness of the sinful act, they were compelled to feed
on one of their number who had died the preceding night. Several
expired towards evening; among whom were the captain and first
lieutenant. During the night, some thought of constructing a raft which
might carry them to Cerigotto. The wind seemed favorable; and to perish
in the waters seemed preferable to remaining to die a lingering death
from hunger and thirst. At daylight, as fast as their feeble strength
permitted, they prepared to put their plan in execution, by lashing
together a number of larger spars. Scarcely had they launched it, when
it was destroyed. Five, rendered desperate, embarked on a few spars
hastily lashed together, which gave them scarcely room to stand; they
were soon carried away by unknown currents, and were no more heard of.

In the afternoon the whale-boat came again in sight. The crew told them
that they had experienced great difficulty in persuading the Greek
fishermen of Cerigotto to venture to put to sea, because of the stormy
weather; but they gave them hopes, that if the weather moderated, the
boats would come next day. Before they had done speaking, twelve men
plunged from the rock into the sea, and nearly reached the boat; two
were taken in, one was drowned, and the rest were so fortunate as to
recover their former station.

As the day wore on, their weakness increased. One of the survivors
described himself as feeling the approach of annihilation; his sight
failed, and his senses were confused; his strength was exhausted; he
looked towards the setting sun, expecting never to see it rise again.
Suddenly the approach of the boats was announced; and from the depth of
despair, they rose to the very summit of joy. Their parched frames were
refreshed with copious draughts of water.

Immediate preparations were made for departure. Of one hundred and
twenty-two persons on board the Nautilus, when she struck, fifty-eight
had perished. Eighteen were drowned when she was wrecked, five were lost
in the small boat, and thirty-four died of famine. About fifty now
embarked in four fishing vessels, and landed the same evening at
Cerigotto; making sixty-four in all, including those saved in the
whale-boat. During their six days sojourn on the rock, they had nothing
to subsist on, save human flesh.

They landed at a small creek. The Greeks received them with great
hospitality, but had not skill to cure their wounds, and had no bandages
but those procured by tearing up their own shirts. Wishing to procure
some medical assistance, they desired to reach Cerigo, an island twenty
miles distant, on which an English vice-consul resided. Fourteen days
elapsed before they could set sail. They bade adieu to these kind
preservers, and in six or eight hours reached Cerigo, where all possible
help was afforded them. Thence they were conveyed by a Russian ship to
Corfu; where they arrived on the 2d of March, 1807, about two months
after their melancholy disaster.




GALLANT EXPLOITS OF COMMODORE DECATUR.


Decatur is one of the most illustrious names in the naval annals of
America. Among the many officers who have borne this name, none was more
celebrated and admired in his life time and none more deeply lamented
at his untimely decease than Commodore Stephen Decatur.

[Illustration: BURNING OF THE PHILADELPHIA.]

His life was a series of heroic actions. But of these perhaps the most
remarkable of all is that which is recorded in the following language of
his biographer--the burning of the frigate Philadelphia.

Decatur had been sent out from the United States, in the Argus, to join
Commodore Preble's squadron before Tripoli. He exchanged this vessel
with Lieutenant Hull for the Enterprise.

After making that exchange, he proceeded to Syracuse, where the squadron
was to rendezvous. On his arrival at that port, he was informed of the
fate of the frigate Philadelphia, which had run aground on the Barbary
coast, and fallen into the hands of the Tripolitans. The idea
immediately presented itself to his mind of attempting her recapture or
destruction. On Commodore Preble's arrival, a few days afterwards, he
proposed to him a plan for the purpose, and volunteered his services to
execute it. The wary mind of that veteran officer at first disapproved
of an enterprise so full of peril; but the risks and difficulties that
surrounded it, only stimulated the ardour of Decatur, and imparted to it
an air of adventure, fascinating to his youthful imagination.

[Illustration: COMMODORE PREBLE.]

The consent of the commodore having been obtained, Lieutenant Decatur
selected for the expedition a ketch (the Intrepid) which he had captured
a few weeks before from the enemy, and manned her with seventy
volunteers, chiefly from his own crew. He sailed from Syracuse on the 3d
of February, 1804, accompanied by the United States brig Syren,
Lieutenant Stewart, who was to aid with his boats, and to receive the
crew of the ketch, in case it should be found expedient to use her as a
fire ship.

After fifteen days of very tempestuous weather, they arrived at the
harbor of Tripoli, a little before sunset. It had been arranged between
Lieutenants Decatur and Stewart, that the ketch should enter the harbor
about ten o'clock that night, attended by the boats of the Syren. On
arriving off the harbor, the Syren, in consequence of a change of wind,
had been thrown six or eight miles without the Intrepid. The wind at
this time was fair, but fast declining, and Lieutenant Decatur
apprehended that, should he wait for the Syren's boats to come up, it
might be fatal to the enterprise, as they could not remain longer on the
coast, their provisions being nearly exhausted. For these reasons he
determined to venture into the harbor alone, which he did about eight
o'clock.

An idea may be formed of the extreme hazard of the enterprise from the
situation of the frigate. She was moored within half gunshot of the
bashaw's castle, and of the principal battery. Two of the enemy's
cruisers lay within two cables' length, on the starboard quarter, and
their gunboats within half gunshot, on the starboard bow. All the guns
of the frigate were mounted and loaded. Such were the immediate perils
that our hero ventured to encounter with a single ketch, beside the
other dangers that abound in a strongly fortified harbor.

Although from the entrance to the place where the frigate lay, was only
three miles, yet, in consequence of the lightness of the wind, they did
not get within hail of her until eleven o'clock. When they had
approached within two hundred yards, they were hailed and ordered to
anchor, or they would be fired into. Lieutenant Decatur ordered a
Maltese pilot, who was on board the ketch, to answer that they had lost
their anchors in a gale of wind on the coast, and, therefore, could not
comply with their request. By this time it had become perfectly calm,
and they were about fifty yards from the frigate. Lieutenant Decatur
ordered a small boat that was alongside of the ketch, to take a rope and
make it fast to the frigate's fore-chains. This being done, they began
to warp the ketch alongside. It was not until this moment that the enemy
suspected the character of their visitor, and great confusion
immediately ensued. This enabled our adventurers to get alongside of the
frigate, when Decatur immediately sprang aboard, followed by Mr. Charles
Morris, midshipman. These two were nearly a minute on deck, before their
companions could succeed in mounting the side. Fortunately, the Turks
had not sufficiently recovered from their surprise to take advantage of
this delay. They were crowded together on the quarterdeck, perfectly
astonished and aghast, without making any attempt to oppose the
assailing party. As soon as a sufficient number of men had gained the
deck to form a front equal to that of the enemy, they rushed in upon
them. The Turks stood the assault for a short time, and were completely
overpowered. About twenty were killed on the spot, many jumped
overboard, and the rest flew to the maindeck, whither they were pursued
and driven to the hold.

After entire possession had been gained of the ship, and every thing
prepared to set fire to her, a number of launches were seen rowing about
the harbor. This determined Lieutenant Decatur to remain on board the
frigate, from whence a better defence could be made than from on board
the ketch. The enemy had already commenced firing on them from their
batteries and castle, and from two corsairs that were lying near.
Perceiving that the launches did not attempt to approach, he ordered the
ship should be set on fire, which was done, at the same time, in
different parts. As soon as this was done, they left her; and such was
the rapidity of the flames, that it was with the utmost difficulty they
preserved the ketch. At this critical moment a most propitious breeze
sprang up, blowing directly out of the harbor, which, in a few moments,
carried them out of reach of the enemy's guns, and they made good their
retreat without the loss of a single man, and with but four wounded.

For this gallant and romantic achievement, Lieutenant Decatur was
promoted to the rank of post captain, there being at that time no
intermediate grade. This promotion was peculiarly gratifying to him,
insomuch as it was done with the consent of the officers over whose
heads he was raised.

In the ensuing spring, it being determined to make an attack upon
Tripoli, Commodore Preble obtained from the King of Naples, the loan of
six gunboats and two bombards, which he formed into two divisions, and
gave the command of one of them to Captain Decatur, the other to
Lieutenant Somers. The squadron sailed from Syracuse, consisting of the
frigate Constitution, the brig Syren, the schooners Nautilus and Vixen,
and the gunboats.

Having arrived on the coast of Barbary, they were for some days
prevented from making the attack, by adverse wind and weather. At
length on the morning of the 3d of August, the weather being favorable,
the signal was made from the commodore's ship to prepare for action, the
light vessels towing the gunboats to windward. At nine o'clock, the
signal was given for bombarding the enemy's vessels and the town.

The gunboats were cast off, and advanced in a line ahead, led on by
Captain Decatur, and covered by the frigate Constitution, and the brigs
and schooners.

The enemy's gunboats were moored along the harbor under the batteries
and within musket shot. Their sails had been taken from them, and they
were ordered to sink, rather than abandon their position. They were
aided and covered, likewise, by a brig of sixteen, and a schooner of ten
guns.

Before entering into close action, Captain Decatur went alongside each
of his boats, and ordered them to unship their bowsprits and follow him,
as it was his intention to board the enemy's boats.

Lieutenant James Decatur commanded one of the boats belonging to
Commodore Preble's division, but, being farther to windward than the
rest of his division, he joined and took orders from his brother.

When Captain Decatur, who was in the leading boat, came within range of
the fire from the batteries, a heavy fire was opened upon him from them
and the gunboats. He returned the fire, and continued advancing, until
he came in contact with the boats. At this time, Commodore Preble seeing
Decatur advancing nearer than he thought prudent, ordered the signal to
be made for a retreat, but it was found that in making out the signals
for the boats, the one for a retreat had been omitted.

The enemy's boats had about forty men each; ours an equal number,
twenty-seven of whom were Americans, and thirteen Neapolitans.

Decatur, on boarding the enemy, was instantly followed by his
countrymen, but the Neapolitans remained behind. The Turks did not
sustain the combat hand to hand, with that firmness they had obtained a
reputation for. In ten minutes the deck was cleared. Eight of them
sought refuge in the hold, and, of the rest, some fell on the deck, and
others jumped into the sea. Only three of the Americans were wounded.

As Decatur was about to proceed out with his prize, the boat which had
been commanded by his brother, came under his stern, and the men
informed him that they had engaged and captured one of the enemy; but
that her commander, after surrendering, had treacherously shot
Lieutenant James Decatur, and pushed off with the boat, and was then
making for the harbor.

The feelings of the gallant Decatur, on receiving this intelligence, may
be more easily imagined than described. Every consideration of prudence
and safety was lost in his eagerness to punish so dastardly an act, and
to revenge the death of a brother so basely murdered. He pushed within
the enemy's line with his single boat, and having succeeded in getting
alongside of the retreating foe, boarded her at the head of eleven men,
who were all the Americans he had left. The fate of this contest was
extremely doubtful for about twenty minutes. All the Americans, except
four, were now severely wounded. Decatur singled out the commander as
the peculiar object of his vengeance. The Turk was armed with an
espontoon, Decatur with a cutlass; in attempting to cut off the head of
the weapon, his sword struck on the iron, and broke off close to the
hilt. The Turk, at this moment, made a push, which slightly wounded him
in the right arm and breast. He immediately seized the spear, and closed
with him. A fierce struggle ensued, and both fell, Decatur uppermost. By
this time the Turk had drawn a dagger from his belt, and was about to
plunge it into the body of his foe, when Decatur caught his arm, and
shot him with a pistol, which he drew from his pocket. During the time
they were struggling on the deck, the crews rushed to aid their
commanders, and a most sanguinary scene took place, insomuch that when
Decatur had despatched his adversary, it was with the utmost difficulty
he could extricate himself from the killed and wounded that had fallen
around him.

It is with no common feeling of admiration that we record an instance of
heroic courage, and loyal self-devotion, on the part of a common sailor.

During the early part of Decatur's struggle with the Turk, he was
assailed in the rear by one of the enemy, who had just aimed a blow at
his head which must have proved fatal; at this fearful juncture, a
noble-hearted tar, who had been so badly wounded as to lose the use of
his hands, seeing no other means of saving his commander, rushed between
him and the uplifted sabre, and received the blow on his own head, which
fractured his skull. We love to pause and honor great actions in humble
life, because they speak well for human nature. Men of rank and station
in society, often do gallant deeds, in a manner from necessity. Their
conspicuous station obliges them to do so, or their eagerness for glory
urges them on; but an act like this we have mentioned, so desperate, yet
so disinterested, done by an obscure, unambitious individual, a poor
sailor, can spring from nothing but nobleness of soul. We are happy to
add that this generous fellow survived, and long after received a
pension from government.

Decatur succeeded in getting, with both his prizes, to the squadron, and
the next day received the highest commendation, in a general order, from
Commodore Preble. When that able officer was superseded in the command
of the squadron, he gave the Constitution to Captain Decatur, who had
some time before received his commission. From that ship he was removed
to the Congress, and returned home in her, when peace was concluded in
Tripoli.




EXPLOITS OF COMMODORE HULL.


Commodore Hull became a sailor when he was only eight years old. He
distinguished himself greatly in the naval war with France, and in the
war with Tripoli, especially at the capture of Derne, in Africa.

[Illustration: COMMODORE HULL.]

At the commencement of the war of 1812, Hull having been advanced in the
meantime to the rank of captain, was placed in command of the frigate
Constitution, in which he was destined to perform those brilliant
actions which have rendered him one of the most celebrated heroes of our
navy. His first exploit was the escape of the Constitution from a
British squadron, which is justly regarded as one of the most remarkable
recorded in naval history. The account of it contained in the official
letter of Captain Hull has all the interest of a romance. It is as
follows:


     "SIR:--In pursuance of your orders of the 3d instant, I left
     Annapolis on the 5th instant, and the capes on the 12th, of which I
     advised you by the pilot who brought the ship to sea.

     For several days after we got out, the wind was light and ahead,
     which, with a strong southerly current, prevented our making much
     way to the northward. On the 17th, at two P.M., being in twenty-two
     fathoms water off Egg Harbor, four sail of ships were discovered
     from the masthead, to the northward and in shore of us, apparently
     ships of war. The wind being very light all sail was made in chase
     of them, to ascertain whether they were the enemy's ships, or our
     squadron having got out of New York, waiting the arrival of the
     Constitution, the latter of which I had reason to believe was the
     case.

     At four in the afternoon, a ship was seen from the masthead,
     bearing about north-east, standing in for us under all sail, which
     she continued so to do until sundown, at which time she was too far
     off to distinguish signals, and the ships in shore only to be seen
     from the tops; they were standing off to the southward and
     eastward. As we could not ascertain before dark what the ship in
     the offing was, I determined to stand for her, and get near enough
     to make the night signal.

     At ten in the evening, being within six or eight miles of the
     strange sail, the private signal was made, and kept up nearly one
     hour, but finding she could not answer it, I concluded she and the
     ships in shore were enemy.

     I immediately hauled off to the southward and eastward, and made
     all sail, having determined to lie off till daylight to see what
     they were. The ship that we had been chasing hauled off after us,
     showing a light, and occasionally making signals, supposed to be
     for the ships in shore.

     On the 18th, at daylight, or a little before it was quite light,
     saw two sail under our lee, which proved to be frigates of the
     enemy's. One frigate astern within about five or six miles, and a
     line of battle ship, a frigate, a brig, and a schooner, about ten
     or twelve miles directly astern, all in chase of us, with a fine
     breeze, and coming up fast, it being nearly calm where we were.
     Soon after sunrise, the wind entirely left us, and the ship would
     not steer, but fell round off with her head towards the two ships
     under our lee. The boats were instantly hoisted out, and sent ahead
     to tow the ship's head around, and to endeavor to get her farther
     from the enemy, being then within five miles of three heavy
     frigates. The boats of the enemy were got out and sent ahead to
     tow, by which, with the light air that remained with them, they
     came up very fast. Finding the enemy gaining on us, and but little
     chance of escaping from them, I ordered two of the guns on the gun
     deck to be ran out at the cabin windows for stern guns on the gun
     deck, and hoisted one of the twenty-four pounders off the gun deck,
     and ran that, with the forecastle gun, an eighteen pounder, out at
     the ports on the quarter deck, and cleared the ship for action,
     being determined they should not get her without resistance on our
     part, notwithstanding their force and the situation we were placed
     in.

     At about seven, in the morning, the ship nearest us approaching
     within gunshot, and directly astern, I ordered one of the stern
     guns fired, to see if we could reach her, to endeavor to disable
     her masts; found the shot fell a little short, would not fire any
     more.

     [Illustration: ESCAPE OF THE CONSTITUTION.]

     At eight, four of the enemy's ships nearly within gunshot, some of
     them having six or eight boats ahead towing, with all their oars
     and sweeps out, to row them up with us, which they were fast
     doing. It now appeared that we must be taken, and that our escape
     was impossible--four heavy ships nearly within gunshot, and coming
     up fast, and not the least hope of a breeze to give us a chance of
     getting off by out sailing them.

     In this situation, finding ourselves in only twenty-four fathoms
     water, by the suggestion of that valuable officer, Lieutenant
     Morris, I determined to try and warp the ship ahead, by carrying
     out anchors and warping her up to them; three or four hundred
     fathoms of rope was instantly got up, and two anchors got ready and
     sent ahead, by which means we began to gain ahead of the enemy;
     they, however, soon saw our boats carrying out the anchors, and
     adopted the same plan, under very advantageous circumstances, as
     all the boats from the ships furthermost off were sent to tow and
     warp up those nearest to us, by which means they again came up, so
     that at nine, the ship nearest us began to fire her bow guns, which
     we instantly returned by our stern guns in the cabin and on the
     quarter deck. All the shot from the enemy fell short; but we have
     reason to believe that some of ours went on board her, as we could
     not see them strike the water. Soon after nine, a second frigate
     passed under our lee, and opened her broadside, but finding her
     shot fall short, discontinued her fire; but continued, as did all
     the rest of them, to make all possible exertion to get up with us.
     From nine to twelve, all hands were employed in warping the ship
     ahead, and in starting some of the water in the main hold to
     lighten her, which, with the help of a light air, we rather gained
     of the enemy, or, at least, held our own. About two, in the
     afternoon, all the boats from the line of battle ship and some of
     the frigates were sent to the frigate nearest us, to endeavor to
     tow her up, but a light breeze sprung up, which enabled us to hold
     way with her, notwithstanding they had eight or ten boats ahead,
     and all her sails furled to tow her to windward. The wind continued
     light until eleven at night, and the boats were kept ahead towing
     and warping to keep out of reach of the enemy, three of the
     frigates being very near us; at eleven, we got a light breeze from
     the southward, the boats came along side and were hoisted up, the
     ship having too much way to keep them ahead, the enemy still in
     chase and very near.

     On the 19th, at daylight, passed within gunshot of one of the
     frigates, but she did not fire on us, perhaps, for fear of
     becalming her, as the wind was light; soon after passing us she
     tacked, and stood after us--at this time six sail were in sight,
     under all sail after us. At nine in the morning, saw a strange
     sail, on our weather beam, supposed to be an American merchant
     ship; the instant the frigate nearest us saw her, she hoisted
     American colors, as did all the squadron, in hopes to decoy her
     down; I immediately hoisted the English colors, that she might not
     be deceived; she soon hauled her wind, and, as is to be hoped, made
     her escape. All this day the wind increased gradually, and we
     gained on the enemy, in the course of the day, six or eight miles;
     they, however, continued chasing all night under a press of sail.

     On the 20th, at daylight in the morning, only three of them could
     be seen from the masthead, the nearest of which was about twelve
     miles off, directly astern. All hands were set at work wetting the
     sails, from the royals down, with the engines and fire buckets, and
     we soon found that we left the enemy very fast. At a quarter past
     eight, the enemy finding that they were fast dropping astern, gave
     over chase, and hauled their wind to the northward, probably for
     the station off New York. At half past eight, saw a sail ahead,
     gave chase after her under all sail. At nine, saw another strange
     sail under our lee bow, we soon spoke the first sail discovered,
     and found her to be an American brig from St. Domingo, bound to
     Portland; I directed the captain how to steer to avoid the enemy,
     and made sail for the vessel to leeward; on coming up with her, she
     proved to be an American brig from St. Bartholomew's, bound to
     Philadelphia; but, on being informed of war, he bore up for
     Charleston, South Carolina. Finding the ship so far to the
     southward and eastward, and the enemy's squadron stationed off New
     York, which would make it impossible to get in there, I determined
     to make for Boston, to receive your farther orders, and I hope my
     having done so will meet your approbation. My wish to explain to
     you as clearly as possible why your orders have not been executed,
     and the length of time the enemy were in chase of us, with various
     other circumstances, have caused me to make this communication much
     longer than I could have wished, yet I cannot in justice to the
     brave officers and crew under my command, close it without
     expressing to you the confidence I have in them, and assuring you
     that their conduct while under the guns of the enemy was such as
     might have been expected from American officers and seamen. I have
     the honor to be, with very great respect, sir, your obedient humble
     servant,

     ISAAC HULL."

[Illustration: Hull's Victory]

Such is Captain Hull's modest account of this truly brilliant exploit.
Sailing on a cruise immediately after this, with the same frigate,
officers, and crew, on the 19th of August he fell in with His Britannic
Majesty's ship Guerriere, rated at thirty-eight guns, and carrying
fifty, commanded by Captain Dacres, who, sometime before, had politely
endorsed on the register of an American ship an invitation to Captain
Hull to give him a meeting of this kind.

[Illustration: DACRES DELIVERING UP HIS SWORD.]


At half past three, P.M., Captain Hull made out his antagonist to be a
frigate, and continued the chase till he was within about three miles,
when he cleared for action; the chase backed her main-topsail and waited
for him to come down. As soon as the Constitution was ready, Hull bore
down to bring the enemy to close action immediately; but, on coming
within gunshot, the Guerriere gave a broadside and filled away and wore,
giving a broadside on the other tack; but without effect, her shot
falling short. She then continued wearing and manoeuvring for about
three quarters of an hour to get a raking position,--but, finding she
could not, she bore up and ran under her topsails and jib, with the wind
on the quarter. During this time, the Constitution, not having fired a
single broadside, the impatience of the officers and men to engage was
excessive. Nothing but the most rigid discipline could have restrained
them. Hull, however, was preparing to decide the contest in a summary
method of his own. He now made sail to bring the Constitution up with
her antagonist, and at five minutes before six P.M., _being alongside
within half pistol shot_, he commenced a heavy fire from all his guns,
_double shotted with round and grape_; and so well directed, and so well
kept up was the fire, that in sixteen minutes the mizzenmast of the
Guerriere went by the board, and her mainyard in the slings, and the
hull, rigging, and sails were completely torn to pieces. The fire was
kept up for fifteen minutes longer, when the main and foremast went,
taking with them every spar except the bowsprit, and leaving the
Guerriere a complete wreck. On seeing this Hull ordered the firing to
cease, having brought his enemy in thirty minutes after he was fairly
alongside to such a condition, that a few more broadsides must have
carried her down.

The prize being so shattered that she was not worth bringing into port,
after removing the prisoners to the Constitution, she was set on fire
and blown up. In the action, the Constitution lost seven killed, and
seven wounded; the Guerriere, fifteen killed, sixty-two
wounded--including the captain and several officers, and twenty-four
missing.

The news of this victory was received in the United States with the
greatest joy and exultation. All parties united in celebrating it, and
the citizens and public authorities vied with each other in bestowing
marks of approbation upon Captain Hull and his gallant officers and
crew.

EXPLOITS OF COMMODORE BARNEY.


This gentleman was one of the old fashioned commodores, a capital
sailor, an intrepid warrior, and a thorough going patriot. He was born
in Baltimore, in 1759. He entered the marine early in life. At the age
of sixteen he served in the expedition of Commodore Hopkins to the
Bahama Islands, and continued in active service through the whole
revolutionary war.

In 1780 he was captured by a British seventy-four, when taking a prize
into port and sent with other prisoners to England. On the passage, the
prisoners--amounting to about sixty--were confined in the most loathsome
of dungeons, without light or pure air, and with a scanty supply of
provisions.

They thought when they arrived at Plymouth, that their privations were
at an end; but they were only removed to another prison-ship, which,
although dirty and crowded, was, in some measure, better than the one
they had left. From this, contrary to expectation, as soon as they were
so much recovered as to be able to walk, they were brought on shore and
confined in Mill prison, where they met the anxious faces of several
hundred American prisoners, who had undergone the same privations as
themselves.

This prison was surrounded by two strong walls, twenty feet apart, and
was guarded by numerous sentries. There were small gates in the walls,
and these were placed opposite each other, the inner one generally
remaining open. The prisoners were allowed the privilege of the yard
nearly all day, and this set the inventive mind of Barney upon the
scheme, which, in the end, terminated in his liberty; not, however,
without infinite danger and trouble. He set about finding out some small
chance which might afford the least hope of release; and having
discovered one of the sentries that had served in the United States, and
remembered the kindness with which he had been there treated, Barney and
he formed the means of escape. It was arranged that Barney should affect
to have hurt his foot and obtain a pair of crutches, and thus lull
suspicion.

On the 18th of May, 1781, he habited himself in the undress uniform of a
British officer, the whole covered with a old greatcoat, and, by the aid
of the sentinel, cleared the prison; when he threw off the coat, and
soon arrived at the house of a well known friend to the American cause,
in Plymouth. That he might not be soon missed, he got a lad, who, after
answering to his own name, was to get out, and answer to Barney's, in
the yard, which little stratagem succeeded admirably. When Barney
arrived at the friend's house, he made preparations to leave as soon as
possible, well knowing that if any of the British were detected
harboring him, they would be convicted of high treason. In the evening,
therefore, he departed to the house of his friend's father, at a
considerable distance, where he would be safer. On arriving there, he
was surprised to find two of his old friends--Americans--who had been,
for some time, anxiously waiting for an opportunity of returning home,
and now thought that the time had arrived.

Lieutenant Barney determined to sail for the French coast, and, for this
purpose, he and the two gentlemen purchased a small fishing vessel, and
habiting themselves in some fishermen's old apparel, they set sail on
their intended voyage. Admiral Digby's fleet lay at the mouth of the
river, and our adventurers had to pass through the midst of them, and
then run the chance of capture by the numerous British cruisers, which
continually ply about the channel. This was a daring undertaking, as the
fleet, he thought, had doubtless received notice of his escape, and the
enemy would be rigid in their search. He, therefore, determined to act
with coolness, and, if intercepted, to give such answers to the
questions put to him, as might best lull suspicion. If he was detected,
he would pay for the attempt with his life.

He knew that if his escape was detected, it would be immediately
communicated to the fleet, and thus lessen his chances; especially as
the least unusual appearance in his assumed character, would excite
immediate suspicion. Even should he be able to pass through the fleet,
the British channel abounded with the English cruisers, which were quite
adept in the art of picking up stragglers. With these dangers painted in
lively colors before his eyes, he preserved his usual self-possession,
and inspired with confidence his companions, who had never handled a
rope, and relied exclusively upon his daring.

By sunrise, the next morning, they were "under way," the two gentlemen
remaining below, and Lieutenant Barney and the servant being the only
ones on deck, to avoid suspicion. With a good breeze, and a favorable
tide, it was not long before they were in the midst of the hostile
fleet, which seemed to take no notice of them. Their hearts beat quick
when they were thus hanging between life and death; but as soon as the
last of the enemy was passed, they declared themselves safe through
_that_ portion of the ordeal.

But what attempt ever ended to the satisfaction of the undertaker?
Before the enemy were clear out of sight, the practised eye of Barney
caught a sail which he knew to be bearing down upon him. He saw that
resistance was out of the question; but that if he managed the affair
adroitly he _might_ escape. It was now that he was called upon to
exercise that firmness of mind, coolness and contempt of danger, and
quickness of resource in time of need, that ever distinguished his
character, and showed him to be a man of no ordinary talents. In less
than an hour the privateer--for such she was--came alongside, and sent
an officer to see "what he wanted steering for a hostile coast." The
first questions that were put, and answered unhesitatingly, were--what
he had on board? and where he was bound? Of course he had nothing on
board, and his destination was France--on business of importance from
the ministry; at the same time untying the rope that bound the old coat
around him, and displaying the British half uniform. The officer touched
his hat, begged pardon, and said he would go on board and report to the
commanding officer.

The result of the interview was that Barney was made a prisoner once
more, and ordered with a prize-master to Plymouth. But being forced by
stress of weather into a small bay, near Plymouth, he contrived to
escape from his captors, and find his way to the mansion of the
venerable clergyman, at Plymouth. Deeming it unsafe to remain there,
lest he might be discovered, after a few days he set out at midnight in
a postchaise for Exeter, and from thence by stages to Bristol, where he
had a letter of credit to an American gentleman.

Here he remained for three weeks, and from thence he went to London,
directed to a countryman, who received him kindly, and offered his
services towards effecting his final escape. After remaining here for
six weeks, he found an opportunity of sailing for France; and after an
extremely boisterous and squally passage, reached Ostend, from whence he
soon found his way to Amsterdam, where he seized the opportunity of
paying his respects to Mr. John Adams, then Minister Plenipotentiary
from the United States to Holland. Through the courtesy of this
gentleman, he obtained a passage to his own country, and, after some
adventures, reached Philadelphia, on the 21st of March, 1782.

But he was not long allowed to enjoy the pleasure which he expected,
after such a trial of danger and fatigue. In less than a week after he
arrived at Philadelphia, he was offered the command of the Hyder Ally,
of sixteen guns, fitted out by the state authorities of Pennsylvania, to
repress the enemy's privateers, with which the Delaware river abounded.

On the 8th of April, 1782, he entered upon his destined service, which
was to convoy a fleet of merchantmen to the capes, and to protect them
from the "refugee boats," with which the river abounded. While waiting
at the capes, he was assailed by two ships and a brig belong to the
enemy, who, finding him unsupported, commenced a furious attack, which
he sustained with great coolness, while his convoy were safely retiring
up the river. The brig came up first, and gave him a broadside as she
was passing; but kept her course up the bay after the convoy, while
Barney waited for the ship, which was coming up rapidly. Having
approached within pistol shot, the Hyder Ally poured a broadside into
her, which somewhat staggered the enemy, who thought Barney would
"strike his colors." The enemy seemed disposed to board, and was ranging
alongside of him, when he ordered the quarter-master, in a loud voice,
to "port the helm!"--having previously given him secret instructions to
put the helm hard a-starboard, which latter order was obeyed; by this
manoeuvre the enemy's jib-boom caught in the fore-rigging of the Hyder
Ally, thus giving her a raking position, which Captain Barney knew how
to improve. The firing on both sides was tremendous;--an idea of it may
be obtained from the fact, that more than twenty broadsides were fired
in twenty-six minutes! In the mizzen staystail of the General Monk there
were afterwards counted, three hundred and sixty-five shot-holes. During
the whole of this short but glorious battle, Captain Barney was
stationed upon the quarterdeck, exposed to the fire of the enemy's
musketry, which was excessively annoying, and began to be felt by the
men, insomuch that Captain Barney ordered a body of riflemen, whom he
had on board, to direct their fire into the enemy's top, which
immediately had the desired effect.

The capture of the General Monk was one of the most brilliant
achievements in naval history. The General Monk mounted eighteen guns,
and had one hundred and thirty-six men, and lost twenty men killed, and
thirty-three wounded. The Hyder Ally had sixteen guns, and one hundred
and ten men, and lost four men killed, and eleven wounded.

All the officers of the General Monk were wounded except one. The
captain himself was severely wounded. The brig which accompanied the
enemy ran ashore to avoid capture. Captain Barney now followed his
convoy up to Philadelphia. After a short visit to his family, he
returned to his command, where he soon captured the "Hook-'em-snivy"--a
refugee schooner, which had done a great deal of mischief on the
Delaware river.

These captures struck such terror among the privateers, that they began
to disperse to more profitable grounds. In consequence of the glorious
actions, Captain Barney was presented with a gold-hilted sword, in the
name of the state.


This little story I have translated from the French of Mademoiselle
Montgolfier. If children enjoy it as much as I have, and think it as
pretty, they will not regret that I have preferred it to any thing I
could write for them.

Mademoiselle Montgolfier says in her preface to the little book,
"Notwithstanding the fanciful character of this story, it is, in
fact, simply a little lesson in Natural History," and that "she
would engage for the truth of all that Piccolissima relates of the
manners and customs of the insects with whom she makes acquaintance."

It may also interest our young, and, perhaps, our more advanced
readers, to know, that Mademoiselle Montgolfier is the daughter of
the celebrated Montgolfier who invented balloons, and made the first
ascension. I had, when in France, the pleasure of seeing this very
interesting lady, and know her affection for children; and I am sure
that it will please her to know that her tiny naturalist is welcomed
by the American children. I therefore feel a particular pleasure in
introducing the wonderfully small Piccolissima to their
acquaintance, and recommending her to their affectionate regard.








Piccolissima was descended on the father's side from the famous Tom
Thumb, so well known to all children. On the mother's side, her
lineage was no less distinguished. Mignonette Littlepin (this was
the family name of Madam Tom Thumb) was the great granddaughter of
the wonderful Princess, who once lodged in a spectacle case, out of
which she came so splendidly attired that the brilliancy of her
little person illuminated all surrounding objects. A trustworthy
biographer tells us that nothing occurred in the history of Mr. and
Mrs. Tom Thumb to disgrace their illustrious parentage, and they
were considered none the less good citizens because they were rather
smaller than other people.

In the mean while, however, our humble couple became suddenly
celebrated by the birth of our heroine; this small creature was so
delicate, so exquisite, so pretty, and so lively and full of spirit,
that from the age of two years she became the object of general
admiration. She was not more than one inch in height, and her
mother, who had prepared the cradle and baby linen for a child of
the usual size, was puzzled to know what to do. Finally, the half of
a cocoanut shell, lined, and furnished with soft cushions of thistle
down, made a good bed for the little wonder; and the nursery maid,
wife of a neighboring clockmaker, and a person of ingenuity,
conceived the admirable idea of suspending the cocoanut cradle from
the pendulum of a great clock, in order that the infant might be
rocked all the time. Madam Tom Thumb was enchanted with the
invention. She adhered to the old-fashioned notions, and could not
suppose it possible that her little one could sleep without rocking.
What the good little mother found the most trouble from, in the
extreme smallness and delicacy of the limbs of her new-born doll
baby, was the impossibility of swathing and dressing it. So she was
forced to resign herself to doing as the birds do, and bring up her
little one on a bed of moss and down. She hardly dared to put upon
the little arm, smaller than her own little finger, a little shift
made of the fine white skin of the inside of an eggshell. The boots
of the little one had soles cut out of the inside husks of the corn;
a poppy leaf made her an ample bonnet. The spider's web which the
dew whitens, and the wind winds up in balls, seemed too coarse too
weave her sheets with, and the cup of an acorn was big enough for
Piccolissima. Her parents obtained all her wardrobe, and all the
small furniture for her use from those thousands of skilful
laborers, so adroit, and yet of whom we think so little, who hide
themselves in all the walls, in the leaves of the trees turned up
like horns, under the bark of the trees; in short, that are found in
all the corners and crevices of creation.

Mr. and Mrs. Tom Thumb were not people who could be astonished.
Simple themselves, every thing appeared simple to them. Mrs.
Mignonette was at first a little disconcerted at finding that a
drawer of baby linen which she had taken so much pains to make was
of no use, and that one of the stockings which she had knit was big
enough for her child to get into. But, when she was convinced that
the baby could do just as well without stockings, and that the
cushions of thistle down were sufficient to keep it warm, she was no
longer troubled, and she said to her neighbors, who were eager to
see her little wonder, "It is very natural that the little one
should be so very delicate; from the first we called it
Piccolissima; then, neither Mr. Tom Thumb nor I are very large; and
I am told that our ancestors were still more delicately formed; what
then is more natural than that this little one should be such a wee
wee thing?"

The tranquillity of Mrs. Tom Thumb had this good effect; it appeased
the curiosity of the neighbors. At last, like her, they came to the
conclusion "that it was very natural that the child was smaller than
the mother." and all went on as usual around our heroine, while she
was quietly rocked by the passing hours, and was amused with the
sound of the silver clock bell. When, however, Piccolissima was two
inches high, and lively as a grasshopper, she became restless in her
cocoanut shell; she was desirous to get out of it, to walk, and to
jump, and she not only deranged the clock, but she was in real
danger.

She was now as much as seven years old, and she amused herself with
all sorts of little pranks, and loving ways, with one of her
brothers eighteen months old. The great boy, in a sort of ecstasy at
some of the drolleries of his little sister, seized her and put her
in his mouth, taking into it nearly the whole head of the poor
little thing. Her cry was so shrill that the baby boy opened his
jaws and let the unfortunate Piccolissima fall on the floor. She did
not recover for a long time from this fall. Another time, a large
cat, a great mouser, ran after her, and it was with difficulty they
rescued Piccolissima from the claws of Raminagrobis. The father, Mr.
Thumb, could not repress some anxiety about the fate of his amiable
daughter, who had more than common intelligence, and who, by her
extreme smallness, was exposed to so many dangers.

Piccolissima did her best to acquire knowledge. She had the best
intentions in the world; she desired in every thing to please all
who approached her; but her extreme restlessness led her away in
spite of herself. One evening she lost herself in the solitude of a
drawer in which was kept some tobacco; she came near dying from the
effect of it. Once she was near drowning in a superb salad dish of
frothed eggs, which she may have taken for snow mountains. She had a
passion for discovery, she had a prodigious activity of mind and
body, and yet they could find nothing for her to do, "because," they
said, "she is so little, so delicate." She could not play with
children of her own age, she was not allowed to run about, and
without object, without employment, without means of studying, with
no companions, no sympathy, the poor little thing was in danger of
falling into a state of apathy, more to be feared than the accidents
from which they wished to preserve her.

One day, towards the end of February, Piccolissima had been placed
upon the mantelpiece. Her mother had gone out; her father, who did
not wish to have the trouble of watching over all his little
daughter's movements, seated her upon a pincushion in which there
were no pins, and putting the dictionary as a sort of rampart before
her, he gave her a stick of barley sugar to entertain herself with,
and after the usual admonition, left her to her dreams. Leaving the
sugar to slip down by her side, she remained lost in melancholy
reflections from which she was drawn by a light murmur, such as one
hears sometimes in the silence of the night when persons are
speaking in a low voice in a distant part of the house. Piccolissima
listened with deep attention for some time. Usually she disliked the
sound of conversation; it struck harshly on her organs, and seemed a
sort of mimic thunder; but these sounds had nothing discordant,
nothing disagreeable in them, to her ear. As Piccolissima had been
forced to observe rather than to act, her faculties took a new
direction, and a development of which she was unconscious herself
took place, and her joy and her surprise were great when she found
that, in what had at first appeared to her a confused murmur, she
distinguished, as she listened attentively, intelligible words.

"It was hardly worth while," said a small, sharp voice, "it was
hardly worth the trouble it cost me to leave my cradle. I have come
into the world where all is dead around me. Ah! if I had only known
that this world was so cold and dull, I should not have made efforts
which almost destroyed me, to break the roof and leave my narrow
house."

"Patience," replied another voice, a little quieter, but much like
the other; "I have lived longer than thou, who art only a few
seconds old. I have learned that one minute does not resemble
another; that cold is near to heat, that light is near to darkness,
and that sweet follows bitter. It is now two hundred and twenty-one
thousand, seven hundred and sixty-one minutes, and twenty-four
seconds, since I broke my shell. This sun, which you now see so pale
in the dusk, glowed then with more fervor, and sent every where more
rays and sparkles than I can count seconds in my long life. I was
all wet as you are now--poor, helpless thing; but I turned myself to
some of those brilliant rays, and my wings directly became strong,
as you now see them, embossed and painted with seven different,
changing colors, reflections of the rays of the sun. See! there is
one of these rays now; come forth; spread thy moist wing, already
shrunk and chill; thou shalt take thy part in the blessings which
come from on high."

Piccolissima, all attention and full of curiosity, looked around
her, and saw coming out from the window frame two flies, who
appeared to be talking together. The wings of one of them remained
stuck together on its back, and it made a great effort to extend
them. Delighted at the discovery of companions in her solitude,
companions, too, whose language she could understand, Piccolissima
was eager to make their acquaintance; so she offered them her stick
of candy. One of the flies--it was the elder--having fixed upon the
little prodigy one of the thousand faces of his brown, sparkling
eyes, surrounded with golden eyelashes, he then placed, one by one,
his little black feet upon the stick of sugar candy, stretched forth
his trunk, and began to suck with eagerness.

Piccolissima had now time enough to contemplate a being whose organs
she thought were like her own in their weakness. She found pleasure
in examining the extraordinary form of its almost cylindrical body,
divided into three parts, and a head wider than it was long, an
irregular globe surmounted by two horns, or antennae, as they are
called. The eyes most excited her curiosity. She attempted to count
their numerous little faces, so regular, so finely cut into
hexagons, more polished, more brilliant than diamonds. When
Piccolissima had counted one hundred, she drew from a very small
box, which was a family treasure, some minikin pins, and stuck one
of them into the cushion on which she was seated, intending thus to
mark every hundred that she counted; but she had not counted thus
half a thousand, before she found that breath and knowledge failed
her; in truth, she did not know enough of arithmetic to count the
eyes of a fly. In the very first group which she undertook to count,
that on the right side of the fly, she had not counted a sixteenth
part. Piccolissima, from her education, resembled the flies a little
too much to boast of her perseverance. So she gave up her project.

While bending her small head over these eyes, she distinguished, at
the bottom of these crystals, a moving dark spot, and thousands of
little Piccolissimas, one after the other, smiled upon her from
these little mirrors. O, wonderful! these thousands of crystal
groups on each side of the head were not all; a triangle of three
diamonds crowned the forehead of the fly. Piccolissima did not know
the name they give to these small eyes, nor that a writer on the
subject had said, that the diadem of the fly outshines that of
queens, but she could not refrain from saying aloud, "O, my little
friend, pray tell me what you do with so many eyes?"

"What do I do with them, indeed! why, I look," answered the fly, a
little vexed at being disturbed in his repast. "Are there not
fingers, nails, pins, pincers, jaws, claws, beaks, which menace me
on every side? Do I not want eyes to see at a distance, and eyes to
see near? And do you not know that my head is better put on than
yours, which cannot turn to all points of the compass?"

"What! can you look behind you without turning your head?" replied
Piccolissima, with an air which probably appeared to the fly not
very sensible; for, shrugging up his right wing disdainfully, he
returned to his sugar candy.

After a little reflection, she looked down again, and perceived, to
her great astonishment, upon the stick of candy, which was of an
amber color, a drop of water. She was sure, however, that she had
done the civil thing to the flies, and given it to them first. How,
then, was the candy moist? thought she; but she did not dare again
to ask questions which excited such a rude buzzing in reply. So she
rested her two little elbows on her knees, and her small head upon
one of her hands, and continued to examine the fly. "Is it his
nose?" said she, in a low voice, (for, having very rarely any one to
talk with, she had a habit of talking to herself,) "is it his nose
that he stretches out thus upon my sugar? I have heard papa say that
there are animals, much larger than he, and which they call
elephants, I think, who take up with their noses all the food they
put in their mouths, and that they call this nose a trunk. Perhaps
this is a little person of the family of elephants."

Piccolissima had hardly uttered these words, when the fly, whose
antennae were longer than usual, and were turned towards the little
prattler, gave such a leap that Mademoiselle Tom Thumb trembled. The
wings of the insect fluttered, and made a little sharp noise, which,
however, had nothing terrible in it, and Piccolissima perceived that
her companion was laughing. It was evident that the fly must laugh
with his wings, because he could not laugh in any other way. It was
with his antennae that he had listened; they evidently served him as
ears; and, when he recovered his gravity, he flew on the little
girl's hand, and began to talk with her; then Piccolissima observed
him more intelligently.

"It appears to me, little pet," said the fly, "thou must be very
green to compare my delicate trunk, this instrument so nicely made,
with the enormous and coarse cylinder upon which, in hot weather, I
have often travelled. How can any one suppose that I have any
relationship to the deformed and gigantic monster of which you have
just now spoken?"

Piccolissima thought that the little person was not wanting in
vanity, and, while the fly was taking breath, observed that the
trunk had disappeared, and that there was no possibility of
discovering what the insect had done with it. The look, gloomy, and
a little sullen, of the fly, recalled somewhat the funny mask of a
harlequin, and Piccolissima was on the point of showing how one
laughs with the lips, by laughing in the fly's face, when the latter
forced air slightly through the breathing holes which open under the
wings; the two little double scales, the winglets, which unfold at
birth, began to vibrate; and Piccolissima, who just now remarked
that this was the method that her new acquaintance took to emit
sounds, was eager to listen to what he might say; so she made an
effort to command herself, and became serious.

"Do you not see, with your dull human intelligence, that my trunk is
a pump, a hollow tube, an instrument for sucking which I stretch out
and draw in at my pleasure?"

While speaking thus, the fly thrust half way out from the cavity in
the middle of his head, just under his eyes, a trunk with two or
three joints in it; at the end was an opening like two black lips,
folded over, with grooves or little hollows. The fly, thus urged to
show the use of his trunk, or, more probably, forgetting the sequel
of a discourse upon which he had entered in such a pompous style,
flew upon the sugar, and set himself again to sucking it.

Piccolissima again observed the little drops fall which she had
noticed before. It seems that the fly, being only able to take up
liquids through his trunk, wetted and dissolved the sugar that he
might suck it up. It was a pleasant thing to see his lips swell out,
and press, handle, and knead, as it were, the amber surface of the
sugar in order to make it melt sooner, and enable him to draw it up
faster. After having examined all these proceedings for some time,
with great amusement, the little apprentice naturalist cried out,
"Well, my little guest has a remarkable talent for eating barley
sugar."

The other fly, timid, wet, and with his wings folded, so that he
seemed naked, remained behind upon the frame of the window. "Come,
poor little wet chicken as thou art," cried the elder fly; "thou
wast complaining just now of having found in life only discomfort
and cold; dost thou not see these rays of the sun? dost thou not
perceive the perfume of this delicious food?" The young,
inexperienced fly was disposed to take Piccolissima, the dictionary,
and the barley sugar for a chain of mountains. However, when the
little girl turned her gentle, child-like face towards him, the
insect felt the pleasant warmth of her breath; it reanimated him,
and gave him courage, and with one bound he flew upon the arm of
Piccolissima. With a sudden familiarity he murmured in a low voice,
"Art thou, perhaps, an elder sister of mine? Thou warmest me. Art
thou placed in the sun to strengthen thy wings? Relate to me,
quickly, thy metamorphosis whilst I dry myself. Let us see, hast
thou been a caterpillar, a worm? How many feet didst thou once have?
I will lay a wager thou didst not have any. For me, I had three rows
of feet, forty-two in all, at least. Come, then, speak, and tell me;
answer my question."

Usually Piccolissima did not require to be urged to speak; but these
questions were of such an extraordinary nature, so unexpected, that
the little girl remained silent. "Whether I have been a caterpillar
or a worm? A queer question at the commencement of an acquaintance."

In the mean time the questioner was silent. Occupied with the
comfort of exposing all his little person to the sun, he extended
his wings, which, intersected with nerves, became every moment more
substantial, without losing any of their delicacy. This transparent
network, divided like stained glass windows, by dark lines,
resembled isinglass, sometimes decomposing the sun's rays, and
showing the colors of the rainbow.

The head of the insect, as it dried, became shiny like satin; the
eyes, of a reddish brown, glowed in a circle of silver. Over a
little jet band, on the top of his head, three little soft eyes
peeped out like those which the young observer had already noticed
in the other fly. The brown trunk of this one seemed more delicate;
his bronze corselet, reflecting like emerald, was garnished with
fine hairs, like the down which the fresh morning spreads over
beautiful fruits. The belly of the insect, which showed itself
between and through the transparent wings, was of a beautiful
shining black set off by six white crescents, symmetrically placed
on the right and left. The legs appeared to Piccolissima brown, and
very delicate. As she examined them, she remembered that the young
boaster had vaunted itself of having forty-two of them; and she was
upon the point of venturing to inquire what had become of the
superfluous ones, when the lively fly, finding itself dry and
strengthened, raised two of its legs and examined them very closely,
and crossing them with great dexterity rubbed the soles of his feet
one against the other. Piccolissima was tempted so to call the two
balls of flesh covered with hair, and armed with two nails which
terminated the foot bones. The fly, having cleaned his brushes or
sponges,--for they were as much like one as the other,--employing
his trunk very skilfully, began to rub them over and under his
wings, and over his little face, his eyes, and his antennae. He
combed, brushed, sponged, and cleaned himself all over. Hardly had
he finished one side before he began upon the other, using those of
his six feet which were the most convenient. At last, he seemed
weary of being watched by Piccolissima; and, shaking himself, he
just grazed the eyelids of the little girl with his wings, and all
of a sudden flew away, and alighted on the window pane, where he
marched backward and forward with his head now up, and now down,
quite indifferent to the laws of gravity.

Piccolissima followed him with her eyes with less surprise than
curiosity; not being able to contain herself any longer, she
determined to speak to the old fly.

"How does your companion contrive to walk with his head down in that
way?"

The old fly, satiated with sugar, turned half round to the right,
and with one spring placed himself opposite the little girl, and
stared at her with such a stupefied look, that Piccolissima,
although her good sense refused to believe it, thought for a moment
that the ten or twelve thousand eyes were all fixed on her,
forgetting, in her confusion at being thus stared at, that though
each eye had thousands of faces to mirror all surrounding objects,
still there was behind them all only one power of seeing, only one
fly.

"What matters it, in the name of all that is sweet in the world? Of
what consequence is it, when one walks, whether the head is on one
side or the other, up or down? Poor infirm creature that thou art,"
said the fly; "dost thou see any difference?"

Piccolissima, somewhat mortified at having always walked with her
head upward, remained stupefied and silent. It seems necessary,
thought she, that every surface, in whatever direction it is placed,
should have the same power to attract and support the feet of the
flies as the ground and the floor to retain mine.

Ignorant as she was, the little girl had not yet heard of the gummy
liquid which the wise ones had at one time supposed to be placed in
the sponges of the flies, nor of the vacuum, by means of which the
learned of the present day suppose these little cushions can adhere
to the most polished surfaces; and she had not yet seen flies enough
to form any opinion for herself.

"I see," said the little girl, in a small flute voice, "that you
know much more than I; do not refuse, then, to instruct me. I cannot
explain how it is you speak and breathe. Since you have kept your
trunk in its case, I perceive above it your lips closed, and I do
not see them move." Piccolissima, fearing she might be laughed at,
did not dare to add, that she had supposed that the voice of the fly
came from under his wings.

"I speak as all well-formed people speak," answered the haughty
insect, "with four voices;" and four puffs of air issued from the
oval breathing holes on both sides of his breast, giving a tremulous
motion to his two little egg-shell wings, his two balance wings, and
the roots of his two other wings. "I breathe through these openings
of my corselet, and I have, in order to enable me to take in the
inspiring air which was created to bear me up, as many mouths as
rings to my corselet."

He then swelled out with a proud air his brown abdomen, which seemed
formed of rings of shell; and while he was indulging in the
admiration of himself and his powers, the sharp eyes of Piccolissima
discovered that these circles were not, as we should say, soldered
together, but were lying on a flexible membrane, or thin skin, which
held them in their place, and which was folded up or extended at the
will of the insect. On either side, between each ring, there was in
this membrane a little oval hole, smaller than those which, near the
cavities of the corselet, emitted and modulated the buzzing sound
which Piccolissima had just heard; these openings enabled the insect
to breathe.

"You have many ways of speaking," the little girl said at last, with
a sigh; "but covered as you are all over with brilliant armor, how
can you touch any thing?"

The fly, who was at this moment digesting his dinner, and who did
not like any interruption in any of his affairs, put forth his trunk
without making any reply, shook a little the small beard that grew
upon it, did the same with his antennae, rounded at the ends like
little cushions, and furnished with feathery hair; then stretched
forth his legs, as if yawning. Piccolissima comprehended that the
two little cushions which ornamented the extreme end of the foot of
the fly, in which she counted five joints, might easily possess the
sense of touch, and that this also rendered them more useful for
motion, and for the toilet; it was like so many intelligent brushes,
all ready to perceive and sweep away the least grain of dust. The
little beards she also thought might have the power of taste, like
the antennae, at the same time that they listened to sounds.

"This young fly is doubtless your son," said Piccolissima to the
insect which had taken his place on her neck, in order that the
warmth might help digestion, without asking whether or not his nails
might tickle the little girl.

"What! hast thou not seen directly that we were not relations? but I
see how it is; I pity you, poor imperfect being with only two eyes
and one mouth, and no trunk," answered the fly. "It is natural that
thou hast only a superficial knowledge. This little upstart who
devours the sugar as if he did not mean to leave any of it for any
one else, this little person, who has but a few minutes ago escaped
from his shell, yet hanging to a dead rose leaf long since forgotten
as it lay there on the window, has not, as I have, four beautiful
black streaks on his corselet. The white spots on his back offend
the eye; I prefer the modest color of my brown rings, and the soft
shade of the color of the faded leaf on a portion of my wings does
not contribute less to the majesty of my aspect than the colored
feathers which ornament my antennae. As for me, I am the domestic
fly."

"I was wrong not to have remarked the differences which strike me
now," said the child; "but what does this young scapegrace mean by
what he says of metamorphoses, and countless legs?"

"Yes, yes; that is well known; his race lives upon hairy prey; in my
opinion there is nothing to boast of in that. Although thou knowest,
it seems to me, very few things, still I think thou art not
ignorant, of course, that parents place their offspring where it is
best. The mother of this fly of the rose bush laid her egg in the
midst of the flock which was to nourish her little one. This one
came into the world in the shape of a worm."

"Why dost thou shudder?" grumbled angrily the fly. "This form is as
good as any other; call this worm larva if it suits thy fancy; he
has still to each of his fourteen rings three little feet; but he
has not such elegant members as mine, a haunch, a thigh, a leg, and
an instep with five joints." While speaking, the old fly displayed
pompously one of his legs, which he began immediately to caress with
the edge of his lips, because he saw a grain of dust on one of the
small hairs.

"But," perseveringly asked Piccolissima, who wished to hear the
history of the fly to the end, "who are these little flocks in the
midst of which your friend has passed his early days?"

"They are the little red or green grubs which infest the rose bush;
these he pierces and grinds up with his teeth, and sucks them up
with his strange mouth one after another as he moves slowly among
them upon those forty-two roots of feet, of which he is so vain, for
I maintain that they cannot be called legs, or any thing like legs."

"You, then," said the little girl, "have better formed members."

The fly, who remembered that he had not at all better limbs, looked
suddenly wearied with the conversation, and shaking his wings, flew
away to the window.

"Of what color were you formerly?" asked the little girl of her only
remaining companion; "you, who are now of such a pretty shade of
brilliant green and bronze?"

"Me! I was of a pretty tender green. Weary of living on the ground,
I took the resolution to retire from the world. I shut myself up in
my skin, which soon became hard enough to serve for my retreat. My
house was carried, I know not how, to that spot not far from you; I
know not what artificial heat acted on me. I came to the belief that
the time had come for me to spread my wings, and I uncovered the
roof of my house in order that I might know what had been done
during my absence. They call me the rose fly."

As he finished saying these words, the fly, quite satisfied, joined
his companion in the window. Piccolissima was grieved that she could
not follow them; she listened attentively to the noise they made in
flying, and could distinguish musical tones. But, fatigued at last
by this long tension of her mind, gradually her ideas became vague
and wandering, her little blond head fell upon her arms, and she
dropped asleep and dreamed.

She dreamed that her two new friends, the flies, returned,
accompanied by an innumerable troop of winged insects. Each one
carried something, one a blade of grass, another a stalk of a plant,
another a petal, another a pistil. Two large beetles, with immense
horns or talons, dragged along small branches loaded with flowers,
such as Piccolissima had never seen.

All this troop set themselves to work and constructed the most
charming, the lightest little aerial car that one can possibly
imagine. A great fly, bristling with fine hairs, extended four
strong wings, and raising his voice, invited Piccolissima to mount,
and at the same time politely offered her his paw.

The little girl accepted the invitation, and found herself
immediately transported into the corolla of a beautiful white lily.
There she found a throne prepared for her. Very skilful little paws
lightly tickled her arms, and then her feet, in order to call her
attention to the labors of invisible waiting maids, who were about
dressing her in a robe of white velvet, cut out of the petals of a
white camellia, confined round the waist by a turquoise clasp,
borrowed from the myosotis.

A stamen of the lily served her for a sceptre; she took her seat; a
rose leaf hung for a canopy over her head; the bells of the lily of
the valley and the campanula sent forth their joyous chime. The
bladder senna filled the air with the noise of its bursting petards.
The artillery of the prickly furze played on both sides of the
throne as the nations of flies approached to pay their homage to the
queen.

To the cries of vivat, uttered with enthusiasm, Piccolissima replied
by inclining her sceptre; a golden rain fell from it, and was
eagerly gathered up by the surrounding crowds of humming courtiers,
whose shouts and acclamations filled the air.

The young sovereign then had to endure a long and grave discourse
from a fat drone bee who did not understand himself.

Ere long the little queen learned that her empire was in danger.
Dreadful enemies menaced the frontiers. "They are spiders," said the
flies. "They are the larvae of the rose bushes," said the grubs.
"They are the ichneumons," cried a crowd of winged insects.

Every one accused some other one. Piccolissima did not know what to
understand, but she hastened to arm herself. Two bees, as her body
guard, placed upon her head for helmet a flower of the snapdragon.
Two wasps, redoubtable hussars, brought her for a shield a piece of
the gold bronze wing shell of a beetle.

At last, she extended her hand to seize her lance, when a clap of
thunder shook the lily, dispersed the court, and the army, and
Piccolissima awoke, and found herself in the hands of her mother,
Mrs. Thomas Thumb, who said, very gently, "Tell me, dear little one,
are you not very weary?"

"It is strange," said Mr. Tom Thumb, some months after, "that I
always find now my ball of soap in its right place."

"It is because Piccolissima no longer rolls it into the corners for a
plaything," replied Mrs. Tom Thumb. "The little creature improves--grows
really intelligent."

"I am glad of it," said, a little while afterwards, one of the elder
sisters of the miniature woman; "I am no longer obliged to hunt from
place to place for my thimble and my scissors they are now always in
my work box."

"The reason is, Piccolissima does not now make a well of your
thimble, nor a spade of your scissors," answered her brother; "she
has become tiresome; she no longer frisks around me when I return
home; she has no longer any droll fancies which once amused me so
much; she is now a genuine doll; I really believe that this minikin
is putting on airs."

"Hold your peace, Monsieur," answered the busy chambermaid, in a
scolding tone, while she cleaned the runnels of a chair, upon which the
feet of the young man had left a good portion of the soil of the garden;
"I should like to see the day when you are as well behaved as
Mademoiselle Piccolissima. It was once Mademoiselle Touch-every-thing.
Six months ago, no one dared to leave a drawer in the house open; now
every thing remains quiet in its place; she is neither more nor less
than a reasonable being; she is a waxen image, I tell you."

"Did I say any thing else, Madam Scold?" answered the school boy;
"she is a real Liliputian statue, fit for nothing but to watch the
flies fly. Ah! come, Piccola, Piccolissima!" he cried to the little
one, who was behind the shutter of a half-open window, absorbed in
the contemplation of a gnat who was up the window, singing a little
air through his nasal trumpet, "tell us, Piccola, a little of what
the flies say to you."

Piccolissima, who was always alarmed at a big voice, trembling,
turned round and stared at her brother, who, shouting with laughter,
made a pirouette, jumped over the balcony, which was near the
ground, into the garden.

The complaints of Piccolissima's brother were not quite without
foundation; she had become more reflecting, more observing; she was
less restless and less communicative; more amused, but less amusing.
She did not dare to repeat to her sisters her conversation with the
flies, lest they should laugh at her, and she became more frequently
occupied with her own thoughts, and more silent. Her silver voice
was heard no longer in every corner of the house; she was no longer
under every one's feet; the fragments of her dress were no longer
caught by the nails in her brothers' shoes, under the legs of her
sisters' chairs, or under the castors of the furniture; and her
mother, who had a habit of saying, "This little wild thing gives me
more trouble than all her brothers and sisters," said now, "Truly,
if she does not help me, she does not hinder me." As for Mr. Tom
Thumb, who loved to complete a remark by a proverb, instead of
exclaiming, "It is not strange that she does not grow,--a rolling
stone gathers no moss," murmured, rubbing his hands, "Whoever lives
will see what I have always said: It is only weeds that grow fast."

In order to employ the activity of Piccolissima, her father had at
one time given her some pots of flowers; for a long time, nothing
came of them, for she turned over the earth incessantly, and kept
looking at the roots to see if they began to sprout. Now that she no
longer asked ten questions, one after the other, without waiting for
an answer, and that she left her plants to grow, and no longer took
them up to look at their roots, she had in her garden, just under
the window, one foot of potatoes, three feet of hemp, a bean, and a
strawberry plant, in pots. Her brother, in jumping out of the
window, had broken off some ripe strawberries, which the little girl
had cherished for her mother, and Piccolissima went sorrowfully to
examine the havoc, and pick up the fruit.

She no longer supported herself upon the flexible stalks of the
nasturtiums and the convolvulus, which Mr. Tom Thumb cultivated, and
who more than once had complained at finding them broken. She no
longer seated herself on the branches of the mignonette, and then
let the wind blow her at its will, backwards and forwards, a
dangerous and monotonous amusement, which soon wearied. Now, with
her elbow resting on the edge of the pot of strawberries, under the
shadow of the Persian lilac, she remained in contemplation.

She observed running about some little creatures that she had never
seen before, and which appeared to her so wild that she dared not
begin a conversation.

"O, what is that?" she said at last, stooping down and resting her
head on her hand, and forgetting her lost harvest of strawberries;
"here is something very curious. They are smaller than the flies. A
myosotis could accommodate a number of them in its delicate cup;
their heads are wider than they are long, and on each side I
perceive a sort of fine leg, which has a sort of elbow, and which
the insect does not use in walking; the body is in three parts, all
of a shining black; the head has these two threads, which are always
moving, and which are of a lighter color at the ends; the corselet
is smaller, rounder, and more brilliant than that of the flies; and
the belly is covered with black scales. But these little beasts trot
away, scamper away so fast with their nimble legs, that one cannot
see them. What delicate forms they have! they must have worn corsets
when they were young. Ah! there is a sort of knot in this thread
which fastens the corselet to the belly. Wait, little fellow, wait
while I look at you a little nearer!" The small, thin finger of
Piccolissima caught one of the little creatures, but she found some
difficulty in holding him.

"Ah! at last I have you!" She held between her thumb and finger the
two hind legs of the insect, who stretched himself out stiff and
without motion, just as if he was sitting for his portrait. She then
saw above the arms and hands of the head, (thus she chose to call
the antennae,) two shining eyes, like two black buttons--naturalists
discover three with a microscope. "He has no trunk," said
Piccolissima, as she looked at a formidable mouth. At this moment,
the insect disengaged one of his legs, and twisting himself with
fury, and biting the finger which held him, he showed two jaws,
which worked like a pair of pincers. Piccolissima was not
sufficiently hardened to natural history. She shook her hand
violently, and uttered a cry that brought her brother to her in a
moment.

"Ha! ha! the great body," cried he, as he saw the trouble, and the
cause of it; "this is not a worthy enemy; it is only one of the
smallest ants. What would you say if you had to contend with the
herculean wood borer? Your ferocious animal is only a modest
fuliginosa, Madam Piccola; it is Formica fuliginosa, Latin words,
which mean soot-colored ant."

"I should much prefer that they should be called at once by a name
that I could comprehend, 'little blackeys,' instead of these long
words, that it almost takes away your breath to pronounce."

"This is because you are ignorant, sister; but for that, you would
love the Latin names, because they are so fine sounding, and can
express so many things. For example, formica; can you guess? O,
no, you will never guess," added he, with a knowing tone. "Very
well! formica means crumb carriers, because the little cunning
beasts carry all sorts of knickknacks."

Piccolissima, who once had only frisked and frolicked around her
brother, and in whose eyes she had been hitherto a sort of amusing
plaything, listened to him now with an air of intelligence and
satisfaction, with which he was secretly flattered. "Besides the
herculean borer," he continued, "there is another ant in the
forests, much larger than your enemy, and who builds mountains. They
call him rusa, which means russet. It is he who produces the formic
acid, a poison which he sheds with his abdomen into the bite which
he makes with his mandibles or jaws, which makes the wound a little
red, and makes it itch and burn a little." He was going on to add
that mandibula signified jaw bone; abdomen, meant belly. He might,
perhaps, while he was in this mood, have declined all these nouns,
but his little sister had ceased to listen; she was following with
her eye a file of her small black ants, and she saw them go and come
very busily upon a small stick which supported her only bean stalk.
Doubtless the wind had blown into Piccolissima's garden one of the
white cottony tufts which enfold the seeds of the poplar, for it was
a young shoot of poplar which served as support to the plant, and as
a garden for the ants. Upon the white cottony stem was an assemblage
of these little animals, green, brown, yellow, and transparent, all
plump, singularly alike, grave, immovable, like a Roman senate.
Certain active little creatures with fine shapes walked among them,
around them, over them, without appearing to hurt them, or
disturbing their gravity. The ants carried their easy manners still
farther; they struck lightly, rapidly, alternately, with their two
antennae, the backs and the sides of these peaceable animals; they
even went so far as to turn them over with their fore paws, and all
the while the other insects did not move, and allowed them to do as
they pleased.

"Look! look!" cried Piccolissima.

"Beautiful little wonder," answered her brother, "these are grubs,
that's all; and who does not know nowadays, that these are the cows
of the ants?"

"Their cows!" repeated the little girl; and she remained absorbed in
her examination. The ants still continued, in a playful and
irregular manner, to strike their little cows, whose trunks
Piccolissima saw were thrust into the bark of the aspen. Sometimes
an ant gave a little kick, and always one was at hand, with his jaws
extended, and his mouth open, ready to receive a drop of sirup,
which the eye of Piccolissima at last discovered falling from the
extremity of the body of the grub. "I see, I see!" she exclaimed;
"it is their way of milking. O the funny little pastoral people!"
Whilst she was in this ecstasy, the ant with the ends of his
antennae took the transparent little drop into his mouth; and then
carefully cleansed with the brushes of his feet the sugared antennae
which had served for fork and spoon, or rather for fingers.

"I should like to talk with him," said Piccolissima, as she saw the
ant making his toilet, "but these are a very silent, a very reserved
people; perhaps they are dumb."

The ant, who had just swallowed the drop of sirup, now quietly
descended the aspen walk; his belly was well stuffed and shining,
and he stopped now and then to rest, and wash his face. He met, as
he went down, an ant who was ascending the path. The new comer ran
up to him as to an intimate friend, as soon as he saw him, and
eagerly struck him with his antennae. The motion was very rapid; the
ant returned it by shaking his antennae, but more gently, and by
opening his mandibles. "Are they going to dispute, and to bite each
other?" thought Piccolissima. Not at all. The ant who had received
the sirup upon the end of his tongue, now offered a little drop of
it to the one who was hungry, who received it upon his tongue, while
he continued to caress with his antennae, and even with his little
paws, the friend who offered it. The joy of Piccolissima was so
great at the sight of this mutual kindness, that she made one of her
old leaps, and shook the frail stalk. Immediately there was a
violent commotion among the ants, who in great crowds blackened the
end of the twig. They ran hither and thither in the greatest terror,
striking their antennae one against the other. Many of them caressed
the grubs more eagerly, in a violent and impetuous manner, as if to
urge them to some exertion. Some of the grubs submitted to be taken
gently into the jaws of the ants; others, with their trunks in the
wood, looked as if they were too lazy to consent to move.

They were however, at last, (whether they would or not,) all carried
rapidly away. Each ant, loaded with her cow, ran down the tree, and,
following a little narrow path in the ground, reached a small, deep
hole, into which the ants, one after the other, all disappeared.

"O Mimi! O Linette! O Fifine!" cried Piccolissima, running from her
brother to her sisters, "they have carried away all their cows. Each
ant has his cow between his teeth; one holds her by the belly, the
others by the wings; come see! come see!"

"Cows with wings!" cried the astonished little girls. Mimi, who knew
all this, startled his little sister by saying, "The pet is right;
she has good eyes; there are many grubs with wings; come, come, my
small sister, it appears to me that you are discovering many things
already known. My ladies, the ants, ought to choose you for their
queen."

The same day, Madam Tom Thumb, who began to feel some confidence in
the reason of Piccolissima, carried her into the garden, to the
great joy of the little creature. It was a delicious place; there
were in it long covered alleys, and even a small wood, where one
might enjoy a sweet freshness in the heat of the day. Around a great
hall, covered with foliage, were seats of soft green moss. It was
there that Madam Tom Thumb used to embroider with her elder
daughters; and there she placed Piccolissima, allowing her to run at
large, only recommending to her prudence and discretion.

The child, who was formerly idle and weary of every thing, was in a
fair way to become a happy young girl, thanks to the attention she
began to give to every thing she saw, and to the interest which the
wonders around her excited in her mind. She was enchanted with the
thousand plants which embellished and covered the earth, and formed
in the smallest flower an object of admiration which filled her
soul. Very soon she met one of those beings who excited in her a
lively curiosity,--an ant much larger than the little black ones of
the shepherd race. The fine antennae, the three eyes, the top of the
head, the legs, the belly of this one were blackish, but less
glistening, and it was by the superiority of his shape, above middle
size, and above all, by the reddish color of a part of his body,
that Piccolissima recognized the russet ant of which her brother had
spoken. The insect carried very laboriously a stick ten or twelve
times as long as himself; a hillock of earth, which he met on his
road, stopped him for some time, and Piccolissima, who was eager to
help him through his difficulties, and who was tormented with a
desire to enter into conversation with him, took it into her head to
assist the insect, and hoped thus to render herself agreeable to
him. She seized one end of the little rafter he was carrying, and in
a tone which she tried to make as soft as possible, she said, "Will
you allow me, little one, to help you?"

The ant, clinging to the earth with his hind legs, stood up
straight, and threw out his antennae with a terrible expression.
Piccolissima was so full of kind feeling that she never thought of
exciting any anger; she thought that it was only a little struggle
of his politeness; therefore she insisted, taking firmly hold of the
bit of wood, and repeated, "I assure you it is a pleasure to me, and
it will not fatigue me." Forced to loosen his burden, the ant opened
his jaws full of formidable teeth, and advanced upon Piccolissima,
walking on his hind legs; the two others stretched out in front, as
well as his antennae, in sign of defiance; his body all bent,
exhaling an odor of vinegar so pungent that Piccolissima, letting go
the little stick, ran away as fast as she could, sneezing violently,
and shutting her eyes. When she opened them and returned, thinking
the ant was at her heels, she found her terrible adversary had again
seized his big stick by one end, and had slid it over the lump of
earth by means of a stone, which served him as a point of support.
She saw him sometimes push it before him, and sometimes drag it
after him, walking backwards till he reached the flat ground, when
he pursued his way very fast.

Piccolissima, who did not forget that her mother had recommended
discretion to her, followed at a distance. As she went on carefully,
she saw long trains of ants resembling her enemy; each one of them
was charged with a burden more or less heavy. All of them took their
way towards a mountain shaped like a cone, full of little openings
which, from a distance, appeared to be semicircular vaults; Roman
architecture Piccolissima would have thought if the multiplicity of
details of little architectural ornaments, all of wood work, had not
given her the idea of an old Gothic fortress. The rapid and violent
motions of the wild mountaineers did not frighten her; she walked up
slowly, hardly touching her feet to the earth, holding her breath,
observing every thing, and she was soon convinced that this little,
busy people took no notice of her. She came nearer and nearer to the
place where two great roads, covered with ants, terminated. She
heard a confused noise, like the hum of a great city, or as the
sound of the rain among the leaves.

"I thought they spoke only by signs which they make with the arms
that come out of their heads," said Piccolissima, still going
nearer; "why, then, this noise?"

The little girl was soon convinced that this noise was produced by
the numerous and busy footsteps of a solemn, austere, and
preoccupied crowd of ants. Not a word was said, but every one ran
rather than walked, and they seemed like a thousand individuals, all
actuated by one purpose. Supported on the lower branch of a chestnut
tree, Piccolissima placed herself a little higher, but very near the
citadel, which was one living mountain.

How can we relate what she saw then? It would take volumes. There
would be as many histories as individuals. Her attention was
attracted by the perseverance of one ant who carried a burden; by
another who was striving to get over some obstacle. She saw them
feed those who arrived laden and out of breath; she saw those who
repaired the doors, who opened and shut the windows, which were not
glazed like ours; others she saw as sentinels, standing on their
hind legs, charged to watch over the general safety. The busiest
carried in their mandibles, caressed with their legs and their
antennae, licked with their delicate tongues, exposed to the sun, or
carried quickly into the shade certain white balls which
Piccolissima took at first for grains of wheat, because they had the
form and size; but she was satisfied at last that these were the
children of the ants in swaddling clothes. Piccolissima was so
anxious to comprehend the mysterious talk, and the pantomime of all
this innumerable crowd, that she became yet more attentive. The
nurses caressed with their antennae in a peculiar way those eggs
which were beginning to show life, and the little observer saw the
slight movement of the incomplete being who, as soon as he was
bidden, raised his head, which was almost imperceptible even to
microscopic eyes, to receive the offered mouthful.

Whilst Piccolissima observed all this nursery work, an ant came and
placed beneath her, in order to fill up a small hole, a sort of
bundle of little sticks, which rolled away as soon as she left it.
The ant took hold of it again, carried it to its place, and arranged
it so as to make it firm; then, satisfied with her work, she went
after something else to do. Shortly after this, a head, then some
legs, then half of the body of a caterpillar came out of the living
little fagot which the ant had mended her house with. It was a dead
leaf in which an egg had been laid and nicely rolled up by the
parent, and which my lady ant had taken for a beam, or something of
the sort, and the vexed hermit scampered away, carrying his house
with him, not caring at all for the hole which he and his house had
been intending to mend.

Much amused at this, Piccolissima tried to find out what a great
number of ants, all with burdens, were carrying. She was, with
painful astonishment, soon convinced that these were the carcasses
of all sorts of insects. "It is a nation of hunters," she said,
"more savage than those which feed their flocks on my aspen."

At this moment, a great ant attracted the attention of the child
towards the lower part of the mountain. An enormous grub of the
cockchafer race, a great white worm, rolled himself over, trying to
liberate himself and to crush the ants, whose number increased on
every side, and who tore off his transparent, soft skin, and pulled
him in every direction. They climbed backward up the side of their
citadel, and in spite of his desperate struggles, carried the poor
insect, writhing with torture, to one of their little air holes.
Piccolissima saw upon his wounds some drops of the sharp poison
thrown by these terrible hunters, and the crowds of ants soon hid
the sufferer from her eyes, which she gladly turned away from such a
sight.

With her heart oppressed with fear and pity, the little girl
collected her strength that she might glide down from her branch and
run away, when a sudden alarm attracted a whole squadron of the
insects to the place where she was about to put her foot. She
immediately regained her place, and tried to understand what
important and terrible news was being communicated from antennae to
antennae, drawing together such a number of insects, with their
frightful jaws all opened. The penetrating odor reached the
frightened little girl; presently she perceived a very large ant,
nearly six lines in length, very black, very shining, doubtless a
Hercules who was defending himself against a whole army. His enemies
fastened themselves on to each of his legs, but he still fought; a
brown ant jumped upon his back and tried to break his brilliant
cuirass; another, with his body bent double, covered him with
poison. The Hercules still fought. At last, three of the fiercest of
the ants worked with their sharp teeth upon the middle of his body,
and at last cut him in two. The terrible head of the Hercules still
held in his jaws two of his deadly enemies. Piccolissima screamed,
and putting her hand before her eyes, she perhaps would have fallen
into the midst of this nation of savages, if her mother, who was
anxious about her, had not taken her in her arms and carried her
away.

From this time, Piccolissima became one of the happiest little
creatures in the world. Her brother, instead of considering her only
as a toy to play with, began to respect her. She had no more
conversations with the flies, to be sure. Her mind grew, and she
learned that, small as she was, she was superior to the best
informed fly. She studied the habits and doings of the ants, and
learned a great deal about their different tribes and nations.
Sometimes her brother would take his sister's toilet cushion and put
it on the table before him, and seating Piccolissima upon it, say to
her, "Now, Piccola, dear, listen with both of your little ears to my
big words, and I will read some wonderful stories to you." Once he
read Gulliver's Travels to her. "O!" she exclaimed, as he read of
the Lilliputians, "O, good! good! I am a Lilliputian, and you are
all great, big Brobdignagians. Why did you not tell me this before?"
So she began to dance and skip about, like a jack-o'-lantern. Her
brother, who was delighted at her gambols, whistled a tune for her
to dance by. Presently Piccolissima began to sing, with her small,
fine voice, this song, which she made as she danced:--

     Merrily, merrily, dance away!
     Merrily laugh, and merrily play!
     Though I am a tiny thing,
     I can dance, and I can sing;
     I can hear, and I can see;
     I don't care who laughs at me;
     I can learn all things to know;
     So sing merrily, merrily, O!

The morning was lovely; the blue shadows, extending over the fields,
made the leaves of the chestnut trees, wet with the morning dew,
still more brilliant. Agitated by a light breeze, they glistened in
the rays of the rising sun. Every blade of grass lifted its dewy
head as soon as a ray fell upon it, and each in its turn was crowned
with its halo of diamonds.

The flowers, in sweet accord, sent up their perfume towards heaven.
Already the lark had saluted the day with his brilliant song,
eternal hymn, ever repeated, never omitted. Every little bird sent
up his clear note and his joyous song from his nest; the insects
were beginning to hum. The sound of the voice of man, slow to join
in the morning prayer of the whole creation, was not yet heard when
Piccolissima, already awake, entered the garden.

She had obtained permission to do so the evening before. Her
mother's confidence had increased with the growing prudence and good
sense of the little girl; qualities which a habit of observation has
the effect of strengthening rapidly.

The child was desirous to witness the morning labors of the ants,
and to see how, when the dew had prepared their mortar, they built
their long galleries. They commenced their work at the top, and
Piccolissima would have liked to see them again raise and make their
walls. She was, however, disappointed in her purpose, either that
the earth dried too quick, as the sun was now high above the
horizon; or the tiny republicans, with six feet, were employed in
their interior halls, in bringing out the young ants, and were busy
tearing off the veils of silk which confined the larvae, and in
developing the wings of the males and females; or, whatever might be
the cause, the ant hills were deserted.

The lazy amazons did not appear. Now and then a single miner might
be seen wandering alone at the entrance of their subterranean
dwelling.

Seated upon a piece of turf near the parterre, the little girl
followed with her eye, all along the stem of a plant, two or three
brown ants who led their flock of grubs to pasture, when a murmuring
sound near her, which seemed to spread all over the beds of
mignonette, attracted her attention to some large flies, of a dull
color, who whirled about among the flowers, darting from one to the
other, and seemed very busy.

"Can these be any of my old acquaintances?" said she; but she could
not be satisfied with this idea; the new comers, much larger, had
also a very different physiognomy from that of her old friends. They
had oval eyes, with a network over them; a protruding jaw; antennae
of twelve olive scales, terminated by a button. Their brown
corselets covered with a tawny fur; their brilliant cuirasses, and
their legs of unequal length,--all these things attracted the
attention of the young observer.

She saw these flies rolling themselves over in the bosom of the
flowers, with a joyous activity which amused her very much, and the
reason of which she desired to understand.

There was, however, in their appearance and manners, something
repulsive which prevented familiarity. Each one of them caused to
vibrate four gauze wings, two large and two small ones. In their
rapid and measured motions, these wings produced sound, and the air,
issuing from little breathing places situated, as in the common fly,
on each side of the corselet, produced a sort of a song.

As if attracted by the song, these insects flew in swarms to the
flower-bed. Very soon it was evident that they were heavier when
they went away than when they came. Two large, round, red and
yellow, or rather golden balls loaded their brilliant brown thighs.
Some of them plunged into the bosom of a lily. Raising herself on
tiptoe, Piccolissima kept them in view. She saw their slanting
teeth, which formed the point of their triangular head, open and
close like two strong pincers, and shake the tops of the stamens.
She had never noticed before, but now she perceived, at the end of
the six threads in the centre of the flower, a sort of little green
box; this was the anther. These flies pressed it and pulled it, till
it opened and scattered a quantity of little yellow pellets, which
covered the insects so thoroughly, that they and the flowers seemed
to have changed garments, so completely were they clothed with it.

Piccolissima could contain herself no longer. She cried out to her
sister, whom she saw coming towards her:

"O, come, come quickly! See the flies putting on their ball dresses,
and making their toilet in the cup of a flower."

Linette, still at a distance, did not hasten her steps,
notwithstanding the exclamations of her sister; and before she came,
Piccolissima was convinced that the flies did not think much of
their brilliant toilet. She saw them push off all their finery by
means of the brushes with which their legs were furnished. These
excellent little square brushes were placed on their hind legs
mostly; they had brown horn backs, and short, stiff hairs, ranged
regularly. These brushes did their work so well, that in less than a
moment every fly had resumed his modest livery.

But what had become of the rich yellow powder? The insect had taken
care to brush himself so rapidly that Piccolissima could but just
see the dust he had collected pass from one part of his body to
another, till the whole came to the third pair of his legs, and was
collected together in a little oval cavity, surrounded by a thick
circle of skin which closed in upon it. Every fly used his middle
legs afterward to press and roll up into his basket his little
store.

"Hast thou forgotten how to walk faster than a snail?" said
Piccolissima to her sister. "These great flies were just now dressed
with a cloak of gold, and now they carry their toilet in a bundle;
look at the third joint of their largest legs, which they join
together and let hang behind them when they fly."

"Nonsense! I know all about them," said Linette, as she saw them fly
away with their burden; "these are bees who make honey, such as I
have brought you for your breakfast;" and the young girl put into
her sister's hand a double slice of bread and honey.

Without noticing her breakfast, Piccolissima eagerly tasted of what
remained of the yellow dust of the stamens of the lily.

"But, Linette," said she, "this does not taste like honey."

"Very true; it is for the bees to entitle it to that name, and not
for me. All that I know is, that they call them honey bees because
they make honey. They also make wax; and I have often seen them
carry away little balls of the dust of flowers. Whether they make it
afterwards into honey or wax, is their business. You have only to
ask them."

Piccolissima meant to do this as soon as she had courage. Meanwhile,
she rubbed in her fingers the dust of the lily, yellowed the end of
her nose in smelling of it, her lips in tasting of it, still without
finding in it the consistency of wax, or the taste of honey.

"How do the flies do it?" said she. "I have tasted at the bottom of
the tube of a honeysuckle, or of a jasmine, something more like
honey than this powder." While speaking, she was going to her bread
and honey, when she perceived some one had got the start of her. A
number of bees were on the edge of it, and were so busily employed
that Piccolissima had an opportunity of examining them closely
without fear of disturbing them. It was a pleasure to see them. From
under their chins protruded, as far as their teeth, a little case
of shell, opening with two little leaves, whence projected a second
little case, polished and shining, half open, from which was thrust
a transparent tongue, covered with hairs. This tongue was stretched
out and plunged into the honey, and was then moved round and round
and soaked in it; soon it was contracted, and now again it became
larger; the insect seemed to enjoy all these various movements.
Through the hairs and the opening pores, Piccolissima saw the liquid
ascend; and between the teeth of the bee, above its admirable trunk,
she saw a pretty large mouth open to receive the honey.

The little observer was willing to give up all her breakfast to the
little winged gormand for the sake of the satisfaction she received
from seeing how he managed to eat.

"Do not let all your honey be swallowed by those greedy flies," said
Linette, who was the economist of the family.

"O, it is only just that they should have part, if they have made
it," said Piccolissima, still watching them. "These are larger than
those other bees who carry away the golden powder. Are they not
satisfied? How their antennae come down! Does it not seem as if they
were tasting thus the perfume of the honey which their wonderful
trunks draw up?"

"They are just the same flies; they belong to our neighbor Thomas;
one is not larger than another. I have seen them ever since I was
born. I don't see any thing wonderful in them," said Linette. "It is
because you are so little that you are astonished at every thing."

"O Linette, it is true that every thing I see seems to me every day
more curious. All that I look at seems to grow more wonderful and
beautiful as I look at it; but surely these flies that are eating my
breakfast are larger than those that are opening the boxes of
sweetmeats in the flowers. Ah, look! there is one still bigger than
the others, so funny, so hairy, so cross, and he scolds and hums all
around this sweet pea."

"That is a drone; we must chase him away; he is good for nothing; he
never makes any honey." And Linette drove away the shaggy drone bee.

Just at this moment, the greedy flies who were eating the honey, and
their more temperate companions who were gathering the harvest of
the pollen of the flowers, all flew away at once, as if by common
consent.

"Ah, you have driven them all away!" said Piccolissima; and without
perceiving that the sky had clouded over, she followed the insects
with her eyes. Presently there began to fall some large drops of
rain.

"It rains, it rains! there is a shower coming," cried Linette.

"Can it be that these cunning bees have foreseen it?" asked
Piccolissima.

"What there is no question of is," said Linette, "that my poor frock
will be spoiled. It is going to rain pitchforks. There will be water
enough to drown you before we reach the house, and your mites of
shoes will be lost; but come along. There, do you think the leaf of
that cabbage will do for a shelter for you?"

"Sorores, sorores!" said a thundering voice; and in a moment Mimi
was between his two sisters, whom he sheltered under a large
umbrella; taking up Piccolissima and hiding her little feet in his
waistcoat pocket, and asking as he went towards the house, what had
kept her out so long.

"I know what you have seen," said he, with the air of a professor.
"Insects of the order hymenopteres; if you ever learn Greek,
Piccolissima, you will know that that means insects with membranous
wings. Imagine what a fine thing it is to understand Greek. Every
word contains in itself many others. For example, honey bees have a
name still longer than the others; they are called mellificae. What
do you say to that? They also call them anthophilai, which means
lovers of flowers."

"Your new friends, in particular the domestic bees, were among the
Egyptians the emblem of royalty. Are you not pleased with that,
Piccolissima? The ancient kings of France had them on their arms;
bees were embroidered on their shields, and on their standards; and
it was very proper that they adopted them. Have they not the royal
prerogative--honey and a sting? They amass treasures, and they know
how to keep them. In truth I agree with you, sisterkin; I love bees
and honey; finish your bread and honey or I shall eat it."

From this day Piccolissima dreamed ever of bees; her most earnest
desire was to go and see a kingdom of apis mellifica, which her
brother Mimi told her was in the possession of their neighbor
Thomas, who kept twenty bee hives.
