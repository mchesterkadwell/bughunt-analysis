INSECT ARCHITECTURE. 


 

It can never be too strongly impressed upon a mind 
anxious for the acquisition of knowledge, that the 
commonest things by which we are surrounded are 
deserving of minute and careful attention. The 
most profound investigations of Philosophy are 
necessarily connected with the ordinary circum- 
stances of our being, and of the world in which 
our every-day life is spent. With regard to our own 
existence, the pulsation of the heart, the act of respi- 
ration, the voluntary movement of our limbs, the 
condition of sleep, are among the most ordinary 
operations of our nature ; and yet how long were the 
wisest of men struggling with dark and bewildering 
speculations before they could offer anything like a 
satisfactory solution of these phenomena, and how 
far are we still from an accurate and complete know- 
ledge of them ! The science of Meteorology, which 
attempts to explain to us the philosophy of matters 
constantly before our eyes, as dew, mist, and rain, 
is dependent for its illustrations upon a know- 
ledge of the most complicated facts, such as the 
influence of heat and electricity upon the air ; and 
that knowledge is at present so imperfect, that even 
these common occurrences of the weather, which 









men have been observing 1 and reasoning upon for 
ages, are by no means satisfactorily explained, or 
reduced to the precision that every science should 
aspire to. Yet, however difficult it may be entirely 
to comprehend the phenomena we daily witness, 
every thing in nature is full of instruction. Thus-' 
the humblest flower of the field, although, to one 
whose curiosity has not been excited, and whose un- 
derstanding has, therefore, remained uninformed, it 
may appear worthless and contemptible, is valuable 
to the botanist, not only with regard to its place in 
the arrangement of this portion of the Creator’s 
works, but as it leads his mind forward to the con- 
sideration of those beautiful provisions for the sup- 
port of vegetable life, which it is the part of the phy- 
siologist to study and to admire. 

This train of reasoning is peculiarly applicable to 
the economy of insects. They constitute a very large 
and interesting part of the animal kingdom. They are 
everywhere about us. The spider weaves his curious 
web in our houses ; the caterpillar constructs his silken 
cell in our gardens ; the wasp that hovers over our 
food has a nest not far removed from us, which she 
has assisted to build with the nicest art ; the beetle 
that crawls across our path is also an ingenious and 
laborious mechanic, and has some curious instincts to 
exhibit to those who will feel an interest in watching 
his movements ; and the moth that eats into our 
clothes has something to plead for our pity, for he 
came, like us, naked into the world, and he has de- 
stroyed our garments, not in malice or wantonness, 
but that he may clothe himself with the same wool 
which we have stripped from the sheep. An obser- 
vation of the habits of these little creatures is full of 
valuable lessons, which the abundance of the examples 
has no tendency to diminish. The more such observa- 
tions are multiplied, the more are we led forward to the 







freshest and the most delightful parts of knowledge ; 
the more do we learn to estimate rightly the extraor- 
dinary provisions and most abundant resources of a 
creative Providence ; and the better do we appreciate 
our own relations with all the infinite varieties of 
Nature, and our dependence, in common with the 
ephemeron that flutters its little hour in the summer 
sun, upon that Being in whose scheme of existence 
the humblest as well as the highest creature has its 
destined purposes. “ If you speak of a stone,” says 
St. Basil, one of the Fathers of the Church, “if you 
speak of a fly, a gnat, or a bee, your conversation 
will be a sort of demonstration of His power whose 
hand formed them ; for the wisdom of the workman 
is commonly perceived in that which is of little size. 
He who has stretched out the heavens, and dug up 
the bottom of the sea, is also He who has pierced a 
passage through the sting of the bee for the ejection 
of its poison.” 

If it be granted that making discoveries is one of 
the most satisfactory of human pleasures, then we may 
without hesitation affirm, that the study of insects is 
one of the most delightful branches of natural his- 
tory, for it affords peculiar facilities for its pur- 
suit. These facilities are found in the almost inex- 
haustible variety which insects present to the entomolo- 
gical observer. As a proof of the extraordinary num- 
ber of insects within a limited field of observation, Mr. 
Stephens informs us, that in the short space of forty 
days, between the middle of June and the beginning 
of August, he found, in the vicinity of Ripley, speci- 
mens of above two thousand four hundred species 
of insects, exclusive of caterpillars and grubs, — a 
number amounting to nearly a fourth of the insects 
ascertained to be indigenous. He further tells us, 
that among these specimens, although the ground 
had, in former seasons, been frequently explored, 





there were about one hundred species altogether new, 
and not before in any collection which he had in- 
spected, including several new genera ; while many 
insects reputed scarce were in considerable plenty*. 
The localities of insects are, to a certain extent, con- 
stantly changing ; and thus the study of them has, 
in this circumstance, as well as in their manifold 
abundance, a source of perpetual variety. Insects, 
also, which are plentiful one year, frequently become 
scarce, or disappear altogether, the next — a fact 
strikingly illustrated by the uncommon abundance, 
in 1826 and 1827, of the seven-spot lady-bird (Coc- 
cinella septempunctata ), in the vicinity of London, 
though during the two succeeding summers this 
insect was comparatively scarce, while the small two- 
spot lady-bird ( Coccinella bipunctata ) was plen- 
tiful. 

There is, perhaps, no situation in which the lover 
of nature and the observer of animal life may not 
find opportunities for increasing his store of facts. It 
is told of a state prisoner under a cruel and rigorous 
despotism, that when he was excluded from all com- 
merce with mankind, and was shut out from books, 
he took an interest and found consolation in the visits 
of a spider ; and there is no improbability in the 
story. The operations of that persecuted creature 
are among the most extraordinary exhibitions of me- 
chanical ingenuity ; and a daily watching of the 
workings of its instinct would beget admiration in 
a rightly constituted mind. The poor prisoner had 
abundant leisure for the speculations in which the 
spider’s web would enchain his understanding. We 
have all of us, at one period or other of our lives, been 
struck with some singular evidence of contrivance in 
the economy of insects, which we have seen with our 

* Stephens’s Illustrations, vol. i., p. 72, note. 






own eyes. Want of leisure, and probably want of 
knowledge, have prevented us from following up the 
curiosity which for a moment was excited. And yet 
some such accident has made men Naturalists, in the 
highest meaning of the term. Bonnet, evidently 
speaking of himself, says, “ I knew a Naturalist, 
who, when he was seventeen years of age, having 
heard of the operations of the ant-lion, began by 
doubting them. He had no rest till he had examined 
into them ; and he verified them, he admired them, 
he discovered new facts, and soon became the disciple 
and the friend of the Pliny of France*” (Reaumur.) 
It is not the happy fortune of many to be able to de- 
vote themselves exclusively to the study of nature, 
unquestionably the most fascinating of human em- 
ployments ; but almost every one may acquire suffi- 
cient knowledge to be able to derive a high grati- 
fication from beholding the more common operations 
of animal life. His materials for contemplation are 
always before him. Some weeks ago we made an 
excursion to West Wood, near Shooter’s Hill, ex- 
pressly for the purpose of observing the insects we 
might meet with in the wood ; but we had not got far 
among the bushes, when heavy rain came on. We 
immediately sought shelter among the boughs of 
some thick underwood, composed of oak, birch, and 
aspen ; but we could not meet with a single insect, 
not even a gnat or a fly, sheltered under the leaves. 
Upon looking more narrowly, however, into the 
bushes which protected us, we soon found a variety 
of interesting objects of study. The oak abounded 
in galls, several of them quite new to us ; while the 
leaves of the birch and the aspen exhibited the cu- 
rious serpentine paths of the minute mining cater- 
pillars. When we had exhausted the narrow field of 

* Contemplation de la Nature, part ii. ch. 42. 





observation immediately around us, we found that 
we could considerably extend it, by breaking a few of 
the taller branches near us, and then examining their 
leaves at leisure. In this manner two hours glided 
quickly and pleasantly away, by which time the rain 
had nearly ceased ; and though we had been dis- 
appointed in our wish to ramble through the wood, 
we did not return without adding a few interesting 
facts to our previous knowledge of insect economy *. 

It will appear then, from the preceding observations, 
that cabinets and collections, though undoubtedly of 
the highest use, are by no means indispensable, as 
the observer of nature may find inexhaustible sub- 
jects of study in every garden and in every hedge. 
Nature has been profuse enough in affording us 
materials for observation, when we are prepared to 
look about us with that keenness of inquiry, which 
curiosity, the first step in the pursuit of knowledge, 
will unquestionably give. Nor shall we be dis- 
appointed in the gratification which is thus with- 
in our reach. Were it no more indeed than a source 
of agreeable amusement, the study of insects comes 
strongly recommended to the notice of the well-edu- 
cated. The pleasures of childhood are generally 
snpposed to be more exquisite, and to contain less 
alloy, than those of riper years ; and if so, it must 
be because then every thing appears new and dressed 
in fresh beauties: while in manhood, and old age, 
whatever has frequently recurred begins to wear the 
tarnish of decay. The study of nature atfords us a 
succession of “ ever new delights,’* such as charmed 
us in childhood, when everything had the attractions 
of novelty and beauty; and thus the mind of the 
naturalist may have its own fresh and vigorous

by the initials J. R., are by J. Rennie, A.M., A.L.S., Lee, Kent. 







thoughts, even while the infirmities of age weigh 
down the body. 

It has been objected to the study of insects, as 
well as to that of Natural History in general, 
that it tends to withdraw the mind from subjects 
of higher moment ; that it cramps and narrows 
the range of thought ; and that it destroys, or 
at least weakens, the finer creations of the fancy. 
Now, we should allow this objection in its fullest 
extent, and even be disposed to carry it further 
than is usually done, if the collecting of specimens 
only, or, as the French expressively call them, chips 
(echantillons), be called a study. But the mere col- 
lector is not, and cannot be, justly considered as a 
naturalist ; and, taking the term naturalist in its en- 
larged sense, we can adduce some distinguished in- 
stances in opposition to the objection. Rousseau, for 
example, was passionately fond of the Linnaean botany, 
even to the driest minutiae of its technicalities ; and 
yet it does not appear to have cramped his mind, or 
impoverished his imagination. If Rousseau, how- 
ever, be objected to as an eccentric being, from 
whose pursuits no fair inference can be drawn, we 
give the illustrious example of Charles James Fox, 
and may add the names of our distinguished poets. 
Goldsmith, Thomson, Gray, and Darwin, who were 
all enthusiastic naturalists. We wish particularly to 
insist upon the example of Gray, because he was 
very partial to the study of insects. It may be new 
to many of our readers, who are familiar with the 
Elegy in a Country Church-yard, to be told that 
its author was at the pains to turn the characteris- 
tics of the Linnaean orders of insects into Latin 
hexameters, the manuscript of which is still preserved 
in his interleaved copy of the “ Systema Naturae.” 
Further, to use the somewhat exaggerated words 
of Kirby and Spence, whose work on Entomology 
is one of the most instructive and pleasing books on 







the science, “ Aristotle among the Greeks, and Pliny 
the Elder among the Romans, may be denominated 
the fathers of Natural History, as well as the greatest 
philosophers of their day ; yet both these made 
insects a principal object of their attention : and in 
more recent times, if we look abroad, what names 
greater than those of Redi, Malpighi, Vallisnieri, 
Swammerdam, Leeuwenhoek, Reaumur, Linnaeus, 
De Geer, Bonnet, and the Hubers ? and at home, 
what philosophers have done more honour to their 
country and to human nature than Ray, Willoughby, 
Lister, and Derham ? Yet all these made the study 
of insects one of their most favourite pursuits*.” 

And yet this study has been considered, by 
those who have superficially examined the subject, 
as belonging to a small order of minds ; and the 
satire of Pope has been indiscriminately applied 
to all collectors, while, in truth, it only touches 
those who mistake the means of knowledge for 
the end : — 

“ O ! would the sons of men once think their eyes 
And reason given them but to study Flies ! 

See Nature in some partial, narrow shape, 

And let the Author of the whole escape; 

Learn but to trifle ; or, who most observe, 

To wonder at their Maker, not to servef.” 

Thus exclaims the Goddess of Dulness, sweeping 
into her net all those who study nature in detail. 
But if the matter were rightly appreciated, it would 
be evident that no part of the works of the Creator 
can be without the deepest interest to an inquiring 
mind ; and that a portion of creation, which exhibits 
such extraordinary manifestations of design as is 
shewn by insects, must have attractions for the very 
highest understanding. 

An accurate knowledge of the properties of insects 

* Introduction to Entomology, vol. i. 
f Dunciad, book iv. 






is of great importance to man, merely with relation to 
his own comfort and security. The injuries which they 
inflict upon us are extensive and complicated ; and the 
remedies which we attempt, by the destruction of 
those creatures, both insects, birds, and quadrupeds, 
who keep the ravagers in check, are generally ag- 
gravations of the evil, because they are directed by 
an ignorance of the economy of nature. The little 
knowledge which we have of the modes by which 
insects may be impeded in their destruction of much 
that is valuable to us, has probably proceeded from 
our contempt of their individual insignificance. The 
security of property has ceased to be endangered by 
quadrupeds of prey, and yet our gardens are ravaged 
by aphides and caterpillars. It is somewhat startling 
to affirm that the condition of the human race is 
seriously injured by these petty annoyances ; but it 
is perfectly true that the art and industry of man have 
not yet been able to overcome the collective force, 
the individual perseverance, and the complicated 
machinery of destruction which insects employ. A 
small ant, according to a most careful and philo- 
sophical observer, opposes almost invincible obstacles 
to the progress of civilization in many parts of the 
equinoctial zone. These animals devour paper and 
parchment ; they destroy every book and manu- 
script. Many provinces of Spanish America can- 
not, in consequence, shew a written document of a 
hundred years’ existence. “ What developement,” he 
adds, “ can the civilization of a people assume, if 
therej be nothing to connect the present with the 
past — if the depositories of human knowledge must 
be constantly renewed — if the monuments of genius 
and wisdom cannot be transmitted to posterity*?” 
Again, there are beetles which deposit their larvae 



* Humboldt, Voyage, lib, vii., ch. 20, 







in trees, in such formidable numbers, that whole 
forests perish, beyond the power of remedy. The 
pines of the Hartz have thus been destroyed to an 
enormous extent; and in North America, at one 
place in South Carolina, at least ninety trees in 
every hundred, upon a tract of two thousand acres, 
were swept away by a small, black, winged bug. And 
yet, according to Wilson, the historian of American 
birds, the people of the United States were in the habit 
of destroying the red-headed woodpecker, the great 
enemy of these insects, because he occasionally spoilt 
an apple*. The same delightful writer, and true natu- 
ralist, speaking of the labours of the ivory-billed wood- 
pecker, says, “ would it be believed that the larvae of 
an insect, or fly, no larger than a grain of rice, should 
silently, and in one season, destroy some thousand 
acres of pine trees, many of them from two to three 
feet in diameter, and a hundred and fifty feet high ? 
In some places the whole woods, as far as you can 
see around you, are dead, stripped of the bark, their 
wintry-looking arms and bare trunks bleaching in 
the sun, and tumbling in ruins before every blast f.” 
The subterraneous larva of a species of beetle ( Zabrus 
gibbus ) has often caused a complete failure of the 
seed-corn, as in the district of Halle in 1812 The 
corn-weevil, which extracts the flour from grain, 
leaving the husk behind, will destroy the contents of 
the largest storehouses in a very short period. The 
wire-worm, and the turnip-fly, are dreaded by every 
farmer. The ravages of the locust are too well known 
not to be at once recollected, as an example of the 
formidable collective power of the insect race. The 
white ants of tropical countries sweep away whole 
villages, with as much certainty as a fire or an inun-

elation ; and ships even have been destroyed by these 
indefatigable republics. Our own docks and em- 
bankments have been threatened by such minute 
ravagers. 

The enormous injuries which insects cause to man 
may thus be held as one reason for ceasing to consider 
the study of them as an insignificant pursuit 5 for 
a knowledge of their structure, their food, their 
enemies, and their general habits, may lead, as it 
often has led, to the means of guarding against their 
injuries. At the same time we derive from them 
both direct and indirect benefits. The honey of the bee, 
the dye of the cochineal, and the web of the silk worm, 
the advantages of which are obvious, may well be 
balanced against the destructive propensities of in- 
sects which are offensive to man. But a philosophi- 
cal study of natural history will teach us, that the 
direct benefits which insects confer upon us are even 
less important than their general uses in maintaining 
the economy of the world. The mischiefs which 
result to us from the rapid increase and the activity 
of insects, are merely results of the very principle by 
which they confer upon us numberless indirect ad- 
vantages. Forests are swept away by minute flies ; 
but the same agencies relieve us from that extreme 
abundance of vegetable matter, which would render 
the earth uninhabitable, were this excess not periodi- 
cally destroyed. In hot countries, the great business 
of removing corrupt animal matter, which the vulture 
and the hyaena imperfectly perform, is effected with 
certainty and speed by the myriads of insects that 
spring from the eggs deposited in every carcass, by 
some fly seeking therein the means of life for her 
progeny. Destruction ahd reproduction, the great 
laws of Nature, are carried on very greatly through 
tlie instrumentality of insects ; and the same princi- 







pie regulates even the increase of particular species 
of insects themselves. When aphides are so abun- 
dant that we know not how to escape their ravages, 
flocks of lady-birds instantly cover our fields and 
gardens to destroy them. Such considerations as 
these are thrown out to shew that the subject of 
insects has a great philosophical importance — and 
what portion of the works of Nature has not? 
The habits of all God’s creatures, whether they are 
noxious, or harmless, or beneficial, are worthy 
objects of our study. If they affect ourselves, in 
our health or our possessions, whether for good or 
for evil, an additional impulse is naturally given to 
our desire to attain a knowledge of their properties. 
Such studies form one of the most interesting occu- 
pations which can engage a rational and inquisitive- 
mind; and, perhaps, none of the employments of 
human life are more dignified than the investigation 
and survey of the workings and the ways of Nature 
in the minutest of her productions. 

The exercise of that habit of observation which 
can alone make a naturalist — “ an out-of-door natu- 
ralist,” as Daines Barrington called himself — is well 
calculated to strengthen even the most practical and 
merely useful powers of the mind. One of the most 
valuable mental acquirements is the power of discri- 
minating among things which differ in many minute 
points, but whose general similarity of appearance 
usually deceives the common observer into a belief of 
their identity. Entomology, in this point of view, is a 
study peculiarly adapted for youth. According to our 
experience, it is exceedingly difficult for persons 
arrived at manhood to acquire this power of discri- 
mination ; but in early life, a little care on the part of 
the parent or teacher will render it comparatively easy. 
In this study the knowledge of things should go 
along with that of words. “ If names perish,” says 







Linnaeus, “ the knowledge of things perishes also*;” 
and without names, how can any one communicate 
to another the knowledge he has acquired relative to 
any particular fact, either of physiology, habit, utility, 
or locality? On the other hand, mere catalogue 
learning is as much to be rejected as the loose 
generalizations of the despisers of classification and 
nomenclature. To name a plant, or an insect, or a 
bird, or a quadruped rightly, is one step towards an 
accurate knowledge of it ; but it is not the knowledge 
itself. It is the means, and not the end, in natural 
history, as in every other science. 

If the bias of opening curiosity be properly di- 
rected, there is not any branch of natural history so 
fascinating to youth as the study of insects. It is, 
indeed, a common practice in many families, to 
teach children, from the earliest infancy, to treat the 
greater number of insects as if they were venomous 
and dangerous, and, of course, meriting to be de- 
stroyed, or, at least, avoided with horror. Associa- 
tions are by this means linked with the very ap- 
pearance of insects, which become gradually more 
inveterate with advancing years ; provided, as most 
frequently happens, the same system be persisted in, 
of avoiding or destroying almost every insect which 
is unlucky enough to attract observation. How much 
rational amusement and innocent pleasure is thus 
thoughtlessly lost ; and how many disagreeable feel- 
ings are thus created, in the most absurd manner! 
“ In order to shew,” says a writer in the Magazine 
of Natural History, “ that the study, or (if the word 
be disliked) the observation of insects is peculiarly 
fascinating to children, even in their early infancy, 
we may refer to what we have seen in the family of a 
friend, who is partial to this, as well as to all the 

* Nomina si pereant ; peril et coguitio rerum. 





departments of natural history. Our friend’s children, 
a boy and a girl, were taught, from the moment they 
could distinguish insects, to treat them as objects of 
interest and curiosity, and not to be afraid even of 
those which wore the most repulsive appearance. 
The little girl, for example, when just beginning to 
walk alone, encountered one day a large staphylinus 
( Goerius oleins? Stephens ; vulgo, the devil’s coach- 
horse), which she fearlessly seized, and did not quit 
her hold, though the insect grasped one of her fingers 
in his formidable jaws. The mother, who was by, 
knew enough of the insect to be rather alarmed for 
the consequences, though she prudently concealed 
her feelings from the child. She did well ; for the 
insect was not strong enough to break the skin, and 
the child took no notice of its attempts to bite her 
finger. A whole series of disagreeable associations 
with this formidable-looking family of insects was 
thus averted, at the very moment when a different 
mode of acting on the part of the mother would have 
produced the contrary effect. For more than two 
years after this occurrence, the little girl and her 
brother assisted in adding numerous specimens to 
their father’s collection, without the parents ever 
having had cause, from any accident, to repent of 
their employing themselves in this manner. The 
sequel of the little girl’s history strikingly illustrates 
the position for which we contend. The child hap- 
pened to be sent to a relative in the country, where 
she was not long in having carefully instilled into 
her mind all the usual antipathies against ‘ every- 
thing that creepeth on the earth and though she 
afterwards returned to her paternal home, no persua- 
sion nor remonstrance could ever again persuade her 
to touch a common beetle, much less a staphylinus, 
with its tail turned up in a threatening attitude, and its 
formidable jaws ready extended lor attack or defence.” 







We do not wish that children should be encouraged 
to expose themselves to danger, in their encounters 
with insects. They should be taught to avoid those 
few which are really noxious — to admire all — to 
injure none. 

The various beauty of insects — their glittering 
colours, their graceful forms — supplies an inexhaus- 
tible source of attraction. Even the most formidable 
insects, both in appearance and reality, — the dragon- 
fly, which is perfectly harmless to man, and the wasp, 
whose sting every human being almost instinctively 
shuns, — are splendid in their appearance, and are 
painted with all the brilliancy of natural hues. It 
has been remarked, that the plumage of tropical 
birds is not superior in vivid colouring to what may 
be observed in the greater number of butterflies and 
moths *. “ See ! ” exclaims Linnaeus, “ the large, 

elegant painted wings of the butterfly, four in num- 
ber, covered with delicate feathery scales! With these 
it sustains itself in the air a whole day, rivalling the 
flight of birds and the brilliancy of the peacock. 
Consider this insect through the wonderful progress 
of its life, — how different is the first period of its 
being from the second, and both from the parent 
insect ! Its changes are an inexplicable enigma to 
us : we see a green caterpillar, furnished with sixteen 
feet, feeding upon the leaves of a plant ; this is 
changed into a chrysalis, smooth, of golden lustre, 
hanging suspended to a fixed point, without feet, and 
subsisting without food ; this insect again undergoes 
another transformation, acquires wings, and six feet, 
and becomes a gay butterfly, sporting in the air, and 
living by suction upon the honey of plants. What 
has Nature produced more worthy of our admiration 
than such an animal coming upon the stage of the

world, and playing its part there under so many dif- 
ferent masks ? ” The ancients were so struck with 
the transformations of the butterfly, and its revival 
from a seeming temporary death, as to have consi- 
dered it an emblem of the soul, the Greek word 
signifying both the soul and a butterfly ; and 
it is for this reason that we find the butterfly intro- 
duced into their allegorical sculptures as an emblem 
of immortality. Trifling, therefore, and perhaps con- 
temptible, as to the unthinking may seem the study 
of a butterfly, yet when we consider the art and me- 
chanism displayed in so minute a structure, — the 
fluids circulating in vessels so small as almost to 
escape the sight — the beauty of the wings and 
covering — and the manner in which each part is 
adapted for its peculiar functions, — we cannot but 
be struck with wonder and admiration, and allow, 
with Paley, that “ the production of beauty was as 
much in the Creator’s mind in painting a butterfly 
as in giving symmetry to the human form.” 

A collection of insects is to the true naturalist what 
a collection of medals is to the accurate student of 
history. The mere collector, who looks only to the 
shining wings of the one, or the green rust of the 
other, derives little knowledge from his pursuit. But 
the cabinet of the entomologist becomes rich in the 
most interesting subjects of contemplation, when 
he regards it in the genuine spirit of scientific 
inquiry. What, for instance, can be so delightful 
as to examine the wonderful variety of structure in 
this portion of the creation ; and, above all, to trace 
the beautiful gradations by which one species runs 
into another. Their differences are so minute, that an 
unpractised eye would proclaim their identity ; and 
yet, when the species are separated, and not very 
distantly, they become visible even to the common 
observer. It is in examinations such as these that 







the naturalist finds a delight of the highest order. 
While it is thus one of the legitimate objects of his 
study to attend to minute ditferences of structure, 
form, and colouring, he is not less interested in the in- 
vestigation of habits and economy ; and in this respect 
the insect world is inexhaustibly rich. We find herein 
examples of instinct to parallel those of all the larger 
animals, whether they are solitary or social ; and 
innumerable others besides, altogether unlike those 
manifested in the superior departments of animated 
nature. These instincts have various directions, and 
are developed in a more or less striking manner to 
our senses, according to the force of the motive by 
which they are governed. Some of their instincts 
have for their object the preservation of insects from 
external attack ; some have reference to procuring' 
food, and involve many remarkable stratagems ; 
some direct their social economy, and regulate the 
condition under which they live together either in 
monarchies or republics, their colonizations, and their 
migrations : but the most powerful instinct which 
belongs to insects has regard to the preservation of 
their species. We find, accordingly, that as the ne- 
cessity for this preservation is of the utmost importance 
in the economy of nature, so for this especial object 
many insects, whose offspring, whether in the egg or 
the larva state, are peculiarly exposed to danger, 
are endued with an almost miraculous foresight, and 
with an ingenuity, perseverance, and unconquerable 
industry, for the purpose of avoiding those dangers, 
which are not to be paralleled even by the most singu- 
lar efforts of human contrivance. The same ingenuity 
which is employed for protecting either eggs, or ca- 
terpillars and grubs, or pupae and chrysalides, is also 
exercised by many insects for their own preservation 
against the changes of temperature to which they are 
exposed, or against their natural enemies. Many 





species employ those contrivances during the period 
of their hybernation, or winter-sleep. For all these 
purposes some dig holes in the earth, and form them 
into cells; others build nests of extraneous substances, 
such as bits of wood and leaves ; others roll up leaves 
into cases, which they close with the most curious 
art ; others build a house of mud, and line it with 
the cotton of trees, or the petals of the most delicate 
flowers ; others construct cells, of secretions from 
their own bodies ; others form cocoons, in which 
they undergo their transformation ; and others dig 
subterraneous galleries, which, in complexity of ar- 
rangement, in solidity, and in complete adaptation to 
their purposes, vie with the cities of civilized man. 
The contrivances by which insects effect these ob- 
jects have been accurately observed and minutely de- 
scribed, by patient and philosophical inquirers, who 
knew that such employments of the instinct with 
which each species is endowed by its Creator offered 
the most valuable and instructive lessons, and opened 
to them a wide field of the most delightful study. 
The construction of their habitations is certainly 
among the most remarkable peculiarities in the 
economy of insects ; and it is of this subject that we 
propose to treat under the general name, which is 
sufficiently applicable to our purpose, of Insect 
Architecture. 







In the descriptions which we shall give of Insect 
Architecture, we shall employ as few technical words 
as possible ; and such as we cannot well avoid, we 
shall explain in their places : but, since our subject 
chiefly relates to the reproduction of insects, it may 
be useful to many readers to introduce here a brief 
description of the changes which they undergo. 

* It was of old believed that insects were produced 
spontaneously by putrefying substances ; and Virgil 
gives the details of a process for creating a swarm 
of bees out of the carcase of a bull : but Redi, a cele- 
brated Italian naturalist, proved by rigid experiments 
that they are always, in such cases, hatched from eggs 
previously laid. Most insects, indeed, lay eggs, though 
some few are viviparous, and some, like serpents, 
propagate both ways. The eggs of insects are very 
various in form, and seldom shaped like those of 
birds. We have here figured those of several species, 
as they appear under the microscope. 




Eggs of Insects, — Magnified. 







When an insect first issues from the egg, it is called 
by naturalists larva , and, popularly, a caterpillar, a 
grub, or a maggot. The distinction, in popular lan- 
guage, seems to be, that caterpillars are produced 
from the eggs of moths or butterflies ; grubs, from 
the eggs of beetles, bees, wasps, &c. ; and maggots 
(which are without feet) from blow-flies, house-flies, 
cheese-flies, &c., though this is not very rigidly ad- 
hered to in common parlance. Maggots are also 
sometimes called worms, as in the instance of the 
meal-worm ; but the common earth-worm is not a 
larva, nor is it by modern naturalists ranked among 
insects. 

Larvae are remarkably small at first, but grow 
rapidly. The full-grown caterpillar of the goat-moth 
( Cossus ligniperda ) is thus seventy-two thousand 
times heavier than when it issues from the egg ; and 




Larvae, Grubs, Caterpillars, or Maggots. 








the maggot of the blow-fly is, in twenty-four hours, 
one hundred and fifty-five times heavier than at its 
birth. Some larvae have feet, others are without: 
none have wings. They cannot propagate. They feed 
voraciously on coarse substances ; and as they increase 
in size, which they do very rapidly, they cast their skins 
three or four times. In defending themselves from 
injury, and in preparing for their change by the con- 
struction of secure abodes, they manifest great inge- 
nuity and mechanical skill. The figures on the pre- 
ceding page, exemplify various forms of insects in this 
stage of their existence. 

When larvae are full grown, they cast their skins 
for the last time, undergo a complete change of form, 
and, with a few exceptions, cease to eat, and remain 
nearly motionless. When an insect, after this change, 
does not lose its legs, or continues to eat and move, 
it is popularly called a Nymph ; and when the inner 
skin of the larva is converted into a membranous or 
leathery covering, which wraps the insect closely up 
like a mummy, it is termed Pupa , from its resem- 




Pupce, or Chrysalides. 



blance to an infant in swaddling bands. From the 
pupae of many of the butterflies appearing gilt as if 







with gold, the Greeks called them Chrysalides , and 
the Romans Aur elite , and hence naturalists frequently 
call a pupa, chrysalis , even when it is not gilt. We 
shall see, as we proceed, the curious contrivances re- 
sorted to for protecting insects in this helpless state. 

After a certain time, the insect which has re- 
mained in its pupa-case, like a mass of jelly without 
shape, is gradually preparing for its final change, 
when it takes the form of a perfect insect. This 
state was called by Linnaeus, Imago , because the 
insect, having thrown off its mask, becomes a per- 
fect image of its species. Of some, this last por- 
tion of their existence is very short, others live 




Insects in the Imago or perfect state. 







through a year, and some exist for longer periods. 
They feed lightly, and never increase in size. The 
chief object of all is to perpetuate their species, after 
which the greater number quickly die. It is in this 
state that they exercise those remarkable instincts for 
the preservation of their race, which are exhibited in 
their preparations for the shelter of their eggs, and 
the nourishment of their larvae. The foregoing are 
examples of insects in the imago , or perfect state. 







STRUCTURES FOR PROTECTING EGGS. — MASON-WASPS ; 

mason-bees; mining-bees. 

The provisions which are made by the different 
species of’ insects for protecting’ their eggs, appear in 
many cases to be admirably proportioned to the kind 
of danger and destruction to which they may be ex- 
posed. The eggs themselves, indeed, are not so liable 
to depredation and injury as the young brood hatched 
from them; for, like the seeds of plants, they are capa- 
ble of withstanding greater degrees both of heat and 
cold than the insects which produce them. According 
to the experiments of Spallanzani, the eggs of frogs 
that had been exposed to various degrees of artificial 
heat, were scarcely altered in their productive powers 
by a temperature of 111° of Fahrenheit, but they 
became corrupted after 133°. He tried the same ex- 
periment upon tadpoles and frogs, and found they 
all died at 1 1 1°. Silk-worms died at a temperature 
of 10S°, while their eggs did not entirely cease to 
be fertile till 144°. The larvae of flesh-flies perished, 
while the eggs of the same species continued fertile, 
at about the same comparative degrees of heat as in 
the preceding instances. Intense cold has a still less 
effect upon eggs than extreme heat. Spallanzani ex- 
posed the eggs of silk-worms to an artificial cold 23° 
below zero, and yet, in the subsequent spring, they 
all produced caterpillars. Insects almost invariably 
die at the temperature of 14°, that is at 1S° below the 
freezing point*. The care of insects for the pro-

tection of their eggs is not entirely directed to their 
preservation in the most favourable temperature for 
being hatched, but to secure them against the nume- 
rous enemies which would attempt their destruction ; 
and, above all, to protect the grubs when they are 
first developed, from those injuries to which they are 
peculiarly exposed. Their prospective contrivances 
for accomplishing these objects are in the highest 
degree curious. 

Most persons have more or less acquaintance 
with the hives of the social species of bees and 
wasps : but little is generally known of the nests 
constructed by the solitary species, though in many 
respects these are not inferior to the others in dis- 
plays of ingenuity and skill. We admire the social 
bees, labouring together for one common end, in the 
same way that we look with delight upon the great 
division of labour in a well-ordered manufactory. 
As in a cotton-mill, some attend to the carding of 
the raw material, some to its formation into single 
threads, some to the gathering these threads upon 
spindles, others to the union of many threads into 
one, — all labouring with invariable precision because 
they attend to a single object ; — so do we view with 
delight and wonder the successive steps by which 
the hive-bees bring their beautiful work to its com- 
pletion, — striving, by individual efforts, to accomplish 
their general task, never impeding each other by use- 
less assistance, each taking a particular department, 
and each knowing its own duties. We may, how- 
ever, not the less admire the solitary wasp or bee, 
who begins and finishes every part of its destined 
work ; just as we admire the ingenious mechanic 
who perfects something useful or ornamental entirely 
by the labour of his own hands, — whether he be the 
patient Chinese carver, who cuts the most elaborately 
decorated boxes out of a solid piece of ivory, or the 





turner of Europe, who produces every variety of 
elegant form by the skilful application of the simplest 
means. 

Our island abounds with many varieties of solitary 
wasps and bees ; and their nests may therefore be 
easily discovered by those who, in the proper seasons, 
are desirous of observing the peculiarities of their 
architecture. 

Mason-Wasps. 

In September, 1828, a common species of solitary 
mason-wasp ( Odynerus , Latr.) was observed by us* 




Odynerus . — Natural size. 

on the east wall of a house at Lee, in Kent, very busy 
in excavating a hole in one of the bricks, about five 
feet from the ground. Whether there might not 
have been an accidental hole in the brick, before 
the wasp commenced her labours, is unknown, as 
she had made considerable progress in the work 
when first observed ; but the brick was one of the 
hardest of the yellow sort made in this neighbourhood. 
The most remarkable circumstance in the process of 
hewing into the brick, was the care of the insect in re- 
moving to a distance the fragments which from time 
to time she succeeded in detaching. It did not ap- 
pear to suit her design to wear down the brick, par- 
ticle by particle, as the furniture beetle ( Anobium 
pertinax ) does, in making its pin-hole galleries in 
old wood. Our wasp-architect, on the contrary, by 
means of her strong iranchant-ioo\h^6. jaws, severed

a piece usually about the bigness of a mustard-seed. 
It might have been supposed that these fragments 
would have been tossed out of the hole as the 
work proceeded, without further concern ; as the 
mole tosses above ground the earth which has been 
cleared out of its subterranean gallery. The wasp 
was of a different opinion ; for it was possible that 
a heap of brick chips, at the bottom of the wall, 
might lead to the discovery of her nest by some of 
her enemies, particularly by one or other of the 
numerous tribe of what are called ichneumon flies. 
This name is given to them, from the similarity of 
their habit of destroying eggs to that of the little 
animal which proves so formidable an enemy to the 
multiplication of the crocodile of Egypt. They may 
be also denominated cuckoo flies, because, like that 
bird, they thrust their egg into the nest of another 
species. These flies are continually prowling about 
and prying into every corner, to find, by stealth, a 
nidus for their eggs. It might have been some such 
consideration as this which induced the wasp to carry 
off the fragments as they were successively detached. 
That concealment was the motive, indeed, was proved ; 
for one of the fragments which fell out of the hole by 





accident, she immediately sought for at the bottom of 
the wall, and carried off like the rest. It was no easy 
matter to get out one of the fragments, as may readily 
be conceived when the size of the insect is compared 
with that of the entrance, of which this (©) is the 
exact size, as taken from the impression of a bit 
of dough upon the hole when finished. It was 
only by seizing the fragment with her jaws, and re- 
treating backwards, that the matter could be accom- 
plished ; though, after the interior of the excavation 
was barely large enough to admit of her turning 
round, she more than once attempted to make her 
exit head-foremost., but always unsuccessfully. The 
weight of the fragments removed did not appear to 
impede her flight, and she generally returned to her 
task in about two or three minutes. 

Within two days the excavation was completed; 
but it required two other days to line it with a coating 
of clay, to deposit the eggs, two in number, and, no 
doubt, to imprison a few live spiders or caterpillars, 
for the young when hatched, — a process which was 
first observed by Ray and Willoughby*, but which 
has since been frequently ascertained. In the present 
instance, this peculiarity was not seen ; but the little 
architect was detected in closing up the entrance, 
which was formed of a layer of clay more than 
double the thickness of the interior lining. In No- 
vember following, we hewed away the brick around 
this nest, and found the whole excavation was rather 
less than an inch in depth. 

Notwithstanding all the precautions of the careful 
parent to conceal her nest, it was found out by one of 
the cuckoo flies (Tachinn larvarum ?) — probably a 
common species very similar to the house-fly, but

rather larger, which deposited an egg there ; and the

undevoured grub of the wasp (b). Both awaited 
the return of summer to change into winged insects, 
burst their cerements, and proceed as their parents 
did. 






Mason- IFasp—(Odynerus murarius ). — Natural size. 

Another mason-wasp ( Odynerus murarius , Latr.), 
differing little in appearance from the former, may 
often be seen frequenting sandy banks exposed to 
the sun, and constructing its singular burrows. 





The sort of sand-bank which it selects is hard and 
compact; and though this maybe more difficult to 
penetrate, the walls are not liable to fall down upon 
the little miner. In such a bank, the mason-wasp 
bores a tubular gallery two or three inches deep. 
The sand upon which Reaumur found some of these 
wasps at work was almost as hard as stone, and 
yielded with difficulty to his nail ; but the wasps dug 
into it with ease, having recourse, as he ascertained, 
to the ingenious device of moistening it by letting 
fall two or three drops of fluid from their mouth, 
which rendered the mass ductile, and the separation 
of the grains easy to the double pickaxe of the little 
pioneers. 

When this wasp has detached a few grains of the 
moistened sand, it kneads them together into a 
pellet about the size of one of the seeds of a goose- 
berry. With the first pellet which it detaches, it 
lays the foundation of a round tower, as an out- 
work, immediately over the mouth of its nest. 
Every pellet which it afterwards carries off from 
the interior is added to the wall of this outer 
round tower, which advances in height as the 
hole in the sand increases in depth. Every two or 
three minutes, however, during these operations, it 
takes a short excursion, for the purpose, probably, of 
replenishing its store of fluid wherewith to moisten the 
sand. Yet so little time is lost, that Reaumur has 
seen a mason-wasp dig in an hour a hole the length 
of its body, and at the same time build as much of its 
round tower. For the greater part of its height 
this round tower is perpendicular; but towards the 
summit it bends into a curve, corresponding to the 
bend of the insect’s body, which, in all cases of 
insect architecture, is the model followed. The 
pellets which form the walls of the tower are not 
very nicely joined, and numerous vacuities are left

between them, giving it the appearance of fillagree 
work. That it should be thus slightly built is not 
surprising, for it is intended as a temporary structure 
for protecting the insect while it is excavating its 
hole; and as a pile of materials, well arranged and 
ready at hand, for the completion of the interior 
building, — in the same way that workmen make a 
regular pile of bricks near the spot where they are 
going to build. This seems, in fact, to be the main 
design of the tower, which is taken down as expedi- 
tiously as it had been reared. Reaumur thinks, that 
by piling in the sand which has previously been dug 
out, the wasp intends to guard its progeny for a time 
from being exposed to the too violent heat of the 
sun ; and he has even sometimes seen that there were 
not sufficient materials in the tower, in which case 
the wasp had recourse to the rubbish she had thrown 








out after the tower was completed. By raising a 
tower of the materials which she excavates, the wasp 
produces the same shelter from external heat, as a 
human creature would who chose to inhabit a deep 
cellar of a high house. She further protects her 
progeny from the ichneumon fly, as the engineer con- 
structs an outwork to render more difficult the ap- 
proach of an enemy to the citadel. Reaumur has seen 
this indefatigable enemy of the wasp peep into the 
mouth of the tower, and then retreat, apparently 
frightened at the depth of the cell which he was 
anxious to invade. 

The mason-wasp does not furnish the cell she has 
thus constructed with pollen* and honey, like the 
solitary bees, but with living caterpillars, and these 
always of the same species, — being of a green colour, 
and without feet. She fixes the caterpillars together 
in a spiral column : they cannot alter their position, 
although they remain alive. They are an easy prey 
to their smaller enemy ; and when the grub has eaten 
them all up, it spins a case, and is transformed into 
a nymph, which afterwards becomes a wasp. The 
number of caterpillars which is thus found in the 
lower cavity of the mason-wasp’s nest is ordinarily 
from ten to twelve. The mother is careful to lay in 
the exact quantity of provision which is necessary to 
the growth of the grub before he quits his retreat. 
He works through his store till his increase in this 
state is perfected, and he is on the point of under- 
going a change into another state, in which he re- 
quires no food. The careful purveyor, cruel indeed 
in her choice of a supply, but not the less directed 
by an unerring instinct, selects such caterpillars as 
she is conscious have completed their growth, and 
will remain thus imprisoned without increase or cor-

ruption till their destroyer has gradually satisfied the 
necessities of his being. “ All that the worm of the 
wasp,” says Reaumur, “ has to do in his nest, from 
his birth to his transformation, is to eat.” There is 
another species of wasp which does not at once en- 
close in its nest all the sustenance which its larva 
will require before transformation, but which, from 
time to time, imprisons a living caterpillar, and when 
that is consumed opens the nest and introduces 
another*. 

Mason-Bees. 

It would not be easy to find a more simple, and, 
at the same time, ingenious specimen of insect archi- 
tecture, than the nests of those species of solitary 
bees, which have been justly called mason-bees 
( Megachile , Latreille.) Reaumur, who was struck 
by the analogies between the proceedings of insects 
and human arts, first gave to bees, wasps, and cater- 
pillars those names which indicate the character 
of their labours ; and which, though they may be 
considered a little fanciful, are at least calculated to 
arrest the attention. The nests of mason-bees are 
constructed of various materials ; some with sand, 
some with earth mixed with chalk, and some with a 
mixture of earthy substances and wood. 

On the north-east wall of Greenwich Park, facing 
the road, and about four feet from the ground, we 
discoveredf, December 10th, 1828, the nest of a 
mason-bee, formed in the perpendicular line of 
cement between two bricks. Externally there was 
an irregular cake of dry mud, precisely as if a hand- 
ful of wet road-stuff had been taken from a cart-rut 
and thrown against the wall ; though, upon closer 
inspection, the cake contained more small stones

than usually occur in the mud of the adjacent cart- 
ruts. We should, in fact, have passed it by without 
notice, had there not been a circular hole on one side 
of it, indicating the perforation of some insect. This

hole was found to be the orifice of a cell about'an inch 
deep, exactly of the form and size of a lady’s thimble, 
finely polished, and of the colour of plaster of Paris, 
but stained in various places with yellow. 

This cell was empty ; but upon removing' the cake 
of mud, we discovered another cell, separated from 
the former by a partition about a quarter of an inch 
thick, and in it a living bee, from which the preceding 
figure was drawn, and which, as we supposed, had 
just changed from the pupa into the winged state, 
in consequence of the uncommon mildness ot the 
weather. The one which hud occupied the adjacent cell

had, no doubt, already dug its way out of its prison, 
and would probably fall a victim to the first frost. 

Our nest contained only two cells — perhaps from 
there not being room between the bricks for more. 




Cells of a Mason-Bee ( Anthophora retusa,') — One-third the natural size. 

An interesting account is given by Reaumur of ano- 
ther mason-bee ( Megachile muraria ), selecting earthy 
sand, grain by grain ; her gluing a mass of these toge- 
ther with saliva, and building with them her cells from 
the foundation. But the cells of the Greenwich Park 
nest were apparently composed of the mortar of the 
brick wall ; though the external covering seems to 
have been constructed as Reaumur describes his 
nest, with the occasional addition of small stones. 

About the middle of May, 1829, we discovered the 
mine from which all the various species of mason-bees 
in the vicinity seemed to derive materials for their 
nests*. It was a bank of brown clay, facing the east, 
and close by the margin of the river Ravensbourn, at 
Lee, in Kent. The frequent resort of the bees to this 
spot attracted the attention of some workmen, who, 
deceived by their resemblance to wasps, pointed it out 
as a wasp’s nest ; though they were not a little 
surprised to see so numerous a colony at this early 
season. As the bees had dug a hole in the bank, 



*J.K, 







where they were incessantly entering and re-appear- 
ing, we were of opinion that they were a peculiar 
sort of the social earth bees ( Bomb us ). On ap- 
proaching the spot, however, we remarked that the 
bees were not alarmed, and manifested none of the 
irritation usual in such cases, the consequence of 
jealous affection for their young. This led us to ob- 
serve their operations more minutely ; and we soon 
discovered that on issuing from the hole each bee 
carried out in its mandibles a piece of clay. Still 
supposing that they were social earth bees, we con- 
cluded that they were busy excavating a hollow for 
their nest, and carrying off the refuse to prevent dis- 
covery. The mouth of the hole was overhung, and 
partly concealed, by a large pebble. This we removed, 
and widened the entrance of the hole, intending to dig 
down and ascertain the state of the operations ; but 
we soon found that it was of small depth. The bees, 
being scared away, began scooping out clay from 
another hole about a yard distant from the first. 
Upon our withdrawing a few feet from the first hole, 
they returned thither in preference, and continued as- 
siduously digging and removing the clay. It became 
obvious, therefore, from their thus changing place, 
that they were not constructing a nest, but merely 
quarrying for clay as a building material. By catching 
one of the bees ( Osmia bicornis ) when it was loaded 
with its burden, we ascertained that the clay was not 
only carefully kneaded, but was also more moist than 
the mass from which it had been taken. The bee, 
therefore, in preparing the pellet, which was nearly 
as large as a garden pea, had moistened it with its 
saliva, or some similar fluid, to render it, we may 
suppose, more tenacious, and better fitted for build- 
ing. The reason of their digging a hole, instead of 
taking clay indiscriminately from the bank, appeared 
to be for the purpose of economizing their saliva, as 



MASON-BEES. 







the weather was clry, and the clay at the surface was 
parched and hard. It must have been this circum- 
stance which induced them to prefer digging a hole, 
as it were, in concert, though each of them had to 
build a separate nest. 

The distance to which they carried the clay was 
probably considerable, as there was no wall near, in 
the direction they all flew towards, upon which they 
could build ; and in the same direction also, it is 
worthy of remark, they could have procured much 
nearer the very same sort of clay. Whatever 
might be the cause of their preference, we could 
not but admire their extraordinary industry. It 
did not require more than half a minute to knead 
one of the pellets of clay ; and from their frequent 
returns, probably not more than five minutes to 
carry it to the nest, and apply it, were wanted. 
From the dryness of the weather, indeed, it was in- 
dispensable for them to work rapidly, otherwise the 
clay could not have been made to hold together. 
The extent of the whole labour of forming a single 
nest may be imagined, if we estimate that it must 
take several hundred pellets of clay ior its completion. 
If a bee work fourteen or fifteen hours a day, there- 
fore, carrying ten or twelve pellets to its nest every 
hour, it will be able to finish the structure in about 
two or three days ; allowing some hours of extra time 
for the more nice workmanship of the cells in which 
the eggs are to be deposited, and the young grubs 
reared. 

That the construction of such a nest is not a 
merely agreeable exercise to the mason-bee has been 
sufficiently proved by M. Du Hamel. He has ob- 
served a bee ( Megachile muraria) less careful to 
perform the necessary labour for the protection of 
her offspring than those we have described ; but, not 
less desirous of obtaining this protection, attempt to 

E 






usurp the nest which another had formed. A fierce 
battle was invariably the consequence of this attempt; 
for the true mistress would never give place to the 
intruder. The motive for the injustice and the re- 
sistance was an indisposition to further labour. The 
trial of strength was probably, sometimes, of as little 
use in establishing the right as it is amongst man- 
kind ; and the proper owner, exhausted by her 
efforts, had doubtless often to surrender to the dis- 
honest usurper. 

The account which Reaumur has given of the opera- 
tions of this class of bees differs considerably from 
that which we have here detailed ; from the species 
being different, or from his bees not having been able 
to procure moist clay. On the contrary, sand was 
the chief material used by his mason-bees ( Megachile 
muraria ) ; which they had the patience to select from 
the walks of a garden, and knead into a paste or 
mortar, adapted to their building. They had con- 
sequently to expend a much greater quantity of 
saliva, than our bees ( Osmia bicornis ) which worked 
with moist clay. Reaumur, indeed, ascertained that 
every individual grain of sand is moistened previous 
to its being joined to the pellet, in order to make 
it adhere more effectually. The tenacity of the 
mass is besides rendered stronger, he tells us, by 
adding a proportion of earth or garden mould. In 
this manner, a ball of mortar is formed, about the 
size of a small shot, and carried off to the nest. When 
the structure of this is examined, it has all the appear- 
ance externally of being composed of earth and small 
stones or gravel. The ancients, who were by no means 
accurate naturalists, having observed bees carrying 
pellets of earth and small stones, supposed that they 
employed these to add to their weight, in order to 
steady their flight when impeded by the wind. 

The nests thus constructed appear to have been 



MASON-BEES. 







more durable edifices than those which have fallen 
under our observation ; — for Reaumur says they 
were harder than many sorts of stone, and could 
scarcely be penetrated with a knife. Ours, on the 
contrary, do not seem harder than a piece of sun- 
baked clay, and by no means so hard as brick. One 
circumstance appeared inexplicable to Reaumur and 
his friend Du Hamel, who studied the operations of 
these insects in concert. After taking a portion of 
sand from one part of the garden-walk, the bees 
usually took another portion from a spot almost twenty 
and sometimes a hundred paces off, though the sand, 
so far as could be judged by close examination, was 
precisely the same in the two places. We should be 
disposed to refer this more to the restless character 
of the insect, than to any difference in the sand. 
We have observed a wasp paring the outside of a 
plank, for materials to form its nest; and though the 
plank was as uniform in the qualities of its surface, 
nay, probably more so than the sand could be, the 
wasp fidgeted about, nibbling a fibre from one, and 
a fibre from another portion, till enough was procured 
for one load. In the same way, the whole tribe of 
wasps and bees flit restlessly from flower to flower, 
not unfrequently revisiting the same blossom, again 
and again, within a few seconds. It appears to us, 
indeed, to be far from improbable, that this very rest- 
lessness and irritability may be one of the springs 
of their unceasing industry. 

By observing, with some care, the bees which we 
found digging the clay, we discovered one of them 
( Osmia bicornis) at work upon a nest, about a gun- 
shot from the bank. The place it had chosen was 
the inner wall of a coal-house, facing the south-west, 
the brick-work of which was but roughly finished. 
In an upright interstice of half an inch in width, be- 
tween two of the bricks, we found the little architect 









assiduously building its walls. The bricklayer’s 
mortar had either partly fallen out, or been removed 
by the bee, who had commenced building at the 
lower end, and did not build downwards, as the 
social wasps construct their cells. 

The very different behaviour of the insect here, and 
at the quarry, struck us as not a little remarkable. 
When digging and preparing the clay, our approach, 
however near, produced no alarm ; the work went 
on as if we had been at a distance; and though 
we were standing close to the hole, this did not scare 
away any of the bees upon their arrival to procure a 
fresh load. But if we stood near the nest, or even in 
the way by which the bee flew to it, she turned back 
or made a wide circuit immediately, as if afraid to 
betray the site of her domicile. We even observed 
her turning back, when we were so distant that it 
could not reasonably be supposed she was jealous of 
us ; but probably she had detected some prowling 
insect-depredator, tracking her flight with designs 
upon her provision for her future progeny. We 
imagined we could perceive not a little art in her 
jealous caution, for she would alight on the tiles as 
if to rest herself; and even when she had entered the 
coal-house, she did not go directly to her nest, but 
again rested on a shelf, and at other times pre- 
tended to examine several crevices in the wall, at 
some distance from the nest. But when there was 
nothing to alarm her, she flew directly to the spot, 
and began eagerly to add to the building. 

It is in instances such as these, which exhibit the 
adaptation of instinct to circumstances, that our 
reason finds the greatest difficulty in explaining the 
governing principle of the minds of the inferior ani- 
mals. The mason-bee makes her nest by an inva- 
riable rule ; the model is in her mind, as it has been 
in the mind of her race from their first creation : they 



MASON-BEES. 







have learnt nothing; by experience. But the mode in 
which they accomplish this task varies according to 
the situations in which they are placed. They appear 
to have a glimmering of reason, employed as an 
accessary and instrument of their instinct. 

The structure, when finished, consisted of a wall of 
clay supported by two contiguous bricks, enclosing 
six chambers, within which a mass of pollen, rather 
larger than a cherry-stone, was deposited, together 
with an egg, from which in due time a grub was 
hatched. Contrary to what has been recorded by pre- 
ceding naturalists, with respect to other mason-bees, 
we found the cells in this instance quite parallel and 
perpendicular ; but it may also be remarked, that the

murariu in the fluting of an old pilaster ; about half the natural 
size. 

bee itself was a species altogether different from the 
one which we have described above as the Antho- 
phora return , and agreed with the figure of the one 
we caught quarrying the clay — ( Osmia bicornis.) 

There was one circumstance attending the pro- 
ceedings of this mason-bee which struck us not a 
little, though we could not explain it to our own 





satisfaction. Every time she left her nest for the pur- 
pose of procuring a fresh supply of materials, she 
paid a regular visit to the blossoms of a lilac tree 
which crrew near. Had these blossoms afforded a 
supply of pollen, with which she could have reple- 
nished her cells, we could have easily understood her 
design; but the pollen of the lilac is not suitable for 
this purpose, and that she had never used it was 
proved by all the pollen in the cells being yellow, 
whereas that of the lilac is of the same pale, purple 
colour as the flowers. Besides, she did not return im- 
mediately from the lilac tree to the building, but 
always went for a load of clay. There seemed to us, 
therefore, to be only two ways to explain the circum- 
stance : — she must either have applied to the lilac 
blossoms to obtain a refreshment of honey, or to pro- 
cure glutinous materials to mix with the clay. 

When employed upon the building itself, the bee 
exhibited the restless disposition peculiar to most 
hymenopterous* insects ; for she did not go on with 
one particular portion of her wall, but ran about from 
place to place every time she came to work. At first, 
when we saw her running from the bottom to the 
top of her building, we naturally imagined that she 
went up for some of the bricklayer’s mortar to mix 
with her own materials ; but upon minutely examining 
the walls afterwards, no lime could be discovered in 
their structure, similar to that which was apparent in 
the nest found in the wall of Greenwich Park. 

Reaumur mentions another sort of mason-bee, 
which selects a small cavity in a stone, in which she 
forms her nest of garden mould moistened with glu- 
ten, and afterwards closes the hole with the same 
material.

Mining-Bees. 

A very small sort of bees ( Andrence ), many of 
them not larger than a house-fly, dig; in the ground 
tubular galleries little wider than the diameter of 
their own bodies. Samouelle says, that all of them 
seem to prefer a southern aspect ; but we have found 
them in banks facing the east, and even the north. 
Immediately above the spot where we have described 
the mason-bees quarrying the clay, we observed seve- 
ral holes, about the diameter of the stalk of a to- 
bacco-pipe, into which those little bees were seen 
passing. The clay here was very hard ; and on 
passing a straw into the hole as a director, and digging- 
down for six or eight inches, a very smooth circular 
gallery was found, terminating in a thimble -shaped 
horizontal chamber, almost at rijrht angles to the 
entrance, and nearly twice as wide. In this chamber

there was a ball of bright yellow pollen, as round as 
a garden pea, and rather larger, upon which a small 
white grub was feeding ; and to which the mother 
bee had been adding, as she had just entered a minute 
before with her thighs loaded with pollen. That it 
was not the male, the load of pollen determined ; for 
the male has no apparatus for collecting or trans- 
porting it. The whole labour of digging the nest 
and providing food for the young is performed by 
the female. The females of the solitary bees have 
no assistance in their tasks. The males are idle ; and 
the females are unprovided with labourers, such as 
the queens of the hive command. 

Reaumur mentions that the bees of this sort, whose 
operations he had observed, piled up at the entrance 
of their galleries the earth which they had scooped 
out from the interior; and when the grub was hatched, 
and properly provided with food, the earth was again 
employed to close up the passage, in order to prevent 
the intrusion of ants, ichneumon flies, or other de- 
predators. In those which we have observed, this 
Was not the case ; but every species differs from 
another in some little peculiarity, though they agree 
in the general principles of their operations. 







CARPENTER-BEES ; CARPENTER-WASPS ; UPHOLSTERER* 

BEES. 

Carpenter-Bees. 

Among the solitary bees are several British species 
which come under that class called carpenter-bees by 
M. Reaumur, from the circumstance of their working 
in wood, as the mason-bees work in stone. We have 
frequently witnessed the operations of these inge- 
nious little workers, who are particularly partial to 
posts, palings, and the wood-work of houses which has 
become soft by beginning to decay. Wood actually 
decayed, or affected by dry-rot, they seem to reject 
as unfit for their purposes; but they make no objec- 
tions to any hole previously drilled, provided it be 
not too large ; and, like the mason-bees, they not 
unfrequently take possession of an old nest, a few 
repairs being all that in this case is necessary. 

When a new nest is to be constructed, the bee 
proceeds to chisel sufficient space for it out of the 
wood with her jaws. We say her , because the task 
in this instance, as in most others of solitary bees 
and wasps, devolves solely upon the female, the male 
taking no concern in the affair, and probably being 
altogether ignorant that such a work is going forward. 
It is, at least, certain that the male is never seen giv- 
ing his assistance, and he seldom, if ever, approaches 
the neighbourhood. The female carpenter-bee has a 
task to perform no less arduous than the mason-bee ; 
for though the wood may be tolerably soft, she can 








only cut out a very small portion at a time. The suc- 
cessive portions which she gnaws off may be readily 
ascertained by an observer, as she carries them away 
from the place. In giving the history of a mason- 
wasp ( Odynerus ), at page 25, we remarked the 
care with which she carried to a distance little frag:- 
ments of brick, which she detached in the progress of 
excavation. We have recently watched a precisely 
similar procedure in the instance of a carpenter-bee 
forming a cell in a wooden post *. The only difference 
was, that the bee did not fly so far away with her frag- 
ments of wood as the wasp did ; but she varied the 
direction of her flight every time : and we could ob- 
serve, that after dropping the chip of wood which she 
had carried off, she did not return in a direct line to 
her nest, but made a circuit of some extent before 
wheeling round to go back. 

On observing the proceedings of this carpenter-bee 
next day, we found her coming in with balls of pollen 
on her thighs ; and on tracing her from the nest into 
the adjacent garden, we saw her visiting every flower 
which was likely to yield her a supply of pollen for 
her future progeny. This was not all : we subse- 
quently saw her taking the direction of the clay- 
quarry frequented by the mason-bees, as we have 
mentioned in page 35, where we recognized her 
loading herself with a pellet of clay, and carrying it 
into her cell in the wooden post. We observed her 
alternating this labour for several days, at one time 
carrying clay, and at another pollen ; till at length 
she completed her task, and closed the entrance with 
a barricado of clay, to prevent the intrusion of any 
insectivorous depredator, who might make prey of 
her young; or of some prying parasite, who might 
introduce its own eggs into the nest she had taken 
so much trouble to construct.

cells contain the young grubs ; in fig. b the cells are empty. Both 
figures are shown in section, and about half the natural size. 

Some days after it was finished, we cut into the 
post, and exposed this nest to view. It consisted of 
six cells of a somewhat square shape, the wood 
forming the lateral walls ; and each was separated 
from the one adjacent by a partition of clay, of the 
thickness of a playing card. The wood was not 
lined with any extraneous substance, but was worked 
as smooth as if it had been chiselled by a joiner. 
There were five cells, arranged in a very singular 
manner — two being almost horizontal, two perpendi- 
cular, and one oblique. 

The depth to which the wood was excavated, in 
this instance, was considerably less than what we 
have observed in other species which dig perpendi- 
cular galleries several inches deep in posts and gar- 
den-seats ; and they are inferior in ingenuity to the 
carpentry of a bee described by Reaumur ( Xylocopa 
violacea ), which has not been ascertained to be a 
native of Britain, though a single indigenous species 
of the genus has been doubtingly mentioned, and is 







figured, by Kirby, in his valuable ‘ Monographia.’ Tf 
it ever be found here, its large size and beautiful 
violet-coloured wings will render mistakes impos- 
sible. 

The violet carpenter-bee usually selects an up- 
right piece of wood, into which she bores obliquely 
for about an inch ; and then, changing the direction, 
works perpendicularly, and parallel to the sides of 
the wood, for twelve or fifteen inches, and half an 
inch in breadth. Sometimes the bee is contented 
with one or two of these excavations ; at other times, 
when the wood is adapted to it, she scoops out three 
or four — a task which sometimes requires several 
weeks of incessant labour. 

The tunnel in the wood, however, is only one part 
of the work ; for the little architect has afterwards 
to divide the whole into cells, somewhat less than an 
inch in depth. It is necessary, for the proper growth 
of her progeny, that each should be separated from 
the other, and be provided with adequate food. She 
knows, most exactly, the quantity of food which each 
grub will require, during its growth ; and she there- 
fore does not hesitate to cut it otf from any additional 
supply. In constructing her cells, she does not employ 
clay, like the bee which we have mentioned above, 
but the sawdust, if we may call it so, which she has 
collected in gnawing out the gallery. It would not, 
therefore, have suited her design to scatter this about, 
as our carpenter-bee did. The violet bee, on the 
contrary, collects her gnawings into a little store-heap 
for future use, at a short distance from her nest. She 
proceeds thus : — At the bottom of her excavation she 
deposits an egg, and over it fills a space nearly an 
inch high with the pollen of flowers, made into a paste 
with honey. She then covers this over with a ceiling 
composed of cemented sawdust, which also serves 
for the floor of the next chamber above it. For this

purpose, she cements round a wall a ring of wood 
chips, taken from her store- heap ; and within this ring 
forms another, gradually contracting the diameter till 
she has constructed a circular plate, about the thick- 
ness of a crown-piece, and of considerable hardness. 





This plate of course exhibits concentric circles, some- 
what similar to the annual circles in the cross section 
of a tree. In the same manner she proceeds till she 
has completed ten or twelve cells ; and then she closes 
the main entrance with a barrier of similar materials. 

Let us compare the progress of this little joiner with 
a human artisan — one who has been long practised in 
his trade, and has the most perfect and complicated 
tools for his assistance. The bee has learnt nothing 
by practice ; she makes her nest but once in her life, 
but it is then as complete and finished as if she had 
made a thousand. She has no pattern before her — 
but the Architect of all things has impressed a plan 
upon her mind, which she can realize without scale 
or compasses. Her two sharp teeth are the only 
tools with which she is provided for her laborious 
work ; and yet she bores a tunnel, twelve times the 
length of her own body, with greater ease than the 
workman who bores into the earth for water, with 
his apparatus of augers adapted to every soil. Her 
tunnel is clean and regular ; she leaves no chips at 
the bottom, for she is provident of her materials. 
Further, she has an exquisite piece of joinery to per- 
form, when her ruder labour is accomplished. The 
patient bee works her rings from the circumference 
to the centre, and she produces a shelf, united with 
such care with her natural glue, that a number of 
fragments are as solid as one piece. 

The violet carpenter-bee, as may be expected, oc- 
cupies several weeks in these complicated labours ; 
and during that period she is gradually depositing 
her eggs, each of which is successively to become 
a grub, a pupa, and a perfect bee. It is obvious, 
therefore, as she does not lay all her eggs in the 
same place — as each is separated from the other by 
a laborious process — that the egg which is first laid 
will be the earliest hatched ; and that the first perfect 






insect, being older than its fellows in the same tun- 
nel, will strive to make its escape sooner, and so on 
of the rest. The careful mother provides for this 
contingency. She makes a lateral opening at the 
bottom of the cells ; for the teeth of the young bees 
would not be strong enough to pierce the outer wood, 
though they can remove the cemented rings of saw- 
dust in the interior. Reaumur observed these holes, 
in several cases ; and he further noticed another ex- 
ternal opening opposite to the middle cell, which he 
supposed was formed, in the first instance, to shorten 
the distance for the removal of the fragments of wood 
in the lower half of the building. 

That bees of similar habits, if not the same spe- 
cies as the violet bee, are indigenous to this country, 
is proved by Grew, who mentions, in his c Rarities 
of Gresham College,’ having found a series of such 
cells in the middle of the pith of an old elder branch, 
in which they were placed lengthwise, one after an- 
other, with a thin boundary between each. As he 
does not, however, tell us that he was acquainted 
with the insect which constructed these, it might 
as probably be allied to the Ceratina albilabris, of 
which Spinola has given so interesting an account 
in the ‘ Annales du Museum d’Histoire Naturelle’ 
(x. 236). This noble and learned naturalist tells 
us, that one evening he perceived a female ceratina 
alight on the branch of a bramble, partly withered, 
and of which the extremity had been broken ; and, 
after resting a moment, suddenly disappear. On 
detaching the branch, he found that it was perfo- 
rated, and that the insect was in the very act of exca- 
vating a nidus for her eggs. He forthwith gathered 
a bundle of branches, both of the bramble and the 
wild-rose, similarly perforated, and took them home 
to examine them at leisure. Upon inspection, he 





found that the nests were furnished, like those of the 
same tribe, with balls of pollen kneaded with honey, 
as a provision for the grubs. 

The female ceratina selects a branch of the bramble 
or wild-rose which has been accidentally broken, and 
digs into the pith only, leaving the wood and bark 
untouched. Her mandibles, indeed, are not adapted 
for gnawing wood; and, accordingly, he found in- 
stances in which she could not finish a nest in 
branches of the wild-rose, where the pith was not of 
sufficient diameter. 

The insect usually makes her perforation a foot in 
depth, and divides this into eight, nine, or even 
twelve cells, each about five lines long, and sepa- 
rated by partitions formed of the gnawings of the 
pith, cemented by honey, or some similar glutinous 
fluid, much in the same manner with the ocylocopa 
violacea , which we have already described. 

Carpenter-Wasps. 

As there are mason-wasps similar in economy to 
mason-bees, so are there solitary carpenter-wasps 
which dig galleries in timber, and partition them out 
into several cells by means of the gnawings of the 
wood which they have detached. This sort of 
wasp is of the genus Eumenes. The wood se- 
lected is generally such as is soft, or in a state of 
decay ; and the hole which is dug in it is much less 
neat and regular than that of the carpenter-bees, 
while the division of the chambers is nothing 1 more 
than the rubbish produced during the excavation. 

The provision which is made for the grub consists 
of flies or gnats piled into the chamber, but without 
the nice order remarkable in the spiral columns of 
green caterpillars provided by the mason-wasp 
( Odynerus murarius). The most remarkable cir- 
cumstance is, that in some of the species, when the

grub is about to go into the pupa state, it spins a 
case (a cocoon), into which it interweaves the wings 
of the flies whose bodies it has previously devoured. 
In other species, the gnawings of the wood are em- 
ployed in a similar manner. 

Upholsterer-Bees. 

In another part of this volume we shall see how 
certain caterpillars construct abodes for themselves, 
by cutting off portions of the leaves or bark of 
plants, and uniting them by means of silk into a 
uniform and compact texture ; but this scarcely ap- 
pears so wonderful as the prospective labours of 
some species of bees for the lodgment of their pro- 
geny. We allude to the solitary bees, known by the 
name of the leaf-cutting bees, but which may be de- 
nominated more generally upholsterer-becs , as there 
are some of them which use other materials beside 
leaves. 





One species of our little upholsterers has been 
called the poppy-bee ( Osmia papaveris , Latr.), 
from its selecting the scarlet petals of the poppy as 
tapestry for its cells. Kirby and Spence express 
their doubts whether it is indigenous to this coun- 
try: we are almost certain that we have seen the 
nests in Scotland*. At Largs, in Ayrshire, a beau- 
tiful sea-bathing village on the Firth of Clyde, in 
July, 1814, we found in a foot-path a great num- 
ber of the cylindrical perforations of the poppy- 
bee. Reaumur remarked that the cells of this bee 
which he found at Bercy, were situated in a nor- 
thern exposure, contrary to what he had remarked 
in the mason-bee, which prefers the south. The 
cells at Largs, however, were on an elevated bank, 
facing the south, near Sir Thomas Brisbane's ob- 
servatory. With respect to exposure, indeed, no 
certain rule seems applicable ; for the nests of mason- 
bees which we found on the wall of Greenwich Park 
faced the north-east, and we have often found car- 
penter-bees make choice of a similar situation. In 
one instance, we found carpenter-bees working in- 
differently on the north-east and south-west side of 
the same post. 

As we did not perceive any heaps of earth near 
the holes at Largs, we concluded that it must either 
have been carried off piecemeal when they were 
dug, or that they were old holes re-occupied, — (a 
circumstance common with bees), and that the rub- 
bish had been trodden down by passengers. Reau- 
mur, who so minutely describes the subsequent opera- 
tions of the bee, says nothing respecting its excava- 
tions. One of these holes is about three inches deep, 
gradually widening as it descends, till it assumes the 
form of a small Florence flask. The interior of this 
is rendered smooth, uniform, and polished, in order 



* J, R 




to adapt it to the tapestry with which it is in- 
tended to be hung, and which is the next step in the. 
process. 

The material used for tapestry by the insect uphol- 
sterer is supplied by the petals* of the scarlet field- 
poppy, from which she successively cuts off small 
pieces of an oval shape, seizes them between her legs, 
and conveys them to the nest. She begins her work 
at the bottom, which she overlays with three or four 
leaves in thickness, and the sides have never less than 
two. When she finds that the piece she has brought 
is too large to fit the place intended, she cuts off what 
is superfluous, and carries away the shreds. By cut- 
ting the fresh petal of a poppy with a pair of scissors, 
we may perceive the difficulty of keeping the piece 
free from wrinkles and shrivelling ; but the bee knows 
how to spread the pieces which she uses as smooth 
as glass. 

When she has in this manner hung the little cham- 
ber all round with this splendid scarlet tapestry, of 
which she is not sparing, but extends it even be- 
yond the entrance, she then fills it with the pollen 
of flowers mixed with honey, to the height of about 
half an inch. In this magazine of provisions for her 
future progeny she lays an egg, and over it folds 
down the tapestry of poppy petals from above. The 
upper part is then filled in with earth ; but Latreille 
says, he has observed more than one cell constructed 
in a single excavation. This may account for Reau- 
mur’s describing them as sometimes seven inches 
deep ; a circumstance which Latreille, however, thinks 
very surprising. 

It will, perhaps, be impossible ever to ascertain, 
beyond a doubt, whether the tapestry-bee is led to 

* Petal is the term employed by botanists to denote the leaf, 
or division of the coloured portion of a flower, 







select the brilliant petals of the poppy from their co- 
lour, or from any other quality they may possess, 
of softness or of warmth, for instance. Reaumur 
thinks that the largeness, united with the flexibility 
of the poppy-leaves, determines her choice. Yet it 
is not improbable that her eye may be gratified 
by the appearance of her nest ; — that she may pos- 
sess a feeling of the beautiful in colour, and may 
look with complacency upon the delicate hang- 
ings of the apartment which she destines for her 
offspring. Why should not an insect be supposed 
to have a glimmering of the value of ornament? 
How can we pronounce, from our limited notion 
of the mode in which the inferior' animals think 
and act, that their gratifications are wholly bounded 
by the positive utility of the objects which sur- 
round them ? Why does a dog howl at the sound 
of a bugle, but because it offends his organs of hear- 
ing ? — and why, therefore, may not a bee feel glad- 
ness in the brilliant hues of her scarlet drapery, be- 
cause they are grateful to her organs of sight ? All 
these little creatures work, probably, with more neat- 
ness and finish than is absolutely essential for com- 
fort ; and this circumstance alone would imply that 
they have something of taste to exhibit, which pro- 
duces to them a pleasurable emotion. 

The tapestry-bee is, however, content with orna- 
menting the interior only of the nest which she forms 
for her progeny. She does not misplace her embel- 
lishments with the error of some human artists. She 
desires security as well as elegance ; and, therefore, 
she leaves no external traces of her operations. Hers 
is not a mansion rich with columns and friezes with- 
out, but cold and unfurnished within, like the deso- 
late palaces of Venice. She covers her tapestry 
quite round with the common earth ; and leaves her 
eggs enclosed in their poppy-case with a certainty 






that the outward shew of her labours will attract no 
plunderer. 

The poppy-bee may be known by its being rather 
more than a third of an inch long, of a black colour, 
studded on the head and back with reddish grey 
hairs ; the belly being grey and silky, and the rings 
margined with grey above, the second and third 
having an impressed transversal line. 

A species of solitary bee (Anthidium manicatum, 
Fabricius), by no means uncommon with us, forms 
a nest of a peculiarly interesting structure. Kirby and 
Spence say, that it does not excavate holes, but makes 
choice of the cavities of old trees, key-holes, and si- 
milar localities ; yet it is highly probable, we think, 
that it may sometimes scoop out a suitable cavity 
when it cannot find one ; for its mandibles seem 
equally capable of this, with those of any of the car- 
penter or mason bees. 

Be this as it may, the bee in question having se- 
lected a place suitably sheltered from the weather, 
and from the intrusion of depredators, proceeds to 
form her nest, the exterior walls of which she forms 
of the wool of pubescent plants, such as rose-cam- 
pion ( Lychnis coronario ), the quince ( Pyrus cydo- 
nia ), cats-ears ( Slachys lanata ), &c. “ It is very 

pleasant,” says Mr. White of Selborne, “ to see with 
what address this insect strips off the down, running 
from the top to the bottom of the branch, and shaving 
it bare with all the dexterity of a hoop shaver. When 
it has got a vast bundle, almost as large as itself, it 
flies away, holding it secure between its chin and its 
fore-legs 

The manner in which the cells of the nest are

made seems not to be very clearly understood. M. 
Latreille says, that after constructing her nest of the 
down of quince leaves, she deposits her eggs, together 
with a store of paste, formed of the pollen of flowers, 
for nourishing the grubs. Kirby and Spence, on the 
other hand, tell us, that “ the parent bee, after 
having constructed her cells, laid an egg in each, and 
filled them with a store of suitable food, plasters 
them with a covering of vermiform masses, appa- 
rently composed of honey and pollen; and having 
done this, aware, long before Count Rumford’s expe- 
riments, what materials conduct heat most slowly,” 
she collects the down from woolly plants, and “ sticks 
it upon the plaster that covers her cells, and thus 
closely envelops them with a warm coating of down, 
impervious to every change of temperature.” “ From 
later observations,” however, they are “ inclined to 
think that these cells may possibly, as in the case of 
the humble-bee, be in fact formed by the larva pre- 
viously to becoming a pupa, after having eaten the 
provision of pollen and honey with which the parent 
bee had surrounded it. The vermicular shape, how- 
ever, of the masses with which the cases are sur- 
rounded, does not seem easily reconcileable with this 
supposition, unless they are considered as the excre- 
ment of the larva.” * 

Whether or not this second explanation is the true 
one, we have not the means of ascertaining ; but we 
are almost certain the first is incorrect, as it is con- 
trary to the regular procedure of insects, to begin 
with the interior part of any structure, and work out- 
wards. We should imagine, then, that the down is 
first spread out into the form required, and afterwards 
plastered on the inside to keep it in form, when pro-

bably the grub spins the vermicular cells previous to 
its metamorphosis. 

It might prove interesting to investigate this more 
minutely ; and, as the bee is by no means scarce 
in the neighbourhood of London, it might not be 
difficult for a careful observer to witness all the details 
of this singular architecture. The bee may be readily 
known from its congeners, by its being about the size 
of the hive-bee, but more broad and flattened, blackish 
brown above, with a row of six yellow or white 
spots along each side of the rings, very like the rose- 
leaf cutter, and having the belly covered with yellow- 
ish brown hair, and the legs fringed with long hairs 
of a rather lighter colour. 

A common bee belonging to the family of uphol- 
sterers is called the rose-leaf cutter ( Megachile cen- 
tuncularis , Latr.). The singularly ingenious habits of 
this bee have long attracted the attention of naturalists, 
but the most interesting description is given by 
Reaumur. So extraordinary does the construction 
of their nests appear, that a French gardener having 
dug up some, and believing them to be the work of 
a magician, who had placed them in his garden with 
evil intent, sent them to Paris to his master, for ad- 
vice as to what should be done by way of exorcism. 
On applying to the Abbe Nollet, the owner of the 
garden was soon persuaded that the nests in ques- 
tion were the work of insects ; and M. Reaumur, to 
whom they were subsequently sent, found them to 
be the nests of one of the upholsterer-bees, and pro- 
bably of the rose-leaf cutter, though the nests in ques- 
tion were made of the leaves of the mountain-ash 
( Pyrus aucuparia). 

The rose-leaf cutter makes a cylindrical hole in a 
beaten pathway, for the sake of more consolidated 
earth, (or in the cavities of walls or decayed wood,) 



 



from six to ten inches deep, and does not throw the 
earth dug- out from it into a heap, like the an- 
drenae*. In this she constructs several cells about an 
inch in length, shaped like a thimble, and made of 
cuttings of leaves (not petals), neatly folded together, 
the bottom of one thimble-shaped cell being inserted 
into the mouth of the one below it, and so on in suc- 
cession. 

It is interesting to observe the manner in which 
this bee procures the materials for forming the tapes- 
try of her cells. The leaf of the rose-tree seems to 
be that which she prefers, though she sometimes 
takes other sorts of leaves, particularly those with ser- 
rated margins, such as the birch, the perennial mer- 
cury ( Mercurialis perennis ), mountain ash, &c. She 
places herself upon the outer edge of the leaf which 
she has selected, so that its margin may pass between 
her legs. Turning her head towards the point, she 
commences near the footstalk, and with her mandi- 
bles cuts out a circular piece with as much expedi- 
tion as we could do with a pair of scissors, and with 
more accuracy and neatness than could easily be done 
by us. As she proceeds, she keeps the cut portion be- 
tween her legs so as not to impede her progress ; and 
using her body for a trammel, as a carpenter would 
say, she cuts in a regular curved line. As she sup- 
ports herself during the operation upon the portion 
of the leaf which she is detaching, it must be ob- 
vious, when it is nearly cut off, that the weight of 
her body might tear it away, so as to injure the accu- 
racy of its curvilineal shape. To prevent any acci- 
dent of this kind, as soon as she suspects that her 
weight might tear it, she poises herself on her wings, 
till she has completed the incision. It has been 
said, by naturalists, that this manoeuvre of poising 



* See p. 43. 







herself on the wing, is to prevent her falling to the 
ground, when the piece gives way ; but as no winged 
insect requires to take any such precaution, our ex- 
planation is probably the true one. 




Rose-leaf-cutter bees, and nest lined with rose-leaves. 

With the piece which she has thus cut out, held in 
a bent position perpendicular to her body, she flies 
otF to her nest, and fits it into the interior with the ut- 
most neatness and ingenuity; and, without employing 
any paste or glue, she trusts, as Reaumur ascertained, 
to the spring the leaf takes, in trying to retain it in its 
position. It requires from nine to twelve pieces of 
leaf to form one cell, as they are not always of pre- 

 



cisely the same thickness. The interior surface of 
each cell consists of three pieces of leaf, of equal size, 
narrow at one end, but gradually widening at the 
other, where the width equals half the length. One 
side of each of the pieces is the serrated margin of 
the leaf from which it was cut, and this margin is 
always placed outermost, and the cut margin inner- 
most. Like most insects, she builds from the inte- 
rior, beginning with a layer of tapestry, which is 
composed of three or four oval pieces, larger in 
dimensions than the rest, adding a second and a 
third layer proportionately smaller. In forming 
these, she is careful not to place a joining opposite to 
a joining, but, with all the skill of a consummate ar- 
tificer, lays the middle of each piece of leaf over the 
margins of the others, so as by this means both to 
cover and strengthen the junctions. By repeating 
this process, she sometimes forms a fourth or fifth 
layer of leaves, taking care to bend the leaves at the 
narrow extremity or closed end of the cell, so as to 
bring them into a convex shape. 

When she has in this manner completed a cell, her 
next business is to replenish it with a store of honey 
and pollen, which, being chiefly collected from thistles, 
forms a beautiful rose-coloured conserve. In this 
she deposits a single egg, and then covers in the 
opening with three pieces of leaf, so exactly circular, 
that a pair of compasses could not define their mar- 
gin with more accuracy. In this manner the indus- 
trious and ingenious upholsterer proceeds till the 
whole gallery is filled, the convex extremity of the 
one fitting into the open end of the next, ancl serving 
both as a basis and as the means of strengthening 
it. If, by any accident, the labour of these insects is 
interrupted or the edifice deranged, they exhibit 
astonishing perseverance in setting it again to rights. 







Insects, indeed, are not easily forced to abandon any 
work which they may have begun. 

The monkish legends tell us that St. Francis 
Xavier, walking one day in a garden, and seeing an 
insect, of the Mantis genus, moving along in its 
solemn way, holding up its two fore legs as in the 
act of devotion, desired it to sing the praises of God. 
The legend adds that the saint immediately heard 
the insect carol a fine canticle with a loud emphasis. 
We want no miraculous voice to record the wonders 
of the Almighty hand, when we regard the insect 
world. The little rose-leaf cutter, pursuing her work 
with the nicest mathematical art — using no artificial 
instruments to form her ovals and her circles — know- 
ing that the elastic property of the leaves will retain 
them in their position — making her nest of equal 
strength throughout, by the most rational adjustment 
of each distinct part — demands from us something 
more than mere wonder; for such an exercise of 
instinctive ingenuity at once directs our admiration 
to the great Contriver, who has so admirably pro- 
portioned her knowledge to her necessities. 







carder-bees; humble-bees; social-wasps. 

The bees and wasps, whose ingenious architecture 
we have already examined, are solitary in their la- 
bours. Those we are about to describe live in so- 
ciety. The perfection of the social state among this 
class of insects is certainly that of the hive-bees. 
They are the inhabitants of a large city, where the 
arts are carried to a higher excellence than in small 
districts, enjoying little communication of intelli- 
gence. But the bees of the villages, if we may follow 
up the parallel, are not without their interest. Such 
are those which are called carder-bees and humble 
bees. 

Carder-Bees, 

The nests of the bees which Reaumur denomi- 
nates carders ( Bombus muscorum , Latr.), are by no 
means uncommon, and are well worth the study of 
the naturalist. During the hay harvest, they are fre- 
quently met with by mowers in the open fields and 
meadows ; but they may sometimes be discovered in 
hedge-banks, the borders of copses, or among moss- 
grown stones. The description of the mode of build- 
ing adopted by this bee has been copied by most of our 
writers on insects from Reaumur ; though he is not a 
little severe on those who write, without having ever 
had a single nest in their possession. We have been 
able to avoid such a reproach ; for we have now before 






ns a very complete nest of carder-bees, which differs 
from those described by Reaumur, in being made, not 
of moss, but withered grass. With this exception, 
we find that his account agrees accurately with our 
own observations*. 

The carder-bees select for their nest a shallow ex- 
cavation about half a foot in diameter ; but when they 
cannot find one to suit their purpose, they under- 
take the Herculean task of digging one themselves. 
They cover this hollow w T ith a dome of moss — some- 
times, as we have ascertained, of withered grass. 
They make use, indeed, of whatever materials maybe 
within their reach ; for they do not attempt to bring 
any thing from a distance, not even when they are 
deprived of the greater portion by an experimental 
naturalist. Their only method of transporting ma- 
terials to the building is by pushing them along the 
ground — the bee, for that purpose, working back- 
wards, with its head turned from the nest. If there 
is only one bee engaged in this labour, as usually 
happens in the early spring, when a nest is founded 
by a solitary female who has outlived the winter, she 
transports her little bundles of moss or grass by suc- 
cessive backward pushes, till she gets them home. 

In the latter part of the season, when the hive is 
populous and can afford more hands, there is an in- 
genious division of this labour. A file of bees, to the 
number sometimes of half a dozen, is established, 
from the nest to the moss or grass which they intend 
to use, the heads of all the file of bees being turned 
from the nest and towards the material. The last 
bee of the file lays hold of some of the moss with 
her mandibles, disentangles it from the rest, and 
having carded it with her fore-legs into a sort of felt 
or small bundle, she pushes it under her body to the

next bee, who passes it in the same manner to the 
next, and so on till it is brought to the border of the 
nest, — in the same way as we sometimes see sugar- 
loaves conveyed from a cart to a warehouse, by a file 
of porters throwing them from one to another. 




Fig. A represents two carder-bees heckling moss for their nests. 
B, exterior view of the nest of the carder-bee. 



The elevation of the dome, which is all built from 
the interior, is from four to six inches above the 
level of the field. Beside the moss or grass, they 
frequently employ coarse wax to form the ceiling of 
the vault, for the purpose of keeping out rain, and 



 



preventing high winds from destroying it. Before 
this finishing is given to the nest, we have re- 
marked, that on a fine sunshiny day, the upper 
portion of the dome was opened to the extent of 
more than an inch, in order, we suppose, to forward 
the hatching of the eggs in the interior ; but on the 
approach of night this was carefully covered in 
again. It was remarkable that the opening which 
we have just mentioned was never used by the bees 
for either their entrance or their exit from the nest, 
though they were all at work there, and, of course, 
would have found it the readiest and easiest passage. 
But they invariably made their exit and their entrance 
through the covert-way or gallery which opens at 
the bottom of the nest, and, in some nests, is about a 
foot long and half an inch wide. This is, no doubt, 
intended for concealment, from field-mice, polecats, 
wasps, and other depredators. 

On removing a portion of the dome and bringing 
the interior of the structure into view, we find little 
of the architectural regularity so conspicuous in the 
combs of a common bee-hive : instead of this sym- 
metry, there are only a few egg-shaped, dark-coloured 
cells, placed somewhat irregularly, but approaching 
more to the horizontal than to the vertical position, 
and connected together with small amorphous * 
columns of brown wax. Sometimes there are two or 
three of these oval cells placed one above another, 
without anything to unite them. 

These cells are not, however, the workmanship of 
the old bees, but of their young grubs, who spin 
them when they are about to change into nymphs. 
But, from these cases, when they are spun, the en- 
closed insects have no means of escaping, and they 
depend for their liberation on the old bees gnawing

off the covering’, as is done also by ants in the 
same circumstances. The instinct with which they 
know the precise time when it is proper to do this 
is truly wonderful. It is no less so, that these 
cocoons are by no means useless when thus un- 
tenanted, for they subsequently serve for honey-pots, 
and are indeed the only store-cells in the nest. For 
this purpose the edge of the cell is repaired and 
strengthened with a ring of wax. 




Breeding-Cells. 



The true breeding-cells are contained in several 
amorphous masses of brown-coloured wax, varying 
in dimensions, but of a somewhat flat and globular 
shape. On opening any of these, a number of eggs 
or ffrubs are found, on whose account the mother 
bee has collected the masses of wax, which also con- 
tain a supply of pollen moistened with honey, for 
their subsistence. 

The number of eggs or grubs found in one sphe- 
roid of wax varies from three to thirty, and the bees 
in a whole nest seldom exceed sixty. There are 
three sizes of bees, of which the females are the 
largest; but neither these nor the males are, as in 
the case of the hive-bee, exempt from labour. The 
females, indeed, always found the nests, since they 
alone survive the winter, all the rest perishing with 
cold. In each nest, also, are several females, that 
live in harmony together. 








Interior views of Carder-bee’s Nest. 



The carder-bees may be easily distinguished from 
their congeners (of the same genus), by being not 
unlike the colour of the withered moss with which 
they build their nests, having the fore part of their 
back a dull orange, and hinder part ringed with dif- 
ferent shades of greyish yellow. They are not so 
large as the common humble-bee ( Bombas terrestris, 
Latr.), but rather shorter and thicker in the body 
than the common hive-bee {Apis mellifica).

A bee still more common, perhaps, than the carder, 
is the orange-tailed bee, or lapidary ( Bombus lapi- 
daria), readily known by its general black colour and 
reddish orange tail. It builds its nest sometimes in 
stony ground, but prefers a heap of stones such as 
are gathered off grass fields, or are piled up near 
quarries. Unlike the carder, the lapidary carries to its 
nest bits of moss, which are very neatly arranged into 
a regular oval. These insects associate in their 
labours ; and they make honey with great industry. 
The individuals of a nest are more numerous than 
the carders, and likewise more pertinaciously vin- 
dictive. About two years ago, we discovered a nest 
of these bees at Compton-Basset, in Wiltshire, in the 
centre of a heap of limestone rubbish ; but owing 
to the brisk defensive warfare of their legionaries, 
we could not obtain a view of the interior. It was 
not even safe to approach within many yards of the 
place, and we do not exaggerate when we say that 
several of them pursued us most pertinaciously about 
a quarter of a mile *. 

Humble-Bees. 

The common humble-bee ( Bombus terrestris ) is 
precisely similar in its economy to the two preceding 
species, with this difference, that it forms its nest 
underground like the common wasp, in an excavated 
chamber, to which a winding passage leads, of from 
one to two feet, and of a diameter sufficient to allow 
of two bees passing. The cells have no covering 
beside the vault of the excavation and patches of 
coarse wax similar to that of the carder- bee.

Social-Wasps. 

The nest of the common wasp ( Vespa vulgaris) 
attracts more or less the attention of everybody ; but 
its interior architecture is not so well known as it 
deserves to be, for its singular ingenuity, in which it 
rivals even that of the hive-bee ( Apis mellifica). 
In their general economy, the social, or republican 
wasps, closely resemble the humble-bee ( Bombus ), 
every colony being founded by a single female who 
has survived the winter, to the rigours of which all 
her summer associates of males and working wasps 
uniformly fall victims. Nay, out of three hundred 
females which may be found in one vespiary, or 
wasp’s nest, towards the close of autumn, scarcely ten 
or a dozen survive till the ensuing spring, at which 
season they awake from their hybernal lethargy, and 
begin with ardour the labours of colonization. 

It may be interesting to follow one of these mo- 
ther wasps through her several operations, in which 
she merits more the praise of industry than the queen 
of a bee-hive, who does nothing, and never moves 
without a numerous train of obedient retainers, al- 
ways ready to execute her commands and to do her 
homage. The mother wasp, on the contrary, is at 
first alone, and is obliged to perform every species 
of drudgery herself. 

Her first care, after being roused to activity by the 
returning warmth of the season, is to discover a 
place suitable for her intended colony ; and, ac- 
cordingly, in the spring, wasps may be seen prying 
into every hole of a hedge bank, particularly where 
field-mice have burrowed. Some authors report 
that she is partial to the forsaken galleries of the 
mole, but this does not accord with our observations, 
as we have never met with a single vespiary in any 
situation likely to have been frequented by moles. 






But though we cannot assert the fact, we think it 
highly probable that the deserted nest of the field- 
mouse, which is not uncommon in hedge banks, may 
be sometimes appropriated by a mother wasp as an 
excavation convenient for her purpose. Yet, if she 
does make choice of the burrow of a field-mouse, it 
requires to be afterwards considerably enlarged in 
the interior chamber, and the entrance gallery very 
much narrowed. 

The desire of the wasp to save herself the labour 
of excavation, by forming her nest where other ani- 
mals have burrowed, is not without a parallel in the 
actions of quadrupeds, and even of birds. In the 
splendid continuation of Wilson’s American Orni- 
thology, by Charles L. Bonaparte (whose scientific 
pursuits have thrown round that name a beneficent 
lustre, pleasingly contrasted with his uncle’s glory), 
there is an interesting example of this instinctive 
adoption of the labours of others. “ In the trans- 
Mississippian territories of the United States, the 
burrowing-owl resides exclusively in the villages 
of the marmot, or prairie-dog, whose excavations 
are so commodious, as to render it unnecessary 
that the owl should dig for himself, as he is 
said to do where no burrowing animals exist'". 
The villages of the prairie-dog are very nume- 
rous and variable in their extent, — sometimes 
covering only a few acres, and at others spreading 
over the surface of the country for miles together. 
They are composed of slightly-elevated mounds, 
having the form of a truncated cone, about two feet 
in width at the base, and seldom rising as high as 
eighteen inches from the surface of the soil. The 

* The owl observed by Vieillot in St. Domingo digs itself a 
burrow two feet in depth, at the bottom of which it deposits its 
eggs upon a bed of moss. 







entrance is placed either at the top or on the side, 
and the whole mound is beaten down externally, 
especially at the summit, resembling a much-used 
footpath. From the entrance, the passage into the 
mound descends vertically for one or two feet, and 
is thence continued obliquely downwards until it ter- 
minates in an apartment, within which the industrious 
prairie-dog constructs, on the approach of cold 
weather, a comfortable cell for his winter’s sleep. 
The cell, which is composed of fine dry grass, is 
globular in form, with an opening at top, capable of 
admitting the finger ; and the whole is so firmly 
compacted, that it might, without injury, be rolled 
over the floor*.” 

In case of need the wasp is abundantly fur- 
nished by nature with instruments for excavating a 
burrow out of the solid ground, as she no doubt 
most commonly does, — digging the earth with her 
strong mandibles, and carrying it off or pushing it 
out as she proceeds. The entrance-gallery is about 
an inch or less in diameter, and usually runs in a 
winding or zigzag direction, from one to two feet in 
depth. In the chamber to which this gallery leads, 
and which, when completed, is from one to two feet 
in diameter, the mother wasp lays the foundations of 
her city, beginning with the walls. 

The building materials employed by wasps were 
long a matter of conjecture to scientific inquirers ; for 
the bluish-grey papery substance of the whole struc- 
ture has no resemblance to any sort of wax employed 
by bees for a similar purpose. Now that the discovery 
has been made, we can with difficulty bring our- 
selves to believe that a naturalist so acute and inde- 
fatigable as M. Reaumur should have, for twenty 
years, as he tells us, endeavoured, without success, 

* American Ornithology, by Charles Lucien Bonaparte. Vol. i. 
p. G9. 





to find out the secret. At length, however, his per- 
severance was rewarded. He remarked a female 
wasp alight on the sash of his window, and begin to 
gnaw the wood with her mandibles ; and it struck 
him at once that she was procuring materials for 
building. He saw her detach from the wood a 
bundle of fibres about a tenth of an inch in length, 
and finer than a hair ; and as she did not swallow 
these, but gathered them into a mass with her feet, 
he could not doubt that his first idea was correct. 
In a short time she shifted to another part of the 
window-frame, carrying with her the fibres she had 
collected, and to which she continued to add, when 
he caught her, in order to examine the nature of her 
bundle ; and he found that it was not yet moistened 
nor rolled into a ball, as is always done before em- 
ploying it in building. In every other respect it 
had precisely the same colour and fibrous texture 
as the walls of a vespiary. It struck him as remark- 
able that it bore no resemblance to wood gnawed 
by other insects, such as the goat-moth caterpillar, 
which is granular like sawdust. This would not 
have suited the design of the wasp, who was well 
aware that fibres of some length form a stronger 
texture. He even discovered, that before detaching 
the fibres, she bruised them ( les charpissoit) into a 
sort of lint ( charpie ) with her mandibles. All this 
the careful naturalist imitated by bruising and paring 
the same wood of the window-sash with his pen- knife, 
till he succeeded in making a little bundle of fibres 
scarcely to be distinguished from that collected by the 
wasp. 

We have ourselves frequently seen wasps em- 
ployed in procuring their materials in this manner, 
and have always observed that they shift from one 
part to another more than once in preparing a single 
load, — a circumstance which we ascribe entirely to 







the restless temper peculiar to the whole order of 
hymenopterous insects. Reaumur found that the 
wood which they preferred was such as had been 
long exposed to the weather, and is old and dry. 
White of Selborne, and Kirby and Spence, on the 
contrary, maintain that wasps obtain their paper 
from sound timber, hornets only from that which is 
decayed*. Our own observations, however, confirm 
the statement of Reaumur, with respect to wasps, as, 
in every instance which has fallen under our notice, 
the wood selected was very much weathered ; and in 
one case an old oak post in a garden at Lee, in 
Kent, half destroyed by dry-rot, was seemingly the 
resort of all the wasps in the vicinity. In another 
case, the deal bond in a brick wall, which had been 
built thirty years, is at this moment (June, 1829) 
literally striped with the gnawings of wasps, which 
we have watched at the work for hours together!*. 

The bundles of ligneous fibres thus detached, are 
moistened, before being used, with a glutinous liquid, 
which causes them to adhere together, and are then 
kneaded into a sort of paste, or papier mache. 
Having prepared some of this material, the mother 
wasp begins first to line with it the roof of her 
chamber, for wasps always build downwards. The 
round ball of fibres which she has previously kneaded 
up with glue, she now forms into a leaf, walking 
backwards, and spreading it out with her mandibles, 
her tongue, and her feet, till it is as thin almost as 
tissue paper. 

One sheet, however, of such paper as this would 
form but a fragile ceiling, quite insufficient to pre- 
vent the earth from falling down into the nest. The 
wasp, accordingly, is not satisfied with her work 

* Reaumur, vol. vi. bottom of page 182; Hist, of Selb. ii. 
228 ; and Inlrod. to Entomol. i. 504, 5th edition.

till she has spread fifteen or sixteen layers one above 
the other, rendering the wall altogether nearly two 
inches thick. The several layers are not placed in 
contact like the layers of a piece of pasteboard, but 
with small intervals or open spaces between, ap- 
pearing somewhat like a grotto built with bivalve 
shells, particularly when looked at on the outside. 
This is probably caused by the insect working in a 
curvilineal manner.

Z>, c c, five small terraces of cells lor the neuter wasps ; rfrf.ee, 
three rows of larger cells for the males and females. 



Having finished the ceiling, she next begins to 
build the first terrace of her city, which, under its 






protection, she suspends horizontally, and not like 
the combs in a bee-hive, in a perpendicular position. 
The suspension of which we speak is also light and 
elegant, compared with the more heavy union of the 
hive-bees’ combs. It is in fact a hanging floor, 
immoveably secured by rods of similar materials 
with the roof, but rather stronger. From twelve to 
thirty of these rods, about an inch or less in length, 
and a quarter of an inch in diameter, are constructed

for the suspension of the terrace. They are elegant 
in form, being made gradually narrower towards the 
middle, and widening at each end, in order, no doubt, 
to render their hold the stronger. 

The terrace itself is circular, and composed of an 
immense number of cells, formed of the paper al- 
ready described, and of almost the same size and 
form as those of a honey-comb, each being a perfect 
hexagon, mathematically exact, and every hair’s 
breadth of the space completely filled. These cells, 
however, are never used as honey-pots by wasps, as 
they are by bees ; for wasps make no honey, and 
the cells are wholly appropriated to the rearing of 
their young. Like other hymenopterous insects, the 
grubs are placed with their heads downwards; and 
the openings of the cells are also downwards : while 





their united bottoms form a nearly uniform level 
upon which the inhabitants of the nest may walk. 
We have seen, in describing 1 the economy of the 
carder-bee, that when a young bee had escaped from 
its cradle-cell, and so rendered it empty, that cell was 
subsequently appropriated to the storing of honey. 
But in the case of wasps, a cell thus evacuated is 
immediately cleaned out and repaired for the recep- 
tion of another grub — an egg being laid in it by a 
female wasp as soon as it is ready. 

When the foundress wasp has completed a certain 
number of cells, and deposited eggs in them, she 
soon intermits her building operations, in order to 
procure food for the young grubs, which now require 
all her care. In a few weeks these become perfect 
wasps, and lend their assistance in the extension of 
the edifice ; enlarging the original coping of the 
foundress by side walls, and forming another plat- 
form of cells, suspended to the first by columns, as 
that had been suspended to the ceiling. 

In this manner several platforms of combs are 
constructed, the outer walls being extended at the 
same time; and, by the end of the summer, there is 
generally from twelve to fifteen platforms of cells. 
Each contains about 10G0 cells — forty-nine being' 
contained in an inch and a half square, and, of course, 
making the enormous number of about 1G,000 cells 
in one colony. Reaumur, upon these data, calculates 
that one vespiary may produce every year more than 
30,000 wasps, reckoning only 10,000 cells, and each 
serving successively for the cradle of three genera- 
tions. But, although the whole structure is built at 
the expense of so much labour and ingenuity, it has 
scarcely been finished before the winter sets in, when 
it becomes nearly useless, and serves only for the 
abode of a few benumbed females, who abandon it 
on the approach of spring, and never return ; for 






wasps do not, like mason-bees, ever make use of the 
same nest for more than one season. 

Both Reaumur and the younger Huber studied 
the proceedings of the common wasp in the manner 
which has been so successful in observing bees — by 
means of glazed hives, and other contrivances. In 
this, these naturalists were greatly aided by the ex- 
treme affection of wasps for their young; for though 
their nest is carried off, or even cut in various direc- 
tions, and exposed to the light, they never desert it, 
nor relax their attention to their progeny. When a 
wasp’s nest is removed from its natural situation, and 
covered with a glass hive, the first operation of the 
inhabitants is to repair the injuries it has suffered. 
They carry off with surprising activity all the earth 
or other matters which have fallen by accident into 
the nest ; and when they have got it thoroughly 
cleared of everything extraneous, they begin to se- 
cure it from further derangement, by fixing it to the 
glass with papyraceous columns, similar to those 
which we have already described. The breaches 
which the nest may have suffered are then repaired, 
and the thickness of the walls is augmented, with 
the design, perhaps, of more effectually excluding 
the light. 

The nest of the hornet is nearly the same in struc- 
ture with that of the wasp ; but the materials are 
considerably coarser, and the columns to which the 
platforms of cells are suspended are larger and 
stronger, the middle one being twice as thick as any 
of the others. The hornet, also, does not build 
under ground, but in the cavities of trees, or in 
the thatch or under the eaves of barns. Reaumur 
once found upon a wall a hornet’s nest which had 
not been long begun, and had it transferred to the 
outside of his study window; but in consequence. 







as he imagined, of the absence of the foundress 
hornet at the time it was removed, he could not get 
the other five hornets, of which the colony consisted, 
either to add to the building or repair the damages 
which it had sustained. 




Hornet's Nest in its Jirst stage. 



M. Reaumur differs from our English naturalists, 
White, Kirby, and Spence, with respect to the ma- 
terials employed by the hornet for building. The 
latter say that it employs decayed wood ; the former, 
that it uses the bark of the ash-tree, but takes less 
pains to split it into fine fibres than wasps do ; not, 
however, because it is destitute of skill ; for in con- 
structing the suspensory columns of the platforms, a 
paste is prepared little inferior to that made by wasps. 
We cannot, from our own observations, decide which 





of the above statements is correct, as we have only 
once seen a hornet procuring' materials, at Compton- 
Bassett, in Wiltshire ; and in that case it g’nawecl the 
inner bark of an elm which had been felled for seve- 
ral months, and was, consequently, dry and tough. 
Such materials as this would account for the common 
yellowish-brown colour of a hornet’s nest*. 

When hornets make choice of a tree for their do- 
micile, they select one which is in a state of decay, 
and already partly hollowed : but they possess the 
means, in their sharp and strong mandibles, of ex- 
tending the excavation to suit their purposes ; and 
Reaumur frequently witnessed their operations in 
mining into a decayed tree, and carrying off* what 
they had gnawed. He observed, also, that in such 
cases they did not make use of the large hole of the 
tree for an entrance, but went to the- trouble of die;- 
ging a gallery, sufficient for the passage of the largest 
hornet in the nest, through the living and undecayed 
portion of the tree. As this is perforated in a wind- 
ing direction, it is no doubt intended for the purpose 
of protecting the nest from the intrusion of depre- 
dators, who could more easily effect an entrance if 
there were not such a tortuous Avay to pass through. 

One of the most remarkable of our native social- 
wasps is the Vespa britannica , or tree-wasp, which is 
not uncommon in the northern, but is seldom to be 
met with in the southern parts of the island. Instead 
of burrowing in the ground like the common wasp 
( Vespa vulgaris ), or in the hollows of trees like the 
hornet ( Vespa crabro ), it boldly swings its nest from 
the extremity of a branch, where it exhibits some 
resemblance, in size and colour, to a Welsh wig, 
hung out to dry. We have seen more than one of 
these nests on the some tree, at Catrine, in Ayrshire, 

* J. R. 







and at Wemyss Bay, in Renfrewshire. The tree 
which the Britannic wasp prefers is the silver fir, 
whose broad fiat branch serves as a protection to the 
suspended nest both from the sun and the rain. The 
materials and structure are nearly the same as those 
employed by the common wasp, and which we have 
already described*. 

A singular nest of a species of wasp is figured by 
Reaumur, but is apparently rare in this country, as 
Kirby and Spence mention only a single nest of similar 
construction, found in a garden at East-Dale. This 
nest is of a flattened globular figure, and composed 
of a great number of envelopes, so as to assume a 
considerable resemblance to a half-expanded Provence 
rose. The British specimen mentioned by Kirby and 
Spence had only one platform of cells ; Reaumur’s 
had two ; but there was a large vacant space, which 
would probably have been filled with cells, had the 
nest not been taken away as a specimen. The whole

nest was not much larger than a rose, and was com- 
posed of paper exactly similar to that employed by 
the common ground- wasp. 

There is another species of social-wasp (Epipone 
nidulans, Latr.) meriting attention from the singu- 
lar construction of its nest. It forms one or more 
terraces of cells, similar to those of the common wasp, 
but without the protection of an outer wall, and quite 
exposed to the weather. Swammerdam found a nest 
of this description attached to the stem of a nettle. 
Reaumur says they are sometimes attached to the 
branch of a thorn or other shrub, or to stalks of grass ; 
— peculiarities which prove that there are several 
species of these wasps. 

The most remarkable circumstance in the arclii- 

» 




PFasp’f Cells attached to a branch* 








tecture of this species of vespiary is, that it is 
not horizontal, like those formerly described, but 
nearly vertical. The reason appears to be, that 
if it had been horizontal, the cells must have 
been frequently filled with rain ; whereas, in the 
position in which it is placed, the rain runs off 
without lodging. It is, besides, invariably placed 
so as to face the north or the east, and conse- 
quently is less exposed to rains, which most fre- 
quently come with southerly or westerly winds. It 
is another remarkable peculiarity, that unlike the nests 
of other wasps, it is covered with a shining coat of 
varnish, to prevent moisture from soaking into the 
texture of the wasp’s paper. The laying on this 
varnish, indeed, forms a considerable portion of the 
labour of the colony, and individuals may be seen 
employed for hours together spreading it on with 
their tongues. 

Few circumstances are more striking with regard 
to insects, as Kirby and Spence justly remark, than 
the great and incessant labour which maternal 
affection for their progeny leads them to undergo. 
Some of these exertions are so disproportionate to 
the size of the insect, that nothing short of ocular 
conviction could attribute them to such an agent. A 
wild bee, or a wasp, for instance, as we have seen, 
will dig a hole in a hard bank of earth some inches 
deep, and five or six times its own size, labouring un- 
remittingly at this arduous task for several days in 
succession, and scarcely allowing itself a moment for 
eating or repose. It will then occupy as much time 
in searching for a store of food ; and no sooner is 
this finished, than it will set about repeating the pro- 
cess, and before it dies, will have completed five or 
six similar cells, or even more. 

We shall have occasion more particularly to dwell 







upon the geometrical arrangement of the cells, both 
of the wasp and the social bee, in our description 
of those interesting operations, which have long at- 
tracted the notice, and commanded the admiration, 
of mathematicians and naturalists. A few observa- 
tions may here be properly bestowed upon the ma- 
terial with which the wasp-family construct the in- 
terior of their nests. 

The wasp is a paper-maker, and a most perfect 
and intelligent one. While mankind were arriving, 
by slow degrees, at the art of fabricating this valu- 
able substance, the wasp was making it before their 
eyes, by very much the same process as that by 
which human hands now manufacture it with the 
best aid of chemistry and machinery. While some 
nations carved their records on wood, and stone, and 
brass, and leaden tablets, — others, more advanced, 
wrote with a style on wax, — others employed the inner 
bark of trees, and others the skins of animals rudely 
prepared, — the wasp was manufacturing a firm and 
durable paper. Even when the papyrus was rendered 
more fit, by a process of art, for the transmission of 
ideas in writing, the wasp was a better artisan than 
the Egyptians ; for the early attempts at paper- 
making were so rude, that the substance produced 
Avas almost useless, from being extremely friable. 
The paper of the papyrus was formed of the leaves 
of the plant, dried, pressed, and polished; the wasp 
alone knew how to reduce vegetable fibres to a 
pulp, and then unite them by a size or glue, spread- 
ing the substance out into a smooth and delicate 
leaf. This is exactly the process of paper-making. 
It would seem that the wasp knows, as the modern 
paper-makers now know, that the fibres of rags, 
whether linen or cotton, are not the only materials 
that can be used in the formation of paper ; she em- 
ploys other vegetable matters, converting them into 

i 







a proper consistency by her assiduous exertions. In 
some respects she is more skilful even than our 
paper-makers, for she takes care to retain her fibres 
of sufficient length, by which she renders her paper 
as strong as she requires. Many manufacturers of 
the present day cut their material into small bits, and 
thus produce a rotten article. One great distinction 
between good and bad paper is its toughness ; and 
this difference is invariably produced by the fibre of 
which it is composed being long, and therefore tough ; 
or short, and therefore friable. 

The wasp has been labouring at her manufacture 
of paper, from her first creation, with precisely the 
same instruments and the same materials ; and her 
success has been unvarying. Her machinery is 
very simple, and therefore it is never out of order. 
She learns nothing, and she forgets nothing. Men, 
from time to time, lose their excellence in particular 
arts, and they are slow in finding out real improve- 
ments. Such improvements are often the effect of ac- 
cident. Paper is now manufactured very extensively 
by machinery, in all its stages ; and thus, instead of 
a single sheet being made by hand, a stream of paper 
is poured out, which would form a roll large enough 
to extend round the globe, if such a length were de- 
sirable. The inventors of this machinery, Messrs. 
Fourdrinier, it is said, spent the enormous sum 
of 40,000/. in vain attempts to render the machine 
capable of determining with precision the width of 
the roll ; and, at last, accomplished their object, 
at the suggestion of a bystander, by a strap re- 
volving upon an axis, at a cost of three shillings 
and sixpence. Such is the difference between the 
workings of human knowledge and experience, and 
those of animal instinct. We proceed slowly and in 
the dark — but our course is not bounded by a nar- 
row line, for it seems difficult to say what is the per- 







fection of any art; animals go clearly to a given 
point — but they can go no further. We may, how- 
ever, learn something from their perfect knowledge 
of what is within their range. It is not improbable 
that if man had attended in an earlier state of society 
to the labours of wasps, he would have sooner known 
how to make paper. We are still behind in our 
arts and sciences, because we have not always been 
observers. If we had watched the operations of in- 
sects, and the structure of animals in general, with 
more care, we might have been far advanced in the 
knowledge of many arts, which are yet in their in- 
fancy, for nature has given us abundance of patterns. 
We have learnt to perfect some instruments of sound, 
by examining the structure of the human ear ; and 
the mechanism of an eye has suggested some valu- 
able improvements in achromatic glasses. 



Reaumur has given a very interesting account of the 
wasps of Cayenne, which hang their nests in trees*. 
Like the bird of Africa called the Loxia, they fabricate 
a perfect house, capable of containing many hundreds 
of their community, and suspend it on high out of 
the reach of attack. But the Cayenne wasp is a 
more expert artist than the bird. He is a card- 
maker ; — and travellers of veracity agree that the 
card with which he forms the exterior covering of his 
abode is so smooth, so strong, so uniform in its 
texture, and so white, that the most skilful manu- 
facturer of this substance might be proud of the 
work. 

! The nest of the card-making wasp is impervious 
to water. It hangs upon the branch of a tree, as 
represented in the engraving ; and those rain-drops

which penetrate through the leaves never rest upon 
its hard and polished surface. A small opening for 
the entrance of the insects terminates its funnel- 
shaped bottom. It is impossible to unite more per- 
fectly the qualities of lightness and strength.

Part of a honeycomb, and, bees at worli. 

Although the hive-bee (Apis mdlijica ) has engaged 
the attention of the curious from the earliest ages, 
recent discoveries prove that we are yet only begin- 
ning to arrive at a correct knowledge of its wonderful 
proceedings. Pliny informs us that Aristomachus, of 
Soles, in Cilicia, devoted fifty-eight years to the 
study ; and that Philiscus the Thracian spent his 
whole life in forests for the purpose of observing 
them. But in consequence (as we may naturally 
infer) of the imperfect methods of research, as- 





suming that what they did discover was known to 
Aristotle, Columella, and Pliny, we are justified in 
pronouncing the statements of these philosophers, as 
well as the embellished poetical pictures of Virgil, to 
be nothing more than conjecture, almost in every par- 
ticular erroneous. It was not indeed till 1712, when 
glass hives were invented by Maraldi, a mathema- 
tician of Nice, that w r hat we may call the in-door 
proceedings of bees could be observed. This im- 
portant invention was soon afterwards taken advan- 
tage of by M. Reaumur, who laid the foundation of 
the more recent discoveries of John Hunter, Schi- 
rach, and the Hubers. The admirable architecture 
which bees exhibit in their miniature cities has, by 
these and other naturalists, been investigated with 
great care and accuracy. We shall endeavour to 
give as full an account of their wonderful structures 
as our limits will allow. In this we shall chiefly 
follow M. Huber, the elder, whose researches appear 
almost miraculous when we consider that he was 
blind. 

At the early age of seventeen this remarkable man 
lost his sight by gutta serejia, “ the drop serene” of 
our own Milton. But, though cutoff from the sight of 
Nature’s works, he dedicated himself to their study. 
He saw them through the eyes of the admirable 
woman whom he married ; his philosophical reason- 
ings pointed out to her all that he wanted to ascer- 
tain ; and as she reported to him from time to time 
the results of his ingenious experiments, he was en- 
abled to complete, by diligent investigation, one 
of the most accurate and satisfactory accounts of 
the habits of bees which has ever been produced. 
This venerable naturalist is, we believe, still alive. 

It had long been known that the bees of a hive 
consist of three sorts, which were ascertained by 






M. Reaumur to be distinguished as workers or 
neuters, constituting the bulk of the population ; 
drones or males, the least numerous class ; and a sin- 
gle female, the queen and mother of the colony. Schi- 
rach subsequently discovered the very extraordinary 
fact, which Huber and others have proved beyond 
doubt, that when a hive is accidentally deprived of a 
queen, the grub of a worker can be and is fed in 
a particular manner, so as to become a queen and 
supply the loss*. But another discovery of M. Hu- 
ber is of more importance to the subject of archi- 
tecture now before us. By minute research he ascer- 
tained, that the workers, which had been considered 
by former naturalists to be all alike, are divided 
into two important classes, nurse-bees and wax- 
makers. 

The nurse-bees are rather smaller than the wax- 
workers, and even when gorged with honey their 
belly does not, as in the others, appear distended. 
Their business is to collect honey, and impart it to 
their companions ; to feed and take care of the young 
grubs, and to complete the combs and cells which 
have been founded by the others ; but they are not 
charged with provisioning the hive. 

The wax-workers on the other hand are not only 
a little larger, but their stomach, when gorged with 
honey, is capable of considerable distension, as M. 
Huber proved by repeated experiments. He also 
ascertained that neither of the species can alone 
fulfil all the functions shared among the workers of 
a hive. He painted those of each class with different 
colours, in order to study their proceedings, and their 
labours were not interchanged. In another expert- 

* It is right to remark that Huish and others have suggested 
that the grubs thus royalized may originally be misplaced queens ; 
yet this admission is not necessary, since Madlle. Jurine has 
proved, by dissection, the workers to be imperfect females. 







ment, after supplying a hive deprived of a queen with 
brood and pollen, he saw the nurse-bees quickly oc- 
cupied in the nutrition of the grubs, while those of 
the wax-working class neglected them. When hives 
are full of combs, the wax-workers disgorge their 
honey into the ordinary magazines, making no wax : 
but if they want a reservoir for its reception, and if 
their queen does not find cells ready made wherein 
to lay her eggs, they retain the honey in the stomach, 
and in twenty-four hours they produce wax. Then 
the labour of constructing combs begins. 

It might perhaps be supposed that, when the country 
does not afford honey, the wax-workers consume 
the provision stored up in the hive. But they are 
not permitted to touch it. A portion of honey is 
carefully preserved, and the cells containing it are 
protected by a waxen covering, which is never re- 
moved except in case of extreme necessity, and 
when honey is not to be otherwise procured. The 
cells are at no time opened during summer ; 
other reservoirs, always exposed, contribute to the 
daily use of the community ; each bee, however, sup- 
plying itself from them with nothing but what is 
required for present wants. Wax- workers appear 

with large bellies at the entrance of their hive, only 
when the country affords a copious collection of 
honey. From this it may be concluded, that the 
production of the waxy matter depends on a concur- 
rence of circumstances not invariably subsisting. 
Nurse-bees also produce wax, but in a very inferior 
quantity to what is elaborated by the real wax-workers. 
Another characteristic whereby an attentive observer 
can determine the moment of bees collecting sufficient 
honey to produce wax, is the strong odour of both 
these substances from the hive, which is not equally 
intense at any other time. From such data, it was 
easy for M. Huber to discover whether the bees 







worked in wax in his own hives, and in those of the 
other cultivators of the district. 

There is still another sort of bees, first observed by 
Huber in 1809, which appear to be only casual in- 
mates of the hive, and which are driven forth to 
starve, or are killed in conflict. They closely resem- 
ble the ordinary workers, but are less hairy, and of 
a much darker colour. These have been called 
black bees , and are supposed by Huber to be defec- 
tive bees * ; but Kirby and Spence conjecture that 
they are toil-worn superannuated workers, of no 
farther use, and are therefore sacrificed, because bur- 
densome to a community which tolerates no un- 
necessary inmates. The very great numbers of 
black bees, however, which sometimes appear, does 
not well accord with such an opinion. The subject 
remains, therefore, still in uncertainty. 



Preparation of Wax. 

In order to build the beautiful combs, which every 
one must have repeatedly seen and admired, it is 
indispensable that the architect-bees should be pro- 
vided with the materials — with the wax, in short, of 
which they are principally formed. Before we follow 
them, therefore, to the operation of building, it may 
be necessary to inquire how the wax itself is pro- 
cured. Here the discoveries of recent inquirers have 
been little less singular and unexpected than in other 
departments of the history of these extraordinary in- 
sects. Now that it has been proved that wax is 
secreted by bees, it is not a little amusing to read 
the accounts given by our elder naturalists, of 
its being collected from flowers. Our countryman, 



* Huber on Bees, p. 338, 







Thorley *, appears to have been the first who suspected 
the true origin of wax, and Wildman (1769) seems 
also to have been aware of it ; but Reaumur, and 
particularly Bonnet, though both of them in general 
shrewd and accurate observers, were partially de- 
ceived by appearances. 

The bees, we are erroneously told, search for wax 
“ upon all sorts of trees and plants, but especially 
the rocket, the single poppy, and in general all kinds 
of flowers. They amass it with their hair, with 
which their whole body is invested. It is something 
pleasant to see them roll in the yellow dust which 
falls from the chives to the bottom of the flowers, 
and then return covered with the same grains ; but 
their best method of gathering the wax, especially 
when it is not very plentiful, is to carry away all the 
little particles of it with their jaws and fore feet, to 
press the wax upon them into little pellets, and slide 
them, one at a time, with their middle feet, into a 
socket or cavity, that opens at their hinder feet, and 
serves to keep the burden fixed and steady till they 
return home. They are sometimes exposed to incon- 
veniences in this work by the motion of the air, and 
the delicate texture of the flowers which bend under 
their feet, and hinder them from packing up their 
booty, on which occasions they fix themselves in some 
steady place, where they press the wax into a mass, 
and wind it round their legs, making frequent re- 
turns to the flowers; and when they have stocked 
themselves with a sufficient quantity, they imme- 
diately repair to their habitation. Two men, in the 
compass of a whole day, could not amass so much 
as two little balls of wax ; and yet they are no more 
than the common burthen of a single bee, and the 
produce of one journey. Those who are employed

in collecting* the wax from flowers are assisted by 
their companions, who attend them at the door of 
the hive, ease them of their load at their arrival, 
brush their feet, and shake out the two balls of wax ; 
upon which the others return to the fields to gather 
new treasure, whilst those who disburthened them 
convey their charge to the magazine. But some bees, 
again, when they have brought their load home, 
carry it themselves to the lodge, and there deliver it, 
laying hold of one end by their hinder feet, and with 
their middle feet sliding it out of the cavity that con- 
tained it ; but this is evidently a work of supereroga- 
tion which they are not obliged to perform. The 
packets of wax continue a few moments in the lodge, 
till a set of officers come, who are charged with a 
third commission, which is to knead this wax with 
their feet, and spread it out into different sheets, laid 
one above another. This is the unwrought wax, 
which is easily distinguished to be the produce of 
different flowers, by the variety of colours that appear 
i on each sheet. When they afterwards come to work, 
they knead it over again, they purify and whiten, 
and then reduce it to a uniform colour. They use 
this wax with a wonderful frugality ; for it is easy to 
observe that the whole family is conducted by pm 
dence, and all their actions regulated by good go- 
vernment. Everything is granted to necessity, but 
nothing to superfluity ; not the least grain of wax is 
neglected, and if they waste it, they are frequently 
obliged to provide more ; at those very times when 
they want to get their provision of honey, they take 
off the wax that closed the cells, and carry it to the 
magazine 

Reaumur hesitated in believing that this was a 

* Pluche, Spectacle de la Nature, vol. i. 




correct view of the subject, from observing the great 
difference between wax and pollen ; but he was in- 
clined to think the pollen might be swallowed, par- 
tially digested, and disgorged in the form of a 
kind of paste. Schirach also mentions, that it was 
remarked by a certain Lusatian, that wax comes 
from the rings of the body, because, on withdrawing 
a bee while it is at work, and extending its body, the 
wax may be seen there in the form of scales. 

The celebrated John Hunter shrewdly remarked 
that the pellets of pollen seen on the thighs of bees 
are of different colours on different bees, while the 
shade of the new-made comb is always uniform ; and 
therefore he concluded that pollen was not the origin 
of wax. Pollen also, he observed, is collected with 
greater avidity for old hives, where the comb is com- 
plete, than for those where it is only begun, which 
would hardly be the case were it the material of 
wax. He found that when the weather was cold 
and wet in June, so that a young swarm was pre- 
vented from going abroad, as much comb was con- 
structed as had been made in an equal time when the 
weather was favourable and fine. 

The pellets of pbllen on the thighs being thence 
proved not to be wax, he came to the conclu- 
sion that it was an external secretion originating 
between the plates of the belly. When he first ob- 
served this, he felt not a little embarrassed to explain 
the phenomenon, and doubted whether new plates 
were forming, or whether bees cast the old ones as 
lobsters do their shells. By melting the scales, he 
ascertained at least that they were wax ; and his opinion 
was confirmed by the fact, that the scales are only to 
be found during the season when the combs are con- 
structed. But he did not succeed in completing the 
discovery by observing the bees actually detach the 







scales, though he conjectured they might be taken 
up by others, if they were once shaken out from 
between the rings 

We need not be so much surprised at mistakes 
committed upon this subject, when we recollect that 
honey itself was believed by the ancients to be an 
emanation of the air — a dew that descended upon 
flowers, as if it had a limited commission to fall 
only on them. The exposure and correction of error 
is one of the first steps to genuine knowledge ; and 
when we are aware of the stumbling-blocks which 
have interrupted the progress of others, we can 
always travel more securely in the way of truth. 

That wax is secreted, is proved both by the wax 
pouches within the rings of the abdomen, and by 
actual experiment f. Huber and others fed bees 
entirely upon honey or sugar, and, notwithstanding, 
wax was produced and combs formed as if they had 
been at liberty to select their food. “ When bees 
were confined,” says M. Huber, “ for the purpose of 
discovering whether honey was sufficient for the 
production of wax, they supported their captivity 
patiently, and showed uncommon perseverance in 
rebuilding their combs as we removed them. 
Our experiments required the presence of grubs ; 
honey and water had to be provided ; the bees 
were to be supplied with combs containing brood, 
and at the same time it was necessary to con- 
fine them, that they might not seek pollen abroad. 
Having a swarm by chance, which had become use- 
less from sterility of the queen, we devoted it for 
our investigation in one of my leaf hives, which was 
glazed on both sides. We removed the queen, and 
substituted combs containing eggs and young grubs, 
but no cell with farina ; even the smallest particle of

K 







the substance which John Hunter conjectured to be 
the basis of the nutriment of the young, was taken 
away. 

“ Nothing remarkable occurred during the first and 
second day : the bees brooded over the young, and 
seemed to take an interest in them ; but at sunset, 
on the third, a loud noise was heard in the hive. 
Impatient to discover the reason, we opened a shut- 
ter, and saw all in confusion; the brood was aban- 
doned ; the workers ran in disorder over the combs ; 
thousands rushed towards the lower part of the hive ; 
and those about the entrance gnawed at its grating. 
Their design was not equivocal ; they wished to quit 
their prison. Some imperious necessity evidently 
obliged them to seek elsewhere what they could not 
find in the hive ; and apprehensive that they might 
perish if I restrained them longer from yielding to 
their instinct, I set them at liberty. The whole 
swarm escaped ; but the hour being unfavourable 
for their collections, they flew around the hive, and 
did not depart far from it. Increasing darkness and 
the coolness of the air compelled them very soon to 
return. Probably these circumstances calmed their 
agitation ; for we observed them peaceably remounting 
their combs ; order seemed re-established, and we 
took advantage of this moment to close the hive. 

“ Next day, the 19th of July, we saw the rudiments 
of two royal cells, which the bees had formed on one 
of the brood combs. This evening, at the same hour 
as on the preceding, we again heard a loud buzzing 
in the closed hive ; agitation and disorder rose to the 
highest degree, and we were again obliged to let the 
swarm escape. The bees did not remain long absent 
from their habitation ; they quieted and returned as 
before. We remarked on the 20th, that the royal 
cells had not been continued, as would have been the 
case in the ordinary state of things. A great tumult 







took place in the evening ; the bees appeared to be in 
a delirium ; we set them at liberty, and order was 
restored on their return. Their captivity having 
endured five days, we thought it needless to protract 
it farther ; besides, we were desirous of knowing, 
whether the brood was in a suitable condition, and if 
it had made the usual progress ; and we wished also 
to try to discover what might be the cause of the 
periodical agitation of the bees. M. Burnens, (the 
assistant of Huber) having exposed the two brood 
combs, the royal cells were immediately recognized ; 
but it was obvious that they had not been enlarged. 
Why should they? Neither eggs, grubs, nor that 
kind of paste peculiar to the individuals of their 
species were there ! The other cells were vacant like- 
wise ; no brood, not an atom of paste was in them. 
Thus, the worms had died of hunger. Had we pre- 
cluded the bees from all means of sustenance by 
removing the farina? To decide this point, it was 
necessary to confide other brood to the care of the 
same insects, now giving them abundance of pollen. 
They had not been enabled to make any collections 
while we examined their combs. On this occasion 
they escaped in an apartment where the windows 
were shut ; and after substituting young worms for 
those they had allowed to perish, we returned them 
to their prison. Next day we remarked that they had 
resumed courage ; they had consolidated the combs, 
and remained on the brood. They were then provided 
with fragments of combs, where other workers had 
stored up farina; and to be able to observe what they 
did with it, we took this substance from some of their 
cells, and spread it on the board of the hive. The 
bees soon discovered both the farina in the combs 
and what we had exposed to them. They crowded to 
the cells, and also descending to the bottom of the 
hives, took the pollen grain by grain in their teeth, 





and conveyed it to their mouths. Those that had 
eaten it most greedily, mounted the combs before the 
rest, and stopping on the cells of the young worms, 
inserted their heads, and remained there for a certain 
time. M. Burnens opened one of the divisions of 
the hive gently, and powdered the workers, for the 
purpose of recognizing them when they should 
ascend the combs. He observed them during several 
hours, and by this means ascertained that they took 
so great a quantity of pollen only to impart it to 
their young. Then withdrawing the portions of 
comb which had been placed by us on the board of 
the hive, we saw that the pollen had been sensibly 
diminished in quantity. They were returned to 
the bees, to augment their provision still farther, for 
the purpose of extending the experiment. The 
royal, as well as several common cells were soon 
closed ; and, on opening the hive, all the worms were 
found to have prospered. Some still had their food 
before them ; the cells of others that had spun were 
shut with a waxen covering. 

“ We witnessed these facts repeatedly, and always 
with equal interest. They so decisively prove the 
regard of the bees towards the grubs which they are 
entrusted with rearing, that we shall not seek for 
any other explanation of their conduct. Another 
fact, no less extraordinary, and much more difficult 
to be accounted for, was exhibited by bees constrained 
to work in wax, several times successively, from the 
syrup of sugar. Towards the close of the experiment 
they ceased to feed the young, though in the begin- 
ning these had received the usual attention. They 
even frequently dragged them from their cells, and 
carried them out of the hive 

Mr. Wiston, of Germantown, in the United States, 



* Huber on Bees. 






mentions a fact conclusive on this subject. “ I had,” 
says he, “ a late swarm last summer, which, in con- 
sequence of the drought, filled only one box with 
honey. As it was late in the season, and the food 
collected would not enable the bees to subsist for 
the winter, I shut up the hive, and gave them half 
a pint of honey every day. They immediately set to 
work, filled the empty cells, and then constructed 
new cells enough to fill another box, in which they 
deposited the remainder of the honey.” 

A more interesting proof is thus related by the 
same gentleman. “ In the summer of 1824, 1 traced 
some wild bees, which had been feeding on the 
flowers in my meadow, to their home in the woods, 
and which I found in the body of an oak tree, exactly 
fifty feet above the ground. Having caused the 
entrance to the hive to be closed by an expert climber, 
the limbs were separated in detail, until the trunk 
alone was left standing. To the upper extremity of 
this, a tackle-fall was attached, so as to connect it 
with an adjacent tree, and, a saw being applied be- 
low, the naked trunk was cut through. When the 
immense weight was lowered nearly to the earth, the 
ropes broke, and the mass fell with a violent crash. 
The part of the tree which contained the hive, sepa- 
rated by the saw, was conveyed to my garden, and 
placed in a vertical position. On being released, the 
bees issued out by thousands, and though alarmed, 
soon became reconciled to the change of situation. 
By removing a part of the top of the block, the inte- 
rior of the hive was exposed to view, and the comb 
itself, nearly six feet in height, was observed to have 
fallen down two feet below the roof of the cavity. 
To repair the damage was the first object of the 
labourers ; in doing which, a large part of their store 
of honey was expended, because it was at too late a 
season to obtain materials from abroad. In the fol- 





lowing 1 February, these industrious, but unfortunate 
insects, issuing in a confused manner from the hive, 
fell dead in thousands, around its entrance, the 
victims of a poverty created by their efforts to repair 
the ruins of their habitation*.’ ’ 

In another experiment, M. Huber confined a 
swarm so that they had access to nothing beside 
honey, and five times successively removed the 
combs with the precaution of preventing the escape 
of the bees from the apartment. On each occasion 
they produced new combs, which puts it beyond dis- 
pute that honey is sufficient to effect the secretion of 
wax without the aid of pollen. Instead of supplying 
the bees with honey, they were subsequently fed, 
exclusively, on pollen and fruit ; but though they 
were kept in captivity for eight days under a bell- 
glass, with a comb containing nothing but farina, 
they neither made wax, nor was any secreted under the 
rings. In another series of experiments, in which bees 
were fed with different sorts of sugar, it was found 
that nearly one-sixth of the sugar was converted into 
wax, dark coloured sugar yielding more than double 
the quantity of refined sugar. 

It may not be out of place to subjoin the few 
anatomical and physiological facts which have been 
ascertained by Huber, Madlle. J urine, and Latreille. 

The first stomach of the worker-bee, according to 
Latreillet, is appropriated to the reception of honey, 
but this is never found in the second stomach, which 
is surrounded with muscular rings, and from one 
end to the other very much resembles a cask covered 
with hoops. It is within these rings that the wax is 
produced, but the secreting vessels for this purpose 
have hitherto escaped the researches of the acutest

f Latreille, Mem. Acad, des Sciences, 1821. 






naturalists. Huber, however, plausibly enough conjec- 
tures that they are contained in the internal linin O' of 
the wax pockets, which consists of a cellular substance 
reticulated with hexagons. The wax pockets them- 
selves, which are concealed by the over-lapping of the 
rings, may be seen by pressing the abdomen of a 
worker-bee so as to lengthen it, and separate the rings 
further from each other. When this has been done, 
there may be seen on each of the four intermediate 
hoops of the belly, and separated by what may be 
called the keel ( carina ), two whitish-coloured 
pouches, of a soft texture, and in the form of a 
trapezium. Within, the little scales or plates of wax

are produced from time to time, and are removed and 
employed as we shall presently see. We may remark 
that it is chiefly the wax-workers which produce the 
wax, for though the nurse-bees are furnished with 
wax pockets, they secrete it only in very small quan- 
tities, while in the queen bee, and the males or drones, 
no pockets are discoverable. 







Abdomen of Queen Bee. 



“ All the scales,” says Huber, “are not alike in 
every bee, for a difference is perceptible in consist- 
ence, shape, and thickness ; some are so thin and 
transparent, as to require a magnifier to be recog- 
nised, or we have been able to discover nothing but 
spiculae similar to those of water freezing. Neither the 
spiculse nor the scales rest immediately on the mem- 
brane of the pocket, a slight liquid medium is inter- 
posed, serving to lubricate the joinings of the rings, 
or to render the extraction of the scales easier, as 
otherwise they might adhere too firmly to the sides 
of the pockets.” M. Huber has seen the scales so 
large as to project beyond the rings, being visible 
without stretching the segments, and of a whitish- 
yellow, from greater thickness lessening their trans- 
parency. These shades of difference in the scales of 
various bees, their enlarged dimensions, the fluid in- 
terposed beneath them, the correspondence between 
the scale, and the size and form of the pockets, seem 
to infer the oozing of this substance through the mem- 






branes whereon it is moulded. He was confirmed 
in this opinion by the escape of a transparent fluid, 
on piercing the membrane, whose internal surface 
seemed to be applied to the soft parts of the belly. 
This he found coagulated in cooling, when it re- 
sembled wax, and again liquefied on exposure to heat. 
The scales themselves, also, melted and coagulated 
like wax *. 

By chemical analysis, however, it appears that the 
wax of the rings is a more simple substance than that 
which composes the cells ; for the latter is soluble 
in ether, and in spirit of turpentine, while the former 
is insoluble in ether, and but partially soluble in spirit 
of turpentine. It should seem to follow, that if the 
substance found lying under the rings be really the 
elements of wax, it undergoes some subsequent pre- 
paration after it is detached ; and that the bees, in 
short, are capable of impregnating it with matter, 
imparting to it whiteness and ductility, whereas in its 
unprepared state it is only fusible. 

Propolis. 

Wax is not the only material employed by bees in 
their architecture. Beside this, they make use of a 
brown, odoriferous, resinous substance, called pro - 
jJolis t, more tenacious and extensible than wax, and 
well adapted for cementing and varnishing. It was 
strongly suspected by Reaumur, that the bees collect- 
ed the propolis from those trees which are known to 
produce a similar gummy resin, such as the poplar, 
the birch, and the willow ; but he was thrown into 
doubt by not being able to detect the bees in the 
act of procuring it, and by observing them to collect

it where none of those trees, nor any other of the 
same description, grew. His bees also refused to 
make use of bitumen, and other resinous substances, 
with which he supplied them, though Mr. Knight, as 
we shall afterwards see, was more successful *. 

Long before the time of Reaumur, however, Mouf- 
fet, in his Tnsectarum Theatrum, quotes Cordus for 
the opinion, that propolis is collected from the buds 
of trees, such as the poplar and birch ; and Reim 
says it is collected from the pine and firf. Huber 
at length set the question at rest ; and his experi- 
ments and observations are so interesting, that we 
shall give them in his own words : — • 

“ For many years,” says he, “I had fruitlessly en- 
deavoured to find them on trees producing an ana- 
logous substance, though multitudes had been seen 
returning; laden with it. 

“ In July, some branches of the wild poplar, which 
had been cut since spring, with very large buds, full 
of a reddish, viscous, odoriferous matter, were brought 
to me, and I planted them in vessels before hives, in 
the way of the bees going out to forage, so that they 
could not be insensible of their presence. Within a 
quarter of an hour, they were visited by a bee, which 
separating the sheath of a bud with its teeth, drew 
out threads of the viscous substance, and lodged a 
pellet of it in one of the baskets of its limbs : from 
another bud it collected another pellet for the oppo- 
site limb, and departed to the hive. A second bee 
took the place of the former in a few minutes, fol- 
lowing the same procedure. Young shoots of poplar, 
recently cut, did not seem to attract these insects, as 
their viscous matter had less consistence than the 
former |.

“ Different experiments proved the identity of this 
substance with propolis ; and now, having only to 
discover how the bees applied it to use, we peopled 
a hive, so prepared as to fulfil our views. The bees, 
building upwards, soon reached the glass above ; 
but, unable to quit their habitation, on account 
of rain, they were three weeks without bringing- 
home propolis. Their combs remained perfectly 
white until the beginning of July, when the state of 
the atmosphere became more favourable for our ob- 
servations. Serene warm weather engaged them to 
forage, and they returned from the fields laden with 
a resinous gum, resembling a transparent jelly, and 
having the colour and lustre of the garnet. It was 
easily distinguished from the farinaceous pellets then 
collected by other bees. The workers bearing the 
propolis ran over the clusters suspended from the 
roof of the hive, and rested on the rods supporting 
the combs, or sometimes stopped on the sides of their 
dwelling, in expectation of their companions coming 
to disencumber them of their burden. We actually 
saw two or three arrive, and carry the propolis from 
off the limbs of each with their teeth. The upper 
part of the hive exhibited the most animated spec- 
tacle : thither a multitude of bees resorted from all 
quarters, to engage in the predominant occupation 
of the collection, distribution, and application of the 
propolis. Some conveyed that of which they had 
unloaded the purveyors in their teeth, and deposited 
it in heaps ; others hastened, before its hardening, to 
spread it out like a varnish, or formed it into strings, 
proportioned to the interstices of the sides of the 
hive to be filled up. Nothing could be more diver- 
sified than the operations carried on.

propolis within the cells, were easily distinguished 
from the multitude of workers, by the direction of 
their heads towards the horizontal pane forming the 
roof of the hive, and on reaching it, they deposited 
their burden nearly in the middle of intervals sepa- 
rating the combs : then they conveyed the propolis 
to the real place of its destination. They suspended 
themselves by the claws of the hind legs to points of 
support, afforded by the viscosity of the propolis on 
the glass ; and, as it were, swinging themselves back- 
wards and forwards, brought the heap of this substance 
nearer to the cells at each impulse. Here the bees em- 
ployed their fore feet, which remained free, to sweep 
what the teeth had detached, and to unite the frag- 
ments scattered over the glass, which recovered all 
its transparency when the whole propolis was brought 
to the vicinity of the cells. 

“ After some of the bees had smoothed down and 
cleaned out the glazed cells, feeling the way with 
their antennae, one desisted, and having approached 
a heap of propolis, drew out a thread with its teeth. 
This being broken off, it was taken in the claws of the 
fore feet, and the bee, re-entering the cell, imme- 
diately placed it in the angle of two portions that 
had been smoothed, in which operation the fore feet 
and teeth were used alternately ; but probably proving 
too clumsy, the thread was reduced and polished ; 
and we admired the accuracy with which it was ad- 
justed when the work was completed. The insect 
did not stop here : returning to the cell, it prepared 
other parts of it to receive a second thread, for which 
we did not doubt that the heap would be resorted to. 
Contrary to our expectation, however, it availed 
itself of the portion of the thread cut off on the 
former occasion, arranged it in the appointed place, 
and gave it all the solidity and finish of which it was 
susceptible. Other bees concluded the work which 
the first had begun ; and the sides of the cells were 







speedily secured with threads of propolis, while some 
were also put on the orifices ; but we could not seize 
the moment when they were varnished, though it 
may be easily conceived how it is done * ” 

This is not the only use to w'hich bees apply the 
propolis. They are extremely solicitous to remove 
such insects or foreign bodies as happen to get ad- 
mission into the hive. When so light as not to 
exceed their powers, they first kill the insect with 
their stings, and then drag it out with their teeth. 
But it sometimes happens, as was first observed by 
Maraldi, and since by Reaumur and others, that an 
ill-fated snail creeps into the hive : this is no sooner 
perceived than it is attacked on all sides, and stung 
to death. But how are the bees to carry out so 
heavy a burthen? Such a labour would be in vain. 
To prevent the noxious smell which would arise from 
its putrefaction, they immediately embalm it, by co- 
vering every part of its body with propolis, through 
which no effluvia can escape. When a snail with a 
shell gets entrance, to dispose of it gives much less 
trouble and expense to the bees. As soon as it re- 
ceives the first wound from a sting, it naturally 
retires within its shell. In this case, the bees, instead 
of pasting it all over with propolis, content them- 
selves with gluing all round the margin of the shell, 
which is sufficient to render the animal for ever im- 
movably fixed. 

Mr. Knight, the learned and ingenious President of 
the Horticultural Society, discovered by accident an 
artificial substance, more attractive than any of the 
resins experimentally tried by Reaumur. Having 
caused the decorticated part of a tree to be covered 
with a cement, composed of bees’- wax and turpentine, 
he observed that this w'as frequented by hive-bees, 
wffio, finding it to be a very good propolis ready made,

detached it from the tree by their mandibles, and 
then, as usual, passed it from the first leg to the 
second, and so on. When one bee had thus collected 
its load, another often came behind and despoiled 
it of all it had collected ; a second and a third load 
were frequently lost in the same manner ; and yet 
the patient insect pursued its operations without 
manifesting any signs of anger *. Probably the 
latter circumstance, at which Mr. Knight seems to 
have been surprised, was nothing more than an instance 
of the division of labour so strikingly exemplified in 
every part of the economy of bees. 

It may not be out of place here to describe the 
apparatus with which the worker-bees are provided 
for the purpose of carrying the propolis as well as 
the pollen of flowers to the hive, and which has just 
been alluded to in the observations of Mr. Knight. 
The shin or middle portion of the hind pair of legs is 
actually formed into a triangular basket, admirably 
adapted to this design. The bottom of this basket

is composed of a smooth, shining, horn-like sub- 
stance, hollowed out in the substance of the limb, 
and surrounded with a margin of strong and thickly- 
set bristles. Whatever materials, therefore, may be 
placed by the bee in the interior of this basket, are 
secured from falling out by the bristles around it, 
whose elasticity will even allow the load to be heaped 
beyond their points without letting it fall. 

In the case of propolis, when the bee is loading 
her singular basket, she first kneads the piece she 
has detached with her mandibles, till it becomes 
somewhat dry and less adhesive, as otherwise it would 
stick to her limbs. This preliminary process some- 
times occupies nearly half an hour. She then passes 
it backwards by means of her feet to the cavity of her 
basket, giving it two or three pats to make it adhere; 
and when she adds a second portion to the first, she 
often finds it necessary to pat it still harder. When 
she has procured as much as the basket will conve- 
niently hold, she flies off with it to the hive. 

The Building of the Cells. 

The notion commonly entertained respecting glass 
hives is altogether erroneous. Those who are un- 
acquainted with bees imagine, that, by means of a 
glass hive, all their proceedings may be easily watched 
and recorded ; but it is to be remembered that bees 
are exceedingly averse to the intrusion of light, and 
their first operation in such cases is to close up every 
chink by which light can enter to disturb them, 
either by clustering together, or by a plaster com- 
posed of propolis. It consequently requires con- 
siderable management and ingenuity, even with the 
aid of a glass hive, to see them actually at work. 
M. Huber employed a hive with leaves, which opened 
in the manner of a book ; and for some purposes he 





used a glass box, inserted in the body of the hive, 
but easily brought into view by means of screws. 

But no invention hitherto contrived is sufficient to 
obviate every difficulty. The bees are so eager to 
afford mutual assistance, and for this purpose so 
many of them crowd together in rapid succession, 
that the operations of individuals can seldom be 
traced. Though this crowding, however, appears 
to an observer to be not a little confused, it is all 
regulated with admirable order, as has been ascer- 
tained by Reaumur and other distinguished natu- 
ralists. 

When bees begin to build the hive, they divide 
themselves into bands, one of which produces mate- 
rials for the structure; another works upon these, and 
forms them into a rough sketch of the dimensions and 
partitions of the cells. All this is completed by the 
second band, who examine and adjust the angles, re- 
move the superfluous wax, and give the work its ne- 
cessary perfection ; and a third band brings provi- 
sions to the labourers, who cannot leave their work. 
But no distribution of food is made to those whose 
charge, in collecting propolis and pollen, calls them 
to the field, because it is supposed they will hardly 
forget themselves ; neither is any allowance made to 
those who begin the architecture of the cells. Their 
province is very troublesome, because they are obliged 
to level and extend, as well as cut and adjust the wax 
to the dimensions required ; but then they soon ob- 
tain a dismission from this labour, and retire to the 
fields to regale themselves with food, and wear otf 
their fatigue with a more agreeable employment. 
Those who succeed them, draw their mouth, their 
feet, and the extremity of their body, several times 
over all the work, and never desist till the whole is 
polished and completed; and as they frequently need 
refreshments, and yet are not permitted to retire. 







there are waiters always attending 1 , who serve them 
with provisions when they require them. The labourer 
who has an appetite, bends down his trunk before the 
caterer, to intimate that he has an inclination to eat, 
upon which the other opens his bag of honey, and 
pours out a few drops ; these may be distinctly seen 
rolling through the whole of his trunk, which in- 
sensibly swells in every part the liquor flows through. 
When this little repast is over, the labourer returns to 
his work, and his body and feet repeat the same mo- 
tions as before*. 

Before they can commence building, however* 
when a colony or swarm migrates from the original 
hive to a new situation, it is necessary first to collect 
propolis, with which every chink and cranny in the 
place where they mean to build may be carefully 
stopped up ; and secondly that a quantity of wax be 
secreted by the wax-workers to form the requisite 
cells. The secretion of wax, it would appear, goes 
on best when the bees are in a state of repose ; and 
the wax-workers, accordingly, suspend themselves 
in the interior in an extended cluster, like a curtain 
which is composed of a series of intertwined festoons 
or garlands, crossing each other in all directions, — 
the uppermost bee maintaining its position by laying 
hold of the roof with its fore-legs, and the succeeding 
one by laying hold of the hind legs of the first. 

“ A person,” says Reaumur, “ mus't have been 
born devoid of curiosity not to take interest in the 
investigation of such wonderful proceedings.” Yet 
Reaumur himself seems not to have understood that 
the bees suspended themselves in this manner to 
secrete wax, but merely, as he imagined, to recruit 
themselves by rest for renewing their labours. The 
bees composing the festooned curtain dre individu- 
ally motionless ; but this curtain is, notwithstanding,

kept moving by the proceedings in the interior; for 
the nnrse-bees never form any portion of it, and 
continue their activity — a distinction with which 
Reaumur was unacquainted. 




Curtain of JFa.v-workers secreting JVax. 



Although there are many thousand labourers in a 
hive, they do not commence foundations for combs 






in several places at once, but wait till an individual 
bee has selected a site, and laid the foundation of a 
comb, which serves as a directing mark for all that 
are to follow. Were we not expressly told by so 
accurate an observer as Huber, we might hesitate to 
believe that bees, though united in what appears to 
be a harmonious monarchy, are strangers to sub- 
ordination, and subject to no discipline. Hence it 
is, that though many bees work on the same comb, 
they do not appear to be guided by any simultaneous 
impulse. The stimulus which moves them is suc- 
cessive. An individual bee commences each opera- 
tion, and several others successively apply themselves 
to accomplish the same purpose. Each bee appears, 
therefore, to act individually, either as directed by the 
bees preceding it, or by the state of advancement in 
which it finds the work it has to proceed with. If 
there be anything like unanimous consent, it is the 
inaction of several thousand workers while a single 
individual proceeds to determine and lay down the 
foundation of the first comb. Reaumur regrets, that, 
though he could by snatches detect a bee at work in 
founding cells or perfecting their structure, his ob- 
servations were generally interrupted by the crowding 
of other bees between him and the little builder. 
He was therefore compelled rather to infer the dif- 
ferent steps of their procedure from an examination 
of the cells when completed, than from actual ob- 
servation. The ingenuity of Huber, even under all 
the disadvantages of blindness, succeeded in tracing 
the minutest operations of the workers from the first 
waxen plate of the foundation. We think the narra- 
tive of the discoverer’s experiments, as given by him- 
self, will be more interesting than any abstract of it 
which we could furnish. 

“ Having taken a large bell-shaped glass receiver, 
we glued thin wooden slips to the arch at certain in- 



 



tervals, because the glass itself was too smooth to 
admit of the bees supporting themselves on it. A 
swarm, consisting of some thousand workers, several 
hundred males, and a fertile queen, was introduced, 
and they soon ascended to the top. Those first 
gaining the slips, fixed themselves there by the fore- 
feet ; others scrambling up the sides, joined them, 
by holding their legs with their own, and they thus 
formed a kind of chain, fastened by the two ends to 
the upper parts of the receiver, and served as ladders 
or a bridge to the workers enlarging their number. 
The latter were united in a cluster, hanging like an 
inverted pyramid from the top to the bottom of the hive. 

“ The country then affording little honey, we pro- 
vided the bees with syrup of sugar, in order to hasten 
their labour. They crowded to the edge of a vessel 
containing it ; and, having satisfied themselves, re- 
turned to the group. We were now struck with the 
absolute repose of this hive, contrasted with the usual 
agitation of bees. Meanwhile, the nurse-bees alone 
went to forage in the country : they returned with 
pollen, kept guard at the entrance of the hive, 
cleansed it, and stopped up its edges with propolis. 
The wax-workers remained motionless above fifteen 
hours : the curtain of bees, consisting always of the 
same individuals, assured us that none replaced them. 
Some hours later, we remarked that almost all these 
individuals had wax scales under the rings ; and 
next day this phenomenon was still more general. 
The bees forming the external layer of the cluster, 
having now somewhat altered their position, enabled 
us to see their bellies distinctly. By the projection 
of the wax scales, the rings seemed edged with 
white. The curtain of bees became rent in several 
places, and some commotion began to be observed 
in the hive. 

“ Convinced that the combs would originate in 






the centre of the swarm, our whole attention was 
then directed towards the roof of the glass. A worker 
at this time detached itself from one of the central 
festoons of the cluster, separated itself from the 
crowd, and, with its head, drove away the bees at 
the beginning of the row in the middle of the arch, 
turning round to form a space an inch or more in 
diameter, in which it might move freely. It then 
fixed itself in the centre of the space thus cleared. 

“ The worker now employing the pincers at the 
joint of one of the third pair of its limbs, seized a 
scale of wax projecting from a ring, and brought it 
forward to its mouth with the claws of its fore-legs, 




IVax-worhcr laying the foundation of the first Cell. 

where it appeared in a vertical position. We re- 
marked, that, with its claws, it turned the wax in 
every necessary direction ; that the edge of the scale 
was immediately broken down, and the fragments 
having been accumulated in the hollow of the mandi- 
bles, issued forth like a very narrow ribbon, impreg- 
nated with a frothy liquid by the tongue. The 
tongue itself assumed the most varied shapes, and 
executed the most complicated operations, — being 
sometimes flattened like a trowel, and at other times 
pointed like a pencil ; and, after imbuing the whole 
substance of the ribbon, pushed it forward again 
into the mandibles, whence it was drawn out a 
second time, but in an opposite direction. 

“ At length the bee applied these particles of wax 
to the vault of the hive, where the saliva impreg- 
nating them promoted their adhesion, and also com-’ 







municated a whiteness and opacity, which were want- 
ing when the scales were detached from the rings. 
Doubtless, this process was to give the wax that 
ductility and tenacity belonging to its perfect state. 
The bee then separated those portions not yet ap- 
plied to use with its mandibles, and with the same 
organs afterwards arranged them at pleasure. The 
founder bee, a name appropriate to this worker, re- 
peated the same operation, until all the fragments, 
worked up and impregnated with the fluid, were 
attached to the vault, when it repeated the preceding- 
operations on the part of the scale yet kept apart, 
and again united to the rest what was obtained from 
it. A second and third scale were similarly treated 
by the same bee ; yet the work was only sketched ; 
for the worker did nothing but accumulate the par- 
ticles of wax together. Meanwhile, the founder, 
quitting its position, disappeared amidst its com- 
panions. Another, with wax under the rings, suc- 
ceeded it, which, suspending itself to the same spot, 
withdrew a scale by the pincers of the hind legs, and 
passing it through its mandibles, prosecuted the 
work ; and taking care to make its deposit in a line 
with the former, it united their extremities. A third 
worker, detaching itself from the interior of the 
eluster, now came and reduced some of the scales to 
paste, and put them near the materials accumulated 
by its companions, but not in a straight line. Ano- 
ther bee, apparently sensible of the defect, removed 
the misplaced wax before our eyes, and carrying it 
to the former heap, deposited it there, exactly in the 
order and direction pointed out. 

“ From all these operations was produced a block 
of a rugged surface, hanging down from the arch, 
without any perceptible angle, or any traces of cells. 
It was a simple wall, or ridge, running in a straight 
line, and without the least inflection, two-thirds of 







an inch in length, about two-thirds of a cell, or two 
lines, high, and declining towards the extremities. 
We have seen other foundation walls from an inch 
to an inch and a half long, the form being always 
the same but none ever of greater height. 

“ The vacuity in the centre of the cluster had per- 
mitted us to discover the first manoeuvres of the 
bees, and the art with which they laid the foundations 
of their edifices. However, it was filled up too soon 
for our satisfaction ; for workers collecting on both 
faces of the wall obstructed our view of their further 
operations

The obstruction of which M. Huber complains only 
operated as a stimulus to his ingenuity in contriving 
how he miffht continue his interesting: observations. 
From the time of Pappus to the present day, mathe- 
maticians have applied the principles of geometry to 
explain the construction of the cells of a bee-hive ; 
but though their extraordinary regularity, and won- 
derfully selected form, had so often been investigated 
by men of the greatest talent, and skilled in all the 
refinements of science, the process by w hich they are 
constructed, involving also the causes of their regu- 
larity of form, had not been traced, till M. Huber 
devoted himself to the inquiry. 

As the wax-workers secrete only a limited quantity 
of wax, it is indispensably requisite that as little as 
possible of it should be consumed, and that none of it 
should be wasted. Bees, therefore, as M. Reaumur 
well remarks *, have to solve this difficult geometrical 
problem : — A quantity of wax being given, to form 
of it similar and equal cells of a determinate capa- 
city, but of the largest size in proportion to the 
quantity of matter employed, and disposed in such a 
manner as to occupy the least possible space in the 
hive. This problem is solved by bees in all its con- 
ditions. The cylindrical form would seem to be best 
adapted to the shape of the insect ; but had the cells 
been cylindrical, they could not have been applied to 

* R6aumur, vol.v., p. 380. 







each oilier without leaving a vacant and superfluous 
space between every three contiguous cells. Had the 
cells, on the other hand, been square or triangular, they 
might have been constructed without unnecessary 
vacancies ; but these forms would have both required 
more material and been very unsuitable to the shape 
of a bee’s body. The six-sided form of the cells 
obviates every objection ; and while it fulfils the con- 
ditions of the problem, it is equally adapted with a 
cylinder to the shape of the bee. 

M. Reaumur further remarks, that the base of 
each cell, instead of forming a plane, is usually com- 
posed of three pieces in the shape of the diamonds 
on playing cards, and placed in such a manner as to 
form a hollow pyramid. This structure, it may be 
observed, imparts a greater degree of strength, and, 
still keeping the solution of the problem in view, 
gives a great capacity with the smallest expenditure of 
material. This has actually, indeed, been ascertained 
by mathematical measurement and calculation. Ma- 
raldi, the inventor of glass hives, determined, by 
minutely measuring these angles, that the greater 
were 109° 28', and the smaller, 70° 32'; and M. 
Reaumur, being desirous to know why these parti- 
cular angles are selected, requested M. Koenig, a 
skilful mathematician, (without informing him of his 
design, or telling him of Maraldi’s researches,) to 
determine, by calculation, what ought to be the angle 
of a six-sided cell, with a concave pyramidal base, 
formed of three similar and equal rhomboid plates, 
so that the least possible matter should enter into its 
construction By employing what geometricians de- 
nominate the infinitesimal calculus , M. Koenig found 
that the angles should be 109° 26' for the greater, 
and 70° 34' for the smaller, or about two sixtieths of 
a degree, more or less, than the actual angles made 
choice of by bees. The equality of inclination in the 





angles has also been said to facilitate the construction 
of the cells. 

M. Huber adds to these remarks, that the cells of 
the first row, by which the whole comb is attached 
to the roof of a hive, are not like the rest ; for 
instead of six sides they have only five, of which the 
roof forms one. The base, also, is in these different, 
consisting 1 of three pieces on the face of the comb, 
and on the other side of two : one of these only is 
diamond shaped, while the other two are of an irre- 
gular four-sided figure. This arrangement, by bring- 
ing the greatest number of points in contact with the 
interior surface, ensures the stability of the comb. 




Arrangement of Cells. 

It may, however, be said not to be quite certain, 
that Reaumur and others have not ascribed to bees 
the merit of ingenious mathematical contrivance and 
selection, when the construction of the cells may more 
probably originate in the form of their mandibles and 
other instruments employed in their operations. In 
the case of other insects, we have, both in the preced- 
ing and subsequent pages of this volume, repeatedly 
noticed, that they use their bodies, or parts thereof, 
as the standards of measurement and modelling ; and 
it is not impossible that bees may proceed on a 
similar principle. M. Huber replies to this objection, 







that bees are not provided with instruments corre- 
sponding to the angles of their cells ; for there is no 
more resemblance between these and the form of 
their mandibles, than between the chisel of the 
sculptor and the work which he produces. The 
head, he thinks, does not furnish any better explana- 
tion. He admits that the antennae are very flexible, 
so as to enable the insects to follow the outline of 
every object ; but concludes that neither their struc- 
ture, nor that of the limbs and mandibles, are ade- 
quate to explain the form of the cells, though all 
these are employed in the operations of building, — 
the effect, according to him, depending entirely on 
the object which the insect proposes. 

We shall now follow M. Huber in the experiments 
which he contrived, in order to observe the opera- 
tions of the bees subsequent to their laying a founda- 
tion for the first cell ; and we shall again quote from 
his own narrative: — 

“ It appeared to me,” he says, “that the only 
method of isolating the architects, and bringing them 
individually into view, would be to induce them to 
change the direction of their operations, and work 
upwards. 

“ I had a box made twelve inches square and nine 
deep, with a moveable glass lid. Combs full of 
brood, honey, and pollen, were next selected from 
one of my leaf hives, as containing what might in- 
terest the bees, and being cut into pieces a foot long, 
and four inches deep, they were arranged vertically 
at the bottom of the box, at the same intervals as 
the insects themselves usually leave between them. 
A small slip of wooden lath covered the upper edge 
of each. It was not probable that the bees would 
attempt to found new combs on the glass roof of the 
box, because its smoothness precluded the swarm 
from adhering to it; therefore, if disposed to build, 

 



they could do so over the slips resting 1 on the combs, 
Avhich left a vacuity five inches high above them. As 
we had foreseen, the swarm with which this box was 
peopled established itself among the combs below. 
We then observed the nurse-bees displaying their 
natural activity. They dispersed themselves through- 
out the hive, to feed the young grubs, to clear out 
their lodgment, and adapt it for their convenience. 
Certainly, the combs, which were roughly cut to fit 
the bottom of the box, and in some parts damaged, 
appeared to them shapeless and misplaced ; for they 
speedily commenced their reparation. They beat 
down the old wax, kneaded it between their teeth, and 
thus formed binding materials to consolidate them. 
We were astonished beyond expression by such a 
multitude of workers employed at once in labours 
to which it did not appear they should have been 
called, at their coincidence, their zeal, and their pru- 
dence. 

“ But it was still more wonderful, that about half 
the numerous population took no part in the pro- 
ceedings, remaining motionless, while the others ful- 
filled the functions required. The wax-workers, in 
a state of absolute repose, recalled our former obser- 
vations. Gorged with the honey we had put within 
their reach, and continuing in this condition during 
twenty-four hours, wax was formed under their 
rings, and was now ready to be put in operation. 
To our great satisfaction, we soon saw a little foun- 
dation wall rising on one of the slips that we had 
prepared to receive the superstructure. No obstacle 
was offered to the progress of our observations ; and 
for the second time, we beheld both the undertaking 
of the founder bee, and the successive labours of 
several wax-workers, in forming the foundation wall. 
Would that my readers could share the interest which 
the view of these architects inspired ! 







“ This foundation, originally very small, was en- 
larged as the work required ; while they excavated 
on one side a hollow, of about the width of a com- 
mon cell, and on the opposite surface two others 
somewhat more elongated. The middle of the single 
cell corresponded exactly to the partition separating 
the latter; the arches of these excavations, projecting 
by the accumulation of wax, were converted into 
ridges in a straight line ; whence the cells of the first 
row were composed of five sides, considering the 
slip as one side, and those of the second row, of six 
sides. 




Foundation-wall enlarged , and the cells commenced. 



“ The interior conformation of the cavities, ap- 
parently, was derived from the position of their re- 
spective outlines. It seemed that the bees, endowed 
with an admirable delicacy of feeling, directed their 
teeth principally to the place where the wax was 
thickest ; that is, the parts where other workers on 
the opposite side had accumulated it ; and this ex- 
plains why the bottom of the cell is excavated in an 
angular direction behind the projection on the sides 
of which the sides of the corresponding cells are to 
rise. The largest of the excavations, which was op- 
posite to three others, was divided into three parts, 
while the excavations of the first row on the other 
face, applied against this one, were composed of only 
two. 

“ In consequence of the manner in which the ex- 
cavations were opposed to each other, those of the 
second row, and all subsequent, partially applied to 
three cavities, were composed of three equal diamond- 





shaped lozenges. I may here remark, that each 
part of the labour of bees appears the natural result 
of what has preceded it ; therefore, chance has no 
share in these admirable combinations. 

“ A foundation wall rose above the slip like a 
minute vertical partition, five or six lines long, two 
lines high, but only half a line in thickness; the 
edge circular, and the surface rough. Quitting the 
cluster among the combs, a nurse-bee mounted the 
slip, turned around the block, and visiting both sides, 
began to work actively in the middle. It removed 
as much wax with its teeth as might equal the 
diameter of a common cell ; and after kneading and 
moistening the particles, deposited them on the edge 
of the excavation. This insect, having laboured 
some seconds, retired, and was soon replaced by 
another ; a third continued the work, raising the 
margin of the edges, now projecting from the cavity, 
and with assistance of its teeth and feet fixing* the 
particles, so as to give these edges a straighter form. 
More than twenty bees successively participated in 
the same work ; and when the cavity was little above 
a line and a half in height, though equalling a cell in 
width, a bee left the swarm, and after encircling the 
block, commenced its operations on the opposite 
face, where yet untouched. But its teeth acting only 
on one half of this side, the hollow which it formed 
was opposite to only one of the slight prominences 
bordering the first cavity. Nearly at the same time 
another worker began on the right of the face that 
had been untouched, wherein both were occupied in 
forming cavities, which may be designed the second 
and third ; and they also were replaced by substi- 
tutes. These two latter cavities were separated only 
by the common margin, framed of particles of wax 
withdrawn from them ; which margin corresponded 
with the centre of the cavity on the opposite surface. 







The foundation wall itself was still of insufficient 
dimensions to admit the full diameter of a cell ; but 
while the excavations were deepened, wax-workers 
extracting 1 their scales of wax applied them in enlarg- 
ing its circumference ; so that it rose nearly two lines 
further around the circular arch. The nurse-bees, 
which appeared more especially charged with sculp- 
turing the cells, being then enabled to continue their 
outlines, prolonged the cavities, and heightened their 
margins on the new addition of wax 

“ The arch, formed by the edge of each of these 
cavities, was next divided as by two equal chords, in 
the line of which the bees formed stages or project- 
ing borders, or margins meeting at an obtuse angle ; 
the cavities now had four margins, two lateral and 
perpendicular to the supporting slip, and two oblique, 
which were shorter. 

“ Meantime, it became more difficult to follow the 
operations of the bees, from their frequently inter- 
posing their heads between the eye of the observer 
and the bottom of the cell ; but the partition, whereon 
their teeth laboured, had become so transparent, as 
to expose what passed on the other side. 

“ The cavities of which we speak, formed the 
bottom of the first three cells ; and while the bees 
engaged were advancing them to perfection, other 
workers commenced sketching a second row of cells 
above the first, and partly behind those in front — 
for in general, their labour proceeds by combination. 
We cannot say, ‘ When bees have finished this cell, 
they will begin new ones but, ‘ while particular 
workers advance a certain portion, we are certain 
that others will carry on the adjacent cells.’ Farther, 
the work begun on one face of the comb is already 
the commencement of that which is to follow on the 
reverse. All this depends on a reciprocal relation, 
or a mutual connexion of the parts, rendering the 



 



whole subservient to each other. It is undoubted, 
therefore, that slight irregularities on the front will 
affect the form of the cells on the back of the comb 
When they have in this manner worked the bot- 
toms of the first row of cells into the required forms, 
some of the nurse-bees finish them by imparting a 
sort of polish, while others proceed to cut out the 
rudiments of a second row from the fresh wall of 
wax which has been built in the meanwhile by the 
wax-workers, and also on the opposite side of this 
wall ; for a comb of cells is always double, being 
arranged in two layers, placed end to end. The cells 
of this second row are engrafted on the borders of 
cavities hollowed out in the wall, being founded by 
the nurse-bees, bringing the contour of all the bot- 
toms, which is at first unequal, to the same level ; 
and this level is kept uniform in the margins of the 
cells till they are completed. At first sight, nothing 
appears more simple, than adding wax to the mar- 
gins ; but from the inequalities occasioned by the 
shape of the bottom, the bees must accumulate wax 
on the depressions, in order to bring them to a level. 
It follows accordingly that the 'surface of a new 
comb is not quite flat, there being a progressive slope 
produced as the work proceeds, and the comb being 
therefore in the form of a lens, the thickness decreasing 
towards the edge, and the last formed cells being 
shallower or shorter than those preceding them. So 
long as there is room for the enlargement of the 
comb, this thinning of its edge may be remarked ; 
but as soon as the space within the hive prevents its 
enlargement, the cells are made equal, and two flat 
and level surfaces are produced. 

M. Huber observed, that while sketching the 
bottom of a cell, before there was any upright mar- 
gin on the reverse, their pressure on the still soft

and flexible wax gave rise to a projection, which 
sometimes caused a breach of the partition. This, 
however, was soon repaired, but a slight prominence 
always remained on the opposite surface, to the right 
and left of which they placed themselves, to begin a 
new excavation ; and they heaped up part of the 
materials between the two flutings formed by their 
labour. The ridge thus formed becomes a guide to 
the direction which the bees are to follow for the 
vertical furrow of the front cell. 

We have already seen that the first cell determines 
the place of all that succeed it, and two of these are 
never in ordinary circumstances begun in different 
parts of the hive at the same time, as is alleged by 
some earlier writers. When some rows of cells, 
however, have been completed in the first comb, two 
other foundation walls are begun, one on each side of 
it, at the exact distance of one-third of an inch, which 
is sufficient to allow two bees employed on the op- 
posite cells to pass each other without jostling. These 
new walls are also parallel to the former ; and two 
more are afterwards begun exterior to the second, 
and at the same parallel distance. The combs are 
uniformly enlarged, and lengthened in a progression 
proportioned to the priority of their origin ; the 
middle comb being always advanced beyond the two 
adjoining ones by several rows of cells, and these 
again beyond the ones exterior to them. Did the 
bees lay the foundations of all their combs at the 
same time, they would not find it easy to preserve 
parallelism and an equality in their distances. It may 
be remarked further, that beside the vacancies of 
half an inch between the cells, which form what we 
may call the highways of the community, the combs 
are pierced in several places with holes which serve 
as postern-gates for easy communication from one to 
another, to prevent loss of time in going round. The 







equal distance between the combs is of more impor- 
tance to the welfare of the hive than might at first 
appear ; for were they too distant, the bees would be 
so scattered and dispersed, that they could not re- 
ciprocally communicate the heat indispensable for 
hatching the eggs and rearing the young. If the 
combs, on the other hand, were closer, the bees 
could not traverse the intervals with the freedom 
necessary to facilitate the work of the hive. On the 
approach of winter, they sometimes elongate the 
cells which contain honey, and thus contract the 
intervals between the combs. But this expedient is 
in preparation for a season when it is important to 
have copious magazines, and when their activity 
being relaxed, it is unnecessary for their communi- 
cations to be so spacious and free. On the return of 
spring, the bees hasten to contract the elongated 
cells, that they may become fit for receiving the 
eggs which the queen is about to deposit, and in 
this manner they re-establish the regular distance * 

We are indebted to the late Dr. Barclay of Edin- 
burgh, well known as an excellent anatomist, for 
the discovery that each cell in a honeycomb is not 
simply composed of one wall, but consists of two. 
We shall give the account of his discovery in his own 
words : — 

“ Having inquired of several naturalists whether 
or not they knew any author who had mentioned 
that the partitions between the cells of the honey- 
comb were double, and whether or not they had ever 
remarked such a structure themselves, and they hav- 
ing answered in the negative ; I now take the liberty 
of presenting to the Society, pieces of honeycomb, 
in which the young bees had been reared, upon 
breaking which, it will be clearly seen that the par- 
titions between different cells, at the sides and the 

- • * Huber on Bees, p. 220. 






base, are all double ; or, in other words, that each 
cell is a distinct, separate, and in some measure an 
independent structure, agglutinated only to the neigh- 
bouring cells ; and that when the agglutinating sub- 
stance is destroyed, each cell may be entirely sepa- 
rated from the rest. 

“ I have also some specimens of the cells formed 
by wasps, which shew that the partitions between 
them are also double, and that the agglutinating sub- 
stance between them is more easily destroyed than 
that between the cells of the bee 

Irregularities in their Workmanship. 

Though bees, however, work with great uniformity 
when circumstances favour their operations, they may 
be compelled to vary their proceedings. M. Huber 
made several ingenious experiments of this kind. 
The following, mentioned by Dr. Bevan, was acci- 
dental, and occurred to his friend Mr. Walond. 
“ Inspecting his bee-boxes at the end of October, 
1817, he perceived that a centre comb, burdened 
with honey, had separated from its attachments, and 
was leaning against another comb, so as to prevent 
the passage of the bees between them. This acci- 
dent excited great activity in the colony; but its 
nature could not be ascertained at the time. At the 
end of a week, the weather being cold, and the bees 
clustered together, Mr. Walond observed, through 
the window of the box, that they had constructed 
two horizontal pillars betwixt the combs alluded to ; 
and had removed so much of the honey and wax 
from the top of each, as to allow the passage of a 
bee : in about ten days more, there was an unin- 
terrupted thoroughfare ; the detached comb at its- 
upper part had been secured by a strong barrier, and 

* Memoirs of the Wernerian Nat.' Hist. Soc, vol, ii. p. 260. 




fastened to the window with the spare wax. This 
being accomplished, the bees removed the horizontal 
pillars first constructed as being of no further use 
A similar anecdote is told by M. Huber. “ Dur- 
ing the winter,” says he, “ a comb in one of my 
bell-glass hives, having been originally insecure, fell 
down, but preserved its position parallel to the rest. 
The bees were unable to fill up the vacuity left above 
it, because they do not build combs of old wax, and 
none new could be then obtained. At a more favour- 
able season they would have ingrafted a new comb 
on the old one ; but now their provision of honey 
could not be spared for the elaboration of this sub- 
stance, which induced them to ensure the stability 
of the comb by another process. 

“ Crowds of bees taking wax from the lower part 
of other combs, and even gnawing it from the sur- 
face of the orifices of the deepest cells, they con- 
structed so many irregular pillars, joists, or but- 
tresses, between the sides of the fallen comb, and 
others on the glass of the hive. All these were arti- 
ficially adapted to localities. Neither did they con- 
fine themselves to repairing the accidents which their 
works had sustained. They seemed to profit by 
the warning, to guard against a similar casualty. 

The remaining combs were not displaced; there- 
fore, while solidly adhering by the base, we were 
greatly surprised to see the bees strengthen their 
principal fixtures with old wax. They rendered 
them much thicker than before, and fabricated a 
number of new connexions, to unite them more 
firmly to each other, and to the sides of their dwelling. 
All this passed in the middle of January, a time that 
these insects commonly keep in the upper part of 
their hive, and when work is no longer seasonablef.” 
M. Huber the younger shrewdly remarks, that 
* Bevan on Bees, p, 326, f Huber on Bees, p, 416. 







the tendency to symmetry observable in the archi- 
tecture of bees, does not hold so much in small de- 
tails as in the whole work, because they are some- 
times obliged to adapt themselves to particular loca- 
lities. One irregularity leads on to another, and it 
commonly arises from mere accident, or from design 
on the part of the proprietor of the bees. By allow- 
ing, for instance, too little interval between the spars 
for receiving the foundation of the combs, the struc- 
ture has been continued in a particular direction. 
The bees did not at first appear to be sensible of the 
defect, though they afterwards began to suspect their 
error, and were then observed to change their line of 
work till they gained the customary distance. The 
cells having been by this change of direction in some 
degree curved, the new ones which were commenced 
on each side of it, by being built every where parallel 
to it, partook of the same curvature. But the bees 
did not relish such approaches to the “line of beauty,” 
and exerted themselves to bring their buildings again 
into the regular form. 

In consequence of several irregularities which they 
wished to correct, the younger Huber has seen bees 
depart from their usual practice, and at once lay on 
a spar two foundation walls not in the same line. 
They could consequently neither be enlarged without 
obstructing both, nor from their position could the 
edges unite had they been prolonged. The little 
architects, however, had recourse to a very ingenious 
contrivance: they curved the edges of the two combs, 
and brought them to unite so neatly that they could 
be both prolonged in the same line with ease ; and 
when carried to some little distance, their surface 
became quite uniform and level. 

“ Having seen bees,” says the elder Huber, “ work 
both up and down, I wished to try to investigate 
whether we could compel them to construct their 





combs in any other direction. We endeavoured to 
puzzle them with a hive glazed above and below, so 
that they had no place of support but the upright 
sides of their dwelling ; but, betaking themselves to 
the upper angle, they built their combs perpendicular 
to one of these sides, and as regularly as those 
which they usually build under a horizontal surface. 
The foundations were laid on a place which does not 
serve naturally for the base, yet, except in the dif- 
ference of direction, the first row of cells resembled 
those in ordinary hives, the others being distributed 
on both faces, while the bottoms alternately corre- 
sponded with the same symmetry. I put the bees to 
a still greater trial. As they now testified their in- 
clination to carry their combs, by the shortest way, 
to the opposite side of the hive (for they prefer 
uniting them to wood, or a surface rougher than 
glass), I covered it with a pane. Whenever this 
smooth and slippery substance was interposed be- 
tween them and the wood, they departed from the 
straight line hitherto followed, and bent the struc- 
ture of their comb at a right angle to what was al- 
ready made, so that the prolongation of the ex- 
tremity might reach another side of the hive, which 
had been left free. 

“ Varying this experiment in several ways, I saw 
the bees constantly change the direction of their 
combs, when I presented to them a surface too 
smooth to admit of their clustering on it. They al- 
ways sought the wooden sides. I thus compelled 
them to curve the combs in the strangest shapes, by 
placing a pane at a certain distance from their edges. 
These results indicate a degree of instinct truly 
wonderful. They denote even more than instinct : 
for glass is not a substance against which bees can 
be warned by nature. In trees, their natural abode, 
there is nothing that resembles it, or with the same 







polish. The most singular part of their proceeding 
is changing the direction of the work before arriving 
at the surface of the glass, and while yet at a dis- 
tance suitable for doing so. Do they anticipate the 
inconvenience which would attend any other mode 
of building? No less curious is the plan adopted 
by the bee for producing an angle in the combs : the 
wonted fashion of their work, and the dimensions of 
the cells, must be altered. Therefore, the cells on 
the upper or convex side of the combs are enlarged ; 
they are constructed of three or four times the width 
of those on the opposite surface. How can so many 
insects, occupied at once on the edges of the combs, 
concur in giving them a common curvature from one 
extremity to the other ? How do they resolve on 
establishing cells so small on one side, while dimen- 
sions so enlarged are bestowed on those of the other? 
And is it not still more singular, that they have the 
art of making a correspondence between cells of 
such reciprocal discrepance? The bottom being com- 
mon to both, the tubes alone assume a taper form. 
Perhaps no other insect has afforded a more decisive 
proof of the resources of instinct, when compelled to 
deviate from the ordinary course. 

“ But let us study them in their natural state, and 
there we shall find that the diameter of their cells 
must be adapted to the individuals which shall be 
bred in them. The cells of males have the same 
figure, the same number of lozenges and sides as 
those of workers, and angles of the* same size. 
Their diameter is 34- lines, while those of workers 
are only 2J-. 

“ It is rarely that the cells of males occupy the 
higher part of the combs. They are generally in 
the middle or on the sides, where they are not iso- 
lated. The manner in which they are surrounded 
by other cells alone can explain how the transition 





in size is effected. When the cells of males are to be 
fabricated under those of workers, the bees make 
several rows of intermediate cells, whose diameter 
augments progressively, until gaining that propor- 
tion proper to the cells required ; and, in returning 
to those of workers, a lowering is observed in a 
manner corresponding. 

“ Bees, in preparing the cells of males, previously 
establish a block or lump of wax on the edge of their 
comb, thicker than is usually employed for those of 
workers. It is also made higher, otherwise the same 
order and symmetry could not be preserved on a 
larger scale. 

“ Several naturalists notice the irregularities in the 
cells of bees as so many defects. What would have 
been their astonishment had they observed that part of 
them are the result of calculation ? Had they followed 
the imperfection of their organs, some other means 
of compensating them would have been granted to the 
insects. It is much more surprising that they know 
how to quit the ordinary route, when circumstances 
demand the construction of enlarged cells ; and, after 
building thirty or forty rows of them, to return to the 
proper proportions from which they have departed, by 
successive reductions. Bees also augment the dimen- 
sions of their cells when there is an opportunity for 
a great collection of honey. Not only are they then 
constructed of a diameter much exceeding that of the 
common cells, but they are elongated throughout the 
whole space admitting it. A great portion of irre- 
gular comb contains cells an inch, or even an inch 
and a half, in depth. 

“ Bees, on the contrary, sometimes are induced 
to shorten their cells. When wishing to prolong an 
old comb, whose cells have received their full dimen- 
sions, they gradually reduce the thickness of its edges, 
by gnawing down the sides of the cells, until they 







restore it. to its original lenticular form. They add 
a waxen block around the whole circumference, and 
on the edge of the comb construct pyramidal bottoms, 
such as those fabricated on ordinary occasions. It is 
a certain fact, that a comb never is extended in any 
direction unless the bees have thinned the edges, 
which are diminished throughout a sufficient space 
to remove any angular projection. 

“ The law which obliges these insects partly to de- 
molish the cells on the edges of the comb before en- 
larging it, unquestionably demands more profound in- 
vestigation. How can we account for instinct leading 
them to undo what they have executed with the utmost 
care ? The wonted regular gradation, which may be 
necessary for new cells, subsists among those ad- 
joining the edges of a comb recently constructed. 
But afterwards, when those on the edge are deepened 
like the cells of the rest of the surface, the bees no 
longer preserve the decreasing gradation which is 
seen in the new combs*.” 

The Finishing of the Cells. 

While the cells are building, they appear to be of 
a dull white colour, soft, even, though not smooth, 
and translucent: but in a few days they become 
tinged with yellow, particularly on the interior sur- 
face ; and their edges, from being thin, uniform, and 
yielding, become thicker, less regular, more heavy, 
and so firm that they will bend rather than break. 
New combs break on the slightest touch. There is 
also a glutinous substance observable around the 
orifices of the yellow cells, of reddish colour, unctuous, 
and odoriferous. Threads of the same substance are 
applied all around the interior of the cells, and at the 
summit of their angles, as if it were for the purpose 
* Huber on Bees, p. 391. 

 



of binding and strengthening the walls. These 
yellow cells also require a much higher temperature 
of water to melt them than the white ones. 

It appeared evident, therefore, that another sub- 
stance, different from wax, had been employed in 
varnishing; the orifices and strengthening; the in- 
terior of the cells. M. Huber, by numerous ex- 
periments, ascertained the resinous threads lining 
the cells, as well as the resinous substance around 
their orifice, to be propolis ; for he traced them, 
as we mentioned in our account of propolis, from 
the poplar buds where they collected it, and saw 
them apply it to the cells ; but the yellow colour is 
not imparted by propolis, to which it bears no ana- 
logy. We are, indeed, by no means certain what 
it is, though it was proved by experiment not to 
arise from the heat of the hives, nor from emanations 
of honey, nor from particles of pollen. Perhaps 
it may be ascribed to the bees rubbing their teeth, 
feet, and other parts of their body on the surfaces 
where they seem to rest; orto their tongue (haustellum) 
sweeping from right to left like a fine pliant pencil, 
when it appears to leave some sprinkling of a trans- 
parent liquid. 

Beside painting and varnishing their cells in this 
manner, they take care to strengthen the weaker parts 
of their edifice by means of a mortar composed of 
propolis and wax, and named pissoceros* by the an- 
cients, who first observed it, though Reaumur was 
somewhat doubtful respecting the existence of such 
a composition. We are indebted to the shrewd ob- 
servations of Huber for a reconcilement of the Roman 
and the French naturalists. The details which he 
has given of his discovery are perhaps the most in- 
teresting in his delightful book. 

“ Soon,” he says, “ after some new combs had been 
* From two Greek words, signifying pilch and wax, 







finished in a hive, manifest disorder and agitation pre- 
vailed among the bees. They seemed to attack their 
own works. The primitive cells, whose structure we 
had admired, were scarcely recognizable. Thick and 
massy walls, heavy, shapeless pillars, were substituted 
for the slight partitions previously built with such regu- 
larity. The substance had changed along with the form, 
being composed apparently of wax and propolis. From 
the perseverance of the workers in their devastations, 
we suspected that they proposed some useful alteration 
of their edifices ; and our attention was directed to the 
cells least injured. Several were yet untouched ; but 
the bees soon rushed precipitately on them, destroyed 
the tubes, broke down the wax, and threw all the 
fragments about. But we remarked, that the bottom 
of the cells of the first row was spared ; neither were 
the corresponding parts on both faces of the comb 
demolished at the same time. The bees laboured at 
them alternately, leaving some of the natural sup- 
ports, otherwise the comb would have fallen down, 
which was not their object : they wished, on the con- 
trary, to provide it a more solid base, and to secure 
its union to the vault of the hive, with a substance 
whose adhesive properties infinitely surpassed those 
of wax. The propolis employed on this occasion 
had been deposited in a mass over a cleft of the hive, 
and had hardened in drying, which probably ren- 
dered it more suitable for the purpose. But the bees 
experienced some difficulty in making any impression 
on it ; and we thought, as also had appeared to M. 
de Reaumur, that they softened it with the same 
frothy matter from the tongue which they use to ren- 
der wax more ductile. 

“ We very distinctly observed the bees mixing 
fragments of old wax with the propolis, kneading the 
two substances together to incorporate them ; and 
the compound was employed in rebuilding the cells 







that had been destroyed. But they did not now fol- 
low their ordinary rules of architecture, for they were 
occupied by the solidity of their edifices alone. 
Night intervening, suspended our observations, but 
next morning confirmed what we had seen. 

“ We find, therefore, that there is an epoch in the 
labour of bees, when the upper foundation of their 
combs is constructed simply of wax, as Reaumur 
believed ; and that after all the requisite conditions 
have been attained, it is converted to a mixture of wax 
and propolis, as remarked by Pliny so many ages 
before us. Thus is the apparent contradiction be- 
tween these two great naturalists explained. But 
this is not the utmost extent of the foresight of these 
insects. When they have plenty of wax, they make 
their combs the full breadth of the hive, and solder 
them to the glass or wooden sides, by structures 
more or less approaching the form of cells, as 
circumstances admit. But should the supply of wax 
fail before they have been able to give sufficient 
diameter to the combs whose edges are rounded, 
large intervals remain between them and the upright 
sides of the hive, and they are fixed only at the top. 
Therefore did not the bees provide against it, by con- 
structing great pieces of wax mixed with propolis, in 
the intervals, they might be borne down by the 
weight of the honey. These pieces are of irregular 
shape, strangely hollowed out, and their cavities void 
of symmetry r \” 

It is remarked by the lively Abbe La Pluche, that 
the foundations of our houses sink with the earth on 
which they are built, the walls begin to stoop by de- 
grees, they nod with age, and bend from their per- 
pendicular; — lodgers damage everything, and time is 
continually introducing some new decay. The man- 
sions of bees, on the contrary, grow stronger the 
* Huber on Bees, p. 415. 







oftener they change inhabitants. Every bee-grub, 
before its metamorphosis into a nymph, fastens its 
skin to the partitions of its cell, but in such a man- 
ner as to make it correspond with the lines of the 
angles, and without in the least disturbing the regula- 
rity of the figure. During summer, accordingly, the 
same lodging may serve for three or four grubs in 
succession ; and in the ensuing season it may accom- 
modate an equal number. Each grub never fails to 
fortify the panels of its chamber by arraying them 
with its spoils, and the contiguous cells receive a si- 
milar augmentation from its brethren *. Reaumur 
found as many as seven or eight of these skins 
spread over one another : so that all the cells being 
incrusted with six or seven coverings, well dried and 
cemented with propolis, the whole fabric daily ac- 
quires a new degree of solidity. 

It is obvious, however, that by a repetition of this 
process the cell might be rendered too contracted ; 
but in such a case the bees know well how to pro- 
ceed, by turning the cells to other uses, such as ma- 
gazines for bee-bread and honey. It has been re- 
marked, however, that in the hive of a new swarm, 
during the months of July and August, there are 
fewer small bees or nurse-bees, than in one that has 
been tenanted four or five years. The workers, in- 
deed, clean out the cell the moment that a young- 
bee leaves its cocoon, but they never detach the 
silky film which it has previously spun on the walls 
of its cell. But though honey is deposited after the 
young leave the cells, the reverse also happens ; and 
accordingly when bees are bred in contracted cells, 
they are by necessity smaller, and constitute, in fact, 
the important class of nurse-bees. 

We are not disposed, however, to go quite so far as 
an American periodical writer, who says, “ Thus we 
* Spectacle de la Nature, vol. i. 




see that the contraction of the cell may diminish the 
size of a bee, even to the extinction of life , just as the 
contraction of a Chinese shoe reduces the foot even to 
uselessness*.” We know, on the contrary, that the 
queen bee will not deposit eggs in a cell either too 
small or too large for the proper rearing of the young. 
In the case of large cells, M. Huber took advantage 
of a queen that was busy depositing the eggs of work- 
ers, to remove all the common cells adapted for their 
reception, and left only the large cells appropriated for 
males. As this was done in June, when bees are most 
active, he expected that they would have immediately 
repaired the breaches he had made, but to his great 
surprise they did not make the slightest movement 
for that purpose. In the meanwhile the queen, being 
oppressed by her eggs, was obliged to drop them 
about at random, preferring this to depositing 
them in the male cells which she knew to be too 
large. At length she did deposit six eggs in the 
large cells, which were hatched, as usual, three days 
after. The nurse-bees, however, seemed to be aware 
that they could not be reared there, and, though they 
supplied them with food, did not attend to them re- 
gularly. M. Huber found that they had been all re- 
moved from the cells during the night, and the busi- 
ness both of laying and nursing was at a complete 
stand for twelve days, when he supplied them again 
with a comb of small cells, which the queen almost 
immediately filled with eggs, and in some cells she 
laid five or six. 



The architecture of the hive, which we have thus 
detailed, is that of bees receiving the aid of human

uncommon for swarms to stray from their proprietors. 
But these stray swarms do not spread colonies 
through our woods, as they are said to do in America. 
In the remoter parts of that continent there are no wild 
bees. They precede civilization; and thus when the 
Indians observe a swarm they say “ the white man is 
coming.” There is evidence of bees having abounded 
in these islands, in the earlier periods of our history ; 
and Ireland is particularly mentioned by the Venerable 
Bede as being “ rich in milk and honey The hive- 
bee has formed an object of economical culture in 
Europe at least for two thousand years ; and Varro 
describes the sort of hives used in his time, 1870 
years ago. We are not aware, however, that it is 
now to be found wild in the milder clime of Southern 
Europe, any more than it is in our own island. 

The wild bees of Palestine principally hived in 
rocks. “ He made him,” says Moses, “ to suck 
honey out of the rockf-” “With honey out of the 
rock,” says the Psalmist, “ should I have satisfied 
thee J.” In the caves of Salsette and Elephanta, at 
the present day, they hive in the clefts of the rocks, 
and the recesses among the fissures, in such num- 
bers, as to become very troublesome to visiters. 
Their nests hang in innumerable clusters ||. 

We are told of a little black stingless bee found in 
the island of Guadaloupe, which hives in hollow trees 
or in the cavities of rocks by the sea side, and lays 
“ up honey in cells about the size and shape of 
pigeons’ eggs. These cells are of a black or deep 
violet colour, and so joined together as to leave no 
space between them. They hang in clusters almost 
like a bunch of grapes The following are men- 
tioned by Lindley as indigenous to Brazil. “ On an

excursion towards Upper Tapagippe,” says he, “ and 
skirting- the dreary woods which extend to the interior, 
I observed the trees more loaded with bees’ nests 
than even in the neighbourhood of Porto Seguro. 
They consist of a ponderous shell of clay cemented 
similarly to martins’ nests, swelling from high trees 
about a foot thick, and forming an oval mass full 
two feet in diameter. When broken, the wax is 
arranged as in our hives, and the honey abundant*.” 

Captain Basil Hall found in South America the 
hive of a honey-bee very different from the Brazilian, 
but nearly allied to, if not the same, as that of 
Guadaltoupe. “ The hive we saw opened,” he says, 
“was only partly tilled, which enabled us to see the 
economy of the interior to more advantage. The 
honey is not contained in the elegant hexagonal cells 
of our hives, but in wax-bags, not quite so large as 
an egg. These bags or bladders are hung round the 
sides of the hive, and appear about half full ; the 
quantity being probably just as great as the strength 
of the wax will bear without tearing. Those near 
the bottom, being better supported, are more filled 
than the upper ones. In the centre of the lower part 
of the hive we observed an irregularly-shaped mass of 
comb, furnished with cells like those of our bees, all 
containing young ones in such an advanced state, 
that, when we broke the comb, and let them out, they 
flew merrily away.” 

Clavigero, in his History of Mexico, evidently de- 
scribing the same species of bee, says it abounds in 
Yucatan, and makes the honey of Estabentum, the 
finest in the world, and which is taken every two 
months. He mentioned another species of bee, 
smaller in size, and also without a sting, which forms 
its nest of the shape of a sugarloaf, and as large or 
larger. These are suspended from trees, particularly

from the oak, and are much more populous than our 
common hives. 

Wild honey-bees of some species appear also to 
abound in Africa. Mr. Park, in his second volume 
of travels, tells us that some of his associates im- 
prudently attempted to rob a numerous hive of its 
honey, when the exasperated bees, rushing out to 
defend their property, attacked their assailants with 
great fury, and quickly compelled the whole com- 
pany to fly. 

At the Cape of Good Hope the bees themselves 
must be less formidable, or more easily managed, as 
their hives are sought for with avidity. Nature has 
there provided man with a singular and very effi- 
cient assistant in a bird, most appropriately named 
the Honey-guide ( Indicator major , Vieillot; Cu - 
cuius indicator , La.tham). The honey-guide, so far 
from being alarmed at the presence of man, appears 
anxious to court his acquaintance, and flits from 
tree to tree with an expressive note of invitation, 
the meaning of which is well known both to the 
colonists and the Hottentots. A person invited by 
the honey-guide seldom refuses to follow it on- 
wards till it stops, as it is certain to do, at some 
hollow tree containing a bee-hive, usually well stored 
with honey and wax. It is probable that the bird 
finds itself inadequate to the attack of a legion of 
bees, or to penetrate into the interior of the hive, and 
is thence led to invite an agent more powerful than 
itself. The person invited, indeed, always leaves the 
bird a share of the spoil, as it would be considered 
sacrilege to rob it of its due, or in any way to injure 
so useful a creature. 

The Americans, who have not the African honey- 
guide, employ several well-known methods to track 
bees to their hives. One of the most common 
though ingenious modes, is to place a piece of bee- 





bread on a flat surface, a tile for instance, surround- 
ing it with a circle of wet white paint. , The bee, 
whose habit it is always to alight on the edge of any 
plane, has to travel through the paint to reach the 
bee-bread. When, therefore, she flies off, the ob- 
server can track her by the white on her body. The 
same operation is repeated at another place, at some 
distance from the first, and at right angles to the bee- 
line, just ascertained. The position of the hive is 
easily determined, for it lies in the angle made by the 
intersection of the bee-lines. Another method is 
described in the Philosophical Transactions for 1721. 
The bee-hunter decoys, by a bait of honey, some of 
the bees into his trap, and when he has secured as 
many as he judges will suit his purpose, he incloses 
one in a tube, and, letting it fly, marks its course by 
a pocket compass. Departing to some distance, he 
liberates another, observes its course, and in this 
manner determines the position of the hive, upon the 
principle already detailed. These methods of bee- 
hunting depend upon the insect’s habit of always 
flying in a right line to its home. Those who have 
read Cooper’s tale of the ‘ Prairie’ must well remem- 
ber the expression of “ lining a bee to its hive.” 

In reading these and similar accounts of the 
bees of distant parts of the world, we must not 
conclude that the descriptions refer to the same 
species as the common honey-bee. There are nu- 
merous species of social bees which, while they differ 
in many circumstances, agree in the practice of 
storing up honey, in the same way as we have nu- 
merous species of the mason-bee and of the humble 
bee. Of the latter Mr. Stephens enumerates no less 
than forty-two species indigenous to Britain. 





The operations of an insect in boring’ into a leaf or 
a bud to form a lodgment for its eggs appear very 
simple. The tools, however, by which these effects 
are performed are very complicated and curious. In 
the case of gall-flies ( Cynips ), the operation itself is 
not so remarkable as its subsequent chemical effects. 
These effects are so different from any others that may 
be classed under the head of Insect Architecture, that 
we shall reserve them for the latter part of this vo- 
lume — although, with reference to the use of galls, 
the protection of eggs and larvae, they ought to find 
a place here. We shall, however, at present confine 
ourselves to those which simply excavate a nest, with- 
out producing a tumour. 

The first of these insects which we shall mention 
is celebrated for its song, by the ancient Greek poets, 
under the name of Tem^. The Romans called it 
Cicada, which we sometimes, but erroneously, trans- 
late “ grasshopper for the grasshoppers belong to 
an entirely different order of insects. We shall, there- 
fore, take the liberty of calling the Cicadae, Tree- 
hoppers, to which the cuckoo -spit insect ( Tettigonia 
spumaria , Oliv.) is allied ; but there is only one of 
the true cicadae hitherto ascertained to be British, 
namely, the Cicada hcematodes (Linn.), which was 
taken in the New Forest, Hampshire, by Mr. Daniel 
Bydder. 

M. Reaumur was exceedingly anxious to study the 
economy of those insects ; but they not being indi- 
genous in the neighbourhood of Paris, he commis- 





sionecl liis friends to send him some from more 
southern latitudes, and he procured in this way spe- 
cimens not only from the South of France and 
from Italy, but also from Egypt. From these 
specimens he has given the best account of them 
yet published ; for though, as he tells us, he had 
never had the pleasure of seeing one of them alive, 
the more interesting parts of their structure can 
be studied as well in dead as in living specimens. 
We ourselves possess several specimens from New 
Holland, upon which we have verified some of the 
more interesting’ observations of Reaumur. 

Virgil tells us, that in his time “ the cicadse burst 
the very shrubs with their querulous music*;” but 
we may well suppose that he was altogether unac- 
quainted with the singular instrument by means of 
which they can actually (not poetically) cut grooves 
in the branches they select for depositing their eggs. 
It is the male, as in the case of birds, which fills 
the woods with his song ; while the female, though 
mute, is no less interesting to the naturalist on ac- 
count of her curious ovipositor. This instrument, 
like all those with which insects are furnished by 
nature for cutting, notching, or piercing, is com- 
posed of a horny substance, and is also considerably 
larger than the size of the tree-hopper would pro- 
portionally indicate. It can on this account be par- 
tially examined without a microscope, being, in some 
of the larger species, no less than five lines! in length. 

The ovipositor or auger ( tariere ) as Reaumur calls 
it, is lodged in a sheath which lies in a groove of the 
terminating ring of the belly. It requires only a very 
slight pressure to cause the instrument to protrude 
from its sheath, when it appears to the naked eye to 
be of equal thickness throughout except at the point, 

* Cantu querulae rumpent arbusta cicada-. Georg, iii. 328. 
f A line is about the twelfth part of an inch. 







where it is somewhat enlarged and angular, and on 
both sides finely indented with teeth. A more mi- 
nute examination of the sheath demonstrates that it 
is composed of two horny pieces slightly curved, and 
ending in the form of an elongated spoon, the concave 
part of which is adapted to receive the convex end of 
the ovipositor. 

When the protruded instrument is further examined 
with a microscope, the denticulations, nine in number 
on each side, appear strong, and arranged with great 
symmetry, increasing in fineness towards the point, 
where there are three or four very small ones, beside 
the nine that are more obvious. The magnifier also 
shews that the instrument itself, which appeared sim- 
ple to the naked eye, is in fact composed of three 
different pieces, two exterior armed with the teeth 
before-mentioned, denominated by Reaumur files, 
(limes), and another pointed like a lancet, and not 
denticulated. The denticulated pieces moreover are 
capable of being moved forwards and backwards, 
while the centre one remains stationary, and as this 
motion is effected by pressing a pin or the blade of a 
knife over the muscles on either side at the origin of 
the ovipositor, it may be presumed that those mus- 
cles are destined for producing similar movements 
when the insect requires them. By means of a finely 
pointed pin carefully introduced between the pieces, 
and pushed very gently downwards, they may be, 
with no great difficulty, separated in their whole ex- 
tent. 

The contrivance by which those three pieces are 
held united, while at the same time the two files can 
be easily put in motion, are similar to some of our 
own mechanical inventions, with this difference, that 
no human workman could construct an instrument of 
this description so small, fine, exquisitely polished, 
and fitting so exactly. We should have been apt to 

 



form the grooves in the central piece, whereas they 
are scooped out in the handles of the files, and play 
upon two projecting ridges in the central piece, by 
which means this is rendered stronger. M. Reaumur 
discovered that the best manner of showing the play of 
this extraordinary instrument is to cut it off with a 
pair of scissors near its origin, and then, taking it 
between the thumb and the finger at the point of 
section, work it gently to put the files in motion. 




Ovipositors, withjilcs, of Tree-hopper, magnified. 

Beside the muscles necessary for the movement 
of the files, the handle of each is terminated by a 
curve of the same hard horny substance as itself, 
which not only furnishes the muscles with a sort of 
lever, but serves to press, as with a spring, the two 
files close to the central piece, as is shewn in the 
lower figure. 

M. Pontedera, who studied the economy of the 
tree-hoppers with some care, was anxious to see the 







insect itself make use of the ovipositor in forming 
grooves in wood, but found that it was so shy and 
easily alarmed, that it took to flight whenever he 
approached ; a circumstance of which Reaumur takes 
advantage, to soothe his regret that the insects were 
not indigenous in his neighbourhood. But of their 
workmanship when completed, he had several speci- 
mens sent to him from Provence and Languedoc 
by the Marquis de Caumont. 

The gall-flies, when about to deposit their eggs, 
select growing plants and trees ; but the tree-hoppers, 
on the contrary, make choice of dead, dried branches, 
for the mother seems to be aware that moisture 
would injure her progeny. The branch, commonly 
a small one, in which eggs have been deposited, may 
be recognised by being covered with little oblong 
elevations caused by small splinters of the wood, de- 
tached at one end, but left fixed at the other by the 
insect. These elevations are for the most part in a 
line, rarely in a double line, nearly at equal distances 
from each other, and form a lid to a cavity in the 
wood about four lines in length, containing from

four to ten eggs. It is to be remarked, that the 
insect always selects a branch of such dimensions, 
that it can get at the pith, not because the pith is 
more easily bored, for it does not penetrate into it at 
all, but to form a warm and safe bed for the eggs. 
M. Pontedera says, that when the eggs have been 
deposited, the insect closes the mouth of the hole 
with a gum capable of protecting them from the wea- 
ther ; but M. Reaumur thinks this only) a fancy, as 







out of a great number which he examined, he could 
discover nothing of the kind. Neither is such a pro- 
tection wanted ; for the woody splinters above men- 
tioned furnish a very good covering. 

The grubs hatched from these eggs (of which, M. 
Pontedera says, one female will deposit from five to 
seven hundred) issue from the same holes through 
which the eo-ffs have been introduced, and betake 
themselves to the ground to feed on the roots of 
plants. They are not transformed into chrysalides, 
but into active nymphs, remarkable for their fore 
limbs, which are thick, strong, and furnished with 
prongs for digging; and when we are told by Dr. Le 
Fevre, that they make their way easily into hard stiff 
clay, to the depth of two or three feet, we perceive 
how necessary to them such a conformation must be. 

Saw-Flies. 

An instrument for cutting grooves in wood, still 
more ingeniously contrived than that of the tree- 
hopper, was first observed by Vallisnieri, an eminent 
Italian naturalist, in a four-winged fly, most appro- 
priately denominated by M. Reaumur the saw-fly 
( Tenthredo ), of which many sorts are indigenous to 
Great Britain. The grubs from which those flies 
originate are indeed but too well known, as they fre- 
quently strip our rose, gooseberry, raspberry, and red 
currant trees of their leaves, and are no less destruc- 
tive to birch, alder, and willows ; while turnips and 
wheat suffer still more seriously by their ravages. These 
grubs may readily be distinguished from the cater- 
pillars of moths and butterflies, by having from six- 
teen to twenty-eight feet, by which they usually hang 
to the leaf they feed on, while they coil up the hinder 
part of their body in a spiral ring. The perfect flies 
are distinguished by four transparent wings ; and 







some of the most common have a flat body of a 
yellow or orange colour, while the head and shoulders 
are black. 

In order to see the ovipositor to which we shall 
for the present turn our chief attention, a female saw- 
fly must be taken, and her belly gently pressed, when 
a narrow slit will be observed to open at some dis- 
tance from the anus, and a short, pointed, and some- 
what curved body, of a brown colour and horny sub- 
stance, will be protruded. The curved plates which 
form the sides of the slit, are the termination of the 
sheath, in which the instrument lies concealed till it 
is wanted by the insect. The appearance of this in- 
strument, however, and its singular structure, cannot 
be well understood without the aid of a microscope. 




a, Ovipositor of Saw-fly, protruded from its Sheath , magnified. 

The instrument thus brought into view, is a very 
finely contrived saw, made of horn, and adapted 
for penetrating branches and other parts of plants, 
where the eggs are to be deposited. The ovipo- 
sitor saw of the insect is much more complicated 
than any of those employed by our carpenters. The 
teeth of our saws are formed in a line, but in such 
a manner, as to cut in two lines parallel to, and at 
a small distance from each other. This is effected 
by slightly bending the points of the alternate teeth 
right and left, so that one half of the whole teeth 






stand a little to the right, and the other half a little 
to the left. The distance of the two parallel lines 
thus formed is called the course of the saw, and it 
is only the portion of wood which lies in the course 
that is cut into saw-dust by the action of the instru- 
ment. It will follow, that in proportion to the thin- 
ness of a saw there will be the less destruction of 
wood which may be sawed. When cabinet-makers 
have to divide valuable wood into very thin leaves, 
they accordingly employ saws with a narrow course ; 
while sawyers who cut planks, use one with a broad 
course. The ovipositor saw being extremely fine, does 
not require the teeth to diverge much, but from the 
manner in which they operate, it is requisite that they 
should Hot stand like those of our saws in a straight 
line. The greater portion of the edge of the instru- 
ment, on the contrary, is towards the point some- 
what concave, similar to a scythe, while towards the 
base it becomes a little convex, the whole edge being 
nearly the shape of an Italic f. 




Ovipositor-saw of Saw-fly, with rasps shewn in the crosslines. 







The ovipositor-saw of the fly is put in motion in 
the same way as a carpenter’s hand-saw, supposing 1 
the tendons attached to its base to form the handle, 
and the muscles which put it in motion to be the 
hand of the carpenter. But the carpenter can only 
work one saw at a time, whereas each of these flies 
is furnished with two, equal and similar, which it 
works at the same time — one being advanced and 
the other retracted alternately. The secret, indeed, 
of working more saws than one at once is not un- 
known to our mechanics ; for two or three are some- 
times fixed in the same frame. These, however, not 
only all move upwards and downwards simultane- 
ously, but cut the wood in different places ; while 
the two saws of the ovipositor work in the same cut, 
and, consequently, though the teeth are extremely 
fine, the effect is similar to a saw with a wide set. 

It is important, seeing that the ovipositor-saws 
are so fine, that they be not bent or separated while 
in operation — and this, also, nature has provided for, 
by lodging the backs of the saws in a groove, formed 
by two membranous plates, similar to the structure 
of a clasp-knife. These plates are thickest at the 
base, becoming gradually thinner as they approach 
the point which the form of the saws require. Ac- 
cording to Vallisnieri, it is not the only use of this 
apparatus to form a back for the saws, he having 
discovered, between the component membranes, two 
canals, which he supposes are employed to conduct 
the eggs of the insect into the grooves which it has 
hollowed out for them*. 

The teeth of a carpenter’s saw, it may be remarked, 
are simple, whereas the teeth of the ovipositor saw 
are themselves denticulated with fine teeth. The 
latter, also, combines at the same time the properties 
of a saw and of a rasp or file. So far as we are aware, 
* Reaumur, Mem. ties Insectes, y. p. iii. 





 



these two properties have never been combined in 
any of the tools of our carpenters. The rasping 
part of the ovipositor, however, is not constructed 
like our rasps, with short teeth thickly studded toge- 
ther, but has teeth almost as long as those of the 
saw, and placed contiguous to them on the back of 
the instrument, resembling in their form and setting 
the teeth of a comb, as may be seen in the figure. 
Of course, such observations are conducted with the 
aid of a microscope. 




Portion of Saw-fly's comb-toothed rasp, and saw. 



When a female saw-fly has selected the branch of 
a rose-tree, or any other, in which to deposit her eggs, 
she may be seen bending the end of her belly inwards, 
in form of a crescent, and protruding her saw, at the 
same time, to penetrate the bark or wood. She main- 
tains this recurved position so long as she works in 
deepening the groove; but when she has attained the 
depth required, she unbends her body into a straight 
line, and in this position works upon the place 
lengthways, by applying the saw more horizontally. 
When she has rendered the groove as large as she 
wishes, the motion of the tendons ceases, and an 
egg is placed in the cavity. The saw is then with- 
drawn into the sheath for about two-thirds of its 
length, and at the same moment, a sort of frothy 
liquid, similar to a lather made with soap, is 
dropped over the egg, either for the purpose of glue- 
ing it in its place, or sheathing it from the action of 
the juices of the tree. She proceeds in the same 
manner in sawing out a second groove, ancl so on in 







succession till she has deposited all her eggs, some- 
times to the number of twenty-four. The grooves 
are usually placed in a line, at a small distance from 
one another, on the same branch ; but sometimes the 
mother-fly shifts to another, or to a different part of 
the branch, when she is either scared or finds it un- 
suitable. She commonly, also, takes more than one 
day to the work, notwithstanding the superiority of 
her tools. Reaumur has seen a saw-fly make six 
grooves in succession, which occupied her about ten 
hours and a half. 

The grooves, when finished, have externally little 
elevation above the level of the bark, appearing like 
the puncture of a lancet in the human skin ; but in 
the course of a day or two the part becomes first 
brown and then black, while it also becomes more 
and more elevated. This increased elevation is not 
owing to the growth of the bark, the fibres of which, 
indeed, have been destroyed by the ovipositor saw, 
but to the actual growth of the egg ; for, when a new- 
laid egg of the saw-fly is compared with one which 
has been several days enclosed in the groove, the 
latter will be found to be very considerably the larger. 
This growth of the egg is contrary to the analogy 
observable in the eggs of birds, and even of most 
other insects ; but it has its advantages. As it 
continues to increase, it raises the bark more and 
more, and consequently widens, at the same time, 
the slit at the entrance ; so that, when the grub 
is hatched, it finds a passage ready for its exit. The 
mother-fly seems to be aware of this growth of her 
eggs, for she takes care to deposit them at such 
distances as may prevent their disturbing one another 
by their developement. 

Another species of saw-fly, with a yellow body and 
deep violet-coloured wings, which also selects the 
rose-tree, deposits her eggs in a different manner. 
Instead of making a groove for each egg, like the 





preceding, she forms a large single groove, sufficient 
for about two dozen eggs. These eggs are all ar- 
ranged in pairs, forming two straight lines parallel 
to the sides of the branch. The eggs, however, though 
thus deposited in a common groove, are carefully 
kept each in its place ; for a ridge of the wood is lelt 
to prevent those on the right from touching those on 
the left — and not only so, but between each egg of a 
row a thin partition of wood is left, forming a shallow 



The edges of this groove, it will be obvious, must 
be farther apart than those which only contain a 
single egg, and, in fact, the whole is open to inspec- 
tion ; but the eggs are kept from falling out, both 
by the frothy glue before mentioned, and by the walls 
of the cells containing them. They were observed 
also, by Vallisnieri, to increase in size like the pre- 
ceding.

Nest of eggs of Saw-fly, in rose-tree. 





The labours of those insect-architects, which we have 
endeavoured to describe in the preceding pages, have 
been chiefly those of mothers to form a secure nest 
for their eggs, and the young hatched from them, 
during the first stage of their existence. But a much 
more numerous, and not less ingenious class of 
architects, may be found among the newly hatched 
insects themselves, who, untaught by experience, and 
altogether unassisted by previous example, manifest 
the most marvellous skill in the construction of 
tents, houses, galleries, covert-ways, fortifications, 
and even cities, not to sf>eak of subterranean caverns 
and subaqueous apartments, which no human art 
could rival. 

The caterpillars which are familiarly termed leaf- 
rollers, are perfect hermits. Each lives in a cell, 
which it begins to construct almost immediately after 
it is hatched; and the little structure is at once a 
house which protects the caterpillar from its enemies, 
and a store of food for its subsistence, while it remains 
shut up in its prison. But the insect only devours 
the inner folds. The art which these caterpillars 
exercise, although called into action but once, 
perhaps, in their lives, is perfect. They accomplish 
their purpose with a mechanical skill, which is re- 
markable for its simplicity and unerring success. 
The art of rolling leaves into a secure and immovable 









cell may not appear very difficult; — nor would it 
be so if the caterpillars had fingers, or any parts 
which were equivalent to those delicate and admirable 
natural instruments with which man accomplishes his 
most elaborate works. And yet the human fingers 
could not roll a rocket-case of paper more regularly 
than the caterpillar rolls his house of leaves. A leaf 
is not a very easy substance to roll. In some trees 
it is very brittle. It has also a natural elasticity, — 
a disposition to spring back if it be bent, — which is 
caused by the continuity of its threads, or nervures. 
This elasticity is speedily overcome by the ingenuity 
with which the caterpillar works ; and the leaf is 
thus retained in its artificial position for many weeks, 
under every variety of temperature. We will examine, 
in detail, how these little leaf-rollers accomplish their 
task. 

One of the most common as well as the most 
simple fabrics constructed by caterpillars, may be dis- 
covered during summer on almost every kind of 
bush and tree. We shall take as examples those 
which are found on the lilac, and on the oak. 

A small but very pretty chocolate-coloured moth, 




Lilac-tree Moth. (Lazotccnia Ribeanct, Stephens ?) 

abundant in every garden, but not readily seen from 
its frequently alighting on the ground which is so 
nearly of its own colour, deposits its eggs on the 
leaves of the lilac, and of some other trees, appro- 
priating a leaf to each egg. As soon as the cater- 
pillar is hatched, it begins to secure itself from birds 
and predatory insects by rolling up the lilac leaf into 







the form of a gallery, where it may feed in safety. 
We have repeatedly seen one of them when just 
escaped from the egg, and only a few lines long, 
fix several silk threads from one edge of a leaf, to 
the other, or from the edge to the mid -rib. ‘Then 
going to the middle of the space, he shortened the 
threads by bending them with his feet, and conse- 
quently pulled the edges of the leaves into a circular 
form ; and he retained them in that position by glue- 
ing down each thread as he shortened it. In their 
younger state, those caterpillars seldom roll more 
than a small portion of the leaf ; but when farther 
advanced, they unite the two edges together in their 
whole extent, Avith the exception of a small opening 
at one end, by which an exit may be made in case 
of need. 




Nest of a Lilac-leaf Roller. 

Another species of caterpillar closely allied to this, 
rolls up the lilac-leaves in a different form, beginning 
at the end of a leaf, and fixing and pulling its threads 
till it gets it nearly into the shape of a scroll of 
parchment. To retain this form more securely, it is 

 



not contented, like the former insect, with threads 
fixed on the inside of the leaf ; but has also recourse 
to a few cables which it weaves on the outside. 



Another species of moth allied to the two pre- 
ceding, is of a pretty green colour, and lays its eggs 



upon the leaves of the oak. This caterpillar folds 
them up in a similar manner, but with this difference, 
that it works on the under surface of the leat, pulling 
the edge downwards and backwards, instead of for- 
wards and upwards. This species is very abundant.

and may readily be found as soon as the leaves ex- 
pand. In June, when the perfect insect has ap- 
peared, by beating a branch of an oak, a whole shower 
of these pretty green moths may be shook into the air. 

Among the leaf-rolling caterpillars, there is a 
small dark-brown one, with a black head and six 
feet, very common in gardens on the currant-bush, 
or the leaves of the rose-tree. ( Lozotcevia Rosana t 
Stephens.) It is exceedingly destructive to the 
flower-buds. The eggs are deposited in the summer, 
and probably also in the autumn or in spring, in 
little oval or circular patches of a green colour. The 
grub makes its appearance with the first opening of 
the leaves, of whose structure in the half-expanded 
state it takes advantage to construct its summer tent. 
It is not, like some of the other leaf-rollers, contented 






with a single leaf, but weaves together as many as 
there are in the bud where it may chance to have been 
hatched, binding their discs so firmly with silk, that 
all the force of the ascending sap, and the increasing 
growth of the leaves cannot break through ; a farther 
expansion is of course prevented. The little inhabi- 
tant in the mean while banquets securely on the par- 
titions of its tent, eating door-ways from one apart- 
ment into another, through which it can escape in 
case of danger or disturbance. 

The leafits of the rose, it may be remarked, expand 
in nearly the same manner as a fan, and the opera- 
tions of this ingenious little insect retain them in the 
form of a fan nearly shut. Sometimes, however, it 
is not contented with one bundle of leafits, but by 
means of its silken cords unites all which spring from 
the same bud into a rain-proof canopy, under the 
protection of which it can feast on the flower-bud, 
and prevent it from ever blowing. 

In the instance, of the currant leaves, the proceed- 
ings of the grub are the same, but it cannot unite the 
plaits so smoothly as in the case of the rose leafits, 
and it requires more labour also, as the nerv- 
ures being stiff, demand a greater effort to bend 
them. When all the exertions of the insect prove 
unavailing: in its endeavours to draw the edges of a 
leaf together, it bends them inwards as far as it can, 
and weaves a close web of silk over the open space 
between. This is well exemplified in one of the 
commonest of our leaf-rolling caterpillars, which may 
be found as early as February on the leaves of the 
nettle and the white archangel ( Lamiuni album.) 
It is of a light dirty-green colour, spotted with black, 
and covered with a few hairs. In its young state it 
confines itself to the bosom of a small leaf, near the 
insertion of the leaf-stalk, partly bending the edges 
inwards, and covering in the interval with a silken 







curtain. As this sort of covering is not sufficient for 
concealment when the animal advances in growth, it 
abandons the base of the leaf for the middle, where 
it doubles up one side in a very secure and ingenious 
manner, 




Nest of the nettle leaf-rolling Caterpillar . 

We have watched this little architect begin and finish 
his tent upon a nettle in our study, the whole opera- 
tion taking more than half an hour *. He began by 
walking over the plant in all directions, examining the 
leaves severally, as if to ascertain which was best fitted 
for his purpose by being pliable, and bending with the 
weight of his body. Having found one to his mind, 
he placed himself along the mid-rib, to the edge of 
which he secured himself firmly with the pro-legs of 
his tail ; then stretching his head to the edge of the 
leaf, he fixed a series of parallel cables between it and 
the mid-rib, with another series crossing these at an 
acute angle. The position in which he worked was 
most remarkable, for he did not, as might have been 
supposed, spin his cables with his face to the leaf, 
but throwing himself on his back, which was turned 
towards the leaf, he hung with his whole weight by 
his first-made cables. This, by drawing them into 
the form of a curve, shortened them, and conse- 
quently pulled the edge of the leaf down towards the 
mid-rib. The weight of his body was not, however, 
the only power which he employed ; for, using the 
anal pro-legs as a point of support, he exerted the 

* J. R. 


 



whole muscles of his body to shorten his threads, 
and pull down the edge of the leaf. When he had 
drawn the threads as tight as he could, he held 
them till he spun fresh ones of sufficient strength to 
retain the leaf in the bent position into which he had 
pulled it. He then left the first series to hang loose 
while he shortened the fresh spun ones as before. 
This process was continued till he had worked down 
about an inch and a half of the leaf, as much as he 
deemed sufficient for his habitation. This was the 
first part of the architecture. 

By the time he had worked to the end of the fold 
he had brought the edge of the leaf to touch the 
mid-rib ; but it was only held in this position by a 
few of the last spun threads, for all the first spun 
ones hung loose within. Apparently aware of this, 
the insect protruded more than half of its body 
through the small aperture left at the end, and spun 
several bundles of threads on the outside precisely 
similar to those ropes of a tent which extend beyond 
the canvass, and are pegged into the ground. Un- 
willing to trust the exposure of his whole body 
on the outside, lest he should be seized by the 
first sand- wasp ( odyjierus ) or sparrow which might 
descry him, he now withdrew to complete the internal 
portion of his dwelling, where the threads were hang- 
ing loose and disorderly. For this purpose he turned 
his head about, and proceeded precisely as he had 
done at the beginning of his task, but taking care to 
spin his new threads so as to leave the loose ones on 
the outside, and make his apartment smooth and 
neat. When he again reached the opposite end, he 
constructed there also a similar series of cables on 
the outside, and then withdrew to give some final 
touches to the interior. 

It is said by Kirby and Spence *, that when these 
* Introd. vol. i, p. 457. 







leaf-rolling insects find that the larger nervures of 
the leaves are so strong as to prevent them from 
bending, they “ weaken it by gnawing it here and 
there half through.” We have never observed the 
circumstance, though we have witnessed the process 
in some hundreds of instances ; and we doubt the 
statement, from the careful survey which the insect 
makes of the capabilities of the leaf before the oper- 
ation is begun. If she found upon examination that 
a leaf would not bend, she would reject it, as we have 
often seen happen, and pass to another *. 

A species of leaf-roller, of the most diminutive 
size, merits particular mention, although it is not 
remarkable in colour or figure. It is without hair, 
of a greenish white, and has all the vivacity of the 
other leaf-rollers. Sorrel is the plant on which it 
feeds ; and the manner in which it rolls a portion of 
the leaf is very ingenious. 

The structure which it contrives is a sort of conical 
pyramid, composed of five or six folds lapped round 
each other. From the position of this little cone the 
caterpillar has other labours to perform, beside that 
of rolling the leaf. It first cuts across the leaf, its 
teeth acting as a pair of scissors ; but it does not 
entirely detach this segment. It rolls it up very gra- 
dually, by attaching threads of silk to the plane sur- 
face of the leaf, as we have before seen ; and then, 
having cut in a different direction, sets the cone 
upright, by weaving other threads, attached to the 
centre of the roll and the plane of the leaf, upon 
which it throws the weight of its body. This, it 
will be readily seen, is a somewhat complicated effort 
of mechanical skill. It has been minutely described 
by M. Reaumur; but the following representation 



* J. R. 






will perhaps make the process clearer than a more 
detailed account 




Leaf-rollinj Caterpillars of the Sorrel. 



This caterpillar, like those of which we have 
already spoken, devours all the interior of the roller. 
It weaves, also, in the interior, a small and thin co- 
coon of white silk, the tissue of which is made com- 
pact and close. It is then transformed into a chry- 
salis. 

The caterpillars of two of our largest and hand- 
somest butterflies, the Painted Lady ( Cynthia cardui, 
Stephens), and the Admirable, or Alderman of the 
London fly-fanciers ( Vanessa atalanta ), are also leaf- 
rollers. The first selects the leaves of the great spear- 
thistle, and sometimes those of the stemless, or star- 
thistle, which might be supposed rather difficult to 
bend ; but the caterpillar is four times as large and 
strong as those which we have been hitherto de- 
scribing. In some seasons it is plentiful ; in others 
it is rarely to be met with : but the Admirable is 
seldom scarce in any part of the country ; and by 







examining the leaves of nettles which appear folded 
edge to edge, in July and August, the caterpillar may 
be readily found. 




Nests of the Hesperia Malvce, with Caterpillar , Chrysalis , and Butterflies. 

Another butterfly ( Hesperia malvfs) is met with 
on dry banks where mallows grow, in May, or even 
earlier, and also in August, but is not indigenous. 
The caterpillar, which is grey, with a black head, 
and four sulphur-coloured spots on the neck, folds 
around it the leaves of the mallow, upon which 
it feeds. There is nothing, however, peculiarly 
different in its proceedings from those above de- 
scribed ; but the care with which it selects and rolls 
up one of the smaller leaves, when it is about to be 
transformed into a chrysalis, is worthy of remark ; it 





joins it, indeed, so completely round and round, that 
it has somewhat the resemblance of an egg. Within 
this green cell it lies secure, till the time arrives 
when it is ready to burst its cerements, and trust to 
the quickness of its wings for protection against its 
enemies. 

Among the nests of caterpillars which roll up par- 
cels of leaves, we know none so well contrived as 
those which are found upon willows and a species 
of osier. The lono* and narrow leaves of these 
plants are naturally adapted to be adjusted pa- 
rallel to each other ; for this is the direction which

they have at the end of each stalk, when they are not 
entirely developed. One kind of small smooth cater- 
pillar ( Tortrix chlorana ), with sixteen feet, the 
under part of which is brown, and streaked with 
white, fastens these leaves together, and makes them 
up into parcels. There is nothing particularly strik- 
imr in the mechanical manner in which it constructs 
them. It does precisely what we should do in a 
similar case : it winds a thread round those leaves 
which must be kept together, from a little above their 
termination to a very short distance from their ex- 
treme point ; and as it finds the leaves almost con- 
stantly lying near each other, it has little difficulty in 
bringing them together, as is shewn in the cut, a. 

The prettiest of these parcels are those which are 
made upon a kind of osier, the borders of whose 
leaves sometimes form columnar bundles before they 
are become developed. A section of these leaves has 
the appearance of fillagree work. — (See b, p. 170.) 

A caterpillar which feeds upon the willow, and 
whose singular attitudes have obtained for it the trivial 
name of Ziczac, also constructs for itself an arbour 
of the leaves, by drawing them together in an inge- 
nious manner. M. Roesel * has given a tolerable 
representation of this nest, and of the caterpillar. 
The caterpillar is found in June; and the moth ( No - 
todonta ziczac) from May to July in the following 
year. — (See cut, p. 172.) 

Beside those caterpillars which live solitary in the 
folds of a leaf, there are others which associate, em- 
ploying their united powers to draw the leaves of the 
plants they feed upon into a covering for their com- 
mon protection. Among these we may mention the 
caterpillar of a small butterfly, the plantain or Glan-

Q 2 




Ziczac Caterpillar and Nest. 

Although a colony of these caterpillars is not nu- 
merous, seldom amounting to a hundred individuals, 
the place which they have selected is not hard to dis- 
cover. Their abode may be seen in the meadow in 
form of a tuft of herbage covered with a white web, 
which may readily be mistaken, at first view, for that 
of a spider, but closer inspection soon corrects this 
notion. It is, in fact, a sort of common tent, in 
which the whole brood lives, eats, and undergoes the 
usual transformations. The shape of this tent, for 







ville fritillary ( Melitea cinxia ), which is very scarce 
in this country. 







the most part, approaches the pyramidal, though that 
depends much upon the natural growth of the her- 
bage which composes it. The interior is divided into 
compartments formed by the union of several small 
tents, as it were, to which others have been from time 
to time added according to the necessities of the com- 
munity. 

When they have devoured all the leaves, or at 
least those which are most tender and succulent, 
they abandon their first camp, and construct another 
contiguous to it under a tuft of fresh leaves. Several 
of these encampments may sometimes be seen within 
the distance of a foot or two, when they can find 
plantain ( Plantago lanceolata) fit for their purpose ; 
but though they prefer this plant, they content them- 
selves with grass if it is not to be procured. 

When they are about to cast their skins, but par- 
ticularly when they perceive the approach of winter, 
they construct a more durable apartment in the inte- 
rior of their principal tent. The ordinary web is 
thin and semi-transparent, permitting the leaves to 
be seen through it ; but their winter canvass, if we 
may call it so, is thick, strong, and quite opaque, 
forming a sort of circular hall without any partition, 
where the whole community lie coiled up and huddled 
together. 

Early in spring they issue forth in search of fresh 
food, and again construct tents to protect them from 
cold and rain, and from the mid-day sun. 

M. Reaumur found upon trial, that it was not only 
the caterpillars hatched from the eggs of the same 
mother which would unite in constructing the com- 
mon tent; for different broods, when put together, 
worked in the same social and harmonious manner. 
We ourselves ascertained, during the present sum- 
mer, (1829,) that this principle of sociality is not 
confined to the same species, nor even to the same 





genus. The experiment which we tried was to con- 
fine two broods of different species to the same branch 
by placing it in a glass of water to prevent their 
escape. The caterpillars which we experimented on 
were several broods of the brown-tail moth ( Porthesia 
auriflua), and the lackey ( Clisiocampa neustria). 
These we found to work with as much industry and 
harmony in constructing the common tent as if they 
had been at liberty on their native trees ; and when 
the lackeys encountered the brown-tails they mani- 
fested no alarm nor uneasiness, but passed over the 
backs of one another as if they had made only a por- 
tion of the branch. In none of their operations did 
they seem to be subject to any discipline, each indi- 
vidual appearing to work, in perfecting the structure, 
from individual instinct, in the same manner as was 
remarked by M. Huber, in the case of the hive-bees*. 
In making such experiments, it is obvious, that the 
species of caterpillars experimented with must feed 
upon the same sort of plant j\i 

The design of the caterpillars in rolling up the 
leaves is not only to conceal themselves from birds 
and predatory insects, but also to protect them- 
selves from the cuckoo-flies, which lie in wait in every 
quarter to deposit their eggs in their bodies, that their 
progeny may devour them. Their mode of conceal- 
ment, however, though it appear to be cunningly 
contrived and skilfully executed, is not always suc- 
cessful, their enemies often discovering their hiding 
place. We happened to see a remarkable instance of 
this last summer (182S), in the case of one of the 
lilac caterpillars which had changed into a chrysalis 
within the closely folded leaf. A small cuckoo-fly, 
aware, it should seem, of the very spot where the 
chrysalis lay within the leaf, was seen boring through 



* See p. 115, 







it with her ovipositor, and introducing her eggs 
through the punctures thus made into the body of the 
dormant insect. We allowed her to lay all her eggs, 
about six in number, and then put the leaf under an 
inverted glass. In a few days the eggs of the cuckoo- 
fly were hatched, the grubs devoured the lilac chry- 
salis, and finally changed into pupae in a case of yel- 
low silk, and into perfect insects like their parent *. 

* J. R. 





The habitations of the insects which we have just 
described consist of growing leaves, bent, rolled, 
or pressed together, and fixed in their positions by 
silken threads. But there are other habitations of a 
similar kind which are constructed by cutting out 
and detaching a whole leaf, or a portion of a leaf. We 
have already seen how dexterously the upholsterer- 
bees cut out small parts of leaves and petals with 
their mandibles, and fit them into their cells. Some 
of the caterpillars do not exhibit quite so much neat- 
ness and elegance as the leaf-cutting bees, though 
their structures answer all the purposes intended ; 
but there are others, as we shall presently see, that 
far excel the bees, at least, in the delicate minutiae 
of their workmanship. We shall first advert to 
those structures which are the most simple. 

Not far from Longchamps, in a road through the 
Bois de Boulogne, is a large marsh, which M. Reau- 
mur never observed to be in a dry state even during 
summer. This marsh is surrounded with very lofty 
oaks, and abounds with pondweed, the water plant 
named by botanists potamogeto/i. The shining- 
leaves of this plant, which are as large as those of 
the laurel or orange-tree, but thicker and more 
fleshy, are spread upon the surface of the water. 
H aving pulled up several of these, about the middle 
of June, M. Reaumur observed, beneath one of the 







first which he examined, an elevation of an oval 
shape, which was formed out of a leaf of the same 
plant. He carefully examined it, and discovered 
that threads of silk were attached to this elevation. 
Breaking the threads, he raised up one of the ends, 
and saw a cavity in which a caterpillar ( Hydrocampa 
Potamogata ) was lodged. An indefatigable ob- 
server, such as M. Reaumur, would naturally follow 
up this discovery ; and he has accordingly given us 
a memoir of the pondweed tent-maker, distinguished 
by his usual minute accuracy. 

In order to make a new cocoon, the caterpillar 
fastens itself on the underside of a leaf of the Pota- 
mogeton. With its mandibles it pierces some part of 
this leaf, and afterwards gradually gnaws a curve 
line, marking the form of the piece which it wishes to 
detach. When the caterpillar has cut off, as from a piece 
of cloth, a patch of leaf of the size and shape suited 
to its purpose, it is provided with half of the mate- 
rials requisite for making a tent. It takes hold of 
this piece by its mandibles, and conveys it to the 
situation on the underside of its own, or another 

I leaf, whichever is found most appropriate. It is there 
disposed, in such a manner, that the underpart of 
the patch — the side which was the underpart of the 
entire leaf — is turned towards the underpart of the 
new leaf, so that the inner walls of the cocoon are 
always made by the underpart of two portions of 
leaf. The leaves of the potamogeton are a little con- 
cave on the underside ; and thus the caterpillar pro- 
duces a hollow cell, though the rims are united. 

The caterpillar secures the leaf in its position by 
threads of white silk. It then weaves a cocoon in 
the cavity which is somewhat thin, but of very close 
tissue. There it shuts itself up to appear again only 
in the form of the perfect insect, and is soon trans- 
formed into a chrysalis. In this cocoon of silk no 






point touches the water ; whilst the cocoon of leaves, 
lined with silk, has been constructed underneath the 
water. This fact proves that the caterpillar has a 
particular art by which it repels the water from be- 
tween the leaves. . 

When the caterpillar, which has thus conveyed, and 
disposed a patch of leaf against another leaf, is not 
ready to be transformed into a chrysalis, it applies 
itself to make a cocoon — a habitation which it may 
carry everywhere about with it. It begins by slightly 
fixing the piece against the whole leaf, leaving inter- 
vals all round, between the piece and leaf, at which 
it may project its head. The piece which it has 
fixed serves as a model for cutting out a similar 
piece in the other leaf. The caterpillar puts them 
accurately together, except at one end of the oval, 
where an opening is left for the insect to project its 
head through When the caterpillar is inclined to 
change its situation, it draws itself forward by means 
of its scaly limbs rivetted upon the leaf. The mem- 
branous limbs which are rivetted against the inner 
sides of the cocoon, oblige it to follow the anterior 
part of the body, as it advances. The caterpillar, 
also, puts its head out of the cocoon every time it 
desires to eat. 

There is found on the common chick-weed ( Stel - 
laria media ) towards the end of July, a middle-sized 
smooth green caterpillar, having three brown spots 
bordered with white on the back, and six leo-s and 
ten pro-legs, whose architecture is worthy of obser- 
vation. When it is about to go into chrysalis, to- 
wards the beginning of August, it gnaws off, one by 
one, a number of the leaves and smaller twigs of the 
chick-weed, and adjusts them into an oval cocoon, 
somewhat rough and unfinished, externally, but 
smooth, uniform, and finely tapestried with white 
silk within. Here it undergoes its transformations 







securely, and when the period of its pupa trance has 
expired in the following- July, it makes its exit in the 
form of a yellowish moth, with several brown spots 
above, and a brown band on each of its four wings 
below. It is also furnished with a sort of tail. 

On the cypress spurge ( Euphorbia cyparissias ), 
a native woodland plant, but not of very common 
occurrence, may be found, towards the end of Octo- 
ber, a caterpillar of a middle size, sparely tufted 
with hair, and striped with black, white, red, and 
brown. The leaves of the plant which are in the 
form of short narrow blades of grass, are made choice 
of by the caterpillar to construct its cocoon, which it 
does with great neatness and regularity, the end of 
each leaf, after it has been detached from the plant, 
being fixed to the stem, and the other leaves placed 
parallel, as they are successively added. The other 
ends of all these are bent inwards, so as to form a 
uniformly rounded oblong figure, somewhat larger 
at one end than at the other. 




Cypress-Spurge Caterpillar— (Acronycta Euphrasia; ?)—with a Cocoon , 

on a branch. 

A caterpillar which builds a very similar cocoon 
to the last mentioned, may be found upon a more 
common plant— the yellow snap-dragon or toad-flax 







( Antirrhinum linaria ) — which is to be seen in almost 
every hedge. It is somewhat shaped like a leech, is 
of a middle size, and the prevailing colour pearl-grey, 
but striped with yellow and black. It spins up 
about the beginning of September, forming the outer 
coating of pieces of detached leaves of the plant, and 
sometimes of whole leaves placed longitudinally, the 
whole disposed with great symmetry and neatness. 
The moth appears in the following June. 

It is worthy of remark, as one of the most 
striking instances of instinctive foresight, that the 
caterpillars which build structures of this substantial 
description, are destined to lie much longer in their 
chrysalis trance, than those which spin merely a 
flimsy web of silk. For the most part, indeed, the 
latter undergo their final transformation in a few 
weeks; while the former continue entranced the larger 
portion of a year, appearing in the perfect state the 
summer after their architectural labours have been 
completed.* This is a remarkable example of the 
instinct which leads these little creatures to act with 
a foresight in many cases much clearer than the 
dictates of human prudence. In the examples be- 
fore us, the instinct is more delicate and complex 
than that which directs other animals to provide a 
burrow for their winter sleep. It is not unreasonable 
to suppose that the one caterpillar is aware, while it 
is building the cocoon, that the moth into which it 
is about to be changed will not be in a fit state to 
appear before the succeeding summer. The other, 
pursuing a similar course of thought, may feel that 
the moth will see the light in a few weeks. The 
comparative distances of time certainly appear most 
difficult to be understood by an insect ; for, as far as 
we know, quadrupeds do not carry their intelligence 
to such an extent. And yet in the solitary case of 

* J. R. 







provision for a future progeny, the instinct is in- 
variably subtle and extraordinary. What, for in- 
stance, is more remarkable than that the insect should 
always place her eggs where her progeny will find 
the food which is best suited to their nature ? In 
almost no case does the perfect insect eat that 
food, so that the parent cannot judge from her own 
habits. The Contriver of the mechanism by which 
insects work also directs the instinct by which they 
use their tools. 

It is exceedingly difficult, with our very limited 
knowledge of the springs of action in the inferior 
animals, to determine the motives of their industry — 
that is, whether they see clearly the end and object 
of their arrangements. A human architect, in all his 
plans, has regard, according to the extent of his skill, 
to the combination of beauty and convenience ; and 
in mpst cases he has adaptations peculiar to the cir- 
cumstances connected with the purpose of the struc- 
ture. In the erection of a common dwelling-house, 
for instance, one family requires many sleeping- 
rooms, another few — one wants its drawing-rooms 
in a suite, another detached. The architect knows all 
these wants, and provides for them. But all insects 
build their habitations upon the same general model, 
although they can slightly vary them according to 
circumstances. Thus, according as the uniformity, 
or the occasional adaptation of their work to particu- 
lar situations, has been most regarded by those who 
speculate upon their actions, they have been held to 
be wholly governed by instinct or by intelligence — 
have been called machines or free agents. There are 
difficulties in either conclusion ; and the truth perhaps 
lies between the two opinions. Their actions may 
entirely result from their organization ; they are cer- 
tainly in conformity with it. Those who would deny 
the animal all intelligence, by which we mean a power, 

R 







resulting from selection, of deviating in small matters 
from a precise rule of action, are often materialists, 
who shut their eyes to the creating and preserving 
economy of Providence. But even this belief in the 
infallible results of organization does not necessarily 
imply the disbelief of a presiding Power. “ The 
same wisdom,” says Bonnet, “ which has constructed 
and arranged with so much art the various organs 
of animals, and has made them concur towards 
one determined end, has also provided that the dif- 
ferent operations which are the natural results of the 
economy of the animal should concur towards the 
same end. The creature is directed towards his ob- 
ject by an invisible hand ; he executes with precision, 
and by one effort, those works which we so much 
admire ; he appears to act as if he reasoned, to 
return to his labour at the proper time, to change 
his scheme in case of need. But in all this he only 
obeys the secret influence which drives him on. He 
is but an instrument which cannot judge of each 
action, but is wound up by that adorable Intelli- 
gence, which has traced out for every insect its pro- 
per labours, as he has traced the orbit of each 
planet. When, therefore, I see an insect working at 
the construction of a nest, or a cocoon, I am im- 
pressed with respect, because it seems to me that I 
am at a spectacle where the Supreme Artist is hid

There is a small sort of caterpillar which may be 
found on old walls, feeding upon minute mosses and 
lichens, the proceedings of which are well worthy of 
attention. They are similar, in appearance and size, 
to the caterpillar of the small cabbage-butterfly 
( Pontia rapce ), and are smooth and bluish. The 
material which they use in building their cocoons is

composed of the leaves and branchlets of green moss, 
which they cut into suitable pieces, detaching at the 
same time along with them a portion of the earth in 
which they grow. They arrange these upon the 
walls of their building with the moss on the outside, 
and the earth on the inside, making a sort of vault 
of the tiny bits of green moss turf, dug from the 
surface of the wall. So neatly, also, are the several 
pieces joined, that the whole might well be supposed 
to be a patch of moss which had grown in form of 
an oval tuft, a little more elevated than the rest 
growing on the wall. When these caterpillars are 
shut up in a box with some moss, without earth, 
they construct with it cells in form of a hollow ball, 
very prettily plaited and interwoven. 




Moss-Cell of Small Caterpillar ( Bryophilaperla ?) 



In May last (1829), we found on the walls of 
Greenwich Park, a great number of caterpillars 
whose manners bore some resemblance to those of 
the grub described by M. Reaumur*. They were 
of middle size, with a dull orange stripe along the 
back ; the head and sides of the body black, and the 
belly greenish. Their abodes were constructed with 
ingenuity and care. A caterpillar of this sort ap- 
pears to choose either a part where the mortar con- 
tains a cavity, or it digs one suited to its design. 
Over the opening of the hollow in the mortar, it

builds an arched wall so as to form a chamber consi- 
derably larger than is usual with other architect ca- 
terpillars. It selects grains of mortar, brick, or 
lichen, fixing them, by means of silk, firmly into the 
structure. As some of these vaulted walls were 
from an inch to an inch and a half long, and about a 
third of an inch wide and deep, it may be well 
imagined that it would require no little industry and 
labour to complete the work. Yet it does not de- 
mand more than a few hours for the insect to raise it 
from the foundation. Like all other insect architects, 
this caterpillar uses its own body for a measuring 
rule, and partly for a mould, or rather a block or 
centre to shape the walls by, curving itself round and 
round concentrically with the arch which it is building. 

We afterwards found one of these caterpillars 
which had dug a cell in one of the softest of the 
bricks, covering itself on the outside with an arched 
wall of brick dust, cemented with silk. As this brick 
was of a bright red colour, we were thereby able to 
ascertain that there was not a particle of lichen em- 
ployed in the structure. 

The neatness mentioned by Reaumur, as remark- 
able in his moss-building caterpillars, is equally ob- 
servable in that which we have just described ; for, on 
looking at the surface of the wall, it would be impos- 
sible for a person unacquainted with these structures 
to detect where they were placed, as they are usually, 
on the outside, level with the adjoining brick-work, and 
it is only when they are opened by the entomologist, 
that the little architect is perceived lying snug in his 
chamber. If a portion of the wall be thus broken 
down, the caterpillar loses no time in repairing the 
breach, by piecing in bits of mortar and fragments of 
lichen, till we can scarcely distinguish the new por- 
tion from the old. 





There is a very interesting class of grubs which 
live under water, where they construct for themselves 
moveable tents of various materials as their habits 
direct them, or as the substances they require can be 
conveniently procured. Among the materials used 
by these singular grubs, well known to fishermen by 
the name of caddis-worms , and to naturalists as the 
larvce of the four-winged flies in the order Trichop- 
tera, we may mention sand, stones, shells, wood, and 
leaves, which are skilfully joinedand strongly cemented. 
One of these grubs forms a pretty case of leaves 
glued together longitudinally, but leaving an aper- 
ture sufficiently large for the inhabitant to put out its 
head and shoulders when it wishes to look about for

food. Another employs pieces of reed cut into con- 
venient lengths, or of grass, straw, wood, &c., care- 
fully joining and cementing each piece to its fellpw 
as the work proceeds ; and he frequently finishes the 








Reed Nest of Caddis- Worn, 







whole by adding a broad piece longer than the rest 
to shade his door-way over-head, so that he may not 
be seen from above. A more laborious structure is 
reared by the grub of a beautiful caddis-fly ( Phry - 
ganea), which weaves together a group of the leaves 
of aquatic plants into a roundish ball, and in the in- 
terior of this forms a cell for its abode. The fol- 
lowing figure from Roesel will give a more precise 
notion of this structure than a lengthened description. 




Another of these aquatic architects makes choice 
of the tiny shells of young fresh-water mussels and 
snails ( [Planorbis ), to form a moveable grotto, and 
as these little shells are for the most part inhabited, 
he keeps the poor animals close prisoners, and drags

them without mercy along’ with him. These grotto- 
building’ grubs are by no means uncommon in ponds ; 
and in chalk districts, such as the country about 
Woolwich and Gravesend, they are very abundant. 

One of the most surprising instances of their 
skill occurs in the structures of which small stones 
are the principal material. The problem is to make 
a tube about the width of the hollow of a wheat 
straw or a crow quill, and equally smooth and 
uniform. Now the materials being small stones full 
of angles and irregularities, the difficulty of per- 
forming this problem will appear to be considerable, 
if not insurmountable ; yet the little architects, by 
patiently examining their stones and turning them 
round on every side, never fail to accomplish their 
plans. This, however, is only part of the pro- 








blem, which is complicated with another condition, 
and which we have not found recorded by former 
observers, namely, that the under surface shall be 
flat and smooth, without any projecting angles which 
might impede its progress when dragged along the 
bottom of the rivulet where it resides. The selection 
of the stones, indeed, may be accounted for, from this 
species living in streams where, but for the weight of 
its house, it Avould to a certainty be swept away. For 
this purpose, it is probable that the grub makes 
choice of larger stones than it might otherwise want ; 
and therefore also it is that we frequently find a case 
composed of very small stones and sand, to which 




Sand Nest balanced with a Stone. 







when nearly finished, a large stone is added by way 
of ballast. In other instances, when the materials 
are found to possess too great specific gravity, a bit 
of light wood, or a hollow straw, is added to buoy 
up the case.

It is worthy of remark, that the cement, used 
in all these cases, is superior to pozzolana * in stand- 
ing water, in which it is indissoluble. The grubs 
themselves are also admirably adapted for their 
mode of life, the portion of their bodies which is always 
enclosed in the case, being soft like a meal-worm, or 
garden caterpillar, while the head and shoulders, 
which are for the most part projected beyond the 
door-way in search of food, are firm, hard, and con- 
sequently less liable to injury than the protected por- 
tion, should it chance to be exposed. 

We have repeatedly tried experiments with the in- 
habitants of those aquatic tents, to ascertain their 
mode of building. We have deprived them of their 
little houses, and furnished them with materials for 
constructing new ones, watching their proceedings 
from their laying the first stone or shell of the struc- 
ture. They work at the commencement in a very 
clumsy manner , attaching a great number of chips 
to whatever materials may be within their reach with 
loose threads of silk, and many of these they never 
use at all in their perfect building. They act, indeed, 
much like an unskilful workman trying his hand be- 
fore committing himself upon an intended work of 
difficult execution. Their main intention is, however, 
to have abundance of materials within reach : for 
after their dwelling is fairly begun, they shut them

selves up in it, and do not again protrude more than 
half of their body to procure materials; and even 
when they have dragged a stone, a shell, or a chip of 
reed within building reach, they have often to reject it 
as unfit*. 

Carpenter-Caterpillars. 

Insects, though sometimes actuated by an instinct 
apparently blind, unintelligent, or unknown to them- 
selves, manifest in other instances a remarkable adap- 
tation of means to ends. We have it in our power to 
exemplify this in a striking manner by the proceed- 
ings of the caterpillar of a goat-moth ( Cossus ligni- 
perda ) which we kept till it underwent its final 
change. 




Caterpillar of Goat-Moth in a JVillow Tree. 



This caterpillar, which abounds in Kent and many 
other parts of the island, feeds on the wood of 
willows, oaks, poplars, and other trees, in which it 
eats extensive galleries ; but it is not contented with 
the protection afforded by these galleries during 

* J. R. 







the colder months of winter, before the arrival of 
which it scoops out a hollow in the tree, if it do not 
find one ready prepared, sufficiently large to contain 
its body in a bent or somewhat coiled up position. 
On sawing off a portion of an old poplar in the 
winter of 1827, we found such a cell with a cater- 
pillar coiled up in it. 




JVinter Nest of the Goat-Caterpillar. 



It had not, however, been contented with the bare 
walls of the retreat which it had hewn out of the tree, 
for it had lined it with a fabric as thick as coarse 
broad-cloth, and equally warm, composed of the rasp- 
ings of the wood scooped out of the cell, united with the 
strong silk which every species of caterpillar can spin. 
In this snug retreat our caterpillar, if it had not been 
disturbed, would have spent the winter without eat- 
ing ; but upon being removed into a warm room and 
placed under a glass along with some piece's of wood, 
which it might eat if so inclined, it was roused for a 
time from its dormant state, and began to move 
about. It was not long, however, in constructing a 
new cell for itself, no less ingenious that the former. 
It either could not gnaw into the fir plank, where it 
was now placed with a glass above it, or it did not 
choose to do so ; for it left it untouched, and made it 
the basis of the edifice it began to construct. It 







formed, in fact, a covering; for itself precisely like the 
one from which we had dislodged it, — composed of 
raspings of wood detached for the purpose from 
what had been given it as food, — the largest piece of 
which was employed as a substantial covering and 
protection for the whole. It remained in this retreat, 
motionless, and without food, till revived by the 
warmth of the ensuing spring, when it gnawed its 
way out, and began to eat voraciously, to make up 
for its long fast. 

These caterpillars are three years in arriving at 
their final change into the winged state ; but as the 
one just mentioned was nearly full grown, it began, 
in the month of May, to prepare a cell, in which it 
might undergo its metamorphosis. Whether it had 
actually improved its skill in architecture by its pre- 
vious experience we will not undertake to say, but its 
second cell was greatly superior to the first. In the 
first there was only one large piece of wood em- 
ployed ; in the second, two pieces were placed in 
such a maimer as to support each other, and beneath 
the angle thus formed, an oblong structure was made, 
composed, as before, of wood-raspings and silk, but 
much stronger in texture than the winter cell. In a 
few weeks (four, if we recollect aright) the moth 
came forth*.

A wood-boring caterpillar, of a species of moth 
much rarer than the preceding ( ZEgeria asiliformis, 
Stephens), exhibits great ingenuity in construct- 
ing a cell for its metamorphosis. We observed 
above a dozen of them during this summer (1829) 
in the trunk of a poplar, one side of which had 
been stripped of its bark. It was this portion of 
the trunk which all the caterpillars selected for 
their final retreat, not one having been observed 
where the tree was covered with bark. The inge- 
nuity of the little architect consisted in scooping its 
cell almost to the very surface of the wood, leaving 
only an exterior covering of unbroken wood, as thin 
as writing paper. Previous, therefore, to the chry- 
salis making its way through this feeble barrier, it 
could not have been suspected that an insect was 
lodged under the smooth wood. We observed more 
than one of these in the act of breaking through this 
covering, within which there is besides a round move- 
able lid of a sort of brown wax*. 

Another architect caterpillar, frequently to be met 
with in July on the leaves of the willow and the 
poplar, is, in the fly state, called the Puss-Moth 
(Centra vinula). The caterpillar is produced from 
brown-coloured shining eggs, about the size of a 
pin’s head, which are deposited — one, two, or 
more together — on the upper surface of a leaf. 
In the course of six or eight weeks (during which 
time it casts its skin thrice) it arrives at its full

growth, when it is about as thick, and nearly as 
long, as a man’s thumb, and begins to prepare a 
structure in which the pupa may sleep securely 
during the winter. As we have, oftener than once, 
seen this little architect at work, from the foundation 
till the completion of its edifice, we are thereby ena- 
bled to give the details of the process. 

The puss, it may be remarked, does not depend 
for protection on the hole of a tree, or the shelter of 
an overhanging branch, but upon the solidity and 
strength of the fabric which it rears. The material 
it commonly uses is the bark of the tree upon which 
the cell is constructed ; but when this cannot be pro- 
cured, it is contented to employ whatever analogous 
materials may be within reach. One which we had 
shut up in a box substituted the marble paper 
it was lined with, for bark, which it could not pro- 
cure*. With silk it first wove a thin web round the 

* It is justly remarked by Reaumur, that when caterpillars 
are left at liberty among their native plants, it is only by lucky 
chance they can be observed building their cocoons, because the 
greater number abandon the plants upon which they have been 
feeding, to spin up in places at some distance. In order to see 
their operations they must be kept in confinement, particularly in 
boxes, wdth glazed doors, where they may be always under the eye 
of the naturalist. In such circumstances, however, we may be 
ignorant what building materials we ought to provide them with 
for their structures. A red caterpillar, with a few tufts of hair, 
which Reaumur found in July feeding upon the flower bunches 
of the nettle, and refusing to touch the leaves, began in a few days 
to prepare its cocoon, by gnawing the paper lid of the box in 
which it w : as placed. This, of course, was a material which it 
could not have procured in the fields, but it was the nearest in 
properties that it could procure ; for though it had the leaves and 
stems of nettles, it never used a single fragment of either. When 
Reaumur found that it was likely to gnaw through the paper lid 
of the box, and might effect its escape, he furnished it with bits 
of rumpled paper, fixed to the lid by means of a pin ; and these 
it chopped down into such pieces as it judged convenient for its 
structure, which it took a day to complete. The moth appeared 

S 







edges of the place which it marked out for its edi- 
fice ; then it ran several threads in a sparse manner 
from side to side, and from end to end, but very 
irregularly in point of arrangement : these were in- 
tended for the skeleton or frame-work of the building. 




When this outline was finished, the next step was to 
strengthen each thread of silk, by adding several 
(sometimes six or eight) parallel ones, all of which 
were then glued together into a single thread, by 
the insect running its mandibles, charged with 
gluten, along the line. The meshes, or spaces, 
which were thus widened by the compression of the 
parallel threads, were immediately filled up with 
fresh threads, till at length only very small spaces 
were left. It was in this stage of the operation that 
the paper came into requisition, small portions of it 
being gnawed off the box and glued into the meshes. 
It was not, however, into the meshes only that the 
bits of paper were inserted ; for the whole fabric was 
in the end thickly studded over with them. In about 
half a day from the first thread of the frame-work 
being spun the building was completed. It was at 
first, however, rather soft, and yielded to slight pres- 
sure with the finger ; but as soon as it became 

four weeks after, of a brownish-black colour, mottled with white, 
or rather grey, in the manner of lace. 

Bonnet also mentions more than one instance in which he 
observed caterpillars making use of paper, when they could not 
procure other materials. 







thoroughly dry, it was so hard that it could with 
difficulty be penetrated with the point of a penknife*. 



A question will here suggest itself to the curious 
inquirer, how the moth, which is not, like the cater- 
pillar, furnished with mandibles for gnawing, can find 
its way through so hard a wall. To resolve this 
question, it is asserted by recent naturalists (see Kirby 
and Spence, vol. iii. p. 15), that the moth is furnished 
with a peculiar acid for dissolving itself a passage. We 
have a specimen of the case of a puss-moth, in which, 
notwithstanding its strength, one of the ichneumons 
had contrived to deposit its eggs. In the beginning of 
summer, when we expected the moth to appear, and 
felt anxious to observe the recorded effects of the 
acid, we were astonished to find a large orange 
cuckoo-fly make its escape ; while another, which at- 
tempted to follow, stuck by the way and died. On 
detaching the cell from the box, we found several 
others, which had not been able to get out, and had 
died in their cocoons t.

Among' the carpenter-grubs may be mentioned 
that of the purple capricorn-beetle ( Callidium viola - 
ceurn ), of which the Rev. Mr. Kirby has given an 
interesting account in the fifth volume of the Lin- 
nean Transactions. This insect feeds principally 
on fir timber, which has been felled some time with- 
out having had the bark stripped off ; but it is often 
found on other wood. Though occasionally taken in 
this kingdom, it is supposed not to have been ori- 
ginally a native. The circumstance of this destruc- 
tive little animal attacking only such timber as had 
not been stripped of its bark ought to be attended 
to by all persons who have any concern in this article; 
for the bark is a temptation not only to this, but 
to various other insects ; and much of the injury 
done in timber might be prevented, if the trees were 
all barked as soon as they were felled. The female 
is furnished, at the posterior extremity of her body, 
with a flat retractile tube, which she inserts between 
the bark and the wood, to the depth of about a quar- 
ter of an inch, and there deposits a single egg. By 
stripping off the bark, it is easy to trace the whole 
progress of the grub, from the spot where it is 
hatched, to that where it attains its full size. It first 
proceeds in a serpentine direction, filling the space 
which it leaves with its excrement, resembling saw-dust, 
and so stopping all ingress to enemies from without. 
When it has arrived at its utmost dimensions, it does 
not confine itself to one direction, but works in a kind 
of labyrinth, eating backwards and forwards, which 
gives the wood under the bark a very irregular sur- 
face; by this means its paths are rendered of con- 
siderable width. The bed of its paths exhibits, when 
closely examined, a curious appearance, occasioned 
by the gnawings of its jaws, which excavate an infinity 
of little ramified canals. When the insect is about to 
assume its chrysalis state, it bores down obliquely 







into the solid wood, to the depth sometimes of three 
inches, and seldom if ever less than two, forming 
holes nearly semi-cylindrical, and of exactly the form 
of the grub which inhabits them. At first sight one 
would wonder how so small and seemingly so weak 
an animal could have strength to excavate so deep a 
mine ; but when we examine its jaws our wonder 
ceases. These are large, thick, and solid sections of a 
cone divided longitudinally, which, in the act of 
chewing, apply to each other the whole of their inte- 
rior plane surface, so that they grind the insect’s 
food like a pair of millstones. Some of the grubs are 
hatched in October ; and it is supposed that about 
the beginning of March they assume their chrysalis 
state. At the place in the bark, opposite to the hole 
from whence they descended into the wood, the per- 
fect insects gnaw their way out, which generally takes 
place betwixt the middle of May and the middle of 
June. These insects are supposed to fly only in 
the night, but during the day they may generally be 
found resting on the wood from which they were 
disclosed. The grubs are destitute of feet, pale, fold- 
ed, somewhat hairy, convex above, and divided into 
thirteen segments. Their head is large and convex.* 
It would not be easy to find a more striking ex- 
ample of ingenuity than occurs in a small caterpillar 
which may be found in May, on the oak, and is sup- 
posed, by Kirby and Spence, to be that of th ePyralis 
strigulalis. It is of a whitish yellow colour, tinged 
with a shade of carnation, and studded with tufts of 
red hairs, on each segment, and two brown spots be- 
hind the head. It has fourteen feet, and the upper 
part of its body is much flatter than is common in 
caterpillars. When this ingenious little insect begins 
to form its cell, it selects a smooth young branch 

* Kirby in Linn. Trans, vol. v. p. 246, and Introd. ii. 





of the oak, near an offgoing of the branchlets whose 
angle may afford it some protection. It then measures 
out, with its body for a rule, the space destined for 
its structure, the basement of which is of a triangular 
form, with the apex at the lower end. The building 
itself is composed of small rectangular strap-shaped 
pieces of the outer bark of the branch cut out from 
the immediate -vicinity ; the insect indeed never tra- 
vels farther for materials than the length of its own 
body. Upon the two longest sides of the triangular 
base it builds uniform walls, also of a triangular 
shape, and both gradually diverging from each other 
as they increase in height. These are formed with 
so much mathematical precision, that they fit exactly 
when they are afterwards brought into contact. As 
soon as the little architect has completed these walls, 
which resemble very much the feathers of an arrow,

it proceeds to draw them together in a manner si- 
milar to that which the leaf-rolling caterpillars employ 
in constructing their abodes, by pulling them with 
silken cords till they bend and converge. Even 
when the two longest sides are thus joined, there is 
an opening left at the upper end, which is united in 
a similar manner. When the whole is finished, it re- 
quires close inspection to distinguish it from the 
branch, being formed of the same materials, and 
having consequently the same colour and gloss. 
Concealment, indeed, may be supposed, with some 
justice, to be the final object of the insect in pro- 
ducing this appearance, the same principle being ex- 
tensively exemplified in numerous other instances. 


 

Many species of caterpillars are not only skilful 
in concealing themselves in their cocoons, but also 
in the concealment of the cocoon itself; so that 
even when that is large, as in the instance of the 
death’s-head hawk-moth ( Acherontia atropos ), it is 
almost impossible to find it. We allude to the 
numerous class of caterpillars which, previous to 
their changing into the pupa state, bury themselves 
in the earth. This circumstance would not be sur- 
prising, were it confined to those which are but too 
well known in gardens, from their feeding upon and 
destroying the roots of lettuce, chicory, and other 
plants, as they pass a considerable portion of their 
lives under ground ; nor is it surprising that those 
which retire under ground during the day, and come 
abroad to feed in the night, should form their cocoons 
where they have been in the habit of concealing 
themselves. But it is very singular and unexpected, 
that caterpillars, which pass the whole of their life on 
plants, and even on trees, should afterwards bury 
themselves in the earth. Yet, the fact is, that per- 
haps a greater number make their cocoons under 
than above ground, particularly those which are not 
clothed with hair. 

Some of those caterpillars, which go into the 
ground previous to their change, make no cocoon at 
all, but are contented with a rude masonry of earth 
as a nest for their pupae : into the details of their 
operations it will not be so necessary for us to 
go, as into those which exhibit more ingenuity 






and care. When one of the latter is dug* up, it 
has the appearance of nothing' more than a small 
clod of earth, of a roundish or oblong shape, but, 
generally, by no means uniform. The interior, how- 
ever, when it is laid open, always exhibits a cavity, 
smooth, polished, and regular, in which the cocoon, or 
the chrysalis lies secure. (Fig. p. 202, b). The polish 
of the interior is precisely such as might be given to soft 
earth by moistening and kneading it with great care. 
But beside this, it is usually lined with a tapestry of 
silk, more or less thick, though this cannot always 
be discovered without the aid of a magnifying glass. 
This species of caterpillars, as soon as they have 
completed their growth, go into the earth, scoop 
out, as the cossus does in wood, a hollow cell of an 
oblong form, and-line it with pellets of earth, from 
the size of a grain of sand to that of a pea — united, 
by silk or gluten, into a fabric more or less compact, 
according to the species, but all of them fitted for 
protecting the inhabitant, during its winter sleep, 
against cold and moisture. 




Outside View of Nests of Earth-mason Caterpillars. 



One of the examples of this occurs in the ghost- 
moth ( Hepialus humuh ), which, before it retires into 
the earth, feeds upon the roots of the hop or the 
burdock. Like other insects which construct cells 
under ground, it lines the cemented earthen walls 
of its cell with a smooth tapestry of silk, as closely 
woven as the web of the house-spider. 

Inaccurate observers have inferred that these 







Nests, fyc.,of an Earth-mason Caterpillar. 

earthen structures were formed by a very rude and 
unskilful process — the caterpillar, according to them, 
doing nothing more than roll itself round, while the 
mould adhered to the gluey, perspiration with which 
they describe its body to be covered. This is a 
process as far from the truth, as Aristotle’s account 
of the spider spinning its web from wool taken from 
its body. Did the caterpillar do nothing more than 
roll itself in the earth, the cavity would be a long 
tube fitted exactly to its body {fig. c ) : it is essentially 
different. 

It does not indeed require very minute observation 
to perceive, that every grain of earth in the structure 
is united to the contiguous grains by threads of silk ; 
and that consequently, instead of the whole having been 
done at once, it must have required very considerable 








time and labour. This construction is rendered 
more obvious by throwing one of these earthen cases 
into water, which dissolves the earth, but does not 
act on the silk which binds it together. To under- 
stand how this is performed, it may not be unin- 
teresting to follow the little mason from the begin- 
ning of his task. 

When one of those burrowing caterpillars has 
done feeding, it enters the earth to the depth of 
several inches, till it finds mould fit for its pur- 
pose. Having nowhere to throw the earth which 
it may dig out, the only means in its power of 
forming a cavity is to press it with its body ; and, 
by turning round and round for this purpose, an 
oblong hollow is soon made. But were it left in this 
state, as Reaumur well remarks, though the vault 
might endure the requisite time by the viscosity of 
the earth alone, were no change to take place in its 
humidity, yet, as a great number are wanted to 
hold out for six, eight, and ten months, they require 
to be substantially built; a mere lining of silk, there- 
fore, would not be sufficient, and it becomes necessary 
to have the walls bound with silk to some thickness. 

When a caterpillar cannot find earth sufficiently 
moist to bear kneading into the requisite consistence, 
it has the means of moistening it with a fluid which 
it ejects for the purpose ; and as soon as it has thus 
prepared a small pellet of earth, it fits it into the wall 
of the vault, and secures it with silk. As the little 
mason, however, always works on the inside of the 
building, it does not, at first view, appear in what 
manner it can procure materials for making one or 
two additional walls on the inside of the one first built. 
As the process takes place under ground, it is not 
easy to discover the particulars, for the caterpillars 
will not work in glazed boxes. The difficulty was 
completely overcome by M. Reaumur, in the instance 







of the caterpillar of the water-betony moth ( Cu - 
c.uliia scrophularitz, Schrauk), which he permitted 
to construct the greater part of its underground 
building, and then dug it up and broke a portion off 
from the end, leaving about a third part of the whole 
to be rebuilt. Those who are unacquainted with the 
instincts of insects might have supposed that, being 
disturbed by the demolition of its walls, it would 
have left off work ; but the stimulus of providing for 
the great change is so powerful, that scarcely any 
disturbance will interrupt a caterpillar in this species 
of labour. 

The little builder accordingly was not long in re- 
commencing its task for the purpose of repairing the 
disorder, which it accomplished in about four hours. 
At first it protruded its body almost entirely beyond 
the breach which had been made, to reconnoitre the 
exterior for building materials. Earth was put with- 
in its reach, of the same kind as it had previously 
used, and it was not long in selecting a grain adapted 
to its purpose, which it fitted into the wall and secured 
with silk. It first enlarged the outside of the wall 
by the larger and coarser grains, and then selected 
finer- for the interior. But before it closed the aper- 
ture, it collected a quantity of earth on the inside, 
wove a pretty thick network tapestry of silk over the 
part which remained open, and into the meshes of 
this, by pushing and pressing, it thrust grains of 
earth, securing them with silk till the whole was ren- 
dered opaque ; and the further operations of the in- 
sect could no longer be watched, except that it was 
observed to keep in motion, finishing, no doubt, the 
silken tapestry of the interior of its little chamber. 
When it was completed, M. Reaumur ascertained 
that the portion of the structure which had been 
built under his eye was equally thick and compact 
with the other, which had been done under ground. 








Earth-Mason Caterpillars' Nests , with the perfect Moth , fyc. 

The grubs of several of the numerous species of 
may-fly ( Ephemera ) excavate burrows for themselves 
in soft earth, on the banks of rivers and canals, under 

 



the level of the water, an operation well described by 
Scopoli, Swammerdam, and Reaumur. The excava- 
tions are always proportioned to the size of the in- 
habitant ; and consequently, when it is young and 
small, the hole is proportionally small, though, with 
respect to extent, it is always at least double the 
length of its body. The hole, being under the level 
of the river, is always filled with water, so that the 
grub swims in its native element, and while it is se- 
cure from being preyed upon by fishes, it has its own 
food within easy reach. It feeds, in fact, if we may 
judge from its egesta, upon the slime or moistened 
clay with which its hole is lined.

open to show the parallel structure. 

In the bank of the stream at Lee in Kent, we had 
occasion to take up an old willow stump, which, pre- 
vious to its being driven into the bank, had been per- 
forated in numerous places by the caterpillar of the 







goat-moth (Cossus ligniperda). From having- been 
driven amongst the moist clay, these perforations be- 
came filled with it, and the grubs of the ephemerae 
found them very suitable for their habitation ; for the 
wood supplied a more secure protection than if their 
galleries had been excavated in the clay. In these 
holes of the wood we found several empty, and some 
in which were full grown grubs*. 




IVnsts of Ephemera in holes of Cossus. 

The architecture of the grub of a pretty genus of 
beetles, known to entomologists by the name of Ci- 
cindela , is peculiarly interesting. It was first made 
known by the eminent French naturalists, Geoffroy, 
Desmarest, and Latreille. This grub, which may 
be met with during spring, and also in summer 
and autumn, in sandy places, is long, cylindric, soft, 
whitish, and furnished with six brown scaly feet. The 
head is of a square form, with six or eight eyes, 
and very large in proportion to the body. They have 
strong jaws, and on the eighth joint of the body there 
are two fleshy tubercles, thickly clothed with reddish 
hairs, and armed with a recurved horny spine, the 
whole giving to the grub the form of the letter Z. 

With their jaws and feet they dig into the earth to 
the depth of eighteen inches, forming a cylindrical 
cavity of greater diameter than their body, and fur- 
nished with a perpendicular entrance. In construct- 

* J. R. 







ing this, the grub first clears away the particles of' 
earth and sand by placing them on its broad trape- 
zoidal head, and carrying the load in this manner be- 
yond the area of the excavation. When it gets deeper 
down, it climbs gradually up to the surface with simi- 
lar loads by means of the tubercles on its back, above 
described. This process is a work of considerable 
time and difficulty, and in carrying its loads, the in- 
sect has often to rest by the way to recover strength 
for a renewed exertion. Not unfrequently, it finds 
the soil so ill adapted to its operations, that it aban- 
dons the task altogether, and begins anew in another 
situation. When it has succeeded in forming a com- 
plete den, it fixes itself at the entrance by the hooks 
of its tubercles, which are admirably adapted for the 
purpose, forming a fulcrum or support, while the 
broad plate on the top of the head exactly fits the 
aperture of the excavation, and is on a level with the 
soil. In this position, the grub remains immovable, 
with jaws expanded, and ready to seize and devour 
every insect which may wander within its reach, par- 
ticularly the smaller beetles ; and its voracity is so 
great, that it does not spare even its own species. It 
precipitates its prey into the excavation, and in case 
of danger, it retires to the bottom of its den, a cir- 
cumstance which renders it not a little difficult to 
discover the grub. The method adopted by the French 
naturalists was to introduce a straw or pliant twig 
into the hole, while they dug away, by degrees and 
with great care, the earth around it, and usually found 
the grub at the bottom of the cell, resting in a zig- 
zag position like one of the caterpillars of the geo- 
metric moths. 

When it is about to undergo its transformation 
into a pupa, it carefully closes the mouth of the den, 
and retires to the bottom in security. 

It does not appear that the grub of the genus 







Cicindela uses the excavation just described for the 
purpose of a trap or pitfall, any further than that it 
can more effectually secure its prey by tumbling them 
down into it ; but there are other species of grubs 
which construct pitfalls for the express purpose of 
traps. Among these is the larva of a fly ( Rhagio 
vermileo ), not unlike the common flesh maggot. 
The den which it constructs is in the form of a 
funnel, the sides of which are composed of sand or 
loose earth. It forms this pitfall of considerable 
depth, by throwing out the earth obliquely on all 
sides ; and when its trap is finished, it stretches it- 
self along the bottom, remaining stiff and motionless, 
like a piece of wood. The last segment of the body 
is bent at an angle with the rest, so as to form a 
strong point of support in the struggles which it must 
often have to encounter with vigorous prey. The 
instant that an insect tumbles into the pitfall, the 
grub pounces upon it, writhes itself round it like a 
serpent, transfixes it with its jaws, and sucks its 
juices at its ease. Should the prey by any chance 
escape, the grub hurls after it jets of sand and earth, 
with astonishing rapidity and force, and not unfre- 
quently succeeds in again precipitating it to the 
bottom of its trap. 

The Ant-Lion. 

The observations of the continental naturalists 
have made known to us a pitfall constructed by an 
insect, the details of whose operations are exceed- 
ingly curious — we refer to the grub of the ant-lion 
(Myrmeleon formicarius), which, though marked by 
Dr. Turton and Mr. Stewart as British, has not (at 
least of late years) been found in this country. As 
it is not, however, uncommon in France and Swit- 

t 3 







zerland, it is probable it may yet be discovered in 
some spot hitherto unexplored, and if so, it will well 
reward the research of the curious. 

The ant-lion grub being of a grey colour, and hav- 
ing its body composed of rings, is not unlike a wood- 
louse ( Oniscus ), though it is larger, more triangular, 
has only six legs, and most formidable jaws, in form 
of a reaping-hook, or a pair of calliper compases. 
These jaws, however, are not for masticating, but 
are perforated and tubular, for the purpose of suck- 
ing the juices of ants upon which it feeds. Vallisnieri 
was, therefore, mistaken, as Reaumur well remarks, 
when he supposed that he had discovered its mouth. 
Its habits require that it should w alk backwards, and 
this is the only species of locomotion which it can 
perform. Even this sort of motion it executes very 
slowly ; and were it not for the ingenuity of its 
stratagems, it would fare but sparingly, since its 
chief food consists of ants, whose activity and swift- 
ness of foot would otherwise render it impossible 
for it to make a single capture. Nature, however, 
in this, as in nearly every other case, has given a 
compensating power to the individual animal, to 
balance its privations. The ant-lion is slow — but it 
is extremely sagacious ; — it cannot follow its prey, 
but it can entrap it. 

The snare which the grub of the ant-lion employs 
consists of a funnel-shaped excavation formed in 
loose sand, at the bottom of which it lies in wait for 
the ants that chance to stumble over the margin, and 
cannot, from the looseness of the walls, gain a suffi- 
cient footing to effect their escape. When the pit- 
fall is intended to be small, it only thrusts its body 
backwards into the sand as far as it can, throwing 
out at intervals the particles which fall in upon it, 
till it is rendered of the requisite depth. 

By shutting up one of these grubs in a box with 








Grub of the Ant-Lion magnified , with one perfect Trap, 
and another begun. 

loose sand, it has been repeatedly observed con- 
structing its trap of various dimensions, from one to 
three inches in diameter, according to circumstances. 
When it intends to make one of considerable diame- 
ter, it proceeds as methodically as the most skil- 
ful architect or engineer amongst ourselves. It 
first examines the nature of the soil, whether it be 
sufficiently dry and fine for its purpose, and if 
so, it begins by tracing out a circle, where the 
mouth of its funnel-trap is intended to be. Having 
thus marked the limits of its pit, it proceeds to 
scoop out the interior. Getting within the circle, 
and using one of its legs as a shovel, it places there- 
with a load of sand on the flat part of its head, and 
it throws the whole with a jerk some inches beyond 
the circle. It is worthy of remark that it only uses 



 



one leg in this operation — the one, namely, which is 
nearest the centre of the circle. Were it to employ 
the others in digging away the sand, it would en- 
croach upon the regularity of its plan. Working 
with great industry and adroitness in the manner 
we have just described, it quickly makes the round of 
its circle, and as it works backwards it soon arrives 
at the point where it had commenced. Instead, 
however, of proceeding from this point in the same 
direction as before, it wheels about and works a 
round in the contrary direction, and in this way it 
avoids throwing all the fatigue of the labour on one 
leg, alternating them every round of the- circle. 




Ant-Lion's Pitfalls, in an e.rperimenting-box. 

Were there nothing to scoop out but sand or loose 
earth, the little engineer would have only to repeat 
the operations we have described, till it had completed 
the whole. But it frequently happens in the course 
of its labours, sometimes even when they are near a 
close, that it will meet with a stone of some size which 
would, if suffered to remain, injure materially the 
perfection of its trap. But such obstacles as this do 
not prevent the insect from proceeding : on the con- 
trary, it redoubles its assiduity to remove the ob- 
struction, as M. Bonnet repeatedly witnessed. If the 
stone be small, it can manage to jerk it out in the 
same manner as the sand ; but when it is two or 







three times larger and heavier than its own body, it 
must have recourse to other means of removal. The 
larger stones it usually leaves till the last, and when 
it has removed all the sand which it intends, it then 
proceeds to try what it can do with the less manage- 
able obstacles. For this purpose, it crawls backwards 
to the place where a stone may be, and thrusting its 
tail under it, is at great pains to get it properly ba- 
lanced on its back, by an alternate motion of the 
rings composing its body. When it has succeeded 
in adjusting the stone, it crawls up the side of the pit 
with great care and deposits its burden on the out- 
side of the circle. Should the stone happen to be 
round, the balance can be kept only with the greatest 
difficulty, as it has to travel with its load upon a 
slope of loose sand which is ready to give way at 
every step ; and often when the insect has carried it to 
the very brink it rolls off its back and tumbles down 
to the bottom of the pit. This accident, so far from 
discouraging the ant-lion, only stimulates it to more 
persevering efforts. Bonnet observed it renew these 
attempts to dislodge a stone, five or six times. It 
is only when it finds it utterly impossible to suc- 
ceed, that it abandons the design and commences 
another pit in a fresh situation. When it succeeds in 
getting a stone beyond the line of its circle, it is not 
contented with letting it rest there ; but to prevent it 
from again rolling in, it goes on to push it to a con- 
siderable distance. 

The pitfall, when finished, is usually about three 
inches in diameter at the top, about two inches deep, 
and gradually contracting into a point in the manner 
of a cone or funnel. In the bottom of this pit the 
ant-lion stations itself to watch for its prey. Should an 
ant or any other insect wander within the verge of the 
funnel, it can scarcely fail to dislodge and roll down 
some particles of sand, which will give notice to the 







ant-lion below to be on the alert. In order to secure 
the prey, Reaumur, Bonnet, and others have observed 
the ingenious insect throw up showers of sand by 
jerking it from his head in quick succession, till the 
luckless ant is precipitated within reach of the jaws 
of its concealed enemy. It feeds only on the blood 
or juice of insects ; and as soon as it has extracted 
these, it tosses the dry carcase out of its den. Its 
next care is to mount the sides of the pitfall arid re- 
pair any damage it may have suffered ; and when this 
is accomplished, it again buries itself among the sand 
at the bottom, leaving nothing but its jaws above the 
surface, ready to seize the next victim. 

When it is about to change into a pupa, it pro- 
ceeds in nearly the same manner as the caterpillar of 
the water-betony moth ( Cucullia scrophularice). It 
first builds a case of sand, the particles of which 
are secured by threads of silk, and then tapestries the 
whole with a silken web. Within this it undergoes 
its transformation into a pupa, and in due time, it 
emerges in form of a four-winged fly, closely resem- 
bling the dragon-flies ( Libellulce ), vulgarly and erro- 
neously called horse-stingers. 

The instance of the ant-lion naturally leads us to 
consider the design of the Author of Nature in so 
nicely adjusting, in all animals, the means of de- 
struction and of escape. As the larger quadrupeds 
of prey are provided with a most ingenious machi- 
nery for preying on the weaker, so are these furnished 
with the most admirable powers of evading their 
destroyers. In the economy of insects, we constantly 
observe, that the means of defence, not only of the 
individual creatures, but of their larvae and pupae, 
against the attacks of other insects, and of birds, is 
proportioned, in the ingenuity of their arrangements, 
to the weakness of the insect employing them. Those 
species which multiply the quickest have the greatest 







number of enemies. Bradley, an English naturalist, 
has calculated that two sparrows carry, in the course 
of a week, above three thousand caterpillars to the 
young in their nests. But though this is, probably, 
much beyond the truth, it is certain that there is a 
great and constant destruction of individuals going 
forward ; and yet the species is never destroyed. In 
this way a balance is kept up, by which one portion 
of animated nature cannot usurp the means of life 
and enjoyment which the world offers to another 
portion. In all matters relating to reproduction, 
Nature is prodigal in her arrangements. Insects 
have more stages to pass through before they 
attain their perfect growth than other creatures. 
The continuation of the species is, therefore, in 
many cases, provided for by a much larger number 
of eggs being deposited than ever become fertile. 
How many larvae are produced, in comparison 
with the number which pass into the pupa state ; 
and how many pupae perish before they become 
perfect insects ! Every garden is covered with cater- 
pillars ; and yet how few moths and butterflies, com- 
paratively, are seen, even in the most sunny season ! 
Insects which lay few eggs are, commonly, most 
remarkable in their contrivances for their preserva- 
tion. The dangers to which insect life is exposed 
are manifold ; and therefore are the contrivances for 
its preservation of the most perfect kind, and inva- 
riably adapted to the peculiar habits of each tribe. 
The same wisdom determines the food of every spe- 
cies of insect ; and thus some are found to delight in 
the rose-tree, and some in the oak. Had it been 
otherwise, the balance of vegetable life would not 
have been preserved. It is for this reason that the 
contrivances which an insect employs for obtaining 
its food are curious, in proportion to the natural diffi- 
culties of its structure. The ant-lion is carnivorous, 





but he has not the quickness of the spider, nor can 
he spread a net over a large surface, and issue from 
his citadel to seize a victim which he has caught in 
his outworks. He is therefore taught to dig a trap, 
where he sits, like the unwieldy giants of fable, wait- 
ing for some feeble one to cross his path. How 
laborious and patient are his operations — how un- 
certain the chances of success ! Yet he never shrinks 
from them, because his instinct tells him that by 
these contrivances alone can he preserve his own ex- 
istence, and continue that of his species. 





There are at least five different species of moths 
similar in manners and economy, the caterpillars of 
which feed upon animal substances, such as furs, 
woollen cloths, silk, leather, and, what to the natu- 
ralist is no less vexing-, upon the specimens of insects 
and other animals preserved in his cabinet. The 
moths in question are of the family named Tinea by 
Entomologists, such as the tapestry moth ( Tinea ta 
petzella), the fur moth ( Tinea pellionella'), the wool 
moth ( Tinea vestianella ), the cabinet moth ( Tinea 
Destructor , Stephens), &c. 

The moths themselves are, in the winged state, 
small, and well fitted for making their way through 
the most minute hole or chink, so that it is scarcely 
possible to exclude them by the closeness of a ward- 
robe or a cabinet*. If they cannot effect an entrance 
when a drawer is out, or a door open, they will con- 
trive to glide through the key-hole ; and if they once 
get in, it is no easy matter to dislodge or destroy 
them, for they are exceedingly agile, and escape out 
of sight in a moment. Moufet is of opinion that the 
ancients possessed an effectual method of preserving 
stuffs from the moth, because the robes of Servius 
Tullius were preserved up to the death of Sejanus, 
a period of more than five hundred years. On turning 
to Pliny to learn this secret, we find him relating that 
stuff laid upon a coffin will be ever after safe from 

* See fig. d. } p, 221. 





moths ; in the same way as a person once stung by a 
scorpion will never afterwards be stung by a bee, or a 
wasp, or a hornet ! Rhasis again says, that cantha- 
rides suspended in a house drive away moths ; and, 
he adds, that they will not touch anything wrapped in 
a lion’s skin ! — the poor little insects, says Reaumur 
sarcastically, being probably in bodily fear of so ter- 
rible an animal*. Such are the stories which fill the 
imagination even of philosophers, till real science en- 
tirely expels them. 

The effluvium of camphor or turpentine may some- 
times kill them, when in the winged state, but this 
will have no effect upon their eggs, and seldom upon 
the caterpillars ; for they wrap themselves up too 
closely to be easily reached by any agent except heat. 
This, when it can be conveniently applied, will be 
certain either to dislodge or to kill them. When the 
effluvium of turpentine, however, reaches the cater- 
pillar, Bonnet says it falls into convulsions, becomes 
covered with livid blotches, and diest. 

The mother insect takes care to deposit her eggs 
on or near such substances as she instinctively fore- 
knows will be best adapted for the food of the young, 
taking care to distribute them so that there may be 
a plentiful supply and enough of room for each. We 
have found, for example, some of those caterpillars 
feeding upon the shreds of cloth used in training 
wall-fruit trees ; but we never saw more than two 
caterpillars on one shred. This scattering of the 
eggs in many places, renders the effects of the cater- 
pillars more injurious, from their attacking many 
parts of a garment or a piece of stuff at the same 
timej. 

When one of the caterpillars of this family issues

f Contemplation do la Nature, part xii. chap, x. note. 







from the egg, its first care is to provide itself with a 
domicile, which indeed seems no less indispensable 
to it than food ; for, like all caterpillars that feed 
under cover, it will not eat while it remains unpro- 
tected. Its mode of building is very similar to that 
which is employed by other caterpillars that make 
use of extraneous materials. The foundation or 
frame-work is made of silk secreted by itself, and 
into this it interweaves portions of the material 
upon which it feeds. It is said by Bingley, that 
“ after having spun a fine coating of silk immediately 
around its body , it cuts the filaments of the wool or 
fur close by the thread of the cloth, or by the skin, 
with its teeth, which act in the manner of scissors, 
into convenient lengths, and applies the bits, one by 
one, with great dexterity, to the outside of its silken 
case*.” This statement, however, is erroneous, 
and inconsistent with the proceedings not only of 
the clothes moth, but of every caterpillar that con- 
structs a covering. None of these build from within 
outwards, but uniformly commence with the exterior 
wall, and finish by lining the interior with the finest 
materials. Reaumur, however, found that the newly- 
hatched caterpillars lived at first in a case of silk. 

We have repeatedly witnessed the proceedings of 
these insects from the very foundation of their struc- 
tures ; and, at the moment of writing this, we turned 
out one from the carcase of an “ old lady moth” 
(Mormo maura, Ochsenheim.), in our cabinet, and 
placed it on a desk covered with green cloth, where 
it might find materials for constructing another 
dwelling. It wandered about for half a day before 
it began its operations ; but it did not, as is asserted 
by Bonnet, and Kirby and Spence, “ in moving from 
place to place, seem to be as much incommoded by 

* Animal Biography, vol. iii. p. 330, 3d ed. 





the long' hairs which surrounded it, as we are by 
walking amongst high grass/’ nor “ accordingly, 
marching scythe in hand,” did it, “ with its teeth, cut 
out a smooth road*.” On the contrary, it did not 
cut a single hair, till it selected one for the founda- 
tion of its intended structure. This it cut very near 
the cloth, in order, we suppose, to have it as long as 
possible ; and placed it on a line with its body. It 
then immediately cut another, and placing it parallel 
to the first, bound both together with a few threads of 
its own silk. The same process was repeated with 
other hairs, till the little creature had made a fabric of 
some thickness, and this it went on to extend till it 
was large enough to cover its body ; which (as is 
usual with caterpillars) it employed as a model and 
measure for regulating its operations. We remarked 
that it made choice of longer hairs for the outside 
than for the parts of the interior, which it thought 
necessary to strengthen by fresh additions ; but the 
chamber was ultimately finished by a fine and closely- 
woven tapestry of silk. We could see the progress of 
its work, by looking into the opening at either of the 
ends ; for at this stage of the structure the walls are 
quite opaque, and the insect concealed. It may be 
thus observed to turn round, by doubling itself and 
bringing its head where the tail had just been ; of 
course, the interior is left wide enough for this pur- 
pose, and the centre, indeed, where it turns, is always 
wider than the extremitiesf. 

When the caterpillar increases in length, it takes 
care to add to the length of its house, by working-in 
fresh hairs at either end ; and if it be shifted to stuffs 
of different colours, it may be made to construct a 
party-coloured tissue, like a Scotch plaid. Reaumur 
cut off with scissors a portion at each end, to compel 

* Bonnet, xi. p. 204, Kirby and Spence, Intro, i. 4G4. 5th ed 

f J.R. 







the insect to make up the deficiency. But the cater- 
pillar increases in thickness as well as in length, so 
that its first house becoming too narrow, it must 
either enlarge it, or build a new one. It prefers the for- 
mer as less troublesome, and accomplishes its purpose 
“ as dexterously,” says Bonnet, “ as any tailor, and 
sets to work precisely as we should do, slitting the 
case on the two opposite sides, and then adroitly in- 
serting between them two pieces of the requisite size.

perfect state, when, as they cease to eat, they do no further injury. 

It does not, however, cut open the case from one end 
to the other at once ; the sides would separate too 
far asunder, and the insect be left naked. It therefore 
first cuts each side about half way down, beginning 
sometimes at the centre and sometimes at the end, 
(Fig. c.) and then, after having filled up the fissure, 
proceeds to cut the remaining half; so that, in fact, 
four enlargements are made, and four separate pieces 
inserted. The colour of the case is always the same 
as that of the stuff from which it is taken. Thus, if 








its original colour be blue, and the insect previously 
to enlarging it be put upon red cloth, the circles at 
the end, and two stripes down the middle, will be 
red' ; \” Re'aumur found that they cut these enlarge- 
ments in no precise order, but sometimes continuously, 
and sometimes opposite each other, indifferently. 

The same naturalist says he never knew one leave 
its old dwelling in order to build a new, though, when 
once ejected by force from its house, it would never 
enter it again, as some other species of caterpillars 
will do, but always preferred building another. We, 
on the contrary, have more than once seen them leave 
an old habitation. The very caterpillar, indeed, w r hose 
history we have above given, first took up its abode 
in a specimen of the ghost-moth ( Hepialus humuli ), 
where finding few suitable materials for building, it 
had recourse to the cork of the drawer, with the 
chips of which it made a structure almost as warm 
as it would have done from wool. Whether it took 
offence at our disturbing it one day, or whether it 
did not find sufficient food in the body of the ghost- 
moth, we know not ; but it left its cork house, and 
travelled about eighteen inches, selected “ the old 
lady,” one of the largest insects in the drawer, and 
built a new apartment composed partly of cork as 
before, and partly of bits dipt out of the moth’s 
wings f- 

We have seen these caterpillars form their habita- 
tions of every sort of insect, from a butterfly to a 
beetle; and the soft feathery wings of moths answer 
their purpose very well : but when they fall in with 
such hard materials as the musk beetle ( Cerambyx 
moschatus ) or the large scolopendra of the West 
Indies, they find some difficulty in the building.

itself secure to feed on the materials of the cloth or 
other animal matter within its reach, provided it 
is dry and free from fat or grease, which Reaumur 
found it would not touch. For building, it always 
selects the straightest and loosest pieces of wool, but 
for food it prefers the shortest and most Compact ; 
and to procure these it eats into the body of the stuff, 
rejecting the pile or nap, which it necessarily cuts 
across at the origin, and permits to fall, leaving it 
threadbare, as if it had been much worn. It must 
have been this circumstance which induced Bonnet 
to fancy (as we have already mentioned) that it cut 
the hairs to make itself a smooth comfortable path to 
walk upon. It would be equally correct to say that 
an ox or a sheep dislikes walking amongst long 
grass, and therefore eats it down in order to clear the 
way. 

Tent-making Caterpillars. 

The caterpillars of a family of small moths ( Tinei - 
clce), which feed on the leaves of various trees, such as 
the hawthorn, the elm, the oak, and most fruit-trees, 
particularly the pear, form habitations which are 
exceedingly ingenious and elegant. They are so 
very minute that they require close inspection to 
discover them ; and to the cursory observer, unac- 
quainted with their habits, they will appear more like 
the withered leaf scales of the tree, thrown olf when 
the buds expand, than artificial structures made by 
insects. It is only, indeed, by seeing them move 
about upon the leaves, that we discover they are in- 
habited by a living tenant, who carries them as the 
snail does its shell. 

These tents are from a quarter of an inch to an 
inch in length, and usually about the breadth of an 
oat-straw. That they are of the colour of a withered 



 



leaf is not surprising ; for they are actually composed 
of a piece of leaf ; not, however, cut out from the 
whole thickness, but artfully separated from the 
upper layer, as a person might separate one of the 
leaves of paper from a sheet of pasteboard. 




A caterpillar’s tent upon a leaf of the elm. a, a the part of the 
leaf from which the tent has been cut out. b, the tent itself. 

The tents of this class of caterpillars, which are 
found on the elm, the alder, and other trees with ser- 
rated leaves, are much in the shape of a minute 
gold-fish. They are convex on the back, where the 
indentations of the leaf out of which they have 
been cut add to the resemblance, by appearing like 
the dorsal fins of the fish. By depriving one of those 
caterpillars common on the hawthorn of its tent, 
for the sake of experiment, we put it under the ne- 
cessity of making another ; for, as Pliny remarks of 
the clothes-moth, they will rather die of hunger than 
feed unprotected. When we placed it on a fresh 
hawthorn leaf, it repeatedly examined every part of 
it, as if seeking for its lost tent, though, when this 
was put in its way, it would not again enter it ; but, 
after some delay, commenced a new one*. 

For this purpose, it began to eat through one of 
the two outer membranes which compose the leaf 
and enclose the pulp ( parenchyma ), some of which, 
also, it devoured, and then thrust the hinder part 







of its body into the perforation. The cavity, how- 
ever, which it had formed, being yet too small for 
its reception, it immediately resumed the task of 
making it larger. By continuing to gnaw into the 
pulp, between the membranes of the leaf (for it took 
the greatest care not to puncture or injure the mem- 
branes themselves), it soon succeeded in mining out 
a gallery rather larger than was sufficient to contain 
its body. We perceived that it did not throw out as 
rubbish the pulp it dug into, but devoured it as food, 
— a circumstance not the least remarkable in its pro- 
ceedings. 

As the two membranes of leaf thus deprived of the 
enclosed pulp appeared white and transparent, every 
movement of the insect within could be distinctly 
seen ; and it was not a little interesting to watch its 
ingenious operations while it was making its tent from 
the membranes prepared as we have just described. 
These, as Reaumur has remarked, are in fact to the 
insect like a piece of cloth in the hands of a tailor ; 
and no tailor could cut out a shape with more neat- 
ness and dexterity than this little workman does. As 
the caterpillar is furnished in its mandibles with an 
excellent pair of scissors, this may not appear to be 
a difficult task ; yet, when we examine the matter 
more minutely, we find that the peculiar shape of the 
two extremities requires different curvatures, and this, 
of course, renders the operation no less complex, as 
Reaumur subjoins, than the shaping of the pieces of 
cloth for a coat*. The insect, in fact, shapes the mem- 
branes slightly convex on one side and concave on the 
other, and at one end twice as large as at the other. 
In the instance which we observed, beo'inninn: at the 
larger end, it bent them gently on each side by press- 
ing them with its body thrown into a curve. We 
have not said it cuts , but shapes its materials ; for it 
must be obvious that if the insect had cut both the 
* Mem. Hist. Insect, iii. p. 106. 






membranes at this stage of its operations, the pieces 
would have fallen and carried it along with them. 

To obviate such an accident, it proceeded to join 
the two edges, and secure them firmly with silk, 
before it made a single incision to detach them. 
When it had in this manner joined the two edges 
along one of the sides, it inserted its head on the 
outside of the joining, first at one end and then at the 
other, gnawing the fibres till that whole side was 
separated. It proceeded in the same manner with 
the other side, joining the edges before it cut them; 
and when it arrived at the last fibre, the only remain- 
ing support of its now finished tent, it took the pre- 
caution, before snipping it, to moor the whole to the 
uncut part of the leaf by a cable of its own silk. 
Consequently, when it does cut the last nervure, it is 
secure from falling, and can then travel along the leaf, 
carrying its tent on its back, as a snail does its shell*.

We have just discovered (Nov. 4th, 1S29), upon 
the nettle, a tent of a very singular appearance, in 
consequence of the materials of which it is made. 
The caterpillar seems, indeed, to have proceeded ex- 

* J. R. 







actly in the same manner as those which we have 
described, mining- first between the two membranes 
of the leaf, and then uniting these and cutting out 
his tent. But the tent itself looks singular from being 
all over studded with the stinging bristles of the 
nettle, and forming- a no less formidable coat of mail 
to the little inhabitant, than the spiny hide of the 
hedgehog. In feeding, it does not seem to have 
mined into the leaf, but to have eaten the whole of 
the lower membrane, along with the entire pulp, 
leaving nothing but the upper membrane untouched*. 

Tents of Stone-mason Caterpillars. 

The caterpillar of a small moth (Tinea) which feeds 
upon the lichens growing on walls, builds for itself a 
moveable tent of a very singular kind. M. de la Yoye 
was the first who described these insects ; but though 
they are frequently overlooked, from being very small, 
they are by no means uncommon on old walls. 
Reaumur observed them regularly for twenty years 
together, on the terrace-wall of the Tuileries at Paris ; 
and they may be found in abundance in similar situ- 
ations in this country. This accurate observer refuted 
by experiment the notion of M. de la Voye, that the 
caterpillars fed upon the stones of the wall ; but he 
satisfied himself that they detached particles of the 
stone for the purpose of building their tents or sheaths 
( fourreaux ), as he calls their dwellings. In order 
to watch their mode of building, Reaumur gently 
ejected half a dozen of them from their homes, and 
observed them detach grain after grain from a piece 
of stone, binding each into the wall of their building 
with silk, till the cell acquired the requisite magnitude, 
the whole operation taking about twenty-four hours 
of continued labour. M. de la Voye mentions small 



* J. R. 







granular bodies of a greenish colour, placed irregu- 
larly on the exterior of the structure, which he calls 
eggs ; but we agree with Reaumur in thinking it 
more probable that they are small fragments of moss 
or lichen intermixed with the stone : in fact, we have 
ascertained that they are so*. 

When these little architects prepare for their 
change into chrysalides before becoming moths, they 
attach their tents securely to the stone over which 
they have hitherto rambled, by spinning a strong 
mooring of silk, so as not only to fill up every inter- 
stice between the main entrance of the tent and the 
stone, but also weaving a close, thick curtain of the 
same material, to shut up the entire aperture. 




Tents and Caterpillars, both of their natural size and magnified.' 

It is usual for insects which form similar struc- 
tures, to issue, when they assume the winged state, 
from the broader end of their habitation ; but our 
little stone-mason proceeds in a different manner. It 
leaves open the apex of the cone from the first, for 
the purpose of ejecting its excrements, and latterly 
it enlarges this opening a little, to allow of a free 
exit when it acquires wings ; taking care, however, 
to spin over it a canopy of silk, as a temporary pro- 
tection, which it can afterwards burst through with- 

* J. R. 







out difficulty. The moth itself is very much like the 
common clothes-moth in form, but is of a gilded 
bronze colour, aud considerably smaller. 

In the same locality, M. de Maupertuis found a 
numerous brood of small caterpillars, which employed 
grains of stone, not, like the preceding, for building 
feeding tents, but for their cocoons. This caterpillar 
was of a brownish-grey colour, with a white line 
along the back, on each side of which were tufts of 
hair. The cocoons which it built were oval, and less 
in size than a hazel nut, the grains of the stone being 
skilfully woven into irregular meshes of silk. 

In June, 1829, we found a numerous encampment 
of the tent-building caterpillars described by MM. 
de la Voye and Reaumur, on the brick wall of a gar- 
den at Blackheath, Kent*. They were so very small, 
however, and so like the lichen on the wall, that, had 
not our attention been previously directed to their 
habits, we should have considered them as portions of 
the wall ; for not one of them was in motion, and it 
was only by the neat, turbinated, conical form in which 
they had constructed their habitations, that we detected 
them. We tried the experiment above-mentioned, of 
ejecting one of the caterpillars from its tent, in order 
to watch its proceedings when constructing another ; 
but probably its haste to procure shelter, or the arti- 
ficial circumstances into which it was thrown, influ- 
enced its operations, for it did not form so good a 
tent as the first, the texture of the walls being much 
slighter, while it was more rounded at the apex, and 
of course not so elegant. Reaumur found, in all his 
similar experiments, that the new structure equalled 
the old ; but most of the trials of this kind which we 
have made correspond with the inferiority which we 
have here recorded. The process indeed is the same, 

* J.R. 

 

but it seems to be done with more hurry and less care. 
It may be, indeed, in some cases, that the supply of 
silk necessary to unite the bits of stone, earth, or 
lichen employed, is too scanty for perfecting a second 
structure. 

We remarked a very singular circumstance in 
the operations of our little architect, which seems 
to have escaped the minute and accurate attention 
of Reaumur. When it commenced its structure, it 
was indispensable to lay a foundation for the walls 
about to be reared ; but as the tent was to be moveable 
like the shell of a snail, and not stationary, it would 
not have answered its end to cement the foundation 
to the wall. We had foreseen this difficulty, and felt 
not a little interested in discovering how it would be 
got over. Accordingly, upon watching its move- 
ments with some attention, we were soon gratified 
to perceive that it used its own body as the pri- 
mary support of the building. It fixed a thread 
of silk upon one of its right feet, warped it over to the 
corresponding left foot, and upon the thread thus 
stretched between the two feet, it glued grains of 
stone and chips of lichen, till the wall was of the re- 
quired thickness. Upon this, as a foundation, it 
continued to work till it had formed a small portion 
in form of a parallelogram ; and, proceeding in a 
similar way, it was not long in making a ring a very 
little wider than sufficient to admit its body. It ex- 
tended this ring in breadth, by working on the inside 
only, narrowing the diameter by degrees, till it began 
to take the form of a cone. The apex of this cone 
was not closed up, but left as an aperture through 
which to eject its excrements. 

It is worthy of remark, that one of the caterpillars 
which we deprived of its tent, attempted to save itself 
the trouble of building a new one, by endeavouring 
to unhouse one of its neighbours. For this purpose, 







it got upon the outside of the inhabited tent, and 
sliding its head down to the entrance, tried to make 
its way into the interior. But the rightful owner 
did not choose to give up his premises so easily ; and 
fixed his tent down so firmly upon the table where we 
had placed it, that the intruder was forced to aban- 
don his attempt. The instant, however, that the other 
unmoored his tent and began to move about, the in- 
vader renewed his efforts to eject him, persevering 
in the struggle for several hours, but without a 
chance of success. At one time, we imagined that 
he would have accomplished his felonious intentions; 
for he bound down the apex of the tent to the table 
with cables of silk. But he attempted his entrance 
at the wrong end. He ought to have tried the aper- 
ture in the apex, by enlarging which a little he 
would undoubtedly have made good his entrance ; 
and as the inhabitant could not have turned upon 
him for want of room, the castle must have been 
surrendered. This experiment, however, was not 
tried, and there was no hope for him at the main 
entrance. 

Muff-shaped Tents. 

The ingenuity of man has pressed into his service 
not only the wool, the hair, and even the skins of 
animals, but has most extensively searched the vege- 
table kingdom for the materials of his clothing. In 
all this, however, he is rivalled by the tiny inhabi- 
tants of the insect world, as we have already seen; 
and we are about now to give an additional instance 
of the art of a species of caterpillars which select a 
warmer material for their tents than even the cater- 
pillar of the clothes-moth. It may have been remarked 
by many who are not botanists, that the seed-catkins 
of the willow become, as they ripen, covered with a 
species of down or cotton, which, however, is too 




short in the fibre to be advantageously employed in 
our manufactures. But the caterpillars to which we 
have alluded, find it well adapted for their habita- 
tions. 

The muff-looking tent in which we find these in- 
sects, does not require much trouble to construct ; 
for the caterpillar does not, like the clothes-moth 
caterpillar, join the willow-cotton together, fibre by 
fibre — it is contented with the state in which it 
finds it on the seed. Into this it burrows, lines the 
interior with a tapestry of silk, and then detaches the 
whole from the branch where it was growing, and 
carries it about with it as a protection while it is 
feeding*.

* Reaumur, iii. p. 130. 











An inquiring friend of Reaumur having found 
one of these insects floating about in its muff-tent 
upon water, concluded that they fed upon aquatic 
plants ; but he was soon convinced that it had only 
been blown down by an accident, which must fre- 
quently happen, as willows so often hang over water. 
May it not be, that the buoyant materials of the tent 
were intended to furnish the little inhabitant with a 
life-boat, in which, when it chanced to be blown into 
the water, it might sail safely ashore and regain its 
native tree ? 

Leaf-mining Caterpillars. 

The process of mining between the two mem- 
branes of a leaf is carried on to more extent by mi- 
nute caterpillars allied to the tent-makers above 
described. The tent-maker never deserts his house, 
except when compelled, and therefore can only mine 
to about half the length of his own body ; but the 
miners now to be considered make the mine itself 
their dwelling-place, and as they eat their way they 
lengthen and enlarge their galleries. A few of 
these mining caterpillars are the progeny of small 
weevils ( Curculionidce ), some of two- winged flies 
( Diptera ), but the greater number are produced from 
a genus of minute moths ( (Ecophora , Latr.) which, 
when magnified, appear to be amongst the most 
splendid and brilliant of nature’s productions, vying 
even with the humming birds and diamond beetles 
of the tropics in the rich metallic colours which be- 
spangle their wings. Well may Bonnet call them 
“ tiny miracles of nature,” and regret that they are 
not e.n grand *. 

There are few plants or trees whose leaves may not, 
at some season of the year, be found mined by these 

* Bonnet^ Contempl. de la Nature, Part xii. 





caterpillars, the track of whose progress appears on 
the upper surface in winding lines. Let us take one 
of the most common of these for an example, — that 
of the rose-leaf, produced by the caterpillar of Ray’s 
golden-silver spot (. Argyromiges Rayella ? Curtis) 
of which we have just gathered above a dozen speci- 
mens from one rose-tree' 1 '. 




Leaf of the Monthly-Rose (Rosa Indica) mined by Caterpillars 
of Argyromiges? 

It may be remarked, that the winding line is 
black, closely resembling the tortuous course of a 
river on a map, — beginning like a small brook, and 
gradually increasing in breadth as it proceeds. This 
representation of a river exhibits, besides, a narrow 
white valley on each side of it, increasing as it goes, 
till it terminates in a broad delta. The valley is the 
portion of the inner leaf from which the caterpillar 
has eaten the pulp ( parenchyma ), while the river 
itself has been formed by the liquid cjectamenta of 
the insect, the watery part becoming evaporated. In 
other species of miners, however, the dung is hard 

* J.R. 







and dry, and consequently these only exhibit the 
valley without the river. (See p. 237.) 

On looking’ at the back of the leaf, where the wind- 
ing line begins, we uniformly find the shell of the 
very minute egg from which the caterpillar has been 
hatched, and hence perceive that it digs into the leaf 
the moment it escapes from the egg, without wan- 
dering a hair’s breadth from the spot; as if afraid 
lest the air should visit it too roughly. The egg is, 
for the most part, placed upon the midrib of the rose- 
leaf, but sometimes on one of the larger nervures. 
When once it has got within the leaf, it seems to 
pursue no certain direction, sometimes working to 
the centre, sometimes to the circumference, sometimes 
to the point, and sometimes to the base, and even, 
occasionally, crossing or keeping parallel to its own 
previous track. 

The most marvellous circumstance, however, is 
the minuteness of its workmanship ; for though a 
rose leaf is thinner than this paper, the insect finds 
room to mine a tunnel to live in, and plenty of food, 
without touching the two external membranes. Let 
any one try with the nicest dissecting instruments to 
separate the two plates of a rose leaf, and he will 
find it impossible to proceed far without tearing one 
or other. The caterpillar goes still further in mi- 
nute nicety; for it may be remarked, that its track 
can only be seen on the upper, and not on the under 
surface of the leaf, proving that it eats as it pro- 
ceeds only half the thickness of the pulp, or that 
portion of it which belongs to the upper membrane 
of the leaf. 

We have found this little miner on almost every 
sort of rose-tree, both wild and cultivated, including 
the sweet-briar, in which the leaf being very small, 
it requires nearly the whole parenchyma to feed one 
caterpillar. They seem, however, to prefer the foreign 







monthly rose to any of our native species, and there 
are few trees of this where they may not be dis- 
covered. 

Tunnels, very analogous to the preceding, may be 
found upon the common bramble (Rubus fruticosus), 
but the little miner seems to proceed more regularly, 
always, when newly hatched, making directly for the 
circumference, upon or near which also the mother 
moth deposits her egg, and winding along for half 
the extent of the leaf close upon the edge, following, 
in some cases, the very indentations formed by the 
terminating nervures. 




Leaf of the Dew-berry Bramble ( Rubus Cassius') mined by Caterpillars. 

The bramble-leaf miner seems also to differ from 
that of the rose-leaf, by eating the pulp both from 
the upper and under surface, at least the track is 
equally distinct above and below ; yet this may arise 
from the different consistence of the leaf pulp, that 
in the rose being firm, while that of the bramble is 
soft and puffy. 

On the leaves of the common primrose ( Primula 
veris ), as well as on the garden variety of it, the 
polyanthus, one of those mining caterpillars may very 
frequently be found. It is, however, considerably 







different from the preceding, for there is no black 
trace — no river to the valley which it excavates : its 
ejectamenta, being small and solid, are seen, when the 
leaf is dried, in little black points like grains of sand. 
This miner, also, seems more partial than the pre- 
ceding to the midrib and its vicinity, in consequence 
of which its path is seldom so tortuous, and often 
appears at its extremity to terminate in an area, com- 
paratively extensive, arising from its recrossing its 
previous tracks *. 




Leaf of the Primrose [Primula veris) mined by a Caterpillar. 

Swammerdam describes a mining caterpillar which 
he found on the leaves of the alder, though it did 
not, like those we have just described, excavate a 
winding gallery; it kept upon the same spot, and 
formed only an irregular area. A moth was pro- 
duced from this, whose upper wings, he says, 
“ shone and glittered most gloriously with crescents 
of gold, silver, and brown, surrounded by borders of 
delicate black.” Another area miner which he found 
on the leaves of willows, as many as seventeen on 
one leaf, producing what appeared to be rusty spots, 
was metamorphosed into a very minute Aveevil 
(Curculio Rhinoc .). He saysjhe has been informed, 



* J. R. 







that, in warm climates, worms are found in leaves an 
inch long, and adds, with great simplicity, “on these 
many fine experiments might have been made, if the 
inhabitants had not laboured under the cursed thirst 
of gold*/’ 

The vine-leaf miner, when about to construct its 
cocoon, cuts, from the termination of its gallery, two 
pieces of the membrane of the leaf, deprived of their 
pulp, in a similar manner to the tent-makers de- 
scribed above, uniting them and lining them with 
silk. This she carries to some distance before she 
lays herself up to undergo her change. Her mode 
of walking under her burden is peculiar, for, not con- 
tented with the security of a single thread of silk, 
she forms, as Bonnet says, “little mountains ( mon- 
ticules ) of silk, from distance to distance, and seizing 
one of these with her teeth, drags herself forward, and 
makes it a scaffolding from which she can build 
another +.” Some of the miners, however, do not 
leave their galleries, but undergo their transforma- 
tions there, taking the precaution to mine a cell, not 
in the upper, but in the under surface of the leaf; 
others only shift to another portion of the leaf. 

Social Leaf-Miners. 

The preceding descriptions apply to caterpillars 
who construct their mines in solitude, there being 
seldom more than one on a leaf or leaflet, unless 
when two mother flies happen to lay their eggs on the 
same leaf ; but there are others, such as the miners 
of the leaves of the henbane ( Hyoscyamus niger) 
which excavate a common area in concert — from four 
to eight forming a colony. These are very like flesh 
maggots, being larger than the common miners ; the 

* Swammerd. Book of Nature, vol. ii. p. 84. 

f Contempt, de la Nature, part xii. p. 197. 







leaves of this plant, from being thick and juicy, 
giving them space to work and plenty to eat. 

Most of the solitary leaf-miners either cannot or 
will not construct a new mine, if ejected by an ex- 
perimenter from the old, as we have frequently 
proved; but this is not the case with the social 
miners of the henbane leaf. Bonnet ejected one of 
these, and watched it with his glass till it com- 
menced a new tunnel, which it also enlarged with 
great expedition ; and in order to verify the assertion 
of Reaumur, that they neither endeavour nor fear to 
meet one another, he introduced a second. Neither 
of them manifested any knowledge of the other’s con- 
tiguity, but both worked hard at the gallery, as did a 
third and a fourth which he afterwards introduced; 
for though they seemed uneasy, they never attacked 
one another, as the solitary ones often do when they 
meet*. 

Bark-mining Caterpillars. 

A very different order of mining caterpillars are 
the progeny of various beetles, which excavate their 
galleries in the soft inner bark of trees, or between it 
and the young wood (Alburnum). Some of these, 
though small, commit extensive ravages, as may rea- 
dily be conceived when we are told that as many as 
eighty thousand are occasionally found on one tree. 
Jn 1783 the trees thus destroyed by the printer beetle 
(Tomicus typographus , Latr.), so called from its 
tracks resembling letters, amounted to above a million 
and a half in the Hartz forest. It appears there pe- 
riodically, and confines its ravages to the fir. This 
insect is said to have been found in the neighbour- 
hood of London. 

On taking off the bark of decaying poplars and 
willows, we have frequently met with the tracks of 

* Bonnet, Observ. sur les Insectes, vol, ii. p. 425, 







a miner of this order, extending in tortuous path- 
ways, about a quarter of an inch broad, for several 
feet and even yards in length. The excavation is 
not circular, but a compressed oval, and crammed 
throughout with a dark-coloured substance like saw- 
dust — the excrement no doubt of the little miner, 
who is thereby protected from the attacks of staplnj- 
linidcc , and other predaceous insects, from behind. 
But though we have found a great number of these 
subcortical tracks, we have never discovered one of 
the miners, though they are very probably the grubs 
of the pretty musk-beetle ( Cerambyx moschatus ) 
which is so abundant in the neighbourhood of the 
trees in question, that the very air in summer is per- 
fumed with their odour 

Another capricorn beetle of this family is no less 
destructive to bark in its perfect state, than the above 
are when grubs, as, from its habit of eating round a 
tree, it cuts the course of the returning sap, and de- 
stroys it.

Grasshoppers, locusts, crickets, and beetles are, in 
many respects, no less interesting* than the insects 
whose architectural proceedings we have already de- 
tailed. They do not, indeed, build any edifice for the 
accommodation of themselves or their progeny ; but 
most, if not all of them, excavate retreats in walls or 
in the ground. 

The house-cricket ( Acheta domcstica) is well 
known for its habit of picking out the mortar of 
ovens and kitchen fire-places, where it not only 
enjoys warmth, but can procure abundance of 
food. It is usually supposed that it feeds on bread. 
M. Latreille says it only eats insects, and it cer- 
tainly thrives well in houses infested by the cock- 
roach ; but we have also known it eat and destroy 
lamb’s-wool stockings, and other woollen stuffs, hung 
near a fire to dry. It is evidently not fond of hard 
labour, but prefers those places where the mortar is 
already loosened, or at least is new, soft, and easily 
scooped out ; and in this way it will dig covert ways 
from room to room. In summer, crickets often make 
excursions from the house to the neighbouring fields, 
and dwell in the crevices of rubbish, or the cracks 
made in the ground by dry weather, where they chirp 
as merrily as in the snuggest chimney corner. Whe- 
ther they ever dig retreats in such circumstances, we 
have not ascertained ; though it is not improbable 
they may do so for the purpose of making nests. M. 





Bory St. Vincent tells us, that the Spaniards are so 
fond of crickets that they keep them in cages like 
singing birds*. 

The Mole-Cricket. 

The insect called, from its similarity of habits to the 
mole, the mole-cricket ( Gryllotalpa vulgaris , Latr.) 
is but too well known in gardens and corn-fields in 
some parts of England, such as Wiltshire and Hamp- 
shire, though it is comparatively rare or unknown in 
others. It burrows in the ground, and forms exten- 
sive galleries similar to those of the mole, though 
smaller ; and these may always be recognised by a 
slightly-elevated ridge of mould : for the insect does 
not throw up the earth in hillocks like the mole, but 
gradually, as it digs along, in the manner of the field- 
mouse. In this way it commits great ravages in hot- 
beds and in gardens, upon pease, young cabbages, 
and other vegetables, the roots of which it is said 
to devour. It is not improbable, we think, that, 
like its congener, the house-cricket, it may also prey 
upon underground insects, and undermine the plants 
to get at them, as the mole has been proved to do. 
Mr. Gould, indeed, fed a mole-cricket for several 
months upon ants. 

The structure of the mole-cricket’s arms and hands 
(if we may call them so) is admirably adapted for 
these operations, being both very strong, and moved 
by a peculiar apparatus of muscles. The breast is 
formed of a thick, hard, horny substance, which is 
further strengthened within by a double frame-work 
of strong gristle, in front of the extremities of w hich 
the shoulder blades of the arms are firmly jointed ; a 
structure evidently intended to prevent the breast 
from being injured by the powerful action of the

muscles of the arms in digging. The arms them- 
selves are strong and broad, and the hand is fur- 
nished with four large sharp claws, pointing somewhat 
obliquely outwards, this being the direction in which 
it digs, throwing the earth on each side of its course. 



The nest which the female constructs for her eggs, 
in the beginning of May, is well worthy of attention. 
The Rev. Mr. White, of Selborne, tells us that a 
gardener, at a house where he was on a visit, while 
mowing grass by the side of a canal, chanced to strike 
his scythe too deep, and pared off a large piece of 
turf, laying open to view an interesting scene of 
domestic economy. There was a pretty chamber dug 
in the clay, of the form and about the dimensions it 
would have had if moulded by an egg, the walls 
being neatly smoothed and polished. In this little 
cell were deposited about a hundred eggs, of the 
size and form of caraway comfits, and of a dull tar- 
nished white colour. The eggs were not very deep,

but just under a little heap of fresh mould, and within 
the influence of the sun’s heat*. 

Like the eggs and young of other insects, however, 
those of the mole-cricket are exposed to depredation, 
and particularly to the ravages of a black beetle which 
burrows in similar localities. The mother insect, 
accordingly, does not think her nest secure till she 
has defended it, like a fortified town, with labyrinths, 
entrenchments, ramparts, and covert ways. In some 
part of these outworks she stations herself as an ad- 
vanced guard, and when the beetle ventures within 
her circumvallations, she pounces upon him and kills 
him. 




Nest of the Mole-Cricket. 



The Field-Cricket. 

Another insect of this family, the field-cricket ( Acheia 
campcstris ), also forms burrows in the ground, in 
which it lodges all day, and comes out chiefly about 
sun-set, to pipe its evening song. It is so very shy and 
cautious, however, that it is by no means easy to 
discover either the insect or its burrow. “ The 
children in France amuse themselves with hunting 
after the field-cricket ; they put into its hole an ant 
fastened by a long hair, and as they draw it out the 
gricket does not fail to pursue it, and issue from its 



* Nat, Hist, of Splborne, ii. 82, 







retreat. Pliny informs us it might be captured in a 
much more expeditious and easy manner. If, for 
instance, a small and slender piece of stick were to 
be thrust into the burrow, the insect, he says, would 
immediately get upon it for the purpose of demand- 
ing the occasion of the intrusion : whence arose the 
proverb stultior grillo (more foolish than a cricket), 
applied to one who, upon light grounds, provokes his 
enemy, and falls into the snares which might have 
been laid to entrap him*.” 

The Rev. Mr. White, who attentively studied 
their habits and manners, at first made an attempt 
to dig them out with a spade, but without any 
great success ; for either the bottom of the hole 
was inaccessible, from its terminating under a large 
stone, or else, in breaking up the ground, the poor 
creature was inadvertently squeezed to death. Out 
of one thus bruised, a great number of eggs were 
taken, which were long and narrow, of a yellow 
colour, and covered with a very tough skin. More 
gentle means were then used, and these proved suc- 
cessful. A pliant stalk of grass, gently insinuated > 
into the caverns, will probe their windings to the 
bottom, and bring out the inhabitant; and thus the 
humane inquirer may gratify his curiosity without 
injuring the object of it. 

When the males meet, they sometimes fight very 
fiercely, as Mr. White found by some that he put into 
the crevices of a dry stone wall, where he wished to 
have them settle. For though they seemed distressed 
by being taken out of their knowledge, yet the first that 
got possession of the chinks seized on all the others 
that were obtruded upon him with his large row of 
serrated fangs. With their strong jaws, toothed like 
the shears of a lobsters claws, they perforate and

round their curious regular cells, having no fore- 
claws to dig with, like the mole-cricket. When 
taken into the hand, they never attempt to defend 
themselves, though armed with such formidable wea- 
pons. Of such herbs as grow about the mouths of 
their burrows they eat indiscriminately, and never 
in the day-time seem to stir more than two or three 
inches from home. Sitting in the entrance of their 
caverns, they chirp all night as well as day, from the 
middle of the month of May to the middle of July. 
In hot weather, when they are most vigorous, they 
make the hills echo ; and, in the more still hours of 
darkness, may be heard to a very considerable dis- 
tance. “ Not many summers ago,” says Mr. White, 
“ I endeavoured to transplant a colony of these in- 
sects to the terrace in my garden, by boring deep

holes in the sloping’ turf. The new inhabitants staid 
some time, and fed and sang- ; but they wandered 
away by degrees, and were heard at a greater dis- 
tance every morning ; so it appears that on this 
emergency they made use of their wings in attempting 
to return to the spot from which they were taken*.” 
The manner in which these insects lay their eggs is 
represented in the preceding figure ; which is that of 
an insect nearly allied to the crickets, though of a 
different genus. 

o 

A more laborious task is performed by an insect by 
no means uncommon in Britain, the Burying Beetle 
( Necrojj/iorus vespillo ), which may be easily recog- 
nised by its longish body, of a black colour, with two 
broad and irregularly indented bands of yellowish 
brown. A foreign naturalist, M. Gleditsch, gives a 
very interesting account of its industry. He had 
“often remarked that dead moles, when laid upon the 
ground, especially if upon loose earth, were almost 
sure to disappear in the course of two or three days, 
often of twelve hours. To ascertain the cause, he 
placed a mole upon one of the beds in his garden 
It had vanished by the third morning ; and, on dig ¦ 
ging where it had been laid, he found it buried to the 
depth of three inches, and under it four beetles, which 
seemed to have been the agents in this singular 
inhumation. Not perceiving anything particular in 
the mole, he buried it again ; and on examining if at 
the end of six days, he found it swarming with mag- 
gots, apparently the issue of the beetles, which M. 
Gleditsch now naturally concluded had buried the 
carcass for the food of their future young. To deter- 
mine these points more clearly, he put four of these 
insects into a glass vessel, half filled with earth and - 
properly secured, and, upon the surface of the earth, 
two frogs. In less than twelve hours one of the frogs 
w.as interred by two of the beetles ; the other two run

about the whole day, as if busied in measuring the 
dimensions of the remaining corpse, which on the 
third day was also found buried. He then introduced 
a dead linnet. A pair of the beetles were soon en- 
gaged upon the bird. They began their operations 
by pushing out the earth from under the body, so as 
to form a cavity for its reception ; and it was curious 
to see the efforts which the beetles made, by dragging 
at the feathers of the bird from below, to pull it into 
its grave. The male, having driven the female away, 
continued the work alone for five hours. He lifted 
up the bird, changed its place, turned it and arranged 
it in the grave, and from time to time came out of 
the hole, mounted upon it, and trod it under foot, 
and then retired below, and pulled it down. At 
length, apparently wearied with this uninterrupted 
labour, it came forth, and leaned its head upon the 
earth beside the bird without the smallest motion, as 
if to rest itself, for a full hour, when it again crept 
under the earth. The next day, in the morning, the 
bird was an inch and a half under ground, and the 
trench remained open the whole day, the corpse seem- 
ing as if laid out upon a bier, surrounded with a 
rampart of mould. In the evening it had sunk half 
an inch lower, and in another day the work was com- 
pleted, and the bird covered. M. Gleditsch con- 
tinued to add other small dead animals, which were 
all sooner or later buried ; and the result of iiis 
experiment was, that in fifty days four beetles had 
interred, in the very small space of earth allotted to 
them, twelve carcasses : viz., four frogs, three small 
birds, two fishes, one mole, and two grasshoppers, 
besides the entrails of a fish, and two morsels of the 
lungs of an ox. In another experiment, a single 
beetle buried a mole forty times its own bulk and 
weight in two days*.” 

* Act. Acad. Bcrolin. 1752, et Gleditsch, Phys. Botan., quoted 
by Kirby and Spence, ii. 353, 







Iii the summer of 1826, we found on Putney Heath, 
in Surrey, four of these beetles, hard at work in bury- 
ing* a dead crow, precisely in the manner described 
by M. Gleditsch*. 

Dung-Beetle. 

A still more common British insect, the Dorr, 
Clock, or Dung* Beetle ( Geotrupes stercorarius ), uses 
different materials for burying along with its eggs. 
“ It digs,” to use the words of Kirby and Spence, 
“ a deep cylindrical hole, and carrying down a mass 
of the dung to the bottom, in it deposits its eggs. 
And many of the species of the genus Ateuchus roll 
together wet dung into round pellets, deposit an egg 
in the midst of each, and when dry push them back- 
wards, by their hind feet, to holes of the surprising- 
depth of three feet, which they have previously dug 
for their reception, and which are often several yards 
distant. The attention of these insects to their eggs 
is so remarkable, that it was observed in the earliest 
ages, and is mentioned by ancient writers, but with 
the addition of many fables, as that they were all of 
the male sex ; that they became young again every 
year ; and that they rolled the pellets containing their 
eggs from sunrise to sunset every day, for twenty- 
eight days without intermissionf.” 

“ We frequently, notice in our evening walks,” says 
Mr. Knapp, “ the murmuring passage, and are often 
stricken by the heedless flight, of the great dorr- 
beetle ( Geotrupes stercorarius ), clocks, as the boys 
call them. But this evening my attention was called 
to them in particular, by the constant passing of such 
a number as to constitute something like a little 
stream ; and I was led to search into the object of 
their direct flight, as in general it is irregular and

seemingly inquisitive. I soon found that they dropped 
on some recent nuisance : but what powers of per- 
ception must these creatures possess, drawn from all 
distances and directions by the very little fetor which, 
in such a calm evening, could be diffused around, 
and by what inconceivable means could odours reach 
this beetle in such a manner as to rouse so inert an 
insect into action ! But it is appointed one of the 
great scavengers of the earth, and marvellously en- 
dowed with powers of sensation, and means of effect- 
ing this purpose of its being. Exquisitely fabricated 
as it is to receive impressions, yet probably it is not 
more highly gifted than any of the other innumerable 
creatures that wing their way around us, or creep 
about our paths, though by this one perceptible 
faculty, thus ‘ dimly seen,’ it excites our wonder and 
surprise. How wondrous then the whole ! 

“ The perfect cleanliness of these creatures is a 
very notable circumstance, when we consider that 
nearly their whole lives are passed in burrowing in 
the earth, and removing nuisances ; yet such is the 
admirable polish of their coating and limbs, that we 
very seldom find any soil adhering to them. The 
meloe, and some of the scarabsei, upon first emerging 
from their winter’s retreat, are commonly found with 
earth clinging to them ; but the removal of this is 
one of the first operations of the creature ; and all 
the beetle race, the chief occupation of which is 
crawling about the soil, and such dirty employs, are 
notwithstanding remarkable for the glossiness of 
their covering, and freedom from defilements of any 
kind. But purity of vesture seems to be a principal 
precept of nature, and observable throughout creation. 
Fishes, from the nature of the element in which they 
reside, can contract but little impurity. Birds are 
unceasingly attentive to neatness and lustration of 
their plumage. All the slug race, though covered 







with slimy matter calculated to collect extraneous 
things, and reptiles, are perfectly free from soil. The 
fur and hair of beasts, in a state of liberty and health, 
is never filthy, or sullied with dirt. Some birds 
roll themselves in dust, and, occasionally, particular 
beasts cover themselves with mire ; but this is not 
from any liking or inclination for such things, but 
to free themselves from annoyances, or to pre- 
vent the bites of insects. Whether birds in preening, 
and beasts in dressing themselves, be directed by 
any instinctive faculty, we know not ; but they evi- 
dently derive pleasure from the operation, and thus 
this feeling of enjoyment, even if the sole motive, 
becomes to them an essential source of comfort and 
of health*.” 

The rose or green chafer ( Cetonia aurcita), which is 
one of our prettiest native insects, is one of the bur- 
rowers, and for the purpose of depositing her eggs, 
digs, about the middle of June, into soft light 
ground. When she is seen at this operation, with 
her broad and delicate wings folded up in their shining 
green cases, speckled with white, it could hardly be 
imagined that she had but just descended from the 
air, or dropped down from some neighbouring rose. 

The proceedings of the Tumble-Dung Beetle of 
America {Scarab ecus pilularius, Linn.) are de- 
scribed in a very interesting manner by Catesby, 
in his ‘ Carolina.’ “ I have,” says he, “ attentively 
admired their industry, and mutual assisting of 
each other in rolling their globular balls from the 
place where they made them to that of their in- 
terment, which is usually the distance of some 
yards, more or less. This they perform breech fore- 
most, by raising their hind parts, and forcing along 



* Journal oi a Naturalist, p. 31 1 . 







the ball with their hind feet. Two or three of them 
are sometimes engaged in trundling one It all, which, 
from meeting with impediments on account of the 
unevenness of the ground, is sometimes deserted by 
them. It is, however, attempted by others with 
success, unless it happens to roll into some deep hol- 
low or chink, where they are constrained to leave it ; 
but they continue their work by rolling off the next 
ball that comes in their way. None of them seem 
to know their own balls, but an equal care for the 
whole appears to affect all the community. They 
form these pellets while the dung remains moist, and 
leave them to harden in the sun before they attempt 
to roll them. In their moving of them from place to 
place, both they and the balls may frequently be seen 
tumbling about over the little eminences that are in 
their way. They are not, however, easily discouraged ; 
and, by repeating their attempts, usually surmount 
the difficulties.” 

He further informs us that they “ find out their 
subsistence by the excellency of their noses, which 
direct them in their flight to newly-fallen dung, on 
which they immediately go to work, tempering it with 
a proper mixture of earth. So intent are they always 
upon their employment, that, though handled or 
otherwise interrupted, they are not to be deterred, 
but immediately on being freed, persist in their 
work without any apprehension of danger. They 
are said to be so exceedingly strong and active as to 
move about, with the greatest ease, things that are 
many times their own weight. Dr. Brichell was 
supping one evening in a planter’s house of North 
Carolina, when two of them were conveyed, without 
his knowledge, under the candlestick. A few blows 
were struck on the table, and, to his great surprise, 
the candlesticks began to move about, apparently 
without any agency ; and his surprise was not much 



 



lessened when, on taking one of them up, he dis- 
covered that it was only a chafer that moved.” 

We have often found the necklace-beetle ( Cardbus 
monilis ) inhabiting a chamber dug out in the earth 
of a garden, just sufficient to contain its body, and 
carefully smoothed and polished. From the form of 
this little nest, it would seem as if it were constructed, 
not by digging out the earth and removing it, but 
•chiefly by the insect pushing its body forcibly against 
the walls. The beetles which we have found nestling 
in this manner have been all males ; and therefore it 
cannot be intended for a breeding cell ; for male 
insects are never, we believe, sufficiently generous 
to their mates to assist them in such labours. The 
beetle in question appears to be partial to celery 
trenches* ; probably from the loose earth of which 
they are composed yielding, without much difficulty, 
to the pressure of its body.

All the species of ants are social. There are none 
solitary, as is the case with bees and wasps. They are 
all more or less skilful in architecture, some employ- 
ing masonry, and others being carpenters, wood- 
carvers, and miners. They consequently afford much 
that is interesting to naturalists who observe their 
operations. The genuine history of ants has only 
been recently investigated, first by Gould in 1747, 
and subsequently by Linnaeus, De Geer, Huber, 
and Latreille. Previous to that time their real indus- 
try, and their imagined foresight, were held up as 
moral lessons, without any great accuracy of observa- 
tion ; and it is probable that, even now, the mixture 
of truth and error in Addison’s delightful papers in 
the Guardian (Nos. 156, 157), may be more gene- 
rally attractive than the minute relations of careful 
naturalists. Gould disproved, most satisfactorily, 
the ancient fable of ants storing up corn for winter 
provision, no species of ants ever eating grain, or 
feeding in the winter upon anything. It is to 
Huber the younger, however, that we are chiefly in- 
debted for our knowledge of the habits and economy 
of ants ; and to Latreille for a closer distinction of 
the species. Some of the more interesting species, 
whose singular economy is described by the younger 
Huber, have not been hitherto found in this country. 
We shall, however, discover matter of very consider- 
able interest in those which are indigenous ; and as 
our principal object is to excite inquiry and observa- 
tion with regard to those insects which may be 
easily watched in our own gardens and fields, we 







shall chiefly confine ourselves to the ants of these 
islands. We shall begin with the labours of 
those native ants which may be called earth-masons, 
from their digging in the ground, and forming struc- 
tures with pellets of moistened loam, clay, or sand. 

Mason-Ants. 

We have used in the preceding pages, the terms 
mason-bees and mason-wasps , for insects which build 
their nests of earthy materials. On the same prin- 
ciple, we have followed the ingenious M. Huber the 
younger, in employing the term mason-ants for those 
whose nests on the exterior appear to be hillocks of 
earth, without the admixture of other materials, 
whilst in the interior they present a series of laby- 
rinths, lodges, vaults, and galleries, constructed with 
considerable skill. Of these mason-ants, as of the 
mason-wasps and bees already described, there are 
several species, differing from one another in their 
skill in the art of architecture. 

One of the most common of the ant-masons is 
the turf-ant ( Formica ccespitum , Latr.), which is of 
a blackish brown colour. Its architecture is not upon 
quite so extensive a scale as some of the others ; 
but, though slight, it is very ingenious. Sometimes 
they make choice of the shelter of a flat stone or 
other covering, beneath which they hollow out cham- 
bers and communicating galleries ; at other times 
they are contented with the open ground ; but most 
commonly they select a tuft of grass or other herbage, 
the stems of which serve for columns to their earthen 
walls. 

We had a small colony of these ants accidentally 
established in a flower-pot, in which we were rearing 
some young plants of the tiger-lily ( Liliumtigrinum ), 
the stems of which being stronger than the grass 
where they usually build, enabled them to rear their 




edifice higher, and also to make it more secure, than 
they otherwise might. It was wholly formed of 
small grains of moist earth, piled up between the 
stems of the lily without any apparent cement ; in- 
deed it has been ascertained by Huber, as we shall 
afterwards see, that they use no cement beside water. 
This is not always to be procured, as they depend 
altogether on rains and dew ; but they possess the art 
of joining grains of dry sand so as to support one 
another, on some similar principle, no doubt, to that 
of the arch. 

The nest which our turf-ants constructed in the 
flower-pot was externally of an imperfect square form, 
in consequence of its situation; for they usually prefer 
a circular plan. The principal chambers were placed 
under the arches, and, when inspected, contained a 
pile of cocoons and pupae. Beneath those upper 
chambers there were others dug out deeper down, in 
which were also a numerous collection of e£2*s and 
cocoons in various stages of advancement*. 

Mr. Knapp describes a still more curious structure 
of another species of ant common in this country : — 
“ One year,” says he, “ on the third of March, my 
labourer being employed in cutting up ant-hills, or 
tumps as we call them, exposed to view multitudes 
of the yellow species ( Formica flava) in their 
winter’s retirement. They were collected in numbers 
in little cells and compartments, communicating with 
others by means of narrow passages. In many of 
the cells they had deposited their larvse, which they 
were surrounding and attending, but not brooding 
over or covering. Being disturbed by our rude ope- 
rations, they removed them from our sight to more 
hidden compartments. The larvse were small. Some 
of these ant-hills contained multitudes of the young 
of the wood-louse (Oniscus armadillo ), inhabiting 

* J. It, 







with perfect familiarity the same compartments as 
the ants, crawling about with great activity with 
them, and perfectly domesticated with each other. 
They were small and white ; but the constant vibra- 
tion of their antennae, and the alacrity of their 
motions, manifested a healthy vigour. The ants were 
in a torpid state ; but on being removed into a tem- 
perate room, they assumed much of their summer’s 
animation. How these creatures are supported 
during the winter season it is difficult to compre- 
hend ; as in no one instance could we perceive any 
store or provision made for the supply of their 
wants. The minute size of the larvae manifested 
that they had been recently deposited ; and conse- 
quently that their parents had not remained during 
winter in a dormant state, and thus free from the 
calls of hunger. The preceding month of February, 
and part of January, had been remarkably severe; 
the frost had penetrated deep into the earth, and long 
held it frozen ; the ants were in many cases not more 
than four inches beneath the surface, and must have 
been enclosed in a mass of frozen soil for a lone: 
period ; yet they, their young, and the onisci, were 
perfectly uninjured by it : affording another proof 
of the fallacy of the commonly received opinion, that 
cold is universally destructive to insect life 

The earth employed by mason-ants is usually 
moist clay, either dug from the interior parts of their 
city, or moistened by rain. The mining-ants and the 
ash-coloured (Formica fusca) employ earth which is 
probably not selected with so much care, for it forms 
a much coarser mortar than what we see used in the 
structures of the yellow ants (F. jlavci) and . the 
brown ants (F. brunnea). We have never observed 
them bringing their building materials of this kind 
from a distance, like the mason-bees and like the

wood or hill ant (F. rvfo ); but they take care before 
they fix upon a locality, that it shall produce them 
all that they recpiire. We are indebted to Huber 
the younger for the most complete account which 
has hitherto been given of these operations, of which 
details we shall make free use. 

“To form,” says this shrewd observer, “ a correct 
judgment of the interior arrangement or distribution of 
an ant-hill, it is necessary to select such as have not 
been accidentally spoiled, or whose form has not 
been too much altered by local circumstances ; a 
slight attention will then suffice to shew, that the ha- 
bitations of the different species are not all constructed 
after the same system. Thus, the hillock raised by 
the ash-coloured ants will always present thick walls, 
fabricated with Coarse earth, well-marked stories, and 
large chambers, with vaulted ceilings, resting upon 
a solid base. We never observe roads, or galleries, 
properly so called, but large passages, of an oval 
form, and all around considerable cavities and exten- 
sive embankments of earth. We further notice, 
that the little architects observe a certain proportion 
between the large arched ceilings and the pillars that 
are to support them. 

“ The brown ant ( Formica brunnea ), one of the 
smallest of the ants, is particularly remarkable for 
the extreme finish of its work. Its body is of a red- 
dish shining brown, its head a little deeper, and the 
antennae and feet a little lighter in colour. The ab- 
domen is of an obscure brown, the scale narrow, of 
a square form, and slightly scolloped. The body is 
one line and two-fifths in length*. 

“ This ant, one of the most industrious of its tribe, 
forms its nest of stories, four or five lines in height. 
The partitions are not more than half a line in thick- 
ness; and the substance of which they are composed 

* A line is the twelfth part of the old French inch. See Com- 
panion to the Almanac for 1830, p. 114. 







is so finely grained, that the inner walls present one 
smooth unbroken surface. These stories are not 
horizontal ; they follow the slope of the ant-hill, and 
lie one upon another to the ground-floor, which com- 
municates with the subterranean lodges. They are 
not always, however, arranged with the same regu- 
larity, for these ants do not follow an invariable 
plan ; it appears, on the contrary, that nature has 
allowed them a certain latitude in this respect, and that 
they can, according to circumstances, modify them 
to their wish ; but, however fantastical their habita- 
tions may appear, we always observe they have been 
formed by concentrical stories. On examining each 
story separately, we observe a number of cavities or 
halls, lodges of narrower dimensions, and long gal- 
leries, which serve for general communication. The 
arched ceilings covering the most spacious places 
are supported either by little columns, slender walls, 
or by regular buttresses. We also notice chambers, 
that have but one entrance, communicating with the 
lower story, and large open spaces, serving as a kind 
of cross-road ( carrefour ), in which all the streets 
terminate. 

“ Such is the manner in which the habitations of 
these ants are constructed. Upon opening them, we 
commonly find the apartments, as well as the large 
open spaces, filled with adult ants ; and always ob- 
serve their pupae collected in the apartments more 
or less near the surface. This, however, seems re- 
gulated by the hour of the day, and the temperature : 
for in this respect these ants are endowed with great 
sensibility, and know the degree of heat best adapted for 
their young. The ant-hill contains, sometimes, more 
than twenty stories in its upper portion, and at least 
as many under the surface of the ground. By this 
arrangement the ants are enabled, with the greatest 
facility, to regulate the heat. When a too burning 
sun over-heats their upper apartments, they withdraw 







their little ones to the bottom of the ant-hill. The 
ground-floor becoming, in its turn, uninhabitable 
during the rainy season, the ants of this species 
transport what most interests them to the higher 
stories ; and it is there we find them more usually 
assembled, with their eggs and pupae, when the sub- 
terranean apartments are submerged*.” 

Ants have a great dislike to water, when it exceeds 
that of a lig;ht shower to moisten their building: ma- 
terials. One species, mentioned by De Azara as in- 
digenous to South America, instinctively builds a 
nest from three to six feet highf, to provide against 
the inundations during the rainy season. Even this, 
however, does not always save them from submer- 
sion ; and, when that occurs, they are compelled, 
in order to prevent themselves from being swept 
away, to form a group, somewhat similar to the cur- 
tain of the wax-workers of hive-bees (see page 114). 
The ants constituting the basis of this group, lay 
hold of some shrub for security, while their compa- 
nions hold on by them ; and thus the whole colony, 
forming an animated raft, floats on the surface of the 
water till the inundation (which seldom continues 
longer than a day or two) subsides. 

It is usual with architectural insects to employ 
some animal secretion, by way of mortar or size, to 
temper the materials with which they work ; but the 
whole economy of ants is so different, that it would 
be wrong to infer from analogy a similarity in this 
respect, though the exquisite polish and extreme de- 
licacy of finish in their structures, lead, naturally, to 
such a conclusion. M. P. Huber, in order to resolve 
this question, at first thought of subjecting the ma- 
terials of the walls to chemical analysis, but wisely 
(as we think) abandoned it for the surer method of 
observation. The details which he has given, as the

result of his researches, are exceedingly curious and 
instructive. He began by observing an ant-hill till 
he could perceive some change in its form. 

“ The inhabitants,” says he, “ of that which I 
selected, kept within during the day, or only went out 
by subterranean galleries which opened at some feet 
distance in the meadow. There were, however, two 
or three small openings on the surface of the nest ; 
but I saw none of the labourers pass out this way, 
on account of their being too much exposed to the 
sun, which these insects greatly dread. This ant- 
hill, which had a round form, rose in the grass, at 
the border of a path, and had sustained no injury. 
I soon perceived that the freshness of the air and the 
dew invited the ants to walk over the surface of their 
nest; they began making new apertures; several 
ants might be seen arriving at the same time, thrust- 
ing their heads from the entrances, moving about 
their antennae, and at length adventuring forth to 
visit the environs. 

“ This brought to my recollection a singular opi- 
nion of the ancients. They believed that ants were 
occupied in their architectural labours during the 
night, when the moon was at its full *.” 

M. Latreille discovered a species of ants which 
were, so far as he could ascertain, completely blind f, 
and of course it would be immaterial to them whether 
they worked by night or during the day. All ob- 
servers indeed agree that ants labour in the night, 
and a French naturalist is therefore of opinion that 
they never sleep, — a circumstance which is well as- 
certained with respect to other animals, such as the 
shark, which will track a ship in full sail for weeks 
togetherj. The ingenious historian of English ants,

Gould, says they never intermit their labours by night 
or by day, except when compelled by excessive rains. 
It is probable the ancients were mistaken in asserting 
that they only work when the moon shines * ; for, 
like bees, they seem to find no difficulty in building 
in the dark, their subterranean apartments being as 
well finished as the upper stories of their buildings. 
But to proceed with the narrative of M. P. Huber. 

“ Having thus noticed the movements of these 
insects during the night, I found they were almost 
always abroad and engaged about the dome of their 
habitation after sunset. This was directly the reverse 
of what I had observed in the conduct of the wood- 
ants, (F. rufa ,) who only go out during the day, and 
close their doors in the evening. The contrast was 
still more remarkable than I had previously supposed ; 
for upon visiting the brown ants some days after, 
during a gentle rain, I saw all their architectural 
talents in full play. 

“As soon as the rain commenced, they left in 
great numbers their subterranean residence, re-entered 
it almost immediately, and then returned, bearing 
between their teeth pellets of earth, which they de- 
posited on the roof of their nest. I could not at first 
conceive what this was meant for, but at length I 
saw little walls start up on all sides with spaces left 
between them. In several places, columns, ranged at 
regular distances, announced halls, lodges, and pas- 
sages, which the ants proposed establishing; in a 
word, it was the rough beginning of a new story. 

“ I watched with a considerable degree of interest 
the most trifling movements of my masons, and 
found they did not work after the manner of wasps 

* Aristotle, Hist. Animal, ix. 38. Pliny says “ Operantur et 
noctu plena luna ; eadem interlunio cessant,” i. e. They work in 
the night at full moon, hut they leave off between moon and 
moon. It is the latter that we think doubtful. 







and humble-bees, when occupied in constructing a 
covering to their nest. The latter sit, as it were, 
astride on the border or margin of the covering, and 
take it between their teeth to model and attenuate it 
according to their wish. The wax of which it is 
composed, and the paper which the wasp employs, 
moistened by some kind of glue, are admirably 
adapted for this purpose, but the earth of which the 
ants make use, from its often possessing little tena- 
city, must be worked up after some other manner. 

“ Each ant, then, carried between its teeth the 
pellet of earth it had formed by scraping with the 
end of its mandibles the bottom of its abode, a 
circumstance which I have frequently witnessed in 
open day. This little mass of earth, being composed 
of particles but just united, could be readily kneaded 
and moulded as the ants wished ; thus, when they 
had applied it to the spot where they had to rest, 
they divided and pressed against it with their teeth, 
so as to fill up the little inequalities of their wall. 
The antenna; followed all their movements, passing 
over each particle of earth as soon as it was placed 
in its proper position. The whole was then rendered 
more compact, by pressing it lightly with the fore- 
feet. This work went on remarkably fast. After 
having traced out the plan of their masonry, in laying 
here and there foundations for the pillars and par- 
titions they were about to erect, they raised them 
gradually higher, by adding fresh materials. It 
often happened that two little walls, which were to 
form a gallery, were raised opposite, and at a slight 
distance from, each other. When they had attained 
the height of four or five lines, the ants busied 
themselves in covering in the space left between them 
by a vaulted ceiling. 

“ As if they judged all their partitions of sufficient 
elevation, they then quitted their labours in the 



 



upper part of the building* ; they affixed to the 
interior and upper part of each wall, fragments of 
moistened earth, in an almost horizontal direction, 
and in such a way as to form a ledge, which, by 
extension, would be made to join that coming from 
the opposite wall. These ledges were about half a 
line in thickness ; and the breadth of the galleries 
was, for the most part, about a quarter of an inch. 
On one side several vertical partitions were seen to 
form the scaffolding of a lodge, which communicated 
with several corridors, by apertures formed in the 
masonry ; on another, a regularly-formed hall was 
constructed, the vaulted ceiling of which was sus- 
tained by numerous pillars ; further off, again, might 
be recognised the rudiments of one of those cross 
roads of which I have before spoken, and in which 
several avenues terminate. These parts of the ant- 
hill were the most spacious ; the ants, however, did 
not appear embarrassed in constructing the ceiling 
to cover them in, although they were often more 
than two inches in breadth. 

“In the upper part of the angles formed by the 
different walls, they laid the first foundations of this 
ceiling, and from the top of each pillar, as from so 
many centres, a layer of earth, horizontal and slightly 
convex, was carried forward to meet the several 
portions coming from different points of the large 
public thoroughfare. 

“ I sometimes, however, laboured under an ap- 
prehension that the building could not possibly 
resist its own weight, and that such extensive ceilings, 
sustained only by a few pillars, would fall into ruin 
from the rain which continually dropped upon them ; 
but I was quickly convinced of their stability, from 
observing that the earth, brought by these insects, 
adhered at all points, on the slightest contact ; and 
that the rain, so far from lessening the cohesion of 







its particles, appeared even to increase it. Thus, 
instead of injuring' the building, it even contributed 
to render it still more secure. 

“ These particles of moistened earth, which are 
only held together by juxtaposition, require a fall of 
raiu to cement them more closely, and thus varnish 
over, as it were, those places where the walls and 
galleries remain uncovered. All inequalities in the ma- 
sonry then disappear. The upper part of these stories, 
formed of several pieces brought together, presents 
but one single layer of compact earth. They require 
for their complete consolidation nothing but the 
heat of the sun. It sometimes, however, happens 
that a violent rain will destroy the apartments, 
especially should they be but slightly arched; but 
under these circumstances the ants reconstruct them 
with wonderful patience. 

“ These different labours were carried on at the 
same time, and were so closely followed up in the 
different quarters, that the ant-hill received an addi- 
tional story in the course of seven or eight hours. 
All the vaulted ceilings being formed upon a regular 
plan, and at equal distances from one wall to the 
other, constituted, when finished, but one single 
roof. Scarcely had the ants finished one story than 
they began to construct another ; but they had not 
time to finish it — the rain ceasing before the ceiling 
was fully completed. They still, however, continued 
their work for a few hours, taking advantage of the 
humidity of the earth ; but a keen north wind soon 
sprung up, and hastily dried the collected fragments, 
which, no longer possessing the same adherence, 
readily fell into powder. The ants, finding their 
efforts ineffectual, were at length discouraged, and 
abandoned their employment ; but what was my 
astonishment when I saw them destroy all the apart- 
ments that were yet uncovered, scattering here and 

 



there over the last story the materials of which they 
had been composed ! These facts incontestably 
prove, that they employ neither gum, nor any kind 
of cement, to bind together the several substances 
of their nest ; but in place of this avail themselves of 
the rain, to work or knead the earth, leaving the sun 
and wind to dry and consolidate it*.” 

Dr. J ohnson of Bristol observed very similar pro- 
ceedings in the case of a colony of red ants ( Myr - 
mica rubra, ?), the roof of whose nest was formed 
by a flat stone. During dry weather, a portion of 
the side walls fell in ; but the rubbish was quickly 
removed, though no repairs were attempted till a 
shower of rain enabled them to work. As soon as 
this occurred, they worked with extraordinary rapi- 
dity, and in a short time the whole of the fallen 
parts were rebuilt, and rendered as smooth as if 
polished with a trowel. 

When a gardener wishes to water a plot of ground 
where he has sown seeds that recpiire nice manage- 
ment, he dips a strong brush into water, and passes 
his hand backwards and forwards over the hairs for 
the purpose of producing a fine artificial shower. 
Huber successfully adopted the same method to excite 
his ants to recommence their labours, which had been 
interrupted for want of moisture. But sometimes 
when they deem it unadvisable to wait for rain, they 
dig down (as we remarked to be the practice of the 
mason-bees) till they arrive at earth sufficiently moist 
for their purpose. They do not, however, like these 
bees, merely dig for materials ; for they use the exca- 
vations for apartments, as well as what they construct 
with the materials thence derived. They appear, in 
short, to be no less skilful in mining than in building. 

Such is the general outline of the operations of 



* M, P. Huber on Ants, p. 31. 







this singular species; but we are still more interested 
with the history which M. P. Huber has given of the 
labours of an individual ant. “ One rainy day,” 
he says, “ I observed a labourer of the dark ash- 
coloured species (Formica fusca) digging the ground 
near the aperture which gave entrance to the ant- 
hill. It placed in a heap the several fragments it 
had scraped up, and formed them into small pellets, 
which it deposited here and there upon the nest. 
It returned constantly to the same place, and ap- 
peared to have a particular design, for it laboured 
with ardour and perseverance. I remarked a slight 
furrow, excavated in the ground in a straight line, 
representing the plan of a path or gallery. The 
labourer (the whole of whose movements fell under 
my immediate observation) gave it greater depth and 
breadth, and cleared out its borders ; and I saw, at 
length — in which I could not be deceived — that it 
had the intention of establishing an avenue which 
was to lead from one of the stories to the under- 
ground chambers. This path, which was about two 
or three inches in length, and formed by a single 
ant, was opened above, and bordered on each side 
by a buttress of earth. Its concavity, in the form 
of a pipe ( gouttiere ), was of the most perfect regu- 
larity ; for the architect had not left an atom too 
much. The work of this ant was so well followed 
and understood, that I could almost to a certainty 
guess its next proceeding, and the very fragment it 
was about to remove. At the side of the opening 
where this path terminated was a second opening, 
to which it was necessary to arrive by some road. 
The same ant began and finished this undertaking 
without assistance. It furrowed out and opened 
another path, parallel to the first, leaving between 
each a little wall of three or four lines in height.” 
Like the hive-bees, ants do not seem to work 





in concert, but each individual separately. There 
is, consequently, an occasional want of coincidence 
in the walls and arches ; but this does not much 
embarrass them, for a worker, on discovering an 
error of this kind, seems to know how to rectify it, 
as appears from the following observations. 

“ A wall,” says M. Huber, “ had been erected, 
with the view of sustaining a vaulted ceiling, still 
incomplete, that had been projected towards the wall 
of the opposite chamber. The workman who began 
constructing it, had given it too little elevation to 
meet the opposite partition, upon which it was to 
rest. Had it been continued on the original plan, it 
must infallibly have met the wall at about one half 
of its height ; and this it was necessary to avoid. 
This state of things very forcibly claimed my atten- 
tion ; when one of the ants arriving at the place, and 
visiting the works, appeared to be struck by the dif- 
ficulty which presented itself ; but this it as soon 
obviated, by taking down the ceiling, and raising the 
wall upon which it reposed. It then, in my presence, 
constructed a new ceiling with the fragments of the 
former one. 

“ When the ants commence any undertaking, one 
would suppose that they worked after some precon- 
ceived idea, which, indeed, would seem verified by 
the execution. Thus, should any ant discover upon 
the nest two stalks of plants which lie crossways, a 
disposition favourable to the construction of a lodge, 
or some little beams that may be useful in forming 
its angles and sides, it examines the several parts 
with attention ; then distributes, with much sagacity 
and address, parcels of earth in the spaces, and 
along the stems, taking from every quarter materials 
adapted to its object, sometimes not caring to destroy 
the work that others had commenced ; so much are 
its motions regulated by the idea it has conceived, 







and upon which it acts, with little attention to all 
else around it. It goes and returns, until the plan 
is sufficiently understood by its companions, 

“ In another part of the same ant-hill,” continues 
M. Huber, “ several fragments of straw seemed ex- 
pressly placed to form the roof of a large house ; a 
workman took advantage of this disposition. These 
fragments lying horizontally, at half an inch distance 
from the ground, formed, in crossing each other, an 
oblong parallelogram. The industrious insect com- 
menced by placing earth in the several angles of this 
frame-work, and all along the little beams of which 
it was composed. The same workman afterwards 
placed several rows of the same materials against 
each other, when the roof became very distinct. On 
perceiving the possibility of profiting by another 
plant to support a vertical wall, it began laying the 
foundations of it ; other ants having by this time 
arrived, finished in common what this had com- 
menced 

M. Huber made most of his observations upon the 
processes followed by ants in glazed artificial hives

or formicaries. The preceding figure represents a 
view of one of his formicaries of mason-ants. 

We have ourselves followed up his observations, 
both on natural ant-hills and in artificial formicaries. 
On digging cautiously into a natural ant-hill, esta- 
blished upon the edge of a garden walk, we were 
enabled to obtain a pretty complete view of the in- 
terior structure. There were two stories, composed 
of large chambers, irregularly oval, communicating 
with each other by arched galleries, the walls of all 
which were as smooth and well polished as if they 
had been passed over by a plasterer’s trowel. The 
floors of the chambers, we remarked, were by no 
means either horizontal or level, but all more or less 
sloped, and exhibiting in each chamber at least two 
slight depressions of an irregular shape. We left 
the under story of this nest untouched, with the 
notion that the ants might repair the upper galleries, 
of which we had made a vertical section ; but instead 
of doing so they migrated during the day to a large 
crack, formed by the dryness of the weather, about 
a yard from their old nest*. 




We put a number of yellow ants {Formica Jiava), 
with their eggs and cocoons, into a small glass frame, 
more than half full of moist sand taken from their 
native hill, and placed in a sloping position, in order 



* J. R. 







to see whether they would bring the nearly vertical, 
and therefore insecure, portion to a level by masonry. 
We were delighted to perceive that they immediately 
resolved upon performing the task which had been 
assigned them, though they did not proceed very 
methodically in their manner of building ; for instead 
of beginning at the bottom, and building upwards, 
many of them went on to add to the top of the outer 
surface, which increased rather than diminished the 
security of the whole. Withal, however, they seemed 
to know how far to go, for no portion of the newly 
built wall fell ; and in two days they had not only 
reared a pyramidal mound to prop the rest, but had 
constructed several galleries and chambers for lodging 
the cocoons, which we had scattered at random 
amongst the sand. The new portion of this building 
is represented in the figure as supporting the upper 
and insecure parts of the nest. 




We are sorry to record that our ingenious little 
masons were found upon the third day strewed about 
the outside of the building dead or dying, either from 
over fatigue or perhaps from surfeit, as we had sup- 
plied them with as much honey as they could devour. 
A small colony of turf-ants have at this moment 
(July 28th, 1829) taken possession of the premises 
of their own accord*. 



* J. R. 





The largest of our British ants is that called the Hill- 
ant by Gould, the Fallow-ant by the English trans- 
lator of Huber, and popularly the Pismire ; but which 
we think may be more appropriately named the Wood- 
ant ( Formica rufa , Latr.) from its invariable habit 
of living in or near woods and forests. This insect 
may be readily distinguished from other ants by the 
dusky black colour of its head and hinder parts, and 
the rusty brown of its middle. The structures reared 
by this species are often of considerable magnitude, 
and bear no small resemblance to a rook’s nest thrown 
upon the ground, bottom upwards. They occur in 
abundance in the woods near London, and in many 
other parts of the country: in Oak of Honour wood 
alone, we are acquainted with the localities of at 
least two dozen, — some in the interior and others on 
the hedge-banks on the outskirts of the wood*. 

The exterior of the nest is composed of almost 
every transportable material which the colonists can 
find in their vicinity; but the greater portion consists 
of the stems of withered grass and short twigs of 
trees, piled up in apparent confusion, but with suf- 
ficient regularity to render the whole smooth, conical, 
and sloping towards the base, for the purpose, we 
may infer, of carrying off rain water. When within 
reach of a corn-field, they often also pick up grains 
of wheat, barley, or oats, and carry them to the nest

as building materials, and not for food as was be- 
lieved by the ancients. There are wonders enough 
observable in the economy of ants, without having 
recourse to fancy — wonders which made Aristotle 
extol the sagacity of bloodless animals, and Cicero 
ascribe to them not only sensation, but mind, reason, 
and memory *. iElian, however, describes, as if he 
had actually witnessed it, the ants ascending a stalk 
of growing corn, and throwing down “ the ears 
which they bit off to their companions below,” (t iv 
drjpio t uj /caTiv). Aldrovandus assures us that he 
had seen their granaries ; and others pretend that 
they shrewdly bite off the ends of the grain to pre- 
vent it from germinating t- These are fables which 
accurate observation has satisfactorily contradicted. 

But these errors, as it frequently happens, have 
contributed to a more perfect knowledge of the insects 
than we might otherwise have obtained ; for it was 
the wish to prove or disprove the circumstance of 
their storing up and feeding upon grain, which led 
Gould to make his observations on English ants ; as 
the notion of insects being produced from putrid 
carcases had before led Redi to his ingenious experi- 
ments on their generation. Yet, although it is more 
than eighty years since Gould’s book was published, 
we find the error still repeated in very respectable 
publications J. 

The coping which we above described as forming 
the exterior of the wood-ant’s nest, is only a small 
portion of the structure, which consists of a great 
number of interior chambers and galleries, with fun- 
nel-shaped avenues leading to them. The coping,

indeed, is one of the most essential parts, and we 
cannot follow a more delightful guide than the 
younger Huber, in detailing its formation. 

“The labourers,” he says, “of which the colony 
is composed, not only work continually on the out- 
side of their nest, but, differing very essentially from 
other species, who willingly remain in the interior, 
sheltered from the sun, they prefer living in the open 
air, and do not hesitate to carry on, even in our pre- 
sence, the greater part of their operations. 

“ To have an idea how the straw or stubble-roof is 
formed, let us take a view of the ant-hill at its origin, 
when it is simply a cavity in the earth. Some of its 
future inhabitants are seen wandering about in 
search of materials fit for the exterior work, with 
which, though rather irregularly, they cover up the 
entrance ; whilst others are employed in mixing the 
earth, thrown up in hollowing the interior, with 
fragments of wood and leaves, which are every mo- 
ment brought in by their fellow-assistants ; and this 
gives a certain consistence to the edifice, which in- 
creases in size daily. Our little architects leave here 
and there cavities, where they intend constructing 
the galleries which are to lead to the exterior, and as 
they remove in the morning the barriers placed at the 
entrance of their nest the preceding evening, the pas- 
sages are kept open during the whole time of its con- 
struction. We soon observed the roof to become con- 
vex ; but we should be greatly deceived did we con- 
sider it solid. This roof is destined to include many 
apartments or stories. Having observed the mo- 
tions of these little builders through a pane of 
glass, adjusted against one of their habitations, I 
am thence enabled to speak with some degree of 
certainty upon the manner in which they are con- 
structed. 1 ascertained, that it is by excavating, or 







mining' the under portion of their edifice, that they 
form their spacious halls, low indeed, and of heavy 
construction, yet sufficiently convenient for the use to 
which they are appropriated, that of receiving, at cer - 
tain hours of the day, the larvae and pupae. 

“ These halls have a free communication by gal- 
leries, made in the same manner. If the materials 
of which the ant-hill is composed were only inter- 
laced, they would fall into a confused heap every 
time the ants attempted to bring them into regular 
order. This, however, is obviated by their tempering 
the earth with rain-water, which, afterwards hardened 
in the sun, so completely and effectually binds to- 
gether the several substances, as to permit the re- 
moval of certain fragments from the ant-hill without 
any injury to the rest; it, moreover, strongly opposes 
the introduction of the rain. I never found, even 
after long and violent rains, the interior of the nest 
wetted to more than a quarter of an inch from the 
surface, provided it had not been previously out of 
repair, or deserted by its inhabitants. 

“ The ants are extremely well sheltered in their 
chambers, the largest of which is placed nearly in 
the centre of the building; it is much loftier than 
the rest, and traversed only by the beams that sup- 
port the ceiling ; it is in this spot that all the gal- 
leries terminate, and this forms, for the most part, 
their usual residence. 

“ As to the underground portion, it can only be 
seen when the ant-hill is placed against a declivity ; 
all the interior may be then readily brought in view, 
by simply raising up the straw-roof. The subter- 
ranean residence consists of a range of apartments, 
excavated in the earth, taking an horizontal direc- 
tion 



* Huber on Ants ; p. 15. 



 



M. P. Huber, in order to observe the operations of 
the wood-ant with more attention, transferred colo- 
nies of them to his artificial formicaries, plunging the 
feet of the stand into water to prevent their escape till 




they were reconciled to their abode, and had made 
some progress in repairing it. The preceding is a 
figure of the apparatus which he used for this pur- 
pose. 

There is this remarkable difference in the nest of 
the wood-ants, that they do not construct a long co- 
vert way as if for concealment, as the yellow and the 
brown ants do. The wood-ants are not, like them, 
afraid of being surprised by enemies, at least during 
the day, when the whole colony is either foraging in 
the vicinity or employed on the exterior. But the 
proceedings of the wood-ants at night are well wor- 
thy of notice; and when M. Huber began to study 







their economy, he directed his entire attention to 
their night proceedings. “ I remarked,” says he, 
“ that their habitations changed in appearance hourly, 
and that the diameter of those spacious avenues, 
where so many ants could freely pass each other 
during the day, was, as night approached, gradually 
lessened. The aperture, at length, totally disap- 
peared, the dome was closed on all sides, and the 
ants retired to the bottom of their nest. 

“ In further noticing the apertures of these ant- 
hills, I fully ascertained the nature of the labour of its 
inhabitants, of which I could not before even guess 
the purport ; for the surface of the nest presented 
such a constant scene of agitation, and so many in- 
sects were occupied in carrying materials in every 
direction, that the movement offered no other image 
than that of confusion. 

“ I saw then clearly that they were engaged in 
stopping up passages ; and for this purpose, they at 
first brought forward little pieces of wood, which 
they deposited near the entrance of those avenues 
they wished to close ; they placed them in the stubble ; 
they then went to seek other twigs and fragments 
of wood, which they disposed above the first, but in 
a different direction, and appeared to choose pieces 
of less size in proportion as the work advanced. 
They, at length, brought in a number of dried leaves, 
and other materials of an enlarged form, with which 
they covered the roof : an exact miniature of the art 
of our builders, when they form the covering of any 
building? Nature, indeed, seems everywhere to 
have anticipated the inventions of which we boast, 
and this is doubtless one of the most simple. 

“ Our little insects, now in safety in their nest, 
retire gradually to the interior before the last pas- 
sages are closed, one or two only remain without, or 









concealed behind the doors on guard, whilst the rest 
either take their repose, or engage in different occu- 
pations in the most perfect security. I was impatient 
to know what took place in the morning upon these 
ant-hills, and therefore visited them at an early 
hour. I found them in the same state in which I 
had left them the preceding evening. A few ants 
were wandering about on the surface of the nest, 
some others issued from time to time from under the 
margin of their little roofs formed at the entrance of 
the galleries : others afterwards came forth, who be- 
gan removing the wooden bars that blockaded the 
entrance, in which they readily succeeded. This 
labour occupied them several hours. The passages 
were at length free, and the materials with which 
they had been closed, scattered here and there over 
the ant-hill. Every day, morning and evening, 
during the fine weather, I was a witness to similar 
proceedings. On days of rain the doors of all the 
ant-hills remained closed. When the sky was cloudy 
in the morning, or rain was indicated, the ants, who 
seemed to be aware of it, opened but in part their 
several avenues, and immediately closed them when 
the rain commenced*.” 

The galleries and chambers which are roofed in 
as thus described, are very similar to those of the 
mason-ants, being partly excavated in the earth, and 
partly built with the clay thence procured. It is in 
these they pass the night, and also the colder months 
of the winter, when they become torpid or nearly 
so, and of course require not the winter granaries of 
corn with which the ancients fabulously furnished 
them.

Carpenter-Ants. 

The ants that work in wood perform much more 
extensive operations than any of the other carpenter 
insects which we have mentioned. Their only tools, 
like those of bees and wasps, are their jaws or man- 
dibles ; but though these may not appear so curiously 
constructed as the ovipositor file of the tree-hopper 
( Cicadee ), or the rasp and saw of the saw-flies ( Ten - 
thredincs ), they are no less efficient in the perform- 
ance of what is required. Among’ the carpenter-ants 
the emmet or jet-ant (F. fuliginosa ) holds the first 
rank, and is easily known by being rather less in 
size than the wood-ant, and by its fine shining black 
colour. It is less common in Britain than some of 
the preceding, though its colonies may occasionally 
be met with in the trunks of decaying oak or willow 
trees in hedges. 

“ The labourers,” says Huber, “ of this species, 
work always in the interior of trees, and are desirous 
of being screened from observation ; thus every hope 
on our part is precluded of following them in their 
several occupations. I tried every expedient I could 
devise to surmount this difficulty ; I endeavoured to 
accustom these ants to live and work under my in- 
spection, but all my efforts were unsuccessful ; they 
even abandoned the most considerable portion of 
their nest to seek some new asylum, and spurned the 
honey and sugar which I offered them for nourish- 
ment. I was now, by necessity, limited to the in- 
spection only of their edifices ; but by decomposing 
some of the fragments with care, I hoped to acquire 
some knowledge of their organization. 

“ On one side I found horizontal galleries, hidden 
in great part by their walls, which follow the circular 
direction of the layers of the wood ; and on an- 
other, parallel galleries, separated by extremely thin 





partitions, having no communication except by a 
few oval apertures. Such is the nature of these 
works, remarkable for their delicacy and lightness. 

“ In other fragments I found avenues which opened 
laterally, including portions of walls and transverse 
partitions, erected here and there within the galleries, 
so as to form separate chambers. When the work 
is further advanced, round holes are always observed, 
encased, as it were, between two pillars cut out in the 
same wall. These holes in course of time become 
square, and the pillars, originally arched at both 
ends, are worked into regular columns by the chisel 
of our sculptors. This, then, is the second specimen 
of their art. This portion of the edifice will probably 
remain in this state. 

“ But in another quarter are fragments differently 
wrought, in which these same partitions, pierced 
now in every part, and hewn skilfully, are trans- 
formed into colonnades, which sustain the upper 
stories, and leave a free communication throughout 
the whole extent. It can readily be conceived, how 
parallel galleries, hollowed out upon the same plan, 
and the sides taken down, leaving only from space 
to space what is necessary to sustain their ceilings, 
may form an entire story ; but as each has been 
pierced separately, the flooring cannot be very level : 
this, however, the ants turn to their advantage, since 
these furrows are better adapted to retain the larvae 
that may be placed there. 

“ The stories constructed in the great roots offer 
greater irregularity than those in the very body of the 
tree, arising either from the hardness and interlacing 
of the fibres, which renders the labour more difficult, 
and obliges the labourers to depart from their accus- 
tomed manner, or from their not observing in the 
extremities of their edifice the same arrangement as 
in the centre ; whatever it be, horizontal stories and

numerous partitions are still found. If the work be 
less regular, it becomes more delicate ; for the ants, 
profiting by the hardness and solidity of the mate- 
rials give to their building an extreme degree of 
lightness. I have seen fragments of from eisdit to 
ten inches in length, and of equal height, formed of 
wood as thin as paper, containing a number of apart- 
ments, and presenting the most singular appearance. 
At the entrance of these apartments, worked out 
with so much care, are very considerable openings ; 
but in place of chambers and extensive galleries, the 
layers of the wood are hewn in arcades, allowing the 
ants a free passage in every direction. These may 
be regarded as the gates or vestibules conducting to 
the several lodges*.” 

It is a singular circumstance in the structures of 
these ants, that all the wood which they carve is 
tinged of a black colour, as if it were smoked; and M. 
Huber was not a little solicitous to discover whence 
this arose. It certainly does not add to the beauty 



* Huber, p. 56. 







of their streets, which look as sombre as the most 
smoke-dyed walls in the older lanes of the metro- 
polis. M. Huber could not satisfy himself whether 
it was caused by the exposure of the wood to the 
atmosphere, by some emanation from the ants, or 
by the thin layers of wood being acted upon or de- 
composed by the formic acid. But if any or all 
of these causes operated in blackening the wood, 
we should be ready to anticipate a similar effect 
in the case of other species of ants which inhabit 
trees ; yet the black tint is only found in the exca- 
vations of the jet ant. 

We are acquainted with several colonies of the jet 
ants, — one of which, in the roots and trunk of an 
oak on the road from Lewisham to Sydenham, near 
Brockley in Kent, is so extremely populous, that the 
numbers of its inhabitants appeared to us beyond 
any reasonable estimate. None of the other colo- 
nies of this species which we have seen, appear to 
contain many hundreds. On cutting into the root 
of the before-mentioned tree, we found the vertical 
excavations of much larger dimensions, both in width 
and depth, than those represented by Huber in the 
preceding cut (page 2S1). What surprised us the 
most, was to see the tree growing vigorously and 
fresh, though its roots were chiselled in all directions 
by legions of workers, while every leaf, and every 
inch of the bark, was also crowded by parties of 
foragers. On one of the low branches we found a 
deserted nest of the white throat ( Sylvia cinerea , 
Temminck), in the cavity of which they were piled 
upon one another as close as the unhappy negroes in 
the hold of a slave ship ; but we could not discover 
what had attracted them hither. Another dense group, 
collected on one of the branches, led us to the dis- 
covery of a very singular oak gall, formed on the 
bark in the shape of a pointed cone, and crowded 







together. It is probable that the juice which they 
extracted from these galls was much to their taste*. 

Beside the jet-ant, several other species exercise 
the art of carpentry, — nay, what is more wonderful 
still, they have the ingenuity to knead up, with 
spiders’ web for a cement, the chips which they 
chisel out into a material with which they construct 
entire chambers. The species which exercise this 
singular art are the Ethiopian ( Formica nigra) and 
the yellow ant (F. Jlava) f. 

We once observed the dusky ants (F. fusca ), at 
Blackheath in Kent, busily employed in carrying out 
chips from the interior of a decaying black poplar, 
at the root of which a colony was established ; but, 
though it thence appears that this species can chisel 
wood if they choose, yet they usually burrow in the 
earth, and by preference, as we have remarked, at the 
root of a tree, the leaves of which supply them with 
food. 



Among the foreign ants, we may mention a small 
yellow ant of South America, described by Dampier, 
which seems, from his account, to construct a nest 
of green leaves. “ Their sting,” he says, “ is like 
a spark of fire ; and they are so thick among the 
boughs in some places, that one shall be covered with 
them before he is aware. These creatures have nests 
on great trees, placed on the body between the limbs: 
some of their nests are as big as a hogshead. This 
is their winter habitation ; for in the wet season they 
all repair to these their cities, where they preserve 
their eggs. In the dry season, when they leave their 
nests, they swarm all over the woodlands, for they 
never trouble the savannahs. Great paths, three or

four inches broad, made by them, may be seen in 
the woods. They go out light, but bring home 
heavy loads on their backs, all of the same sub- 
stance, and equal in size. I never observed any 
thing besides pieces of green leaves, so big that I 
could scarcely see the insect for his burden ; yet 
they would march stoutly, and so many were pressing 
forward that it was a very pretty sight, for the path 
looked perfectly green with them.” 

Ants observed in New South Wales, by the gentle- 
men in the expedition under Captain Cook, are still 
more interesting. “ Some,” we are told, “are as green 
as a leaf, and live upon trees, where they build their 
nests of various sizes, between that of a man’s head 
and his fist. These nests are of a very curious struc- 
ture : they are formed by bending down several of the 
leaves, each of which is as broad as a man’s hand, 
and glueing the points of them together, so as to 
form a purse. The viscous matter used for this pur- 
pose is an animal juice which nature has enabled 
them to elaborate. Their method of first bending 
down the leaves we had no opportunity to observe ; 
but we saw thousands uniting all their strength to 
hold them in this position, while other busy multi- 
tudes were employed within, in applying this gluten 
that was to prevent their returning back. To satisfy 
ourselves that the leaves were bent and held down 
by the efforts of these diminutive artificers, we dis- 
turbed them in their work ; and as soon as they were 
driven from their stations, the leaves on which they 
were employed sprang up with a force much greater 
than we could have thought them able to conquer by 
any combination of their strength. But, though we 
gratified our curiosity at their expense, the injury did 
not go unrevenged ; for thousands immediately threw 
themselves upon us, and gave us intolerable pain with 
their stings, especially those which took possession 







of our necks and hair, from whence they were not 
easily driven. Their sting was scarcely less painful 
than that of a bee ; but, except it was repeated, the 
pain did not last more than a minute. 

“ Another sort are quite black, and their operation, 
and manner of life are not less extraordinary. Their 
habitations are the inside of the branches of a trees 
which they contrive to excavate, by working out the 
pith almost to the extremity of the slenderest twig, 
the tree at the same time flourishing as if it had no 
such inmate. When we first found the tree, we 
gathered some of the branches ; and were scarcely 
less astonished than we should have been to find 
that we had profaned a consecrated grove, where 
every tree, upon being wounded, gave signs of life ; 
for we were instantly covered with legions of these 
animals, swarming from every broken bough, and 
inflicting their stings with incessant violence. 

“ A third kind we found nested in the root of a 
plant, which grows on the bark of trees in the manner 
of mistletoe, and which they had perforated for that 
use. This root is commonly as big as a large turnip, 
and sometimes much bigger. When we cut it, we 
found it intersected by innumerable winding pas- 
sages, all filled with these animals, by which, how- 
ever, the vegetation of the plant did not appear to 
have suffered any injury. We never cut one of these 
roots that was not inhabited, though some were not 
bigger than a hazel-nut. The animals themselves 
are very small, not more than half as big as the 
common red ant in England. They had stings, but 
scarcely force enough to make them felt: they had, 
however, a power of tormenting us in an equal, if 
not in a greater degree ; for the moment we handled 
the root, they swarmed from innumerable holes, and 
running about those parts of the body that were un- 







covered, produced a titillation more intolerable than 
pain, except it is increased to great violence*.” 

The species called sugar-ants in the West Indies 
are particularly destructive to the sugar-cane, as well 
as to lime, lemon, and orange-trees, by excavating 
their nests at the roots, and so loosening the earth 
that they are frequently uprooted and blown down 
by the winds. If this does not happen, the roots are 
deprived of due nourishment, and the plants become 
sickly and die t-

t Phil. Trans., xxx., p. 346. 





When we look back upon the details which we have 
given of the industry and ingenuity of numerous 
tribes of insects, both solitary and social, we are 
induced to think it almost impossible that they could 
be surpassed. The structures of wasps and bees, 
and still more those of the woocl-ant ( Formica rvfa), 
when placed in comparison with the size of the 
insects, equal our largest cities compared with the 
stature of man. But when we look at the build- 
ings erected by the white ants of tropical climates, 
all that we have been surveying dwindles into in- 
significance. Their industry appears greatly to sur- 
pass that of our ants and bees, and they are cer- 
tainly more skilful in architectural contrivances. The 
elevation, also, of their edifices is more than five 
hundred times the height of the builders. Were 
our houses built according to the same proportions, 
they would be twelve or fifteen times higher than 
the London Monument, and four or five times 
higher than the pyramids of Egypt, with corre- 
sponding dimensions in the basements of the edi- 
fices. These statements are, perhaps, necessary to 
impress the extraordinary labours of ants upon the 
mind ; for we are all more or less sensible to the 
force of comparisons. The analogies between the 
works of insects and of men are not perfect ; for in- 
sects are all provided with instruments, peculiarly 
adapted to the end which they instinctively seek, 
while man has to form a plan by progressive thought 







and upon the experience of others, and to complete 
it with tools which he also invents. 

The termites do not stand above a quarter of an inch 
high, while their nests are frequently twelve feet ; and 
Jobson mentions some which he had seen as high as 
twenty feet ; “ of compasse,” he adds, “ to contayne a 
dozen men, with the heat of the sun baked into that 
hardnesse, that we used to’hide ourselves in the ragged 
toppes of them when we took up stands to shoot at 
deere or wild beasts Bishop Heber saw a number 
of these high ant-hills in India, near the principal en- 
trance of the Sooty or Moorshedabad river. “ Many 
of them,” he says, “ were five or six feet high, and 
probably seven or eight feet in circumference at the 
base, partially overgrown with grass and ivy, and 
looking at a distance like the stumps of decayed trees. 
I think it is Ctesias, among the Greek writers, who 
gives an account, alluded to by Lucian, in his ‘ Cock,’ 
of monstrous ants in India, as large as foxes. The 
falsehood probably originated in the stupendous 
fabrics which they rear here, and which certainly 
might be supposed to be the work of a much larger 
animal than their real architect t-” Herodotus has 
a similar fable of the enormous size and brilliant ap- 
pearance of the ants of India, 

Nor is it only in constructing dwellings for them- 
selves that the termites of Africa and of other 
hot climates employ their masonic skill. Though, 
like our ants and wasps, they are almost omnivorous, 
yet wood, particularly when felled and dry, seems 
their favourite article of food ; but they have an utter 
aversion to feeding in the light, and always eat their 
way with all expedition into the interior. It thence 
would seem necessary for them either to leave the bark 
of a tree, or the outer portion of the beam or door

f lleber’s Journal, vol, i., p. 248. 






of a house, undevoured, or to eat in open day. 
They do neither ; but are at the trouble of construct- 
ing- g-alleries of clay, in which they can conceal 
themselves, and feed in security. In all their forag- 
ing excursions, indeed, they build covert ways, by 
which they can go out and return to their encamp- 
ment*. 

Others of the species (for there are several) in- 
stead of building galleries, exercise the art of miners, 
and make their approaches under ground, penetrating 
beneath the foundation of houses or areas, and rising 
again, either through the floors, or by entering the 
bottom of the posts that support the building, when 
they follow the course of the fibres, and make their 
way to the top, boring holes and cavities in different 
places, as they proceed. Multitudes enter the roof, 
and intersect it with pipes or galleries, formed of 
wet clay ; which serve for passages in all directions, 
and enable them more readily to fix their habitations 
in it. They prefer the softer woods, such as pine and 
fir, which they hollow out with such nicety, that they 
leave the surface whole, after having eaten away the 
inside. A shelf or plank attacked in this manner, 
looks solid to the eye, when, if weighed, it will not 
out-balance two sheets of pasteboard of the same di- 
mensions. It sometimes happens, that they carry 
this operation so far on stakes in the open air, as to 
render the bark too flexible for their purpose ; when 
they remedy the defect by plastering the whole stick 
with a sort of mortar which they make with clay ; so 
that, on being struck, the form vanishes, and the ar- 
tificial covering falls in fragments on the ground. 
In the woods, when a large tree falls from age or 
accident, they enter it on the side next the ground, 
and devour at leisure, till little more than the bark

is left. But in this case they take no precaution of 
strengthening- the outward defence, but leave it in 
such a state as to deceive an eye unaccustomed to 
see trees thus gutted of their insides ; and “ you 
may as well,” says Mr. Smeathman, “ step upon a 
cloud.” It is an extraordinary fact, that when these 
creatures have formed pipes in the roof of a house, 
instinct directs them to prevent its fall, which would 
ensue from their having sapped the posts on which 
it rests ; but, as they gnaw away the wood, they fill 
up the interstices with clay, tempered to a surprising 
degree of hardness ; so that, when the house is 
pulled down, these posts are transformed from wood 
to stone. They make the walls of their galleries of 
the same composition as their nests, varying the 
materials according to their kind : one species 

using red clay, another black clay, and a third a 
woody substance, cemented with gums, as a security 
from the attacks of their enemies, particularly the 
common ant, which, being defended by a strong, 
horny shell, is more than a match for them ; and 
when it can get at them, rapaciously seizes them, 
and drags them to its nest for food for its young 
brood. If any accident breaks down part of their 
walls, they repair the breach with all speed. Instinct 
guides them to perform their office in the creation, 
by mostly confining their attacks to trees that are 
beginning to decay, or such timber as has been se- 
vered from its root for use, and would decay in time. 
Vigorous, healthy trees do not require to be de- 
stroyed, and, accordingly, these consumers have no 
taste for them*. 

M. Adanson describes the termites of Senegal as 
constructing covert ways along the surface of wood 
which they intend to attack ; but though we have no

reason to distrust so excellent a naturalist, in de- 
scribing what he saw, it is certain that they more 
commonly eat their way into the interior of the wood, 
and afterwards form the galleries, when they find 
that they have destroyed the wood till it will no 
longer atford them protection. 

But it is time that we should come to their prin- 
cipal building, which may, with some propriety, be 
called a city ; and, according to the method we have 
followed in other instances, we shall trace their la- 
bours from the commencement. We shall begin 
with the operations of the species which may be ap- 
propriately termed the Warrior ( Termes fatalis, 
Linn.; T. Bellicosus, Sheath.). 




We must premise, that though they have been 
termed white ants , they do not belong to the same 
order of insects with our ants ; yet they have a 
slight resemblance to ants in their form, but more 
in their economy. Smeathman, to whom we owe 
our chief knowledge of the genus, describes them as 
consisting of kings, queens, soldiers, and workers, 
and is of opinion, that the workers are larvae, the 
soldiers nymphae, and the kings and queens the per- 
fect insects. In this opinion, he coincides with 
Sparrmann * and others ; but Latreille is inclined 

* Quoted by De Geer, vol. vii. 





to think, from what lie observed in a European 
species, ( Tennes lucifugus ,) found near Bordeaux, 
that the soldiers form a distinct race, like the neuter 
workers among bees and ants, while the working 
termites are larvae *, which are furnished with strong 
mandibles for gnawing ; when they become nymphs, 
the rudiments of four wings appear, which are fully 
developed in the perfect insects. In this state, they 
migrate to form new colonies, but the . greater number 
of them perish in a few hours, or become the prey of 
birds, and even the natives, who fry them as delicacies. 
“ I have discoursed with several gentlemen,” says 
Smeathman, “ upon the taste of the white ants, and on 
comparing notes, we have always agreed that they 
are most delicious and delicate eating. One gentle- 
man compared them to sugared marrow, another to 
sugared cream and a paste of sweet almonds j\” 

Mr. Smeathman’s very interesting paper affords us 
the most authentic materials for the further descrip- 
tion of these wonderful insects ; and we therefore 
continue partly to extract from, and partly to abridge, 
his account. 

The few pairs that are so fortunate as to survive 
the various casualties that assail them, are usually 
found by workers (larvae) which, at this season, are 
running continually on the surface of the ground, 
on the watch for them. As soon as they discover 
the objects of their search, they begin to protect 
them from their surrounding enemies, by enclosing 
them in a small chamber of clay, where they 
become the parents of a new community, and are 
distinguished from the other inhabitants of the nest, 
by the title of king and queen. Instinct directs 
the attention of these labouring insects to the pre- 
servation of their race, in the protection of this

f Smeatliman in Phil. Trans, vol. lxxi, p. 169, note, 





pail* and their offspring*. The chamber that forms 
the rudiment of a new nest, is contrived for their 
safety, but the entrances to it are too small to admit 
of their ever leaving* it ; consequently, the charge of 
the eggs devolves upon the labourers, who construct 
nurseries for their reception. These are small, irre- 
gularly-shape dchambers, placed at first round the 
apartment of the king and queen, and not exceeding 
the size of a hazel-nut ; but, in nests of long standing, 
they are of great comparative magnitude, and dis- 
tributed at a greater distance. The receptacles for 
hatching the young are all composed of wooden ma- 
terials, apparently joined together with gum, and, by 
way of defence, cased with clay. The chamber that 
contains the king and queen, is nearly on a level with 
the surface of the ground ; and as the other apart- 
ments are formed about it, it is generally situated at 
an equal distance from the sides of the nest, and di- 
rectly beneath its conical point. Those apartments 
which consist of nurseries and magazines of provi- 
sions, form an intricate labyrinth, being separated 
by small, empty chambers and galleries, which sur- 
round them, or afford a communication from one to 
another. This labyrinth extends on all sides to the 
outward shells, and reaches up within it to two- 
thirds or more of its height, leaving an open area 
above, in the middle, under the dome, which reminds 
the spectator of the nave of an old cathedral. 
Around this are raised three or four lanre arches, 
which are sometimes two or three feet high, next 
the front of the area, but diminish as they recede 
further back, and are lost amidst the innumerable 
chambers and nurseries behind them. 

Every one of these buildings consists of two dis- 
tinct parts, the exterior and the interior. The exterior 
is one large shell, in the manner of a dome, large and 
strong enough to inclose and shelter the interior from 





the vicissitudes of the weather, and the inhabitants 
from the attacks of natural or accidental enemies. It 
is always, therefore, much stronger than the interior 
building, which is the habitable part, divided, with a 
wonderful kind of regularity and contrivance, into an 
amazing number of apartments for the residence of 
the king and queen, and the nursing of the numerous 
progeny ; or for magazines, which are always found 
well filled with stores and provisions. The hills 
make their first appearance above ground by a little 
turret or two, in the shape of sugar-loaves, which are 
run a foot high, or more. Soon after, at some little 
distance, while the former are increasing in height 
and size, they raise others, and so go on increasing 
their number, and widening them at the base, till 
their works below are covered with these turrets, of 
which they always raise the highest and largest in 
the middle, and, by filling up the intervals between 
each turret, collect them into one dome. They are 
not very curious or exact in the workmanship, except 
in making them very solid and strong ; and when, 
by their joining them, the dome is completed, for 
which purpose the turrets answer as scaffolds, they 
take away the middle ones entirely, except the tops, 
which, joined together, make the crown of the cupola, 
and apply the clay to the building of the works 
within, or to erecting fresh turrets for the purpose of 
raising the hillock still higher ; so that some part of 
the clay is probably used several times, like the 
boards and posts of a mason’s scaffolds. 

When these hills are little more than half their 
height, it is always the practice of the wild bulls to 
stand as sentinels on them, while the rest of the herd 
are ruminating below. They are sufficiently strong 
for that purpose ; and, at their full height, answer 
excellently well as places of look out ; and Mr. 
Smeathman has been, with four more, on the top 
of one of these hillocks, to watch for a vessel in 







sight. The outward shell, or dome, is not only of use 
to protect and support the interior buildings from ex- 
ternal violence and the heavy rains, but to collect and 
preserve a regular degree of the warmth and moisture 
necessary for hatching; the eg'g;s and cherishing; the 
young. The royal chamber occupied by the king 
and queen, appears to be, in the opinion of this little 
people, of the most consequence, being always situ- 
ated as near the centre of the interior building as 
possible. It is always nearly in the shape of half an 
egg, or an obtuse oval, within, and may be supposed 
to represent a long oven. In the infant state of the 
colony, it is but about an inch in length ; but in 
time will be increased to six or eight inches, or more, 
in the clear, being always in proportion to the size of 
the queen, who, increasing in bulk as in age, at 
length requires a chamber of such dimensions. 




Queen distended with eggs. 



Its floor is yjerfectly horizontal, and, in large 
hillocks, sometimes more than an inch thick of solid 
clay. The roof also, which is one solid and well- 
turned oval arch, is generally of about the same 
solidity, but in some places it is not a quarter of an 
inch thick, on the sides where it joins the floor, and 
where the doors or entrances are made level with it, 
at nearly equal distances from each other. These 
entrances will not admit any animal larger than the 
soldiers or labourers , so that the king and the queen 







(who is, at full size, a thousand times the weight of 
a king) can never possibly go out, but remain close 
prisoners. 

The royal chamber, if in a large hillock, is sur- 
rounded by a countless number of others, of different 
sizes, shapes, and dimensions ; but all of them arched 
in one way or another — sometimes elliptical or oval. 
These either open into each other, or communicate 
by passages as wide, and are evidently made for the 
soldiers and attendants, of whom great numbers are 
necessary, and always in waiting. These apartments 
are joined by the magazines and nurseries. The former 
are chambers of clay, and are always well filled with 
provisions, which, to the naked eye, seem to consist 
of the raspings of wood, and plants which the ter- 
mites destroy ; but are found by the microscope to be 
principally the gums or inspissated juices of plants. 
These are thrown together in little masses, some of 
which are finer than others, and resemble the sugar 
about preserved fruits ; others are like tears of gum, 
one quite transparent, another like amber, a third 
brown, and a fourth quite opaque, as we see often in 
parcels of ordinary gums. These magazines are 
intermixed with the nurseries, which are buildings 
totally different from the rest of the apartments ; for 
these are composed entirely of wooden materials, 
seemingly joined together with gums. Mr. Smeath- 
man calls them the nurseries, because they are inva- 
riably occupied by the eggs and young ones, which 
appear at first in the shape of labourers, but white 
as snow. These buildings are exceedingly compact, 
and divided into many very small irregular-shaped 
chambers, not one of which is to be found of half an 
inch in width. They are placed all round, and as 
near as possible to the royal apartments. 

When the nest is in the infant state, the nurseries 
are close to the royal chambers ; but as, in process 







of time, the queen enlarges, it is necessary to enlarge 
the chamber for her accommodation ; and as she 
then lays a greater number of eggs, and requires a 
greater number of attendants, so it is necessary to 
enlarge and increase the number of the adjacent 
apartments ; for which purpose the small nurseries 
which are first built are taken to pieces, rebuilt a 
little further of a size larger, and the number of 
them increased at the same time. Thus they conti- 
nually enlarge their apartments, pull down, repair, 
or rebuild, according to their wants, with a degree of 
sagacity, regularity, and foresight, not even imitated 
by any other kind of animals or insects. 

All these chambers, and the passages leading to 
and from them, being arched, they help to support 
each other; and while the interior large arches prevent 
them from falling into the centre, and keep the area 
open, the exterior building supports them on the out- 
side. There are, comparatively speaking, few open- 
ings into the great area, and they, for the most part, 
seem intended only to admit into the nurseries that 
genial warmth which the dome collects. The interior 
building, or assemblage of nurseries, chambers, &c., 
has a flatfish top or roof, without any perforation, 
which would keep the apartments below dry, in case 
through accident the dome should receive any injury, 
and let in water ; and it is never exactly fiat and 
uniform, because the insects are always adding to it 
by building more chambers and nurseries ; so that 
the division or columns between the future arched 
apartments, resemble the pinnacles on the fronts of 
some old buildings, and demand particular notice, as 
affording one proof that for the most part the in- 
sects project their arches, and do not make them by 
excavation. The area has also a flatfish floor, which 
lies over the royal chamber, but sometimes a good 
height above it, having nurseries and magazines 







between. It is likewise waterproof, and contrived to 
let the water off if it should get in, and run over by 
some short way into the subterraneous passages, 
which run under the lowest apartments in the hill in 
various directions, and are of an astonishing size, 
being wider than the bore of a great cannon. One 
that Mr. Smeathman measured was perfectly cylin- 
drical, and thirteen inches in diameter. These sub- 
terraneous passages, or galleries, are lined very thick 
with the same kind of clay of which the hill is com- 
posed, and ascend the inside of the outward shell in 
a spiral manner ; and winding round the whole 
building up to the top, intersect each other at dif- 
ferent heights, opening either immediately in the 
dome in various places, and into the interior build- 
ing, the new turrets, &c., or communicating with 
them by other galleries of different diameters, either 
circular or oval. 

From every part of these large galleries are va- 
rious small covert ways, or galleries leading to differ- 
ent parts of the building. Under ground there are 
a great many that lead downward by sloping de- 
scents, three and four feet perpendicular among the 
gravel, whence the workers cull the finer parts, 
which, being kneaded up in their mouths to the con- 
sistence of mortar, becomes that solid clay or stone 
of which their hills and all their buildings, except 
their nurseries, are composed. Other galleries 
again ascend, and lead out horizontally on every 
side, and are carried under ground near to the sur- 
face a vast distance : for if all the nests are destroyed 
within a hundred yards of a house, the inhabitants 
of those which are left unmolested farther off, will 
still carry on their subterraneous galleries, and, in- 
vading it by sap and mine, do great mischief to the 
goods and merchandizes contained in it. 

It seems there is a degree of necessity for the gal- 







leries miclev the hills being thus large, since they are 
the great thoroughfares for all the labourers and sol- 
diers going forth or returning, whether fetching clay, 
wood, water, or provisions ; and they are certainly 
well calculated for the purposes to which they are 
applied by the spiral slope which is given them ; 
for if they were perpendicular, the labourers would 
not be able to carry on their building with so much 
facility, as they ascend a perpendicular with great 
difficulty, and the soldiers can scarcely do it at all. 
It is on this account that sometimes a road like a 
ledge is made on the perpendicular side of any part 
of the building within their hill, which is flat on the 
upper surface, and half an inch wide, and ascends 
gradually like a staircase, or like those winding roads 
which are cut on the sides of hills and mountains, 
that would otherwise be inaccessible ; by which and 
similar contrivances they travel with great facility to 
every interior part. 

This, too, is probably the cause of their building a 
kind of bridge of one great arch, which answers the 
purpose of a flight of stairs from the floor of the area 
to some opening on the side of one of the columns 
that support the great arches. This contrivance 
must shorten the distance exceedingly to those la- 
bourers who have the eggs to carry from the royal 
chamber to some of the upper nurseries, which in 
some hills would be four or five feet in the straight- 
est line, and much more if carried through all the 
winding passages leading through the inner cham- 
bers and apartments. Mr. Smeathman found one 
of these bridges, half an inch broad, a quarter of an 
inch thick, and ten inches long, making the side of an 
elliptic arch of proportionable size ; so that it is won- 
derful it did not fall over or break by its own weight 
before they got it joined to the side of the column 
above.

It was strengthened by a small arch at the bottom 
and had a hollow or Groove all the length of th< 
upper surface, either made purposely for the inha- 









bitants to travel over with more safety, or else, which 
is not improbable, worn by frequent treading. 

Turret-Building White Ants. 

Apparently more than one species, smaller than 
the preceding, such as the Termes mordax and T. 
atrox of Smeathman, construct nests of a very dif- 
ferent form, the figures of which resemble a pillar, 
with a large mushroom for a capital. These turrets 
are composed of well-tempered black earth, and 
stand nearly three feet high. The conical mush- 
room-shaped roof is composed of the same material, 
and the brims hanc; over the column, beino; three or 
four inches wider than its perpendicular sides. Most 
of them, says Smeathman, resemble in shape the 
body of a round windmill, but some of the roofs 
have little elevation in the middle. When one of 
these turrets is completed, the insects do not after- 
wards enlarge or alter it ; but if it be found too small

the upper part lying on the ground. 







for them, they lay the foundation of another at a few 
inches distance. They sometimes, but not often, begin 
the second before the first is finished, and a third 
before they have completed the second. Five or six 
of these singular turrets in a group may be seen in 
the thick woods at the foot of a tree. They are so 
very strongly built, that in case of violence, they will 
sooner tear up the gravel and solid heart of their 
foundation than break in the middle. When any of 
them happen to be thus thrown down, the insects 
do not abandon them ; but, using their overturned 
column as a basis, they run up another perpendicu- 
larly from it, to the usual height, fastening the under 
part at the same time to the ground, to render it the 
more secure. 

The interior of a turret is pretty equally divided 
into innumerable cells, irregular in shape, but usually 
more or less angular, generally quadrangular or 
pentagonal, though the angles are not well defined. 
Each shell has at least two entrances ; but there are 
no galleries, arches, nor wooden nurseries, as in the 
nests of the Warrior ( T. bellicosus). The two species 
which build turret nests are very different in size, 
and the dimensions of the nests differ in proportion. 

The White Ants of Trees. 

Latreille’s species of white ant ( Termes luc.ifugus , 
Rossi), formerly mentioned as found in the south of 
Europe, appear to have more the habits of the jet 
ant, described page 279, than their congeners of the 
tropics. They live in the interior of the trunks of 
trees, the wood of which they eat, and form their 
habitations of the galleries which they thus excavate. 
M. Latreille says they appear to be furnished with an 
acid for the purpose of softening the wood, the odour 
of which is exceedingly pungent. They prefer the 






part of the wood nearest to the bark, which they are 
careful not to injure, as it affords them protection. 
All the walls of their galleries are moistened with 
small globules of a gelatinous substance, similar to 
gum Arabic. They are chiefly to be found in the 
trunks of oak and pine trees, and are very numerous*. 

Another of the species ( Termes arborum), described 
by Smeathman, builds a nest on the exterior of trees, 
altogether different from any of the preceding. These 
are of a spherical or oval shape, occupying the arm 
or branch of a tree sometimes from seventy to eighty 
feet from the ground, and as large, in a few instances, 
as a sugar-cask. The composition used for a build- 
ing material is apparently similar to that used by the 
warriors for constructing their nurseries, being the 
gnawings of wood in very small particles, kneaded 
into a paste with some species of cement or glue, 
procured, as Smeathman supposes, partly from gum- 
miferous trees, and partly from themselves ; but it is 
more probable, we think, that it is wholly secreted, 
like the wax of bees, by the insects themselves. 
With this cement, whatever may be its composition, 
they construct their cells, in which there is nothing- 
very wonderful except their great numbers. They 
are very firmly built, and so strongly attached to the 
trees, that they will resist the most violent tornado. 
It is impossible, indeed, to detach them, except by 
cutting them in pieces, or sawing off the branch*, 
which is frequently done to procure the insects for 
young turkeys. (See engraving, p. 300, for a figure 
of this nest.) 

This species very often, instead of selecting the 
bough of a tree, builds in the roof or wall of a house, 
and unless observed in time and expelled, occasions 
considerable damage. It is easier, in fact, to shut 

* Latreille, Hist. Nat. Generale, tom. xiii. p. 64. 





one’s door against a fox or a thief, than to exclude 
such insidious enemies, whose aversion to light ren- 
ders it difficult to trace them even when they are 
numerous. 

If we reflect on the prodigious numbers of those 
insects, and their power and rapidity of destroying, 
we cannot but admire the wisdom of Providence in 
creating so indefatigable and useful an agent in 
countries where the decay of vegetable substances is 
rapid in proportion to the heat of the climate. We 
have already remarked that they always prefer de- 
caying or dead timber ; and it is indeed a very gene- 
ral law among insects which feed on wood to prefer 
what is unsound : the same principle holds with re- 
spect to fungi, lichens, and other parasitical plants. 

All the species of Termites are not social ; but the 
solitary ones do not, like their congeners, distinguish 
themselves in architecture. In other respects, their 
habits are more similar; for they destroy almost every 
substance, animal and vegetable. The most common 
of the solitary species must be familiar to all our 
readers by the name of wood-louse ( Tenues pulsa- 
torivm , Linn.; Atropos lignarius , Leach) — one of 
the insects which produces the ticking, supersti- 
tiously termed the death-watch. It is not so large as 
the common louse, but whiter and more slender, 
having a red mouth and yellow eyes. It lives in old 
books, the paper on walls, collections of insects and 
dried plants, and is extremely agile in its movements, 
darting, by jerks, into dark corners for the purpose 
of concealment. It does not like to run straight for- 
ward, without resting every half-second, as if to listen 
or look about for its pursuer, and at such resting 
times it is easily taken. The ticking noise is made 
by the insect beating against the wood with its head, 
and it is supposed by some to be peculiar to the fe- 
male, and to be connected with tlic laying of her eggs. 







M. Latreille, however, thinks that the wood-louse 
is only the grub of the Psocus abdominalis, in which 
case it could not lay eg’gs ; but this opinion is some- 
what questionable. Another death-watch is a small 
beetle ( Anobium tesselatum). 









“ Millions of spinning worms. 

That in their green shops weave the smooth-hair’d silk.” 

Milton’s Cumus. 



All the caterpillars of butterflies, moths, and, in 
general, of insects with four wings, are capable of 
spinning silk, of various degrees of fineness and 
strength, and differing in colour, but usually white, 
yellow, brown, black, or grey. This is not only of 
advantage in constructing nests for themselves, and 
particularly for their pupae, as we have so frequently 
exemplified in the preceding pages, but it enables 
them, the instant they are excluded from the egg, to 
protect themselves from innumerable accidents, as 
well as from enemies. If a caterpillar, for instance, 
be exposed to a gust of wind, and blown off from its 
native tree, it lets itself gently down, and breaks its 
fall, by immediately spinning a cable of silk, along 
which, also, it can reascend to its former station 
when the danger is over. In the same way, it fre- 
quently disappoints a bird that has marked it out for 
prey, by dropping hurriedly down from a branch, 
suspended to its never-failing delicate cord. The leaf- 
rollers, formerly described, have the advantage of 
other caterpillars in such cases, by being able to 
move as quickly backwards as forwards ; so that 
when a bird puts in its bill at one end of the roll, the 
insect makes a ready exit at the other, and drops 
along its thread as low as it judges convenient. We 







have seen caterpillars drop in this way from one to 
six feet or more ; and by means of their cable, which 
they are careful not to break, they climb back with 
great expedition to their former place. 

The structure of their leg's is well adapted for 
climbing up their singular rope — the six lore-legs 
being furnished with a curved claw ; while the pro- 
legs (as they have been termed) are no less fitted 
for holding them firm to the branch when they have 
regained it, being constructed on the principle of 
forming a vacuum, like the leather sucker with 
which boys lift and drag stones. The foot of the 
common fly has a similar sucker, by which it is 
enabled to w r alk on glass, and otherwise support it- 
self against gravity. The different forms of the leg 
and pro-leg of a spinning caterpillar are represented 
in the figure. 




Leg and Pro-leg of a Caterpillar, greatly magnified. 



In order to understand the nature of the appa- 
ratus by which a caterpillar spins its silk, it is to be 
recollected that its whole interior structure differs 
from that of warm-blooded animals. It has, pro- 
perly speaking, no heart, though a long tubular 
dorsal vessel , which runs along the back, and pul- 
sates from twenty to one hundred times per minute. 



 



has been called so by Malphigi and others: but 
neither Lyonnet nor Cuvier could detect any vessel 
issuing from it ; and consequently the fluid which is 
analogous to blood has no circulation. It differs also 
from the higher orders of animals in having no 
brain, the nerves running along the body being only 
united by little knobs, called ganglions. Another 
circumstance is, that it has no lungs, and does not 
breathe by the mouth, but by air-holes, or spiracles, 
eighteen in number, situated along the sides, in the 
middle of the rings, as may be seen in the following 
figure from Lyonnet : 




Caterpillar of the Goat-Moth ( Cossus ligniperda.) 



These spiracles communicate on each side with 
tubes, that have been called the wind-pipes (trachea). 
The spinning apparatus is placed near the mouth, 
and is connected with the silk-bags, which are long, 
slender, floating vessels, containing a liquid gum. 
The bags are closed at their lower extremity, become 
wider towards the middle, and more slender towards 
the head, where they unite to form the spinning-tube, 
or spinneret. The bags being in most cases longer 
than the body of the caterpillar, necessarily lie in a 
convoluted state, like the intestines of quadrupeds. 
The capacity, or rather the length, of the silk-bags, 
is in proportion to the quantity of silk required for 
spinning ; the Cossus ligniperda , for example, from 
living in the wood of trees, spins little, having a bag 
only one-fourth the length of that of the silk-worm, 
though the caterpillar is at least twice the dimensions 
of the latter. The following figure, taken from the 







admirable treatise of Lyonnet on the anatomy of the 
Cossus, will render these several organs more easily 
understood than any description. 

The spinneret itself was supposed by Reaumur to 
have two outlets for the silk ; but Lyonnet, upon 
minute dissection, found that the two tubes united 
into one before their termination ; and he also almost 
assured himself that it was composed of alternate 
slips of horny and membranaceous substance, — the 
one for pressing the thread into a small diameter, and 
the other for enlarging it at the insect’s pleasure. It 
is cut at the end somewhat like a writing-pen, though 
with less of a slope, and is admirably fitted for being 
applied to objects to which it may be required to 
attach silk. The following are magnified figures of 
the spinneret of the Cossus from Lyonnet.

“ You may sometimes have seen,” says the x\bbe 
de la Pluche, “ in the work-rooms of goldsmiths or 
gold wire-drawers, certain iron plates, pierced with 
holes of different calibres, through which they draw 
gold and silver wire, in order to render it finer. The 
silk-worm has under her mouth such a kind of instru- 
ment, perforated with a pair of holes [united into one 
on the outside *], through which she draws two drops 
of the gum that fills her two bags. These instruments

are like a pair of distaffs for spinning the gum into a 
silken thread. She fixes the first drop of gum that 
issues where she pleases, and then draws back her 
head, or lets herself fall, while the gum continuing 
to flow, is drawn out and lengthened into a double 
stream. Upon being exposed to the air, it imme- 
diately loses its fluidity, becomes dry, and accjuires 
consistence and strength. She is never deceived in 
adjusting the dimensions of the [united] apertures, 
or in calculating the proper thickness of the thread, 
but invariably makes the strength of it proportion- 
able to the weight of her body. 

“ It would be a very curious thing to know how 
the gum which composes the silk is separated and 
drawn off from the other juices that nourish the 
animal. It must be accomplished like the secre- 
tions formed by glands in the human body. I am 
therefore persuaded that the gum-bags of the silk- 
worm are furnished with a set of minute glands, 
which, being impregnated with gum, afford a free 
passage to all the juices of the mulberry-leaf corres- 







ponding with this glutinous matter, while they ex- 
clude every fluid of a different quality*.” When 
confined in an open glass vessel, the goat-moth cater- 
pillar will effect its escape, by constructing a curious 
silken ladder, as represented by Roesel. 

Caterpillars, as they increase in size, cast their 
skins as lobsters do their shells, and emerge into re- 
newed activity under an enlarged covering. Previous 
to this change, when the skin begins to gird and 
pinch them, they maybe observed to become languid, 
and indifferent to their food,. and at length they cease 
to eat, and await the sloughing of their skin. It is 
now that the faculty of spinning silk seems to be of 
great advantage to them ; for being rendered inac- 
tive and helpless by the. tightening of the old skin 
around their expanding body, they might be swept 
away by the first puff of wind, and made prey of by 
ground beetles or other carnivorous prowlers. To 
guard against such accidents, as soon as they feel 
that they can swallow no more food from being half 
choked by the old skin, they take care to secure 
themselves from danger by moorings of silk spun 
upon the leaf or the branch where they may be re- 
posing. The caterpillar of the white satin-moth 
( Leucoma salicis , Stephens) in this way draws to- 
gether with silk one or two leaves, similar to the leaf- 
rollers ( Tortricidce ), though it always feeds openly 
without any covering. The caterpillar of the puss- 
moth again, which, in its third skin, is large and 
heavy, spins a thick web on the upper surface 
of a leaf, to which it adheres till the change is 
effected. 

The most important operation, how r ever, of silk- 
spinning is performed before the caterpillar is trans- 
formed into a chrysalis, and is most remarkable in 
the caterpillars of moths and other four-winged flies, 
* Spectacle tie la Nature, vol. i. 





with the exception of those of butterflies ; for though 
these exhibit, perhaps, greater ingenuity, they seldom 
spin more than a few threads to secure the chrysalis 
from falling, whereas the others spin for it a com- 
plete envelope or shroud. We have already seen, in 
the preceding pages, several striking instances of this, 
operation, when probably for the purpose of husband- 
ing a scanty supply of silk, extraneous substances are 
worked into the texture. In the case of other cater- 
pillars, silk is the only material employed. Of this 
the cocoon of the silk-worm is the most prominent 
example, in consequence of its importance . in our 
manufactures and commerce, and on that account 
will demand from us somewhat minute details, though 
it would require volumes to incorporate all the in- 
formation which has been published on the subject. 

• - Silk-Worm. 

The silk-worm, like most other caterpillars, changes 
its skin four times during its growth. The intervals 
at which the four moultings follow each other depend 
much on climate or temperature, as well as on the 
quality and quantity of food. It is thence found, 
that if they are exposed to a high temperature, say 
from Sl° to 100° Fahrenheit, the moultings will be 
hastened ; and only five days will be consumed in 
moulting the third or fourth time, whilst those worms 
that have not been hastened take seven or eight 
days*. 

The period of the moultings is also influenced by 
the temperature in which the eggs have been kept 
during the winter. When the heat of the apartment 
has been regulated, the first moulting takes place on 
the fourth or fifth day after hatching, the second 
begins on the eighth day, the third takes up the 
thirteenth and fourteenth days, and the last occurs 

* Cours d’ Agriculture, par M. Rozier. Paris, 1801. 







on the twenty-second and twenty-third days. The 
fifth age, in such cases, lasts ten days, at the end of 
which, or thirty-two days after hatching, the cater- 
pillars attain their full growth, and ought to be three 
inches in length; but if they have not been properly 
fed, they will not be so long. 

With the age of the caterpillar, its appetite in- 
creases, and is at its maximum after the fourth moult- 
ing, when it also attains its greatest size. The silk 
gum is then elaborated in the reservoirs, while the 
caterpillar ceases to eat, and soon diminishes again 
in size and weight. This usually requires a period 
of nine or ten days, commencing from the fourth 
moulting, after which it begins to spin its shroud of 
silk. In this operation it proceeds with the greatest 
caution, looking carefully for a spot in which it may 
be most secure from interruption. 

“ We usually,” says the Abbe de la Pluche, “ give 
it some little stalks of broom, heath, or a piece of 
paper rolled up, into which it retires, and begins to 
move its head to different places, in order to fasten 
its thread on every side. All this work, though it 
looks to a bystander like confusion, is not without 
design. The caterpillar neither arranges its threads 
nor disposes one over another, but contents itself 
with distending a sort of cotton or floss to keep off 
the rain ; for Nature having ordained silk-worms to 
work under trees, they never change their method, 
even when they are reared in our houses. 

“ When my curiosity led me to know how they 
spun and placed their beautiful silk, I took one of 
them, and frequently removed the floss with which it 
first attempted to make itself a covering; and as by 
this means I weakened it exceedingly, when it at last 
became tired of beginning anew, it fastened its threads 
on the first thing it encountered, and began to spin 
very regularly in my presence, bending its head up 







and down, and crossing- to every side. It soon con- 
fined its movements to a very contracted space, and, by 
degrees, entirely surrounded itself with silk ; and the 
remainder of its operations became invisible, though 
these may be understood from examining the work 
after it is finished. In order to complete the struc- 
ture, it must draw out of the gum-bag a more deli- 
cate silk, and then with a stronger gum bind all the 
inner threads over one another. 

“ Here, then, are three coverings entirely differ- 
ent, which afford a succession of shelter. The outer 
loose silk, or floss, is for keeping off the rain ; the 
fine silk in the middle prevents the wind from causing 
injury ; and the glued silk, which composes the 
tapestry of the chamber where the insect lodges, re- 
pels both air and water, and prevents the intrusion 
of cold. 

“ After building her cocoon, she divests herself of 
her fourth skin, and is transformed into a chrysalis, 
and subsequently into a moth ( Bombyoc mori), when, 
without saw or centre-bit, she makes her way through 
the shell, the silk, and the floss ; for the Being who 
teaches her how to build herself a place of rest, where 
the delicate limbs of the moth may be formed without 
interruption, instructs her likewise how to open a 
passage for escape. 

“ The cocoon is like a pigeon’s egg, and more 
pointed at one end than the other ; and it is remark- 
able that the caterpillar does not interweave its silk 
towards the pointed end, nor apply its glue there as 
it does in every other part*, by bending itself all 
around with great pliantness and agility : what is 
more, she never fails, when her labour is finished, to 
fix her head opposite to the pointed extremity. The 
reason of her taking this position is, that she has 



* This is denied by recent observers. 

 



purposely left this part less strongly cemented, and 
less exactly closed. She is instinctively conscious 
that this is to be the passage for the perfect insect 
which she carries in her bowels, and has therefore 
the additional precaution never to place this pointed 
extremity against any substance that might obstruct 
the moth at the period of its egress. 

“ When the caterpillar has exhausted herself to 
furnish the labour and materials of the three cover- 
ings, she loses the form of a worm, her spoils drop 
all around the chrysalis ; first throwing off her 
skin, with the head and jaws attached to it, and the 
new skin hardening into a sort of leathery consist- 
ence. Its nourishment is already in its stomach, and 
consists of a yellowish mucus, but gradually the rudi- 
ments of the moth unfold themselves, — the wings, 
the antennee, and the legs becoming solid. In about 
a fortnight or three weeks, a slight swelling in the 
chrysalis may be remarked, which at length produces 
a rupture in the membrane that covers it, and by 
repeated efforts the moth bursts through the leathery 
envelope into the chamber of the cocoon. 

“ The moth then extends her antennae, together 
with her head and feet, towards the point of the cone, 
which not being thickly closed up in that part gra- 
dually yields to her efforts ; she enlarges the opening, 
and at last comes forth, leaving at the bottom of the 
cone the ruins of its former state — namely, the head 
and entire skin of the caterpillar, which bear some 
resemblance to a heap of foul linen * ” 

Reaumur was of opinion that the moth makes use 
of its eyes as a file, in order to effect its passage 
through the silk; while Malpighi, Peck, and others, 
believe that it is assisted by an acid which it dis- 
charges in order to dissolve the gum that holds the

fibres of the silk together (see p. 195). Mr. Swayne 
denies that the threads are broken at all, either by 
filing or solution ; for he succeeded in unwinding a 
whole cocoon from which the moth had escaped. The 
soiling of the cocoon by a fluid, however, we may 
remark, is no proof of the acid ; for all moths and 
butterflies discharge a fluid when they assume wings, 
whether they be inclosed in a cocoon or not ; but 
it gives no little plausibility to the opinion, that “ the 
end of the cocoon is observed to be wetted for an 
hour, and sometimes several hours, before the moth 
makes its way out Other insects employ different 
contrivances for escape, as we have already seen, and 
shall still further exemplify. 

It is the middle portion of the cocoon, after re- 
moving the floss or loose silk on the exterior, which 
is used in our manufactures ; and the first prepara- 
tion is to throw the cocoons into warm water, and 
stir them about with twigs, to dissolve any slight 
gummy adhesions which may have occurred when 
the caterpillar was spinning. The threads of several 
cones, according to the strength of the silk wanted, 
are then taken and wound off upon a reel. The 
refuse, consisting of what we may call the tops and 
bottoms of the cones, are not wound, but carded, 
like wool or cotton, in order to form coarser fabrics. 
We learn from the fact of the cocoons being gene- 
rally unwound without breaking the thread, that the 
insect spins the whole without interruption. It is 
popularly supposed, however, that if it be disturbed 
during the operation by any sort of noise, it will 
take alarm, and break its thread ; but Latreille says 
this is a vulgar error f.

The length of the unbroken thread in a cocoon 
varies from six hundred to a thousand feet ; and as 
it is all spun double by the insect, it will amount to 
nearly two thousand feet of silk, the whole of which 
does not weigh above three grains and a half: five 
pounds of silk from ten thousand cocoons is consi- 
derably above the usual average. When we consider, 
therefore, the enormous quantity of silk which is 
used at present, the number of worms employed in 
producing it will almost exceed our comprehension. 
The manufacture of the silk, indeed, gives employ- 
ment, and furnishes subsistence, to several millions 
of human beings ; and we may venture to say, that 
there is scarcely an individual in the civilized world 
who has not some article made of silk in his pos- 
session. 

In ancient times, the manufacture of silk was 
confined to the East Indies and China, where the 
insects that produce it are indigenous. It was 
thence brought to Europe in small quantities, and in 
early times sold at so extravagant a price, that it was 
deemed too expensive even for royalty. The Emperor 
Aurelian assigned the expense as a reason for re- 
fusing his empress a robe of silk ; and our own 
James I., before his accession to the crown of Eng- 
land, had to borrow of the Earl of Mar a pair of 
silk stockings to appear in before the English am- 
bassador, — a circumstance which probably led him to 
promote the cultivation of silk in England*. The Ro- 
man authors were altogether ignorant of its origin, — 
some supposing it to be grown on trees, as hair 
grows on animals, — others that it was produced by a 
shell-fish similar to the mussel, which is known to 
throw out threads for the purpose of attaching itself 
to rocks, — others that it was the entrails of a sort of 



* Shaw’s Gen. Zoology, vol. vi. 







spider, which was fed for four years with paste, and 
then with the leaves of the green-willow, till it burst 
with fat, — and others that it was the produce of a 
worm which built nests of clay and collected wax. 
The insect was at leng'th spread into Persia; and 
eggs were afterwards, at the instance of the Emperor 
J ustinian, concealed in hollow canes by two monks , 
and conveyed to the isle of Cos. This emperor, in 
the sixth century, caused them to be introduced into 
Constantinople, and made an object of public utility. 
They were thence successively cultivated in Greece, in 
Arabia, in Spain, in Italy, in France, and in all places 
where any hope could be indulged of their succeed- 
ing. In America, the culture of the silk-worm was 
introduced into Virginia in the time of James I., who 
himself composed a book of instructions on the sub- 
ject, and caused mulberry-trees and silk-worm’s egg 
to be sent to the colony. In Georgia, also, lands 
were granted on condition of planting one hundred 
white mulberry-trees on every ten acres of cleared 
land *. 

The growth of the silk-worm has also been tried, 
but with no great success, in this country. Evelyn 
computed that one mulberry-tree would feed as many 
silk-worms annually as would produce seven pounds 
of silk. “ According to that estimate,” says Barham t, 
“ the two thousand trees already planted in Chelsea 
Park (which take up one-third of it) will make 
14,0001bs. weight of silk; to be commonly worth but 
twenty shillings a pound, those trees must make 
<£1.4,000 per annum.” During the last century, some 
French refugees in the south of Ireland made con- 
siderable plantations of the mulberry, and had begun

f Essay on the .Silk-Worm, p. 95. London, 1719. 






the cultivation of silk with every appearance of 
success ; but since their removal the trees have been 
cut down*. In the vicinity of London, also, a 
considerable plantation of mulberry-trees were pur- 
chased by the British, Irish, and Colonial Silk 
Company in 1825 ; but we have not learned whether 
this Company have any active measures now in 
operation. 

The manufacture of silk was introduced into this 
country in 1718, at Derby, by Mr. John Lombe, who 
travelled into Italy to obtain the requisite informa- 
tion ; but so jealous were the Italians of this, that 
according to some statements which have obtained 
belief, he fell a victim to their revenge, having been 
poisoned at the early age of twenty-nine t- 

There are not only several varieties of the common 
silk-worm ( Bombyx mori ), but other species of ca- 
terpillars, which spin silk capable of being manufac- 
tured, though not of so good qualities as the common 
silk. None of our European insects, however, seem 
to be well fitted for this purpose, though it has been 
proposed by Fabricius and others to try the crimson 
under-wing ( Catocala sponsa, Schrank), &c. M. 
Latreille quotes from the ‘ Recreations of Natural 
History,’ by Wilhelm, the statement that the cocoons 
of the emperor-moth ( Saturnia pcmonia) had been 
successfully tried in Germany, by M. Wentzel Hegeer 
de Berchtoldsdorf, under an imperial patent. 

Emperor-Moth. 

The emperor-moth, indeed, is no less w r orthy of 
our attention with respect to the ingenuity of its ar- 
chitecture, than the beauty of its colours, and has

-{¦ Glover’s Directory of the County of Derby, introd. p. xvi. 







consequently attracted the attention of every Ento- 
mologist. The caterpillar feeds on fruit-trees and 
on the willow, and spins a cocoon, in form of a Flo- 
rence flask, of strong silk, so thickly woven, that it 
appears almost like damask or leather. It differs 
from most other cocoons in not being closed at the 
upper or smaller end, which terminates in a narrow 
circular aperture, formed by the convergence of little 
bundles of silk, gummed together, and almost as 
elastic as whalebone. In consequence of all these 
terminating in needle-shaped points, the entrance of 
depredators is guarded against, upon the prin- 
ciple which prevents the escape of a mouse from a 
wire trap. The insect, however, not contented with 
this protection, constructs another in form of a 
canopy or dome, within the external aperture, so as 
effectually to shield the chrysalis from danger. We 
have formerly remarked (page 192) that the cater- 
pillar of the JEgeria asiliformis of Stephens, in a si- 
milar way did not appear to be contented with a co- 
vering of thin wood, without an additional bonnet of 
brown wax. The cocoon of the emperor-moth, though

thus in some measure impenetrable from without, is 
readily opened from within ; and when the moth 
issues from its pupa case, it easily makes its way 
out without either the acid or eye-files ascribed to the 
silk-worm. The elastic silk gives way upon being- 
pushed from within, and when the insect is fairly 
out, it shuts again of its own accord, like a door 
with spring hinges, — a circumstance which at first 
puzzled Roesel not a little when he saw a fine large 
moth in his box, and the cocoon apparently in the 
same state as when he had put it there. Another 
naturalist conjectures that the converging threads are 
intended to compress the body of the moth as it 
emerges, in order to force the fluids into the nervures 
of the wings ; for when he took the chrysalis pre- 
viously out of the cocoon, the wings of the moth never 
expanded properly*. Had he been much conversant 
with breeding insects, he would rather, we think, 
have imputed this to some injury which the chrysalis 
had received. We have witnessed the shrivelling of 
the wings which he alludes to, in many instances, and 
not unfrequently in butterflies which spin no cocoon. 
The shrivelling, indeed, frequently arises from the 
want of a sufficient supply of food to the caterpillar 
in its last stage, occasioning a deficiency in the fluids. 

The elasticity of the cocoon is not peculiar to the 
emperor-moth. A much smaller insect, the green 
cream-border-moth ( Tortrix clilorcina ) before men- 
tioned (page 170), for its ingenuity in bundling up 
the expanding leaves of the willow, also spins an 
elastic shroud for its chrysalis, of the singular shape 
of a boat with the keel uppermost. Like the cater- 
pillar of Pyrcilis strigulalis (page 19S), whose build- 
ing, though of different materials, is exactly of the 
same form, — it first spins two approximating walls 



* Meinecken, quoted by Kirby and Spence, in. 2S0. 







of whitish silk, of the form required, and when 
these are completed, it draws them forcibly together 
with elastic threads, so placed as to retain them 
closely shut. The passage of the moth out of this 
cocoon might have struck Roesel as still more mar- 
vellous than that of his emperor, in which there was 
at least a small opening ; while in the boat cocoon 
there is none. We have now before us two of these, 
which we watched the caterpillars through the pro- 
cess of building, in the summer of 1828, and from 
one only a moth issued, — the other, as often happens, 
having died in the chrysalis. But what is most re- 
markable, it is impossible by the naked eye to tell 
which of these two has been opened by the moth, so 
neatly has the joining been finished*. 

Some species of moths spin a very slight silken 
tissue for their cocoons, being apparently intended 
more to retain them from falling, than to afford pro- 
tection from other accidents. The gipsey-moth 
( Hypogymna dispar ), rare in most parts of Britain, 
is one of these. It selects for its retreat a crack in 
the bark of the tree upon which it feeds, and over 
this spins only a few straggling threads. We found 
last summer (1829), in the hole of an elm-tree in the 
Parc at Brussels, a group of half a dozen of these, 
that did not seem to have spun any covering at all, 
but trusted to a curtain of moss ( Hypna ) which 
margined the entrancef. In a species nearly allied to 
this, the yellow-tussock ( Dasychira pudibunda , Ste- 
phens), the cocoon, one of which we have now before 
us, is of a pretty close texture, and interwoven with 
the long hairs of the caterpillar itself (see the right 
hand top figure, page 20), which it plucks out piece- 
meal during the process of building, — as is also done

by the vapourer ( Orgyia antiqua, IIubner), and 
many others. 

These are additional instances of the remarks we 
formerly made, that caterpillars which spin a slight 
web are transformed into perfect insects in a much 
shorter period than those which spin more substantial 
ones. Thus the cream-spot tyger ( Arctia villica, 
Stephens) lies in chrysalis only three weeks, and 
therefore does not require a strong web. It is figured 
below, along with another, which is still slighter, 
though more ingeniously woven, being regularly 
meshed like net-work. 



Cocoon of Arctia villica. 





Net work cocoon. 



A very prettily-netted cocoon is constructed by the 
grub of a very small grey weevil ( Hypera Rumicis ), 
which is not uncommon in July, on the seed spikes 
of docks (Rumices). This cocoon is globular, and 
not larger than a garden pea, though it appears to 







be very large in proportion to the pupa of the insect, 
reminding us not a little of the carved ivory balls 
from China. The meshes of the net- work are also 
large, but the materials , are strong and of a waxy 
consistence. Upon remarking that no netting was 
ever spun over the part of the plant to which the 
cocoon was attached, we endeavoured to make them 
spin cocoons perfectly globular, by detaching them 
when nearly finished ; but though we tried four or 
five in this way, we could not make them add a sin- 
gle mesh after removal, all of them making their 
escape through the opening, and refusing to re-enter 
in order to complete their structure*. 

The silk, if it may be so termed, spun by many 
species of larvae is of a still stronger texture than the 
waxy silk of the little weevil just mentioned. We 
recently met with a remarkable instance of this at 
Lee, in the cocoons of one of the larger ich- 
neumons ( Ophion Vinulce? Stephens), inclosed 
in that of a puss-moth ( Cerura Vinula ) — itself re- 
markable for being composed of sand as well as wood, 
the fibres of which had been scooped out of the under- 
ground cross-bar of an old paling, to which it was 
attached. But the most singular portion of this was 
the junction of the outer wall with the edges of the 
hollow thus scooped out, which was formed of fibres 
of wood placed across the fibres of the bar nearly at 
right angles, and strongly cemented together, as if 
to form a secure foundation for the building. 

In this nest were formed, surreptitiously introduced 
into the original building, five empty cells of a black 
colour, about an inch long, and a sixth of an inch in 
diameter ; nearly cylindrical in form, but somewhat 
flattened; vertical and parallel to one another, though 
slightly curved on the inner side. The cells are com-

posed of strong and somewhat coarse fibres, more 
like the carbonized rootlets of a tree than silk, and 
resembling in texture a piece of coarse milled cloth 
or felt, such as is used for the bases of plated hats. 
It is worthy of remark, that all these cells opened

towards one end, as if the caterpillars which con- 
structed them had been aware that the wall of the 
puss-moth, in which the flies would have to make a 
breach, was very hard, and would require their 
united elforts to effect an escape. The importance 
of such a precaution will appear more strikingly, 
when we compare it with the instance formerly men- 
tioned (page 195), in which only one ichneumon 
had been able to force its way out*. 

It appears indispensable to some grubs to be con- 
fined within a certain space, in order to construct 
their cocoons. We saw this well exemplified in the 
instance of a grub of one of the mason-bees (Osmia 
bicornis ), which we took from its nest, and put into 



* J. R. 







a box, with the pollen paste which the mother bee 
had provided for its subsistence. (See pages 40, 41.) 
When it had completed its growth, it began to spin, 
but in a very awkward manner — attaching threads, 
as if at random, to the bits of pollen which re- 
mained undevoured, and afterwards tumbling about 
to another part of the box, as if dissatisfied with 
what it had done. It sometimes persevered to spin 
in one place till it had formed a little vaulted wall ; 
but it abandoned at the least three or four of these 
in order to begin others, till at length, as if com- 
pelled by the extreme urgency of the stimulus of its 
approaching change, it completed a shell of shining 
brown silk, woven into a close texture. Had the 
grub remained within the narrow clay cell built for it 
by the mother bee, it would, in all probability, not 
have thus exhausted itself in vain efforts at building, 
which were likely to prevent it from ever arriving at 
the perfect state — a circumstance which often happens 
in the artificial breeding of insects*. 

Beside silk, the cocoons of many insects are 
composed of other animal secretions, intended to 
strengthen or otherwise perfect their texture. We 
have already seen that some caterpillars pluck off 
their own hair to interweave amongst their silk : 
there are others which produce a peculiar substance 
for the same purpose. The lackey caterpillar ( Clisio - 
campa neustria , Curtis) in this manner lines its 
cocoon with pellets of a downy substance, resem- 
bling little tufts of the flowers of sulphur. The 
small egger, again ( Eriogaster lanestris, Germar), 
can scarcely be said to employ silk at all, — the 
cocoon being of a uniform texture, looking, at 
first sight, like dingy Paris plaster, or the shell 
of a pheasant’s egg, but upon being broken, and 



* J. R. 











inspected narrowly, a few threads of silk may be 
seen interspersed through the whole. In size, it is 
not larger than the egg of the gold-crested wren. It 
has been considered by Brahm a puzzling circum- 
stance, that this cocoon is usually perforated with 
one or two little holes, as if made by a pin from 
without; and Kirby and Spence tell us that their 
use has not been ascertained*. May they not be left as 
air-holes for the included chrysalis, as the close texture 
of the cocoon might, without this provision, prove 
fatal to the animal? Yet, on comparing one of these 
with a similar cocoon of the large egger-moth ( La - 
siocampa Quercus ), we find no air-holes in the latter, 
as we might have been led to expect from the 
closeness of its texture. We found a cocoon of a 
saw-fly ( Tricliiosoma ), about the same size as that 
of the egger, attached to a hawthorn twig, in a 
hedge at New Cross, Deptford, but of a leathery 
texture, and, externally, exactly the colour of the 
bark of the tree. This was also without air-holes. 
The egger, we may remark, unlike the dock-weevil 
or the bee-grub just mentioned, can work her co- 
coon without any point of attachment. We had a 
colony of these caterpillars in the summer of 1825, 
brought from Epping Forest, and saw several of 
them work their cocoons, and we could not but ad- 
mire the dexterity with which they avoided filling up 
the little pin holes. The supply of their building 
material was evidently measured out to them in the 
exact quantity required; for when we broke down a 
portion of their wall, by way of experiment, they did 
not make it above half the thickness of the previous 
portion, though they plainly preferred having a thin 
wall to leaving the breach unclosed f. 

Several species of caterpillars that spin only silk,

are social, like some of those we formerly mentioned, 
which unite to form a common tent of leaves (see 
pages 172, 3). The most common instance of this, is 
in the caterpillars which feed on the nettle — the small 
tortoise-shell ( Vanessa urticce ), and the peacock’s eye 
(V.1'6.) Colonies of these may be seen, after Mid- 
summer, on almost every clump of nettles, inhabiting 
a thin web of an irregular oval shape, from which 
they issue out to feed on the leaves, always returning 
when their appetite is satisfied, to assist their com- 
panions in extending their premises. Other ex- 
amples, still more conspicuous from being seen on 
fruit-trees and in hedges, occur in the caterpillars of 
the small ermine-moth ( Yponomeuta padella), and 
of the lackey ( Clisiocampa neustria ), which in some 
years are but too abundant, though in others they 
are seldom met with. In the summer of 1826, 
every hedge and fruit-tree around London swarmed 
with colonies of the ermine, though it has not since 
been plentiful ; and in the same way, during the 
summer of 1829, the lackeys were to be seen every 
where. We mention this irregularity of appearance, 
that our readers may not disappoint themselves by 
looking for what is not always to be found. It is 
probable, that in 1830, the lackeys will be few, for, 
notwithstanding the myriads of caterpillars last 
summer, we saw only a single moth of this species, 
and out of a number of chrysalides which a young 
friend had in his nurse-boxes, not one moth was bred. 

The caterpillars of other moths, which are in some 
years very common — such as the brown-tail (Por- 
thesia auriflua ,) and the golden-tail (P. Chry- 
sorrhcea,) are also social; and, as the eggs are 
hatched late in the summer, the brood passes the 
winter in a very closely woven nest of warm silk. 
This is usually represented as composed of leaves 
which have had their pulpy parts eaten as food 

2 f 3 







by the colonists; but from minute observation of 
at least twenty of these nests in the winter of 
1828-9, we are quite satisfied that leaves are only 
an accidental, and not a necessary part of the struc- 
ture. When a leaf happens to be in the line of the 
walls of the nest, it is included ; but there is no appa- 
rent design in pressing it into the service, nor is a 
branch selected because it is leafy. On the con- 
trary, by far the greater number of these nests do not 
contain a single leaf, but are composed entirely of 
grey silk. In external form, no two of these nests 
are alike ; as it depends entirely upon the form of 
the branch. When, therefore, there is only one twig, 
it is somewhat egg-shaped ; but when there are 
several twigs, it commonly joins each, assuming an 
angular shape, as may be seen in the figure.

(Porthesia auriflua), figured from specimen. 







This irregularity arises from the circumstance of 
each individual acting on its own account, without 
the direction or superintendence of the others. The 
interior of the structure is, for the same reason, 
more regular, being divided into compartments, each 
of which forms a chamber for one or more indi- 
viduals. Previous to the cold weather, these cham- 
bers have but slight partitions ; but before the frosts 
set in the whole is made thick and warm. 




/Pinter nests of Porthesia chrysorrhcca, one being cut open to show 
the chambers. The dots represent the egesta of the caterpillars. 

A no less remarkable winter nest, of a small spe- 
cies of social caterpillar, is described by M. Bonnet, 
which we omitted to introduce when treating of the 
Glanville fritillary (page 172). The nest in question 
is literally pendulous, being hung from the branch of 
a fruit-tree by a strong silken thread. It consists of 
one or two leaves neatly folded, and held together 






with silk, in which the caterpillars live harmoniously 
together. 




Pendulous leaf-nests, from Bonnet. 



In a recently published volume of * Travels in 
Mexico,’ we find a very remarkable account of some 
pendulous nests of caterpillars, which appear to be 
almost as curious as the nests of the card-maker 
wasps, described at p. 88. The author of these 
travels does not define the species of caterpillar, 
whose constructions excited his observation. He 
says, “ After having ascended for about an hour, we 
came to the region of oaks and other majestically 
tall trees, the names of which I could not learn. 
Suspended from their stately branches, were innu- 
merable nests, enclosed, apparently, in white paper 
bags, in the manner of bunches of grapes in Eng- 
land, to preserve them from birds and flies. I had 
the curiosity to examine one of them, which I found 
to contain numberless caterpillars. The texture is 
so strong that it is not easily torn ; and the interior 
contained a quantity of green leaves, to support the 
numerous progeny within*.” 



* Hardy’s Travels in the Interior of Mexico, p. 32. 







In all the nests of social caterpillars, care is 
taken to leave apertures for passing out and in. 
It is remarkable, also, that however far they may 
ramble from their nest, they never fail to find 
their way back, when a shower of rain or night- 
fall renders shelter necessary. It requires no great 
shrewdness to discover how they effect this ; for 
by looking closely at their track it will be found 
that it is carpeted with silk — no individual moving 
an inch without constructing such a pathway, both 
for the use of his companions and to facilitate his 
own return. All these social caterpillars, therefore, 
move more or less in processional order, each follow- 
ing the road which the first chance traveller has 
marked out with his strip of silk carpeting. 

There, are some species, however, which are more 
remarkable than others in the regularity of their pro- 
cessional marchings, particularly two which are found 
in the South of Europe, but are not indigenous in 
Britain. The one named by Reaumur the proces- 
sionary ( Cnethocampa processioned, Stephens) feeds 
upon the oak ; a brood dividing, when newly hatched, 
into one or more parties of several hundred indivi- 
duals, which afterwards unite in constructing a com- 
mon nest nearly two feet long, and from four to six 
inches in diameter. As it is not divided like that 
of the brown-tails into chambers, but consists of one 
large hall, it is not necessary that there should be 
more openings than one ; and accordingly when an 
individual goes out and carpets a path, the whole 
colony instinctively follow in the same track, though 
from the immense population they are often com- 
pelled to march in parallel files from two to six deep. 
The procession is always headed by a single cater- 
pillar ; sometimes the leader is immediately followed 
by one or two in single file, and sometimes by two 
abreast, as represented in the cut. A similar pro- 







cedure is followed by a species of social caterpillars, 
which feed on the pine in Savoy and Languedoc ; 
and though their nests are not half the size of the 
preceding, they are more worthy of notice, from the 
strong and excellent quality of their silk, which 
Reaumur was of opinion might be advantageously 
manufactured. Their nests consist of more cham- 
bers than one, but are furnished with a m ain entrance, 
through which the colonists conduct their foraging 
processions.

Modern naturalists do not rank spiders among in- 
sects, because they have no antennae, and no division 
between the head and the shoulders ; they breathe 
by leaf-shaped gills, situated under the belly, instead 
of spiracles in the sides ; have a heart connected 
with these; have eight legs instead of six ; and 
eight fixed eyes. But as spiders are popularly con- 
sidered insects, it will sufficiently suit our purpose 
to introduce them here as such. 

The apparatus by which spiders construct their 
ingenious fabrics is much more complicated than 
that which we have described, as common to the 
various species of caterpillars. Caterpillars have 
only two reservoirs for the materials of their silk ; 
but spiders, according to the dissections of M. Trevi- 
ranus, have four principal vessels, two larger and 
two smaller, with a number of minute ones at their 
base. Several small tubes branch towards the reser- 
voirs, for carrying to them, no doubt, a supply of 
the secreted material. Swammerdam describes them 
as twisted into many coils of an agate colour*. We 
do not find them coiled but nearly straight, and of a 
deep yellow colour. From these when broken, threads 
can be drawn out like those spun by the spider. 

From these little flasks or bags of gum, situated 
near the anus, and not at the mouth as in cater- 
pillars, a tube originates and terminates in the exter-

nal spinnerets, which may be seen by the naked eye 
in the larger spiders, in the form of five little teats 
surrounded by a circle, as represented in the figure 
below. 




Garden Spider (Epeira diadema), suspended by a thread proceeding 

from its spinneret. 

We have seen that the silken thread of a cater- 
pillar is composed of two united within the tube of 
the spinneret, but the spider’s thread would appear 
from the first view of its five spinnerets, to be quin- 
tuple, and in some species which have six teats, 
so many times more. It is not safe, however, in our 
interpretations of nature to proceed upon conjecture 
however plausible, nor to take anything for granted 
which we have not actually seen; since our inferences 
in such cases are almost certain to be erroneous. 






If Aristotle, for example, had ever looked narrowly 
at a spider when spinning, he could not have fancied, 
as he does, that the materials which it uses are 
nothing but wool stripped from its body. On look- 
ing then, with a strong magnifying glass, at the teat- 
shaped spinnerets of a spider, we perceive them 
studded with regular rows of minute bristle-like 
points, about a thousand to each teat, making in all 
from five to six thousand. These are minute tubes 
which we may appropriately term spinnerules, as 
each is connected with the internal reservoirs, and 
emits a thread of inconceivable fineness. In the 
figure below, this wonderful apparatus is represented 
as it appears in the microscope. 



Spinnerets of a Spider magnified to show the Spinnerules. 




We do not recollect that naturalists have ventured 
to assign any cause for this very remarkable multi- 
plicity of the spinnerules of spiders, so different from 
the simple spinneret of caterpillars. To us it ap- 
pears to be an admirable provision for their mode of 
life. Caterpillars neither require such strong ma- 
> terials, nor that their thread should dry as quickly. 





It is well known in our manufactures, particularly in 
rope-spinning’, that in cords of equal thickness, those 
which are composed of many smaller ones united 
are greatly stronger than those which are spun at 
once. In the instance of the spider’s thread, this 
principle must hold still more strikingly, inasmuch 
as it is composed of fluid materials that require to 
be dried rapidly, and this drying must be greatly 
facilitated by exposing so many to the air separately 
before their union, which is effected at the distance 
of about a tenth of an inch from the spinnerets. In 
the following figure, each of the threads represented 
is reckoned to contain one hundred minute threads, 
the whole forming only one of the spider’s common 
threads. 




Leeuwenhoeck, in one of his extraordinary micro- 
scopical observations on a young spider not bigger 
than a grain of sand, upon enumerating the thread- 







lets in one of its threads, calculated that it would 
require four millions of them to be as thick as a hair 
of his beard. 

Another important advantage derived by the spider 
from the multiplicity of its threadlets is, that the thread 
affords a much more secure attachment to a wall, a 
branch of a tree, or any other object, than if it were 
simple ; for, upon pressing the spinneret against the 
object, as spiders always do when they fix a thread, 
the spinnerules are extended over an area of some 
diameter, from every hair’s breadth of which a strand, 
as rope-makers term it, is extended to compound the 
main cord. The following figure exhibits this inge- 
nious contrivance. 



Those who may be curious to examine this contri- 
vance will see it best when the line is attached to 
any black object; for the threads being white are, in 
other cases, not so easily perceived.

difficult investigation, to determine in what manner

spiders, seeing 1 that they are destitute of wings, 
transport themselves from tree to tree, across brooks, 
and frequently through the air itself, without any ap- 
parent starting point. On looking into the authors 
who have treated upon this subject, it is surprising 
how little there is to be met with that is new, even in 
the most recent. Their conclusions, or rather their 
conjectural opinions, are, however, worthy of notice ; 
for, by unlearning error, we the more firmly esta- 
blish truth. 

1. One of the earliest notions upon this subject 
is that of Blancanus, the commentator on Aristotle, 
which is partly adopted by Redi, by Henricus 
Regius of Utrecht, by Swammerdam*, by Leh- 
mann the mineralogist, and by Kirby and Spencef. 
“ The spider’s thread,” says Swammerdam, “ is 
generally made up of two or more parts, and 
after descending by such a thread, it ascends by 
one only, and is thus enabled to waft itself from 
one height or tree to another, even across running 
waters; the thread it leaves loose behind it being 
driven about by the wind, and so fixed to some 
other body.” “ I placed,” says Kirby, “ the large 
garden spider ( Epeira diadema ) upon a stick 
about a foot long, set upright in a vessel containing 

water It let itself drop, not by a single thread, 

but by two, each distant from the other about the 
twelfth of an inch, guided, as usual, by one of its hind 
feet, and one apparently smaller than the other. 
When it had suffered itself to descend nearly to the 
surface of the water, it stopped short, and by some 
means, which I could not distinctly see, broke off, 
close to the spinners, the smallest thread, which still 
adhering by the other end to the top of the stick, 



* Swammerdam, part i. p. 2-1. 
+ Intr. i. vol. p. 415. 







floated in the air, and was so light as to be carried 
about by the slightest breath. On approaching a 
pencil to the loose end of this line, it did not adhere 
from mere contact. I, therefore, twisted it once or 
twice round the pencil, and then drew it tight. The 
spider, which had previously climbed to the top of 
the stick, immediately pulled at it with one of its feet, 
and finding it sufficiently tense, crept along it, 
strengthening it as it proceeded by another thread, 
and thus reached the pencil.” 

We have repeatedly witnessed this occurrence, 
both in the fields, and when spiders were placed for 
experiment, as Kirby has described ; but we very 
much doubt that the thread broken is ever intended 
as a bridge cable, or that it would have been so used 
in that instance, had it not been artificially fixed and 
accidentally found again by the spider. According 
to our observations, a spider never abandons, for an 
instant, the thread which she despatches in quest of 
an attachment, but uniformly keeps trying it with 
her feet, in order to ascertain its success. We are, 
therefore, persuaded, that when a thread is broken in 
the manner above described, it is because it has been 
spun too weak, and spiders may often be seen break- 
ing such threads in the process of netting their webs*'. 

The plan, besides, as explained by these agreeable 
writers, would more frequently prove abortive than 
successful, from the cut thread not being suf- 
ficiently long. They admit, indeed, that spiders’ 
lines are often found “ a yard or two long, fastened 

to twigs of grass not a foot in height Here, 

therefore, some other process must have been 
used +.”

whose treatise upon our native spiders has been the

basis of every subsequent work on the subject, main- 
tains, that “ some spiders shoot out their threads in 
the same manner that porcupines do their quills ; 
that whereas the quills of the latter are entirely se- 
parated from their bodies, when thus shot out, the 
threads of the former remain fixed to their anus, as 
the sun’s rays to its body A French periodical 
writer goes a little farther, and says, that spiders 
have the power of shooting out threads, and directing 
them at pleasure, towards a determined point, 
judging of the distance and position of the object 
by some sense of which we are ignorant f. Kirby 
also says, that he once observed a small garden 
spider ( Aranea reticulata), “standing midway on a 
long perpendicular fixed thread, and an appearance 
caught” his “ eye, of what seemed to be the emission 
of threads.” “I,” therefore, he adds, “moved my 
arm in the direction in which they apparently pro- 
ceeded, and, as I had suspected, a floating thread 
attached itself to my coat, along which the spider 
crept. As this was connected with the spinners of 
the spider, it could not have been formed” by 
breaking a “secondary thread.”]; Again, in speaking 
of the gossamer-spider, he says, it “ first extends its 
thigh, shank, and foot, into a right line, and then, 
elevating its abdomen till it becomes vertical, shoots 
its thread into the air, and flies oft' from its station§.” 
Another distinguished naturalist, Mr. White of 
Selborne, in speaking of the gossamer-spider, says, 
“ every day in fine weather in autumn do I see 
these spiders shooting out their webs, and mounting 
aloft : they will go off from the finger, if you will 
take them into your hand. Last summer, one 
alighted on my book as I was reading in the par- 

* Lister, Hist. Animalia Angliae, 4to. p. 7. 
f Phil. Mag. ii. p. 275.

lour; and running to the top of the page, and 
shooting out a web , took its departure from thence. 
But what I most wondered at was, that it went off 
with considerable velocity in a place where no air 
was stirring ; and I am sure that I did not assist it 
with my breath 

Having so often witnessed the thread set afloat 
in the air by spiders, we can readily conceive the 
way in which those eminent naturalists were led 
to suppose it to be ejected by some animal force 
acting like a syringe ; but as the statement can be 
completely disproved by experiment, we shall only at 
present ask, in the words of Swammerdam — “ how it 
can be possible that a thread so fine and slender 
should be shot out with force enough to divide and 
pass through the air ? — is it not rather probable that 
the air would stop its progress, and so entangle it 
and fit it to perplex the spider’s operations ?’*t The 
opinion, indeed, is equally improbable with another, 
suggested by Dr. Lister, that the spider can retract 
her thread within the abdomen, after it has been 
emitted De Geer§ very justly joins Swammer- 
dam in rejecting both of these fancies, which, in our 
own earlier observations upon spiders, certainly 
struck us as plausible and true. There can be no 
doubt, indeed, that the animal has a voluntary power 
of permitting the material to escape, or stopping it 
at pleasure, but this power is not projectile. 

3. “ There are many people/’ says the Abbe de la 
Pluche, “who believe that the spider flies when they see 
her pass from branch to branch, and even from one 
high tree to another ; but she transports herself in this 
manner : she places herself upon the end of a branch,

or some projecting body, and there fastens her thread ; 
after which, with her two hind feet, she squeezes her 
dugs ( spinnerets ), and presses out one or more, 
threads of two or three ells in length, which she 
leaves to float in the air till it be fixed to some par- 
ticular place*.” Without pretending to have ob- 
served this, Swammerdam says, “ lean easily compre- 
hend how spiders, without giving themselves any 
motion, may, by only compressing their anus, spin 
out a thread, which being driven by the wind, may 
serve to waft them from one place to another f.” 
Others, proceeding upon a similar notion, give a 
rather different account of the matter. “ The spider,” 
says Bingley, “ fixes one end of a thread to the place 
where she stands, and then with her hind paws 
draws out several other threads from the nipples, 
which, being lengthened out and driven by the wind 
to some neighbouring tree or other object, are by 
their natural clamminess fixed to itj.” 

Observation gives some plausibility to the latter 
opinion, as the spider always actively uses her legs, 
though not to draw out the thread, but to ascertain 
whether it has caught upon any object. The notion 
of her pressing the spinneret with her feet must be a 
mere fancy ; at least it is not countenanced by any 
thing which we have observed. 

4. An opinion much more recondite is mentioned, if 
it was not started by M. D’lsjonval, that the floating 
of the spider’s thread is electrical. “ Frogs, cats, 
and other animals,” he says, “ are affected by natural 
electricity, and feel the change of weather; but no 
other animal more than myself and my spiders.” 
During wet and windy weather he accordingly found 
that they spun very short lines, “ but when a spider

;J; Animal Biography, vol. iii. p. 475, 3rd edition. 






spins a long’ thread, there is a certainty of fine weather 
for at least ten or twelve days afterwards*.” A 
periodical writer, who signs himself Carolan t, 
fancies that in darting out her thread the spider 
emits a stream of air, or some subtile electric fluid, 
by which she guides it as if by magic. 

A living writer (Mr. John Murray), whose learn- 
ing and skill in conducting experiments give no 
little weight to his opinions, has carried these views 
considerably farther. “ The aeronautic spider,” he 
says, “ can propel its threads both horizontally 
and vertically, and at all relative angles, in mo- 
tionless air, and in an atmosphere agitated by 
winds ; nay more, the aerial traveller can even dart 
its thread, to use a nautical phrase, in the ‘ wind’s 
eye.’ My opinion and observations are based on 
many hundred experiments The entire phe- 

nomena are electrical. When a thread is propelled 
in the vertical plane, it remains perpendicular to the 
horizontal plane, always upright, and when others 
are projected at angles more or less inclined, their 
direction is invariably preserved ; the threads never 
intermingle, and when a pencil of threads is propelled, 
it ever presents the appearance of a divergent brush. 
These are electrical phenomena, and cannot be ex- 
plained but on electrical principles.” 

“ In clear, fine weather, the air is invariably 
positive ; and it is precisely in such weather that the 
aeronautic spider makes its ascent most easily and 
rapidly, whether it be in summer or in winter.” 
“ When the air is weakly positive, the ascent of the 
spider will be difficult, and its altitude extremely 
limited, and the threads propelled will be but little 
elevated above the horizontal plane. When negative 
electricity prevails, as in cloudy weather, or on the

f Thomson’s Ann. of Philosophy, vol. iii, p. 306. 







approach of rain, and the index of De Saussure’s 
hygrometer rapidly advancing towards humidity, the 
spider is unable to ascend*.” 

Mr. Murray had previously told us, that “ when 
a stick of excited sealing-wax is brought near the 
thread of suspension, it is evidently repelled ; con- 
sequently, the electricity of the thread is of a nega- 
tive character,” while “ an excited glass tube brought 
near, seemed to attract the thread, and with it, 
the aeronautic spider t.” His friend, Mr. Bowman, 
further describes the aerial spider as “ shooting out 
four or five, often six or eight, extremely fine webs 
several yards long, which waved in the breeze, 
diverging from each other like a pencil of rays.” 
One of them “ had two distinct and widely diverging 
fasciculi of webs,” and “ a line uniting them would 
have been at right angles to the direction of the 
breeze J.” 

Such is the chief evidence in support of the elec- 
trical theory; but though we have tried these ex- 
periments, we have not succeeded in verifying any 
one of them. The following statements of Mr. 
Blackwall come nearer our own observations. 

5. “ Having procured a small branched twig,” says 
Mr. Blackwall, “ I fixed it upright in an earthen 
vessel containing water, its base being immersed in 
the liquid, and upon it I placed several of the spiders 
which produce gossamer. Whenever the insects 
thus circumstanced were exposed to a current of air, 
either naturally or artificially produced, they directly 
turned the thorax towards the quarter whence it 
came, even when it was so slight as scarcely to be 
perceptible, and elevating the abdomen, they emitted 
from their spinners a small portion of glutinous

matter, which was instantly carried out in a line, 
consisting of four finer ones, with a velocity equal, 
or nearly so, to that with which the air moved, as 
was apparent from observations made on the motion 
of detached lines similarly exposed. The spiders, 
in the next place, carefully ascertained whether their 
lines had become firmly attached to any object or 
not, by pulling at them with the first pair of legs ; 
and if the result was satisfactory, after tightening 
them sufficiently, they made them pass to the twig ; 
then discharging from their spinners, which they 
applied to the spot where they stood, a little more of 
their liquid gum, and committing themselves to these 
bridges of their own constructing, they passed over 
them in safety, drawing a second line after them, as 
a security in case the first gave way, and so effected 
their escape. 

“ Such was invariably the result when spiders 
were placed where the air was liable to be sensibly 
agitated : I resolved, therefore, to put a bell glass 
over them ; and in this situation they remained 
seventeen days, evidently unable to produce a single 
line by which they could quit the branch they occupied, 
without encountering the water at its base ; though, 
on the removal of the glass, they regained their 
liberty with as much celerity as in the instances 
already recorded. 

“ This experiment, which, from want of due pre- 
caution has misled so many distinguished naturalists, 
I have tried with several geometric spiders, and 
always with the same success*.” 

Mr. Blackwall, from subsequent experiments, says 
he is “ confident in affirming, that in motionless air, 
spiders have not the power of darting their threads 
even through the space of half an inchf.” The fol-

lowing details are given in confirmation of this 
opinion. Mr. Blackwall observed, the 1st Oct., 18:26, 
a little before noon, with the sun shining brightly, 
no wind stirring, and the thermometer in the shade 
ranging from 55 °.5 to 64°, a profusion of shining 
lines crossing each other at every angle, forming a con- 
fused net-work, covering the fields and hedges, and 
thickly coating his feet and ankles, as he walked across 
a pasture. He was more struck with the phenomenon, 
because on the previous day a strong gale of wind had 
blown from the south, and as gossamer is only seen 
in calm weather, it must have been all produced 
within a very short time. 

“ What more particularly arrested my attention,’ , 
says Mr. Blackwall, “ was the ascent of an amazing 
quantity of webs, of an irregular, complicated struc- 
ture, resembling ravelled silk of the finest quality, 
and clearest white ; they were of various shapes and 
dimensions, some of the largest measuring upwards 
of a yard in length, and several inches in breadth in 
the widest part ; while others were almost as broad 
as long, presenting an area of a few square inches 
only. 

“ These webs, it was quickly perceived, were not 
formed in the air, as is generally believed, but at the 
earth’s surface. The lines of which they were com- 
posed, being brought into contact by the mechanical 
action of gentle airs, adhered together, till, by con- 
tinual additions, thev were accumulated into flakes or 
masses of considerable magnitude, on which the 
ascending current, occasioned by the rarefaction of 
the air contiguous to the heated ground, acted with 
so much force as to separate them from the objects 
to which they were attached, raising them in the 
atmosphere to a perpendicular height of at least 
several hundred feet. I collected a number of these 
webs about mid-day, as they rose ; and again in the 






afternoon, when the upward current had ceased, and 
they were falling’: but scarcely one in twenty con- 
tained a spider ; though, on minute inspection, I 
found small winged insects, chiefly aphides, entangled 
in most of them. 

“ From contemplating this unusual display of 
gossamer, my thoughts were naturally directed to 
the animals which produced it, and the countless 
myriads in which they swarmed almost created as 
much surprise as the singular occupation that en- 
grossed them. Apparently actuated by the same 
impulse, all were intent upon traversing the regions 
of air ; accordingly, after gaining the summits of 
various objects, as blades of grass, stubble, rails, 
gates, &c., by the slow and laborious process of 
climbing, they raised themselves still higher by 
straightening their limbs ; and elevating the abdo- 
men, by bringing it from the usual horizontal posi- 
tion, into one almost perpendicular, they emitted from 
their spinning apparatus a small quantity of the 
glutinous secretion with which they construct their 
webs. This viscous substance being drawn out by 
the ascending current of rarefied air into fine lines 
several feet in length, was carried upward, until the 
spiders, feeling themselves acted upon with sufficient 
force in that direction, quitted their hold of the 
objects on which they stood, and commenced their 
journey by mounting aloft. 

“ YVhenever the lines became inadequate to the 
purpose for which they were intended, by adhering 
to any fixed body, they were immediately detached 
from the spinners and so converted into terrestrial 
gossamer, by means of the last pair of legs, and the 
proceedings just described were repeated ; which 
plainly proves that these operations result from a 
strong desire felt by the insects to effect ail ascent*.” 
* Linn, Trans., vol. xv. p. 453. 





6. Without going into the particulars of what 
agrees or disagrees in the above experiments with our 
own observations, we shall give a brief account of 
what we have actually seen in our researches *. So 
far as we have determined, then, all the various 
species of spiders, how different soever the form of 
their webs may be, proceed in the circumstance of 
shooting their lines precisely alike ; but those which 
we have found the most manageable in experiment- 
ing, are the small gossamer spider (Aranea obtectrix, 
Bechstein), known by its shining blackish-brown 
body and reddish-brown semi-transparent legs ; but 
particularly the long-bodied spider ( Tetragnatha 
extensa, Latr.), which varies in colour from green 
to brownish or grey — but has always a black line 
along the belly, with a silvery white or yellowish one 
on each side. The latter is chiefly recommended by 
being a very industrious and persevering spinner, 
while its movements are easily seen, from the long 
cylindrical form of its body and the length of its 
legs. 

We placed the above two species with five or six 
others, including the garden, the domestic, and the 
labyrinthic spiders, in empty wine-glasses, set in tea- 
saucers filled with water to prevent their escape. 
When they discovered, by repeated descents from 
the brims of the glasses, that they were thus sur- 
rounded by a wet ditch, they all set themselves to the 
task of throwing their silken bridges across. For 
this purpose they first endeavoured to ascertain in 
what direction the wind blew, or rather (as the ex- 
periment was made in our study) which way any 
current of air set, — by elevating their arms as we 
have seen sailors do in a dead calm. But, as it may 
prove more interesting to keep to one individual, we 



* J.R. 







shall first watch the proceedings of the gossamer 
spider. 

Finding no current of air on any quarter of the brim 
of the glass, it seemed to give up all hopes of con- 
structing its bridge of escape, and placed itself in the 
attitude of repose ; but no sooner did we produce a 
stream of air, by blowing gently towards its position, 
than, fixing a thread to the glass, and laying hold 
of it with one of its feet, by way of security, it placed 
its body in a vertical position, with its spinnerets ex- 
tended outwards ; and immediately we had the pleasure 
of seeing a thread streaming out from them several 
feet in length, on which the little aeronaut sprung up 
into the air. We were convinced, from what we thus 
observed, that it was the double or bend of the thread 
which was blown into the air ; and we assigned as a 
reason for her previously attaching and drawing out 
a thread from the glass, the wish to give the wind 
a point d'appui — something upon which it might 
have a purchase , as a mechanic would say of a lever. 
The bend of the thread, then, on this view of the 
matter, would be carried out by the wind, — would 
form the point of impulsion, — and, of course, the 
escape bridge would be an ordinary line doubled. 

Such was our conclusion, which was strongly 
corroborated by what we subsequently found said 
by M. Latreille — than whom no higher authority 
could be given. “ When the animal,” says he, 
“ desires to cross a brook, she fixes to a tree or 
some other object, one of the ends of her first threads, 
in order that the wind or a current of air may carry 
the other end beyond the obstacle * and as one end 
is always attached to the spinnerets, he must mean 
that the double of the thread flies off.

ou un courant d’air pousse l’autre extremite de Tun d’eux au

In order to ascertain the fact, and put an end to all 
doubts, vve watched, with great care and minute- 
ness, the proceedings of the long-bodied spider above 
mentioned, by producing a stream of air in the 
same manner, as it perambulated the brim of the 
glass. It immediately, as the other had done, at- 
tached a thread and raised its body perpendicularly, 
like a tumbler standing on his hands with his head 
downwards ; but we looked in vain for this thread 
bending, as we had at first supposed, and going oft* 
double. Instead of this it remained tight, while an- 
other thread, or what appeared to be so, streamed off* 
from the spinners, sometimes in a line, and sometimes 
at a considerable angle, with the first, according to 
the current of the air, — the first thread, extended from 
the glass to the spinnerets, remaining all the while 
tight drawn in a right line. It further appeared to 
us, that the first thread proceeded from the pair of 
spinnerets nearest the head, while the floating thread 
came from the outer pair, — though it is possible in 
such minute objects we may have been deceived. That 
the first was continuous with the second, without 
any perceptible joining, we ascertained in numerous 
instances, by catching the floating line and pulling it 
tight, in which case the spider glides along without 
attaching another line to the glass; but if she have to 
coil up the floating line to tighten it, as usually hap- 
pens, she gathers it into a packet and glues the two 
ends tight together. Her body, while the floating 
line streamed out, remained quite motionless, but we 
distinctly saw the spinnerets not only projected, as is 
always done when a spider spins, but moved in the 
same way as on infant moves it lips when sucking. 
We cannot doubt, therefore, that this motion is 
intended to emit (if eject or project be deemed too 
strong words) the liquid material of the thread ; at 
the same time, we are quite certain that it cannot 







throw out a single inch of thread without the aid of 
a current of air. A long-bodied spider will thus 
throw out in succession as many threads as we please, 
by simply blowing towards it ; but not one where 
there is no current, as under a bell-glass, where it 
may be kept till it die, without being able to construct 
a bridge over water of an inch long. We never 
observed more than one floating thread produced at 
the same time ; though other observers mention 
several. 

The probable commencement, we think, of the 
floating line, is by the emission of little globules of 
the glutinous material to the points of the spinnerules 
— perhaps it may be dropped from them, if not 
ejected, and the globules being carried off by the 
current of air, drawn out into a thread. But we give 
this as only a conjecture, for we could not bring a 
glass of sufficient power to bear upon the spinnerules 
at the commencement of the floating line. 

In subsequent experiments we found, that it was 
not indispensable for the spider to rest upon a solid 
body when producing a line, as she can do so while 
she is suspended in the air by another line. When 
the current of air also is strong, she will sometimes 
commit herself to it by swinging from the end of the 
line. We have even remarked this when there was 
scarcely a breath of air. 

We tried another experiment. We pressed pretty 
firmly upon the base of the spinnerets, so as not to 
injure the spider, blowing obliquely over them ; but 
no floating line appeared. We then touched them 
with a pencil and drew out several lines an inch or 
two in length, upon which we blew in order to extend 
them, but in this also we were unsuccessful, as they 
did not lengthen more than a quarter of an inch. 
We next traced out the reservoirs of a garden- 
spider ( Epeira diadtma ), and immediately taking a 





drop of the matter from one of them on the point of 
a fine needle, we directed upon it a strong current of 
air, and succeeded in blowing out a thick yellow line 
as we might have done with gum-water, of about an 
inch and a half long. 

When we observed our long-bodied spider eager 
to throw a line by raising up its body, we brought 
within three inches of its spinnerets an excited stick 
of sealing-wax, of which it took no notice, nor did 
any thread extend to it, not even when brought almost 
to touch the spinnerets. We had the same want of 
success with an excited glass rod; and indeed we had 
not anticipated any other result, as we have never 
observed that these either attract or repel the floating 
threads, as Mr. Murray has seen them do ; nor have 
we ever seen the end of a floating thread separated 
into its component threadlets and diverging like a 
brush, as he and Mr. Bowman describe. 

Nests, Webs, and Nets of Spiders. 

The neatest, though the smallest spider’s nest which 
we have seen, was constructed in the chink of a gar- 
den post, which we had cut out the previous summer 
in getting at the cells of a carpenter-bee. The archi- 
tect was one of the larger hunting- spiders erroneously 
said by some naturalists to be incapable of spinning. 
The nest in question was about two inches high, 
composed of a very close satin-like texture. There 
were two parallel chambers placed perpendicularly, 
in which position also the inhabitant reposed there 
during the day, going, as we presume, only abroad 
to prey during the night. But the most remark- 
able circumstance was, that the openings (two 
above and two below) were so elastic, that they shut 
almost as closely as the boat cocoon of the Tortrix 
chlorana (see page 322). We observed this spider 
for several months, but at last it disappeared, and w 







took the nest out, under the notion that it might con- 
tain eggs ; but we found none, and therefore conclude 
that it was only used as a day retreat *. The account 
which Evelyn has given of these hunting-spiders is 
so interesting, that we must transcribe it. 

“ Of all sorts of insects,” says he, “ there is none 
has afforded me more divertisement than the vena- 
tores (hunters), which are a sort of lupi (wolves) that 
have their dens in rugged walls and crevices of our 
houses ; a small brown and delicately-spotted kind 
of spiders, whose hinder legs are longer than the 
rest. Such I did frequently observe at Rome, which, 
espying a fly at three or four yards distance, upon 
the balcony where I stood, would not make directly 
to her, but crawl under the rail, till being arrived to 
the antipodes, it would steal up, seldom missing its 
aim ; but if it chanced to want anything of being 
perfectly opposite, would, at first peep, immediately 
slide down again, — till, taking better notice, it would 
come the next time exactly upon the fly’s back : but 
if this happened not to be within a competent leap, 
then would this insect move so softly, as the very 
shadow of the gnomon seemed not to be more im- 
perceptible, unless the fly moved ; and then would 
the spider move also in the same proportion, keeping 
that just time with her motion, as if the same soul 
had animated both these little bodies ; and whether 
it were forwards, backwards, or to either side, with- 
out at all turning her body, like a well managed horse : 
but if the capricious fly took wing and pitched upon 
another place behind our huntress, then would the 
spider whirl its body so nimbly about, as nothing 
could be imagined more swift: by which means she 
always kept the head towards her prey, though, to 
appearance, as immoveable as if it had been a nail 



* J. R. 







driven into the wood, till by that indiscernible pro- 
gress (being arrived within the sphere of her reach) 
she made a fatal leap, swift as lightning, upon the 
fly, catching him in the pole, where she never quitted 
hold till her belly was full, and then carried the re- 
mainder home.” 

One feels a little sceptical, however, when he adds, 
“ I have beheld them instructing their young ones 
how to hunt, which they would sometimes discipline 
for not well observing ; but when any of the old ones 
did (as sometimes) miss a leap, they would run out 
of the field and hide themselves in their crannies, as 
ashamed, and haply not to be seen abroad for four or 
five hours after ; for so long have I watched the 
Qature of this strange insect, the contemplation of 
whose so wonderful sagacity and address has 
amazed me ; nor do I find in any chase whatsoever 
more cunning and stratagem observed. I have found 
some of these spiders in my garden, when the wea- 
ther, towards spring, is very hot, but they are nothing 
so eager in hunting as in Italy ¦*.” 

We have only to add to this lively narrative, that 
the hunting spider, when he leaps, takes good care 
to provide against accidental falls by always swing- 
ing himself from a good strong cable of silk, as 
Swammerdam correctly states f, and which anybody 
may verify, as one of the small hunters ( Salticus sce- 
nicus ), known by having its back striped with black 
and white like a zebra, is very common in Britain. 

As a contrast to the little elastic satin nest of the 
hunter, we may mention the largest with which we 
are acquainted, — that of the labyrinthic spider ( Age - 
lena labyrinthica , Walckenaer). Our readers must 
often have seen this nest spread out like a broad 
sheet in hedges, furze, and other low bushes, and 

* Evelyn’s Travels in Italy. 

| Book of Nature, part i. page 24. 







sometimes on the ground. The middle of this sheet, 
which is of a close texture, is swung like a sailor’s 
hammock, by silken ropes extended all around to the 
higher branches ; but the whole curves upwards and 
backwards, sloping down to a long funnel-shaped 
gallery which is nearly horizontal at the entrance, 
but soon winds obliquely till it becomes quite per- 
pendicular. This curved gallery is about a quarter 
of an inch in diameter, is much more closely woven 
than the sheet part of the web, and sometimes de- 
scends into a hole in the ground, though oftener 
into a group of crowded twigs, or a tuft of grass. 
Here the spider dwells secure, frequently resting 
with her leo;s extended from the entrance of the gal- 
lery, ready to spring out upon whatever insect may 
fall into her sheet net. She herself can only be 
caught by getting behind her and forcing her out into 
the web ; but though we have often endeavoured to 
make her construct a nest under our eye, we have 
been as unsuccessful as in similar experiments with 
the common house spider (Aranea domestica*). 

The house spider’s proceedings were long ago de- 
scribed by Homberg, and the account has been copied, 
as usual, by almost every subsequent writer. Goldsmith 
has, indeed, given some strange mis-statements from 
his own observations, and Bingley has added the 
original remark, that, after fixing its first thread, 
creeping along the wall and joining it as it proceeds, 
it “ darts itself to the opposite side , where the other 
end is to be fastened +” ! Homberg’s spider took 
the more circuitous route of travelling to the opposite 
wall, carrying in one of the claws the end of the 
thread previously fixed, lest it should stick in the 
wrong place. This we believe to be the correct state- 
ment, for as the web is always horizontal, it would 



* J. R. 



f Animal Biography, iii, 470—1. 







seldom answer to commit a floating thread to the 
wind, as is done by other species. Homberg’s spider, 
after stretching as many lines by way of warp , as it 
deemed sufficient between the two walls of the corner 
which it had chosen, proceeded to cross this in the 
way our weavers do in adding the woof, with this 
difference, that the spider’s threads were only laid on 
and not interlaced*. The domestic spiders, however, 
in these modem days, must have forgot this mode of 
weaving, for none of their webs will be found to be 
thus regularly constructed. 

The geometric, or net-working spiders ( Tendeuses , 
Latr.), are as well known in most districts as any of 
the preceding ; almost every bush and tree in the 
gardens and hedge rows having one or more of their 
nets stretched out in a vertical position between ad- 
jacent branches. The common garden spider ( Epeira 
diadema ), and the long-bodied spider ( Tetragnatha 
eoctensa ), are the best known of this order. 

The chief care of a spider of this sort is, to form 
a cable of sufficient strength to bear the net she 
means to hang upon it ; and, after throwing out a 
floating line as above described, when it catches pro- 
perly she doubles and redoubles it with additional 
threads. On trying its strength she is not con- 
tented with the test of pulling it with her legs, but 
drops herself down several feet from various points 
of it, as we have often seen, swinging and bobbing 
with the whole weight of her body. She proceeds 
in a similar manner with the rest of the frame-work 
of her wheel-shaped net; and it may be remarked 
that some of the ends of these lines are not simple, 
but in form of a Y, giving her the additional security 
of two attachments instead of one. 

In constructing the body of the net, the most re-

Geometric Net of Epeira diadema. 



markable circumstance is her using her limbs as a 
measure, to regulate the distances of her radii or 
wheel-spokes, and the circular meshes interweaved 
into them. These are consequently always propor- 
tional to the size of the spider. She often takes up 
her station in the centre, but not always, though 
it is so said by inaccurate writers ; for she as fre- 
quently lurks in a little chamber constructed under 
a leaf or other shelter at the corner of her web, 
ready to dart down upon whatever prey may be en- 
tangled in her net. The centre of the net is said 
also to be composed of more viscid materials than its 



 



suspensory lines, — a circumstance alleged to be 
proved by the former appearing under the micro- 
scope studded with globules of gum *. We have not 
been able to verify this distinction, having seen the 
suspensory lines as often studded in this manner as 
those in the centre +. 

Mason-Spiders. 

A no less wonderful structure is composed by a 
sort of spiders, natives of the tropics and the South 
of Europe, which have been justly called mason- 
spiders by M. Latreille. One of these ( Mygale 
nidulans, Walckn.) found in the West Indies, “ digs 
a hole in the earth obliquely downwards, about three 
inches in length, and one in diameter. This cavity 
she lines with a tough thick web, which, when taken 
out, resembles a leathern purse ; but what is most 
curious, this house has a door with hinges, like the 
operculum of some sea-shells, and herself and family, 
who tenant this nest, open and shut the door when- 
ever they pass and repass. This history was told 
me,” says Darwin, “ and the nest, with its door, 
shewn me by the late Dr. Butt, of Bath, who was 
some years physician in Jamaica J.” 

The nest of a mason-spider, similar to this, has 
been obligingly put into our hands by Mr. Riddle, 
of Blackheath. It came from the West Indies, 
and is probably that of Latreille’s clay-kneader 
( Mygale cr aliens), and one of the smallest of the 
genus. It is composed of very hard argillaceous 
clay, deeply tinged with brown oxide of iron. It is 
in form of a tube, about one inch in diameter, between 
six and seven inches long, and slightly bent towards 
the lower extremity — appearing to have been mined 
into the clay rather than built. The interior of the

$ Darwin’s Zoonomia, i. 253, 8vo, ed. 






tube is lilted with an uniform tapestry of silken web, 
of an orange-white colour, with a texture interme- 
diate between Indian paper and very fine glove-leather. 
But the most wonderful part of this nest is its en- 
trance, which we look upon as the perfection of insect 
architecture. A circular door, about the size of a 
crown piece, slightly concave on the outside and 
convex within, is formed of more than a dozen layers 
of the same web which lines the interior, closely laid 
upon one another, and shaped so that the inner 
layers are the broadest, the outer being gradually less 
in diameter, except towards the hinge, which is about 
an inch long ; and in consequence of all the layers 
being united there, and prolonged into the tube, it 
becomes the thickest and strongest part of the struc- 
ture. The elasticity of the materials, also, gives to 
this hinge the remarkable peculiarity of acting like a 
spring, and shutting the door of the nest spontane- 
ously. It is, besides, made to fit so accurately to the 
aperture, which is composed of similar concentric 
layers of web, that it is almost impossible to distin- 
guish the joining by the most careful inspection. To 
gratify curiosity, the door has been opened and shut 
hundreds of times, without in the least destroying 
the power of the spring. When the door is shut, it 
resembles some of the lichens ( Lecidea ), or the 
leathery fungi, such as Polyporus versicolor , (Mi- 
cheli,) or, nearer still, the upper valve of a young 
oyster shell. The whole nest being of a blackish- 
brown colour, it must be very difficult to discover *. 

Another mason-spider {My gale ccementaria, Latr.) 
found in the South of France, usually selects for her 
nest a place bare of grass, sloping in such a mariner as 
to carry off the water, and of a firm soil, without rocks 
or small stones. She digs a gallery a foot or two

in depth, and of a diameter (equal throughout) suf- 
ficient to admit of her easily passing. She lines this 
with a tapestry of silk, glued to the walls. The door, 
which is circular, is constructed of many layers of 
earth kneaded, and bound together with silk. Ex- 
ternally, it is flat and rough, corresponding to the 
earth around the entrance, for the purpose, no doubt, 
of concealment : on the inside it is convex, and ta- 
pestried thickly with a web of fine silk. The threads 
of this door-tapestry are prolonged, and strongly at- 
tached to the upper side of the entrance, forming an 
excellent hinge, which, when pushed open by the 
spider, shuts again by its own weight, without the

aid of spring- hinges. When the spider is at home, 
and her door forcibly opened by an intruder, she 
pulls it strongly inwards, and even when half-opened 
often snatches it out of the hand ; but when she is 
foiled in this, she retreats to the bottom of her den, 
as her last resource*. 

Rossi ascertained that the female of an allied species 
(My gale sauvagesii, Latr.), found in Corsica, lived 
in one of these nests with a numerous posterity. He 
destroyed one of these doors to observe whether a 
new one would be made, which it was : but it was 
fixed immoveably, without a hinge ; the spider, no 
doubt, fortifying herself in this manner till she 
thought she might re-open it without danger t. 

“ The Rev. Revett Shepherd has often noticed 
in the fen ditches of Norfolk, a very large spider 
(the species not yet determined) which actually 
forms a raft for the purpose of obtaining its prey 
with more facility. Keeping its station upon a ball 
of weeds about three inches in diameter, probably 
held together by slight silken cords, it is wafted 
along the surface of the water upon this floating 
island, which it quits the moment it sees a drowning 
insect. The booty thus seized it devours at leisure 
upon its raft, under which it retires when alarmed by 
any danger 

Among our native spiders there are several be- 
side this one, which, not contented with a web like 
the rest of their congeners, take advantage of other 
materials to construct cells where, “ hush’d in grim 
repose,’’ they “ expect their insect prey.” The 
most simple of those spider-cells is constructed

by a longish-bodied spider ( Aranea holosericea , 
Linn.), which is a little larger than the common 
hunting spider. It rolls up a leaf of the lilac or 
poplar, precisely in the same manner as is done 
by the leaf-rolling caterpillars, upon whose cells it 
sometimes seizes to save itself trouble, having first 
expelled, or perhaps devoured, the rightful owner. 
The spider, however, is not satisfied with the tapes- 
try of the caterpillar, and always weaves a fresh set 
of her own, much more close and substantial. 

Another spider common in woods and copses 
( Epeira quadrata ?) weaves together a great number 
of leaves to form a dwelling for herself, and in front 
of it she spreads her toils for entrapping the unwary 
insects which stray thither. These, as soon as caught, 
are dragged into her den, and stored up for a time 
of scarcity. Here also her eggs are deposited and 
hatched in safety. When the cold weather approaches, 
and the leaves of her edifice wither, she abandons it 
for the more secure shelter of a hollow tree, where 
she soon dies ; but the continuation of the species 
depends upon eggs, deposited in the nest before win- 
ter, and remaining to be hatched with the warmth 
of the ensuing summer. 

The spider’s den of united leaves, however, which 
has just been described, is not always useless when 
withered and deserted ; for the dormouse, or the 
harvest mouse (Mus mesorius ), we are not certain 
which, usually selects it as a ready-made roof for its 
nest of dried grass. That those old spiders’ dens are 
not accidentally chosen by the mouse, appears from 
the fact, that out of about a dozen mouse-nests of 
this sort found during winter in a copse between 
Lewisham and Bromley, Kent, every second or third 
one was furnished with such a roof*.

Diving Water-Spider. 

That spiders may be able to breathe under water, 
we can well understand from their breathing like 
amphibious reptiles by means of gills ; but there is an 
aquatic spider ( Argyroneta aquatica , Walckenaer) 
which is not contented, as a frog would be, with the air 
furnished by the water, but actually carries down a 
supply of air from the atmosphere to her subaqueous 
nest. This spider does not like stagnant water, but 
prefers slow-running streams and ditches, where she 
may often be seen, in the vicinity of London and else- 
where, living in her diving-bell, which shines through 
the water like a little globe of silver : her singular 
economy was first, we believe, described by Clerck*, 
L. M. de Lignac t, and De Geer. 

“ The shining appearance,” says Clerck, “ pro- 
ceeds either from an inflated globule surrounding the 
abdomen, or from the space between the body and the 
water. The spider when wishing to inhale the air, 
rises to the surface with its body still submersed, and 
only the part containing the spinneret rising just to 
the surface, when it briskly opens and moves its four 
teats. A deep cone of hair keeps the water from 
approaching or wetting the abdomen. It comes up 
for air about four times an hour or oftener, though 
I have good reason to suppose it can continue with- 
out it for several days together. 

“ I found in the middle of May one male and ten 
females, which I put into a glass filled with water, 
where they lived together very quietly for eight days. 

I put some duck weed ( Lemna ) into the glass to 
afford them shelter, and the females began to stretch 
diagonal threads in a confused manner from it to the 

* Aratiei Suecici, Stockholm, 1757.

sides of the glass about half way down. Each of the 
females afterwards fixed a close bag to the edge of 
the glass, from which the water was expelled by the 
air from the spinneret, and thus a cell was formed 
capable of containing the whole animal. Here 
they remained quietly, with their abdomens in their 
cells, and their bodies still plunged in the water; and 
in a short time brimstone-coloured bags of eggs ap- 
peared in each cell, filling it about a fourth part. On 
the 7th of July several young ones swam out from 
one of the bags: — all this time the old ones had no- 
thing to eat, and yet they never attacked one another 
as other spiders would have been apt to do*.” 

“ These spiders,” says De Geer, “ spin in the 
water a cell of strong, closely woven, white silk in 
the form of half the shell of a pigeon’s egg, or like a 
diving-bell. This is sometimes left partly above 
water, but at others is entirely submersed, and is 
always attached to the objects near it by a great num- 
ber of irregular threads. It is closed all round, but 
has a large opening below, which, however, I found 
closed on the 1 5th of December, and the spider living 
quietly within, with her head downwards. I made a 
rent in this cell and expelled the air, upon which the 
spider came out; yet though she appeared to have 
been laid up for three months in her winter quar- 
ters, she greedily seized upon an insect and sucked 
it. I also found that the male as well as the female 
constructs a similar subaqueous cell, and during 
summer no less than in winter f.” 

Cleanliness of Spiders. 

When we look at the viscid material with which 
spiders construct their lines and webs, and at the 



515 Clerck, Aranei Suecici, Cap. viii. 
t De Geer,Mern. des Insectes, vii. 312. 







rough, hairy covering (with a few exceptions) of 
their bodies, we might conclude that they would 
be always stuck over with fragments of the minute 
fibres which they produce. This, indeed, must often 
happen, did they not take careful precautions to avoid 
it ; for we have observed that they seldom, if ever, leave 
a thread to float at random, except when they wish to 
form a bridge. When a spider drops along a line, 
for instance, in order to ascertain the strength of her 
web, or the nature of the place below her, she inva- 
riably, when she re-ascends, coils it up into a little ball, 
and throws it away. Her claws are admirably 
adapted for this purpose, as well as for walking along 
the lines, as may be readily seen by a magnifying 
glass. 




Triple-clawed foot of a Spider, magnified. 



There are three fclaws, one of which acts as a 
thumb, the others being toothed like a comb, for 
nrlidinir alonff the lines. This structure, however, 
unfits it to walk, as flies can do, upon any upright 
polished surface like glass ; although the contrary * 
is erroneously asserted by the Abbe de la Pluche. 
Before she can do so, she is obliged to construct a 
ladder of ropes, as Mr. Blackwall remarks t, by ele- 
vating her spinneret as high as she can, and laying 



* Spectacle de la Nature, i. 58, f Linn. Trans, vol. xv. 



 



down a step upon which she stands to form a second ; 
and so on, as any one may try by placing a spider 
at the bottom of a very clean wine glass. 

The hairs of the legs, however, are always catching 
bits of web and particles of dust ; but these are not 
suffered to remain long. Most people may have re- 
marked that the house-fly is ever and anon brushing 
its feet upon one another to rub off the dust, though 
we have not seen it remarked in authors, that spiders 
are equally assiduous in keeping themselves clean. 
They have, besides, a more efficient instrument than 
the fly, in their mandibles or jaws, which, like their 
claws, are furnished with teeth ; and a spider which 
appears to a careless observer as resting idly, in nine 
cases out of ten, will be found slowly combing her 
legs with her mandibles, beginning as high as pos- 
sible on the thigh, and passing down to the claws. 
The flue which she thus combs off is regularly tossed 
away. 

With respect to the house-spider (A. domestica ), 
we are told in books, that she “ from time to time 
clears away the dust from her web, and sweeps the 
whole by giving it a shake with her paw, so nicely 
proportioning the force of her blow, that she never 
breaks any thing*.” That spiders may be seen 
shaking their webs in this manner, we readily 
admit ; though it is not, we imagine, to clear them 
of dust, but to ascertain whether they are sufficiently 
sound and strong. 

We recently witnessed a more laborious process of 
cleaning a web than merely shaking it. On coming 
down the Maine by the steam boat from Frankfort, 
in August 1829, we observed the geometric-net of a 
conic-spider (Epeira conica, VValck.) on the frame- 
work of the deck, and as it was covered with flakes 



* Spectacle de la Nature, i. p. 61. 







of soot from the smoke of the engine, we were sur- 
prised to see a spider at work on it ; for, in order to 
be useful, this sort of net must be clean. Upon ob- 
serving it a little closely, however, we perceived that 
she was not constructing a net, but dressing up an 
old one ; though not, we must think, to save trouble, 
so much as an expenditure of material. Some of the 
lines she dextrously stripped of the flakes of soot 
adhering to them ; but in the greater number finding 
that she could not get them sufficiently clean, she 
broke them quite off, bundled them up, and tossed 
them over. We counted five of these packets of 
rubbish which she thus threw away, though there 
must have been many more, as it was some time 
before we discovered the manoeuvre, the packets 
being so small as not to be readily perceived, except 
when placed between the eye and the light. When 
she had cleared off all the sooted lines, she began to 
replace them in the usual way ; but the arrival of the 
boat at Mentz put an end to our observations*. 



* J. R. 






Many of the processes which we have detailed 
bear some resemblance to our own operations of 
building with materials cemented together ; but we 
shall now turn our attention to a class of insect- 
architects, who cannot, so far as we know, be matched 
in prospective skill, by any of the higher orders of 
animals. We refer to the numerous family which 
have received the name of gall-flies, — a family 
which, as yet, is very imperfectly understood, their 
economy being no less difficult to trace, than their 
species is to arrange in the established systems of 
classification. 

One of the most simple and very common in- 




Small berry\shaped galls of the oak leaf, produced by Ci/nips Qusrcusfolii ? 







stances of the nests constructed by gall-insects, may 
be found in abundance during the summer, on the 
leaves of the rose-tree, the oak, the poplar, the wil- 
low ( Salix viminalis,) and many other trees, in the 
globular form of a berry, about the size of a currant, 
and usually of a green colour, tinged with red, like 
a ripe Alban or Baltimore apple. 

When this pseudo-apple in miniature is cut into, 
it is found to be fresh, firm, juicy, and hollow in the 
centre, where there is either an egg or a grub safely 
lodged, and protected from all ordinary accidents. 
Within this hollow ball the egg is hatched, and the 
grub feeds securely on its substance, till it prepares 
for its winter sleep, before changing into a gall-fly 
( Cynips ), in the ensuing summer. There is a mys- 
tery as to the manner in which this gall-fly contrives 
to produce the hollow miniature-apples, each en- 
closing one of her eggs ; and the doubts attendant 
upon the subject cannot, so far as our present know- 
ledge extends, be solved, except by plausible conjec- 
ture. Our earlier naturalists were of opinion that it 
was the grub which produced the galls, by eating, 
when newly hatched, through the cuticle of the leaf, 
and remaining till the juices flowing from the wound 
enveloped it, and acquired consistence by exposure 
to the air. This opinion, however, plausible as it 
appeared to be, was at once disproved by finding un- 
hatched eggs on opening the galls. 

There can be no doubt, indeed, that the mother gall- 
fly makes a hole in the plant for the purpose of 
depositing her eggs. She is furnished with an 
admirable ovipositor for that express purpose, and 
Swammerdam actually saw a gall-fly thus deposit- 
ing her eggs. In some of these insects the ovi- 
positor is conspicuously long, even when the insect 
is at rest ; but in others, not above a line or two 
of it is visible, till the belly of the insect be gently 







pressed. When this is done to the fly that pro- 
duces the currant-gall of the oak, the ovipositor may 
be seen issuing from a sheath in form of a small 
curved needle, of a chestnut-brown colour, and of a 
horny substance, and three times as long as it at first 
appeared. 




Ovipositor of gall-flu , greatly magnified. 



What is most remarkable in this ovipositor is, that 
it is much longer than the whole body of the insect, 
in whose belly it is lodged in a sheath, and from its 
horny nature, it cannot be either shortened or length- 
ened. It is on this account that it is bent into the 
same curve as the body of the insect. The me- 
chanism by which this is effected is similar to that 
of the tongue of a woodpecker (picas'), which, 
though rather short, can be darted out far beyond 
the beak, by means of the hyoid-bone * being thin and 
rolled up like the spring of a watch. The base of 
the ovipositor of the gall-fly is, in a similar way, 
placed near the anus, runs along the curvature of the 
back, makes a turn at the breast, and then, following 
the curve of the belly, appears again near where it 
originates. We copy from Reaumur his accurate 
sketch of this remarkable structure. 



* A forked bone at the root of the tongue. 








Gall-fly, and mechanism of ovipositor, greatly magnified. 



With this instrument the mother gall-fly pierces 
the part of a plant which she selects, and, according 
to our older naturalists, “ ejects into the cavity a drop 
of her corroding liquor, and immediately lays an egg 
or more there ; the circulation of the sap being thus 
interrupted, and thrown, by the poison, into a fer- 
mentation that burns the contiguous parts, and 
changes the natural colour. The sap, turned from 
its proper channel, extravasates and flows round the 
eggs while its surface is dried by the external air, and 
hardens into a vaulted form*.” Kirby and Spence 
tell us, that the parent fly introduces her egg “ into 
a puncture made by her curious spiral sting, and in a 
few hours it becomes surrounded with a fleshy cham- 
ber t.” M. Virey says, the gall tubercle is produced 
by irritation, in the same way as an inflamed tumor 

* Spectacle de la Nature, i, 119. 
f Introd., ii. 449. 







in an animal body, by the swelling - of the cellular 
tissue and the flow of liquid matter, which changes 
the organization, and alters the natural external 
form*. This seems to be the received doctrine at 
present in Francef. 

Sprengel, speaking of the rose-willow, says, the 
insect in spring deposits its eggs in the leaf buds. 
“ The new stimulus attracts the sap, — the type of the 
part becomes changed, and from the prevailing 
acidity of the animal juice, it happens, that in the 
rose and stock-shaped leaves which are pushed out, 
a red instead of a green colour is evolved J.” 

Without pretending positively to state facts which 
are, perhaps, beyond human penetration, we may view 
the process in a rather different light §. Following 
the analogy of what is known to occur in the case of 
the saw-flies (see page 156), after the gall-fly has 
made a puncture and pushed her egg into the hole, 
we may suppose that she covers it over with some 
adhesive gluten or gum, or the egg itself, as is usual 
among moths, &c., may be coated over with such a 
gluten. In either of these two cases, the gluten will 
prevent the sap that flows through the puncture from 
being scattered over the leaf and wasted ; and the 
sap, being thus confined to the space occupied by the 
eggs, will expand and force outwards the pellicle of 
gluten that confines it, till becoming thickened by 
evaporation and exposure to the air, it at length shuts 
up the puncture, stops the further escape of the sap, 
and the process is completed. This explanation 
will completely account tor the globular form of the 
galls alluded to ; that is, supposing the egg of the 



* Hist, des Moeurs et de l’l nstinct, vol. ii.

$ J. R. , 







gall-fly to be globular, and covered, or coated with a 
pellicle of gluten of uniform thickness, and conse- 
quently opposing uniform resistance, or rather uni- 
form expansibility, to the sap pressing from within. 
It will also account for the remarkable uniformity in 
the size of the gall apples ; for the punctures and the 
eggs being uniform in size, and the gluten, by sup- 
position, uniform in quantity, no more than the 
same quantity of sap can escape in such circum- 
stances. 

But though this explanation appears to be plau- 
sible, it is confessedly altogether conjectural ; for 
nobody since Swammerdam, so far as we at pre- 
sent know, has ever detected a gall-fly in the act 
of depositing her eggs, and he did not attend to this 
circumstance. The indefatigable Reaumur, on one 
occasion, thought he would make sure of tracing the 
steps of the process in the case of the gall-fly, which 
produces the bedeguar * on the wild-rose tree, and to 
which we shall presently advert. His plan was to 
enclose in a box, in which a brood of flies had just 
been produced from a bedeguar, a living branch from 
a wild rose-tree ; but, to his great disappointment, 
no eggs were laid, and no bedeguar formed. Upon 
further investigation, he discovered that the brood 
of flies produced from the bedeguar were not the 
genuine bedeguar insects at all, but one of the 
parasite ichneumons ( Callimone Bedeguciris, Ste- 
phens,) which had surreptitiously deposited their 
eggs there, in order to supply their young with the 
bedeguar grubs, all of which they appeared to have 
devoured. It may prove interesting to look into the 
remarkable structure of the bedeguar itself, which 
is very different from the globular galls above de- 
scribed. 



* The gall of the rose is so called botanically. 






Bedeguar gall of the rose, produced bg Cynips Roscr. 



The gall-fly of the willow ( Cynips viminalis ) de- 
posits, as we have just seen, only a single egg on 
one spot; but the bedeguar-insect lays a large cluster 
of eggs on the extremity of a growing branch of the 
wild rose-tree, making, probably, a proportionate 
number of punctures to procure materials for the 
future habitation of her young progeny. As in the 
former case also, each of these eggs becomes (as we 
may suppose) surrounded with the sap of the rose, 
enclosed in a pellicle of gluten. The gluten, how- 
ever, of the bedeguar insect, is not, it would appear, 
sufficiently tenacious to confine the flowing sap 
within the dimensions of any of the little clustered 
globes containing the eggs, for it oozes out from 
numerous cracks or pores in the pellicle; which 







cracks or pores, however, are not large enough to 
admit a human hair. But this, so far from beinc: a 



defect in the glutinous pellicle of the bedeguar fly, 
is, as we shall presently see, of great utility. The 
sap which issues from each of those pores, instead of 
being evaporated and lost, shoots out into a reddish- 
coloured, fibrous bristle. 




One of the bristles of the Bedeguar of the rose magnified. 

It is about half an inch long, and, from the natural 
tendency of the sap of the rose tree to form prickles, 
these are all over studded with weak pricklets. The 
bedeguar, accordingly, when fully formed, has some 
resemblance, at a little distance, to a tuft of reddish- 
brown hair or moss, stuck upon the branch. Some- 
times this tuft is as large as a small apple, and of a 
rounded, but irregular shape ; at other times it is 
smaller, and in one instance mentioned by Reau- 
mur, only a single egg had been laid on a rose leaf, 
and consequently, only one tuft was produced. 
Each member of the congeries is furnished with its 
own tuft of bristles, arising from the little hollow 
globe in which the egg or the grub is lodged. 

The prospective wisdom of this curious structure 
is admirable. The bedeguar grubs live in their cells 
through the winter, and as their domicile is usually 
on one of the highest branches, it must be exposed 
to every severity of the weather. But the close, non- 
conducting, warm, mossy collection of bristles with 
which it is surrounded, forms for the soft, tender 
grubs a snug protection against the winter’s cold, till, 







through the influence of the warmth of the succeed- 
ing summer, they undergo their final change into the 
winged state, — preparatory to which they eat their 
way with their sharp mandibles through the walls of 
their little cells, which are now so hard as to be cut 
with difficulty by a knife*. 

Another structure, similar in principle, though dif- 
ferent in appearance, is very common upon oak-trees, 
the termination of a branch being selected as best 
suited for the purpose. This structure is rather 
larger than a filbert, and is composed of concentric 
leaves diverging from the base, and expanding up- 
wards, somewhat like an artichoke. Whether this

leafy structure is caused by a superinduced disease, 
as the French think, or by the form of the pores in 
the pellicle of gluten surrounding the eggs, or rather 
by the tendency of the exuding sap of the oak to 
form leaves, has not been ascertained ; but that it is 
intended, as in the case of the bedeguar, to afford 
an efficient protection against the weather to the in- 
cluded eggs or grubs, there can be no doubt. 

From the very nature of the process of forming 
willow-galls, bedeguar, and the artichoke of the 
oak, whatever theory be adopted, it will be obvious 
that their growth must be rapid ; for the thicken- 
ing of the exuded sap, which is quickly effected by 
evaporation, will soon obstruct and finally close the 
orifice of the puncture made by the parent insect. 
It is accordingly asserted by Reaumur and other ob- 
servers, that all the species of galls soon reach their 
full growth. 

A very minute reddish-coloured grub feeds upon 
dyer’s broom ( Genista ), producing a sort of gall, fre- 
quently globular, but always studded with bristles, 
arising from the amorphous leaves. The stem of 
the shrub passes through this ball, which is com- 
posed of a great number of leaves, shorter and 
broader than natural, and each rolled into the form 
of a horn, the point of which ends in a bristle. In 
the interior we find a thick fleshy substance, serving 
to sustain the leaves, and also for the nourishment 
of the grubs, some of which are within and some 
between the leaves. They are in prodigious num- 
bers, — hundreds being assembled in the same gall, 
and so minute as scarcely to be perceived without 
the aid of a magnifying glass. The bud of the plant 
attacked by those grubs, instead of forming a shoot, 
pushes out nothing but leaves, and these are all 
rolled and turned round the stem. Some shrubs 







have several of these galls, which are of various 
sizes, from that of a filbert to that of a walnut.

A similar but still more beautiful production is 
found upon one of the commonest of our indigenous 
willows ( Salix purpurea ), which takes the name of 
rose-willow, more probably from the circumstance 
than from the red colour of its twigs. The older 
botanists, not being aware of the cause of such ex- 
crescences, considered the plants so affected as dis- 
tinct species ; and old Gerard, accordingly, figures 
and describes the rose-willow as “ not onlie making 
a gallant shew, but also yeelding a most cooling aire 
in the heat of summer, being set up in houses for 
decking the same.” The production in question, 
however, is nothing more than the effect produced 
by a species of gall-fly ( Cynips salicis ) depositing its 
eggs in the terminal shoot of a twig, and, like the 






bedeguar and the oak artichoke, causing leaves to 
spring out, of a shape totally different from the other 
leaves of the tree, and arranged very much like the 
petals of a rose. Decandolle says it is found chiefly 
on the Salix helix, S. alba , and S. riparia*. 

A production very like that of the rose-willow 
may be commonly met with on the young shoots of 
the hawthorn, the growth of the shoot affected being 
stopped, and a crowded bunch of leaves formed at 
the termination. These leaves, beside being smaller 
than natural, are studded with short bristly prickles, 
from the sap (we may suppose) of the hawthorn 
being prevented from rising into a fresh shoot, and 
thrown out of its usual course in the formation of 
the arms. These bristles appear indiscriminately 
on both sides of the leaves, some of which are bent 
inwards, while others diverge in their natural manner. 

This is not caused by the egg or grub of a true 
gall-fly, but by the small white tapering grub of 
some dipterous insect, of which we have not ascer- 
tained the species, but which is, probably, a ceci - 
domyia. Each terminal shoot is inhabited by a 
number of these — not lodged in cells, however, but 
burrowing indiscriminately among the half-withered 
brown leaves which occupy the centre of the pro- 
duction f. 

A more remarkable species of gall than any of 
the above, we discovered in June, 1829, on the 
twig of an oak in the grounds of Mr. Perkins, at 
Lee, in Kent. When we first saw it, we imagined 
that the twig was beset with some species of the 
lanigerous aphides, similar to what is vulgarly called 
the American or white blight ( aphis lanata ) ; but 
on closer examination we discarded this notion. The 
twig was indeed thickly beset with a white downy,

or rather woolly, substance around the stem at the 
origin of the leaves, which did not appear to be 
affected in their growth, being well formed, healthy, 
and luxuriant. We could not doubt that the woolly 
substance was caused by some insect ; but though 
we cut out a portion of it, we could not detect any* 
egg or grab, and we therefore threw the branch 
into a drawer, intending to keep it as a specimen, 
whose history we might complete at some subse- 
quent period. 

A few weeks afterwards, on opening this drawer, 
we were surprised to see a brood of several dozens 
of a species of gall-fly ( Cynips ), similar in form and 
size to that whose ego's cause the bedeguar of the 
rose, and differing only in being of a lighter colour, 
tending to a yellowish brown. We have since met 
with a figure and description of this gall in Swam- 
merdam. We may remark that the above is not the 
first instance which has occurred in our researches, 
of gall insects outliving the withering of the branch 
or leaf from which they obtain their nourishment. 







JVoolly Gall of the Oak , caused ly a cynips, and drawn from a 

specimen. 

The woolly substance on the branch of the oak 
which we have described was similarly constituted 
with the bedeguar of the rose, with this difference, 
that instead of the individual cells being diffused 
irregularly through the mass, they were all arranged 
at the off-ffoino-s of the leafstalks, each cell beins; 
surrounded with a covering of the vegetable wool, 
which the stimulus of the parent egg, or its gluten, 
had caused to grow, and from each cell a perfect 
fly had issued. We also remarked that there were 
several small groups of individual cells, each of which 
groups was contained in a species of calyx or cup 
of leaf-scales, as occurs also in the well-known gall 
called the oak-apple. 







We were anxious to watch the proceedings of these 
flies in the deposition of their eggs, and the subse- 
quent developments of the gall-growths ; and endea- 
voured for that purpose to procure a small oak plant 
in a garden-pot ; but we did not succeed in this : and 
though they alighted on rose and sweet-briar trees, 
which we placed in their way, we never observed that 
they deposited any eggs upon them. In a week or 
two the whole brood died, or disappeared 

There are some galls, formed on low-growing 
plants, which are covered with down, hair, or wool, 
though by no means so copiously as the one which 
we have just described. Among the plants so affected 
are the germander speedwell, wild-thyme, ground- 
ivy, and others, to which we shall afterwards advert. 

The well-known oak-apple is a very pretty example 
of the galls formed by insects ; and this, when com- 
pared with other galls which form on the oak, shews 
the remarkable difference produced on the same plant 
by the punctures of insects of different species. The 




Oal^apple galls, cns being cut, open to shew the vessels running to 

granules. 



* J. R. 







oak-apple is commonly as large as a walnut or small 
apple, rounded, but not quite spherical, the surface 
being irregularly depressed in various places. The 
skin is smooth, and tinged with red and yellow, like a 
ripe apple ; and at the base there is, in the earlier part 
of the summer, a calyx or cup of five or six small 
brown scaly leaves; but these fall off as the season ad- 
vances. If an oak-apple, be cut transversely, there is 
brought into view a number of oval granules, each con- 
taining a grub, and embedded in a fruit-looking fleshy 
substance, having fibres running through it. As these 
fibres, however, run in the direction of the stem, they 
are best exhibited by a vertical section of the gall ; 
and this also shows the remarkable peculiarity of 
each fibre terminating in one of the granules, like a 
footstalk, or rather like a vessel for carrying nourish- 
ment. Reaumur, indeed, is of opinion that these 
fibres are the diverted nervures of the leaves, which 
would have sprung from the bud in which the gall- 
fly had inserted her eggs, and actually do carry sap- 
vessels throughout the substance of the 2;all. 



Reaumur says the perfect insects ( Cynips quercus ) 
issued from his galls in June and the beginning of 
July, and were of a reddish-amber colour. We have 
procured insects, agreeing with Reaumur’s descrip- 
tion, from galls formed on the bark or wood of the 




Ruot-Cidlls of the Oalt, produced by Cynips quercus inferus ? drawn 

from a specimen. 



Oak, at the line of junction between the root and the 
stem. These galls are precisely similar in structure 





to the oak-apple, and are probably formed at a season 
when the fly perceives, instinctively, that the buds of 
the young branches are unfit for the purpose of 
nidification. 

There is another oak-gall, differing little in size 
and appearance from the oak-apple, but which is 
very different in structure, as instead of giving pro- 
tection and nourishment to a number of grubs, it is 
only inhabited by one. This sort of gall, besides, is 
hard and woody on the outside, resembling a little 
wooden ball of a yellowish colour, but internally of 
a soft, spongy texture. The latter substance, how- 
ever, incloses a small hard gall, which is the im- 
mediate residence of the included insect. Galls of 
this description are often found in clusters of from 
two to seven, near the extremity of a branch, not 
incorporated, however, but distinctly separate. 

We have obtained a fly very similar to this from a 
very common gall, which is formed on the branches 




JVoody-Gall on a JFiilow branch, drawn from a specimen. 

of the willow. Like the one-celled galls just de- 
scribed, this is of a hard, ligneous structure, and 
forms an irregular protuberance, sometimes at the 







extremity, and sometimes on the body, of a branch. 
But instead of one, this has a considerable number 
of cells, irregularly distributed through its substance. 
The structure is somewhat spongy, but fibrous ; and 
externally the bark is smoother than that of the 
branch upon which it grows *. 

The currant-galls (as the French call them) of the 
oak are exactly similar, when formed on the leaves, 
to those which we have first described as produced 
on the leaves of the willow and other trees. But the 
name of currant-gall seems still more appropriate to 
an excrescence which grows on the catkins of the 
oak, giving them very much the appearance of a 
straggling bunch of currants or bird-cherries. The 
galls resemble currants which have fallen from the 
tree before being ripe. These galls do not seem to 
differ from those formed on the leaves of the oak ; 
and are probably the production of the same insect.

which selects the catkin in preference, by the same 
instinct that the oak-apple gall-fly, as we have seen, 
sometimes deposits its eggs in the bark of the oak 
near the root. 

The gall of the oak, which forms an important 
dye-staff, and is used in making writing-ink, is also 
produced by a Cynips , and has been described in the 
Library of Entertaining Knowledge , (Vegetable 
Substances, p. 16.) The employment of the Cynips 
psenes for ripening figs is described in the same 
volume, p. 244. 

Gall of a Hawthorn Weevil. 

In May, 1829, we found on a hawthorn at Lee, in 
Kent, the leaves at the extremity of a branch neatly 
folded up in a bundle, but not quite so closely as is 
usual in the case of leaf-rolling caterpillars. On 
opening them up, there was no caterpillar to be 
seen, the centre being occupied with a roundish, 
brown-coloured, woody substance, similar to some 
excrescences made by gall-insects {Cynips). Had 
we been aware of its real nature, w r e should have put 
it immediately under a glass or in a box, till the con- 
tained insect had developed itself ; but instead of this, 
we opened the ball, where we found a small yellow- 
ish grub coiled up, and feeding on the exuding 
juices of the tree. As we could not replace the grub 
in its cell, part of the walls of which we had unfor- 
tunately broken, we put it in a small pasteboard box 
with a fresh shoot of hawthorn, expecting that it 
might construct a fresh cell. This, however, it was 
probably incompetent to perform : it did not at least 
make the attempt, and neither did it seem to feed on 
the fresh branch, keeping in preference to the ruins 
of its former cell. To our great surprise, although 
it was thus exposed to the air, and deprived of a con- 
siderable portion of its nourishment, both from the 







part of the cell having been broken off, and from the 
juices of the branch having been dried up, the insect 
went through its regular changes, and appeared in 
the form of a small greyish-brown beetle of the weevil

family. The most remarkable circumstance in the 
case in question, was the apparent inability of the 
grub to construct a fresh cell after the first was in- 
jured, — proving, we think, beyond a doubt, that it 
is the puncture made by the parent insect when the 
egg is deposited, that causes the exudation and sub- 
sequent concretion of the juices forming the gall 
A few other instances of beetles producing galls 
are recorded by naturalists. Kirbv and Spence have 
ascertained, for example, that the bumps formed on 
the roots of kedlock or charlock ( S inapis arvensis ) 
are inhabited by the larvse of a weevil ( Curculio 
contractus, Mars ham ; and Rhynchcenus assimilis, 
Fabr.) ; and it may be reasonably supposed that 
either the same or similar insects cause the clubbing

of the roots of cabbages, and the knob-like galls on 
turnips, called in some places the anbury. They 
are evidently beetles of an allied genus which form 
the woody galls sometimes met with on the leaves of 
the guelder-rose (Viburnum), the lime-tree (Tilia 
europcea ), and the beech ( Fagus sylvatica). 

There are also some two-winged flies which pro- 
duce woody galls on various plants, such as the 
thistle-fly (Tephritis cardui , Latr.) The grubs of 
this pretty fly produce on the leaf-stalks of thistles 
an oblong woody knob. On the common white 
briony (Bryonia clioica) of our hedges may be 
found a very pretty fly of this genus, of a yellowish 
brown colour, with pellucid wings, waved much 
like those of the thistle-fly with yellowish brown. 
This fly lays its eggs near a joint of the stem, and 
the grubs live upon its substance. The joint swells 
out into an oval form, furrowed in several places, 
and the fly is subsequently disclosed. In its perfect 
state, it feeds on the blossom of the briony*. Flies 
of another minute family, the gall-gnats ( Cecidomyice , 
Latr.), pass the first stage of their existence in the 
small globular cottony galls which abound on ger- 
mander speedwell (Veronica chamcedrys), wild thyme 
(Thymus serpyllum ), and ground ivy (Glechoma 
hederacea ) . The latter is by no means uncommon, 
and may be readily recognised. 

Certain species of plant-lice (Aphides), whose com- 
plete history would require a volume, produce ex- 
crescences upon plants which may with some pro- 
priety be termed galls, or semi-galls. Some of these 
are without any aperture, whilst others are in form 
of an inflated vesicle, with a narrow opening on the 
under side of a leaf, and expanding (for the most 
part irregularly) into a rounded knob on its upper 



* J. R, 







surface. The mountain-ash ( Pyrns aucuparia) has 
its leaves and young shoots frequently affected in 
this way, and sometimes exhibits galls larger than a 
walnut, or even than a man’s fist : at other times 
they do not grow larger than a filbert. Upon open- 
ing one of these, they are found to be filled with the 
aphides sorhi. If taken at an early stage of then- 
growth, they are found open on the under side of the 
leaf, and inhabited only by a single female aphis, 
pregnant with a numerous family of young. In a 
short time, the aperture becomes closed, in conse- 
quence of the insect making repeated punctures 
round its edge, from which sap is exuded, and 
forms an additional portion of the walls of the cell. 




A Plant Louse (Aphis), magnified- 

In this early stage of its growth, however, the gall 
does not, like the galls of the cynips, increase very 
much in dimensions. It is after the increase of the 
inhabitants by the young brood that it grows with 
considerable rapidity ; for each additional insect, in 
order to procure food, has to puncture the wall of the 
chamber and suck the juices, and from the punctures 
thus made the sap exudes, and enlarges the walls. 
As those galls are closed all round in the more ad- 
vanced state, it does not appear how the insects can 
£.ver effect an exit from their imprisonment. 

A much more common production, allied to the 







one just described, may be found on the poplar, in 
June and July. Most of our readers may have ob- 
served, about Midsummer, a small snow-white tuft 
of downy-looking substance floating 1 about on the 
wind, as if animated. Those tufts of snow-white 
down are never seen in numbers at the same time, 
but generally single, though some dozens of them 
may be observed in the course of one day. This sin- 
gular object is a four-winged fly ( [Eriosomci populi, 
Leach), whose body is thickly covered with long 
down — a covering which seems to impede its flight, 
and make it appear more like an inanimate substance 
floating about on the wind, than impelled by the 
volition of a living animal. This pretty fly feeds 
upon the fresh juices of the black poplar, preferring 
that of the leaves and leaf-stalks, which it punctures 
for this purpose with its beak. It fixes itself with 
this design to a suitable place upon the principal 
nervure of the leaf, or upon the leaf-stalk, and re- 
mains in the same spot till the sap, exuding through 
the punctures, and thickening by contact with the 
air, surrounds it with a thick fleshy wall of living 
vegetable substance, intermediate in texture between 
the wood and the leaf, being softer than the former 
and harder than the latter. In this snug little cham- 
ber, secure from the intrusion of lady-birds and the 
grubs of aphidivorous flies ( Syrphi ), she brings 
forth her numerous brood of young ones, who imme- 
diately assist in enlarging the extent of their dwelling, 
by puncturing the walls. In one respect, however, 
the galls thus formed ditfer from those of the moun- 
tain-ash just described, — those of the poplar having 
always an opening left into some part of the cell, and 
usually in that portion of it which is elongated into 
an obtuse beak. From this opening the young, when 
arrived at the winged state, make their exit, to form 







new colonies ; and during their migrations, attract 
the attention of the most incurious by the singularity 
of their appearance

Eriosoma popidi , with the various forms of the insects, winged, nut 
winged, and covered with wool. 



On the black poplar there may be found, later in 
the season than the preceding, a gall of a very dif- 
ferent form, though, like the other, it is for the most 
part on the leaf-stalk. The latter sort of galls are 
of a spiral form ; and though they are closed, they 
open upon slight pressure, and appear to be formed 
of two laminae, twisted so as to unite. It is at this

opening that an aperture is formed spontaneously for 
the exit of the insects, when arrived at a perfect state. 
In galls of this kind we find aphides, but of a dif- 
ferent species from the lanigerous ones, which form 
the horn-shaped galls above described.

It may not be improper to introduce here a brief 
sketch of some other effects, of a somewhat similar 
kind, produced on leaves by other species of the 
same family (Aphides). In all the instances of this 
kind which we have examined, the form which the 
leaf takes serves as a protection to the insects, both 
from the weather and from depredators. That there 
is design in it appears from the circumstance of the 
aphides crowding into the embowering vault which 
they have formed ; and we are not quite certain 
whether they do not puncture certain parts of the 
leaf for the very purpose of making it arch over 
them ; at least, in many cases, such as that of the 
hop-fly ( Aphis humuli ), though the insects are in 
countless numbers, no arching of the leaves follows. 
The rose-plant louse, again, ( Aphis roses,) sometimes 
arches the leaves, but more frequently gets under the 
protecting folds of the half-expanded leaf-buds *. 

One of the most common instances of what we 
mean occurs on the leaves of the currant-bush, 
which may often be observed raised up into irregular 
bulgings, of a reddish-brown colour. On examining 
the under side of such a leaf, there will be seen a 
crowd of small insects, some with and some without 
wings, which are the Aphides ribis in their different 
stages, feeding securely and socially on the juices of 
the leaf. 

The most remarkable instance of this, however, 



* J. R. 








I.eaf of the Currant-hush, bulged out by the Aphis ribes. 



which we have seen, occurs on the leaves of the elm, 
and is caused by the u4phis ulmi. The edge of an 
elm-leaf inhabited by those aphides is rolled up in 
an elegant convoluted form, very much like a spiral 
shell ; and in the embowered chamber thus formed, 
the insects are secure from rain, wind, and, partially, 
from the depredations of carnivorous insects. One 
of their greatest enemies, the lady-bird ( Coccinella ), 
seldom ventures, as we have remarked, into con- 
cealed corners, except in cold weather, and contrives 
to find food enough among the aphides which feed 
openly and unprotected, such as the magpie aphides 
of the alder ( Aphides sambuci). The grubs, how- 
ever, of the lady-bird, and also those of the aphidi- 
vorous flies ( Syrphi ), may be found prying into the 
most secret recesses of a leaf, to prey upon the inha- 







bitants, whose slow movements disqualify them from 
effecting- an escape *. 

The effects of the puncture of aphides on growing 
plants is strikingly illustrated in the shoots of the 
lime-tree and several other plants, which become 
bent and contorted on the side attacked by the insects, 
in the same way as the shoot might warp by the loss 
of its juices on the side exposed to a brisk fire. The 
curvings thus effected become very advantageous to 
the insects, for the leaves sprouting from the twig, 
which naturally grow at a distance from each other, 
are brought close together in a bunch, forming a 
kind of nosegay, that conceals all the contour of 
the sprig, as well as the insects which are em- 
bowered under it, protecting them against the rain 
and the sun, and at the same time hiding them 
from observation. It is only requisite, however,

where they have formed bowers of this descrip- 
tion, to raise the leaves, in order to see the little 
colony of the aphides, — or the remains of those

habitations which they have abandoned. We have 
sometimes observed sprig’s of the lime-tree, of a 
thumb’s thickness, portions of which resembled spiral 
screws, but we could not certainly have assigned the 
true cause for this twisting, had we not been ac- 
quainted with the manner in which aphides contort 
the young shoots of this tree*. The shoots of the 
gooseberry and the willow are sometimes contorted 
in the same way, but not so strikingly as the shoots 
of the lime. 

Pseudo-Galls. 

It may not be out of place to mention here certain 
anomalous excrescences upon trees and other plants, 
which, though they much resemble galls, are not so 
distinctly traceable to the operations of any insect. In 
our researches after galls, we have not unfrequently 
met with excrescences which so very much resemble 
them, that before dissection we should not hesitate to

* Reaumur, vol. iii. 





consider them as such, and predict that they formed the 
nidus of some species of insects. In more instances 
than one we have felt so strongly assured of this, that 
we have kept several specimens for some months, in 
nurse-boxes, expecting that in due time the perfect 
insects would be disclosed. 

One of these pseudo-galls occurs on the common 
bramble (Rubus fruticosus), and bears some resem- 
blance to thebedeguarofthe rose when old and changed 
by weather. It clusters round the branches in the form 
of irregular granules, about the size of a pea, very 
much crowded, the whole excrescence being rather 
larger than a walnut. We expected to find this 
excrescence full of grubs, and were much surprised 
to discover, upon dissection, that it was only a dis- 
eased growth of the plant, caused (it might be) by 
the puncture of an insect, but not for the purpose of 
a nidus or habitation*. 

Another sort of excrescence is not uncommon on 
the terminal shoots of the hawthorn. This is in 
general irregularly oblong, and the bark which covers 
it is of an iron colour, similar to the scoriae of a black- 
smith’s forge. When dissected, we find no traces of 
insects, but a hard, ligneous, and rather porous tex- 
ture. It is not improbable that this excrescence may 
originate in the natural growth of a shoot being 
checked by the punctures of aphides, or of those 
grubs which we have described (page 389). 

Many of those excrescences, however, are probably 
altogether unconnected with insects, and are simply 
hypertrophic diseases, produced by too much nourish- 
ment, like the wens produced on animals. Instances 
of this may be seen at the roots of the holyhock 
( Althea rosea) of three or four years’ standing; on 
the stems of the elm and other trees, immediately

above the root ; and on the upper branches of the 
birch, where a crowded cluster of twigs sometimes 
grows, bearing no distant resemblance to a rook’s 
nest in miniature. * - - - 

One of the prettiest of those pseudo-galls with 
which we are acquainted, is produced on the Scotch 
fir ( Pinus sylvestris ), by the aphis pini, which is one 
of the largest species of our indigenous aphides. The 
production we allude to may be found, during the

summer months, on the terminal shoots of this tree, 
in the form of a small cone, much like the fruit of the 
tree in miniature, but with this difference, that the 
fruit terminates in a point, whereas the pseudo-gall 
is nearly globular. Its colour also, instead of being 
green is reddish ; but it exhibits the tiled scales of the 
fruit cone. 

We have mentioned this the more willingly that it 
seems to confirm the theory which we hazarded 
above, respecting the formation of the bedeguar of 
the rose and other true galls — by which we ascribed 
to the sap diverted from its natural course by insects, 
a tendency to form leaves, &c., like those of the plant 
from which it is made to exude. 





The structures which we have hitherto noticed have 
all been formed of inanimate materials, or at the 
most of growing vegetables ; but those to which we 
shall now advert are actually composed of the flesh 
of living animals, and seem to be somewhat akin to 
the galls already described, as formed upon the 
shoots and leaves of plants. These were first inves- 
tigated by the accurate Vallisnieri, and subsequently 
by Reaumur, De Geer, and Linnaeus ; but the best 
account which has hitherto been given of them is by 
our countryman Mr. Bracey Clark, who differs essen- 
tially from his predecessors as to the mode in which 
the eggs are deposited. As in consequence of the ex- 
treme difficulty, if not the impossibility, of personal 
observation, it is no easy matter to decide between the 
conflicting opinions, we shall give such of the state- 
ments as appear most plausible. 

The mother breeze-fly ( Oestrus bovis, Clark ; — 
Hypoderma bovis , Latr.), which produces the tu- 
mours in cattle called wurbles , or wormuls ( quasi , 
worm-holes ), is a two-winged insect, smaller, but 
similar in appearance and colour to the carder-bee 
(p. 64), with two black bands, one crossing the 
shoulders and the other the abdomen, the rest being 

* In order to prevent ambiguity, it is necessary to remark that 
the excrescences thus called must not be confounded with the 
true galls, which are occasionally found in the gall bladder. 





covered with yellow hair. This fly appears to have 
been first discovered by Yallisnieri, who has given a 
curious and interesting history of his observations 
upon its economy. “ After having read this account,” 
says Reaumur, “ with sincere pleasure, I became ex- 
ceedingly desirous of seeing with my own eyes what 
the Italian naturalist had reported in so erudite and 
pleasing a manner. I did not then imagine that it 
would ever be my lot to speak upon a subject which 
had been treated with so much care and elegance ; 
but since I have enjoyed more favourable opportuni- 
ties than M. Vallisnieri, it was not difficult for me to 
investigate some of the circumstances better, and to 
consider them under a different point of view. It is 
not indeed very wonderful to discover something 
new in an object, though it has been already care- 
fully inspected with very good eyes, when we sit 
down to examine it more narrowly, and in a more 
favourable position ; while it sometimes happens, 
also, that most indifferent observers have detected 
what had been previously unnoticed by the most 
skilful interpreters of nature*.” 

From the observations made by Reaumur, he 
concluded that the mother-fly, above described, de- 
posits her eggs in the flesh of the larger animals, for 
which purpose she is furnished with an ovipositor of 
singular mechanism. We have seen that the ovi- 
positors of the gall-flies ( Cynips ) are rolled up within 
the body of the insect somewhat like the spring of a 
watch, so that they can be thrust out to more than 
double their apparent length. To effect the same 
purpose, the ovipositor of the ox-fly lengthens, by 
a series of sliding tubes, precisely like an opera- 
glass. There are four of these tubes, as may be 
seen by pressing the belly of the fly till they come 



* Reaumur, Mem. iv. 505. 






into view. Like other ovipositors of this sort, they 
are composed of a horny substance; but the terminal 
piece is very different indeed from the same part in 
the gall-flies, the tree-hoppers ( Cicada ), and the 
ichneumons, being composed of five points, three of 
which are longer than the other two, and at first 
sight not unlike a JLeur-de-lys , though, upon nar- 
rower inspection, they may be discovered to termi- 
nate in curved points, somewhat like the claw of a 
cat. The two shorter pieces are also pointed, but 
not curved ; and by the union of the five, a tube is 
composed for the passage of the eggs. 




Ovipositor of the brecze-fy, greatly magnified, with a claw and part 
of the tube, distinct. 

It would be necessary, Reaumur confesses, to see 
the fly employ this instrument to understand in what 
manner it acts, though he is disposed to consider it 






fit for boring’ through the hides of cattle. “ When- 
ever I have succeeded,” he adds, “ in seeing these 
insects at work, they have usually shown that they 
proceeded quite differently from what I had imagined ; 
but unfortunately I have never been able to see one 
of them pierce the hide of a cow under my eyes 
Mr. Bracey Clark, taking another view of the 
matter, is decidedly of opinion that the fly does not 
pierce the skin of cattle with its ovipositor at all, but 
merely glues its eggs to the hairs, while the grubs, 
when hatched, eat their way under the skin. If this 
be the fact, as is not improbable, the three curved 
pieces of the ovipositor, instead of acting, as Reaumur 
imagined, like a centre-bit, will only serve to prevent 
the eggs from falling till they are firmly glued to the 
hair, the opening formed by the two shorter points 
permitting this to be effected. This account of the 
matter is rendered more plausible, from Reaumur’s 
statement that the deposition of the egg is not at- 
tended by much pain, unless, as he adds, some 
very sensible nervous fibres have been wounded. 
According to this view, we must not estimate the 
pain produced by the thickness of the instrument ; 
for the sting of a wasp or a bee, although very con- 
siderably smaller than the ovipositor of the ox-fly, 
causes a very pungent pain. It is, in the latter case, 
the poison infused by the sting, rather than the 
wound, which occasions the pain; and Vallisnieri is 
of opinion that the ox-fly emits some acrid matter 
along with her eggs, but there is no proof of this 
beyond conjecture. 

It ought to be remarked, however, that cattle have 
very thick hides, which are so far from being acutely 
sensitive of pain, that in countries where they are put 
to draw ploughs and waggons, they find a whip 



* Mem, iv. 538. 





ineffectual to drive them, and have to use a goad, in 
form of an iron needle, at the end of a stick. Were 
the pain inflicted by the fly very acute, it would find 
it next to impossible to lay thirty or forty eggs without 
being killed by the strokes of the ox’s tail ; for though 
Vallisnieri supposes that the fly is shrewd enough 
to choose such places as the tail cannot reach, Reau- 
mur saw a cow repeatedly flap its tail upon a part 
full of the gall-bumps ; and in another instance he 
saw a heifer beat away a party of common flies from 
a part where there were seven or eight gall-bumps. 
He concludes, therefore, with much plausibility, that 
these two beasts would have treated the ox-flies in 
the same way, if they had given them pain when de- 
positing their eggs. 

The extraordinary effects produced upon cattle, on 
the appearance of one of these flies, would certainly 
lead us to conclude, that the pain inflicted is excru- 
ciating. Most of our readers may recollect to have 
seen, in the summer months, a whole herd of cattle 
start off across a field in full gallop, as if they were 
racing, — their movements indescribably awkward — 
their tails being poked out behind them as straight 
and stiff as a post, and their necks stretched to their 
utmost length. All this consternation has been 
known, from the earliest times, to be produced by the 
fly we are describing. Virgil gives a correct and 
lively picture of it in his Georgies *, of which the fol- 
lowing is a translation, a little varied from Trapp : — 

Round mount Alburnus, green with shady oaks, 

And in the groves of Silarus, there flies

By us Asilus ): fierce with jarring hum

And woods and rivers’ banks echo their lowings. 

Had we not other instances to adduce, of similar 
terror caused among sheep, deer, and horses, by 
insects of the same genus, which are ascertained not 
to penetrate the skin, we should not have hesitated 
to conclude that Vallisnieri and Reaumur are right, 
and Mr. Bracey Clark wrong. In the strictly similar 
instance of Rein-deer fly ( CEstrus tarandi, Linn.), 
we have the high authority of Linnaeus for the fact, 
that it lays its eggs upon the skin. 

“ I remarked,” he says, “ with astonishment how 
greatly the reindeer are incommoded in hot weather, 
insomuch that they cannot stand still a minute, no 
not a moment, without changing their posture, start- 
ing, puffing and blowing continually, and all on 
account of a little fly. Even though amongst a herd 
of perhaps five hundred reindeer there were not 
above ten of those flies, every one of the herd trem- 
bled and kept pushing its neighbour about. The 
fly, meanwhile, was trying every means to get at 
them ; but it no sooner touched any part of their 
bodies, than they made an immediate effort to shake 
it off. I caught one of these insects as it was flying 
along with its tail protruded, which had at its extremity 
a small linear orifice perfectly white. The tail itself 
consisted of four or five tubular joints, slipping into 
each other like a pocket spying-glass, which this fly, 
like others, has a power of contracting at pleasure*.” 

In another work he is still more explicit. “ This 
well-known fly,” he says, “ hovers the whole day 
over the back of the reindeer, with its tail protruded 



* Linuseus, Lachesis Lapponica, July 19th. 







and a little bent, upon the point of which it holds a 
small white egg, scarcely so large as a mustard-seed, 
and when it has placed itself in a perpendicular posi- 
tion, it drops its egg, which rolls down amongst the 
hair to the skin, where it is hatched by the natural 
heat and perspiration of the reindeer, and the grub 
eats its way slowly under the skin, causing a bump 
as large as an acorn*.” The male and female of 
the reindeer breeze-fly are figured in the Library of 
Entertaining Knowledge, Menageries, Yol. I., p. 405. 

There is one circumstance which, though it appears 
to us to be of some importance in the question, has 
been either overlooked or misrepresented in books. 
“ While the female fly,” says Kirby and Spence, “ is 
performing the operation of oviposition, the animal 
attempts to lash her off as it does other flies, with 
its tail t; ” though this is not only at variance with 
their own words in the page but one preceding, 
where they most accurately describe “ the herd with 
their tails in the air, or turned upon their backs, or 
stiffly stretched out in the direction of the spine 
but with the two facts mentioned above from 
Reaumur, as well as with common observation. If 
the ox then do not attempt to lash off the breeze-fly, 
but runs with its tail stiffly extended, it affords a 
strong presumption, that the fly terrifies him by 
her buzzing (asjier, acerba sojiansf rather than 
pains him by piercing his hide ; her buzz, like the 
rattle of the rattle-snake, being instinctively under- 
stood, and intended, it may be, to prevent an over 
population, by rendering it difficult to deposit the 
eggs. 

The horse breeze-fly (G aster ophilus equi, Leach), 
which produces the maggots well known by the name 
of botts in horses, is ascertained beyond a doubt to 

* Linnaeus, Flora Lapponica. P. 378, ed. Lond. 1792. 

•}• Kirby and Spence, Introd. i, 151. + Ibid. p. 149. 







deposit her eggs upon the hair, and as insects of the 
same genus almost invariably proceed upon similar 
principles, however much they may vary in minute 
particulars, it may be inferred with justice, that the 
breeze-flies which produce galls, do the same. The 
description given by Mr. Bracey Clark, of the pro- 
ceedings of the horse breeze-fly, is exceedingly in- 
teresting. 

“ When the female has been impregnated, and her 
eggs sufficiently matured, she seeks among the 
horses a subject for her purpose, and approaching 
him on the wing, she carries her body nearly upright 
in the air, and her tail, which is lengthened for the 
purpose *, curved inwards and upwards : in this way 
she approaches the part where she designs to de- 
posit the egg ; and suspending herself for a few 
seconds before it, suddenly darts upon it and leaves 
the egg adhering to the hair ; she hardly appears to 
settle, but merely touches the hair with the egg held 
out on the 'projected point of the abdomen *. The 
egg is made to adhere by means of a glutinous 
liquor secreted with it. She then leaves the horse 
at a small distance, and prepares a second egg, and 
poising herself before the part, deposits it in the same 
way. The liquor dries, and the egg becomes firmly 
glued to the hair ; this is repeated by these flies till 
four or five hundred eggs are sometimes placed on 
one horse.” 

Mr. Clark farther tells us, that the fly is careful to 
select a part of the skin which the horse can easily 
reach with his tongue, such as the inside of the 
knee, or the side and back part of the shoulder. It 

* The3e circumstances afford, we think, a complete answer to 
the query of Kirby and Spence, — “ There can be little doubt, (or 
else what is the use of such an apparatus ?) that it bores a hole 
in the skin.” — Introd., i. 162, 2nd. edit. 



A



was at first conjectured, that the horse licks off the 
eggs thus deposited, and that they are by this means 
conveyed into its stomach ; but Mr. Clark says, “ I 
do not find this to be the case, or at least only by 
accident ; for when they have remained on the hair 
four or five days, they become ripe, after which time 
the slightest application of warmth and moisture is 
sufficient to bring forth, in an instant, the latent larva. 
At this time, if the tongue of the horse touches the 
egg, its operculum is thrown open, and a small, 
active worm is produced, which readily adheres to 
the moist surface of the tongue, and is thence con- 
veyed with the food to the stomach.” He adds, 
that “ a horse which has no ova deposited on him 
may yet have botts, by performing the friendly office 
of licking another horse that has The irrita- 
tions produced by common flies ( Anthomyice me - 
teorica:, Mf.igen), are alleged as the incitement to 
licking. 

The circumstance, however, of most importance to 
our purpose, is the agitation and terror produced 
both by this fly, and by another horse breeze-fly 
( Gasterophilus hcemorrhoidalis, Leach), which de- 
posits its eggs upon the lips of the horse, as the 
sheep breeze-fly ( CEstrus ovis ) does on that of the 
sheep. The first of these is described by Mr. Clark 
as “ very distressing to the animal, from the excessive 
titillation it occasions ; for he immediately after rubs 
his mouth against the ground, his fore-feet, or some- 
times against a tree, with great emotion ; till finding 
this mode of defence insufficient, he quits the spot in 
a rage, and endeavours to avoid it by galloping away 
to a distant part of the field, and if the fly still con- 
tinues to follow and teaze him, his last resource is in 
the water, where the insect is never observed to pur- 






* Linn. Trans, iii, 305. 






sue him. These flies appear sometimes to hide them- 
selves in the grass, and as the horse stoops to graze 
they dart upon the mouth or lips, and are always 
observed to poise themselves during a few seconds 
in the air, while the egg is preparing on the extended 
'point of the abdomen*.” 

The moment the second fly just mentioned touches 
the nose of a sheep, the animal shakes its head and 
strikes the ground violently with its fore-feet, and at 
the same time holding its nose to the earth, it runs 
away looking about on every side to see if the flies 
pursue. A sheep will also smell the grass as it goes, 
lest a fly should be lying in wait, and if one be de- 
tected, it runs off in terror. As it will not, like a horse 
or an ox, take refuge in the water, it has recourse to a 
rut or dry dusty road, holding its nose close to the 
ground, thus rendering it difficult for the fly to get 
at the nostril. 

When the egg of the ox-breeze fly ( Hypoderma

bovis , Latr.) is hatched, it immediately (if Mr. 
Bracey Clark be correct) burrows into the skin ; 
while, according to Reaumur, it is hatched there. 
At all events, the grub is found in a bump on the 
animal’s back, resembling a gall on a tree, — “ a 
place,” says Reaumur, “ where food is found in 
abundance, where it is protected from the weather, 
where it enjoys at all times an equal degree of 
warmth, and where it finally attains maturity 
When in an advanced stage, the bumps appear much 
like the swellings produced upon the forehead by a 
smart blow. These, with the grubs, are represented 
in the foregoing figure, and also at page 412. 

Every bump, according to Reaumur, has in its 
inside a cavity, which is a lodging proportionate to 
the size of the insect. The bump and cavity also 
increase in proportion to the growth of the grub. It 
is not until about the middle of May that these bumps 
can be seen full grown. Owing to particular cir- 
cumstances, they do not all attain an equal size. The 
largest of them are sixteen or seventeen lines in dia- 
meter at their base, and about an inch high; but they

are scarcely perceptible before the beginning, or dur- 
ing the course of the winter. 

It is commonly upon young cattle, such, namely, 
as are two or three years old, that the greatest num- 
ber of bumps is found ; it being rare to observe them 
upon very old animals. The fly seems to be well 
aware that such skins will not oppose too much re- 
sistance, and seems to know, also, that tender flesh 
is the most proper for supplying good nourishment 
to its progeny. “ And why,” asks Reaumur, “ should 
not the instinct which conducts it to confide its eggs 
to the flesh of certain species only, lead it to prefer 
the flesh of animals of the same species which is most 
preferable ? ” The number of bumps which are found 
upon a beast is equal to the number of eggs which 
have been deposited in its flesh ; or, to speak more 
correctly, to the number of eggs which have suc- 
ceeded, for apparently all are not fertile ; but this 
number is very different upon different cattle. Upon 




Bumps or wurblcs produced on cattle by the Ox-breeze. 







one cow only three or four bumps may be observed, 
while upon another there will appear from thirty to 
forty. They are not always placed on the same parts, 
nor arranged in the same manner : commonly, they 
are near the spine, but sometimes upon or near the 
thighs and shoulders. Sometimes they are at remote 
distances from each other ; at other times they are 
so near that their circumferences meet. In certain 
places, three or four tumours may be seen touching 
each other ; and more than a dozen sometimes occur 
arranged as closely together as possible. 

It is very essential to the grub that the hold of the 
tumour should remain constantly open ; for by this 
aperture a communication with the air necessary for 
respiration is preserved ; and the grub is thence 
placed in the most favourable position for receiving 
air. Its spiracles for respiration, like those of many 
other grubs, are situated immediately upon the pos- 
terior extremity of the body. Now, being almost 
always placed in such a situation as to have this part 
above, or upon a level with the external aperture, it 
is enabled to respire freely *. 

We have not so many examples of galls of this 
kind as we have of vegetable galls ; and when we 
described the surprising varieties of the latter, we did 
not perceive that it was essential to the insects inha- 
biting them to preserve a communication with the 
external air: in the galls of trees, openings expressly 
designed or kept free for the admission of air are 
never observed. Must the grub, then, which inhabits 
the latter have less need of respiring air than the 
grub of the breeze-flies in a flesh gall ? Without 
doubt, not; but the apertures by which the air is 
admitted to the inhabitants of the woody gall, al- 
though they may escape our notice, in consequence 

* Reaumur, n. 549. 





of their minuteness, are not, in fact, less real. We 
know that however careful we may be in inserting 1 a 
cork into a glass, the mercury with which it is tilled 
is not sheltered from the action of the air, which 
weighs upon the cork ; we know that the air passes 
through, and acts upon the mercury in the tube. 
The air can also, in the same way, penetrate through 
the obstruction of a gall of wood, though it have no 
perceptible opening or crack ; but the air cannot pass 
in this manner so readily through the skins and mem- 
branes of animals. 

In order to see the interior of the cavity of an 
animal gall, Reaumur opened several, either with 
a razor or a pair of scissors ; the operation, however, 
cannot fail to be painful to the cow, and consequently 
it renders it impatient under the process. The grub 
being confined in a tolerably large fistulous ulcer, a 
part of the cavity must necessarily be filled with pus 
or matter. The bump is a sort of cautery, which 
has been opened by the insect, as issues are made by 
caustic : the grub occupies this issue, and prevents it 
from closing. If the pus or matter which is in the ca- 
vity, and that which is daily added to it, had no means 
of escaping, each tumour would become a consider- 
able abscess, in which the grub would perish : but the 
hole of the bump, which admits the entrance of the 
air, permits the pus or matter to escape ; that pus 
frequently matts the hairs together which are above 
the small holes, and this drying around the holes, 
acquires a consistency, and forms in the interior of 
the opening a kind of ring. This matter appears to 
be the only aliment allowed for the grub, for there is 
no appearance that it lives, like the grubs of flesh- 
flies, upon putrescent meat. Mandibles, indeed, simi- 
lar to those with which other grubs break their food, 
are altogether wanting. A beast which has thirty, 
forty, or more of these bumps upon its back, would 







be in a condition of great pain and suffering, terrible 
indeed in the extreme, if its flesh were torn and de- 
voured by as many large grubs ; but there is every 
appearance that they do not at all afflict, or only afflict 
it with little pain. For this reason cattle most covered 
with bumps are not considered by the farmer as in- 
jured by the presence of the fly, which generally se- 
lects those in the best condition. 

A fly, evidently of the same family with the pre- 
ceding, is described in Bruce’s Travels, under the 
name of zimb, as burrowing during its grub state in 
the hides of the elephant, the rhinoceros, the camel, 
and cattle. “ It resembles,” he says, “ the gad-fly in 
England, its motion being more sudden and rapid 
than that of a bee. There is something peculiar in the 
sound or buzzing of this insect; it is a jarring noise 
together with a humming, which as soon as it is 
heard, all the cattle forsake their food and run 
wildly about the plain, till they die, worn out with 
fatigue, fright, and hunger. I have found,” he adds, 
“ some of these tubercles upon almost every ele- 
phant and rhinoceros that I have seen, and attribute 
them to this cause. When the camel is attacked by 
this fly, his body, head, and legs, break out into 
large bosses, which swell, break and putrefy, to the 
certain destruction of the creature That camels 
die under such symptoms, we do not doubt ; but we 
should not without more minutely accurate observa- 
tion trace all this to the breeze-fly. 

MM. Humboldt and Bonpland discovered, in 
South America, a species probably of the same 
genus, which attacks man himself. The perfect in- 
sect is about the size of our common house fly, 
(Musca domesticcS), and the bump formed by the 
grub, which is usually on the belly, is similar to that

caused by the ox breeze-fly. It requires six months 
to come to maturity, and if it is irritated it eats 
deeper into the flesh, sometimes causing fatal inflam- 
mations. 

Grub Parasite in the Snail. 

During the summer of 1829, we discovered in the 
hole of a garden-post, at Blackheath, one of the 
larger grey snail shells ( Helix aspersa , Muller), 
with three white soft-bodied grubs, burrowing in the 
body of the snail. They evidently, from their appear- 
ance, belonged to some species of beetle, and we 
carefully preserved them in order to watch their 
economy. It appeared to us that they had attacked 
the snail in its strong hold, while it was laid up tor- 
pid for the winter ; for more than half of the body 
was already devoured. They constructed for them- 
selves little cells attached to the inside of the shell 
and composed of a sort of fibrous matter, having no 
distant resemblance to shag tobacco, both in form 
and smell, and which could be nothing else than the 
remains of the snail’s body. Soon after we took 
them, appearing to have devoured all that remained 
of the poor snail, we furnished them with another, 
which they devoured in the same manner. They 
formed a cocoon of the same fibrous materials during 
the autumn, and in the end of October appeared in 
their perfect form, turning out to be the Drilus fla- 
vescens the grub of which was first discovered in 
France in 1 824. The time of their appearance, it may 
be remarked, coincides with the period when snails 
become torpid*.

The subject of Insect Architecture, to which this 
volume is devoted, forms only one division, though a 
most interesting and important one, of that branch of 
natural history which relates to insects. It presents 
some of the most striking views of their economy ; 
and, as we have endeavoured to render the exam- 
ples of extraordinary instinct with which it abounds 
obvious and familiar to every reader, it precedes 
somewhat naturally a more minute account of the 
physiological part of the science of Entomology, and 
of the benefits and injuries produced to man by in- 
sects, in the respective stages of their existence. The 
present volume is complete in itself ; and we hope 
that few will peruse it without having their attention 
awakened, and their curiosity gratified. It is in- 
tended, however, to follow it up by a second volume, 
to be entitled Insect Transformations. The same 
mode of illustration will be adopted in this projected 
work as in the present volume ; and it is expected 
that the two will form a tolerably complete view, for 
all popular objects, of the Natural History of Insects.
