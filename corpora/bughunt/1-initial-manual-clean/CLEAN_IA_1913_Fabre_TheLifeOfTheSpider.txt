honour to a man whose brow deserves to be girt with a double and ra diant crown but fame  at least that which is not the true nor the great fame but her il legitimate sister and which creates more noise than durable work in the morning and even ing papers  fame is often forgetful negli gent behindhand or unjust and the crowd is almost ignorant of the name of j h fabre who is one of the most profound and inven tive scholars and also one of the purest writers and i was going to add one of the finest poets of the century that is just past maillane is the birthplace of mistral the proven poettranslators note j h fabre as some few people know is the author of half a score of wellfilled vol umes in which under the title of souvenirs entomologiques he has set down the results of fifty years of observation study and exper iment on the insects that seem to us the best known and the most familiar different species of wasps and wild bees a few gnats flies beetles and caterpillars in a word all those vague unconscious rudimentary and almost nameless little lives which surround us on every side and which we contemplate with eyes that are amused but already thinking of other things when we open our window to welcome the first hours of spring or when we go into the gardens or the fields to bask in the blue summer zy we take up at random one of these bulky volumes and naturally expect to find first of all the very learned and rather dry lists of names the very fastidious and exceedingly quaint specifications of those huge dusty graveyards of which all the entomological treatises that we have read so far seem almost wholly to consist we therefore open the book without zest and without unreasonable expectations and forthwith from between the open leaves there rises and unfolds itself without hesitation without interruption and almost without remission to the end of the four thousand pages the most extraordinary of tragic fairy plays that it is possible for the human imagination not to create or to con ceive but to admit and to acclimatize within itself indeed there is no question here of the human imagination the insect does not be long to our world the other animals the plants even notwithstanding their dumb life and the great secrets which they cherish do not seem wholly foreign to us in spite of all wc feel a certain earthly brotherhood in them they often surprise and amaze our intelligence but do not utterly upset it there is something on the other hand about the insect that does not seem to belong to the habits the ethics the psychology of our globe one would be inclined to say that the insect comes from another planet more mon strous more energetic more insane more atrocious more infernal than our own one would think that it was born of some comet that had lost its course and died demented in space in vain does it seize upon life with an authority a fecundity unequalled here below we cannot accustom ourselves to the idea that it is a thought of that nature of whom we fondly believe ourselves to be the privileged children and probably the ideal to which all the earths efforts tend only the infinitely small disconcerts us still more greatly but what in reality is the infinitely small other than an insect which our eyes do not see there is no doubt in this astonishment and lack of understanding a certain instinctive and profound uneasiness inspired by those existences incomparably betterarmed better equipped than our own by those creatures made up of a sort of compressed energy and activity in whom we suspect our most myste rious adversaries our ultimate rivals and perhaps our successors but it is time under the conduct of an ad mirable guide to penetrate behind the scenes of our fairy play and to study at close quarters the actors and supemumerariesi loathsome or magnificent as the case may be grotesque or sinister heroic or appalling genial or stupid and almost always improbable and unintel ligible and here to begin with taking the first that comes is one of those individuals fre quent in the south where we can see it prowl ing around the abundant manna which the mule scatters heedlessly along the white roads and the stony paths i mean the sacred scarab of the egyptians or more simply the dungbeetle the brother of our northern geotrupes a big coleopteron all clad in black whose mission in this world is to shape the more savoury parts of the prize into an enormous ball which he must next roll to the subterranean diningroom where the incred ible digestive adventure is to take its course but destiny jealous of all undiluted bliss be fore admitting him to that spot of sheer delight imposes upon the grave and probably sententious beetle tribulations without num ber which are nearly always complicated by the arrival of an untoward parasite hardly has he begun by dint of great ef forts of his frontal shield and bandy legs to roll the toothsome sphere backwards when an indelicate colleague who has been awaiting the completion of the work appears and hypo critically offers his services the other well knows that in this case help and services besides being quite unnecessary will soon mean partition and dispossession and he ac cepts the enforced collaboration without en thusiasm but so that their respective rights may be clearly marked the legal owner in variably retains his original place that is to say he pushes the ball with his forehead whereas the compulsory guest on the other side pulls it towards him and thus it jogs along between the two gossips amid inter minable vicissitudes flurried falls grotesque tumbles till it reaches the place chosen to receive the treasure and to become the ban quetinghall on arriving the owner sets about diggng out the refectory while the sponger pretends to go innocently to sleep on the top of the bolus the excavation be comes visibly wider and deeper and soon the first dungbeetle dives bodily into it this is the moment for which the cunning aux iliary was waiting he nimbly scrambles down from the blissful eminence and push ing it with all the energy that a bad con science gives strives to gain the offing but the other who is rather distrustful inter rupts his laborious excavations looks over board sees the sacrilegious rape and leaps out of the hole caught in the act the shame less and dishonest partner makes untold ef forts to play upon the others credulity turns round and round the inestimable orb and embracing it and propping himself against it with fraudulent heroic exertions pretends to be frantically supporting it on a nonexistent slope the two expostulate with each other in silence gesticulate wildly with their mandibles and tarsi and then with one accord bring back the ball to the burrow it is pronounced sufficiently spacious and comfortable they introduce the treasure they close the entrance to the corridor and now in the propitious darkness and the warm damp where the magnificent stercoral globe alone holds sway the two reconciled mess mates sit down face to face then far from the light and the cares of day and in the great silence of the hypogeous shade solemnly commences the most fabulous ban quet whereof abdominal imagination ever evoked the absolute beatitudes for two whole months they remain clois tered and with their paunches proportion ately hollowing out the inexhaustible sphere definite archetypes and sovereign symbols of the pleasures of the table and the gaiety of the belly they eat without stopping without interrupting themselves for a second day or night and while they gorge steadily with a movement perceptible and constant as that of a clock at the rate of three millimetres a minute an endless unbroken ribbon unwinds and stretches itself behind them fixing the memory and recording the hours days and weeks of the prodigious feast after the dungbeetle that dolt of the company let us greet also in the order of the coleoptera the model household of the min otaurus typhaus which is pretty wellknown and extremely gentle in spite of its dreadful name the female digs a huge burrow which is often more than a yard and a half deep and which consists of spiral staircases landings passages and numerous chambers ihe male loads the earth on the three pronged fork that surmounts his head and carries it to the entrance of the conjugal dwelling next he goes into the fields in search of the harmless droppings left by the sheep takes them down to the first storey of the crypt and reduces them to flour with his trident while the mother right at the bottom collects the flour and kneads it into huge cylin drical loaves which will presently be food for the little ones for three months until the provisions are deemed sufficient the unfortu nate husband without taking nourishment of any kind exhausts himself in this gigantic woric at last his task accomplished feeling his end at hand so as not to encumber the house with his wretched remains he spends his last strength in leaving the burrow drags himself laboriously along and lonely and re signed knowing that he is henceforth good for nothing goes and dies far away among the stones here on another side are some rather strange caterpillars the processionaries which are not rare and as it happens a single string of them five or six yards long has just climbed down from my umbrella is pines and is at this moment unfolding itself in the walks of my garden carpeting the ground traversed with transparent silk ac cording to the custom of the race to say nothing of the meteorological apparatus of unparalleled delicacy which they carry on their backs these caterpillars as everybody knows have this remarkable quality that they travel only in a troop one after the other like breughels blind men or those of the parable each of them obstinately indissolubly follow ing its leader so much so that our author having one morning disposed the file on the edge of a large stone vase thus closing the circuit for seven whole days during an atro cious week amidst cold hunger and un speakable weariness the unhappy troop on its tragic round without rest respite or mercy pursued the pitiless circle until death overtook it but i see that our heroes are infinitely too numerous and that we must not linger over our descriptions we may at most in enu merating the more important and familiar bestow on each of them a hurried epithet in the manner of old homer shall i mention for instance the leucospis a parasite of the masonbee who to slay his brothers and sisters in their cradle arms himself with a horn helmet and a barbed breastplate which he doffs immediately after the extermination the safeguard of a hideous right of primo geniture shall i tell of the marvellous anatomical knowledge of the tachytes of the cerceris of the ammophila of the lan guedocian sphex who according as they wish to paralyze or to kill their prey or their adversary know exactly without ever blunder ing which nervecentre to strike with their sting or their mandibles shall i speak of the art of the eumenes who transforms her stronghold into a complete museum adorned with shells and grains of translucent quartz of the magnificent metamorphosis of the pachytilus cinarescens of the musical in strument owned by the cricket whose bow numbers one hundred and fifty triangular prisms that set in motion simultaneously the four dulcimers of the elytron shall i sing the fairylike birth of the nymphs of the anthophagus a transparent monster with a buifs snout that seems carved out of a block of crystal would you behold the fleshfly the common bluebottle daughter of the mag got as she issues from the earth listen to our author she disjoints her head into two movable halves which each distended with its great red eye by turns separate and reunite in the intervening space a large glassy hernia rises and disappears disappears and rises when the two halves move asunder with one eye forced back to the right and the other to the left it is as though the insect were split ting its brainpan in order to expel the con tents then the hernia rises blunt at the end and swollen into a great knob next the forehead closes and the hernia retreats leav ing visible only a kind of shapeless muzzle in short a frontal pouch with deep pulsations momentarily renewed becomes the instru ment of deliverance the pestle wherewith the newlyhatched dipteron bruises the sand and causes it to crumble gradually the legs push the rubbish back and the insect advances so much towards the surface and monster after monster passes such as the imagination of bosch or callot never conceived the larva of the rosechafer which though it have legs under its belly always travels on its back the bluewinged locust unluckier still than the fleshfly and possessing nothing wherewith to perforate the soil to escape from the tomb and reach the light but a cervical bladder a viscous blister and the empusa who with her curved ab domen her great projecting eyes her legs with kneepieces armed with cleavers her hal berd her abnormally tall mitre would cer tainly be the most devilish goblin that ever walked the earth if beside her the praying mantis were not so frightful that her mere aspect deprives her victims of their power of movement when she assumes in front of them what the entomologists have termed the spectral attitude one cannot mention even casually the numberless industries  nearly all of absorb ing interest  exercised among the rocks un der the ground in the walls on the branches the grass the flowers the fruits and down to the very bodies of the subjects studied for we sometimes find a treble superposition of parasites as in the oilbeetles and we see the maggot itself the sinister guest at the last feast of all feed some thirty brigands with its substance among the hymenoptera which represent the most intellectual class in the world which we are studying the buildingtalents of our wonderful domestic bee are certainly equal in other orders of architecture by those of more than one wild and solitary bee and not ably by the megachile or leafcutter a lit tle insect which is not all outside show and which to house its eggs manufactures honey pots formed of a multitude of disks and el lipses cut with mathematical precision from the leaves of certain trees for lack of space i am unable to my great regret to quote the beautiful and pellucid pages which j h fabre with his usual conscientiousness de votes to the exhaustive study of this admirable work nevertheless since the occasion offers let us listen to his own words though it be but for a moment and in regard to a single detail with the oval pieces the question changes what model has the megachile when cut ting into fine ellipses the delicate material of the robinia what ideal pattern guides her scissors what measure dictates the dimen sions one would like to think of the insect as a living compass capable of tracing an elliptic curve by a certain natural inflexion of the body even as our arm traces a circle by swinging from the shoulder a blind mech anism the mere outcome of her organiza tion would in that case be responsible for her geometry this explanation would tempt me if the oval pieces of large dimensions were not accompanied by much smaller but likewise oval pieces to fill the empty spaces a compass which changes its radius of itself and alters the degree of curvature according to the exigencies of a plan appears to me an instrument somewhat difficult to believe in there must be something better than that the circular pieces of the lid suggest it to us if by the mere flexion inherent in her structure the leafcutter succeeds in cutting out ovals how does she manage to cut out rounds can we admit the presence of other wheels in the machinery for the new pattern so different in shape and size however the real point of the difficulty does not lie there those rounds for the most part fit the mouth of the bottle with almost exact preci sion when the cell is finished the bee flies hundreds of yards further to make the lid she arrives at the leaf from which the disk is to be cut what picture what recollection has she of the pot to be covered why none at all she has never seen it she works underground in profound darkness at the utmost she can have the indications of touch not actual indications of course for the pot is not there but past indications ineffective in a work of precision and yet the disk must be of a fixed diameter if it were too large it would not fit in if too small it would close badly it would smother the egg by sliding down on the honey how shall it be given its correct dimensions without a pattern the bee does not hesitate for a moment she cuts out her disk with the same rapidity which she would display in detach ing any shapeless lobe just useful for closing and that disk without further measurement is of the right size to fit the pot let whoso will explain this geometry which in my opinion is inexplicable even when we allow for memory begotten of touch and sight let us add that the author has calculated that to form the cells of a kindred mega chile the silky megachile exactly of these ellipses and disks would be required and they must all be collected and shaped in the course of an existence that lasts a few weeks who would imagine that the pentatomida on the other hand the poor and evilsmelling bug of the woods has invented a really ex traordinary apparatus wherewith to leave the egg and first let us state that this egg is a marvellous little box of snowy whiteness which our author thus describes the microscope discovers a surface en graved with dents similar to those of a thimble and arranged with exquisite sym metry at the top and bottom of the cylin dcr is a wide belt of a dead black on the sides a large white zone with four big black spots evenly distributed the lid surrounded by snowy cilia and encircled with white at the edge swells into a black cap with a white knot in the centre altogether a dismal burial urn with the sudden contrast between the dead black and the fleecy white the funeral pottery of the ancient etruscans would have found a magnificent model here the little bug whose forehead is too soft covers her head to raise the lid of the box with a mitre formed of three triangular rods which is always at the bottom of the egg at the moment of delivery her limbs being sheathed like those of a mummy she has nothing wherewith to put her tringles in motion except the pulsations produced by the rhythmic flow of blood in her skull and act ing after the manner of a piston the rivets of the lid gradually give way and as soon as the insect is free she lays aside her mechanical helmet another species of bug the reduvius per sonatus which lives mostly in lumberrooms where it lies hidden in the dust has invented a still more astonishing system of hatching here the lid of the egg is not riveted as m the case of the pentatomidae but simply glued at the moment of liberation the lid rises and we see a spherical vesicle emerge from the shell and gradually expand like a soap bubble blown through a straw driven further and further back by the extension of this bladder the lid falls then the bomb bursts in other words the blister swollen beyond its capacity of resistance rips at the top this envelope which is an extremely tenuous membrane generally remains clinging to the edge of the orifice where it forms a high white rim at other times the explosion loosens it and flings it outside the shell in those con ditions it is a dainty cup half spherical with torn edges lengthened out below into a deli cate winding stalk now how is this miraculous explosion pro duced j h fabre assumes that very slowly as the little animal takes shape and grows this bladdershaped reser voir receives the products of the work of respiration performed under the cover of the outer membrane instead of being expelled through the eggshell the carbonic acid the incessant result of the vital oxidization is accumulated in this sort of gasometer inflates and distends it and presses upon the lid when the insect is ripe for hatching a super added activity in the respiration completes the inflation which perhaps has been prepar ing since the first evolution of the germ at last yielding to the increasing pressure of the gaseous bladder the lid becomes unsealed the chick in its shell has its airchamber the young reduvius has its bomb of carbonic acid it frees itself in the act of breathing one would never weary of dipping eagerly into these inexhaustible treasures we im agine for instance that from seeing cob webs so frequently displayed in all manner of places we possess adequate notions of the genius and methods of our familiar spiders far from it the realities of scientific obser vation call for an entire volume crammed with revelations of which we had no concep tion i will simply name at random the symmetrical arches of the clotho spiders nest the astonishing funicular flight of the young of our garden spider the divingbell of the water spider the live telephonewire which connects the web with the leg of the cross spider hidden in her parlour and in forms her whether the vibration of her toils is due to the capture of a prey or a caprice of the wind it is impossible therefore short of having unlimited space at ones disposal to do more than touch as it were with the tip of the phrases upoa the miracles of maternal in stinct which moreover are confounded with those of the higher manufactures and form the bright centre of the insects psychology one would in the samie way require several chapters to convey a summary idea of the nuptial rites which constitute the quaintest and most fabulous episodes of these new arabian nights the male of the spanishfly for instance begins by frenziedly beating his spouse with his abdomen and his feet after which with his arms crossed and quivering he remains long in ecstasy the newlywedded osmiae clap their mandibles terribly as though it were a matter rather of devouring each other on the other hand the largest of our moths the great peacock who is the size of a bat when drunk with love finds his mouth so completely atrophied that it becomes no more than a vague shadow but nothing equals the marriage of the green grasshop per of which i cannot speak here for it is doubtful whether even the latin language possesses the words needed to describe it as it should be described all said the marriage customs are dread ful and contrary to that which happens in every other world here it is the female of the pair that stands for strength and intelli gence and also for cruelty and tyranny which appear to be their inevitable consequence almost every wedding ends in the violent and immediate death of the husband often the bride begins by eating a certain number of suitors the archetype of these fantastic unions could be supplied by the languedo cian scorpions who as we know carry lobsterclaws and a long tail supplied with a sting the prick of which is eictremcly dan gerous they have a prelude to the festival in the shape of a sentimental stroll claw in claw then motionless with fingers still gripped they contemplate each other bliss fully interminably day and night pass over their ecstasy while they remain face to face petrified with admiration next the foreheads come together and touch the mouths  if we can give the name of mouth to the monstrous orifice that opens between the claws  are joined in a sort of kiss after which the union is accomplished the male is transfixed with a mortal sting and the ter rible spouse crunches and gobbles him up with gusto but the mantis the ecstatic insect with the arms always raised in an attitude of supreme invocation the horrible mantis religiosa or praying mantis does better still she eats her husbands for the insatiable creature sometimes consumes seven or eight in succes sion while they strain her passionately to their heart her inconceivable kisses devour not metaphorically but in an appallingly real fashion the illfated choice of her soul or her stomach she begins with the head goes down to the thorax nor stops till she comes to the hindlegs which she deems too tough she then pushes away the unfortu nate remains while a new lover who was quietly awaiting the end of the monstrous banquet heroically steps forward to undergo the same fate j h fabre is indeed the revealer of this new world for strange as the admission may seem at a time when we think that we know all that surrounds us most of those insects mi nutely described in the vocabularies learnedly classified and barbarously christened had hardly ever been observed in real life or thor oughly investigated in all the phases of their brief and evasive appearances he has devoted to surprising their little secrets which are the reverse of our greatest mysteries fifty years of a solitary existence misunderstood poor often very near to penury but lit up every day by the joy which a truth brings which is the greatest of all human joys petty truths i shall be told those presented by the habits of a spider or a grasshopper there are no petty truths today there is but one truth whose lookingglass to our uncertain eyes seems broken though its every fragment whether reflecting the evolution of a planet or the flight of a bee contains the supreme law and these truths thus discovered had the good fortune to be grasped by a mind which knew how to understand what they them selves can but ambiguously express to inter pret what they are obliged to conceal and at the same time to appreciate the shimmering beauty almost invisible to the majority of mankind that shines for a moment around all that exists especially around that which still remains very close to nature and has hardly left its primeval obscurity to make of these long annals the generous and delightful masterpiece that they are and not the monotonous and arid register of little descriptions and insignificant acts that they might have been various and so to speak conflicting gifts were needed to the patience the precision the scientific minute ness the protean and practical ingenuity the energy of a darwin in the face of the un known to the faculty of expressing what has to be expressed with order clearness and cer tainty the venerable anchorite of scrignan adds many of those qualities which are not to be acquired certain of those innate good poetic virtues which cause his sure and supple prose devoid of artificial ornament and yet adorned with simple and as it were uninten tional charm to take its place among the ex cellent and lasting prose of the day prose of the kind that has its own atmosphere in which we breathe gratefully and tranquilly and which we find only around masterpieces lastly there was needed  and this was not the least requirement of the work  a mind ever ready to cope with the riddles which among those little objects rise up at every step as enormous as those which fill the skies and perhaps more numerous more im perious and more strange as though nature had here given a freer scope to her last wishes and an easier outlet to her secret thoughts he shrinks from none of those boundless problems which are persistently put to us by all the inhabitants of that tiny world where mysteries are heaped up in a denser and more bewildering fashion than in any other he thus meets and faces turn by turn the re doubtable questions of instinct and intelli gence of the origin of species of the harmony or the accidents of the universe of the life lavished upon the abysses of death without counting the no less vast but so to speak more human problems which among infinite others are inscribed within the range if not within the grasp of our intelligence parthenogenesis the prodigious geometry of the wasps and bees the logarithmic spiral of the snail the antennary sense the miracu lous force which in absolute isolation with out the possible introduction of anything from the outside increases the volume of the minotaurus egg tenfold where it lies and during seven to nine months nourishes with an invisible and spiritual food not the leth argy but the active life of the scorpion and of the young of the lycosa and the clotho spider he does not attempt to explain them by one of those generallyacceptable theories such as that of evolution which merely shifts the ground of the difficulty and which i may mention in passing emerges from these volumes in a somewhat sorry plight after being sharply confronted with incontestable facts waiting for chance or a god to enlighten us he is able in the presence of the un known to preserve that great religious and attentive silence which is dominant in the best minds of the day there are those who say now that you have reaped a plentiful harvest of details you should follow up an alysis with synthesis and generalize the origin of instinct in an allembracing view to these he replies with the humble and magnificent loyalty that illumines all his work because i have stirred a few grains of sand on the shore am i in a position to know the depths of the ocean life has unfathomable secrets human knowledge will be erased from the archives of the world before we possess the last word that the gnat has to say to us success is for the loud talkers the self convinced dogmatists everything is admitted on condition that it be noisily proclaimed let us throw off this sham and recognize that in reality we know nothing about anything if things were probed to the bottom scien tifically nature is a riddle without a definite solution to satisfy mans curiosity hypoth esis follows on hypothesis the theoretical rubbishheap accumulates and truth ever eludes us to know how not to know might well be the last word of wisdom evidently this is hoping too little in the frightful pit in the bottomless funnel where in whirl all those contradictory facts which are resolved in obscurity we know just as much as our cavedwelling ancestors but at least we know that we do not know we survey the dark faces of all the riddles we try to estimate their number to classify their varying degrees of dimness to obtain an idea of their places and extent that already is something pending the day of the first gleams of light in any case it means doing in the presence of the mysteries all that the most upright intelligence can do today and that is what the author of this incomparable iliad does with more confidence than he professes he gazes at them attentively he wears out his life in surprising their most minute se crets he prepares for them in his thoughts and in ours the field necessary for their evo lutions he increases the consciousness of his ignorance in proportion to their importance and learns to understand more and more that they are incomprehsible maurice maeterlinick the following essays have been selected from the ten volumes composing the souvenirs entomologiques although a good deal of henri fabres masterpiece has been published in english none of the articles treating of spiders has been issued before with the excep tion of that forming chapter ii of the pres ent volume the banded epeira which first appeared in the english review the rest are new to england and america the fabre books already published are insect life translated by the author of made moiselle mori macmillan co the life and love of the insect translated by myself macmillan co and social life in the insect world translated by mr bernard miall century co refer ences to the above volumes will be found whenever necessary in the footnotes to the present edition for the rest i have tried not to overburden my version with notes and in view of this i have as far as possible simplified the scien tific terms that occur in the text in so doing i know that i have but followed the wishes of the author who never wearies of protest ing against the barbarous terminology fa voured by his brothernaturalists the mat ter became even more urgent in english than in any of the latin languages and i readily agreed when it was pointed out to me that in a work essentially intended for general read ing there was no purpose in speaking of a coleopteron when the word beetle was to hand in cases where an insect had inevitably to be mentioned by its greek or latin name a note is given explaining in the fewest words the nature of the insect in question i have to thank my friend m maurice maeterlinck for the stately preface which he has contributed to this volume and mr mar maduke langdale and miss frances rodwell for the generous assistance which they have given me in the details of my work and i am also greatly indebted to mr w s graff baker for his invaluable help with the mathe matical difficulties that confronted me in the translation of the appendix alexander teixeira de mattos chelsea id october the spider has a bad name to most of us she represents an odious noxious ani mal which every one hastens to crush under foot against this summary verdict the ob server sets the beasts industry its talent as a weaver its wiliness in the chase its tragic nup tials and other characteristics of great inter est yes the spider is well worth studying apart from any scientific reasons but she is said to be poisonous and that is her crime and the primary cause of the repugnance where with she inspires us poisonous i agree if by that we understand that the animal is armed with two fangs which cause the immediate death of the little victims which it catches but there is a wide difference between killing a midge and harming a man however imme diate in its effects upon the insect entangled in the fatal web the spiders poison is not serious for us and causes less inconvenience than a gnatbite that at least is what we can safely say as regards the great majority of the spiders of our regions nevertheless a few are to be feared and foremost among these is the malmignatte the terror of the corsican peasantry i have seen her settle in the furrows lay out her web and rush boldly at insects larger than herself i have admired her garb of black velvet spec kled with carminered above all i have heard most disquieting stories told about her around ajaccio and bonifacio her bite is re puted very dangerous sometimes mortal the countryman declares this for a fact and the doctor does not always dare deny it in the neighbourhood of pujaud nor far from avig non the harvesters speak with dread of theridion lugubre first observed by leon dufour in the catalonian mountains accord ing to them her bite would lead to serious ac cidents the italians have bestowed a bad reputation on the tarantula who produces convulsions and frenzied dances in the person stung by her to cope with tarantism the name given to the disease that follows on the bite of the italian spider you must have re course to music the only efficacious remedy a small or moderates spider found among foliage  translators note so they tell us special tunes have been noted those quickest to afford relief there is medi cal choreography medical music and have we not the tarantella a lively and nimble dance bequeathed to us perhaps by the heal ing art of the calabrian peasant must we take these queer things seriously or laugh at them from the little that i have seen i hesitate to pronounce an opinion nothing tells us that the bite of the taran tula may not provoke in weak and very im pressionable people a nervous disorder which music will relieve nothing tells us that a pro fuse perspiration resulting from a very ener getic dance is not likely to diminish the dis comfort by diminishing the cause of the ail ment so far from laughing i reflect and en quire when the calabrian peasant talks to me of his tarantula the pujaud reaper of his theridion lugubre the corsican husbandman of his malmignatte those spiders might easily deserve at least partly their terrible reputation the most powerful spider in my district the blackbellied tarantula will presently give us something to think about in this con nection it is not my business to discuss a medical point i interest myself especially in matters of instinct but as the poison fangs play a leading part in the huntresss man oeuvres of war i shall speak of their effects by the way the habits of the tarantula her ambushes her artifices her methods of killing her prey these constitute my subject i will preface it with an account by leon dufour one of those accounts in which i used to de light and which did much to bring me into closer touch with the insect the wizard of the landes tells us of the ordinary taran tula that of the calabrias observed by him in spain lycosa tarantula by preference inhabits open places dry arid uncultivated places exposed to the sun she lives generally  at least when fullgrown  in underground pas sages regular burrows which she digs for herself these burrows are cylindrical they are often an inch in diameter and run into the ground to a depth of more than a foot but they are not perpendicular the inhabitant of this gut proves that she is at the same l on dufour was an army surgeon who served with distinction in several campaigns and subse quently practised as a doctor in the landes he attained great eminence as a naturalist  translators note time a skilful hunter and n able engineer it was a question for her not only of con structing a deep retreat that could hide her from the pursuit of her foes she also had to set up her observatory whence to watch for her prey and dart out upon it the taran tula provides for every contingency the underground passage in fact begins by being vertical but at four or five inches from the surface it bends at an obtuse angle forms a horizontal turning and then becomes perpen dicular once more it is at the elbow of this tunnel that the tarantula posts herself as a vigilant sentry and does not for a moment lose sight of the door of her dwelling it was there that at the period when i was hunting her i used to see those eyes gleaming like diamonds bright as a cats eyes in the dark the outer orifice of the tarantulas bur row is usually surmounted by a shaft con structed throughout by herself it is a gen uine work of architecture standing as much as an inch above the ground and sometimes two inches in diameter so that it is wider than the burrow itself this last circum stance which seems to have been calculated by the industrious spider lends itself admir ably to the necessary extension of the legs at the moment when the prey is to be se the shaft is composed mainly of bits of dry wood joined by a little clay and so artistically laid one above the other that they form the scaffolding of a straight column the inside of which is a hollow cylinder the solidity of this tubular building of this outwork is ensured above all by the fact that it is lined upholstered within with a texture woven by the lycosas spinnerets and continued throughout the interior of the burrow it is easy to imagine how useful this cleverly manufactured lining must be for preventing landslip or warping for maintaining clean liness and for helping her claws to scale the fortress i hinted that this outwork of the burrow was not there invariably as a matter of fact i have often come across tarantulas holes without a trace of it perhaps because it had been accidentally destroyed by the weather or because the lycosa may not al the tarantula is a lycosa or wolf spider fabres tarantula the blackbellied tarantula is identical with the narbonne lycosa under which name the description is continued in chapters iii to vi all of which were written at a considerably later date than the present chapter  translators note ways light upon the proper buildingmaterials or lastly because architectural talent is pos sibly declared only in individuals that have reached the final stage the period of per fection of their physical and intellectual development one thing is certain that i have had numerous opportunities of seeing these shafts these outworks of the tarantulas abode they remind me on a larger scale of the tubes of certain caddisworms the arachnid had more than one object in view in constructing them she shelters her retreat from the floods she protects it from the fall of foreign bodies which swept by the wind might end by ob structing it lastly she uses it as a snare by offering the flies and other insects whereon she feeds a projecting point to settle on who shall tell us all the wiles employed by this clever and daring huntress let us now say something about my rather diverting tarantulahunts the best season for them is the months of may and june the first time that i lighted on this spiders burrows and discovered that they were inhabited by seeing her come to a point on the first floor of her dwelling  the elbow which i have mentioned  i thought that i must attack her by main force and pursue her relentlessly in order to capture her i spent whole hours in opening up the trench with a knife a foot long by two inches wide with out meeting the tarantula i renewed the operation in other burrows always with the same want of success i really wanted a pick axe to achieve my object but i was too far from any kind of house i was obliged to change my plan of attack and i resorted to craft necessity they say is the mother of invention it occurred to me to take a stalk topped with its spikelet by way of a bait and to rub and move it gently at the orifice of the burrow i soon saw that the lycosas at tention and desires were roused attracted by the bait she came with measured steps towards the spikelet i withdrew it in good time a little outside the hole so as not to leave the animal time for reflexion and the spider suddenly with a rush darted out of her dwelling of which i hastened to close the entrance the tarantula bewildered by her unaccustomed liberty was very awkward in evading my attempts at capture and i com pelled her to enter a paper bag which i closed without delay sometimes suspecting the trap or per haps less pressed by hunger she would remain coy and motionless at a slight distance from the threshold which she did not think it oppor tune to cross her patience outlasted mine in that case i employed the following tac tics after making sure of the lycosas posi tion and the direction of the tunnel i drove a knife into it on the slant so as to take the animal in the rear and cut off its retreat by stopping up the burrow i seldom failed in my attempt especially in soil that was not stony in these critical circumstances either the tarantula took fright and deserted her lair for the open or else she stubbornly re mained with her back to the blade i would then give a sudden jerk to the knife which flung both the earth and the lycosa to a distance enabling me to capture her by employing this huntingmethod i sometimes caught as many as fifteen tarantulas within the space of an hour in a few cases in which the tarantula was under no misapprehension as to the trap which i was setting for her i was not a lit tie surprised when i pushed the stalk far enough down to twist it round her hiding place to sec her play with the spikelet more or less contemptuously and push it away with her legs without troubling to retreat to the back of her lair the apulian peasants according to baglivis account also hunt the tarantula by imitating the humming of an insect with an oatstalk at the entrance to her burrow i quote the passage ruricola nostri quando eas captare vo lunt ad illorum latibula accedunt tenuisque avenacea fistula sonum apum murmuri non absimilem modulantur quo audito ferox exit tarentula ut muscas vel alia hujus modi insecta quorum murmur esse putat capiat captatur tamen ista a rustico insidiatore the tarantula so dreadful at first sight especially when we are filled with the idea giorgio baglivi professor of anatomy and medicine at rome  translators note when our husbandmen wish to catch them they ap proach their hidingplaces and play on a thin grass pipe makinff a sound not unlike the humming of bees hear ing which the tarantula rushes out fiercely that she may catch the flies or other insects of this kmd whose buzzing she thinks it to be but she herself is caught by her rustic trapper that her bite is dangerous so fierce in appear ance is nevertheless quite easy to tame as i have often found by experiment n the th of may while at va lencia in spain i caught a fairs male tarantula without hurting him and im prisoned him in a glass jar with a paper cover in which i cut a trapdoor at the bottom of the jar i put a paper bag to serve as his habitual residence i placed the jar on a table in my bedroom so as to have him under frequent observation he soon grew accus tomed to captivity and ended by becoming so familiar that he would come and take from my fingers the live fly which i gave him after killing his victim with the fangs of his mandibles he was not satisfied like most spiders to suck her head he chewed her whole body shoving it piecemeal into his mouth with his palpi after which he threw up the masticated teguments and swept them away from his lodging having finished his meal he nearly al ways made his toilet which consisted in brushing his palpi and mandibles both inside and out with his front tarsi after that he resumed his air of motionless gravity the evening and the night were his time for tak ing his walks abroad i often heard him scratching the paper of the bag these habits confirm the opinion which i have already expressed elsewhere that most spiders have the faculty of seeing by day and night like cats n the th of june my tarantula cast his skin it was his last moult and did not perceptibly alter either the colour of his at tire or the dimensions of his body on the th of july i had to leave valencia and i stayed away until the d during this time the tarantula fasted i found him look ing quite well on my return on the th of august i again left for a nine days absence which my prisoner bore without food and without detriment to his health on the ist of october i once more deserted the taran tula leaving him without provisions on the st i was fifty miles from valencia and as i intended to remain there i sent a servant to fetch him i was sorry to learn that he was not found in the jar and i never heard what became of him i will end my observations on the taran tulas with a short description of a curious fight between those animals one day when i had had a successful hunt after these lycosae i picked out two fullgrown and very powerful males and brought them to gether in a wide jar in order to enjoy the sight of a combat to the death after walk ing round the arena several times to try and avoid each other they were not slow in placing themselves in a warlike attitude as though at a given signal i saw them to my surprise take their distances and sit up en solemnly on their hindlegs so as mutually to £ present the shield of their chests to each q other after watching them face to face like a that for two minutes during which they had jj doubtless provoked each other by glances that escaped my own i saw them fling them n j selves upon each other at the same time twisting their legs round each other and ob stinately struggling to bite each other with r p the fangs of the mandibles whether from cd fatigue or from convention the combat was m suspended there was a few seconds truce and each athlete moved away and resumed his threatening posture this circumstance reminded me that in the strange fights be ci tween cats there are also suspensions of hostilities but the contest was soon renewed between my two tarantulae with increased fierceness one of them after holding vic tory in the balance for a while was at last thrown and received a mortal wound in the head he became the prey of the conqueror who tore open his skull and devoured it after this curious duel i kept the victorious tarantula alive for several weeks my district does not boast the ordinary tarantula the spider whose habits have been described above by the wizard of the landes but it possesses an equivalent in the shape of the blackbellied tarantula or nar bonne lycosa half the size of the other clad in black velvet on the lower surface espe cially under the belly with brown chevrons on the abdomen and grey and white rings around the legs her favourite home is the dry pebbly ground covered with sunscorched thjrme in my harmas laboratory there are quite twenty of this spiders burrows rarely do i pass by one of these haunts without giving a glance down the pit where gleam provengal for the bit of waste ground on which the author studies his insects in the natural state  trans lators note like diamonds the four great eyes the four telescopes of the hermit the four others which arc much smaller arc not visible at that depth would i have greater riches i have but to walk a hundred yards from my house on the neighbouring plateau once a shady forest today a dreary solitude where the cricket browses and the wheatear flits from stone to stone the love of lucre has laid waste the land because wine paid handsomely they pulled up the forest to plant the vine then came the phylloxera the vinestocks perished and the once green tableland is now no more than a desolate stretch where a few tufts of hardy grasses sprout among the pebbles this wasteland is the lycosas paradise in an hours time if need were i should discover a hundred burrows within a limited range these dwellings are pits about a foot deep perpendicular at first and then bent elbow wise the average diameter is an inch on the edge of the hole stands a kerb formed of straw bits and scraps of all sorts and even small pebbles the size of a hazelnut the whole is kept in place and cemented with silk often the spider confines herself to drawing together the dry blades of the nearest grass which she ties down with the straps of her spinnerets without removing the blades from the stems often also she rejects this scaffold ing in favour of a masonry constructed of small stones the nature of the kerb is de cided by the nature of the materials within the lycosas reach in the close neighbour hood of the buildingyard there is no selection everything meets with approval provided that it be near at hand economy of time therefore causes the de fensive wall to vary greatly as regards its constituent elements the height varies also one enclosure is a turret an inch high another amounts to a mere rim all have their parts bound firmly together with silk and all have the same width as the subter ranean channel of which they are the exten sion there is here no difference in diameter between the underground manor and its out work nor do we behold at the opening the platform which the turret leaves to give free play to the italian tarantulas legs the blackbellied tarantulas work takes the form of a well surmounted by its kerb when the soil is earthy and homogeneous the architectural type is free from obstruc tions and the spiders dwelling is a cylin drical tube but when the site is pebbly the shape is modified according to the exigencies of the digging in the second case the lair is often a rough winding cave at intervals along whose inner wall stick blocks of stone avoided in the process of excavation whether regular or irregular the house is plastered to a certain depth with a coat of silk which prevents earthslips and facilitates scaling when a prompt exit is required baglivi in his unsophisticated latin teaches us how to catch the tarantula i be came his rusticus insidiator i waved a spike let at the entrance of the burrow to imitate the humming of a bee and attract the atten tion of the lycosa who rushes out thinking that she is capturing a prey this method did not succeed with me the spider it is true leaves her remote apartments and comes a little way up the vertical tube to enquire into the sounds at her door but the wily animal soon scents a trap it remains motion less at midheight and at the least alarm goes down again to the branch gallery where it is invisible leon dufours appears to me a better method if it were only practicable in the con ditions wherein i find myself to drive a knife quickly into the ground across the bur row so as to cut off the tarantulas retreat when she is attracted by the spikelet and standing on the upper floor would be a man oeuvre certain of success if the soil were favourable unfortunately this is not so in my case you might as well try to dig a knife into a block of tufa other stratagems become necessary here are two which were successful i recommend them to future tarantulahunters i insert into the burrow as far down as i can a stalk with a fleshy spikelet which the spider can bite into i move and turn and twist my bait the tarantula when touched by the in truding body contemplates selfdefence and bites the spikelet a slight resistance informs my fingers that the animal has fallen into the trap and se the tip of the stalk in its fangs i draw it to me slowly carefully the spider hauls from below planting her legs against the wall it comes it rises i hide as best i may when the spider enters the perpendicular tunnel if she saw me she would let go the bait and slip down again i thus bring her by degrees to the orifice this is the difficult moment if i continue the gentle movement the spider feeling her self dragged out of her home would at once run back indoors it is impossible to get the suspicious animal out by this means there fore when it appears at the level of the ground i give a sudden pull surprised by this foul play the tarantula has no time to release her hold gripping the spikelet she is thrown some inches away from the burrow her capture now becomes an easy matter outside her own house the lycosa is timid as though scared and hardly capable of run ning away to push her with a straw into a paper bag is the affair of a second it requires some patience to bring the tarantula who has bitten into the insidious spikelet to the entrance of the burrow the following method is quicker i procure a sup ply of live bumblebees i put one into a little bottle with a mouth just wide enough to cover the opening of the burrow and i turn the apparatus thus baited over the said open ing the powerful bee at first flutters and hums about her glass prison then perceiv ing a burrow similar to that of her family she enters it without much hesitation she is extremely illadvised while she goes down the spider comes up and the meeting takes place in the perpendicular passage for a few moments the ear perceives a sort of deathsong it is the humming of the bumblebee protesting against the reception given her this is followed by a long silence then i remove the bottle and dip a longjawed forceps into the pit i withdraw the bumblebee motionless dead with hang ing proboscis a terrible tragedy must have happened the spider follows refusing to let go so rich a booty game and huntress are brought to the orifice sometimes mis trustful the lycosa goes in again but we have only to leave the bumblebee on the threshold of the door or even a few inches away to see her reappear issue from her fortress and daringly recapture her prey this is the moment the house is closed with the finger or a pebble and as baglivi says captatur tamen ista a rustico insidiatore to which i will add adjuvante botnbo thanks to the bumblebee the object of these hunting methods was not exactly to obtain tarantulae i had not the least wish to rear the spider in a bottle i was interested in a different matter here thought i is an ardent huntress living solely by her trade she does not prepare preserved foodstuffs for her offspring she herself feeds on the prey which she catches she is not a paralyzer who cleverly spares her quarry so as to leave it a glimmer of life and keep it fresh for weeks at a time she is a killer who makes a meal off her capture on the spot with her there is no methodical vivisection which destroys movement with out entirely destroying life but absolute death as sudden as possible which protects the assailant from the counterattacks of the assailed her game moreover is essentially bulky and not always of the most peaceful char acter this diana ambushed in her tower needs a prey worthy of her prowess the big grasshopper with the powerful jaws the irascible wasp the bee the bumblebee and other wearers of poisoned daggers must fall likc the dunghettles translators note like the soliury wslspstranslators note into the ambuscade from time to time the duel is nearly equal in point of weapons to the venomous fangs of the lycosa the wasp opposes her venomous stiletto which of the two bandits shall have the best of it the struggle is a handtohand one the tarantula has no secondary means of de fence no cord to bind her victim no trap to subdue her when the epeira or garden spider sees an insect entangled in her great upright web she hastens up and covers the captive with corded meshes and silk ribbons by the armful making all resistance impossi ble when the prey is solidly bound a prick is carefully administered with the poison fangs then the spider retires waiting for the deaththroes to calm down after which the huntress comes back to the game in these conditions there is no serious danger in the case of the lycosa the job is riskier she has naught to serve her but her courage and her fangs and is obliged to leap upon the formidable prey to master it by her dexterity to annihilate it in a measure by her swiftslaying talent annihilate is the word the bumblebees whom i draw from the fatal hole are a suf ficient proof as soon as that shrill buzzing which i called the deathsong ceases in vain i hasten to insert my forceps i always bring out the insect dead with slack proboscis and limp legs scarce a few quivers of those legs tell me that it is a quite recent corpse the bumblebees death is instantaneous each time that i take a fresh victim from the ter rible slaughterhouse my surprise is renewed at the sight of its sudden immobility nevertheless both animals have very nearly the same strength for i choose my bumblebees from among the largest bom bus hortorum and b terrestris their weapons are almost equal the bees dart can bear comparison with the spiders fangs the sting of the first seems to me as formid able as the bite of the second how comes it that the tarantula always has the upper hand and this moreover in a very short con flict whence she emerges unscathed there must certainly be some cunning strategy on her part subtle though her poison may be i cannot believe that its mere injection at any point whatever of the victim is enough to produce so prompt a catastrophe the illfamed rattlesnake does not kill so quickly takes hours to achieve that for which the tarantula does not require a second we must therefore look for an explanation of this sudden death to the vital importance of the point attacked by the spider rather than to the virulence of the poison what is this point it is impossible to recognize it on the bumblebees they enter the burrow and the murder is committed far from sight nor does the lens discover any wound upon the corpse so delicate are the weapons that produce it one would have to see the two adversaries engage in a direct contest i have often tried to place a taran tula and a bumblebee face to face in the same bottle the two animals mutually flee each other each being as much upset as the other at its captivity i have kept them together for twentyfour hours without ag gressive display on either side thinking more of their prison than of attacking each other they temporize as though indifferent the experiment has always been fruitless i have succeeded with bees and wasps but the murder has been committed at night and has taught me nothing i would find both insects next morning reduced to a jelly un der the spiders mandibles a weak prey is a mouthful which the spider reserves for the calm of the night a prey capable of resist ance is not attacked in captivity the pris oners anxiety cools the hunters ardour the arena of a large bottle enables each athlete to keep out of the others way re spected by her adversary who is respected in her turn let us reduce the lists diminish the enclosure i put bumblebee and taran tula into a testtube that has only room for one at the bottom a lively brawl ensues without serious results if the bumblebee be underneath she lies down on her back and with her legs wards off the other as much as she can i do not see her draw her sting the spider meanwhile embracing the whole circumference of the enclosure with her long legs hoists herself a little upon the slippery surface and removes herself as far as possible from her adversary there motionless she awaits events which are soon disturbed by the fussy bumblebee should the latter occupy the upper position the tarantula protects herself by drawing up her legs which keep the enemy at a distance in short save for sharp scuffles when the two champions are in touch nothing happens that deserves attention there is no duel to the death in the narrow arena of the testtube any more than in the wider lists afforded by the bottle utterly timid once she is away from home the spider obstinately refuses the battle nor will the bumblebee giddy though she be think of striking the first blow i abandon experiments in my study we must go direct to the spot and force the duel upon the tarantula who is full of pluck in her own stronghold only instead of the bumblebee who enters the burrow and conceals her death from our eyes it is necessary to substitute another adversary less inclined to penetrate underground there abounds in the garden at this moment on the flowers of the common clary one of the largest and most powerful bees that haunt my district the carpenterbee xylocopa viola cea clad in black velvet with wings of pur ple gauze her size which is nearly an inch exceeds that of the bumblebee her sting is excruciating and produces a swelling that long continues painful i have very exact memo ries on this subject memories that have cost me dear here indeed is an antagonist worthy of the tarantula if i succeed in inducing the spider to accept her i place a certain num ber one by one in bottles small in capacity but having a wide neck capable of surround ing the entrance to the burrow as the prey which i am about to offer is capable of overawing the huntress i select from among the tarantulas the lustiest the boldest those most stimulated by hunger the spikeleted stalk is pushed into the bur row when the spider hastens up at once when she is of a good size when she climbs boldly to the aperture of her dwelling she is admitted to the tourney otherwise she is refused the bottle baited with a carpen terbee is placed upside down over the door of one of the elect the bee buzzes gravely in her glass bell the huntress mounts from the recesses of the cave she is on the threshold but inside she looks she waits i also wait the quarters the halfhours pass nothing the spider goes down again she has probably judged the attempt too dan gerous i move to a second a third a fourth burrow still nothing the huntress refuses to leave her lair fortune at last smiles upon my patience which ha been heavily tried by all these prudent retreats and particularly by the fierce heat of the dogdays a spider suddenly rushes from her hole she has been rendered warlike doubtless by prolonged abstinence the tragedy that happens under the cover of the bottle lasts for but the twinkling of an eye it is over the sturdy carpenterbee is dead where did the murderess strike her that is easily ascertained the tarantula has not let go and her fangs are planted in the nape of the neck the assassin has the knowledge which i suspected she has made for the essen tially vital centre she has stung the insects cervical ganglia with her poisonfangs in short she has bitten the only point a lesion in which produces sudden death i was delighted with this murderous skill which made amends for the blistering which my skin received in the sun once is not custom one swallow does not make a summer is what i have just seen due to accident or to premeditation i turn to other lycosae many a deal too many for my patience stubbornly refuse to dart from their haunts in order to attack the carpenterbee the formidable quarry is too much for their daring shall not hunger which brings the wolf from the wood also bring the tarantula out of her hole two apparently more famished than the rest do at last pounce upon the bee and repeat the scene of murder before my eyes the prey again bitten in the neck exclusively in the neck dies on the instant three murders perpetrated in my presence under identical conditions represent the fruits of my experi ment pursued on two occasions from eight oclock in the morning until twelve midday i had seen enough the quick insect killer had taught me her trade as had the paralyzer before her she had shown me that she is thoroughly versed in the art of the butcher of the pampas the tarantula is an accomplished desnucador it remained to me to confirm the openair experiment with experiments in the privacy of my study i therefore got together a menagerie of these poisonous spiders so as to judge of the viru such as the hairy ammophila the cerceris and the languedocian sphex diggerwasps described in other of the authors essays  translators note the desnucador the argentine slaughterman whose methods of slaying cattle are detailed in the authors essay entitled the theory of instinct  translators note lence of their venom and its effect according to the part of the body injured by the fangs a dozen bottles and testtubes received the prisoners whom i captured by the methods known to the reader to one inclined to scream at the sight of a spider my study filled with odious lycosae would have pre sented a very uncanny appearance though the tarantula scorns or rather fears to attack an adversary placed in her presence in a bottle she scarcely hesitates to bite what is thrust beneath her fangs i take her by the thorax with my for ceps and present to her mouth the animal which i wish stung forthwith if the spider be not already tired by experiments the fangs are raised and inserted i first tried the effects of the bite upon the carpenter bee when struck in the neck the bee suc cumbs at once it was the lightning death which i witnessed on the threshold of the burrows when struck in the abdomen and then placed in a large bottle that leaves its movements free the insect seems at first to have suffered no serious injury it flut ters about and buzzes but half an hour has not elapsed before death is imminent the insect lies motionless upon its back or side at most a few movements of the legs a slight pulsation of the belly continuing till the morrow proclaim that life has not yet entirely departed then everything ceases the carpenterbee is a corpse the importance of this experiment compels our attention when stung in the neck the powerful bee dies on the spot and the spider has not to fear the dangers of a desperate struggle stung elsewhere in the abdomen the insect is capable for nearly half an hour of making use of its dart its mandibles its legs and woe to the lycosa whom the stiletto reaches i have seen some who stabbed in the mouth while biting close to the sting died of the wound within the twentyfour hours that dangerous prey therefore requires in stantaneous death produced by the injury to the nervecentres of the neck otherwise the hunters life would often be in jeopardy the grasshopper order supplied me with a second series of victims green grasshop pers as long as ones finger largeheaded locusts ephippigerae the same result fol lows when these are bitten in the neck light a family of grasshoppers  translators note ning death when injured elsewhere not ably in the abdomen the subject of the experiment resists for some time i have seen a grasshopper bitten in the belly cling firmly for fifteen hours to the smooth upright wall of the glass bell that constituted his prison at last he dropped off and died where the bee that delicate organism succumbs in less than half an hour the grasshopper coarse ruminant that he is resists for a whole day put aside these differences caused by unequal degrees of organic sensitiveness and we sum up as follows when bitten by the tarantula in the neck an insect chosen from among the largest dies on the spot when bitten else where it perishes also but after a lapse of time which varies considerably in the different entomological orders this explains the long hesitation of the tarantula so wearisome to the experimenter when he presents to her at the entrance to the burrow a rich but dangerous prey the ma jority refuse to fling themselves upon the car penterbee the fact is that a quarry of this kind cannot be se recklessly the huntress who missed her stroke by biting at random would do so at the risk of her life the nape of the neck alone possesses the desired vulnerability the adversary must be nipped there and no elsewhere not to floor her at once would mean to irritate her and make her more dangerous than ever the spider is well aware of this in the safe shelter of her threshold therefore prepared to beat a quick retreat if necessary she watches for the favourable moment she waits for the big bee to face her when the neck is easily grabbed if this condition of success offer she leaps out and acts if not weary of the violent evolutions of the quarry she retires indors and that no doubt is why it took me two sit tings of four hours apiece to witness three assassinations formerly instructed by the paralysing wasps i had myself tried to produce paral ysis by injecting a drop of ammonia into the thorax of those insects such as wee vils buprestes and dungbeetles whose compact nervous system assists this physio logical operation i showed myself a ready pupil to my masters teaching and used to paralyse a buprestis or a weevil almost as a genus of bethestranslators note well as a cerceris could have done why should i not today imitate that expert butcher the tarantula with the point of a fine needle i inject a tiny drop of ammonia at the base of the skull of a carpenterbee or a grasshopper the insect succumbs then and there without any other movement than wild convulsions when attacked by the acrid fluid the cervical ganglia cease to do their work and death ensues nevertheless this death is not immediate the throes last for some time the experiment is not wholly satisfactory as regards suddenness why because the liquid which i employ ammonia cannot be compared for deadly efficacy with the lycosas poison a pretty formidable poison as we shall see i make a tarantula bite the leg of a young wellfledged sparrow ready to leave the nest a drop of blood flows the wounded spot is surrounded by a reddish circle changing to purple the bird almost immediately loses the use of its leg which drags with the toes doubled in it hops upon the other apart from this the patient does not seem to trouble much about his hurt his a species of diggerwasp trawtoorj note appetite is good my daughters feed him on flies breadcrumb apricotpulp he is sure to get well he will recover his strength the poor victim of the curiosity of science will be restored to liberty this is the wish the intention of us all twelve hours later the hope of a cure increases the invalid takes nourishment readily he clamours for it if we keep him waiting but the leg still drags i set this down to a temporary paralysis which will soon disappear two days after he refuses his food wrapping himself in his stoicism and his rumpled feathers the sparrow hunches into a ball now motionless now twitching my girls take him in the hollow of their hands and warm him with their breath the spasms become more fre quent a gasp proclaims that all is over the bird is dead there was a certain coolness among us at the eveningmeal i read mute reproaches because of my experiment in the eyes of my homecircle i read an unspoken accusation of cruelty all around me the death of the un fortunate sparrow had saddened the whole family i myself was not without some re morse of conscience the poor result achieved seemed to me too dearly bought i am not made of the stuff of those who without turn ing a hair rip up live dogs to find out noth ing in particular neverthelss i had the courage to start afresh this time on a mole caught ravaging a bed of lettuces there was a danger lest my captive with his famished stomach should leave things in doubt if we had to keep him for a few days he might die not of his wound but of inanition if i did not succeed in giving him suitable food fairly plentiful and dispensed at fairly fre quent intervals in that case i ran a risk of ascribing to the poison what might well be the result of starvation i must therefore begin by finding out if it was possible for me to keep the mole alive in captivity the ani mal was put into a large receptacle from which it could not get out and fed oh a varied diet of insects  beetles grasshoppers es pecially cicada  which it crunched up with an excellent appetite twentyfour hours of this regimen convinced me that the mole was the cicada is the cigale an insect akin to the grass hoiper and found more particularly in the south of france  translators note making the best of the bill of fare and taking kindly to his captivity i made the tarantula bite him at the tip of the snout when replaced in his cage the mole keeps on scratching his nose with his broad paws the thing seems to burn to itch henceforth less and less of the pro vision of cicadae is consumed on the evening of the following day it is refused altogether about thirtysix hours after being bitten the mole dies during the night and certainly not from inanition for there were still half a dozen live cicada in the receptacle as well as a few beetles the bite of the blackbellied tarantula is therefore dangerous to other animals than insects it is fatal to the sparrow it is fatal to the mole up to what point are we to generalize i do not know because my en quiries extended no further nevertheless judging from the little that i saw it appears to me that the bite of this spider is not an accident which man can afford to treat lightly this is all that i have to say to the doctors to the philosophical entomologists i have something else to say i have to call their attention to the consummate knowledge of the insectkillers which vies with that of the paralyzers i speak of insectkillers in the plural for the tarantula must share her deadly art with a host of other spiders especially with those who hunt without nets these insectkillers who live on their prey strike the game dead instantaneously by stinging the nervecentres of the neck the paralyzers on the other hand who wish to keep the food fresh for their larvae destroy the power of movement by stinging the game in the other nervecentres both of them at tack the nervous chain but they select the point according to the object to be attained if death be desired sudden death free from danger to the huntress the insect is attacked in the neck if mere paralysis be required the neck is respected and the lower segments  sometimes one alone sometimes three sometimes all or nearly all according to the special organization of the victim  receive the daggerthrust even the paralyzers at least some of them are acquainted with the immense vital im portance of the nervecentres of the neck we have seen the hairy ammophila munch ing the caterpillars brain the languedocian sphex munching the brain of the ephip pigera with the object of inducing a pass ing torpor but they simply squeeze the brain and do even this with a wise dis cretion they are careful not to drive their sting into this fundamental centre of life not one of them ever thinks of doing so for the result would be a corpse which the larva would despise the spider on the other hand inserts her double dirk there and there alone any elsewhere it would inflict a wound likely to increase resistance through irritation she wants a venison for consump tion without delay and brutally thrusts her fangs into the spot which the others so con scientiously respect if the instinct of these scientific murderers is not in both cases an inborn predisposi tion inseparable from the animal but an acquired habit then i rack my brain in vain to understand how that habit can have been acquired shroud these facts in theoretic mists as much as you will you shall never succeed in veiling the glaring evidence which they afford of a preestablished order of things in the inclement season of the year when the insect has nothmg to do and retires to winter quarters the observer profits by the mildness of the sunny nooks and grubs in the sand lifts the stones searches the brushwood and often he is stirred with a pleasurable ex citement when he lights upon some ingenious work of art discovered unawares happy are the simple of heart whose ambition is satis fied with such treasuretrove i wish them all the joys which it has brought me and which it will continue to bring me despite the vexations of life which grow ever more bit ter as the years follow their swift downward course should the seekers rummage among the wild grasses in the osierbeds and copses i wish them the delight of finding the wonder ful object that at this moment lies before my eyes it is the work of a spider the nest of die banded epeira epeira fasciata latr a

and entomology both refer formerly to describe this group people said articulate animals an expression which possessed the drawback of not jarring on the ear and of being imderstood by all this is out of date nowadays they use the eupho nious term arthropoda and to think that there are men who question the existence of progress i infidels say articulate first then roll out arthropoda and you shall see whether zoological science is not pro gressing i the generic title of the work from which these es says are taken is entomological memories or studies relating to the instinct and habits of insects  trans lators note in bearing and colouring epeira fasciata is the handsomest of the spiders of the south on her fat belly a mighty silkware house nearly as large as a hazelnut are alternate yellow black and silver sashes to which she owes her epithet of banded around that portly abdomen the eight long legs with their dark and palebrown rings radiate like spokes any small prey suits her and as long as she can find supports for her web she settles wherever the locust hops wherever the fly hovers wherever the dragonfly dances or the butterfly flits as a rule because of the greater abundance of game she spreads her toils across some brooklet from bank to bank among the rushes she also stretches them but not assiduously in the thickets of evergreen oak on the slopes with the scrubby greenswards dear to the grass hoppers her huntingweapon is a large upright web whose outer boundary which varies ac cording to the disposition of the ground is fastened to the neighbouring branches by a number of moorings the structure is that adopted by the other weaving spiders straight threads radiate at equal intervals from a central point over this framework runs a continuous spiral thread forming chords or crossbars from the centre to the circumference it is magnificently large and magnificently symmetrical in the lower part of the web starting from the centre a wide opaque ribbon descends zigzagwise across the radii this is the epeiras trademark the flourish of an artist initialing his creation fecit soandso she seems to say when giving the last throw of the shuttle to her handiwork that the spider feels satisfied when after passing and repassing from spoke to spoke she finishes her spiral is beyond a doubt the work achieved ensures her food for a few days to come but in this particular case the vanity of the spinstress has naught to say to the matter the strong silk zigzag is added to impart greater firmness to the web increased resistance is not superfluous for the net is sometimes exposed to severe tests the epeira cannot pick and choose her prizes seated motionless in the centre of her web her eight legs widespread to feel the shaking of the network in any direction she waits for what luck will bring her now some giddy weakling unable to control its flight anon some powerful prey rushing head long with a reckless bound the locust in particular the fiery locust who releases the spring of his long shanks at random often falls into the trap one imagines that his strength ought to frighten the spider the kick of his spurred levers should enable him to make a hole then and there in the web and to get away but not at all if he does not free himself at the first effort the locust is lost turning her back on the game the epeira works all her spinnerets pierced like the rose of a wateringpot at one and the same time the silky spray is gathered by the hindlegs which are longer than the others and open into a wide arc to allow the stream to spread thanks to this artifice the epeira this time obtains not a thread but an iridescent sheet a sort of clouded fan wherein the component threads are kept almost separate the two hindlegs fling this shroud gradually by rapid alternate armfuls while at the same time they turn the prey over and over swath ing it completely the ancient retiarius when pitted against a powerful wild beast appeared in the arena with a ropenet folded over his left shoulder the animal made its spring the man with a sudden movement of his right arm cast the net after the manner of the fishermen he covered the beast and tangled it in the meshes a thrust of the trident gave the quietus to the vanquished foe the epeira acts in like fashion with this advantage that she is able to renew her arm ful of fetters should the first not suffice a second instantly follows and another and yet another until the reserves of silk become ex hausted when all movement ceases under the snowy windingsheet the spider goes up to her bound prisoner she has a better weapon than the bestiarius trident she has her poisonfangs she gnaws at the locust without undue persistence and then with draws leaving the torpid patient to pine away soon she comes back to her motionless head of game she sucks it drains it re peatedly changing her point of attack at last the deanbled remains are flung out of the net and the spider returns to her am bush in the centre of the web what the epeira sucks is not a corpse but a numbed body if i remove the locust im mediately after he has been bitten and release him from the silken sheath the patient recovers his strength to such an ex tent that he seems at first to have suffered no injury the spider therefore does not kill her capture before sucking its juices she is content to deprive it of the power of mo tion by producing a state of torpor perhaps this kindlier bite gives her greater facility in working her pump the humours if stag nant in a corpse would not respond so readily to the action of the sucker they are more easily extracted from a live body in which they move about the epeira therefore being a drinker of blood moderates the virulence of her sting even with victims of appalling size so sure is she of her retiarian art the long legged tryxalis the corpulent grey locust the largest of our grasshoppers are accepted without hesitation and sudced dry as soon as numbed those giants capable of making a a species of grasshopper traiwlfltorj note hole in the net and passing through it in their impetuous onrush can be but rarely caught i myself place them on the web the spider does the rest lavishing her silky spray she swathes them and then sucks the body at her ease with an increased expenditure of the spinnerets the very biggest game is mastered as successfully as the everyday prey i have seen even better than that this time my subject is the silky epeira epeira sericea oliv with a broad festooned silvery abdomen like that of the other her web is large upright and signed with a zigzag ribbon i place upon it a praying mantis a welldeveloped specimen quite capable of changing roles should circum stances permit and herself making a meal oif her assailant it is a question no longer of capturing a peaceful locust but a fierce and powerful ogre who would rip open the epeiras paunch with one blow of her har poons an insect akin to the locusts and crickets which when at rest adopts an attitude resembling that of prayer when attacking it assumes what is known as the spectral attitude its forelegs form a sort of sawlike or barbed harpoons cf social life in the insect world by j h fabre translated by bernard miall chaps v to wiutranslators note will the spider dare not immedi ately motionless in the centre of her net she consults her strength before attacking the formidable quarry she waits until the strug gling prey has its claws more thickly en tangled at last she approaches the mantis curls her belly lifts her wings like vertical sails opens her sawtoothed arm pieces in short adopts the spectral attitude which she employs when delivering battle the spider disregards these menaces spreading wide her spinnerets she pumps out sheets of silk which the hindlegs draw out expand and fling without stint in alternate armfuls under this shower of threads the mantis terrible saws the lethal legs quickly disappear from sight as do the wings still erected in the spectral posture meanwhile the swathed one gives sudden jerks which make the spider fall out of her web the accident is provided for a safetycord emitted at the same instant by the spinnerets keeps the epeira hanging swinging in space when calm is restored she packs her cord and climbs up again the heavy paunch and the hindlegs are now bound the flow slackens the silk comc§ only in thin sheets fortunately the busi ness is done the prey is invisible under the thick shroud the spider retires without giving a bite to master the terrible quarry she has spent the whole reserves of her spinningmill enough to weave many goods webs with this heap of shackles further precau tions are superfluous after a short rest in the centre of the net she comes down to dinner slight incisions are made in different parts of the prize now here now there and the spider puts her mouth to each and sucks the blood of her prey the meal is long protracted so rich is the dish for ten hours i watch the in satiable glutton who changes her point of attack as each wound sucked dries up night comes and robs me of the finish of the un bridled debauch next morning the drained mantis lies upon the ground the ants are eagerly devouring the remains the eminent talents of the epeirae are dis played to even better purpose in the industrial business of motherhood than in the art of the chase the silk bag the nest in which the banded epeira houses her eggs is a much greater marvel than the birds nest in shape it is an inverted balloon nearly the size of a pigeons egg the top tapers like a pear and is cut short and crowned with a scalloped rim the corners of which are lengthened by means of moorings that fasten the object to the adjoining twigs the whole a graceful ovoid hangs straight down amid a few threads that steady it the top is hollowed into a crater closed with a silky padding every other part is contained in the general wrapper formed of thick compact white satin difficult to break and impervious to moisture brown and even black silk laid out in broad ribbons in spindleshaped patterns in fanciful meridian waves adorns the upper portion of the ex terior the part played by this fabric is selfevident it is a waterproof cover which neither dew nor rain can penetrate exposed to all the inclemencies of the weather among the dead grasses close to the ground the epeiras nest has also to protect its contents from the winter cold let us cut the wrapper with our scissors under neath we find a thick layer of reddishbrown silk not worked into a fabric this time but puffed into an extrafine wadding it is a fleeq cloud an incomparable quilt softer than any swansdown this is the screen set up against loss of heat and what does this cosy mass protect see in the middle of the eiderdown hangs a cylindrical pocket round at the bottom cut square at the top and closed with a padded lid it is made of extremely fine satin it contains the epeiras eggs pretty little orange coloured beads which glued together form a globule the size of a pea this is the treas ure to be defended against the asperities of the winter now that we know the structure of the work let us try to see in what manner the spinstress sets about it the observation is not an easy one for the banded epeira is a nightworker she needs nocturnal quiet in order not to go astray amid the complicated rules that guide her industry now and again at very early hours in the morning i have happened to catch her working which enables me to sum up the progress of the operations my subjects are busy in their bellshaped cages at about the middle of august a scaffolding is first run up at the top of the dome it consists of a few stretched threads the wire trellis represents the twigs and the blades of grass which the spider if at liberty would have used as suspension points the loom works on this shaky support the epeira does not see what she is doing she turns her back on her task the machinery is so well put together that the whole thing goes automatically the tip of the abdomen sways a little to the right a little to the left rises and falls while the spider moves slowly round and round the thread paid out is single the hindlegs draw it out and place it in position on that which is already done thus is formed a satin receptacle the rim of which is gradually raised until it becomes a bag about a centimeter deep the texture is of the daintiest guyropes bind it to the nearest threads and keep it stretched especially at the mouth then the spinnerets take a rest and the turn of the ovaries comes a continuous shower of eggs falls into the bag which is filled to the top the capacity of the recep inch  translators note tade has been so nicely calculated that there is room for all the eggs without leaving any space unoccupied when the spider has finished and retires i catch a momentary glimpse of the heap of orangecoloured eggs but the work of the spinnerets is at once resumed the next business is to close the bag the machinery works a little differently the tip of the belly no longer sways from side to side it sinks and touches a point it re treats sinks again and touches another point first here then there describing inextricable zigzags at the same time the hindlegs tread the material emitted the result is no longer a stuff but a felt a blanketing around the satin capsule which contains the eggs is the eiderdown destined to keep out the cold the youngsters will bide for some time in this soft shelter to strengthen their joints and prepare for the final exodus it does not take long to make the spinning mill suddenly alters the raw material it was turning out white silk it now furnishes reddishbrown silk finer than the other and issuing in clouds which the hindlegs those dexterous carders beat into a sort of froth the eggpocket disappears drowned in this exquisite wadding the balloonshape is already outlined the top of the work tapers to a neck the spider moving up and down tacking first to one side and then to the other from the very first spray marks out the graceful form as accurately as though she carried a compass in her abdomen then once again with the same sudden ness the material changes the white silk reappears wrought into thread this is the moment to weave the outer wrapper be cause of the thickness of the stufi and the density of its texture this operation is the longest of the series first a few threads are flung out hither and thither to keep the layer of wadding in position the epeira takes special pains with the edge of the neck where she fashions an indented border the angles of which pro longed with cords or lines form the main sup port of the building the spinnerets never touch this part without giving it each time until the end of the work a certain added solidity necessary to secure the stability of the balloon the suspensory indentations soon outline a crater which needs plugging the spider closes the bag with a padded stopper similar to that with which she sealed the egg pocket when these arrangements are made the real manufacture of the wrapper begins the spider goes backwards and forwards turns and turns again the spinnerets do not touch the fabric with a rhythmical alter nate movement the hindlegs the sole im plements employed draw the thread seize it in their combs and apply it to the work while the tip of the abdomen sways methodically to and fro in this way the silken fibre is distributed in an even zigzag of almost geometrical pre cision and comparable with that of the cotton thread which the machines in our factories roll so neatly into balls and this is repeated all over the surface of the work for the spider shifts her position a little at every moment at fairly frequent intervals the tip of the abdomen is lifted to the mouth of the bal loon and then the spinnerets really touch the fringed edge the length of contact is even considerable we find therefore that the thread is stuck in this starshaped fringe the foundation of the building and the crux of the whole while every elsewhere it is simply laid on in a manner determined by the move ments of the hindlegs if we wished to un wind the work the thread would break at the margin at any other point it would unroll the epeira ends her web with a dead white angular flourish she ends her nest with brown mouldings which run down ir regularly from the marginal junction to the bulging middle for this purpose she makes use for the third time of a different silk she now produces silk of a dark hue vary ing from russet to black the spinnerets distribute the material with a wide longitudi nal swing from pole to pole and the hind legs apply it in capricious ribbons when this is done the work is finished the spider moves away with slow strides without giving a glance at the bag the rest does not in terest her time and the sun will see to it she felt her hour at hand and came down from her web near by in the rank grass she wove the tabernacle of her offspring and in so doing drained her resources to re sume her huntingpost to return to her web would be useless to her she has not the wherewithal to bind the prey besides the fine appetite of former days has gone withered and languid she drags out her ex istence for a few days and at last dies this is how things happen in my cages this is how they must happen in the brushwood the silky epeira epeira sericea oliv excels the banded epeira in the manufacture of big huntingnets but she is less gifted in the art of nestbuilding she gives her nest the inelegant form of an obtuse cone the opening of this pocket is very wide and is scalloped into lobes by which the edifice is slung it is closed with a large lid half satin half awansdown the rest is a stout white fabric frequently covered with irregular brown streaks the difference between the work of the two epeirae does not extend beyond the wrap per which is an obtuse cone in the one case and a balloon in the other the same in ternal arrangements prevail behind this front age first a flossy quilt next a little keg in which the eggs are packed though the two spiders build the outer wall according to special architectural rules they both employ the same means as a protection against the cold as we see the eggbag of the epeirae particularly that of the banded epeira is an important and complex work various ma terials enter into its composition white silk red silk brown silk moreover these materi als are worked into dissimilar products stout cloth soft eiderdown dainty satinette porous felt and all of this comes from the same workshop that weaves the huntingnet warps the zigzag ribbonband and casts an entan gling shroud over the prey what a wonderful silk factory it is with a very simple and nevervarying plant con sisting of the hindlegs and the spinnerets it produces by turns ropemakers spinners weavers ribbonmakers and fullers work how does the spider direct an establish ment of this kind how does she obtain at will skeins of diverse hues and grades how does she turn them out first in this fashion then in that i see the results but i do not understand the machinery and still less the process it beats me altogether the spider also sometimes loses her head in her difficult trade when some trouble dis turbes the peace of her nocturnal labours i do not provoke this trouble myself for i am not present at those unseasonable hours it is simply due to the conditions prevailing in my menagerie in their natural state the epeirae settle separately at long distances from one another each has her own huntinggrounds where there is no reason to fear the competition that would result from the close proximity of the nets in my cages on the other hand there is cohabitation in order to save space i lodge two or three epeirae in the same cage my easygoing captives live together in peace there is no strife between them no encroach ing on the neighbours property each of them weaves herself a rudimentary web as far from the rest as possible and here rapt in contemplation as though indifferent to what the others are doing she awaits the hop of the locust nevertheless these close quarters have their drawbacks when layingtime arrives the cords by which the different establish ments are hung interlace and crisscross in a confused network when one of them shakes all the others are more or less affected this is enough to distract the layer from her business and to make her do silly things here are two instances a bag has been woven during the night i find it when i visit the cage in the morning hanging from the trelliswork and completed it is perfect as regards structure it is deco rated with the regulation black meridian curves there is nothing missing nothing except the essential thing the eggs for which the spinstress has gone to such expense in the matter of silks where are the eggs they are not in the bag which i open and find empty they are lying on the ground below on the sand in the pan utterly unprotected disturbed at the moment of discharging them the mother has missed the mouth of the little bag and dropped them on the floor perhaps even in her excitement she came down from above and compelled by the ex igencies of the ovaries laid her eggs on the first support that offered no matter if her spider brain contains the least gleam of sense she must be aware of the disaster and is there fore bound at once to abandon the elaborate manufacture of a now superfluous nest not at all the bag is woven around noth ing as accurate in shape as finished in struc ture as under normal conditions the absurd perseverance displayed by certain bees whose egg and provisions i used to remove is here repeated without the slightest interfer ence from me my victims used scrupulously to seal up their empty cells in the same way the epeira puts the eiderdown quilting and the taffeta wrapper round a capsule that contains nothing another distracted from her work by some startling vibration leaves her nest at the moment when the layer of redbrown wad ding is being completed she flees to the dome at a few inches above her unfinished work and spends upon a shapeless mattress of no use whatever all the silk with which she would have woven the outer wrapper if nothing had come to disturb her poor fool you upholster the wires of your cage with swansdown and you leave the eggs imperfectly protected the absence of the work already executed and the hard ness of the metal do not warn you that you these experiments are described in the authors es say on the mason bees entitled fragments on insect psychology  translators note are now engaged upon a senseless task you remind me of the pelopaeus who used to coat with mud the place on the wall whence her nest had been removed you speak to me in your own fashion of a strange psy chology which is able to reconcile the wonders of a mastercraftsmanship with aberrations due to unfathomable stupidity let us compare the work of the banded epeira with that of the penduline titmouse the cleverest of our small birds in the art of nestbuilding this tit haunts the osierbeds of the lower reaches of the rhone rocking gently in the river breeze his nest sways pendent over the peaceful backwaters at some distance from the tooimpetuous cur rent it hangs from the drooping end of the branch of a poplar an old willow or an alder all of them tall trees favouring the banks of streams it consists of a cotton bag closed all round save for a small opening at the side just sufficient to allow of the mothers pas sage in shape it resembles the body of an alembic a chemists retort with a short lateral neck or better still the foot of a a species of wasp  translators note stocking with the edges brought together but for a little round hole left at one side the outward appearances increase the like ness one can almost see the traces of a knit tingneedle working with coarse stitches that is why struck by this shape the provencal peasant in his expressive language calls the penduline lou debassaire the stodk ingknitter the earlyripening seedlets of the willows and poplars furnish the materials for the work there breaks from them in may a sort of vernal snow a fine down which the eddies of the air heap in the crevices of the ground it is a cotton similar to that of our manufactures but of very short staple it comes from an inexhaustible warehouse the tree is bountiful and the wind from the osier beds gathers the tiny flocks as they pour from the seeds they are easy to pick up the difficulty is to set to work how does the bird proceed in order to knit its stock ing how with such simple implements as its beak and claws does it manage to produce a fabric which our skilled fingers would fail to achieve an examination of the nest will inform us to a certain extent the cotton of the poplar cannot of itself supply a hanging pocket capable of supporting the weight of the brood and resisting the buffeting of the wind rammed entangled and packed together the flocks similar to those which ordinary wadding would give if chopped up very fine would produce only an agglomeration devoid of cohesion and liable to be dis pelled by the first breath of air they require a canvas a woof to keep them in position tiny dead stalks with fibrous barks well softened by the action of moisture and the air furnish the penduline with a coarse tow not unlike that of hemp with these liga ments purged of every woody particle and tested for flexibility and tenacity he winds a number of loops round the end of the branch which he has selected as a support for his structure it is not a very accurate piece of work the loops run clumsily and anyhow some are slacker others tighter but when all is said it is solid which is the main point also this fibrous sheath the keystone of the edifice occupies a fair length of branch which enables the fastenings for the net to be multiplied the several straps after describing a cer tain number of turns ravel out at the ends and hang loose after them come inter laced threads greater in number and finer in texture in the tangled jumble occur what might almost be described as weavers knots as far as one can judge by the result alone without having seen the bird at work this is how the canvas the support of the cotton wall is obtained this woof this inner framework is ob viously not constructed in its entirety from the start it goes on gradually as the bird stuffs the part above it with cotton the wadding picked up bit by bit from the ground is teazled by the birds claws and in serted all fleecy into the meshes of the canvas the beak pushes it the breast presses it both inside and out the result is a soft felt a couple of inches thick near the top of the pouch on one side is contrived a narrow orifice tapering into a short neck this is the kitchendoor in order to pass through it the penduline small though he be has to force the elastic parti tion which yields slightly and then contracts lastly the house is furnished with a mattress of firstquality cotton here lie from six to eight white eggs the size of a cherrystone well this wonderful nest is a barbarous uj casemate

more devoted mother for weeks on end squat ting at the bottom of her purse she presses to q her heart the eggs those little white pebbles x from which the warmth of her body will j bring forth life the epeira knows not these softer passions without bestowing a second glance on it she abandons her nest to its fate be it good or ill the epeira who displays such aston ishing industry to give her eggs a dwellinghouse of incomparable perfection becomesi after that careless of her family for what reason she lacks the time she has to die when the first cold comes whereas the eggs are destined to pass the winter in their downy snuggery the desertion of the nest is inevitable owing to the very force of things but if the hatching were earlier and took place in the epeiras lifetime i imagine that she would rival the bird in devotion so i gather from the analogy of thomisus onustus walck a shapely spider who weaves no web lies in wait for her prey and walks sideways after the manner of the crab i have spoken elsewhere of her encounters with the domestic bee whom she jugulates by biting her in the neck in chapter viii of the present volume raiw lators note skilful in the prompt despatch of her prey the little crab spider is no less wellversed in the nesting art i find her settled on a privet in the enclosure here in the heart of a cluster of flowers the luxurious creature plaits a little pocket of white satin shaped like a wee thimble it is the receptacle for the eggs a round flat lid of a felted fabric closes the mouth above this ceiling rises a dome of stretched threads and faded flowerets which have fallen from the cluster this is the watchers belvedere her conningtower an opening which is always free gives access to this post here the spider remains on constant duty she has thinned greatly since she laid her eggs has almost lost her corporation at the least alarm she sallies forth waves a threatening limb at the passing stranger and invites him with a gesture to keep his dis tance having put the intruder to flight she quickly returns indoors and what does she do in there under her arch of withered flowers and silk night and day she shields the precious eggs with her poor body spread out flat eating is neglected no more lying in wait no more bees drained to the last drop of blood motionless rapt in meditation the spider is in an incubating posture in other words she is sitting on her eggs strictly speaking the word incubating means that and nothing else the brooding hen is no more assiduous but she is also a heatingapparatus and with the gentle warmth of her body awakens the germs to life for the spider the heat of the sun suffices and this alone keeps me from saying that she broods for two or three weeks more and more wrinkled by abstinence the little spider never relaxes her position then comes the hatch ing the youngsters stretch a few threads in swinglike curves from twig to twig the tiny ropedancers practise for some days in the sun then they disperse each intent upon his own affairs let us now look at the watchtower of the nest the mother is still there but this time lifeless the devoted creature has known the delight of seeing her family bom she has assisted the weaklings through the trapdoor and when her duty was done very gently she died the hen does not reach this height of selfabnegation other spiders do better still as for in stance the narbonne lycosa or black bellied tarantula lycosa narbonnensis walck whose prowess has been described in an earlier chapter the reader will re member her burrow her pit of a bottlenecks width dug in the pebbly soil beloved by the lavender and the thyme the mouth is rimmed by a bastion of gravel and bits of wood cemented with silk there is nothing else around her dwelling no web no snares of any kind from her inchhigh turret the lycosa lies in wait for the passing locust she gives a bound pursues the prey and suddenly de prives it of motion with a bite in the neck the game is consumed on the spot or else in the lair the insects tough hide arouses no disgust the sturdy huntress is not a drinker of blood like the epeira she needs solid food food that crackles between the jaws she is like a dog devouring his bone would you care to bring her to the light of day from the depths of her well insert a thin straw into the burrow and move it about uneasy as to what is happening above the recluse hastens to climb up and stops in a threatening attitude at some dis tance from the orifice you see her eight eyes gleaming like diamonds in the dark you see her powerful poisonfangs yawning ready to bite he who is not accustomed to the sight of this horror rising from under the ground cannot suppress a shiver brrrrl let us leave the beast alone chance a poor standby sometimes con trives very well at the beginning of the month of august the children call me to the far side of the enclosure rejoicing in a find which they have made under the rosemary bushes it is a magnificent lycosa with an enormous belly the sign of an impending delivery the obese spider is gravely devouring something in the midst of a circle of on lookers and what the remains of a lycosa a little smaller than herself the re mains of her male it is the end of the tragedy that concludes the nuptials the sweetheart is eating her lover i allow the matrimonial rites to be fulfilled in all their horror and when the last morsel of the un happy wretch has been scrunched up i in carcerate the terrible matron under a cage standing in an earthen pan filled with sand early one morning ten days later i find her preparing for her confinement a silk network is first spun on the ground covering an extent about equal to the palm of ones handy it is coarse and shapeless but firmly fixed this is the floor on which the spider means to operate on this foundation which acts as a pro tection from the sand the lycosa fashions a round mat the size of a twofranc piece and made of superb white silk with a gentle uniform movement which might be regulated by the wheels of a delicate piece bf clock work the tip of the abdomen rises and falls each time touching the supporting base a little farther away until the extreme scope of the mechanism is attained then without the spiders moving her position the oscillation is resumed in the op posite direction by means of this alternate motion interspersed with numerous contacts a segment of the sheet is obtained of a very accurate texture when this is done the spider moves a little along a circular line and no the loom works in the same manner on another segment the silk disk a sort of hardly concave paten now no longer receives aught from the spinnerets in its centre the marginal belt alone increases ih thickness the piece thus becomes a bowlshaped porringer surrounded by a wide flat edge the time for the laying has come with one quick emission the viscous paleyellow eggs are laid in the basin where they heap to gether in the shape of a globe which projects largely outside the cavity the spinnerets are once more set going with short move ments as the tip of the abdomen rises and falls to weave the round mat they cover up the exposed hemisphere the result is a pill set in the middle of a circular carpet the legs hitherto idle are now working they take up and break ofif one by one the threads that keep the round mat stretched on the coarse supporting network at the same time the fangs grip this sheet lift it by de grees tear it from its base and fold it over upon the globe of eggs it is a laborious operation the whole edifice totters the floor collapses fouled with sand by a movement of the legs those soiled shreds are cast aside briefly by means of violent tugs of the fangs which pull and broomlike efforts of the legs which clear away the lycosa extri cates the bag of eggs and removes it as a clearcut mass free from any adhesion it is a whitesilk pill soft to the touch and glutinous its size is that of an average cherry an observant eye will notice run ning horizontally around the middle a fold which a needle is able to raise without break ing it this hem generally undistinguish able from the rest of the surface is none other than the edge of the circular mat drawn over the lower hemisphere the other hemisphere through which the youngsters will go out is less well fortified its only wrap per is the texture spun over the eggs imme diately after they were laid inside there is nothing but the eggs no mattress no soft eiderdown like that of the epeirae the lycosa indeed has no need to guard her eggs against the inclemencies of the winter for the hatching will take place long before the cold weather comes similarly the thomisus with her early brood takes good care not to incur useless expenditure she gives her eggs for their protection a simple purse of satin the work of spinning followed by that of tearing is continued for a whole morning from five to nine oclock worn out with fatigue the mother embraces her dear pill and remains motionless i shall see no more today next morning i find the spider car rying the bag of eggs slung from her stern henceforth until the hatching she does not leave go of the precious burden which fastened to the spinnerets by a short ligament drags and bumps along the ground with this load banging against her heels she goes about her business she walks or rests she seeks her prey attacks it and devours it should some accident cause the wallet to drop off it is soon replaced the spinnerets touch it somewhere anywhere and that is enough adhesion is at once restored the lycosa is a stayathome she never goes out except to snap up some game passing within her huntingdomains near the burrow at the end of august however it is not un usual to meet her roaming about dragging her wallet behind her her hesitations make one think that she is looking for her home which she has left for the moment and has a dif ficulty in finding why these rambles there are two rea sons first the pairing and then the making of the pill there is a lack of space in the burrow which provides only room enough for the spider engaged in long contempla tion now the preparations for the eggbag require an extensive flooring a supporting framework about the size of ones hand as my caged prisoner has shown us the lycosa has not so much space at her disposal in her well hence the necessity for coming out and working at her wallet in the open air doubt less in the quiet hours of the night the meeting with the male seems likewise to demand an excursion running the risk of being eaten alive will he venture to plunge into his ladys cave into a lair whence flight would be impossible it is very doubtful prudence demands that matters should take place outside here at least there is some chance of beating a hasty retreat which will enable the rash swain to escape the attacks of his horrible bride the interview in the open air lessens the danger without removing it entirely we had proof of this when wc caught the lycosa in the act of devouring her lover above ground in a part of the enclosure which had been broken for planting and which was therefore not suitable for the spiders es tablishment the burrow must have been some way off and the meeting of the pair took place at the very spot of the tragic catas trophe although he had a clear road the male was not quick enough in getting away and was duly eaten after this cannibal orgy does the lycosa go back home perhaps not for a while besides she would have to go out a second time to manufacture her pill on a level space of sufficient extent when the work is done some of them emancipate themselves think they will have a look at the country before retiring for good and all it is these whom we sometimes meet wandering aimlessly and dragging their bag behind them sooner or later however the vagrants return home and the month of august is not over before a straw rustled in any burrow will bring the mother up with her wallet slung behind her i am able to procure as many as i want and with them to indulge in certain experiments of the high est interest it is a sight worth seeing that of the ly cosa dragging her treasure after her never leaving it day or night sleeping or waking and defending it with a courage that strikes the beholder with awe if i try to take the bag from her she presses it to her breast in despair hangs on to my pincers bites them with her poisonfangs i can hear the dag gers grating on the steel no she would not allow herself to be robbed of the wallet with impunity if my fingers were not supplied with an implement by dint of pulling and shaking the pill with the forceps i take it from the lycosa who protests furiously i fling her in ex change a pill taken from another lycosa it is at once se in the fangs embraced by the legs and hung on to the spinneret her own or anothers it is all one to the spider who walks away proudly with the alien wal let this was to be expected in view of the similarity of the pills exchanged a test of another kind with a second sub ject renders the mistake more striking i substitute in the place of the lawful bag which i have removed the work of the silky epeira the colour and softness of the ma terial are the same in both cases but the shape is quite different the stolen object is a globe the object presented in exchange is an elliptical conoid studded with angular pro jections along the edge of the base the spider takes no account of this dissimilarity she promptly glues the queer bag to her spin nerets and is as pleased as though she were in possession of her real pill my experimental villainies have no other consequences beyond an ephemeral carting when hatchingtime arrives early in the case of the lycosa late in that of the epeira the gulled spider aban dons the strange bag and pays it no further attention let us penetrate yet deeper into the wallet bearers stupidity after depriving the ly cosa of her eggs i throw her a ball of cork roughly polished with a file and of the same size as the stolen pill she accepts the corky substance so different from the silk purse without the least demur one would have thought that she would recognize her mistake with those eight eyes of hers which gleam like precious stones the silly creature pays no attention lovingly she embraces the cork ball fondles it with her palpi fastens it to her spinnerets and thenceforth drags it after her as though she were dragging her own bag let us give another the choice between the imitation and the real the rightful pill and the cork ball are placed together on the floor of the jar will the spider be able to know the one that belongs to her the fool is in capable of doing so she makes a wild rush and seizes haphazard at one time her prop erty at another my sham product what ever is first touched becomes a good capture and is forthwith hung up if i increase the number of cork balls if i put in four or five of them with the real pill among them it is seldom that the lycosa recovers her own property attempts at en quiry attempts at selection there are none whatever she snaps up at random she sticks to be it good or bad as there are more of the sham pills of cork these are the most often se by the spider this obtuseness baffles me can the animal be deceived by the soft contact of the cork i replace the cork balls by pellets of cotton or paper kept in their round shape with a few bands of thread both are very readily ac cepted instead of the real bag that has been removed can the illusion be due to the colouring which is light in the cork and not unlike the tint of the silk globe when soiled with a little earth while it is white in the paper and the cotton when it is identical with that of the original pill i give the lycosa in ex change for her work a pellet of silk thread chosen of a fine red the brightest of all colours the uncommon pill is as readily accepted and as jealously guarded as the others we will leave the walletbearer alone we know all that we want to know about her poverty of intellect let us wait for the hatching which takes place in the first fort night in september as they come out of the pill the youngsters to the number of about a couple of a hundred clamber on the spiders back and there sit motionless jammed close together forming a sort of bark of mingled legs and paunches the mother is unrecognizable under this live man tilla when the hatching is over the wallet is loosened from the spinnerets and cast aside as a worthless rag the little ones are very good none stirs none tries to get more room for himself at his neighbours expense what are they doing there so quietly they allow them selves to be carted about like the young of the opossum whether she sit in long medi tation at the bottom of her den or come to the orifice in mild weather to bask in the sun the lycosa never throws off her greatcoat of swarming youngsters until the fine season comes if in the middle of winter in january or february i happen out in the fields to ransack the spiders dwelling after the rain snow and frost have battered it and as a rule dismantled the bastion at the entrance i al ways find her at home still full of vigour still carrying her family this vehicular upbringing lasts five or six months at least without interruption the celebrated ameri can carrier the opossum who emancipates her offspring after a few weeks carting cuts a poor figure beside the lycosa what do the little ones eat on the ma ternal spine nothing so far as i know i a do not see them grow larger i find them at the tardy period of their emancipa tion just as they were when they left the bag during the bad season the mother herself is extremely abstemious at long intervals she accepts in my jars a belated locust whom i have captured for her benefit in the sunnier nooks in order to keep herself in condition as when she is dug up in the course of my winter excavations she must therefore sometimes break her fast and come out in search of prey without of course discarding her live mantilla the expedition has its dangers the youngsters may be brushed off by a blade of grass what becomes of them when they have a fall does the mother give them a thought does she come to their assistance and help them to regain their place on her back not at all the affection of a spiders heart divided among some hun dreds can spare but a very feeble portion to each the lycosa hardly troubles whether one youngster fall from his place or six or all of them she waits impassively for the victims of the mishap to get out of their own difficulty which they do for that matter and very nimbly i sweep the whole family from the back of one of my boarders with a hairpencil not a sign of emotion not an attempt at search on the part of the denuded one after trotting about a little on the sand the dis lodged youngsters find these here those there one or other of the mothers legs spread wide in a circle by means of these climbingpoles they swarm to the top and soon the dorsal group resumes its original form not one of the lot is missing the lycosas sons know their trade as acrobats to perfection the mother need not trouble her head about their fall with a sweep of the pencil i make the family of one spider fall around another laden with her own family the dislodged ones nimbly scramble up the legs and climb on the back of their new mother who kindly allows them to behave as though they be longed to her there is no room on the abdomen the regulation restingplace which is already occupied by the real sons the in vaders thereupon encamp on the front part beset the thorax and change the carrier into a horrible pincushion that no longer bears the least resemblance to a spider form meanwhile the sufferer raises no sort of pro test against this access of family she placidly accepts them all and walks them all about the youngsters on their side are unable to distinguish between what is permitted and forbidden remarkable acrobats that they are they climb on the first spider that comes along even when of a different species pro vided that she be of a fair size i place them in the presence of a big epeira marked with a white cross on a paleorange ground epeira pallida oliv the little ones as soon as they are dislodged from the back of the ly cosa their mother clamber up the stranger without hesitation intolerant of these familiarities the spider shakes the leg encroached upon and flings the intruders to a distance the as sault is doggedly resumed to such good purpose that a dozen succeed in hoisting them selves to the top the epeira who is not accustomed to the tickling of such a load turns over on her back and rolls on the ground in the manner of a donkey when his hide is itching some are lamed some are even crushed this does not deter the others who repeat the escalade as soon as the epeira is on her legs again then come more somer saults more rollings on the back until the giddy swarm are all discomfited and leave the spider in peace llif ichelet has told us how as a printers apprentice in a cellar he es tablished amicable relations with a spider at a certain hour of the day a ray of sun light would glint through the window of the gloomy workshop and light up the little com positors case then his eightlegged neigh bour would come down from her web and take her share of the sunshine on the edge of the case the boy did not interfere with her he welcomed the trusting visitor as a friend and as a pleasant diversion from the long monotony when we lack the society of our fellowmen we take refuge in that of animals without always losing by the change i do not thank god suffer from the melancholy of a cellar my solitude is gay with light and verdure i attend whenever jules michelct author of loiseau and linsecle in addition to the historical works for which he is chiefly known as a lad he helped his father a printer by trade ih setting type  translators note i please the fields high festival the thrushes concert the crickets symphony and yet my friendly commerce with the spider is marked by an even greater devotion than the young typesetters i admit her to the intimacy of my study i make room for her among my books i set her in the sun on my windowledge i visit her assiduously at her home in the country the object of our relations is not to create a means of escape from the petty worries of life pinpricks whereof i have my share like other men a very large share indeed i propose to sub mit to the spider a host of questions whereto at times she condescends to reply to what fair problems does not the habit of frequenting her give risel to set them forth worthily the marvellous art which the little printer was to acquire were not too much one needs the pen of a michelet and i have but a rough blunt pencil let us try nevertheless even when poorly clad truth is still beautiful i will therefore once more take up the story of the spiders instinct a story of which the preceding chapters have given but a very rough idea since i wrote those earlier es says my field of observation has been greatly extended my notes have been enriched by new and most remarkable facts it is right that i should employ them for the purpose of a more detailed biography the exigencies of order and clearness ex pose me it is true to occasional repetitions this is inevitable when one has to marshal in an harmonious whole a thousand items culled from day to day often unexpectedly and bearing no relation one to the other the observer is not master of his time oppor tunity leads him and by unsuspected ways a certain question suggested by an earlier fact finds no reply until many years after its scope moreover is amplified and completed with views collected on the road in a work therefore of this fragmentary character rep etitions necessary for the due coordination of ideas are inevitable i shall be as sparing of them as i can let us once more introduce our old friends the epeira and the lycosa who are the most important spiders in my district the nar bonne lycosa or blackbellied tarantula chooses her domicile in the waste pebbly lands beloved of the thyme her dwelling a fortress rather than a villa is a burrow about nine inches deep and as wide as the neck of a claretbottle the direction is per pendicular in so far as obstacles frequent in a soil of this kind permit a bit of gravel can be extracted and hoisted outside but a flint is an immovable boulder which the spider avoids by giving a bend to her gallery if more such are met with the residence be comes a winding cave with stone vaults with lobbies communicating by means of sharp passages this lack of plan has no attendant draw backs so well does the owner from long habit know every comer and storey of her mansion if any interesting buzz occur overhead the lycosa climbs up from her rugged manor with the same speed as from a vertical shaft perhaps she even finds the windings and turnings an advantage when she has to drag into her den a prey that hap pens to defend itself as a rule the end of the burrow widens into a sidechamber a lounge or restingplace where the spider meditates at length and is content to lead a life of quiet when her belly is full a silk coating but a scanty one for the lycosa has not the wealth of silk possessed by the weaving spiders lines the walls of the tube and keeps the loose earth from fall ing this plaster which cements the inco hesive and smooths the rugged parts is re served more particularly for the top of the gallery near the mouth here in the day time if things be peaceful all around the lycosa stations herself either to enjoy the warmth of the sun her great delight or to lie in wait for game the threads of the silk lining afford a firm hold to the claws on every side whether the object be to sit motionless for hours revelling in the light and heat or to pounce upon the passing prey around the orifice of the burrow rises to a greater or lesser height a circular parapet formed of tiny pebbles twigs and straps bor rowed from the dry leaves of the neighbour ing grasses all more or less dexterously tied together and cemented with silk this work of rustic architecture is never missing even though it be no more than a mere pad when she reaches maturity and is once settled the lycosa becomes eminently do mesticated i have been living in close com munion with her for the last three years i have installed her in large earthen pans on the windowsills f my study and i have her daily under my eyes well it is very rarely that i happen on her outside a few inches from her hole back to which she bolts at the least alarm we may take it then that when not in captivity the lycosa does not go far afield to gather the wherewithal to build her para pet and that she makes shift with what she finds upon her threshold in these conditions the buildingstones are soon ex hausted and the masonry ceases for lack of materials the wish came over me to see what di mensions the circular edifice would assume if the spider were given an unlimited supply with captives to whom i myself act as pur veyor the thing is easy enough were it only with a view to helping whoso may one day care to continue these relations with the big spider of the wastelands let me describe how my subjects are housed a goods earthenware pan some nine inches deep is filled with a red clayey earth rich in pebbles similar in short to that of the places haunted by the lycosa properly moistened into a paste the artificial soil is heaped layer by layer around a central reed of a bore equal to that of the animals natural burrow when the receptacle is filled to the top i withdraw the reed which leaves a yawning perpendicular shaft i thus obtain the abode which shall replace that of the fields to find the hermit to inhabit it is merely the matter of a walk ii the neighbourhood when removed from her own dwelling which is turned topsyturvy by my trowel and placed in possession of the den produced by my art the lycosa at once disappears into that den she does not come out again seeks nothing better elsewhere a large wire gauze cover rests on the soil in the pan and prevents escape in any case the watch in this respect makes no demands upon my diligence the priso ner is satisfied with her new abode and mani fests no regret for her natural burrow there is no attempt at flight on her part let me not omit to add that each pan must receive not more than one inhabitant the lycosa is very intolerant to her a neigh hour is fair game to be eaten without scruple when one has might on ones side time was when unaware of this fierce intolerance which is more savage still at breedingtime i saw hideous orgies perpetrated in my over stocked cages i shall have occasion to de scribe those tragedies later let us meanwhile consider the isolated ly cosae they do not touch up the dwelling which i have moulded for them with a bit of reed at most now and again perhaps with the object of forming a lounge or bedroom at the bottom they fling out a few loads of rub bish but all little by little build the kerb that is to edge the mouth i have given them plenty of firstrate ma terials far superior to those which they use when left to their own resources these con sist first for the foundations of little smooth stones some of which are as large as an almond with this roadmetal are mingled short strips of raphia or palmfibre flexible ribbons easily bent these stand for the spiders usual basketwork consisting of slen der stalks and dry blades of grass lastly by way of an unprecedented treasure never yet employed by a lycosa i place at ihy cap tives disposal some thick threads of wool cut into inch lengths as i wish at the same time to find out whether my animals with the magnificent lenses of their eyes are able to distinguish colours and prefer one colour to another i mix up bits of wool of different hues there are red green white and yellow pieces if the spider have any preference she can choose where she pleases the lycosa always works at night a re grettable circumstance which does not allow me to follow the workers methods i see the result and that is all were i to visit the buildingyard by the light of a lantern i should be no wiser the animal which is very shy would at once dive into its lair and i should have lost my sleep for nothing furthermore she is not a very diligent labourer she likes to take her time two or three bits of wool or raphia placed in posi tion represent a whole nights work and to this slowness we must add long spells of utter idleness two months pass and the result of my liberality surpasses my expectations possess ing more windfalls than they know what to do with all picked up in their immediate neighbourhood my lycoss have built them selves donjonkeeps the like of which their race has not yet known around the orifice on a slightly sloping bank small flat smooth stones have been laid to form a broken flagged pavement the larger stones which are cyclopean blocks compared with the size of the animal that has shifted them are em ployed as abundantly as the others on this rockwork stands the donjon it is an interlacing of raphia and bits of wool picked up at random without distinction of shade red and white green and yellow are mixed without any attempt at order the lycosa is indifferent to the joys of colour the ultimate result is a sort of muff a couple of inches high bands of silk sup plied by the spinnerets unite the pieces so that the whole resembles a coarse fabric without being absolutely faultless for there are always awkward pieces on the outside which the worker could not handle the gaudy building is not devoid of merit the bird lining its nest would do no better whoso sees the curious manycoloured productions in my pans takes them for an outcome of my industry contrived with a view to some ex perimental mischief and his surprise is great when i confess who the real author is no one would ever believe the spider capable of constructing such a monument it goes without saying that in a state of liberty on our barren wastelands the ly cosa does not indulge in such sumptuous architecture i have given the reason she is too great a stayathome to go in search of materials and she makes use of the limited resources which she finds around her bits of earth small chips of stone a few twigs a few withered grasses that is all or nearly all wherefore the work is generally quite modest and reduced to a parapet that hardly attracts attention my captives teach us that when materials are plentiful especially textile materials that remove all fears of landslip the lycosa de lights in tall turrets she understands the art of donjonbuilding and puts it into practice as often as she possesses the means this art is akin to another from which it is apparently derived if the sun be fierce or if rain threaten the lycosa closes the en trance to her dwelling with a silken trellis work wherein she embeds different matters often the remnants of victims which she has devoured the ancient gael nailed the heads of his vanquished enemies to the door of his hut in the same way the fierce spider sticks the skulls of her prey into the lid of her cave these lumps look very well on the ogres roof but we must be careful not to mistake them for warlike trophies the ani mal knows nothing of our barbarous bravado everything at the threshold of the burrow is used indiscriminately fragments of locust vegetable remains and especially particles of earth a dragonflys head baked by the sun is as good as a bit of gravel and no better and so with silk and all sorts of tiny materials the lycosa builds a lidded cap to the entrance of her home i am not well ac quainted with the reasons that prompt her to barricade herself indoors particularly as the seclusion is only temporary and varies greatly in duration i obtain precise details from a tribe of lycosae wherewith the enclosure as will be seen later happens to be thronged in consequence of my investigations into the dis persal of the family at the time of the tropical august heat i see my lycosae now this batch now that building at the entrance to the burrow a con vex ceiling which is difficult to distinguish from the surrounding soil can it be to pro tect themselves from the toovivid light this is doubtful for a few days later though the power of the sun remain the same the roof is broken open and the spider re appears at her door where she revels in the torrid heat of the dogdays later when october comes if it be rainy weather she retires once more under a roof as though she were guarding herself against the damp let us not be too positive of any thing however often when it is raining hard the spider bursts her ceiling and leaves her house open to the skies perhaps the lid is only put on for serious domestic events notably for the laying i do in fact perceive young lycosse who shut themselves in before they have attained the dignity of motherhood and who reappear some time later with the bag containing the eggs hung to their stem the inference that they close the door with the object of securing greater quiet while spinning the maternal cocoon would not be in keeping with the unconcern displayed by the majority i find some who lay their eggs in an open burrow i come upon some who weave their cocoon and cram it with eggs in the open air before they even own a residence in short i do not succeed in fathoming the reasons that cause the burrow to be closed no matter what the weather hot or cold wet or dry the fact remains that the lid is broken and repaired repeatedly sometimes on the same day in spite of the earthy casing the silk woof gives it the requisite pliancy to cleave when pushed by the anchorite and to rip open without falling into ruins swept back to the circumference of the mouth and increased by the wreckage of further ceilings it becomes a parapet which the lycosa raises by degrees in her long moments of leisure the bastion which surmounts the burrow therefore takes its origin from the temporary lid the tur ret derives from the split ceiling what is the purpose of this turret my pans will tell us that an enthusiastic votary of the chase so long as she is not permanently fixed the lycosa once she has set up house prefers to lie in ambush and wait for the quarry every day when the heat is great est i see my captives come up slowly from underground and lean upon the battlements of their woolly castlekeep they are then really magnificent in their stately gravity with their swelling belly contained within the aperture their head outside their glassy eyes staring their legs gathered for a spring for hours and hours they wait motionless bath ing voluptuously in the sun should a titbit to her liking happen to pass forthwith the watcher darts from her tall tower swift as an arrow from the bow with a daggerthrust in the neck she stabs the jugular of the locust dragonfly or other prey whereof i am the purveyor and she as quickly scales the donjon and retires with her capture the performance is a wonderful exhibition of skill and speed very seldom is a quarry missed provided that it pass at a convenient distance within the range of the huntress bound but if the prey be at some distance for instance on the wire of the cage the lycosa takes no notice of it scorning to go in pursuit she allows it to roam at will she never strikes except when sure of her stroke she achieves this by means of her tower hiding behind the wall she sees the stranger advancing keeps her eyes on him and suddenly pounces when he comes within reach these abrupt tactics make the thing a certainty though he were winged and swift of flight the un wary one who approaches the ambush is lost this presumes it is true an exemplary patience on the lycosas part for the burrow has naught that can serve to entice victims at best the ledge provided by the turret may at rare intervals tempt some weary wayfarer to use it as a restingplace but if the quarry do not come today it is sure to come tomorrow the qext day or later for the locusts hop innumerable in the waste land nor are they always able to regulate their leaps some day or other chance is bound to bring one of them within the pur lieus of the burrow this is the moment to spring upon the pilgrim from the ramparts until then we maintain a stoical vigilance we shall dine when we can but we shall end by dining the lycosa therefore well aware of these lingering eventualities waits and is not unduly distressed by a prolonged abstinence she has an accommodating stomach which is satisfied to be gorged today and to remain empty afterwards for goodness knows how long i have sometimes neglected my cater ingduties for weeks at a time and my boarders have been none the worse for it after a more or less protracted fast they do not pine away but are smitten with a wolf like hunger all these ravenous eaters are alike they guzzle to excess today in antici pation of tomorrows dearth in her youth before she has a burrow the lycosa earns her living in another manner clad in grey like her elders but without the blackvelvet apron which she receives on at taining the marriageable age she roams among the scrubby grass this is true hunt ing should a suitable quarry heave in sight the spider pursues it drives it from its shel ters follows it hotfoot the fugitive gains the heights makes as though to fly away he has not the time with an upward leap the lycosa grabs him before he can rise i am charmed with the agility wherewith my yearling boarders seize the flies which i provide for them in vain does the fly take refuge a couple of inches up on some blade of grass with a sudden spring into the air the spider pounces on the prey no cat is quicker in catching her mouse but these are the feats of youth not handi capped by obesity later when a heavy paunch dilated with eggs and silk has to be trailed along those gymnastic performances become impracticable the lycosa then digs herself a settled abode a huntingbox and sits in her watchtower on the lookout for game when and how is the burrow obtained wherein the lycosa once a vagrant now a stayathome is to spend the remainder of her long life we arc in autumn the weather is already turning cool this is how the field cricket sets to work as long as the days are fine and the nights not too cold the future chorister of spring rambles over the fallows careless of a local habitation at critical moments the cover of a dead leaf provides him with a temporary shelter in the end the burrow the permanent dwell ing is dug as the inclement season draws nigh the lycosa shares the crickets views like him she finds a thousand pleasures in the vagabond life with september comes the nuptial badge the blackvelvet bib the spiders meet at night by the soft moon light they romp together they eat the be loved shortly after the wedding by day they scour the country they track the game on the shortpile grassy carpet they take their fill of the joys of the sun that is much better than solitary meditation at the bottom of a well and so it is not rare to see young mothers dragging their bag of eggs or even already carrying their family and as yet with out a home in october it is time to settle down wc then in fact find two sorts of burrows whidi differ in diameter the larger bottle neck burrows belong to the old matrons who have owned their house for two years at least the smaller of the width of a thick leadpencil contain the young mothers bom that year by dint of long and leisurely alterations the novices earths will increase in depth as well as in diameter and become roomy abodes similar to those of the grand mothers in both we find the owner and her family the latter sometimes already hatched and sometimes still enclosed in the satin wallet seeing no diggingtools such as the excava tion of the dwelling seemed to me to require i wondered whether the lycosa might not avail herself of some chance gallery the work of the cicada or the earthworm this ready made tunnel thought i must shorten the labours of the spider who appears to be so badly off for tools she would only have to enlarge it and put it in order i was wrong the burrow is excavated from start to finish by her unaided labour then where are the diggingimplements we think of the legs of the claws we think of them but reflection tells us that tools such as these would not do they are too long and too difficult to wield in a confined space what is required is the miners shorthandled pick wherewith to drive hard to insert to lever and to extract what is required is the sharp point that enters the earth and crumbles it into fragments there remain the ly cosas fangs delicate weapons which we at first hesitate to associate with such work so illogical does it seem to dig a pit with surgeons scalpels the fangs are a pair of sharp curved points which when at rest crook like a finger and take shelter between two strong pillars the cat sheathes her claws under the velvet of the paw to preserve their edge and sharp ness in the same way the lycosa protects her poisoned daggers by folding them within the case of two powerful columns which come plumb on the surface and contain the muscles that work them well this surgical outfit intended for stabbing the jugular artery oif the prey sud denly becomes a pickaxe and does rough navvys work to witness the underground digging is impossible but we can at least with the exercise of a little patience see the rubbish carted away if i watch my cap tives without tiring at a very early hour  for the work takes place mostly at night and at long intervals  in the end i catch them coming up with a load contrary to what i expected the legs take no part in the carting it is the mouth that acts as the barrow a tiny ball of earth is held between the fangs and is supported by the palpi or feelers which are little arms employed in the service of the mouthparts the lycosa descends cautiously from her turret goes to some distance to get rid of her burden and quickly dives down again to bring up more we have seen enough we know that the lycosas fangs those lethal weapons are not afraid to bite into clay and gravel they knead the excavated rubbish into pellets take up the mass of earth and carry it outside the rest follows naturally it is the fangs that dig delve and extract how finelytempered they must be not to be blunted by this well sinkers work and to do duty presently in the surgical operation of stabbing the neck i have said that the repairs and extensions of the burrow are made at long intervals from time to time the circular parapet re ceives additions and becomes a little higher less frequently still the dwelling is enlarged and deepened as a rule the mansion re mains as it was for a whole season towards the end of winter in march more than at any other period the lycosa seems to wish to give herself a little more space this is the moment to subject her to certain tests we know that the field cricket when re moved from his burrow and caged under conditions that would allow him to dig him self a new home should the fit seize him prefers to tramp from one casual shelter to another or rather abandons every idea of creating a permanent residence there is a short season whereat the instinct for build ing a subterranean gallery is imperatively aroused when this season is past the ex cavating artist if accidentally deprived of his abode becomes a wandering bohemian care less of a lodging he has forgotten his talents and he sleeps out that the bird the nestbuilder should neg lect its art when it has no brood to care for is perfectly logical it builds for its family not for itself but what shall we say of the cricket who is exposed to a thousand mis haps when away from home the protec tion of a roof would be of great use to him and the giddypate does not give it a thought though he is very strong and more capable than ever of digging with his powerful jaws what reason can we allege for this neglect none unless it be that the season of strenuous burrowing is past the instincts have a calendar of their own at the given hour suddenly they awaken as suddenly afterwards they fall asleep the ingenious become incompetent when the prescribed period is ended on a subject of this kind we can consult the spider of the wastelands i catch an old lycosa in the fields and house her that same day under wire in a burrow where i have prepared a soil to her liking if by my con trivances and with a bit of reed i have previously moulded a burrow roughly repre senting the one from which i took her the spider enters it forthwith and seems pleased with her new residence the product of my art is accepted as her lawful property and undergoes hardly any alterations in course of time a bastion is erected around the ori fice the top of the gallery is cemented with silk and that is all in this establishment of my building the animals behaviour remains what it would be under natural conditions but place the lycosa on the surface of the ground without first shaping a burrow what will the homeless spider do dig her self a dwelling one would think she has the strength to do so she is in the prime of life besides the soil is similar to that whence i ousted her and suits the operation perfectly we therefore expect to see the spider settled before long in a shaft of her own construction we are disappointed weeks pass and not an effort is made not one demoralised by the absence of an ambush the lycosa hardly vouchsafes a glance at the game which i serve up the crickets pass within her reach in vain most often she scorns them she slowly wastes away with fasting and bore dom at length she dies take up your miners trade again poor fool i make yourself a home since you know how to and life will be sweet to you for many a long day yet the weather is fine and victuals plentiful dig delve go under ground where safety lies like an idiot you refrain and you perish why because the craft which you were wont to ply is forgotten because the days of patient digging are past and your poor brain is un able to work back to do a second time what has been done already is beyond your wit for all your meditative air you cannot solve the problem of how to reconstruct that which is vanished and gone let us now see what we can do with younger lycoss who are at the burrowing stage i dig out five or six at the end of february they are half the size of the old ones their burrows are equal in diameter to my little finger rubbish freshly spread around the pit bears witness to the recent date of the excavations relegated to their wire cages these young lycoss behave differently according as the soil placed at their disposal is or is not al ready provided with a burrow made by me a burrow is hardly the word i give them but the nucleus of a shaft about an inch deep to lure them on when in possession of this rudimentary lair the spider does not hesitate to pursue the work which i have in terrupted in the fields at night she digs with a will i can see this by the heap of rubbish flung aside she at last obtains a house to suit her a house surmounted by the usual turret the others on the contrary those for whom the thrust of my pencil has not con trived an entrancehall representing to a cer tain extent the natural gallery whence i dis lodged them absolutely refuse to work and they die not withstanding the abundance of provisions they first pursue the seasons task they were digging when i caught them and car ried away by the enthusiasm of their activity they go on digging inside my cages taken in by my decoyshaft they deepen the imprint of the pencil as though they were deepening their real vestibule they do not begin their labours over again they continue them the second not having this inducement this semblance of a burrow mistaken for their own work forsake the idea of digging and allow themselves to die because they would have to travel back along the chain of actions and to resume the pickstrokes of the start to begin all over again requires reflection a quality wherewith they are not endowed to the insect  and we have seen this in many earlier cases  what is done is done and cannot be taken up again the hands of a watch do not move backwards the insect behaves in much the same way its activity urges it in one direction ever forwards with out allowing it to retrace its steps even when an accident makes this necessary what the masonbees and the others taught us erewhile the lycosa now confirms in her manner incapable of taking fresh pains to build herself a second dwelling when the first is done for she will go on the tramp she will break into a neighbours house she will run the risk of being eaten should she not prove the stronger but she will never think of making herself a home by starting afresh what a strange intellect is that of the animal a mixture of mechanical routine and subtle brainpower does it contain gleams that contrive wishes that pursue a definite object following in the wake of so many others the lycosa warrants us in entertaining a doubt tor three weeks and more the lycosa trails the bag of eggs hanging to her spinnerets the reader will remember the ex periments described in the third chapter of this volume particularly those with the cork ball and the thread pellet which the spider so fool ishly accepts in exchange for the real pill well this exceedingly dullwitted mother sat isfied with aught that knocks against her heels is about to make us wonder at her devotion whether she come up from her shaft to lean upon the kerb and bask in the sun whether she suddenly retire underground in the face of danger or whether she be roaming the country before settling down never does she let go her precious bag that very cumbrous burden in walking climbing or leaping if by some accident it become detached from the fastening to which it is hung she flings herself madly on her treasure and lovingly embraces it ready to bite whoso would take it from her i myself am sometimes the thief i then hear the points of the poisonfangs grinding against the steel of my pincers which tug in one direction while the lycosa tugs in the other but let us leave the animal alone with a quick touch of the spinnerets the pill is re stored to its place and the spider strides off still menacing towards the end of summer all the house holders old or young whether in captivity on the windowsill or at liberty in the paths of the enclosure supply me daily with the following improving sight in the morning as soon as the sun is hot and beats upon their burrow the anchorites come up from the bottom with their bag and station themselves at the opening long siestas on the threshold in the sun are the order of the day throughout the fine season but at the present time the position adopted is a different one formerly the lycosa came out into the sun for htt own sake leaning on the parapet she had the front half of her body outside the pit and the hinder half inside the eyes took their fill of light the belly re mained in the dark when carrying her egg bag the spider reverses the posture the front is in the pit the rear outside with her hind legs she holds the white pill bulging with germs lifted above the entrance gently she turns and returns it so as to present every side to the lifegiving rays and this goes on for half the day as long as the temperature is high and it is repeated daily with exquisite patience during three or four weeks to hatch its eggs the bird covers them with the quilt of its breast it strains them to the fur nace of its heart the lycosa turns hers in front of the hearth of hearths she gives them the sun as an incubator in the early days of september the young ones who have been some time hatched are ready to come out the pill rips open along the middle fold we read of the origin of this fold in an earlier chapter does the mother feeling the brood quicken inside the satin wrapper herself break open the vessel at the opportune moment it seems probable on the other hand there may be a spontaneous bursting such as we shall see later in the banded epeiras balloon a tough wallet which opens a breach of its own accord long after the mother has ceased to exist chapter iii of the present volume  translators note the whole family emerges from the bag straightway then and there the youngsters climb to the mothers back as for the empty bag now a worthless shred it is flung out of the burrow the lycosa does not give it a fur ther thought huddled together sometimes in two or three layers according to their num ber the little ones cover the whole back of the mother who for seven or eight months to come will carry her family night and day nowhere can we hope to see a more edifying domestic picture than that of the lycosa clothed in her young from time to time i meet a little band of gipsies passing along the highroad on their way to some neighbouring fair the new bom babe mewls on the mothers breast in a hammock formed out of a kerchief the last weaned is carried pickaback a third tod dles clinging to its mothers skirts others fol low closely the biggest in the rear ferreting in the blackberryladen hedgerows it is a magnificent spectacle of happygolucky fruit fulness they go their way penniless and re joicing the sun is hot and the earth is fertile but how this picture pales before that of the lycosa that incomparable gipsy whose brats are numbered by the hundred and one and ail of them from september to april without a moments respite find room upon the patient creatures back where they are content to lead a tranquil life and to be carted about the little ones are very good none moves none seeks a quarrel with his neighbours clinging together they form a continuous drapery a shaggy ulster under which the mother becomes unrecognizable is it an ani mal a fluff of wool a cluster of small seeds fastened to one another tis impossible to tell at the first glance the equilibrium of this living blanket is not so firm but that falls often occur especially when the mother climbs from indoors and comes to the threshold to let the little ones take the sun the least brush against the gal lery unseats a part of the family the mishap is not serious the hen fidgeting about her chicks looks for the strays calls them gath ers them together the lycosa knows not these maternal alarms impassively she leaves those who drop off to manage their own dif ficulty which they do with wonderful quick ness commend me to those youngsters for getting up without whining dusting them selves and resuming their seat in the saddle i the unhorsed ones promptly find a leg of the mother the usual climbingpole they swarm up it ais fast as they can and recover their places on the bearers back the living bark of animals is reconstructed in the twinkling of an eye to speak here of motherlove were i think extravagant the lycosas affection for her offspring hardly surpasses that of the plant which is unacquainted with any tender feeling and nevertheless bestows the nicest and most delicate care upon its seeds the animal in many cases knows no other sense of motherhood what cares the lycosa for her brood she accepts anothers as readily as her own she is satisfied so long as her back is burdened with a swarming crowd whether it issue from her ovaries or elsewhence there is no question here of real maternal affection i have described elsewhere the prowess of the copris watching over cells that are not a species of dungbeetle cf the life and love of the insect by j henri fabre translated by alexander teixeira de mattos chap v  translators note her handiwork and do not contain her off spring with a zeal which even the addi tional labour laid upon her does not easily weary she removes the mildew from the alien dungballs which far exceed the regular nests in number she gently scrapes and polishes and repairs them she listens to them attentively and enquires by ear into each nurslings prog ress her real collection could not receive greater care her own family or anothers it is all one to her the lycosa is equally indifferent i take a hairpencil and sweep the living burden from one of my spiders making it fall close to another covered with her little ones the evicted youngsters scamper about find the new mothers legs outspread nimbly clamber up these and mount on the back of the oblig ing creature who quietly lets them have their way they slip in among the others or when the layer is too thick push to the front and pass from the abdomen to the thorax and even to the head though leaving the region of the eyes uncovered it does not do to blind the bearer the common safety de mands that they know this and respect the lenses of the eyes however populous the as sembly be the whole animal is now covered with a swarming carpet of young all except the legs which must preserve their freedom of action and the under part of the body where contact with the ground is to be feared my pencil forces a third family upon the al ready overburdened spider and this too is peacefully accepted the youngsters huddle up closer lie one on top of the other in layers and room is found for all the lycosa has lost the last semblance of an animal has be come a nameless bristling thing that walks about falls are frequent and are followed by continual climbings i perceive that i have reached the limits not of the bearers goodwill but of equilibrium the spider would adopt an indefinite further number of foundlings if the dimensions of her back afforded them a firm hold let us be content with this let us restore each family to its mother drawing at random from the lot there must necessarily be interchanges but that is of no importance real children and adopted children are the same thing in the lycosas eyes one would like to know if apart from my artifices in circumstances where i do not in terferc the goodnatured drynurse sometimes burdens herself with a supplementary family it would also be interesting to learn what comes of this association of lawful offspring and strangers i have ample materials where with to obtain an answer to both questions i have housed in the same cage two elderly matrons laden with youngsters each has her home as far removed from the other as the size of the common pan permits the distance is nine inches or more it is not enough prox imity soon kindles fierce jealousies between those intolerant creatures who are obliged to live far apart so as to secure adequate hunt inggrounds one morning i catch the two harridans fighting out their quarrel on the floor the loser is laid flat upon her back the victress belly to belly with her adversary clutches her with her legs and prevents her from moving a limb both have their poison fangs wide open ready to bite without yet daring so mutually formidable are they after a certain period of waiting during which the pair merely ex change threats the stronger of the two the one on top closes her lethal engine and grinds the head of the prostrate foe then she calmly devours the deceased by small mouth fuls now what do the youngsters do while their mother is being eaten easily consoled heed less of the atrocious scene they climb on the conquerors back and quietly take their places among the lawful family the ogress raises no objection accepts them as her own she makes a meal off the mother and adopts the orphans let us add that for many months yet until the final emancipation comes she will carry them without drawing any distinction between them and her own young henceforth the two families united in so tragic a fashion will form but one we see how greatly out of place it would be to speak in this connection of motherlove and its fond manifestations does the lycosa at least feed the young lings who for seven months swarm upon her back does she invite them to the banquet when she has secured a prize i thought so at first and anxious to assist at the family re past i devoted special attention to watching the mothers eat as a rule the prey is consumed out of sight in the bur row but sometimes also a meal is taken on the threshold in the open air besides it is easy to rear the lycosa and her family in a wiregauze cage with a layer of earth where in the captive will never dream of sinking a well such work being out of season every thing then happens out of doors well while the mother munches chews ex presses the juices and swallows the youngsters do not budge from their campingground on her back not one quits its place nor gives a sign of wishing to slip down and join in the meal nor does the mother extend an invitation to them to come and recruit them selves nor put any broken victuals aside for them she feeds and the others look on or rather remain indifferent to what is happen ing their perfect quiet during the lycosas feast points to the possession of a stomach that knows no cravings then with what are they sustained during their seven months upbringing on the moth ers back one conceives a notion of exuda tions supplied by the bearers body in which case the young would feed on their mother after the manner of parasitic vermin and gradually drain her strength we must abandon this notion never ar they seen to put tlieir mouths to the skin that should be a sort of teat to them on the other hand the lycosa far from being exhausted and shrivelling keeps perfectly well and plump she has the same potbelly when she finishes rearing her young as when she began she has not lost weight far from it on the contrary she has put on flesh she has gained the wherewithal to beget a new family next summer one as numerous as todays once more with what do the little ones keep up their strength we do not like to suggest reserves supplied by the egg as recti fying the beasties expenditure of vital force especially when we consider that those re serves themselves so close to nothing must be econom in view of the silk a material of the highest importance of which a plenti ful use will be made presently there must be other powers at play in the tiny animals machinery total abstinence from food could be under stood if it were accompanied by inertia im mobility is not life but the young lycosac although usually quiet on their mothers back are at all times ready for exercise and for agile swarming when they fall from the ma temal perambulator they briskly pick them selves up briskly scramble up a leg and make their way to the top it is a splendidly nim ble and spirited performance besides once seated they have to keep a firm balance in the mass they have to stretch and stiffen their little limbs in order to hang on to their neigh bours as a matter of fact there is no abso lute rest for them now physiology teaches us that not a fibre works without some ex penditure of energy the animal which can be likened in no small measure to our indus trial machines demands on the one hand the renovation of its organism which wears out with movement and on the other the mainte nance of the heat transformed into action we can compare it with the locomotiveen gine as the iron horse performs its work it gradually wears out its pistons its rods its wheels its boilertubes all of which have to be made good from time to time the founder and the smith repair it supply it so to speak with plastic food the food that becomes embodied with the whole and forms part of it but though it have just come from the engine shop it is still inert to acquire the power of movement it must receive from the stoker a supply of energyproducing food in other words he lights a few shovelfuls of coal in its inside this heat will produce mechan ical work even so with the beast as nothing is made from nothing the egg supplies first the materials of the newbom animal then the plastic food the smith of living creatures in creases the body up to a certain limit and re news it as it wears away the stoker works at the same time without stopping fuel the source of energy makes but a short stay in the system where it is consumed and fur nishes heat whence movement is derived life is a firebox warmed by its food the animal machine moves walks runs jumps swims flies sets its locomotory apparatus going in a thousand manners to return to the young lycosae they grow no larger until the period of their emancipa tion i find them at the age of seven months the same as when i saw them at their birth the egg supplied the materials necessary for their tiny frames and as the loss of waste substance is for the moment excessively small or even nil additional plastic food is not needed so long as the beastie does not grow in this respect the prolonged abstinence pre sents no difficulty but there remains the ques tion of energyproducing food which is indis pensable for the little lycosa moves when necessary and very actively at that to what shall we attribute the heat expended upon ac tion when the animal takes absolutely no x nourishment an idea suggests itself we say to our r selves that without being life a machine is something more than matter for man has added a little of his mind to it now the iron beast consuming its ration of coal is really r browsing the ancient foliage of arborescent e ferns in which solar energy has accumulated g e g beasts of flesh and blood act no otherwise po whether they mutually devour one another j i or levy tribute on the plant they invariably quicken themselves with the stimulant of the z suns heat a heat stored in grass fruit seed and those which feed on such the sun the cd z soul of the universe is the supreme dispenser of energy instead of being served up through the in termediary of food and passing through the ignominious circuit of gastric chemistry  i could not this solar energy penetrate the ani mal directly and charge it with activity even as the battery charges an accumulator with power why not live on sun seeing that after all we find naught but sun in the fruits which we consume chemical science that bold revolutionary promises to provide us with synthetic food stuffs the laboratory and the factory will take the place of the farm why should not physical science step in as well it would leave the preparation of plastic food to the chemists retorts it would reserve for itself that of energyproducing food which reduced to its exact terms ceases to be matter with the aid of some ingenious apparatus it would pump into us our daily ration of solar energy to be later expended in movement whereby the machine would be kept going without the often painful assistance of the stomach and its adjuncts what a delightful world where one would lunch off a ray of sunshine i is it a dream or the anticipation of a re mote reality the problem is one of the most important that science can set us let us first hear the evidence of the young lycosx regarding its possibilities for seven months without any material nourishment they expend strength in moving to wind up the mechanism of their muscles they recruit themselves direct with heat and light during the time when she was drag ging the bag of eggs behind her the mother at the best moments of the day came and held up her pill to the sun with her two hind legs she lifted it out of the ground into the full light slowly she turned it and returned it so that every side might receive its share of the vivifying rays well this bath of life which awakened the germs is now prolonged to keep the tender babes active daily if the sky be clear the lycosa car rying her young comes up ifrom the burrow leans on the kerb and spends long hours bask ing in the sun here on their mothers back the youngsters stretch their limbs delightedly saturate themselves with heat take in reserves of motor power absorb energy they are motionless but if i only blow upon them they stampede as nimbly as though a hurricane were passing hurriedly they dis perse hurriedly they reassemble a proof that without material nourishment the little animal machine is always at full pressure ready to work when the shade comes mother and sons go down again surfeited with solar emanations the feast of energy at the sun tavern is finished for the day it is re peated in the same way daily if the weather be mild until the hour of emancipation comes followed by the first mouthfuls of solid food the month of march comes to an end and the departure of the youngsters begins in glorious weather during the hottest hours of the morning laden with her swarm ing burden the mother lycosa is outside her burrow squatting on the parapet at the en trance she lets them do as they please as though indifferent to what is happening she exhibits neither encouragement nor regret whoso will goes whoso will remains behind first these then those according as they feel themselves duly soaked with sunshine the little ones leave the mother in batches run about for a moment on the ground and then quickly reach the trelliswork of the cage which they climb with surprising alacrity they pass through the meshes they clamber right to the top of the citadel all with not one exception make for the heights instead of roaming on the ground as might be reason ably be expected from the eminently earthly habits of the lycoss all ascend the dome a strange procedure whereof i do not yet guess the object i receive a hint from the upright ring that finishes the top of the cage the youngsters hurry to it it represents the porch of their gymnasium they hang out threads across the opening they stretch others from the ring to the nearest points of the trel liswork on these footbridges they perform slackrope exercises amid endless comings and goings the tiny legs open out from time to time and straddle as though to reach the most distant points i begin to realize that they are acrobats aiming at loftier heights than those of the dome i top the trellis with a branch that doubles the attainable height the bustling crowd hastily scrambles up it reaches the tip of the topmost twigs and thence sends out threads that attach themselves to every surrounding object these form so many suspension bridges and my beasties nimbly run along them incessantly passing to and fro one would say that they wished to climb higher still i will endeavour to satisfy their desires i take a ninefoot reed with tiny branches spreading right up to the top and place it above the cage the little lycosae clamber to the very summit here longer threads are produced from the ropeyard and are now left to float anon converted into bridges by the mere contact of the free end with the neighbouring supports the ropedancers em bark upon them and form garlands which the least breath of air swings daintily the thread is invisible when it does not come be tween the eyes and the sun and the whole sug gests rows of gnats dancing an aerial ballet then suddenly teased by the aircurrents the delicate mooring breaks and flies through space behold the emigrants of and away clinging to their thread if the wind be fa vourable they can land at great distances their departure is thus continued for a week or two in bands more or less numerous ac cording to the temperature and the brightness of the day if the sky be overcast none dreams of leaving the travellers need the kisses of the sun which give energy and vigour at last the whole family has disappeared carried afar by its flyingropes the mother remains alone the loss of her offspring hardly seems to distress her she retains her usual colour and plumpness which is a sign that the maternal exertions have not been too much for her i also notice an increased fervour in the chase while burdened with her family she was remarkably abstemious accepting only with great reserve the game placed at her disposal the coldness of the season may have militated against copious refections per haps also the weight of the little ones ham pered her movements and made her more dis creet in attacking the prey today cheered by the fine weather and able to move freely she hurries up from her lair each time i set a titbit to her liking buzz ing at the entrance of her burrow she comes and takes from my fingers the savoury locust the portly anoxia and this performance is repeated daily whenever i have the leisure to devote to it after a frugal winter the time has come for plentiful repasts this appetite tells us that the animal is not at the point of death one does not feast in this way with a playedout stomach my boarders are entering in full vigour upon their a species of beetlestranslators note fourth year in the winter in the fields i used to find large mothers carting their young and others not much more than half their size the whole series therefore repre sented three generations and now in my earthenware pans after the departure of the family the old matrons still carry on and con tinue as strong as ever every outward ap pearance tells us that after becoming great grandmothers they still keep themselves fit for propagating their species the facts correspond with these anticipa tions when september returns my captives are dragging a bag as bulky as that of last year for a long time even when the eggs of the others have been hatched for some weeks past the mothers come daily to the threshold of the burrow and hold out their wallets for incubation by the sun their perseverance is not rewarded nothing issues from the satin purse nothing stirs within why because in the prison of my cages the eggs have had no father tired of waiting and at last recog nizing the barrenness of their produce they push the bag of eggs outside the burrow and trouble about it no more at the return of spring by which time the family if developed according to rule would have been emanci pated they die the mighty spider of the wastelands therefore attains to an even more patriarchal age than her neighbour the sacred beetle she lives for five years at the very least let us leave the mothers to their business and return to the youngsters it is not with out a certain surprise that we see the little lycosae at the first moment of their emanci pation hasten to ascend the heights destined to live on the ground amidst the short grass and afterwards to settle in their permanent abode a pit they start by being enthusiastic acrobats before descending to the low levels their normal dwellingplace they affect lofty altitudes to rise higher and ever higher is their first need i have not it seems exhausted the limit of their climbinginstinct even with a ninefoot pole suitably furnished with branches to facilitate the escalade those who have eagerly reached the very top wave cf insect life by j h fabre translated by the au thor of mademoiselle mori chaps i and ii the life and love of the insect by j henri fabre translated by alexander teixeira de mattos chaps i to iv  translators note their legs fumble in space as though for yet higher stalks it behoves us to begin again and under better conditions although the narbonne lycosa with her temporary yearning for the heights is more interesting than other spiders by reason of the fact that her usual habitat is under ground she is not so striking at swarming time because the youngsters instead of all mi grating at once leave the mother at different periods and in small batches the sight will be a finer one with the common garden or cross spider the diadem epeira epeira diadema lin decorated with three white crosses on her back she lays her eggs in november and dies with the first cold snap she is denied the ly cosas longevity she leaves the natal wallet early one spring and never sees the following spring this wallet which contains the eggs has none of the ingenious structure which we admired in the banded and in the silky epeira no longer do we see a graceful bal loonshape nor yet a paraboloid with a starry base no longer a tough waterproof satin stuff no longer a swansdown resembling a fleecy russet doud no longer an inner keg in which the eggs are packed the art of stout fabrics and of walls within walls is unknown here the work of the cross spider is a pill of white silk wrought into a yielding felt through which the newbom spiders will eas ily work their way without the aid of the mother long since dead and without having to rely upon its bursting at the given hour it is about the size of a damson we can judge the method of manufacture from the structure like the lycosa whom we saw in chapter iii at work in one of my earthenware pans the gross spider on the support supplied by a few threads stretched between the nearest objects begins by making a shallow saucer of sufficient thickness to dis pense with subsequent corrections the proc ess is easily guessed the tip of the abdomen goes up and down down and up with an even beat while the worker shifts her place a little each time the spinnerets add a bit of thread to the carpet already made when the requisite thickness is obtained the mother empties her ovaries in one continuous flow into the centre of the bowl glued to gether by their inherent moisture the eggs of a handsome orangeyellow form a ball shaped heap the work of the spinnerets is resumed the ball of germs is covered with a silk cap fashioned in the same way as the saucer the two halves of the work are so well joined that the whole constitutes an un broken sphere the banded epeira and the silky epeira those experts in the manufacture of rainproof textures lay their eggs high up on brush wood and bramble without shelter of any kind the thick material of the wallets is enough to protect the eggs from the inclemen cies of the winter especially from damp the diadem epeira or cross spider needs a cranny for hers which is contained in a non waterproof felt in a heap of stones well ex posed to the sun she will choose a large slab to serve as a roof she lodges her pill un derneath it in the company of the hibernating snail more often still she prefers the thick tangle of some dwarf shrub standing eight or nine inches high and retaining its leaves in winter in the absence of anything better a tuft of grass answers the purpose whatever the hidingplace the bag of eggs is always near the ground tucked away as well as may be amid the surrounding twigs save in the case of the roof supplied by a large stone we see that the site selected hardly satisfies proper hygienic needs the epeira seems to realize this fact by way of an addi tional protection even under a stone she never fails to make a thatched roof for her eggs she builds them a covering with bits of fine dry grass joined together with a little silk the abode of the eggs becomes a straw wigwam good luck procures me two cross spiders nests on the edge of one of the paths in the enclosure among some tufts of ground cypress or lavendercotton this is just what i wanted for my plans the find is all the more valuable as the period of the exodus is near at hand i prepare two lengths of bamboo standing about fifteen feet high and clustered with lit tle twigs from top to bottom i plant one of them straight up in the tuft beside the first nest i clear the surrounding ground because the bushy vegetation might easily thanks to threads carried by the wind divert the emi grants from the road which i have laid out for them the other bamboo i set up in the middle of the yard all by itself some few steps from any outstanding object the sec ond nest is removed as it is shrub and all and placed at the bottom of the tall ragged distaff the events expected are not long in com ing in the first fortnight in may a little earlier in one case a little later in the other the two families each presented with a bam boo climbingpole leave their respective wal lets there is nothing remarkable about the mode of egress the precincts to be crossed consist of a very slack network through which the outcomers wriggle weak little orangeyellow beasties with a triangular black patch upon their sterns one morning is long enough for the whole family to make its ap pearance by degrees the emancipated youngsters climb the nearest twigs clamber to the top and spread a few threads soon they gather in a compact ballshaped cluster the size of a walnut they remain motionless with their heads plunged into the heap and their stems projecting they doze gently mellowing under the kisses of the sun rich in the posses sion of a thread in dieir belly as dieir sole inheritance they prepare to disperse over the wide world let us create a disturbance among the glob ular group by stirring it with a straw all wake up at once the cluster softly dilates and spreads as though set in motion by some centrifugal force it becomes a transparent orb wherein thousands and thousands of tiny legs quiver and shake while threads are ex tended along the way to be followed the whole work resolves itself into a delicate veil which swallows up the scattered family we then see an exquisite nebula against whose opalescent tapestry the tiny animals gleam like twinkling orange stars this straggling state though it last for hours is but temporary if the air grow cooler if rain threaten the spherical group reforms at once this is a protective meas ure on the morning after a shower i find the families on either bamboo in as good condition as on the day before the silk veil and the pill formation have sheltered them well enough from the downpour even so do sheep when caught in a storm in the pastures gather close huddle together and make a common rampart of their backs the assembly into a ballshaped mass is also the rule in calm bright weather after the mornings exertions in the afternoon the climbers collect at a higher point where they weave a wide conical tent with the end of a shoot for its top and gathered into a com pact group spend the night there next day when the heat returns the ascent is resumed in long files following the shrouds which a few pioneers have rigged and which those who come after elaborate with their own work assembled nightly into a globular troop and sheltered under a fresh tent for three or four days each morning before the sun grows too hot my little emigrants thus raise them selves stage by stage on both bamboos until they reach the summit at fifteen feet above the ground the climb comes to an end for lack of foothold under normal conditions the ascent would be shorter the young spiders have at their disposal the bushes the brushwood providing supports on every side for the threads wafted hither and thither by the eddying aircurrents with these ropebridges flung across space the dispersal presents no difficulties each emi grant leaves at his own good time and travels as suits him best my devices have changed these conditions somewhat my two bristling poles stand at a distance from the surrounding shrubs espe cially the one which i planted in the middle of the yard bridges are out of the question for the threads flung into the air are not long enough and so the acrobats eager to get away keep on climbing never come down again are impelled to seek in a higher posi tion what they have failed to find in a lower the top of my two bamboos probably fails to represent the limit of what my keen climbers are capable of achieving we shall see in a moment the object of this climbingpropensity which is a sufficiently remarkable instinct in the garden spiders who have as their domain the lowgrowing brushwood wherein the nets are spread it be comes a still more remarkable instinct in the lycosa who except at the moment when she leaves her mothers back never quits the ground and yet in the early hours of her life shows herself as ardent a wooer of high places as the young garden spiders let us consider the lycosa in particular in her at the moment of the exodus a sudden instinct arises to disappear as promptly and for ever a few hours later this is the climbinginstinct which is unknown to the adult and soon forgotten by the emancipated youngling doomed to wander homeless for many a long day upon the ground neither of them dreams of climbing to the top of a grassstalk the fullgrown spider hunts trapper fashion ambushed in her tower the young one hunts afoot through the scrubby grass in both cases there is no web and therefore no need for lofty contactpoints they are not allowed to quit the ground and climb the heights yet here we have the young lycosa wish ing to leave the maternal abode and to travel far afield by the easiest and swiftest methods suddenly becoming an enthusiastic climber impetuously she scales the wire trellis of the cage where she was bom hurriedly she clam bers to the top of the tall mast which i have prepared for her in the same way she would make for the summit of the bushes in her wasteland we catch a glimpse of her object from on high finding a wide space beneath her she sends a thread floating it is caught by the wind and carries her hanging to it we have our aeroplanes she too possesses her flying machine once the journey is accomplished naught remains of this ingenious business the climbinginstinct comes suddenly at the hour of need and no less suddenly vanishes seeds when ripened in the fruit are dis seminated that is to say scattered on the surface of the ground to sprout in spots as yet unoccupied and fill the expanses that realize favourable conditions amid the wayside rubbish grows one of the gourd family ecbalium elaterium commonly called the squirting cucumber whose fruit  a rough and extremely bitter little cucumber  is the size of a date when ripe the fleshy core resolves into a liquid in which float the seeds compressed by the elastic rind of the fruit this liquid bears upon the base of the footstalk which is gradually forced out yields like a stopper breaks off and leaves an orifice through which a stream of seeds and fluid pulp is suddenly ejected if with a novice hand under a scorching sun you shake the plant laden with yellow fruit you are bound to be somewhat startled when you hear a noise among the leaves and receive the cucumbers grapeshot in your face the fruit of the garden balsam when ripe splits at the least touch into five fleshy valves which curl up and shoot their seeds to a dis tance the botanical name of itnpatiens given to the balsam alludes to this sudden dehiscence of the capsules which cannot endure contact without bursting in the damp and shady places of the woods there exists a plant of the same family which for similar reasons bears the even more ex pressive name of itnpatiens nolimetangere or touchmenot the capsule of the pansy expands into three valves each scooped out like a boat and laden in the middle with two rows of seeds when these valves dry the edges shrivel up press upon the grains and eject them light seeds especially those of the order of compositae have aeronautic apparatus  tufts plumes flywheels  which keep them up in the air and enable them to take distant voy ages in ths way at the least breath the seeds of the dandelion surmounted by a tuft of feathers fly from their dry receptacle and waft gently in the air next to the tuft the wing is the most satis factory contrivance for dissemination by wind thanks to their membranous edge which gives them the appearance of thin scales the seeds of the yellow wallflower reach high cornices of buildings clefts of inaccessible rocks cran nies in old walls and sprout in the remnant of mould bequeathed by the mosses that were there before them the samaras or keys of the elm formed of a broad light fan with the seed cased in its centre those of the maple joined in pairs and resembling the unfurled wings of a bird those of the ash carved like the blade of an oar perform the most distant journeys when driven before the storm like the plant the insect also sometimes possesses travellingapparatus means of dis semination that allow large families to disperse quickly over the country so that each member may have his place in the sun without injuring his neighbour and these apparatus these methods vie in ingenuity with the elms samara the dande lionplume and the catapult of the squirting cucumber let us consider in particular the epeiras those magnificent spiders who to catch their prey stretch between one bush and the next great vertical sheets of meshes resembling those of the fowler the most remarkable in my district is the banded epeira epeira fas data walck so prettily belted with yel low black and silvery white her nest a mar vel of gracefulness is a satin bag shaped like a tiny pear its neck ends in a concave mouth piece closed with a lid also of satin brown ribbons in fanciful meridian waves adorn the object from pole to pole open the nest we have seen in an earlier chapter what we find there let us retell the story under the outer wrapper which is as stout as our woven stuffs and moreover per fectly waterproof is a russet eiderdown of ex quisite delicacy a silky fluff resembling driven smoke nowhere does motherlove prepare a softer bed in the middle of this downy mass hangs a fine silk thimbleshaped purse closed with a movable lid this contains the eggs of a pretty orangeyellow and about five hundred in number all things considered is not this charming chapter iltranslators note edifice an animal fruit a germcasket a cap sule to be compared with that of the plants only the epeiras wallet instead of seeds holds eggs the difference is more ap parent than real for egg and grain are one how will this living fruit ripening in the heat beloved of the cicadae manage to burst how above all will dissemination take place they are there in their hundreds they must separate go far away isolate themselves in a spot where there is not too much fear of competition among neighbours how will they set to work to achieve this distant exodus weaklings that they are taking such very tiny steps i receive the first answer from another and much earlier epeira whose family i find at the beginning of may on a yucca in the enclo sure the plant blossomed last year the branching flowerstem some three feet high still stands erect though withered on the green leaves shaped like a swordblade swarm two newlyhatched families the wee beasties are a dull yellow with a triangular black patch upon their stem later on three white crosses ornamenting the back will tell me that my find corresponds with the cross or diadem spider epeira diadetna walck when the sun reaches this part of the en closure one of the two groups falls into a great state of flutter nimble acrobats that they are the little spiders scramble up one after the other and reach the top of the stem here marches and countermarches tumult and confusion reign for there is a slight breeze which throws the troop into disorder i see no connected manoeuvres from the top of the stalk they set out at every moment one by one they dart off suddenly they fly away so to speak it is as though they had the wings of a gnat forthwith they disappear from view noth ing that my eyes can see explains this strange flight for precise observation is impossible amid the disturbing influences out of doors what is wanted is a peaceful atmosphere and the quiet of my study i gather the family in a large box which i close at once and instal it in the animals laboratory on a small table two steps from the open window apprised by what i have just seen of their propensity to resort to the heights i give my subjects a bundle of twigs eighteen inches tall as a climbingpole the whole band hurriedly clambers up and reaches the top in a few moments there is not one lacking in the group on high the future will tell us the reason of this assemblage on the projecting tips of the twigs the little spiders are now spinning here and there at random they go up go down come up again thus is woven a light veil of divergent threads a manycornered web with the end of the branch for its summit and the edge of the table for its base some eighteen inches wide this veil is the drillground the workyard where the preparations for de parture are made here hasten the humble little creatures running indefatigably to and fro when the sun shines upon them they become gleaming specks and form upon the milky background of the veil a sort of constellation a reflex of those remote points in the sky where the tele scope shows us endless galaxies of stars the immeasurably small and the immeasurably large are alike in appearance it is all a mat ter of distance but the living nebula is not composed of fixed stars on the contrary its specks are in continual movement the young spiders never cease shifting their position on the web many let themselves drop hanging by a length of thread which the fallers weight draws from the spinnerets then quickly they climb up again by the same thread which they wind gradually into a skein and lengthen by successive falls others confine themselves to running about the web and also give me the impression of working at a bundle of ropes the thread as a matter of fact does not flow from the spinneret it is drawn thence with a certain effort it is a case of extrac tion not emission to obtain her slender cord the spider has to move about and haul cither by falling or by walking even as the ropemaker steps backwards when working his hemp the activity now displayed on the drillground is a preparation for the approach ing dispersal the travellers are packing up soon we see a few spiders trotting briskly between the table and the open window they are running in midair but on what if the light fall favourably i manage to see at mo ments behind the tiny animal a thread resem bling a ray of light which appears for an in stant gleams and disappears behind there fore there is a mooring only just perceptible if you look very carefully but in front towards the window there is nothing to be seen at all in vain i examine above below at the side in vain i vary the direction of the eye i can distinguish no support for the little crea ture to walk upon one would think that the beastie were paddling in space it suggests the idea of a small bird tied by the leg with a thread and making a flying rush forwards but in this case appearances are deceptive flight is impossible die spider must necessa rily have a bridge whereby to cross the inter vening space this bridge which i cannot see i can at least destroy i cleave the air with a ruler in front of the spider making for the window that is quite enough the tiny animal at once ceases to go forward and falls the invisible footplank is broken my son young paul who is helping me is astounded at this wavr of the magic wand for not even he with his fresh young eyes is able to see a support ahead for the spiderling to move along in the rear on the other hand a thread is visible the difference is easily explained every spider as she goes at the same time spins a safetycord which will guard the rope walker against the risk of an always possible fall in the rear therefore the thread is of double thickness and can be seen whereas in front it is still single and hardly perceptible to the eye obviously this invisible footbridge is not flung out by the animal it is carried and un rolled by a gust of air the epeira supplied with this line lets it float freely and the wind however softly blowing bears it along and unwinds it even so is the smoke from the bowl of a pipe whirled up in the air this floating thread has but to touch any object in the neighbourhood and it will re main fixed to it the suspensionbridge is thrown and the spider can set out the southamericao indians are said to cross the abysses of the cordilleras in travellingcradles made of twisted creepers the little spider passes through space on the invisible and the imponderable but to carry the end of the floating thread elsewhither a draught is needed at this mo ment the draught exists between the door of my study and the window both of which are open it is so slight that i do not feel it i only know of it by the smoke from my pipe curling softly in that direction cold air enters from without through the door warm air escapes from the room through the win dow this is the draught that carries the threads with it and enables the spiders to em baric upon their journey i get rid of it by closing both apertures and i break off any communication by passing my ruler between the window and the table henceforth in the motionless atmosphere there are no departures the current of air is missing the skeins are not unwound and mi gration becomes impossible it is soon resumed but in a direction where of i never dreamt the hot sun is beating on a certain part of the floor at this spot which is warmer than the rest a column of lighter ascending air is generated if this column catch the threads my spiders ought to rise to the ceiling of the room the curious ascent does in fact take place unfortunately my troop which has been greatly reduced by the number of departures through the window does not lend itself to prolonged experiment we must begin again the next morning on the same yucca i gather the second family as numerous as the first yesterdays preparations are repeated my legion of spiders first weaves a divergent framework between the top of the brushwood placed at the emigrants disposal and the edge of the table five or six hundred wee beasties swarm all over this workyard while this little world is busily fussing making its arrangements for departure i make my own every aperture in the room is closed so as to obtain as calm an atmosphere as possible a small chafingdish is lit at the foot of the table my hands cannot feel the heat of it at the level of the web whereon my spiders are weaving this is the very modest fire which with its column of rising air shall unwind the threads and carry them on high let us first enquire the direction and strength of the current dandelionplumes made lighter by the removal of their seeds serve as my guides released above the cha fingdish on the level of the table they float slowly upwards and for the most part reach the ceiling the emigrants lines should rise in the same way and even better the thing is done with the aid of nothing that is visible to the three of us looking on a spider makes her ascent she ambles with her eight legs through the air she mounts gently swaying the others in everincreasing num bers follow sometimes by different roads sometimes by the same road any one who did not possess the secret would stand amazed at this magic ascent without a ladder in a few minutes most of them are up clinging to the ceiling not all of them reach it i see some who on attaining a certain height cease to go up and even lose ground although moving their legs forward with all the nimbleness of which they are capable the more they struggle up wards the faster they come down this drift ing which neutralizes the distance covered and even converts it into a retrogression is easily explained the thread has not reached the platform it floats it is fixed only at the lower end as long as it is of a fair length it is able al though moving to bear the minute animals weight but as the spider climbs the float becomes shorter in proportion and the time comes when a balance is struck between the ascensional force of the thread and the weight carried then the beastie remains stationary although continuing to climb presently the weight becomes too much for the shorter and shorter float and the spider slips down in spite of her persistent forward striving she is at last brought back to the branch by the falling thread here the ascent is soon renewed either on a fresh thread if the supply of silk be not yet exhausted or on a strange thread the work of those who have gone before as a rule the ceiling is reached it is twelve feet high the little spider is able there fore as the first product of her spinningmill before taking any refreshment to obtain a line fully twelve feet in length and all this the ropemaker and her rope was contained in the egg a particle of no size at all to what a degree of fineness can the silky matter be wrought wherewith the young spider is pro vided i our manufacturers are able to turn out platinumwire that can only be seen when it is made redhot with much simpler means the spiderling draws from her wiremill threads so delicate that even the brilliant light aoo of the sun does not always enable us to dis cern them we must not let all the climbers be stranded on the ceiling an inhospitable region where most of them will doubtless perish being un able to produce a second thread before they have had a meal i open the window a current of lukewarm air coming from the chafingdish escapes through the top dan delionplumes taking that direction tell me so the wafting threads cannot fail to be carried by this flow of air and to lengthen out in the open where a light breeze is blowing i take a pair of sharp scissors and without shaking the threads cut a few that are just visible at the base where they are thickened with an added strand the result of this operation is marvellous hanging to the flyingrope which is borne on the wind outside the spider passes through the win dow suddenly flies off and disappears an easy way of travelling if the conveyance possessed a rudder that allowed the passenger to land where he pleases but the little things are at the mercy of the winds where will they alight hundreds thousands of yards away perhaps let us wish them a prosperous journey the problem of dissemination is now solved what would happen if matters in stead of being brought about by my wiles took place in the open fields the answer is ob vious the young spiders born acrobats and ropewalkers climb to the top of a branch so as to find sufficient space below them to unfurl their apparatus here each draws from her ropefactory a thread which she abandons to the eddies of the air gently raised by the currents that ascend from the ground warmed by the sun this thread wafts upwards floats undulates makes fornts point of contact at last it breaks and vanishes in the distance carrying the spinstress hanging to it the epeira with the three white crosses the spider who has supplied us with these first data concerning the process of dissemination is endowed with a moderate maternal indus try as a receptacle for the eggs she weaves a mere pill of silk her work is modest in deed beside the banded epeiras balloons i looked to these to supply me with fuller docu ments i had laid up a store by rearing some mothers during the autumn so that nothing of importance might escape me i divided my stock of balloons most of which were woven before my eyes into two sections one half remained in my study under a wiregauze cover with small bunches of brushwood as supports the other half were experiencing the vicissitudes of openair life on the rosemaries in the enclosure these preparations which promised so well did not provide me with the sight which i expected namely a magnificent exodus worthy of the tabernacle occupied however a few results not devoid of interest are to be noted let us state them briefly the hatching takes place as march ap proaches when this time comes let us open the banded epeiras nest with the scissors we shall find that some of the youngsters have already left the central chamber and scattered over the surrounding eiderdown while the rest of the laying still consists of a compact mass of orange eggs the appear ance of the younglings is not simultaneous it takes place with intermissions and may last a couple of weeks nothing as yet suggests the future richly striped livery the abdomen is white and as it were floury in the front half in the other half it is a blackishbrown the rest of the body is paleyellow except in front where the eyes form a black edging when left alone the little ones remain motionless in the soft russet swans down if disturbed they shufile lazily where they are or even walk about in a hesitating and unsteady fashion one can see that they have to ripen before venturing out side maturity is achieved in the exquiste floss that surrounds the natal chamber and fills out the balloon this is the waitingroom in which the body hardens all dive into it as and when they emerge from the central keg they will not leave it until four months later when the midsummer heats have come their number is considerable a patient and careful census gives me nearly six hun dred and all this comes out of a purse no larger than a pea by what miracle is there room for such a family how do those thou sands of legs manage to grow without strain ing themselves the eggbag as we learnt in chapter ii is a short cylinder rounded at the bottom it is formed of compact white satin an insuperable barrier it opens into a round orifice wherein is bedded a lid of the same material through which the feeble beasties would be incapable of passing it is not a porous felt but a fab ric as tough as that of the sack then by what mechanism is the delivery effected observe that the disk of the lid doubles back into a short fold which edges into the orifice of the bag in the same way the lid of a saucepan fits the mouth by means of a pro jecting rim with this difference that the rim is not attached to the saucepan whereas in the epeiras work it is soldered to the bag or nest well at the time of the hatching this disk becomes unstuck lifts and allows the newbom spiders to pass through if the rim were movable and simply in serted if moreover the birth of all the fam ily took place at the same time we might think that the door is forced open by the liv ing wave of inmates who would set their backs to it with a common effort we should find an approximate image in the case of the saucepan whose lid is raised by the boiling of its contents but the fabric of the cover is one with the fabric of the bag the two are closely welded besides the hatching is effected in small batches incapable of the least exertion there must therefore be a sponta neous bursting or dehiscence independent of the assistance of the youngsters and similar to that of the seedpods of plants when fully ripened the dry fruit of the snapdragon opens three windows that of the pimpernel splits into two rounded halves something like those of the outer case of a fobwatch the fruit of the carnation partly unseals its valves and opens at the top into a starshaped hatch each seedcasket has its own system of locks which are made to work smoothly by the mere kiss of the sun well that other dry fruit the banded epeiras germbox likewise possesses its burst inggear as long as the eggs remain unhatched the door solidly fixed in its frame holds good as soon as the little ones swarm and want to get out it opens of itself come june and july beloved of the ci cadsb no less beloved of the young spiders who are anxious to be off it were difficult in deed for them to work their way through the thick shell of the balloon for the second time a spontaneous dehiscence seems called for where will it be effected the idea occurs oshand that it will take place long the edges of the top cover re member the details given in an earlier chap ter the neck of the balloon ends in a wide crater which is closed by a ceiling dug out cupwise the material is as stout in this part as in any other but as the lid was the finish ing touch to the work we expect to find an in complete soldering which would allow it to be unfastened the method of construction deceives us the ceiling is immovable at no season can my forceps manage to extract it without destroy ing the building from top to bottom the dehiscence takes places elsewhere at some point on the sides nothing informs us noth ing suggests to us that it will occur at one place rather than another moreover to tell the truth it is not a de hiscence prepared by means of some dainty piece of mechanism it is a very irregular tear somewhat sharply under the fierce heat of the sun the satin bursts like the rind of an over ripe pomegranate judging by the result we think of the expansion of the air inside which heated by the sun causes this rupture the signs of pressure from within are manifest the tatters of the torn fabric are turned out wards also a wisp of the russet eiderdown that fills the wallet invariably straggles through the breach in the midst of the pro truding floss the spiderlings expelled from their home by the explosion are in frantic commotion the balloons of the banded epeira are bombs which to free their contents burst un der the rays of a torrid sun to break they heed the fiery heatwaves of the dogdays when kept in the moderate atmosphere of my study most of them do not open and the emer gence of the young does not take place unless i myself have a hand in the business a few others open with a round hole a hole so neat that it might have been made with a punch this aperture is the work of the prisoners who relieving one another in turns have with a patient tooth bitten through the stuff of the jar at some point or other when exposed to the full force of the sun however on the rosemaries in the enclosure the balloons burst and shoot forth a ruddy flood of floss and tiny animals that is how things occur in the free sunbath of the fields unsheltered among the bushes the wallet of the banded epeira when the july heat ar rives splits under the effort of the inner air the delivery is effected by an explosion of the dwelling a very small part of the family are expelled with the flow of tawny floss the vast major ity remain in the bag which is ripped open but still bulges with eiderdown now that the breach is made any one can go out who pleases in his own good time without hurry ing besides a solemn action has to be per formed before the emigration the ani mal must cast its skin and the moult is an event that does not fall on the same date for all the evacuation of the place therefore lasts several days it is effected in small squads as the slough is flung aside those who sally forth climb up the neigh bouring twigs and there in the full heat of the sun proceed with the work of dissemina tion the method is the same as that which we saw in the case of the cross spider the spinnerets abandon to the breeze a thread that floats breaks and flies away carrying the ropemaker with it the number of starters on any one morning is so small as to rob the spectacle of the greater part of its interest the scene lacks animation because of the ab sence of a crowd to my intense disappointment the silky epeira does not either indulge in a tumultu ous and dashing exodus let me remind you of her handiwork the handsomest of the ma ternal wallets next to the banded epeiras it is an obtuse conoid closed with a star shaped disk it is made of a stouter and es pecially a thicker material than the banded epeiras balloon for which reason a sponta neous rupture becomes more necessary than ever this rupture is effected at the sides of the bag not far from the edge of the lid like the ripping of the balloon it requires the rough aid of the heat of july its mechan ism also seems to work by the expansion of the heated air for we again see a partial emis sion of the silky floss that fills the pouch the exit of the family is performed in a single group and this time before the moult perhaps for lack of the space necessary for the delicate casting of the skin the conical bag falls far short of the balloon in size those packed within would sprain their legs in ex tracting them from their sheaths the fam ily therefore emerges in a body and settles on a sprig hard by this is a temporary campingground where spinning in unison the youngsters soon weave an openwork tent the abode of a week or thereabouts the moult is effected in this lounge of intersecting threads the sloughed skins form a heap at the bottom of the dwelling on the trapezes above the flaylings take exercise and gain strength and vigour finally when maturity is attained they set out now these now those little by little and always cautiously there are no audacious flights on the thready airship the journey is accomplished by modest stages hanging to her thread the spider lets her self drop straight down to a depth of nine or ten inches a breath of air sets her swinging like a pendulum sometimes drives her against a neighbouring branch this is a step towards the dispersal at the point reached there is a fresh fall followed by a fresh pendulous swing that lands her a little farther afield thus in short tacks for the thread is never very long does the spiderling go about see ing the country until she comes to a place that suits her should the wind blow at all hard the voyage is cut short the cable of the pen dulum breaks and the beastie is carried for some distance on its cord to sum up although on the whole the tactics of the exodus remain much the same the two spinstresses of my region bestversed in the art of weaving mothers wallets failed to come up to my expectations i went to the trouble of rearing them with disappointing results where shall i find again the wonder ful spectacle which the cross spider offered me by chance i shall find it  in an even more striking fashion  among humbler spiders whom i had neglected to observe the spider that showed me the exodus in all its magnificence is known officially as thomisus onustus walck though the name suggest nothing to the readers mind it has the advantage at any rate of hurting neither the throat nor the ear as is too often the case with scientific nomenclature which sounds more like sneezing than articulate speech since it is the rule to dignify plants and animals with a latin label let us at least respect the euphony of the classics and refrain from harsh splutters which spit out a name instead of pronouncing it what will posterity do in face of the ris ing tide of a barbarous vocabulary which under the pretence of progress stifles real knowledge it will relegate the whole busi ness to the quagmire of oblivion but what will never disappear is the popular name which sounds well is picturesque and conveys some sort of information such is the term crab spider applied by the ancients to the group to which the thomisus belongs a pretty accurate term for in this case there is an evident analogy between the spider and the crustacean like the crab the thomisus walks side ways she also has forelegs stronger than her hindlegs the only thing wanting to com plete the resemblance is the front pair of stone gauntlets raised in the attitude of self defence the spider with the crablike figure does not know how to manufacture nets for catch ing game without springs or snares she lies in ambush among the flowers and awaits the arrival of the quarry which she kills by administering a scientific stab in the neck the thomisus in particular the subject of this chapter is passionately addicted to the pursuit of the domestic bee i have de scribed the contests between the victim and her executioner at greater length else where the bee appears seeking no quarrel intent upon plunder she tests the flowers with her tongue she selects a spot that will yield a good return soon she is wrapped up in her harvesting while she is filling her baskets and distending her crop the thomisus tht bandit lurking under cover of the flowers issues from her hidingplace creeps round be hind the bustling insect steals up close and with a sudden rush nabs her in the nape of the neck in vain the bee protests and darts her sting at random the assailant does not let go besides the bite in the neck is paralyzing because the cervical nervecentres are affected the poor things legs stiffen and all is over in a second the murderess now sucks the victims blood at her ease and when she has done scornfully flings the drained corpse aside she hides herself once more ready to bleed a second gleaner should the occasion offer this slaughter of the bee engaged in the hallowed delights of labour has always re volted me why should there be workers to feed idlers why sweated to keep sweaters in luxury why should so many admirable lives be sacrificed to the greater prosperity of brigandage these hateful discords amid the general harmony perplex the thinker all the more as wc shall see the cruel vampire become a model of devotion where her family is con cerned the ogre loved his children he ate the children of others under the tyranny of the stomach we are all of us beasts and men alike ogres the dignity of labour the joy of life maternal affection the terrors of death all these do not count in others the main point is that the morsel be tender and savoury according to the etymology of her name  diiyiy a cord  the thomisus should be like the ancient lictor who bound the sufferer to the stake the comparison is not inappropri ate as regards many spiders who tie their prey with a thread to subdue it and consume it at their ease but it just happens that the thomisus is at variance with her label she does not fasten her bee who dying suddenly of a bite in the neck offers no resistance to her consumer carried away by his recollec tion of the regular tactics our spiders god father overlooked the exception he did not know of the perfidious mode of attack which renders the use of a bowstring superfluous nor is the second name of onustus  loaded burdened freighted  any too happily chosen the fact that the beehuntress carries a heavy paunch is no reason to refer to this as a dis tinctive characteristic nearly all spiders have a voluminous belly a silkwarehouse where in some cases the rigging of the net in others the swans down of the nest is manufactured the thomisus a firstclass nestbuilder does like the rest she hoards in her abdomen but without undue display of obesity the wherewithal to house her family snugly can the expression onustus refer simply to her slow and sidelong walk the explanation appeals to me without satisfying me fully except in the case of a sudden alarm every spider maintains a sober gait and a wary pace when all is said the scientific term is composed of a misconception and a worthless epithet how difficult it is to name animals rationally i let us be indulgent to the nomen clator the dictionary is becoming exhausted and the constant flood that requires cata loguing mounts incessantly wearing out our combinations of syllables as the technical name tells the reader nothing how shall he be informed i see but one means which is to invite him to the may festivals in the wastelands of the south the murderess of the bees is of a chilly constitu tion in our parts she hardly ever moves away from the olivedistricts her favourite shrub is the whiteleaved rockrose cistus albidus with the large pink crumpled ephemeral blooms that last but a morning and are re placed next day by fresh flowers which have blossomed in the cool dawn this glorious efflorescence goes on for five or six weeks here the bees plunder enthusiastically fussing and bustling in the spacious whorl of the stamens which beflour them with yellow their persccutrix knows of this affluence she posts herself in her watchhouse under the rosy screen of a petal cast your eyes over the flower more or less everywhere if you see a bee lying lifeless with legs and tongue outstretched draw nearer the thomisus will be there nine times out of ten the thug has struck her blow she is draining the blood of the departed after all this cutter of bees throats is a pretty a very pretty creature despite her un wieldy paunch fashioned like a squat pyra mid and embossed on the base on either side with a pimple shaped like a camels hump the skin more pleasing to the eye than any satin is milkwhite in some in others lemon yellow there are fine ladies among them who adorn their legs with a number of pink bracelets and their back with carmine ara besques a narrow palegreen ribbon some times edges the right and left of the breast it is not so rich as the costume of the banded epeira but much more elegant because of its soberness its daintiness and the artful blend ing of its hues novice fingers which shrink from touching any other spider allow them selves to be enticed by these attractions they do not fear to handle the beauteous thomisus so gentle in appearance well what can this gem among spiders do in the first place she makes a nest worthy of its architect with twigs and horsehair and bits of wool the goldfinch the chaffinch and other masters of the builders art construct an aerial bower in the fork of the branches herself a lover of high places the thomisus selects as the site of her nest one of the upper twigs of the rockrose her regular hunting ground a twig withered by the heat and pos sessing a few dead leaves which curl into a little cottage this is where she settles with a view to her eggs ascending and descending with a gentle swing in more or less every direction the liv ing shuttle swollen with silk weaves a bag whose outer casing becomes one with the dry leaves around the work which is partly visible and partly hidden by its supports is a pure deadwhite its shape moulded in the angular interval between the bent leaves is that of a cone and reminds us on a smaller scale of the nest of the silky epeira when the eggs are laid the mouth of the receptacle is hermetically closed with a lid of the same white silk lastly a few threads stretched like a thin curtain form a canopy above the nest and with the curved tips of the leaves frame a sort of alcove wherein the mother takes up her abode it is more than a place of rest after the fatigues of her confinement it is a guard room an inspectionpost where the mother re mains sprawling until the youngsters exodus greatly emaciated by the laying of her eggs and by her expenditure of silk she lives only for the protection of her nest should some vagrant pass near by she hurries from her watchtower lifts a limb and puts the intruder to flight if i tease her with a straw she parries with big gestures like those of a prizefighten she uses her fists against my weapon when i propose to dis lodge her in view of certain experiments i find some difficulty in doing so she clings to the silken floor she frustrates my attacks which i am bound to moderate lest i should injure her she is no sooner attracted outside than she stubbornly returns to her post she declines to leave her treasure even so does the narbonne lycosa struggle when we try to take away her pill each dis plays the same pluck and the same devotion and also the same denseness in distinguishing her property from that of others the ly cosa accepts without hesitation any strange pill which she is given in exchange for her own she confuses alien produce with the produce of her ovaries and her silkfactory those hallowed words maternal love were out of place here it is an impetuous an almost me chanical impulse wherein real affection plays no part whatever the beautiful spider of the rockroses is no more generously endowed when moved from her nest to another of the same kind she settles upon it and never stirs from it even though the different arrange ment of the leafy fence be such as to warn her that she is not really at home provided that she have satin under her feet she does not notice her mistake she watches over an others nest with the same vigilance which she might show in watching over her own the lycosa surpasses her in maternal blindness she fastens to her spinnerets and dangles by way of a bag of eggs a ball of cork polished with my file a paper pellet a little ball of thread in order to discover if the thomisus is capable of a similar error i gathered some broken pieces of silkworms cocoon into a closed cone turning the frag ments so as to bring the smoother and more delicate inner surface outside my attempt was unsuccessful when removed from her home and placed on the artificial wallet the mother thomisus obstinately refused to settle there can she be more clearsighted than the lycosa perhaps so let us not be too extravagant with our praise however the imitation of the bag was a very clumsy one the work of laying is finished by the end of may after which lying flat on the ceiling of her nest the mother never leaves her guardroom either by night or day seeing her look so thin and wrinkled i imagine that i can please her by bringing her a provision of bees as i was wont to do i have misjudged her needs the bee hitherto her favourite dish tempts her no longer in vain does the prey buzz close by an easy capture within the cage the watcher does not shift from her post takes no notice of the windfall she lives exclusively upon maternal devotion a commendable but unsubstantial fare and so i see her pining away from day to day be coming more and more wrinkled what is the withered thing waiting for before expir ing she is waiting for her children to emerge the dying creature is still of use to them when the banded epeiras little ones issue from their balloon they have long been orphans there is none to come to their assistance and they have not the strength to free themselves unaided the balloon has to split automatically and to scatter the young sters and their flossy mattress all mixed up together the thomisus wallet sheathed in leaves over the greater part of its surface never bursts nor does the lid rise so carefully is it sealed down nevertheless after the de livery of the brood we see at the edge of the lid a small gaping hole an exitwindow who contrived this window which vas not there at first the fabric is too thick and tough to have yielded to the twitches of the feeble little prisoners it was the mother therefore who feeling her offspring shuffle impatiently under the silken ceiling herself made a hole in the bag she persists in living for five or six weeks despite her shattered health so as to give a last helping hand and open the door for her family after performing this duty she gently lets herself die hugging her nest and turning into a shrivelled relic when july comes the little ones emerge in view of their acrobatic habits i have placed a bundle of slender twigs at the top of the cage in which they were bom all of them pass through the wire gauze and form a group on the summit of the brushwood where they swiftly weave a spacious lounge of criss cross threads here they remain pretty quietly for a day or two then footbridges begin to be flung from one object to the next this is the opportune moment i put the bunch laden with beasties on a small table in the shade before the open win dow soon the exodus commences but slowly and unsteadily there are hesitations retro gressions perpendicular falls at the end of a thread ascents that bring the hanging spider up again in short much ado for a poor result as matters continue to drag it occurs to me at eleven ovlock to take the bundle of brush wood swarming with the little spiders all eager to be off and place it on the windowsill in the glare of the sun after a few minutes of heat and light the scene assumes a very different aspect the emigrants run to the top of the twigs bustle about actively it becomes a bewildering ropeyard where thou sands of legs are drawing the hemp from the spinnerets i do not see the ropes manu factured and sent floating at the mercy of the air but i guess their presence three or four spiders start at a time each going her own way in directions independent of her neighbours ah are moving upwards all are climbing some support as can be per ils ceived by the nimble motion of their legs moreover the road is visible behind the climber it is of double thickness thanks to an added thread then at a certain height in dividual movement ceases the tiny animal soars in space and shines lit up by the sun softly it sways then suddenly takes flight what has happened there is a slight breeze outside the floating cable has snapped and the creature has gone off borne on its parachute i see it drifting away showing like a spot of light against the dark foliage of the near cypresses some forty feet distant it rises higher it crosses over the cypressscreen it disappears others follow some higher some lower hither and thither but the throng has finished its preparations the hour has come to disperse in swarms we now see from the crest of the brushwood a continuous spray of starters who shoot up like microscopic projectiles and mount in a spreading cluster in the end it is like the bouquet at the finish of a pyrotechnic display the sheaf of rockets fired simultaneously the comparison is correct down to the dazzling light itself flaming in the sun like so many gleaming points the little spiders are the sparks of that living firework what a glo rious sendoifl what an entrance into the world clutching its aeronautic thread the minute creature mounts in an apotheosis sooner or later nearer or farther the fall comes to live we have to descend often very low alas the crested lark crumbles the muledroppings in the road and thus picks up his food the oaten grain which he would never find by soaring in the sky his throat swollen with song we have to descend the stomachs inexorable claims demand it the spiderling therefore touches land gravity tempered by the parachute is kind to her the rest of her story escapes me what infinitely tiny midges does she capture before possessing the strength to stab her bee what are the methods what the wiles of atom con tending with atom i know not we shall find her again in spring grown quite large and crouching among the flowers whence the bee takes toll the fowlingsnare is one of mans ingen ious villainies with lines pegs and poles two large earthcoloured nets arc en stretched upon the ground one to the right iy the other to the left of a bare surface a long c j cord pulled at the right moment by the fowler who hides in a brushwood hut works them and brings them together suddenly like a pair of shutters c j  divided between the two nets are the cages q of the decoybirds  linnets and chaffinches greenfinches and yellowhammers buntings and ortolans  sharpeared creatures which q on perceiving the distant passage of a flock of their own kind forthwith utter a short calling note one of them the satnbe an irresistible q tempter hops about and flaps his wings in ap x parent freedom a bit of twine fastens him to his convicts stake when worn with fa tigue and driven desperate by his vain at tempts to get away the sufferer lies down flat and refuses to do his duty the fowler is able to stimulate him without stirring from his hut a long string sets in motion a little lever work ing on a pivot raised from the ground by this diabolical contrivance the bird flies falls down and

inspired a more cun ning industry if the reader will meditate upon the description that follows he will cer tainly share my admiration first of all we must witness the making of the net we must see it constructed and see it again and again for the plan of such a com plex work can only be grasped in fragments today observation will give us one detail tomorrow it will give us a second suggesting fresh points of view as our visits multiply a new fact is each time added to the sum total of the acquired data confirming those which come before or directing our thoughts along unsuspected paths the snowball rolling over the carpet of white grows enormous however scanty each fresh layer be even so with truth in observa tional science it is built up of trifles patiently gathered together and while the collecting of these trifles means that the student of spider industry must not be chary of his time at least it involves no distant and speculative research the smallest garden contains epeirs all accomplished weavers in my enclosure which i have stocked care fully with the most famous breeds i have sbc different species under observation all of a useful size all firstclass spinners their names are the banded epeira epeira fasci ata walck the silky epeira £ sericea walck the angular epeira £ angulata walck the paletinted epeira £ pallida oliv the diadem epeira or cross spider £ diadema clerk and the crater epeira ecratera walck i am able at the proper hours all through the fine season to question them to watch them at work now this one anon that accord ing to the chances of the day what i did not see very plainly yesterday i can see the next day under better conditions and on any of the following days until the phenomenon under observation is revealed in all clearness let us go every evening step by step from one border of tall rosemaries to the next should things move too slowly we will sit down at the foot of the shrubs opposite the ropeyard where the light falls favourably and watch with unwearying attention each trip will be good for a fact that fills some gap in the ideas already gathered to appoint ones self in this way an inspector of spiders webs for many yelrs in succession and for long seasons means joining a not overcrowded profession i admit heaven knows it does not enable one to put money by no matter the meditative mind returns from that school fully satisfied to describe the separate progress of the work in the case of each of the six epeirae mentioned would be a useless repetition all six employ the same methods and weave similar webs save for certain details that shall be set forth later i will therefore sum up in the aggregate the particulars supplied by one or other of them my subjects in the first instance are young and boast but a slight corporation very far re moved from what it will be in the late autumn the belly the wallet containing the rope works hardly exceeds a peppercorn in bulk this slenderness on the part of the spinstresses must not prejudice us against their work there is no parity between their skill and their years the adult spiders with their disgraceful paunches can do no better moreover the beginners have one very precious advantage for the observer they work by day work even in the sun whereas the old ones weave only at night at unseasonable hours the first show us the secrets of their looms without much difficulty the others con ceal them from us work starts in july a couple of hours before sunset the spinstresses of my enclosure then leave their daytime hidingplaces select their posts and begin to spin one here another there there are many of them we can choose where we please let us stop in front of this one whom we surprise in the act of laying the foundations of the structure without any appreciable order she runs about the rosemaryhedge from the tip of one branch to another within the limits of some eighteen inches gradually she puts a thread in posi tion drawing it from her wiremill with the combs attached to her hindlegs this pre paratory work presents no appearance of a concerted plan the spider comes and goes impetuously as though at random she goes up comes down goes up again dives down again and each time strengthens the points of contact with intricate moorings distributed here and there the result is a scanty and disordered scaffolding is disordered the word perhaps not the epeiras eye more experienced in mat ters of this sort than mine has recogn the general lie of the land and the rope fabric has been erected accordingly it is very inaccurate in my opinion but very suitable for the spiders designs what is it that she really wants a solid frame to contain the network of the web the shapeless structure which she has just built fulfils the desired con ditions it marks out a flat free and perpen dicular area this is all that is necessary the whole work for that matter is now soon completed it is done all over again each evening from top to bottom for the incidents of the chase destroy it in a night the net is as yet too delicate to resist the desperate struggles of the captured prey on the other hand the adults net whidi is formed of stouter threads is adapted to last some time and the epeira gives it a more carefully constructed framework as we shall see elsewhere a special thread the foundation of the real net is stretched across the area so capri iously circumscribed it is distinguished from the others by its isolation its position at a distance from any twig that might interfere with its swaying length it never fails to have in the middle a thick white point formed of a little siuc cushion this is the beacon that marks the centre of the future edifice the post that will guide the epeira and bring order into the wilderness of twists and turns the time has come to weave the hunting snare the spider starts from the centre which bears the white signpost and running along the transversal thread hurriedly reaches the circumference that is to say the irregular frame enclosing the free space still with the same sudden movement she rushes from the circumference to the centre she starts again backwards and forwards makes for the right the left the top the bottom she hoists herself up dives down climbs up again runs down and always returns to the central landmark by roads that slant in the most unexpected manner each time a radius or spoke is laid here there or elsewhere in what looks like mad disorder the operation is so erratically conducted that it takes the most unremitting attention to follow it at all the spider reaches the margin of the area by one of the spokes al ready placed she goes along this margin for some distance from the point at which she landed fixes her thread to the frame and re turns to the centre by the same road which she has just taken the thread obtained on the way in a broken line partly on the radius and partly on the frame is too long for the exact distance be tween the circumference and the central point on returning to this point the spider adjusts her thread stretches it to the correct length fixes it and collects what remains on the central signpost in the case of each radius laid the surplus is treated in the same fashion so that the signpost continues to increase in size it was first a speck it is now a little pellet or even a small cushion of a certain breadth we shall see presently what becomes of this cushion whereon the spider that nig gardly housewife lays her savedup bits of thread for the moment we will note that the epeira works it up with her legs after placing each spoke teazles it with her claws mats it into felt with noteworthy diligence in so doing she gives the spokes a solid common support something like the hub of our carriagewheels the eventual regularity of the work sug gests that the radii are spun in the same order in which they figure in the web each follow ing immediately upon its next neighbour matters pass in another manner which at first looks like disorder but which is really a judicious contrivance after setting a few spokes in one direction the epeira runs across to the other side to draw some in the opposite direction these sudden changes of course are highly logical they show us how pro ficient the spider is in the mechanics of rope construction were they to succeed one another regularly the spokes of one group having nothing as yet to counteract them would distort the work by their straining would even destroy it for lack of a stabler support before continuing it is necessary to lay a converse group which will maintain the whole by its resistance any combination of forces acting in one direction must be forth with neutral by another in the opposite direction this is what our statics teach us and what the spider puts into practice she is a past mistress of the secrets of ropebuilding without serving an apprenticeship one would think that this interrupted and apparently disordered labour must result in a confused piece of work wrong the rays are equidistant and form a beautifullyregular orb their number is a characteristic mark of the different species the angular epeira places in her web the banded epeira the silky epeira these numbers are not absolutely fixed but the variation is very slight now which of us would undertake off hand without much preliminary experiment and without measuringinstruments to divide a circle into a given quantity of sectors of equal width the epeirae though weighted with a wallet and tottering on threads shaken by the wind effect the delicate division with out stopping to think they achieve it by a method which seems mad according to our notions of geometry out of disorder they evolve order we must not however give them more than their due the angles are only approx imately equal they satisfy the demands of the eye but cannot stand the test of strict measurement mathematical precision would be superfluous here no matter we are amazed at the result obtained how does the epeira come to succeed with her difficult problem so strangely managed i am still asking myself the question the laying of the radii is finished the spider takes her place in the centre on the little cushion formed of the inaugural sign post and the bits of thread left over sta tioned on this support she slowly turns round and round she is engaged on a delicate piece of work with an extremely thin thread she describes from spoke to spoke starting from the centre a spiral line with very close coils the central space thus worked attains in the adults webs the dimensions of the palm of ones hand in the younger spiders webs it is much smallpr but it is never absent for reasons which i will explain in the course of this study i shall call it in future the restingfloor the thread now becomes thicker the first could hardly be seen the second is plainly visible the spider shifts her position with great slanting strides turns a few times mov ing farther and farther from the centre fixes her line each time to the spoke which she crosses and at last comes to a stop at the lower edge of the frame she has described a spiral with coils of rapidlyincreasing width the average distance between the coils even in the structures of the young epeiras is one centimetre let us not be misled by the word spiral which conveys the notion of a curved line all curves are banished from the spiders work nothing is used but the straight line and its combinations all that is aimed at is a polygonal line drawn in a curve as geometry understands it to this polygonal line a work destined to disappear as the real toils are woven i will give the name of the auxiliary spiral its object is to supply crossbars supporting rungs especially in the outer zone where the radii are too distant from one another to afford a suitable groundwork its object is also to guide the epeira in the ex tremely delicate business which she is now about to undertake but before that one last task becomes essential the area occupied by the spokes is inch  translators note very irregular being marked out by the sup ports of the branch which are infinitely variable there are angular niches which if skirted too closely would disturb the sym metry of the web about to be constructed the epeira needs an exact space wherein gradually to lay her spiral thread more over she must not leave any gaps through which her prey might find an outlet an expert in these matters the spider soon knows the comers that have to be filled up with an alternating movement first in this direction then in that she lays upon the support of the radii a thread that forms two acute angles at the lateral boundaries of the faulty part and describes a zigzag line not wholly unlike the ornament known as the fret the sharp comers have now been filled with frets on every side the time has come to work at the essential part the snaringweb for which all the rest is but a support cling ing on the one hand to the radii on the other to the chords of the auxiliary spiral the epeira covers the same ground as when lay ing the spiral but in the opposite direction formerly she moved away from the centre now she moves towards it and with closer and more numerous circles she starts from the base of the auxiliary spiral near the frame what follows is difficult to observe for the movements are very quick and spasmodic consisting of a series of sudden little rushes sways and bends that bewilder the eye it needs continuous attention and repeated examination to distinguish the progress of the work however slightly the two hindlegs the weaving imple ments keep going constantly let us name them according to their position on the work floor i call the leg that faces the centre of the coil when the animal moves the inner leg the one outside the coil the outer leg the latter draws the thread from the spin neret and passes it to the inner leg which with a graceful movement lays it on the radius crossed at the same time the first leg measures the distance it grips the last coil placed in position and brings within a suitable range that point of the radius whereto the thread is to be fixed as soon as the radius is touched the thread sticks to it by its own glue there are no slow operations no knots the fixing is done of itself meanwhile turning by narrow degrees the spinstress approaches the auxiliary chords that have just served as her support when in the end these chords become too close they will have to go they would impair the sym metry of the work the spider therefore clutches and holds on to the rungs of a higher row she picks up one by one as she goes along those which are of no more use to her and gathers them into a finespun ball at the contactpoint of the next spoke hence arises a series of silky atoms marking the course of the disappearing spiral the light has to fall favourably for us to perceive these specks the only remains of the ruined auxiliary thread one would take them for grains of dust if the faultless reg ularity of their distribution did not remind us of the vanished spiral they continue still visible until the final collapse of the net and the spider without a stop of any kind turns and turns and turns drawing nearer to the centre and repeating the operation of fix ing her thread at each spoke which she crosses a good halfhour an hour even among the fullgrown spiders is spent on spiral circles to the number of about fifty for the web of the silky epcira and thirty for those of the banded and the angular epeira at last at some distance from the centre on the borders of what i have called the restingfloor the spider abruptly terminates her spiral when the space would still allow of a certain number of turns we shall sec the reason of this sudden stop presently next the epeira no matter which young or old hurriedly flings herself upon the little central cushion pulls it out and rolls it into a ball which i expected to see thrown away but no her thrifty nature does not permit this waste she eats the cushion at iirst an inaugural landmark then a heap of bits of thread she once more melts in the digestive crucible what is no doubt intended to be re stored to the silken treasury it is a tough mouthful difficult for the stomach to elabo rate still it is precious and must not be lost the work finishes with the swallowing then and there the spider instals herself head downwards at her huntingpost in the centre of the web the operation which we have just seen gives rise to a reflection men are bom right handed thanks to a lack of synunetry diat has never been explained our right side is stronger and readier in its movements than our left the inequality is especially notice able in the two hands our language ex presses this supremacy of the favoured side in the terms dexterity adroitness and address all of which allude to the right hand is the animal on its side righthanded lefthanded or unbiased we have had opportunities of showing that the cricket the grasshopper and many others draw their bow which is on the right wingcase over the sounding apparatus which is on the left wing case they are righthanded when you and i take an unpremeditated turn we spin round on our right heel the left side the weaker moves on the pivot of the right the stronger in the same way nearly all the molluscs that have spiral shells roll their coils from left to right among the numerous species in both land and water fauna only a very few are exceptional and turn from right to left it would be interesting to try and work out to what extent that part of the zoological kingdom which boasts a twosided structure is divided into righthanded and lefthanded animals can dissmymetry that source of contrasts be a general rule or are there neutrals endowed with equal powers of skill and energy on both sides yes there are and the spider is one of them she enjoys the very enviable privilege of possessing a left side which is no less capable than the right she is ambidextrous as witness the following observations when laying her snaringthread every epeira turns in either direction indifferently as a close watch will prove reasons whose secret escapes us determine the direction adopted once this or the other course is taken the spinstress does not change it even after incidents that sometimes occur to disturb the progress of the work it may happen that a gnat gets caught in the part already woven the spider thereupon abruptly in terrupts her labours hastens up to the prey binds it and then returns to where she stopped and continues the spiral in the same order as before at the commencement of the work gyra tion in one direction being employed as well as gyration in the other we see that when making her repeated webs the same epeira turns now her right side now her left to the centre of the coil well as we have said it is always with the inner hindleg the leg nearer the centre that is to say in some cases the right and in some cases the left leg that she places the thread in position an exceed ingly delicate operation calling for the dis play of exquisite skill because of the quickness of the action and the need for preserving strictly equal distances any one seeing this leg working with such extreme precision the right leg today the left tomorrow be comes convinced that the epeira is highly ambidextrous a ge docs not modify the epeiras talent in any essential feature as the young worked so do the old the richer by a years experience there are no masters nor apprentices in their guild all know their craft from the moment that the first thread is laid we have learnt something from the novices let us now look into the matter of their elders and see what additional task the needs of age impose upon them july comes and gives me exactly what i wish for while the new inhabitants are twisting their ropes on the rosemaries in the enclosure one evening by the last gleams of twilight i discover a splendid spider with a mighty belly just outside my door this one is a matron she dates back to last year her majestic corpulence so exceptional at this season proclaims the fact i know her for the angular epeira epeira angulata walck clad in grey arid girdled with two dark stripes that meet in a point at the back the base of her abdomen swells into a short nipple on either side this neighbour will certainly serve my turn provided that she do not work too late at night things bode well i catch the buxom one in the act of laying her first threads at this rate my success need not be won at the expense of sleep and in fact i am able throughout the month of july and the greater part of august from eight to ten oclock in the evening to watch the construc tion of the web which is more or less ruined nightly by the incidents of the chase and built up again next day when too seriously dilapidated during the two stifling months when the light fails and a spell of coolness follows upon the furnaceheat of the day it is easy for me lantern in hand to watch my neighbours various operations she has taken up her abode at a convenient height for observation between a row of cypresstrees and a clump of laurels near the entrance to an alley haunted by moths the spot appears wellchosen for the epeira does not change it throughout the season though she renews her net almost every night punctually as darkness falls our whole family goes and calls upon her big and little we stand amazed at her wealth of belly and her exuberant somersaults in the maze of quivering ropes we admire the faultless geometry of the net as it gradually takes shape all agleam in the lanternlight the work becomes a fairy orb which seems woven of moonbeams should i linger in my anxiety to clear up certain details the household which by this time is in bed waits for my return before going to sleep what has she been doing this evening i am asked has she finished her web has she caught a moth i describe what has happened tomorrow they will be in a less hurry to go to bed they will want to see everything to the very end what delightful simple evenings we have spent looking into the spiders workshop the journal of the angular epeira written up day by day teaches us first of all how she obtains the ropes that form the framework of the building all day in visible crouching amid the cypressleaves the spider at about eight oclock in the evening solemnly emerges from her retreat and makes for the top of a branch in this exalted posi tion she sits for some time laying her plans with due regard to the locality she consults the weather ascertains if the night will be fine then suddenly with her eight legs wide spread she lets herself drop straight down hanging to the line that issues from her spin nerets just as the ropemaker obtains the even output of his hemp by walking back wards so does the epeira obtain the discharge of hers by falling it is extracted by the weight of her body the descent however has not the brute speed which the force of gravity would give it if uncontrolled it is governed by the action of the spinnerets which contract or ex pand their pores or close them entirely at the fallers pleasure and so with gentle moderation she pays out this living plumb line of which my lantern clearly shows me the plumb but not always the line the great squab seems at such times to be sprawling in space without the least support she comes to an abrupt stop two inches from the ground the silkreel ceases working the spider turns round clutches the line which she has just obtained and climbs up by this road still spinning but this time as she is no longer assisted by the force of gravity the thread is extracted in another manner the two hindlegs with a quick alternate action draw it from the wallet and let it go on returning to her startingpoint at a height of six feet or more the spider is now in possession of a double line bent into a loop and floating loosely in a current of air she fixes her end where it suits her and waits until the other end wafted by the wind has fastened its loop to the adjacent twigs the desired result may be very slow in coming it does not tire the unfailing patience of the epeira but it soon wears out mine and it has happened to me sometimes to collaborate with the spider i pick up the floating loop with a straw and lay it on a branch at a convenient height the foot bridge erected with my assistance is con sidered satisfactory just as though the wind had placed it i count this collaboration among the good actions standing to my credit feeling her thread fixed the epeira runs along it repeatedly from end to end adding a fibre to it on each journey whether i help or not this forms the suspensioncable the main piece of the framework i call it a cable in spite of its extreme thinness because of its structure it looks as though it were single but at the two ends it is seen to divide and spread tuftwise into numerous constit uent parts which are the product of as many crossings these diverging fibres with their several contactpoints increase the steadiness of the two extremities the suspensioncable is incomparably stronger than the rest of the work and lasts for an indefinite time the web is generally shattered after the nights hunting and is nearly always rewoven on the following evening after the removal of the wreckage it is made all over again on the same site cleared of everything except the cable from which the new network is to hang the laying of this cable is a somewhat difficult matter because the success of the en terprise does not depend upon the animals industry alone it has to wait until a breeze carries the line to the pierhead in the bushes sometimes a calm prevails sometimes the thread catches at an unsuitable point this involves great expenditure of time with no certainty of success and so when once the suspensioncable is in being well and solidly placed the epeira does not change it except on critical occasions every evening she passes and repasses over it strengthening it with fresh threads when the epeira cannot manage a fall of sufficient depth to give her the double line with its loop to be fixed at a distance she em ploys another method she lets herself down and then climbs up again as we have already seen but this time the thread ends suddenly in a filmy hairpencil a tuft whose parts remain disjoined just as they come from the spinnerets rose then this sort of bushy foxs brush is cut short as though with a pair of scissors and the whole thread when un furled doubles its length which is now enough for the purpose it is fastened by the end joined to the spider the other floats in the air with its spreading tuft which easily tangles in the bushes even so must the banded epeira go to work when she throws her daring suspensionbridge across a stream once the cable is laid in this way or in that the spider is in possession of a base that allows her to approach or withdraw from the leafy piers at will from the height of the cable the upper boundary of the projected works she lets herself slip to a slight depth varying the points of her fall she climbs up again by the line produced by her descent the result of the operation is a double thread which is unwound while the spider walks along her big footbridge to the contact branch where she fixes the free end of her thread more or less low down in this way she obtains to right and left a few slanting crossbars connecting the cable with the branches these crossbars in their turn support others in everchanging directions when there are enough of them the epeira need no longer resort to falls in order to extract her threads she goes from one cord to the next always wiredrawing with her hindlegs and placing her produce in position as she goes this results in a combination of straight lines owning no order save that they are kept in one nearly perpendicular plane they mark a very irregular polygonal area wherein the web itself a work of magnificent regularity shall presently be woven ass it is unnecessary to go over the construc tion of the masterpiece again the younger spiders have taught us enough in this respect in both cases we see the same equidistant radii laid with a central landmark for a guide the same auxiliary spiral the scaffold ing of temporary rungs soon doomed to dis appear the same snaringspiral with its maze of closelywoven coils let us pass on other details call for our attention the laying of the snaringspiral is an ex ceedingly delicate operation because of the regularity of the work i was bent upon knowing whether if subjected to the din of unaccustomed sounds the spider would hesitate and blunder does she work imper turbably or does she need undisturbed quiet as it is i know that my presence and that of my light hardly trouble her at all the sudden flashes emitted by my lantern have no power to distract her from her task she continues to turn in the light even as she turned in the dark neither faster nor slower this is a good omen for the experiment which i have in view the first sunday in august is the feast of the patron saint of the village commemorat ing the finding of st stephen this is tues day the third day of the rejoicings there will be fireworks tonight at nine oclock to conclude the merrymakings they will take place on the highroad outside my door at a few steps from the spot where my spider is working the spinstress is busy upon her great spiral at the very moment when the village bigwigs arrive with trumpet and drum and small boys carrying torches more interested in animal psychology than in pyrotechnical displays i watch the epeiras doings lantern in hand the hul labaloo of the crowd the reports of the mortars the crackle of roman candles burst ing in the sky the hiss of the rockets the rain of sparks the sudden flashes of white red or blue light none of this disturbs the worker who methodically turns and turns again just as she does in the peace of ordinary evenings once before the gun which i fired under the planetrees failed to trouble the concert of the cicadae today the dazzling light of the firewheels and the splutter of the crackers do not avail to distract the spider from her weaving and after all what diflferencc would it make to my neighbour if the world fell in i the village could be blown up with djmamite without her losing her head for such a trifle she would calmly go on with her web let us return to the spider manufacturing her net under the usual tranquil conditions the great spiral has been finished abruptly on the confines of the restingfloor the central cushion a mat of ends of saved thread is next pulled up and eaten but be fore indulging in this mouthful which closes the proceedings two spiders the only two of the order the banded and the silky epeira have still to sign their work a broad white ribbon is laid in a thick zigzag from the centre to the lower edge of the orb some times but not always a second band of the same shape and of lesser length occupies the upper portion opposite the first i like to look upon these odd flourishes as consolidatinggear to begin with the young epeira never use them for the moment heedless of the future and lavish of their silk they remake their web nightly even though it be none too much dilapidated and might well serve again a brandnew snare at sun set is the rule with them and there is little need for increased solidity when the work has to be done again on the morrow on the other hand in the late autumn the fullgrown spiders feeling layingtime at hand are driven to practise economy in view of the great expenditure of silk required for the eggbag owing to its large size the net now becomes a costly work which it were well to use as long as possible for fear of finding ones reserves exhausted when the time comes for the expensive construction of the nest for this reason or for others which escape me the banded and the silky epeirae think it wise to produce durable work and to strengthen their toils with a crossribbon the other epeirae who are put to less ex pense in the fabrication of their maternal wallet  a mere pill  are unacquainted with the zigzag binder and like the younger spiders reconstruct their web almost nightly my fat neighbour the angular epeira consulted by the light of a lantern shall tell us how the renewal of the net proceeds as the twilight fades she comes down cautiously from her daydwelling she leaves the foliage of the cypresses for the suspensioncable of her snare here she stands for some time then descending to her web she collects the wreckage in great armfuls everything  spiral spokes and frame  is raked up with her legs one thing alone is spared and that is the suspensioncable the sturdy piece of work that has served as a foundation for the previous buildings and will serve for the new after receiving a few strengthening repairs the collected ruins form a pill which the spider consumes with the same greed that she would show in swallowing her prey noth ing remains this is the second instance of the spiders supreme economy of their silk we have seen them after the manufacture of the net eating the central guidepost a modest mouthful wc now see them gobbling up the whole web a meal refined and turned into fluid by the stomach the materials of the old net will serve for other purposes as soon as the site is thoroughly cleared the work of the frame and the net begins on the support of the suspensioncable which was respected would it not be simpler to restore the old web which might serve many times yet if a few rents were just repaired one would say so but does the spider know how to patch her work as a thrifty housewife dams her linen that is the question to mend severed meshes to replace broken threads to adjust the new to the old in short to restore the original order by assem bling the wreckage would be a farreaching feat of prowess a very fine proof of gleams of intelligence capable of performing ra tional calculations our menders excel in this class of work they have as their guide their sense which measures the holes cuts the new piece to size and fits it into its proper place does the spider possess the counterpart of this habit of clear thinking people declare as much without ap parently looking into the matter very closely they seem able to dispense with the con scientious observers scruples when inflating their bladder of theory they go straight ahead and that is enough as for ourselves less greatly daring we will first enquire we will see by experiment if the spider really knows how to repair her work the angular epeira that near neighbour who has already supplied me with so many documents has just finished her web at nine ovlock in the evening it is a splendid night calm and warm favourable to the rounds of the moths all promises good hunting at the moment when after completing the great spiral the epeira is about to eat the central cushion and settle down upon her resting floor i cut the web in two diagonally with a pair of sharp scissors the sagging of the spokes deprived of their counteragents pro duces an empty space wide enough for three fingers to pass through the spider retreats to her cable and looks on without being greatly frightened when i have done she quietly returns she takes her stand on one of the halves at the spot which was the centre of the original orb but as her legs find no footing on one side she soon realizes that the snare is defective thereupon two threads are stretched across the breach two threads no more the legs that lacked a foothold spread across them and henceforth the epeira moves no more devoting her attention to the incidents of the chase when i saw those two threads laid joining the edges of the rent i began to hope that i was to witness a mendingprocess the spider said i to myself will increase the number of those crossthreads from end to end of the breach and though the added piece may not match the rest of the work at least it will fill the gap and the continuous sheet will be of the same use practically as the regular web the reality did not answer to my expecta tion the splnstress made no further en deavour all night she hunted with her riven net for what it was worth for i found the web next morning in the same condition wherein i had left it on the night before there had been no mending of any kind the two threads stretched across the breach even must not be taken for an attempt at repairing finding no foothold for her legs on one side the spider went to look into the state of things and in so doing crossed the rent in going and returning she left a thread as is the custom with all the epeirs when walking it was not a deliberate mend ing but the mere result of an uneasy change of place perhaps the subject of my experiment thought it unnecessary to go to fresh trouble and expense for the web can serve quite well as it is after my scissorcut the two halves together represent the original snaring surface all that the spider seated in a central position need do is to find the requisite support for her spread legs the two threads stretched from side to side of the cleft supply her with this or nearly my mischief did not go far enough let us devise something better next day the web is renewed after the old one has been swallowed when the work is done and the epeira seated motionless at her central post i take a straw and wielding it dexterously so as to respect the restingfloor and the spokes i pull and root up the spiral which dangles in tatters with its snaring threads ruined the net is useless no passing moth would allow herelf to be caught now what does the epeira do in the face of this disaster nothing at all motionless on her restingfloor which i have left intact she awaits the capture of the game she awaits it all night in vain on her impotent web in the morning i find the snare as i left it neces sity the mother oif invention has not prompted the spider to make a slight repair in her ruined toils possibly this is asking too much of her a resources the silkglands may be exhausted after the laying of the great spiral and to repeat the same expenditure immediately is out of the question i want a case where in there could be no appeal to any such exhaustion i obtain it thanks to my assiduity while i am watching the rolling of the spiral a head of game rushes full tilt into the unfinished snare the epeira interrupts her work hurries to the giddypate swathes him and takes her fill of him where he lies dur ing the struggle a section of the web has torn under the weavers very eyes a great gap endangers the satisfactory working of the net what will the spider do in the presence of this grievous rent now or never is the time to repair the broken threads the accident has happened this very moment between the animals legs it is certainly known and moreover the rope works are in full swing this time there is no question of the exhaustion of the silk warehouse well under these conditions so favorable to darning the epeira does no mending at all she flings aside her prey after taking a few sips at it and resumes her spiral at the point where she interrupted it to attack the moth the torn part remains as it is the machineshuttle in our looms does not revert to the spoiled fabric even so with the spider working at her web and this is no case of distraction of individual carelessness all the large spin stresses suffer from a similar incapacity for patching the banded epeira and the silky epeira are noteworthy in this respect the angular epeira remakes her web nearly every evening the other two reconstruct theirs only very seldom and use them even when extremely dilapidated they go on hunting with shapeless rags before they bring them selves to weave a new web the old one has to be ruined beyond recognition well i have often noted the state of one of these ruins and the next morning i have found it as it was or even more dilapidated never any repairs never never i am sorry because of the reputation which our hardpressed theorists have given her but the spider is absolutely unable to mend her work in spite of her thoughtful appearance the epeira is incapable of the modicum of reflexion required to insert a piece into an accidental other spiders are unacquainted with wide meshed nets and weave satins wherein the threads crossing at random form a contin uous substance among this number is the house spider tegenaria domestica lin in the comers of our rooms she stretches wide webs fixed by angular extensions the bestprotected nook at one side contains the owners secret apartment it is a silk tube a gallery with a conical opening whence the spider sheltered from the eye watches events the rest of the fabric which exceeds our finest muslins in delicacy is not properly speaking a huntingimplement it is a plat form whereon the spider attending to the affairs of her estate goes her rounds espe cially at night the real trap consists of a confusion of lines stretched above the web the snare constructed according to other rules than in the case of the epeirae also worics differently here are no viscous threads but plain toils rendered invisible by their very number if a gnat rush into the perfidious entanglement he is caught at once and the more he struggles the more firmly is he bound the snareling falls on the sheet web tegenaria hastens up and bites him in the neck having said this let us experiment a little in the web of the house spider i make a round hole two fingers wide the hole re mains yawning all day long but next morning it is invariably closed an extremely thin gauze covers the breach the dark appearance of which contrasts with the dense whiteness of the surrounding fabric the gauze is so delicate that to make sure of its presence i use a straw rather than my eyes the move ment of the web when this part is touched proves the presence of an obstacle here the matter would appear obvious the house spider has mended her work dur ing the night she has put a patch in the torn stuff a talent unknown to the garden spiders it would be greatly to her credit if a more attentive study did not lead to another conclusion the web of the house spider is as we were saying a platform for watching and exploring it is also a sheet into which the insects caught in the overhead rigging fall this surface a domain subject to unlimited shocks is never strong enough especially as it is exposed to the additional burden of little bits of plaster loosened from the wall the owner is constantly working at it she adds a new layer nightly every time that she issues from her tubular retreat or returns to it she fixes the thread that hangs behind her upon the road covered as evidence of this work we have the direc tion of the surfacelines all of which whether straight or winding according to the fancies that guide the spiders path converge lipon the entrance of the tube each step taken beyond a doubt adds a filament to the web we have here the story of the procession ary of the pine whose habits i have related elsewhere when the caterpillars leave the silk pouch to go and browse at night and also when they enter it again they never fail to spin a little on the surface of their nest each expedition adds to the thickness of the wall when moving this way or that upon the purse which i have split from top to bottom with my scissors the processionaries upholster the processionaries are mothcaterpillars that feed on various leaves and march in file laying a silken trail as they go  translators note the breach even as they upholster the un touched part without paying more attention to it than to the rest of the wall caring nothing about the accident they behave in the same way as on a nongutted dwelling the crevice is closed in course of time not intentionally but solely by the action of the usual spinning we arrive at the same conclusion on the subject of the house spider walking about her platform every night she lays fresh courses without drawing a distinction between the solid and the hollow she has not deliberately put a patch in the torn texture she has simply gone on with her ordinary business if it happen that the hole is even tually dosed this fortunate result is the out come not of a special purpose but of an unvarying method of work besides it is evident that if the spider really wished to mend her web all her endeavours would be concentrated upon the rent she would devote to it all the silk at her disposal and obtain in one sitting a piece very like the rest of the web instead of that what do we find almost nothing a hardly visible gauze the thing is obvious the spider did on that rent what she did every elsewhere neither more nor less far from squandering silk upon it she saved her silk so as to have enough for the whole web the gap will be better mended little by little afterwards as the sheet is strengthened all over with new layers and this will take long two months later the window  my work  still shows through and makes a dark stain against the deadwhite of the fabric neither weavers nor spinners therefore know how to repair their work those wonderful manufacturers of silkstuffs lack the least glimmer of that sacred lamp reason which enables the stupidest of darningwomen to mend the heel of an old stocking the office of inspector of spiders webs would have its uses even if it merely succeeded in ridding us of a mistaken and mischievous idea the spiral network of the epcirae possesses contrivances of fearsome cun ning let us give our attention by preference to that of the banded epeira or that of the silky epeira both of which can be observed at early morning in all their freshness the thread that forms them is seen with the naked eye to differ from that of the framework and the spokes it glitters in the sun looks as though it were kjiotted and gives the impression of a chaplet of atoms to examine it through the lens on the web itself is scarcely feasible because of the shaking of the fabric which trembles at the least breath by passing a sheet of glass under the web and lifting it i take away a few pieces of thread to study pieces that remain fixed to the glass in parallel lines lens and microscope can now play their part the sight is perfectly astounding those threads on the borderland between the visible and the invisible are very closely twisted twine similar to the gold cord of our officers swordknots moreover they are hollow the infinitely slender is a tube a channel full of a viscous moisture resembling a strong solution of gum arabic i can see a diapha x nous trail of this moisture trickling through the broken ends under the pressure of the thin glass slide that covers them on the stage of the microscope the twists lengthen out become crinkled ribbons traversed from end to end through the middle by a dark streak m which is the empty container j the fluid contents must ooze slowly v b through the side of those tubular threads j j c rolled into twisted strings and thus render i the network sticky it is sticky in fact and in such a way as to provoke surprise i bring o a fine straw flat down upon three or four rungs of a sector however gentle the con co z tact adhesion is at once established when i lift the straw the threads come with it and stretch to twice or three times their length like a thread of indiarubber at last when overtaut they loosen without breaking and resume their original form they lengthen by unrolling their twist they shorten by roll ing it again lastly they become adhesive by taking the glaze of the gummy moisture wherewith they are filled in short the spiral thread is a capillary tube finer than any that our physics will ever know it is rolled into a twist so as to possess an elasticity that allows it without breaking to yield to the tugs of the captured prey it holds a supply of sticky matter in reserve in its tube so as to renew the adhesive properties of the surface by incessant exudation as they become impaired by exposure to the air it is simply marvellous the epeira hunts not with springs but with limesnares and such limesnares i everything is caught in them down to the dandelionplume that barely brushes against them nevertheless the epeira who is in constant touch with her web is not caught in them why let us first of all remember that the spider has contrived for herself in the middle of her trap a floor in whose construction the sticky spiral thread plays no part we saw how this thread stops suddenly at some distance from the centre there is here covering a space which in the larger webs is about equal to the palm of ones hand a fabric formed of spokes and of the commencement of the auxiliary spiral a neutral fabric in which the exploring straw finds no adhesiveness anywhere here on this central restingfloor and here only the epeira takes her stand waiting whole days for the arrival of the game however close however prolonged her contact with this portion of the web she runs no risk of sticking to it because the gummy coating is lacking as is the twisted and tubular structure throughout the length of the spokes and throughout the extent of the auxiliary spiral these pieces together with the rest of the framework are made of plain straight solid thread but when a victim is caught sometimes right at the edge of the web the spider has to rush up quickly to bind it and overcome its attempts to free itself she is walking then upon her network and i do not find that she suffers the least inconvenience the lime threads are not even lifted by the movements of her legs in my boyhood when a troop of us would go on thursdays to try and catch a gold finch in the hempfields we used before cover ing the twigs with glue to grease our fingers with a few drops of oil lest we should get them caught in the sticky matter does the epeira know the secret of fatty substances let us try i rub my exploring straw with slightly oiled paper when applied to the spiral thread of the web it now no longer sticks to it the principle is discovered i pull out the leg of a live epeira brought just as it is into con tact with the limethreads it does not stick to them any more than to the neutral cords whether spokes or parts of the framework we were entitled to expect this judging by the spiders general immunity but here is something that wholly alters the result i put the leg to soak for a quarter of an hour in disulphide of carbon the best solvent of fatty matters i wash it carefully with a brush dipped in the same fluid when this washing is finished the leg sticks to the sna ringthread quite easily and adheres to it the weekly halfholiday in french schools  trans lators note just as well as anything else would the unoued straw for instance did i guess aright when i judged that it was a fatty substance that preserved the epeira from the snares of her sticky catherinewheel the action of the carbon disulphide seems to say yes besides there is no reason why a substance of this kind which plays so frequent a part in animal economy should not coat the spider very slightly by the mere act of perspiration we used to rub our fingers with a little oil before handling the twigs in which the goldfinch was to be caught even so the epeira varnishes herself with a special sweat to operate on any part of her web without fear of the limethreads however an unduly protracted stay on the sticky threads would have its drawbacks in the long run continual contact with those threads might produce a certain adhesion and inconvenience the spider who must preserve all her agility in order to rush upon the prey before it can release itself for this reason gummy threads are never used in building the post of interminable waiting it is only on her restingfloor that the epeira sits motionless and with her eight legs outspread ready to mark the least quiver in the net it is here again that she takes her meals often longdrawnout when the joint is a substantial one it is hither that after trussing and nibbling it she drags her prey at the end of a thread to consume it at her ease on a nonviscous mat as a huntingpost and refectory the epeira has contrived a central space free from glue as for the glue itself it is hardly possible to study its chemical properties because the quantity is so slight the microscope shows it trickling from the broken threads in the form of a transparent and more or less gran ular streak the following experiment will tell us more about it with a sheet of glass passed across the web i gather a series of limethreads which remain fixed in parallel lines i cover this sheet with a belljar standing in a depth of water soon in this atmosphere saturated with humidity the threads become enveloped in a watery sheath which gradually increases and begins to flow the twisted shape has by this time disappeared and the channel of the thread reveals a chaplet of translucent orbs that is to ay a series of extremely fine drops in twentyfour hours the threads have lost their contents and are reduced to almost in visible streaks if i then lay a drop of water on the glass i get a sticky solution similar to that which a particle bf gum arabic might yield the conclusion is evident the epeiras glue is a substance that absorbs moisture freely in an atmosphere with a high degree of humidity it becomes saturated and perco lates by sweating through the side of the tubular threads these data explain certain facts relating to the work of the net the fullgrown banded and silky epeirae weave at very early hours long before dawn should the air turn misty they sometimes leave that part of the task unfinished they build the general framework they lay the spokes they even draw the auxili ary spiral for all these parts are unaffected by excess of moisture but they arc very careful not to work at the limethreads which if soaked by the fog would dissolve into sticky shreds and lose their efficacy by being wetted the net that was started will be finished to morrow if the atmosphere be favourable while the highlyabsorbent character of the snaringthread has its drawbacks it also has compensating advantages both epeirae when hunting by day affect those hot places exposed to the fierce rays of the sun wherein the crickets delight in the torrid heats of the dogdays therefore the limethreads but for special provisions would be liable to dry up to shrivel into stiff and lifeless fila ments but the very opposite happens at the most scorching times of the day they continue supple elastic and more and more adhesive how is this brought about by their very powers of absorption the moisture of which the air is never deprived penetrates them slowly it dilutes the thick contents of their tubes to the requisite degree and causes it to ooze through as and when the earlier stick iness decreases what birdcatcher could vie with the garden spider in the art of laying limesnares and all this industry and cun ning for the capture of a moth then too what a passion for production knowing the diameter of the orb and the number of coils we can easily calculate the total length of the sticky spiral we find that in one sitting each time that she remakes her web the angular epeira produces some twenty yards of gummy thread the more skilful silky epeira produces thirty well during two months the angular epeira my neighbour renewed her snare nearly every evening during that period she manufac tured something like threequarters of a mile of this tubular thread rolled into a tight twist and bulging with glue i should like an anatomist endowed with better implements than mine and with less tired eyesight to explain to us the work of the marvellous ropeyard how is the silky mat ter moulded into a capillary tube how is this tube filled with glue and tightly twisted and how does this same wiremill also turn out plain threads wrought first into a frame work and then into muslin and satin next a russet foam such as fills the wallet of the banded epeira next the black stripes stretched in meridian curves on that same wallet what a number of products to come from that curious factory a spiders belly i behold the results but fail to understand the working of the machine i leave the problem to the masters of the microtome and the scalpel of the six garden spiders that form the object of my observations two only the banded and the silky epeira remain con stantly in their webs even under the blinding rays of a fierce sun the others as a rule do not show themselves until nightfall at some distance from the net they have a rough and ready retreat in the brambles an ambush made of a few leaves held together by stretched threads it is here that for the most part they remain in the daytime motionless and sunk in meditation but the shrill light that vexes them is the joy of the fields at such times the locust hops more nimbly than ever more gaily skims the dragonfly besides the limy web despite the rents suffered during the night is still in serviceable condition if some giddypate allow himself to be caught will the spider at the distance whereto she has retired be unable to take advantage of the windfall never fear she arrives in a flash how is she apprised let us explain the matter the alarm is given by the vibration of the web much more than by the sight of the cap tured object a very simple experiment will prove this i lay upon a banded epeiras limethreads a locust that second asphyxiated with carbon disulphide the carcass is placed in front or behind or at either side of the spider who sits moveless in the centre of the net if the test is to be applied to a species with a daytime hidingplace amid the foliage the dead locust is laid on the web more or less near the centre no matter how in both cases nothing happens at first the epeira remains in her motionless attitude even when the morsel is at a short distance in front of her she is indifferent to the presence of the game does not seem to per ceive it so much so that she ends by wearing out my patience then with a long straw which enables me to conceal myself slightly i set the dead insect trembling that is quite enough the banded epeira and the silky epeira hasten to the central floor the others come down from the branch all go to the locust swathe him with tape treat him in short as they would treat a live prey captured under normal conditions it took the shaking of the web to decide them to attack perhaps the grey colour of the locust is not sufficiently conspicuous to attract attention by itself then let us try red the brightest colour to our retina and probably also to the spiders none of the game hunted by the epeirae being clad in scarlet i make a small bundle out of red wool a bait of the size of a locust i glue it to the web my stratagem succeds as long as the parcel is stationary the spider is not roused but the moment it trembles stirred by my straw she runs up eagerly there are silly ones who just touch the thing with their legs and without further en quiries swathe it in silk after the manner of the usual game they even go so far as to dig their fangs into the bait following the rule of the preliminary poisoning then and then only the mistake is recogn and the tricked spider retires and does not come back unless it be long afterwards when she flings the lumbersome object out of the web there are also clever ones like the others these hasten to the redwoollen lure which my straw insidiously keeps moving they come from their tent among the leaves as readily as from the centre of the web they explore it with their palpi and their legs but soon perceiving that the thing is valueless they are careful not to spend their silk on useless bonds my quivering bait does not deceive them it is flung out after a brief inspection still the clever ones like the silly ones run even from a distance from their leafy am bush how do they know certainly not by sight before recognizing their mistake they have to hold the object between their legs and even to nibble at it a little they are ex tremely shortsighted at a handvbreadths distance the lifeless prey unable to shake the web remains unperceived besides in many cases the hunting takes place in the dense darkness of the night when sight even if it were good would not avail if the eyes are insufficient guides even close at hand how will it be when the prey has to be spied from afar i in that case an intelligenceapparatus for longdistance work becomes indispensable we have no difficulty in detecting the apparatus let us look attentively behind the web of any epeira with a daytime hidingplace we shall see a thread that starts from the centre of the network ascends in a slanting line out side the plane of the web and ends at the am bush where the spider lurks all day except at the central point there is no connection be tween this thread and the rest of the work no interweaving with the scaffoldingthreads free of impediment the line runs straight from the centre of the net to the ambushtent its length averages twentytwo inches the angular epeira settled high up in the trees has shown me some as long as eight or nine feet there is no doubt that this slanting line is a footbridge which allows the spider to re pair hurriedly to the web when summoned by urgent business and then when her round is finished to return to her hut in fact it is the road which i see her follow in going and coming but is that all no for if the epeira had no aim in view but a means of rapid transit between her tent and the net the footbridge would be fastened to the upper edge of the web the journey would be shorter and the slope less steep why moreover does this line always start in the centre of the sticky network and never elsewhere because that is the point where the spokes meet and therefore the common centre of vibration anything that moves upon the web sets it shaking all then that is needed is a thread issuing from this central point to convey to a distance the news of a prey struggling in some part or other of the net the slanting cord extending outside the plane of the web is more than a footbridge it is above all a signallingapparatus a telegraphwire let us try experiment i place a locust on the network caught in the sticky toils he plunges about forthwith the spider issues impetuously from her hut comes down the footbridge makes a rush for the locust wraps him up and operates on him according to rule soon after she hoists him fastened by a line to her spinneret and drags him to her hidingplace where a long banquet will be held so far nothing new things happen as usual i leave the spider to mind her own affairs for some days before i interfere with her i again propose to give her a locust but this time i first cut the signallingthread with a touch of the scissors without shaking any part of the edifice the game is then laid on the web complete success the entangled insect struggles sets the net quivering the spider on her side does not stir as though heedless of events the idea might occur to one that in this business the epeira stays motionless in her cabin since she is prevented from hurrying down because the footbridge is broken let us undeceive ourselves for one road open to her there are a hundred all ready to bring her to the place where her presence is now re quired the network is fastened to the branches by a host of lines all of them very easy to cross well the epeira embarks upon none of them but remains moveless and selfabsorbed why because her telegraph being out of order no longer tells her of the shaking of the web the captured prey is too far off for her to see it she is all unwitting a good hour passes with the locust still kicking the spider impassive myself watching nevertheless in the end the epeira wakes up no longer feel ing the signallingthread broken by my scissors as taut as usual under her legs she comes to enquire into the state of things the web is reached without the least difficulty by one of the lines of the framework the first that offers the locust is then perceived and forthwith enswathed after which the signal lingthread is remade taking the place of the one which i have broken along this road the spider goes home dragging her prey behind her my neighbour the mighty angular epeira with her telegraphwire nine feet long has even better things in store for me one morn ing i find her web which is now deserted almost intact a proof that the nights hunting has not been good the animal must be hungry with a piece of game for a bait i hope to bring her down from her lofty retreat i entangle in the web a rare morsel a dragonfly who struggles desperately and sets the whole net ashaking the other up above leaves her lurkingplace amid the cypress foliage strides swiftly down along her telegraphwire comes to the dragonfly trusses her and at once climbs home again by the same road with her prize dangling at her heels by a thread the final sacrifice will take place in the quiet of the leafy sanctuary a few days later i renew my experiment under the same conditions but this time i first cut the signallingthread in vain i select a large dragonfly a very restless prisoner in vain i exert my patience the spider does not come down all day her telegraph being broken she receives no notice of what is hap pening nine feet below the entangled morsel remains where it lies not despised but un known at nightfall the epeira leaves her cabin passes over the ruins of her web finds the dragonfly and eats her on the spot after which the net is renewed one of the epeirae whom i have had the opportunity of examining simplifies the system while retaining the essential mechan ism of a transmissionthread this is the crater epeira epeira crater a walck a species seen in spring at which time she indulges especially in the chase of the domestic bee upon the flowering rosemaries at the leafy end of a branch she builds a sort of silken shell the shape and size of an acorn cup this is where she sits with her paunch contained in the round cavity and her fore legs resting on the ledge ready to leap the lazy creature loves this position and rarely stations herself head downwards on the web as do the others cosily ensconced in the hollow of her cup she awaits the approaching game her web which is vertical as is the rule among the epeirae is of a fair size and always very near the bowl wherein the spider takes her ease moreover it touches the bowl by means of an angular extension and the angle always contains one spoke which the epeira seated so to speak in her crater has con stantly under her legs this spoke springing from the common focus of the vibrations from all parts of the network is eminently fitted to keep the spider informed of whatsoever hap pens it has a double office it forms part of the catherinewheel supporting the lime threads and it warns the epeira by its vibra tions a special thread is here superfluous the other snarers on the contrary who occupy a distant retreat by day cannot do without a private wire that keeps them in per manent communication with the deserted web all of them have one in point of fact but only when age comes age prone to rest and to long slumbers in their youth the epeirs who are then very wideawake know nothing of the art of telegraphy besides their web a shortlived work whereof hardly a trace re mains on the morrow does not allow of this kind of industry it is no use going to the expense of a signallingapparatus for a ruined snare wherein nothing can now be caught only the old spiders meditating or dozing in their green tent are warned from afar by telegraph of what takes place on the web to save herself from keeping a close watch that would degenerate into drudgery and to remain alive to events even when resting with her back turned on the net the ambushed spider always has her foot upon the telegraph wire of my observations on this subject let me relate the following which will be suf ficient for our purpose an angular epeira with a remarkably fine belly has spun her web between two laurestineshrubs covering a width of nearly a yard the sun beats upon the snare which is abandoned long before dawn the spider is in her day manor a resort easily discovered by following the telegraphwire it is a vaulted chamber of dead leaves joined to gether with a few bits of silk the refuge is deep the spider disappears in it entirely all but her rounded hindquarters which bar the entrance to the donjon with her front half plunged into the back of her hut the epeira certainly cannot see her web even if she had good sight instead of being purblind her position could not possibly allow her to keep the prey in view does she give up hunting during this period of bright sunlight not at all look again wonderful one of her hindlegs is stretched outside the leafy cabin and the signallingthread ends just at the tip of that leg whoso has not seen the epeira in this attitude with her hand so to speak on the telegraphreceiver knows nothing of one of the most curious instances of animal clever ness let any game appear upon the scene and the slumberer forthwith aroused by means of the leg receiving the vibrations hastens up a locust whom i myself lay on the web pro cures her this agreeable shock and what fol lows if she is satisfied with her bag i am still more satisfied with what i have learnt the occasion is too good not to find out under better conditions as regards approach what the inhabitant of the cypresstrees has already shown me the next morning i cut the telegraphwire this time as long as ones arm and held like yesterday by one of the hindlegs stretched outside the cabin i then place on the web a double prey a dragonfly and a locust the latter kicks out with his long spurred shanks the other flutters her wings the web is tossed about to such an extent that a number of leaves just beside the epeiras nest move shaken by the threads of the framework affixed to them and this vibration though so close at hand does not rouse the spider in the least does not make her even turn round to enquire what is going on the moment that her signallingthread ceases to work she knows nothing of passing events all day long she remains without stirring in the evening at eight oclock she sallies forth to weave the new web and at last finds the rich windfall whereof she was hitherto unaware one word more the web is often shaken by the wind the different parts of the framework tossed and teased by the eddying aircurrents cannot fail to transmit their vi bration to the signallingthread nevertheless the spider does not quit her hut and remains indifferent to the commotion prevailing in the net her line therefore is something better than a bellrope that pulls and communicates the impulse given it is a telephone capable like our own of transmitting infinitesimal waves of sound clutching her telephonewire with a toe the spider listens with her leg she perceives the innermost vibrations she dis tinguishes between the vibration proceeding from a prisoner and the mere shaking caused by the wind notwithstanding the importance of the subject i shall not enlarge upon the nuptials of the epeirae grim natures whose loves easily turn to tragedy in the mystery of the night i have but once been present at the pairing and for this curious experience i must thank my lucky star and my fat neighbour the angular epeira whom i visit so often by lanternlight here you have it it is the first week of august at about nine oclock in the evening under a perfect sky in calm hot weather the spider has not yet constructed her web and is sitting motionless on her suspensioncable the fact that she should be slacking like this at a time when her buildingoperations ought to be in full swing naturally astonishes me can something un usual be afoot even so i see hastening up from the neighbouring bushes and embarking on the cable a male a dwarf who is coming the whippersnapper to pay his respects to the portly giantess how has he in his distant corner heard of the presence of the nymph ripe for marriage among the spiders these things are learnt in the silence of the night without a summons without a signal none knows how once the

expedition is attained the whippersnapper makes off at full speed as though he had the furies at his heels if he remained he would presumably be eaten these exercises on the tightrope are not re peated i kept watch in vain on the following evenings i never saw the fellow again when he is gone the bride descends from the cable spins her web and assumes the huntingattitude we must eat to have silk we must have silk to eat and especially to weave the expensive cocoon of the family there is therefore no rest not even after the excitement of being married the epirae are monuments of patience in their limesnare with her head down and her eight legs widespread the spider occupies the centre of the web the receivingpoint of the information sent along the spokes if anywhere behind or before a vibration occur the sign of a capture the epeira knows about it even without the aid of sight she hastens up at once until then not a movement one would think that the animal was hypnot by her watching at most on the appearance of any thing suspicious she begins shaking her nest this is her way of inspiring the intruder with awe if i myself wish to provoke the singular alarm i have but to tease the epeira with a bit of straw you cannot have a swing with out an impulse of some sort the terror stricken spider who wishes to strike terror in to others has hit upon something much better with nothing to push her she swings with her floor of ropes there is no effort no visible exertion not a single part of the animal moves and yet everything trembles violent shaking proceeds from apparent inertia rest causes commotion when calm is restored she resumes her attitude ceaselessly pondering the harsh prob lem of life shall i dine today or not certain privileged beings exempt from those anxieties have food in abundance and need not struggle to obtain it such is the gentle who swims blissfully in the broth of the putrefying adder odiers  and by a strange irony of fate these are generally the most gifted only manage to eat by dint of craft and patience you are of their company o my industrious epeirael so that you may dine you spend your treasures of patience nightly and often without result i sympathize with your woes for ly who am as concerned as you about my daily bread i also doggedly spread my net the net for catching ideas a more elusive and less substantial prize than the moth let us not lose heart the best part of life is not in the present still less in the past it lies in the future the domain of hope let us wait all day long the sky of a uniform grey has appeared to be brewing a storm in spite of the threatened downpour my neighbour who is a shrewd weatherprophet has come out of the cypresstree and begun to renew her web at the regular hour her forecast is correct it will be a fine night see the steamingpan of the clouds splits open and through the apertures the moon peeps in quisitively i too lantern in hand am peep ing a gust of wind from the north clears the realms on high the sky becomes magnificent perfect calm reigns below the moths begin their nightly rounds good i one is caught a mighty fine one the spider will dine today what happens next in an uncertain light does not lend itself to accurate observation it is better to turn to those garden spiders who never leave their web and who hunt mainly in the daytime the banded and the silky epeira both of whom live on the rose maries in the enclosure shall show us in broad daylight the innermost details of the tragedy i myself place on the limesnare a victim of my selecting its six legs are caught without more ado if the insect raises one of its tarsi and pulls towards itself the treacherous thread follows unwinds slightly and without letting go or breaking yields to the captives desperate jerks any limb released only tangles the others still more and is speedily recaptured by the sticky matter there is no means of escape except by smashing the trap with a sudden effort whereof even powerful insects are not always capable warned by the shaking of the net the epeira hastens up she turns round about the quarry she inspects it at a distance so as to ascertain the extent of the danger before attacking the strength of the snareling will decide the plan of campaign let us first suppose the usual case that of an average head of game a moth or fly of some sort facing her prisoner the spider contracts her abdomen slightly and touches the insect for a moment with the end of her spinnerets then with her front tarsi she sets her victim spinning the squirrel in the moving cylinder of his cage does not display a more graceful or nimbler dexterity a crossbar of the sticky spiral serves as an axis for the tiny machine which turns turns swiftly like a spit it is a treat to the eyes to see it revolve what is the object of this circular motion see the brief contact of the spinnerets has given a startingpoint for a thread which the spider must now draw from her silk warehouse and gradually roll around the captive so as to swathe him in a winding sheet which will overpower any effort made it is the exact process employed in our wire mills a motordriven spool revolves and by its action draws the wire through the narrow eyelet of a steel plate making it of the fineness required and with the same movement winds it round and round its collar even so with the epeiras work the spiders front tarsi are the motor the revolv ing spool is the captured insect the steel eyelet is the aperture of the spinnerets to bind the subject with precision and dispatch nothing could be better than this inexpensive and highlyeffective method less frequently a second process is em ployed with a quick movement the spider herself turns round about the motionless in sect crossing the web first at the top and then at the bottom and gradually placing the fasten ings of her line the great elasticity of the limethreads allows the epeira to fling herself time after time right into the web and to pass through it without damaging the net let us now suppose the case of some danger ous game a praying mantis for instance brandishing her lethal limbs each hooked and fitted with a double saw an angry hornet darting her awful sting a sturdy beetle invincible under his horny armour these are exceptional morsels hardly ever known to the epeirae will they be accepted if supplied by my stratagems they are but not without caution the game is seen to be perilous of approach and the spider turns her back upon it instead of facing it she trains her ropecannon upon it quickly the hindlegs draw from the spin nerets something much better than single cords the whole silkbattery works at one and the same time firing a regular volley of ribbons and sheets which a wide movement of the legs spreads fanwise and flings over the entangled prisoner guarding against sudden starts the epeira casts her armfuls of bands on the front and hindparts over the legs and over the wings here there and everjrwhere extravagantly the most fiery prey is promptly mastered under this avalanche in vain the mantis tries to open her sawtoothed armguards in vain the hornet makes play with her dagger in vain the beetle stiffens his legs and arches his back a fresh wave of threads swoops down and paralyzes every effort these lavished farflung ribbons threaten to exhaust the factory it would be much more economical to resort to the method of the spool but to turn the machine the spider would have to go up to it and work it with her leg this is too risky and hence the contin ous spray of silk at a safe distance when all is used up there is more to come still the epeira seems concerned at this excessive outlay when circumstances permit she gladly returns to the mechanism of the revolving spool i saw her practise this abrupt change of tactics on a big beetle with a smooth plump body which lent itself admirably to the rotary process after de priving the beast of all power of movementi she went up to it and turned her corpulent victim as she would have done with a medium s moth but with the praying mantis sticking out her long legs and her spreading wings rotation is no longer feasible then until the quarry is thoroughly subdued the spray of bandages goes on continuously even to the point of dry ing up the silkglands a capture of this kind is ruinous it is true that except when i in terfered i have never seen the spider tackle that formidable provender be it feeble or strong the game is now neatly trussed by one of the two methods the next move never varies the bound in sect is bitten without persistency and without any wound that shows the spider next retires and allows the bite to act which it soon does she then returns if the victim be small a clothesmoth for instance it is consumed on the spot at the place where it was captured but for a prize of some importance on which she hopes to feast for many an hour sometimes for many a day the spider needs a sequestered dining room where there is naught to fear from the stickiness of the network before going to it she first makes her prey turn in the converse direction to that of the original rotation her object is to free the nearest spokes which supplied pivots for the machinery they are essential factors which it behoves her to keep intact if need be by sacrificing a few crossbars it is done the twisted ends are put back into position the welltrussed game is at last removed from the web and fastened on behind with a thread the spider then marches in front and the load is trundled across the web and hoisted to the restingfloor which is both an inspectionpost and a dining hall when the spider is of a species that shuns the light and possesses a telegraphline she mounts to her daytime hidingplace along this line with the game bumping against her heels while she is refreshing herself let us enquire into the effects of the little bite pre viously administered to the silkswathed captive does the spider kill the patient with a view to avoiding unseasonable jerks pro tests so disagreeable at dinnertime several reasons make me doubt it in the first place the attack is so much veiled as to have all the appearance of a mere kiss besides it is made anywhere at the first spot that offers the expert slayers employ methods of the highest precision they give a stab in the neck or un der the throat they wound the cervical nerve centres the seat of energy the paralyzers those accomplished anatomists poison the motor nervecentres of which they know the number and position the epeira possesses none of this fearsome knowledge she in serts her fangs at random as the bee does her sting she does not select one spot rather than another she bites indifferently at what ever comes within reach this being so her poison would have to possess unparalleled virulence to produce a corpselike inertia no matter which the point attacked i can scarcely believe in instantaneous death resulting from the bite especially in the case of insects with their highlyresistant organisms besides is it really a corpse that the epeira wants she who feeds on blood much more cf insect life by j h fabrc translated by the author of mademoiselle mori chap vtranslators note than on flesh it were to her advantage to suck a live body wherein the flow of the liquids set in movement by the pulsation of the dorsal vessel that rudimentary heart of insects must act more freely than in a life less body with its stagnant fluids the game which the spider means to suck dry might very well not be dead this is easily ascertained i place some locusts of different species on the webs in my menagerie one on this another on that the spider comes rushing up binds the prey nibbles at it gently and withdraws waiting for the bite to take effect i then take the insect and carefully strip it of its silken shroud the locust is not dead far from it one would even think that he had suffered no harm i examine the released prisoner through the lens in vain i can see no trace of a wound can he be unscathed in spite of the sort of kiss which i saw given to him just now you would be ready to say so judging by the furious way in which he kicks in my fingers nevertheless when put on the ground he walks awkwardly he seems reluctant to hop perhaps it is a temporary trouble caused by his terrible excitement in the web it looks as though it would soon pass i lodge my locusts in cages with a lettuce leaf to console them for their trials but they will not be comforted a day elapses fol lowed by a second not one of them touches the leaf of salad their appetite has disap peared their movements become more uncertain as though hampered by irresistible torpor on the second day they are dead every one irrecoverably dead the epeira therefore does not inconti nently kill her prey with her delicate bite she poisons it so as to produce a gradual weak ness which gives the bloodsucker ample time to drain her victim without the least risk before the rigor mortis stops the flow of moisture the meal lasts quite twentyfour hours if the joint be large and to the very end the butchered insect retains a remnant of life a favourable condition for the exhausting of the juices once again we see a skilful method of slaughter very different from the tactics in use among the expert paralyzers or slayers here there is no display of anatomical science unacquainted with the patients structure th spider stabs at random the virulence of the poison does the rest there are however some very few cases in which the bite is speedily mortal my notes mention an angular epeira grappling with the largest dragonfly in my district shna grandis lin i myself had entangled in the web this head of big game which is not often captured by the epeirae the net shakes violently seems bound to break its moorings the spider rushes from her leafy villa runs boldly up to the giantess flings a single bundle of ropes at her and without further precau tions grips her with her legs tries to subdue her and then digs her fangs into the dragon flys back the bite is prolonged in sudi a way as to astonish me this is not the per functory kiss with which i am already familiar it is a deep determined wound after striking her blow the spider retires to a certain distance and waits for her poison to take effect i at once remove the dragonfly she is dead really and truly dead laid upon my table and left alone for twentyfour hours she makes not the slightest movement a prick of which my lens cannot sec the marks so sharppointed are the epeiras weapons was enough with a little insistence to kill the powerful animal proportionately the rattlesnake the horned viper the trigono cephilus and other illfamed serpents produce less paralyzing effects upon their victims and these epeirae so terrible to insects i am able to handle without any fear my skin does not suit them if i persuaded them to bite me what would happen to me hardly anything we have more cause to dread the sting of a nettle than the dagger which is fatal to dragonflies the same virus acts differently upon this organism and that is formidable here and quite mild there what kills the insect may easily be harmless to us let us not however generalize too far the narbonne lycosa that other enthusiastic insecthuntress would make us pay dearly if we attempted to take liberties with her it is not uninteresting to watch the epeira at dinner i light upon one the banded epeira at the moment about three oclock in the afternoon when she has captured a locust planted in the centre of the web on her restingfloor she attacks the venison at the joint of a haunch there is no movement not even of the mouthparts as far as i am able to discover the mouth lingers closeapplied at the point originally bitten there are no intermittent mouth fuls with the mandibles moving backwards and forwards it is a sort of continuous kiss i visit my epeira at intervals the mouth does not change its place i visit her for the last time at nine oclock in the evening matters stand exactly as they did after six hours consumption the mouth is still sucking at the lower end of the right haunch the fluid contents of the victim are transferred to the ogress belly i know not how next morning the spider is still at table i take away her dish naught remains of the locust but his skin hardly altered in shape but utterly drained and perforated in several places the method therefore was changed during the night to extract the nonfluent residue the viscera and muscles the stiff cuticle had to be tapped here there and else where after which the tattered husk placed bodily in the press of the mandibles would have been chewed rechewed and finally re duced to a pill which the sated spider throws up this would have been the end of the victim had i not taken it away before the time whether she wound or kill the epeira bites her captive somewhere or other no matter where this is an excellent method on her part because of the variety of the game that comes her way i see her accepting with equal readiness whatever chance may send her butterflies and dragonflies flies and wasps small dungbeetles and locusts if i offer her a mantis a bumblebee an anoxia  the equivalent of the common cockchafer  and other dishes probably unknown to her race she accepts all and any large and small thin skinned and homyskinned that which goes afoot and that which takes winged flight she is omnivorous she preys on everything down to her own kind should the occasion offer had she to operate according to individual structure she would need an anatomical dic tionary and instinct is essentially unfamiliar with generalities its knowledge is always con fined to limited points the cerceres know their weevils and their buprestlsbeetles abso lutely the sphex their grasshoppers their crickets and their locusts the scoliae their the scolia is a diggerwasp like the cerceris and cetonia and oryctesgrubs even so die other paralyzers each has her own victim and knows nothing of any of the others the same exclusive tastes prevail among the slayers let us remember in this connection philanthus apivorus and especially the thomisus the comely spider who cuts bees throats they understand the fatal blow either in the neck or under the chin a thing which the epeira does not understand but just because of this talent they are specialists their province is the domestic bee animals are a little like ourselves they excel in an art only on condition of special izing in it the epeira who being omniv orous is obliged to generalize abandons scientific methods and makes up for this by distilling a poison capable of producing torpor and even death no matter what the point attacked the sphex and feeds her larvae on the grubs of the cetonia or rosechafer and the oryctes or rhinoceros beetle cf the life and love of the insect by j henri fabre translated by alexander teixeira de mattos chap xi  translators note cf social life in the insect world by j h fabre translated by bernard miall chap xiii in which the name is given by a printers error as phuanthns avi porus translators note recognizing the large variety of game we wonder how the epeira manages not to hesitate amid those many diverse forms how for instance she passes from the locust to the butterfly so different in appearance to attribute to her as a guide an extensive zoo logical knowledge were wildly in excess of what we may reasonably expect of her poor intelligence the thing moves therefore it is worth catching this formula seems to sum up the spiders wisdom a dog has found a bone he lies in the shade holding it between his paws and studies it fondly it is his sacred property his chattel an epeira has woven her web here again is property and owning a better title than the other favoured by chance and assisted by his scent the dog has merely had a find he has neither worked nor paid for it the spider is more than a casual owner she has created what is hers its substance issued from her body its structure from her brain if ever property was sacrosanct hers is far higher stands the work of the weaver of ideas who tissues a book that other spiders web and out of his thought makes something that shall instruct or thrill us to protect our bone we have

left master of the bone he well knew that as things go success is no certificate of excellence others came the notorious evildoers of humanity who made a law of the savage maxim that might is right we are the larvae with the changing skins the ugly caterpillars of a society that is slowly very slowly wending its way to the triumph of right over might when will this sublime metamorphosis be accomplished to free ourselves from those wildbeast brutalitiesi must we wait for the oceanplains of the southern hemisphere to flow to our side chang ing the face of continents and renewing the glacial period of the reindeer and the mam moth perhaps so slow is moral progress true we have the bicycle the motorcar the dirigible airship and other marvellous means of breaking our bones but our mo rality is not one rung the higher for it all one would even say that the farther we proceed in our conquest of matter the more our morality recedes the most advanced of our inventions consists in bringing men down with grapeshot and explosives with the swift ness of the reaper mowing the corn would we see this might triumphant in all its beauty let us spend a few weeks in the epeiras company she is the owner of a web her work her most lawful property the question at once presents itself does the spider possibly recognize her fabric by certain trademarks and distinguish it from that of her fellows i bring about a change of webs between two neighbouring banded epeirae no sooner is either placed upon the strange net than she makes for the central floor settles herself head downwards and does not stir from it satisfied with her neighbours web as with her own neither by day nor by night does she try to shift her quarters and restore matters to their pristine state both spiders think themselves in their own domain the two pieces of work are so much alike that i almost expected this i then decide to affect an exchange of webs between two different species i move the banded epeira to the net of the silky epeira and vice versa the two webs are now dis similar the silky epciras has a limy spiral consisting of closer and more numerous circles what will the spiders do when thus put to the test of the unknown one would think that when one of them found meshes too wide for her under her feet the other meshes too narrow they would be frightened by this sud den change and decamp in terror not at all without a sign of perturbation they remain plant themselves in the centre and await the coming of the game as though nothing extraordinary had happened they do more than this days pass and as long as the un familiar web is not wrecked to the extent of being unserviceable they make no attempt to weave another in their own style the spider therefore is incapable of recognizing her web she takes anothers work for hers even when it is produced by a stranger to her race we now come to the tragic side of this con fusion wishing to have subjects for study within my daily reach and to save myself the trouble of casual excursions i collect different epeirae whom i find in the course of my walks and establish them on the shrubs in my enclosure in this way a rosemaryhedge sheltered from the wind and facing the sun is turned into a wellstocked menagerie i take the spiders from the paper bags wherein i had put them separately to carry them and place them on the leaves with no further precaution it is for them to make themselves at home as a rule they do not budge all day from the place where i put them they wait for night fall before seeking a suitable site whereon to weave a net some among them show less patience a little while ago they possessed a web between the reeds of a brook or in the holmoak copses and now they have none they go off in search to recover their property or seize on some one elses it is all the same to them i come upon a banded epeira newly im ported making for the web of a silky epeira who has been my guest for some days since the owner is at her post in the centre of the net she awaits the stranger with seeming impassiveness then suddenly they grip each other and a desperate fight begins the silky epeira is worsted the other swathes her in bonds drags her to the nonlimy central floor and in the calmest fashion eats her the dead spider is munched for twentyfour hours and drained to the last drop when the corpse a wretched crumpled ball is at last flung aside the web so foully conquered be comes the property of the stranger who uses it if it have not suffered too much in the contest there is here a shadow of an excuse the two spiders were of different species and the struggle for life often leads to these exter minations among such as are not akin what would happen if the two belonged to the same species it is easily seen i cannot rely upon spontaneous invasions which may be rare under normal conditions and i myself place a banded epeira on her kinswomans web a furious attack is made forthwith victory after hanging for a moment in the balance is once again decided in the strangers fa vour the vanquished party this time a sister is eaten without the slightest scruple her web becomes the property of the victor there it is in all its horror the right of might to eat ones like and take away their goods man did the same in days of old he stripped and ate his fellows we continue to rob one another both as nations and as indi viduals but we no longer eat one another the custom has grown obsolete since we dis covered an acceptable substitute in the mutton chop let us not however blacken the spider beyond her deserts she does not live by war ring on her kith and kin she does not of her own accord attempt the conquest of anothers property it needs extraordinary circum stances to rouse her to these villainies i take her from her web and place her on anothers from that moment she knows no distinction between meum and tuum the thing which the leg touches at once becomes real estate and the intruder if she be the stronger ends by eating the occupier a radical means of cutting short disputes apart from disturbances similiar to those which i provoke disturbances that are possible in the everlasting conflict of events the spider jealous of her own web seems to respect the webs of others she never in dulges in brigandage against her fellows except when dispossessed of her net especially in the daytime for weaving is never done by day this work is reserved for the night when however she is deprived of her liveli hood and feels herself the stronger then she attacks her neighbour rips her open feeds on her and takes possession of her goods let us make allowances and proceed we will now examine spiders of more alien habits the banded and the silky epeira differ greatly in form and colouring the first has a plump oliveshaped belly richly belted with white brightyellow and black the seconds abdomen is flat of a silky white and pinked into festoons judging only by dress and figure we should not think of closely connecting the two spiders but high above shapes tower tendencies those main characteristics which our methods of classification so particular about minute details of form ought to consult more widely than they do the two dissimilar spiders have exactly similar ways of living both of them prefer to hunt by day and never leave their webs both sign their work with a zigzag flourish their nets are almost identical so much so that the banded epeira uses the silky epeiras web after eating its owner the silky epeira on her side when she is the stronger dispossesses her belted cousin and devours her each is at home on the others web when the argument of might triumphant has ended the discussion let us next take the case of the cross spider a hairy beast of varying shades of reddishbrown she has three large white spots upon her back forming a triplebarred cross she hunts mostly at night shuns the sun and lives by day on the adjacent shrubs in a shady retreat which communicates with the limesnare by means of a telegraphwire her web is very similar in structure and ap pearance to those of the two others what will happen if i procure her the visit of a banded epeira the lady of the triple cross is invaded by day in the full light of the sun thanks to my mischievous intermediary the web is de serted the proprietress is in her leafy hut the telegraphwire performs its office the cross spider hastens down strides all round her property beholds the danger and hurriedly returns to her hidingplace with out taking any measures against the in truder the latter on her side does not seem to be enjoying herself were she placed on the web of one of her sisters or even on that of the silky epeira she would have posted herself in the centre as soon as the struggle had ended in the others death this time there is no struggle for the web is deserted nothing prevents her from taking her position in the centre the chief strategic point and yet she does not move from the place where i put her i tickle her gently with the tip of a long straw when at home if teased in this way the banded epeira  like the others for that matter  violently shakes the web to intim idate the aggressor this time nothing happens despite my repeated enticements the spider doe not stir a limb it is as though she were numbed with terror and she has reason to be the other is watching her from her lofty loophole this is probably not the only cause of her fright when my straw does induce her to take a few steps i see her lift her legs with some difficulty she tugs a bit drags her tarsi till she almost breaks the supporting threads it is not the progress of an agile ropewalker it is the hesitating gait of entangled feet perhaps the limethreads are stickier than in her own web the glue is of a different quality and her sandals are not greased to the extent which the new degree of adhesiveness would demand anyhow things remain as they are for long hours on end the banded epeira motionless on the edge of the web the other lurking in her hut both apparently most uneasy at sunset the lover of darkness pludks up courage she descends from her green tent and without troubling about the stranger goes straight to the centre of the web where the telegraphwire brings her panicstricken at this apparition the banded epeira releases herself with a jerk and disappears in the rosemarythicket the experiment though repeatedly re newed with different subjects gave me no other results distrustful of a web dissimilar to her own if not in structure at least in stick iness the bold banded epeira shows the white feather and refuses to attack the cross spider the latter on her side either does not budge from her day shelter in the foliage or else rushes back to it after taking a hurried glance at the stranger she here awaits the coming of the night under favour of the darkness which gives her fresh courage and activity she reappears upon the scene and puts the intruder to flight by her mere presence aided if need be by a cuff or two injured right is die victor morality is satisfied but let us not con gratulate the spider therefore if the invader respects the invaded it is because very serious reasons impel her first she would have to contend with an adversary ensconced in a stronghold whose ambushes are unknown to the assailant secondly the web if con quered would be inconvenient to use because of the limethreads possessing a different de gree of stickiness from those which she knows so well to risk ones skin for a thing of doubtful value were twice foolish the spider knows this and forbears but let the banded epeira deprived of her web come upon that of one of her kind or of the silky epeira who works her gummy twine in the same manner then discretion is thrown to the winds the owner is fiercely ripped open and possession taken of the property might is right says the beast or rather it knows no right the animal world is a rout of appetites acknowledging no other rein than impotence mankind alone capable of emerging from the slough of the instincts is bringing equity into being is creating it slowly as its conception grows clearer out of the sacred rushlight so flickering as yet but gain ing strength from age to age man will make a flaming torch that will put an end among us to the principles of the brutes and one day utterly change the face of society hile the epeirae with their gor v geous nettapestries are incomparable weavers many other spiders excel in ingenious devices for filling their stomachs and leaving a lineage behind them the tvyo primary laws of living things some of them are celebrities of longstanding renown who are mentioned in all the books certain mygales inhabit a burrow like the narbonne lycosa but of a perfection un known to the brutal spider of the wastelands the lycosa surrounds the mouth of her shaft with a simple parapet a mere collection of tiny pebbles sticks and silk the others fix a movable door to theirs a round shutter with a hinge a groove and a set of bolts when the mygale comes home the lid drops into the groove and fits so exactly that there is no possibility of distinguishing the join if the or bird spiders known also as the american taran tula  translators note aggressor persist and seek to raise the trap door the recluse pushes the bolt that is to say plants her claws into certain holes on the op posite side to the hinge props herself against the wall and holds the door firmly another the argyroneta or water spider builds herself an elegant silken divingbell in which she stores air thus supplied with the wherewithal to breathe she awaits the com ing of the game and keeps herself cool mean while at times of scorching heat hers must be a regular sybaritic abode such as eccentric man has sometimes ventured to build under water with mighty blocks of stone and marble the submarine palaces of tiberius are no more than an odious memory the water spiders dainty cupola still flourishes if i possessed documents derived from per sonal observation i should like to speak of these ingenious workers i would gladly add a few unpublished facts to their hfehistory but i must abandon the idea the water spider is not found in my district the mygale the expert in hinged doors is found there but very seldom i saw one once on the edge of a path skirting a copse oppor tunity as we know is fleeting the observer more than any other is obliged to take it by the forelock preoccupied as i was with other researches i but gave a glance at the mag nificent subject which good fortune offered the opportunity fled and has never returned let us make up for it with trivial things of frequent encounter a condition favourable to consecutive study what is common is not necessarily unimportant give it our sus tained attention and we shall discover in it merits which our former ignorance prevented us from seeing when patiently entreated the least of creatures adds its note to the har monies of life in the fields around traversed in these days with a tired step but still vigilantly explored i find nothing so often as the labyrinth spider agelena labyrinthica clerck not a hedge but shelters a few at its foot amid the grass in quiet sunny nooks in the open country and especially in hilly places laid bare by the woodmans axe the favourite sites are tufts of bracken rock rose lavender everlasting and rosemary cropped close by the teeth of the flocks this is where i resort as the isolation and kind liness of the supports lend themselves to pro ceedings which might not be tolerated by the unfriendly hedge several times a week in july i go to study my spiders on the spot at an early hour before the sun beats fiercely on ones neck the children accompany me each provided with an orange wherewith to slake the thirst that will not be slow in coming they lend me their good eyes and supple limbs the expedition promises to be fruitful we soon discover high silk buildings be trayed at a distance by the glittering threads which the dawn has converted into dewy rosaries the children are wonderstruck at those glorious chandeliers so much so that they forget their oranges for a moment nor am i on my part indifferent a splendid spectacle indeed is that of our spiders laby rinth heavy with the tears of the night and lit up by the first rays of the sun accompanied as it is by the thrushes symphony this alone is worth getting up for half an hours heat and the magic jewels disappear with the dew now is the moment to inspect the webs here is one spreading its sheet over a large cluster of rockroses it is the size of a handkerchief a profusion of guyropes attached to any chance projection moor it to the brushwood there is not a twig but supplies a contactpoint entwined on every side surrounded and surmounted the bush disappears from view veiled in white muslin the web is flat at the edges as far as the unevenness of the support permits and gradu ally hollows into a crater not unlike the bell of a huntinghorn the central portion is a coneshaped gulf a funnel whose neck narrowing by degrees dives perpendicularly into the leafy thicket to a depth of eight or nine inches at the entrance to the tube in the gloom of that murderous alley sits the spider who looks at us and betrays no great excitement at our presence she is grey modestly adorned on the thorax with two black ribbons and on the abdomen with two stripes in which white specks alternate with brown at the tip of the belly two small mobile appendages form a sort of tail a rather curious feature in a spider the cratershaped web is not of the same structure throughout at the borders it is a gossamer weft of sparse threads nearer die centre the texture becomes first fine muslin and then satin lower still on the narrower part of the opening it is a network of roughly lozenged meshes lastly the neck of the funnel the usual restingplace is formed of solid silk the spider never ceases working at her carpet which represents her investigation platform every night she goes to it walks over it inspecting her snares extending her domain and increasing it with new threads the work is done with the silk constantly hanging from the spinnerets and constantly extracted as the animal moves about the neck of the funnel being more often walked upon than the rest of the dwelling is therefore provided with a thicker upholstery beyond it are the slopes of the crater which are also muchfrequented regions spokes of some regularity fix the diameter of the mouth a swaying walk and the guiding aid of the caudal appendages have laid lozengy meshes across these spokes this part has been strengthened by the nightly rounds of inspec tion lastly come the lessvisited expanses which consequently have a thinner carpet at the bottom of the passage dipping into the brushwood we might expect to find a secret cabin a wadded cell where the spider would take refuge in her hours of leisure the reality is something entirely different the long funnelneck gapes at its lower end where a private door stands always ajar allowing the animal when hardpushed to escape through the grass and gain the open it is well to know this arrangement of the home if you wish to capture the spider with out hurting her when attacked from the front the fugitive runs down and slips through the posterngate at the bottom to look for her by rummaging in the brushwood often leads to nothing so swift is her flight besides a blind search entails a great risk of maiming her let us eschew violence which is but seldom successful and resort to craft we catch sight of the spider at the entrance to her tube if practicable squeeze the bottom of the tuft containing the neck of the funnel with both hands that is enough the animal is caught feeling its retreat cut off it readily darts into the paper screw held out to it if necessary it can be stimulated with a bit of straw in this way i fill my cages with subjects that have not been de moral by contusions the surface of the crater is not exactly a snare it is just possible for the casual pedes trian to catch his legs in the silky carpets but giddypates who come here for a walk must be very rare what is wanted is a trap capable of securing the game that hops or flies the epeira has her treacherous limed net the spider of the bushes has her no less treach erous labyrinth look above the web what a forest of ropes it might be the rigging of a ship dis abled by a storm they run from every twig of the supporting shrubs they are fastened to the tip of every branch there are long ropes and short ropes upright and slanting straight and bent taut and slack all crisscross and atange to the height of three feet or so in inextricable disorder the whole forms a chaos of netting a labyrinth which none can pass through unless he be endowed with wings of exceptional power we have here nothing similar to the lime threads used by the garden spiders the threads are not sticky they act only by their confused multitude would you care to see the trap at work throw a small locust into the rigging unable to obtain a steady foot hold on that shaky support he flounders about and the more he struggles the more he entangles his shackles the spider spying on the threshold of her abyss lets him have his way she does not run up the shrouds of the mastwork to seize the desperate prisoner she waits until his bonds of threads twisted back wards and forwards make him fall on the web he falls the other comes and flings herself upon her prostrate prey the attack is not without danger the locust is demoral rather than tied up it is merely bits of broken thread that he is trailing from his legs the bold assailant does not mind without troub ling like the epeirae to bury her capture un der a paralyzing shroud she feels it to make sure of its quality and then regardless of kicks inserts her fangs the bite is usually given at the lower end of a haunch not that this place is more vulner able than any other thinskinned part but probably because it has a better flavour the different webs which i inspect to study the food in the larder show me among other joints various flies and small butterflies and carcasses of almostuntouched locusts all deprived of their hindlegs or at least of one locusts legs often dangle emptied of their succulent contents on the edges of the web from the meathooks of the butchers shop in my urchindays days free from prejudices in regard to what one ate i like many others was able to appreciate that dainty it is the equivalent on a very small scale of the larger legs of the crayfish the riggingbuilder therefore to whom we have just thrown a locust attacks the prey at the lower end of a thigh the bite is a lingering one once the spider has planted her fangs she does not let go she drinks she sips she sucks when this first point is drained she passes on to others to the second haunch in particular until the prey becomes an empty hulk without losing its outline we have seen that garden spiders feed in a similar way bleeding their venison and drink ing it instead of eating it at last however in the comfortable postprandial hours they take up the drained morsel chew it rechew it and reduce it to a shapeless ball it is a dessert for the teeth to toy with the laby rinth spider knows nothing of the diversions of the table she flings the drained remnants out of her web without chewing them although it lasts long the meal is eaten in perfect safety from the first bite the locust becomes a lifeless thing the spiders poison has settled him the labyrinth is greatly inferior as a work of art to that advanced geometrical con trivance the garden spiders net and in spite of its ingenuity it does not give a favourable notion of its constructor it is hardly more than a shapeless scaffolding run up anyhow and yet like the others the builder of this slovenly edifice must have her own principles of beauty and accuracy as it is the prettily latticed mouth of the crater makes us suspect this the nest the mothers usual masterpiece will prove it to the full when layingtime is at hand the spider changes her residence she abandons her web in excellent condition she does not return to it whoso will can take possession of the house the hour has come to found the familyestablishment but where the spider knows right well i am in the dark mornings are spent in fruitless searches in vain i ransack the bushes that carry the webs i never find aught that realizes my hopes i learn the secret at last i chance upon a web which though deserted is not yet dilapi dated proving that it has been but lately quitted instead of hunting in the brushwood whereon it rests let us inspect the neighbour hood to a distance of a few paces if these contain a low thick cluster the nest is there hidden from the eye it carries an authentic certificate of its origin for the mother invari ably occupies it by this method of investigation far from the labyrinthtrap i become the owner of as many nests as are needed to satisfy my curi osity they do not by a long way come up to my idea of the maternal talent they are clumsy bundles of dead leaves roughly drawn together with silk threads under this rude covering is a pouch of fine texture containing the eggcasket all in very bad condition be cause of the inevitable tears incurred in its extrication from the brushwood no i shall not be able to judge of the artists capacity by these rags and tatters the insect in its buildings has its own architectural rules rules as unchangeable as anatomical peculiarities each group builds according to the same set of principles con forming to the laws of a very elementary system of aesthetics but often circumstances beyond the architects control  the space at her disposal the unevenness of the site the nature of the material and other accidental causes  interfere with the workers plans and disturb the structure then virtual regularity is translated into actual chaos order degen erates into disorder we might discover an interesting subject of research in the type adopted by each species when the work is accomplished without hin drances the banded epeira weaves the wal let of her eggs in the open on a slim branch that does not get in her way and her work is a superbly artistic jar the silky epeira also has all the elbowroom she needs and her paraboloid is not without elegance can the labyrinth spider that other spinstress of ac complished merit be ignorant of the precepts of beauty when the time comes for her to weave a tent for her offspring as yet what i have seen of her work is but an unsightly bundle is that all she can do i look for better things if circumstances favour her toiling in the midst of a dense thicket among a tangle of dead leaves and twigs she may well produce a very inaccurate piece of work but compel her to labour when free from all impediment she will then  i am convinced of it beforehand  apply her talents without constraint and show herself an adept in the building of graceful nests as layingtime approaches towards the middle of august i instal halfadozen laby rinth spiders in large wiregauze cages each standing in an earthen pan filled with sand a sprig of thyme planted in the centre will furnish supports for the structure together with the trelliswork of the top and sides there is no other furniture no dead leaves which would spoil the shape of the nest if the mother were minded to employ them as a covering by way of provision locusts every day they are readily accepted provided they be tender and not too large the experiment works perfectly august is hardly over before i am in possession of six nests magnificent in shape and of a dazzling whiteness the latitude of the workshop has enabled the spinstress to follow the inspiration of her instinct without serious obstacles and the result is a masterpiece of symmetry and elegance if we allow for a few angularities demanded by the suspensionpoints it is an oval of exquisite white muslin a diaphanous abode wherein the mother must make a long stay to watch over the brood t the size is nearly that of a hens egg the i cabin is open at either end the front entrance broadens into a gallery the back entrance tapers into a funnelneck i fail to see the object of this neck as for the open ing in front which is wider this is beyond a doubt a victuallingdoor i see the spider at intervals standing here on the lookout for the locust whom she consumes outside taking spotless sanctuary with i lj fjt corpses r the structure of the nest is not without a certain similarity to that of the home oc ti cupied during the huntingseason the passage at the back represents the funnelneck x li o x q that ran almost down to the ground and afforded an outlet for flight in case of grave a a danger the one in front expanding into a mouth kept wide open by cords stretched back x wards and forward recalls the yawning gulf y into which the victims used to fall every en part of the old dwelling is repeated even the labyrinth though this it is true is on a much snjaller scale in front of the bellshaped mouth is a tangle of threads wherein the passersby are caught each species in this way possesses a primary architectural model which is followed as a whole in spite of altered conditions the animal knows its trade thoroughly but it does not know and will never know aught else being incapable of originality now this palace of silk when all is said is nothing more than a guardhouse behind the soft milky opalescence of the wall glimmers the eggtabernacle with its form vaguely sug gesting the star of some order of knighthood it is a large pocket of a splendid deadwhite isolated on every side by radiating pillars which keep it motionless in the centre of the tapestry these pillars are about ten in num ber and are slender in the middle expanding at one end into a conical capital and at the other into a base of the same shape they face one another and mark the position of the vaulted corridors which allow free movement in every direction around the central chamber the mother walks gravely to and fro under the arches of her cloisters she stops first here then there she makes a lengthy auscultation of the eggwallet she listens to all that hap pens inside the satin wrapper to disturb her would be barbarous for a closer examination let us use the dilapidated nests which we brought from the fields apart from its pillars the eggpocket is an inverted conoid reminding us of the work of the silky epeira its material is rather stout my pincers pulling at it do not tear it without difficulty inside the bag there is nothing but an extremely fine white wad ding and lastly the eggs numbering about a hundred and comparatively large for they measure a millimetre and a half they arc very pale amberyellow beads which do not stick together and which roll freely as soon as i remove the swan vdown shroud let us put everything into a glasstube to study the hatching we will now retrace our steps a little when layingtime comes the mother forsakes her dwelling her crater into which her falling victims dropped her labyrinth in which the flight of the midges was cut short she leaves inchtranslatofs note intact the apparatus that enabled her to live at her ease thoughtful of her natural duties she goes to found another establishment at a distance why at a distance she has still a few long months to live and she needs norishment were it not better then to lodge the eggs in the immediate neighbourhood of the present home and to continue her hunting with the excellent snare at her disposal the watching of the nest and the easy acquisition of provender would go hand in hand the spider is of another opinion and i suspect the reason the sheetnet and the labyrinth that sur mounts it are objects visible from afar owing to their whiteness and the height whereat they are placed their scintillation in the sun in frequented paths attracts mosquitoes and butterflies like the lamps in our rooms and the fowlers lookingglass whoso comes to look at the bright thing too closely dies the victim of his curiosity there is nothing better for playing upon the folly of the passerby but also nothing more dangerous to the safety of the family harpies will not fail to come running at this signal showing up against the green guided by the position of the web they will assuredly find the precious purse and a strange grub feasting on a hundred newlaid eggs will ruin the establishment i do not know these enemies not having sufficient materials at my disposal for a register of the parasites but from indications gathered else where i suspect them the banded epeira trusting to the strength of her stuff fixes her nest in the sight of all hangs it on the brushwood taking no pre cautions whatever to hide it and a bad business it proves for her her jar provides me with an ichneumon possessed of the inoc ulating lardingpin a cryptus who as a grub had fed on spiders eggs nothing but empty shells was left inside the central keg the germs were completely exterminated there are other ichneumonflies moreover addicted to robbing spiders nests a basket of fresh eggs is their oflfsprings regular food like any other the labyrinth spider thc ichneumonflies are very small insects which carry long ovipositors wherewith they lay their eggs in the eggs of other insects and also more especially in caterpillars their parasitic larvae live and develop at the expense of the egg or grub attacked which degen erates in consequence  translators note dreads the scoundrelly advent of the pidc wallet she provides for it and to shield her self against it as far as possible chooses a hidingplace outside her dwelling far re moved from the telltale web when she feels her ovaries ripen she shifts her quarters she goes off at night to explore the neighbour hood and seek a less dangerous refuge the points selected are by preference the low brambles dragging along the ground keeping their dense verdure during the winter and crammed with dead leaves from the oaks hard by rosemarytufts which gain in thickness what they lose in height on the unfostering rock suit her particularly this is where i usually find her nest not without long seeking so well is it hidden so far there is no departure from current usage as the world is full of creatures on the prowl for tender mouthfuls every mother has her apprehensions she also has her nat ural wisdom which advises her to establish her family in secret places very few neglect this precaution each in her own manner con ceals the eggs she lays in the case of the labyrinth spider the protection of the brood is complicated by another condition in the vast majority of instances the eggs once lodged in a favour able spot are abandoned to themselves left to the chances of good or ill fortune the spider of the brushwood on the contrary en dowed with greater maternal devotion has like the crab spider to mount guard over hers until they hatch with a few threads and some small leaves joined together the crab spider builds above her lofty nest a rudimentary watch tower where she stays permanently greatly emaciated flattened into a sort of wrinkled shell through the emptying of her ovaries and the total absence of food and this mere shred hardly more than a skin that persists in living without eating stoutly defends her egg sack shows fight at the approach of any tramp she does not make up her mind to die until the little ones are gone the labyrinth spider is better treated after laying her eggs so far from becoming thin she preserves an excellent appearance and a round belly moreover she does not lose her appetite and is always prepared to bleed a locust she therefore requires a dwelling with a huntingbox close to the eggs watched over we know this dwelling built in strict accordance with artistic cannons un der the shelter of my cages remember the magnificent oval guard room running into a vestibule at either end the eggchamber slung in the centre and isolated on every side by half a score of pillars the fronthall expanding into a wide mouth and surmounted by a network of taut threads forming a trap the semitranspar ency of the walls allows us to see the spider engaged in her household affairs her cloister of vaulted passages enables her to pro ceed to any point of the starshaped pouch containing the eggs indefatigable in her rounds she stops here and there she fondly feels the satin listens to the secrets of the wal let if i shake the net at any point with a straw she quickly runs up to enquire what is happening will this vigilance frighten oif the ichneumon and other lovers of omelettes perhaps so but though this danger be averted others will come when the mother is no longer there her attentive watch does not make her overlook her meals one of the locusts whereof i renew the supply at intervals in the cages is caught iqi the cords of the great entrancehall the spider arrives hurriedly snatches the giddypate and disjoints his shanks which she empties of their contents the best part of the insect the remainder of the carcass is afterwards drained more or less ac cording to her appetite at the time the meal is taken outside the guardroom on the threshold never indoors these are not capricious mouthfuls serv ing to beguile the boredom of the watch for a brief while they are substantial repasts which require several sittings such an ap petite astonishes me after i have seen the crab spider that no less ardent watcher refuse the bees whom i give her and allow herself to die of inanition can this other mother have so great a need as that to eat yes certainly she has and for an imperative reason at the beginning of her work she spent a large amount of silk perhaps all that her reserves contained for the double dwelling  for herself and for her offspring  is a huge edifice exceedingly costly in materials and yet for nearly another month i see her adding layer upon layer both to the wall of the large cabin and to that of the central chamber so much so that the texture which at first was translucent gauze becomes opaque satin the walls never seem thick enough the spider is always working at them to satisfy this lavish expenditure she must inces santly by means of feeding fill her silkglands as and when she empties them by spinning food is the means whereby she keeps the inex haustible factory going a month passes and about the middle of september the little ones hatch but without leaving their tabernacle where they are to spend the winter packed in soft wadding the mother continues to watch and spin lessening her activity from day to day she recruits herself with a locust at longer inter vals she sometimes scorns those whom i my self entangle in her trap this increasing abstemiousness a sign of decrepitude slackens and at last stops the work of the spinnerets for four or five weeks longer the mother never ceases her leisurely inspectionrounds happy at hearing the newbom spiders swarm ing in the wallet at length when october ends she clutches her offsprings nursery and dies withered she has done all that maternal devotion can do the special providence of tiny animals will do the rest when spring comes the youngsters will emerge from their snug habitation disperse all over the neigh hood by the expedient of the floating thread and weave their first attempts at a labyrinth on the tufts of thyme accurate in structure and neat in silkwork though they be the nests of the caged captives do not tell us everything we must go back to what happens in the fields with their com plicated conditions towards the end of december i again set out in search aided by all my youthful collaborators we inspect the stunted rosemaries along the edge of a path sheltered by a rocky wooded slope we lift the branches that spread over the ground our zeal is rewarded with success in a couple of hours i am the owner of some nests pitiful pieces of work are they injured beyond recognition by the assaults of the weather it needs the eyes of faith to see in these ruins the equivalent of the edifices built inside my cages fastened to the creeping branch the unsightly bundle lies on the sand heaped up by the rains oakleaves roughly joined by a few threads wrap it all round one of these leaves larger than the others roofs it in and serves as a scaffolding for the whole of the ceiling if we did not see the silky remnants of the two vestibules project ing and feel a certain resistance when separat ing the parts of the bundle we might take the thing for a casual accumulation the work of the rain and the wind let us examine our find and look more closely into its shapelessness here is the large room the maternal cabin which rips as the coating of leaves is removed here are the circular galleries of the guardroom here are the central chamber and its pillars all in a fabric of immaculate white the dirt from the damp ground has not penetrated to this dwelling protected by its wrapper of dead leaves now open the habitation of the offspring what is this to my utter astonishment the contents of the chamber are a kernel of earthy matters as though the muddy rainwater had been allowed to soak through put aside that idea says the satin wall which itself is per fectly clean inside it is most certainly the mothers doing a deliberate piece of work executed with minute care the grains of sand are stuck together with a cement of silk and the whole resists the pressure of the fingers if we continue to unshell the kernel we find below this mineral layer a last silken tunic that forms a globe around the brood no sooner do we tear this final covering than the frightened little ones run away and scatter with an agility that is singular at this cold and torpid season to sum up when working in the natural state the labyrinth spider builds around the eggs between two sheets of satin a wall com posed of a great deal of sand and a little silk to stop the ichneumons probe and the teeth of the other ravages the best thing that oc curred to her was this hoarding which combines the hardness of flint with the softness of muslin this means of defence seems to be pretty frequent among spiders our own big house spider tegenaria domestica encloses her eggs in a globule strengthened with a rind of silk and of crumbly wreckage from the mortar of the walls other species living in the open under stones work in the same way they wrap their eggs in a mineral shell held together with silk the same fears have in spired the same protective methods then how comes it that of the five mothers reared in my cages not one has had recourse to the clay rampart after all sand abounded the pans in which the wiregauze covers stood were full of it on the other hand under normal conditions i have often come across nests without any mineral casing these incomplete nests were placed at some height from the ground in the thick of the brushwood the others on the contrary those supplied with a coating of sand lay on the ground the method of the work explains these differences the concrete of our buildings is obtained by the simultaneous manipulation of gravel and mortar in the same way the spider mixes the cement of the silk with the grains of sand the spinnerets never cease working while the legs fling under the ad hesive spray the solid materials collected in the immediate neighbourhood the opera tion would be impossible if after cementing each grain of sand it were necessary to stop the work of the spinnerets and go to a distance to fetch further stony elements those materials have to be right under her legs otherwise the spider does without and con tinues her work just the same in my cages the sand is too far off to obtain it the spider would have to leave the top of the dome where the nest is being built on its trelliswork support she would have to come down some nine inches the worker refuses to take this trouble which if repeated in the case of each grain would make the action of the spinnerets too irksome she also refuses to do so when for reasons which i have not fathomed the site chosen is some way up in the tuft of rosemary but when the nest touches the ground the clay rampart is never missing are we to see in this fact proof of an in stinct capable of modification either making for decadence and gradually neglecting what was the ancestors safeguard or making for progress and advancing hesitatingly towards perfection in the masons art no inference is permissible in either direction the laby rinth spider has simply taught us that instinct possesses resources which are employed or left latent according to the conditions of the mo ment place sand under her legs and the spinstress will knead concrete refuse her that sand or put it out of her reach and the spider will remain a simple silkworker al ways ready however to turn mason under favourable conditions the aggregate of things that come within the observers scope proves that it were mad to expect from her any further innovations such as would utterly change her methods of manufacture and cause her for instance to abandon her cabin with its two entrancehalls and its starlike taber nacle in favour of the banded epeiras pearshaped gourd che is named durands clotho clotho durandi latr in memory of him who first called attention to this particular spider to enter on eternity under the safe conduct of a diminutive animal which saves us from speedy oblivion under the mallows and rockets is no contemptible advantage most men disappear without leaving an echo to repeat their name they lie buried in forgct fulness the worst of graves others among the naturalists benefit by the designation given to this or that object in lifes treasurehouse it is the skiff wherein they keep afloat for a brief while a patch of lichen on the bark of an old tree a blade of grass a puny beastie any one of these hands down a mans name to posterity as effectively as a new comet for all its abuses this manner of honouring the departed is emi nently respectable if we would carve an epitaph of some duration what could we find better than a beetles wingcase a snaifs shell or a spiders web granite is worth none of them entrusted to the hard stone an inscrip tion becomes obliterated entrusted to a butterflys wing it is indestructible du rand therefore by all means but why drag in clotho is it the whim of a nomenclator at a loss for words to denote the everswelling tide of beasts that require cataloguing not entirely a mythological name came to his mind one which sounded well and which moreover was not out of place in designating a spinstress the clotho of antiquity is the youngest of the three fates she holds the distaff whence our destinies are spun a distaff wound with plenty of rough flocks just a few shreds of silk and very rarely a thin strand of gold prettily shaped and clad as far as a spider can be the clotho of the naturalists is above all a highly talented spinstress and this is the reason why she is called after the distaff bearing deity of the infernal regions it is a pity that the analogy extends no further the mythological clotho niggardly with her silk and lavish with her coarse flocks spins us a harsh existence the eightlegged clotho iises naught but exquisite silk she works for herself the other works for us who are hardly worth the trouble would we make her acquaintance on the rocky slopes in the oliveland scorched and blistered by the sun turn over the flat stones those of a fair size search above all the piles which the shepherds set up for a seat whence to watch the sheep browsing amongst the lavender below do not be too easily dis heartened the clotho is rare not every spot suits her if fortune smile at last upon our perseverance we shall see clinging to the lower surface of the stone which we have lifted an edifice of a weatherbeaten aspect shaped like an overturned cupola and about the size of half a tangerine orange the out side is encrusted or hung with small shells particles of earth and especially dried insects the edge of the cupola is scalloped into a dozen angular lobes the points of which spread and are fixed to the stone in between these straps is the same number of spacious inverted arches the whole represents the ishmaelites camelhair tent but upside down a flat roof stretched between the straps closes the top of the dwelling then where is the entrance all the arches of the edge open upon the roof not one leads to the interior the eye seeks in vain there is naught to point to a passage between the inside and the outside yet the owner of the house must go out from time to time were it only in search of food on return ing from her expedition she must go in again how does she make her exits and her en trances a straw will tell us the secret pass it over the threshold of the various arches everywhere the searching straw en counters resistance everywhere it finds the place rigorously closed but one of the scallops differing in no wise from the others in appearance if cleverly coaxed opens at the edge into two lips and stands slightly ajar this is the door which at once shuts again of its own elasticity nor is this all the spider when she returns home often bolts herself in that is to say she joins and fastens the two leaves of the door with a little silk the mason mygale is no safer in her burrow with its lid undistinguishable from the soil and moving on a hinge than is the clotho in her tent which is inviolable by any enemy ignorant of the device the clotho fy when in danger runs quickly home she opens the chink with a touch of her claw enters and disappears the door closes of itself and is supplied in case of need with a lock consist ing of a few threads no burglar led astray by the multiplicity of arches one and all alike will ever discover how the fugitive vanished so suddenly while the clotho displays a more simple ingenuity as regards her defensive machinery she is incomparably ahead of the mygale in the matter of domestic comfort let us open her cabin what luxury we are taught how a sybarite of old was unable to rest owing to the presence of a crumpled roseleaf in his bed the clotho is quite as fastidious her couch is more delicate than swansdown and whiter than the fleece of the clouds where brood the summer storms it is the ideal blanket above is a canopy or tester of equal softness between the two nestles the spider shortlegged clad in sombre garments with five yellow favours on her back rest in this exquisite retreat demands perfect stability especially on gusty days when sharp draughts penetrate beneath the stone this condition is admirably fulfilled take a careful look at the habitation the arches that gird the roof with a balustrade and bear the weight of the edifice are fixed to the slab by their extremities moreover from each point of contact there issues a cluster of diverging threads that creep along the stone and cling to it throughout their length which spreads afar i have measured some that were fully nine inches long these are so many cables they represent the ropes and pegs that hold the arabs tent in position with such supports as these so numerous and so methodically arranged the hammock cannot be torn from its bearings save by the intervention of brutal methods with whidi the spider need not concern herself so seldom do they occur another detail attracts our attention whereas the interior of the house is exquisitely clean the outside is covered with dirt bits of earth chips of rotten wood little pieces of gravel often there are worse things still the exterior of the tent becomes a charnel house here hung up or embedded are the dry carcasses of opatra asidae and other tenebrionidae that favour underrock shelters one of the largest families of beetles darkish in colour and shunning the lighttranslators note segments of luli bleached by the sun shells of pupae common among the stones and lastly snailshells selected from among the smallest these relics are obviously for the most part tableleavings broken victuals un versed in the trappers art the clotho courses her game and lives upon the vagrants who wander from one stone to another whoso ventures under the slab at night is strangled by the hostess and the driedup carcass instead of being flung to a distance is hung to the silken wall as though the spider wished to make a bogeyhouse of her home but this cannot be her aim to act like the ogre who hangs his victims from the castle battlements is the worst way to disarm suspicion in the passersby whom you are lying in wait to capture there are other reasons which increase our doubts the shells hung up are most often empty but there are also some occupied by the snail alive and untouched what can the clotho do with a pupa cinerea a pupa quad the lulus is one of the family of myriapods which includes centipedes etc  translators note  a species of landsnail  translators note ridens and other narrow spirals wherein the animal retreats to an inaccessible depth the spider is incapable of breaking the calcareous shell or of getting at the hermit through the opening then why should she collect those prizes whose slimy flesh is probably not to her taste we begin to suspect a simple question of ballast and balance the house spider prevents her web spun in a comer of the wall from losing its shape at the least breath of air by loading it with crumbling plaster and allowing tiny fragments of mortar to accumu late are we face to face with a similar process let us try experiment which is preferable to any amount of conjecture to rear the clotho is not an arduous under taking we are not obliged to take the heavy flagstone on which the dwelling is built away with us a very simple operation sufiices i loosen the fastenings with my pocketknife the spider has such stayathome ways that she very rarely makes off besides i use the utmost discretion in my rape of the house and so i carry away the building together with its owner in a paper bag the flat stones which are too heavy to move and which would occupy too much room upon my table are replaced either by deal disks which once formed part of cheese boxes or by round pieces of cardboard i ar range each silken hanunock under one of these by itself fastening the angular projections one by one with strips of gummed paper the whole stands on three short pillars and gives a very fair imitation of the underrock shelter in the form of a small dolmen throughout this operation if you are careful to avoid shocks and jolts the spider remains indoors finally each apparatus is placed under a wire gauze bellshaped cage which stands in a dish filled with sand we can have an answer by the next morn ing if among the cabins swung from the ceilings of the deal or cardboard dolmens there be one that is all dilapidated that was seriously knocked out of shape at the time of removal the spider abandons it during the night and instals herself elsewhere sometimes even on the trelliswork of the wire cage the new tent the work of a few hours attains hardly the diameter of a twofranc piece it is built however on the same prin ciples as the old manorhouse and consists of two thin sheets laid one above the other the upper one flat and forming a tester the lower curved and pocketshaped the texture is extremely delicate the least trifle would deform it to the detriment of the available space which is already much reduced and only just sufficient for the recluse well what has the spider done to keep the gossamer stretched to steady it and to make it retain its greatest capacity exactly what our static treatises would advise her to do she has ballasted her structure she has done her best to lower its centre of gravity from the convex surface of the pocket hang long chaplets of grains of sand strung together with slender silken cords to these sandy stalactites which form a bushy beard are added a few heavy lumps hung separately and lower down at the end of a thread the whole is a piece of ballastwork an apparatus for ensuring equilibrium and tension the present edifice hastily constructed in the space of a night is the frail rough sketch of what the home will afterwards become successive layers will be added to it and the partitionwall will grow into a thick blanket capable of partly retaining by its own weight the requisite curve and capacity the spider now abandons the stalactites of sand which were used to keep the original pocket stretched and confines herself to dumping down on her abode any more or less heavy object mainly corpses of insects because she need not look for these and finds them ready to hand after each meal they are weights not trophies they take the place of materials that must otherwise be collected from a dis tance and hoisted to the top in this way a breastwork is obtained that strengthens and steadies the house additional equilibrium is often supplied by tiny shells and other objects hanging a long way down what would happen if one robbed an old dwelling long since completed of its outer covering in case of such a disaster would the spider go back to the sandy stalactites as a ready means of restoring stability this is easily ascertained in my hamlets under wire i select a fairs cabin i strip the exterior carefully removing any foreign body the silk reappears in its original whiteness the tent looks magnificent but seems to me too limp this is also the spiders opinion she sets to work next evening to put things right and how once more with hanging strings of sand in a few nights the silk bag bristles with a long thick beard of stalactites a curious piece of work excellently adapted to maintain the web in an unvaried curve even so are the cables of a suspensionbridge steadied by the weight of the superstructure later as the spider goes on feeding the remains of the victuals are embedded in the wall the sand is shaken and gradually drops away and the home resumes its charnelhouse appearance this brings us to the same con clusion as before the clotho knows her statics by means of additional weights she is able to lower the centre of gravity and thus to give her dwelling the proper equilibrium and capacity now what does she do in her softlywadded home nothing that i know of with a full stomach her legs luxuriously stretched over the downy carpet she does nothing thinks of nothing she listens to the sound of earth revolving on its axis it is not sleep still less is it waking it is a middle state where naught prevails save a dreamy consciousness of wellbeing we ourselves when comfort ably in bed enjoy just before we fall asleep a few moments of bliss the prelude to cessa tion of thought and its train of worries and those moments are among the sweetest in our lives the clotho seems to know similar moments and to make the most of them if i push open the door of the cabin in variably i find the spider lying motionless as though in endless meditation it needs the teasing of a straw to rouse her from her apathy it needs the prick of hunger to bring her out of doors and as she is extremely temperate her appearances outside are few and far between during three years of assiduous observation in the privacy of my study i have not once seen her explore the domain of the wire cage by day not until a late hour at night does she venture forth in quest of victuals and it is hardly feasible to follow her on her excursions patience once enabled me to find her at ten oclock in the evening taking the air on the flat roof of her house where she was doubt less waiting for the game to pass startled by the light of my candle the lover of dark ness at once returned indoors refusing to reveal any of her secrets only next day there was one more corpse hanging from the wall ojf the cabin a proof that the chase was successfully resumed after my depar ture the clotho who is not only nocturnal but also excessively shy conceals her habits from us she shows us her works those precious historical documents but hides her actions especially the laying which i estimate ap proximately to take place in october the sum total of the eggs is divided into five or six small flat lentiform pockets which taken together occupy the greater part of the maternal home these capsules have each their own partitionwall of superb white satin but they are so closely soldered both to gether and to the floor of the house that it is impossible to part them without tearing them impossible therefore to obtain them sep arately the eggs in all amount to about a hundred the mother sits upon the heap of pockets with the same devotion as a brooding hen maternity has not withered her although decreased in bulk she retains an excellent look of health her round belly and her well stretched skin tell us from the first that her part is not yet wholly played the hatching takes place early november has not arrived before the pockets contain the young wee things clad in black with five yellow specks exactly like their elders the newborn do not leave their respective nur series packed close together they spend the whole of the wintry season there while the mother squatting on the pile of cells watches over the general safety without knowing her family other than by the gentle trepidations felt through the partitions of the tiny cham bers the labyrinth spider has shown us how she maintains a permanent sitting for two months in her guardroom to defend in case of need the brood which she will never see the clotho does the same during eight months thus earning the right to set eyes for a little while on her family trotting around her in the main cabin and to assist at the final exodus the great journey undertaken at the end of a thread when the summer heat arrives in june the young ones probably aided by their mother pierce the walls of their cells leave the maternal tent of which they know the secret outlet well take the air on the threshold for a few hours and then fly away carried to some distance by a funicular aeroplane the first product of their spinningmill the elder clotho remains behind careless of this emigration which leaves her alone she is far from being faded indeed she looks younger than ever her fresh colour her robust appearance suggest great length of life capable of producing a second family on this subject i have but one document a pretty farreaching one however there were a few mothers whose actions i had the patience to watch despite the wearisome minutiae of the rearing and the slowness of the result these abandoned their dwellings after the departure of their young and each went to weave a new one for herself on the wire net work of the cage they were roughandready summaries the work of a night two hangings one above the other the upper one flat the lower con cave and ballasted with stalactites of grains of sand formed the new home which strengthened daily by fresh layers promised to become similar to the old one why does the spider desert her former mansion which is in no way dilapidated  far from it  and still exceedingly serviceable as far as one can judge unless i am mistaken i think i have an inkling of the reason the old cabin comfortably wadded though it be possesses serious disadvantages it is littered with the ruins of the childrens nurseries these ruins are so closewelded to the rest of the home that my forceps cannot extract them without difficulty and to remove them would be an exhausting business for the clotho and possibly beyond her strength it is a case of the resistance of gordian knots which not even the very spinstress who fastened them is capable of untying the encumbering litter therefore will remain if the spider were to stay alone the re duction of space when all is said would hardly matter to her she wants so little room merely enough to move inl besides when you have spent seven or eight months in the cramping presence of those bedchambers what can be the reason of a sudden need for greater space i see but one the spider re quires a roomy habitation not for herself  she is satisfied with the smallest den  but for a second family where is she to place the pockets of eggs if the ruins of the previous laying remain in the way a new brood requires a new home that no doubt is why feeling that her ovaries are not yet dried up the spider shifts her quarters and founds a new establishment the facts observed ar confined to this change of dwelling i regret that other in terests and the difficulties attendant upon a long upbringing did not allow me to pursue the question and definitely to settle the matter of the repeated layings and the longevity of the clotho as i did in that of the lycosa before taking leave of this spider let us glance at a curious problem which has already been set by the lycosas offspring when carried for seven months on the mothers back they keep in training as agile gymnasts with out taking any nourishment it is familiar exercise for them after a fall which fre quently occurs to scramble up a leg of their mount and nimbly to resume their place in the saddle they expend energy without receiv ing any material sustenance the sons of the clotho the labyrinth spider and many others confront us with the same riddle they move yet do not eat at any period of the nursery stage even in the heart of winter on the bleak days of january i tear the pockets of the one and the taber nacle of the other expecting to find the swarm of youngsters lying in a state of complete inertia numbed by the cold and by lack of food well the result is quite different the instant their cells are broken open the anchorites run out and flee in every direction as nimbly as at the best moments of their normal liberty it is marvellous to see them scampering about no brood of partridges stumbled upon by a dog scatters more promptly chicks while still no more than tiny balls of yellow fluff hasten up at the mothers call and scurry towards the plate of rice habit has made us indifferent to the spectacle of those pretty little animal machines which work so nimbly and with such precision we pay no attention so simple does it all appear to us science examines and looks at things differently she says to herself nothing is made with nothing the chick feeds itself it consumes or rather it assimi lates and turns the food into heat which is converted into energy were any one to tell us of a chick which for seven or eight months on end kept itself in condition for running always fit always brisk without taking the least beakful of nourishment from the day when it left the cgg» we could find no words strong enough to express our incredulity now this paradox of activity maintained without the stay of food is real by the clotho spider and others i believe i have made it sufficiently clear that the young lycosae take no food as long as they remain with their mother strictly speaking doubt is just admissible for observa tion is needs dumb as to what may happen earlier or later within the mysteries of the burrow it seems possible that the repleted mother may there disgorge to her family a mite of the contents of her crop to this suggestion the clotho undertakes to make reply like the lycosa she lives with her family but the clotho is separated from them by the walls of the cells in which the little ones are hermetically enclosed in this condition the transmission of solid nourishment be comes impossible should any one entertain a theory of nutritive humours cast up by the mother and filtering through the partitions at which the prisoners might come and drink the labyrinth spider would at once dispel the idea she dies a few weeks after her young are hatched and the children still locked in their satin bedchamber for the best part of the year are none the less active can it be that they derive sustenance from the silken wrapper do they eat their house the supposition is not absurd for we have seen the epeirae before beginning a new web swallow the ruins of the old but the explanation cannot be accepted as we learn from the lycosa whose family boasts no silky screen in short it is certain that the young of whatever species take absolutely no nourishment lastly we wonder whether they may possess within themselves reserves that come from the egg fatty or other matters the gradual combustion of which would be trans formed into mechanical force if the ex penditure of energy were of but short dura tion a few hours or a few days we could gladly welcome this idea of a motor viaticum the attribute of every creature bom into the world the chick possesses it in a high degree it is steady on its legs it moves for a little while with the sole aid of the food wherewith the egg furnishes it but soon if the stomach is not kept supplied the centre of energy becomes extinct and the bird dies how would the chick fare if it were expected for seven or eight months without stopping to stand on its feet to run about to flee in the face of danger where would it stow the necessary reserves for such an amount of work the little spider in her turn is a minute particle of no size at all where could she store enough fuel to keep up mobility dur ing so long a period the imagination shrinks in dismay before the thought of an atom endowed with exhaustible motive oils we must needs therefore appeal to the immaterial in particular to heatrays coming from the outside and converted into move ment by the organism this is nutrition of energy reduced to its simplest expression the motive heat instead of being extracted from the food is util direct as supplied by the sun which is the seat of all life inert matter has disconcerting secrets as witness radium living matter has secrets of its own which are more wonderful still nothing tells us that science will not one day turn the suspicion sug gested by the spider into an established truth and a fundamental theory of physiology t find myself confronted with a subject which is not only highly interesting but somewhat difficult not that the subject is obscure but it presupposes in the reader a certain knowledge of geometry a strong meat too often neglected i am not ad dressing geometricians who are generally indifferent to questions of instinct nor entomo logical collectors who as such take no interest in mathematical theorems i write for any one with sufficient intelligence to enjoy the lessons which the insect teaches what am i to do to suppress this chapter were to leave out the most remarkable instance of spider industry to treat it as it should be treated that is to say with the whole armoury of scientific formulae would be out of place in these modest pages let us take a middle course avoiding both abstruse truths and complete ignorance let us direct our attention to the nets of the epeirae preferably to those of the silky epeira and the banded epeira so plentiful in the autumn in my part of the country and so remarkable for their bulk we shall first observe that the radii are equally spaced the angles formed by each consecutive pair are of perceptibly equal value and this in spite of their number which in the case of the silky epeira exceeds two score we know by what strange means the spider attains her ends and divides the area wherein the web is to be warped into a large number of equal sectors a number which is almost invariable in the work of each species an operation without method governed one might imagine by an irresponsible whim results in a beautiful rose window worthy of our compasses we shall also notice that in each sector the various chords the elements of the spiral windings are parallel to one another and gradually draw closer together as they near the centre with the two radiating lines that frame them they form obtuse angles on one side and acute angles on the other and these angles remain constant in the same sector because the chords are parallel there is more than this these same angles the obtuse as well as the acute do not alter in value from one sector to another at any rate so far as the conscientious eye can judge taken as a whole therefore the ropelatticed edifice consists of a series of crossbars inter secting the several radiating lines obliquely at angles of equal value by this characteristic we recognize the logarithmic spiral geometricians give this name to the curve which intersects obliquely at angles of unvarying value all the straight lines or radii vectores radiating from a centre called the pole the epeiras con struction therefore is a series of chords join ing the intersections of a logarithmic spiral with a series of radii it would become merged in this spiral if the number of radii were infinite for this would reduce the length of the rectilinear elements indefinitely and change this polygonal line into a curve to suggest an explanation why this spiral has so greatly exercised the meditations of science let us confine ourselves for the present to a few statements of which the reader will find the proof in any treatise on higher geometry the logarithmic spiral describes an endless number of circuits around its pole to which it constantly draws nearer without ever being able to reach it this central point is inde finitely inaccessible at each approaching turn it is obvious that this property is beyond our sensory scope even with the help of the best philosophical instruments our sight could not follow its interminable windings and would soon abandon the attempt to divide the in visible it is a volute to which the brain con ceives no limits the trained mind alone more discerning than our retina sees clearly that which defies the perceptive faculties of the eye the epeira complies to the best of her ability with this law of the endless volute the spiral revolutions come closer together as they approach the pole at a given distance they stop abruptly but at this point the auxiliary spiral which is not destroyed in the central region takes up the thread and we see it not without some surprise draw nearer to the pole in evernarrowing and scarcely perceptible circles there is not of course absolute mathematical accuracy but a very close approximation to that accuracy the epeira winds nearer and nearer round her pole so far as her equipment which like our own is defective will allow her one would believe her to be thoroughly versed in the laws of the spiral i will continue to set forth without ex planations some of the properties of this curious curve picture a flexible thread wound round a logarithmic spiral if we then un wind it keeping it taut the while its free extremity will describe a spiral similar at all points to the original the curve will merely have changed places jacques bernouilli to whom geometry owes this magnificent theorem had engraved on his tomb as one of his proudest titles to fame the generating spiral and its double begotten of the unwinding of the thread an inscription proclaimed eadem mutata resurgo i rise again like unto myself geometry would find it difficult to better this splendid flight of fancy towards the great problem of the hereafter there is another geometrical epitaph no less famous cicero when quaestor in sicily jacques bernouilli professor of mathe matics at the university of basel from to the year of his death he improved the differential calculus solved the isopcrimetrical problem and discovered the properties of the logarithmic spiral  translators note searching for the tomb of archimedes amid the thorns and brambles that cover us with oblivion recogn it among the ruins by the geometrical figure engraved upon the stone the cylinder circumscribing the sphere archimedes in fact was the first to know the approximate relation of circumference to diameter from it he deduced the perimeter and surface of the circle as well as the surface and volume of the sphere he showed that the surface and volume of the lastnamed equal twothirds of the surface and volume of the circumscribing cylinder disdaining all pompous inscription the learned syracusan honoured himself with his theorem as his sole epitaph the geometrical figure proclaimed the individuals name as plainly as would any alphabetical characters to have done with this part of our subject here is another property of the logarithmic spiral roll the curve along an indefinite straight line its pole will become displaced while still keeping on one straight line the endless scroll leads to rectilinear progression the perpetually varied begets uniformity now is this logarithmic spiral with its curious properties merely a conception of the geometers combining number and extent at will so as to imagine a tenebrous abyss where in to practise their analytical methods after wards is it a mere dream in the night of the intricate an abstract riddle flung out for our understanding to browse upon no it is a reality in the service of life a method of construction frequently employed in animal architecture the mollusc in particular never rolls the winding ramp of the shell without reference to the scientific curve the firstborn of the species knew it and put it into practice it was as perfect in the dawn of creation as it can be today let us study in this connection the am monites those venerable relics of what was once the highest expression of living things at the time when the solid land was taking shape from the oceanic ooze cut and polished lengthwise the fossil shows a magnificent logarithmic spiral the general pattern of the dwelling which was a pearl palace with nu merous chambers traversed by a siphuncular corridor to this day the last representative of the cephalopoda with partitioned shells the nautilus of the southern seas remains faith ful to the ancient design it has not improved upon its distant predecessors it has altered the position of the siphuncle has placed it in the centre instead of leaving it on the back but it still whirls its spiral logarithmically as did the ammonites in the earliest ages of the worlds existence and let us not run away with the idea that these princes of the mollusc tribe have a monopoly of the scientific curve in the stagnant waters of our grassy ditches the flat shells the humble planorbes sometimes no bigger than a duckweed vie with the ammo nite and the nautilus in matters of higher geometry at least one of them planorbis vortex for example is a marvel of logarith mic whorls in the longshaped shells the structure becomes more complex though remaining subject to the same fundamental laws i have before my eyes some species of the genus terebra from new caledonia they are ex tremely tapering cones attaining almost nine inches in length their surface is smooth and quite plain without any of the usual orna ments such as furrows knots or strings of pearls the spiral edifice is superb graced po with its own simplicity alone i count a score of whorls which gradually decrease until they vanish in the delicate point they are edged with a fine groove i take a pencil and draw a rough generat ing line to this cone and relying merely on the evidence of my eyes which are more or less practised in geometric measurements i find that the spiral groove intersects this gen erating line at an angle of unvarying value the consequence of this result is easily deduced if projected on a plane perpendic ular to the axis of the shell the generating lines of the cone would become radii and the groove which winds upwards from the base to the apex would be converted into a plane curve which meeting those radii at an unvary ing angle would be neither more nor less than a logarithmic spiral conversely the groove of the shell may be considered as the projec tion of this spiral on a conic surface better still let us imagine a plane per pendicular to the axis of the shell and passing through its summit let us imagine more over a thread wound along the spiral groove let us unroll the thread holding it taut as we do so its extremity will not leave the plane and will describe a logarithmic spiral within it it rs in a more complicated degree a variant of bemouillis eadem mutata resurge the logarithmic conic curve becomes a logarithmic plane curve a similar geometry is found in the other shells with elongated cones turritellae spindleshells cerithia as well as in the shells with flattened cones trochidae turbines the spherical shells those whirled into a volute are no exception to this rule all down to the common snailshell are con structed according to logarithmic laws the famous spiral of the geometers is the general plan followed by the mollusc rolling its stone sheath where do these glairy creatures pick up this science we are told that the mollusc derives from the worm one day the worm rendered frisky by the sun emanci pated itself brandished its tail and twisted it into a corkscrew for sheer glee there and then the plan of the future spiral shell was discovered this is what is taught quite seriously in these days as the very last word in scientific progress it remains to be seen up to what point the explanation is acceptable the spider for her part will have none of it un related to the appendixlacking corkscrew twirling worm she is nevertheless familiar with the logarithmic spiral from the cele brated curve she obtains merely a sort of framework but elementary though this framework be it clearly hiarks the ideal edifice the epeira works on the same prin ciples as the mollusc of the convoluted shell the mollusc has years wherein to construct its spiral and it uses the utmost finish in the whirling process the epeira to spread her net has but an hours sitting at the most wherefore the speed at which she works com pels her to rest content with a simpler pro duction she shortens the task by confining herself to a skeleton of the curve which the other describes to perfection the epeira therefore is versed in the geo metric secrets of the ammonite and the nautilus pompilus she uses in a simpler form the logarithmic line dear to the snail what guides her there is no appeal here to a wriggle of some kind as in the case of the worm that ambitiously aspires to become a mollusc the animal must needs carry within itself a virtual diagram of its spiral acci dent however fruitful in surprises we may presume it to be can never have taught it the higher geometry wherein our own intelligence at once goes astray without a strict prelimi nary training are we to recognize a mere effect of organic structure in the epeiras art we readily think of the legs which endowed with a very varying power of extension might serve as compasses more or less bent more or less outstretched they would mechanically determine the angle whereat the spiral shall intersect the radius they would maintain the parallel of the chords in each sector certain objections arise to affirm that in this instance the tool is not the sole regulator of the work were the arrangment of the thread determined by the length of the legs we should find the spiral volutes separated more widely from one another in proportion to the greater length of implement in the spinstress we see this in the banded epeira and the silky epeira the first has longer limbs and spaces her crossthreads more liberally than does the second whose legs are shorter but we must not rely too much on this rule say others the angular epeira the pale tinted epeira and the diadem epeira or cross spider all three more or less short limbed rival the banded epeira in the spac ing of their limesnares the last two even dispose them with greater intervening distances we recognize in another respect that the organization of the animal does not imply an immutable type of work before beginning the sticky spiral the epeirae first spin an auxiliary intended to strengthen the stays this spiral formed of plain nonglutinous thread starts from the centre and winds in rapidlywidening circles to the circumference it is merely a temporary construction where of naught but thet central part survives when the spider has set its limy meshes the second spiral the essential part of the snare proceeds on the contrary in serried coils from the circumference to the centre and is com posed entirely of viscous crossthreads here we have following one upon the other by a sudden alteration of the machine two volutes of an entirely different order as regards direction the number of whorls and the angle of intersection both of them are logarithmic spirals i see no mechanism of the legs be they long or short that can ac count for this alteration can it then be a premeditated design on the part of the epeira can there be calcula tion measurement of angles gauging of the parallel by means of the eye or otherwise i am inclined to think that there is none of all this or at least nothing but an innate pro pensity whose effects the animal is no more able to control than the flower is able to con trol the arrangement of its verticils the epeira practises higher geometry without knowing or caring the thing works of itself and takes its impetus from an instinct im posed upon creation from the start the stone thrown by the hand returns to earth describing a certain curve the dead leaf torn and wafted away by a breath of wind makes its journey from the tree to the ground with a similar curve on neither the one side nor the other is there any action by the mov ing body to regulate the fall nevertheless the descent takes place according to a scientific trajectory the parabola of which the section of a cone by a plane furnished the prototype to the geometers speculations a figure which was at first but a tentative glimpse be comes a reality by the fall of a pebble out of the vertical the same speculations take up the para bola once more imagine it rolling on an indefinite straight line and ask what course does the focus of this curve follow the answer comes the focus of the parabola de scribes a catenary a line very simple in shape but endowed with an algebraic symbol that has to resort to a kind of cabalistic num ber at variance with any sort of numeration much so that the unit refuses to express it however much we subdivide the unit it is called the number e its value is repre sented by the following series carried out ad infinitum ir i ii  if the reader had the patience to work out the few initial terms of this series which has no limit because the series of natural numerals itself has none he would find with this weird number are we now sta tioned within the strictly defined realm of the imagination not at all the catenary ap pears actually every time that weight and flexibility act in concert the name is given to the curve formed by a chain suspended by two of its points which are not placed on a vertical line it is the shape taken by a flex ible cord when held at each end and relaxed it is the line that governs the shape of a sail bellying in the wind it is the curve of the nannygoats milkbag when she returns from filling her trailing udder and all this answers to the number e what a quantity of abstruse science for a bit of string i let us not be surprised a pellet of shot swinging at the end of a thread a drop of dew trickling down a straw a splash of water rippling under the kisses of the air a mere trifle after all requires a titanic scaffolding when we wish to examine it with the eye of calculation we need the club of hercules to crush a fly our methods of mathematical investigation are certainly ingenious we cannot too much admire the mighty brains that have invented them but how slow and laborious they appear when compared with the smallest actualities will it never be given to us to probe reality in a simpler fashion will our intelligence be able one day to dispense with the heavy arsenal of formulae why not here we have the abracadabric number e reappearing inscribed on a spiders thread let us examine on a misty morning the mesh work that has been constructed during the night owing to their hygrometrical nature the sticky threads are laden with tiny drops and bending under the burden have become so many catenaries so many chaplets of limpid gems graceful chaplets arranged in exquisite order and following the curve of a swing if the sun pierce the mist the whole lights up with iridescent fires and becomes a resplendent cluster of diamonds the number e is in its glory geometry that is to say the science of harmony in space presides over everything we find it in the arrangement of the scales of a fircone as in the arrangement of an epeiras limesnare we find it in the spiral of a snail shell in the chaplet of a spiders thread as in the orbit of a planet it is everywhere as perfect in the world of atoms as in the world of immensities and this universal geometry tells us of an universal gcometrican whose divine compass has measured all things i prefer that as an explanation of the logarithmic curve of the ammonite and the epeira to the worm screwing up the tip of its tail
