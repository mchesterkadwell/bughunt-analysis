CHAPTER I  THE NEST  To look at a housefly as it performs its figureof  eight dances in the air of our rooms or as it buzzes  against the windowpane vainly endeavouring to  dash its tender body through the firm and clear  glassy wallto mark how soon it comes into  existence and how soon its little day of life is  goneone would say it is a foolish and trifling  thing to write the history of an insects life but  any one who would thus speak must be ignorant  of that which he declares to be folly and trifling  He cannot know the miracles of skill that insects  insignificant as they seem are capable of per¬  forming nor the astonishing lessons of wisdom  which even man may learn from these minute and  shortlived beings So long as we are ignorant of  any part of Gods creation we may very probably  think light of it but when we come to inquire into  the things we have formerly despised and will give  a patient attention to what we before thought  beneath our notice the tone of our remarks will  greatly alter Now we shall find in the meanest  things formed by the Divine hand inexhaustible  themes for wonder and praise and innumerable  proofs that the great Almighty power which built  our round world and countless worlds besides  which fixed them with a firm decree in an appointed  course has not been less displayed even in the  formation of a tiny insect which is this hour alive  and the next lost to being  The telescope shows us what God has created in  the innumerable millions of stars and suns which  every clear night look down with gentle beams  upon the earth it shows us that the earth on  which we dwell compared to the worlds by which  it is surrounded is as a grain of sand to a mighty  mountain But the microscope on the contrary  shows us what is almost more wonderful even than  this for it shows us that though the High and Lofty  One who inhabits eternity has created all these vast  systems of suns and stars yet he has not thought  it beneath Him to chisel the egg of an insect or to  adorn the coat of a tiny caterpillar Well might we  pause and ask as we look now through the wonder  revealing tube of the microscope and then through  that of the telescopeWas it not a greater evidence  of power and wisdom to create clothe organize  and endow with the powers of life a little atom  which we can detect only by means of a powerful  microscope than to form even a great and mighty  world For our part then we think an insects  history as much a display of the wisdom and  infinite power of the Creator as the history of  such an enormous body as is the sun or any of  the large planets belonging to our system How¬  ever humble be the object which God has seen  fit to create let not any one think it beneath  him to examine The poet Thomson has written  some pretty lines which we shall venture to tran¬  scribe which with far greater beauty of language  than we can pretend to set before us the same  train of thought   Let no presuming impious railer tax  Creative wisdom as if aught was formed  In vain or not for admirable ends  Shall little haughty ignorance pronounce  His works unwise of which the smallest part  Exceeds the narrow vision of her mind  Animals birds reptiles fisli and plants have  had their biographers and ponderous books have  been written to give us an introduction to their  various families so also have insects although  despised by many they have been highly esteemed  by a few and if honours went by the size of books  written about them it might perhaps be shown  that the insects can boast of great and closely  printed books taken up with nothing else but an  account of them and their doings  Perhaps there is another feeling about insects  which ought to be mentioned beside the feeling of  contempt that is the feeling of aversion A great  many people ought we to write a great many  ladies and children are ready to scream and  take to their heels if they see a poor black  beetle racing in terror of his life for fear of them  and as both parties are equally frightened of one  another it becomes very difficult to manage a  reconciliation between them At the sight of  spiders some people are ready to faint away and  to see a little caterpillar creeping along with his  magnificent coat of particoloured hairs and with  that funny gait which it is quite ludicrous to behold  as he binds himself into a loop and walks after a  fashion like no other earthly being is enough to  make their hair stand on end and their flesh to creep  Sometimes insects are the innocent causes of  alarm even to nations Thus there is a peculiar  kind of moth upon the back of which there is  very distinctly marked the appearance of what is  Deathshead Moth  vulgarly called a deaths head its name being  the deathshead hawk moth represented in the  adjoining cut which was once the cause of the  greatest terror to a number of persons It was in  Bretagne that a large flight of them suddenly made  their appearance at the same time a dangerous  epidemic disease fell upon the inhabitants the  awful look of the poor insect together with its  strange supernatural noise filled the ignorant  people with alarm and the disease was considered  to be actually caused by the moths Another  insect the churchyard beetle which is of a jet  black colour is related by the great Linna3us as  producing the most alarming feelings upon the  minds of the superstitious and ignorant among the  peasantry of Sweden  The deathtick beetle has also a terrible repu¬  tation for frightening people This little creature  takes up its abode in decayed wood and thus  frequently makes the bedpost its dwellingplace  or ensconces itself in the wainscot of an old room  Now when as some entomologists tell us it wants  to give a signal to its mate the insect begins ham¬  mering with all its might at the side of the wall  or knocks upon its little floor until the noise is  heard and the mate then begins to hammer both  producing for their size a tremendous noise but  in human ears not sounding louder than the tick  of a large watch The poor invalid as he lies in  bed perhaps very nervous and unable to bear loud  conversation hears the noisy insects knocking one  to the other and immediately  his mind is filled with fears of  the most groundless kind which  the nurse if she is one of the  old school is sure to confirm by  telling him that this ticking is  the deathwatch  All this is not only very weak and foolish but  when it reaches the degree to which we have here  referred it is also very wrong As to the deaths  head hawk moth producing disease or foretelling  death and famine as it has been said to do how  weak and credulous must they be who draw such  omens from a mark on an insects head and how  dishonouring is it to the allwise providence of God  to imagine that he would suffer such a ridiculous  emblem to have any such actual signification  The little beetle which produces the ticking sounds  was caught by Dr Derham one fine sunshiny  day tapping as loudly as it could on a piece of  paper in a window he examined the little creatures  and kept them carefully and he states that during  the whole of one summer they scarcely ever ceased  tapping night and day Birds have their calls to  their companions and animals have theirs yet we  do not draw from these the wild supposition that  they foretell death or such like disasters Why  then should the lovetap of an insignificant beetle  have received such an interpretation It is hard  indeed to tell  Now all these feelings about insects contempt  abhorrence and terror arise in one common cause  and that is ignorance A very small acquaintance  with the contents of the little work upon which  we are now entering would suffice to dispel them  all It may be perhaps difficult to overcome  what is called a t natural aversion to any object  especially to an unfortunate insect but when it is  overcome and when we learn for the first time  all the extraordinary actions habits and instincts  of this portion of the great creation admiration  will take the place of contempt and even a  humble sort of affection that of the terror and  aversion produced by them before  With the readers permission then we will  proceed to take him with us as we describe the  various stages of the Life of an Insect from the  egg up to the perfect being It may be however  just necessary to premise that in so doing we shall  not give anything like the history of an individual  insect such for example as a fly or a bee but  shall describe in order some of the most interest¬  ing phenomena connected with insecthistory and  transformations generally Whither then must  we go to watch the awakening of life in the insect  We might ask the readers company to   where the pool  Stands mantled oer with green invisible  Amid the floating verdure millions stray  Here might we point to him that wondrous and  exquisite structure the lifeboat of eggs floating  securely on its silent surface or anchored perhaps  to the side of some pondplants slimy stem and  lingering here we might in a few days see the  little eggs become burst and give exit to a number  of minute creatures of great activity Some of them  would be seen twisting themselves about in a most  extraordinary manner and swimming here and  there through the still waters Or we might take  him to the depths of the forest and now under the  bark of some of the trees now upon their branches  now in little tents of leaves we could point out  many a colony of eggs only waiting for the life  giving influence of spring to burst into life and  activity  But it is better for us to proceed more sys¬  tematically and to notice shortly the interesting  facts which the science of entomology reveals to  us as to the eggcradles so to speak of insects  by which is meant the various localities selected  by them for the deposition of their eggs some of  them as we have mentioned in the water some in  the earth some upon plants and trees and some  in mansions made by the insects themselves for the  purpose of hatching their eggs  Let us come then and watch the great water  beetle at the time when the motherinsect is  about to commit her future offspring to the care  of the waters She is to be found on fine days  when the sun is going down into a bed of gold  enjoying herself and delighting in the pleasant air  of the evening as she sits upon a plant close by  the waters edge or she may even have taken up  her position on a floating leaf of the plant the clear  waters flowing gently beneath her She has been  in the water all day long and is now just emerged  On other evenings she will take wing and speed  her way whither no eye can follow but now she  has another and the most important duty of her  existence to perform and her customary evening  ramble is not permitted to interfere with its fulfil¬  ment On watching her closely we find her busy  at some selfimposed occupation what is its  nature To discover that she must be closely and  patiently watched At her tail are a couple of  spinning organs which move from right to left  and up and down with great swiftness all the  while a glutinous fluid which hardens into a  thread being discharged from each of them  With this apparatus the industrious insect is spin¬  ning a pouch not unlike the purses which were in  fashion before the long ones that ladies knit came  to be adopted This purse is three quarters of  an inch long it consists outside of a tissue like  parchment which is quite impervious to water  but is lined inside with the most beautiful light  downy material possible which is as white as  snow There is a sort of little horn to this pouch  which admits the air but the opening to which is  protected by a layer of cross threads which ex¬  cludes the wet In three hours of patient toil  12  this beautiful cradle is completed The water  beetle then safely secures it from being carried away  by the waters on which it floats so buoyantly by  fastening it by cables to the neighbouring plants  Here safely moored it rests until the eggs are  hatched soon after which the little creatures with¬  in escape into the waters out of the ark which has  during the period of their infancy safely preserved  them from every danger both of water and wind  The proceedings of the common gnat our  summer tormentor are no less interesting and  instructive Her actions have been closely watched  by the great Reaumur and are detailed by him with  very striking accuracy They require perhaps  sharper scrutiny than most of our readers are in  the habit of bestowing upon the actions of insects  but they well repay a patient and attentive ob¬  servation and subjects for the examination may  easily be found at the side of any pool in summer  The following is an outline of the difficulties the  insect has to contend with in depositing her eggs  First they must be hatched on the water but  2d her eggs are heavier than water and will  therefore sink if dropped into it one by one and  3d the eggs are so small and of so peculiar a shape  that it would be difficult to make them stand up¬  right on a solid surface far more so then on the  water A human shipbuilder would be probably  sorely puzzled to find out how to overcome these  difficulties and of such materials how to construct  a floating raft nay a raft which cannot by any  means be made to sink The insect has however  been instructed by a Greater and Wiser than man  and she solves the problem in a manner well calcu¬  lated to excite our admiration and praise Fixing  herself by her four front legs upon a leaf or twig  floating on the surface of the water she stretches  out behind her the two hind leos and crosses them  over one another somewhat in this manner Y In  the triangular space thus formed she purposes to  construct her boat of eggs Now all things being  ready just where the crossed legs meet she places  her first egg which is covered over with a thick  glue By the side of this she places another and  again another so that the three are by means of  the glue which covers them united together and  will consequently preserve the upright position  as there is now a sufficiently broad base of support  for them to rest upon To these she diligently  adds egg to egg until she has sufficiently formed  the shape of her boat after which she uncrosses  her legs and places them quite straight so as to  shape the sides of the boat When a sufficient  number of eggs have been thus glued together  the number varying from two to three hundred  the gnat considers her task as ended and wings  her way from the pool abandoning her ingenious  structure to the mercy of wind and wave although  not without the security of knowing that neither  wind nor wave could commit serious injury upon it   In shape write Messrs Kirby and Spence   this little boat pretty accurately resembles a  London wherry being sharper and higher to use  a nautical phrase fore and aft convex below and  concave above floating moreover constantly on  the keel or convex part But this they add fc is  not all it is besides a lifeboat more buoyant than  even Mr Greatheads The most violent agitation  of the water cannot sink it and what is more  extraordinary and a property still a desideratum  in our lifeboats though hollow it never becomes  filled with water even though exposed to the  torrents that often accompany a thunderstorm  To put this to the test I yesterday placed half a  dozen of these boats upon the surface of a tumbler  half full of water I then poured upon them a  stream of that element from the mouth of a great  bottle held a foot above them yet after this  treatment which was so rough as actually to  project one out of the glass I found them floating  as before upon their bottoms and not a drop of  water within their cavity  Some insects make the homes of their young  in the earth Of these the insect called the sand  wasp forms perhaps one of the most interesting  examples This insect selects generally a hard  sunny sandbank for the excavation it is about to  accomplish Armed with a pair of powerful jaws  by means of which the insect can break off good  sized fragments of the rock she is about to mine  she sets to her arduous undertaking with a bold  heart and it is not long before a tolerable cavity  is scooped out Many of our readers have seen  the manner in which human miners proceed when  they are forming a hole in a lime or other rock  for the purpose of blasting and must have noticed  that they are in the habit of using a little water  in order to facilitate the boring operation We  are all also familiar with the tale of Hannibal  chemically softening the Alpine rocks by means  of vinegar The little insect in question has  been instructed by the great Creator also to  adopt a means of shortening her labour for it  has been observed that she moistens the rock  by letting fall a drop or two of fluid upon it  from her mouth By this means her work goes  on rapidly The rubbish soon begins to accu¬  mulate It will be scarcely conjectured what  this patient labourer does with it Were we to  look narrowly at the sandbank which such wasps  Rubiish Towers of the SandWasp  frequent we should find on its surface a number  of curious little projections like horns rising from  the surface These are towers built by the sand  wasp of the pieces of rubbish which she scoops  out of her mine She cements them together and  instead of throwing them away she lays the masses  in regular order until they have assumed the ap¬  pearance here shown It has been supposed she  does this with a view to keep out enemies and to  keep her progeny cool just as in a tall house the  cellar is its coolest apartment so the height of the  tower in question seems to be an additional protec¬  tion against the rays of the scorching sun After  it has deposited its egg at the bottom of the exca¬  vation the sandwasp sets out on a foraging  expedition and hunts about until she finds certain  green caterpillars Seizing upon one of these she  flies with it to her mine and then returns for  more prey After collecting about a dozen of  these helpless beings fixing them so that they  are hopeless captives inside her dark prison she  bids farewell to the egg for the future wellbeing  of which she has thus assiduously provided She  takes down her tower of stones and with the  materials which composed it fills up the entrance  to the cell thus shutting in both the prisoners  and their future devourer in a common dungeon  there to await the changes which time will in¬  evitably bring about  Let us speak now of eggs carefully de¬  posited by other insects in galleries and excava¬  tions made into timber The insects which thus  act have been called by the fanciful title of car¬  penterbees in allusion to the drilling process  by which they penetrate the wood A highly  interesting spectacle it is in truth to see one  of these pigmy carpenters at her work and for¬  tunately some of the species are not very un¬  common in our gardens Spring is the season  when she commences her labours She recon¬  noitres about for a proper piece of timber for some  time and exhibits great discrimination in the  selection of a suitable place for establishing herself  and for the nurture of her progeny Strange to  say she will not select living wood such as the  trunk of a tree but generally prefers wood which  has already begun to decay as if fully aware that  such wood was likely to give her much less  trouble in boring than any other She also selects  a piece of wood placed in some sunny and genial  position with a view to the development and  comfort of her progeny This important point  being settled to her mind she next sets about the  work Well may Reaumur exclaim Truly the  labour she has undertaken demands strength  courage and patience  The violet carpenterbee is  perhaps the most interesting  example we can select She be¬  gins by cutting out with her  strong jaws small portions of the  timber and soon forms a little  hole which looks downwards and  inwards into the wood She then  alters the direction of her drilling  CarpenterBee  and now perforates the timber mndlv oflh Carr M  perpendicularly downwards and  in a parallel direction to the sides of the  wood Long and hard does she thus labour  until she has actually scooped out a tunnel in  the timber a foot or so in length and half  an inch in diameter Sometimes she will drill  several of these beautiful galleries in the wood  The task however arduous never seems to  weary her impelled by a heavenbestowed in¬  fluence she works strenuously and cheerfully for  weeks or even sometimes for months Our  readers may be interested to know what she does  with the sawdust If they can but get an op¬  portunity of watching her they will soon see her  mode of dealing with it Standing by the side of  the wood she is drilling and keeping our eyes sted  fastly fixed on the hole we shall presently observe  her head emerging from it and immediately after  she is seen to shovel out a little heap of the dust  which accumulates on the ground beneath into a  pile When her galleries are finished her labour is  yet far from accomplished She has now to deposit  her eggs and make provision for the prospective  wants of her young ones Now her eggs must  not be piled together nor be scattered about in  the same cavity The larvie which are to be pro¬  duced by them must each live in separation from  the others How is this fresh difficulty to be  overcome The insect soon supplies us with the  answer She has not forgotten her heap of saw¬  dust She first deposits an egg at the bottom of  the tunnel and then away she flies to the fields  for a load of the fine yellow dust of flowers called  pollen and also for honey She mixes these up  into a nice little mass of pollenbread or cake  which is intended for the food of the larva when it  comes out of the egg and then piles it up in the  gallery just over  the first egg She  then at a height  of about three  quarters of an  inch plaisters a  layer or ring of  sawdust made by  her into a sort of  mortar and adds  to this another and  another ring of the CMs °f carpenter b «»  same material until the ceiling is quite complete  and the cell thus formed is shut off from the rest of  the excavation by a circular plate of this substance  which effectually excludes all intercourse be¬  tween the occupants of this  wooden nursery Having  completed this cell she pro¬  ceeds in the same way to lay  an egg and to provide a store  of food and finally to close  in the rest of the gallery  until she has subdivided it into ten or twelve  Ceilingplate  separate apartments The appearance of the  circular ceilings formed on these ingenious prin¬  ciples is exhibited in the engraving annexed  One of the most striking facts  in connexion with the proceed¬  ings of this little creature has  yet to be brought under our  notice It will be readily ad¬  mitted that the first egg depo¬  sited at the bottom of the gallery  will be the first in point of time  that will be hatched and conse¬  quently the first to require to  make its escape from the wooden  prisonhouse of its birth How  is it possible for this to take  place when above the poor pri¬  soners head are ten or twelve  cells full of other occupants  and each shut in with a hard  ceiling and floor By referring  to the figure we obtain a clue  Section of Cells showing the  ways of escape  to this enigma It is here  seen that there are holes which communicate  with the tunnel within The uppermost of these  holes was the one by means of which the tunnel  was first formed but the two lower ones have  been expressly formed by the carpenterbee to  provide against the dilemma in which her young  would otherwise have been placed They form  as it were posterns or back doors by which when  the insect is perfected it is easily enabled to  make its escape Singular indeed it is that the  insects previous to passing into their last trans¬  formation arrange themselves with their heads  downwards so that every one of them generally  emerges at the socalled backdoor of the mansion  There are many similar instances in natural  history of the manifest wisdom and forethought of  the Creator of all things visible and invisible  but we may safely say there are not many which  show it in so clear and striking a point of view as  this It is to be remembered this industrious  insect in the arrangements in question does not act  from past experience She never saw her young  brood nor could learn of herself their wants and  dispositions yet her plans for their welfare are  as admirably contrived as if she had brought up  generation after generation under her own eye  and had learnt wisdom by the lapse of years  Plainly therefore her actions are all directed by  an impulse given her from God and we may well  exclaim with the wise king of old it is God who   doth instruct her to discretion and doth teach  her Altogether what an example of patience  and cheerfulness in her labours and of admirable  wisdom in their performance is presented to  us by this little sketch of the history of the  carpenterbees nest  Among the birds discovered in Australia is one  called the Bowerbird from its fondness for making  a bower which it ornaments in a very pretty  manner Other instances of a somewhat similar  kind could be mentioned tending to show that  some of the lower animals are as fond of decorating  their dwellings as we are ourselves There is how¬  ever in the insect world a little creature which has  been called the tapestrybee which adorns the  place where its progeny is to be born with a tapestry  as novel as it is elegant The great entomologist  whom we have before quoted thus describes his  first discovery of this interesting fact In one  of my rambles which had led me through several  lanes and in the course of which I had frequently  stopped to examine the little tunnels pierced in  the earth by various insects my companions began  to engage in the same occupation with myself  one of them at length perceived and pointed out  to my notice a tunnel which had some peculiarities  of appearance not possessed by the others we had  seen its interior seemed to be painted with ver¬  milion A small twig was immediately gently  pushed into it and with a knife we carefully  removed the earth which surrounded it taking  great care not to injure the walls of the tunnel  When we had uncovered it sufficiently it was  found that the little stick was buried in a tube  made of the leaves of the field poppy   I need scarcely say that during the remainder  of our ramble we were exclusively occupied in  searching for similar holes It is a common obser¬  vation that when a fact which has not hitherto  been recognised among those presented to us in  nature is once caught sight of we are almost sure  to see it again and again until we wonder how it  could have been that it was never noticed before  We therefore now found other holes leading to  similar tubes formed in the same manner of the  flowers of the red poppy Altogether before re¬  turning home we found seven or eight of them  and since that time I have found them in all their  different stages These elegantly decorated  apartments were subsequently found to belong to  the tapestrybee  This bee in forming the future abode of her  young begins by scooping out a burrow in some  pathway which she bores to the depth of two or  three inches She then smooths the walls of this  cavity and all being now ready for putting up  the hangings she betakes herself to the fields and  alights upon some freshexpanded poppy flower  just displaying its crimson cheeks to the light of  day Here she quickly plies the scissors which  she has been armed with for this purpose and in a  very short time cuts out of the bright petal on  which she rests a smooth portion of a definite size  She then returns home and by means of the  scissors and her legs she  cuts and smooths the  piece until it lays quite  flat upon the bottom of  her cell This done she  flies for more and in a  short time could we  peep in we might find  her mansion all over¬  spread with tapestry  more bright in colour  and more delicate in  point of finish and tex¬  ture than human art  can by possibility pro¬  duce The apartment  being thus not only de¬  corated but rendered  both to the eye and senses warm and comfort¬  able she then stores up in it a quantity of pollen  and honey until she has filled it to the height of  half an inch when she deposits the egg for wdiose  Poppyflower cut by the Bee  wants and as we might say even luxuries she  has thus elegantly provided folding some of the  hangings carefully over it The remainder of the  cavity is filled with loose earth  We have taken it for granted  in this account that the in¬  sect really takes a pleasure in  the brilliant colours with which  she ornaments her cell but it  is only right to say in addi¬  tion that we have of course  no positive proof that such is  really the case For aught we  know her motives may be very  different it is however an  amusing way to consider these actions be the ex¬  planation of them what it may  We fear however we dare not promise our  readers the same success as that which attended  M Reaumur and his companions It has been  thought that this interesting insect is not a native  of our island and it is certain it has not been  commonly observed amongst us but Mr Rennie  in his work on Insect Architecture says that at a  beautiful seabathing village in Ayrshire he once  found in a footpath a great number of the perfo¬  rations of the tapestrybee At all events they  deserve looking for  Although we have perhaps lingered long enough  over the insect cradle we must spare room for one  or two more remarks on this subject and it were  almost a shame while speaking thereon to omit  a notice of one of the most elegant cradles of all  one made with roseleaves As Reaumurs account  of the manner in which he first became acquainted  with these egg depositories is very pleasantly  written we shall extract the substance of it from  his work It was one day in July 1736 that a  gentleman of rank accompanied by his suite and  his gardener who was in a state of great alarm  waited upon an eminent naturalist in Paris The  gardener had left his masters countryseat near  Rouen to proceed with all haste to the metropolis  in order to communicate to his master the terrible  tidings that his ground was bewitched He had  the courage however to pick up the spells or  charms which the sorcerer had placed in the earth  and to carry them to his master in full belief that  they were sufficient to convince all the world of  the reality of the enchantment He had indeed  in the first instance taken them to the parish  priest begging his counsel and both came to the  same conclusionthat without doubt the garden  was now enchanted ground When the gentleman  saw the little things his gardener called charms  which are here  represented  he was much  perplexed al¬  though his  good sense led  him to ridicule  the idea of the  Leaf tubes bewitchment of  his property by such means He applied to his  medical adviser for a solution of this problem  but alas he was no entomologist and could  not enlighten him but he directed him to the  naturalist of whom mention has been made and  whose name was M Nollet On being admitted to  the presence of this gentleman the terrorstricken  gardener hastily put on the table the little rolls  of leaves he considered to be spells and which  had been made with some evil design as he  doubted not by the malevolent hands of some  sorcerer Fortunately M Nollet had in his mu¬  seum some rolls of leaves formed with equal art  by beetles he produced them and showed them  to the affrighted man assuring him that without  doubt they had been formed by insects and that  it was therefore highly probable that the rolls in  question were the productions of some other insects  of a different species The gardener looked incre¬  dulous being apparently unwilling to give up his  alarm until M Nollet greatly to his horror took  up one of those little leafrolls which had caused  him so much uneasiness and carefully unfolding  it drew from thence a fat little larva The  moment the gardener saw the little creature his  fears and troubled aspect vanished and an air of  cheerfulness spread over his face such as one  might imagine as the result of deliverance from  some fearful peril The only reward M Nollet  would receive from the poor man for thus dissi¬  pating his cares and fears was that he should leave  the leafrolls with him and collecting more of  them should send them to M Reaumurs address  for him to examine This little anecdote affords  us a good illustration of the connexion of super¬  stitious fears with ignorance on points of natural  history and sets before us in wellrelieved contrast  the foolish terrors of the unlearned gardener with  the collected bearing of the learned naturalist  Would that this anecdote stood alone in the  records of natural history We have already seen  that it does not and that the most groundless  apprehensions have taken their rise in the most in¬  nocent and trifling of natural causes  By and by after a little careful investigation  the true artificer of these spells was discovered  and proved to be a lowly insect which has been  since called the roseleafcutter bee On closer  examination these rolls of leaveswhich are  almost as long and as large as a toothpick case  were found to be made up of six or seven cells  each separate from the rest placed end to end  and covered with a common coating of leaves  The manner in which the roll is formed is as  followsThe insect sometimes makes a perfora¬  tion in decayed wood sometimes in the well  trodden earth of a footpath this she drives to  the depth of perhaps nine inches and she then  proceeds to hang this apartment with its green  tapestryfor it must be understood it is not the  leaves of the flower but of the stem of the rose  treeor in otlier words the green leaves that  she selects for this purpose The insect alights  upon what she considers to be a suitable leaf and  begins with her sharp jaws to cut out a piece of a  crescent form from its edge When she has cut  perhaps halfway round or rather more she sets  her wings in motion so as to keep her balanced in  the air lest she should drag away the halfcut  piece before it was properly divided  from the leaf When cut she places  it in a perpendicular position be¬  tween her legs and flies away with  it to her cell She then simply  folds it into a proper form and The Bee with a lea fcut  overlays the cell walls with this leafy covering  not using any cement to make it retain its form  but relying upon the natural elasticity of the leaf  to keep it close pressed against the wall in the  manner in which she places it Repeating this  process several times she finally completes each  cell with exquisite art and care and taking the  precaution of arranging all her joints and seams so  that they shall not present themselves in the same  place but covering them over with pieces of leaf  so as to strengthen them and in many other  respects exibiting an amount of mechanical and  mathematical skill never sufficiently to be admired  she now deposits the minute egg in it which is to  become the toilsome busy patient and clever being  the fullgrown insect of her own species Mind¬  ful of its future wants she then compounds a  delicate mass of pink conserve which she collects  from thistles and subsequently stops up each cell  with thin pieces of leaf as exactly round as if  they had been cut out with a punch or by means  of some mathematical instrument  Reaumur says he often in the month of May  on looking at his rosetrees detected these insects  at their work all he had to do was to stand and  patiently watch by the side of a tree the leaves of  which exhibited the singular marks made by this  insect Many times have the same appearances  arrested our attention and without doubt that of  the reader The spectacle of insect ingenuity  which it affords well promises to repay a little  exertion in endeavouring to find out the nest to  which the pieces are conveyed and some neigh¬  bouring post or footpath will probably discover it  to us after a sharp scrutiny Sometimes the insect  makes a bad choice of a leaf it may be perhaps  too tough for her but she soon discovers her  mistake and leaves it half cut to seek a better on  the same branch  A Rosebranch cut by the Bee  The nest formed by a species of moth for depo¬  siting her eggs in is one equally interesting to  describe From the resemblance of her actions to  the wellknown account of those of the eiderduck  whose maternal love strips her breast of down for the  purpose of protecting her eggs we might almost  venture to call this moth the eidermoth were it not  that it is known under another and far less appro¬  priate namethe gipsymoth Indeed in the care  of the insect the mothers love is as we might say  even more powerful than in the bird for while  the latter has the pride and pleasure of seeing her  little ones grow up around her the poor insect after  stripping herself of her own soft warm down thus  testifying her love to her offspring even to death  presently expires The insect in forming her nest  first plucks off by means of a singular instrument  like a pair of tweezers with which she is provided  a little portion of down from her body seated  upon a tree she attaches this to its trunk and then  deposits an egg in it which immediately adheres  to the down and becomes coated with it The  remainder of her operations until she has depo¬  sited the entire number of eggs are but repetitions  of the same actions When the process is at an  end she begins to form a regular tile or covering  to her nest and this she effects with a degree  of skill not unworthy of the most consummate  thatcher She arranges the hairs of the down  just as the thatcher does his stems of straw  for the cottage roof so that they all slope down  The Nest fo the Gipsymoth  wards resembling much the smooth pile of a hat  By this arrangement of the down it is next to  impossible that in the most drenching shower the  eggs warmly wrapped up within should be wetted  or otherwise injured and the down itself being a  material which as we all know is a nonconductor  preserves the eggs from the influence of the most  severe frosts In shape this nest of eggs resembles  a skittle or a truncated cone the broad end down¬  wards The engraving represents this form and  also shows the insect at work constructing the nest  Let us now pass on to mention that many eggs  are deposited without any special protection of the  kind we have described and without what would  be with propriety termed  a nest A moth called  the lackey moth fre¬  quently ornaments the  young twigs of trees  in our gardens with  exquisite bracelets of  glistening white eggs  looking like beads From  two to three hundred of  these eggs are glued on  Eggs of Lackeymoth  Natural sige and magnified  by the insect around the twig by means of a  tenacious waterproof cement and are arranged  with an accuracy of the most marvellous cha¬  racter in a close spiral line upon the twig  The cement employed by the insect in uniting  her eggs and in varnishing them over is so  hard as to serve the purpose of a covering  which admirably casts off the rain and preserves  the eggs free from injury by the elements all the  winter long Many eggs are simply glued on  irregularly upon the stems and leaves of plants  their shells or outer coating together with the  protecting varnish being sufficient to preserve  them from the inclemencies of the weather but  some are piled together with the most striking  regularity in regular columns of eggs  In addition to these it is proper to state that  some insects lay their eggs in the body of the  young of others Of these those which are most  dreaded by the insect tribe are the little but  terrible flies called Ichneumons They are so  called because in their actions they agree with the  popular account of those of the ichneumons of  Egypt which were venerated as the destroyers of  the eggs of serpents and crocodiles Such say  Messrs Kirby and Spence is the activity and  address of the ichneumons that scarcely any con  cealment except perhaps the waters can secure  their prey from them and neither bulk courage  nor ferocity avail to terrify them from effecting  their purpose They attack the ruthless spider in  his toils they discover the retreat of the little  bee that for safety bores deep into timber and  though its enemy the ichneumon cannot enter its  cell by means of her long ovipositor organ for  depositing the egg she reaches the helpless grub  which its parent vainly thought secured from  every foe and deposits in it an egg which pro¬  duces a larva that destroys it In vain does the  destructive cecidomia of the whecit conceal its larva  within the glumes that so closely cover the grain  three species of these minute benefactors of our  race sent in mercy by Heaven know how to in¬  troduce their eggs into them thus preventing the  mischief they would otherwise occasion and saving  mankind from the horrors of famine In vain  also the cynips by its magic touch produces the  curious excrescences on various trees and plants  called gulls for the nutriment and defence of its  progeny This parasite insect discovers its secret  chamber pierces its wall however thick and  commits the destroying egg to its offspring In  vain also might we add does the sandwasp  excavate her deep cell for her young ones for  when once the ichneumon has discovered the  retreat the destruction of the young larvas is  inevitable She pierces through the defences  piled over the mouth of the cavity with all the  precision and patience of a higher creature and  rests not until she has thrust down her long  ovipositor and placed the egg in the body of the  helpless prisoner below when she flies away con¬  fident that the days of her victim are numbered  and having thus doomed him to be eaten up alive  The common caterpillar which by its ravages in  our cabbage rows makes itself a little too familiar  to us has a fierce enemy in these flies they dart  upon it pierce its body in many places laying an  egg in each wound these in due time become  hatched and eat their way out of the body of the  poor caterpillar who soon dies while the larva  after undergoing their proper transformations  become perfect insects themselves fully equipped  to proceed to the same work in some other indi¬  vidual of the caterpillar kind  To man this ordinance of the Creator that  some insects should lay their eggs in the bodies  of others and so destroy them is of inestimable  benefit It is quite impossible to imagine what  would be the result were weevils caterpillars  and such like insects to be permitted to multiply  without a check Produce of all kinds would soon  be consumed and the desolations of an universal  famine would overwhelm man and beast But  God has been pleased to ordain it otherwise In  proportion to the increase of the destroyers is the  increase of those that prey upon and destroy them  Thus what has been well called the balance of  creation is preserved and by means of the insects  in question conjoined to other causes is the  command to the destroying powers enforced   Hitherto shall ye come but no farther  CHAPTER IT  STRUCTURE AND CONTENTS OF THE EGG  In the past pages we have now considered  shortly the various methods of depositing the eggs  of insects and have seen that the nursing place  where the young being is produced differs widely  both in point of its position and of the external  circumstances which variously affect it For some  are the deepbored galleries in timber for some  the hardwrought tunnel scooped by an insect out  of a rock for some the ingeniouslyformed boat or  raft which is to carry its cargo of life buoyant on  the dancing waters all the days of its appointed  time waiting until its change come for some  the cell of earth lined with painted hangings  exquisite in make and colour for some the little  leafcase curiously folded together but for others  none of those works of insect art are provided  they hid in a rainproof covering of varnish lie  open to every eye or scattered here and there on  all and every kind of flower and herbage lie at  the mercy of every wandering foot While lastly  others are buried with a cruel yet merciful art  in the bodies of myriads of unsuspecting members  of the insect community lying like the seeds of  evil in the heart of the infant dormant awhile  but destined to grow with its growth and to  strengthen with its strength  The time has therefore now come that we  should speak a little more particularly upon the  nature and character of the eggs of insects The  shape of an insects egg although frequently  something of an oval in its outline is very various  in fact were the egg of some peculiar species  placed in the field of a microscope probably not  one general observer out of a hundred could in  the least imagine what the object at which he was  looking really was Sometimes they are oval and  exactly resemble the form of the egg of the bird  but in other instances they are of the most irre¬  gular and fantastic appearance Some look like  pillboxes tied over and down their sides with  string others look like tiny flasks with many  raised ribs upon their surface others have  lids and springs The gnats egg resembles a  chemists phial or one of the new bottles for  holding aerated waters and those of the dungfly  Various forms of Eggs  have two little pieces sticking out at the top on  each side to prevent them sinking too deep into  the matter upon which they are deposited  The eggs of some insects strikingly resemble  the little shells like turbans with which we are  most of us familiar A very singular variety of  egg which has often caused much perplexity to  naturalists is the egg of the lacewinged fly Reau  mer says I had observed them several years  without actually knowing what they were Others  as well as myself had noticed that on the leaves  and twigs of many trees were a number of minute  stalks placed together scarcely as thick as a hair  their colour was nearly white and they were  about an inch in length there were sometimes  ten or twelve placed in a bunch the end of each  stalk bore a small head of an egglike or oblong  figure They ap¬  peared to me to be  fungi the little head  precisely resem¬  bling the appear¬  ance of moulds as  seen under the mi¬  croscope but they  were larger in size  They were in fact  the eggs of the fly  in question When  the larva escapes  from them they  have much the ap¬  pearance of little  vases and the same  Eg SS or Lacewinged Fly author assures US  that they were once described and engraved by a  naturalist as some curious minute flower growing  on the leaves of the elder for which he was unable  to account The representation of them in the  cut will enable the reader to form his own opinion  as to the difficulty of ascertaining whether they  were flowers or the nests of an insect  The manner in which these eggs are thus regu¬  larly placed by the insect is interesting Placing  herself upon the  leaf in the atti¬  tude represent¬  ed she fastens a  thread to the  leaf draws it out  in the same way  as a spider does  her lines and  when it has got  sufficiently firm  the wise insect  then puts forth  the egg glueing Manner of depositing the Egg  it to the extre¬  mity of the stalk this done she quits it and begins  to form another repeating the same actions until  the proper number is laid Poised on the summit  of these slender pillars the eggs are secure from  every invader but man himself and in time there  comes from them the larva which is to become the  beautiful insect the ts lacewinged fly in all the  elegance of its form  From what has been already stated the surface  of the eggs of insects it will be perceived is by  no means in all cases smooth and polished as in  the case of birds Far otherwise To look at  some of them by the help of a magnifying glass  we should imagine that they were covered with  very fine lace net others appear as if some clever  engraver had been chasing some intricate design  upon their surface The eggs of a species of  butterfly are studded over with an infinite number  of little knots or tubercles and those of another  are capped at the top with sculptured work dis¬  posed in the form of a circular tiling or roof to  the egg Some also closely resemble embossed  buttons  He who has thus adorned these minute objects  with beauty of form and carving has likewise  bestowed upon them the most beautiful and  variegated colours colours such as no human  art can imitate But from the small size of the  eggs it is difficult to appreciate this beauty in  them except when they occur in a mass The  most common tints are white yellow and green  but the richer and rarer hues are also to be found  amono them Thus the eggs of a moth are of a  beautiful blue colour banded in the most delicate  manner by three zones or rings of brown the  contrast being very pleasing Another moth which  loves to deposit its eggs in the bark of the willow  produces them tinged with a purple more delicate  than ever Tyrian lady wore as the finest produce  of the dyers art In the deep crevices of the bark of  the elm and only therefore to be found by sharp  scrutiny another moth lays eggs of a lovely pink  Messrs Kirby and Spence write We remember  once being much surprised at seeing the water at  one end of a canal in our garden as red as blood  upon examining it further we found it discoloured  by an infinite number of minute red eggs Some¬  times eggs are spotted and thus resemble the eggs  of many birds and strange to say sometimes  they change colour in a very remarkable manner  so that as far as colour is concerned an observer  could scarcely believe that the egg was the same  he beheld perhaps a few days previously The  eggs of the chameleon fly as we are told by the  gentlemen last quoted are at first pure white  then change to green and finally turn to a deep  olivegreen Others are at first mousecoloured  then reddish and lastly black The eggs of a  kind of moth we have seen first of the colour of  sulphur then becoming green after that rose  colour and lastly black In the instances of the  common gnat and silkworm similar changes  of colour take place The eggs of the gnat are  first white then green and finally gray and those  of the silkworm are in the first instance of a  pale yellow and ultimately take on a violet tint  Having thus noticed these points in connexion  with we are led to that  most important of all periods the dawn of life  in the egg or in common terms the period of  hatching But before proceeding to the sub¬  ject may we not pause and wonder as we behold  the varied manifestations of the Creators wisdom  in the actions of the minute and as we often call  them insignificant creatures of whom we have  spoken Should David say when he beheld the  sun moon and stars as the work of a Divine  hand Lord what is man that thou considerest  him or the son of man that thou regardest  him And shall not we as we contemplate the  few particulars here set down of the wonders of  insectlife exclaim with even greater astonish¬  ment What are these that thou considerest  them Let no one then say that entomology or  any other natural science whose field of study lies  chiefly among the minute portions of creation are  profitless sciences when they can reveal to us such  a display of the power wisdom and love of God  as is exhibited even in this small portion of the  Life of an Insect  Let us then take up one of these eggs so  minute but containing within it the rudiments of  a being which is in time to assume a form of con  siderable magnitude by comparison and to be  adorned with colours richer than art can boast of  and let us examine it on the field of a tolerably  powerful microscope We need not look far for a  specimen In the dark corner of the ceiling in a  neglected room after removing the mass of dust  filled webs that have accumulated there for months  we may find without difficulty a spiders nest of  eggs A more pleasant place to search for insects  eggs is perhaps the garden and if in the crevices  of the bark of the trees or attached to twigs  or branches none can be found we can almost  certainly promise success if the reader will care¬  fully and patiently  search the angles of  the garden walls par¬  ticularly if he has  noticed in the pre¬  ceding autumn many  of the beautiful webs  of the gardenspider  There in some shel¬  tered recess where  the pattering rain¬  drops may be heard  but never venture in  Nests of Garden Spider  and where few eyes would detect them may be  found little round yellow balls of the size of a  small cherry made of the most beautiful golden  coloured silk and attached by a slender stalk to  the wall or perhaps to a twig Sometimes they  exhibit the more elegant and curious appearance  shown in the figure on the next page resembling  an inverted wineglass or pear  On taking our prize indoors by the aid of a  very sharp penknife we may succeed in cutting it  smoothly open and in turning out some of the deli  cate eggs which lie warmly covered up at the bottom  Taking one of them up on the point of the knife and  laying it on the microscopefield we shall be able to  see something of the anatomy of an insects egg  First we may notice what seems  to be the shell that is the outer  covering of the egg This is very dif¬  ferent to the hard calcareous egg¬  shell of birds It is stated not to con¬  tain any lime in its composition as  the shells of birds do for when the  eggs of insects are put into very  weak sulphuric acid and water which  would act on the lime if it were pre¬  sent in their composition they are not  affected by it Although therefore  some eggs of insects are very hard  so hard indeed as to resist severe pres¬  sure with the nail they do not owe  their hardness as do the eggs of  birds to any lime in their chemical  composition The outer coat or shell is  apparently simply membraneous frequently vary¬  ing greatly in thickness being sometimes as dense  and horny as we have mentioned and at others so  delicate as to burst with the gentlest touch  Could we now do wliat it is so easy to do with  the egg of a fowlcarefully take off a little portion  of this outer shell we should be able to inspect  its contents more accurately But in the case of  most who read this book this extremely delicate  task will prove after many trials probably a hope¬  less failure Let us state therefore what some  expert and talented observers have found within  the insects egg It appears then that although  there is both a yolk and a white in the  tiny egg before us that they are not quite so  distinct as in the bird Yet they are sufficiently  separate from one another to make their differ¬  ences complete Probably the reader has noticed  in the hens egg a little round spot in the middle  of the yolk or yellow portion from this the  future bird is produced Although from their ex¬  treme minuteness it is difficult to detect anything  of this kind in the eggs of insects some observers  state they have seen a similar little spot in them  also Thus M Herold says that in the eggs of  the very insect whose nest we have robbed the gar¬  den spider this little spot can be seen as a minute  white point immediately under the shell and  in the middle of its circumference This was seen  by holding it up to the light and the spot was  more carefully examined by gently pressing the  contents of a spiders egg upon a watchglass  Mr Rennie says that the point where the cater¬  pillar originates answering to the scar in the eggs  of birds we can readily distinguish even by the  naked eye in the larger species of eggs as it lies  always immediately under the shell But it may  be doubted whether without the assistance of  some one versed in entomology many who make  the same attempt will succeed So much depends  in looking at any object upon whether we know  what to look for or not so that things which are  as clearly seen as possible by the eyes of the  initiated are not seen at all by any others To  perceive some things in natural history and many  in science the senses of sight hearing and touch  require to be well educated and they then become  apparent enough  And is this all that we can mention about the  structure of an egg This indeed is all Can it  be possible Is there no striking and broad differ¬  ence to mark the nature of the future insect Is  the egg of a spider the same in the number and  nature of its parts as that of a butterfly or the  egg of a gnat as that of a beetle Surely as we  should imagine there must be some important  differences between these otherwise why such  immense differences in the perfect insect Could  any one imagine that a grasshopper and a house  fly so strangely unlike each other in their perfect  forms originated in eggs to either of which the  same description of an insects egg would accu¬  rately answer and leave nothing out However  great our amazement the fact is uncjuestionable  The egg of every insect at first consists of an outer  covering a white a yolk and the little spot we  have alluded to We might have thought that in  creating so many different species of insects which  differ so surprisingly in form as the insect tribes  do the great Creator would have formed their  eggs essentially different too But except in the  matter of shape all are originally alike and the  wisest philosopher is unable to inform us of any  essential difference in the eggs of insects at first  The eye of God who knows the end from the  beginning sees some difference inappreciable to  the eye of man He said to this kind Cf Be thou  thus and to that Be thou different but until  the time comes when the young insect is much  more advanced it is not possible for us to recog¬  nise those marks of variety which His hand has  laid upon them from the beginning  CHAPTER III  LIFE BEGINS IN THE EGG  The eggs of birds are in most instances hatched  by the warmth of the mother who sits for a cer¬  tain time covering them with her wings and  downy breast But the exception to the rule in  insects is that the mother has anything to do with  rearing her young brood the cases in which this  takes place will be noticed in our next chapter  Generally speaking the eggs of insects are hatched  by the increasing temperature of the air in spring  The following sketch extracted from Mr Darwins  interesting Journal of the Voyage of the Beagle  sets before us in a very pleasing manner the  awakening influence of this season to all nature   When we first arrived at Bahia Blanca Sep¬  tember 7th 1832 we thought nature had granted  scarcely a living creature to this dry and sandy  country By digging however in the ground  several insects large spiders and lizards were  found in a halftorpid state On the 15th a few  animals began to appear and by the 18th three  days from the equinox everything announced the  commencement of spring the plains were orna¬  mented by the flowers of a pink woodsorrel wild  peas oenotherce and geraniums and the birds  began to lay their eggs Numerous beetles were  crawling about while the saurian tribe the con¬  stant inhabitants of a sandy soil darted in every  direction  As to the torpid animal and buried seed so to  the carefully laid up egg the returning warmth of  the air is the signal for the commencement of life  The winterclouds roll reluctantly back as the  genial days of spring advance and the changes  which are to have their accomplishment in the  production of a living being out of the minute  object before us are set in movement as the days  grow bright and pleasant That the hatching of  the egg in most cases is due chiefly to the stimu¬  lating influence of heat is now well ascertained  The schoolboy who has ever amused himself with  silkworms can well assure us of this fact for he  is in the habit of hatching the insects eggs by  carefully wrapping them in paper and keeping  them in his waistcoatpocket where they have all  the comfort and warmth of his body to bring them  forward In countries where the silkworm is  reared women carry them in their bosom and by  this means cause the young larva to come forth  from the eg in much less time than it would  naturally occupy By removing a twig of a plant  upon which in the preceding autumn an insect  may have been found to have deposited its eggs  into a warm room an opportunity will be had of  putting this operation practically to the test In  a short time it will be found that the eggs are all  hatched and that a number of minute larvae are  crawling actively about while their brethren in  the snowcovered fields are yet safely asleep in the  shell  On the other hand eggs which would otherwise  be hatched the same year are arrested by the ad¬  vancing cold of the winter season and are now  compelled to wait until the ensuing spring before  their time of hatching arrives Evidently there¬  fore to the commencement of  the condition of the external temperature is an all  important consideration Before proceeding imme  diately to consider the nature of the changes it  may be mentioned as an interesting fact that  although the eggs of insects are very quickly  sensible of a slight increase of heat and in con¬  sequence of its application to them very soon  begin to live yet they will endure the most  severe degrees of cold almost without inj ury As  an illustration of this point we may transcribe a  few sentences from a paper by the great Spallan¬  zani upon this subject  The year 1709 when the thermometer fell  to 1° Fahrenheit or thirtyone degrees below  freezing point is celebrated for its rigour and its  fatal effects on plants and animals Who can  believe exclaims Boerhaave 4 that the severity  of this winter did not destroy the eggs of insects  especially those exposed to its influence in the  open fields on the naked earth or on the branches  of trees Yet when the spring had tempered  the air these eggs produced as they usually did  after the mildest winters He adds further on I  have exposed eggs to a more rigorous trial than  the winter of 1709those of several insects and  among others the silkworm moth and elmbut¬  terfly were enclosed in a glass vessel and buried  five hours in a mixture of ice and rocksalt the  thermometer falling 6° below zero In the middle  of the following spring however caterpillars  came from all the eggs and at the same time as  from those which had suffered no cold In the  following year I submitted them to an experiment  still more hazardous A mixture of ice and rock  salt with the burning spirit of nitre reduced the  thermometer 22° below zero that is 23° lower  than the cold of 1709 or 52° lower than the  point at which water freezes They were not  injured as I had evident proofby their being  hatched  When it is known that many seeds will not  endure these degrees of cold without injury and  those even of some tolerably hardy plants it is the  more surprising to find such apparently delicate  and readily damaged objects as the eggs of these  members of the insect tribe thus resisting an in¬  tensity of cold to Avhich in a state of nature they  are scarcely ever exposed It is impossible to  assign any rational explanation of these singular  facts It is undoubtedly owing to this power of  resisting the generally deadly influence of extreme  cold that we find insects reappear in spring even  in countries where the winter is much prolonged  and is of extreme severity Thus in Lapland we  should have probably thought that the rigour of  the climate would have been fatal to all insects in  winter in any condition whether in the egg or  in other forms but as the poor inhabitants know  to their cost it is far different The mosquitoes  swarm in that country in numbers so prodigious  that they have been compared to a fall of snow or  to the dust of the earth The wretched natives  cannot take a mouthful of food or lie down to  sleep in their cabins unless they are fumigated to  a degree almost dangerous to life They fill the  mouth and nostrils and minute though they are  render existence almost a burden by their blood¬  thirsty propensities Not even thick plasters of  the most offensive compoundstar oil and grease  are sufficient to shield the Laplanders skin from  their attacks The great John Hunter considered  that this power of resisting cold was in some un¬  explained manner connected with the existence of  a living principle in the egg which had the effect  of withstanding a degree of cold that would other¬  wise have been fatal to it but after all this is  only an apology for an explanation When we  are unable to clear up tlie difficulties of a natural  history question like this although we cannot  explain we are not prohibited from admiring and  can clearly perceive that in thus endowing the  eggs of insects with a selfpreservative power  God has manifested his wisdom and forethought  for had it been otherwise the lapse of a few seasons  would have depopulated the insect world leaving  us it is true without a gnat or a mosquito to  annoy us but also without a silkworm or a bee  to supply us with the precious products of insect  industry  The frosts have disappeared the air brightens  the sun loses its pale aspect and glows with a  more golden face The days lengthen the breeze  has lost its penetrating chilliness gentle showers  descend and water the earth and there is a general  voice heard all over creation Spring has come  The eggs of a thousand insect species have already  perceived its presence and the newlyawakened  beings within hasten to welcome it by bursting  from the shell their long occupied but now for ever  forsaken dwellingplace Sometimes the young  larva bursts through the thin walls of the shell  by main force or eats its way through by means  of its jaws which is occasionally a task of many  hours duration In many instances however  write Messrs Kirby and Spence cc the larva is  spared this trouble one end of the egg being fur¬  nished with a little lid or trapdoor which it has  but to force up and it can then emerge at pleasure  Such lids are to be found in the eggs of several  butterflies and moths The eggs of a species of  bug besides a convex lid are furnished with a  very curious machine as it would seem for throw  ins it off This machine is dark brown of a  horny substance and of the shape of a crossbow  the bowpart being attached to the lid or pushing  against it and the handle by means of a mem¬  brane to the upper end of the side of the egg  But if in our account of the various attendants  on the opening of spring we had mentioned every  circumstance that takes place at that time alas  for any poor insects or at least for a large  number of them who should be hatched at that  time The warm air and gentle shower and  brighter sky would ill satisfy them in the absence  of all food and they would be born by a cruel  destiny only to starve and die We well know  this is not the case but there are probably few  persons who have ever thought much upon the  admirable arrangement by which the occurrence  of such a calamity to many of the insect tribes is  avoided We need scarcely remind the reader  that in the opening sentence of the last paragraph  there is one most important omission in the sketch  of the phenomena of returning spring that is that  there is no mention of what takes place in plants  of the putting forth of their young and tender  leaves Now as a majority of insects in the larva  state are vegetablefeeders we can easily under¬  stand that the unfortunate little beings if hatched  before the appearance of leaves would without  doubt quickly perish for lack of proper food Yet  the returning warmth of the air is all that is requisite to call the insect into existence and if by the  time it is ready to burst from the shell there is not  food all prepared for it it must die The difficulty  has been beautifully provided for and perhaps  few other instances of the wisdom of the Creator  in forming the insect world are so full of instructive thought as this It has been ordained then  that soon as winter is over the plant is first to  obey the voice of spring and to awake and the  bursting buds on its lower boughs are already full  charged with sap long before the young insect  being that is to be fed therewith has left the  shelter of the egg  One of the talented authors of the Introduction  to Entomology relates a pleasing anecdote in reference to this simple yet admirable arrangement  and mutual adjustment of these two eventsthe  awakening of life in the plant and in the insect   On the 20th of February 1816 observing the  twigs of the birches in the Hull Botanic Garden  to be thickly set especially about the buds with  minute oval black eggs of some insect with which  I was unacquainted I brought home a small  branch and set it in my study in which is a fire  daily to watch their exclusion On the 28th of  March I observed that a numerous brood of  aphides had been hatched from them and that two  or three of the lower buds had expanded into  leaves upon the sap of which they were greedily  feasting This was full a month before either a  leaf of the birch appeared or the egg of an aphis  was disclosed in the open air Thus showing that  the coming to life of the branch and of the insects  resting on it was beautifully arranged to take  place each at the proper time  It is very singular to add that as some trees  acquire their leaves earlier or later than others  the eggs of insects which are deposited on them  never are hatched before the leaves appear even  while some of their companion eggs of a different  species and placed therefore on different trees  may have long since sent their young into the  world Thus we learn that not only has God  been pleased to arrange generally the hatching of  the eggs of insects and the putting forth of the  leaves of trees so that the latter shall precede the  former but it has also been ordered that the eggs  deposited on each particular plant shall be hatched  just when the time of that plants putting forth its  leaves shall arrive at whatever period that may  be This may be more readily comprehended by  an example thus there is no difference so far  as we can perceive between the eggs of the little  insects just mentioned as feasting on the leaves  of the birch and those whose food is the leaf  of the ash yet the birch will be in leaf nearly  a month before the ashtree and the eggs depo¬  sited on it will therefore be hatched a month  before those placed upon the ash although both  trees are in the same position with regard to  warmth and may even perhaps be within a yard  or two of one another What a beautiful and  mysterious link is this between events so disproportionately important as the clothing of a great  tree with its leafy garments and the coming to life  of a little throng of beings whose dwellingplace  is a small twig and whose world a green leaf  Yet it was not too insignificant a matter for Him to  arrange whose dwellingplace is eternity and who  takes up the islands as a very little thing Does  God take thought for these and will He not  much more care for and arrange well every event  in the lives of his faithful children Surely yes  Speaking generally the time taken up in  hatching the eggs of insects is very variable It is  a general rule that the eggs which are laid in the  autumn must abide the return of spring before  they will be hatched But when eggs are de¬  posited in the summer they are often hatched in a  very short time The eggs of the paintedlady  butterfly are hatched in about eight days those of  the ladybird in a little less from five to six days  the eggs of another species of butterfly occupy a  month those of spiders three weeks those of bees  only three days and those of the meatfly shorter  than anyonly a few hours it has even been stated  that in very warm weather the eggs of the meat¬  fly will be hatched in about two hours In most  of these cases much depends upon the weather  but even this does not operate beyond certain  limits for it has been said that in the month of  June even if silkworms eggs were placed in  an icehouse they would be hatched in spite of the  cold but this observation deserves to be repeated  It would be impossible to make the exact nature  of the changes which take place in the egg from  first to last easily understood in a work of this  kind They have occupied the laborious in¬  vestigation of talented observers with the highest  powers of the microscope and although much is  now known on the subject it is of a nature too  abstruse to be dwelt upon in our unpretending  volume As we may well imagine the changes  are wonderful indeed which from a little drop of  fluid matter contained perhaps in a shell not  larger than a pins head end in the development  of the living and active larva who makes his  speedy escape out of his shellcradle But they  must be studied in the scientific treatises which  are written upon this subject and they are so  interesting as amply to repay the task of investi¬  gation It may be added however as a curious  fact that contrary to the general rule in the egg  of birds some of the eggs of insects actually grow  larger before they are hatched and frequently the  shape alters also  In our account of the nests made by insects  for their eggs the examples quoted although they  furnished us with many proofs of a mothers care  and forethought on the part of the insect yet there  was no instance given of anything like the solicitude displayed by the hen over her eggs Are  there then no anxious mothers concerned in the  wellbeing of their eags anions insects also In  the next chapter some instances of a mothers care  over the young larvse will be given and before  we conclude the present mention may be made of  some interesting observations upon this subject  made by the eminent naturalist M Bonnet The  insect upon which his observations were made was  the spider so commonly found on turning up a  log of wood in the fields or a clod of earth She  carries her eggs about with her in a little round  white pouch of silk attached to her body Well  has it been said Never miser clung to his  a spiders mothers love  treasure with more tenacious solicitude than this  spider to her bag Though apparently a con¬  siderable incumbrance she carries it with her  everywhere M Bonnet found that he could  not beat away the affectionate creature from her  treasure and on forcibly removing it from her she  instantly lost her ferocious aspect and became tame  In this emergency she stops to look around her  and begins to walk at a slow pace and searches dili¬  gently on every side for her lost eggs nor will she  fly if threatened by the bystander If however  out of compassion the bag is restored to her she  darts forward catches it up with all the intensity  of a mothers love and runs away with it as fast  as possible to some secret place where she may  again have the opportunity of attaching it to her  body In order to put this insects affection for  her eggs to a test M Bonnet threw a spider with  her bag into the den of a ferocious insect called  an antlion who lurks at the bottom like the  Giant in the Pilgrims Progress waiting for  poor insecttravellers to drop into the pit which  it forms and then rushing out devours them   The spider endeavoured to escape and was  eagerly remounting the side of the pit when I  again tumbled her to the bottom and the ant  lion more nimble than the first time seized the  bag of eggs with his jaws and attempted to drag  it under the sand The spider on the other hand  made the most strenuous efforts to keep her hold  and struggled hard to defeat the aim of the concealed depredator but the gum which fastened  her bag not being calculated to withstand such  violence at length gave way and the antlion was  about to carry off the prize in triumph The  spider however instantly regained it with her  jaws and redoubled her efforts to snatch the bag  from the enemy but her efforts were vain for  the antlion being the stronger succeeded in  dragging it under the sand The unfortunate  mother now robbed of her eggs might at least  have saved her own life as she could easily have  escaped out of the pitfall but wonderful to tell  she chose rather to be buried alive along with her  eggs As the sand concealed from my view what  was passing below I laid hold of the spider  leaving the bag in the power of the antlion But  the affectionate mother deprived of her bag  would not quit the spot where she had lost it  though I repeatedly pushed her with a twig Life  itself seemed to have become a burden to her  since all her hopes and pleasures were gone for  ever  As this spider may be easily found in the localities we have mentioned it may interest some  of our readers to make trial of the mothers care  for her eggs but let us hope only in a gentle  spirit Never let us be guilty of the cruelty  above narrated and leave the disconsolate mother  after her hard struggle for her treasure without  restoring it back to her Even in an insect a  mothers love so faithful selfdevoted and constant is a sacred thing and while as an illustration of the care it has pleased the Creator to  implant in it for its offspring it may be lawful to  put it to the trial it is wrong and cruel to do  more Never let us for our own amusement  give even to an insect that depth of anguish and  despair so beautifully expressed in the words of  Jacob as translated in the margin of our Bibles   And I as I am bereaved of my childrenI am  bereaved   In order to prove says the author of Insect  Architecture whether a spider of this species  could distinguish her own eggbag from that of a  stranger we interchanged the hags of two individuals which we had put under inverted wine¬  glasses but both manifested great uneasiness  and would not touch the strange bags We then  introduced one of the mothers into the glass containing her own eggs and the other spider but  even then she did not take to them which we  attributed to the presence of the other as all  spiders nourish mutual enmity Upon removing  the stranger however she showed the same in¬  difference to her eggs as before and we concluded  that after having lost sight of them for a short  time she was no longer able to recognise them  The common earwig a name at which some  who little know the beautiful traits in her character  are apt to shudder still more closely resembles the  affection of a higher animal than does the spider  just mentioned The following most interesting  notice of her proceedings was published by a  writer in the Penny Magazine some time since  He says About the end of March I found an  earwig brooding over her eggs in a small cell  scooped out in a garden border and in order to  observe her proceedings I removed the eggs into  my study placing them upon fresh earth under a  bell glass The careful mother soon scooped out  a fresh cell and collected the scattered eggs with  great care to the little nest placing herself over  themnot so much as it afterwards appeared to  keep them warm as to prevent the too rapid  evaporation of their moisture When the earth  began to dry up she dug the cell gradually deeper  till at length she got almost out of view and  whenever the interior became too dry she with¬  drew the eggs from the cell altogether and placed  them round the rim of the glass where some of  the evaporated moisture had condensed Upon  observing this I dropped some water into the  abandoned cell and the mother soon afterwards re¬  placed her eggs there When the water which had  been dropped had nearly evaporated I moistened  the outside of the earth opposite the bottom of the  cell and the mother perceiving this actually dug  a gallery right through to the spot where she found  the best supply of moisture Having neglected to  moisten the earth for some days it again became  dry and there was none even round the rim of  the odass as before Under these circumstances  the mother earwig found a little remaining moisture quite under the clod of earth upon the board  of the mantelpiece and thither she forthwith  carried her eggs The subsequent proceedings  were not less interesting for though I carefully  moistened the earth every day she regularly  changed the situation of the eggs morning and  evening placing them in the original cell at  night and on the board under the clod during the  day as if she understood the evaporation to be so  great when the sun was up that her eggs might  be left dry before night I regret to add that  during my absence the glass had been removed  and the mother escaped having carried away all  her eggs but one or two which soon shrivelled up  Our diligent little exemplars the ants are  equally careful about their eggs So soon as  they are produced the ants catch them up and  convey them to a separate chamber moisten¬  ing them with their tongues and incessantly  turning them backwards and forwards They are  the objects of constant solicitude until they are  hatched they are carried hither and thither  according as the temperature of the nest varies  On a sunny morning they are brought out and  laid to bask in the warm air but if the sky  becomes overcast and heavy clouds threaten  rain the careful nurses whip up the eggs and  hasten with them down to the deepest recesses  of the nest They even appear to imitate the  brooding of the hen and sit upon the eggs to  impart to them some of the warmth of their own  bodies  Before concluding this chapter and entering  upon the more striking manifestation of life in the  form of the insect which will next come under  our observation it will be useful just to allude to  the comparative number of eggs which some insects produce which we shall place in the form of  a table  The Noonday Fly 2  The Flea 12  May Flies 100  Silkworm Moth 500  Other Moths 1000 to 1600  Wasps 40000  Bees 50000  The most enormous number of all is produced by  the queen of the white warrior ants She deposits sixty eggs every minute which is at the  rate of 31557600 eggs in the course of a year  if we allow that she goes on laying at the same  rate constantly which is perhaps scarcely correct  Were all the eggs produced by insects to be  hatched and to bring forth living progeny we  may well ask what would become of mankind  Unquestionably in a short time their numbers  would multiply so excessively as to sweep every  green thing off the face of the earth and man and  beast would experience all the horrors of famine  But they are the sport of a thousand accidents  which destroy them and keep down the threatened  excess of population in this world of busy creatures And when the young larva has been put  forth this check upon their tendency to over multiplication is still more prominently displayed as  we may presently have occasion to remark  PART IITHE LARVA  CHAPTER I  THE YOUNG LARVA  The generality of insects as has been before  mentioned are destined never to behold the birth  of their progeny nor to experience either the  pleasures or the cares of parents surrounded by  their families Their anxieties cease when they  have carefully stored up their eggs and their exist¬  ence is generally soon afterwards at an end The  insect world therefore presents us with but few  opportunities of witnessing the display of a pa¬  rental affection on the part of its members but  as was mentioned in the conclusion of the last  chapter a few examples of the kind do exist  and perhaps the very fact of their being few in  number contributes to make them the more interesting to us We have seen a noble instance of  selfdevotion on the part of a poor spider in defence  of her eggs Let us now turn to some examples  of the love of an insect mother for her young  larva If the reader will carefully search the  twins and leaves of the birchtree in the month of  July he may possibly succeed in finding the little  insect the fieldbug of which mention is about  being made and witness for himself the strange  spectacle described in the following account from  the great work on insects by De Geer In order  that it may be recognised we have  here adjoined a representation of  the insect Its colour is a greenish  gray on the back dotted all over  with very minute black spots the  under portion of the insect is  greenish yellow with black spots  It lives upon the sap of the birch  The Fieldbug tree   The mother says De Geer was accompanied by a troop of little ones sometimes as many  as forty in number She remained constantly  with them generally on a twig or leaf I noticed  that the little ones and their mother did not always  remain in the same place and that as soon as the  mother began to move to another position all the  little ones began to run after her and stopped  whenever the mother halted She used to take  them as it were for a walk from twig to twig or  from one leaf to another parading up and down  the branches of the tree and she conducted them  wherever she pleased just as a hen does her  chickens It frequently afforded me great pleasure  to observe their movements One day I cut a  young branch of the birchtree inhabited by such  an insect family and I immediately saw the  mother apparently in great anxiety begin to flap  her wings violently but without attempting to fly  away as though she would frighten away her  enemy At another time she would have imme¬  diately made her escape thus plainly showing that  she remained only in order to defend her young  brood  As if to furnish an instance of precisely the  opposite import the cruel and murderous father of  this interesting little family is one of the greatest  enemies the poor mother has to contend against  This hardhearted parent does not hesitate when¬  ever he falls in with one of his children to seize  him and eat him up If the mother spies him at  this horrible feast she immediately attacks him in  the manner described and does her utmost to deter  him from his cannibal propensities by placing  herself in an attitude of determined resistance  before him Was ever mothers love more plainly  manifested than this love No other instance of  an affection so strange and strong is to be found in  the tribe to which she belongs  The care of the earwig not only extends to  her eggs but also to her young larvae In the  beginning of June writes the author last quoted   I found under a stone a female earwig sur¬  rounded by a number of little creatures which I  discovered to be her tiny family She did not  attempt to leave them and they frequently ran  and crouched under her just as chickens under the  wing of a hen I took them up and placed them  under a sandglass under which I had put a little  fresh earth They did not bore into the earth  and it was most curious to see them running for  shelter under the mother and pushing about  between her feet while she remained perfectly  quiet I fed them with pieces of ripe apple  which the mother seized and ate with great avidity  detaching morsels of it by means of her teeth and  swallowing them The young ones also ate a  little of it but with less avidity  When the eggs of the spider mentioned in the  last chapter as so devotedly attached to its trea¬  sure as to prefer death to parting with them are  hatched they make their way out of the bag by an  opening in it being assisted by the mother in this  difficult task De Geer indeed states that this is  the reason why the mother clings so tenaciously to  the bas of egos as if she knew that her assistance  in extricating her young from it was necessary  But this is not altogether correct as they are able  to make their way out by themselves in due time  When the young larvae have come forth from the  shell they run towards the mother and climb upon  her body some get on her head some on her  back and some on her limbs In this manner she  carries them about and is said to feed them until  they become strong enough to shift for themselves   I have more than once been gratified writes  one of the authors of the Introduction to Ento¬  mology by a sight of this interesting spectacle  and when I nearly touched the mother thus  covered by hundreds of progeny it was most  amusing to see them all leap from her back and  run away in all directions  For another instance of affection almost maternal for the young and helpless larvae let us take a  peep into an ants nest So soon as ever the young  larvae emerge from the eggs they require the unremitting attention of the best and most careful  nurses in order to rear them They must be kept  clean fed and taken lor an airing as regularly as  the day returns By means of their tongues which  are incessantly used in licking them their coats  are kept of the most snowy white They are fed  three or four times a day by their nurses who take  care to masticate the food for them and thus pre¬  pare it for their tender mouths But the most  strange part is their regularly being taken out for  the benefit of the air and warmth Some of the ants  at the top of the nest watch for the first beams of  the welcome sun and as soon as they pour upon  the nest they hasten down below in a great bustle  to wake up the nurses and bid them take the  young ones out of their chambers and bring them  up to the light which these indefatigable ants  quickly set about to do After basking there all  day long the nurses take care not to expose the  delicate constitutions of the larvae to the chill  evening air and soon as the sun begins to sink  towards the horizon they carefully take them up  and carry them to the warm deep cell below  For fear perhaps of their taking cold they never  allow them to be taken out in raw damp or frosty  weather It must not be forgotten however that  these ants are not the parents of the larvte they  are only the nurses  But it becomes us now to pursue the more  immediate subject of these remarks and ask the  readers attention to a few particulars about the  larva It is a great pity for the sake of a clear per¬  ception of the facts of insect history that there is  a sad confusion of names in use among the majority  of persons in speaking of the different forms and  changes of insects Who would imagine that  caterpillar grub maggot and larva signified one  and the same stage of the life of an insect  This abuse of terms cannot but render the know¬  ledge of any science less easily retained than it  would otherwise be for the question is continually  arising in the mindIf these all mean the same  why is not one term enough to express them  Let us then renounce those of uncertain meaning  and when we wish to give a name to the insect  just emerged from its eggshell let us call it by  its proper name the Larva The larva then is the first form assumed by  the insect on quitting its shell No more a little  inactive object lies before us as in the egg and its  slumbering tenant but a sharp fellow full of life  and soon walking off the field of the microscope  should we happen to be looking at it in that way  or from our book or table should it be there placed  by us for observation By what hidden and mysterious power this has been effected who can tell  It was not heat alone that could animate the contents of the shell nor could all a mothers care do  more than preserve it from injury It is very  possible that chemistry had some share in it and  when the tiny being first awoke in the shell the  The definition of the words Caterpillar Grub Maggot as  popularly understood is as follows  A Caterpillar is the larva of a butterfly moth or sawfly  often hairy and always provided with a larger or smaller number  of legs  A Grub is the larva of a beetle having six feet and a smooth  body  A Maggot is the larva of a bee wasp or fly and has no legs  oxygen of the air undoubtedly was necessary to its  health and the fulfilment of its early functions  but no more Not chemistry nor electricity nor  heat nor any other known force could effect this  wonderful change of apparently inanimate fluid  into a lively active and wellorganized being  much less could either of these give it its definite  form causing one larva to differ from another  in its characters No we cannot tell how it has  taken place nor what has wrought the change  but we know the author of iteven Him who  from the beginning created all things and established those principles which though hidden  from our eyes work out the marvels of the  created world It is enough for us to know and  to remember this Should we attempt more we  should probably fall under the Scripture reproof   Professing themselves to be wise they became  fools  Speaking generally insects in the larva form  appear as fleshy worms having long and round  bodies marked with rings and provided with a  head and a certain number of legs mostly six  How different in this condition from the ball¬  room gaiety of the butterfly or the elegant robes  of the lacewins flies To look at a number of  larvae all crawling over one another and bearing  perhaps not the most loving behaviour to each  other as they scramble about who would dream  that in a little while those slowly moving  bodies will be whirled through the air faster  than our feet can pursue or even than the eye  can follow Who also but one well versed in  the knowledge of insects could venture to say  what insect could be formed by this or that  larva now so little resembling winged insects at  all  In studying the forms and appearances of  various larvse we shall find that some of them bear  a tolerably close resemblance to the future insect  Larvce unlike the future Insects  Larvce like the future Insects  while others on the contrary do not resemble  their future condition at all and had we to decide  to what tribe of insects they belonged merely  judging by their shape and character we should  be sorely perplexed to do so and if we did we  should often in all probability be very far wrong  We need not go far for an illustration first of a  larva like the perfect insect and next for one  totally unlike it Taking a candle and exploring  into some snug hole near the kitchen fireplace we  shall not be long probably before we extricate a  number of the larvas of the cricket Those of the  bug also are very like the perfect insect so also  are young spiders cockroaches and grasshoppers  These all resemble more or less perfectly the in¬  sect in its complete form  Even amongst the larvae not resembling the  perfect insect a little attention will enable us to  perceive a sort of general resemblance between  those of different genera and species which we  may call the Larva family likeness This consists  in the form of the body in a number of instances  but in all in the ringlike marks or segments of  the body as they are called which are thirteen in  number If the reader will take the trouble to  count the rings in the larva of different insects he  will generally find that they are thirteen in number The general resemblance of larvae to one  another may also be noticed The larva is in  every instance destitute of  wings In many cases larvae  are provided with feet in  many others they have none  And in some instances  they have no distinct head  as in the larva of the blow  fly  By far the larger number of larvae belong to this  class that is they do not  resemble the perfect insect  Do not resemble could  any one believe that these  strange and some of them  awful looking larvae ever  Larvce of Butterflies  became butterflies yet they all belong to that  tribe of insects  In order to give a clear conception of the  structure of a larva we may briefly mention the  names of its various parts First then there is  a head of various shapes sometimes of the shape  of a heart sometimes round or triangular At¬  tached to the head are the two antennas or as  they are commonly called feelers most probably  an incorrect expression as it appears that insects  may possibly hear as well as feel by their means  At the side of the head are the  eyes which are formed much more  simply than those of the per¬  fect insect Next is the mouth  provided with its upper and lower  pair of jaws Then there is the  body and its legs and lastly there  is in many larvte living in the  water a tail which strange to  say is provided with a delicate  tube through which the larva  breathes A beautiful instance of  such an appendage to the body  of the larva is represented in the adjoining cut  Diagram of a Larva  the various parts of the larva are  also represented in the accompany¬  ing figure  We may now enter upon a few  particulars connected with the ge¬  neral history of insects in the larva  form  CHAPTEE II  HABITS OF THE LARVA  Generally for a little while after the larva  has emerged from the shell it is in a very weak  and languid condition The effort of extricating  itself from its little prisonhouse seems to leave  it almost without strength and for a period  which varies in different insects it lies help¬  less and almost motionless at the mercy of any  wandering adversary and might be demolished  without resistance But this hour of weakness  except in a few cases is not prolonged In the  course of an hour or two or even much less in  some instances the larva revives takes heart and  begins by eating whatever food may happen to  lie in its way and now the larva becomes a  terror to the world of insects or even indirectly  to man and to nations Instead of simply eating  in order to live like most other beings it only lives  to eat it has no other duty to perform at present  but to eat as fast and as much as it possibly can  in a certain time and it must be confessed the  larva generally speaking leaves little to be de¬  sired on the score of a sharp appetite Unlike  other creatures who allow themselves a certain  period between their meals the larva sets to its  feast and does not leave the table until it has  devoured all its contentsupon which it immediately begins again elsewhere No gourmand in  the world whether among human beings or brutes  can compare with the insect in this form for the  amount of food consumed Morning noon and  night is to it only a continued round of feasting  and as may well be imagined the larva grows  very rapidly accordingly Some larvae consume  animal others vegetable food or in the language  of science some are carnivorous some are graminivorous or herbivorous and some will eat anything  almost that comes before themthese would be  called and very appropriately so omnivorous  Let us speak of carnivorous larvie first The  larvse which have carnivorous propensities render  themselves often truly terrible to the insect world  around them The most mighty warrior that ever  lived in his whole career never slew half so many  of his own species as the larva of a beautiful fly  does of aphides in a few hours Well does Reaumur  call them the lions of the aphides and thus does  he describe their method of proceeding   There is no beast of prey in nature who hunts  so entirely at his ease as does this larva Resting  upon a twig or a leaf he is surrounded on every  side by the insects on which he feeds often  indeed they touch his sides and he is able to catch  hundreds of them without changing his position  Not only do the poor little aphides not fly from  him but they may be often seen creeping over  the body of their enemy It is only after the  larva has eaten up the greater number of his prey  around him that he has any need to remove to a  spot as thickly inhabited by them as that in which  he has been making his cruel ravages In order  to observe the manner in which he attacks them  the best plan is to take him put him between  two leaves and shut him up in a box for ten or  twelve hours to sharpen his appetite After this  fast he must be placed on some spot where the  aphides are found in abundance Immediately he  begins exploring around for prey which he does  simply by the sense of touch as he does not appear  to be able to see At length an unhappy insect  conies within his reach  Brandishing a trident with  which he is armed he im¬  mediately transfixes the  insect just as we take up  a morsel of food upon a  fork The little creature  is then sucked into a sort  of cavity like the neck of  a bottle where it is retained by a couple of  pins until its juices are  uon of the Aphides emptied by the destroyer  when he casts it away now nothing more of it  being left but a dry shrivelled empty skin The  aphislion however loses no time and presently  seizes another which he pierces and sucks dry as  quickly as the last When very hungry he will  devour one a minute Reaumur says I have  seen him eat twenty of these insects one after   One of these insects which fell under the writers notice  pierced and sucked dry aphides of several different species quite  indifferently  another in twenty minutes nor did this satisfy  him for in the course of two hours he devoured  more than a hundred insects with which I sup¬  plied him These larvae do repose a little but  never for long for they are seldom without some  prey in hand I have seen adds the last author   twigs of the elder seven or eight inches in length  entirely covered with these insects the aphides  and in four days time there remained not one  alive  This larva is a rare specimen of courage as  well as of destructive powers for when it is quite  young it often seizes upon an insect twice as big as  itself It is very amusing to see the unequal con¬  test between the little but courageous foe and his  great bulky and stupid adversary Immediately  the larva thrusts its trident into the body of the  enemy who stupid as he is does not like the  sensation of the wound in his side and makes off  as fast as he can The lionhearted larva follows  him up and wrestles with him and at length actually boards him to use a sailors term clambering up his sides and in triumph piercing him  through and slaying him What is perhaps most  singular of all the larvae of some species of these  flies not only slay their victims but actually clothe  themselves after the manner of Hercules on his  victory over the Nemaean lion with the skins of  their prey   It is almost to be regretted that the insect  world has not had the privilege of having its  combats sung by the poets Who can forget the  animated scenes painted in such lifelike colours  by Homer and Virgil of the conflicts hand to  hand of the heroes of their verse But the history  of insects supplies us with more singular and  more interesting deeds of fight than have ever yet  been fabled by poets or commemorated in song  In the instance we are about to quote the larva of  the antlion is the crafty Giant Grim who lives by  entrapping as we have before said poor wayfaring  travellers Like those giants of old of whom we  read in books a little more wonderful than true this  subtle and powerful enemy lies deeply ensconced  in his subterraneous cavern patiently abiding the  time when his unsuspecting prey shall fall into his  power His trap is depicted on the opposite page  This insect is naturally a very helpless being it  can only walk at a slow pace and strange to add  it can only walk backwards and not forwards  Yet its food is the juice of insect bodies How  then is it to seize upon them circumstanced so  unfavourably as it is having neither swiftness nor  ability to direct its motions sufficiently actively to  An Antlion in its Trap  fit it for such a task It succeeds by an artifice of  the most refined character Nothing daunted by  what we might call its natural disadvantages the  insect sets bravely to work to construct a trap for its  prey and the manner in which this is performed  may well strike us with wonder and raise our  admiration up to Him who has so marvellously  endowed this humble being with wisdom and skill  It first takes care to choose out a proper site for  the work it is about and in this always selects a  soil composed of fine loose and dry sand well aware  that as we shall presently see no other would be  fit for its purpose Generally it chooses such a soil  under the shelter of an old wall where the rain  cannot easily penetrate and ruin its work In so  doing it shows its wisdom for thither when the  heat of the sun is great or when the raindrops fall  heavily crowds of insects come for shelter and  fall into its cruel embrace  The site being chosen the next important step  is to mark out the bounds of its habitation and  with this view the insect begins digging a circular  ditch walking backwards until it has completed  the circle This defines the outer limits of its  Circular Ditch of the Antlion  trap and is a sort of guide line to it in its future  operations Then it sets about the more proper  task of excavating its trap Would that our readers  could see this insect at work Of all the wonderful sights presented to us in the insect world there  is none to equal it in interest none so calculated  to enlist our sympathies on the part of the patient  skilful and unwearied little labourers of this  kingdom of nature Guided by the line it has  marked out the workman steps into the circle  and sets to work with a hearty good will and  with a degree of diligence and excavating skill  that would put our railroad navigators to the  blush Shower after shower of sand is seen flying  up and beyond the boundary described with the  most unintermitting diligence until the insect has  completed the circle again arrived there it turns  round and excavates back again until it arrives at  the same point But it may perhaps be asked  where are its tools and by what means does it  succeed in casting up these loads of earth We  fear that at best any written description will  hardly do justice to our ingenious labourer its  method however is as followsIt uses the head  as the spade or rather shovel and in the strangest  manner it fills the shovel with one of its feet with  a load of sand and then by a quick movement of  the head tosses it out of the cavity By working  in alternate directions it manages so as never to  overfatigue one leg for on its return the leg  previously in use is at rest while the one on the  opposite side is now called into duty The insect  thus works on until its trap is completely exca¬  vated the task occupying a variable time some¬  times being finished in half an hour sometimes  even in less but occasionally occupying several  hours the little labourer being obliged to rest a  certain time Reaumur who has given a fasci¬  nating account of these insects writes I have  had at times hundreds of antlions in a large box  and I have often been amused with filling up their  traps Some of them would immediately begin  to form another but the greater number in the  warm long days of summer deferred executing the  work until the sun began to go down They  seldom worked in the heat of the day but in cold  or cloudy weather they would excavate at any  hour  We well know what perplexity a chain of rocky  hills causes to a railroad engineer and what vast  outlays of money labour and time are necessary  in order to overcome the obstacle thus presented  to the path of the engine and its train But it  may be safely said that we can furnish a parallel instance of difficulty and of patient allsurmounting  exertion from the history of the insect before us  M Bonnet was curious to know what it would do  if a stone or some such obstacle were met with  in the process of its excavations and one day had  the gratification of observing the behaviour of the  insect under these trying circumstances Not  being able to cast it out with its head the insect  determined to carry it out if possible on its back  With this view it contrived by various manoeuvres  to place the stone upon its back and to balance it  there This was the least difficult part of the undertaking The insect had to climb up an inclined  plane upon soil chosen with other views purposely  by itself as shifting and unsteady as possible and  not only so but to preserve the balance of the stone  with which it was encumbered Undaunted by  these difficulties it made the attempt but the first  step brought down a shower of sand and tumbled  the little rock to the bottom Again and again did  the heroic insect attempt the same feat and with the  same ill success and we might have thought we  beheld a realization of the fable of Sisyphus and  the rollingstone in the vain endeavours of the  insect to get rid of its encumbrance Five or six  times did the insect repeat its endeavours and at  last after one or two narrow escapes the stone  was fairly lodged on the outside of the trap and  the insect returned to its subterraneous recess at  the bottom of the cell in triumph  The traps vary in size in proportion to the age  of the insects which construct them The young  insects only form very small ones but as even  from the moment of their birth they are destined  to toil for their food they do not wait in idleness  and hunger because they cannot make large efforts  but are content to make little traps not more than  a few parts of an inch in diameter Thus they set  us the needful example of not despising to do  small things because our strength is not yet equal  to the performance of as much as we could  desire The diameter of the trap formed by a full  grown insect is about three inches the depth  about two  When its labours are over it has been well  remarked the insect now only requires patience  but it must have a good deal of it It generally  buries itself all but its jaws in the sand at the bot¬  tom and here awaits its victims If it requires much  patience surely it also needs to have much power  of endurance of hunger for it may wait for days  sometimes without catching any prey Frequently  when this is the case it marches out of its trap  and tries its fortune in some more favourable spot  But see an ant who has been out foraging for  the young ants at home is hastening back laden  with sweet treasures when suddenly she finds her  path arrested by what appears to her to be a deep  but smooth precipice To plunge down and rise  on the opposite side is a shorter cut in her estimation than to go round or perhaps she is led by  curiosity to wish to explore this singular cavity  and she plants her feet on its treacherous edge  causing a few grains of sand to roll down and give  notice to the wary giant below that a victim is at  hand A step back and her life would be saved  but no she leaves the bank trusts herself to the  unfaithful soil of the sides of the precipice and instantly rolls down in a cloud of dust to the bottom  Terror has now laid hold of her and with all speed  she strives to clamber up the unsteady sides For  a moment escape appears possible but the Argus  eyed monster below starts up into activity and  piling upon his head a huge load of sand he shoots  it after the escaping ant and once more brings her  down covered with dust into his embrace The  terrible jaws are instantly closed upon the un¬  happy insect and in a few minutes her existence  is at an end the savage enemy shaking her  violently or dashing her quivering frame against  the earth  Singular to add the antlion loves not dead  prey and will indignantly cast it out of its trap  Says Reaumur They appear so much to delight  in the glory of a victory that they disdain to touch  an insect who is not to say the least in a condition to contend with them It certainly is not  that the food when offered to it dead is not fresh  enough that it is thus treated for if only killed  an instant before the insect still refuses to touch  it Reaumur is disposed to believe that like our  sportsmen these interesting but cruel insects  destroy prey more for the pleasure of exhibiting  their superior skill than to appease their hunger  But it is rather uncharitable even to the antlion  to say so much as this When the insect has  sucked all the juices out of its victims body it  casts it out of its trap and the earth around strewed  with dead bodies is thus the silent witness to the  destroying powers of the giant within  This singular insect whose exploits have detained us so long remains in its larva form two  years growing daily in size until it has completed  its existence as a larva and must then enter upon  another condition of life It is to be regretted  that it is not to be found in England or at least  it has not been for some time discovered in our  island but it is common in France and other  parts of the continent and would well repay the  trouble of being brought over As the insect is  very patient of hunger it might easily be conveyed  in a little wooden box half filled with fine sand  and its proceedings could be readily watched by  placing it under a bellglass or in a little glass  case introducing a few ants or spiders for its food  from time to time  The insect exhibits to us a wonderful instance  of what we may call after the example of Dr  Paley the principle of compensation in nature  It can neither run nor fly with the speed necessary to overtake its prey who are swifter of  foot than itself But God never created it to  starve and has endowed it with a rare combination of faculties by which it is enabled to live  in the midst of plenty if not even of luxuriance  So it is in a thousand other cases in nature So  it is indeed in Providence likewise If He sends  us trials He also makes a way to escape that  we may be able to bear them If our day is to  be dark and cloudy and to call for the exercise of  much faith and patience there is still the same  provision made as thy day so shall thy strength  be If our lot in life is one of hardship He can  and if it is sought of him aright He will and He  does bear us up revive our drooping strength  and enable us to go on our way rejoicing  Let us go on to speak now of some other carnivorous larva If in the month of July we can  find out a spot where we can detect the traces of  the labours of the sandwasp of whom mention has  been made at page 15 and cutting out a little mass  of the sand rock containing several of their bur¬  rows then take the trouble to open gently one of  the cells formed by these insects we shall see a  carnivorous larva in as happy a condition as a fox  in a henroost or a mouse in the midst of a cheese  The best way to obtain access to this securely  imbedded and luxurious larva is to moisten the  mass of sand with a little water and then slice it  gently down with an old knife until we come to  the cells They are here represented At the  bottom of each we shall see the larvae which have  sprung from the eggs deposited in the manner be¬  fore described after the arduous and affectionate  labours of the parent Then above each is a heap of  caterpillars arranged  with beautiful neat¬  ness and larvae and  caterpillars are both  fast locked in their  prison house by the  firm stopping with  which the parent  wasp has closed the  mouth of the cells  These caterpillars are  all alive and are  rolled into a ringlike  form but are so  chained down that c e iu of sndwa ip  they cannot move in the least degree The poor  prisoners like the sheep in the slaughteryard are  only waiting their turn to be killed and devoured  The larva soon after it is hatched finds himself in  the midst of a wellstored larder and has nothing  to do but eat which he does not long delay doing  He devours at his ease and revels in the dainty  fresh food which the care of his parent had laid  up When he has eaten all his prisoners up  and grown to his full size he lays down to sleep  to awake again in another and a far different  form  Sometimes the reader may have the opportunity  it may be of finding out the nest of the wood¬  boring wasp and he may in June or July perhaps  succeed in discovering another instance of a larva  in a happy state of plenty  The larva is sure to be  found at the bottom and  above it will be piled a  heap of insects for its food  What is remarkable about  this store of food is that  the insects thus made  prisoners are not dead for  they would if so soon  become corrupted and  unfit for the diet of the  larva they are in a sort  Larva of Woodboring Wasp °f Mf Stupified Condition in all probability very like that induced by  the late plan of breathing ether and other vapours  to render persons insensible to pain while surgically operated on Since this plan has been introduced we read in some of the newspaperswe  may question with what truththat the butchers  in Albany America give ether to the oxen  before killing them so as to make them insensible  to the pain of the deathblow But the wasps in  question have for ages been in the habit of effecting  the same end by stinging their captives the poison  not sufficing to kill them nor yet permitting them  to be actively alive  The insects thus stored up for the larva cost  the parent many a conflict in their capture And  here we may interest the reader by describing the  exploits of a warrior wasp abundant in the Isle of  France It is curious that in the Isle of France  the common bee is not to be found as a native of  the woods while in the Isle of Bourbon it is very  common and furnishes an abundance of wax and  honey This is explained by supposing that the  warriors of whom we are about to speak destroy  the bees and have thus prevented their multiplying in the island in question Truly like the  banditti of whom we read in books these wasps  are splendidly attired although not in the spoils of  those they have robbed Their head chest and  body is of a resplendent lustre now green or  seen in another position blue and glistening with  all the lustre of an exquisite varnish their antenme are black their eyes of a brownish yellow  and their legs partly bronzecoloured and partly  of a beautiful violet They are strong and swift  of wing and are possessed of a terrible lance the  thrusts of which even man cannot endure without  far more pain and inflammation than attends an  ordinary sting  The foe with whom these magnificentlydressed  warriors have to contend is a kind of insect  allied to the cockroach which in our kitchens has  acquired the incorrect title of black beetle  This insect is detested by the inhabitants of the  island for its ravages upon almost everything of  value or delicacy and is not less hated by the  sailor for its destructiveness on shipboard It  is called Kakerlac and is much larger than the  cockroaches which are the plague and terror of  our cooks Imagine that one of these great and  odious insects is marching along the highway  The warrior wasp has also been making his  expeditions for prey abroad when suddenly his  eager eye catches sight of the kakerlac hastening  to some new scene of depredation The warrior  instantly alights and the kakerlac stops think¬  ing perhaps to intimidate its adversary by its size  and ferocious aspect Both insects glare at one  another   each other from afar  They view and rushing on begin the war  They launch their spears then hand to hand they meet  The trembling soil resounds beneath their feet  Their bucklers clash thick blows descend from high  And flashes of fire from their hard helmets fly  Courage conspires with chance and both engage  With equal fortune yet and mutual rage  Virgils description though scarcely accurate in  all points gives us a lively image of this insect  combat The kakerlac however is the Turn us  and the warrior wasp the Hmeas of the fight The  wasp is the first to attack and darts upon the  other seizing it by the muzzle with its strong  jaws then bending its body so as to bring its tail  under the abdomen of the kakerlac the lance  with its charge of poison is deepplunged into the  body of the unhappy foe imbuing a deadly venom  into its system Having made this thrust the  warrior looses the foe and soars in triumph a  little way into the air satisfied of a successful  issue  The wretched kakerlac after a few brief convulsions lies paralysed on the ground unable to  stir a step from the spot where it encountered  its terrible adversary Fully aware of this the  victorious wasp after taking a few turns as if to  proclaim the downfal of the Giant Kakerlac to  the surrounding neighbourhood returns to the  scene where the conflict was fought The kakerlac unable to resist the victor and being naturally though a great devourer a very fainthearted  creature lies immovable while the wasp seizes  the prostrate foe by the head and in a sort of  triumphal march drags it along the road to its  nest But though the kakerlac was not a difficult enemy to overcome the weight and size of  its body are a sore burden to the victor wasp  The way to the nest is long tedious and rugged  After a hard pull over all sorts of obstacles  the wasp becomes completely breathless and is  obliged to let go and for a rest it generally rises  into the air probably with a view of reconnoitring  future difficulties and of ascertaining the best  route to pursue Thus after alternately dragging  along the body of its victim and rising up to spy  out the path at length the conqueror succeeds in  bringing the carcase home  Here however arises another difficulty To  attempt to get the body of the huge kakerlac  in is just as if one were to attempt to get an  elephant through a small streetdoor What is to  be done The wasp enters the hole backwards  and seizing the head of the kakerlac endeavours  with all its might to drag it in but all in vain  Many times it repeats these efforts with the same  want of success and now it appears that its  labours in bringing hither the corpse and its  dangers in the battle were all for nought for the  great body cannot be put in the place the wasp  had designed for it As if exasperated with the  difficulties out comes the wasp in fury and fall¬  ing upon the body of the kakerlac hews off the  large wingcases together with several of the  limbs and goes back into the hole again to repeat  the attempt to get it in Success at length crowns  its efforts by little and little the body becomes  lost to sight and finally disappears altogether  from view being carried down to the very bottom  of the nest Here the larva as soon as hatched  feeds upon it thrives and grows and falls asleep  awaiting the time when itself shall awake to  follow in the steps of the glittering and formidable  warrior who with the boldness of an amazon and  affection of the tenderest of mothers supplied it  with nourishment during its hours of infancy  This may be thought a scene of sad carnage  but the following will perhaps appear even more  so What should we say if deep in the forests of  some wild uncultivated country was found a den  the bottom of which was strewed with skulls with  bones and mangled limbs What fearful scenes  should we not suspect to have taken place in this  dark and horrid place and as we shuddered in  looking round upon its walls as the once witnesses  of terrible deeds we might even fancy we heard  the cry of the poor traveller whose last agonies  were seen by no eye but that of the monster who  had waylaid and murdered him Such a den may  be found in the forest made horrible by the cutoff  heads limbs and wings of insectsit is the habita¬  tion of the carnivorous larva of a wasp Nay more  as is seen in the engraving the insect monster  actually works up the cutoff wings and limbs into  a sort of covering for itself and finally buries  itself in a shroud partly made of  the spoils of former victims  Perhaps the carnivorous larva   t The Larva of a Wasp in its  of the tigerbeetle or cicindela coat of wings and limbs  is as ferocious a being as any in this state  In this respect indeed it resembles the perfect  insect whose title sufficiently indicates its swift¬  ness cunning and bloodthirsty nature £ These  larvae writes Mr Westwood burrow cylindric  retreats in the earth to the depth of a foot or  more employing their legs and jaws in loosen¬  ing the particles of sand and earth which they  carry to the surface upon their broad saucer¬  like head ascending by the assistance of the two  hooks upon the back somewhat after the fashion  of a sweep going up a chimney Having com¬  pleted this burrow they station themselves by  means of their legs and back hooks at its mouth  their large flattened head and great segment  filling the hole Here they remain all day long  and many an insect might pass close by little  dreaming of the terrible foe who lay under that  trapdoor Presently comes a spider scrambling  over the ground in haste to mount up a branch  on which to hang one of its web lines the  treacherous trapdoor is in its direct path Its  feet rest on it instantly the trap drops and the  poor insect falls into the dark den and is caught  in the powerful jaws of the artful larva Truly  there is something even to man a little intimidating in the sight of such a monster as is represented here how much more  to the unfortunate insect who  happens to be caught in its  embrace and having only time  to just catch a glimpse of its  fearful captor is dragged down in a cloud of dust  to be devoured in darkness at the bottom of the den  Yet this also like other cruel creatures is in reality  a very timid larva and instantly on the approach of  danger drops to the bottom of the cell where if  we have courage to pursue it we shall find it much  in the attitude in which it is here represented  The singular pair of hooks on its back are used as  the flukes of an anchor to sustain the insect in  the position it assumes at the mouth of the cell  Mention has already been made in the previous  chapter of the insects called Ichneumons which  deposit their eggs in the bodies of the larvae of  other insects These when hatched are also to  be reckoned among the larvae which prey upon  flesh since they devour the bodies of the larvae in  which they have been deposited They are thus  most useful to mankind in destroying the devourers  of his vegetable food  We may now see an instance yet more strange of  a carnivorous larva We must wend our way to the  riverside in the months of May or June There  after a diligent search at the bottom in some  moderately shallow portion of  the stream shall we find a  larva the study of which might  well occupy us for many pages  Yet it is the larva of an in¬  sect well known to every  angler and brook side wanderer the dragonfly This  larva is provided with one of  the most remarkable contrivances for seizing its prey and   i p Larva of the DrasonJtij  conveying it to its mouth to  any being in the zoological kingdom By the  assistance of the engraving we may perhaps be  able to render this apparatus which is somewhat  complicated intelligible to the reader Looking  at the larvas head we are reminded somewhat of  The Mask partly open The same partly closed  that of a horse who has got blinders over his eyes  and a nosebag over his nose and partly up his  cheeks Now suppose the two blinders thrown  back on each side then conceive that the lower  part of the face which we have supposed covered  with a nosebag were to be uncovered we should  then see the following curious contrivance The  lower lip of this larva is lengthened downwards  into a sort of arm if we may so speak at what  we may call the elbow is a joint connecting the  upper and lower portions of it and the place of  the hand is occupied by two cross plates with a  claw at the end of each Suppose an unhappy  insect or even a tadpole swims carelessly by the  larva immediately the two sides of the mask or  blinders as we have called them fly open the  arm is uncovered the forearm let down and by  means of the plates which we have compared to  the hand the victim is caught and bending the  arm back is presented to the mouth of the larva  There is much similarity in this organ with the  wonderful apparatus of the elephant called its  trunk but of the two the trunk of this insect is  the most beautiful piece of animal mechanism  When the prey has  been devoured the  arm folds up covers the mouth and  part of the face of  the insect and the  blinders or two  side pieces of the  mask fall in and lock together in a toothed  manner as the engraving in the last page shows  Thus provided the larva is a formidable creature to the inhabitants of the pond or brook few  indeed more so It preys with incessant activity  on all aquatic insects that happen to come in its  way and sometimes as we have said even upon  tadpoles They do not even spare one another and  woe to the unhappy relative of the family who  happens to wander near the abode of another of the  The apparatus in the act of seising  same family anxious to begin his feasting for the  day So ferocious are they that they even attack  small fish and make little work of swallowing them  up Not only are these creatures fierce but they  also possess all the cunning of a tiger or a cat To  watch them seize their prey is an interesting occupation and as the larvae are common enough and  may be easily recognised by comparing them with  the accompanying cut we may venture to recommend the amusement of observing their proceedings  to the reader A little way off lies an unsuspecting insect delighting in the warm sunshine  and securely floating upon the waters on the corner  of a leaf Such an idea as danger at hand is pro¬  bably the very last from its conceptions and  pluming its bright and glossy wings it beguiles  away the sunny hour unmolested by a passing  enemy or a breath of air The larva has marked  it already for its own See it rouse itself up and  noiselessly make ready to pounce upon the unsus¬  pecting lounger It creeps stealthily along con¬  cealing itself from view as far as possible and not  even the telltale glassy surface of the water feels  its movements Measuring its distance well the  larva prepares to seize its prey in a moment  swifter than the eye can follow the victim is  caught by the apparatus we have described and  in another instant is in all the agonies of a violent  death in the mouth of the larva So exceedingly  cautious are these larvae in their movements and  so expert and active in darting upon their prey  that it scarcely ever escapes their power  Having mentioned these particulars about car¬  nivorous larvae let us consider some circumstances  connected with those larvae that are vegetable  feedersgraminivorous or herbivorous Of these  we could scarcely select a more destructive one  than the larva of an insect well known to every  schoolboy from the times of Greece and Rome  down to our ownthe common cockchafer melo  lontha vulgaris Our schoolboys however are less  merciful than those of Greece for they only tied a  string round the leg of the unhappy cockchafer  while these thrust a pin through its tail Yet its  terrible ravages considered the insect little de¬  serves to be pitied but Ave are not therefore to  be understood as by any means sanctioning the  cruel and inhuman sport alluded to These larva  are hatched in a sort of little cavern dug by the  parent insects care under the ground in our mea¬  dows or cornfields Here they begin their  ravages bv devouring the roots of the grasses  which surround them on all sides In this manner  they A r ery quickly destroy the plants which wither  and die in a manner quite mysterious to the agri¬  culturist if he does not happen to think of these  insects The turf soon becomes so completely  undermined by these excavators that it may be  rolled off as smooth as if a knife had been used  underneath to cut off all its connexions with the  ground In a few weeks meadows which shone  in all the fresh and luxuriant green raiment of  Spring change colour and before Summer has yet  come and before the stalks of the grass are yet  grown up one would think Autumn had passed  over the face of the field from its dry and dead  aspect About seventy years ago we are told  these larvce did so much injury to a poor farmers  fields near Norwich that the court of that city out  of compassion presented him with twentyfive  pounds Some idea of their numbers on this  farmers property may be formed from the fact  that the farmer and his servant declared with  very long faces we may be sure that they had  gathered eighty bushels of them Sometimes  they even attack the roots of young trees and in  this manner do an incalculable amount of mischief  to plantations They were at one time so abun¬  dant in France and did such immense mischief  that the Government in order to get rid of them  offered a handsome reward for the best method of  destroying them A number of experiments were  made and it really seemed as if nothing would  kill these larvae in the way of poison at least for  several poisons which are rapidly fatal to man and  animals failed to produce the least effect on them  It was found however at last that a solution of  alkalies such as potash and soda were certain  poisons to them and should land be much infested  with them it would be worth the trial to water it  with such solutions especially as they tend rather  to enrich the soil than otherwise A French  manufacturer determining to turn the visitation  of these insects to good account lias succeeded in  distilling an excellent lampoil from their bodies  and offers tenpence a bushel for them From  seventeen bushels he extracted twentyeight quarts  of good oil In Hungary a kind of grease is  obtained from them which is useful for carriage  wheels The ingenuity of man may thus even  procure good out of a very formidable evil  although the mischief done by the cockchafer  larva undoubtedly far exceeds the benefit it con¬  fers upon its captors in the amount of oil extracted  from it  An insect almost equally familiar to all persons  is the longlegged gnat of whom the famous  childrens rhyme runs   Old father longlegs would not say his prayers  Take him by the left leg and throw him down stairs  Many of our farmers would be glad no doubt  if taking him by the left leg would keep him out  of their meadows for there this insect commits  fearful ravages in the larva form In some parts  of England it has as completely destroyed the  pasturegrass as if it had been consumed by fire  In the spring of 1813 hundreds of acres of  pasture in the rich district of Sunk Island in Hoiderness were entirely destroyed by it being  rendered as completely brown as if they had suffered a three months drought and no other vegetation but that of a few thistles was left on land  which at more favoured periods was more than  commonly luxuriant On a square foot of the turf  being dug up from the affected spot the enormous  number of two hundred and ten larvae was counted  in it Fortunately the next year showed a very  different result for then it was difficult on careful  search to find one In some districts of France  it is also very destructive the grass of large tracts  being so completely destroyed by it that enough  food for the maintenance of the cattle is not to  be obtained These larvte like the lastnamed  appear to destroy by eating away the roots of the  grass From these and the foregoing facts entomology teaches us to regard these two insects  upon which we commonly look with compassion  as occasionally becoming the formidable though  indirect enemies of man The scientific name for   Father Longlegs is Tipula oleracea The  French call them oddly enough milliners or  tailors couturieres tailleurs a name of which it is  harder to guess the origin than the common one of  12 fatherlonglegs which is sufficiently expressive of  one of the features of the insect in the perfect  state perhaps the French tailors are distin¬  guished for being very long and thin  We may yet linger awhile in the fields for  another illustration of the devouring propensities  of vegetablefeeding larvte The pretty moth re¬  presented in the accompanying engraving together  with its larva was once the cause of more alarm  The Gamma Moth and Larva  in France than we can readily conceive It is  often to be seen in our meadows plunging its  minute drinking apparatus into the depths of the  wild flowers and flitting to and fro at no great  height from the ground all the day long and even  after sundown It is called generally the Gamma  moth or Plusia gamma in consequence of the  little mark in its wings which resembles the  Greek letter 7 Its larva is striped with green  and when multiplied excessively as was the case  in France in the year 1735 produces scenes of  desolation which as the results of apparently  an insignificant insects doings can scarcely be  credited In the months of June and July in  that year they became so numerous that the  gardeners and peasantry in the districts plagued  by them declared that they must have been created  by enchantment In some places Reaumur was  assured that an old soldier had been seen to throw  the spell In other places an ugly old woman  who was as wicked as she was frightful had caused  all the mischief Their prodigious numbers appeared to the ignorant and superstitious peasantry  an indubitable proof that they were created by  sorcery And though we cannot of course sympathise with their thoughts on this subject we  can well imagine and feel for their astonishment  and dismay as they beheld the wide desolation of  every green thing produced by the innumerable  millions of these larvae which covered forest field  and garden with their bodies Many persons  began to fear they were really poisonous creatures  and refused in consequence to partake of salads or  other vegetable food of a similar kind This was  probably an equal error with the last and it is  very droll to find the talented Reaumur pleading  with great earnestness that the caterpillars were  not unwholesome as food He even declares his  opinion that if these creatures were to become  excessively numerous in France the inhabitants  might be compelled to treat them as the wretched  inhabitants of Africa do the locusts and when  they have eaten up every green thing fall upon  and eat them With as much learning and eloquence as if he was treating one of his most  favourite topics in entomology M Reaumur recommends these larve for human food adding  that a very little time would enable us to conquer  our disgust at such aliment and that we should  even welcome to our tables a dish of the larvoe in  question as an agreeable luxury It is to be  hoped if ever such a custom be originated it will  be confined to the place of its birththe country  of this great but in this respect whimsical  naturalist  To account for their excessive multiplication  we have no need to have recourse to enchantment  for a solution of the difficulty Each of the  gamma moths produces about four hundred  eggs now if there were only twenty larvae in a  certain locality which lived through the winter  and became perfect insects in May following the  eggs deposited by these would supposing all to  be hatched produce according to a calculation  made by Reaumur in the course of a single  year eight hundred thousand larvse Well may we  exclaim then with this learned author Should  we not rather wonder at the wisdom and forethought which has ordered matters so that these  insects increase to annoy us so rarely The  wonder is in truth not that they should multiply  so excessively at particular periods so much as  that it should be so seldom that they are multiplied even to the extent of which they are naturally capable Thus if we suppose that all the  eggs of the moths of this species were to be  hatched it is more than probable that a large  portion of our vegetation would be consumed by  them How is this guarded against In various  ways The eggs are not all capable of being  hatched or if so are not allowed to escape injury  by various accidents and the larvae themselves are  a prey to countless enemies among the birds  while they also frequently perish owing to the  severity of winter From these considerations we  may readily perceive how completely the well¬  being of a great nation with the lives of a large  portion of its inhabitants are dependent upon the  preserving protecting and restraining influence  of the providence of God With the return of  every year we may say the question is asked by  this tribe of insects alone e Shall we go forth to  destroy and devour at once or shall we refrain  With every year the silent reply is experienced by  man in the unmolested condition of his fields  gardens and vineyards Oh we may ejaculate  with the Psalmist t4 Oh that men would consider  these things then should they understand the  lovingkindness of the Lord  Another and more remarkable instance of the  destruction caused by vegetableeating larvae may  be quoted from the fertile pages of the same  illustrious naturalist M Reaumur particularly  because it is the narration of one who was an  eyewitness to the facts of which he speaks In  two journeys he writes which I made from  Paris to Poitou at the commencement of the  month of September in 1730 and also in 1731  I noticed that from Paris all the way to Tours  every oak great and small had been attacked by  larva the highest branches appeared to be principally selected by them Great isolated oak trees  as well as those which formed dense forests were  alike attacked in this manner their summits being  absolutely withered and dry Had we not known  how greatly the larva may multiply and what  fearful ravages they are capable of committing  one might have conceived that some hot and  Destructive Larva and its Nest  blasting wind had reduced the leaves to this condition In certain districts the hedges along the  roadside had not a single leaf that was not  withered up The engraving represents one of  these mischievous larva it also shows the winter  nest into which they creep and a leaf which a  regiment of them have already attacked  Securely protected from the severity of the  winter of 1731 in their warm nests these larva  quitted them again early in April of 1732 to set  forth upon another mission of destruction They  had now multiplied to a degree calculated to  excite the most serious public alarm It began to  be feared that the leaves of the trees would not be  sufficient for the support of the devouring millions  and that if during that year the larva multiplied  in the same proportion as in the preceding year a  famine more terrible than any recorded in history  as produced by insect destroyers would be the  result These fears were in some measure ground¬  less as in all probability so soon as the larvae had  devoured all the leaves they would rather have  perished of hunger than have attacked the grass  and other plants But the matter was sufficiently  serious as it was The French parliament took the  alarm and determined to resist the threatened invasion of these small but formidable enemies An  edict was therefore issued calling upon all persons  to assist in removing the larvae from the trees while  they were as yet not reinforced by the addition  of countless millions more In orchards gardens  and pleasuregrounds this became a far from difficult duty because it was easy to ascend the trees  and to remove the larvae and their nests But in  dense forests where the tall trees waved high in  the air and where every branch and every twig  was loaded with larvae it was plainly impossible  Although as we know acts of parliament are  able to effect a great deal these insects set their  powers at defiance and little good was really accomplished Having thus as it were manifested  to the nation how powerless were their efforts to  remove the plague it pleased God to interfere by  his providence and a succession of cold rains for  three days in May effectually stopped the progress  of the destroyers by utterly annihilating them  Reaumurs remarks well deserve extracting he  says I had been hoping much from the effect  of these showers and attentively watched what  would be the result I saw day by day that  among the little bands of larvae which were aggregated together in order to cover the twigs of the  trees with silk or to despoil them of their leaves  there were many whose bodies became flabby  elongated and devoid of roundness These  quickly perished Every day the mortality became  more serious among them In a short time the  larvae which had previously swarmed upon the  trees became so few that before ten or twelve  days had passed by I could not find a single one  although I looked carefully for them It is re¬  markable enough and sets forth strikingly the  shortsightedness and ingratitude of man that  these very showers which produced what no combined efforts of human power could or did effect  were bitterly complained of as inappropriate to  the season at the time when they were falling  These larva were hatched from eggs deposited by  a common species of moth  Although England has been often mercifully  spared while continental countries have largely  suffered by such visitations as we have last decribed we have not always come off unscathed  The larva of a moth nearly allied to if not the  same as the lastmentioned produced an alarm in  1782 in our country perhaps even more extensive than the previous one in France All sorts of  strange and silly rumours were spread abroad  some believing that the larvse were the harbingers  of coming disease and death Poor people were  hired to cut off the webs of these larvte at the rate  of one shilling a bushel and they were then burned  under the inspection of the churchwardens and  overseers In the parish of Clapham we are told  by an author who wrote upon the history of this  insect eighty bushels were collected in one day  Prayers were offered up in some churches to  deliver the country from the apprehended approaching calamity  We need not however dwell longer upon the  vegetableconsuming larvae out of doors Unfortunately we are acquainted with instances equally  formidable within our barns storehouses and  larders In vain does man lay up the increase of  his fields with care in granaries of the best construction and using all possible precautions against  the introduction of insect enemies The weevil  called scientifically the Galandra granaria finds  entrance and in a short time makes its presence  felt in the vast destruction it produces So soon  as they are discovered they are collected with all  expedition by the owners of the stores and consigned to the flames for their misdeeds Some¬  times they are collected thus by bushels from  which it may readily be conceived what has been  the amount of damage they have done  There is a little moth whose larva is equally  mischievous in appropriating to its own use the  food and property of man its name is the Tinea  hordei This fly we are told deposits perhaps  twenty or thirty eggs in a single grain but as  one grain only is to be the portion of one larva so  soon as they are hatched they disperse by mutual  consent in a very amicable manner and each  selects its future home so that in a short time the  whole family is comfortably lodged in twenty or  thirty distinct grains of corn There surrounded  by food they live and thrive eating up all the  precious parts of the grain until nothing remains  but the husk They then fall asleep and enter  upon the further stages of insect development  No one could possibly tell by the external appearance of the corn that the least mischief had  taken place within the fulness and general aspect  of the grain being the same but on carefully  examining it a very minute hole may be found in  some spot or otherit was here the enemy got  in We need scarcely add that for any purpose  grain which has been thus attacked is rendered  perfectly useless  Any one who has ever been on a long sea  voyage will find it easy to supply us with another  example of a vegetablefood devouring larva  The hard substances commonly called captains  biscuits are the objects of attack together with  flour peas and similar articles of food and the  attacking insect is the larva of the mealworm  the entomological title of which is Tenebrio molitor  In vain does the ships cook with all his art pre¬  pare a soup composed of the richest ingredients  and calculated as one would think to gratify the  taste of the greatest epicure The larva have been  beforehand with him they have attacked and be¬  come mixed with the flour or the peas and when  the soup which has cost him so much pains is  brought to table not even the keen appetite of  seafaring people can reconcile them to it for it  is full of the dead bodies of these larva So  likewise is the biscuit and in disgust the guests  are compelled to confine their attention principally to such articles of food as are unpalatable  to their insect enemies  We have but little experience in our favoured  land of the more extensive domestic destructions  wrought by larvas But in hot countries they  become formidable by reason of their numbers  In India particularly during the rainy season the  interior of the houses swarms with them some  climb the walls some ascend the table some feast  on the viands and altogether by their numbers  and appearance they produce a degree of disgust  and loathing at food which cannot be overcome  for a long time by fresh residents We may  mention before concluding this part of our  subject that of those that do annoy us domestically some have appetites for very strange  kinds of food some love wine some vine¬  gar some butter and cheese some revel in  a pot of preserves some attack our meat and  one is mentioned by Reaumur as delighting in  chocolate  If surprise be expressed that we have dwelt so  long upon the eating propensities of larvae let it  be remembered that it was formerly said at p 94   To protect the wine from them it is customary to have little  silver covers for the wineglasses which are put on immediately  that the glass is taken from the lips  that the principal duty of the larva so long as  it lived was to eat It is born often only to eat  as much as possible and to grow as large as possible within a given time and in obedience to  this principle we find larvae with the sharpest of  sharp appetites embark in their career of existence  eating from their birth all the way along to their  final change It is therefore obviously a very  important part of the larvas history of which we  have been speaking for some pages past Considering the fact to have been now brought into  sufficient prominence we shall proceed to notice  the rate at which larvas grow and the actual  quantities of food  some of them devour Let us speak  of the last first  Silk as the  youngest of our  readers knows is  the production of  a little larva commonly called the  silkworm Now some years ago the calculation  was made that in the United Kingdom alone was  consumed every year not less than five million  pounds of raw silk By means of very accurate experiments it has been ascertained that  in order to procure one pound of raw silk we  must have twelve pounds of the cocoons spun by  these larvae In order to produce twelve pounds  of cocoons one hundred and ninetytwo pounds of  mulberryleaves must be eaten up or which is the  same thing for every pound of raw silk we have  to supply to the worms one hundred and ninetytwo  pounds of leaves We can now leave the calculation in the readers hands but we may mention  the sum total it is that for every years consumption of raw silk by our country there is a certain  consumption of ninetysix millions of pounds of mulberryleaves and as one hundred pounds of leaves  are calculated as the produce of one tree it follows  that nine millions six hundred thousand mulberry  trees must grow in order to supply food to the  silkworms necessary to furnish Great Britain with  silk for one year Let us add that this five mil¬  lion pounds of raw silk is the production of the  inconceivably great number of eighteen thousand  million silkworms The Count Dandolo who has  written an excellent treatise on this subject in  Italian made a number of experiments upon the  actual quantity of leaves devoured by the larvae  hatched from an ounce weight of eggs and he  found that the quantity of leaves consumed by  them up to the completion of their development  as larvae amounted to upwards of sixteen hundred  and nine pounds In a month from being first  hatched each larva consumes above an ounce of  leaves As at first each larva only weighs the  hundredth part of a grain it follows that it devours in thirty days about sixty thousand times  its original weight of leaves If we suppose a  puppy dog just born to weigh a quarter of a  pound and to eat in the same proportion for one  month it would have consumed at the months end  fifteen thousand pounds of food Could the puppy  eat meat from the first which as all are aware  he cannot he would at this rate devour in one  month from the time of his birth one hundred  and fifty sheep supposing each to weigh one hundred pounds or about five sheep for his daily  food These calculations will show how voracious  the larva of the silkworm are and they are probably far from being among the most voracious  of the larva only we are better acquainted with  their rate of devouring than with that of other  insects in this state  All this eating cannot of course be unattended  with a great increase in the size of the larva In  some insects growth is prodigiously rapid A naturalist who closely investigated this subject in  the common blowfly which is so apt to deposit  its eggs upon meat in hot weather found that  Growth of Silk worm Larva  in the space of fourandtwenty hours the larvae  hatched from these eggs had increased to from one  hundred and forty to two hundred times their original weight The larva of the great goat moth  we are told by another grows altogether to  about seventytwo thousand times its weight but  it takes three years so to do In thus growing  the larva becomes very fat and plump and should  it unhappily cross the path of any bird it would  probably be nipped up as a dainty morsel for the  little ones in the distant nest In birds beasts  and fishes the rate of growth is much slower and  the amount of increase much less Fortunate is  it for us that it is so for what would become of  mankind if animals of the size of dogs could grow  in a month to the size of elephants or young  elephants to the size of little kills yet these comparisons are not exaggerated remembering the  increase and growth of the silkworm and of  larvae generally  CHAPTER III  MOULTING OF THE LARVA  We are now to enter upon a very interesting  part of the history of a larva this is called moult¬  ing and consists in the larva casting off its old  skin and appearing clothed in a new garment  often more brilliant than before The change is  well and clearly described in the following passage  from the Introduction to Entomology of Messrs  Kirby and Spence A day or two previously  to each change of skin the larva ceases eating  altogether it becomes languid and feeble its  beautiful colours fade and it seeks a retreat  in which it can undergo this important and sometimes dangerous and even fatal operation in security Here either fixing itself by its legs to the  surface on which it rests or as is the case with  many caterpillars by its prolegs to a slight web  spun for this purpose it turns and twists its body  in various directions and alternately swells and  contracts its different segments The object of  these motions and contortions seems to be to separate the exterior skin now become dry and  rigid from the new one just below it After continuing these operations for some hours resting  at intervals without motion as if exhausted by  their violence the critical moment arrives the  skin splits in the back in consequence of the still  more violent swelling of the second and third  segments The opening thus made is speedily  increased by a succession of swellings and contractions of the remaining segments even the head  itself often divides into three triangular  pieces and the enclosed larva by degrees  withdraws itself wholly from its old skin  The engraving is intended to show the  larva just escaping out of its old skin  Sometimes the larva comes out of its  skin at the side sometimes it has been  seen to bite off portions of the skin ■  The most common wav is that above  described The skin when cast in this manner resembles a sort of universal coat which  has fitted into every crack and joint of the insects  body and just as a ladys glove if we could sup¬  pose it tinted of a fleshcolour and marked for the  various markings on the hand might be mistaken  if cast down after inflating it with air for a hand  cut off so only far more closely does the cast skin  represent in the minutest particular the larva  which has emerged from it It is a perfect mould  of all its parts even to the very antennae eyes  jaws c Thus say the authors last quoted  if you saved the skins cast by the larva of the  insect called Callimorpha or Arctia Caja you would  appear to have ten different specimens of caterpillars furnished with every external necessary part  and differing only in size and in the colour per¬  haps of the hairs and all representing the same  individual  In order to show how completely this is the  case some singular experiments have been made  by various observers in the following manner  Jlist before the larva v r as about to cast off its skin  they have by means of a sharp instrument cut  off one or two of its feet The larva was then  allowed to moult and was carefully examined and  it was invariably found that the feet cut off when  in its old skin were also wanting when it appeared  in its new robes thus plainly proving that the  feet were really sheathed in the old skin completely  It was just as if we had gloves on our hands and  were to put one finger or more between a pair of  sharp and powerful shears we should of course  find that when we took off the glove we should be  short of one or two fingers  But the hairs are not thus sheathed The old  skin if the larva was a hairy one such as many of  those with which we are familiar under the more  popular title caterpillars is cast off with the  hairs attached to ita circumstance which makes  the cast skin look still more like the real larva  How then it may be asked does the larva acquire  new hairs to take the place of the old ones  Were we to take a larva just before its moulting  and by a sharp and delicate instrument to slit  open and raise its old skin we should soon perceive how this has been contrived We should   there perceive sundry little tufts of very delicate  hairs lying down smoothly on the surface of the  larvas body and arranged in certain directions  with great regularity When the old skin is cast  in the course of a little time these hairs stand  upright find assume precisely the same appearance  as those on the former skin  The keeper of silkworms can tell us well and  perhaps with many a sigh that the period of  moulting is one of great peril to his tender  charge The larvae are sick and feeble for some  time after each period of moulting and large  numbers die at this time apparently unable to  bear the exhaustion attending the loss of their old  skin Larva generally are much debilitated by  each moult that takes place for a variable period  sometimes for some hours sometimes for a whole  day they will refuse food and lie without motion  All their parts are very soft and tender and re¬  quire hardening by exposure to the air After a  certain period however these effects pass off the  larva recovers its original strength its body becomes  firm its colour brightens and appears more brilliant than ever and above all like convalescents  among ourselves its appetite is twice as keen as  before which when we call to mind what has  been already said about the voracity of larva it  will be confessed appears scarcely possible  These changes of skin take place a definite  number of times in the larva of each species The  breeders of silkworms tell us that that precious  if not priceless little larva sheds its skin four  times other larvae moult oftener than these some  five times some seven times some eight times  and some nine or even ten times others again  only moult thrice The ordinary number of  moults appears to be about three or four Some  however never moult at all in the larva state  The larva of the common bee and that of  the fleshfly and some others are among this  number  Whatever may be the general opinion upon the  want of beauty and comeliness in insects and  particularly during the larva stage of their history  it is very certain that it is quite erroneous We  may possibly fail unaided by the pencil and co¬  lours of the artist in conveying even an approach  to an adequate conception of the rich and glowing  raiment with which it has pleased God to clothe  these minute and humble beings But a very  little actual observation of a few even of the commoner larvae or caterpillars of the butterfly and  moth species will convince the reader that few  other created things have been so exquisitely  adorned with magnificence of colour and apparel  as the 1 ary as of these insects Here will be found  hues so rich and deep as to   Make the roses blush of beauty pale  And dim the rich geraniums scarlet blaze  Here is a larva of a moth before us whose head  is a delicate orange colour whose belly and feet a  pale pure green whose sides are of primrose tint  variegated with slashes of green and along the  back there runs a beautiful band of white the intensity of which is most agreeably relieved by a vein  of lovely pink which divides it in the middle  There is another clothed in purple green and  white another the larva of the butterfly called  the Camberwell Beauty is of a brilliant black  dotted with spots glowing like carbuncles along  its back another has a coat which seems as if set  with precious stones blazing with an intensity of  colour which cannot be conveyed by description  In a word larvae on the whole can boast as varied  a display of beautiful hues as can almost the whole  array of flowers in our gardens In consequence  of the unfortunately too general feeling of  loathing to which allusion has already been made  but few persons are in reality acquainted with  their beauties Their diminutive size also renders  them less attractive than they might otherwise  prove since we are generally most pleased with  the beauty of an object when its size makes it so  manifest to our eyes as to render it impossible  it should escape our attention  It is a very remarkable fact and corresponds  to a certain extent with the influence of the same  agent upon plantsthat light seems to be in some  measure necessary in order to develop the colours  of the larva Thus it has been noticed that  those larva which are by their habits much in  darkness dwelling perhaps in caves of the earth  or immured in the heart of a piece of timber or  inhabiting a cell scooped out of the solid rock  are most frequently of a uniform whitish colour  Some experiments have shown that when these  whitish larvae have been brought out of darkness  and exposed to the sunlight their colour has  turned to brown Very probably this effect is due  to precisely the same kind of change as takes place  when a fairskinned European travels into a southern clime his face and hands becoming so brown  tanned and dark as to form a ludicrous contrast  to the whiteness of his chest or arms which are  not exposed to the influence of the solar ray  There is still something more to be said about  the coats of the larva To look at some of  them it would be difficult for a person unacquainted with entomology to guess at the real  nature of the object before him Some look  like dry twigs Some look far more like little  Cactuses than insects Some are clothed with  hairs arranged in the most curious and eccentric  manner Some have hairs so long as to give  them all the appearance of very minute shock  dogs In some the hairs are arranged like  stars in others like the quills of the e fretful  porcupine The backs of other larva look just  as if they were studded over with little camelhair pencils Madame Merian has described the  larva of an insect found in Surinam as having  the various divisions of its body ornamented  with three blue tubercles like turquoise beads  from each of which proceeds a long delicate  feathery plume of a black colour Another de¬  scribed by the same lady is splendidly adorned  on each side with fifty red tubercles shining  like coral from each of which proceed five or  six long hairs Some again are covered as  thickly as possible with sharp processes like  thorns sufficiently strong and sharp to pierce the  skin of any one who incautiously ventures to  take them up The body of a small caterpillar  brought from Brazil is described by Kirby and  Spence as possessing a body so thickly planted  with spines like the branches of a tree as absolutely to wear the appearance of a forest or  thicket in miniature It has been stated indeed  by some travellers that the larva of some insects  has the power of darting out when alarmed  by the approach of anything such as the human  hand from as many knobs or protuberances in its  back eight bunches of little stings with which it  inflicts a very painful and venomous wound  The larva of some insects again seem as if they  were clothed from head to foot in the most delicate  and snowy white cotton wool These may some¬  times be seen on our appletrees but one of the  most singular is figured in the cut from an en¬  graving given in Baron de Geers work The  larva is covered completely with a  coat of cottony flakes of the most  dazzling white and these are arranged as will be perceived with  great regularity The larva has in  this white and warm raiment some  Singularly cvated  Larva w hat of the aspect of a coachman  buried in the oldfashioned great coats with the  many capes  Having dwelt so long upon the food and clothing of the insect in the larva form it is right we  should now devote a little space to consider how  they breathe Some one perhaps will say Breathe  do larvae breathe Most certainly and respiration or the function of breathing is not more  necessary to us than it is to these creatures For  this purpose however we must begin a fresh  chapter  CHAPTER IV  RESPIRATION OF THE LARVA  We well know from the various melancholy accidents which have taken place that unless human  beings have a constant supply of pure fresh air they  must perish Many years ago a number of unfortunate persons were shut up in a narrow cell called  the Black Hole at Calcutta where they could  scarcely find room to stand much less obtain air to  breathe In one night the greater part of them died  More recently as some poor Irish were being conveyed in a steamer in stormy weather the captain  out of prudence and mistaken kindness ordered the  hatches to be all battened down so that fresh air  was prevented from getting in A shocking spectacle was beheld soon afterwardsin the close  suffocating cabin lay a number of dead bodies of  men women and children all destroyed by the  want of air Now precisely the same fatal results  take place if we treat larvm in the same manner  from which we learn that undoubtedly breathing  is not only one of their functions but a most  necessary and important one  This may be easily proved If the reader will  procure about a dozen caterpillars of any common  kind and put them into a dry phial corking them  closely up and if he leaves them in their prison of  glass a sufficient time all will die even though he  may have supplied them on putting them in with  an abundance of food Clearly therefore they do  not die of starvation and we should be naturally  disposed to say they must have died of suffocation  that is they died because the function of breathing  could not take place as there was not the necessary change of the air contained in the phial But  suppose that other caterpillars were procured and  put into another phial with a sufficiency of green  food the mouth being covered over with a piece of  muslin or fine lace what would then be the result  Simply that they would live and thrive for as long  a period as they received their proper quantity and  quality of food and would pass through all their  stages of existence as comfortably as if in the open  air The reason would be because the open fibres  of the muslin or lace do not interfere in the least  with the requisite change of air for respiration  Again if after corking up the bottle for a short  time we were to shake out all the caterpillars  from it and then put into it a little water in  which quicklime has been slakedsold by chemists  under the name of limewaterwe should find  it become quite white and milklike This would  be because as the physiological chemist well  knows the function of breathing causes carbonic  acid gas to be poured out of the body no matter  whether it is the body of an insect or an elephant  and this gas has the property of turning limewater  of the colour mentioned Hence we have a second  and convincing proof that larvae breathewe  need scarcely remind the reader that caterpillars  are larvaeand more than this that the function  of breathing in them resembles so far as the dis¬  charge of this peculiar gas is concerned the same  function whether carried on in the human body or  in that of the most mighty and majestic of the  beasts of the field  The great chemist Scheele has experimented  somewhat in the manner we have recommended  upon the breathing of larvae He found that when  caterpillars and maggots to use the customary  terms for these varieties of larvae were confined  in vessels containing only about eleven cubic  inches of atmospheric air and so stopped as to  preclude the ingress of any fresh air whatever  although furnished with an abundant supply of  food they soon died When he put them into a  still smaller vessel they died the sooner In fact  precisely in proportion to the purity or to the  amount of the air contained in the space in which  he confined them were their lives prolonged or  shortened He found on examining the air that  it contained as above stated carbonic acid gas  We may therefore consider the question as  settledthat larvae do breathe Strange it may  appear to some but neither in the larva nor in any  other form of its existence do insects breathe by  the mouth How then it may be asked We  shall now describe their breathing apparatus very  briefly Along each side of the body runs a delicate tube for the conveyance of air called a  trachea or when both are spoken of the tracliece  these channels run underneath the muscles and  skin and open to the air by little branch tubes  the mouths of which are called spiracles Besides  these branch tubes which open to the air the  large tubes send off a great number of smaller  ones which extend  to all parts of the  penetrating  even to the legs and  wings In some insects the spiracles  or breathing holes  ° A Spiracle open The same shut  are defended by a  pair of flaps which swing to and fro so as to  let in the air and close upon it after each  inspiration By this simple means the breathing  of insects is carried on the air enters the tubes  passes along them and is then conveyed to every  part of the body after which having fulfilled its  duties it escapes again In man and the higher ani¬  mals there is a separate place for the air in the  body which we call the lungs and here the blood  is conveyed to the air in order to be purified  But as we have just seen in insects it is very  different for in them the air is conveyed by in¬  numerable minute pipes to every portion of the  frame Such is the breathing mechanism common  in larvae which live in the air  It will be readily imagined that those larva  which dwell in the water must be furnished somewhat differently in order to enable them to  breathe And here as we shall now find there  are some very curious arrangements in order to  effect this object They may be considered under  two divisions First contrivances for breathing  air while the larva is immersed in the water  and second apparatus for extracting the dissolved  oxygen gas necessary for breathing from the  water  Let us select a few of the most singular in¬  stances under the first of these divisions No  better example Avrite the entertaining authors of  the Introduction to Entomology ee can be selected  than the gnat You must have occasionally observed in tubs of rainwater numerous little wrig¬  gling wormlike animals which frequently ascend  to the surface there remain awhile and then bending their head under the body rapidly sink again  to the bottom These are the larva of some  species of the genus just named and if you take  one out of the water and examine it you will  perceive that it is furnished near the end of the  body with a singular organ which varies in length  according to the species and forms an angle with  the last segment but one The mouth of this  organ is funnelshaped and terminates in five  points like a star and by this it is usually suspended at the surface of the water  and preserves its communication with  the atmosphere In its interior is a  tube which is connected with the  trachece and terminates in several  openings visible under a microscope  at the mouth of the organ The  points or rays of this mouth are used  to close it when the animal is dis¬  posed to sink in the water and thus Breathing apparatmoj   an aquatic Larva  cut on its communication with the  atmosphere When the animal is immersed a  globule of air remains attached to the end of the  tube so that it is in fact of less specific gravity  than water and it is not without some effort  that it descends to the bottom but when it  wishes to rise again it has only to unclose the  tube and it rises Avithout an effort to the surface  and remains suspended for any length of time  The extremity of the larva is clothed with bunches  of hairs which are furnished with some repellent  material which prevents their becoming wet It  is this repellent quality that probably causes a  dimple or depression of the surface which if you  look narrowly you will discover round the mouth  of the tube  In summer time the reader can scarcely fail of  the gratification of watching these most curious  creatures for they abound in ditches pools and  the stagnant waters of artificial fountains They  form a very curious object under the microscope  and particularly in the gas microscope or solar microscope where the image of the larvae is thrown  as in the case of the magiclantern upon a white  sheet or wall Their curious writhings to and  fro the energy they display in lashing about  their tails so as to throw the few drops of water  in which they are imprisoned into mimic whirl¬  pools their occasional dartings down to the bot¬  tom and subsequent gentle rise up to the surface  together with the terror into which countless minor  occupants of the same watery prison with them¬  selves are thrown when one of these comparative  giants plunges into the midst of them form a  spectacle as unique as it is interesting and divert¬  ing A sharp eye and a phial and cork are the  alone requisites for finding out these singular  beings on most fine days in summer But a little  while ago the writer was amused to find on a  sunny day in June the water of a small fountain  playing before his study window thickly populated  with these active larvie and it became an amusement which seldom wearied to watch their fantastic evolutions and to trace their changes from  the larva through the ulterior stage up to the perfect insect To this however we shall probably  have occasion to revert before the conclusion of  this work  Another instance of a curious contrivance for  assisting the breathing of a larva whose body is  wholly immersed in water may also be found  near home Most probably the majority of our  readers have seen or at any rate are well acquainted with the apparatus by which the diver  descends and works under water Lest some  should not we may mention that it consists of a  watertight dress which covers the diver from  head to foot while his head is enclosed in a  helmet or hood furnished with a pipe or hose  which is long enough to reach to the surface of  the water and is there generally connected with  an airpump which forces clown fresh air and so  enables the man to breathe almost as comfortably  as if he were walking on land instead of at the  bottom of the sea Let it be conceived now that  there were no airpump at the top of the hose  but simply a buoy of cork to keep it floating and  that the diver had the power of shortening or  lengthening the hose at his pleasure we should  then have a tolerably fair representation of the  contrivance with which Infinite Wisdom has sup¬  plied the humble creatures of whom we are about  to speak  By carefully examining the water running from  manure heaps or water which has become putrid  and is much loaded with mud and ooze the reader  will pretty generally be successful in discovering  a number of the larvae of a twowinged fly of  the shape represented in the cut When dis¬  covered the singularity of their structure will  amply repay him for the trifling unpleasantness  attending the search after them After washing  them in a little fair water and putting them into  a tall aleglass or German beerglass which must  be three parts filled with water they will be in  the best condition for our examination When  Reaumur first beheld them he gave them the  name of Vers a queue de rat that is larvae with a  rats tail and when the reader  looks at them as shown in the  representation annexed he will  be inclined to think with us  that a more appropriate title  could not have been found  On watching them they will  be seen to wriggle about until  are comfortably settled  darting from place to place as  if uneasy in their new position  and in the pure element By  andby however they become  reconciled to their lot and  lie perfectly quiet at the bottom of the glass in  the position represented From the tail of each  will now be seen to rise a beautifully delicate and  minute tube which comes up to the surface of  the water and here whatever be the movements  of the larva below it remains floating and free  Just as the diver may while his companions  above are pouring down torrents of fresh air  move about and perform various duties under  water so the larva may move from one position  to another and assume almost any variety of attitude but its little airpipe still retains its perpendicular direction and does not quit the surface  of the fluid  A singular experiment may now be tried with  them Let a little water be poured into the glass  by means of a funnel the end of which dips under  the water so as not to give them unnecessary disturbance and by this means the level of the water  in the glass becomes insensibly raised half an inch  or so In a few seconds it will be found that these  little tails have all lengthened themselves and are  again at the surface of the water even at its higher  level More water may be poured in until perhaps the level is raised three or four inches and  still the same thing takes place the larvae still prolong their curious tails until it seems as if they  would stretch to an indefinite length for they are  already eight or ten times longer than the body  But as we might jestingly saythe longest tail  comes to an end at last for on continuing to pour  more water in the larvae stretch their tails to the  utmost and then finding the level of the water  still above their reach they become uneasy and  REMARKABLE ORGAN  169  all quit the bottom of the glass and attach them¬  selves to its sides  Let us now examine more minutely this very  singular apparatus By a  good lens we may readily  do this as the organ is very  transparent permitting its internal structure to be beautifully seen Placing the creature in a convenient position  for our examination and in  a good light it will be presently seen that the tail is  composed in reality of two  tubes of which one slides up  and down within the other  just like the tubes of a telescope see cut By this means  the larva is provided with an  instrument capable of being  made to reach to a  great  length and yet also possessing the capability of being packed up again  in a very small compass The proper breathing  tube is the small inner one at its extremity is a  pair of spiracles or breathing pores and surround¬  ing these are placed five minute bristles which  are supposed to act somewhat as a buoy and to  retain the tail in its position Where  the tail joins on to the body of the  larva two tubes thrown into folds are  placed which are connected with the  breathing tubes of the tail at one end  and with the breathing pipes which run  along the body of the larva at the other  When the tail is pushed out to its farthest these zigzag tubes are stretched  quite straight when it is drawn in  End of the Tau again they are thrown into folds Both  these appearances are shown in the plate It has  been supposed that the larva causes the tube  to be pushed out by forcing air into it and thus  causing the zigzag tubes to straighten themselves  Perhaps the tail is drawn in by the same tubes  contracting again and thus folding together and  dragging back the tube to which they are connected  We need scarcely stop to mention how useful is  this admirable contrivance to the insect Having  to seek for their food at the bottom of ditches  drains or puddles they are necessarily exposed to  the risk of suffocation unless fresh air can be conveyed to them and it is difficult for us to imagine  how any apparatus could have been contrived  which would have adapted itself to all the varying  depths of water in which the insect must be constantly living as it changes from place to place  He must have been a clever engineer who could  have successfully met this difficulty None of our  present diving apparatus does so The organ we  have been considering the creation of an Infinite  Mind small and despicable as it may seem in our  eyes fulfils perfectly every function for which it  was formed It admits of free movement from  place to place it admits moreover of free change  from one level to another in the fluid by which the  larva is surrounded and it is at the entire disposal  of the insect which can without the smallest inconvenience accommodate it to the various circumstances in which it may be placed  Possibly the same phial in which was brought  home the lastnamed larvce with the rats tail  will furnish us with an equally elegant instance  of larvarespiration under water in the case of the  larva of a fly called the chameleon fly This  little creature if it can be found and though not  as common as the last it may yet be detected in  summer by the edge of ponds c has truly elegant habits The great Swammerdam who first  described it was lost in admiration at it The  extremity of its body is furnished with a coronet  of about thirty elegantly feathered  hairs These are under the control  of the insect and are capable of  being folded up so as to enclose a  minute bubble of air When the  larva is weary of remaining at the  top of the water and wishes to dive  to the still and cool depths below it  causes these hairs so to fold up and  close upon each other as to include  the airbubble so that it cannot  escape Thus furnished with a  ward and thus breathes under water until the  purity of the captive airbubble is impaired when  it returns to the surface to repeat the same  operations The appearance of the little bubble  shining with a brilliant silvery lustre under the  water is very pleasing and accounts for the  enthusiastic expressions used by Swammerdam  in speaking of the visible manifestation of the skill  of God in this insect The fact of an insect  coming to the surface for air and stealing away a  portion then diving down again into the waters is  not uncommon in insect history although few are  possessed of so elegant a contrivance for effecting  it as the larva in question  We must pass on to mention an instance or  two of larvre which from the peculiarity of their  respiration come under the second of our divisions  that is they live in the water and do not breathe  air but obtain the gas necessary for their respiration from the water which holds it in a state of  solution We shall first speak of the larva of the  common Mayfly the perfect insect of which is so  well known to and highly prized by anglers  under the various names of duns and drakes  than which in some streams no insect that flies is  a better bait to the unwary fish Should the  reader wish to examine them for himself they  may be found in May or June hiding themselves  during the day in the mud or underneath stones  or in little holes in the banks or taking a subaqueous tour upon the bed of the brook while the  clear and purling waters roll smoothly on above  them Their little underwater cells are shown  in the cuts together  with the larva  Their organs for  breathing the water  if the expression  which is in some  measure correct may  be admitted are  very like the gills  of a fish But instead of forming a part of the  structure of the mouth and head as those of  the fish in the larva  they are placed  along its body and  are arranged in  pairs A delicate  little airtube enters into each of  these gills and  there branches out  into a great many  directions this tube  the large trachea or breathing vessel of the insect  running along its body The air entering these  gills and thus being exposed to a large surface of  water containing dissolved gas loses its impurities  and absorbs the pure gas from the water whence  it is then conveyed to the various parts of the  body In many species of these larvse the whole  series of gills are moved to and fro incessantly and  so quickly as to be scarcely perceptible to the eye  Some of them use them as oars moving with inconceivable rapidity and being capable of darting  both backwards and forwards with great quickness They have also the power of leaping or  springing in the water to a considerable distance  and feed on minute aquatic larvie and on vegetable matters  The only other instance of this kind that Ave  shall quote will be that of the terrible larva of  the dragonfly whose deeds of insect murder came  before us on a former occasion The apparatus  provided for them is very singular and has been  described with his usual accuracy by the talented  Reaumur It exists in the tail of the insect and  may be readily watched in action by adopting the  following expedientPour into a small glass in  which the larva has been put and which is half  full of water a few drops of a solution of carmine  by means of a little tube introduced into the  water and made to drop its contents near the  tail of the creature Immediately it will be seen  that the coloured liquid is rapidly sucked in by  the tail of the insect and then after the expiration  of a little time is forced back again in a tiny jet  with considerable violence to a distance of several  inches Reaumur tells us that if we hold the  insect between the finger and thumb gently and let  fall a drop of water on its tail we shall presently  see it eagerly sucked in the body of the insect  becoming sensibly larger and byandby it is  thrown out again Sometimes it raises its tail  above the surface of the water and whether for  sport or not it is hard to say squirts the water in  a mimic jet to some distance  The apparatus has been described as resembling  the piston or plunger of a forcepump which  moves to and fro within a cavity inside the insects  body and by that means draws in and forces out  the water The tail is defended by a sort of  coronet composed of five hard bristlelike pieces  which are under the control of the creature and  may be opened and closed at pleasure The  larva appears capable of inflicting a somewhat  painful pinch by this contrivance so that what  with its wonderful mask with its powerful squirt  and with its tail thus armed it would be difficult  to select another insect better prepared for battle  with creatures of every aquatic tribe than it  The action of the pumping apparatus sends it  rapidly forward through the water somewhat like  a paddlewheel or at least upon the same principle  as that contrivance namely the resistance offered  by the water to the stroke of this apparatus  CHAPTER Y  MEANS OF DEFENCE OF THE LARVA  There is perhaps no period in the life of an insect when it is so much in danger of the attacks  of foes as when it is in the larva state Possessed  at the best with but very feeble powers of locomotion in comparison with those of winged insects it is continually exposed to destruction on  all sides from which it has not the power to escape  Not only do insects of various species particularly  select the larva for the object of their attacks but  birds and other creatures are also in the lists  against them Thus imperilled what chance has  the larva against foes so numerous and in a contest so unequal It lias been calculated that a  pair of sparrows for their ow T n consumption and  for that of their tender brood destroy at least  three thousand caterpillars in a week and we  well know what multitudes of larvas fall into the  clutches of the cawing rooks which follow the tail  of the plough The winged insects are tolerably  secure although many even of their ranks fall  victims to the swiftwinged swallow and sandmartin and to the rapid leap of the artful trout But  the poor crawling larvae are neither strong enough  to fight nor swift enough to flee and fall by thousands into the unsparing hands of their various  enemies  Yet the Creator who has wisely appointed a  large portion of their numbers for food to many  creatures has also taken many precautions to prevent their being entirely annihilated as might  otherwise have been the case These are well deserving a brief notice previous to our passing on  to the last stage in the history of the larva From  what has been already said about the coats of various larvae it may be imagined that that must be  a stouthearted enemy which could venture to  attack some of them The spines and hard excrescences with which they are furnished must  undoubtedly prove far from agreeable to the touch  of a foe and there can be no question that this  sort of armour is of itself a good defence to many  larvae Others form artificial coverings which are  equally useful by concealing them from the notice  of their enemies Thus as we have before remarked some dwell in tubes of leaves hid from  every eye others encase themselves in a shield of  cemented gravel or shells like those represented  in the cut presenting a most grotesque appearance  others hide themselves  in variouslyformed cells  Some immediately on  Larva Case of Shells beinsf touched roll them  selves up like hedgehogs into a ball which looks  like a little globe of hairs and is so slippery  that it cannot be retained between the fingers  others again when they are touched instantly  drop down and from their colour resembling precisely that of the herbage into which they have  fallen it becomes next to fruitless to search for  them  A very singular larva which both for offence  and defence adopts a most extraordinary procedure must be mentioned by itself This larva  is not unfrequently to be found in our houses and  is said to feed upon our disgusting and annoying  invadersthe bugs but it so completely contrives to conceal its real character that not once  in a hundred times would it probably be recognised as an insect at all It collects together a  number of particles of sand or fragments of  wool or silk or earth and with singular skill contrives to form a sort of coat out of these in which  it envelopes itself Thus attired as may be imagined it is not easy to discover what the object  really is and it thus undoubtedly escapes the  undesirable notice of any of its enemies But more  than this like those North American Indians  who hunt by concealing themselves in the skins  of wolves and so attract less attention from the  herd than they would do if they were to expose  themselves in their natural aspect to view this  crafty larva steals upon its prey in much the same  manner although it can run with sufficient swift¬  ness when necessary It creeps forward with the  greatest stealth moving only one leg at a time  and thus quite insensibly approaches its victim  who is not at all alarmed at what merely appears  to be a lump of dust Soon however it is convinced of its fatal mistake and discovers the  terrible fact that it is in the embrace of an unsparing devourer  Other larvre escape notice in a singular manner  by their close resemblance to little pieces of stick  Thus we are told by Messrs Kirby and Spence  that there is a certain tribe of caterpillars called  surveyors Geometrce that will sometimes support  themselves for whole hours by means of their  posterior legs solely upon their hinder extremity  forming an angle of various degrees with the  branch on which they are standing and looking like one of its twigs The body is kept  stiff and immovable with the separations of the  segments scarcely visible it terminates in a knob  the legs being applied close so as to resemble a  bud at the end of a twig besides which it often  exhibits intermediate tubercles which increase the  resemblance Its colour too is usually obscure  and similar to that of the bark of a tree so that  doubtless the sparrows and other birds are frequently deceived by this manoeuvre and thus  balked of their prey Bbsels gardener mistaking  one of these caterpillars for a dead twig started  back in great alarm when upon attempting to  break it off he found it was a living animal  Some however are actually armed so as to  offer an active resistance to the onslaught of any  enemy Mr Abbot has described a terrible  caterpillar well known in certain districts in  America under the strange title of the Hickory¬  horned Devil This creature is furnished with  seven or eight strong hornlike spines upwards of  half an inch in length which project from its head  and anterior segments When threatened by  danger the caterpillar does not attempt to fly  but lifts up its head menacingly and shakes it  about in a very fierce manner The negroes  in particular are so terrified at its aspect that  they dread it as much as the rattlesnake But  in reality it is harmless and Mr Abbot in  order to convince the ignorant people that such  was the case took hold of it in their presence  without receiving any injury This however  did not convince them and they made answer that  although it did not sting him it would undoubtedly sting them  The weapon of another is thus pleasantly de¬  scribed by De Geer In the month of July  I found a caterpillar resting upon a small twig  which I cut off in order to enable me to ex¬  amine it more attentively As I was scrutinizing  its appearance I happened accidentally to touch  its body Instantly there shot out from a spot near  the head two streams of clear fluid which struck  me on the face and partly entered one of my eyes  causing a very acute but fortunately not a very  enduring pain My surprise at this salute prevented my taking particular notice of the place  from whence the jets proceeded It appears probable that this caterpillar has been thus endowed  with this squirting apparatus to enable it to defend  itself against its enemies or at least to assist in  frightening or perhaps in hunting its prey For  myself I confess after the reception I had met  with I felt some degree of fear at too nearly approaching it  On examining them carefully at another opportunity this entomologist found that these cater  pillars were provided with a squirting apparatus  situated in a cleft in the neck When the creature is irritated  it thrusts out a  curious organ divided into four  branches and  drilled with holes  like the rose of  a watering pot  FrOm this organ Squirting Larva The Cleft and squirting Organ are  shoot the jets of shown separately  liquid spoken of After the discharge they are  drawn in again and covered over by the closing  up of the cleft Strange to say when taken in¬  doors the caterpillar lost the power of squirting  altogether It appeared as if it could only do so  in the open air where a number of insect enemies  were arrayed against it This caterpillar is commonly known as that of the Pussmoth and has  sometimes caused the most strange and foolish  country tales by its striking appearance It has  been described as a horrible monster having a  head like a lion jaws like a shark a horn like a  unicorn and two tremendous stings in its tail  Certainly its appearance is not the most engaging  in the world as may be conceived from the representation of it in the cut and what adds to its  singularity is that it possesses the power of lashing  its sides with its tail so as to drive away flies If  the reader should be fortunate enough to find one  he may have some amusement in examining all the  curious apparatus with which this rather forbidding looking insect is supplied  The winter draws near and sends its foretokening cold breathings to warn every creature vegetable and animal that the dark season is arriving  when food is no longer to be obtained What is  to become of the larva Can it endure the penetrating tooth of frost or the overwhelming shower  of rain Or can it endure to be from week to  week from month to month without a mouthful of  food From the facts already stated with reference to the age of larva it is very certain  that many larvae have to bear these trials and  some not merely during one but during several  winters We must therefore inquire how they  have been defended or strengthened so as to  enable them so to do  The alteration in the coats of animals during  winter or rather just previous to it and the  fact that animals destined to inhabit the arctic  regions are enveloped in coats of the shaggiest  hair are well known to every person There can  be no doubt that in many instances in the insect  world where a larva has to be exposed to the  frosts of winter the same provision of a hairy  covering which has been given to them by the  Creator is intended to meet the same end and  to preserve their soft and tender bodies from the  destructive influence of extreme cold The following striking observation of a talented entomologist who has not thought it beneath him to  write a most interesting book only on the family  of ants M Huber shows very clearly that such  is in fact the intention of providing the larva with  a covering of this kind He noticed that the larvae  of some species of ants destined to pass through  the winter were furnished with this kind of warm  clothing while those which were not so destined  had smooth coats that is even in the same  species thus proving to us beyond a doubt  that as the winter approached the warm coat  was put on by the larva The engraving on  the last page represents some extraordinary specimens of hairiness in caterpillars from Brazil now  in the British Museum  A large number of larvae become torpid during  winterthey are not deadthey are not sensibly  alivethey are plunged in that long halfdeath  which affects not only them but also many large  animals who retire in winter lie down to sleep for  weeks and awake to find the cold departing and  the springtime nigh at hand But the frost some¬  times proves too severe for them and the poor in¬  sects become sometimes congealed into solid lumps  of ice Alas we shall exclaim then there is an  end to their life when that takes place and  undoubtedly the severity of such a degree of  cold destroys large numbers yet strange to say  some larvae actually revive even after they have  been thus frozen into hard inanimate lumps One  observer states that he has found them in this  condition and so entirely congealed that they  chinked like small stones when dropped into a  glass tumbler yet they revived after careful  management In an experiment made during  Sir John Rosss voyage to the arctic regions upon  the larvae of a moth they were four successive  times exposed to the intense cold of 40° below  zero and four times they revived again on being  brought into the warm atmosphere of the cabin  Experiments have also been made by other persons  with a like result It may therefore be considered certain that some larvas will bear to be frozen  into solid masses so that they will snap asunder  like an icicle and yet return to life again and  even go through all their stages of development  into the perfect insect How remarkable a fact  this is when we remember the deadly effect of  frost upon man and the higher animals  Many larvae however form nests of various  kinds in which they comfortably spend the dreary  days and nights of this stern season 44 With this  view write the excellent observers Kirby and  Spence 44 the larva of Cossus ligniperda forms a  covering of pieces of wood lined with fine silk  those of some other moths excavate under a stone  a cavity exactly the size of their bodies to which  they give all round a coating of silk and the larvae  of Pieris Cratcegi enclose themselves in autumn in  cases of the same material and thus pass the cold  season in small societies of from two to twelve  under a common covering formed of leaves Bonnet mentions a trait of the cleanliness of these insects which is almost ludicrous He observed in  one of these nests a sort of sack containing nothing  but grains of excrement and a friend assured him  that he had seen one of these caterpillars partly  protrude itself out of the case the hind feet first  to eject a similar grain so that it would seem the  society have on their establishment a scavenger  whose business it is to sweep the streets and  convey the rejected matters to one grand repository This however singular is rendered not  improbable from the fact that beavers dig in  their habitations holes solely destined for a like  purpose as do also badgers  A singular variety of larvanest is mentioned  by a Mexican traveller He says ct After having  ascended for about an hour we came to the region  of oaks and other majestically tall trees the names  of which I could not learn Suspended from their  stately branches were innumerable nests enclosed  apparently in white paper bags in the manner of  bunches of grapes in England to preserve them  from birds and flies I had the curiosity to  examine one of them which I found to contain  numberless caterpillars The texture is so strong  that it is not easily torn and the interior contained a quantity of green leaves to support the  numerous progeny within  The larvae of some Australian insects form the  most curious nests we have ever beheld A  representation taken from specimens in the entomological collection at the British Museum will  show what extraordinary structures these are  They appear like minute bundles of faggots and  have been formed by the insect cutting short pieces  of twigs all nearly of the same size and then  cementing them together in the manner represented Some of these are of a large size as  large as a moderatesized pear others are smaller  and these present the most beautifully regular appearance consisting of a number of very small  Australian Larvacases  rods bound together in a cylindrical form like  the fasces of the Roman soldiery  In this manner larvce pass through the winter  Without a doubt many perish but there remain  infinite numbers at the end of this season which  from the depths of their cells become sensible  to the influence of spring so soon as the first  footsteps of that season are felt upon the earth  The larva wakens to active life once more and  with an appetite rendered all the keener by its  fast of four or five months it leaves its dormitory  and begins to consume whatever suitable food may  lie in its way and so it continues until the time  of its change approaches  CHAPTER VI  PREPARATION FOR A CHANGE  The last stage of the larvas history hastens on  Its career of activity and voracity is nearly ended  and the insects days in this form are well nigh  spent Hitherto it has been an earthly earth  loving being without either the desire or the power  to raise itself into the airy element in which multitudes of its species are disporting the day long If  we may so speak its highest desires have only been  confined to the quality and quantity of its food  possessing these it was content But now its  hours of feasting are come to a close and it has to  make ready for a great and momentous change  The crawling and perhaps repulsive creature  which we turn from without regret has a high des¬  tiny to accomplish when the period of its sojourn  in its vile body is fully accomplished and then  that form which now creeps among the dust of the  world shall mount up as on eagles wings and be  carried whither it will through the pure regions of  the sky  The age to which the larva generally attains  before this change takes place is exceedingly variable To some it is permitted to reach the  venerable age of four or five years others three  and many not nearly so much The dung and  fungusfeeding insects as if hastened forward by  the warmth of their position are at the end of  their larva life in a week others live a fortnight  in this state and others several months We  are told of a curious anecdote of a beetle which  had existed in a desk set up in an office in Lon¬  don for upwards of twenty years half of which  period according to Messrs Kirby and Spence it  must have lived as a larva But this is quite an  exception to the general rule  For some days before the larva loses its long  distinguishing characteristicits appetite and  now forsakes the plants upon which it formerly  fed or if it does not forsake them no longer  consumes any part of them It becomes apparently in some degree sensible that it is approach¬  ing the most dangerous period of the history of  the insectfine state of sleep or torpor in which  it is to exist as a pupaof which we shall speak  more particularly in our next chapter Before  although a weak and comparatively a defenceless  creature it was still able to exercise a vigilant  watch against its enemies and thus to avoid them  or to prepare for their reception but now its eyes  are to be closed in a deathlike slumber its body  to hang a tempting bait to any wandering foe or  hungry bird and it can in no way resist the attacks of the feeblest adversary  As if fully aware of this the wonderful instinct  of the larva meets the difficulty by teaching  it to select the best place for its concealment  from a dangerous notice With this view it  sets out in search of a hidingplace and rests  not until it has obtained a city of refuge which  may prove to it a defence against the enemy  It may be some little recess covered by an  irregular stone and sheltered round the sides  by moss and the upspringing grass or perhaps  a little hole in the earth has received the poor  fugitive from future harm and in order to conceal  itself more completely it has drawn over the  mouth of the cave a covering of leaves Here  safe from observation the larva bids a farewellto  speak as the poets speakto the busy staring  world for awhile and loses all recollection of its  past history in the night of torpidity upon which  it has now entered The larvie of the ladybird and  other insects glue themselves fast to the under side  of a twig or leaf and here pass the days of their  sleep in safety Many of the larvae of insects  whose life up to this period has been passed be¬  neath the surface of some glassy pool now quit  the pure element and seek the shore on which  they are to pass the remaining portion of their  existence  But there are two other ways in which larvie  prepare for the state of pupa which are so curious and prevail to such a large extent among  insects that we may be excused for following the  example of all authors upon insect history and  treating our readers to the interesting facts which  have been recorded by various observers upon  this subject One of these is the plan of hanging  themselves up in the air like sailors in their hammocks and in other positions this plan is commonly called the suspension of the larva The other  is the formation of beautiful cases of various kinds  which are called cocoons in which they wrap  themselves up close during the period to be de¬  voted to the pupa state Let us speak of these  each separately and first of the case or cocoon  as a place of concealment for the larva It is  right however to premise that while the greater  number of insects are in a torpid or halftorpid  state while in the pupa form all are not so as  will be noticed in the next chapter and those  which are not do not of course require the protection of a cocoon or the contrivance of a silken  hammock  The material of which the case or cocoon is  composed is a beautiful silken fibre which is furnished by a spinning apparatus placed either at  the extremity of the body or more frequently at  the mouth of the insect whence it proceeds in a  filament of the utmost delicacy and transparency  but at the same time of considerable tenacity  By its means alone cocoons of a number of  different kinds some of extraordinary beauty and  ingenuity are constructed but in other cases  the insect has recourse to various materials to  assist in giving strength to the walls of its cell  The best example and the most familiar one we  can select of a purely silken cocoon is that of  those  spinning worms  That in their green shops weave the smoothhaired silk  This beautiful and valuable cocoon when ex¬  amined externally appears to be formed in two  different ways for the outer covering is loose and  open while the inner one is compact and close  and so in truth it is although both coverings are  formed of a single thread The outer has been  Cocoon of Silkworm  called the scaffolding by means of which the inner  and more solid covering is constructed The larva  stationing itself between two leaves or in any  other suitable spot fastens its thread to one of  the adjoining surfaces and then proceeds to draw  out the fibre and fasten it in various positions  until it has woven around itself an envelope as it  were of loose gauze After this has been done  it begins to form the closer and more compact  structure of the inner envelope laying on the silk  backwards and forwards in a series of zigzags  until it has laid on several layers and thus completely shut itself in The loose outer portion  forms what ladies so well know under the title  of flossilk the inner fibres are the most continuous admitting of being wound off without  breaking and they form the ordinary silk of  commerce  M Lyonnet has given a most interesting account  of the proceedings of another larva which fnr surpasses the silkworm in the ingenuity of its manner of forming the cocoon This larva is very  small in fact not more than the sixth of an inch  in length and is found on the under side of oak  leaves M Lyonnet observes that beyond all  the larvae he had ever watched he considered this  creature the most inconceivably ingenious work¬man Its little cocoon is of a white colour and of  a long oval form having its upper surface ornamented with seven upright ridges The first  thing the creature begins by doing is to erect in  EXTRAORDINARY PRECAUTION OF A LARVA 201  the most curious manner a series of little upright  palisades of silk at a certain distance from each  other all round its body so as to form a sort of  oval fence and probably the larva intends them to  serve as a sort of hedge to keep off intruders  while it is busy at work After spinning half  its case it turns  round and begins at the opposite end and thus  forms the other  half it then unites The Larva surrounded by its Palisade  it in the middle and by so doing incloses itself  in a very pretty cage of silken network which it  subsequently strengthens by adding a firm layer  on the inside The time taken in the construction  of this ingenious cocoon is not more than halfan  hour It is quite impossible to understand how  the little being contrives to form the upright  ridges on the surface of its cocoon and as the  larva is so minute it is almost hopeless to expect  to discover it Attempts have been made to un¬  ravel the difficulty but not with complete success  When looking at some magnificent works of man  we are tempted to become inflated with pride  let the remembrance of what this tiny insect can  do keep us humble and direct our admiration  rather to Him who is the Author of all wisdom  the Giver of every good and perfect gift  Upon the leaves of pear trees we may some¬  times find a pretty cocoon of very slight and  elegant texture formed of silk as shown in the  cut  A very singular cocoon  is spun by the larva of  a common moth some¬  what of the outline of a  balloon in form This  cocoon is spun in a very  slight manner and thus  offers a striking contrast  to those of many other  insects in fact it is so  slight and the meshes are  so open that the insect  can be readily seen within  suspended in a hammock  Cocoon on a Pearleaf  of silk and thus presenting a very curious appearance In another the inclosed insect looks just  like a poor prisoner within a grating  In order to give a sufficient degree of strength to  their cocoons some larvae adopt the plan of form¬  ing them partly of silken fibre and partly of other  materials Reaumur being on an entomological  excursion in the forest of Vincennes on a fine day  in the month of May fell in with a most curious  cocoon formed by a larva which feeds upon the  oaktree At first he could scarcely conceive  what the object he saw before him was but on  removing the branch it proved to be a very singular cocoon Detaching a small branch on which  was a larva just commencing its cocoon Reaumur  finding the evening draw on set out on his return  home The larva did not seem to discover the  fact of its being carried away a prisoner and as the  entomologist carried the branch with gentleness  it proceeded with its task as comfortably as if  stationed on the tree it was now leaving behind  Reaumur beguiled the tedium of the way by  carefully watching its mode of proceeding in the  formation of its cocoon He thus noticed the  larva cutting very delicate layers of the fine upper  skin or epidermis of the bark of the twig which it  fastened together by silken cords and then formed  into two winglike pieces fastened on each side of  the twig in the manner represented in the cut  something like the feathers of an arrow in appearance And now this  being done the difficulty was to draw the  two sides together and  so to convert them into  a covering for its body  The manner in which  this was done will  hardly perhaps be  imagined It will be  best understood if the  reader will cut out two  pieces of paper of the  shape of these two side  Cases formed of Epidermis of Bark portions fasten them  on with a little glue by one of their edges to a  piece of twig and then by a fine needle and thread  draw them together by stitching from side to side  all the way up The larva does something very  like this for it fixes silk cords to each of the outer  edges and then pulls and hauls with all its might  until it has forcibly bent over the layers until they  meet and then it ties the edges together by short  cords so as to produce a seam so beautifully close  even and fine as would put the finedrawing  of the most superlative tailor to shame in fact  the join is frequently quite imperceptible Having  done this it lines the inside with beautiful tapestry  of silk By the time Reaumur and his friends had  got to the end of their walk which occupied an  hour and a little more the larva had after vast  labour joined together its seams and far advanced  toward the completion of its task  Reaumur made also some most interesting observations upon a larva which constructs its cocoon  of a sort of silken mesh the interstices of which  are filled with grains of  earth Having broken  off the top of a cocoon  he witnessed the singular spectacle of the  larva proceeding to  mend it again With¬  out leaving its cell the  patient labourer put its  head out of the opening  in the attitude represented in the cut and after looking about for a  little time picked up one by one a number of  grains of earth which it stored up in its case  After this it filled up the sides of the opening  with a network of silk working the grains of  earth into it as it proceeded For three hours the  larva worked incessantly at its task and at the  end of that time had materially reduced the size  of the opening Reaumur was now curious to  observe how the opening still left would be filled  up as the insect could no longer put its head out  and he expected to see it filled up with a mesh of  silk But he had not given the larva due credit  for ingenuity in making this supposition It filled  up the opening first with a mesh of silk but be¬  tween the meshes in a most curious manner it  thrust out some little grains of earth which it had  previously stored up until they actually appeared  on the outside and any one would have sup¬  posed they had been laid on from without It  finally ended its labours by coating the inside of  the opening also with a layer of earth Reaumur  afterwards cut the cocoon in half with a knife  and by that means was enabled to see how successfully the larva had repaired the injury  We must now speak briefly of the Suspension  of the Larva ancl it may be mentioned that the  insects whose larvas perform this manoeuvre are  almost exclusively the butterfly tribe There are  various ways of effecting this object The spinning apparatus by which the cords are to be formed  to sustain the body of the insect in the air is  situated in the mouth of the larva and it may well  be imagined that the insect which is about to hang  itself up by the tail has no easy task to perform in  having to fasten its cords to the tail and then to  the branch above it If a spider wished to hang  itself up by the tail it would be a very easy thing  so to do for the spinning apparatus is placed there  and it has only to let itself fall from a branch  after first glueing the end of the cord to it but a  larva is differently circumstanced and it requires  no slight display of ingenuity to accomplish its  purpose  Its first process is to select a suitable leaf or  twig upon which it weaves a sort of little mound  of silk of the shape of a button This done it  examines it carefully to ascertain its strength and  satisfied therewith it then proceeds to thrust its  two hind legs in amongst the threads of which  the button is composed and in so doing it causes  the hooklike processes which fringe these legs to  become securely entangled in them It then is  safe as to the issue and now lets its body drop  down fearless of the most violent rockings to  which even a tempest might expose it  Another way of suspending themselves is almost  equally singular with this It may be witnessed  by the reader if he will take the pains to collect  the larva of the common white butterfly found in  abundance upon our cabbage rows and by properly attending to feeding and watching them  this curious proceeding may generally be observed  in a few at least of the number supposing that  the others may have hung themselves up without  being seen in the very act If we were to set a  mountebank to the task this larva has to perform  it may well be doubted whether with the richest  reward before him he could manage to effect it  First he would have to tie both his feet fast to a  branch so that he would swing head downwards  then in order to hang himself in the horizontal  posture he must bend his body up fasten a cord  round the branch in a proper place so as to form  a loop and then put his head and body into it so  that it would support him comfortably just under  the arms Probably the most supplejointed gentleman would find himself discomfited in the  attempt The caterpillar in question however  does all this and more for it has to spin the ropes  with which it is to be suspended Fixing its  hinder part in the manner just described to the  little button of silk which it first forms it then  spins the girth in  which it intends to  trust its safety by  the apparatus of  the mouth Some Horizontal Suspension  times larvas tie themselves in an upright position  as martyrs to a post but the most common  method is the horizontal one  giving the insect the resemblance of a sailor swinging  in his hammock  We must ask attention  before we close our chapter  to one more account of the  proceedings of a larva and  this too is in a common insect   perhaps the housewife  would say a little too common  the meatfly This larva when its days in that  condition are at their close quits its long greedily  devoured and disgusting food and penetrates into  the earth there it contracts its body in a singular manner and its skin becomes thickened and  hard so as to form a sort of parchmentlike case  inside which its jaws are cast off instead of out¬  side as is commonly the rule Were such an  extraordinary transformation as this to happen  to one of the larger animals it would be held forth  as altogether miraculous writes Mr Rennie  Were a lion or an elephant for example to coil  itself up into a ball compressing its skin into  twice the thickness and half the extent while it  remained uniform in shape and without joinings  or openings and at the same time were it entirely to separate its whole body from this skin  lie within it as a kernel does in a nut or a chick  in an egg throwing off its now useless tusks into  a corner and then after a space should it ac¬  quire wings break through its envelope and take  its flight through the air there would be no  bounds to our admiration Yet the very same  circumstances in miniature take place every day  during summer almost under the eye of every  individual in the case of a blowfly without  attracting the attention of one person in a million  So much more are we attracted by great things  than by small  The work of preparation finished the insect  securely buried in its cell or warmly surrounded  by its cocoon or hanging up to the branch of a  tree or in any other way concealed from view or  protected from injury little more remains to be  added to the larva history Its last action after  settling itself in a comfortable position is to cast  off its skin which is generally in the case of those  larvse which inhabit cells or cocoons left inside the  recess sometimes it is cast out The period at  which the insect ceases to belong to the larva  stage and passes into the next varies and will  receive notice in the following chapter  When in the vengeance of God upon the guilty  land of Egypt it pleased Him to send the plague  of insects the exclamation of the magicians was   This is the finger of God Such in an admiring  sense may be ours also as we look back upon what  we perceive God to have done for this humble  portion of His creation in the few past pages  What provision what wonderful forethought and  wisdom has not been exercised upon beings which  man despises or even abhors and which fall  daily by thousands under foot crushed and forgotten except by a few Let us search the green  lanes and hedgerows more assiduouslylet us  poke even into the dirtiest cornerslet us examine  well the leaves and branches in our gardens the  depths of the purling brook the cavities of the  aged trunks and the cracks in the deepfurrowed  barklet us look narrowly upon the cabbages and  nettles as well as upon the rosebush and myrtle  let no place in a word be beneath our scrutiny no  object beneath our notice let us do this and we  shall not need to sigh after foreign scenes or the  majestic wonders of nature for we shall have a  microcosm a world of wonders in a table drawer  and an exhaustless theme of admiration in the  contents of a tumbler of water  PART III THE PUPA  CHAPTER I  THE TRANSFORMATION  Hanging to the slender branch of yonder rose  tree swinging to and fro with the gentle air which  blows in scented waves through the flowergarden  is a little object to which we wish to direct attention Had not notice been thus directed to it in  all probability we should have passed it by if we  observed it at all only considering it to be a  broken twig or withered leaf suspended by a cob¬  web We may examine it minutely but all is  quiet and motionless in the little mass and it is  impossible to detect the least sign of life A casual  eye would rest upon it without interest and would  turn away from it uninstructed as to its nature and  properties In colour it has nothing to attractif  is of a dirty white or brown and in shape it is  though curious so small and so uninviting that  few would take the trouble to pay much attention  to it Day by day it swings from its silken cord  and is to all appearance an object without interest  to all around it  Yet this slumbering unattractive mass contains  a living being Though the aspect of death has  passed upon it and though we may perhaps be un¬  able to detect the symptoms of movement in its  parts it is yet alive and the lapse of a little time  will convert the slumbering being thus singularly  hung up to be the sport of the wind and rain into  a creature more extraordinarily active than per¬  haps any other in the animal creation While  it sleeps great changes are taking place it is  receiving new organs it is being matured developed perfected fitted for a nobler existence and  for a higher range of duties than it has yet  known Such is the pupa  From these remarks it will be sufficiently  evident that this chapter of our insect history has  to speak of a period when there are but few traces  of active existence in the insect and it might  therefore be supposed there remained little to be  said upon a period of the insects life which is only  comparable to a prolonged sleep But entomological science is too rich in interesting matters  upon every subject to admit this conclusion and  we shall find that there is much to be narrated  which equally with what has formerly been  written is calculated to raise our admiration to  the Great and Beneficent Author of all Nature  If we turn to a Latin Dictionary and hunt out  the word which stands at the head of this chapter  Pupa we shall find several definitions of it given  for example a little girl a doll and a baby What  have either of these to do with an insect some  will exclaim and they may feel disposed to con¬  sider the great Linnaeus who gave the insect  tribes while in this stage this title to have been  not over happy in his selection of terms But  those who thus exclaim have perhaps only seen  babies as they are clothed in England possessing  the power and comfort of free movement and  having their arms and legs at liberty Between  the aspect of these little creatures and our insects  no one can trace any resemblance But it is very  different on the continent there out of the  strange notion that it will keep the poor little  beings limbs straight it is the custom to wrap  babies up in swaddling clothes until they can  neither stir hand nor foot and they are  made to resemble Egyptian mummies  as nearly as possible Babies wrapped  up in this cruel and barbarous manner  form objects of so peculiar an appearance that it is quite ludicrous to trace  the resemblance between them and the  pupce of insects and therefore Linnaeus  as it appears could scarcely have selected a better  epithet for the insect than its present title of pupa  as it too has the aspect of being wrapped up in  swaddling bands  But as we formerly mentioned with regard to  larvae all insects in the pupa state are not called  popularly by their scientific and correct name  Those that are closely wrapped up and are in fact  complete mummy insects are called sometimes by  the term Chrysalis or Aurelia because they are  sometimes of a golden lustre the one being derived  from the Latin the other from the Greek term  for i gold and this even when they are not gilded  in this manner Again when as we shall presently have to notice the insect in the pupa state  is still capable of eating or moving or when it does  not lose its legs its popular name is a Nymph As  in the preceding chapter so in this we shall not  regard these terms as they only create a great  amount of confusion but shall adopt the true  term pupa throughout whether the insect spoken  of falls within the one or other of these popular  divisions or not  We traced the larva in the last chapter up to  that period in its history when it enters its cell  or otherwise retires to concealment previous to  its becoming transformed into the pupa Here  immured in darkness and alone it is left to undergo that mysterious struggle of the vital powers  which is to end in producing a new and more  perfect creature out of one which however perfectly adapted to its condition is very far inferior  as regards the completion of its organization to  that which it is destined to become and here we  may appropriately pause to take up the history  of the curious larva so recently described at p 207  as performing the feat of hanging itself up by the  tail from cords spun by its mouth since it exhibits  to us in a striking point of view the shaking off of  the old form of larva and the putting on of the  new one of pupa In addition to this it is per¬  haps one of the most astonishing instances of  animal agility with which we are acquainted  In order to make its manoeuvres and the difficulty of them the more easily comprehended let  us to follow Messrs Kirby and Spence in the  same matter put a case of a somewhat similar  kind before the readers by way of supposition  Country fellows at wakes and fairs frequently  for the diversion of the company there assembled  or for a prize of some value in their estimation  perhaps a fat pig or a leg of muttonrun races  in sacks which are tied close about their necks  and of course tumble about a good deal and dis¬  play anything but a graceful mode of progression   Now say these authors take one of the  most active and adroit of these bind him band  and foot suspend him by the bottom of his sack  with his head downwards to the branch of a lofty  tree make an opening in one side of the sack  and set him to extricate himself from it to detach  it from its hold and suspend himself by his feet  in its place Though endowed with the suppleness  of an Indian juggler and promised his sack full of  gold for a reward you would set him an absolute  impossibility yet this is what our caterpillars instructed by a Beneficent Creator easily perform  Let us proceed to show in what manner the  caterpillar performs this wondrous feat After  suspending itself in the way already described  a little time generally elapses during which the  insect by turns contracts itself and then dilates  again At length its skin splits near its head and  a portion of the pupa appears which acts like a  wedge and being thrust partly through the slit  causes it to tear still higher and higher towards  the tail The insect continues its painful labours  swelling and contracting alternately so as to push  the torn skin higher and higher up as one would  roll off a stocking until at length the old skin is  folded into several rolls and is quite at the tail  But the task is as yet only half accomplished the  most arduous and difficult part remains to be done  The pupa is shorter than the larva and consequently hangs out of reach of the silken button  in which the latter was firmly fixed by its hind  legs It seems now as if the poor insect must fall  for there appears no way for it to get up to the  silk anchorage and the folds of the pushedup  old skin are all that retain it in its position which  as may be imagined is far from a secure kind of  fastening How is it to disengage itself from its  ease and be suspended in the air while it climbs up  to take its place Without arms or legs to support  itself the anxious spectator expects to see it fall  to the earth His fears however are groundless  the supple segments of the pupas abdomen serve  in the place of arms Between two of these as  with a pair of pincers it seizes on a portion of  the skin and bending its body once more entirely  extricates its tail from it It is now wholly out  of the skin against one side of which it is sup¬  ported but yet at some distance from the leaf  the next step it must take is to climb up to the  required height For this purpose it repeats the  same ingenious manoeuvre making its cast skin  serve as a sort of ladder it successively with its  different segments seizes a higher and a higher  portion until in the end it reaches the summit  where with its tail it feels for the silken threads  that are to support it The tail is provided  with a number of minute hooks which catch in  the meshes of the silken button and the pupa  thrusting it into the meshes of this button feels  quite secure as to the result and drops safely into  the perpendicular position dangling in the air as  gaily as did the larva before it But its old skin  This Cut shows the entire change from the first rupture of the skin to the casting  away of the old skin  still clings to it and seems greatly to annoy it by its  presence remembered that the legs of this skin are still  firmly attached to the silk in consequence of their  hooklike form it will be evident that this also is  a task of some arduousness In order to get rid  of it it jerks itself about in various directions  and spins round very rapidlydoubtless the reader  has often seen the insect in this act and has wondered what was its object in whirling round after  this mannerby this means at length the castskin  appears loosed from its hold and drops off The  whole proceeding from first to last is represented  in our ensravino The little hooks of the tail of  the pupa are represented in the adjoining  cut much enlarged  Well does Reaumur exclaim These manoeuvres of withdrawing its tail from the old  skin of climbing up the old skin and of hooking  its tail in the silken buttonand as we might  add of whirling itself and in other ways agitating  itself to get rid of its old skin are manoeuvres  so delicate and perilous that we cannot help won¬dering how an insect which only executes them  once in its life should execute them so well and  we are led to the inevitable conclusion that it  has been thus taught by a Great and Allwise  Master  The manner in which other larva cast their  skins and become pupa when they enter their cell  cannot be described as they perform this act in  all the privacy and darkness of their solitary  habitations but in all probability it differs in no  respect from the manner in which the same creatures cast their skins when they moult excepting  that the new being which emerges from the cast  skin is no longer a larva but a pupa  The time occupied by the creature in its process  of change differs in different species In some it  is short in others it is long Generally it does  not exceed a few days We are told however of  the larva of some insects which are six months  before they become pupa The Baron de Geer  tells us with surprise of the larva of a moth  which he had watched It became a larva and  spun its cocoon in the month of August 1746  and was attentively kept during the winter The  spring came but the larva still remained a larva  and did not show any signs of changing its form  and winter came again finding it still a larva the  second winter passed and it was not until April  1748 that is more than eighteen months after  it first became a larva and entered its cocoon that  it underwent the change and became a pupa some  time afterwards it became a perfect insect  CHAPTER II  WHAT IS A PUPA  But it may now be asked What is a pupa and  what are the differences between it and a larva  and between it and the perfect insect It is very  necessary that this should be clearly understood  and to that end we shall endeavour to render our  explanation as simple as possible But it will be  far better than the best description if the reader  will be persuaded to watch these changes through¬  out himself The butterfly tribe furnish the very  best illustrations in the world and by merely  collecting a few caterpillars from the wayside or  from the kitchengarden a source of amusement  will be opened which will a thousandfold repay  the trouble and time consumed in the occupation  Of all other ways personal observation when it  is so readily to be effected as in the case of these  insects is the best and most impressive method of  becoming acquainted with the Life of an Insect  Such knowledge is far more entertaining than  bookknowledge and is much more agreeable to  acquire and more easy to retain  We must guard our definition of what a pupa  is by reminding the reader that some insects with  which he is very familiar do not pass through this  change in the same manner that the majority of  insects do that is in a state of torpor or sleep  If he were to rear up a spider from the egg and  were to watch for the time when it would become  a still lifelesslooking object like that which we  have called a pupa he would assuredly be disappointed and he might accuse this little work of  leading him into error because it declares that all  insects must pass through the pupa state before  they become perfect in their form and number of  their parts Yet that very spider has passed  through both the larva and the pupa state under  the observers eye without his being able to recognise the fact simply because in both these states  it is very like the perfect insect and can walk  about and eat just as usual In fact it is more  than probable that spiders of the same kind in  these different conditions could scarcely be recogmsec so as to say that they were pupae or perfect  insects even by tolerable entomologists and it is  very likely that mistakes of this kind have often  occurred We learn therefore from this statement that some pupae are active and move about  just as they did before although they are in the  pupa state  In a great number of cases then a pupa is a  state in an insects life when it rests from active  exertion and from taking food and when under¬  neath the dry and withered skin a series of great  changes are taking place which are preparing it for  its future life in the perfect state Thus it differs  from the larva state in not eating and moving and  in the important particularthat it is receiving  new parts and organs which are added to it under  the skin It also differs from the perfect insect in  the same respects as in the first place from the  larva and also in the important circumstance that  the perfect insect the moment it enters that state  has no more organs added to itit is in fact  perfect while the pupa is imperfect Let us place  these differences in a tabular form  The Larva  The Pupa  The Perfect Insect  Moves about and eats  Does not move about  Moves about and eats  Has no new organs  nor eat  Has no new organs  added to it beyond  Has several new organs  added to it beyond  those acquired in the  added to it to prepare  those obtained in the  egg  it for the perfect state  pupa state  Let ns repeat our caution that this definition is  only applicable to inactive pupae In the active  pupae the same development of new organs takes  place but it does not interfere with the usual  actions of life We must also add that some of  the pupae which we must call inactive never¬  the less are not wholly without motion but are  capable of manifesting that life is in them death¬  like though they appear by slightly moving the  lower part of the body All inactive pupae how¬  ever are without the power of moving about  At the risk of being thought tedious it has  been indispensably necessary to be thus precise  upon this point a little careful study of these two  or three pages will fix the distinctive characters of  the pupa firmly in the readers memory and will  enable him to find the account given of its history  clear easy and interesting  Having thus defined what the pupa state is let  us take up one of these withered objects and by  a little gentle treatment with the assistance of a  delicate scissors a sharp pointed penknife of very  keen edge and two or three pins we shall succeed  in unrolling the insect mummy In order to obtain  the best sight of what the pupa case contains it  will be advisable to select as large a pupa as can  be procured Those of the butterfly tribe are  well suited for this purpose If we are pretty  fortunate in our dissections we shall succeed in  discovering that within the membranelike skin  there is exhibited a beautiful spectacle of order  and neatness The legs and wings and other  external appendages are folded down close to the  body of the insect The feet are often crossed  smoothly over the breast and the wings are  flattened against the side of the body the antennas  are also neatly arranged parallel with the legs  and altogether the insect presents a very singular  appearance from the fact of all its organs being  thus smoothed down compressed into the smallest  as in the specimen figured  The appearance of the  folded limbs is indistinctly exhibited in the  companion pupa All the  parts of the perfect insect  can be distinctly traced  if the pupa is sufficiently  matured  Pupce  By gently using a fine needle the wings antennae and legs can be separated from the side of  the body and made to exhibit somewhat of their  natural appearance but as yet every part is  widely different from the corresponding parts in  the perfect being The legs are shapeless the antennas are imperfect and the wingsthose glorious  organs of the complete conditionare as yet  devoid of their splendid tints being of a greyish  colour and exhibiting little resemblance to the elegant form afterwards to distinguish them  Strange to say every organ in this pupa is  enclosed in a sheath of membrane The head of  the insect is covered by a case the delicate  antennae however long or fine have their cases or  sheaths even the eyes are provided with them  They exist also upon the trunk wings and legs  and tongue or proboscis These cases must not  be mistaken for the general outer case which  covers the whole insect they are separate from  that and cover the organs in question closely  after the manner of a glove  If we were to open a pupa within a few hours  after it had assumed this state we should find its interior filled with a milky fluid in the midst of which  its future limbs and organs are seen very distinctly  but are as yet in a most fragile or even half fluid  state At a little later period this fluid disappears  and hardens into a sort of glue which partly fastens  down the tender limbs into their proper position  until the appointed time comes for the insect to  burst from its sleep and live and from which the  case which covers them is formed From the ac¬  count thus given of the contents of the pupacase  it will be apparent that the pupa possesses when  perfect all the organs of the complete insect head  eyes antennas wings legs c and is in fact only  different from it in that it is still inactive to a great  extent and still a prisoner within its cell of membrane In a little while the bonds which keep it  in the tomb will be broken and the slumberer shall  rise a glorious creature to the enjoyment of all the  happiness of a new condition of existence  Perhaps few things would cause a person ignorant of insect life more amazement than if we  were to hold before his eyes some of the varieties  of pupoB in one hand and the perfect insect in the  other and were then seriously to assure him  that both were the same  creatures in reality Can  it be possible he might  exclaim i This dry brown  little mass with these singular knobs and this elegant  and delicate figurethese the  same being Nor when we  look at the various figures of  pup® should we be much  surprised at his exclamation  in one of the cases at the British Museum is a  very large pupa which we have had engraved  and which is here presented to the reader In  this curious creature the folding up of the limbs  insect with its gaudy wings  is very obvious and some idea of its strange  aspect may be formed from the representation of  it here given The pupae of several moths are  very singular in shape In some there is a sort  of little hook which sticks out from the head  and seems as if it were intended to hang up the  creature by In others there is a kind of nose  attached to the head giving it a droll appearance  The cause of these protuberances is the long  tongue of these moths which as it is much longer  than their bodies could not of course be contained  in the pupa case unless it was folded up it is  therefore neatly folded up and packed into these  receptacles where it is stowed away until by the  insect awakening to active life this singular instrument becomes necessary to them when it is with¬  drawn The older naturalists who loved to find  out mimicries of all kinds in nature used to be  fond of painting pupae with human faces on  account of the frequent resemblance to a Roman  nose which is found among them Goedart a  celebrated naturalist has drawn several which we  are sure will excite the merriment of our readers  and we have therefore shown these remarkable  creatures as represented by him in the adjoining cut  One is a respectablelooking old gentlemans face  with his hair brushed up very primly off his fore¬  head Another resembles a mermaid for it has  the head of a lady and something like a cap but its  tail is more like that of a fish The others are  quite caricatures It is the introduction of a  dot to represent the eye which gives the resemblance to the face in these figures without it they  are by no means strikingly like the face Madame  Merian has favoured us also with some very curious  drawings of pupae of the insects of Surinam which  appear more natural than those of the last author  and present a very fantastic aspect by reason of  the curious projections which stick out from their  heads A few of these are represented below  Curious Pupa From Madame Merians work on the Insects of Surinam  As in the case of the larva so with the pupa if  it is found in a dark situation it will probably be  destitute of colour or at any rate it will only be  of a yellowish white such pupae when taken out  of their natural hidingplace and exposed to the  sunlight become of a dark colour Indeed the  majority of pupae are without any of the gay  colouring which distinguishes the previous condition of the insect It seems as if it had been  thought unnecessary to deck in gorgeous raiment  the cerements of what we might call the tomb  of the insect But there are some beautiful exceptions to this rule The pupae of most butterflies  which are suspended in open day are of a green  or yellowish brown colour Some however are  painted in fairer colours and a still greater number  are speckled with glittering spots of golden hue  and shine as though gilded with the purest leaves  of that precious metal and burnished Hence as  before explained the Latin and Greek terms of  aurelia and chrysalis for the pupae of these insects  The gilding makes them very attractive objects  being applied now in streaks now in spots and  occasionallyand this in the very common pupa  of the butterfly whose caterpillar or larva feeds on  the nettlethey are entirely covered with this  splendid coat The shade of gilding ranges in the  depth of its tone from a very pale yellow to the  full lustre of virgin gold No wonder that those  who mistook the object of chemistry in trying to  turn all things into gold were attracted by these  glittering things and actually believed these spots  to be of real gold and hence imagined that they  had found out an argument in nature for the trans¬  mutation of common metals into that coveted one  But a little experiment which it is in the power  of any one to perform would soon have undeceived  them and taught them the truth of the proverb  All is not gold that glitters By infusing a portion  of saffron in hot water and straining it off after a  little time and adding to the rich yellow liquor  thus obtained a few lumps of pure gum Arabic  a sort of gilding varnish will be obtained which  if applied to a bright shilling will give it very  much of a golden appearance owing to the shining  of the metal showing through a transparent film  of a golden colour The gilded look of the pupa  was found by Reaumur to be produced in the  same way by the shining white membrane of the  inner skin showing through the outer skin which  is of a transparent yellow  In the Transactions of the Linmean Society for  1833 the Rev L Guilding describes a very  curious pupa the case of which resembles pearl  These little bodies are found in abundance in  the island of Antigua and are often sent home  to Europe under the name of groundpearl  as distinguished from the ordinary fisherypearl  They are devoured by turkeys and fowls until  the birds are nearly choked with them when  the remedy is to pour vinegar down the throat  Ground Pearl The Insect and its Case magnified  which dissolves the pearls and sets the poor bird  at ease They are strung into necklaces and  purses by the ladies of the Bahamas They long  caused much perplexity to naturalists but they  were ultimately found to be really only the pupae  of a little insect which appears to infest the ants  those voracious creatures and thus to keep down  their numbers A representation of the ground  pearl and the insect within is annexed  CHAPTER III  RESPIRATION OF THE PUPA  Having glanced at these particulars in the  history of the pupa we come to the important  question Does the pupa in this torpid con¬  dition still breathe as the larva did or not  On a careful examination we might detect with  the help of a magnifying glass the same breathing  holes or spiracles spoken of on page 161 as appertaining to the larva and were we sufficiently  skilful to dissect the pupa we should find much  the same arrangement of airtubes within the  body In the absence of all other means of ascertaining the fact we should be warranted in concluding from the presence of these organs alone  that the pupa has the faculty of breathing no less  than the larva M Reaumur has given a beautiful  description of the breathingholes or spiracles of  the pupa and has represented them in an engraving  of which a copy is furnished at page 161 lie  found that they are protected by little valve  like contrivances just as our mouths are protected  by our lips and these can be opened or closed at  pleasure by the creature so that if plunged into  water that fluid cannot enter the insects body for  all its little doorsand there are no fewer than  eighteen of themare fast shut Singular to say  however if plunged into oil the oil has the power  of entering them and the pupie may be thus  drowned  It is very easy to put the fact of the breathing  of the pupa inanimate as it appears to a certain  test By taking a wineglass half full of water  and putting it under an airpump and then exhausting the air we shall be able to extract the  air which exists dissolved in the water or some  water that has been boiled and allowed to cool  will do as well If we now put a pupa into this  water and again exhaust the air from the receiver  we shall notice at the second stroke of the piston  a number of little jets of air come from the insects  body at the places where the spiracles are situated  thus clearly proving that the creature breathes air  by this apparatus The fact may be tested also  in another wayand both this and the preceding  experiment are due to the ingenious Reaumur  He took the pupa of a butterfly and suspending  it by a thread immersed it half way down in oil  on taking it out after some time it was still alive  and apparently uninjured the reason being that  the entire number of its breathingholes were not  covered He took another of the same species  and plunged it entirely under the oil and taking  it out after a time it was found to be quite dead  in fact it had been suffocated by the air being shut  out from its breathing apparatus and that as  effectually as if it had been one of ourselves lying  at the bottom of the sea We may say therefore  with perfect accuracy that though the pupa this  seemingly unliving object neither moves nor  eats nor in any other way gives us a sign that it  is alive except in a few cases and that in its  advanced stages we can nevertheless prove it to  be living as it can be shown that it has the power  of breathing and if it breathes it lives  We may take the liberty of appropriately appending to this statement a most interesting and  delightfullytold anecdote from the pages of the  Baron de Geer of an insect whose larva lives in  the water blit whose pupa is an airbreathing  creature and consequently would perish if the  change from larva to pupa were to take place  under water without some especial contrivance  to furnish it in the pupa form with a supply of air  Yet how can this be when the insect is under  water the whole time up to its becoming a perfect  moth We shall hear   At the commencement of spring as soon as  the frost and ice had disappeared I sauntered out  one day to procure some fresh plants from the  bottom of a stream in order to feed some of my  caterpillars with them Between the leaves of  these aquatic plants I presently found a large  number of aquatic larvae which had there safely  passed through the rigorous season just gone by  I took a number of them and put them in some  boxes where they eat the leaves with which I fed  them There they grew larger from day to day  although by slow degrees I tended them until  June in the same year without perceiving any  other change in their appearance than that they  had grown to a considerable size But at the  commencement of this month I noticed that they  became very uneasy they forsook their leaves  and wandered about the sides of the boxes which  contained water Sometimes they would creep  out of the water and again would go into it They  seemed as if they were in search of something  which they had lost It was now evident that  their object was to find some convenient place in  which to undergo their transformation into pupae  but they did not like the boxes in which they  were confined and several even died I began to  despair of seeing their metamorphosis which gave  me much regret as I had a great desire to become  acquainted with their whole history In order  to satisfy myself I went on the 26 th of June  to the spot from whence I had taken them in  order to discover perchance some larvas about to  become pupae and to ascertain the places they  selected in which to undergo their change I had  the gratification of being completely successful  and of discovering not only the larvae but even  several of them which had shut themselves up in  silken cocoons and had not yet undergone their  transformation  cf The month of June appears therefore to be  the period when these larvre prepare for their  change of form They do not leave the water to  accomplish it the change taking place under  water They attach themselves to the leaves of  some of the younger aquatic plants which are at  a suitable depth from the surface of the water  By means of several silken cords the insect fastens  together two and sometimes even three leaves  between which it spins an oval cocoon composed  of very white silk This cocoon is of a double  structure the true inner cocoon which is very  white is placed within an outer envelope of silk  of a greyish or brownish colour The envelope  extends considerably beyond the sides of the true  The Cut represents two leaves between which the Worm lies the Cocoon itself and the Larva  cocoon which lies loosely in it and towards one  end there is a wide opening in it the inner cocoon  being perfectly closed in on every side The cut  on the next page represents the perfect insect and  the pupa thus carefully provided for  In this inner cocoon there is not so much as a  single drop of water The pupa could not exist  in it if it were not  full of air and the  difficulty is how to  fill a little cell with  air which is already  buried many inches  under and on every  Pupa and perfect Insect  side surrounded by water De Geer states that he  did not find a particle of water in all the cocoons  which he opened In order to ascertain whether or  not it was really necessary for the pupa to be thus  carefully housed in a silken ball full of air beneath  the water he took out several pupae and put them  into some water in a saucer At first they swam  but presently they sank to the bottom They  lived for several days but ultimately every one  died showing plainly that the aircell was absolutely necessary to their existence  Yet although these pupae were airbreathing  creatures strange to say De Geer found that if  taken from their little cells out of the water they  shrivelled up and died He put several in a dry  box and invariably found that in a short time they  were dead He imagined with great probability  that the cause of their death was the evaporation  of their fluids which of course does not take place  when they are enshrouded in their cocoons and  surrounded on all sides with water He made  one more experiment with them which was as  follows He took several out of their cocoons and  placed them in water in such a manner that one  of their sides was in the air while the other was in  the water he kept them for a considerable time  in this position and he had the pleasure at its  expiration of seeing them become perfect insects  just as if they had never left their cocoons The  necessity of both air and water to their wellbeing  was thus clearly proved  How can we sufficiently admire the ingenuity  and skill displayed by this insect in the execution  of its difficult task When a human engineer  wishes to build under the water he must have  recourse to the most cumbrous and powerful  mechanism to enable him to effect his object  Piles must be driven into the bed of the river so  closely as scarcely to allow any water to come  through a steamengine must be fixed close by  to pump out all the water from the space thus  enclosed and a number of men must labour hard  to stop up the chinks where the water comes  pouring in Thus men and machines of great  power and in sufficient number are requisite to  enable the most expert engineer to form a cavity  at the bottom of the rivers bed What if we were  to give him as a problem to build a cell which  should be perfectly watertight and filled with air  without allowing him to employ any of these  means and to insist that it should all be done with¬  out his coming up to the surface of the water at all  for anything He would probably tell us it was  impossible Not so the insect it though on all  sides surrounded with water actually spins a web  in the waves and fastens it by cables of sufficient  strength to adjoining plants and afterwards forms  a watertight cell in which it shuts itself safely up  secure against the invasion of enemies or the intrusion of a drop from the element in which its  cell floats and is moored  All pupae of aquatic habits do not however  possess this remarkable faculty of surrounding  themselves with air even in the midst of the water  and these would certainly perish unless means  existed for them also to inhale the vital air These  means are found in the endowment of them with  the power of swimming Surely our readers must  often have seen the wriggling movements of certain little blackish objects which are to be found  in every stagnant puddle in the summer Many  of these are the pupae of various species of gnats  and when we watch them come darting upwards  by a succession of flaps with their tail until they  reach the surface where they remain for a short  time we see the means by which although they  live immersed in water they are enabled to breathe  the air For if we scrutinized them a little narrowly we might detect on each side of their  largest extremity or head a pair of minute tubes  which open into the air at the surface of the water  It may sink beneath the water for a time without  inconvenience and it is soon found plunging  upwards anxiously seeking to thrust its tubes into  the air In the larva state the gnat breathes by  its tail in the pupa state by its head l The pupae  of some aquatic insects breathe like the larvae  of the same insects by organs like gills That of  the ephemera shown on the last page is an  instance  The curious apparatus of a telescopelike air  tube of the rattailed insects described in a former  page will not be forgotten by the reader It may  interest him to learn that there is another little  creature which in the pupa state is furnished with  a somewhat similar apparatus These pupae have  not the same power of swimming with the last  and therefore require a special provision to meet  the necessities of their case They are plunged  some way down in the water and air is conveyed  to them by a hollow taillike tube which is always  found to open on the surface of the water It is  a curious thing to contemplate these little creatures so beautifully provided for in this manner  Secure of all they need in the supplies of air furnished to them by their tube they rest peacefully  in the waters unmoved by any of the accidents  which occur to surrounding creatures and patiently awaiting the hour which is to behold them  rise from their watery bier never more to return  Let us so likewise rest in assurance of our Heavenly Fathers love and care for us knowing that  every want will be supplied to his children by  Him who lias said I will never leave thee nor  forsake thee  CHAPTER IV  VARIETIES AND AGE OF THE PUPA  Although we are anxious not to attach too  much importance to mere names in this little  work and rather to keep the readers attention  fixed upon the really essential truths of the Life of  an Insect it is expedient that we should mention  that while all pupaa may be divided into the two  classes active and inactive yet there are several  very striking variations in them which are more  remarkable than those of larvae These it is  proper here to mention in order that the reader  may be spared the perplexity which would other¬  wise ensue were he to imagine that all inactive  or all active pupae were pretty much alike Let  it never however be forgotten that it is no matter  what the variation in form may be nor does it  matter whether the insect is active or inactive  while in this state of passage from the larva to  the perfect form it is always neither more nor  less than a pupa Through this stage all perfect in ¬  sects pass although they may put on various forms  and aspects while they are in it and may possess  various and perhaps very opposite faculties  during its continuance If this important fact is  borne in mind there will be no risk of being mis¬  led by the confusion of sounds and names which  some have been pleased to encumber insect history  with  In order to form a clear conception of these  variations reference may be made to the en¬  graving on the next page in which we have caused  to be represented the five different kinds of pupae  as they were named and classified by Linnaeus  This plate will sufficiently manifest the necessity  of an explanation upon the subject of the variations of pupae for few persons in examining it  would form the remotest idea that all the insects  there represented are really and truly in the pupa  state Some look so like the perfect insect that  it would be almost impossible for any one only  slightly acquainted with insect history to believe  them to be in what is in reality a transition stage  from the larva to the perfect form  I The insect No 1 is a pupa called the Complete because it is active and has many of the parts  of the perfect insect The pupa of the spider is  an instance  II The insect No 2 is a pupa called the  Halfcomplete or  semi complete  It is also active  resembles the  perfect insect  but has only the  rudiments of  wings The  grasshopper is  an instance of  this kind of pupa  III The insect No 3 is a pupa called the  Incomplete It is inactive but possesses rudiments  of legs and wings The common wasp is represented as an example of this kind  IV The insect No 4 is a pupa called the  Obtected This pupa has its upper portion en¬  cased in the peculiar manner represented the  chest and lower portion being distinct The but¬  terfly pupa belongs to this division  V The insect No 5 is a pupa called the  Coarctate In this case the pupa is enclosed within  its larva skin which forms a globular or oval case  the pupa lying loosely in it as if it had shrunk to  a smaller size The pupa of the blowfly is an  example  Such are the five variations of pupae as they  Avere recognised by Linnaeus the Complete  Halfcomplete Incomplete Obtected and Coarctate  They are sufficiently minute for ordinary purposes  and it will possibly save the reader some confusion  of ideas to endeavour to fix them in the memory  so that when looking at an insect whose pupa state  may not be so very characteristic as that of the  blowfly or butterfly he may still be able to say  with confidence that although it is unlike these it  is nevertheless a pupa On all subjects nothing  is of so much importance as clearness of ideas  It is better to know only a feAV things and to  understand them clearly than to have a confused  and indistinct knowledge of a great number It  lias been therefore simply and entirely with a  view to obviate this state of things in the mind  that these definitions of the different kinds of  pupa which may have appeared not altogether  interesting have been given  Having fulfilled this duty we may now proceed  to the more agreeable task of ascertaining some  interesting facts relative to the insects life and  age in the pupa state We have already seen that  the insect in the larva state often arrives at a  very respectable old age indeed in this state  insects live longer than either in the pupa or  perfect states But pupae also attain to a very  fair number of days sometimes living as long as  two years in that state Often however they are  not more than a few days in this condition and  the insect after a short repose springs forth a  new and active being But it has been found that  insects live a longer or shorter period in the pupa  state according as the temperature of the air is  cold or hot Thus for example when the larva  of a moth has become a pupa in the early part of  summer the pupa state will generally not last  beyond a fortnight But if on the other hand  the larva becomes a pupa late in the autumn the  pupa state will last until June in the next year  thus manifestly teaching us that according as the  weather is mild and genial the pupa state will be  shortened or according as it is cold and rigorous  it will be increased in duration The ingenious  Reaumur determined to put these singular facts  to an experimental test and as his results are in  the highest degree interesting and important we  shall proceed to submit an abstract of them to  the readers notice  In casting about for the means of exposing the  pupae he was about to experiment on to a warm  and equable temperature Reaumur determined to  conduct his first experiments in the Royal Conservatories which were always carefully heated  and in which as he with French naivete expresses  it e summer reigned in the depths of winter In  the month of January he carried thither a number  of boxes containing pupae of different species The  result was precisely what he had expectedin  the midst of a severe winter a number of butter¬  flies appeared in his boxes many of which would  not naturally have made their appearance until  the months of May August or even September  thus shortening the pupa state from four seven or  eight months to a fortnight or to five or to six  weeks in different instances Five or six days  seemed to be equal to a month of the natural  temperature The butterflies thus developed were  in no respect different from those which are  brought into activity at the natural period  They were as active and perfect as if their time  and place of birth had been the green fields  instead of amidst the strange vegetation of these  splendid Conservatories Several of the mother  insects deposited their eggs accomplishing the last  act of their existence as if summer had come and  died while the frosts and snow held all external  nature yet in bondage Not only therefore was  the duration of the pupa state in these insects  shortened but their whole life was thus abridged  by several months  In November of the same year Reaumur re¬  commenced his experiments and again exposed a  number of pupae to the genial influence of these  hothouses The result was the same In the  first week in December butterflies appeared which  would not in natural circumstances have been  developed earlier than the May of the next year  There were some pupae in particular whose development lie watched with great interest These  pupae belonged to a beautiful species of moth  which has two broods in a year that is it lays  eggs in May which become butterflies in July  and then again lays eggs which become pupae in  August or September but do not become butterflies until the following June He was curious  to see whether this second brood instead of  waiting for several months would like the first  disclose its butterflies in a considerably shorter  time now that it was exposed to the warmth of  the Conservatory Such actually proved to be the  case and thus two generations of these butter¬  flies were obtained in one year Alluding to the  depredations of caterpillars he quaintly remarks  cc This certainly is not a secret which appears very  profitable at present but who can tell whether  that which is useless to us today may not possibly become of value tomorrow Could we  discover some new species of larvae which would  supply us with as good a silk as that of the silk¬  worm and might be more easy to rear but which  only produced one generation in each year and if  it lived upon leaves which could be found all the  year through we might avail ourselves of this  means of increasing the number of its broods  This remark deserves much consideration  He was now anxious to try whether by apply¬  ing a more equable method of warming he could  succeed in hatching pupa as he had done in the  hothouse The idea occurred to him of endeavouring to hatch them under a lien He concluded  that the warmth of the mothers breast would quite  as easily hatch the insects as it does the eggs  But there was this obstacle in the way How  could he prevent the fragile and tender bodies of  the insect pupae from being crushed and killed by  the weight of the hens body and as we would  also suggest How could he ensure that the bird  would not actually have eaten up the objects of  his care Aware of the fact that when a hen is  in the humour to sit she will often allow smooth  stones to be placed among her own eggs he  anticipated no difficulty on that score and he  hit upon the following ingenious experiment  He procured some hollow glass balls which he had  caused to be made as nearly as possible similar in  size and shape to the eggs themselves Into these  by an opening at one end he introduced seven or  eight pupae and stopped the mouth up with a  cork but so as to allow a free communication with  the external air by paring off a piece from the  side of the cork  Thus prepared he put the glass egg together  with the others in the nest The hen was a little  more sensible than Reaumur had given her credit  for and though she did not thrust the egg out of  her nest she removed it to the outside where she  was so obliging as to permit it to remain and as  it was here just as warm as if it had been in the  centre of the eggs Reaumur did not attempt to  interfere with her arrangements A great deal of  moisture arose from the bodies of the pupae and  condensed like dew on the sides of the glass but  after a day or two this disappeared The reader  may now be anxious to learn the result of this  experiment It was equally successful indeed  it was more so than the preceding for in the  afternoon of the tenth day a pretty little butterfly  was seen within his glass egg being the first that  had appeared of the eight pupae and the first  ever hatched under the bosom of a hen The  remaining pupae all but two appeared soon after  these two died Perhaps the warmth of their  glassy cell was too violent for them for it was  found by the thermometer to be two or three  degrees above blood heat The whole six pupa  were born in less than six days while others of the  same species in a box in a windowseat were not  developed until twelve days later As the heat  thus obtained seemed too violent for pupa to be  artificially reared with success Reaumur suggests  that many variations might be made in the expe¬  riments which would have the effect of moderating  its amount These experiments decided in the  most satisfactory manner the quickening influence  of increased warmth upon the pupa of insects  Reaumur now became anxious to try the effects  of the opposite state of temperature and to  ascertain whether exposure to cold would exer¬  cise any effect upon the pupse It was reason¬  able to imagine that as warmth had hastened  forward their development cold would retard it  Reaumur determined to try what would be the  result of putting his pupa in their boxes in a  cellar and taking proper care to preserve them  from the damps of such a situation He put them  there about the end of January In ordinary  circumstances these pupse would have become  butterflies in the month of July in the same year  July came and we can conceive the curiosity with  which the ingenious experimenter went down as he  tells us to his cellars to see if any change had taken  place in the pupae July passed away August  also passed by yet the pupae still slumbered on in  their original form Reaumur left Paris in Sep¬  tember and did not return until the November  following He immediately went in quest of his  pupacharge and found them still unaltered  Were they dead Placing one in his hand it  soon began to exhibit such symptoms of motion  as plainly showed that it was alive Winter  closed over them still in the pupa form The  spring of the next year dawned upon them but  they were insensible to its influences £C And even  now cries Reaumur in the month of August just  two years from the time they left the larva form  and became pupae they are in perfect health in  excellent condition and would all become butter¬  flies very soon if I were only to expose them to  a warm summers influence   These extraordinary facts observe Messrs  Kirby and Spence lead us to a very singular  and unexpected conclusionthat we have the  power of lengthening or shortening the life of many  insects at pleasurethat we can cause one individual to live more than twice as Ion2 as another of  the same species and vice versa Had Paracelsus  made this discovery it would have led him to  pursue his researches after the elixir of immortality with redoubled confidence and would have  supplied him with an argument for the possibility  of prolonging the life of man beyond its usual  term which his sceptical opponents would have  found some difficulty in rebutting Even the  logical Reaumur seems inclined to infer from it  that this object of the alchemists was not so  chimerical as we are wont to conclude He con¬  fesses however that if it were to be attained only  by the same process as effects the extension of an  insects lifeby prolonging its state of torpor  and insensibilityfew would choose to enjoy it on  such conditions The man of pleasure might perhaps not object to a sleep of a hundred years in  the hope of finding something new under the sun  when he awakened and an ardent astronomer  would probably commit himself with scientific  joy to a repose as long and as sound as that of the  Seven Sleepers for the chance of viewing his  predicted return of a comet on stepping out of  his cave But ordinary mortals would consign  themselves to the perils of so long a night with  reluctance apprehending a fate no better than  that which befel the magician who ordered  himself to be cut in small pieces and put in  pickle with the expectation of becoming young  again  But this is in every respect erroneous as a deduction from these experiments on insects It must not  be forgotten that these experiments were made at  a time of the insects life when it is naturally  torpid and not upon the perfect insect Had  Beaumur attempted to prolong the life of a butterfly he would have failed completely that is if  he had adopted the same means so that all which  Ave can infer from these results is simply this that  we can only prolong or shorten the pupa state  Avhich is a state of torpidity a kind of halfway  between life and death The human frame knows  no such state after birth as can be properly compared to the inactive pupa state of insects and  consequently all reasoning founded on what may  take place in such a state under the particular  circumstances described is without foundation  Besides all this God has himself fixed a limit to  human life and we are expressly assured by his  word of truth that it is appointed unto man  once to die and though by reason of strength we  may reach far into a long life yet the hour comes  at last and the green earth closes over the only  mortal portion of a man Undoubtedly had  Reaumur prolonged his experiments he would  have found that death or the transformation of  the pupa would ultimately have taken place  As yet we are not aware that any practical  results on a large scale have followed from  Reaumurs interesting experiments It has been  already remarked that in countries where the silk¬  worm is reared it is the custom to hasten the  hatching of the eggs by women carrying little  packets of them about their person But this is  only to bring forward the development of the  larva state Perhaps the time anticipated by  Reaumur may arrive when insects may be hatched  under hens or in hatching machines so as to  obtain two instead of one brood of eggs and  larva in a season Reaumur suggests that the  great and wealthy who have good hothouses  might give all the appearance of summer to them  by introducing pupa in winter which would soon  be hatched and butterflies or other insects might  be seen flying about in December or January  from flower to flower But he forgot that gardeners generally are rather averse to the presence  of insects at all and particularly to the alldevouring larva of many species of butterflies which  would soon commit sad havoc among their choicest  plants We may recommend such experiments  to the reader as highly interesting and easy  of performance in a common sittingroom where  a fire is kept in winter with no other apparatus  than a tinbox or a glass jar of very moderate  size even a pillbox would answer every purpose  Some curious experiments on pupa of another  kind were also performed by Reaumur He varnished them over with various varnishes and  found that the pupa thus varnished were developed several weeks later than others of the  same species unvarnished He tried similar experiments upon eggs and found that the eggs of a  hen would keep fresh for a very long period if  they were entirely coated with some kind of  varnish This proved a most useful experiment  for it is now common all over the Continent to  preserve eggs by covering them either with oil or  butter  We may learn in reflecting upon the facts  brought to light by this ingenious entomologist  with what admirable care and skill the Great  Creator has arranged the period to be occupied  by the insect in the pupa state It has been  wisely ordained by these arrangements that the  insect shall not be developed until the season when  its proper food is to be found or when a proper  position for placing its eggs is to be discovered  The gay flutterer so tender in its frame must  not be born amid the snows of winter or in the  ungenial days of early spring its pupa therefore requires the warm influences of July and  August before it will undergo its change If it  were born earlier than that time it would unquestionably perish and the insect would become  extinct if later the same result would take  place for it would fall into the killing power of  the early winter evenings As it is all is well  The insect and the day are made for one another  for it the flower blossoms and the warm air  breathes and all nature is spread out in warmth  and happiness Its career run through it de¬  parts from the scene it has enlivened leaving  behind just at the proper time and in the proper  place the eggs which are to become quickened  live and die like itself all in their appointed  time We thus perceive that it is chiefly the  increasing temperature of the air which fixes the  time of the insects duration as a pupa and sets in  movement all the great chain of the events of external nature In what way an increase of warmth  thus acts we are still unable to say perhaps indeed  we may never be able to tell Neither can we un¬  derstand how it should be that the principle of life  should be ready at a moments notice to complete  its work in the perfection of the insect and yet  held in abeyance by a few degrees of a lower or  quickened into activity by a few degrees higher  temperature We know that this has been Gods  doing and marvellous it is in our eyes but  the wisest of men feels himself ignorant if asked  the question how it is thus arranged Truly  none but a God infinite in wisdom as well as  love would take such thought for so humble a  creature as a poor insect but let us not forget  that   each crawling insect holds a rank  Important in the plan of Him who framed  This scale of beingsholds a rank which lost  Would break the chain and leave behind a gap  Which Natures self would rue  The duration of the insect in the pupa state  though variable is without doubt limited and  sometimes it is fixed to an hour quite irrespective  of all external circumstances The most remarkable example of this kind occurs in the case of the  insects whose larva we have already mentioned  the Ephemera These insects appear with the  greatest regularity issuing from the waters of  the Seine or Marne in France between the  10th and 15th of August The fishermen call  them manna and when their season is come they  say the manna begins to appear or the manna  fell abundantly last night alluding by this expression either to the astonishing quantity of food  which the insects afford to the fish or to the large  quantity of fish which they then take The  fishermen expect them with the greatest confidence  during these few days nor are they ever dis  appointed Millions upon millions suddenly rise  into the air between eight and ten oclock in the  evening and this generally for three successive  nights Whatever be the temperature of the  atmosphere whether it be cold or hot these flies  invariably appear at the same hour in the evening  that is between a quarter and halfpast eight  towards nine they begin to fill the air in the  following half hour they are in the greatest numbers and at ten there are scarcely any to be seen  So that in less than two hoursand these always  the samethis infinite host of insects leave their  pupa state become perfect insects perform their  appointed work and vanish The same phenomenon of regularity of limit to the pupa state occurs  also in other insects though perhaps less strikingly Some insects constantly leave the pupa at  break of day others in the full tide of noon¬  day and others when the shadows of declining  day come over the landscape These however  are certainly exceptions to the general rule  which appears to lay down no precise period  of the day or month when this state is ended  and the perfect state is entered upon but a  limit nevertheless exists mainly dependent for  its appointment upon the external influences of  warmth and air  This limit attained we are brought to the next  point in the history of the insect pupa The beautiful organization of the perfect insect has been  going on under the dry and repulsive exterior Its  delicate limbs exquisitely wrought wings and the  other most wonderful organs with which the  perfect insect is furnished are now completed  Nothing remains but to cast off the slouch of its  pupa case and it will then be set free to range  whither it will in the great atmosphere into which  it will emerge If the reader has been watching  these insect changes with the natural object before  him he will immediately confirm our statement  when we mention that it is often possible to tell  when the pupa case is about to disclose its occupant The general form of the limbs is often  very clearly to be seen and the movements of the  included insect become much more sensible and  conspicuous If the beautiful gilded pupa called  as we have before said Chrysalides or Aurelia have  been thus nursed with a view to observe their  change it will be noticed that they lose entirely  that golden lustre which made them at first such  attractive objects These signs infallibly fore¬  token the approaching transformation  CHAPTER V  THE GREAT CHANGE  We must now spend a short time in narrating  the particular circumstances which attend this  interesting eventthe extrication of the insect  from its pupa case We shall in the first place  speak of such pupee as are not aquatic and after¬  wards of the singular ones which are so In the  case of the butterfly which as we have recommended repeatedly its being nursed and bred it  will be expedient to mention first the extrication  of the insect is comparatively with some others  a very simple operation The insect within is  seen to struggle for a time twisting its body in  various ways until at length a longitudinal slit  appears down the middle of its thorax The slit  extends gradually along the head and down the  parts which compose the breast until the insect  emerges from the outer case The inner membranes are now to be removed and this after a  little time is fairly accomplished and the butterfly  emerges and leaving the pupa skin behind it  byandby plunges for the first time upon the  soft waves of the summer air This is one of the  simplest of these methods of extrication  A very natural difficulty will arise in the mind  as to what possible means of escape can be  granted to such insects as live in the pupa state  in the interior of old trunks of trees or even in  little caves of the earth These cases have all  been satisfactorily provided for puzzling as they  may seem Take for instance the pupa of the  great goatmoth the Cossus ligniperda of which  ive a representation  This creature lies  id in a deep excavation formerly made by  itself when in the larva form inside the trunk of a  willow How is it to get back to the hole at  which it entered Without legs without any  other apparatus by which it might drag itself for¬  ward one would say it is in a hopeless case it  must lie there and perish for there appears no  way of extricating it from its den But not so  Helpless as it appears it will certainly make its  way out ancl taste the sweets of liberty and be  wafted along the fields of air But how Let  us suppose a man in such a condition let his  feet be bandaged together so that they cannot  move let a straitjacket be put upon his body  and secure his arms and hands after this let a  leathern bag be put over his head and tied down  round his middle then put him in a cellar and  bid him work his way out and up the stairs until  he reached the front door where he must undo  his bandages and slip himself out of his strait  jacket and hood after which he may go wherever  lie likes What a feeling of despair would fill the  poor prisoners mind promised his release on condition that he should accomplish it in that way  To him it would be a task altogether impossible  even though his life were offered as the reward of  his success It is not less a question of life and  death to the insect than it might be to him yet its  extrication is accomplished not only in a very  simple but in a very easy manner  If the reader will carefully examine the representation of the insect given in the last page he  will notice that the pupa case is provided with  certain sharp points which are all directed towards  the tail of the insect these sharp points are called  by entomologists adminicula They are of infinite  consequence to the insect Who has not himself  performed or been the subject of the trick of  causing a grain of barley to creep up the sleeve  The manner in which it is gradually pushed up is  strikingly similar to that in which the pupa of the  cossus is forced upwards and out of its wooden  gallery It will be readily supposed that in con¬  sequence of the peculiar direction assumed by the  toothlike processes in question it will be very  difficult to push the pupa backwards as the points  would catch in any obstacle and arrest its progress  in that direction but they offer no resistance to  its moving in a forward direction The manner  in which the insect proceeds then is as follows  Being capable of slightly shortening and lengthen¬  ing the lower part of its body which is the part  thus provided with hooks it begins to push back¬  wards but the hooks catch in the sides of the wood  and thus prevent it from moving back and it is  consequently actually driven forwards and so it  continues to thrust itself gradually forwards in this  simple manner just as a boy with his hands tied  might thrust himself forwards as he lay on the  ground by pushing against any object with his  feet In this way the patient creature moves we  may be sure by very slow degrees but that matters  little it moves until it has at length reached the  opening of its gallery outside the tree where it  may often be seen sticking out half way Here  by a remarkable instinct it ceases to move forwards for it would otherwise tumble down and  probably destroy itself At length after violent  struggles its swathing bands are all either torn  asunder or slidden off and the insect wings its  way in unrestrained freedom far from the scene of  its triumphs of patience and hope The pupa of  the father longlegs makes its way up from the  subterranean chamber in which it has so long been  sheltered fed and protected and reaches at length  the surface of the ground where it becomes the  perfect insect  But other pupas although not perhaps quite so  arduously placed as in the last instance nevertheless present us with an extremely difficult puzzle  as to how the included insect is to be extricated  from its swathing bands The common fleshfly  or blowfly for instance in the pupa state is shut  up in a membranous case out of which there seems  no escape but there is a way and the manner in  which the insect gets out of its prison is a remark¬  ably curious one well repaying the trouble of a  little close observation At the larger end under  which the head of the fly lies and from which it  always issues there is commonly a sort of lid which  can be pushed off like the lid of a box and the insect  can then walk out at pleasure But in the case of  the pupa of the blowfly this lid is not very easily  removed and the fly therefore is furnished with  a most ingenious method of thrusting it off On  opening the larger end of such a pupa if the fly  within is ready to come out a most curious phenomenon will be seen The insect moves towards  the lid and there begins to blow out its head in  the most extraordinary manner swelling it to  twice its natural size a moment after it will  resume its natural size  then again it will puff it  out making its two eyes  to start asunder and its  head to assume several dif   Mn f Hea ftheFly ferent ghapeg in succeg  sion Two representations are annexed of the  striking figure of the insects head when it thus  causes it to swell out After repeating this action  several times the fly emerges from the pupa  The cause of this remarkable dilatation is the fill¬  ing of a membrane situated at the middle part of  the head with air by which it is blown out into a  sort of bladder as large as the head itself This  acts as a kind of lever and eventually pushes up  the lid of the pupa case allowing the insect to  make its exit unmolested This part generally  disappears afterwards and the head  becomes alike firm and unyielding in  all its parts but it may in at least  its rudiments be seen even in the  head of the adult fly by slightly  pressing its head between the fingers  when it appears as at x in the cut  Head of a Fly magnified It shows oppo¬  site the letter x the  remains of the membranous bag  More singular still are the circumstances which  mark the exit of the insect from the pupa case in  other instances and yet more strikingly than those  narrated do they exhibit to us the amazing exercise  of the Divine attributes of wisdom and forethought  in the case of these humble beings The larva of  a species of moth which dwells in a wooden cell  scooped out of the poplar tree to which there is  no cloor by which it can escape readily gnaws  away the wood until it leaves only an extremely  delicate layer between it and the outside of the  tree which is as thin as writing paper This done  it enters into the pupa state Its time in that  condition being accomplished it moves itself by  the same contrivance as the cossus and actually  pushes through the thin layer and appears on the  outside of the tree thus making its escape from  prison by pushing down a part of its prison  wall  An instance described by the naturalist Bonnet  is yet more ingenious in the arrangements by  which the insect escapes While in the larva form  it takes up its abode inside the leaf of an ash  curiously rolled up into a cone and then after a  time it becomes a pupa forming a silken cocoon of  a very slight texture and therefore easily ruptured by the insect which it suspends like a ham¬  mock in the midst of its habitation It is the  closely joined sides of its leafy dwelling that form  a barrier which were it not for the precaution of  the larva would be impenetrable to so small and  weak an animal But like the lastmentioned  this larva seems to be aware of the feebleness of  its next condition and gnaws in the leaf a round  opening taking care not to cut through the  exterior thin layer of tissue or epidermis This  door is to serve the insect for its exit in due time  But in proportion to its bulk its green chamber is  of considerable size How then shall the insect  know the exact place where its portal is situated  How without a clue shall it discover in its dark  abode the precise circle which requires only a  push to throw open its gate Even this is fore¬  seen and provided for Out of all other positions in which the little hammock of which we  spoke might have been hung and they are  numerous the larva has been directed so to place  it that the silken cord which suspends the head is  fastened close to the side of the door which it has  previously constructed and the insect when it  emerges from the pupa guided by this thread  like Theseus makes its way out of an apartment which but for this contrivance might have  been to it a labyrinth as inextricable as that  of Minos Other insects adopt the same precaution of gnawing a doorway for the escape of  the perfect insect only leaving a sufficient thickness of outside tissue to protect the helpless  pupa within from the invasion of enemies from  without  Upon the pear or willow tree may sometimes  be found an illustration of escape from the pupa  altogether well deserving our notice In such  situations the brown flaskshaped cocoon of the  emperor moth may occasionally be discovered In  structure it is composed of a solid tissue of layers  of silk almost of the texture of parchment but  at the narrow end or that which may be compared  to the neck of the flask it is composed of a series  of loosely attached longitudinal threads converging like so many bristles to a blunt point in the  middle of which is a circular opening through  which the moth makes its escape the threads  readily yielding to pressure from  within and acting somewhat on the  principle of the wires of the opening  to a rattrap or the willow cricks of  an eeltrap The silk of its cocoon  is of so strong a texture and so  closely gummed that had both ends  been similarly closed the egress of  the insect would have been impracticable But  it may be thought such a cocoon is exposed  to the attacks of a number of insect enemies who  might easily find entrance to it at the opening  thus left at one of its ends This source of peril  has been foreseen Within the exterior funnel  shaped end at some little distance down the  insect has constructed a second funnel com¬  posed of a similar circle of needlepointed threads  which proceeding from the sides of the cocoon  converge to a point and form a cone through  which not the smallest aperture is left From  the arched structure of this singular dome and  from the fact just mentioned that no visible opening  can be discerned in it from without it is rendered  quite impenetrable to the most violent attacks of  besiegers while it yields to the slightest pressure  from within and allows the insect to emerge  from its cocoon with the utmost facility When  it has passed through it the elastic threads resume  their former position and the empty cocoon presents just the same appearance that it did before  A celebrated naturalist Ebsel was sorely perplexed at this the first time he had the gratification of watching the insect escape He states that  he could scarcely help thinking that there was  something supernatura of these fine emperor moths in a box in which he  had put a cocoon of this kind but in which he  could not discover the slightest appearance of any  insect having escaped from it until he slit it longitudinally and then found it to be empty  Mr Rennie mentions an instance perhaps not  so ingenious but equally curious with this history  of the proceedings of the emperor moth in a little  insect also a moth which also dwells upon the  willow It spins an elastic shroud for its pupa of  the singular shape of a boat with the keel upper¬  most Its first step is to spin two walls of whitish  silk of the required form and when these are  completed it draws them forcibly together with  elastic threads so placed as to retain them closely  shut The passage of the moth out of this cocoon  might have struck Rdsel with still greater surprise  than he had felt at witnessing that of the emperor  moth for in that cocoon there was at least no  apparent difficulty to prevent the egress of the  insect as the opening existed in it at one end  whereas in this there is no opening at all The  insect escapes at the joining of the sides the  threads giving way in a particular spot and the  sides though originally requiring force to draw  them together into the requisite form become so  elastic as to close again when the moth has passed  between them and made its escape The cocoon  preserves precisely the same form after the insect  has quitted it as before and it is impossible by  the naked eye to detect the place of its exit  As a general rule insects make their escape from  the pupa case head foremost but there occurs a  very singular exception in the case of some of the  gall insects The males of these insects contrive  to make their escape out of the pupa case formed  of the dried skin tail foremost and as they thus  back out of their dwelling their wings are necessarily turned backwards over their heads but a  little exercise soon puts the ruffled insect in  proper plume again and the wings resume their  customary position  Some curiosity may be felt to know in what  way the silkworm moth escapes from the double  prison the pupa case and the cocoon in  which she is concealed How is the moth to  make its way through the dense mass of fibres  all glued together which walls her in on every  side Her delicate wings and body would never  endure anything like the severity of the struggle  necessary to enable her to force her way through  this to her solid and resisting mass Though  much attention has been paid to the transformations of this particular insect it is somewhat  curious that it is still a matter on which opinions  are divided as to how the insect succeeds in  making its egress Some suppose that the eyes  which are the only hard organs of the head are  the instruments by which the threads are divided  their numerous minute facets serving the purpose  of a file Others hold the belief that the insect  pours out a fluid which acts upon the gum and  silken fibres of one end of the cocoon and so  softens them that they easily give way to the  slightest pressure from within Perhaps the two  opinions observe Messrs Kirby and Spence may  be reconciled by supposing the silkworm first  to moisten and then to break the threads of the  cocoon In those that are of a slighter texture  a mere push against the moistened end is probably  sufficient and hence we find in so many newly  disclosed moths the hair in that part wet and  closely pressed down  It has been supposed in cases where the  cocoon is a hard almost wooden cell that the  feeble insect prisoner within is provided with  a peculiar chemical fluid of greater powers of  solution than are requisite in the last instance  The cocoon of the pussmoth in particular is  so hard and dense as to resist even the point  of a penknife and the insect it holds confined  within it is a weak creature totally unprovided  with any apparatus fit for penetrating walls so  hard and dense as these What is it to do   Here observe the writers last quoted the  eyes are clearly incompetent nor could any  ordinary fluid assist their operations for the gum  which unites the Avoody particles of the cocoon  is indissoluble in aqueous menstrua What an  aqueous solvent cannot effect an acid is competent  to and with a bag of such acid our moth is fur¬  nished The contents of this she pours out as  soon as she has forced her head through the skin  of the pupa and upon the opposite end of the  cocoon The acid instantly acts upon the gum  loosens the cohesion of the grains of wood and  a very gentle effort suffices to break down Avliat  Avas a minute ago a strong barrier How admirable and effectual a provision But there  is yet another marvel connected Avitli it Ask  a chemist of what materials a vessel ought to be  to contain so potent an acid he will replyOf  glass Yet our moth has no glass recipient her  bottle is a membranous bag but of so wonderful  a fabric as not to be acted upon by a menstruum  which a gum apparently of a resinous nature  is unable to resist This fact can only be ex¬  plained by the analogous insensibility of the  stomach to the gastric juice which can dissolve  bone and it is equally worthy of admiration In  both cases the vitality of the membranous or fleshy  receptacle secures it from the action of the in¬  cluded fluid but how who shall explain  The naturalist Huber the patient historian  of the ants gives us a very interesting account of  the proceedings of these wonderful insects in  actually assisting the young out of their silken  cases These pupae are enclosed in a tissue  of silk of so compact a texture and formed of  so strong a silk as to render it impossible for  the prisoner within to rupture the fibres and get  out of prison The worker ants therefore are  instructed by a heavenly Ruler and Guide to  give help to the prisoners and to secure their  egress But how do these indefatigable attend¬  ants ascertain precisely the moment when their  aid is required The insect within has no power  of voice to cry out for help nor those without  in all probability the faculty of hearing if it  could do so It seems probable that they are  acquainted with it from some slight movements  which take place within which they ascertain  by means of their antenna Whatever it be  the attendants never interfere at a wrong time  Their manner of proceeding is beautifully described  in the following words of this author u Several  males and females lay in their envelopes in one of  the largest cavities of my glazed anthill The  labourerants assembled together and appeared to  be in continual motion around them I noticed  three or four mounted upon one of these cocoons  endeavouring to open it with their teeth at that  extremity answering to the head of the pupa  They began to thin it by tearing away some  threads of silk where they wished to pierce it and  at length by dint of pinching and biting this tissue  so extremely difficult to break they formed in it a  vast number of apertures They afterwards at¬  tempted to enlarge these openings by tearing or  drawing away the silk but these efforts proving  ineffectual they passed one of their mandibles  into the cocoon through the apertures they had  formed and by cutting each a thread one after  the other with great patience at length effected a  passage of a line in diameter in the superior part  of the web They now uncovered the head and  feet of the prisoner to which they were desirous  of giving liberty but before they could effect its  release it was absolutely necessary to enlarge the  opening For this purpose these guardians cut  out a portion in the longitudinal direction of the  cocoon with their teeth alone employing these  instruments as we are in the habit of employing  a pair of scissors To expedite the work some  raised up a little slip cut out in the length of the  cocoon whilst others drew the insect gently from its  imprisonment When the ant was extricated from  its enveloping membrane it was not like other  insects capable of enjoying its freedom and  taking flight it could neither fly nor walk nor  without difficulty stand for the body was still  confined by another membrane from which it could  not by its own exertions disengage itself   In this fresh embarrassment the labourerants  did not forsake it they removed the satinlike  pellicle which embraced every part of the body  drew the antenme gently from their investment then disengaged the feet and the wings  and lastly the body with the abdomen and its  peduncle The insect was now in a condition to  walk and receive nourishment for which it appeared there was urgent need the first attention  therefore paid it by the guardians was that of  giving it the food I had placed within their reach  It is droll to add and it may be some of our  readers may feel somewhat abashed at the fact  that these labourerants are extremely particular  in the observance of great order and regularity  in their chambers and they therefore carefully  sweep up all the castoff coverings which are  collected together and deposited in one of the  most distant lodges of their habitation Could  man with all the powers of reason and the faculties of an immortal being have evinced a more  striking instance of careful gentle and patient  assistance in the hour of need than we see manifested in the case of these insects Alas how  often does man need to come to them to learn not  only a lesson of wisdom and order but of the tenderest sympathy and affection How often lies  a poor fellowcreature in the bondage of hopeless  poverty or in the embarrassment of inextricable  difficulties How seldom does his emergency meet  with that resolute and thoroimhminded earnest  ness of brotherly love which will patiently give  him help and pity until his troubles are surmounted and his steps set free  It is time that we spoke somewhat upon the extrication of insects from their pupa cases even when  under water Here arises a great difficultythe  wings of the insects thus placed if wet with water  would be unfitted for flight and would probably  frequently lead to the death of the insect by  drowning Yet it is to leave its subaqueous  abode mount up through the waves overhead and  finally emerge without a drop of water clinging to  its body and from the glassy surface of the water  it is to take its flight into the air Some will be  tempted to exclaimThis is a clear impossibility Far from it The little worm so well  known to anglers as the caddisworm performs  this feat with the greatest ease and in the follow¬  ing manner  It has been mentioned that the larva known  under this name constructs for itself a case of  The Pupacase Larva and Fly of Caddisworm  various materials in which it dwells at the bottom  of the waters where the hand of the young angler  knows well to find them This case is heavier  than water and consequently cannot float and so  carry the insect to the surface As the insect  enters the pupa state it weaves at the entrance of  its singular habitation a grating of silk which  strange to say is not only not softened and melted  away by the water but hardens under it until it  is as hard as gum This little grating is of a circular form and fits exactly into the opening  and is perforated with holes so as to look something like the gratings which cover  our coalcellar mouths in the pavement of cities These holes are for  the purpose of letting in fresh water  for the respiration of the insect  Out of this under water cell the  insect must make its escape To enable it so  to do the pupa is furnished with two strong  curved jaws which are of no other use than to  assist it in making an opening in one of the  silken doors of its case as they are cast off immediately afterwards and there remains not a  vestige of them in the perfect insect This opening made the pupa forces its way out at that  end But what then How is it to reach the surface even now Its legs as will be seen by looking  at the cut are furnished with a number of hairlike  processes which assist it  in swimming it therefore  still enclosed in the waterproof coatthe pupa skin  strikes upwards to the  surface and reaching it  its skin splits its impervious raiment is cast aside  and the insect springs from Hairs  the surface into the air without the minutest  drop of water to impede her flight or injure the  delicate tissue of her wings  We may take another common insect for an  illustration of this mode of escape from the pupa  of an equally interesting kind If the reader will  on some fine summer day resort to any place of  standing water by the roadside he may probably  succeed in discovering the emergence of a number  of piats and a very amusing occupation it is to  stand by and watch the insectthis moment an  occupant of the waters and the next darting in  the air a new and airbreathing form of existence  About ten days after the gnat has become pupa it  prepares for leaving that state and becoming a  perfect insect by raising itself to the surface of the  water stretching out its body there the thorax  or in simpler language the front enlarged part  being raised above it Immediately the eye of the  observer detects the fact that some change is taking  place in the insect the enlarged portion cracks  and splits and through this opening the head of  the gnat makes its appearance then the trunk of  the insect rises in a curious manner through the  breach and more and more of its body rises pre¬  serving all the time a perpendicular position so  that it looks just as if it were rising out of the  water and not out of the horizontal pupa case  floating on the surface The upright body of the  gnat now resembles a mast in a boat only that it  is continually being raised higher and higher by  the gradual emergence of the insect Its wings  and legs are all folded closely down its sides  as is shown in the cut and it has therefore no  power at all to prevent its being overset by a  breeze and drowned in the little waves below  the lower portion of its body alone retains it in  this position being as yet contained within the  pupa case No shipbuilder dare venture to  put a mast of such proportions into any of his  vessels for fear of their being topheavy and  hence liable to heel over in a gale of wind And  undoubtedly many gnats particularly in windy  weather are shipwrecked as soon as they emerge  This is in fact a moment of pecidiar danger to the  little insectmariner and a breath of untoward air  will frequently drive it about like a ship in a  tempestuous ocean and if it is once laid on its side  all is over with the gnat no patent apparatus can  save it and we have the mournful testimony of  Reaumur that in stormy weather he has seen  a vast number of such shipwrecks in the mimic  ocean of a pool of water Generally speaking  the peril is only momentary and the insect emerges  in safety Having thus raised itself to the perpendicular position the gnat withdraws its two fore¬  legs from the pupa case and stretches them out  then it draws out its two next and now feeling  safe it quits the perpendicular position and bends  toward the water plants its feet on its glistening  surface which is to it as safe as the land since it  has the faculty of walking on the waves It is  now in perfect safety its wings expand and  become dry and presently the insect will for the  first time make use of them by flying to some  adjoining twig  But we need not in many cases leave our homes  to see an escape from the pupa in every respect  as singular as the last and in many precisely  identical Before the writers studywindow was  an artificial fountain in which as the water was  not constantly allowed to play aquatic insects of  various kinds had permission to establish them¬  selves Nor were they long in availing themselves  of this liberty A week or two of genial summer  weather was sufficient to people the water with  various inhabitants among them was a little  creature which will be recognised by every reader  when we mention its title the bloodworm It  is in reality not a worm at all although resembling  worm in shape and in its serpentlike movements  This little creature was  for a time particularly  active and in a tumbler  of water taken from the  fountain might be seen  perhaps a dozen of them  twisting about in a very  singular manner By andbv a change came  over them and it turned out that the worm¬  like creatures had become pupae of a blackish  colour thus at once deciding their insect character They belong in fact to the insect  called the Chironomus plumosus These black  pupae were scarcely less active than the red blood¬  worms or larvte of the same insect The r flapped  about their tails with great vehemence and thus  although their bodies naturally sink in the water  they were able to swim from the bottom to the  surface or from side to side Observing that they  had finished their appointed period in the pupa  form we became anxious to watch their change  into the perfect insect Neglecting however to  notice them at the proper periodthe afternoon of  a warm sunny day we were astonished the next  morning to find a surprising number of pupa skins  lying empty of their tenants on the surface as  though some of the water fairies enumerated in  fable had been dancing on the waves all night and  left their little black shoes behind them in their  haste to flee from the light of the smiling morning  We determined to be better prepared for the observation on that day and as the afternoon came we  had the gratification of seeing a large number of  these insects rise from the water all in the following mannerThey rose up from the bottom and  reached the surface by the peculiar movement of  their tails just described there the thorax was  thrust above the water and immediately the insect burst its cerements elevated itself by a wave¬  like motion from the rest of the pupa case which filled with air and now glistened like silver it  then planted its forelegs on the water withdrew  the rest of its body from the case unfolded its  wings and in a few moments was sailing in the  thin air On one stormy day the surface of our  fountain was bestrewn with the dead and dying  bodies of these insects drowned in the waves  De Geer speaking of the pupae of a moth  states that he was not fortunate enough to wit¬  ness the manner in which they quit their watery  abode But he seems to think that they quit  the pupa case then mount to the surface of  the water or up some aquatic plant in order  to reach a dry spot where they remain their  wings being developed afterwards and that  thus the risk of their being wetted is avoided  Their bodies being lighter than the water lie  conceives accounts for their being able to rise to  its surface Too much weight however must not  be attached to this observation as it is not accompanied with satisfactory ocular evidence of the fact  The pupa of the dragonfly furnishes us with  a very interesting example of escape and it well  deserves the readers attention if he be so placed  as to have the opportunity of observing it Per¬  haps indeed few insects afford us such a singular  series of interesting facts as are to be found in the  escape of this one from its pupa The best method  of observing their change is to procure as many of  the larvse as possible to put them in a basin of  water at the bottom of which are a quantity of  dead leaves and to allow  several sticks to be in  the water touching the  bottom of the basin and  reaching above the level  of the water as shown in  the cut Then we must  watch carefully to notice  any of the larvae which having become pupa creep  towards the edge of the water These are such  as will in all probability be the first to undergo  the change for they come to that position in  order that they may get dry before proceeding  further If these are now closely observed they  will be seen after the lapse of a little time to  leave their position and to begin creeping about  in search of a suitable spot where they may  undergo their metamorphosis Most probably  they will select for this purpose the sticks we  have introduced into the basin and after running  up and down them will fix upon a particular  spot where they place themselves securely the  head invariably uppermost From what will be  subsequently mentioned it is necessary that the  insect should fasten itself so  firmly to the branch that not  even a violent effort would  disturb its position This is se¬  cured by the insect thrusting  the sharp claws with which its  feet are armed into the stem on  which it rests The points of  these claws are so fine and hard  as even to penetrate wood with  t Pupa of Dragonfly showing the  facility I hey are shown in shap poinU at the end of us feet  the cut and even after the dragonfly has escaped  out of the pupa ease they may be easily made to  fasten upon a piece of a branch by simply pressing  the feet against it very lightly In order to  watch the changes of this insect Reaumur once  whilst staying in the country collected a large  number of the pupse and placed them on a piece  of cottonprint tapestry where they soon felt at  home and fixed themselves in preparation for  their change without moving far from the spot  where they had been placed At few periods of  the day could a visit be paid to the room where  this tapestry was hung without seeing a spectacle  at once diverting and extraordinary Previous to  its changes the pupa becomes more transparent  and the large and beautiful eyes of the insect it  encloses grow increasingly brilliant These signs  always indicate that the transformation is nigh at  hand  It comes to pass in the following mannerSome  movements of a struggling kind take place inside  the pupa case and at length the case splits at the  upper part near the head through this rent the body  of the dragonfly appears and tears it open acting like  a wedge until the slit extends along the head across  to the two eyes The latter transverse slit is produced by a contrivance similar to that mentioned in  the case of the blowfly a sort of air bladder which  the insect distends at its pleasure and thus causes  the skin covering its head and eyes to split open  The head and body of the insect rise and make  their appearance through the slit and the head is  now so much larger than it appeared while in the  pupa case that it seems almost impossible that it  could ever have been contained within it The  insect continues to rise perpendicularly out of the  case and the legs make their exit leaving the leg  cases of the pupa undisturbed in their attachment  to the support on which it rests In order to  facilitate the disengagement of the rest of its body  the insect now bends itself in a curved form  backwards being only kept from filling by the  last rings or segments of its body being still  embraced by the sheath of the pupa case When  it has extricated itself thus far it begins to move  about its legs in different directions for several  minutes as if to get them into use but after this  it ceases all movement whatever Not a quiver  can be seen in its limbs and the young observer  would be inclined to concludeas a great entomologist once did the first time he witnessed the  changes of this insectthat it was in reality dead  and that it was a waste of time to watch it any  longer This state of profound inaction may endure  for a quarter or even half an hour it appears to  be intended in order to give time to the insect to  recruit its strength for a fresh and more violent  series of efforts and to admit of its parts becoming  hardened and dry Suddenly as we are perhaps  carelessly looking on the inanimate object it performs a feat of the most surprising because unexpected agility Its body which was previously much bent backwards is now swung  forwards and bent into a curve it then swings  back and then forwards again and so quickly  that it almost seems to leap It then rests its  legs upon the front part of the pupa case and  pulls the rest of its body out of the case by  degrees and then creeps forward leaving the pupa  case behind still immovably fixed upon the  plant   Behold says Reaumur the dragonfly new  born but very different from those which traverse  the air or rest upon the plants around It is  quite in disguise The body though longer than  the pupa case out of which it was drawn has not  got all its natural length The wings which are  the large and useful organs of these flies have as  yet very little more volume than they had when  enclosed in the short and straitened pupa case  They are merely furrowed plates or laminae of  some thickness and arranged one over the other  as if packed together One can scarcely conceive  how each of these wings can acquire its proper  dimensionshow it is to enlarge and lengthen  sufficiently They are folded into plaits like a  fan or like the leaf of a tree just about to be  developed hence they naturally appear very narrow and the cause of their appearing so short is  that each of their longitudinal portions is folded up  like the paper lanterns more frequently used by  nuns than by other persons  The remaining portion of the dragonflys history will be found in the next chapter  Some curious instances are given by various  authors of the escape of more than one insect  from the same pupa Thus we are told that a  male and female emperor moth were once pro¬  duced from one larva and therefore one pupa of  extraordinary size Messrs Kirby and Spence  tell ns of n German entomologist who says that  two specimens of the pinelappet moth were once  produced from one pupa which was of the re¬  markable size of two inches in length and one in  thickness But these are very rare instances the  common and almost universal rule being that one  pupa only contains one insect  Nothing now remains for us to add to the  insects history in the pupa state Alreadyfor  it is Spring far advancedthe air is becoming  peopled with insect tribes   The insect youth are on the wing  Eager to taste the honied spring  And float amid the liquid noon  A thousand times ten thousand nay thousands of  thousands are already in the air and the low  hum of their wings may be heard if we stand  breathless and listen in the midst of some sequestered spot far from the roar and bustle and  strife of town life But the great lifeseason of  the insect world is yet to come and though May  whispers it is nigh June July and August  must bring it to us and with it a teeming multitude of insect flutterers more numerous than the  stars of heaven or the sandgrains of the seashore  PART IVTHE IMAGO  CHAPTEK I  THE NEWBORN PERFECT INSECT   Oh start not on thy closing eyes  Another day shall still unfold  A sun of milder radiance rise  A happier age of joys untold  Shall the poor worm that shocks thy sight  The humblest form in natures train  Thus rise in newborn lustre bright  And yet the emblem teach in vain 1  Beautiful as these lines are and poetical as is  the idea they develop they are incorrect The  perfect insect springing from the pupa is not  an emblem of mans glorious resurrection from  this body of sin and death why we shall immediately discuss In the oftentimes beautiful mythology of Greece the name for the butterfly was   x l rv X h ia T is the soul Just as the insect bursts  with brilliant wings from the dull and grovelling form of the pupa flutters in the blaze of day  roams on untiring wings through the genial air  and enjoys the use of faculties so new and strange  to it when contrasted with those of the pupa  stateso was it imagined that the souls arising  from amid the corruption of this vile body would  prove a deliverance from the bondage of mortality  and the countless infirmities to which it is heir  And surely there was much poetry in the conception but we who must not leave the path of  true insect history for any poetical fancies have  now to remind the reader that the simile is in  many respects inaccurate and in so doing we shall  merely bring to his recollection what was said as  to the contents of the pupacase at p 231 From  this it appears that the pupa state far from being  a state of death is one in which new parts are  added to the insect in which the insect is actually  not only alive but in some instances capable of  moving about as well as before or after and lastly  in which the various organs of the perfect insect  all exist previous to the disclosure of the latter  Tlius if we were to slit open a pupacase just  before the insect bursts from it we should find  that although kept in bondage by the case the  insect was in all respects the same as if we had  allowed it to break out of its prison in the ordinary manner In a word the perfect insect is  after all only the same being which we saw in the  egg larva and pupa states now having cast off  its last skin and become an adult being  When a man or an animal dies the particles of  the body are separated from each other their union  is destroyed and they themselves are dissipated in  various ways The flesh returns to dust the spirit  to God who gave it How different this change  from that which the insect undergoes and how  inappropriate in strictness as   Emblems of our own great resurrection  Emblems of the bright and better land  as emblems of the mysterious union of the immortal soul and its immortal incorruptible body The  fable of the Phoenix was more expressive of the  real nature of this great change for there the  body of the creature was reduced to death first  and the newborn being sprang from its ashes As  we are anxious to convey only the most clear and  accurate idea to the readers mind of the various  stages of insect life through which we are con  ducting him it appeared expedient to notice the  mistake taught in these pleasing lines only to  avoid the error of its being supposed that they  give us an accurate idea of the true nature of the  change from pupa to imago  The term Imago is a Latin word and like those  of larva and pupa was given to insects in this  condition by the naturalist Linnaeus It signifies  properly an image copy or representation of any  object In applying it to insects in their last  stage Linnaeus intended that we should under¬  stand by it that the insect had now reached its  stage of perfection and had become in all respects  exactly like that is the image of its parent And  though a better term might probably be found  yet as no person is likely to fall into any serious  mistake merely because we call an insect in its  last state an imago it is as well to retain it  better indeed than by inventing another to create  nothing but confusion and disorder in the minds  of young entomologists In this chapter there¬  forethe last chapter of the Life of an Insect the  word imago may be considered as synonymous or  having the same meaning with that of e perfect  insect it is an insects last stage of existence  It would be a great mistake to suppose that the  insect so soon as it leaves the pupacase is in that  instant in every respect similar to what is known  to us as the perfect insect When for example  a butterfly has just succeeded in extricating itself  from its pupacase if we were to take it up in the  expectation of finding it all at once decked with  the glories of its wings and elegant in its form  we should be disappointed Owing to the cramped  position which its limbs and wings and other  organs have so long been made to occupy its  appearance when it emerges from the pupa is  necessarily different from that which it wears  after all its limbs have been in free exercise and  the flutter of its wings has been heard over hill  and dale throwing the gentle air into an irregular  line of tumult  Now that summer has come abundant opportunities for watching insects in all their stages  may be had and by careful searching of the  garden field and woodland a number of pupie  may be discovered on the very eve of disclosing  the imago or perfect insect Let us suppose  that the reader has not looked in vain but has  brought home in a tin box several of these  singular objects about which so much has been  said The pupa ready to burst open and let loose  the struggling captive within is before him the  skin splits the body of the insect appears withdraws  itself from the pupacase and inner membranes  and the imago appears before him But O how  different from the splendidly adorned insect which  we know it is still to become Its tender body is  weak soft and languid and bedewed with moisture  Its wings instead of being of their usual size and  variegated with such glowing and admirably con¬  trasted colours as only a Divine hand could create  are in the largest sized butterflies scarcely bigger  than the nail of the little finger instead of being  uplifted in full strength and beauty they hang  drooping down over the sides of the trunk and  their colours are all dull and muddy and without  any of those distinct spots and beautifully defined  marks streaks and bands which we observe with  so much admiration in the wiims of these insects  Altogether we might take it rather for a mutilated  and imperfect insect instead of what in spite of  its unattractive appearance it really isa perfect  insect and in a short time to become a splendid  one  We have only to wait patiently for the lapse  of a little time and our desires will be fully  gratified in beholding all these symptoms of  weakness and imperfection disappear The imago  attaching itself either to the castoff pupacase  or to some other convenient support first stretches  out one organ and then another its body loses  the coating of moisture which bedewed it its  various parts become firm and hardened and its  colours come forth in all their beauty All the  parts which had been forced into a constrained  position now relieved assume that which is  natural to them in the perfect insect and the  wings no longer have a questionable appearance  but become expanded into those light and ex¬  quisite structures which form the peculiar beauty  and characteristic of many insects displaying  themselves almost magically in the form it may  be of the thin transparent membrane of the fly  or as the painted tissue of the moth or butterfly  extending frequently to five or six times their  previous dimensions  Here let us take up as an illustration of these  beautiful and interesting phenomena the concluding portion of the history of the dragonfly commenced at p 302 The expansion of the wings  of this elegant creature after it has left the  pupacase and fixed itself generally on the stem  of some pond plant goes on so rapidly that we  can actually see them becoming larger each  moment as we look upon them If we were to  attempt to trace their outline on paper before the  next stroke could be added their form would be  different During the whole time that the development of the wings goes on the insect continues perfectly still and immovable Its wings  are not stirred in the least and the insect seems  to avoid all risk of having these delicate organs  touched by any surrounding object Its wings  which are byandby to possess almost the stiffness  of a thin layer of the mineral talc are at present  softer and more flexible than wet writing paper  and if they were to receive any injury while in  this condition that injury could never be repaired  hence the insect requires to be in a perfectly quiet  condition The dragonfly seems to be fully aware  of this and in order to prevent the wings as they  increase in size from drooping down towards and  coming in contact with its body it curves it in the  manner represented so as to allow for the expansion  and elongation of the wings At length generally  in a quarter of an hours time their development is  fully completed but they are not yet sufficiently  firm and resisting to use in flying If left to  itself the insect generally waits three or even  four hours before it puts them into inactivity  In addition to the expansion and elongation of  its wings its body also elongates until it has  acquired its full dimensions In vain should we  look at first for the splendid colours in which these  insects are decked all the tints are blotted and  unpleasing Those charming species which are  spotted with beautiful blue and yellow tints intersprinkled with black are when they are but  just emerged from the pupa of a whitish yellow  spotted with brown the yellow marks however  are seen to change to a beautiful deep orange the  brown to black and some of the yellow marks to  blue  The following interesting description of the  same changes as they take place in the butterfly  is from the valuable work of Messrs Kirby and  Spence The pupa of a very interesting and  beautiful butterfly the only one of its description  that Britain has yet been ascertained to produce  I mean Papilio Machaon being brought to me  by a friend early in May this year on the sixteenth of that month I had the pleasure of seeing  it leave its pupacase With great care I placed  it upon my arm where it kept pacing about for  the space of more than an hour when all its parts  appearing consolidated and developed and the  animal perfect in beauty I secured it though not  without great reluctance for my cabinet it being  the only living specimen of this line fly I had ever  seen To observe how gradual and yet how  rapid was the development of the parts and organs  and particularly of the wings and the perfect  coming forth of the colours and spots as the sun  gave vigour to it was a most interesting spectacle  At first it was unable to elevate or even to move  its wings but in proportion as the aerial or other  fluid was forced by the motions of its trunk into  their nervures their numerous corrugations and  folds gradually yielded to the action till they  had gained their greatest extent and the film  between all the nervures became tense The  ocelli and spots and bars which appeared at  first as but germs or rudiments of what they were  to be grew with the growing wing and shone  forth upon its complete expansion in full magnitude and beauty  If we were expert anatomists and were armed  with a good microscope the study of the wing of  a dragonfly would prove one of great interest to  us These beautiful organs however must be  examined when they are as yet but a little expanded as in their completely developed state  we should certainly Tail in detecting their real  structure Thin and gauzelike as they seem  they are in reality double consisting of an upper  and a lower surface between which are several  parts which are necessary to preserve the shape  and carry on the functions of the wings The  two surfaces of the wing enclose what are called  the nervures resembling in some respects the  veins of a leaf These are really fine hollow  tubes of some firmness which ramify in large  numbers between the two membranes of the  wing and thus give strength and stability of  figure to them Along these tubes or nervures  branches of the airvessels or trachea and of  the bloodvessels run  From these necessary details let us turn to  make the difficult but important inquiryHow  are the wings expanded by what means do they  from being thick soft and moist become thin  hard and dry It is to be regretted that this  inquiry cannot be answered with that satisfactory  certainty which it deserves It is very difficult to  catch the insects in which the expansion of the  wings is best observed at the right moment and  even then it is extremely difficult to say whether  one cause more than another may contribute to  this phenomenon The following explanation of  it is given by Messrs Kirby and Spence whose  general accuracy on such subjects is well known  e As soon as the insect is disclosed a fluid enters  the tubes or nervures and being impelled into  their minutest ramifications necessarily expands  their folds for the nervures themselves are folded  and as they gradually extend in length with them  the moist membranes attached to them are also  unfolded and extended In proportion as this  takes place the expanding membranes approach  each other and at last being dried by the action  of the atmosphere become one To promote this  motion of the fluid seems the object of the agitations which in many instances the animal from  time to time gives to its unexpanded wings That  a kind of circulation or rather an injection of an  aqueous fluid into these organs actually takes place  may he ascertained by a very simple experiment  If you clip the wings of a butterfly during the  process of expansion you will see that the  nervures are not only hollow but that however  dry and empty they may subsequently be found  they at that time actually contain such a fluid  Swammerdam who appears to have been the first  physiologist that paid attention to this subject  was of opinion that an aeriform as well as an  aquiform fluid contributes to produce the effect  we are considering He had observed that if a  small portion be cut off from the wing of a bee  a fluid of the latter kind exuded from its vessels in  the form of pellucid globules becoming insensibly  drops which he concluded proved the action of the  latter and he noticed also that the wings were  furnished with trachea which were at that time  distended by the injected air whence he justly  surmised that the action of the air was also of  great importance to produce the expansion of the  wing But Swammerdam appears only twice  to have seen the expansion of the dragonfly in  which this phenomenon is best observed Herold  an eminent naturalist also attributes the expansion of the wing to the flow of an aqueous fluid into  the nervures M Chabrier a French entomologist having observed a fluid in the interior of  the nervures of the wings of insects thinks it  probable that they can introduce it into them and  withdraw it at their pleasure so as to facilitate their  unfolding When we call to mind the force with  which the blowfly or fleshfly and the dragonfly are able to expand their heads by forcing air  into them we need scarcely ask for any other  explanation than simply that the tracheae are  distended with air and by that means the soft  and yielding wings are made to assume their distended state  It has been mentioned that in the case of the  dragonfly the completion of the unfolding of its  wings occupies about a quarter of an hour but that  sometimes it is even half an hour The ordinary  period is from five to ten or fifteen minutes in most  insects but it is sometimes prolonged to an hour  or to several hours Again in others as we have  already seen in the history of the emergence of the  gnat and other insects from their aquatic state in  the pupa it is completed in a few seconds and the  insect only rests for this brief period on the surface  of the water previous to taking flight from its  apparently somewhat dangerous position  Some observations of Mr Rennie show in a singular manner the fact before mentioned that if  the wings while yet wet and soft are in any way  pressed upon or otherwise injured they will never  assume their proper appearance The thread by  which a chrysalis is suspended may sometimes  snap asunder when this happens and the chrysalis is allowed to remain it will not usually produce an insect complete in all its parts for the  side upon which it lies being pressed against an  unyielding substance by its own weight instead of  hanging lightly suspended by a silken cord is pre¬  vented from becoming duly expanded and when  the insect is excluded it is found to be deformed  A colony of the browntail moth which we reared  during the summer of 1829 spun in the corner of  a nursebox a common web of several chambers  for containing the pupte One of these chambers  being accidentally torn a pupa fell upon the earth  in the bottom of the box and in due time a female  moth was produced from it but she never succeeded  in expanding her wings which remained till her  death shrunk rumpled and totally useless for the  purpose of flying though in every other respect  she was full grown and deposited in the box a  group of fertile eggs covered with down from her  tail as neatly as was done by her sisters of the  same brood In the summer of 1825 the chrysalis  of a small tortoiseshell butterfly Vanessa urticce  lost its hold of its silken suspensory and fell upon  the pasteboard bottom of a nursebox resting in  a sort of angular position so that the case of the  upper wing on the left side pressed upon the box  with the whole weight of the chrysalis above it  When the butterfly made its appearance it expanded its wings as usual but the wing upon  which it had rested was not half the size of the  one on the right side which had lain uppermost  Another of the same brood had from some cause  not grown so large in the caterpillar state as the rest  It was transformed notwithstanding into a chrysalis which appeared healthy and wellformed but  when the butterfly appeared though it did not  differ from the usual appearance its wings never  expanded a single hairs breadth and remained  always in the same state as when it issued from  the chrysalis  After the insect has once withdrawn itself from  the pupacase it generally retains the same appearance and raiment as long as it lives not casting its  akin like the larva but having put on its permanent  clothing immediately upon its leaving the pupa  case But hi the case of an aquatic insect the  Ephemera of which we have before spoken a re¬  markable exception to this rule has been noticed  When these insects leave the pupacase any one on  looking at them would say that they had completed  their changes they appear to be furnished with  every part necessary to them and not to have any  which is redundant yet they are destined to go  through a change equivalent to that which has just  taken place if indeed it is not more apparently  difficult than it and that isthey have to cast off  their skin That they should be able to withdraw  from thence their head their legs their body and  their long tails would be no great difficulty for us  to comprehend because numbers of insects at their  escape from the pupacase do more than this but  in their case we are presented with a more perplexing enigma In the transformation of other  insects as we have already seen and indeed in  that of the insects before us the wings are at first  very soft and pliable and therefore can be easily  withdrawn from the cases in which they were contained But in the Ephemera the wings after it  has left the pupacase are fully developed and  expanded and seem to have acquired all their consistence and to have become hard and inflexible  Moreover its wings are so thin that we can  scarcely believe that they are in reality double  that is that they are covered by an outside sheath  and it seems incomprehensible how if such is the  fact the wings can be withdrawn from this case  or sheath when the only opening that can be dis¬  covered for that purpose is a very minute hole  near the spot where the wings take origin from  the body of the insect Let us now see how all  these difficulties are overcome and how the insect  withdraws itself from this as we might almost call  it second pupacase  The Ephemene when they leave the water  rise high into the air and wing their way perhaps far from the place of their birth They  may often be found wheeling over green fields  or wandering among the forest shades far from  the bubbling stream in whose waters so large a  portion of their existence was spent but more  frequently they are to be found somewhere in the  neighbourhood of the stream enjoying an aerial  dance The feet of the insect are armed with hooks  of great minuteness and by their means the insect  attaches itself to a suitable object sometimes to a  wall sometimes to a twig or to the trunk of a tree  it does not much matter where Without at first  making the least movement the insect patiently  abides the time when it must withdraw itself from  its useless upper garment and sometimes it has  to wait a whole day in this position The time  arrived the skin splits and the body of the  insect rises gradually out of it but the difficulty  is about the wings Nevertheless as we watch  the insect we shall find that it gradually draws  them out of their delicate cases and at length  emerges as perfect in beauty and form as before The manner in which this is effected  is as followsalthough the outer case of the  wings is hard and rigid yet the wings which  it covers over are preserved in a soft and moist  condition In proportion therefore as the insect  disengages itself from the anterior part of the skin  the inner or real wings become contracted by a  number of plaits into a form nearly cylindrical  which readily admits of their being pulled through  the openings lately mentioned and as soon as the  insect is released from its envelope these plaits  unfold and the wings return to their former shape  and dimensions So exactly does this thin skin  thus cast off fit all the parts of the insects body  INSECTS WITHOUT WINGS  329  that it may often be mistaken for the insect itself  when it is found clinging to the place where it has  gone through its changes  Before we leave the subject of the  wings it must be mentioned that  there are some insects which have  none The cut represents a beetle  of this class Wingless Beetle  If the reader will now take a peep into one of  the nurseboxes in which he may have been rearing  butterflies from the pupa presuming that several  of them have ere this burst from their cases and  are fluttering about anxious for liberty he will  generally detect upon the bottom or sides of the  box one or two marks of a somewhat reddish  colour sometimes indeed they are very red These  spots are produced by the insect which on its  emergence from the pupa generally deposits a  drop of fluid from its intestines Almost all  insects perforin the same action at this period  but we may well remark with Reaumur it could  scarcely have been supposed that the excrements  of a butterfly should ever have filled the minds of  a whole population with terror Such has however been the case and may perhaps yet be in  districts where ignorance and superstition close  the minds of the inhabitants against the truths of  entomology Historians says Reaumur tell  us of showers of blood as having been the cause of  terror to nations and considered as prophetic of  fearful events of the destruction of cities and  revolutions of kingdoms At the beginning of  the month of July in the year 1608 one of these  showers of blood was said to have fallen in the  suburbs of Aix and for some miles around  It turned out that the supposed drops of blood  were in reality drops deposited by the butterflies It is not improbable that other showers  of blood recorded by historians and taking  place about the same period of the year might  be accounted for in the same natural and simple  manner Gregory of Tours relates that in the  time of Childebert a shower of blood fell in  different places in Paris and particularly in a  certain house situated in the territory of Senlis  Another was said to have fallen toward the end of  June in the reign of King Robert In the year  1533 we are told by another author a prodigious  multitude of butterflies appeared throughout a  great portion of Germany sprinkling plants  leaves buildings clothes and men with bloody  drops as if it had rained blood  In the Gentlemans Magazine for the year 1764  we read that a kind of rain of a red colour  resembling blood fell in many parts of the Duchy  of Cleves and caused great consternation Something of the like kind fell also at Rhenen in the  province of Utrecht A gentleman is reported  to have sent a bottle full of it to Dr Schutte to  know if it contained anything pernicious to health  Dr Schutte wrote a learned dissertation upon it  and gave it as his opinion that it was caused by the  particles which had been raised into the atmosphere by a strong wind and that it was in no  way hurtful to mankind or beasts Probably  butterflies were the real shedders of this blood¬like shower as in the previous cases Our next remark about the imago state of insects will perhaps create some surpriseInsects  in this state with some apparent exceptions do  not grow larger When they leave the pupa state  and have all their parts fully developed they do  not subsequently increase in size We are often  told by ignorant people that the little houseflies  which we watch dancing in our chambers or  scrambling up our windows are only young flies  of the same kind as fleshflies and that byandby  they will grow into a large ff Bluebottle This is  a sad mistake Let the reader try Let a fly be  put under a glass and fed with a little sugar or  honey in vain will he daily examine it in the  expectation of beholding it increase in sizeit will  live and die nearly the same little being unaltered  to the last If such persons only knew somewhat  of the life of an insect such an absurd and unfortunately very prevalent mistake would not be committed We might as reasonably call a trout a  young salmon If we were to examine any number  of flies of the housefly kind Jslusca domestica and  carefully measure them or weigh them we should  find them all almost exactly of the same size  which of course would not be the case if they  really grew larger as they grew older  But there are some insects which after they  leave their pupa increase within a very short time  to a size which could scarcely be believed In  particular the newborn insects of a tribe of flies  which produce the aphislion larva before spoken  of are distinguished by this peculiarity We  behold a very little insect emerge from the pupa  case and in a quarter of an hour we are astonished  to find it has grown to a great fly This sudden  increase appears the more marvellous because  during this period the insect takes no nourishment The wings of this insect when it is just  born are not more than onetenth the size they  acquire in that short space of time The insect  is to all appearance firm and plump and offers  a ridiculous contrast to the tiny pupacase out  of which it has emerged It appears probable  that this sudden enlargement is to be accounted  for by the insect filling itself with air and thus  causing the various parts so closely packed together and fitted into one another in the pupa  to be expanded The experiment which puts  this idea to the test is a very simple one we  need only prick the body of the insect with a fine  needle and we shall hear a slight sound produced  by the escape of the air and in a few seconds  the body of the creature shrinks to its former  dimensions It appears indeed that the body  of the insect is actually larger at this time than  at a subsequent period of its life when it becomes  more flattened and shorter Another beautiful  insect one of the lacewinged flies exhibits the  same singular phenomenon Its pupacase is not  larger than a small pea yet the body of the insect  is nearly halfaninch long and covers when its  wings and antennas are expanded a surface of  an inch square It appears in fact almost incredible that it could ever have been contained  within so small a compass  The cases just related may appear to be really  exceptions to the rule just laid down as to the  nonincrease of insects when once emerged from  the pupa but upon a little consideration it will  be found that the exceptions are more apparent  than real The increase in size is not really  a process of growth but is simply owing to the  expansion of the body of the insect to its due  size only taking place in a sudden manner  by breathing a certain amount of air The  dragonfly gives us another instance of a similar  enlargement soon after leaving the pupacase  CHAPTER II  THE STRUCTURE AND ORGANS OF THE IMAGO  We must now ask the readers attention to  a very important part of the history of the  insectthe knowledge of its various parts and  their uses in the insect economy Men of science  would call this the anatomy and physiology of  insects and if there is a desire felt to know and  retain the proper terms employed by those versed  in this science when they treat of these subjects  it will be well to bear these names in mind We  may however  convey some notion of the nature  of the studies  called by these  names by the following illustration Let us take  yonder butterfly  as our example and arresting it in its zigzag career  over flowers and fields let us carefully bring  it indoors and there look closely at its various  parts and appendages There we find two long  delicate threadlike organs springing from the  head then we come to the head with its different  organs farther back is a separate portion distinct  from the head and distinct also from the remainder of the body of the insect at the side of it  are the wings below are the legs last of all we  bring under our notice the remaining division of  the insects body the abdomen Now if Anatomy  stood at our right hand while we took notice  of each part she would point out all the peculiarities of its structure and would tell us of how many  other parts it was made up and how all were beautifully and wonderfully put together by the skill of  the Great Creator Further than this she would  very probably strongly insist upon our remembering each part by a particular name and as  we may add since she is particularly fond of and  learned in Latin and Greek we may rest quite  assured each name she communicated to us would  be in one or other of these classical languages  for example instead of saying the butterfly was  one of the scalewinged insects which would  be far too homely for her she would declare that  it belonged to the Lepidoptera which is the same  thing in Greek and its head she would inform  us was the caput which is the Latin for that  word This done her strict duties would be exactly fulfilled and she would summon her sister  science Physiology to give us further information about the butterfly Physiology who we  may remark is a far less sternlooking personage  than her austere relative and appears with a  countenance which expresses that she has much  to tell us which will greatly interest us would  next take up the panting insect She would tell  us to consider attentively the head of the little  creature while we listened to her elegant account  of the purposes it was intended to subserve She  would dilate with eloquence upon the exquisite  machinery which was compacted into so small  a compass as its mouth and she would render  us almost breathless with amazement as with  rising animation she revealed to us the astonishing  optical wonders of an insects eye telling us per¬  haps that an insect may probably see like the  fabled Argus behind and before and on every  side at the same time Then she would tell  us in order the nature and uses of each part  and in a word give us a minute but delightful  account of everything that is known about the  Life of an Insect  From this it will be manifest that we have  hitherto chiefly listened to the voice of Physiology in this little book although the leading  particulars of the Anatomy of the insect in  its various stages have also been brought before  us We must now address ourselves for some  little time to learn from the combined sciences  of Anatomy and Physiology the structure and  uses of the different organs and their principal  parts in the insect in the imago or perfect state  In order to follow the account we shall have  to give the reader it will be convenient to take  some common insect such as a ivasp and fix in  the memory the names of the various parts we  shall have to distinguish in thus treating of the  imago insect A dragonfly is a good example also  We shall first mention the sfeneral arrangement  of the insects structure and subsequently take  up each part separately  It must first be mentioned that insects possess  no internal bony skeleton like that possessed by  ourselves and many other animals If we were  to cut open the dead body of a fly we should look  in vain for anything like the backbone or the  bones of the legs But it must not therefore  be thought that insects have no skeleton at all  Their skeleton is the thick hard horny substance  which forms their external covering In the wasp  for instance it will be easily perceived on pressing  the head or the trunk of the insect between the  fingers that there is a very firm solid coating  protecting the tender and delicate organs within  It is a very singular fact that the wisdom of the  Creator has so ordered this outside coating that  where it is most necessary to be strong as for  example when an insect has to burrow through  the ground or is in danger of being often crushed  there its thickness is greatest and again where  as in the case of those insects which live chiefly in  the air this thickening is less necessary because  there is less risk of injury to its body there the  external covering is thinner and softer So extra¬  ordinarily is one insect strengthened in its external  coats that it is scarcely possible to crush it by the  hardest squeezing between the thumb and fingers  It has on this account been compared to a once  famous London character called Leathercoated  Jack who used to suffer carriages to be driven  over his body without receiving any harm  In looking at an insect we perceive that it  is naturally divisible into three principal parts  first there is the head or caput next the trunk  or thorax and thirdly the hinder portion of the  body or abdomen If we turn to a Latin dictionary and hunt out the word insecta which  is the Latin term for ee insect we shall find that it  is derived from a verb which signifies to be cut  in or notched From this we see that the very  word insect has arisen from perceiving what we  are now alluding to the natural notching of the  body of these creatures into certain portions We  mentioned however at page 89 that the insect  in the larva form had a body which was in  almost every instance divided into thirteen segments or parts It may be asked Are these all  lost in the perfect insect or are they still to  be traced in it They are still to be traced in it  The head is one three form the trunk or thorax  and the remaining number constitute the abdomen but in order to save disappointment it  must be added that it is rare to find the full  number of segments or distinct parts in the  abdomen we seldom in fact find more than seven  or eight the remaining two or one being generally  hidden It is interesting however to trace in the  perfect insect these indications of its previous  larval condition especially when we remember the  strange appearance it underwent while a pupa  Now the various parts in the head division  are to speak generally the head proper the  mouth the eyes and the antennce Entomologists  describe a large number of other parts which  would also be mentioned here if this little  treatise were intended to give a minute account  of the insects anatomy and those features which  are of most prominence and importance will be  mentioned in addition when we come to speak  particularly of these several chief organs  The middle portion of the insect or thorax is  divided into three partsa front middle and  hinder part or in the language of entomology  a prothorax a mesothorax and a metathorax  Attached to the thorax are the icings and the legs  The remaining portion or abdomen is furnished  with organs and appendages not requiring special  mention in this place  Let us consider briefly the organs which are  seated in these divisions and beginning with the  head let us glean a few particulars upon that  most interesting topicthe eyes of insects We  might well fill a volume with this subject alone  for truly it is almost inexhaustible In the other  sections of the animal kingdom the eyes though  organs of the highest importance are nevertheless simple and little varied in their number and  arrangement But in insects whether we consider  their number their structure their arrangement  or their size we are lost in amazement at finding  these organs assume an importance in the insects  economy of which we have  no parallel elsewhere Look  for example at the accompanying representation of  the eyes of a bee and then  let us ask whether in all the  world beside we can find a  creature whose two eyes are  larger than all the rest of its head put together  What should we think of a quadruped as large as  a bull whose eyes occupied great part of its head  its forehead and the greater portion of its face  What astonishing powers of sight it would possess  The first tiling we learn about them is that  some insects possess what are called simple eyes  and compound eyes The accompanying cut re¬  presents in part the head of a flea  and is annexed in order to give a  specimen of a simple eye The  little circle represents the position  of the simple eye All the organs connected with  the head are supposed to be cut off The head of  the bee on the preceding page furnishes us with  an excellent illustration of a compound eye All  perfect insects are provided with compound eyes  and a large number with simple eyes too but  no imago or perfect insect has simple eyes alone  We see therefore that the simple eyes are only  additional or supplementary organs to the compound eyes which are the chief organs of sight  in these creatures These simple eyes are minute lenses generally placed upon the crown of  the head or the forehead in the bee this is  their position and by means of a pocketglass  they can be readily seen in this insect by  looking at its head from above They will be  found arranged in a triangular form Sometimes  an insect is furnished with as many as sixteen  of these simple eyes the spicier is among others  thus endowed But more commonly they are  only three in number Sometimes they are not  imbedded in the substance of the head as might  be supposed but are actually placed upon the end  of a little stalk presenting an appearance as singular as if at the end of a  bulls horn the animal were to possess an  eye in addition to his two others Swammerdam and Reaumur performed some  Eye 071 a siaik singular experiments upon these eyes in  the bee Reaumur varnished the back of the head  where these eyes are situated in more than twenty  bees so as of course entirely to blind these eyes  but leaving the large compound eye untouched  The bees were then set at liberty within a few  paces from the hive but not one of them knew  where to find it again nor indeed did they appear  to make any search for it They flew at random  to the adjacent plants but never to a distance  and though they seemed to have no difficulty in  flying they did not attempt to fly up into the  air  The compound eyes of insects are perhaps among  the most wonderful works of the Creators hands  In those gigantic creatures whose fossilized bones  are all now remaining to tell us of their history  the mastodon and megatherium and in such vast  creatures as the elephant and the whale we behold  the great power skill and wisdom of God but  here in a little object which we may cover with  a pins head or with a large grain of sand is a  more wonderful instance of His infinite and amazing power than all these The eye of a dragonfly  is a good instance of a compound eye and of all  the beautiful radiant gemlike objects that can  be selected for inspection through the microscope  this is the most exquisite Professor Muller the  great German physiologist has with wonderful  patience and care dissected the eye of this insect  and has given a most beautiful account of its  structure On examining the eye of this insect  even with a good pocket magnifying glass such  as those commonly sold by opticians for a few  shillings it will be found to present  the appearance of a beautiful net¬  work or very fine grating as is  shown in the cut When a greater magnifying  power is employed it will be seen that each space  in this network is a sixsided or hexagonal figure  Now each of these little spaces is filled by a beautiful minute lens of the same shape set in it  On making a perpendicular cut into the eye it has  been found to consist of various layers the outer  layer is a hard clear membrane composed of a  multitude of six sided facets  each forming a more or less  distinct coneshaped cylinder  which runs towards the centre  of the eye as seen in the cut  Under this is a layer of coloured  matter sometimes of a violet  or green or even reddish hue  which is pierced with as many holes as there  are facets Beneath this there is a varnish of a  black colour within which is a second layer of  coloured matter and in the space  between this last and the first coloured layer the delicate fibres of  the nerve of sight or optic nerve  run These fibres then converge  together at the back of the eye  Magnified seMon of part a single large nerve which is  connected with the insects brain and conveys  the impression of sight to that organ  Perhaps this account may be followed with some  difficulty let us therefore take a single facet and  trace it to its termination Each facet being in  fact a distinct eye we shall be able in so doing  to get a clear comprehension of the whole organ  which is after all only made up of a large number  of these distinct eyes Separating then one facet  from the rest we find this single eye to consist of  several portions 1 the sixsided facet 2 the  coneshaped cylinder clear and transparent 3 a  delicate fibre of nerve connected with the bottom  of this cone and 4 the large nerve itself The  diagram on the next page will make this perfectly  intelligible  But it may be asked What of the colouring  matter It exists in three places 1 The first  layer surrounds the cones 2 and separates them  from one another and from the nerve below  in part 2 The second layer surrounds the  nerve fibres 3 And 3 the last layer is at the  junction of the nerve fibre 3 with the nerve  itself 4  This apparently complicated mechanism well  deserves the readers attention nor should the  subject be quitted until it is clearly understood  We are unable to enter into further particulars  upon the structure and functions of this beautiful  apparatus but it must be added that  the following is the manner in which   the ray of light becomes perceived by  the insect It first passes through the  facet a next enters the cone b then  strikes upon the nerve c which conveys the impression taking the large  nerve d to the brain The colouring layers are intended to prevent any rays  of light from passing to other parts of the insects eye and so confusing the  impressions made upon its senses by  magnified external objects  The number of these facets or if we choose to  call them so distinct eyes varies in different  insects In some there are comparatively few in  others an amazing multitude The following list  of their number is given by Muller as observed  by various entomologists  In the Ant there are 50   Convolvulus Sphinx 1300   Common Housefly 4000   Silkworm Moth6236   Goat Moth11300  In the Dragonfly12544   Butterfly17355   Mordella 25088  According to the calculations of another author  there cannot be fewer than 34650 in the com¬  pound eye of a butterfly Amazing thought each  of this immense host is considered to be a separate  eye receives separate impressions of light and has  a separate structure and organization both perfect  in their kind  It is not difficult to remove the compound eye  of an insect and in so doing it will be found that  each lens is as clear as crystal The ingenious  Reaumur actually succeeded in removing one  and adjusting it to a lens and he found that  he could see through the insects eye very distinctly only he says the surrounding objects  appeared to be greatly multiplied There is a  common optical toy which is ground into a number  of facets which communicates this appearance to  objects when seen through it and thus furnishes  us with a good illustration of the endless confusion  of images which would have perplexed the insect  had not the various beautiful contrivances of which  we have spoken been adjusted to prevent it  But we must guard against a very natural mis¬  take which might arise upon the subject of the  eyes of insects from supposing them in any degree  comparable to those of higher animals as regards  their motions When man or an animal wishes  to look at any object they do so by causing  several muscles to be brought into action which  move the eyes round so as to receive the rays of  light from the particular point where this object  is placed and so admirably arranged is the  mechanism by which these movements are effected  that they are as well provided for all the purposes  of sight with two eyes as with twenty In insects  no such apparatus exists the eyes are quite immovable they are in fact set in the head like a  gem in a ladys ring and are altogether removed  from the control of the insect In order to obviate  the annoyance and inconvenience which would  result from this arrangement their eyes are  formed on the wonderful principles already mentioned and instead of insects being furnished with  two eyes they are provided with many thousands  They are thus enabled to enjoy not only the same  extent and range of vision with ourselves but even  a much larger  Insects are also furnished with a contrivance by  which they can see objects at a little distance and  objects at a great distanceit may be at the same  time which is more than can be strictly said of  ourselves In men and animals there is a very  exquisite apparatus arranged within the eye by  means of which it can accommodate itself to  objects close at hand or again to others at the  greatest distance We can see at one moment a  pin at our feet and at the next the summit of a  hill some thirty or forty miles off Now the laws  of light are such that to effect this properly we  must have some apparatus in the eye to arrange  its focal capacity so as to receive and concentrate  the lines of light proceeding from such different  points as the distance of a few inches and that  of many miles What this apparatus may be is  not as yet very satisfactorily determined But in  insects the same result is obtained by a very  curious provision Some of their eyes are short¬  sighted and some longsighted The simple eyes  are supposed by Professor Muller to be the  shortsighted eyes and the compound eyes the  lonosighted ones  The number of compound eyes in insects does  not often exceed two these being made up it will  not be forgotten by multitudes of single eyes  But in a few whose habits require that they  should be endowed with extraordinary means of  vision there are as many as four If the reader  would betake him to the brookside and creep  noiselessly along its margin some summer after¬  noon until he comes to a quiet glassy pool where  the water seems to have forgotten itself and fallen  asleep so still so silent and so smooth does it lie  reflecting all the lustre of the deepblue sky over¬  head he will surprise a dancing party of insects  busy waltzing at a wonderful rate now skimming  hither now shooting across the glassy pavement  on which they sport now joining together and  wheeling round and round and again as the king¬  fisher comes fluttering down the river as thousji  on some errand of immense importance breaking  up their party and flying into a thousand holes  and corners to wait until all is quiet Let him  exercise his activity and patience and catch one  of these giddy insects which are known to ento¬  mologists by the name of the Gyrinus Natator  and he will have a good example of an insect  provided with four compound eyes so that it can  see not only before and behind but upward into  the sky and downward into the clear cool waters  on whose surface its happy life is spent Some  insects like Cyclops of old are furnished only  with one eye and some it is said are quite blind  creatures that never feel the blessed influences  of the pleasant sunlight Like the simple eyes  the compound eyes are sometimes fixed on the end  of a little footstalk so as to give the insect some¬  what the appearance of being furnished with a  pair of opera glasses or short telescopes  In order to ascertain by what means the bee  found its way to the hive whether by seeing it  through its compound eyes or otherwise Reaumur  performed an interesting experiment similar in  character to the one before mentioned He  covered with a red varnish which was quite  opaque the compound eyes of a number of bees  taken from the same hive He then shut them up  in a box with several other bees from the same  hive which he left untouched The box was only  a few paces distant from the hive from which the  bees were taken He then opened the lid of the box  and those which had not been blinded instantly  flew out of it and entered their habitation Those  whose eyes had been varnished appeared not to  care to leave the box at all and seemed very un¬  willing to make any attempt to fly some of them  indeed flew about from one side to another but  did not go far Reaumur then threw several of  them up into the air and they immediately began  to soar higher and higher until at length they  went out of sight altogether Reaumur compares  the poor insects manoeuvres to those of a crow  whose head and eyes mischievous boys have  covered with a paper bonnet the bird flies upward  until its strength is exhausted when it drops again  to the earth Not only did those bees which he  threw up into the air thus soar until they were  lost to view but all the most active of those which  were left in the box did so likewise and Reaumur  saw them no more Not one could find its way  to the hive From this experiment and from the  preceding one it is evident that both the com¬  pound and the simple eyes are necessary to enable  the insect to see perfectly for when either was  varnished over the bees could not find their way  to their home again Reaumur imagines that the  cause of the wheeling flight of bees sometimes  observed now in this direction now in the opposite may arise from their eyes becoming perhaps  in part obscured by the pollen or yellow powder  of the flowers into which they plunge the bee  thereby becoming partly blindfolded These  experiments are so interesting that they deserve  repeating and it might be tried whether the result  would be different if only one eye were blinded  Other variations of the experiments will also  suggest themselves  Although not organs of sufficient size to give  their colouring the requisite distinctness and  amount of surface which would render it very  conspicuous in our estimation the eyes of insects  are often exquisitely beautiful and vie almost with  precious stones in lustre Their most common  colour is black or brown but the eyes of many  flies glow with fiery colours some banded with  green and purple some variously figured black  and red Some again glitter like burnished gold  shaded with the softest green and some blaze  with a play of colours like the diamond set in jet  The eye of the dragonfly in particular is a lustrous crystalline object of extreme beauty  We have dwelt as long as our limits will permit  on this wonderful apparatus of vision in insects  let us now turn our thoughts for a little space to  a pair of organs which are perhaps of all others  the most characteristic of the insect tribes these  are the Antenna We need scarcely explain  what these are or point them out to the reader  since they are so familiar to most persons but  under the erroneous or at any rate the questionable expressionthe feelers We have an excellent specimen of antenna in those of the  butterflies in which insects they are very long  and elegant organs They are attached to the  head by means of a beautiful joint called a ball  and socket the same as is often adapted to  garden watering enginepipes so as to enable them  to be moved about in all directions They are  never found absent in the perfect insect and are  manifestly organs of considerable importance in  the insect economy As to their structurewhen  examined under a microscope antennae are found  to be composed of a variable number of small  round pieces covered with a horny or leathery  skin but within being softer and hollow so as to  form a series of tubes placed end to end all connected together in such a manner as to admit of  free movement between each joint so that the  insect can bend them into any shape it may find  expedient for its purposes But it must not be  supposed that all antenna are similar in form  or there would be a risk of their being continually mistaken by the reader for some other  organ The cut on the next page will at a glance  exhibit the astonishing variety of form assumed  by these organs The common cockchafer is possessed of antennas as strikingly different in form  from those of the butterfly as if they were really  distinct organs intended and adapted to serve different purposes Some are long and threadlike some  resemble a necklace of pearls some are notched  like a saw some have a resemblance to a fan some  are like a club some resemble a fork and some a  feather in short their variety of form is almost  endless and they differ as much in length and in  thickness for while the antenna of some insects  are as long as or even longer than their bodies  those of others are  very short and little prominent and  while some are as  thin and fine as the  finest hair others  are nearly as thick  as the true body of  the insect Let us  now ask what is the  use of these singular  organs of the insect  From a hint which has before been dropped it  is probable that the answer to this question will  be readily anticipated Various facts appear to  show that they may be the insects ears Can  it be that such is their function some may exclaim calling to mind that ears in other creatures  are so different in appearance and structure from  these organs There have been many opinions on  the subject and some have maintained views completely opposed to this idea But the greater  number of entomologists seem to consider this as  their most probable function If they are not  ears we are not able to point to any other organs  in the head which are From a number of facts  it is certain that insects can hear from which it  is equally certain that they must possess special  organs We may therefore until the contrary is  shown with respect to them fairly be allowed to  consider the antennae as these organs The opinions  of Messrs Kirby and Spence on this point are conveyed in the following words They conceive  that antennse by a peculiar structure may collect  notices from the atmosphere receive touches or  vibrations and communicate them to the sensorium  or brain which though not precisely to be called  hearing may answer the same purpose The latti  celebrated DrW F Erichson of Berlin by means  of the microscope has discovered in all insects  and especially in those most remarkable for their  powers of smelling that these organs are furnished with a number of fine pores clothed with  membrane which he regards as organs of smell Every one has heard of M Pelisson the prioner at the Bastile and his spider companions  of the cell This gentleman had by patient  training engaged the attention of a spider which  used every day to come and listen to a solo on his  violin after which it would make its retreat again  to its home Now it is clear that this little insect  not only heard but even enjoyed the notes of his  instrument which would have been impossible  had it possessed no ears Then again every one  must have noticed the start which a fly will make  if some sharp noise be made near it and how  actively it will move its legs and seem to be put  all on the qui mve A little everyday observation will furnish us with many similar instances   A little moth writes one of the lastmentioned  authors was reposing on my window I made  a quiet not loud but distinct noise the antenna  nearest to me immediately moved towards me  I repeated the noise at least a dozen times and  it was followed every time by the same motion  of that organ till at length the insect being  alarmed became more agitated and violent in its  motions In this instance it could not be touch  since the antenna was not applied to a surface  but directed towards the quarter from which the  sound came as if to listen Can we question that  the merry grasshopper chirping all day in the  field is heard by its mate or that the cricket  on the hearth sings for its fellows or only to  please our ears or does the tap of the deathtick  beetle formerly commemorated draw forth no  answering tap from its companion on the other side  of the post All these instances and countless  more that might be mentioned indicate beyond  a question that insects have the faculty of hearing  and render it extremely probable that the antenna  are the organs by which this function is performed  But it is probable that they serve another and  not less important purpose The country folk  who are generally very weatherwise and whose  sayings always deserve a great deal of attention because they are very commonly founded  both upon observation of facts and experience  will always assure us that the high flight of  swallows in their search after insects is a certain  token of fair weather their low flight of approaching wet Why is this Can insects  foretell the state of the weather and if so by  what means That insects have a meteorometrical power of foretelling the state of the weather  appears beyond a doubt To select a few in  stances Bees our exemplars in so many points  might be consulted with advantage and would  often give us better information as to whether  an overcoat or an umbrella would be probably  required than the not always trustworthy barometer When engaged in their daily labours  if a change of weather to rain is at hand although  the sun may yet shine and the sky remain clear  and calm they foresee it and return suddenly  to their hives Hence in weather of an unsettled  description they never undertake journeys far  from home but make short excursions to and from  their hives beins never absent lonr at a time  and if we find a bee wandering far from its hive  it may be taken on the other hand as a pretty  sure prognostic that topcoat and umbrella may  be left at home for that day at least Ants  as we have already noticed possess the same  faculty of weatherwisdom never allowing their  larvae to be caught in a shower The abundance  of insects in our houses in wet weather is a familiar  observation we are assured that in hot countries  their excessive numbers during the rainy season  make these little creatures almost as terrible  as a plague to all who are withinclimbing up  the walls scrambling into the dishes drowning  themselves in the souptureens or putting out  the lights with their bodies In hot and sultry  weather when a black cloud or two in the far  horizon give token of a coming storm insects  abound in the air but as the heavens grow black  they disappear and before a drop of rain has  actually fallen we may look in vain for them  That the antennas are the organs by which this  knowledge of coming events with regard to the  weather is obtained by the insects appears probable They may perhaps perceive by their  delicate surfaces changes in the electrical condition of the air which are quite insensible to  ourselves and as all change of weather is pre¬  ceded and accompanied by changes of electrical  balance of one kind or another in the air they  may be thus forewarned of the coming danger  The following is the manoeuvre of a large number  of insects of the beetle tribe When they are  about to move from any station where they have  been at rest the first thing they usually do  before they move a step is to bring forward and  expand their antennae which have previously been  folded up out of the way They open them as  widely as possible so as to expose them to all  the influences of the air and then if they be  satisfied they unfold their wings and take their  flight We might compare this proceeding with  that of one of ourselves looking lip at the direction of the wind or tapping the weatherglass in  the hall previous to setting out for the day Too  much stress however it must be added is not to  be laid upon this point for while it is unquestionable that insects have knowledge of the weather  it is of course very difficult to ascertain with  certainty whether it is by means of their antenme  or by the general feeling of their bodies analogous perhaps to what rheumatic persons feel  when the wind goes round to the northeast  There is a still more singular use of the antennae  which deserves to be mentioned These organs appear to be the principal instruments of speech if we  may use such a term or at any rate of the communication of intelligence When the soldier ants  go out upon their expeditions and have left the  nest previously to setting off they touch each  other with their antennas and forehead on the  trunk and this is their signal for marching for as  soon as ever a soldier feels this tap he immediately  puts himself in motion When also they have  any discovery to communicate they strike with  them those that they meet in a particularly impressive manner and if a hungry ant wants to be  fed it touches with its two antennas moving them  very rapidly those of the individual from which it  expects its meal They appear to salute one another  by gently tapping each others antennae as we  should shake hands on meeting an old friend  M Huber has related an account of some  interesting experiments of his on a hive of bees  which strikingly proves that the antennas are  really organs for the transmission of intelligence  He wished to ascertain whether when they had  lost a queen they discovered the sad event by  their smell their touch or any unknown cause for  such a loss in the course of a single hour is made  known in some way or other to the whole hive  In order to ascertain this he first divided a hive  by a grate which kept the two portions a few  parts of an inch separated from each other so  that the bees could not come at each other  although any scent could easily have passed In  that part in which there was no queen the bees  were soon in great agitation and as they did not  discover where she was confined in a short time  they began to construct royal cells after which  they grew more calm Mr Huber next separated  them by a partition through which they could  pass their antennas but not their heads In this  case the bees all remained tranquil neither intermitting the care of the brood nor abandoning  their other employments nor did they begin any  royal cell The means they adopted to assure  themselves that their queen was safe and to communicate with her was to pass their antennas  through the openings of the grate A most  curious spectacle thus presented itself an infinite  number of those organs misdit be seen at once as it  were inquiring in all directions and the queen was  observed answering these anxious inquiries of her  dutiful subjects in the most marked manner for  she was always fastened by her feet to the grate  crossing her antennas with those of the inquirers  While we have been anxious to show that the  function of feeling is not the important and  principal office of these singular organs it would  be far from correct to state that the antennae are  not occasionally employed to use the popular term  as feelers All who have paid any attention  to the motions of insects must lmve seen the  antennae actually employed as it were in exploring  the number or nature of objects immediately  around From these and the preceding remarks  it becomes manifest that next to the organs  of sight the antennae are most important and  useful appendages to the body of the insect  When we consider the various purposes they  serve we become much perplexed to understand  how it is possible for one organ to fulfil such  varied duties nor can it be explained We are  unable to conceive of the senses of insects except  by comparing them with our own and in our  case there are no organs which can receive  and at the same time communicate intelligence  Our ears eyes nose and the other organs of the  senses have only one function severally assigned  to them and had they more there would probably be no little confusion in our perceptions of  external things Such confusion does not probably  exist in the insect but it is very possible that its  perceptions are somewhat different from ours  Before we leave the region of the head we have  the important task to fulfil of describing the  mouth of the insect this part is more complicated  than the organs we have as yet seen and requires  therefore a considerable degree of our careful  attention to enable us to do justice to it and to  carry in the mind a clear view of this interesting  portion of an insects structure If writes Mr  Westwood a beetle and a butterfly a house¬  fly or an aphis be examined whilst feeding a  totally different apparatus will be found in each  although perfectly adapted for the mode of feed¬  ing The beetle is employed in gnawing and  tearing in pieces hard or fleshy substances its  instruments of manducation are therefore horny  and robust The butterfly on the contrary has to  seek its food at the bottom of the tubes of flowers  and here in the glowing beams of the sun it revels  in its existence and sips the most delicious nectar  It is necessary for this purpose that it should be  provided with a long and slender instrument but  from the very structure of this apparatus it is  essential for its defence that so soon as the insect  has ceased feeding the instrument should be  lodged in a place of safety It is therefore rolled  up in a beautiful spiral direction and laid to rest  between a pair of hairy appendages which will  defend it from injury If we observe a common  fly sipping up a drop of spilt wine or revelling  upon a morsel of sugar it will be found that its  mouth is totally unlike either of the former it  is short thick and fleshy and acts as a sucker  the nutriment ascending through the canal which  runs upward into the throat The aphides and  all their brethren have a mouth differently constructed being a long and slender pointed canal  of a fleshy or leathery substance but furnished  internally with several slender bristles which the  insect employs as lancets to wound its prey In  the flea again the structure is quite different  To the variations in  the mouth of each of  these insects it has been  thought good to attach a  distinct name When for  example we speak of a 0 the HoneyBee  bees proboscis we speak actually of its mouth  The mouth of the butterfly is called  by most entomologists antlia that  of the aphis a promuscis that of  the flea a rostrulumc But the reader  must not allow himself to be confused by these  terms they all are but names for modifications of  the same partthe mouth When the butterfly  plunges its long tube into the flowerwhen the fly  intoxicates itself with a drop of syrup using its  proboscis to pump it upand when the flea thrusts  its rostrulum into our flesh and quaffs our life¬  blood as though it were nectarlet us not forget  the mouth is the organ employed in each of these  cases varied and altered in form though it certainly be  In all cases the various parts of the mouth may  be reduced to six the names of which deserve  remembering and this will be rendered easier by  the accompanying diagram in which they are  all separated and lettered so as to distinguish  each part these six parts consist of four side  pieces and two other organs one above the other  below The name of the upper organ is the upper  Up or in Latin labrum that of the opposite  lower one is the lower lip or labium The upper  pair of sidepieces are called the mandibles or  upper jaws the pair below are the lower jaws  or maxillce  Let us now briefly mention the use of these  various parts of the insects mouth beginning  with the upper lip a or labrum Unlike that  organ in ourselves the insects upper lip is gene¬  rally in such insects as bite their food a plate of  horny substance which serves the purpose of  an upper covering to the rest of the mouth Like  our own upper lips however that is to say like  those of men at least it is fringed with a sort of  moustache in most cases  The mandibles b or upper jaws in the biting  insects are instruments for cutting the food  in pieces When we bite our food the movement of our jaw is upwards and downwards but  in the insect it is like that of a pair of scissors or  from side to side These jaws are sometimes  frightfullooking instruments resembling in the  stagbeetle horns and their power is proportionally great Although their general use is to masticate or crush the food for the insect this apparatus  is often employed as a formidable weapon of  defence or offence and very frequently in the  excavation of a nest or retreat for the insect  They are sometimes so constructed as to look as  if they were furnished with several teeth  The maxilla or lower jaws are less firm and  strong than the preceding but they are more  complicated in their structure and have attached  to their sides remarkably delicate little processes  like the antennas which are called the palpi or  less properly feelers The lower jaws are much  varied in structure in different insects as may  well be imagined when it is mentioned that the  long and beautiful spiral tube of the butterfly  by which it drains the juices of the flower is in  reality composed of the maxillae or lower jaws  In ordinary cases the principal use of the lower  jaws appears to be to hold the food while the upper  jaws bruise and crush it but their use of course  varies with their structure and modifications  The last part of the mouth is the labium or lower  lip This also is a very complicated organ gene¬  rally serving to close the mouth from beneath like  the upper from above It boasts like the same  organ in higher animals of a chin below it called  the mentum and on each side of it are a pair of  feelers or palpi like those of the maxilla In the  centre a little tonguelike projection is visible in  the figure which is sometimes called the tongue  but perhaps not correctly if by that term is meant  the apparatus for tasting The lower lip is as  much varied as the maxilla  It would be impossible without going too far  into minute technical details to explain to the  reader how all these various parts of the mouth  are so modified and altered as to assume the very  different appearances presented to us in the insects  already mentioned This pleasure must be re¬  served for the time when well acquainted with the  generalities of insect history which alone form  the scope and subject of this little work he feels  anxious to study entomology as a science and he  will find a number of excellent books which will  then well repay his attentive perusal and satisfactorily answer all his inquiries on this and other  difficult topics connected with this science  It cannot fail to be noticed that in this description of the insects mouth no mention has been  made of its organs of taste Its eye and probably  ears and means of touch have all come before us  but where it will be asked is its tongue The  little organ mentioned as a part of the insects  lower lip although strikingly resembling a tongue  in some instances is in others very different from  it and appears in such cases to be quite unfitted  to act as the organ of taste We must therefore  suppose that other parts of the lower lip or mouth  have the same faculty in addition to the socalled  tongue It is very certain that insects have the  faculty of tasting and also of discriminating between their food as few will be disposed to  question who will place a plate of salt and a plate  filled with moist sugar in a sunny window on a  fine day it will soon become evident which will  be favoured with the attention of the flies  Neither has any mention been made of a nose  A common fleshfly however will soon satisfy  us that it is not devoid of some organ or other  which answers this purpose If we cover a piece  of meat under a cloth or put it into a wire  safe where it is certain that the fly cannot see  it it will scent it out as readily or even more  so than a cat or a dog would Sometimes this  insects nose proves a treacherous guide for  a plant has been described called the carrion  flower which diffuses an odour like that of putrid  meat which attracts the fly and induces it to  deposit its eggs thereon under the idea that its  future young will thus be hatched upon a certain  source of food but in vain for they perish almost  as soon as born finding nothing in the plant  whereon to existf But as to the precise seat of the   If we refuse to adopt Dr Ericlisons view of the use of the  antennas  f This plant is a native of South Africa and a fine specimen  of it exists in the conservatories at Kew Its botanical name is  Stapelia  organ of this sense opinions are greatly at variance Some believe it to exist in the spiracles  some in the mouth and some in a special organ  which they call the nose but which does not seem  in reality to fulfil that office at any rate in the  generality of cases M Huber showed the existence of this faculty to lie somewhere about the  mouth by some interesting experiments upon  bees He presented successively to all parts of a  bees body a camelhair pencil dipped in oil of  turpentine to which most insects are extremely  averse but the bee took no notice of it He then  took a very fine hair pencil while the bee had  extended its proboscis and presented it to its eyes  and antennae without effect but when he pointed  it near the cavity of the mouth above the insertion of the proboscis the creature started back in  an instant quitted its food clapped its wings and  walked about in great agitation and would have  taken flight if the pencil had not been removed  On this it began to eat again but on the experiment being repeated it showed signs of similar  discomposure oil of marjoram produced the same  effect and more promptly and entirely He then  seized several bees forced them to unfold their  probosces and stopped their mouths with paste  When this was sufficiently dry to prevent their  getting rid of it lie restored them to their liberty  they appeared by no means incommoded at being  thus gagged but moved about and breathed  as readily as their companions Huber then  tempted them with honey and presented to them  near the mouth oil of turpentine and other odours  that they usually have an aversion to but all  produced no sensible effect upon them and they  even walked upon pencils saturated with them  Leaving now the head of the insect it is necessary for us to make some mention of the parts  attached to the thorax or trunk In the head  division we have seen that the various organs of  the senses are situated we shall now find that in  the thorax division are placed the organs by  which the insect is either wafted in rapid evolutions to the highest air or runs with incredible  rapidity along the surface of the earth We  have already described on a previous page the  general structure of an insects wing It remains  therefore for us here to advert to a few other facts  in connexion with these elegant appendages  The natural number of wings in the insect  world is four arranged in two pairs But this  number is obscured by the modifications to which  in many instances one or other of the pairs  becomes subject and we should if this were not  remembered become somewhat confused at taking 1  up the first insect that came in our way which  would probably be the common fly and finding  that we could only  recognise two  large wings in¬  stead of four In  this tribe of insects  the hinder pair of  wings is reduced  to a pair of slender  knobbed filaments  The House Fly Natural size and magnified  Some insects are without wings at all The ant the  bee the dragonfly the housefly and many other  insects are furnished with wings of gauzelike transparency and structure often crossed in a curious  manner by the nervures of which we before had  occasion to speak These wings are called membranaceous In the moth and butterfly tribes the  wings are covered with what appears to be a delicate beautiful powder but is in reality a multitude of exquisite scales of the singular forms  represented The engraving shows the shape  of the scales on the wings of these insects on  examination with a  good lens it appears that the long  and hairlike scales  are planted at the  margin of the wings  and contribute to  give to the edges  that beautiful feathery look which is so much  admired while the short scales were placed principally on the middle portion of the wings their  numbers are almost infinite If a butterfly is  allowed to flutter awhile in a box it will cover  every portion of its surface with them and yet  on being permitted to fly out we may scarcely  perceive that it has lost any of its fairy plumes  Whether Leuwenhoek actually took the trouble  to count so many or arrived at the result from  calculation after counting those on a given space  we do not know but he declares that he found  more than four hundred thousand on the wings  of the silkworm moth and in those of larger  moths and butterflies the number must greatly  exceed this They are generally arranged like  the tiles on a houseroof and if they are scraped  off the minute dots where each was attached  becomes distinctly visible The term used to indicate the tribe of insects to which the moth and  butterfly appertain is as has been before remarked Lepidoptera or scalewinged from this  very fact Some membranaceous wings are clothed  If we take up a beetle  and look for its wings for  the first time we shall  probably fail in detecting  them that is of course if  the insect has not been ob¬  served in the act of flying  On examining the body  we see indeed a pair of  shining horny plates on  its back but surely these are not wings Presently the insect having mounted to the top of  our finger prepares for flight its two hard cases  fly up and behold from beneath them appears  a pair of the most beautiful gauzelike wings  which it quickly unfolds puts into motion and  then flies away The two thick and horny covers  for these delicate organs are called elytra or   wingcases They are really the first pair  of wings much thickened and their use is to  protect the delicate membranous wings of the  hinder pair beneath them When the insect  Hies they open like a boxlid and are carried out  of the way of the other wings when the insect  rests it carefully folds up its other wings and then  these close over them and preserve them from all  injury As the insects in which they are found  frequent places of danger burrow underground  or take up their abode under stones it is manifest  how admirable a contrivance this is for such purposes and how efficiently the fragile wings will  be covered and protected by such shields The  first pair of wings is sometimes thickened to the  consistence of parchment as a cover to the other  wings and they are then called tegmina or   winocovers  There are two other circumstances in connexion  with this part of our subject which deserve  noticing If the reader will take into his hand  a large blowfly and carefully examine its body  with a lens near the spot where the wings are connected to it he will succeed in discovering two  organs of a curious kind One of these is a small  membranous piece connected with the trunkend  of the wings and is generally called the icinglet  or alula The other looks like a little drum¬  stick hanging down and is called the balancer or  poiser or in Latin the halter or bridle It is not  clear of what use either of these organs is Since  the winglets are the largest in the heaviest bodies  and are altogether wanting in the lightest it  appears probable that one of their principal uses  is to assist the wings during flight If one might  hazard the conjecture perhaps they act like the  parachute of a balloon As to the socalled  balancers it has been considered that they serve to  poise the insect while flying Dr Derham considered that they kept the body steady during flight  and he states that if either a poiser or a winglet is  cut off it will fly awkwardly and unsteadily as if  it had lost some very necessary part Another  observer states that he cut off the winglets of a fly  leaving both its wings and poisers but it could  no longer fly He also cut off in another fly the  poisers alone and the same result took place On  cutting off both the poisers of a cranefly he says  it was unable either to fly or walk Mr West  wood says he has seen the poisers beat rapidly  upon the winglets like drumsticks on a drum and  it has been supposed that this action is the cause  of the hum made by the insect in flying This is  doubtful because it has been found that after the  winglets are cut away the humming sound is still  produced and some humming insects have no  winglets  So much importance did Linnaeus the great  father of natural history attach to the character  of the wings in insects that he arranged the  various families of insects under several heads  expressive of the leading character of their wings  The orders into which he thus divided insects are  seven in number 1 Coleoptera or casewinged  2 Hemiptera or halfwinged 3 Lepidopterct  or scalewinged 4  Nenroptera or nerve¬  winged 5 Hipnenop  tera or membrane  winged 6 Diptera  twowinged and 7  Aptera or wing  less the Greek word  pteron signifying a  wing furnishes the  termination to each  of these titles the  prefix is also derived  from the Greek and  its import may be de¬  rived from the trans  lation attached to each This s 7 stem has been  extended by modern entomologists who have sub¬  divided the 2d 5th and 7th orders into additional  ones  In the opposite cut the insects represented illus¬  trate each of the Linnean orders They are  1 a Beetle 2 an Aphis 3 a Butterfly 4 a Bee  5 a Dragonfly 6 a Housefly and 7 a Spider  As these organs exhibit to us in the most  conspicuous manner the exquisite beauties where¬  with it has pleased God the Almighty Creator  to adorn the insect world we may be allowed to  make some reference to the colours of the wings  before proceeding to speak of those organs by  which the insect moves on earth Some of the  beetle tribe are like tiny masses of burnished  metal gleaming with colours of the most exquisite  description A vast number of locusts are re¬  markable for the splendour of their wings Many  dragonflies are adorned with wings vying with  those of the butterfly in loveliness The wings of  many flies are exquisitely painted with the most  brilliant metallic hues green and gold and even  those of a housefly are often very beautiful by  their having the property of iridescence or reflecting the prismatic colours of light But insects of  every tribe however splendid in attire fade before the glories of the butterfly tribe Linnaeus  speaking of the splendid colours of these insects  and particularly of the gorgeous tints which  appear on the upper surface of the wings of a  butterfly called the MorphoMenelaus and another  justly observes that there is scarcely anything in  nature that for brightness and splendour can be  paralleled with this colour It is a kind of rich  ultramarine that vies with the deepest and purest  azure of the sky and what must cause a striking  contrast in flight the prone surface of the wings  is as dull and dark as the opposite is brilliant so  that one can conceive this insect to ajipear like a  planet in full radiance and under eclipse as its  wings open and shut in the blaze of a tropical sun  The scales on the wings of some species shine  with such extraordinary intenseness and brilliancy  that it is impossible to look at them in a bright  light as they completely dazzle the beholder  Messrs Kirby and Spence say they know no  insect upon which the sight rests with such untired pleasure as upon the lovely butterfly that  bears the name of the unhappy Trojan king  Papilio Priamus the contrast of the rich green  and black of the velvet of its wings with each  other and with the black of its abdomen is  beyond expression regal and magnificent What  adds to the beauty of the wings of this tribe  of insects is the appearance of the beautiful spots  like eyes which are so familiar to us and which  are almost without a parallel except in the animal  world This ornament gives to the wings of a  butterfly an indescribable life and beauty and  constrains us as we contemplate it to acknowledge  that c Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed  like one of these 7 The astonishing variety of  combination in the colours communicates an inexpressible charm to these insect glories here is a  lustrous blue a glowing orange a delicate lemon  an exquisite pink a fiery copper or a spotless  white None but a Divine hand could have produced such effects as are exhibited in these most  gorgeously painted organs No work of man will  endure comparison with them The most elaborately finished miniature upon which the artist  may in the features and dress of the person have  expended all the resources of his art in the production of harmonious and pleasing tones of colour  appears but as a muddy lustreless patch when  placed side by side with one of the butterflybeauties  of the tropics or even of our own green fields  We must not however allow the fascination of  these beautiful objects to engross our whole attention and it is now time for us to state some  particulars connected with the legs of the imago  or perfect insect Six is the true number of legs  which belong to the insect in the imago state  They are connected to its body at the thorax and  are formed of a series of minute tubes provided  internally with muscles and nerves They are  commonly divided into four parts a the haunch  b the thigh c the tibia and d e the foot  The front pair of legs or as they are generally  called the forelegs are considered by some authors  to be really the insects arms the last portion of  them being the hand Certainly they are often  as useful to the insect as is this admirable oroan  to ourselves not only are they serviceable in  walking but they also enable the insect to climb  to lay hold of various objects or to catch their  prey to dig in the earth and in many instances to  clean the head and face of the creature an operation in which many of them and particularly hies  and bees among our domestic insects are most  praiseworthily particular having apparently an  aversion to nothing so much as to a dirty face and  unbrushed jacket The other pairs of legs are altered  in various manners in order to fit them for the  different purposes for which they are required by  the insect  The purposes for which the legs are put into  requisition are as will be easily guessed for walk¬  ing or running for jumping for climbing and for  swimming Most surprising in all these respects  is the degree of agility and swiftness with which  it has pleased the Divine Creator to endow these  insectorgans M Delisle once observed a fly  only as large as a grain of sand which ran three  inches in half a second and in that space made the  enormous number of fire hundred and forty steps  If a man were to be able to walk as fast in pro¬  portion to his size supposing his step to measure  two feet he would in the course of a minute  have run upwards of twenty miles a task far surpassing our express railroad engines or the famous  Seven League Boots recorded in the nursery  fable In leaping also insects far excel man  or any other animal whatever The flea can leap  two hundred times its own length so also can  the locust If a man were six feet long and could  leap as high and as far as one of these insects he  might stand near Bow Church in Cheapside leap  up into the air over the top of St Pauls cross  and alight at the bottom of Ludgate Hill which  would be something more wonderful than it has  ever entered into the minds of the writers of fairy  tales to conceive of The insect called the fros  hopper can leap more than two hundred and  fifty times its own length Some spiders can leap  a couple of feet upon their prey The legs of  insects that swim are generally peculiarly fitted  for it either by their being expanded somewhat  like an oar or by having a dense fringe of hairs  upon them The waterbeetles after rising to  the surface of the stream for a supply of fresh air  dive down to their watery home again taking a  clear silvery bubble along with them and in this  action they move with considerable rapidity their swimming legs which are clothed  with hairs The water boatman  swims upon his back by means  of his singularly formed legs  The little whirlgig of which  we have before spoken swims  by means of its legs which are paddleshaped By  means it may be of some peculiar secretion which  repels the water some insects can actually walk  upon its surface and that as readily or more so than  upon land Those who know the pleasures of  shooting with polished skates over clear ice when  it almost seems as if we were moving in the air  and no more condemned to earth can imagine  something of the delight these insects must experience who can glide as swift as thought over the  glassy surface of the brook Sometimes the shape  of the hindlegs is remarkably altered and per  haps the most extraordinary instance of this in  the whole insect world is the foreign insect  which has been called the Kangaroo beetle  The cut represents  faithfully this most  wonderful creature and we could  almost fancy as  we looked at it  that by some accident the front   pair of legs and the head had been twisted round leaving the  hind legs and part of the body turned in the opposite direction It need scarcely be added that  the origin of this insects curious title was derived  from the resemblance borne by its hind legs to  those of the animal whose name it bears In  some insects the legs fold upon each other and are  packed into a very small compass this is particularly the case in a species of woodlouse which  roll themselves up into balls precisely resembling  beads or pills as may be imagined from the following anecdote A servant maid of the great  Swammerdam while walking in the garden one  clay found a large number of round black shining  beads which were streaked with white bands and  presented a very pretty and attractive appearance  Gathering a number of these in her hand she  thought she would convert them into a necklace  or for ought we know into a rosary when to her  great surprise the beads became animated as soon  as ever they felt the point of the needle with  which she was about to thread them and began to  struggle actively to get away not however too  quickly for her for with a violent scream imagining the beads were bewitched she ran into the  house Some of the beetle tribe thus fold up  their legs and roll themselves up so as to resemble  little globular pebbles  The Abdomen is then the only remaining portion of the insect which eve have now to notice  It has no legs attached to it and contains the in¬testines and other portions of the insects internal  anatomy It is formed of a varying number of  rings which are easily distinguishable in the wasp  and many other insects and these rings are connected together by delicate folds of membrane  fitting sometimes into each other like the tubes of  a telescope in other instances fastened together  like so many hoops by their edges In consequence of this mode of structure it is often very  movable and may even be bent into a half curve  in various directions at the pleasure of the insect  The common earwig is particularly gifted with  this movableness of its abdomen and so are many  insects which carry weapons of offence or defence  in their tails These organs or appendages are  deserving of a brief notice although it is probable  that the structure of some of them is already familiar to most readers  The sting of the bee is perhaps as formidable a  weapon as any of those attached to the abdomen  in insects under the microscope the structure of  this apparatus appears in all its beauty It is  found to consist of a sort of sheath or scabbard  which is composed of two pieces and is of extreme  fineness as will be readily made visible by placing  a fine sewing needle by its side when the latter  will more resemble a bar of iron from the smiths  forge or a kitchen poker than anything else while  the former will under the strongest magnifying  power exhibit a smoothness elegance and polish  of the most beautiful description When the bee  thrusts forth its sting it is the sheath which we  generally see and not the more delicate apparatus  which is enclosed within it Inside this scabbard  is a pair of most fine darts which are even more  delicate than the human hair and are therefore  invisible to the eye unassisted by a good lens  These darts are notched like very fine saws at the  end the teeth being so directed as to oppose the  retraction of the instrument if it is thrust into the  human skin the sting being therefore left in the  wound and the wounded person having the com¬  fort of knowingif we should call it a comfort  that the insect will surely die speedily in consequence of its attack upon him An exquisite  adaptation of fine muscles is attached to this  weapon by which it is forcibly driven home  The venom which produces the pain and inflammation is contained in a small muscular bag in  connexion with the sting and when the latter is  thrust out the poison is also forced out and flows  into the wound The sting of the scorpion is a  less complicated but more dangerous weapon  though not often fatal The earwig though un¬  provided with a sting carries a most awfullooking  forceps in its tail which it can put in action with  great force on occasion of danger and since it can  twist its abdomen about with great facility it is  a contrivance of which a tender finger may well  be afraid  Among the wingless insects of Linnaeus is one  which he has called by a name which signifies  that it has got a leg in its tail and this is actually the fact in so far as that these insects  have an organ in their tail which answers all the  purpose of a leg Some of these little creatures  which are black may be often found in spring  strewed in infinite numbers upon the surface of  the water in ditches or pools and may be seen  jumping about on the surface of the water as if  bewitched At their tail is a forklike organ  which is generally bent under the body but  when they spring up they do so by quickly un¬  bending this fork the resistance it meets with  being sufficient to carry it to a certain distance  Another insect is provided with eight pair of  springs in its abdomen by means of which it can  leap to a great distance with most astonishing  agility Here we shall conclude the external  anatomy of the insect in the imago state  CHAPTER III  RESPIRATION OF THE IMAGO  Perfect insects breathe That this is so the  following experiments will satisfactorily prove  A spicier and a fly were put into a glass jar  the mouth of which was closed all but a hole by  which a tube was admitted The tube was then connected with a pipe by which a supply of common  coalgas was poured into the jar and when it was  considered to be full of gas and that all the air  had been displaced the tube was closed and the  insects were left shut up in an atmosphere of gas  In a few seconds both became very uneasy the fly  more particularly so and in a few seconds more the  fly began to agitate itself to buz against the sides of  the glass and to tumble over in the most extraordinary manner the spider ran hurriedly about as  if astonished and not knowing what to make of his  new position but presently he became very quiet  and turning on his back looked as if dead For a  minute or two the fly which was a large active  fleshfly continued its noisy evolutions dashing  itself as if intoxicated on every side of its trans¬  parent prison At length as if exhausted it lay  on its back its limbs paralyzed but the wings still  moving with extreme rapidity and causing it to  spin round in the most singular manner Ultimately it too became perfectly without motion  After the lapse of about ten minutes fresh air  was gradually let into the jar and it became most  amusing to watch the return of both these insects  which had previously been as it were in the very  jaws of death back to life again twitchings of  their limbs and slight convulsive movements  were the first indications of returning activity  and in a few minutes more both insects now  placed in a perfectly pure atmosphere were as  lively as before the experiment and were alloAved  to make their escape into the open air With  other insects the same effects Were produced by  saturating a piece of blotting paper with ether and  dropping it into the jar which was immediately covered over In several other experiments  the newlydiscovered powerful fluid chloroform by  means of which the operations of surgery are  performed without pain was employed and it  was remarkable to notice how quickly the insects  were overpowered with the vapour of this potent  liquid In no instance was death produced by  the gases or vapours employed Wishing to  destroy without pain a beautiful specimen of a  goatmoth it was first stupified with the gas then  transfixed with a pin and again plunged in an  atmosphere of gas all night long but alas for  the unhappy insect the morning dawned and it  was yet alive  In these simple experiments which were repeated  sufficiently often to render the results certain we  have a most interesting proof that insects breathe  The first struggles and apparent intoxication can  be compared to nothing more exactly than to the  same phenomena when they take place in human  beings breathing the vapours of ether or chloroform The subsequent state of insensibility was  precisely similar to that induced in persons who  are put under the influence of these vapours  An amusing instance of the restorative powers  of fresh air occurred in the course of these experiments A bluebottle which was purposely selected of as large a species as could be found was  first intoxicated and rendered insensible by coal  gas and was then as quickly as possible put into a  net of the geometric spider instantly the spider  flew upon his bulky captive but the fresh air began  to take effect on the fly and it commenced struggling in the most furious manner Although the  spider cast out a cloud of web and in the most  energetic manner endeavoured to envelope its prey  the fly seemed likely to be the victor one of its  large and powerful wings got free and flapped violently until the meshes of the web gave way or  was perhaps broken by the weight of the insect  and fly and spider being suspended in the air  spun round so swiftly as to be quite indistinguishable Ultimately the spider conquered and  suspending the huge body of its victim by a rope  in the air returned for a short time to its den  If insects do not breathe then all these results  are quite unintelligible for it would be immaterial to the insect what atmosphere it might happen  to be placed in A number of illustrious authors  have recorded the result of their experiments upon  the effects of other gases on insects Bees and  other insects have been placed under the exhausted  receiver of an airpump and death ensued in a short  space of time It has also been found that when the  bodies of insects are covered with oil or grease so  as to stop up their breathing pores they soon  expire It has been proved by carefully con¬  ducted experiments performed by Mr Ellis M  Sorg and other observers that on placing flies in  a measured quantity of atmospheric air at the end  of a day or two almost the whole amount of the  oxygen of the air had disappeared and the same  amount of carbonic acid had appeared in the chamber in which the insects were confined We need  not however after all that has been said on the  subject of the respiration of insects in their various stages enter into any further proofs that  insects breathe not less perfectly in their imago  condition than in any of the preceding states  in fact they perform this function far more prominently in this their last state than in any of the  foregoing It will also be unnecessary to enter  into a consideration of the minute particulars connected with this subject as several of these have  been previously glanced at The air enters the body of the insect at the  spiracles or breathingpores which are arranged  along the abdomen and situated at the side of the  wings and is received by a large tube on each  side of the body running its whole length or  nearly so as we before mentioned This tube and  those which it gives off as branches are called  trachea or airpipes The tracheae are formed  in the most wonderful manner so as to keep  them always open that the air can readily pass  through them Perhaps some of our readers  have seen the contrivance adopted by sailors in  order to blow air down into the hold and cabins  of the ship for those who have not we may  take the liberty of mentioning that it is a large  tube made of canvass open at the side near the  top so as to catch the wind while the bottom of  it opens into the cabin Now the sailors always  place the mouth of this tube towards the wind  which is forced down the tube into the cabin  either by its own speed or by that of the vessel  in the case of a steamer and so fills the cabin  below continually with fresh air But it will be  asked how do they contrive so to keep the sides  of the bag from flapping together as to prevent  them from closing By imitating a contrivance  which exists in the trachea or airtube of the  insect they place at certain distances inside this  canvass tube a series of wooden hoops which en¬  tirely prevent its collapsing as it otherwise would  do The most minute airtubes of an insect are  furnished not indeed with a series of rings but  with what serves the same purpose a firm but  delicate coil of cartilage like a spiral spring over  which the membranous lining of the tube is  stretched Thus these tubes remain constantly  open and whatever may be the movements of  the insect they retain this position The tracheae  branch out in a most wonderful manner inside the  insects body as thickly as in our bodies and in  those of animals the fine bloodvessels divide until  they form a mesh so close that we cannot prick our¬  selves with a pin without piercing some little tubes  and drawing blood so in those of the insect the  minute airpipes run in every direction and divide  into countless thousands of branches which only  become visible under the highest powers of a good  microscope The large tubes are seen without  difficulty in many insects and a drawing which  may give some idea of the immense mass of air  tubes existing in the body of an insect is annexed  all the rest of the body is supposed to be cut away  and the larger tubes only are shown as it is impossible to represent the smaller ones so as to give  a clear view of their  arrangement they  would cover the drawing like a cloud of the  finest and most delicate lace work In  short in insects there  being no separate lungs  in a particular place  as in the animal frame  the air is necessarily  carried all over the   so as to be supplied even to the most  minute parts thus the  lungs may be said to extend through the whole  body  As the reader has laid his finger on his pulse or  felt his heart beating within him or seen a drop  of blood ooze from his wounded hand have the  questions never occurred to himHave insects  bloodvessels and a beating heart And if so  have they blood like ours Many a wise man of  old even the great Baron Cuvier himself has  supposed that there was no circulation of the  blood in insects But with a magnifying glass  and a caterpillar before us we shall soon be satis¬  fied that this is a great mistake for by carefully  looking along the insects back we shall perceive  in that part a very evident pulsation as though a  fluid were pushed at regular intervals towards the  head The cut represents the  circulation in the vessels of the  larva of an Ephemera But in¬  sects have no heart like that of  man and animals What then  can this beating organ be which  we behold Although it is not  like our heart it is nevertheless  an organ which serves all the  purpose of ours and pumps on  The circulation in an Ephemera The arrows repre tllC blood With great regularity  sent tie direction of the Instead of being a muscular  organ of small size but great thickness like  our heart it is in reality a long tube called the  dorsalvessel running along the abdomen and thorax  of the insect into which the blood is poured by the  veins and out of which it is forced on towards the  head by the regular contractions of its side This  causes the beating movement which we saw in the  caterpillar Perhaps there may be some curiosity  to know whether an insects pulse beats faster or  slower than ours John Hunter counted thirty  four beats in a minute in a silkworm Another  observer counted thirty a minute in a caterpillar  of the pinemoth But in the imago state the pulse  appears to move much quicker and it is easy to  make an insects beat extremely fast by exciting or  provoking it Mr Newport having done so to a  bee counted as many as 142 beats a minute In  a middleaged man the pulse beats about seventy  times in a minute in a child seven years old about  eightyfive times and at the age of fourteen about  eighty times Hence it follows that our pulse beats  about twice as fast as that of an insect in the  larva state in the imago state it is probably as a  general rule at least in winged active insects  higher than ours  CHAPTER IV  FOOD AND DEATH OF THE IMAGO  But we have something to say about the food  of insects Although it has been already laid  down as a general rule that insects in their perfect state do not eat in any degree with the  voracity they exhibit in the larva form it is  nevertheless true that they do both require and  devour food in considerable quantities and of  various kinds Some for example are exclusively  vegetable feeders They attack all the parts of  plants not excepting even the root and the bark  Some with an elegant taste select the yellow  pollen of flowers for their dainty and delicate food  And others more refined still in their appetites  will have nothing but the fresh distilled honey  that lies hid at the bottom of the flowers pump¬  ing it up by the beautiful spirallycoiled tube  which forms a part of their mouth Need we say  these are the butterflies The fly loves a grain of  sugar or a savoury joint of meat and to other  insects to use a quotation of Mr Spences which  prefer the paper of our Atlases or maps   a river and a sea  Are a disli of tea  And a kingdom bread and butter  A large number also are carnivorous creatures  need we mention the spidertribe a name of terror  to myriads of our summer insectfriends The  beautiful cicindeloe called by Linnaeus the tigers  to insects prey upon the whole insect race and  are endowed with powers of offence and destruc¬  tion to a degree sufficient fully to justify this  title In France we are told the butchers  are very glad to have wasps attend their stalls  since they drive away and undoubtedly prey  upon the numerous flies which frequent these  places The larger species of ants are equally  ferocious attacking any small softbodied insect  they may meet with and when killed dragging it  to their nest The beautiful ladybirds which we  look upon with so much tenderness remember¬  ing the ditty   Ladybird ladybird fly away home  Your house is on fire your children will burn  are in the larva state furious destroyers of other  insects and will gobble up aphides by the score in  a very short time The dragonfly too stands  conspicuous among the insect devourers not only  in its larva but in its perfect condition and falls  upon multitudes of insects plucking off their  wings and with savage relish devouring their  bodies We are not however to suppose that the  appetites of carnivorous insects are confined to  insectfood The blow fly lives upon and defiles  by depositing its eggs in our butchers meat The  cockroach will polish a bone as clean as or cleaner  than any dog will and indeed will consume  almost anything that happens to come in its way  Lastly we may not omit to mention that some  insects have to plunge their armed mouths into  our flesh and that of other animals and to slake  their raging thirst in a draught of our lifeblood  among which we will only enumerate the musquito the gnat and the flea We need scarcely  say that insects are provided with proper organs  of digestion  Singular to add some insects in the perfect  state do not eat at all The silkworm moth and  the Ephemera are amongst this number they live  so short a time as not to require food Some in¬  sects also possess a most extraordinary power of  abstaining from food There have been at different  times wonderful tales related of human beings  who in a supposed trance have endured the privation of food for an extremely long timeweeks  and even months And more recently we have  an account of an Indian who suffered himself to be  buried alive built over with bricks and mortar  and a great seal set upon the only opening to his  tomb a guard being also set and after the  expiration of a certain time before agreed upon  the sepulchre was opened and he was taken  outalive All this is extremely wonderful if  we could only feel certain that there was no  deception in the case But it is nothing to what  can be adduced from the insect world The ant  lion has been known to endure a fast of six entire  months and to be as lively as possible at their  termination An author quoted by Messrs  Kirby and Spence kept a spider in a sealed  glass for ten months at the end of which time  though shrunk in size it was as vigorous as  ever And Mr Baker relates that he once kept  a beetle alive for three years without food of any  kind whatever  When we call to memory the intense voracity of  the insect while a larvahow insatiable its appetite how extensive its ravagesand contrast it  with the perfect insect we are struck with astonishment Why is this we ask that in all cases  insects eat less when they are fully developed  than when in their infancy and youth It is as  if a fullgrown healthy man were to eat less than  his little child a year or two old The reason appears to be that in the imago state no further  changes which consume a great deal of material  as may be imagined when we remember the loss  of substance in every cast of the skin are necessary the insect only requires food sufficient to  preserve its life and activity in the state to which  it has come and needs no laying up of stores of  fat for future consumption Fluttering awhile in  glorious apparel through a world of flowers and  sunshine the period of its life runs out and its  only further change isto die and return to its  kindred dust  But before this takes place one last duty devolves upon the insect which unfulfilled would  leave the world at its death with one link in the  chain of creation broken offthis is to make  provision for the continuance of its species We  have already said that insects as a general rule  have been no doubt in wisdom destined to  deposit their eggs not knowing what is to come  forth of them and never enjoying that happiness  which is granted to many other beingsthe happiness of parental love Some most interesting  exceptions to this rule will have also been mentioned in which a mothers love for her young has  been exemplified in a remarkable manner  Yet though denied this pleasure and privilege  the motherinsect exercises as we have before  seen all the care and forethought of the most  affectionate parent in depositing its eggs and in  making such arrangements as will be most conducive to the happiness and wellbeing of its  future progeny We can scarcely say that in  this it shows that it possesses anything like such  a feeling as that of a parent towards its child  It takes the wonderful precautions and performs  the singular actions which have been already  in part recorded in our first chapter in all  probability without being aware of the reasons  why it should do so How can it tell that its  future progeny will eat this food or that food  How can the poor blowfly when it leaves its eggs  on our food be certain that it is appointing a  suitable place for the birthspot of its progeny  Why does it not select the green surface of the  leaf or the warm corner of the window or the  bare earth for this purpose We might say  perhaps in this instance that the insect is only  choosing the place where it obtains its own food  But what shall we say when we find insects such  as the butterfly depositing their eggs upon plants  which they never frequent at any other time and  from which they never obtained a particle of food  themselves Some for instance deposit them on  the nettle although never tasting anything from  this plant themselves while the young which are  to proceed forth from the eggs feed voraciously  upon it  We cannot in any way but one account for  this forethought The poor insect left to itself  would undoubtedly deposit its eggs indifferently  anywhere and the result would be that its  young family if hatched at all would awake  only to find themselves in a desert without  food or hope of reaching any and would soon  perish Need we say how it can be easily  accounted for Surely only because it is God  who has instructed these humble creatures enduing them if not actually with the powers of  foresight at any rate with the instinct which  impels them to proceed in such a manner as if  they were thus endowed By a most wonderful  exercise of wisdom He has taught them to distinguish even between the different species of plants  and rarely indeed do we find that the insect commits a mistake or selects a wrong or fatal birth¬  place for its young  Insect history is full of such instances of the  great Creators wisdom and love Although they  are not rendered conspicuous to every eye they  are not the less real nor the less amazing In  our Life of an Insect many have been the occasions when we have stopped to wonder afresh at  continually new and more striking indications of  His adorable goodness and power as the different  phenomena of insectlife have been paraded before  us Yet this is but a very minute portion of what  really exists of the admirable and beautiful in the  insect world Not one volume not a hundred volumes would suffice to relate the interesting facts  which connect themselves in various ways with the  insects life The main features only have been  developed and these imperfectly Such being  the case what a world of wonders is the great  creation were we to consider it only as peopled  with insects What pen could write their history  what tongue narrate the many marvels of their  existence Ten thousand times ten thousand and  thousand of thousands surround us on every side  accompany us on our excursions and visit us in  our homes fill the air with life and the waters  with creeping things  The history of an insects life impresses upon  us one of the most consoling truths contained in  the word of God We may learn from the tale  of Gods wonders in the vegetable creation we  may find also in the history of birds beasts and  fishes innumerable proofs of His love and care  and goodness to all But these are creatures whose  size in the main renders them conspicuous too  much so as we might say to be overlooked Ah thenwere there no insects one might  doubtingly exclaim God may take thought for  these large creatures while more minute beings  would be beneath His notice And so with me  God may order and arrange the great events in  my life but are not the little ones too small for  Him to regard The life of an insect answers  these doubts It tells us that though a being be  only of the size of a grain of sand or not larger  than the full stop at the end of this sentence God  has supplied it with the most beautiful organs  has endowed it with life and with the most wonderful instincts thus manifesting that in the  words of Scripture His care is over all His  works If God then  i To whom an atom is an ample field  has not thought it beneath Him to take care for  such diminutive shortlived creatures as these  how much more will He care for His own people  reconciled to Him through the blood of Jesus and  sanctified by the Holy Spirit of promise We  are not left however to learn this blessed truth  from the page of creation alone Our Lord has  himself declared to us that the very hairs of our  head are all numbered and has left on record the  promise that if we seek first the kingdom of  God and His righteousness all these things  that is all temporal things shall be added  unto us  K E  THE END
